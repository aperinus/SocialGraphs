The [[Great Depression]] hits, and she soon takes to [[freighthopping]]. A few years later, she meets Big Bill Shelly, a union organizer, and they become lovers. Together with Rake Brown, a gambler, and Von Morton, who worked for Bertha's father, they start train and bank robbery by accident, and eventually face up to the railway boss H. Buckram Sartoris in the American South. The group become notorious fugitives of the law and are hunted down by the railway company. In the process, Rake is gunned down and Bill and Von are sent to a chain gang. Bertha escapes but is lured into prostitution. She meets Von by chance in a tavern for blacks and learns that Bill broke the jail and is now in hiding. Von leads Bertha to the hiding place where she has a moment of sweet reunion with Bill before Sartoris's henchmen break in and crucify Bill. Before they can leave, Von appears, wipes out all henchmen and releases Bertha from the bondage.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n*[[Barbara Hershey]] as Boxcar Bertha\n*[[David Carradine]] as Big Bill Shelly\n*[[Barry Primus]] as Rake Brown\n*[[Bernie Casey]] as Von Morton\n*[[John Carradine]] as Sartoris\n*[[Victor Argo]] as McIver #1\n*David Osterhout as McIver #2\n\n==Production==\nAfter the success of ''[[Bloody Mama]]'', Roger Corman wanted to make another female gangster film. Julie Corman researched female gangsters and came across the story of Boxcar Bertha. Martin Scorsese was hired to direct on the strength of his first feature. He was given the lead actors, including Barbara Hershey, David Carradine, and Barry Primus, and a shooting schedule of 24 days in Arkansas.<ref name=\"chris\">Chris Nashawaty, ''Crab Monsters, Teenage Cavemen and Candy Stripe Nurses - Roger Corman: King of the B Movie'', Abrams, 2013 p 120</ref>  The [[Reader Railroad]] was used for the train scenes.\n\nThe locomotive in those scenes was 1920 [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] [[2-6-2]] #108, which later saw service on the [[Conway Scenic Railroad]] in the late 1970s. The engine is  currently at the [[Blacklands Railroad]] yard in [[Sulphur Springs, Texas|Sulphur Springs]], Texas, awaiting restoration. Locomotive #1702, a [[USATC S160]] 2-8-0 built by Baldwin in 1942, was also seen in the film as well.

Smith, ''The American International Pictures Video Guide'', McFarland 2009 p 33</ref>\n\nHershey later called the film \"a lot of fun even though it's terribly crippled by Roger Corman and the violence and sex. But between the actors and Marty Scorsese the director, we had a lot of fun. We really had characters down but one tends to not see all that, because you end up seeing all the blood and sex.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article228121471 |title=THEATRE |newspaper=[[Tharunka]] |volume=27 |issue=13 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=12 October 1981 |access-date=27 April 2017 |page=28 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n[[Barbara Hershey]] publicly announced that they filmed the movie's sex scenes \"without having to fake anything.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Barbara Hershey Drops Her Hippie Past and a Name, Seagull, and Her Career Finds Wings |work=people.com |url=https://people.com/archive/barbara-hershey-drops-her-hippie-past-and-a-name-seagull-and-her-career-finds-wings-vol-11-no-21/ |access-date=2022-01-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Boxcar Bertha'' received mixed reviews from critics.
