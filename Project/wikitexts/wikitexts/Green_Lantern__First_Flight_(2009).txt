Centering on the first mission of [[Hal Jordan]] ([[Christopher Meloni]]), the first human inducted into the [[Green Lantern Corps]], the film was written by veteran DC Comics animation collaborator [[Alan Burnett]], produced by [[Bruce Timm]] and directed by [[Lauren Montgomery]].<ref name=\"PR\"/> The fifth film of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] released by [[Warner Premiere]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]], the film was released on home media on July 28, 2009, and made its US broadcast premiere on [[Cartoon Network]] on January 16, 2010 at 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\nIt was the last film to feature [[Malachi Throne]] and [[David Lander]] before their deaths on March 13, 2013 and December 4, 2020 respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nA long time ago, the [[Guardians of the Universe]], the first race of sentient beings to ever exist, harnessed the power of the ''green element'', the greatest power imaginable, to create the [[Green Lantern]] battery. However, the battery was vulnerable to the color yellow, the one part of the light spectrum that could resist green. The Guardians hid the most concentrated source of yellow energy, the ''yellow element'', to prevent others from using it against them.\n\nAfter the death of [[Abin Sur]], several Green Lanterns arrive to take Ferris Aircraft's test pilot [[Hal Jordan]] ([[Christopher Meloni]]) to the [[Green Lantern Corps]] on Oa. He is placed under the supervision of respected senior officer [[Sinestro]] ([[Victor Garber]]), who is investigating Abin's murder. While undercover on the ship of [[Kanjar Ro]] ([[Kurtwood Smith]]) searching for the whereabouts of the stolen yellow element, Abin had come under attack. Fleeing to Earth, he had his ring find his successor and died of his injury shortly after. Unbeknownst to the other Green Lanterns, Sinestro had provided Kanjar with the location of the element in order to have it fashioned into a weapon of comparable power to the Green Lantern battery.\n\nJordan quickly comes to understand that Sinestro's beliefs are not in line with those of the Guardians: Sinestro believes that the Guardians have reduced the Corps to merely picking up the messes criminals create as opposed to proactively dealing with the problem. During a mission to capture Kanjar Ro, Jordan is knocked unconscious by Kanjar's energy staff. Sinestro comes in and kills Kanjar, pinning the blame on Jordan. As punishment, the Guardians strip Jordan of his ring.\n\nWhile Jordan waits to be taken home, Sinestro uses his ring to temporarily animate Kanjar's corpse, allowing him to learn the location of [[Qward]] where the yellow element weapon is being fashioned. Jordan convinces fellow Lanterns [[Boodikka]] ([[Tricia Helfer]]) and [[Kilowog]] ([[Michael Madsen]]) that Sinestro is not what he seems. When they catch Sinestro enacting his plot, Boodikka reveals her true allegiance and incapacitates Kilowog, allowing Sinestro to escape. Jordan tricks her into destroying Kanjar's unstable energy staff, the explosion launching her into the tools hanging from the ceiling and killing her.\n\nOn Qward, the Weaponers bestow Sinestro with the yellow ring and battery, the latter of which resembles [[List of locations of the DC Universe#Extraterrestrial sites|Ranx the Sentient City]]. Using its power, he lays waste to Oa, the yellow light easily overpowering the Green Lantern rings. The yellow battery destroys the green battery, rendering all the Green Lantern Corps' power rings inert and causing death by asphyxiation of countless Green Lanterns who were in space at the time of their rings' failure. Jordan, having recovered his ring moments too late, finds the battery and pounds on the inert green element. He places his ring on the small crack that appears, absorbing the whole of its power. Imbued with the full might of the green energy, he destroys the yellow battery by crushing it between two moons.\n\nHaving exhausted most of the green power to destroy the yellow battery, Jordan is left to fight against Sinestro under his own power. After an intense hand-to-hand battle without constructs, Jordan uses the last of his power to knock Sinestro to the surface of Oa where Kilowog crushes the yellow ring (as well as Sinestro's hand) with his foot. Having regained partial power to his ring earlier, Kilowog takes to the air and saves Jordan from a fatal fall to the planet's surface.\n\nOnce Oa is rebuilt and the Green Lantern battery restored, the Guardians give the privilege of leading the Corps in reciting the [[Green Lantern#Green Lantern Oath|Green Lantern oath]] to Jordan. Jordan then leaves for Earth to check in with his other boss, [[Carol Ferris]] ([[Olivia d'Abo]]), remarking on the long \"[[Commuting|commute]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as [[Hal Jordan|Hal Jordan / Green Lantern]]\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Sinestro]]\n* [[Tricia Helfer]] as [[Boodikka]]\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as [[Kilowog]]\n* [[John Larroquette]] as [[Tomar-Re|Tomar Re]]\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as [[Kanjar Ro]]\n* [[Larry Drake]] as [[Ganthet]]\n* [[William Schallert]] as [[Guardians of the Universe|Appa Ali Apsa]]\n* [[Malachi Throne]] as Ranakar\n* [[Olivia d'Abo]] as [[Carol Ferris]]\n* [[Richard Green (actor)|Richard Green]] as Cuch\n* [[Juliet Landau]] as Labella\n* [[David Lander]] as [[Ch'p]]\n* [[Richard McGonagle]] as [[Abin Sur]]\n* [[Rob Paulsen]] as Weaponers of Qward\n* [[Kath Soucie]] as [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]]\n* [[Jim Wise]] as Lieutenant\n* [[Bruce Timm]] as Bug Boy\n\n==Production==\nAccording to director Montgomery, Jordan's origin story was previously covered in the ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' film: \"...we really didn't want to spend a whole lot of time telling that same story over again.
