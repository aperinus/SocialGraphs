Hyaku-Oku Paw\u0101 no Senshi-tachi|lead=yes}} or by [[Toei Animation|Toei]]'s own English title '''''Dragon Ball Z: Fight! 10 Billion Power Warriors''''', is a 1992 Japanese [[anime]] [[science fiction]] [[martial arts film]], the sixth ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' film, originally released in [[Japan]] on March 7 at the Toei Anime Fair along with the second ''[[Dragon Quest: Dai no Daib\u014dken]]'' film and the third ''[[Magical Tarur\u016bto-kun]]'' film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nThe Namekian people, now living on a new planet after their home world was destroyed by [[Frieza]] years prior, find New Namek under siege by a mysterious, [[sentient]] spaceship that has latched onto and began attacking their home. [[Dende (Dragon Ball)|Dende]], now the Earth's guardian, senses the plight of his people and [[telepathically]] calls on [[Goku]] for help.\n\nGoku, [[Gohan]], [[Krillin]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], [[Oolong (Dragon Ball)|Oolong]], [[Yajirobe]] and [[Master Roshi]] travel to the New Namek and upon arrival encounter an army of large robots abusing the Namekians. They learn that [[Cooler (Dragon Ball)|Cooler]], who Goku was thought to have [[Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge|killed]], is responsible. Cooler, now with a metallic body, reveals that he is going to absorb the planet and its lifeforms to power his ship. Goku fights Cooler while the others battle his robots who have durable armor that they struggle to penetrate. All except Piccolo are captured along with a village of Namekians. Piccolo manages to destroys all of the robots in one large [[qi|energy]] attack before making his way to rescue those who were captured. Elsewhere, Goku struggles against Cooler's new \"Meta-Cooler\" form which gives him the ability to regenerate himself. Cooler also reveals his ability to use the [[teleportation|instantaneous movement]] technique, an ability which Goku also uses. Cooler explains that his ship constantly monitors his body, and fixes any damage it might incur and improves his design to increase his durability. Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan which is also ineffective against Meta-Cooler, and just before he is strangled to death, [[Vegeta]] saves him. The two Super Saiyans attack Meta-Cooler together and they manage to destroy him. However, his ship recreates one thousand manifestations of Meta-Cooler, tipping the balance of power decisively against the Saiyans. Goku and Vegeta attempt one final defense but are captured and transported to be converted into fuel.\n\nAs his ship is leeching their energy, Cooler explains that after his defeat, his brain was absorbed by the remnants of a spacecraft's computer system and fused together; which he eventually took control of. Goku and Vegeta begin to release all their energy which overloads the system. They encounter the true biological Cooler, who Goku manages to kill with an energy blast. Piccolo arrives and encounters a Meta-Cooler which explodes. All of the Meta-Coolers and robot soldiers subsequently explode and the heroes escape before the ship leaves New Namek's orbit and explodes.\n\nGoku and Vegeta fall from the sky near their allies and everyone rejoices in the victory. In his spaceship, Vegeta crushes the computer chip that created Cooler's ship.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese\n! colspan=\"3\" |English\n|-\n! <small>Audio Captain Productions/Creative Products Corp.
