The film stars [[Martin Sheen]] and [[Sissy Spacek]], and follows Holly Sargis (Spacek), a 15-year old who goes on a [[killing spree]] with her partner, Kit Carruther (Sheen); the film also stars [[Warren Oates]] and [[Ramon Bieri]]. While the story is fictional, it is loosely based on the real-life murder spree of [[Charles Starkweather]] and his girlfriend, [[Caril Ann Fugate]], in 1958.<ref name=\"nyt73canby\"/>\n\n''Badlands'' was released in 1973 to positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised its cinematography, soundtrack\u2014which includes pieces by [[Carl Orff]]\u2014and the lead performances. At the [[49th British Academy Film Awards]], Spacek was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles|Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles]] award; at the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]], Sheen won the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|Best Actor]] award.\n\n''Badlands'' was selected for preservation by the [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" <ref name=\"1993Add\">{{cite web|title=U.S. National Film Registry \u2013 Titles|publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science]]|url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/Unofficial/Movies/NFR-Titles.html#1993 | work=Clamen's Movie Information Collection| access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian Announces National Film Registry Selections (March 7, 1994) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/94/9405/film.html|access-date=2020-09-16|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-16|website=Library of Congress}}</ref> by the [[Library of Congress]] in 1993.\n\n==Plot==\nHolly Sargis narrates the film as a 15-year-old living in [[Dupree, South Dakota|Fort Dupree]], a dead-end [[South Dakota]] town. She has a strained relationship with her father, a sign painter, since her mother's death from [[pneumonia]] years earlier. Holly meets Kit Carruthers, a 25-year-old garbage collector, troubled [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]] and [[Korean War]] veteran. He resembles [[James Dean]], an actor whom Holly admires. After Kit charms Holly, he takes her virginity. As they become closer, his violent and antisocial tendencies are gradually revealed.\n\nHolly's father disapproves of Kit and kills her dog as punishment for spending time with him. Kit breaks into Holly's house and insists she run away with him. When her father protests and threatens to call the police, Kit shoots him dead. After Kit and Holly fake suicide by burning down the house, they head for the [[badlands]] of [[Montana]]. They build a treehouse in a remote area and live there, fishing and stealing chickens for food. They flee after being found by three men (who Kit later tells Holly were [[bounty hunters]]) whom Kit shoots dead. They seek refuge with Kit's former co-worker Cato, but when he attempts to summon help, Kit shoots him too. Kit forces a young couple who arrive to visit Cato into a storm cellar. He shoots into the closed cellar door and leaves without checking to see if they are dead.\n\nKit and Holly are pursued across the Midwest by law enforcement. They stop at a rich man's mansion and take supplies, clothing, and his [[Cadillac]], sparing the lives of the man and his deaf housemaid. As they drive across Montana to [[Saskatchewan]], the police find and chase them.\n\nHolly, who has grown tired of life on the run and Kit, refuses to go with him and turns herself in. Kit leads the police on a car chase but is soon caught. He charms the arresting officers and [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] troops, tossing them his personal belongings as souvenirs of his crime spree. Holly reveals at the end that she received probation and married her defense attorney's son, and Kit was executed for his crimes.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing credits order, with roles as credited --->\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Kit Carruthers\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Holly Sargis\n* [[Warren Oates]] as Father\n* [[Ramon Bieri]] as Cato\n* [[Alan Vint]] as Deputy\n* Gary Littlejohn as Sheriff\n* [[John Carter (actor)|John Carter]] as Rich Man\n* [[Bryan Montgomery]] as Boy\n* Gail Threlkeld as Girl\n* Charley Fitzpatrick as Clerk\n* Howard Ragsdale as Boss\n* John Womack, Jr. as Trooper\n* Dona Baldwin as Maid\n* Ben Bravo as Gas Attendant\n{{div col end}}\n\nDirector [[Terrence Malick]] makes a cameo as the man at the Rich Man's door, while the sons of lead actor Sheen, [[Charlie Sheen|Charlie]] and [[Emilio Estevez]], appear as two boys sitting under a lamppost outside Holly's house.\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Writing and casting ===\n[[File:Martin Sheen 1987.jpg|thumb|Sheen was chosen for the role of Kit Carruther, based on his immediate chemistry with co-star Spacek.]]\nMalick, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Arthur Penn]] (whom he thanked in the film's end credits),<ref name=\"time73jay\">{{cite news| first= Jay |last= Cocks| author-link= Jay Cocks| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,908554,00.html | archive-url= https://archive.today/20130204083736/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,908554,00.html | url-status= dead | archive-date= February 4, 2013 | magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=April 8, 1974 | title= Gun Crazy|access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref> began work on ''Badlands'' after his second year attending the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name=\"Walker\">{{cite news|last=Walker |first=Beverly |title=Malick on Badlands |magazine=[[Sight and Sound]] |date=Spring 1973 |url=http://www.eskimo.com/~toates/malick/art6.html |access-date=September 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014130814/http://www.eskimo.com/~toates/malick/art6.html |archive-date=October 14, 2008|url-status=live }}</ref> In 1970, Malick, at age 27, began working on the screenplay during a road trip.<ref name=\"Gilbey\">{{cite news|first=Ryan|last=Gilbey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/22/drama|title=The start of something beautiful|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 21, 2008|access-date=November 13, 2013}}</ref> \"I wrote and, at the same time, developed a kind of sales kit with slides and video tape of actors, all with a view to presenting investors with something that would look ready to shoot,\" Malick said. \"To my surprise, they didn't pay too much attention to it; they invested on faith.

''Badlands'' was the first feature film that Malick had written for himself to direct.<ref name=\"Gilbey\" />\n\nSissy Spacek, in only her second film, was the first actor cast. Malick found her small-town Texas roots and accent were perfect for the part of the naive impressionable high school girl.

There's this wonderful sequence where the couple have been cut adrift from civilisation. They know the noose is tightening and they've gone off the road, across the Badlands. You hear Sissy narrating various stories, and she's talking about visiting faraway places. There's this strange piece of classical music [an ethereal orchestration of [[Erik Satie]]'s ''Trois Morceaux en forme de Poire],'' and a very long-lens shot. You see something in the distance \u2013 I think it's a train moving \u2013 and it looks like a shot of an Arabian caravan moving across the desert.  These are moments that have nothing to do with the story, and yet everything to do with it. They're not plot-orientated, but they have to do with the longing or the dreams of these characters.
