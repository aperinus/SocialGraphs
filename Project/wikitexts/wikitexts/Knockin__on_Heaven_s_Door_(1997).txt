They start talking about their death that is to come very soon. When they find a bottle of [[tequila]], Martin finds out that Rudi has never seen the sea. Martin tells Rudi that all they talk about in [[Heaven]] is how beautiful the sea is.\n\nDrunk and still in their pajamas, they steal a [[baby blue]] [[Mercedes-Benz W113]] classic roadster and go for their last mission - to see the sea. The car belongs to a crime boss. They rob several small shops, only to find that there is a million deutsche marks in cash in the trunk of their car.\n\nAs they progress closer to their goal, police along with gangsters start the hot pursuit. Eventually, the two friends find themselves trapped in the middle of a countryside road by police units on one side and gangsters on the other, pointing their guns at each other. The stand-off finally erupts into a big shoot-out while the two make a desperate escape through the corn field. After that, Martin buys a pink Cadillac of the same model as the one which [[Elvis Presley]] presented to his mother. His wish is to give the same present to his own mother. As he fulfills the wish, they get ambushed by police near Martin's mother's house. Martin pretends to have a seizure and falls on the ground. He is taken to the hospital in an ambulance with Rudi sitting by his side. En route, Martin and Rudi hijack the vehicle to continue their quest. On the way to the ocean they stop by a brothel, where Rudi wants to fulfil his wish to have sex with two women at the same time. By coincidence, the brothel is owned by the boss whose money they had found in the car they have stolen at the beginning of the journey. They are seen by the two gangsters who were after them throughout their journey. The gangsters take Rudi and Martin to their boss who asks them for money they should return.  Martin says that the money was spent and sent to various people which drives the criminal boss insane. Enraged, the boss points a gun at them ready to shoot, but Curtiz, the most influential criminal to whom the money was meant to be delivered, comes in. After a short talk he says \u201cThen you better run, before you run out of time\u201d. The capo goes on talking about that in heaven everybody would be talking about the ocean. Curtiz spares their lives and lets them go.\n\nThe film ends as Martin and Rudi arrive at the ocean's shore. They walk to the sandy beach and Martin falls dead on the ground. Rudi imperturbably sits down beside his friend, facing the ocean and watching the surf.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Til Schweiger]] as Martin Brest\n* [[Jan Josef Liefers]] as Rudi Wurlitzer\n* [[Thierry Van Werveke]] as Henk, The Belgian\n* [[Moritz Bleibtreu]] as Abdul, The Turk\n* [[Huub Stapel]] as Frankie \"Boy\" Beluga\n* [[Leonard Lansink]] as Kommissar Schneider\n* Ralph Herforth as Assistant Keller\n* [[Cornelia Froboess]] as Frau Brest, Martin's Mother\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as Curtiz\n* [[Christiane Paul]] as Shop Assistant In A Boutique\n* [[Xenia Seeberg]] as Policewoman\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film opened on 522 screens in Germany and opened at number one at the box office with a gross of $3,035,034 for the four-day weekend.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Germany Top 15|magazine=[[Screen International]]|date=28 February 1997|page=31|quote=$1=DM1.67}}</ref> It was the fifth highest-grossing film of the year in Germany (and the highest-grossing German film) with a gross of $21,288,865.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 12, 1998|page=22|title=EDI Box Office News: Top German Hits For 1997}}</ref> Worldwide, it grossed $23.8 million.<ref name=ww/>\n\n== Remake ==\nA Japanese [[remake]] was announced to be released in February 2009 under the title ''[[Heaven's Door (2009 film)|Heaven's Door]]''<ref>{{cite web |url= http://h-door.jp/ |title= Japanese remake website |access-date= 2008-11-01 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090306075827/http://h-door.jp/ |archive-date= 2009-03-06 |url-status= dead }}</ref> (directed by [[Michael Arias]] and with music by [[Plaid (band)|Plaid]]).
