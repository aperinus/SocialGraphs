It stars [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], with a supporting cast of [[Natalie J. Robb]], [[Stephen Lord]], [[Gary McDonald (actor)|Gary McDonald]], [[Scott Adkins]] and Van Damme's real life daughter [[Jean-Claude Van Damme#Personal life|Bianca Van Varenberg]]. The film was released on [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] in the United States on March 4, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nA former New Orleans cop Jack Robideaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) arrives with his pet rabbit in [[Columbus, New Mexico]] to take a job with the [[United States Border Patrol|border patrol]], and working with Captain Ramona Garc\u00eda (Natalie J. Robb).\n\nAt the moment, the border patrol is up against a highly dangerous drug smuggling operation, in which the smugglers are funneling illegal immigrants and bricks of [[heroin]] through the porous defenses of the Mexico US border. Migrants are randomly outfitted with [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] vests, so any border patrol agent who interferes might get blown up.\n\nAs it turns out, the smugglers are a rogue special forces unit led by Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord) and his right-hand man Karp (Scott Adkins), who have taken over all of the smuggling operations in the area by killing major drug kingpins F\u00e9lix N\u00e9stor (Daniel Perrone) and Benito Ortiz (Luis Algar).\n\nJack and his partner Billy Pawnell (Gary McDonald) have their work cut out for them in trying to bring down Meyers and his operation. Myers and his henchmen take over and rig a missionary bus to smuggle [[drug]]s, but Jack and Billy pursue them across the border, out of their jurisdiction, where Jack is arrested by the local police, who are working for Meyers.\n\nOnce Jack is transferred from a Mexican jail to Meyers's compound, it turns out Billy is working for Meyers, who has also kidnapped Ramona and her uncle Emile (Dan Davies). Meyers kills Emile by throwing him into a pool of water charged by live wires.\n\nIt turns out that Jack has a personal reason for going after Meyers, as Meyers's drugs killed Jack's daughter, Kassie ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme#Personal life|Bianca Van Varenberg]]) about three months ago. Kassie was 16 years old. Jack's pet rabbit was originally Kassie's rabbit, and he carries it around in memory of Kassie. He also swore on her grave to take down whatever drug operation he could find.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack and Ramona manage to free themselves and kill Billy. Ramona calls for help from Mexican police, and she and Jack start fighting their way through Meyers's men. Ramona goes to find an escape vehicle, but is knocked out in a car crash.\n\nNext, Jack is confronted by Karp, who is a martial arts expert. They fight, and Karp brutally kicks Jack in the head, effectively slowing him down. Jack, however, manages to overpower Karp and beats him to death. Meyers, whose potential investors have abandoned him, confronts Jack and is about to shoot him when Jack throws an explosive collar toward Meyers and detonates it. In the ending scene, Ramona advises Jack to go back to New Orleans with his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Detective Jack Robideaux\n* [[Stephen Lord]] as Benjamin Meyers\n* [[Natalie J.
