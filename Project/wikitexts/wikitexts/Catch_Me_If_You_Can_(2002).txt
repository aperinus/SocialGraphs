[[David Fincher]], [[Gore Verbinski]], [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]], [[Milo\u0161 Forman]], and [[Cameron Crowe]] were all considered to direct the film before Spielberg decided to direct it himself. Filming took place from February to May 2002.\n\nThe film opened on December 25, 2002, to critical and commercial success. At the [[75th Academy Awards]], [[Christopher Walken]] and [[John Williams]] were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]],<ref name=\"74th Academy Awards\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/2003 |title=74th Academy Awards |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date=July 3, 2008 |archive-date=December 25, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225090246/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/2003 |url-status=live }}</ref> respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please do not expand the plot summary any further. Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. It already exceeds that.-->\nIn 1963,  [[Frank William Abagnale Jr.]] lives in [[New Rochelle, New York]] with his father Frank Abagnale Sr. and his French mother Paula. During his youth, he witnesses his father's many techniques for conning people. Because of Frank Sr.'s tax problems with the [[Internal Revenue Service]], the family is forced to move from their large home to a small apartment.\n\nOne day, Frank discovers that his mother is having an affair with his father's friend Jack Barnes at the [[Rotary Club]] of New Rochelle. When his parents divorce, Frank runs away. Needing money, he turns to [[Confidence trick|confidence scams]] to survive, and his cons grow bolder. He impersonates a [[Pan Am]] pilot and forges the airline's payroll checks. Soon, his forgeries are worth millions of dollars.\n\nNews of the crimes reaches the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and Agent Carl Hanratty begins tracking Frank. Carl finds him at a hotel, but Frank tricks Carl into believing he is a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent named [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. He escapes before Carl realizes that he was fooled.\n\nFrank begins to impersonate a doctor. As Dr. Frank Conners, he falls in love with Brenda, a naive young hospital worker. He asks her attorney father for her [[Marriage proposal|hand in marriage]] and also for help with arranging to take the [[Louisiana State Bar Association|Louisiana State Bar]] exam, which Frank passes. Carl tracks Frank to his and Brenda's engagement party, but Frank escapes through a bedroom window, telling Brenda to meet him at [[Miami International Airport]] two days later. \n\nAt the airport, Frank spots Brenda, but also plainclothes agents. He realizes she has given him up, then drives away. Re-assuming his pilot identity, he stages a false recruiting drive for stewardesses at a local college. Surrounded by eight women as stewardesses, he conceals himself from Carl and the other agents at the airport and escapes on a flight to [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]], Spain.\n\nIn 1967, Carl tracks down Frank in his mother's hometown of [[Montrichard]], France. He is incarcerated in a French prison in [[Marseille]], where he becomes very ill due to its poor conditions. Carl takes Frank on a flight back to the United States. As they approach, the FBI agent informs him that his father has died. Grief-stricken, Frank escapes from the plane and reaches the house of his mother, who is now married to Barnes and has a daughter. Frank surrenders to Carl and is sentenced to 12 years in a maximum-security prison.\n\nCarl occasionally visits Frank. During one visit, he shows him a fraud check from a case he is working on. Frank immediately figures out that the [[bank teller]] was involved in the fraud. Impressed, Carl convinces the FBI to allow him to serve the remainder of his sentence working for the FBI Financial Crimes Unit. Frank agrees but soon grows restless of the tedious office work.\n\nOne weekend, Frank prepares to impersonate a pilot again and is intercepted by Carl, who allows him to carry on his act, assuring him that no one is chasing him. As Frank returns to work and discusses another fraud case with Carl, the post-script says Frank has lived for 26 years in the [[Midwestern United States]] with his wife, with whom he has had three sons, remains friends with Carl, and has built a successful living as one of the world's leading experts on bank fraud and forgery.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:08catchme.jpg|right|thumb|Leonardo DiCaprio and the real [[Frank Abagnale Jr.]]]]\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Frank Abagnale]], a teenager who turned into a con artist and later the FBI\u2019s Bank Fraud Consultant in the Financial Crimes Unit.\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Carl Hanratty, an FBI Agent who is based on [[Joseph Shea (FBI agent)|Joseph Shea]].\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Frank Abagnale Sr., the father of Frank Abagnale.\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Roger Strong, an attorney.\n* [[Nathalie Baye]] as Paula Abagnale, the French mother of Frank.\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Brenda Strong, a young hospital worker (\"[[Hospital volunteer|candy striper]]\") and the daughter of Roger.\n* [[James Brolin]] as Jack Barnes, the friend of Frank Abagnale Sr. who had an affair with Paula.\n* [[Nancy Lenehan]] as Carol Strong, the mother of Brenda.\n* [[Candice Azzara]] as Darcy\n* [[Malachi Throne]] as Abe Penner\n* [[Alfred Dennis (actor)|Alfred Dennis]] as Ira Penner\n* [[Amy Acker]] as Miggy Acker, one of the eight women that Frank recruits to be his stewardesses.\n* [[Guy Thauvette]] as Warden Garren, the [[prison warden]] of the unnamed [[Marseille]] prison.\n* Maggie Mellin as the unnamed French teacher who Frank impersonates.\n* [[Thomas Kopache]] as Principal Evans, the principal of Frank's school who busts him for impersonating a substitute teacher.\n* [[James Morrison (actor)|James Morrison]] as Pilot\n* [[Robert Symonds]] as Mr. Rosen\n* Dave Hager as Judge\n* [[Jasmine Jessica Anthony]] as the unnamed daughter of Paula and Jack\n\n[[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]], [[Frank John Hughes]] and [[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]] portray FBI agents Earl Amdursky, Tom Fox, and Special Agent Witkins, respectively.

So when the media asked me what I thought about the movie, and what was right and what was wrong, I said: First of all I have two brothers and a sister; he portrayed me as an only child. In real life, my mother never remarried; there's a scene in the movie where she's remarried, and has a little girl. That didn't really happen. In real life I never saw my father after I ran away; in the movie they keep having him come back to Christopher Walken in the film. That didn't really happen. ... I escaped off the aircraft through the kitchen galley where they bring the food and stuff onto the plane; and there they had me escape through the toilet. ... I thought he stayed very close to the story, but pretty much all of that. He was very concerned about being accurate, first of all because it was the first time he made a movie about a real person living. Second the Bureau had an information officer on the set for all the shooting of the entire film to make sure that what he said about the FBI ... was accurate. ... And then of course, as he later said, 'I really got most of my information from those three retired agents.' ...
