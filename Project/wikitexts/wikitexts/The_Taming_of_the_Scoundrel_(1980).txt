One stormy night, however, a beautiful young lady named Lisa is forced to stop at his farmstead because her car has broken down while she was on her way to her fianc\u00e9. Intrigued by Elia's personality, she decides to stay and make the grumpy farmer come out of his rough shell, an intention which in time develops into genuine affection.\n\nElia is not unresponsive to Lisa's advances (the heat stirred by which he tries to alleviate by splitting logs of wood), but he maintains his rough exterior and tries his best to get rid of her, to the point that he once even [[tractor]]-drags her bed, with Lisa inside, out of the guestroom into the midst of the nearby village after she attempts to extend her stay by claiming that her ankle is [[sprain]]ed. Eventually, Lisa leaves in disgust, but so does Mamie, who has developed a genuine liking to Lisa. Also, as soon as she is gone, Elia realizes too late that he has also fallen in love with Lisa.\n\nEventually, in order to win her back, Elia attends a [[basketball]] match between a team from his own village and the team sponsored by Lisa's fianc\u00e9. With his native team on the verge of losing the game, Elia enters the field and employs his skills to tip the scores to their benefit. Following the successful conclusion of the match, he asks for Lisa's hand, but she refuses to do so unless he has publicly declared his love for her. Using the playing hall's loudspeaker system, Elia does so at full volume; the two get married, and Elia unloads his years of penned-back sexuality in a manner which leaves the house (quite literally) [[Earthquake|aquake]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adriano Celentano]] as Elia Codogno\n* [[Ornella Muti]] as Lisa Silvestri\n* [[Edith Peters]] as Mamie\n* [[Pippo Santonastaso]] as Don Cirillo\n* [[Milly Carlucci]] as Renata\n* [[Marco Columbro]] as the chauffeur\n* [[Sandro Ghiani]] as the gas station attendant\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Il Bisbetico Domato'' was the top grossing film on the Italian market for the season 1980/1981,<ref>{{cite book|title=Mass media: rivista bimestrale della comunicazione, Volume 3|publisher=Capone, 1984}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=University of Notre Dame|title=Annali d'italianistica , Volume 17|publisher=Annali D'Italianistica, 1999}}</ref> earning about 17 billion [[Lira|lire]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Peter Cowie|title=International Film Guide|year=1982|publisher=Tantivy Press, 1983|isbn=0900730005}}</ref> The film was released in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1983, selling {{nowrap|56 million}} tickets in the country.
