She meets other tenants including Zeke, a [[video game design]]er; Jack, a [[novelist]]; Vida, a fashion model who moonlights as a [[call girl]]; and Gus, a professor of [[videography]] at [[New York University]]. They tell Carly that she bears a striking resemblance to Naomi Singer, the previous tenant of her apartment who fell to her death from her balcony.\n\nAfter running into Zeke numerous times, Carly invites him to her [[housewarming party]]. Soon after they begin a sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Jack starts stalking Carly and warning her about Zeke who he says is \"sick\". As Jack's behavior becomes more erratic, Gus dies under suspicious circumstances and Vida is murdered by Jack. Zeke reveals to Carly that he is the owner of 113, which he bought with the inheritance of his wealthy father. As owner of 113, Zeke installed a comprehensive [[Video Surveillance|video surveillance]] system throughout the building, allowing him to spy on all of the tenants of 113 from his own secret surveillance room. Through deduction and eventually one of Zeke's secret recordings, Carly learns that Jack killed Naomi in a crime of passion. Jack was jealous of Zeke, who had sexual relations with Naomi and Vida. Finally, Jack attacks Carly in her own apartment, and she shoots him dead.\n\nAngry at Zeke for withholding evidence in Naomi's murder, and jealous of his liaisons with Naomi and Vida, Carly destroys Zeke's surveillance room, tells him to \"get a life\", then leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Carly Norris\n* [[William Baldwin]] as Zeke Hawkins\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Jack Landsford\n* [[Polly Walker]] as Vida Warren\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Judy Marks\n* [[Amanda Foreman (actress)|Amanda Foreman]] as Samantha Moore\n* [[Martin Landau]] as Alex Parsons\n* [[Nicholas Pryor]] as Peter Farrell\n* [[C.
