It is a fantasized account of the life of [[Albert Einstein]] which alters all people, places and circumstances of his life, including relocating the [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] to Australia, having him splitting the atom with a chisel, and inventing [[rock and roll]] and [[surfing]].\n\nAlthough highly successful in Australia, and winning an award from the [[Australian Film Institute Awards]], it was poorly received by critics in the United States.\n\nAt the [[APRA Music Awards of 1990]], the soundtrack won Most Performed Australasian Work for Film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apraamcos.com.au/awards/1990-1999/1991-music-awards/|title= 1990 APRA MUSIC AWARD WINNERS|publisher=APRA AMCOs|access-date=5 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Albert Einstein]], the son of an apple farmer in [[Tasmania]] in the early 1900s, is interested in physics rather than the family business. His father shows him his grandfather's \"laboratory\", a remote shed where he made beer. His father tells him that they have tried for years to introduce bubbles to beer, saying that the person who can will change the world forever.\n\nAfter heavy drinking, Einstein postulates the theory of [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] (E=MC<sup>2</sup>) as a formula to split beer atoms to create bubbles in beer. After spending all night preparing, he splits a beer atom (with hammer and chisel), which causes the shed to explode. After Einstein excitedly shows his parents the formula and a glass of beer with bubbles in it, his father encourages him to head to the Australian mainland and patent the formula. On a train to Sydney, he meets [[Marie Curie]], a Polish-French scientist studying at the University of Sydney, and Preston Preston, the pompous manager of the Sydney Patent Office. Marie is fascinated by Einstein, while Preston is annoyed by him.\n\nIn Sydney, Einstein lodges in a whorehouse and finds that the patent office will not accept scientific theories. Einstein leaves and meets Marie at the university, only to upset her professor by erasing his work and writing his own theory. Though he is thrown out, Marie becomes more taken with him. Preston attempts to woo Marie with his upper-class lifestyle. During a performance at a social club, she mentions her interest in Einstein's theory. Jealous, Preston has his clerk call Einstein in to take his formula for safe keeping. Preston turns the formula over to the Bavarian Brothers, a pair of brewmasters who intend to use the formula to get rich.\n\nAs Einstein invents [[rock and roll]] and the [[electric violin]], he begins a romance with Marie. While at a beach, he demonstrates surfing for her. As they leave, Marie wishes the moment could last forever. Inspired, Einstein comes up with the [[theory of relativity]] on the spot, amazing Marie. As they return to the hotel, the clerk tells him that Preston is creating a keg using his formula. When Einstein protests, the Bavarian Brothers claim that Einstein is insane and have him committed. Einstein's electric violin is destroyed, and he is kept isolated. Marie confronts Preston, who says Einstein would have done nothing with his work and he is trying to help people.\n\nMarie infiltrates the institution as Einstein's father, confronts Einstein in the shower room, and reveals Preston's plot. When Einstein expresses helplessness, Marie leaves disappointed. Einstein rebuilds his violin into an [[electric guitar]], uses it to short out the security system, and escapes. Upon finding she has returned to France, Einstein sails a small steamboat to France and wins her back by promising to stop Preston. They use the Curie family hot air balloon and head to the Nobel ceremony in [[Paris]] that night, attended by many inventors and scientific luminaries.\n\n[[Charles Darwin]] announces Preston is the winner of this year's [[Nobel Prize]] for his beer bubble discovery. Einstein interrupts Preston's speech and questions if Preston knows what happens when an atom is split. When Darwin realizes that Preston has unknowingly built an atomic bomb, he orders Preston to stop. Preston scoffs at the warning and starts the keg, which starts shaking and building up pressure. Einstein attaches his guitar to the keg to drain it despite Marie's warning that this will kill him. Einstein plays a guitar riff, which causes the keg to lose power. Preston attempts to kill Einstein, but Marie knocks him unconscious. Einstein radiates pure energy, which causes a massive feedback, then an explosion.\n\nAs the smoke clears, Einstein is revealed to be unharmed. He and Marie kiss as the assembled crowd cheers. He returns to Tasmania with the keg and the Nobel Prize. He tells his family that he will give his formula to the world instead of keeping it for personal gain. Marie questions what will happen if governments use that formula to create atomic weapons. Einstein naively expresses his trust in the governments of the world, announces he has learned a new theory, and then plays a rock and roll song.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Yahoo Serious]] as [[Albert Einstein]]\n*[[Odile Le Clezio]] as [[Marie Curie]]\n*[[John Howard (Australian actor)|John Howard]] as Preston Preston\n*[[The Delltones|Ian \"Peewee\" Wilson]] as Mr. Einstein\n*[[Su Cruickshank]] as Mrs. Einstein\n*[[Lulu Pinkus]] as The Blonde\n*[[Kaarin Fairfax]] as The Brunette\n*[[Jonathan Coleman (presenter)|Jonathan Coleman]] as Wolfgang Bavarian\n*[[Basil Clarke (actor)|Basil Clarke]] as [[Charles Darwin]]\n*[[Steve Abbott (comedian)|Steve Abbott]] as Brian Asprin\n\n==Production==\nSerious first became interested in [[Albert Einstein]] when he was travelling down the [[Amazon River]] and saw a local wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a physicist on it.<ref name=yahoowhoisserious/> The image was that of Einstein [[Albert Einstein in popular culture|sticking out his tongue]], taken by photographer [[Arthur Sasse]].<ref name=relative>{{cite news|title=Theoretically, it's relative|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yWEeAAAAIBAJ&pg=3053,1243557&dq=young-einstein+film&hl=en|access-date=23 February 2012|newspaper=Times Daily|date=8 August 1989}}</ref>\n\nOn returning from the Amazon, Serious adapted a previous screenplay called ''The Great Galute'' which he had written with [[David Roach (screenwriter)|David Roach]].

Roadshow bought out Film Accord in March 1987, persuaded Warner Bros. to take on the film for international distribution outside Australia, and financed re-shooting, re-editing and re-scoring, resulting in an hour of new material which included a new ending and new music score which included the addition of songs by artists such as [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] and [[Mental As Anything]]. This pushed the budget of the film up to $5 million.
