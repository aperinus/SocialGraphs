It is a [[sequel]] to ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', also directed and co-written by Hooper. The film was written by [[L. M. Kit Carson]] and produced by Carson, [[Yoram Globus]], [[Menahem Golan]] and Hooper. Starring [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Caroline Williams]], [[Bill Johnson (film and television actor)|Bill Johnson]], [[Bill Moseley]], and [[Jim Siedow]], the plot follows a radio host victimized and captured by [[Leatherface]] and his cannibalistic family, while a former Texas Marshal hunts them down.\n\nDuring its theatrical release, the film grossed $8 million domestically against its $4.5 million budget and became popular on [[home video]]. The sequel received a mixed reception from critics and audiences alike. Positives and negatives referred to its emphasis on black comedy and gore, which departed from the first film's approach that used minimal gore, low-budget [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9|v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] style and atmosphere to build tension and fear. Director Tobe Hooper decided to focus on its black comedy as this was present in the first film, but was unacknowledged by viewers because of its gritty content. Despite the mixed reception, the film eventually gained a [[cult following]]. It was followed by ''[[Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III]]'' in 1990.\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo high school seniors, Buzz and Rick, race along a desolate stretch of [[Texas]] highway, en route to the [[Red River Showdown|Texas-OU football game]] at the Dallas Cotton Bowl and harass a pickup truck along the way. Heavily intoxicated, they use their car phone to call and harass on-air radio DJ Vanita \"Stretch\" Brock. Unable to convince them to hang up, Stretch is forced to keep the line open. As the two pass the same pickup truck, [[Leatherface]] emerges from the back of the truck and rips up the roof using his chainsaw. Rick tries shooting Leatherface with his revolver, but Leatherface kills Buzz. The car crashes, killing Rick.\n\nThe following morning, Lieutenant Boude \"Lefty\" Enright, former Texas Ranger, and uncle of [[Sally Hardesty|Sally]] and Franklin Hardesty, who were victims of Leatherface and his family years earlier, arrives at the scene of the crime to help solve Buzz and Rick's murders. Lefty has spent the last thirteen years looking into his nephew's disappearance, investigating reports of mysterious chainsaw killings across Texas. He is contacted by Stretch, who brings him a copy of the audio tape that recorded the attack. He sends her away, leaving Stretch and L.G. to reluctantly get radio coverage of a Texas/Oklahoma Chili Cookoff. The winner happens to be [[Drayton Sawyer]] (current patriarch of the cannibalistic Sawyer family), who declares that his secret is having an eye for \"prime meat.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lefty shops for an arsenal of chainsaws at a local hardware store. He at first unnerves, then amuses the shop's owner with his brutal testing of the saws on a log. Lefty then drives to Stretch's radio station and asks her to play the tape on her nightly radio show so that the public, which had previously mocked his case, will have to listen to him.\n\nDrayton, driving home from his chili cookoff victory, demands that his family go to the radio station, prompted by the nightly radio broadcast of the tape. While preparing to leave for the night, Stretch is confronted by [[Chop Top|Bobby \"Chop Top\" Sawyer]] before being attacked by Leatherface. Her coworker L.G. Peters is apparently killed by Chop Top. Leatherface corners Stretch and is about to kill her, but she charms him into sparing her. Leatherface returns to Chop Top and leads him to believe that he has killed Stretch. They then take L.G. to their home, followed by Stretch, who becomes trapped inside the Sawyer home, an abandoned carnival ground decorated with human bones, multi-colored lights, and carnival remnants.\n\nLefty, who has been following their car all along, arrives equipped with chainsaws and proceeds to trash the home before he finds Franklin's remains. Meanwhile, Stretch is found by Leatherface, who puts L.G.'s skinned face and hat on her before tying her arms and leaving. Later, L.G. is still alive and frees Stretch before dying. Drayton finds Stretch and the family capture her. Chop Top scolds Leatherface when he finds out that Stretch is still alive. They torture her at the dinner table, but Lefty arrives and saves her. Stretch flees the ground, but Chop Top chases her. Lefty wounds Drayton. Lefty and Leatherface get into a chainsaw fight, and Leatherface is fatally wounded. The dying Drayton, accepting that he and his family have lost, takes a grenade from [[Nubbins]]' corpse and blows up the ground, killing himself, Lefty, Leatherface and Grandpa.\n\nChop Top chases Stretch to the top of a rock tower. Stretch grabs a chainsaw held by the corpse of the family's grandmother in a shrine and fatally wounds Chop Top, causing him to fall off the tower to his death. Stretch shouts in triumph and swings the chainsaw in the air.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Lt.

When the film was submitted in the United Kingdom to the [[BBFC]] for a certificate, the BBFC notified Cannon, the distributor, that at least 20 to 25 minutes of footage would have to be trimmed in order for the film to be given an 18 rating. Cannon attempted to cut the film, but eventually gave up after numerous re-edited versions failed to pass the BBFC.<ref name=\"BBFC\">{{cite web |url=https://bbfc.co.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/BBFC%20Annual%20Report%201987.pdf |title=Annual Report 1987 |work=BBFC |access-date=March 25, 2020}}</ref> The uncut version of the film was eventually given an 18 rating in 2001.
