At school she is assigned to take care of new student Sarah ([[Lou de La\u00e2ge]]) who has recently moved from Nigeria, where her mother works, to live with her aunt. The two quickly become inseparable. During [[All Saints' Day]] Sarah tells Charlie that her mother is unable to visit and she'll be alone. Charlie invites Sarah to spend time with her mother and her mother's friends for the holiday.\n\nSarah's attitude towards Charlie abruptly changes when they are on vacation when Charlie introduces Sarah as a classmate and not as a friend. Sarah then alternates between being warm to Charlie and being cold and freezing her out. When they return from their vacation Sarah ignores Charlie and Charlie practices asking her what is wrong when she sees her at school. However, when Sarah gets to school Charlie warmly embraces her acting as though nothing is wrong.\n\nCharlie continues to grow suspicious of Sarah and the way she acts. In front of their group of friends she points out inconsistencies in Sarah's stories about her mother. Sarah casually threatens to tell Charlie's friends about her abusive father, which Charlie confided to her in secret. In order to find out the truth about Sarah, Charlie follows her home from school where she learns she lives in a rough part of town with her alcoholic mother.\n\nAt a New Year's party Charlie tells Sarah that she saw her mother and that she, Sarah, isn't really mean. Sarah threatens to kill her if she tells anyone, and the two stop being friendly. After Charlie hears Sarah telling another one of their friends that Charlie never lost her virginity with her ex Lucas because she cried too much, she threatens to tell everyone about Sarah's mother. In retaliation Sarah graffitis \"Charlie is a whore\" all over the school. Though her friends try to rally around her, Charlie does nothing to stop Sarah's abuse.\n\nEventually Sarah shows up at Charlie's house crying because her mother hit her and she felt she had nowhere else to go. Charlie readily forgives her, telling her that she is only upset when they're apart. However, the next day at school Sarah once again ignores her, even giving a necklace she was given by Charlie's mom to another girl as a present. Charlie lashes out by attacking the girl.\n\nSarah comes by Charlie's place to collect her things after school is out for the summer. They sit on Charlie's bed, and Sarah taunts Charlie by saying that Charlie is an abuser playing a victim. Sarah tells Charlie that she plans to move to Paris with another friend to attend college while Charlie will be stuck in their small town for the rest of her life. Charlie cracks and pushes Sarah, who hits her head on a drawer. Sarah climbs back up and falls back onto the bed and begins laughing. Enraged and extremely distraught, Charlie suffocates her with a pillow.\n\nWhen Charlie's mother returns home, Charlie cries an apology, telling her mother that \"She is upstairs,\" before having a panic attack. Her mother goes upstairs and screams upon finding Sarah's body. Charlie manages to slow down her breathing and looks directly into the camera before it cuts to black.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jos\u00e9phine Japy]] as Charlie\n* [[Lou de La\u00e2ge]] as Sarah  \n* [[Isabelle Carr\u00e9]] as Vanessa\n* [[Claire Keim]] as Laura\n* [[Roxane Duran]] as Victoire \n* [[Fanny Sidney]] as Isa \n* [[Carole Franck]] as Sarah's mother\n* [[Marie Denarnaud]] as Marie \n* Thomas Soliv\u00e9res as Gastine \n* Camille Claris as Delphine \n* Alejandro Albarrac\u00edn as Esteban\n* Radivoje Bukvic as Charlie's father\n* Louka Meliava as Lucas  \n* [[Louise Grinberg]] as Louise\n* [[Anne Marivin]]\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in [[B\u00e9ziers]] from 25 November 2013 to January 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Respire : M\u00e9lanie Laurent r\u00e9alise un film de filles|url=http://www.premiere.fr/Cinema/News-Cinema/Respire-Melanie-Laurent-realise-un-film-de-filles-3903007|accessdate=21 March 2014|work=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|date=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=M\u00e9lanie Laurent : 1er clap pour \"Respire\", sa 2\u00e8me r\u00e9alisation !|url=http://www.allocine.fr/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=18629026.html|accessdate=21 March 2014|website=[[AlloCin\u00e9]]|date=26 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cin\u00e9ma : M\u00e9lanie Laurent r\u00e9alise son film \"Respire\" \u00e0 B\u00e9ziers et \u00e0 Marseillan|url=http://www.midilibre.fr/2014/01/03/cinema-melanie-laurent-realise-son-film-respire-a-beziers-et-a-marseillan,803928.php|accessdate=21 March 2014|newspaper=[[Midi Libre]]|date=3 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn the [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 93% positive reviews, based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10.
