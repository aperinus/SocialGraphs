[[Barry Sonnenfeld]] was one of the film's producers. The film is about four retired mobsters doing one last crime against a drug lord. It was released on August 25, 2000. ''The Crew'' garnered negative reviews and was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing $13.1 million against a $38 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nFour retired mobsters Bobby - the straight man leader, Bats - a cantankerous man with a short fuse and a pacemaker, Mouth - a silent ladies man many years past his prime, and Brick - a nice but dimwitted man plan one last crime to save their apartment at a retirement home (the owners are forcing them out with a rent increase so that the apartments can be rented to young, affluent [[South Beach]] couples). The four steal a corpse from the mortuary to use as the \"victim\" in a staged murder scene. Unknown to them, the body was that of Luis Ventanna, the head of a Colombian drug smuggling ring. As a result of the \"murder\", many of the young renters leave and the four men are given cash and a rent discount by the complex to keep living there. Much of this money is spent on high living and women, which causes a young stripper, Ferris to discover that the four men staged the murder - while spending time with the normally-silent \"Mouth,\" he reveals that his mouth is loosened by intimacy with women.\n\nTo keep the woman quiet, the four agree to kill her stepmother, but instead kidnap her and fake her death by setting fire to her mansion. In the process, they accidentally burn down the house of the drug-smuggler's son, who happened to live in a nearby mansion. Believing that someone is trying to usurp his power, the drug lord offers $100,000 to anyone who brings him the head of the man responsible. This results in a confrontation at the apartment, leading to the capture of a female police officer and her partner, one of the wiseguys, the young woman, and the stepmother. The other wiseguys manage to escape this conflict, and track down the men who kidnapped their friend.\n\nThey call in all of their still-living former associates from their active years and lay siege to the ship where the drug lord is holding his prisoners.  They then turn the ship and the drug smugglers over to the police, along with a shipment of drugs. A truckload of [[Cuban cigars#Cuban cigars|Cuban cigars]] is taken by the men and used to make their apartment complex into \"a retirement home for old wiseguys who are down on their luck.\"\n\nA sub-plot of the movie involves Bobby's search for his long lost daughter, whom he hasn't seen since he was in his 30s and she was a small child.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Bobby Bartellemeo \n** [[Casey Siemaszko]] as Young Bobby Bartellemeo\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Joey \"Bats\" Pistella\n** [[Matthew Borlenghi]] as Young Joey \"Bats\" Pistella \n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Mike \"The Brick\" Donatelli \n** [[Jeremy Ratchford]] as Young Mike \"The Brick\" Donatelli\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Tony \"Mouth\" Donato\n** [[Billy Jayne]] as Young Tony \"Mouth\" Donato\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as Detective Olivia Neal\n** Samantha Kurzman as Young Olivia Neal\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Detective Steve Menteer\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as Maureen \"Ferris\" Lowenstein \n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Pepper Lowenstein \n* [[Miguel Sandoval]] as Raul Ventana\n* [[Jose Zuniga]] as Escobar\n* Mike Moroff as Jorge \n* [[Carlos G\u00f3mez (actor)|Carlos Gomez]] as Miguel \n* [[Louis Lombardi]], Jr. as Jimmy \"Whistles\"\n* [[Frank Vincent]] as Marty\n* [[Louis Guss]] as Jerry \"The Hammer\" Fungo\n\n==Reception==\n''The Crew'' received negative reviews upon release, and was mostly noted for its similarities to ''[[Space Cowboys]]'', which also involved four retirees who return for one last job (in that case, to go back into space). On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds a {{RT data|score}} approval rating based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}.
