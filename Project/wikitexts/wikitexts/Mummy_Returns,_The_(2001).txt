The film is a sequel to the 1999 film ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' and was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\n''The Mummy Returns'' inspired the 2002 [[prequel]] film ''[[The Scorpion King]]'', a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] that is set 5,000 years prior and whose [[eponym]]ous character, played by [[Dwayne Johnson]] (The Rock), was introduced in this film. ''The Mummy Returns'' was a commercial success despite mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->\nIn 3067 BC, the [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Mathayus (Scorpion King)|Scorpion King]] leads an army to conquer the world. However, they are defeated and exiled to the desert of Ahm Shere. The king vows to give [[Anubis]] his soul in return for the power to defeat his enemies, so an [[oasis]] and [[pyramid]] magically form, and he is given an army of warriors. The Army of Anubis sweeps across Egypt, but once their task is finished, Anubis claims the Scorpion King's soul and the army returns to the [[Underworld]].\n\nIn 1933, [[Rick O'Connell]] and his wife [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Evelyn Carnahan|Evelyn]] explore ancient ruins with their son, [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Alex O'Connell|Alex]], finding the Bracelet of Anubis. In London, the bracelet locks onto Alex, showing him a vision directing him to Ahm Shere. Evelyn is captured by an Egyptian cult who resurrect [[Imhotep (character)|Imhotep]] with the ''[[Book of the Dead]]''; they wish to use his power to defeat the Scorpion King, giving him command of Anubis' army to conquer the world. The cult, led by [[List of The Mummy characters#Baltus Hafez|Baltus Hafez]], includes enforcer [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Lock-Nah|Lock-Nah]] and [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Meela Nais|Meela Nais]], the physical reincarnation of Imhotep's love [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Anck-su-namun|Anck-su-namun]].\n\nThe O'Connells set out to rescue Evelyn, with her brother [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Jonathan Carnahan|Jonathan]] and the [[Medjay|Medjai]] [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Ardeth Bay|Ardeth Bay]]. Jonathan gets his hands on a mysterious golden [[Sceptre|scepter]].\n\nRick frees Evelyn and flees, but Alex is then kidnapped by Lock-Nah and forced to go to Egypt with the cult. The O'Connells pursue them, with Rick's associate [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Izzy Buttons|Izzy]]. The bracelet gives Alex directions to Ahm Shere that the cult follows; Imhotep forces his cooperation by warning him that, if he doesn't enter the pyramid's within a week, the bracelet will kill him. At each location, Alex leaves clues for his parents, who follow in Izzy's [[Airship|dirigible]]. Imhotep uses the ''Book of the Dead'' to give Meela Anck-su-namun's soul, but by doing so, he allows Evelyn to unlock the memories of her [[Reincarnation|previous life]] as Princess Nefertiri, the bracelet's keeper and [[Pharaoh]] [[Seti I]]'s daughter.\n\nAt the edge of the Oasis, Imhotep realises they're being pursued so uses his magic to crash the dirigible; Izzy stays behind to repair it. By nightfall, the cult saw the dead people of history \nhave come to the Oasis as they have failed to invade Ahm Shere: like [[Roman legion]]naires, and [[French Revolution|turn-of-the-century]] [[French First Republic|French]] [[Napoleon]]'s troops, the O'Connells infiltrate the cult, but both groups are attacked by [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] mummies. Rick retrieves Alex while Ardeth kills Lock-Nah. They escape the pygmies, who kill all the cult members except for Hafez, Imhotep, and Anck-su-namun. The O'Connells arrive at the pyramid just in time as the sun rises, and the bracelet detaches from Alex. Anck-su-namun, Imhotep, and Hafez then arrive and kill Evelyn before entering the pyramid.\n\nInside the pyramid, Hafez puts on the bracelet, reviving the army, but in doing so loses the flesh from his forearm. Anubis takes Imhotep's powers, so he fights as a mortal. Rick finds Imhotep summoning the Scorpion King inside the pyramid and fights him. The Scorpion King, now an enormous half-human/half-scorpion monster, interrupts them, attacking Rick. At the same time, Ardeth and the Medjai battle Anubis's resurrected army outside.\n\nWhile Rick and the Scorpion King fight, Hafez is caught in the melee and killed by the king. Jonathan and Alex steal the ''Book of the Dead'' from Anck-su-namun and use it to resurrect Evelyn, who confronts Anck-su-namun. When Rick discovers Jonathan's scepter is a mystical spear, he uses it to stab the Scorpion King, sending him and the army back into the Underworld.\n\nAs the oasis begins to [[Self-destruct|destroy itself]] and the pyramid crumbles, Rick and Imhotep cling to the ledge of a pit that leads to the underworld. Rick implores Evelyn to escape before it is too late, but she risks her life to pull Rick to safety. Seeing this, Imhotep pleads for Anck-su-namun to do the same but she abandons him. Heartbroken, Imhotep lets go and falls into the underworld.\n\nMeanwhile, the collapse of the pyramid causes Anck-su-namun to fall into a pit of scorpions<!-- scorpions is correct, do not change to scarabs per discussion at Talk page -->, killing her. Izzy arrives with a modified dirigible and rescues the O'Connells just before the oasis and the pyramid are totally destroyed, though not before Jonathan swipes the pyramid's crystal jewel. They depart into the sunset, with Ardeth Bay saluting them before riding off.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of The Mummy (film series) characters}}\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as [[Rick O'Connell]]\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Evelyn Carnahan|Evelyn O'Connell / Nefertiri]]\n* [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Jonathan Carnahan|Jonathan Carnahan]]\n* [[Arnold Vosloo]] as [[Imhotep (The Mummy)|Imhotep]]\n* [[Oded Fehr]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Ardeth Bay|Ardeth Bay]]\n* [[Patricia Vel\u00e1squez]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Anck-su-namun|Meela Nais / Anck-Su-Namun]]\n* [[Freddie Boath]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Alex O'Connell|Alex O'Connell]]\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Baltus Hafez|Baltus Hafez]]\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Mathayus (Scorpion King)|Mathayus of Akkad / The Scorpion King]]\n* [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Lock-Nah|Lock-Nah]]\n* [[Shaun Parkes]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Izzy Buttons|Izzy Buttons]]\n* [[Bruce Byron]] as [[List of The Mummy (film series) characters#Red Willits|Red Willits]]\n* [[Joe Dixon (actor)|Joe Dixon]] as Jacques\n* [[Tom Fisher (actor)|Tom Fisher]] as Spivey\n* [[Aharon Ipal\u00e9]] as [[Pharaoh]] [[Seti I]]\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums -->\n| name        = The Mummy Returns: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type        = Soundtrack\n| artist      = [[Alan Silvestri]]\n| cover       = \n| released    = May 1, 2001\n| length      = 01:13:26 \n| label       = [[Decca Records]]\n| chronology   = The Mummy\n| prev_title   = [[The Mummy (1999 film)#Music|The Mummy]]\n| prev_year    = 1999\n| year         = 2001\n| next_title   = [[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor#Music|Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]\n| next_year    = 2008\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1=[https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mummy-returns-soundtrack-mw0000003240 AllMusic]\n|rev1score={{Rating|3|5}}\n|rev2=[https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?SID=7076 Empire]\n|rev2score={{Rating|3|5}}\n|rev3=[http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/mummy_returns.html Filmtracks]\n|rev3score={{Rating|4|5}}\n|rev4=[http://www.tracksounds.com/reviews/mummyreturns.htm Tracksounds]\n|rev4score={{Rating|8|10}}\n}}\n'''''The Mummy Returns: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' was released on May 1, 2001 by [[Decca Records]].\n\nIt contains the score composed and conducted by [[Alan Silvestri]] as well as a version of the song \"[[Forever May Not Be Long Enough]]\" by the rock band [[Live (band)|Live]], which slightly differs from the song's album version.\nA 2-CD expansion was released by [[Intrada Records]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.11534/.f |title = THE MUMMY RETURNS (2CD)}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Mummy Returns'' earned $23.4 million on its first day of release, then made $26.8 million the day after.
