It starred, Juan Calvo (who also starred together as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the 1947 [[Don Quixote de la Mancha (1947 film)|Spanish film version]] of [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'') and the young child star [[Pablito Calvo]] (no relation to Juan) as Marcelino. The musical score and theme song \u2013 sung in full during the action, rather than at the start of the film \u2013 are by [[Pablo Soroz\u00e1bal]].\n\nThe story, revised and modernised in both the book and film, dates back to a medieval legend, one of many gathered together in a volume by [[Alfonso el Sabio]].<ref name=\"adorable\">{{cite journal|url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/327/ |last=Harvey |first=Jessamy |date=2004 |title=Death and the adorable orphan: Marcelino pan y vino (1954; 1991; 2000). |journal=[[Journal of Romance Studies]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=63\u201377 |doi=10.3828/jrs.4.1.63 |issn=1473-3536}}</ref> It was a critical and commercial success, and other countries have produced versions of it.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around Marcelino, an orphan abandoned as a baby on the steps of a monastery in nineteenth-century Spain. The monks raise the child, and Marcelino grows into a rowdy young boy. He has been warned by the monks not to visit the monastery attic, where a \"very big man who will take him away\" lives, but he ventures upstairs anyway, sees the man and tears off back down the stairs.\n\nAt a festival, Marcelino causes havoc when he accidentally topples a pile of fruit and lets some animals loose.  The new local mayor, a blacksmith whom the monks would not let adopt Marcelino because of his coarse behaviour, uses the incident as an excuse to try to shut down the monastery.\n\nGiven the [[silent treatment]] by the monks, Marcelino gathers up the courage to once again enter the attic, where he sees not a bogeyman, but a beautiful statue of Christ on the Cross. Remarking that the statue looks hungry, Marcelino steals some bread and wine and offers it to the statue, which comes to life, descends from the Cross, and eats and drinks what the boy has brought him. The statue becomes Marcelino's best friend and confidant and begins to give him religious instruction. For his part, Marcelino realizes that the statue is Christ.\n\nThe monks know something is strange when they notice bread and wine disappearing, and arrange to spy on Marcelino. One day, the statue notices that Marcelino is pensive and brooding instead of happy, and tells him that he would like to reward his kindness. Marcelino answers: \"I want only to see my mother, and to see Yours after that\". The statue cradles Marcelino in its arms, tells Marcelino to sleep - and Marcelino dies happy.\n\nThe monks witness the miracle through a crack in the attic door and burst in just in time to see the dead Marcelino bathed in a heavenly glow. The statue returns to its place on the Cross, and Marcelino is buried underneath the chapel and venerated by all who visit the now flourishing monastery-turned-shrine.\n\nThe main story is told in flashback by a monk (played by [[Fernando Rey]]), who, visiting a dying girl, tells her the story of Marcelino for inspiration. The film ends with the monk entering the now completely remodelled chapel in the monastery during Mass, and saying to the crucifix once kept in the attic: \"We have been speaking about You, O Lord\", and then, to Marcelino's grave, which is situated nearby, \"And about you, too, Marcelino.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{columnslist|\n* [[Pablito Calvo]] as Marcelino\n* [[Rafael Rivelles]] as Padre Superior - Father Superior\n* Antonio Vico as Fray Puerta - Brother Door\n* Juan Calvo as Fray Papilla - Brother Cookie\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Marco Dav\u00f3]] as Pascual\n* [[Juanjo Men\u00e9ndez]] as Fray Giles\n* [[Adriano Dom\u00ednguez]] as Monk\n* [[Mariano Aza\u00f1a]] as Fray Malo - Brother Bad\n* Joaqu\u00edn Roa as Fray Tal\u00e1n - Brother Ding-Dong\n* [[Isabel de Pom\u00e9s]] as Manuel's Mother\n* [[Carmen Carbonell]] as Alfonsa\n* Carlota Bilbao as Nicol\u00e1s' Wife\n* Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez as Monk\n* [[Rafael Calvo]] as Don Emilio\n* Francisco Arenzana as Nicol\u00e1s\n* [[Antonio Ferrandis]] as Monk\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Prada]] as Roque\n* Francisco Bernal as Pueblerino\n* Julio F.

Its Plaza Mayor serves as a stage for the initial scene, in which the narrator friar, Fernando Rey, goes down to the village to tell the sick child the story of Marcellino. The scene of the market, where Marcelino has just climbed into a cockpit after causing the stampede of a yoke of oxen. Finally, back to the convent, they pass in front of the Hermitage of San Blas of said locality. All the atmosphere related to the convent is located in the chapel of the Cristo del Caloco in [[El Espinar]] ([[Province of Segovia|Segovia]]) one which has great devotion in the region;\n\nThe figure of the Christ, however, does not correspond to that of the Caloco, but is a sculpture of the sculptor Antonio Simont and is currently on the altar of the Chapel of St. Teresa of the Convent of the Carmelites of [[Don Benito]] ([[Province of Badajoz|Badajoz]]). There it ended up at the wish of one of the sound engineers of the film, Miguel L\u00f3pez Cabrera, whose sister was a nun in the convent.\n\n==Remakes==\n*A Philippine remake of ''Miracle of Marcelino'', under its original title, was released in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406057/|title=Marcelino pan y vino|date=27 April 1979|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n*An Italian remake, ''Marcellino'', was produced in 1991 in color, and was much less successful than the original film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102401/|title=Marcellino|date=19 December 1991|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n*In 2000, VIP Toons of Spain, PMMP and TF1 of France and [[Nippon Animation]] of Japan created the first TV series adaptation of the story, also titled ''[[Marcelino Pan y Vino (TV series)|Marcelino Pan y Vino]]'' after the original novel.  The first 26-episode run (2000-2001) was adapted into several languages, including French, Spanish, Tagalog, Portuguese, and Italian, and became a success across Europe.
