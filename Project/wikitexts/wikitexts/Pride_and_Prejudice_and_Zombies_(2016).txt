The film is directed by [[Burr Steers]], who wrote the adapted screenplay, and stars [[Lily James]], [[Sam Riley]], [[Jack Huston]], [[Bella Heathcote]], [[Douglas Booth]], [[Matt Smith]], [[Charles Dance]], and [[Lena Headey]]. The film follows the general plot of Austen's original novel, with elements of [[zombie]], [[horror film|horror]] and [[post-apocalyptic fiction]] incorporated.\n\nDevelopment of a film adaptation based on Grahame-Smith's novel began in 2009, with [[Natalie Portman]] attached to star and produce and [[Lionsgate]] to distribute. However, the film went through [[development hell]], with budgetary disputes halting pre-production. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[South East England]] from September 24, 2014 until November 21.\n\n''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on January 23, 2016 and was theatrically released by [[Screen Gems]] on February 5, 2016 in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=prideprejudicezombies.htm|title=Box Office Mojo|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=October 9, 2015}}</ref> and by [[Lionsgate]] on February 11 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"P&P&Z UK\" /> The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, with criticism for the tone, action and plot, but praise for the production values, acting and humor.<ref name=\"RT2\"/><ref name=\"Critics\"/> It was a [[box-office bomb|commercial failure]], grossing just $16 million worldwide against a budget of $28 million.<ref name=BOM/>\n\n==Plot==\nEarly 19th century [[England]] is besieged by zombies; the Bennet sisters\u2014Elizabeth, Jane, Kitty, Lydia, and Mary\u2014have all been trained in the art of weaponry and [[martial arts]] in [[China]] at their father's behest so they can defend themselves. Mrs. Bennet only wants to see her daughters married off to wealthy suitors. The Bennets attend a country dance also attended by newcomers Colonel Darcy, his good friend the amiable Charles Bingley and Bingley's snobbish sister Caroline. There, the young and handsome Bingley falls for lovely, sweet natured Jane. Charles Bingley has inherited [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]100,000 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|0.1|1813|r=1|fmt=c}} million today)\u2014attracting Mrs. Bennet's attention as a desirable suitor for her daughter. When zombies attack the ball, the Bennet sisters fight them off, and Colonel Darcy, a skilled zombie killer who was trained in [[Japanese martial arts]] \u2013 with property that pays him \u00a310,000 annually (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|10000|1813|r=-4|fmt=c}} today) \u2013 is attracted to Elizabeth, although his behavior is outwardly aloof. During the ball, Darcy is disgusted to overhear Mrs. Bennet's mercenary delight that Jane has attracted a rich man. On the way to the Bingleys' some days later, Jane is attacked by a zombie and catches a fever. Darcy orders her confined in fear that she may have been bitten, but her illness is not zombie-related, and she recovers.\n\nThe Bennets are visited by a cousin, the overbearing Parson Collins, who, as the only surviving male heir in the family, will inherit the Bennet home upon Mr. Bennet's death. Collins proposes to Elizabeth but states that she must give up her life as a warrior, something she refuses to do. Elizabeth meets a charming soldier named George Wickham and arranges to meet him at another ball. She travels with him to a church that is filled with zombies who feed on pig brains instead of human brains, keeping their behaviour relatively normal. Wickham believes that humans can coexist with these new \"civilized\" zombies. He informs Elizabeth that Darcy convinced the Bingleys to leave the county to keep Bingley away from Jane and then asks her to elope with him, but she refuses. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, having fallen in love with her despite his apparent coldness, she expresses outrage at his actions concerning Jane and fights him.\n\nDarcy later writes Elizabeth a letter to apologize. He regrets that he separated Jane and Bingley, fearing that Jane only wanted to marry Bingley for his wealth. He also exposes Wickham's true nature. He and Wickham were childhood friends, but Wickham may have murdered Darcy's father, squandered his inheritance, and tried to elicit additional money from Darcy's estate. When that fails, Wickham tries to elope with Darcy's young sister, Georgiana, for her fortune. Elizabeth learns that Wickham has run off with Lydia and London has been overrun with zombies. Darcy saves Lydia and learns that Wickham is using the \"civilized\" zombies to create a zombie army, which has overrun London based on Wickham's plan to rule the country. He stops him by giving the zombies human brains, which turns them savage.\n\nWhile fighting, Darcy stabs Wickham's chest, revealing him to have been undead all along, like the other supposedly tame zombies. Elizabeth saves Darcy from being killed by Wickham, who escapes (though Elizabeth has chopped off his right arm). As the two ride across a bridge, the human army destroys it to keep the zombies from crossing over from London. Darcy is injured in the explosion, and Elizabeth tearfully admits her love for him. After Darcy recovers, he proposes to Elizabeth again, and this time, she accepts. The two have a joint wedding with Bingley and Jane. All of a sudden, Wickham arrives with his zombie army to crash the wedding, leaving everyone's fate unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lily James]] as [[Elizabeth Bennet]]\n* [[Sam Riley]] as [[Mr. Darcy|Colonel Fitzwilliam Darcy]]\n* [[Bella Heathcote]] as [[Jane Bennet]]\n* [[Ellie Bamber]] as [[Lydia Bennet]]\n* [[Millie Brady]] as Mary Bennet\n* [[Suki Waterhouse]] as Kitty Bennet\n* [[Douglas Booth]] as [[Mr. Bingley]]\n* [[Jack Huston]] as [[George Wickham]]\n* [[Sally Phillips]] as [[Mrs. Bennet]]\n* [[Charles Dance]] as [[Mr Bennet|Mr. Bennet]]\n* [[Matt Smith]] as [[Mr. William Collins|Parson William Collins]]\n* [[Lena Headey]] as [[Lady Catherine de Bourgh]]\n* [[Emma Greenwell]] as Caroline Bingley\n* [[Aisling Loftus]] as Charlotte Lucas\n* [[Morfydd Clark]] as Georgiana Darcy\n* [[Dolly Wells]] as Mrs. Featherstone\n* [[Tom Lorcan]] as Lieutenant Denny\n* [[Hermione Corfield]] as Cassandra\n* Jess Radomska as Annabelle Netherfield\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film is based on the 2009 novel of the same name, which was billed as having been co-written by [[Jane Austen]] and [[Seth Grahame-Smith]].
