The film was released in the United States and Canada by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] on 28 March 2014. Like its predecessor, it received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\nIn the story, [[Mobile Brigade Corps|special forces]] officer Rama is sent [[undercover operation|undercover]] to expose the corrupt police officials colluding with the crime families of [[Jakarta]]'s [[criminal underworld]]. Like Evans' previous films ''[[Merantau]]'' and ''The Raid'', the fight scenes showcase the Indonesian fighting style of [[pencak silat]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding any material. The plot section is limited to 700 words maximum. -->\nImmediately after helping his brother, Rama, take down his superior in the [[The Raid (2011 film)|previous film]], [[Jakarta]] gang boss Andi is captured and executed by another criminal, Bejo. Meanwhile, Rama brings his corrupt superior [[Lieutenant|Lt]]. Wahyu with him to meet Lt. Bunawar, head of an internal investigation unit. Bunawar immediately has Wahyu killed under the pretense of keeping Rama safe from other crooked cops, and asks Rama to go undercover as a criminal to expose police chief Reza's crooked dealings with the Bangun and Goto [[crime syndicate]]s. Rama initially refuses, but agrees after learning of Andi's death.\n\nUsing the pseudonym ''Yuda'', Rama thrashes the politician\u2019s son responsible for putting crime lord Bangun's ambitious son Uco in prison, and is arrested and put in the same prison as Uco. In prison, Rama gains Uco's trust by saving his life during a violent riot intended to cover up an assassination. Bangun hires Rama alongside Uco after his release two years later, while hiring hitman Prakoso to assassinate another of his rivals. Frustrated with his limited role in his father's organization, Uco meets Bejo, who shares rumors of a plot to turn Reza and others against his father. Bejo allows Uco to kill the gang members responsible for the prison riot, and they hatch a plot to start a gang war to disrupt the truce between Bangun and fellow crime lord Hideaki Goto so Uco can prove his worth to his father and Bejo can take Goto's territory.\n\nUco sets Prakoso up to be killed by the Assassin, Bejo's top enforcer and bodyguard. The Assassin uses his [[karambit]] to slice Prakoso's neck, and he bleeds to death in the snow. Prakoso's death gives Uco the motive to blame it on Goto's gang, but Bangun refuses to counterattack. Frustrated, Uco convinces Bejo to have his 2 hitmen, siblings Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man, kill several of Goto's men, successfully sparking a gang war between the families. When Bangun and Goto meet to reconcile, Uco lashes out in anger, embarrassing Bangun into conceding [[territory]]. Bangun angrily beats Uco when they return to his office. Rama is attacked and learns from Lt. Bunawar that the attackers were Reza's corrupt cops sent after him. He is then asked to protect Uco by fellow criminal Eka.\n\nWhile he is on the way to Bangun's office, Bejo arrives with the Assassin and a mob of henchmen. Uco reveals his betrayal, kills his father, and shoots Eka. Before Bejo can finish Eka off, Rama arrives and gives Eka the chance to escape, but is subdued by the Assassin and driven away to be executed. Eka rescues Rama in a violent car chase, but is critically injured in the process and reveals to Rama he is also an [[secret police|undercover officer]]. Goto's henchman Ryuichi informs Goto of Uco's betrayal and that police chief Reza is meeting Bejo and Uco at a warehouse. Rama calls Lt. Bunawar, who informs him the gang war has escalated, the [[police commissioner|commissioner]] has been killed, and Eka is responsible for the deaths of 10 honest officers. He also informs Rama of the meeting between Reza, Bejo, and Uco. Bejo and Uco meet Reza to discuss terms against Goto.\n\nStill shaken after killing his father, Uco discovers Rama's bug in his wallet. He notices Bejo has the same tattoo as the gang member who tried to kill him during the riot, realizing he has been used as a pawn by Bejo and Reza. Meanwhile, Rama infiltrates the warehouse and battles through Bejo's henchmen. Approaching the hallway, he is obstructed by Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man and manages to kill them both. Rama then enters the kitchen, where the Assassin awaits him. As the kitchen workers leave, Rama and the Assassin have a one-on-one duel. After an intense, brutal, and bloody battle, Rama puts an end to the Assassin using the Assassin's own karambit. \n\nRama finally makes his way to Bejo and disrupts the meeting. Bejo attempts to shoot Rama (managing to graze his side with a shotgun), but Uco shoots and kills Reza and Bejo. Before Uco can kill Rama as well, Rama throws a karambit at him and stabs him to death; Uco dies in his arms. Weakened and exhausted, Rama limps from the premises and encounters Goto's son Keichi and several henchmen, sent to attack the meeting. While Lt. Bunawar drives to the site, Keichi smirks as he silently offers a deal to Rama, who simply responds that he is done.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Iko Uwais]] as Rama/Yuda, one of the three surviving police officers of the first film's eponymous raid, and a [[Mobile Brigade Corps|special forces]] member turned [[undercover agent]].
