[[Cate Blanchett]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Rhys Ifans]], [[Jason Behr]], and [[Gordon Pinsent]] appear in supporting roles.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Quoyle was a young boy, his father, Guy, tossed him into a lake, expecting him to swim naturally. Images of flailing in water and nearly drowning often resurface in Quoyle's memory when he is under stress.\n\nQuoyle, now an ink setter at a small newspaper in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], lives a lonely life. He becomes infatuated with and marries a vivacious local woman named Petal. Petal is an unfaithful wife and a negligent mother to their six-year-old daughter, Bunny. Petal runs off with a lover, taking Bunny with her. Soon after, Petal and her boyfriend are killed in a car accident. The police return Bunny to Quoyle, informing him that Petal sold her to a black market adoption operation for $6,000.\n\nShortly before those events, Quoyle's elderly parents die by [[suicide pact|suicide together]]. Quoyle's aunt, Agnis Hamm, arrives to pay her respects to her late brother, though her real motive is to steal Guy's ashes (which she later dumps down an outhouse hole and urinates on). Agnis is moving to the ancestral family home in [[Newfoundland]], which has been abandoned for 44 years. Agnis agrees to stay a few more days to help Quoyle through his recent turmoil, then persuades him to move to Newfoundland with her.\n\nWhile struggling to build a new life, restore the derelict house, and care for Bunny, Quoyle meets Wavey Prowse, a widow whose young son, Harry, has a [[learning disability]]. Wavey and Quoyle gradually develop a deepening relationship. Wavey eventually admits she pretends to be widowed, ashamed that her philandering husband left when she was pregnant. Quoyle learns that the ancient Quoyles were pirates that ran ships aground and savagely pillaged them. When those Quoyles were driven out, they moved their house over a frozen lake to its present location, now known as Quoyle's Point. Quoyle's cousin Nolan, an old hermit, reveals that young Agnis was raped and impregnated by her teenaged brother (Quoyle's father), resulting in an abortion.\n\nQuoyle applies for an ink setter job at the ''Gammy Bird''. Owner and publisher, Jack Buggit, instead hires him as a reporter covering auto wrecks and the town's shipping news. With no journalism experience, Quoyle struggles to produce decent articles, incurring managing editor Tert Card's constant scorn. Reporter Billy Pretty tutors and encourages Quoyle. When Quoyle's article about a millionaire's vintage yacht docked in town is popular with readers, Jack assigns him a weekly column profiling an interesting boat in port. Meanwhile, Agnis resumes her former occupation as a boat upholsterer to help support the family. She later confides to Quoyle that the woman she loved died six years earlier from leukemia.\n \nRather than running his newspaper full time, Jack Buggit commercially fishes to prevent his adult son, Dennis, who nearly died at sea, from obtaining his own commercial license, which are limited. Jack drowns while securing his boat in an oncoming storm. During the funeral wake at the Buggit house, shock and chaos erupts when Jack miraculously revives from a coma-like state caused by [[hypothermia]]. Jack gives Dennis his fishing license, believing the [[generational curse]] of Buggits dying at sea has been broken. After Jack's revival, Bunny is upset and angry at Quoyle, believing Petal could also have been \"awakened,\u201d but she finally accepts her mother's death.\n\nAgnis, Quoyle, and Bunny have been living in town during the winter months while their house is renovated. On the night of the big storm, Bunny awakes and can \"see\" the house at Quoyle's point being blown away. When the family drives to their property, they discover the house is gone, symbolically freeing them from the dark Quoyle legacy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Quoyle\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Wavey Prowse\n* [[Judi Dench]] as Agnis Hamm\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Petal\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as Tert Card\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as Jack Buggit\n* [[Rhys Ifans]] as Beaufield Nutbeem\n* [[Gordon Pinsent]] as Billy Pretty\n* [[Jason Behr]] as Dennis Buggit\n* [[Larry Pine]] as Bayonet Melville\n* [[Jeanetta Arnette]] as Silver Melville\n* [[Katherine Moennig]] as Grace Moosup\n* [[Marc Lawrence]] as Cousin Nolan\n* [[John Dunsworth]] as Guy Quoyle\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film, while broadly following the plot of the book, makes several changes; notably, Quoyle is obese and has two daughters in the novel, but in the film he has only one daughter and is of average build. He is only a timid ink setter in the film and he does not begin writing as a reporter until after he arrives in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. In the novel, he is already a journalist. Another difference is that several characters, such as the younger Buggit family, are deleted or merged.\n\nThe film was originally to be directed by [[Fred Schepisi]], with [[John Travolta]] in the lead male role.<ref>Caroline Baum, \"Fred bare\", ''The Age'', 22 April 2006, Good Weekend magazine, p. 46</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''The Shipping News'' received mixed reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 55% rating, based on 130 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Though solidly made and acted, ''The Shipping News'' is rather heavy-handed and dull, especially given the nature of its protagonist.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shipping_news/ |title=The Shipping News (2001) |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=July 14, 2015}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 47 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-shipping-news |title=The Shipping News |website= [[Metacritic]]|access-date=July 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Won===\n* [[Florida Film Critics Circle Awards 2001|Florida Film Critics Association]]:\n*# Best Supporting Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n* [[National Board of Review Awards 2001|National Board of Review]]:\n*# Best Supporting Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\n===Nominated===\n* Art Directors Guild (ADG):\n*# Excellence in Production Design Award Feature Film \u2013 Contemporary Film\n* [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]]:\n*# [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (Kevin Spacey)\n*# [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] (Judi Dench)\n* [[Berlin International Film Festival]]:\n*# Golden Berlin Bear (Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m)\n* [[7th Critics' Choice Awards|Broadcast Film Critics Association]]:\n*# [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Composer|Best Composer]] (Christopher Young)\n*# [[Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n* [[Golden Globe Awards 2001|Golden Globe Awards]]:\n*# [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]] (Kevin Spacey)\n*# [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] ([[Christopher Young]])\n* [[Screen Actors Guild Awards 2001|Screen Actors Guilds (SAG)]]:\n*# [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role]] (Judi Dench)\n* [[USC Scripter Award 2001|USC Scripter Award]]:\n*# USC Scripter Award (Robert Nelson Jacobs and E.
