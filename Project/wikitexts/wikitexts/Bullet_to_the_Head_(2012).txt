The screenplay by [[Alessandro Camon]] was based on the French graphic novel ''Du plomb dans la t\u00eate'' written by [[Alexis Nolent|Matz]] and illustrated by [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]]. The film stars [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Sung Kang]], [[Sarah Shahi]], [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]], [[Christian Slater]], and [[Jason Momoa]]. Alexandra Milchan, [[Alfred Gough]], [[Miles Millar]], and Kevin King-Templeton produced the film. The movie follows a hitman (Stallone) and a cop (Kang) who are forced to work together to bring down a corrupt businessman (Akinnuoye-Agbaje) after they are targeted by the businessman's assassin (Momoa).\n\nThe film had an exclusive test screening at the International [[Rome Film Festival]] on November 14, 2012<ref>{{cite news|last=Eric J.

The film received mixed reviews and was a [[box office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the city of [[New Orleans]], hitman Jimmy Bobo and his partner Louis Blanchard kill a corrupt former [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|MPDC]] policeman, Hank Greely, although Bobo leaves a prostitute, Lola, alive. Later, at a bar, Blanchard is murdered by another hitman, Keegan, who also attempts to kill Bobo but fails.\n\nWashington, D.C., Detective Taylor Kwon arrives in New Orleans to investigate his former partner's death and meets Lieutenant Lebreton, who informs him Lola confirmed Greely was assassinated. Kwon goes to the morgue, and, after seeing Blanchard's body and finding out who he is, he deduces that Blanchard and Bobo killed Greely. Meanwhile, Keegan meets with his employer, Robert Morel, and Morel's lawyer Marcus Baptiste. Baptiste reveals that Greely tried to blackmail Morel, and provided local mobster Baby Jack with a file detailing Morel's illegal operations. Keegan later kills Baby Jack and his men and retrieves the file.\n\nKwon meets Bobo in a bar and informs him that he knows Bobo and Blanchard killed Greely. Bobo leaves, and when Kwon tries to follow him, he is attacked by corrupt cops who were ordered by Morel to prevent Kwon from further investigating about Greely. Kwon manages to disarm and gun down one of the corrupt cops but is wounded by the other. Bobo rescues Kwon by running over the other cop and takes him to a tattoo parlor, where Bobo's estranged daughter, Lisa, treats Kwon's wounds. They later go to a massage parlor where Bobo interrogates Ronnie Earl, the middleman who hired Bobo and Blanchard on Morel's behalf. Ronnie Earl tries to kill Bobo, but Bobo manages to kill him, although his gun jams. Bobo later confronts Kwon, who admits to having tampered with Bobo's gun, nearly causing his death. Bobo and Kwon agree to work together.\n\nBobo and Kwon kidnap Baptiste and take him to Bobo's house, where he is forced to give them a flash drive detailing Morel's plans to acquire housing projects and demolish them to build office buildings and reveals Keegan is an ex-mercenary hired to be Morel's enforcer. Afterwards, Bobo shoots him in the head. Keegan and his men trace Baptiste's cellphone to Bobo's house, but Bobo and Kwon are able to escape and detonate a bomb, killing Keegan's men. Keegan escapes and swears revenge on Bobo. Angered at Bobo's methods, Kwon abandons him and continues alone.\n\nKwon meets with Lieutenant Lebreton to ask for his help, but Lebreton tries to kill him, as he is also on Morel's payroll. Bobo kills him and saves Kwon. Meanwhile, Keegan learns about Lisa and kidnaps her. Morel then calls Bobo and offers to trade Lisa for the flash drive. Bobo agrees, and meets with Morel in an abandoned warehouse, where he delivers the flash drive to him and Lisa is returned to him, while Kwon infiltrates the building to arrest Morel killing several of Morel's men along way. Keegan becomes furious when Bobo is allowed to leave; he kills Morel and his men before confronting Bobo; they fight until Bobo stabs Keegan in the throat and Kwon shoots him dead from afar.\n\nKwon retrieves the flash drive and Bobo shoots him in the shoulder to make it appear as if Kwon failed to capture him. Lisa decides to stay with Kwon waiting for the police and Bobo leaves. He later meets Kwon at a bar, where Kwon tells him he did not mention Bobo's involvement to the police this time, but if Bobo continues in the business, Kwon will take him down. Bobo welcomes him to try and drives off into the night.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as James \"Jimmy Bobo\" Bonomo \n* [[Sung Kang]] as Detective Taylor Kwon\n* [[Sarah Shahi]] as Lisa Bonomo \n* [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] as Robert Nkomo Morel\n* [[Jason Momoa]] as Keegan\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Marcus Baptiste\n* [[Jon Seda]] as Louie Blanchard \n* [[Holt McCallany]] as Hank Greely\n* [[Brian Van Holt]] as Ronnie \"Cowboy Ronnie\" Earl\n* [[Weronika Rosati]] as Lola\n* Dane Rhodes as Lieutenant Lebreton \n* Marcus Lyle Brown as Detective Towne\n* Douglas M.

I mean, this is one of those plots... You know, in terms of the real world, they\u2019re fairly preposterous. But that's OK. That's part of the given. As long as you don't break the rules and contradict yourself within that sensibility, people go for the ride.... Sly and I have known each other for probably 35 years. I have always been a great admirer of Sly's. Most directors love movie stars because they\u2019re such fabulous tools to tell stories with. Sly is an actor but he's a star and he's been a star for a very long time. When he sent me this, there was a feeling on both our parts, that if this was ever going to happen \u2013 us working together \u2013 we better sit down and do it.

If the economics are right, people feel like they can be commercial in a reasonable way domestically. But they\u2019re really foreign driven. This movie would not exist without expectation of the foreign audience being vastly greater than the domestic.<ref name=\"la\"/></blockquote>\nHill said he wanted to have fun with the genre:\n<blockquote>We\u2019re not breaking new ground. We\u2019re trying to be entertaining within a format that's familiar. There's a kind of ice skating that goes on where you must let the audience know that you're not taking yourself too seriously. But at the same time, the jokes are funny but the bullets are real. The jeopardy has to be real. When it gets outlandish, there needs to be no drift into parody \u2013 self-parody, maybe inevitable for old directors.<ref name=\"la\"/></blockquote>\nHill said the film would be called a \"buddy movie\" but that he made \"anti-buddy movies\":\n<blockquote>They don't like each other. They\u2019re not going to like each other. The most they\u2019re going to achieve by the end is a kind of grudging respect. I'm just comfortable with that. It seems to be an inherently more dramatic situation than if they\u2019re friendly and they get along and respect each other. Also, frankly, it gives you better avenue to work in humor. These things have to be leavened with humor. It actually reinforces the action.<ref name=\"la\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Filming===\n''Bullet to the Head'' was shot in [[New Orleans]] and started filming on June 27, 2011.<ref name=\"Hollywood\" /> Hill:\n<blockquote>One of the things I like about New Orleans is it feels like you're in a western with the architecture. All the balconies, the old buildings, it feels like you're in the 1880s. Some of it spills into the movie. I don't know how much of it creeps into the edges and helps you or how much of it is just by design. Usually you're trying to tell a narrative through your characters and have all this stuff bleed in around the edges.<ref name=\"collider\"/></blockquote>  \nHill said he told Stallone \"to play things more casually. I wanted him to play his natural personality as much as possible. He's a very engaging guy. I told him, \u201cI'm not interested in you inventing a character as much as imagining yourself as character.\u201d He went right with that.\"<ref name=\"la\"/>\n\n==Music ==\n{{Anchor|Music|Score|Soundtrack}} \n{{Infobox album\n| name       = ''Bullet to the Head: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     =\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 2013\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] (USA)\n| producer   = Hans Zimmer\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe soundtrack album was released digitally on January 29, 2013 and in stores on February 19.
