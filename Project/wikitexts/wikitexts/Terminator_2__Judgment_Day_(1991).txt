Starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Linda Hamilton]], [[Robert Patrick]], and [[Edward Furlong]], it is the sequel to ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and is the second installment in the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' franchise]]. In its plot, the malevolent [[artificial intelligence]] [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] sends a [[T-1000|Terminator]]\u2014a highly advanced killing machine\u2014back in time to 1995 to kill the future leader of the human resistance [[John Connor]] when he is a child. The resistance sends back a less-advanced, reprogrammed [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]] to protect Connor and ensure the future of humanity.\n\n''The Terminator'' was considered a significant success, enhancing Schwarzenegger's and Cameron's careers, but work on a sequel stalled because of animosity between the pair and [[Hemdale Film Corporation]], which partially owned the film's rights. In 1990 Schwarzenegger and Cameron persuaded [[Carolco Pictures]] to purchase the rights from ''The Terminator'' producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] and Hemdale, which was financially struggling, for {{USD|15{{nbs}}million}}. A release date was set for the following year, leaving Cameron and Wisher seven weeks to write the script. The pair frequently conferred with the special-effects studio [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) to determine if their ideas for the extensive special effects were possible. Principal photography began in October 1990 and lasted until March 1991, and took place in and around [[Los Angeles]] on an estimated $94\u2013102{{nbs}}million budget, making it the [[List of most expensive films|most-expensive film ever made]] at the time. The advanced visual effects, which include the first use of a computer-generated main character in a blockbuster film, resulted in a schedule overrun, and [[Release print|theatrical print]]s were not delivered to theaters until the night before its July 3, 1991 release.\n\nOn its release, ''Terminator 2'' earned $519\u2013520.9{{nbs}}million, making it the [[1991 in film|highest-grossing film of 1991]] worldwide, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time. Critics praised the visual effects, action scenes, and cast, choosing Patrick's performance as the T-1000 as a great cinematic villain, but some criticized the film for its violent content. ''Terminator 2'' won several accolades, including [[Saturn Awards|Saturn]], [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]], and [[Academy Awards]]. Alongside tie-in promotions with brands such as [[Pepsi]], ''Terminator 2'' merchandise includes [[List of Terminator video games|video games]], [[List of Terminator comics|comic books]], [[T2 (novel series)|novels]], and ''[[T2-3D: Battle Across Time]]'', a live-action attraction that uses filmed footage featuring Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, Patrick, and Furlong.\n\nSince its release, ''Terminator 2'' has been critically reassessed and is now considered among the best films ever made, and one of the best science-fiction, action, and sequel films, as well as equal to or better than ''The Terminator''. It is also seen as one of the most influential visual effects films of all time, beginning the transition from practical effects to reliance on [[computer-generated imagery]] CGI. Although Cameron considered ''Terminator 2'' to be the end of the franchise, it was followed by a series of films that failed to replicate the success of the original films, including ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003), ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009), ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' (2015), and ''[[Terminator: Dark Fate]]'' (2019), as well as a [[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles|2008 television series]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per Wikipedia guidelines (PER WP:FILMPLOT), please do not expand this plot summary any further.-->\nIn 2029, Earth is a wasteland dominated by the war between the malevolent [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] and the human resistance. Skynet sends the [[T-1000]]\u2014an advanced, prototype, shape-shifting [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]] made of virtually indestructible liquid metal\u2014back in time to kill the resistance leader [[John Connor]] when he is a child.<!--Do not specify his age, which is not confirmed on-screen and is contradicted in other films.--> To protect Connor, the resistance sends back a reprogrammed [[Terminator (character)|T-800 Terminator]], a less-advanced metal [[endoskeleton]] that is covered in synthetic flesh.\n\nIn 1995 Los Angeles, John's mother [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah]] has been incarcerated at [[State hospital|Pescadero State Hospital]] for her violent, fanatical efforts to prevent \"[[Terminator (franchise)#Judgment Day|Judgment Day]]\"\u2014the prophesied events of August 29, 1997, when Skynet will gain sentience and, in response to its creators' attempts to deactivate it, incite a [[nuclear holocaust]]. John is taken in by foster parents. He considers Sarah's beliefs to be delusional and resents her efforts to prepare him for his future role.\n\nThe T-800 and the T-1000 converge on John in a shopping mall and a chase ensues. John and the T-800 escape together. John calls to warn his foster parents but the T-800 deduces the T-1000 has already killed them. Realizing the T-800 is programmed to obey him, John forbids it from killing people and orders it to save Sarah from the T-1000. The T-800 and John intercept Sarah during an escape attempt but Sarah flees because the T-800 resembles the Terminator that was sent to kill her in 1984.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984)}} John and the T-800 persuade her to join them, and they escape the pursuing T-1000. Although distrustful of the T-800, Sarah uses its knowledge of the future to learn that a revolutionary [[microprocessor]] Cyberdyne Systems engineer [[Miles Dyson|Miles Bennett Dyson]] is developing will be essential for Skynet's creation.\n\nOver several days of their journey, Sarah sees the T-800 serving as a friend and father figure to John, who teaches it catchphrases and hand signs as well as encouraging it to become more human-like. Sarah plans to flee with John to Mexico until a nightmare about Judgment Day persuades her to kill Dyson, whom she assaults in his home, but finds she cannot kill him and relents. John arrives and reconciles with Sarah while the T-800 convinces Dyson of the future consequences of his work. Dyson reveals his research has been [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]]ed from the 1984 Terminator's damaged [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and severed arm. Believing his work must be destroyed, Dyson, Sarah, John, and the T-800 break into Cyberdyne, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy the lab. The police assault the building and fatally shoot Dyson but he detonates the explosives as he dies. The T-1000 pursues the surviving trio, eventually cornering them in a steel mill.\n\nSarah and John split up to escape while the T-1000 battles and mangles the T-800, and deactivates it by destroying its power source. The T-1000 assumes Sarah's appearance to lure out John but Sarah intervenes and repeatedly shoots it, pushing it toward the edge of the platform, which stands above a vat of molten steel, but she runs out of ammunition before it falls. The T-800, having been reactivated using an alternate power source, arrives and shoots the T-1000 with a grenade launcher, causing it to fall into the molten steel and disintegrate. John throws the CPU and severed arm into the vat. The T-800 explains it must also be destroyed to prevent its CPU from serving as a foundation for Skynet. The pair hug and John tearfully orders the T-800 to stay but it persuades John its destruction is the only way to protect their future. Sarah shakes the T-800's hand, having come to respect it, and helps lower it into the vat. Before its destruction, the T-800 gives the humans a [[Thumb_signal|thumbs-up]] sign. Sarah is driving down a highway with John; she reflects on her renewed hope for an unknown future, musing if the T-800 could learn the value of life, so can humanity.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Terminator (franchise) characters|l1=List of ''Terminator'' characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 500\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = (Left to right) [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Linda Hamilton]] (both pictured in 2019), and [[Robert Patrick]] (2016)\n| image1 = Arnold Schwarzenegger by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| alt1 = A photograph of Arnold Schwarzenegger\n| image2 = Linda Hamilton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt2 = A photograph of Linda Hamilton\n| image3 = Robert Patrick 2016.jpg\n| alt3 = A photograph of Robert Patrick\n}}\n<!--According to the opening credits.-->\n*[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as the Terminator: a reprogrammed Model 101 Series 800 \"T-800\" Terminator that is composed of living tissue over a metal endoskeleton<ref name=\"ScreenRantCastT800\"/>\n*[[Linda Hamilton]] as Sarah Connor: a self-trained soldier who is dedicated to preventing the rise of Skynet<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/>\n*[[Edward Furlong]] as John Connor: Sarah's son who is destined to lead the human resistance in opposition to Skynet<ref name=\"ScreenRantJConnor\"/>\n*[[Robert Patrick]] as T-1000: an advanced, shape-shifting, prototype Terminator that is composed of liquid metal<ref name=\"CastPatrick\"/>\n*[[Earl Boen]] as Dr. Silberman: Sarah's doctor at Pescadero State Hospital<ref name=\"CastTHRBoen\"/><ref name=\"ScreenRantBoen\"/>\n*[[Joe Morton]] as Miles Bennett Dyson: Director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation<ref name=\"CastDyson\"/><ref name=\"CastDyson2\"/>\n\nThe film's cast also includes [[Jenette Goldstein]] and [[Xander Berkeley]] as John's foster parents Janelle and Todd Voight;<ref name=\"CastGoldsteinBerkeley\"/> [[C\u00e1stulo Guerra]] as Sarah's friend Enrique Salceda; [[S.

A sequel, however, could not be made without Hemdale's approval because Cameron had surrendered 50% of his rights to the company to get ''The Terminator'' made. Cameron had also sold half of the remainder to its producer, co-writer, and his ex-wife [[Gale Anne Hurd]] for $1 following their 1989 divorce.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/>{{sfn|Shapiro|1991|p=28}}<ref name=\"DeadlineKassar\"/><ref name=\"DOGHemdale\"/> By 1990, Cameron, Schwarzenegger, Hurd, and special-effects artist [[Stan Winston]] were suing Hemdale for unpaid profits from ''The Terminator''.<ref name=\"DOGHemdale\"/>\n\nCameron and Schwarzenegger were aware Hemdale was experiencing financial difficulties and would eventually be forced to sell the rights to ''The Terminator''.{{sfn|Shapiro|1991|p=28}} Having worked with independent film studio [[Carolco Pictures]] on the big-budget, science-fiction film ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), Schwarzenegger persuaded its owners, including [[Mario Kassar]], to purchase the rights.{{sfn|Shapiro|1991|p=28}}<ref name=\"DeadlineKassar\"/><ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/> Kassar described the securing of the rights as the most-difficult deal Carolco conducted. He took Daly's $10{{nbs}}million offer for Hemdale's share, which Kassar believed was a sum that had been fabricated to ward him off, and gave Hurd $5{{nbs}}million for hers. With incidental costs, the securing of the rights cost $17{{nbs}}million before any development had begun.<ref name=\"DeadlineKassar\"/><ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/><ref name=\"JoBloExecProd\"/>\n\nKassar had lunch with Cameron to explain to recoup his investment, the film would proceed with or without him; Kassar offered Cameron $6{{nbs}}million to be involved and write the script.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/> The film would be a collaboration between several production studios; Carolco, [[StudioCanal|Le Studio Canal+]], Cameron's [[Lightstorm Entertainment]], and Hurd's [[Pacific Western Productions]].<ref name=\"StudiosLightStorm\"/><ref name=\"StudisoCanal\"/><ref name=\"StudiosPacificWest\"/><ref name=\"StudiosPacificWest2\"/> Compared with the $6.5{{nbs}}million budget of the first film, ''Terminator 2'' was estimated to cost at least $60{{nbs}}million but Kassar called it a \"ghost\" number; he was aware the figure would increase because of Cameron's previous work.<ref name=\"LATimesSummerSpecial\"/><ref name=\"DeadlineKassar\"/> News sources labeled ''Terminator 2'' the most-expensive independent film ever and said it would \"bankrupt Carolco\".<ref name=\"DeadlineKassar\"/><ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/> Despite these predictions, Kassar said through pre-sales to markets outside the U.S., television and home-video rights, Canadian tax breaks, outside investments, and theatrical distribution rights, he had secured funding 110% over the budget before filming began. He said he could secure up to $10{{nbs}}million from Japan for a single film. The studio also had an existing US distribution deal with [[TriStar Pictures]] for a set percentage of the budget, an estimated $4{{nbs}}million.<ref name=\"DeadlineKassar\"/><ref name=\"CTB\"/> Tristar wanted the film to be ready for release on May 27, 1991, [[Memorial Day]].<ref name=\"DOGHowitwasmade\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nWith a scheduled release date in place, Cameron had six-to-seven weeks to write the sequel; he approached his frequent collaborator and ''The Terminator'' co-writer William Wisher Jr. in late March 1990.<ref name=\"DOGHowitwasmade\"/><ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/><ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> They spent two weeks developing a [[film treatment]] based on Cameron's concept of forming a relationship between John Connor and the T-800, something Wisher initially believed was a joke.{{sfn|ShapiroE|1991|p=52}}<ref name=\"DOGHowitwasmade\"/> Their treatment departed from the \"science-fiction [[Slasher film|slasher]]\" of the original and focused on the unconventional family formed between Sarah, John, and the T-800, who would serve as a surrogate father. Cameron said this relationship is \"the heart of the movie\", comparing it with the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]]'s getting his heart in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/>\n\nCameron's initial concept had Skynet and the resistance each sending a T-800, both played by Schwarzenegger, into the past; one to kill John and the other to protect him. Wisher believed a fight between two identical Terminators would be boring.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/>{{sfn|ShapiroE|1991|pp=53\u201354}} The pair considered using a larger \"Super-Terminator\" but it did not interest them. They decided to adopt an idea Cameron had for ''The Terminator'', a liquid-metal Terminator that would look like an average human to contrast with Schwarzenegger's large frame.{{sfn|ShapiroE|1991|pp=53\u201354}} The first half of the story would end with the destruction of Skynet's T-800, forcing it to use the T-1000, its ultimate weapon.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/> Cameron considered removing the T-1000 before deciding to make it the only antagonist. The writers had the T-1000 take on the appearance of a police officer, which allowed it to operate with less suspicion, and made it ruthless and \"evil\" to contrast with the protagonist T-800.{{sfn|ShapiroE|1991|p=53}}<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/> Cameron said the policeman persona is thematically relevant because the T-1000 represents humans losing their compassion and becoming like Terminators.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/> Wisher found it challenging making the T-800 \"good\" without becoming non-threatening until he and Cameron decided to grant it the ability to learn, allowing it to develop emotions and character traits.{{sfn|ShapiroE|1991|p=53}}\n\nWisher, who worked at Cameron's home over the next four weeks, was given the first half of the treatment to develop, and Cameron the latter.{{sfn|ShapiroC|1991|p=33}}{{sfn|ShapiroE|1991|p=53}}{{sfn|ShapiroE|1991|p=54}}<ref name=\"DOGHowitwasmade\"/> Many pages were removed, including a \"convoluted\" subplot about Dyson and the T-1000 massacring a camp of survivalists who had helped Sarah. Cameron, who did not consider the budget while writing, had to remove some elaborate scenes, including a nine-minute opening set in 2029 that would have showed a time-travel machine being used.<ref name=\"EWJul121991Page3\"/>{{sfn|ShapiroE|1991|p=54}}<ref name=\"ScreenRantCuts\"/><!--CampScene-->{{sfn|Shapiro, Marc, July B|1991|p=39}}<!--CampScene--> Wisher and Cameron frequently conferred with special-effects studio [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) to determine if their ideas were realistically achievable.<ref name=\"DOGHowitwasmade\"/>\n\nCameron and Wisher rewatched ''The Terminator'' to determine where the characters would be years later. Cameron believed Sarah's knowledge of the future would isolate her, and cause her to train with military forces and survivalists to become a self-sufficient commando. She was written to have become emotionally cold and distant, effectively making her like a Terminator.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/> Sarah and John would have begun the film together but to increase the tension, John is placed with a foster family.{{sfn|ShapiroE|1991|p=53}}{{sfn|Shapiro, Marc, July B|1991|p=38}} In a 2021 interview, Cameron stated that the decision to focus on John was inspired by the 1985 [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] song \"[[Russians (song)|Russians]]\", a plea against [[mutual assured destruction]] that focuses on the potential suffering of innocent families, stating that \"I remember sitting there once, high on [[MDMA|E]], writing notes for ''Terminator'', and I was struck by Sting\u2019s song, that 'I hope the Russians love their children too'. And I thought, 'You know what? The idea of a nuclear war is just so antithetical to life itself'. That's where the kid came from\".<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/> Cameron wanted to make the Terminator a protagonist because he found it uninteresting to repeat the character of ''The Terminator''.{{sfn|ShapiroE|1991|p=52}} The T-800's dialogue was kept brief; its intent is mainly portrayed through Schwarzenegger's physicality. The catchphrase \"[[Hasta la vista, baby]]\" was something Wisher and Cameron said after their telephone calls.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/><ref name=\"HastaEsquire\"/> Wisher and Cameron spent about three days refining the script; the printed copy was still warm when Cameron boarded Carolco's charter jet to visit the studio's stars and filmmakers in [[Cannes]] in early May 1990, where ''Terminator 2'' was announced.<ref name=\"DOGHowitwasmade\"/><ref name=\"EmpireMostExpensive\"/><ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/> Schwarzenegger read the script on the plane but struggled to understand some of Cameron's intent, asking \"What is 'polyalloy'?\" He also took issue with his character's not killing people (which is antithetical to his action-hero image) and did not understand how to portray the difference between his formerly ruthless character turned protector.

Furlong had no acting experience and was discovered by Finn at the [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys & Girls Club]] in [[Pasadena]]. Cameron described Furlong as having a \"surliness, an intelligence, just a question of pulling it out\". Furlong secured the role at his last audition; there were about 100 other prospects.

Fiedel and Cameron wanted the musical tone to be \"warmer\" due to its focus on a nobler Terminator and young John. Fiedel experimented with sounds and shared them with Cameron for feedback.<ref name=\"DOGFiedel\"/>\n\nWhile ''The Terminator'' score had mainly used oscillators and synthesizers, Fiedel recorded real instruments and modified their sounds. He developed a library of sounds for characters such as the T-1000, whose theme was created by sampling brass-instrument players warming up and improvising. Fiedel said to the players, \"You're an insane asylum. You're a bedlam of instruments.\" He slowed down the resulting sample and lowered the pitch, describing it as \"artificial intelligent monks chanting\". Cameron considered the \"atonal\" sound \"too avant-garde\" for him but Fiedel justified it as an accompaniment to Cameron, who was making a film \"people have never seen before\".<ref name=\"DOGFiedel\"/>\n\nTri-Star asked Schwarzenegger to arrange a tie-in music video and theme song for the film; he chose to work with rock band [[Guns N' Roses]] because they were popular and there was \"a rose in the movie and bloody guns\". The band offered the use of \"[[You Could Be Mine]]\", the debut single from their album ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]'' (1991).

Release dates repeatedly changed as studios attempted to avoid strong competition and maximize their films' successes at a time when the cost of film production had increased 20% in a year, in part due to costly salaries for stars who also commanded a percentage of the film's profits, and declining revenues from box-office receipts, video sales, and television-network deals.<ref name=\"DOG1991Retro\"/><ref name=\"LATimes1991March31\"/> Films scheduled for release included ''[[City Slickers]]'', ''[[The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear]]'', ''[[Only the Lonely (film)|Only the Lonely]]'', ''[[Hudson Hawk]]'', ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'', ''[[What About Bob?]]'', and ''[[Point Break]]''.

Tristar contributed about $20{{nbs}}million for marketing, which included a $150,000 teaser trailer that was directed by Winston and depicts the construction of a T-800. Trailers ran for six months before the film's release; Tristar incentivized cinema staff to play it frequently by offering chances to win ''Terminator 2''-branded goods and tickets to the premiere.

In it, Sarah and John attempt to stop Cyberdyne, which has developed Skynet.

Cameron said: \"Sure, there's going to be big, thunderous action sequences, but the heart of the movie is that relationship\", comparing it with the Tin Man getting a heart in ''The Wizard of Oz''.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/> Both ''Terminator 2'' and Cameron's earlier film ''Aliens'' focus on compassion and parental figures; ''Aliens''{{'}} central character Ripley serves as a surrogate mother to an orphaned girl in contrast to an alien queen and her brood, while ''Terminator 2'' depicts the T-800's relentless protection of his ward against the equally relentless T-1000.<ref name=\"DOGHowToSequels\"/> The T-800 is designed to emulate humans for infiltration purposes but as it grows and evolves, its emotions become real and it learns from John to feel grief. The T-800 chooses to sacrifice its life to ensure the survival of everyone else.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/><ref name=\"DigitalSpyReviewed\"/><ref name=\"LATimesViolence\"/> In 1991 essayist [[Robert Bly]] wrote elderly men were not offering suitable role models for young men, and in ''Terminator 2'', Sarah denounces the many men in her past who failed to be a father for John, except for the T-800. Once its role is complete, the T-800 leaves John for his own good after stating it lacks the emotions John must rely on.{{sfn|Alegre|1998|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nWhile John teaches the T-800 about humanity, his biological mother Sarah has become less human because of her knowledge about the future. Cameron said: \"She's a sad character\u2014a tragic character{{nbs}}... she believes that everyone she meets, talks to, or interacts with will be dead very soon\".<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/><ref name=\"LATimesSummerSpecial\"/> This theme of machine-like humans links with Cameron's and Wisher's choice to make the T-1000 appear as a police officer because thematically they believed it represents humans who should have empathy for others becoming more machine-like and detached from their emotions.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/><ref name=\"LATimesSummerSpecial\"/> The SWAT team at Cyberdyne shoots Dyson, an African American, without warning. ''Cinephilia'' described Dyson as the most-human character in the film; according to them, he is an intelligent, optimistic, family man who represents real-world encounters between police forces and people of color, compared to their encounter with the Caucasian T-800, during which they warn him before opening fire.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/> The [[Rodney King|1991 police beating of Rodney King]] was captured on the same videotape a civilian used to capture the filming of the biker bar scenes.<ref name=\"LATimesViolence\"/>\n\nFollowing her escape from the state hospital, Sarah appears to embrace John but is actually checking him for injuries, forgoing any emotional attachment for the practicality of ensuring his survival and bringing about his destiny as a future leader.<ref name=\"DOGHowitwasmade\"/> The T-800 is portrayed as a better parent than Sarah, offering him undivided attention while Sarah remains distant and focused on the future rather than the present.{{sfn|Warren|2003|p=29}} Philosophy professor Richard T. McClelland notes Sarah acceptance of the T-800 as John's surrogate father is such she leaves it in control of John when she leaves to kill Dyson.{{sfn|McClelland|2016|pp=71\u201372}} Sarah's dream about the nuclear holocaust that will kill six billion people, including her son, incites her to kill Dyson before he can complete the work that will bring about Skynet but when the moment comes, she is unable to fully forsake her humanity and murder him with no emotion. Cameron described this as a question of humanity's worth if we abandon it to win the battle for its existence.<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/><ref name=\"LATimesViolence\"/> Compared to the bleak, nihilistic theme of ''The Terminator'', ''Terminator 2'' emphasizes the concept of free will and the value of human life. Schwarzenegger quoted the film's line \"no fate but what we make\", saying people have control over their own destinies.<ref name=\"DOG20YrRetro\"/><ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/>\n\n===Violence===\nOn its release, reviewers were critical of ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day''{{'s}} message about preserving peace through violence; Owen Gleiberman stated \"reckless indifference\" to human life is intrinsic to the film but the T-800 maiming people rather than killing them potentially condemns victims of violence to a life of pain.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"ReviewAustinChron\"/><ref name=\"ReviewNYTimes\"/><ref name=\"ReviewNewsweek\"/><ref name=\"ReviewWaPoBrown\"/><ref name=\"ReviewTheNewYorker\"/><ref name=\"ReviewTime\"/><ref name=\"ReviewEW\"/>}} Cameron described the film as the \"world's most violent anti-war movie\", and said it is about people struggling with their own violent natures.<ref name=\"LATimesSummerSpecial\"/><ref name=\"LATimesViolence\"/> In particular, Cameron had been concerned by the original antagonist T-800's status as a cultural icon and power fantasy as a lethal, unstoppable force of strength and power, and chose to redefine it in ''Terminator 2'', retaining the power fantasy without taking lives.<ref name=\"LATimesViolence\"/> ''Cinephilia'' said it is not morally possible to recover from killing people so ''Terminator 2'' is about redeeming the T-800 and Sarah.<ref name=\"Cinephilia\"/>\n\n===Masculinity and femininity===\nAfter the success of ''Aliens'', the growth of female-led action films reflected the increase in women assuming non-traditional roles and the division between professional critics\u2014who perceive a masculinization of the female hero\u2014and audiences who embrace characters regardless of gender.{{sfn|Brown|1996|pp=52,69}} The hyper-masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] were replaced with independent women who are capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such ''Terminator 2'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=52}} These female characters often perform stereotypical male actions, however, and have muscular physiques rather than feminine, \"soft\" bodies.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=60}} Professor Jeffrey Brown considers Hamilton's undershirt to be symbolic of typically male action heroes such as [[John McClane]] and [[John Rambo]], as well as females displaying masculine traits such as [[Rachel McLish]] in ''[[Aces: Iron Eagle III]]''.{{sfn|Brown|1996|p=63\u201364}}\n\nDespite the emphasis on strong femininity, Hamilton's character remains secondary to Schwarzenegger's; Sarah's efforts to defeat the T-1000 fall short until the last-minute intervention of the T-800. Victoria Warren said this allows the female character to be strong enough to be admired but not strong enough to undermine the male protagonist's masculinity.{{sfn|Warren|2003|p=28}} Amanda Fernbach and Thomas B. Byers said the rigid form of the T-800 represents reactionary masculinity that is in direct opposition to the [[Gender bender|gender-bending]] T-1000, which represents a post-modern, fluid nature that is outside traditional norms and in opposition to patriarchy and the preservation of the traditional family.{{sfn|Fernbach|2000|p=242}}\n\n===American industry and individualism===\nAuthor Mark Duckenfield said ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' can be seen as an unintended allegory for the decline of United States industries against successful Japanese technology firms with the cutting-edge T-1000 representing Japan against the older, less-advanced T-800. The U.S. industries, which were sometimes seen as villains during the economic boom of the 1980s, are seen as more sympathetic in the face of obsolescence, just as the T-800 is presented as friendlier and still powerful but no longer overwhelmingly so. Duckenfield considers the final scene, which takes place in a steel mill\u2014a place of American industry\u2014symbolic.{{sfn|Duckenfield|1991|pp=2\u20135,13}}\n\nAccording to Warren, ''Terminator 2'' reflects [[Cold War]] American values that emphasized principles of American culture, in particular individualism and rejection of government intervention. The institutions the film's protagonists should be able to rely on, such as the government, the police, and technology, are the ones attempting to stop them because they do not believe in the protagonists' doomsday prophecy.{{sfn|Warren|2003|p=25}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Cultural influence===\nWith a $94\u2013102{{nbs}}million budget, ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' became the most expensive movie made in its time,<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/><ref name=\"EmpireMostExpensive\"/><ref name=\"GuardiantMostExpensive\" /><ref name=\"EmpireT2at30\"/> and it remains Schwarzenegger's highest-grossing film.<ref name=\"THRSchwarzHighest\"/> It had a significant impact on filmmaking; ''[[Den of Geek]]'' described it as one of the most influential blockbusters since the thriller ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"DOG20YrRetro\"/> Cameron and special-effects artist and supervisor Dennis Muren said the groundbreaking special effects in ''Terminator 2'' demonstrated the possibilities of computer generated effects and without it, effects-focused films such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) would not have been possible.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/><ref name=\"GuardiantMostExpensive\"/><ref name=\"ActionTimeOut\"/><ref name=\"BestTerminatorCBR\"/><ref name=\"EmpireT2at30\"/>}} Various publications have referenced ''Terminator 2''{{'s}} influence on special effects, describing it as the most important special-effects film since ''[[Tron]]'' (1982), and began the era of reliance on CGI effects for films such as ''Jurassic Park'' and ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999).<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReviewed\"/><ref name=\"DOG20YrRetro\"/><ref name=\"ActionCollider\"/><ref name=\"GRaderMakingOf\"/><ref name=\"AVClubCGI\"/> In 2007 the [[Visual Effects Society]], an entertainment-industry organization of visual-effects practitioners, named ''Terminator 2'' as the 14th-most-influential visual-effects film of all time, and the T-1000 is listed by [[Guinness World Records]] as the \"first major blockbuster movie character generated using computers\".<ref name=\"Guinness\"/><ref name=\"Ves2007\"/><ref name=\"FilmSiteVES\"/> According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', however, the film's \"groundbreaking\" effects led to \"CGI laziness\", a reliance on computer graphics over practical effects, stunts, and craft.<ref name=\"GuardiantMostExpensive\"/> A 2014 ''Entertainment Weekly'' article said ''Terminator 2'' contributed to the contemporary Hollywood high-budget, science-fiction epic film, and a reliance on turning films into franchises targeted at young audiences and broad demographics.<ref name=\"EW2014\"/>\n\nAlongside her appearance in ''The Terminator'', Hamilton's Sarah Connor became regarded as one of the greatest and most-influential cinematic female action heroes{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"DigitalSpyReviewed\"/><ref name=\"HeroinesParade\"/><ref name=\"HeroinesVulture\"/><ref name=\"HeroinesRT\"/><ref name=\"HeroinesScreenRant\"/><ref name=\"HeroinesVultuer2\"/>}} and an iconic character.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"TheRingerOral\"/><ref name=\"HeroinesIconDOG\"/><ref name=\"HeroinesVultuer2\"/><ref name=\"HeroinesIconCBR\"/><ref name=\"HeroinesIconVanity\"/><ref name=\"HeroinesIconNYT\"/><ref name=\"DOG1991Summer\"/>}} Patrick's T-1000 is considered one of the most-iconic and best cinematic villains;{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"VillainsScreenRant\"/><ref name=\"VillainsSyFy\"/><ref name=\"VillainsCollider\"/><ref name=\"VillainsEmpire\"/><ref name=\"VillainsInsider\"/><ref name=\"VillainsPaste\"/>}} Patrick made cameo appearances as the T-1000 in ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992) and Schwarzenegger's ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' (1993).<ref name=\"AVClubPatrick\"/><ref name=\"PatrickUSAToday\"/><ref name=\"VillainsScreenRant\"/> In ''Last Action Hero'', Stallone replaces Schwarzenegger as the T-800 on the ''Terminator 2'' poster.<ref name=\"MensHealthLastAction\"/> The T-800's line \"Hasta la vista, baby\" is considered an iconic piece of movie dialogue that is often quoted.
