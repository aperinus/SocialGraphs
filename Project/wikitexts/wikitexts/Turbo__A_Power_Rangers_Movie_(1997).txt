It is the second installment in ''Power Rangers'' film series after ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]'' and was produced by [[Saban Entertainment]] and [[Toei Company|Toei Company, Ltd.]], and was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> The film stars [[Johnny Yong Bosch]], [[Nakia Burrise]], [[Steve Cardenas]], [[Jason David Frank]], [[Austin St. John]], [[Catherine Sutherland]], [[Jason Narvy]], [[Paul Schrier]], [[Hilary Shepard|Hilary Shepard Turner]], [[Amy Jo Johnson]], and [[Blake Foster]].\n\nTaking place after the events of ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'', the new cast and characters from the film become cast members of ''Zeo''' s successor series, ''[[Power Rangers Turbo]]'', with the film's events leading into the successor series. As with its television season, the film used concepts and costumes from the Japanese [[Super Sentai]] series ''[[Gekisou Sentai Carranger]]''. Sets and costumes created for original characters in the film were later used in the television series, with the film's climactic antagonist Maligore being reused for the evil Dark Specter in the subsequent ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'' season.\n\nThe film was released on March 28, 1997, to generally unfavorable reviews. It was criticized for its visual effects and campiness, but critics praised the performance of its cast.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nOn the planet Liaria, a wizard named Lerigot is being hunted down by [[Divatox]]; an intergalactic space pirate, who is seeking his golden key to traverse an inter-dimensional gateway and enter into matrimony with [[Maligore]], an imprisoned demon who promises her great riches and power. Lerigot escapes Divatox's forces and travels to Earth in search of [[Zordon]] and his friend [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]], but arrives in Africa by accident. Weakened by the sun's ultraviolet rays, Lerigot meets a tribe of chimpanzees and wanders off with them. Meanwhile, Divatox heads for Earth in pursuit.\n\nIn Angel Grove, Rocky DeSantos, Adam Park, and [[Tommy Oliver]] are training for a charity fighting competition to save the Youth Shelter, when Rocky accidentally injures his back. Katherine Hillard and Tanya Sloan arrive with Justin Stewart, a kid who admires Rocky and frequents the shelter. As Rocky is rushed to the hospital, Justin follows the group and learns they are Power Rangers. Zordon sends Tommy and Katherine to search for Lerigot. They manage to find him and return to the Power Chamber.\n\nSearching for two human sacrifices to revive Maligore, Divatox's nephew [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Elgar|Elgar]], abducts [[Bulk and Skull|Farkus \"Bulk\" Bulkmeier and Eugene \"Skull\" Skullovitch]], but Divatox rejects them for not being pure of heart. Upon finding [[Kimberly Hart]] and [[Jason Lee Scott]], who are [[scuba diving]] nearby, Divatox captures them. While recovering, Lerigot is contacted by Divatox, who has captured his family and demands he surrender himself. Divatox also uses Kimberly and Jason to pressure the Rangers. At the exchange site, Elgar tricks the Rangers and captures Lerigot.\n\nZordon and Alpha create new powers for the Rangers to defeat Divatox. With these new [[Power Rangers: Turbo|Turbo]] powers and new vehicular Turbo Zords, the Rangers travel across the desert to a ship called the Ghost Galleon. They are joined by Justin, who has received Rocky's Blue Ranger powers while Rocky is recovering in the hospital. On Divatox's submarine, Jason and Kimberly come up with a plan to escape, but though Bulk, Skull, and Kimberly escape the sub, Jason is trapped and left behind.\n\nAfter Divatox and the Rangers traverse the Nemesis Triangle and reach the island where Maligore is, Divatox torpedoes the Ghost Galleon and the Rangers narrowly escape. Kimberly is recaptured and brought to Divatox by the tribal natives of the island who worship Maligore as their god. At the temple in the volcano, the Rangers fail to free Jason and Kimberly before they are possessed by Maligore and attack the Rangers mercilessly, but the Rangers succeed in freeing Lerigot and his wife Yara, who undo the possession.\n\nAngered, Divatox sacrifices her nephew and successfully revives Maligore. The Rangers combined their Turbo Zords and form the Turbo Megazord to fight Maligore. They defeat him as Divatox and [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Rygog|Rygog]] flee, vowing vengeance. The Rangers pick up Jason, Kimberly, Lerigot, Yara, Bulk and Skull and return to Angel Grove. At the competition, Jason takes Rocky's place, and they win the fight, earning the money to save the shelter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] as [[Adam Park]] / Green Turbo Ranger, a martial artist originally from Stone Canyon and formerly, the second Black Mighty Morphin Power Ranger and Green Zeo Ranger.

He becomes the Blue Turbo Ranger in Rocky's place and pilots the Mountain Blaster Turbozord.\n\nAdditionally, Gregg Bullock reprises his role as Lt. Jerome Stone from ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]''. [[Richard Genelle]] reprises his role as Ernie, the Angel Grove Gym and Juice Bar's owner; Winston Richard plays [[Zordon]], an inter-dimensional wizard and the Rangers' mentor, with [[Robert L. Manahan|Bob Manahan]] voicing the character; and Donene Kistler plays [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]], a robot from Edenoi and Zordon's assistant, with [[Richard Steven Horvitz|Richard Wood]] voicing Alpha 5. Jon Simanton portrays Lerigot, a wizard who holds a magical key that can open portals to worlds and realms, while [[Lex Lang]] provided the voice for the character. Divatox's henchmen includes Lang also voices Rygog, one of Divatox's henchmen. J.B. Levine voice Yara and Bethel, Lerigot's wife and daughter. Danny Wayne Stallcup physically portrays [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Elgar|Elgar]], Divatox's dimwitted nephew, while [[Derek Stephen Prince|David Umansky]] provides his voice. Mike Deak portrays [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Maligore|Maligore]], Divatox's fianc\u00e9 and true antagonist of this movie. Carla Perez reprises her role as [[Rita Repulsa]], a sorceress who has fought the Power Rangers in the past, with [[Barbara Goodson]] providing her voice.\n\n==Production==\nAs opposed to the  CGI Megazord used in the first Power Rangers film, this sequel uses the actual costume of the Turbo Megazord, appearing in American footage (the main series would rely on the ''Carranger'' footage). According to a 2013 post on Johnny Yong Bosch's Facebook page, the original script called for a lengthy underwater battle using the Zeo Ranger powers, wherein the Power Rangers emerge with tattered costumes. The unused plot would also explained how the Turbo powers were created. It was also originally scripted that Billy Cranston (the original Blue Mighty Morphin Ranger) had created the Turbo powers with Zordon and Alpha 5. While this plot element was ultimately dropped from the theatrical release, the concept of torn outfits would be used for the ''Turbo'' season finale. Also, whereas Hilary Shepard Turner appears as Divatox in the film, by the time filming began for the TV series, she had taken maternity leave, thus being replaced by Carol Hoyt. In the 26th episode \"The Darkest Day\" seven episodes after the four Veteran Rangers resign and transfer their powers to a new team (filmed after a hiatus of several months), Shepard resumed the role of Divatox, continuing through ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]''.\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = March 18, 1997\n| recorded   = 1996\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 41:05\n| label      = [[Hollywood Records]]<br /> Saban Records\n| producer   = Ron Kenan <br />Howard Paar\n| chronology = Power Rangers Film Soundtrack\n| prev_title = [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie: Original Motion Picture Score]]\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n'''''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)''''' is the licensed soundtrack to the film.
