The supporting cast includes [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]], [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]], and [[Jan Niklas]]. Based on the 1982 novel ''[[The House of the Spirits|La Casa de los Esp\u00edritus]]'' by [[Isabel Allende]], the film follows three generations of women from a Chilean family during the country\u2019s [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|military dictatorship]].\n\nAlthough the film won several awards in [[Cinema of Europe|Europe]], including Best Film at the [[Lola Awards]] from the [[Deutsche Filmakademie|German Film Academy]] and the [[Robert Award]] from the [[Danish Film Academy]], in [[American cinema|America]] it was regarded as a critical and commercial failure.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story is narrated by Blanca Trueba, a young woman from a powerful Chilean family.\n\n=== 1926 ===\nBlanca's mother, Clara del Valle is a child from a well-off family in [[Santiago]] whose father is running for the Senate. Clara possesses [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] abilities and foresees her own marriage to Esteban Trueba, a miner.\n\nEsteban uses the gold he found from mining to buy a [[hacienda]], Tres Mar\u00edas. He employs natives to work as peasants on the dilapidated land, eventually turning Tres Mar\u00edas into a successful estate through his use of brute force. One day while horseback riding through the countryside, he sees a peasant girl, Pancha Garc\u00eda. Esteban rapes Pancha, resulting in the illegitimate birth of a boy. He also spends nights with Tr\u00e1nsito, a local prostitute to whom he lends money so she can start a new career in the capital.\n\n=== 1946 ===\nTwenty years later, Esteban\u2019s sister F\u00e9rula informs him that their ailing mother has died. At his mother\u2019s funeral, Esteban sees a grown Clara and reacquaints himself with her. The couple marry, and Clara and F\u00e9rula become especially close, with Clara allowing F\u00e9rula to come live with her and her new husband at Tres Mar\u00edas.\n\nClara eventually gives birth to a girl, naming her Blanca. One day, Pancha Garc\u00eda appears at the family estate with her now teenaged son, Esteban Garc\u00eda, asking his father for money. Esteban Trueba gives them some money but harshly turns them away. Esteban\u2019s rejection leads his son to nurse a resentment against his father and Blanca.\n\nMeanwhile, Blanca befriends one of the peasant children, Pedro Tercero, the young son of Esteban's foreman Segundo. Esteban disapproves of his daughter playing with a peasant boy and sends her to a [[boarding school]].\n\n=== 1962 ===\nAfter graduating from boarding school, Blanca returns to Tres Mar\u00edas and reunites with Pedro, meeting him by the river every night. F\u00e9rula continues to live with the family and has become a rival to her brother for Clara\u2019s affections. Esteban throws F\u00e9rula out of the house when he catches her and Clara asleep in the same bed. Before leaving, F\u00e9rula curses Esteban to eternal loneliness.\n\nEsteban catches Pedro preaching revolutionary ideas that are critical of wealthy landowners like him to the peasant workers. He punishes Pedro with a whipping and banishment from Tres Mar\u00edas. That night at dinner, Clara and Blanca see a vision of F\u00e9rula while having dinner. F\u00e9rula kisses Clara on the forehead before calmly walking out. Realizing F\u00e9rula has died, Clara drives into town to find F\u00e9rula dead in her modest home. In a moment alone with F\u00e9rula, Clara tells her how much she and Blanca miss her, and how proud she would be of Blanca.\n\nBlanca continues to meet Pedro in secret. Jean de Satigny, a French nobleman who aspires to go into business with Esteban, sees Blanca and Pedro in a tryst at the river and rats her out to her father. Esteban punishes Blanca by whipping her and vows to go after Pedro. He strikes Clara when she points out his hypocrisy\u2014having himself slept with women not of his own class\u2014after which Clara vows never to speak to him again. She leaves Tres Mar\u00edas with Blanca to live in Santiago.\n\nEsteban offers a monetary reward for anyone who can reveal Pedro's whereabouts to him. Esteban Garc\u00eda, unrecognized by his father, aids in helping to find Pedro. Pedro is able to escape from Esteban, who declines to give a reward to his son. Esteban later learns Blanca is pregnant with Pedro's child, and he goes to her house to falsely tell her that he murdered Pedro. Clara makes Esteban leave and reassures Blanca that Pedro is indeed alive, but they won't be reunited for some time because he needs to flee to safety. Years later, Esteban goes to Clara and apologizes for his actions. Though she maintains some distance from him, she does allow him to meet their seven-year-old granddaughter Alba and to be a part of her and Blanca\u2019s lives again.\n\n=== 1973 ===\nEsteban is now a senator in the [[Conservatism|Conservative Party]], while Pedro is a leader with the [[Socialism|People's Front]]. Despite Esteban\u2019s success, he is lonely and finds comfort in the arms of Tr\u00e1nsito, who now runs a high-class prostitution establishment. Esteban believes his party will win the election as usual, but the People\u2019s Front ends up gaining control of the government. Clara passes away after gently explaining to Alba that she has always been in touch with spirits on the other side and will be in contact with the rest of the family.\n\nA conspiracy between Conservative Party members and the military leads to a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the military seizes control of the country. Under military control, people associated with the People's Party are captured and even killed. The police come and arrest Blanca for her association with Pedro Tercero. Before Blanca is taken away, she tells Esteban that Pedro is the love of her life, just as Clara was his. She appeals to Esteban to use his political influence to help find asylum for Pedro outside Chile so the three of them can be a family. In the coming days, Blanca is tortured and sexually abused by her half-brother, Esteban Garc\u00eda, who had joined the military with his father's help.\n\nEsteban decides to honor his daughter's wishes and helps to find exile for Pedro in Canada. He also turns to Tr\u00e1nsito, who as an influential [[Procuring (prostitution)|Madam]] has connections to high-level military figures, to help free Blanca. One morning, a beaten Blanca finally arrives back at her home. A grateful Esteban tells her that Pedro is waiting for her and Alba in Canada, and hopes his help can make up for the damage his actions wrought on his family.\n\n=== Epilogue ===\nBlanca and the elderly Esteban return to Tres Mar\u00edas with Alba. Esteban is finally visited by Clara's spirit, who has come to help the old man on to the next world. Blanca sits outside and ponders her life, looking forward to a future with Pedro and their daughter. She reflects on how she does not want to live her life with anger or hatred\u2014instead, she wishes to move forward and be happy.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Clara del Valle Trueba\n** [[Grace Gummer]] as young Clara\n* [[Glenn Close]] as F\u00e9rula Trueba\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Esteban Trueba\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Blanca Trueba\n** [[Hannah Taylor-Gordon]] as young Blanca\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Pedro Tercero\n** Josh Maguire as young Pedro\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as N\u00edvea del Valle\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Severo del Valle\n* [[Maria Conchita Alonso]] as Tr\u00e1nsito\n* [[Sarita Choudhury]] as Pancha Garc\u00eda\n* [[Jan Niklas]] as Count Jean de Satigny\n* [[Vincent Gallo]] as Esteban Garc\u00eda\n* [[Teri Polo]] as Rosa del Valle\n* [[Joaqu\u00edn Mart\u00ednez]] as Segundo\n* [[Miriam Colon]] as Nana\n* Sasha Hanau as Alba\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nAuthor [[Isabel Allende]] received numerous offers from producers and agents to adapt her novel ''[[The House of the Spirits]]'' upon publication in 1982, but did not agree to [[Option (filmmaking)|option]] the work until Danish filmmaker [[Bille August]] convinced her with his vision for the film.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Simpson |first=Blaise |date=1994-03-27 |title=MOVIES : The Mystical Isabel Allende |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-03-27-ca-38952-story.html |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |language=en-US}}</ref> In January 1993, [[Miramax]] acquired North American distribution rights for the film.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cohn |first=Lawrence |date=1993-01-27 |title=Miramax picks up 'Spirits' |url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/miramax-picks-up-spirits-103412/ |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nControversy occurred over the casting of predominantly white English-speaking actors in a [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] period film.
