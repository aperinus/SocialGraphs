The plane makes an emergency landing and passengers must wait until a piece of equipment is delivered.\n\nMike and Terry visit his elderly aunt Ginny on the isle of [[Moorea]]. They see each other with new eyes and fall in love. When they reach [[New York City]], they agree to reunite at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] in three months' time. Terry breaks up with her fianc\u00e9 Ken Allen, as does Mike with his, Lynn Weaver.\n\nTerry finds work as a singer, mostly in advertisements. Mike quits his job as a Los Angeles television sports announcer. He finds work as a coach at a small school and also returns to his true vocation as a painter. One of his pieces is of Terry in prayer from their idyllic day on the island.\n\nComing to their rendezvous, Terry, in her haste, is struck down by a car while crossing a street. Gravely injured, she is rushed to the hospital. Mike, waiting for her at the observation deck at the top of the building, is unaware of the accident. After many hours, he finally concedes at midnight that she has rejected him.\n\nNow unable to walk, Terry refuses to contact Mike, wanting to conceal her disability. Instead, she finds a job as a music teacher. Six months after the accident, she sees Mike with his former fianc\u00e9e at a holiday concert featuring [[Ray Charles]], which Terry is attending with her former boyfriend. Mike does not notice her condition because she is seated. Each can only manage a hello.\n\nChristmas Eve arrives and Mike makes a surprise visit, claiming to have come across her address while looking up another name in a telephone directory. Although he steers the conversation to make her explain her actions, Terry merely dodges the subject, never leaving the couch on which she sits.\n\nAbout to leave her life for good, Mike mentions the painting that he had done of her, which that very afternoon had been given away to a woman who admired it. He is about to point out that the woman was in a wheelchair when he suddenly pauses. Mike walks into Terry's bedroom and sees his painting hanging on the wall. He now knows why she did not keep their appointment. They embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Warren Beatty]] ...  Mike Gambril\n*[[Annette Bening]] ...  Terry McKay\n*[[Katharine Hepburn]] ...

The name of Terry McKay's character remained the same in all three films, while a different one was chosen for each of the three leading men.\n\n''Love Affair'' was Hepburn's first big-screen appearance in nearly 10 years<ref>See [[Katharine Hepburn film and theatre credits#Feature films|Hepburn's filmography]].</ref> (although she had made several TV movies in this time) and marked her last appearance in cinema. It includes the only time that she ever said the word \"fuck\" on-screen. Beatty personally lobbied 86-year-old Hepburn to appear in the film. He rented a house for her in [[Los Angeles]] and had her referred to a special [[Dermatology|dermatologist]], but she did not give a definitive answer until the day of filming. [[Luise Rainer]] was also considered for the role.<ref>{{cite web|title= IMDb trivia|publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]]|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110391/trivia|access-date=2012-01-04}}</ref>\n \nFilming took place in [[New York City]], Los Angeles and on the islands of [[Tahiti]] and [[Moorea]] in [[French Polynesia]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe remake was neither a critical nor a commercial success at the box office.
