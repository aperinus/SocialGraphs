The film received positive reviews and was nominated for several awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] and the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature]].\n\n==Summary==\nThe film examines the modern [[food industry]], and raises alarms about both the [[Meat industry|industrial production of meat]] (chicken, beef, and pork) and [[Intensive farming|the modern methods used to grow grains and vegetables]] (primarily corn and soybeans). It discusses the dominance of the American food market by a handful of huge corporations, which work to keep consumers from being aware of how their food is produced and are largely successful in their efforts to avoid such things as stronger [[food safety]] laws, the unionization of their workers, and additional [[food labeling regulations]]. These companies promote unhealthy food consumption habits among the American public and then supply cheap, inadequately safety-tested, increasingly [[genetic engineering|genetically-modified]] food that is produced and transported using methods that exploit livestock, employees, farmers, and the environment and use large amounts of [[petroleum product]]s.<ref name=\"Severson\"/><ref name=\"Troubling\">\"New Film Offers Troubling View of US Food Industry.\" ''[[Associated Press]].''
