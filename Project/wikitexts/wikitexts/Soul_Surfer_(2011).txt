The film stars [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Helen Hunt]], [[Dennis Quaid]], and [[Lorraine Nicholson]] with [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Kevin Sorbo]], [[Sonya Balmores]], [[Branscombe Richmond]], and [[Craig T. Nelson]].\n\nFilming took place in [[Hawaii]] in early 2010, with additional filming taking place in Tahiti in August 2010. ''Soul Surfer'' was released in theaters on {{nowrap|April 8}}, 2011 in the United States and Canada by a partnership between [[FilmDistrict]] and [[TriStar Pictures]], and was a commercial success, earning $47.1 million<ref name=\"bom\" /> on a $18 million budget, but received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->\nIn 2003, 13-year-old [[Bethany Hamilton]] lives in [[Kauai]], [[Hawaii]] with her parents Tom and Cheri, and two older brothers, Noah and Timmy. All are surfers, but she and her best friend [[Alana Blanchard]] have grown up with a passion for the sport and have competed together most of their childhood.\n\nWhen Bethany and Alana place first and third respectively at a competition, their church youth ministry leader, Sarah Hill, is disappointed Bethany and Alana have to withdraw from a planned mission trip to Mexico in order to train for the Hawaiian Island Regionals contest. On Halloween, Tom goes to the hospital for knee surgery, and the girls go surfing with Alana's father Holt and brother Byron. As Bethany dangles her left arm in the water while she is talking to Alana, a [[tiger shark]] unexpectedly attacks and bites off her left arm just below the shoulder. Holt, Alana, and Byron get her out of the water where Holt makes a [[tourniquet]] out of his swimshirt to put on her while Byron calls [[9-1-1|911]] as Cheri is also informed. An ambulance meets them on the way to the hospital. Just before starting Tom's knee surgery, Dr. David Rovinsky is called to the emergency room to treat Bethany. Besides losing her left arm, she also lost over 60% of her blood and Dr. Rovinsky calls her survival a miracle.\n\nThe onslaught of paparazzi also proves to be a great strain on her family and their privacy. The Hamiltons are grateful to Holt for his quick and active thinking and decisive action that saved her life. Her injury prevents her from participating in the Rip Curl photo shoots, but she wishes Alana well.\n\nLocal fisherman eventually catch and kill the same shark that bit Bethany's arm off, much to Tom's satisfaction when he tests the size of its mouth with the bite size on Bethany's surfboard.\n\nBethany perseveres and after a recuperation period, gets back in the water, and learns to surf with one arm. ''[[Inside Edition]]'' offers to provide a prosthetic one that is cosmetically perfect and has bendable joints, in exchange for an interview. She rejects it when she learns it will not help her surf as it is not weight bearing, as a result of the size of her arm stump.\n\nBethany eventually re-enters the competition, telling rival Malina not to go easy on her, and angrily rejects a five-minute head start offered by the judges. She does not perform well because she cannot stay on the board long enough to go out and catch a competitive wave so Malina wins. Disappointed at this loss, she decides to give up competitive surfing and her friendship with Alana is strained following an argument.\n\nBethany decides to surprise Sarah by joining the youth group on another mission trip to help the people of [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], Thailand who were devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. She joins her youth group to help the Thai children get over their fear of the ocean. They are understandably afraid of the water, including a little boy. She decides to go into it with a surfboard, hoping this will coax him into it. It works, and the realization that she can use her gift to inspire people motivates her to take up surfing again.\n\nTom, who believes that Bethany possesses a great surfer's instinct for sensing when the best waves will form, rigs a handle on her surfboard which she can use to prevent falling off while paddling out to the waves, which is not prohibited by the competition's rules. Bethany trains for the competition while rekindling her friendship with Alana. She enters the national championship. During the competition, she performs respectably, though she is still chasing third place. Suddenly, with only minutes left on the clock, the waves die down and all the surfers can only loiter, waiting for the waves to start back up. Tom's belief in his daughter's instinct is proven when she is the only one to sense a big wave forming, and she alone paddles out. When it forms, the others cannot get out in time and she catches it just as the horn sounds. If it is in time, she will win, but the judges rule that the time has expired. Malina is the winner, but she has finally gotten over her differences with Bethany, inviting her up on the platform to share her victory.\n\nSubsequently, Bethany lets the reporters interview her. One asks her what she would do if given the chance to undo the loss of her arm. She says that she would still lose it because she can embrace more people now than she ever could with both.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[AnnaSophia Robb]] as [[Bethany Hamilton]]\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Cheri Hamilton\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Thomas \"Tom\" Hamilton\n* [[Carrie Underwood]] as Sarah Hill\n* [[Kevin Sorbo]] as Holt Blanchard\n* [[Ross Thomas (actor)|Ross Thomas]] as Noah Hamilton\n* [[Chris Brochu]] as Timmy Hamilton\n* [[Lorraine Nicholson]] as [[Alana Blanchard]]\n* [[Jeremy Sumpter]] as Atty.

During Hamilton's media attention, the father of Bethany's friends Chantilly and Tiffany, Roy \"Dutch\" Hofstetter, became the Hamilton family's media manager. Hofstetter, in February 2004, envisioned a film based on Bethany's experience, provisionally titled ''The Bethany Hamilton Story''.<ref name=\"power\">{{cite news | last=Campbell | first=Duncan | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1140756,00.html | title=To the power of one | work=The Observer | date=February 8, 2004 | location=London}}</ref> Bethany published her biographical book ''Soul Surfer'' in 2004,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Health/story?id=644247&page=1 | title=Surfer Girl Makes Comeback After Shark Attack | publisher=cbs News | date=April 7, 2005 }}</ref> and [[BBC]] reported that a film about her life was scheduled to begin filming in January 2005.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/4417251.stm | title=Shark girl surfer hits the waves | publisher=BBC | date=April 6, 2005 }}</ref> Production did not begin as anticipated, and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported in July 2006 that production was scheduled for later in the year.<ref>{{cite news | last=Stinchfield | first=Kate | url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1220535,00.html | title=Milestones: Bethany Hamilton | work=Time | date=July 30, 2006 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the project at one point had an investment of {{nowrap|$7.5 million}} and the backing of Peter Schlessel, a Sony Pictures executive.<ref name=\"splashy\">{{cite journal | last=Caranicas | first=Peter | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031260 | title=Splashy finish for 'SoulSurfer' | journal=Variety | date=February 1, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThough production had not begun by the end of 2006, in January 2007 Sean McNamara was announced to be directing the biographical film.<ref>{{cite news | last=Franklin | first=Garth | url=https://www.darkhorizons.com/soul-surfer-tells-inspiring-tale/ | title=Soul Surfer Tells Inspiring Tale | publisher=Dark Horizons | date=January 31, 2007 }}</ref> While Hamilton had a series of surfing successes, turning pro in 2007, McNamara and producer David Brookwell with her manager Roy \"Dutch\" Hofstetter sought more material for the film. The book was considered \"a straightforward account\" that was targeted to Christian readers, so the filmmakers met with the Hamilton family to determine if there were any unpublished conflicts that could be highlighted in the film. They discovered that the incident had strained the family, that family members questioned their Christian faith, and that Bethany Hamilton struggled with her physical appearance and how boys would perceive her. The media attention on the family was described by Brookwell as \"a second shark attack\" that had made their lives uncomfortably public.<ref name=\"splashy\" />\n\n{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=\"She was actually my suggestion.

A scene in which Dennis Quaid's character reads the Bible in the hospital at his daughter's bedside had the words \"Holy Bible\" digitally removed from the cover. Bethany Hamilton's father said that David Zelon, an executive at Mandalay Pictures, lobbied to reduce the ''Soul Surfer''{{'}}s Christian elements so the film could appeal more to non-Christian audiences. The Hamilton family objected, and the words \"Holy Bible\" were restored in the scene in a follow-up screening. Another debated scene was one in which Carrie Underwood's character, a church youth leader, quotes biblical scripture ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 29:11<ref>''Soul Surfer'' DVD, scene 3. The Underwood character states chapter and verse.</ref>). While those involved with the film were fine with the verse, they did not want the scene to explicitly indicate that its origin was the Bible. Their stance was challenged, and the scene indicates the verse being from the Bible. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' cited the dust-up as an example of Hollywood learning to appeal to the faith-based community while still attracting secular audiences. ''The Blind Side'', which accomplished both, had grossed {{nowrap|$256 million}} in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bond | first=Paul | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/producer-tried-edit-bible-sony-100356 | title=Producer Tried to Edit Bible Out of Sony's 'Soul Surfer' | journal=The Hollywood Reporter | date=February 16, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was released in {{nowrap|2,214 theaters}} in the United States and Canada on {{nowrap|April 8}}, 2011.
