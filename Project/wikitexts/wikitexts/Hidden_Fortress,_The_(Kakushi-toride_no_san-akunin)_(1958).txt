It tells the story of two peasants who agree to escort a man and a woman across enemy lines in return for gold without knowing that he is a general and the woman is a princess. The film stars [[Toshiro Mifune]] as General Makabe Rokur\u014dta and [[Misa Uehara (actress, born 1937)|Misa Uehara]] as Princess Yuki while the role of the peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, are portrayed by [[Minoru Chiaki]] and [[Kamatari Fujiwara]] respectively.\n\nThe film is also known as being one of the most influential to the Star Wars script with scenes, lines and character similarities throughout the science-fiction film.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Young |first=Bryan |date=2019-07-23 |title='Star Wars' Owes A Great Debt To Akira Kurosawa's 'The Hidden Fortress' |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/567916/star-wars-and-the-hidden-fortress/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=SlashFilm.com |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTwo bedraggled peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, sell their homes and leave to join the feudal [[Yamana clan]], hoping to make their fortunes as soldiers. Instead, they are mistaken for soldiers of the defeated [[Akizuki clan]], have their weapons confiscated, and are forced to help dig graves before being sent away without any food. After quarreling and splitting up, the two are both captured again and reunite when they are forced alongside dozens of other prisoners to dig through the ruins of the Akizuki castle for the clan's secret reserve of gold. After a prisoner uprising, Tahei and Matashichi go on the run, steal some rice, and make camp near a river.\n\nWhile building a fire, they find a piece of gold marked with the crescent of the Akizuki clan. The peasants are then discovered by a mysterious man who takes them to a secret camp in the mountains. Unbeknownst to them, the man is a famous Akizuki general, Makabe Rokur\u014dta. Although Rokur\u014dta initially plans to kill the peasants, he changes his mind when they explain how they intend to escape Yamana territory: They will travel to Yamana itself and then pass into the neighboring state of Hayakawa through a different border. Rokur\u014dta decides, without revealing anything to the peasants, to take Princess Yuki of the Akizuki clan to Hayakawa, whose lord has promised to protect them.\n\nRokur\u014dta escorts Princess Yuki and what remains of her family's gold (hidden in hollowed-out logs of wood) to Hayakawa, with Matashichi and Tahei traveling with them. To protect Yuki, he has her pretend to be a [[deaf-mute]] and has a body double (who is Rokur\u014dta's younger sister) sent to the Yamana to be executed so they will believe that she is dead.  During their travels, Tahei and Matashichi get the group into dangerous situations several times due to their cowardice and greed. During a stop for the night at an inn, Yuki forces Rokur\u014dta to buy the freedom of a young prostitute, who decides to follow them.\n\nAfter losing their horses and obtaining a cart to move the gold, the group is spotted by a Yamana patrol, and Rokur\u014dta is forced to kill them. While pursuing two stragglers, he accidentally rides into a Yamana camp, where the commanding officer, Rokur\u014dta's old rival Hyoe Tadokoro, recognizes him. \nTadokoro states that he is sorry he didn't get to face Rokur\u014dta in battle and challenges him to a lance duel. Rokur\u014dta wins, but spares Tadokoro's life before stealing a horse and riding back to the group. Eventually, they are surrounded and captured by Yamana soldiers and detained at an outpost on the Hayakawa border. In the confusion, Matashichi and Tahei manage to hide. They decide to report Yuki for a reward, but the soldiers laugh at them and they leave with nothing.\n\nTadokoro comes to identify the prisoners the night before their execution. Tadokoro's face is now disfigured by a large scar and explains it as the result of a beating ordered by the lord of the Yamana clan as punishment for letting Rokur\u014dta escape. Yuki proclaims that she has no fear of death and thanks Rokur\u014dta for letting her see humanity's ugliness and beauty from a new perspective. The next day, as the soldiers start marching the prisoners to be executed, Tadokoro suddenly defects to the Akizuki side and frees Yuki, Rokur\u014dta, and the prostitute before distracting the guards so they can ride off. The group manages to escape along with the horses carrying the gold, which wind up running in a different direction.\n\nMatashichi and Tahei, both hungry and tired, stumble across the lost gold carried by the horses before being arrested by Hayakawa soldiers as thieves. The peasants are brought before a heavily armored samurai, who reveals that he is Rokur\u014dta and the well-dressed noblewoman with him is Yuki. Thanking them for saving the gold (which will be used to restore her clan), the princess rewards Matashichi and Tahei with a single [[Ry\u014d (Japanese coin)|ry\u014d]] on the condition that they share it. As the two men walk back to their village, they begin to laugh upon realizing that they have finally made their fortunes.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Toshiro Mifune]] as {{nihongo|General Rokurota Makabe|\u771f\u58c1 \u516d\u90ce\u592a|Makabe Rokurota}}\n*[[Minoru Chiaki]] as Tahei\n*[[Kamatari Fujiwara]] as Matashichi\n*[[Susumu Fujita]] as {{nihongo|General Hyoe Tadokoro|\u7530\u6240 \u5175\u885b| Tadokoro Hyoe}}\n*[[Takashi Shimura]] as General {{nihongo|Izumi Nagakura|\u9577\u5009 \u548c\u6cc9|Nagakura Izumi}}\n*[[Misa Uehara (actress, born 1937)|Misa Uehara]] as Princess Yuki\n*Eiko Miyoshi as Yuki's lady-in-waiting\n*Toshiko Higuchi as a prostitute purchased by the group who chooses to accompany them\n*[[Y\u016b Fujiki]] as a Yamana soldier\n*[[Sachio Sakai]] as a samurai\n*[[Yoshio Tsuchiya]] as a Yamana samurai\n*[[Kokuten K\u014dd\u014d]] as an old villager who tells Matashichi about a reward for Yuki's capture\n*[[K\u014dji Mitsui]] as a Yamana guard overseeing the excavation of Akizuki Castle\n\n==Production==\nThis was Kurosawa's first feature filmed in a widescreen format, [[TohoScope|Tohoscope]], which he continued to use for the next decade.

He said {{cquote| AKIRA KUROSAWA, the Japanese director whose cinema skills have been impressed upon us in many pictures, beginning with \"Rashomon\", is obviously not above pulling a little wool over his audiences' eyes \u2014 a little stooping to Hollywoodisms \u2014 in order to make a lively film.}} \nHe mentioned that Kurosawa, for all his talent, is as prone to pot boiling as anyone else.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Screen:'Hidden Fortress' from Japan:Kurosawa Resorts to Hollywood Effects Also Pulls Little Wool Over Viewers' Eyes|date=24 January 1962|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/01/24/archives/screen-hidden-fortress-from-japankurosawa-resorts-to-hollywood.html|last=NYTimes|access-date=8 January 2020|website=[[The New York Times]]|archive-date=6 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806014748/https://www.nytimes.com/1962/01/24/archives/screen-hidden-fortress-from-japankurosawa-resorts-to-hollywood.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWriting for [[The Criterion Collection]] in 1987, [[David Ehrenstein]] called it  \"one of the greatest action-adventure films ever made\" and a \"fast-paced, witty and visually stunning\" [[samurai film]]. According to Ehrenstein:\n<blockquote>The battle on the steps in Chapter 2 (anticipating the climax of ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'') is as visually overwhelming as any of the similar scenes in Griffith's ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''. The use of composition in depth in the fortress scene in Chapter 4 is likewise as arresting as the best of [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] or [[David Lean]]. Toshiro Mifune's muscular demonstrations of heroic derring-do in the horse-charge scene (Chapter 11) and the scrupulously choreographed spear duel that follows it (Chapter 12) is in the finest tradition of [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. Overall, there\u2019s a sense of sheer \"movieness\" to ''The Hidden Fortress'' that places it plainly in the ranks of such grand adventure entertainments as ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'', ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|The Thief of Baghdad]]'', and [[Fritz Lang]]'s celebrated [[diptych]] ''[[The Tiger of Eschnapur (1959 film)|The Tiger of Eschnapur]]'' and ''[[The Indian Tomb (1959 film)|The Hindu Tomb]]''.<ref name=\"ccEhren1987\"/></blockquote>\n\nDavid Parkinson of the ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' on a review posted on January 1, 2000, gave the film four out of five stars and wrote \"Somewhat overshadowed by the likes of Seven Samurai, this is a vigorously placed, meticulously staged adventure. It's not top drawer, but still ranks among the best of Kurosawa's minor masterpieces.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/hidden-fortress-review/|date=1 January 2000|access-date=8 January 2020|title=The Hidden Fortress review by The Empire|last=Empire|website=empireonline.com|archive-date=9 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809062434/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/hidden-fortress-review/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWriting for [[The Criterion Collection]] in 2001, [[Armond White]] said \"''The Hidden Fortress'' holds a place in cinema history comparable to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'': It lays out the plot and characters of an on-the-road epic of self-discovery and heroic action. In a now-familiar fashion, Rokur\u014dta and Princess Yuki fight their way to allied territory, accompanied by a scheming, greedy comic duo who get surprised by their own good fortune. Kurosawa always balances valor and greed, seriousness and humor, while depicting the misfortunes of war.\"<ref name=\"ccWhite2001\"/>\n\nUpon the film's UK re-release in 2002, Jamie Russell, reviewing the film for the [[BBC]], said it \"effortlessly intertwines action, drama, and comedy\", calling it \"both cracking entertainment and a wonderful piece of cinema.\"<ref name=\"bbc2002\"/>\n\n[[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' made a review on February 1, 2002. According to him:<blockquote>Revered now as an inspiration for [[George Lucas]], Kurosawa's amiable, forthright epic romance happens on a scorched, rugged landscape which looks quite a lot like an alien planet. At other times, the movie plays like nothing so much as a roistering comedy western. But it has a cleverly contrived relationship between the principals, including a fantastically brash and virile [[Toshiro Mifune]]. The comedy co-exists with a dark view of life's brevity, and Kurosawa devises exhilarating setpieces and captivating images. Arthouse classics aren't usually as welcoming and entertaining as this.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/01/culture.reviews2|title=The Hidden Fortress: The comedy co-exists with a dark view of live's brevity, and Kurosawa devises exhilarating setpieces and captivating images|website=theguardian.com|last=The Guardian|date=1 February 2002|access-date=8 January 2020|archive-date=9 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809022418/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/01/culture.reviews2|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it \"a long, interesting, humour-laden picture in medieval Japan\".
