It is a sequel to the 1985 film ''[[Re-Animator]]'' and the second entry in the [[Re-Animator (film series)|''Re-Animator'' film series]]. Like its predecessor, it is loosely based on the serialized story \"[[Herbert West\u2013Reanimator]]\" by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Unlike its predecessor, it was released [[direct-to-video]].<ref name=Hallcom/>\n\nThe plot of ''Bride of Re-Animator'' roughly follows episodes \"V. The Horror from the Shadows\" and \"VI. The Tomb-Legions\" of the Lovecraft story, and follows doctors [[Herbert West]] and Dan Cain as they attempt to create a living woman from dead tissue. The film stars [[Bruce Abbott]], Claude Earl Jones, [[Fabiana Udenio]], David Gale, and [[Kathleen Kinmont]], with [[Jeffrey Combs]] as Herbert West. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Beyond Re-Animator]]'', released in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nEight months after the events of ''Re-Animator'', doctors Herbert West and Dan Cain are working as medics in the middle of a bloody [[Internal conflict in Peru|Peruvian civil war]]. In the chaos of battle and with plenty of casualties to work on, they are free to experiment with West's re-animation [[reagent]]. When their medical tent is stormed by the enemy troops, West and Cain return home to [[Arkham]], [[Massachusetts]]. There, they resume their former jobs as doctors at [[Miskatonic University]] Hospital, and West returns to the basement laboratory of Cain's house to continue his research.\n\nUsing parts pilfered from both the hospital's morgue and from a cemetery located next door, West discovers that his reagent can re-animate body parts by themselves. He becomes determined to create an entire living person from disparate body parts. West discovers the heart of Megan Halsey, Cain's fianc\u00e9e, in the hospital morgue. With the promise to use her heart to re-animate a new Megan, West convinces Cain to help him with his project. Also stored in the morgue is the rest of the evidence from the \"Miskatonic Massacre\". Inside, [[pathologist]] Dr. Wilbur Graves discovers a vial of West's reagent and the severed head of Dr. Carl Hill. Using the reagent, he re-animates Hill's head.\n\nMeanwhile, police officer Lt. Leslie Chapham begins investigating West and Cain, as they were the only unaffected survivors of the Miskatonic Massacre; the dead body of Chapham's wife was re-animated into a crazed [[zombie]] during the incident (it is implied later in the film that he caused her death). Chapham suspects West and Cain were responsible. When he stops by their house to question them, he discovers West's corpse-filled lab and the two get into a confrontation. A fight ensues and West kills Chapham by means of cloth treated with a chemical which causes cardiac arrest when inhaled (a product of West's research into obtaining the freshest possible corpses for his experiments). West then re-animates the police officer with the intention of covering up his crime. Chapham violently wanders out of the house and into the cemetery next door.\n\nHill, who bears a grudge against West, uses [[psychic powers]] to command Chapham to force Dr. Graves to stitch bat wings onto his neck, giving him back his mobility. He also extends his mental control to all of the zombie survivors of the Miskatonic Massacre.\n\nWhen one of Cain's patients, Gloria, dies, West collects the last piece he needs for his creation: her head. With a complete body stitched and wired together, West and Cain inject the re-animation reagent into Meg's heart. While waiting for the reagent to take effect, a package is delivered to their house. West retrieves and opens it. From inside, Hill's winged head flies out. Simultaneously, the zombies Hill controls break into the house. West retreats back to the basement lab, where his creation, the Bride, has awoken.\n\nA [[catfight]] breaks out between the Bride and Cain's current girlfriend, Italian journalist Francesca Danelli, whom he met in Peru. Cain rejects the Bride's love and sides with Francesca. Heartbroken, the Bride rips Megan's heart out of her own chest and then falls to pieces. West diagnoses this as [[Transplant rejection|tissue rejection]].\n\nHill and his zombies force West, Cain and Francesca to retreat through the wall of the lab and into a crypt in the neighboring cemetery. Inside, all of West's prior test subjects arise and make their way towards him, stopping only when Herbert commands them to. The unstable crypt begins to collapse, trapping Hill, West and the zombies. Cain and Francesca escape the debris and claw their way to the surface of the cemetery together. Hill, is stuck in the debris, while Megan's heart, still in the hand of the Bride, stops beating.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] as [[Dr. Herbert West]]\n* [[Bruce Abbott]] as Dr. Dan Cain\n* Claude Earl Jones as Lieutenant Leslie Chapham\n* [[Fabiana Udenio]] as Francesca Danelli\n* [[David Gale (actor)|David Gale]] as Dr. Carl Hill\n* [[Kathleen Kinmont]] as Gloria / The Bride\n* [[Mel Stewart]] as Dr. Wilbur Graves\n* Irene Forrest as Nurse Shelley\n* Michael Strasser as Ernest\n* Mary Sheldon as Meg Halsey\n* Friday as Angel\n\n'''The Re-Animated'''\n* Marge Turner as Elizabeth Chapham\n* [[Johnny Legend]] as Skinny Corpse\n* David Bynum as Black Corpse\n* [[Noble Craig]] as Crypt Creature\n* Kim Parker as Crypt Creature\n* Charles Schneider as Crypt Creature\n* Rebeca Recio as Crypt Creature\n* Jay Evans as Crypt Creature\n\n==Production==\nIn an August 1986 interview, ''Re-Animator'' director [[Stuart Gordon]] commented, \"If we do a sequel to ''Re-Animator'', we'll call it ''Bride of Re-Animator''.\" He indicated that this title would be in homage to the film ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', adding that he already had several ideas for a sequel and that given the title, Meg Halsey would have to be a key character in it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first=John Andrew |chapter=Stuart Gordon |title=Film Directors on Directing |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1989 |pages=91, 96 |isbn=9780275932725 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/filmdirectorsond00gall/page/92}}</ref> One idea for a sequel involved Dan Cain taking the job of a building superintendent to surreptitiously continue working on Meg Halsey's body at night.<ref name=\"Blum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blumhouse.com/2016/04/21/the-bride-of-re-animator-that-almost-was/|title=The Bride of Re-Animator That Almost Was!|last=Galluzzo|first=Rob|date=April 21, 2016|publisher=[[Blumhouse Productions]]|access-date=September 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930085148/http://www.blumhouse.com/2016/04/21/the-bride-of-re-animator-that-almost-was/|archive-date=September 30, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> When government agents discover his whereabouts, they secret him away to the [[White House]] where he is reunited with Herbert West and instructed to reanimate the [[President of the United States]].<ref name=\"Blum\" /> A similar idea was later used for the unproduced sequel ''[[Re-Animator (film series)#Unproduced sequels|House of Re-Animator]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/501/exclusive-yuzna-talks-re-animator-future/|title=Exclusive: Yuzna Talks Re-Animator Future!|last=Condit|first=Jon|date=September 25, 2006|website=[[Dread Central]]|access-date=January 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nPre-production on ''Bride of Re-Animator'' began in early 1989.{{sfn|Rainone|1991a|p=44\u201345}} Production on the film was scheduled to begin on June 5, 1989, which left the filmmakers with less than one month to finalize the script, finish hiring the cast and crew, and get the special effects underway.<ref>{{harvnb|Rainone|1991a|p=45}}: \"What everyone feared was announced this afternoon [May 16, 1989] in a meeting: Wild Street is staying with their production start date of June 5.\"</ref> Jeffrey Combs was initially not going to reprise his role as Herbert West due to a scheduling conflict, as he was already booked to be in Italy for the filming of ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum (1991 film)|The Pit and the Pendulum]]''.{{sfn|Rainone|1991a|p=45}} However, on May 25, 1989, production on ''The Pit and the Pendulum'' was pushed back, and Combs was immediately cast to return as West.{{sfn|Rainone|1991a|p=49}}\n\nDirector Yuzna considered [[Patricia Tallman]] for the role of the Bride, but on May 28, 1989, he selected Kinmont to play the part.{{sfn|Rainone|1991a|p=49}} Actress [[Barbara Crampton]], who starred in the first ''Re-Animator'' film, did not return for ''Bride of Re-Animator''.
