It stars [[Jack Black]] as Ignacio, a Catholic [[friar]] and [[lucha libre]] fan who secretly moonlights as a luchador to earn money for the orphanage where he works. The film is loosely based on the story of [[Fray Tormenta]] (\"Friar Storm\", a.k.a. Rev. Sergio Guti\u00e9rrez Ben\u00edtez), a real-life Mexican [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] who had a 23-year career as a masked luchador to support the orphanage he directed.{{Not verified in body|date=August 2022}} The film was produced by Black, White, David Klawans and Julia Pistor.\n\nThe film was released on June 16, 2006, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $99.3 million at the worldwide box office against its $35 million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIgnacio's parents, a Scandinavian [[Lutheran]] missionary and a Mexican [[deacon]], both died while he was still a baby. Now a cook for the [[Oaxaca]] monastery orphanage where he was raised, Ignacio dreams of becoming a ''[[lucha libre|luchador]]'', but wrestling is strictly forbidden by the monastery as it is considered a [[sin]] of [[vanity]]. Though Ignacio cares deeply for the orphans, he is unable to provide decent meals for them due to a lack of funds. He also struggles with his feelings for Sister Encarnaci\u00f3n, a [[nun]] who has just arrived to teach at the orphanage. One night, while collecting a bag of [[tortilla chips]] for the orphans, Ignacio gets [[robbery|mugged]] for the chips by a street thief named Steven. Having had enough, Ignacio decides to disregard the monastery's rules and become a ''luchador'' to make money. He convinces Steven to join him by promising to share the prize money if they win, and the two join a local competition as [[Tag team|tag partners]].\n\nIgnacio fights with the moniker \"Nacho\" to keep his identity secret, while Steven adopts the name \"Esqueleto\". They get defeated in their first match but still get paid nicely, as wrestlers are entitled to a portion of the total revenue. \nThey prove popular with the crowd so are invited back.\nThey continue to wrestle every week, with Ignacio using the money to acquire better food for the orphans but becoming frustrated that the duo can never achieve victory in the ring. Ignacio tries everything he can think of, including a folk remedy to acquire the powers of an eagle, but success still eludes the two. He then seeks advice from champion ''luchador'' Ramses, who arrogantly rebuffs his attempts at conversation.\n\nUndeterred, the duo infiltrates a party Ramses's manager holds for the best wrestlers. Steven climbs over a wall to get inside, where he discovers that in order to be considered a professional, one must be the last luchador standing in the ring at an upcoming free-for-all match. Ignacio gets in by disguising himself as a band member playing for the party, but does not know their material and improvises; Ramses finds Ignacio's performance annoying and ousts him. Attending the party causes Ignacio to fall behind on his responsibilities to the orphans, for which he angrily blames Steven, who retaliates by declaring he hates all orphans; they acrimoniously end their partnership.\n\nIgnacio's secret is revealed to the entire monastery when his robe catches fire during [[mass (liturgy)|mass]], exposing his wrestling costume and forcing him to admit that he is a ''luchador''. He declares that he intends to fight at a battle royale for the right to take on Ramses for a cash prize, which he will use to buy a bus for the orphans. During the match, wrestler Silencio ultimately emerges the victor after defeating Ignacio, who comes in second place. Ignacio is banished from the monastery, so he goes to live in the \"wilderness\", which is actually very close to the nearby village.\n\nThe next morning, Steven comes to tell him that Silencio has been injured and cannot fight, and that as the second-place finisher, Ignacio now has the right to fight Ramses; Ignacio and Steven agree to team up again. That night, Ignacio sends a message to Encarnaci\u00f3n, explaining his plan and confessing his love to her.\n\nIgnacio overcomes difficulty and manages to do well in the match, winning the crowd's support, but Ramses cheats and nearly wins until Ignacio sees Encarnaci\u00f3n enter the arena with the orphans. Inspired by their support, Nacho rallies himself and defeats Ramses with a diving technique.\n\nIgnacio becomes a professional wrestler and eventually manages to buy a bus for the orphans with his prize money; he then takes the orphans, Steven, and Sister Encarnaci\u00f3n on a field trip to [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]] built by the\u00a0Zapotec civilization. Ignacio, by now, has earned Encarnaci\u00f3n's favor, as demonstrated by her signs of encouragement and his somewhat awkward acknowledgment thereof.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Black]] as Ignacio/Nacho, a Oaxaca monastery cook who dreams of becoming a [[luchador]]\n** [[Troy Gentile]] as Young Ignacio \n* [[Ana de la Reguera]] as Sister Encarnaci\u00f3n, a nun at the monastery\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Jim\u00e9nez]] as Steven/Esqueleto, Ignacio's tag partner\n* [[Silver King (wrestler)|Silver King]] as Ramses, the luchador champion and Ignacio's idol\n* [[Carla Jimenez]] as C\u00e1ndida, a portly woman who tries to court Steven at the luchador's party\n* [[Richard Montoya]] as Guillermo\n* Enrique Mu\u00f1oz as Se\u00f1or Ramon, Ramses' manager\n* [[Mois\u00e9s Arias]] as Juan Pablo\n* Donald Chambers as Silencio, one of the wrestlers who defeats Nacho but is disqualified when Esqueleto runs over him, injuring his foot\n* Darius Rose as Chancho\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Emperor, the local magic-man who claims that eating eagle eggs will give Ignachio the eagle's power\n* [[Eduardo G\u00f3mez (actor)|Diego Eduardo Gomez]] as Chuy\n* [[Human Tornado]] as El Snowflake, one of the luchadors who faces Nacho\n* [[Mascarita Dorada]] as one of Los Duendes\n\n==Production==\nBlack was a fan of the film [[Napoleon Dynamite]] and its director [[Jared Hess]], and the two met in Los Angeles to discuss collaborating. Black was drawn to Hess' idea of a man of the Lord secretly living a life of violence via his love of lucha libre wrestling. While filming, Black sustained a gash on his eye after diving out of the wrestling ring during a stunt. He was rushed to the hospital but was able to continue filming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BTJ7feX0aQ&t=2061s&ab_channel=GQ|title=Jack Black Breaks Down His Most Iconic Characters|website=youtube.com}}</ref> The film was shot entirely in Oaxaca, Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/He-sings-wrestles-and-has-a-fake-Mexican-accent-2532974.php#:~:text=%22Nacho%20Libre%22%20was%20filmed%20entirely,wrestles%20it%20to%20a%20draw.|title=He sings, wrestles and has a fake Mexican accent.

Beck, being a fan of Hess, accepted. However, [[Paramount Pictures]] did not think Beck's style fit the movie, so composer [[Danny Elfman]] was brought in to replace him. Elfman then wrote a full score and recorded it in May 2006.<ref name=\"scoringsessions\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/46/ |title=Danny Elfman scores Nacho Libre - ScoringSessions.com |access-date=2010-08-09  |work=Scoring Sessions|date=2006-05-05 }}</ref> However, only about 2/3 of Elfman's score ended up in the movie (with one of the songs, Ramses Suite, appearing in the released soundtrack). Due to how much of Elfman's music filled the film, Elfman's representatives asked that Elfman be the only person credited for the film's score. Hess caught wind of this and would not allow the studio to remove Beck from the credits. When finding that he would not have the only music credit, Elfman told Paramount to remove his name from the film. An agreement was eventually reached where both Beck and Elfman were credited for their respective parts of the score.<ref name=\"joblo\">{{cite web|author=Sampson|first=Mike|title=The truth behind Nacho's music - JoBlo.com|url=https://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=11827|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606144628/http://www.joblo.com/?id=11827|archive-date=2011-06-06|access-date=2020-10-02|work=Joblo}}</ref> However, Elfman appears with sole credit in the official billing block on promotional material.\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe track listing for the official soundtrack to ''Nacho Libre''.<ref name=\"amazonmusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000I8OOJC |title=Amazon.com: Nacho Libre: Various Artists: Music |access-date=2010-08-09 |publisher=Amazon}}</ref> The soundtrack was released October 24, 2006\n\n# Hombre Religioso (Religious Man) - [[Mister Loco]]\n# \"A Nice Pile-Drive to the Face\" (''dialogue'') - [[Jack Black]]\n# Move, Move, Move - [[Alan Hawkshaw]] and Alan Parker\n# Papas - Mister Loco\n# Piel Canela (Singing at the Party) - Jack Black with Ismael Garcia Ruiz y Su Trio\n# Ramses Suite - [[Danny Elfman]]\n# \"All the Orphans in the World\" (''dialogue'') - Jack Black and [[H\u00e9ctor Jim\u00e9nez]]\n# There is No Place in This World for Me - [[Beck]]\n# \"I'm Serious\" (''dialogue'') - Jack Black\n# 10,000 Pesos - Beck\n# Irene - [[Caetano Veloso]]\n# Pump a Jam (Ramses) - Cholotronic\n# Black is Black - [[Eddie Santiago]]\n# Half Forgotten Daydreams - John Cameron\n# Encarnaci\u00f3n - Jack Black\n# Tender Beasts of the Spangled Night - Beck\n# Saint Behind the Glass - [[Los Lobos]]\n# \"Beneath the Clothes We Find the Man...\" (''dialogue'') - Jack Black\n# Forbidden Nectar - Jack Black and Mucho Macho Acapulco\n\nSome songs that were not included on the soundtrack, but were in the movie, are \"Mucha Muchacha\" by [[Juan Garc\u00eda Esquivel|Esquivel]], \"Bubblegum\" by Mister Loco, \"Holy Man\" by Beck, \"Bat Macumba\" by [[Os Mutantes]], and \u201cLa Llorona Loca\u201d by Little Joe and the Latinaires.\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe release date was originally set for May 2006, but was changed by Paramount to avoid competition from [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' and one of Paramount's other films, ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]''.
