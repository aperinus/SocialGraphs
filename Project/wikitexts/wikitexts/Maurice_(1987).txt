M. Forster]].  The film stars [[James Wilby]] as Maurice, [[Hugh Grant]] as Clive and [[Rupert Graves]] as Alec. The supporting cast includes [[Denholm Elliott]] as Dr Barry, [[Simon Callow]] as Mr Ducie, [[Billie Whitelaw]] as Mrs Hall, and [[Ben Kingsley]] as Lasker-Jones.\n\nThe film was produced by [[Ismail Merchant]] via [[Merchant Ivory Productions]] and [[Channel 4|Film Four International]], and written by Ivory and [[Kit Hesketh-Harvey]], with cinematography by [[Pierre Lhomme]]. It is a tale of gay love in the restrictive and repressed culture of [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] England. The story follows its main character, Maurice Hall, through university, a tumultuous relationship, struggling to fit into society, and ultimately being united with his life partner.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a trip to a windswept beach, Maurice Hall, an 11-year-old schoolboy, receives instructions about the \"sacred mysteries\" of sex from his teacher, who wants to explain to the fatherless boy the changes he would experience in puberty.\n\nYears later, in 1909, Maurice is attending [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], where he strikes up a friendship with two fellow students: the aristocratic [[Viscount]] Risley and the rich and handsome Clive Durham. Clive falls in love with his friend and surprises Maurice by confessing his feelings. At first, Maurice reacts with horror, but he soon realizes that he reciprocates Clive's feelings. The two friends embark on a passionate love affair but, at Clive's insistence, their relationship remains non-sexual. To go further, in Clive's opinion, would diminish them both. Clive, a member of the upper class, has a promising future ahead of him and does not want to risk losing his social position. Their close relationship continues after Maurice is expelled from Cambridge and begins a new career as a stockbroker in [[London]].\n\nThe two friends keep their feelings secret but are frightened when Lord Risley is arrested and sentenced to six months' hard labour after soliciting sex from a soldier. Clive, afraid of being exposed as a homosexual, breaks with Maurice. After his return from a trip to [[Greece]], Clive, under pressure from his widowed mother, marries a naive rich girl named Anne and settles into a life of rural domesticity.\n\nHeartbroken, Maurice seeks the help of his family physician, Dr. Barry, who dismisses Maurice's doubts as \"rubbish\". Maurice then turns to Dr. Lasker-Jones, who tries to cure his homosexual longings with hypnosis. During his visits to Clive's estate of Pendersleigh, Maurice attracts the attention of Alec Scudder, the under-gamekeeper who is due to emigrate with his brother to [[Argentina]]. Maurice not only fails to notice Scudder's interest in him, but initially treats him with contempt. This does not discourage Scudder, who spies on Maurice at night. Simcox, the butler at Pendersleigh, suspecting the true nature of Maurice and Clive's past relationship, has hinted to Scudder about Maurice's nature. On a rainy night, Scudder boldly climbs a ladder and enters Maurice's bedroom through an open window. Scudder kisses Maurice, who is completely taken by surprise but does not resist his sexual advances.\n\nAfter their first night together, Maurice receives a letter from Scudder proposing they meet at the Pendersleigh boathouse. Maurice wrongly believes that Scudder is blackmailing him. Maurice returns to Lasker-Jones, who warns Maurice that England is a country which \"has always been disinclined to accept human nature\" and advises he emigrate to a country where homosexuality is no longer criminalised, like France or Italy. When Maurice fails to appear at the boathouse, Scudder travels to London and visits him at his offices.\n\nMaurice and Scudder meet at the [[British Museum]] and the blackmail misunderstanding is resolved. Maurice begins to call Scudder by his first name, Alec. They spend the night together in a hotel room, and as Alec departs in the morning he explains that his departure for Argentina is imminent and they will not see each other again. Maurice goes to the port to give Alec a parting gift only to discover that Alec has missed the sailing. Maurice goes to Pendersleigh and confesses to Clive his love for Alec. Clive, who was hoping that Maurice would marry, is bewildered at Maurice's account of his encounters with Alec. The two friends separate and Maurice goes to the boathouse looking for Alec, who is there waiting for him. Scudder tells him that he sent a telegram to Maurice stating that he was to come to the boathouse. Alec has left his family and abandoned his plans to emigrate in order to stay with Maurice, telling him, \"Now we shan't never be parted.\" Meanwhile, Clive is getting ready for bed and briefly reminisces about his time with Maurice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[James Wilby]] as Maurice Hall\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Clive Durham\n* [[Rupert Graves]] as Alec Scudder\n* [[Denholm Elliott]] as Doctor Barry\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Mr. Ducie\n* [[Billie Whitelaw]] as Mrs. Hall\n* [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] as Dean Cornwallis\n* [[Judy Parfitt]] as Mrs. Durham\n* [[Phoebe Nicholls]] as Anne Durham\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Lasker-Jones\n* [[Patrick Godfrey]] as Simcox, Durham's butler\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Mark Tandy (actor)|Mark Tandy]] as Lord Risley\n* [[Kitty Aldridge]] as Kitty Hall\n* [[Helena Michell]] as Ada Hall\n* [[Catherine Rabett]] as Pippa Durham\n* [[Peter Eyre]] as Reverend Borenius\n* [[Orlando Wells]] as Maurice as a boy\n* [[Julian Wadham]] as Hull\n* [[Richard Warner (actor)|Richard Warner]] as Judge\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as woman at cricket match (uncredited)\n* Mark Payton as Chapman\n* Matthew Sim as Featherstonhaugh\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background===\n[[E. M. Forster]] wrote ''[[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]]'' in 1913\u201314, and revised it in 1932 and again in 1959\u20131960. Written as a traditional ''[[Bildungsroman]]'', or novel of character formation, the plot follows the title character as he deals with the problem of coming of age as a homosexual in the restrictive society of the [[Edwardian era]]. Forster, who had based his characters on real people, was keen that his novel should have a happy ending.<ref name=\"Tomalin 290\">Tomalin, ''Maurice Film Review'', Sight & Sound. Autumn 1987, p. 290</ref> The author did not intend to publish the novel while his mother was alive, but he showed the manuscript to selected friends, such as [[Christopher Isherwood]]. Forster resisted publication during his lifetime because of public and legal attitudes to homosexuality. He was also ambivalent about the literary merits of his novel. A note found on the manuscript read: \"Publishable, but worth it?\" The novel was only published in 1971 after Forster's death. It is considered one of his minor works, in comparison with his novels ''[[Howards End]]'' (1910) and ''[[A Passage to India]]'' (1924).\n\n[[James Ivory]] was interested in making a [[Film adaptation|screen adaptation]] after the critical and box office success he achieved with another of Forster's novels, ''[[A Room with a View (1985 film)|A Room with a View]]''. While involved in this earlier project Ivory had read all of Forster's books, and eventually came to ''Maurice''. \"I thought,\" Ivory said, \"that it was interesting material and would be enjoyable to make \u2013 and also something we could make in that it wouldn't require too much organization and wouldn't cost all that much.\" The situation it explores seemed to him to be still relevant: \"People's turmoil and having to decide for themselves how they want to live and what their true feelings are and whether they're going to live honestly with them or deny them. That's no different. Nothing's any easier, for young people. I felt it was quite relevant.\"<ref name=\"Long 147\">Long, '' The Films of Merchant Ivory'', p. 147</ref>\n\nIn his will, Forster left the rights to his books to [[King's College, Cambridge]], which has a self-governing board of fellows of the college.<ref name=\"Long 211\">Long, ''James Ivory in Conversation'', p. 211</ref> They were initially reluctant to give permission to film ''Maurice'', not because of the subject matter of the novel, but because it was considered an inferior work, and a film that called attention to it would not enhance Forster's literary reputation.<ref name=\"Long 150\">Long, ''The Films of Merchant Ivory'', p. 150</ref> [[Ismail Merchant]], the producer of the film, conferred with them and was very persuasive. They were favourably impressed with the adaptation by  [[Merchant Ivory Productions]] of ''[[A Room with a View]]'' and relented.<ref name=\"Long 211\"/><ref name=\"Long 151\">Long, ''The Films of Merchant Ivory'', p. 151</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nIvory's usual writing partner, [[Ruth Prawer Jhabvala]], was unavailable because she was busy writing her novel ''Three Continents''. Ivory wrote the screenplay with [[Kit Hesketh-Harvey]], who had become connected with Merchant Ivory Productions through his sister, journalist and author [[Sarah Sands]] (born Sarah Harvey), who was then the wife of [[Julian Sands]], the leading man in ''A Room with a View''. Hesketh-Harvey had previously written documentaries for the [[BBC]].<ref name=\"Long 211\"/> He had attended [[Tonbridge School]] and [[Cambridge University]], where Forster was educated, and knew the background. Ivory later said, \"What Kit brought to the script was his social background. He went to Cambridge and a fancy prep school. His knowledge of the British upper middle class, that was incredibly useful \u2013 the dialect, the speech, the slang, and so many other things. As an American, I could not have possibly written the script without him.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = McKittrick | first = Christopher | title = James Ivory on Screenwriting | work =Creative Screenwriting | date = 15 May 2017 | url = https://creativescreenwriting.com/james-ivory/| access-date = 15 May 2017 }}</ref>\n\nJhabvala reviewed the script and suggested changes.<ref name=\"Long 212\">Long, ''James Ivory in Conversation'', p. 212</ref> On her advice, Clive Durham's unconvincing conversion to heterosexuality during a trip to Greece was justified by creating an episode in which Clive's university friend Risley is arrested and imprisoned after a homosexual entrapment, which frightens Clive into marrying.<ref name=\"Long 212\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nJulian Sands, who had played the male lead in Merchant Ivory's ''A Room with a View'', was originally cast in the title role,<ref name=\"Long 212\"/> but backed out at the last minute. [[John Malkovich]] was due to take the role of Lasker-Jones. He had become a friend of Julian Sands while both were making ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]''. After Sands left the project Malkovich lost interest in the film and was replaced by [[Ben Kingsley]].<ref name=\"Long 213\">Long, ''James Ivory in Conversation'', p. 213</ref>\n\n[[James Wilby]] had auditioned for the role of Clive Durham's brother-in-law. When Sands left the project, Ivory considered two unknown actors for the role of Maurice: James Wilby and [[Julian Wadham]].<ref name=\"Long 213\"/> Since he had already cast the dark-haired [[Hugh Grant]] as Clive, Ivory decided on the blond James Wilby over the dark-haired Julian Wadham, who was given a role as one of Maurice's stockbroker friends.<ref name=\"Long 213\"/>\n\nHugh Grant, who later found international stardom with ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', had previously appeared in only one film, ''[[Privileged (1982 film)|Privileged]]''. He was doing review comedy at the time and had lost interest in professional acting when Celestia Fox, the casting director, sent Grant to Ivory who immediately gave him the role of Clive.<ref name=\"Long 214\">Long, ''James Ivory in Conversation'', p. 214</ref> It helped that Grant and Wilby had worked together in Grant's first film, made at Oxford. [[Rupert Graves]] was cast as Alec Scudder, Maurice's working-class lover. He had appeared as Lucy Honeychurch's young brother in ''A Room with a View'', a performance with which he was unsatisfied, and so he appreciated the opportunity to deliver a better performance.\n\nThe supporting cast included veterans [[Denholm Elliott]] as Dr. Barry and [[Simon Callow]] as the pedagogue Mr. Ducie, both from ''A Room with a View''; Ben Kingsley as Lasker-Jones; [[Patrick Godfrey]] as the butler Simcox; [[Billie Whitelaw]] as Maurice's mother; and [[Helena Bonham Carter]] in an uncredited cameo as an audience member at the cricket match.\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was made on a budget of \u00a31.58 million that included investment by Cinecom and Britain's Channel 4. ''Maurice'' proved more complicated to make than Ivory had anticipated. Its fifty-four-day shooting schedule, which involved working six-day weeks, proved long and grueling. There was no rehearsal period, only a read-through before shooting began.\n\n''Maurice'' was shot on location largely in the halls and quadrangles of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], Cambridge including interiors in the college's chapel, where Forster was educated and later returned as a Fellow. The other interiors were primarily shot at [[Wilbury Park]], a [[Palladian]] house in [[Wiltshire]]. Its owner, [[Maria St. Just]], an actress and trustee of the estate of [[Tennessee Williams]], was a friend of Merchant and Ivory. In 1979 they had been weekend guests at Wilbury Park, which made an impression on James Ivory, who, when ''Maurice'' was being prepared, chose it to serve as Pendersleigh, the country house where Maurice visits his friend Clive.\n\nIn the style of Merchant Ivory's ''A Room with a View'', old book endpapers accompany the [[theme music]] played in [[minor scale]] at the beginning and in [[major scale]] at the end to bracket the film as a cinematographic novel.\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nAt the beginning of the film, Maurice is age 11, rather than 14. The film omits almost all of the novel's philosophical dialogue and many subplots, such as Maurice's desire for the schoolboy Dickie. The scenes dealing with this subplot were filmed but not included in the final cut.\n\nThe film expands the [[Oscar Wilde|Wildean]] character of Lord Risley, and sees him sentenced to six months of hard labour for homosexual conduct; in the novel, he is never imprisoned. In one deleted scene (first released in Cohen Media's 2002 DVD edition), Risley commits suicide.\n\nIn the novel, the Durham family seat is Penge, on the border of Wiltshire and Somerset; in the film, the country house is in Pendersleigh Park.\n\nThe hypnotist Lasker-Jones appears in the film rather more than in the novel; he is the person most understanding of Maurice's psychological and social situation.\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1987, where Ivory was awarded a Silver Lion as Best Director, sharing the prize with [[Ermanno Olmi]].<ref name=\"Long 153\">Long, ''The Films of Merchant Ivory'', p. 153</ref> James Wilby and Hugh Grant were jointly awarded Best Actor, and [[Richard Robbins (composer)|Richard Robbins]] received the prize for his music.<ref name=\"Long 154\">Long, ''The Films of Merchant Ivory'', p. 154</ref> The film received favourable reviews when it opened in [[New York City]]. ''Maurice'' received an [[Academy Award]] nomination in the Best Costume Design category.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1988 |title=The 60th Academy Awards (1988): Winners & Nominees - Costume Design |access-date=10 May 2016 |author=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |date=2015}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 82% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 33 reviews; the critics' consensus reads, \"''Maurice'' sensitively explores the ramifications of forbidden desire with a powerful love story brought to life by the outstanding efforts of a talented cast.\"<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/maurice/ Maurice \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes]</ref> Ken Hanke from ''[[Mountain Xpress]]'' said it was probably Merchant\u2013Ivory's best film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/maurice/reviews?type=&sort=&page=2|title = Maurice - Movie Reviews|website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Janet Maslin]] observed \"The novel's focus is predominantly on the inner life of the title character, but the film, while faithful, is broader. Moving slowly, with a fine eye for detail, it presents the forces that shape Maurice as skillfully as it brings the character to life.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Maslin | first = Janet | title = Maurice | work =[[The New York Times]] | date = 18 September 1987 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE5DF153DF93BA2575AC0A961948260| access-date = 1 August 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' rated the film three stars out of a possible four, commenting:<ref>{{cite news| last = Ebert | first = Roger | title = Maurice | work = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 9 October 1987 | url = http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/maurice-1987| access-date = 1 August 2013 }}</ref>\n{{Blockquote|Merchant and Ivory tell this story in a film so handsome to look at and so intelligently acted that it is worth seeing just to regard the production.
