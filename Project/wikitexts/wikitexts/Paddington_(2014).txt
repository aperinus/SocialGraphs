It was developed from a story by King and [[Hamish McColl]], which was based on the stories of the character [[Paddington Bear]] created by [[Michael Bond]]. Produced by [[David Heyman]], ''Paddington'' stars [[Ben Whishaw]] as the voice of the title character, with [[Hugh Bonneville]], [[Sally Hawkins]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Peter Capaldi]], and [[Nicole Kidman]] in live-action roles. The film tells the story of Paddington, an [[anthropomorphic]] bear who migrates from the jungles of \"Darkest Peru\" to the streets of London, where he is adopted by the Brown family. Kidman plays a [[taxidermist]] who attempts to add him to her collection.\n\nA British and French venture produced by [[StudioCanal UK]], [[TF1 Films Production|TF1]], and [[Heyday Films|Heyday]], ''Paddington''{{'}}s [[principal photography]] began in September 2013 and wrapped up in June 2014. [[Colin Firth]] was originally set to voice Paddington, but dropped out in [[post-production]] and was replaced by Whishaw.\n\n''Paddington'' was released in the United Kingdom on 28 November 2014 to critical acclaim for Whishaw's vocal performance, humour, screenplay, visual effects and appeal to children and adults. It grossed $268 million worldwide on a \u20ac38.5 (~$55) million budget. It received two nominations at the [[68th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTAs]]: [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Best British Film]] and  [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. A sequel, ''[[Paddington 2]]'', was released in 2017, with King and much of the cast returning.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the deep jungles of Darkest [[Peru]], a British geographer discovers a previously unknown species of bear. He learns that the bears are highly intelligent and that they have a deep fondness for [[marmalade]]. He names them Lucy and Pastuzo and gives them his hat as he leaves, telling the bears that they are always welcome if they wish to go to [[London]].\n\nForty years later, the two bears are living in harmony with their orphaned nephew until an [[earthquake]] destroys their home, forcing them to seek shelter underground. Pastuzo fails to reach the shelter in time and is killed by a falling tree. Lucy encourages her nephew to go and find solace in London, while she moves into the Home for Retired Bears.\n\nThe young bear arrives in London on a [[cargo ship]] and eventually reaches [[London Paddington station|Paddington Station]]. He meets the Brown family, who take him home and name him after the station they found him in. Henry Brown, the father and a devoted risk analyst, does not believe Paddington's story and is adamant that Paddington stay only one night, but his wife Mary and their two children, Jonathan and Judy, find him endearing, as does Mrs Bird, the housekeeper.\n\nPaddington thinks he can find a home with the explorer who met Lucy and Pastuzo, but does not know his name. After finding no mention of his expedition on the Internet, Mary takes Paddington to Samuel Gruber, an antique shop owner who discovers that the hat bears the stamp of the Geographers' Guild, but the Guild has no record of an expedition to Peru. With the help of Henry, Paddington infiltrates the Guild's archive and discovers an expedition to Peru was undertaken by the explorer, whose name is Montgomery Clyde (although the Guild erased their record of the expedition).\n\nMeanwhile, the hateful museum [[Taxidermy|taxidermist]] Millicent Clyde kills and stuffs exotic animals to house them in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. When she learns of Paddington's existence, she immediately sets out to hunt him down. The Brown family departs for the day, leaving Paddington home alone. Scheming with the Browns' nosy but unsuspecting next-door neighbour, Mr Curry, Millicent sneaks in and attempts to capture Paddington; he manages to defend himself, but inadvertently starts a fire in the process. Paddington tries to tell the Browns his story of Millicent's kidnap attempt, but no one believes him.\n\nThat night, Paddington leaves the house and attempts to track down Montgomery Clyde himself, using the phone book to find the addresses of every \"M. Clyde\" in London. He eventually finds Millicent's house, and learns that Montgomery Clyde, who was Millicent's father, died a long time ago. Millicent resents her father for losing his Guild membership after he refused to bring a Peruvian bear specimen home and subsequently opened a [[petting zoo]]. She tranquilizes Paddington and prepares to stuff him, but when Mr Curry discovers her true intentions, he warns the Brown family and they come to save Paddington. They rescue him, and when Millicent is about to shoot Paddington on the roof, Mrs Bird opens a hatch, pushing her off.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Browns allow Paddington to stay in their house permanently. Millicent is arrested and sentenced to [[community service]] in her father's petting zoo. Paddington writes to Aunt Lucy, saying he is happy and has finally found a home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ben Whishaw]] as the voice of [[Paddington Bear]]<ref name=\"deadline2\">{{cite web |last=Yamato |first=Jen |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/07/paddington-bear-movie-ben-whishaw-colin-firth/ |title=Bear Necessity: Ben Whishaw To Voice CG 'Paddington' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=17 July 2014 |access-date=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Hugh Bonneville]] as Henry Brown<ref name=\"deadline1\">{{cite web |last=Patten |first=Dominic |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/11/twc-dimension-set-paddington-for-december-2014-release/ |title=TWC-Dimension Sets 'Paddington' For December 2014 Release |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=15 November 2013 |access-date=4 February 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Mary Brown<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Madeleine Harris]] as Judy Brown<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Samuel Joslin]] as Jonathan Brown<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Mrs Bird<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Millicent Clyde<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11078509/Nicole-Kidman-Paddington-film-is-too-vicious-for-my-children-to-see.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11078509/Nicole-Kidman-Paddington-film-is-too-vicious-for-my-children-to-see.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=24 September 2014 |date=5 September 2014 |title=Nicole Kidman: Paddington film is too vicious for my children to see |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n** Lottie Steer as Young Millicent\n* [[Peter Capaldi]] as Mr Curry\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Samuel Gruber<ref name=\"deadline1\"/>\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as the voice of Aunt Lucy\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as the voice of Uncle Pastuzo\n* [[Tim Downie]] as Montgomery Clyde\n* [[Simon Farnaby]] as Barry, a security guard\n* [[Matt Lucas]] as taxi driver Joe\n* [[Matt King (comedian)|Matt King]] as Andre the Thief\n* [[Madeleine Worrall]] as Agatha Clyde\n* [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] as The Boss Geographer \n* [[Michael Bond]] as The Kindly Gentleman<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/28/michael-bond-obituary|title = Michael Bond obituary|date = 28 June 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Kayvan Novak]] as Grant\n* [[Alice Lowe]] as the Geographer's Guild receptionist\n* [[Steve Edge]] as the Natural History Museum Security Guard {{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Filming of \"Paddington\" (2014) on Portobello Road corner of Denbigh Mews, London 26 Nov 2013.JPG|thumb|Filming equipment for ''Paddington'' on Portobello Road, London in 2013]]\nThe film was first announced in September 2007, with [[David Heyman]] producing and [[Hamish McColl]] writing the screenplay.<ref>{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Dawtrey |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/wb-bears-down-on-paddington-film-2-1117971958/ |title=WB bears down on 'Paddington' film |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=13 September 2007 |access-date=4 February 2014}}</ref> Further developments were not made until September 2013, when filming began and Heyman announced the casting of [[Colin Firth]] as Paddington.<ref name=\"empire\" /> With a budget of \u20ac38.5 million ($50\u201355 million), ''Paddington'' is the most expensive film produced by the French production company [[StudioCanal]].<ref name=\"ozap\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ozap.com/actu/-paddington-canal-va-produire-le-film-le-plus-cher-de-son-histoire/440832 |title=\"Paddington\" : Canal+ va produire le film le plus cher de son histoire |work=ozap.com |access-date=19 November 2014 |language=fr |date=5 November 2012 |first=Charles |last=Decant}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kemp |first1=Stuart |title='Harry Potter' Producer David Heyman to Adapt 'Paddington Bear' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/harry-potter-producer-david-heyman-paddington-bear-322838 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=20 November 2014 |date=5 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Jaafar |first1=Ali |title='Paddington': Potential Game-Changer For Studiocanal; Euro Major Bares Ambition |url=https://deadline.com/2014/11/paddington-potential-game-changer-for-studio-canal-1201300308/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=28 November 2014 |date=28 November 2014}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] and production began on 13 September 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=108890 |title=Paddington Starts Principal Photography, Full Cast Announced |publisher=[[ComingSoon.net]] |date=13 September 2013 |access-date=16 June 2014 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref>\n\n[[Filming locations]] for ''Paddington'' were mostly in [[West London]].
