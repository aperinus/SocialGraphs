The president and his staff, led by [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] and best friend AJ MacInerney, attempt to consolidate the administration's 63% [[United States presidential approval rating|approval rating]] by passing a moderate crime control bill. However, support for the bill in both parties is tepid: [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] reject it, and [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] think it is too weak. If passed, however, Shepherd's re-election is presumed to be guaranteed. Shepherd resolves to announce the bill, and have the Congressional support to pass it, by his [[State of the Union|State of the Union Address]].\n\nWhen the unmarried President's cousin, Judith, is sick and unable to act as hostess at a [[state dinner]] for the French president, Shepherd realizes his staff's public portrayal of him as lonely widower is true. Soon after, Shepherd meets and is attracted to Sydney Ellen Wade, a lawyer employed by an environmental [[lobbying]] firm that is working to pass legislation to substantially reduce [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide emissions]]. During a meeting, Shepherd strikes a deal with Wade: if she can secure 24 votes for the environmental bill before his State of the Union Address, he will deliver the last 10 votes. MacInerney believes Wade will fail to obtain enough votes, thus releasing Shepherd from responsibility if the bill fails to pass.\n\nShepherd and Wade begin seeing each other and fall in love. Presidential hopeful Senator Bob Rumson steps up his attacks, focusing on Wade's activist past and maligning Shepherd's ethics and [[family values]]. The President's refusal to refute Rumson's aspersions lowers his approval ratings and erodes crucial political support that threatens the crime bill.\n\nWade is dejected after her failed meeting with three [[Michigan]] congressmen to discuss the environmental bill. When she tells Shepherd about the meeting, she inadvertently mentions that the congressmen want to defeat both the President's crime bill and Wade's environmental bill. Shepherd and A.J. are conflicted about how they obtained this sensitive information, but are unable to ignore the opportunity to pass the crime bill, even if it means the president going back on his deal with Wade.\n\nEventually, Wade secures enough votes for the environmental bill while Shepherd is three short. He can only obtain them by shelving the environmental bill to solidify the three Michigan congressmen's votes for the crime bill {{snd}} which he agrees to do. Wade's firm fires her for failing to achieve their objectives and for seemingly jeopardizing her political reputation. She goes to see Shepherd to end their relationship and says she has a job opportunity in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. While he defends the crime bill as his top priority, she criticizes it as weakly worded with little chance of preventing crime.\n\nPrior to the State of the Union Address, Shepherd makes a surprise appearance in the White House press room and rebukes Rumson's attacks on his values and character, as well as his relentless innuendos that Wade prostituted herself for political favors. He declares he will send the controversial environmental bill to Congress with a massive 20% cut in [[fossil fuels]]{{snd}}far more than the 10% originally proposed. Furthermore, he is withdrawing the crime bill for a stronger one with significant [[gun control]] measures. His passion galvanizes the press and his staff. Shepherd and Wade reconcile, then she walks him to the doors of the House chamber where he enters to thunderous applause as he is about to deliver the State of the Union Address.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as United States President Andrew Shepherd\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Sydney Ellen Wade, a [[lobbyist]]\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as A.J.

When Reiner was brought aboard to direct, Redford dropped out. At the time, in October 1994, with cameras set to roll on November 30 of that year, Redford's publicist attributed his decision to his desire \"to do a love story, but (Reiner) wanted to do something that was ultimately about politics\".  Other sources suggested that Redford and Reiner \"didn't get along,...It was a personality thing.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/10/21/american-defector/ |title=An 'American' Defector |magazine=EW.com |date=1994-10-21 |access-date=2016-11-06 |archive-date=November 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201130090315/https://ew.com/article/1994/10/21/american-defector/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn later interviews, writer [[Aaron Sorkin]] told ''[[TV Guide]]'' he wrote the screenplay while high on [[crack cocaine]] while he was living at the [[Four Seasons Hotel]] in Los Angeles, which is why it took him three years to complete it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,31067,00.html|title=Aaron Sorkin: I Was 'Crack' Screenwriter|first=Michael|last=Starr|date=August 1, 2001|publisher=[[Fox News]]|access-date=May 17, 2011|quote=I was smoking crack cocaine every day' while writing the movie, Sorkin tells TV Guide in an interview...|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102232539/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,31067,00.html|archive-date=November 2, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn extensive White House set, of both the [[East Wing|East]] and [[West Wing]]s, was built on the [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] lot in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].

Ebert said after detesting ''North'' he was very happy and pleased to give Reiner's next film a unanimously positive review. Siskel praised Douglas and Bening for their performances.\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Influence on ''The West Wing'' ===\nThe screenplay for the film inspired many aspects of Sorkin's later television drama ''[[The West Wing]]''. The two productions follow the staff of a largely idealized [[White House]], and like many of Sorkin's projects, share ideologies. Even the set of the [[Oval Office]] in ''The American President'' was later used in ''The West Wing''.<ref>{{cite web|title=20 The West Wing facts on its 20th anniversary|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-09-22/west-wing-facts/|access-date=2020-11-01|website=Radio Times|language=en|archive-date=September 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920144207/https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-09-22/west-wing-facts/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe film's influence can be seen most clearly in early episodes of the series; some dialogue in the two are nearly identical. Sorkin has been known to say that much of the first season was actually taken from material he edited out of the first draft of ''The American President''{{'s}} script.\n\nOne of the issues touched on in the film and developed in the series relates to gun control bills, developed in \"[[Five Votes Down]]\". While the bill is ultimately withdrawn by President Shepherd because it is ineffectual, on the series President Bartlet and his staff work hard to pass their bill even though it is badly flawed (and end up doubly unhappy when VP John Hoynes, whom the President and senior staff are feuding with, clinches the bill for them by persuading an influential southern Democrat to support it).\n\nMore significant is the issue of a \"proportional response\" to military attacks on American assets abroad. In ''The American President'', Andrew Shepherd finds himself in the [[White House Situation Room|Situation Room]] having to order such an attack against Libya's intelligence headquarters after they bombed a missile defense system called \"C-STAD\" (Capricorn Surface-to-Air Defense) which had been positioned by the U.S. in Israel. He muses for a single line \"Someday, someone's gonna have to explain to me the virtue of a proportional response\", before giving the order. In \"[[A Proportional Response]]\", [[Josiah Bartlet|President Bartlet]] finds himself in similar circumstances (Syrian intelligence shot down a U.S. plane in Jordan and killed numerous Americans, including a young Naval officer who the President had decided would be his personal physician) and, seated in the White House Situation Room with his own National Security Council asks: \"What is the virtue of a proportional response?\" In both cases, the President chooses a military response that is relatively measured, but in the movie President Shepherd never considers a \"disproportionate\" response while President Bartlet plans such an action to destroy a large civilian airport in Syria; he eventually gives the green light for a strike similar to the one used in the movie.\n\nThe Global Defense Council, the fictional environmental lobby where Sydney Wade worked, is also featured in the ''West Wing'' episode called \"[[The West Wing (season 2)|The Drop-In]]\", and is often referred to in other episodes.\n\nIn ''The American President'', Sydney Ellen Wade is ultimately fired from her lobbyist position because the president has brokered a deal that causes her legislative effort to fail. Similarly, in the final episode of the third season of ''The West Wing'', Deputy Chief of Staff [[Josh Lyman]] uses the same tactic and ends up getting [[Amy Gardner]] fired from her position at the Women's Leadership Conference. Josh and Amy are dating when this takes place, just as the main characters are here. However, on the TV series it is Amy who tries to scuttle a bill (welfare reform) and Josh refuses to accept the demands of three Republican Congressmen because they amount to blackmail.\n\n''The American President'' includes mention of a Governor Stackhouse, while there is a [[Minnesota]] senator Howard Stackhouse ([[George Coe]]) in the two ''West Wing'' episodes \"[[The Stackhouse Filibuster]]\" and \"[[The Red Mass]]\". In the same way, the French President attending a state dinner in ''The American President'' seems to be the same President d'Astier that is often referred to in the ''West Wing''.\n\nSeveral actors from ''The American President'' reappear in ''The West Wing'', including [[Martin Sheen]] (whose character in ''The American President'', A.J., is at one point accused by Shepherd of lacking the courage to run for office himself) as President [[Josiah Bartlet]], [[Anna Deavere Smith]] as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] Dr. [[Nancy McNally]], [[Joshua Malina]] as [[White House Communications Director]] [[Will Bailey]], [[Nina Siemaszko]] as Ellie Bartlet, [[Ron Canada]] as Under Secretary of State Theodore Barrow, and [[Thom Barry]] as Congressman Mark Richardson.\n\nPortrayals of the president as idealistic but indecisive are also similar. In ''The American President,'' Shepherd has to be convinced by his staff to stand up to his Republican opponent and pursue gun control and environmental legislation decisively. In ''The West Wing,'' Bartlet is sometimes referred to as \u201cUncle Fluffy\u201d when endorsing moderate views that are more conciliatory and less resolute (for example, in the episodes \u201cLet Bartlet Be Bartlet\u201d and \u201cThe Two Bartlets\u201d). More generally, both presidents are former university professors (history in the movie, economics in the show) with no military experience and a low tolerance for political expediency.\n\n=== Other legacy ===\nThe concept for the television show ''[[Spin City]]'' was set in motion after the writers had seen [[Michael J.
