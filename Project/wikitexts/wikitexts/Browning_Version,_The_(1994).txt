The film is based on the [[The Browning Version (play)|1948 stage play of the same name]] by [[Terence Rattigan]], which was previously adapted for film [[The Browning Version (1951 film)|under the same name]] in 1951.\n\n==Plot==\nAndrew Crocker-Harris ([[Albert Finney]]) is a veteran teacher of Greek and Latin at a British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]. After nearly 20 years of service, he is being forced to retire on the pretext of his health, and perhaps may not even be given a pension. He is disliked or ignored by the other teachers and while his pupils fear his relentlessly strict discipline, they are bored by his dictatorial but dreary and uninspiring teaching methods. His younger wife Laura ([[Greta Scacchi]]), whom he has sexually and emotionally neglected, is unfaithful, and now lives to wound him any way she can. She is having an affair with Frank ([[Matthew Modine]]), an eager, young American science teacher who is highly popular with his pupils, much more lenient with classroom rules yet is able to connect with the pupils. In his final class, Andrew, while reading from a Greek play, finally shows some genuine passion about the subject, giving a glimpse at the teacher he could have been. Andrew's nervous new replacement Tom ([[Julian Sands]]) expresses his awe at the ironclad control that the former exerts over his classes, but Andrew advises his young colleague not to follow his example.\n\nAs his retirement at the end of the school term draws near, Andrew is approached by a quiet and sensitive pupil named Taplow who has detected the unhappiness and loneliness of his teacher and makes an attempt to reach out to him, saying that Andrew's Latin teachings have inspired him. Taplow gives Andrew a gift \u2013 a rare copy of an early edition of the 'Browning Version' \u2013 the 1877 translation by [[Robert Browning]] of [[Aeschylus]]\u2019 ancient play [[Agamemnon (play)|''Agamemnon'']]. Touched by this gesture, Andrew's emotional guard begins to be let down for the first time. Increasingly aware of Andrew's isolation, Frank feels guilty about the affair with Laura and ends the relationship. Shortly before the end-of-term school assembly in which Andrew will make his farewell speech, Laura tells her husband that she wants their marriage to end and that she intends to leave him.\n\nThe school's senior staff want Andrew to make his speech first, to be followed by the farewell speech of a younger, more popular teacher who is leaving to pursue a career as a cricketer. But Andrew insists on going second, even though the headmaster angrily says that it will give the ceremony an 'anti-climax'. To the surprise of everyone, including Laura who has lingered to watch the event, Andrew's speech is highly emotional and revelatory, apologising for his failures both as a teacher and as a person. Moved by the speech, the pupils and staff give Andrew a huge applause.\n\nAndrew, as a parting gesture of gratitude, tells Taplow that he has organised a place for him in Frank's science class which the pupil had been eager to join. Laura has a newfound sense of respect for her husband and the two part on good terms. As he watches Laura drive away, Andrew sadly but calmly faces the next phase of his life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Andrew Crocker-Harris\n* [[Greta Scacchi]] as Laura Crocker-Harris\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Frank Hunter\n* [[Julian Sands]] as Tom Gilbert\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Dr. Frobisher\n* [[Ben Silverstone]] as Taplow\n* [[Jim Sturgess]] as Bryant (as James Sturgess)\n* [[Joseph Beattie]] as Wilson\n* Mark Bolton as Grantham\n* Tom Havelock as Laughton\n* Walter Micklethwaite as Buller\n* Jotham Annan as Prince Abakendi\n* David Lever as David Fletcher\n* Bruce Myers as Dr. Rafferty\n* [[Maryam d'Abo]] as Diana\n* [[Heathcote Williams]] as Dr. Lake\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe interior and exterior scenes in ''The Browning Version'' were filmed at [[Milton Abbey School]] and [[Sherborne School]], two boys' independent schools in Dorset, in southern England.<ref>[http://www.south-central-media.co.uk/report.htm Dorset On Screen: A Report On The Use Of Dorset As A Film-TV Location] Accessed 18 March 2011</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109340/ The Browning Version (1994)] Accessed 18 March 2011</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Browning Version'' received positive reviews from critics.
