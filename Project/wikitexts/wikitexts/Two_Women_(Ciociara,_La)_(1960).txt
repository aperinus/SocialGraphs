The film stars [[Sophia Loren]], [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], [[Eleonora Brown]] and [[Raf Vallone]]. It tells the story of a woman trying to protect her young daughter from the horrors of war. The story is fictional, but based on actual events of 1944 in Rome and rural [[Lazio]], during the ''[[Marocchinate]]''.<ref>[http://www.cassino2000.com/cdsc/studi/archivio/n07/n07p09.html \"1952: Il caso delle 'marocchinate' al Parlamento\"]. Retrieved 9 December 2017.</ref>\n\nLoren's performance received critical acclaim, earning her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], among other accolades.\n\n==Plot==\nCesira (Loren) is a widowed shopkeeper, raising her devoutly religious twelve-year-old daughter, Rosetta (Brown), in Rome during [[World War II]]. Following the bombing of Rome, mother and daughter flee to Cesira's native [[Ciociaria]], a rural, mountainous province of central Italy. The night before they go, Cesira sleeps with Giovanni (Vallone), a coal dealer in her neighbourhood, who agrees to look after her store in her absence.\n\nAfter they arrive at Ciociaria, Cesira attracts the attention of Michele (Belmondo), a young local intellectual with [[communist]] sympathies. Rosetta sees Michele as a father figure and develops a strong bond with him. Michele is later taken prisoner by [[Wehrmacht|German soldiers]], who force him to act as a guide through the mountainous terrain.\n\nAfter the Allies capture Rome, in June 1944, Cesira and Rosetta decide to head back to that city. On the way, the two are gang-raped inside a church by a group of ''[[Moroccan Goumier]]s'' &ndash; soldiers attached to the invading [[Allied Armies in Italy]]. Rosetta is traumatized, becoming detached and distant from her mother and no longer an innocent child.\n\nWhen the two manage to find shelter at a neighbouring village, Rosetta disappears during the night, sending Cesira into a panic. She thinks Rosetta has gone to look for Michele, but later finds out that Michele was killed by the Germans. Rosetta returns, having been out with an older boy, who has given her silk stockings, despite her youth. Cesira is outraged and upset, slapping and spanking Rosetta for her behavior, but Rosetta remains unresponsive, emotionally distant. When Cesira informs Rosetta of Michele's death, Rosetta begins to cry like the little girl she had been prior to the rape. The film ends with Cesira comforting the child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as Cesira\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Michele Di Libero\n* [[Eleonora Brown]] as Rosetta\n* [[Carlo Ninchi]] as Filippo, Michele's father\n* [[Raf Vallone]] as Giovanni\n* [[Andrea Checchi]] as A fascist\n* [[Pupella Maggio]] as Peasant\n* Bruna Cealti as Refugee\n* Antonella Della Porta as A crazy mother\n* Mario Frera\n* [[Franco Balducci]] as German in the haystack\n* Luciana Cortellesi\n* [[Curt Lowens]]\n* Tony Calio\n* Remo Galavotti\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a 1957 novel by [[Alberto Moravia]], ''La ciociara'' (''The Woman From Ciociaria''). It was inspired by Moravia's experiences during World War II.\n\n[[Carlo Ponti]] bought the film rights along with Marcello Girosi for a reported US$100,000. Sophia Loren was always meant to star and there was some talk that the film might be financed by Paramount, with whom Loren had made a number of movies.<ref>{{cite news|title=JAPANESE MOVIE WILL BE ADAPTED: Alciona, U.S. Concern, to Make 'Magnificent 7' \u2013 Moravia Novel Eyed|first=Thomas|last=Pryor|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 May 1958|page= 26}}</ref> [[Anna Magnani]] was going to play the lead and Loren was going to be her daughter.

Vittorio De Sica became attached as director. Magnani pulled out, supposedly because she did not want to play Loren's mother, leading to Loren taking Magnani's role, even though the former was only 25 at the time.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QhnLOpcLfcC&q=two+women+film+sophia+loren&pg=PA77|page=77|title=Sophia Loren: Moulding the Star|first=Pauline|last= Small|publisher=Intellect Books|year=2009|isbn=9781841502342}}</ref> However, De Sica says it was his decision for Loren to play Magnani's role and cast a younger performer as the daughter \"for great poignancy.

French investment was conditional upon a French star being used, which lead to the casting of [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], who had leapt to international fame in ''Breathless'' (1960). Belmondo's voice was dubbed into Italian.\n\n==Release==\nJoseph E.
