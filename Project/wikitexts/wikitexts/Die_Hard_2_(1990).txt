The film co-stars [[Bonnie Bedelia]], [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]], [[Art Evans (actor)|Art Evans]], [[William Atherton]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Dennis Franz]], [[Fred Thompson]], [[John Amos]] and [[Reginald VelJohnson]].\n\nAs with the first film, the action in ''Die Hard 2'' takes place on Christmas Eve. McClane is waiting for his wife to land at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] when terrorists take over the air traffic control system. He must stop the terrorists before his wife's plane and several other incoming flights that are circling the airport run out of fuel and crash. During the night, McClane must also contend with airport police and a military commander, none of whom want his assistance.\n\nThe film was preceded by ''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988) and followed by ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'' (2007), and ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'' (2013).\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], two years after the events of the [[Die Hard|previous film]], [[John McClane]] is now a lieutenant with the [[Los Angeles Police Department|L.A.P.D]], who arrives at [[Dulles International Airport]] to pick up his wife, Holly. Meanwhile, a plane carrying corrupt foreign military leader General Ramon Esperanza is also headed to Dulles under extradition for using U.S. funds to buy drugs. Waiting to meet Esperanza's plane is disgraced former Colonel William Stuart and a group of ex-military sympathizers who supported Esperanza's actions. Suspicious, McClane follows two of Stuart's men into a restricted baggage sorting area where a gun fight ensues. McClane kills one man, but the other escapes.\n\nWith the help of his friend, Sergeant [[Al Powell]], he discovers that the dead man's fingerprints correspond to an American soldier who died in a helicopter accident two years ago. Putting this together with Esperanza's imminent arrival, McClane reports his concerns to the airport police chief, Carmine Lorenzo, and [[air traffic control]] director Ed Trudeau, but neither believe him. They are convinced when Stuart and his men, operating out of a church on the outskirts of the airport, cut all communications with incoming airplanes, disable all runway lighting, and demand that Esperanza's plane be allowed to land without interference. Trudeau orders all air traffic controllers to have all planes in Dulles airspace hold in the air, despite their low fuel warnings. \n\nMcClane becomes worried about Holly's plane and enlists the help of the airport janitor Marvin to fight back. Chief airport engineer Leslie Barnes decides to try using an unfinished antenna array to communicate with the airplanes circling the airport. Carmine sends an airport SWAT team with him, but Stuart's men kill them all, except for Barnes who is saved by McClane.  In retaliation, Stuart crashes a British airplane by pretending to be the air traffic control tower and faking the airplane's [[altimeter]] reading. Once Esperanza's plane lands, McClane wounds Esperanza before Stuart and his men arrive. They blow up the plane and take Esperanza to the church, but fail to kill McClane. A [[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Special Forces]] team arrives, led by Major Grant, for whom Stuart is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. \n\nGrant's men and McClane attack the church. McClane kills one of Stuart's men and gives chase with his gun, but the men escape. Confused as to why he failed to wound anyone, McClane realizes the gun was filled with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]], meaning Grant's team is cooperating with Stuart. Grant, Stuart, their men, and Esperanza all rendezvous at an airport hangar where a [[Boeing 747]] they demanded is waiting for them. On Holly's flight, arrogant reporter Richard Thornburg becomes suspicious as to why the plane hasn't landed. He taps into the cockpit communications and records an earlier surreptitious transmission from Barnes to all the circling airplanes describing the situation. In the airplane's lavatory, he broadcasts the recording live on television, leading to a panic in the airport terminal which prevents McClane and Carmine from getting to the 747. Holly subdues Thornburg with a fellow passenger's stun gun.\n\nMcClane asks a news crew to fly him via helicopter, to the runway where the 747 plans to take off. When the helicopter pilot refuses to block the 747, McClane asks the pilot to fly near the plane so that he can jump onto the wing. He uses his coat to jam the [[aileron]], preventing the plane from taking off. McClane kills Grant and in the struggle with Stuart, opens the fuel valve in the wing. When Stuart pushes McClane off the wing, McClane uses a cigarette lighter to ignite the fuel trail, exploding the plane and killing everyone on board. The fire trail also serves as a landing guide for all airborne planes, including Holly's, to land safely. After McClane and Holly are reunited, Marvin picks them up in his golf cart and drives them away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[John McClane]]\n* [[Bonnie Bedelia]] as [[Holly Gennero McClane]]\n* [[William Atherton]] as Dick Thornburg\n* [[Reginald VelJohnson]] as Sergeant Al Powell\n* [[Franco Nero]] as General Ramon Esperanza\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Colonel William Stuart\n* [[John Amos]] as Major Grant\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Captain Carmine Lorenzo\n* [[Art Evans (actor)|Art Evans]] as Leslie Barnes, airport chief engineer\n* [[Fred Thompson]] as Ed Trudeau, air traffic flight director\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Marvin\n* [[Sheila McCarthy]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Coleman\n* [[Robert Costanzo]] as Sergeant Vito Lorenzo\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Windsor Pilot\n}}\n\nAdditional cast members include Stuart's henchmen: [[Don Harvey (actor, born 1960)|Don Harvey]] as Garber, [[John Costelloe (actor)|John Costelloe]] as Sergeant Oswald Cochrane, [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as Miller, [[John Leguizamo]] as Burke, [[Robert Patrick]] as O'Reilly, [[Tom Verica]] as Kahn, [[Tony Ganios]] as Baker, Michael Cunningham as Sheldon, [[Peter Nelson (actor)|Peter Nelson]] as Thompson, Ken Baldwin as Mulkey, and [[Mark Boone Junior]] as Shockley.

The novel has the same plot but differs slightly: a police officer must stop terrorists who take an airport hostage while his daughter's plane circles overhead, and has 58 minutes to do so before the plane crashes.

As played by Bruce Willis, McClane is still an engaging character, even if he is much less amusingly drawn this time. Willis is in there trying, but the qualities that helped to make his character sympathetic in the first film are missing. McClane no longer worries openly about his personal safety, as he did in the original movie.
