It is a [[Story within a story|film-within-a-film]], featuring [[Steve Coogan]] and [[Rob Brydon]] playing themselves as egotistical actors during the making of a screen adaptation of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s 18th-century [[metafiction]]al novel ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]''. [[Gillian Anderson]] and [[Keeley Hawes]] also play themselves in addition to their ''Tristram Shandy'' roles. Since the book is about a man attempting but failing to write his autobiography, the film takes the form of being about failing to make the film.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film depicts [[Steve Coogan]] playing himself as an arrogant actor with low self-esteem and a complicated love life. Coogan is playing the eponymous role in an adaptation of ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman'' being filmed at a stately home. He constantly spars with actor [[Rob Brydon]], who is playing Uncle Toby and believes his role to be of equal importance to Coogan's, calling himself the \"co-lead\".\n\nThe film incorporates several sequences from ''Tristram Shandy''. Not all of these are part of the film-within-the-film. The latter are limited to the story of Tristram's conception, birth and christening; Uncle Toby's experiences at the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|Battle of Namur]] and Tristram's sudden and accidental [[circumcision]] at the age of three. Uncle Toby's wooing of Widow Wadman (Gillian Anderson) takes place in a sequence dreamed by Steve Coogan and after the cast and crew have viewed the \"completed\" film ending, with Walter Shandy fainting at the sight of his wife giving birth, the question \"How does the book end?\" is followed by the concluding scene of the novel, in which Yorick says \"It is a story about a Cock and a Bull \u2013 and the best of its kind that ever I heard!\" Yorick is not in the film-within-the-film; in this scene he is played by [[Stephen Fry]], who appears elsewhere in the film as Patrick, a caricatured version of the actual curator at [[Shandy Hall]]. The DVD extras include a scene of Fry talking with the curator he portrays.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Steve Coogan]] as Tristram Shandy / Walter Shandy / Steve Coogan\n*[[Rob Brydon]] as Captain Toby Shandy / Rob Brydon\n*[[Raymond Waring]] as Corporal Trim / Raymond Waring\n*[[Keeley Hawes]] as Elizabeth Shandy / Keeley Hawes\n*[[Shirley Henderson]] as Susannah / Shirley Henderson\n*[[Gillian Anderson]] as Widow Wadman / Gillian Anderson\n*[[Dylan Moran]] as Dr Slop / Dylan Moran\n*[[David Walliams]] as Curate\n*[[Stephen Fry]] as Parson Yorick / Patrick Curator / Stephen Fry\n*[[Jeremy Northam]] as Mark (director)\n*[[Benedict Wong]] as Ed\n*[[Ian Hart]] as Joe (writer)\n*[[James Fleet]] as Simon (producer)\n*[[Naomie Harris]] as Jennie\n*[[Kelly Macdonald]] as Jenny\n*[[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as Ingoldsby\n*[[Greg Wise]] as Greg\n*[[Roger Allam]] as Adrian\n*[[Ashley Jensen]] as Lindsey\n*[[Ronni Ancona]] as Anita\n*[[Kieran O'Brien]] as Gary\n*[[Tony Wilson|Anthony H.

Other non-[[diegesis|diegetic]] musical references are made to ''[[Amarcord]]'', ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'', ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'', ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'' and ''[[Barry Lyndon]]''. [[Michael Nyman]], composer of ''[[The Draughtsman's Contract]]'', provides a new arrangement of the [[Handel]] [[Sarabande]] featured in the latter film, while the tracks of ''The Draughtsman's Contract'' (the original soundtrack recordings, the score has been re-recorded numerous times) serve as a [[temp track]] to film of the Sterne material.\n\n==Locations==\n[[File:Laurence Sternes study at Shandy Hall.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Laurence Sterne]]'s study at [[Shandy Hall]], in which [[Stephen Fry]] appears as a caricatured version of \"Patrick\", the actual curator of the museum]]\nThe film was recorded at a number of locations in England:<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423409/locations Filming locations for A Cock and Bull Story].
