It was the first feature film ever to be written, directed and acted entirely in the [[Inuktitut]] language.\n\nSet in the ancient past, the film retells an [[Inuit mythology|Inuit legend]] passed down through centuries of [[oral tradition]]. It revolves around the title character, whose marriage with his two wives earns him the animosity of the son of the band leader, who kills Atanarjuat's brother and forces Atanarjuat to flee by foot.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival|54th Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2001, and was released in Canada on 12 April 2002. A major critical success, ''Atanarjuat'' won the ''[[Cam\u00e9ra d'Or]]'' (''Golden Camera'') at Cannes, and six [[22nd Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]]. ''Atanarjuat'' was also a commercial success, becoming Canada's top-grossing release of 2002, outperforming the mainstream comedy ''[[Men with Brooms]]''. It grossed more than US$5 million worldwide. In 2015, a poll of filmmakers and critics in the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] named it the [[Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time|greatest Canadian film of all time]].\n\n==Plot==\nAt [[Igloolik]] (\"place of houses\") in the Eastern Arctic wilderness at the dawn of the first millennium, Qulitalik bids goodbye to his sister Panikpak, wife of Kumaglak, promising to come if she calls for help in her heart. She gives him her husband's [[rabbit's foot]] for spiritual power.\n\nIn a flashback, the community is visited by the strange [[Shamanism|shaman]] Tungajuaq. During a spiritual duel with the visitor, the camp leader Kumaglak dies. The visitor removes the [[walrus]]-tooth necklace from Kumaglak's body, and puts the necklace around the neck of Kumaglak's son Sauri, who thus becomes camp leader. Much later, the shaman's magic has poisoned the community with hatred. Tulimaq, the laughing stock of the camp, is having bad luck hunting and can barely feed his family, but Panikpak brings meat for Tulimaq's children, Atanarjuat and Amaqjuaq, hoping that one day they will make things right.\n\nAtanarjuat grows up to be a fast runner, Amaqjuaq is strong, and they are rivals with Sauri and his son Oki. During a game of 'wolf [[tag (game)|tag]]' Atanarjuat pursues the beautiful Atuat, provoking jealousy in Oki. Oki's sister Puja also shows interest in Atanarjuat. In a punching duel with Oki, Atanarjuat wins the right to marry Atuat. Later, Atanarjuat leaves his wife Atuat at a camp to hunt caribou, but he stops at Sauri's camp, where he is persuaded to take Puja on the hunt. Camping by a lake, Atanarjuat and Puja sing, flirt, and have sex.\n\nLater, Atanarjuat is in an unhappy marriage with Atuat and Puja. He catches his brother having sex with Puja and strikes Puja. She runs to Sauri's camp and tells them that Atanarjuat tried to kill her, so Sauri and Oki decide to kill Atanarjuat; Panikpak, however, remains skeptical of Puja's accusations. Puja returns to Atanarjuat's camp apologizing, and is accepted back. One day the women decide to go find eggs, but first Puja places a boot outside the tent where the men are resting. Oki and two henchmen sneak up and plunge their spears through the tent wall. Amaqjuaq is killed, but Oki is startled by a vision of his grandfather Kumaglak, and Atanarjuat, naked and barefoot, bursts out of the tent and runs for miles across the ice, pursued by Oki's gang. Atanarjuat escapes by following a vision of Qulitalik and jumping a wide open crack in the ice. Eventually he collapses in exhaustion with bloody feet. He is rescued by Qulitalik and his family, who conceal him when Oki arrives in pursuit.\n\nBack at Igloolik, Sauri refuses to let Oki have Atuat, but Oki rapes Atuat, who is comforted by Panikpak. During a hunt, Oki stabs Sauri and claims it was an accident, and takes over as camp leader. In her heart, Panikpak summons her brother Qulitalik to come, as they agreed years ago. Qulitalik feels her call and makes magic with the rabbit foot: at Igloolik Oki catches a rabbit with his bare hands, eats it, and falls under a spell that makes him forget his grievances. Qulitalik and the family make the long sled journey back to Igloolik with Atanarjuat, who has healed. Atanarjuat is joyfully reunited with Atuat but rejects Puja. The spell-happy Oki just wants to have a feast. But Atanarjuat prepares an ice floor in an igloo and invites Oki and his brothers inside. He slips antlers on his feet to grip the ice and subdues them, declaring that the killing is over. It is now time to confront the evil that has plagued the community for so long. With everyone gathered together, Qulitalik calls forth the spirits, and the evil shaman Tungajuaq appears, grunting like a [[polar bear]]. Qulitalik confronts the shaman with the powerful spirit of the walrus and magic soil, Panikpak shakes the walrus tooth necklace, and the shaman is destroyed and vanishes. Panikpak tells the group it is time for forgiveness: Oki, Puja and their friends are forgiven for their evil deeds, but are exiled from Igloolik forever.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Atanarjuat's family===\n*[[Natar Ungalaaq]] as Atanarjuat, \"the fast runner\"\n*Pakak Innuksuk as Amaqjuaq, \"the strong one\", Atanarjuat's older brother\n*Neeve Irngaut as Uluriaq, wife of Amaqjuaq\n*Felix Alaralak as Tulimaq, Atanarjuat's father\n**Stephen Qrunnut as Young Tulimaq\n*Kumaglaq, the young son of Atanarjuat and Atuat; namesake of the old camp leader.\n\n===Oki's family===\n*Peter-Henry Arnatsiaq as Oki, Atanarjuat's rival\n*[[Lucy Tulugarjuk]] as Puja, Oki's spoiled sister\n*Apayata Kotierk as Kumaglak, the old camp leader\n*[[Madeline Ivalu]] as Panikpak, wife of Kumaglak, mother of Sauri, grandmother of Oki and Puja, and sister of Qulitalik\n**Mary Angutautuk as Young Panikpak\n*Pauloosie Qulitalik as Qulitalik, brother of Panikpak\n**Charlie Qulitalik as Young Qulitalik\n*Mary Qulitalik as Niriuniq, wife of Qulitalik\n*Eugene Ipkarnak as Sauri, camp leader\n**Eric Nutarariaq as Young Sauri\n\n===Others===\n*Sylvia Ivalu as Atuat, sought as a wife by Atanarjuat and Oki\n*Abraham Ulayuruluk as Tungajuaq, the evil shaman\n*Luke Taqqaugaq as Pittiulak, Oki's sidekick\n*Alex Uttak as Pakak, Oki's sidekick\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film is set in [[Igloolik]] (\"place of houses\") in the Eastern Arctic wilderness at the dawn of the first millennium,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atanarjuat.com/legend/legend_film.php |title=The Legend Behind The Film |publisher=Igloolik Isuma Productions |access-date=20 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519044856/http://www.atanarjuat.com/legend/legend_film.php |archive-date=19 May 2007 }}</ref> \nThe names of Atanarjuat and his brother first appeared in writing in the journals of the explorer Captain [[George Francis Lyon|George Lyon]], who took part in a British expedition to search for the [[Northwest Passage]] in 1821\u201323.{{sfn|d'Anglure|2002}} The Inuit believe the story of Atanarjuat to be more than five centuries old.{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=3}} This agrees with [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] estimates that Qikiqtaarjuk (Herschel Island<!--Don't link.

The month was important because April is typically the only time of year in Northern Canada when camera equipment could film winter scenes without malfunctioning due to cold.{{sfn|Alioff|2001|p=19}} Kunuk found there was a lack of funding available from Telefilm and the Canadian government, which prioritized English and French-language productions over the languages of [[Aboriginal Peoples in Canada]], and would not provide more than $100,000 for a film in an Aboriginal language, which would make ''Atanarjuat'' impossible.{{sfn|Chun|2002|p=21}}<ref name=\"Seguin\">{{cite magazine |last=Seguin |first=Denis |date=29 August 2005 |title=Freeze frame |magazine=[[Canadian Business]] |volume=78 |issue=17 |pages=42\u201346}}</ref> Kunuk regarded this as [[racial discrimination]].{{sfn|Chun|2002|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nDue to difficulty with funding, Isuma instead successfully appealed for support of the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. Although the NFB had abandoned fiction, Isuma argued that in documenting Inuit mythology, ''Atanarjuat'' was similar to a [[documentary film]].{{sfn|Alioff|2001|p=20}} The budget was approved at $1.96 million.{{sfn|Chun|2002|p=21}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Igloolik Sunset.jpg|thumb|Filming took place in [[Igloolik]], [[Nunavut]].]]\nAchieving historical accuracy was paramount to the production. According to anthropologist [[Bernard Saladin D'Anglure|Bernard Saladin d'Anglure]] the biggest challenge was resurrecting the beliefs and practice of [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanism]], \"the major frame of reference for Inuit life\".{{sfn|d'Anglure|2002}} Research into historical sources\u2014often the journals of European explorers{{sfn|d'Anglure|2002}}\u2014provided the basis for the reconstruction of clothes and customs. Elders were consulted. In an interview, Paul Apak Angilirq said: {{blockquote|We go to the elders and ask information about the old ways, about religion, about things that a lot of people have no remembrance of now... They are helping us write down what people would have said and acted in the past, and what the dialogue would have been like&nbsp;... We speak 'baby talk' compared to the elders. But for ''Atanarjuat'', we want people speaking real Inuktitut&nbsp;... When we are writing the script, they might jump in and say, 'Oh, we wouldn't say such a word to our in-law!
