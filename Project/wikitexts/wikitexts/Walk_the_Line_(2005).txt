The screenplay, written by Mangold and [[Gill Dennis]], is based on two autobiographies authored by singer-songwriter [[Johnny Cash]], 1975's ''[[Man in Black: His Own Story in His Own Words]]'' and 1997's ''[[Cash: The Autobiography]]''. The film follows Cash's early life, his romance with [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]], his ascent in the country music scene, and his struggle with drug addiction. It stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Cash, [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Carter, [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Cash's first wife Vivian Liberto, and [[Robert Patrick]] as Cash's father.\n\n''Walk the Line'' premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 4, 2005, and was theatrically released by  [[20th Century Fox]] on November 18. The film received positive reviews and grossed $187 million on a $28 million budget. At the [[78th Academy Awards]] the film won [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Witherspoon) and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Phoenix), [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400\u2013700 words. Please see WP: FILM PLOT for more information. -->\nIn 1968, as an audience of inmates at [[Folsom State Prison]] cheer for [[Johnny Cash]], he waits backstage near a [[table saw]], reminding him of his early life.\n\nIn 1944, 12-year-old Johnny is raised on a cotton farm in [[Dyess, Arkansas]], with his brother Jack, abusive father Ray, and mother Carrie. One day, Jack is killed in a sawmill accident while Johnny is out fishing; Ray blames Johnny for Jack\u2019s death, saying that the [[Satan|Devil]] \"took the wrong son\".\n\nIn 1950, Johnny enlists in the [[U.S. Air Force]] and is stationed in [[West Germany]]. He purchases a guitar, and in 1952, finds solace in writing songs, one of which he develops as \"[[Folsom Prison Blues]]\".\n\nAfter his discharge in 1954, Cash returns to the United States and marries his girlfriend, [[Vivian Liberto]]. The couple moves to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where Cash works as a door-to-door salesman to support his growing family, but with little success. He walks past a recording studio, which inspires him to organize a band to play [[gospel music]]. Cash's band auditions for [[Sam Phillips]], the owner of [[Sun Records]]. Phillips signs them after they play \"Folsom Prison Blues\", and the band begins touring as Johnny Cash and the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]], alongside fellow rising stars [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].\n\nOn tour, Johnny meets [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]], with whom he falls in love. They become friends, but June gently rebuffs his attempts to woo her. As Johnny\u2019s fame grows, he starts abusing drugs and alcohol.\n\nOver Vivian's objections, Johnny persuades June to go tour with him. The tour is a success, but backstage, Vivian becomes critical of June's influence. After one performance in [[Las Vegas]], Johnny and June sleep together. The next morning, she notices Johnny taking pills, and doubts her choices. At that evening's concert, Johnny, upset by June's apparent rejection, behaves erratically and eventually passes out on stage. June disposes of Johnny's drugs, and begins to write \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\", describing her feelings for him and her pain at watching him descend into addiction.\n\nReturning to [[California]], Johnny travels to [[Mexico]] to purchase more drugs and is arrested. Johnny\u2019s marriage to Vivian implodes; they divorce and he moves to [[Nashville]] in 1966. Trying to reconcile with June, Johnny purchases a large house near a lake in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee|Hendersonville]]. His parents and the extended Carter family arrive for [[Thanksgiving]], at which time Ray and an intoxicated Johnny get into a bitter argument. After the meal, June's mother encourages her daughter to help Cash. He goes into detox and wakes with June; she says they have been given a second chance. They begin a tentative relationship, but June rebuffs his marriage proposals.\n\nJohnny discovers that most of his fan mail is from prisoners. He proposes to skeptical [[Columbia Records]] executives that he will record an [[At Folsom Prison|album live inside Folsom Prison]]. The performance is a success, and Johnny embarks on a tour with June and his band. He later performs \"Ring of Fire\" on stage. After the song, Cash invites June to a duet and stops in the middle, saying he cannot sing \"[[Jackson (Johnny Cash and June Carter song)|Jackson]]\" any more unless June agrees to marry him. June accepts and they share a passionate embrace on stage. Johnny and his father reconcile their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits (11 credited), next five (up to random \"young xx\"), and roles as written per closing credits scroll --->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as [[Johnny Cash]]\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[June Carter Cash|June Carter]]\n* [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as [[Vivian Cash]]\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Ray Cash\n* McGhee Monteith as Reba Cash \n* [[Dallas Roberts]] as [[Sam Phillips]]\n* [[Dan John Miller]] as [[Luther Perkins]]\n* [[Larry Bagby]] as [[Marshall Grant]]\n* [[Shelby Lynne]] as Carrie Cash\n* [[Tyler Hilton]] as [[Elvis Presley]]\n* [[Waylon Payne]] as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]\n* [[Shooter Jennings]] as [[Waylon Jennings]]\n* Sandra Ellis Lafferty as [[Maybelle Carter]]\n* Dan Beene as [[Ezra Carter]]\n* Clay Steakley as [[W.
