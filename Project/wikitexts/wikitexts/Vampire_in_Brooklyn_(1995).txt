It stars [[Eddie Murphy]], who produced and wrote with his brothers Vernon Lynch and [[Charlie Murphy (actor)|Charles Q. Murphy]]. The film co-stars [[Angela Bassett]], [[Allen Payne]], [[Kadeem Hardison]], [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]], [[Zakes Mokae]], and [[Joanna Cassidy]]. Murphy also plays an alcoholic preacher, Pauly, and a foul-mouthed Italian gangster, Guido, respectively.\n\n''Vampire in Brooklyn'' was the final film produced under Eddie Murphy's exclusive contract with [[Paramount Pictures]], which began with ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982) and included the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' [[Beverly Hills Cop (franchise)|franchise]] (1984\u20131994).\n\n''Vampire in Brooklyn'' was released theatrically in the United States on October 27, 1995. It received mostly negative reviews and failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office. Despite this, ''Vampire In Brooklyn'' has become regarded as a cult classic and has been subject to critical re-evaluation especially for Murphy and Bassett\u2019s performances and chemistry, direction and the humor.<ref name=\"editorial.rottentomatoes.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-is-wrong-about-vampire-in-brooklyn/|title=\"Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong\" About...

Elsewhere, Julius Jones, Silas's nephew, has a run-in with some Italian mobsters. Just as the two goons are about to kill Julius, Maximillian, a vampire who arrived on the ship, intervenes and kills them. Max infects Julius with his vampiric blood, thereby turning Julius into a decaying ghoul, and explains that he has come to Brooklyn in search of the [[Dhampir]] daughter of a vampire from his native Caribbean island in order to live beyond the night of the next full moon.\n\nThis Dhampir turns out to be NYPD Detective Rita Veder, still dealing with the death of her mentally ill mother (a paranormal researcher) some months before. As she and her partner, Detective Justice, investigate the murders on the ship, Rita begins having visions about a woman who looks like her, and starts asking questions about her mother's past. Rita is completely unaware of her vampire heritage, and believes she is losing her mind like her mother.\n\nMax initiates a series of sinister methods to pull Rita into his thrall, including seducing and murdering her roommate Nikki, as well as disguising himself as her preacher and a lowlife crook. Max, in these disguises, misleads Rita into thinking Justice slept with Nikki, making her jealous and angry with him. After saving Rita from being run down by a taxicab, Max takes her to dinner. Rita is taken with Max's suave charm, and while dancing with her, he bites her.\n\nThe next day, Justice finds Rita in her apartment, having slept all day with it completely darkened. Justice informs Rita about Nikki's murder, and vows to help understand her visions, as one correctly foretold Nikki's fate. Rita forgives Justice, but she almost bites him in the neck during a passionate kiss before catching her disappearing reflection in a mirror, and realizes she is becoming a vampire. She confronts Max about the changes occurring in her, and deduces he is also responsible for the murders she and Justice are investigating. Rita further finds out that Max was sent to her by her father; his death at the hands of vampire hunters was what drove Rita's mother insane.\n\nMax tries to convince Rita that she will be happier as a vampire instead of remaining in the human world, where he feels she will remain out of place and misunderstood by society. Justice plans to rescue Rita from Max, and seeks advice from Dr. Zeko, a vampire expert they visited earlier in the murder investigation. Zeko explains that he knew Rita's mother while she did her research on the vampires of the Caribbean islands, and she surrendered to evil by falling in love with Rita's father. To avoid becoming a vampire, Rita must refrain from drinking the blood of an innocent human victim and Max must die before the next full moon. Zeko gives Justice an ancient dagger with instructions to either kill Max or risk being killed by Rita.\n\nWhen Justice reaches her, Rita is lying inside Max's coffin, almost completely changed into a vampire, and threatens to bite Justice. Justice and Max fight, during which Justice loses Zeko's dagger on the floor. Max encourages Rita to kill Justice and complete the transformation, but she rejects life as a vampire and drives the dagger through Max's heart, causing him to disintegrate. Rita and Justice kiss.\n\nMeanwhile, Julius, now completely decayed, enters his master's limousine. He finds Max's ring and puts it on, instantly transforming him into a fully intact member of the undead. Overjoyed, he tells Silas, \"There's a new vampire in Brooklyn, and his name is Julius Jones!\", as both of them drive off into the night to parts unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Maximillian / Preacher Pauly / Guido\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Detective Rita Veder\n* [[Allen Payne]] as Detective Justice\n* [[Kadeem Hardison]] as Julius Jones\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Silas Green\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Dr. Zeko\n* [[Joanna Cassidy]] as Captain Dewey\n* [[W.

This was probably the most fun\u2014''I'm Gon Git You Sucka'' was close. [[Damon Wayans]] was my comedy guru. But Ed was some kind of Jesus, he was a god. And for him to call me on the phone and say, 'I've seen all the tapes, you're the only one in town that can do it,' that was like, 'Oh shit!

Her name was Sonia Davis and there was a lot of weight on that film because of it. It was a pretty awful thing and then after that, the combination of Eddie Murphy wanting to make a movie that was completely in the vein of The Serpent and the Rainbow, which is one of Wes's best films, and the studio Paramount wanted them to make essentially a sort of Horror version of Beverly Hills Cop. The original drafts of the script were much darker and much, much more Brooklyn centric and very, very cool. I think the original ending had an oil tanker truck hanging off the side of the Brooklyn Bridge and this sort of fight with Eddie, Angela Bassett and Allen Payne all in is this thing. I remember him telling me one day that the head of the studio at Paramount had dragged him in after seeing some of the dailies and was yelling at him that it needed to be funny. It needed to be funny the way Jack Nicholson was funny in The Shining, when he says, \u2018here's Johnny\u2019 and Wes's response was, \u2018Do you hear yourself? You're saying this needs to be funny, like The Shining\u2026 so I think it was a brutally hard experience for so many reasons.\u201c<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.scream-thrillogy.com/2021/01/interview-with-patrick-lussier.html | title=Interview with Patrick Lussier }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nChris Parker, one of the screenwriters said: \"I don't want to disparage ''Vampire in Brooklyn''. I love it. I\u2019m so glad it happened.\" Michael Lucker, also one of the screenwriters, is happy about the legacy of the film: \"What's strange is as the years go by, no matter where I go, there are people who love this movie and know lines from it. I live in Atlanta, and whenever it comes up with people in the community it's met with such a positive response and wide grins.\"<ref>{{cite web |date= 27 October 2015 |title= Drugs, death and that wig: An oral history of 'Vampire in Brooklyn' |url= http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/culture/film/216583-vampire-in-brooklyn-oral-history |website= Hopes&Fears }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]''\n* [[Eddie Murphy filmography]]\n* [[List of film accidents]]\n* [[Vampire films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{AFI film}}\n* {{TCMDb title}}\n\n{{Wes Craven}}\n{{Eddie Murphy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vampire In Brooklyn}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1995 horror films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:African-American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American vampire films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wes Craven]]\n[[Category:Films scored by J.
