The screenplay is by [[Gilbert Adair]], based on his 1988 novel ''[[The Holy Innocents (Adair novel)|The Holy Innocents]]''. An [[international co-production]] by companies from France, the [[United Kingdom]], and Italy, the film tells the story of an American university student in Paris who, after meeting a peculiar brother and sister who are fellow film enthusiasts, becomes entangled in an [[Love triangle|erotic triangle]]. It is set against the backdrop of the [[May 1968 in France|1968 Paris student riots]]. The film makes several references to various movies of [[classical Hollywood|classical]] and [[French New Wave]] cinema, incorporating clips from films that are often imitated by the actors in particular scenes.\n\nThere are two versions: an uncut [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|NC-17]]-rated version, and an R-rated version that is about three minutes shorter.\n\n==Plot==\nMatthew is an American [[Student exchange program|exchange student]] who has come to [[Paris]] to study French. While at the [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]] protesting the firing of [[Henri Langlois]], he meets the free-spirited twins Th\u00e9o and Isabelle. The three bond over a shared love of film. \nAfter dinner with their parents, Th\u00e9o and Isabelle offer Matthew the chance to stay with them while their parents are on a trip. Matthew accepts, considering them his first French friends.\n\nMatthew becomes suspicious of their relationship after seeing them sleeping nude together; he soon discovers that they accept nudity and sexuality liberally. After Th\u00e9o loses at a trivia game, Isabelle sentences him to masturbate to a [[Marlene Dietrich]] poster in front of them. After Matthew loses at another game, he is seduced to take Isabelle's virginity. The two then become lovers.\n\nMatthew begins to accept Th\u00e9o and Isabelle's sexuality and his time living with them soon becomes idyllic. The three re-enact a [[Bande \u00e0 part (film)#Memorable scenes|memorable scene from ''Bande \u00e0 part'']] by \"breaking the world record for running through the Louvre\", and Matthew and Th\u00e9o engage in playful arguments about [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]], as well as the subject of [[Maoism]], which Th\u00e9o fervently believes in.\n\nDuring this time, Matthew begins to pursue a relationship with Isabelle, separate from Th\u00e9o. Matthew and Isabelle leave the house and go on a regular date, which she has not experienced before. Th\u00e9o retaliates by inviting a companion up to his room, upsetting Isabelle. She distances herself from both Th\u00e9o and Matthew, only to find them next to each other on Th\u00e9o's bed when an argument between the two turns erotic. She then surprises them with a makeshift bedsheet fort and they fall asleep in each other's arms.\n\nOne morning, Th\u00e9o and Isabelle's parents arrive home and find the trio naked in bed together. They are startled by what they find, but leave them be, departing after leaving a cheque. After they leave, Isabelle wakes up and discovers the cheque, realising that their parents have found them. Wordlessly, she attaches a hose to the gas outlet and lies back down with Th\u00e9o and Matthew, attempting to commit suicide. After a few moments, however, they are woken by a brick being hurled through the window; they discover [[May 68|hundreds of students rioting in the streets]].\n\nAll three of them are overjoyed and proceed to join the protesters. Later on, Th\u00e9o joins a small team of protesters preparing [[molotov cocktail]]s. Matthew tries to stop Th\u00e9o by kissing him and his sister, arguing against violence, but he is shunned by both Th\u00e9o and Isabelle.\n\nAs Matthew walks away through the chaos, Th\u00e9o takes Isabelle's hand and hurls a molotov cocktail at a line of police. The police charge the crowd.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Please do not add any more cast names, this is the full cast list from IMDb -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Pitt]] as Matthew\n* [[Eva Green]] as Isabelle\n* [[Louis Garrel]] as Th\u00e9o\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Mother\n* [[Robin Renucci]] as Father\n* [[Jean-Pierre Kalfon]] as Himself\n* [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as Himself\n* Florian Cadiou as Patrick\n* Pierre Hancisse as First buff\n* Valentin Merlet as Second buff\n* Lola Peploe as The Usherette\n* Ingy Fillion as Th\u00e9o's girlfriend\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe first draft of the screenplay was an adaptation by [[Gilbert Adair]] of his own novel, ''[[The Holy Innocents (Adair novel)|The Holy Innocents]]'' (1988), inspired by the novel ''[[Les Enfants terribles]]'' (1929) by [[Jean Cocteau]] and the [[Les Enfants terribles (film)|eponymous film]] directed by [[Jean-Pierre Melville]] in 1950. During [[pre-production]], Bertolucci made changes to it: he \"peppered the narrative with clips from the films he loves\" and dropped homosexual content \u2013 including scenes from the novel that depict Matthew and Th\u00e9o having sex \u2013 which he felt was \"just too much.\" After the film was released, he said that it was \"faithful to the spirit of the book but not the letter.\"<ref name=\"guard\">[http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1141677,00.html Stealing beauty], a February 2004 article from ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\n[[Eva Green]] told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that her agent and her parents begged her not to take the role of Isabelle, concerned that the film \u2013 which features full [[frontal nudity]] and graphic sex scenes \u2013 would cause her career to \"have the same destiny as [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]].\"<ref name=\"guard\"/> [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] screen tested for the role of Matthew alongside Green, but eventually removed himself from consideration due to concerns about the film\u2019s nudity.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2003-12-30 |title=CONFESSIONS OF A NERVOUS MUSE: Eva Green, interviewed. {{!}} Neil Young's Film Lounge |url=https://www.jigsawlounge.co.uk/film/reviews/neil-youngs-film-lounge-eva-green-confessions-of-a-nervous-muse/ |access-date=2022-07-08 |website=www.jigsawlounge.co.uk |language=en}}</ref> [[Michael Pitt]] was cast instead.\n\nWhen Green saw a [[rough cut]] of the film, she said she was \"quite shocked\" and had to look away during the sex scenes; she later told an interviewer that for her, \"it was as though I was wearing a costume while we were making the film. It was as if I had another story in my mind.

Janice Ginsberg is credited as music supervisor and [[Nick Laird-Clowes]] as music consultant. The soundtrack was released in February 2004; [[Allmusic]] gave it three out of five, noting that \"while its juxtapositions of French tradition and counterculture are jarring at times, ''Dreamers'' still does a worthy job of capturing the film's personal and political revolutions through music.\"<ref name=\"allm\">{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r677983|label=The Dreamers (Original Soundtrack)}}</ref>\n\n# \"[[Third Stone from the Sun]]\" \u2013 [[Jimi Hendrix]]\n# \"[[Hey Joe]]\" ([[cover version]]) \u2013 [[Michael Pitt]] & The Twins of Evil\n# \"Quatre Cents Coups\" (from the score of \"[[The 400 Blows|Les Quatre Cents Coups]]\") \u2013 [[Jean Constantin (songwriter)|Jean Constantin]]\n# \"New York Herald Tribune\" (from ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'') \u2013 [[Martial Solal]]\n# \"Love Me Please Love Me\" \u2013 [[Michel Polnareff]]\n# \"[[La Mer (song)|La Mer]]\" \u2013 [[Charles Trenet]]\n# \"[[Sailor (album)#Track listing|Song For Our Ancestors]]\" \u2013 [[Steve Miller Band]]\n# \"[[Morrison Hotel#Track listing|The Spy]]\" \u2013 [[The Doors]]\n# \"[[Tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles]]\" \u2013 [[Fran\u00e7oise Hardy]]\n# \"Ferdinand\" (from [[Antoine Duhamel]]'s score of \"[[Pierrot le fou|Pierrot Le Fou]]\")\n# \"[[Dark Star (song)|Dark Star]]\" (special band edit) \u2013 [[The Grateful Dead]]\n# \"[[Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien]]\" \u2013 [[Edith Piaf]]\n\nThough the music of [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] was featured prominently in the film, none of the songs were included on the soundtrack. All of the songs used in the film were from the album ''[[Live at Winterland '68]]''. [[Bob Dylan]]'s song \"[[Queen Jane Approximately]]\", from the album ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'', is also used in the film but is not included on the soundtrack. [[The Doors]] song \"Maggie M'Gill\" can be heard in the movie, but is not included on the soundtrack either.\n\n==Home media==\n''The Dreamers'' was released on [[DVD]] in 2004. It includes a [[BBC]] film directed by [[David M. Thompson]], ''Bertolucci Makes The Dreamers'', narrated by [[Zo\u00eb Wanamaker]], and a documentary ''Outside the Window: Events in France, May 1968'' with contributions from [[Robin Blackburn]], Adair, and Bertolucci. Bertolucci says that 1968 was about cinema, politics, music, journalism, sex and philosophy dreaming together.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Eros and Civilization]]\n* ''[[Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*{{IMDb title|0309987}}\n*{{tcmdb title|537314}}\n*{{allrovi movie|285859}}\n*{{mojo title|dreamers}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|dreamers}}\n\n{{Bernardo Bertolucci}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dreamers}}\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2000s erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:French erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:British erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:Italian erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bernardo Bertolucci]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1968]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films about threesomes]]\n[[Category:Films about twins]]\n[[Category:May 1968 events in France]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jeremy Thomas]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:English-language Italian films]]\n[[Category:2003 drama films]]\n[[Category:Twins in fiction]]\n[[Category:2003 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:British multilingual films]]\n[[Category:French multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Italian multilingual films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
