It is loosely based on the 2004 novel ''[[The Spook's Apprentice]]'' (titled ''The Last Apprentice: Revenge of the Witch'' in the United States) by [[Joseph Delaney]]. The story centers on Thomas Ward, a [[seventh son of a seventh son]], and his adventures as the apprentice of the Spook. After having its release date shifted numerous times, the film was released in France on December 17, 2014, and in Canada and the United States on February 6, 2015, by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. ''Seventh Son'' received generally negative reviews from film critics and it earned $114 million on a $95 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1572, the witch Malkin is imprisoned underground by Gregory, the last of the Falcons, a knightly order which defended mankind against supernatural threats. Years later, Gregory works as a \"spook\" \u2013 a roving witch hunter.\n\nMalkin escapes, killing Gregory's apprentice William, and fleeing to her mountain fortress. She restores the fortress and the beauty of her disfigured, loyal sister, Bony Lizzie. The coming centennial [[Full moon#Hunter's moon|blood moon]] will make Malkin unstoppable.\n\nGregory seeks out Tom Ward \u2013 the [[seventh son of a seventh son]] \u2013 as his new apprentice. Tom's Mam gives him her necklace as a talisman, urging him to wear it always. In a town, Tom sees a girl, Alice, about to be burned as a witch. Recognizing her from his [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] visions, Tom frees her. Alice requests that he not tell Gregory about her. She is revealed to be Lizzie's daughter, sent to spy on Gregory. Malkin begins gathering an army of minions.\n\nTom meets Gregory's assistant, Tusk. With only a week before the blood moon is full, reviving Malkin's full power, Tom must rush through his training while the trio head to Malkin's fortress. En route, Gregory is summoned to a walled city by an [[inquisitor]] whose forces have subdued one of Malkin's followers, a werebear named Urag. Tom hesitates when instructed to burn the werebear alive, causing Gregory to dismiss him and light the flame himself. Tom meets Alice again; the two share their feelings for each other and fall in love. They briefly consider running off, but Tom has a vision of Malkin killing Gregory and unleashing destruction upon the world. Tom returns to Gregory, who reveals that he once loved Malkin, leading him to imprison rather than kill her. Gregory feels responsible for every person killed by Malkin, and warns Tom never to show mercy to witches.\n\nThe trio are attacked on the road by an enormous [[boggart]]. Tom kills it and survives being swept down a waterfall. He is confronted by Bony Lizzie, whose attack is repelled by his Mam's necklace. Gregory recognizes it as the Umbran Stone, which increases the power of witches. It had once belonged to Malkin, until one of her witch followers \u2013 Tom's Mam \u2013 stole it, weakening Malkin enough for Gregory to trap her.\n\nMalkin instructs Alice to steal the stone, promising to spare Tom's life. Malkin and her minions destroy the city where Urag was killed, to avenge his death. By chance, Tom's family is in the city; his Mam kills the warlock Strix and confronts Malkin with her own powers. Malkin kills her, mocking her for giving away the stone that might have saved her life.\n\nAlice finds Tom and pleads with him to leave with her. Gregory tries to kill her, but Tom intervenes, allowing her to flee. Gregory points out she has taken the necklace, and Tom, Gregory and Tusk pursue her. Malkin's servant Radu attacks them; he captures Gregory and drives Tusk and Tom over a cliff, leaving them for dead. Tom wakes to a vision of his Mam telling him that, as both the seventh son of a seventh son, and the son of a witch, he has a unique power to defeat Malkin.\n\nThe witches gather as Malkin attempts to seduce Gregory. Alice is horrified when told that Tom is dead, and grabs the stone from Malkin, breaking Malkin's hold on Gregory. Malkin transforms into a dragon, and Lizzie also transforms, to protect her daughter. Tom retrieves the stone and, fighting together, Gregory, Tom and Alice kill several of Malkin's minions. Malkin kills Lizzie, but is seriously wounded. Gregory follows Malkin into her room and confronts her. Appearing close to death, she recalls their relationship, but then seizes Gregory with her claws. Tom enters and hurls a blade at Malkin, making her release her grip. Tom kills Malkin and they burn her body.\n\nGregory brands Tom's hand, declaring him a Falcon knight. Alice accepts that Tom's vocation means they cannot be together, but promises they will meet again. Gregory leaves for parts unknown, leaving Tom and Tusk to continue his work, but urging Tom not to follow the \"rules\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles per closing credits scroll, until last included in tombstone credits --->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as [[List of The Wardstone Chronicles characters#John Gregory (The Spook)|Master Gregory]]\n* [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as [[List of The Wardstone Chronicles characters#Thomas Jason Ward|Tom Ward]]\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as [[List of The Wardstone Chronicles characters#The Malkin Clan|Mother Malkin]]\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as [[List of The Wardstone Chronicles characters#Alice Deane|Alice]]\n* [[Antje Traue]] as [[List of The Wardstone Chronicles characters#The Malkin Clan|Bony Lizzie]]\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Mam Ward\n* [[John DeSantis]] as Tusk\n* [[Kit Harington]] as William Bradley\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as Radu\n* Gerard Plunkett as Inquisitor\n* [[Jason Scott Lee]] as Urag\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Sam Claflin]] was in negotiations to star as Tom Ward,<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/seventh-son-finds-young-leads-1118034783/|title='Seventh Son' finds young leads|first=Justin|last=Kroll|date=March 31, 2011|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=April 1, 2011|archive-date=November 2, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102133014/http://variety.com/2011/film/news/seventh-son-finds-young-leads-1118034783/}}</ref> but in June 2011, negotiations with Claflin fell through and [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] replaced him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|title='Narnia' star Ben Barnes is WB's 'Son'|url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/narnia-star-ben-barnes-is-wb-s-son-1118039092/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=April 15, 2014|date=June 24, 2011|archive-date=April 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416233718/http://variety.com/2011/film/news/narnia-star-ben-barnes-is-wb-s-son-1118039092/|url-status=live}}</ref> Production began on March 19, 2012, in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Sandy|last=Schaefer|url=https://screenrant.com/seventh-son-movie-updates-sandy-161281|title='Seventh Son' Begins Filming; Official Synopsis Released|work=Screen Rant|date=March 26, 2012|access-date=March 31, 2012|archive-date=October 31, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031002210/http://screenrant.com/seventh-son-movie-updates-sandy-161281}}</ref> In February 2013, Legendary Pictures agreed to give $5 million to recently bankrupt visual effects house [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]] so they would complete their work on ''Seventh Son''.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 20, 2013|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seventh-son-rhythm-hues-seeks-422619|title='Seventh Son': Rhythm & Hues Seeks Judge's Approval of $5M to Finish Jeff Bridges Film|access-date=July 15, 2013|archive-date=February 24, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224055253/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seventh-son-rhythm-hues-seeks-422619}}</ref>\n\nBy the time production wrapped, the budget had ballooned to as much as $110 million.<ref name=DeadlineBudget/> [[China Film Group]] made an \"eight-figure\" equity investment in the film, as well as the adaptation of ''[[Warcraft (film)|Warcraft]]'' (2016).<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/state-owned-china-film-group-696091|title= State-Owned China Film Group Makes Groundbreaking Investment in 'Warcraft,' 'Seventh Son'|author= Clifford Coonan|date= April 14, 2014|access-date= December 12, 2015|work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nIt was originally announced that [[A.
