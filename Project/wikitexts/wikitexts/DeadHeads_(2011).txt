Pierce.  It stars Michael McKiddy and Ross Kidder as sentient zombies who go on a road trip.\n\n== Plot ==\nMike and Brent are inexplicably coherent zombies who become self-aware during a zombie attack.  As Mike's memories slowly come back to him, he recalls wanting to visit his girlfriend so that he can tell her that he loves her.  Brent adopts a feral zombie which he dubs \"Cheese\", and they set off, not knowing that they are being tracked by an evil corporation.  Eventually captured by a zombie hunter hired by the corporation, the boys escape and make their way to Mike's girlfriend, who accepts him despite his condition.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* Michael McKiddy as Mike Kellerman\n* Ross Kidder as Brent Guthrie\n* Markus Taylor as Cheese\n* Thomas Galasso as Thomas Jeremiah\n* Natalie Victoria as Ellie Masterson\n* Eden Malyn as Emily\n* Benjamin Webster as McDinkle\n* Greg Dow as Gillman\n* Harry Burkey as Cliff\n* Leonard Kelly-Young as Charles\n* Kasey Bell as Rob\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nProduction completed in March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/19337/first-look-at-deadheads-horror-comedy/|title=First Look at 'Deadheads' Horror Comedy|last=Miska|first=Brad|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2010-03-03|accessdate=2014-04-06}}</ref>  The ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|Evil Dead]]'' franchise was an inspiration for the directors, brothers whose father worked on the first film in that series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodsprayer.com/interview-w-brett-pierce-co-director-of-deadheads/|title=Interview w/ Brett Pierce, Co-Director of 'Deadheads'|work=Bloodsprayer.com|date=2011-01-04|accessdate=2014-04-06}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''DeadHeads'' premiered at the [[Newport Beach Film Festival]] on April 29, 2011.
