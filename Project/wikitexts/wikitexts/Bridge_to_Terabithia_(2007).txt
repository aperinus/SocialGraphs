Paterson]] and Jeff Stockwell. It is based on the [[Bridge to Terabithia (novel)|1977 novel of the same name]] by [[Katherine Paterson]]. The film stars [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Bailee Madison]], [[Zooey Deschanel]], and [[Robert Patrick]]. It follows two 11-year-old neighbors who create a fantasy world called Terabithia to cope with reality and spend their free time together in an abandoned tree house.\n\nThe original novel was based on events from the childhood of the author's son, screenwriter David Paterson. When he asked his mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed in part because of his ability as a playwright. Produced by [[Walden Media]], principal photography was shot in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, within 60 days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took several months, with the film fully completed by November 2006. This was [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]]'s last film as a cinematographer before his retirement and eventual death in 2020.\n\n''Bridge to Terabithia'' was theatrically released in the United States on February 16, 2007, by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics who praised the visuals, performances and faithfulness to the source material. It was a box-office success, grossing $137.6 million worldwide against its budget of $20\u201325 million. At the [[29th Young Artist Awards]], the film won all five awards for which it was nominated.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--- PLOTS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400\u2013700 WORDS PER [[WP:FILMPLOT]] --->\nJesse \"Jess\" Aarons is an 11-year-old aspiring artist living with his financially struggling family in Lark Creek. He rides the bus to school with his younger sister May Belle where he avoids the school bully Janice Avery. In class, Jess is also bullied by classmates Scott Hoager and Gary Fulcher and meets a new student named Leslie Burke. At recess, Jess enters a running event, for which he has been training at home. Leslie also enters and manages to win, much to Jess' irritation. On the way home, Jess and Leslie learn they are next-door neighbors.\n\nJess has a difficult relationship with his father, who spends more time with May Belle. Due to their financial struggles, his mother also forces him to wear his older sister's sneakers. One day at school, Leslie compliments Jess' drawing ability and they become friends.\n\nAfter school, they venture into the woods and swing across a creek on a rope. Jess and Leslie find an abandoned treehouse on the other side and invent a new world, which they call Terabithia. For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the treehouse getting to know each other.\n\nLeslie gives Jess an art kit on his birthday. Jess becomes angry with his father for his attitude towards him and he loses his belief in Terabithia, and refuses its existence the next day at school. Later, Jess apologizes to Leslie by giving her a puppy, whom she names Prince Terrien (P.T).\n\nOnce in Terabithia, they encounter various creatures, including a giant troll resembling Janice, squirrel-like creatures resembling Hoager called \"Squogers\", and \"Hairy Vultures\" resembling Fulcher.\n\nAt school, Leslie becomes frustrated by Janice Avery's bullying. Jess and Leslie play a prank on Janice and she is embarrassed in front of everyone on the bus. Leslie introduces Jess to her parents and they help paint their house. At school, Leslie discovers from Janice that her bullying is due to her abusive father, and the two become friends, with Janice later befriending Jess as well. Jess and Leslie take P.T to Terabithia, where they fight off the Dark Master's creatures resembling their bullies, this time with the troll as their ally.\n\nThe next morning, Ms. Edmunds, the music teacher who Jess has a crush on, calls to invite him on a one-on-one field trip to an art museum. When Jess returns home, his father reveals that Leslie died after hitting her head in the creek when the rope she used snapped. Jess first denies it and runs to check on Leslie, but he notices the severed rope as well as emergency vehicles surrounding her house before eventually accepting her death.\n\nThe following day, Jess and his parents visit the Burke family to pay their respects. Leslie's father Bill tells Jess she loved him and thanks him for being the best friend she ever had since she never had friends at her old school. Jess feels overwhelming guilt for Leslie's death, lashing out at both Hoager and May Belle, and imagining the Dark Master from Terabithia chasing after him before breaking down into tears, but his father comforts and consoles him. Jess says Leslie is gone forever, but his father tells him she will never be as long as he keeps her memory alive.\n\nJess decides to re-imagine Terabithia and builds a bridge across the river to welcome a new ruler. He invites May Belle to Terabithia and the siblings agree to rule together, with Jess as king and May Belle as the princess.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Bridge to Terabithia characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as Jess Aarons, a 12-year-old aspiring artist.\n* [[AnnaSophia Robb]] as Leslie Burke, a girl who Jess befriends.\n* [[Bailee Madison]] as May Belle Aarons, the little sister of Jess.\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Ms. Edmunds, a music teacher that Jess likes.\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Jack Aarons, the father of Jess and May Belle.\n* Kate Butler as Mary Aarons, the mother of Jess and May Belle.\n* Devon Wood as Brenda Aarons, the older sister of Jess and May Belle.\n* Emma Fenton as Ellie Aarons, the older sister of Jess and May Belle.\n* Grace Brannigan as Joyce Aarons, the baby sister of Jess and May Belle.\n* [[Latham Gaines]] as Bill Burke, the father of Leslie.\n* Judy McIntosh as Judy Burke, the mother of Leslie.\n* Patricia Aldersley as Grandma Burke, the grandmother of Leslie.\n* Lauren Clinton as Janice Avery, a bully of Jess and Leslie who serves as the inspiration to the giant troll\n* Isabelle Kircher as Carla\n* Cameron Wakefield as Scott Hoager, one of Jess's bullies who serves as the inspiration to the squirrel-like Squogres.\n* Elliot Lawless as Gary Fulcher, one of Jess's bullies who serves as the inspiration to the hairy vultures.\n* Carly Owen as Madison\n* Jen Wolfe as Mrs. Myers, a teacher.\n* [[James Gaylyn]] as Principal Turner\n* Ian Harcourt as Kenny, a bus driver.\n* Phil Grieve as Mr. Bailey\n* Matt Gibbons as the Dark Master, an evil being in Terebithia that antagonizes Jess and Leslie.\n* Paddy as Prince Terrien, a dog that is adopted by the Burke family.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n=== Development ===\nThe film was directed by [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Rugrats]]'' co-creator and former [[Hanna-Barbera]] animator [[G\u00e1bor Csup\u00f3]], who was first recommended for the job by [[Walden Media]] President [[Cary Granat]].

Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination.<ref name=\"prodnotes\" /> While Paterson focused on \"bringing out the emotions of the story,\" he admitted to having difficulty writing about Terabithia \"because it was too close\". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film. \"What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn't so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way\", David said. Csup\u00f3 noted that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film than they are in the book. Csup\u00f3 reasons that the movie \"deals with so many issues including friendship, and maybe first innocent love, things like that\", so it \"made more sense\" to make the characters older.<ref name=\"csupomoviesonline\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Bailee Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bailee Madison]] was cast as May Belle Aarons.]]\n\nDirector Csup\u00f3 stated that they had no actors initially in mind for the film. The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke. Robb wrote Csup\u00f3 \"such a beautiful, heartwarming letter\" that expressed her love for the book and the character. Csup\u00f3 said that he cast her because of \"her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material\". Robb also conversed with producer Lauren Levine before casting even began, and \"their conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role\". Levine said that \"it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven.\"<ref name=\"prodnotes\" /> With regard to the character, Robb said \"[Leslie]'s one of those people who's just always lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down.

Patrick explained that he related to the story because he was \"constantly creating imaginary worlds as a kid\" himself, and that the film's setting reminded him of where he grew up. He also said that he took on the role because he wanted to star in a film that his children could watch.<ref name=\"prodnotes\" />\n\nCsup\u00f3 said that they cast [[Bailee Madison]] as May Belle Aarons after weeks of searching for an actress to play the part.

The film was finished by November 2006, because the crew \"had to rush\" to meet the February 16 deadline.<ref name=\"moviejungle\" />\n\n===Design and effects===\n\nCsup\u00f3 explained that \"it was a very conscious decision from the very beginning that we're not going to overdo the visual effects because of the story's integrity and the book's integrity\", because there was only a brief mention of Jess and Leslie fighting imaginary creatures in the forest in the novel. With that in mind, they \"tried to do the absolute minimum, which would be required to put it into a movie version\".<ref name=\"csupomoviesonline\" />\n\nIn designing the fantasy creatures found in Terabithia, Csup\u00f3 wanted to make creatures that were \"little more artsy, imaginative, fantastical creatures than the typical rendered characters you see in other movies\", and drew inspiration from [[Terry Gilliam]] and [[Ridley Scott]]. Dima Malanitchev came up with the drawings for the creatures with Csup\u00f3's guidance.<ref name=\"imaginaryeffects\" /> Csup\u00f3 chose to have [[Weta Digital]] render the 3D animation because he \"was impressed with their artistic integrity, the teamwork, the [fact that] people were really nice, and also they responded to our designs very positively\". Weta modified some of the creature designs, but ultimately remained faithful to Csup\u00f3's original designs.<ref name=\"imaginaryeffects\" />\n\nThere were around 100 crew members from Weta working on the effects for the film. Weta was already working on animating the creatures while the film was being shot, and Weta crew members were on-set for all the scenes that involved special effects during the filming. Weta visual effects supervisor [[Matt Aitken (special effects artist)|Matt Aitken]] explained that process involved in interpreting the creatures was \"split into two steps\". First, natural-looking creatures were created based on pencil sketches by Csup\u00f3 and Malanitchev, and this was done mostly through Photoshop collages done by visual effects art director Michael Pangrazio. The second step was to figure out animation or motion styles that best suited these creatures.<ref name=\"vfx\" />\n\nLeslie's costumes in the film were designed to look as if the character \"might have made some of them herself\", and they were updated from those described in the book to reflect what would currently be considered eccentric.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bridge to Terabithia: The Official Movie Companion|last=Paterson|first=David|year=2007|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-121531-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780061215315/page/24 24]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780061215315/page/24}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Bridge to Terabithia (soundtrack)}}\n\n''[[Music from and Inspired by Bridge to Terabithia]]'' is the soundtrack album to the film, released by [[Hollywood Records]] on February 13, 2007.<ref name=\"soundtracknet\" /> The original score is composed by [[Aaron Zigman]], who took of the scoring duties from [[Alison Krauss]], after her exit from the project.<ref>{{cite web\n | last=Larson \n | first=Randall \n | title=Zigman hired to compose score for ''Bridge to Terabithia'' \n | publisher=Mania.com \n | date=July 13, 2006 \n | url=http://www.mania.com/zigman-hired-to-compose-score-for-bridge-to-terabithia_article_51697.html \n | access-date=April 27, 2009 \n | url-status=dead \n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110112337/http://www.mania.com/zigman-hired-to-compose-score-for-bridge-to-terabithia_article_51697.html \n | archive-date=November 10, 2010 \n}}</ref> Zigman, who also scored ''[[Flicka]]'' simultaneously with ''Bridge to Terabithia'' compared both the film's having Celtic influence a bit, but added the score of the latter as more modern and orchestral compared to the former.<ref name=\"soundtracknet\" /><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/fmw/issues/FM_Weekly_021907.pdf | title=Crossing the Bridge | author=Schweiger, Daniel | date=February 19, 2007 | issue=3 | journal=Film Music Weekly | publisher=Global Media Development Group | pages=6\u20137 | access-date=June 21, 2014}}</ref> Four of the tracks from the film's score, was only featured in the soundtrack, and Zigman's score was separately released from the album, on December 2007, only for promotional use.<ref name=\"soundtracknet\">{{cite web| title = SoundtrackNet : Interview&nbsp;- Aaron Zigman| publisher=[[SoundtrackNet]]| date =February 2007| url = http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=219| access-date = April 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Marketing and promotion===\nThe promotion and advertising for the film was met with criticism and controversy.
