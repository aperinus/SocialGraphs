It is the second installment in the [[Alex Cross (film series)|''Alex Cross'' film series]] and a sequel to the 1997 film ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'', with [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[Jay O. Sanders]] reprising their roles as detective [[Alex Cross]] and FBI-agent Kyle Craig. The screenplay by Marc Moss was adapted from the [[Along Came a Spider (novel)|1993 novel of the same title]] by [[James Patterson]], but many of the key plot elements of the book were eliminated. The film was a box office success, although receiving mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter [[Washington, D.C.]] detective, [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologist]] and [[author]] [[Alex Cross]] loses control of a [[sting operation]], resulting in the death of his partner, he retires from the force. He is drawn back to police work when Megan Rose, the daughter of a [[United States Senate|United States senator]], is kidnapped from her exclusive private school by Gary Soneji, a [[computer science]] teacher. [[United States Secret Service|US Secret Service]] Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan, held responsible for the breach in security, joins forces with Cross to find the missing girl.\n\nSoneji contacts Cross by phone and alerts him to the fact one of Megan's [[sneakers]] is in the detective's mailbox, proving that Soneji is the kidnapper. Cross deduces that the man is obsessed with the 1932 [[Lindbergh kidnapping|Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. kidnapping]] and hopes to become as infamous as [[Bruno Hauptmann]] by committing a new \"Crime of the Century\", which might be explored by Cross in one of his [[true crime]] books. Megan's kidnapping proves to be only part of Soneji's real plan: to kidnap Dimitri Starodubov, the son of the [[President of Russia|Russian president]], and guarantee greater infamy for himself.\n\nAfter Cross and Flannigan foil his second kidnapping plot, a supposed call from the kidnapper demands that Cross deliver a [[ransom]] of $10 million in diamonds, by following an intricate maze of calls made to public [[phone booth]]s scattered throughout the city. Following the ransom directions, Cross ultimately tosses the gems out the window of a rapidly moving [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority|Metro]] train to a figure standing by the tracks. Soneji later arrives at Flannigan's home and confronts Cross after disabling Flannigan with a [[taser]]. Because Soneji has not reacted to Cross's verbal comment about receiving the ransom amount (which was incorrect), the detective realizes that the kidnapper is unaware of the ransom demand and delivery. Soneji tries to leave with Flannigan, but Cross kills him.\n\nCross becomes suspicious and realizes that someone else discovered Soneji long before his plot came to fruition. After searching Flannigan's [[personal computer]], he finds enough evidence to prove that Flannigan and her fellow Secret Service agent Ben Devine used Soneji as a pawn in their own plot to collect a ransom for Megan. He tracks them down to a secluded farmhouse, where Flannigan has murdered Devine and is now intent on killing Megan. Cross stops Flannigan by shooting her in the heart, killing her. Cross then takes Megan to her parents.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Dr. [[Alex Cross]]\n* [[Monica Potter]] as Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as Jonathan 'The Spider' Mercusio / Gary Soneji\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as FBI Special Agent-In-Charge Ollie McArthur\n* [[Mika Boorem]] as Megan Ann Rose\n* [[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]] as Secret Service Agent Ben Devine\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Dimitri Starodubov\n* [[Jay O.

After a lengthy trial for kidnapping and several murders not included in the film, he is found guilty but remanded to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]] to serve his sentence. Also missing from the film is a romantic relationship shared by Cross and Jezzie, her trial and eventual  [[Execution (legal)|execution]] by [[lethal injection]], and the discovery of Megan (Maggie as she is known in the book), hidden away with a native [[Bolivia]]n family near the [[Andes Mountains]], two years after her kidnapping.\n\nA few other minor differences from the [[Along Came a Spider (novel)|original book]] include: Dimitri (Michael \"Shrimpie\" Goldberg as referred to in the book) being kidnapped at the same time as Megan (Maggie); Megan's (Maggie's) mother was the more famous of her parents, being a popular actress;  when the children are kidnapped they are sprayed with [[Chloroform|chloroform spray]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nBox office receipts totaled [[United States dollar|US$]]105,178,561, of which $74,078,174 was from the United States having earned US$16,712,407 in its opening weekend at 2,530 theaters.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |title=Along Came a Spider |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=alongcameaspider.htm |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=IMDb.com, Inc |access-date=20 September 2020 }}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 32% based on reviews from 126 critics. The site's critics consensus was \"Derivative and contains too many implausible situations.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Along Came a Spider (2001) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/along_came_a_spider/ |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=Fandango Media |access-date=October 10, 2020 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 42% based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Along Came a Spider |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/along-came-a-spider |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=2020-05-04 }}</ref><!-- CinemaScore: ALONG CAME A SPIDER (2001)\tB+ -->\n\n[[Elvis Mitchell]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film an \"overplotted, hollow thriller, which crams in so much exposition that characters speak in fetid hunks for what seems like minutes at a time ... But ''Spider'' couldn't be better served than it is by Mr. Freeman, whose prickly smarts and silken impatience bring believability to a classless, underdeveloped thriller ... Still, he is wasted in this impersonal, almost inept thriller.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Elvis|last=Mitchell|author-link=Elvis Mitchell|title=FILM REVIEW; Weaving an Intricate Web To Trap a Wily Kidnapper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/06/arts/06SPID.html|access-date=20 September 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 April 2001}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a mixed 2 out of 4 stars, calling it \"loophole-riddled, verging on the nonsensical\". He wrote, \"I'm wondering, since Dr. Alex Cross is so brilliant, how come he doesn't notice yawning logical holes in the very fabric of the story he's occupying?\" Nonetheless, Ebert thought that Freeman's performance was commendable. \"Maybe actors should be given Oscars,\" he wrote, \"not for the good films they triumph in, but for the weak films they survive.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=April 6, 2001 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Along Came A Spider |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/along-came-a-spider-2001|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]] |location=Chicago, Illinois |via=RogerEbert.com |access-date=October 10, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nRobert Koehler of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt \"the very characteristics that have made Cross so appealing, particularly his mind-tickling abilities to assess and outmaneuver his criminal opponents, are reduced here to the most fundamental and predictable level ... As reliable as any actor in Hollywood, Freeman delivers the requisite gravitas, but the bland script curtails any personal touches he might have inserted were his sleuth character unraveling a truly vexing mystery.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Robert |last=Koehler |title=Along Came a Spider |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117797677 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |location=Los Angeles, California |access-date=September 20, 2020 |date=March 31, 2001 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, critic Harvey O'Brien weighed in with the sentiment that \"Unlike, for example, the overblown kidnap movie ''[[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'', ''Along Came a Spider'' plays down its sensational elements. It favours the procedural aspects of Cross' investigation which, though infected with the usual 'Eureka' factor of brilliant discoveries by the leading man at regular intervals just when it looked like he was stumped, are largely delivered with sincerity. Freeman has such a strong grip on this kind of determined, middle aged, everyman character by now that he can easily take the audience along for the ride. The film itself is otherwise sincere in general, with no real attempt at smarmy black humour or winks to the audience. It draws you in to a (relatively) realistic depiction of a tense situation in which people behave less like action heroes and more like human beings.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~obrienh/acas.htm|title=Along Came a Spider}}</ref>\n\n[[Compuserve]]'s Harvey Karten argued, \"Some critics will tell you that despite Lee Tamahori's overplotting of Marc Moss's adaptation of James Patterson's novel, ''Along Came a Spider'' is one of those thrillers that allow you to check your brains at the door. Not true. Did the journalists all go for popcorn when Detective Alex Cross and Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan (nice spelling) engaged first in a discussion of psychology and then of philosophy? This may have been Phil 101, but imagine the interest that must have been aroused in the audience with a product placement for university education. Says Cross in discussing what makes us choose our careers: 'You do what you are.' 'Not so,' replies Jezzie, every hair in place, not one gram of makeup disturbed, despite the excitement of the discussion... 'You are what you do.'\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/reviews/281/28175.html |title=Review for Along Came a Spider (2001) |website=[[IMDb]] |access-date=2022-06-10 |archive-date=2016-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310025103/http://www.imdb.com/reviews/281/28175.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n[[Jerry Goldsmith]] won the [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI Film & TV Award]] for his original score, and Morgan Freeman was nominated for the [[NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture]] but lost to [[Denzel Washington]] for ''[[Training Day]]''.\n\n==Series reboot==\n{{main|Alex Cross (film)}}\n   \nThere were no further sequels, but the character of Alex Cross was [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] with a 2012 film adaptation of the novel ''[[Cross (novel)|Cross]]'' under the title ''[[Alex Cross (film)|Alex Cross]]'' starring [[Tyler Perry]] in the titular role.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 2001]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.alongcameaspidermovie.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0164334|Along Came a Spider}}\n* {{Amg movie|209848|Along Came a Spider}}\n* {{mojo title|alongcameaspider|Along Came a Spider}}\n\n{{James Patterson}}\n{{Lee Tamahori}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Along Came a Spider (film)}}\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2001 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:2001 psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:American thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:American police detective films]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Secret Service]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on crime novels]]\n[[Category:Films about kidnapping]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lee Tamahori]]\n[[Category:Films produced by David Brown]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by James Patterson]]\n[[Category:Lindbergh kidnapping]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
