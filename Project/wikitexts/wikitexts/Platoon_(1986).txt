McGinley]], [[Forest Whitaker]], and [[Johnny Depp]]. It is the first film of a trilogy of [[Vietnam War]] films directed by Stone, followed by ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1989) and ''[[Heaven & Earth (1993 film)|Heaven & Earth]]'' (1993). The film, based on Stone's experience from the war, follows a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] volunteer (Sheen) serving in Vietnam while his Platoon Sergeant and his Squad Leader (Berenger and Dafoe) argue over the morality in the platoon and of the war itself.\n\nStone wrote the screenplay based upon his experiences as a U.S. [[infantryman]] in [[Vietnam]], to counter the vision of the war portrayed in [[John Wayne]]'s ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]''. Although having written films such as ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' and [[Scarface (1983 film)|''Scarface'']], Stone struggled to get the film developed until [[Hemdale Film Corporation]] acquired the project along with ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]''. Filming took place in the Philippines in February 1986 and lasted 54 days. ''Platoon'' was the first Hollywood film to be written and directed by a veteran of the Vietnam War.<ref name=\"DVDCommentary\">\n{{cite video\n   | people=Stone, Oliver\n   | date=2001\n   | title=Platoon DVD commentary\n   | medium=DVD\n   | publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]\n}}</ref>\n\nUpon its release, ''Platoon'' received critical acclaim for Stone's directing and screenplay, the cinematography, battle sequences' realism, and the performances of Sheen, Dafoe, and Berenger. The film was a box office success upon its release, grossing $138.5 million domestically against its $6 million budget. The film was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]] at the [[59th Academy Awards]], and won four including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Stone, [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\nIn 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] placed ''Platoon'' at #83 in their \"[[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]]\" poll. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Tartaglione|first=Nancy|title=National Film Registry Adds 'Purple Rain', 'Clerks', 'Gaslight' & More; 'Boys Don't Cry' One Of Record 7 Pics From Female Helmers|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/national-film-registry-2019-record-female-directors-boys-dont-cry-purple-rain-clerks-gaslight-platoon-full-list-1202806279/|magazine=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 11, 2019|access-date=December 11, 2019|archive-date=February 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225081156/https://deadline.com/2019/12/national-film-registry-2019-record-female-directors-boys-dont-cry-purple-rain-clerks-gaslight-platoon-full-list-1202806279/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-08|archive-date=2016-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Women Rule 2019 National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-19-116/women-rule-2019-national-film-registry/2019-12-11/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-08|archive-date=2021-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210322063545/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-19-116/women-rule-2019-national-film-registry/2019-12-11/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1967, U.S. Army volunteer Chris Taylor arrives in [[South Vietnam]] and is assigned to an infantry platoon of the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] near the [[Cambodia]]n border. Though the platoon is officially under the command of the young and inexperienced [[Second lieutenant|Lieutenant]] Wolfe, the soldiers instead defer to two of his older and more experienced subordinates: the cynical Staff Sergeant Barnes, and the more idealistic Sergeant Elias.\n\nTaylor is immediately deployed with Barnes, Elias and other experienced soldiers for a night ambush on a [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]] force. The NVA soldiers manage to get close to the sleeping Americans before a brief firefight ensues, which leads to Taylor becoming wounded and sent to the [[aid station]]. Upon his return, Taylor bonds with Elias and his circle of marijuana smokers while remaining distant from Barnes and his more hard-edged followers.\n\nDuring a subsequent patrol, three men are killed by [[booby trap#Military booby traps|booby traps]] and unseen assailants. Already on edge, the platoon is further angered when they discover an enemy supply cache in a nearby village. Barnes aggressively interrogates the village chief about whether the villagers have been aiding the NVA, and coldly shoots his wife dead when she snaps back at him. Elias then gets into a physical altercation with Barnes over the killing before Wolfe pacifies them and orders the supplies destroyed and the village razed. Taylor later prevents two girls from being gang-raped by some of Barnes' men.\n\nWhen the platoon returns to base, [[company commander]] Captain Harris declares that if he finds out that an illegal killing took place, a court-martial will ensue, leaving Barnes worried that Elias will testify against him. On their next patrol, the platoon is ambushed and pinned down in a firefight, and the situation is worsened when Wolfe accidentally directs an artillery strike [[Friendly fire|onto his own unit]] before Barnes calls it off. Elias takes Taylor and two others to intercept flanking enemy troops, while Barnes orders the rest of the platoon to retreat and goes back into the jungle to find Elias' group. Barnes finds Elias alone and shoots him, then tells the others that Elias was killed by the enemy. While the platoon is extracting via helicopter, they see a mortally wounded Elias emerge from the treeline being chased by NVA soldiers, who eventually kill him. Noting Barnes' anxious manner, Taylor realizes that he was responsible.\n\nBack at base, Taylor attempts to talk his group into [[fragging]] Barnes in retaliation when Barnes, having overheard them, enters the room and mocks them. Taylor then assaults Barnes but is quickly overpowered, and Barnes cuts Taylor near his eye with a [[push dagger]] before departing.\n\nThe platoon is sent back to the front line to maintain defensive positions, where Taylor shares a foxhole with another soldier named Francis. That night, a major NVA assault occurs, and the defensive lines are broken. Much of the platoon, including Wolfe and most of Barnes' followers, are killed in the ensuing battle, while an [[NLF and PAVN battle tactics#Sapper attacks|NVA sapper]] destroys the battalion headquarters in a suicide attack. Now in command, Captain Harris orders air support to expend all remaining ordnance inside the perimeter. In the chaos, Taylor encounters Barnes, who has been seriously wounded. Just as Barnes is about to kill Taylor, both men are knocked unconscious by an air strike.\n\nTaylor regains consciousness the following morning, picks up an enemy rifle, and finds Barnes, who orders Taylor to call a medic. Seeing that Taylor will not help, Barnes contemptuously tells Taylor to kill him, with which he complies. Francis, who survived the battle unharmed, deliberately stabs himself in the leg and reminds Taylor that because they have been twice wounded, they can return home, and a helicopter carries the two men away. Overwhelmed, Taylor breaks down sobbing as he glares down at multiple craters full of corpses.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Chris Taylor\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Sgt.

Stone's active duty service resulted in a \"big change\" in how he viewed life and the war. Although the screenplay ''Break'' was never produced, he later used it as the basis for ''Platoon''.<ref name=\"salewicz\"/> His screenplay featured several characters who were the seeds of those he developed in ''Platoon''. The script was set to music from [[The Doors]]; Stone sent the script to [[Jim Morrison]] in the hope he would play the lead. (Morrison never responded, but his manager returned the script to Stone shortly after Morrison's death; Morrison had the script with him when he died in Paris.) Although ''Break'' was never produced, Stone decided to attend film school.<ref name=\"salewicz\"/>\n\nAfter writing several other screenplays in the early 1970s, Stone worked with [[Robert Bolt]] on the screenplay, ''The Cover-up'' (it was not produced). Bolt's rigorous approach rubbed off on Stone. The younger man used his characters from the ''Break'' screenplay and developed a new screenplay, which he titled ''Platoon''. Producer [[Martin Bregman]] attempted to elicit studio interest in the project, but was not successful. Stone claims that during that time, [[Sidney Lumet]] was to have helmed the film with [[Al Pacino]] slated to star had there been studio interest.<ref name=chris>{{cite magazine|last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|title=Oliver Stone Platoon Charlie Sheen|date=24 May 2011|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=https://ew.com/article/2011/05/24/oliver-stone-talks-platoon-and-charlie-sheen-on-the-vietnam-films-25th-anniversary-exclusive/|access-date=29 July 2019|archive-date=29 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729210846/https://ew.com/article/2011/05/24/oliver-stone-talks-platoon-and-charlie-sheen-on-the-vietnam-films-25th-anniversary-exclusive/|url-status=live}}</ref>  But, based on the strength of his writing in ''Platoon,'' Stone was hired to write the screenplay for ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' (1978).\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, as were some other Stone films at the time, but most studios were still reluctant to finance ''Platoon,'' because it was about the unpopular Vietnam War. After the release of ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', the studios then cited the perception that these films were considered the pinnacle of the Vietnam War film genre as reasons not to make ''Platoon''.<ref name=\"salewicz\"/>\n\nStone responded by attempting to break into mainstream direction via the easier-to-finance horror genre, but ''[[The Hand (1981 film)|The Hand]]'' failed at the box office, and he began to think ''Platoon'' would never be made. Instead, he cowrote ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]'' for a lower-than-usual fee of $200,000, on the condition from producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] would next produce ''Platoon.'' ''Year of the Dragon'' was directed by Stone's friend [[Michael Cimino]], who had also helmed ''The Deer Hunter.''  According to Stone, Cimino attempted to produce ''Platoon'' in 1984.<ref name=chris/>\n\nDe Laurentiis secured financing for ''Platoon,'' but he struggled to find a distributor. Because De Laurentiis had already spent money sending Stone to the Philippines to scout for locations, he decided to keep control of the film's script until he was repaid.<ref name=\"salewicz\"/> Then Stone's script for what would become ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'' was passed to [[John Daly (producer)|John Daly]] of British production company [[Hemdale Film Corporation|Hemdale]]. Once again, this was a project that Stone had struggled to secure financing for, but Daly loved the script and was prepared to finance both ''Salvador'' and ''Platoon.''  Stone shot ''Salvador'' first, before turning his attention to ''Platoon''.<ref name=\"salewicz\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[James Woods]], who had starred in Stone's film ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'', was offered a part in ''Platoon.'' Despite his friendship with the director, he turned it down, later teasingly saying he \"couldn't face going into another jungle with [Oliver Stone]\".
