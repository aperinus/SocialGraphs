It was filmed in late August and early September 2005, and premiered at the [[New Orleans Arena]] on August 16, 2006 and was first aired on [[HBO]] the following week. The [[television]] premiere aired in two parts on August 21 and 22, 2006 on [[HBO]]. It has been described by Sheila Nevins, chief of HBO's documentary unit, as \"one of the most important films HBO has ever made.\"<ref>{{citation| url=http://xixax.com/index.php?topic=9135.0 | work=XIXAX.com | title=When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts | date=July 13, 2006 }}</ref>  The title is a reference to the [[blues]] tune \"[[When the Levee Breaks]]\" by [[Kansas Joe McCoy]] and [[Memphis Minnie]] about the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]].\n\nThe documentary was screened at the [[63rd Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31 and September 1, 2006. It won the Orizzonti Documentary Prize and one of two [[FIPRESCI]] awards. It was also shown at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 15 and September 16, 2006. It won three awards at the [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards]] and received a [[Peabody Award]].<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/when-the-levees-broke-a-requiem-in-four-acts 66th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2007.</ref>\n\nThe documentary is based on news video footage and still photos of Katrina and its aftermath, interspersed with interviews. Interviewees include politicians, journalists, historians, engineers, and many residents of various parts of New Orleans and the surrounding areas, who give first hand accounts of their experiences with the levee failures and the aftermath.\n\nIn the style of [[Michael Apted]]'s ''[[Up series]]'' (a documentary series that interviews Apted's subjects every seven years), Lee planned to interview his featured subjects in ''Levees'' at least once more.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/arts/television/03leve.html | work=The New York Times | first=Felicia R. | last=Lee | title=Agony of New Orleans, Through Spike Lee's Eyes | date=August 3, 2006}}</ref>  In August 2010, HBO aired Lee's documentary series, ''[[If God Is Willing and Da Creek Don't Rise]]'', which chronicles how New Orleans and the Gulf Coast area have fared in the five years following Hurricane Katrina.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film focuses on the changed lives of New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina hit. The film shows residents in the midst of disaster dealing with death, devastation and disease. Spike Lee said about the film:\n\n<blockquote>New Orleans is fighting for its life. These are not people who will disappear quietly&nbsp;\u2014 they're accustomed to hardship and slights, and they'll fight for New Orleans. This film will showcase the struggle for New Orleans by focusing on the profound loss, as well as the indomitable spirit of New Orleaneans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/whentheleveesbroke/synopsis.html |title=Documentaries: Home |publisher=HBO |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis documentary is Spike Lee's third, preceded by ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997), about the Birmingham church bombing of 1963; and ''[[Jim Brown: All-American]]'' (2002), about the football player.\n\nShooting for the film began three months after Hurricane Katrina hit, when Lee and his camera crew took the first of eight trips to New Orleans. They conducted interviews and taped footage for the film. Lee hoped to hear varying opinions of the storm and responses to the storm's destruction. He interviewed nearly 100&nbsp;people of diverse backgrounds and opinions for his film.\n\n==Interviewees==\nPeople appearing in interviews include:{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Glen David Andrews]], musician\n* [[John M.

At the end of the last episode is a similar montage with [[Fats Domino]]'s \"[[Walking to New Orleans]]\" on the soundtrack.\n\nThe film's original score is by [[Terence Blanchard]], a New Orleans-born trumpeter who appears in the film, with his mother and aunt, as they return to their flooded home. Not being the first time that Terence Blanchard had worked as a composer for a film by Spike Lee, Blanchard had worked to create compositions of a more universal genre of jazz as opposed to New Orleans style jazz in order to reach masses of audiences to raise awareness of the results of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. In general, the music he had composed was written under the context of respecting those who were directly affected by the catastrophe and with intentions of providing contexts to allow audiences to sympathize with those affected.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maloney|first1=Ann|title=The pain of Katrina will spill forth when trumpeter Terence Blanchard performs with the LPO on Saturday|url=http://blog.nola.com/living/2007/11/terence_blanchard_with_lpo_per.html|website=The Times-Picayune|access-date=15 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n''When the Levees Broke'' won three Emmy Awards:  Exceptional Merit in Nonfiction Filmmaking, Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming, and Outstanding Picture Editing for Nonfiction Programming.\n\nIt received a 2006 [[Peabody Award]] from the University of Georgia for being an \"epic document of destruction and broken promises and a profound work of art\" and \"an uncompromising analysis of the events that precede and follow Hurricane Katrina's assault on New Orleans\" that \"tells the story with an unparalleled diversity of voices and sources.\"<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/details.php?id=1449 | title= When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts | year=2006 | publisher=[[Henry W.

At the [[63rd Venice International Film Festival]] the film was awarded the Horizons award in the documentary category. The film was also selected as part of the 2008 [[Whitney Biennial]].\n\n==Points made by the film==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2011}}\nThe film focuses on the suffering of those affected by the disaster and their will to survive. Additionally, it suggests that the disaster in New Orleans was preventable, caused by levees poorly designed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], and the suffering afterward was compounded by failures at all levels of government, most severely at the State level. These points are in line with mainstream investigations, including the bipartisan U.S. Congressional report, ''A Failure of Initiative'', and the Army Corps of Engineers' own studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4707536.stm |title=Americas &#124; US government 'failed' on Katrina |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-02-13 |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/11/AR2006021101409.html |title=Katrina Report Spreads Blame |work=Washingtonpost.com |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://katrina.house.gov/ |title=The Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina |publisher=Katrina.house.gov |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Levin |first=Alan |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-06-01-levees_x.htm |title=Corps: Levees' design caused deadly failure |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-06-01 |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/3494775.html |title=Report finds obvious design flaws doomed levees - Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=2005-12-01 |access-date=2014-07-13}}</ref><ref>[http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/ipetfinal.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209005014/http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/ipetfinal.htm |date=December 9, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans]]\n* [[Criticism of the government response to Hurricane Katrina]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/whentheleveesbroke/|''When the Levees Broke''}}, Official website, HBO\n* {{Amg movie|345875|When the Levees Broke}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0783612|title=When the Levees Broke}}\n\n{{Spike Lee}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''When the Levees Broke''\n|list =\n{{EmmyAward Documentary Filmmaking}}\n{{NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special}}\n}}\n{{HBO documentaries}}\n\n[[Category:Films directed by Spike Lee]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about Hurricane Katrina]]\n[[Category:40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:2000s American television miniseries]]\n[[Category:2006 television films]]\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:HBO documentary films]]\n[[Category:History of New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Peabody Award-winning broadcasts]]\n[[Category:Films set in Louisiana]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Terence Blanchard]]\n[[Category:Primetime Emmy Award-winning broadcasts]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
