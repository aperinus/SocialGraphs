The story concerns class relationships among a small group of French officers who are prisoners of war during [[World War I]] and are plotting an escape. The title of the film comes from the 1909 book ''[[The Great Illusion]]'' by British journalist [[Norman Angell]], which argued that war is futile because of the common economic interests of all European nations. The perspective of the film is generously humanistic to its characters of various nationalities.\n\n''La Grande Illusion'' is regarded by critics and film historians as one of the masterpieces of [[Cinema of France|French cinema]]<ref name=\"criterion\" /> and among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. [[Orson Welles]] named ''La Grande Illusion'' as one of the two movies he would take with him \"on the ark.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjfa1GFwmUA#t=4m10s Welles cites ''La Grande Illusion'' but doesn't name the second film - he just says \"something else\" (4m 35s).\"] ''[[YouTube]]'', 15 September 2007.

They are shot down by German [[flying ace]] and [[German nobility|aristocrat]], ''[[Rittmeister]]'' von Rauffenstein, and both are taken prisoner by the [[Imperial German Army]]. Upon returning to the [[aerodrome]], von Rauffenstein sends a subordinate to find out if the aviators are officers and, if so, to invite them to lunch. During the meal, Rauffenstein and Bo\u00ebldieu discover they have mutual acquaintances\u2014a depiction of the familiarity, if not solidarity, within the upper classes that crosses national boundaries.\n\nBo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal are then taken to a [[prisoner-of-war camp]], where they meet a colorful group of French prisoners and stage a [[vaudeville]]-type performance just after the Germans have taken [[Fort Douaumont]] in the epic [[Battle of Verdun]]. During the performance, word arrives that the French have recaptured the fort. Mar\u00e9chal interrupts the show, and the French prisoners spontaneously burst into \"[[La Marseillaise]]\". As a result of the disruption, Mar\u00e9chal is placed in solitary confinement, where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger; the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned.  Bo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal also help their fellow prisoners to finish digging an escape tunnel. However, just before it is completed, everyone is transferred to other camps. Because of the language barrier, Mar\u00e9chal is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming British prisoner.\n\nBo\u00ebldieu and Mar\u00e9chal are moved from camp to camp, finally arriving in Wintersborn, a mountain fortress prison commanded by Rauffenstein, who has been so badly injured in battle that he has been given a posting away from the front, much to his regret. Rauffenstein tells them that Wintersborn is escape-proof.\n\nAt Wintersborn, the pair are reunited with a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal, from the original camp. Rosenthal is a wealthy French [[Judaism|Jew]], a naturalized French citizen who generously shares the food parcels he receives.  Bo\u00ebldieu comes up with an idea, after carefully observing how the German guards respond to an emergency. He volunteers to distract the guards for the few minutes needed for Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal to escape. After a commotion staged by the prisoners, the guards are ordered to assemble them in the fortress courtyard. During the roll call, it is discovered that Bo\u00ebldieu is missing. He makes his presence known high up in the fortress, drawing the German guards away in pursuit. Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal take the opportunity to lower themselves from a window by a homemade rope and flee.\n\nRauffenstein stops the guards from firing at Bo\u00ebldieu and pleads with his friend to give himself up.  Bo\u00ebldieu refuses, and Rauffenstein reluctantly shoots him with his pistol, aiming for his legs but fatally hitting him in the stomach. Nursed in his final moments by a grieving Rauffenstein, Bo\u00ebldieu laments that the whole purpose of the nobility and their usefulness to both [[French culture|French]] and [[German culture]] is being destroyed by the war. He expresses pity for von Rauffenstein, who will have to find a new purpose in the postwar world.\n\nMar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal journey across the German countryside, trying to reach neutral Switzerland. Rosenthal injures his foot, slowing Mar\u00e9chal down. They quarrel and part, but then Mar\u00e9chal returns to help his comrade. They take refuge in the modest farmhouse of a German woman, Elsa, who lost her husband at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], along with three brothers, at battles which, with quiet irony, she describes as \"our greatest victories.\" She takes them in and does not betray them to a passing army patrol. She and Mar\u00e9chal fall in love, despite not speaking each other's language, but he and Rosenthal eventually leave from a sense of duty after Rosenthal recovers from his injury. Mar\u00e9chal declares he will come back to Elsa and her young daughter, Lotte, if he survives the war.\n\nA German patrol sights the two fugitives crossing a snow-covered valley. They fire a few rounds, but then their commanding officer orders them to stop, saying the pair have crossed into Switzerland.\n[[File:Haut-koenigsbourg 02.jpg|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau du Haut-K\u0153nigsbourg]], which appears in the film.]]\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jean Gabin]] as Lieutenant Mar\u00e9chal, a French officer, of modest social background\n* [[Marcel Dalio]] as Lieutenant Rosenthal, a French officer, of [[nouveau riche]] [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish ancestry\n* [[Pierre Fresnay]] as Captain de Bo\u00ebldieu, a French [[flying ace]] and member of the [[French nobility]]\n* [[Erich von Stroheim]] as Captain (later Major) von Rauffenstein, a German [[flying ace]] and member of the [[German nobility]]\n* [[Dita Parlo]] as Elsa, a German farmwife and war widow\n* [[Julien Carette]] as Cartier, the vaudeville performer\n* [[Gaston Modot]] as an engineer\n* [[Georges P\u00e9clet]] as an officer\n* Werner Florian as Sgt.

Other exteriors were filmed at the artillery barracks at [[Colmar]] (built by [[Wilhelm II]]) and at [[Neuf-Brisach]] on the [[Upper Rhine]].\n\nAn early script version of ''La Grande Illusion'' had Rosenthal and Mar\u00e9chal agreeing to meet in a restaurant at the end of the war. In the final scene, everyone there would be celebrating the armistice, but instead of these men, there would be two empty chairs at a table.{{#tag:ref|Renoir was a French aviator during the First World War, and Gabin wears Renoir's uniform in the film.<ref>Durgnat 1974, pp. 27\u201328.</ref>|group=Note}}\n\n==Political and historical themes==\nRenoir used the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914\u20131918) as a lens through which to examine Europe as it faced the rising spectre of [[fascism]] (especially in [[Nazi Germany]]) and the impending approach of the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939\u20131945).<ref>Nixon, Rob and Felicia Feaster.

I am confident that such a question is so important today that if we don\u2019t solve it, we will just have to say \u2018goodbye\u2019 to our beautiful world.\" Despite widespread interest in the subject, Renoir found it difficult to find a producer and distributor, having to \"shop around\" the project for years.<ref>Feaster, Felicia.

Retrieved: 20 March 2017.</ref>\n\n===Class===\n''La Grande Illusion'' examines the relationships between different social classes in Europe. Two of the main characters, Bo\u00ebldieu and Rauffenstein, are [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s. They are represented as [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] men, educated in many cultures and conversant in several languages. Their level of education and their devotion to social conventions and rituals makes them feel closer to each other than to the lower class of their own nation. They share similar social experiences: dining at [[Maxim's Paris|Maxim's]] in Paris, courting dalliances with the same woman, and even know of each other through acquaintances. They converse with each other in heavily formal [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], and in moments of intimate personal conversation, escape into [[English language|English]] as if to hide these comments from their lower class counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.7282/T3CV4G3S|year=1988|last1=Triggs|first1=Jeffery Alan|title=The Legacy of Babel: Language in Jean Renoir's ''Grand Illusion''|journal=New Orleans Review|volume=15|issue=2|pages=70\u201374}}</ref>\n\nRenoir depicts the rule of the aristocracy in ''La Grande Illusion'' as in decline, to be replaced by a new, emerging social order, led by men who were not born to privilege. He emphasizes that their class is no longer an essential component to their respective nation's politics.<ref name=\"Pendo p. 107\" /> Both Rauffenstein and Bo\u00ebldieu view their military service as a duty, and see the war as having a purpose; as such, Renoir depicts them as laudable but tragic figures whose world is disappearing and who are trapped in a code of life that is rapidly becoming meaningless.<ref>Paris 1995, p. 50.</ref> Both are aware that their time is past, but their reaction to this reality diverges: Bo\u00ebldieu accepts the fate of the aristocracy as a positive improvement, but Rauffenstein does not, lamenting what he sarcastically calls the \"charming legacy of the French Revolution\".\n\nIn ''La Grande Illusion'', Renoir contrasts the aristocrats with characters such as Mar\u00e9chal (Gabin), a mechanic from [[Paris]]. The lower class characters have little in common with each other; they have different interests and are not worldly in their views or education. Nonetheless, they have a kinship too, through common sentiment and experience.<ref name=\"Pop 101\">Nixon, Rob. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/76799/Grand-Illusion/articles.html \"Pop culture 101: 'Grand Illusion' (1937).\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''. Retrieved: 20 March 2017.</ref>\n\nRenoir's message is made clear when the aristocratic Bo\u00ebldieu sacrifices himself by distracting the prison guards by dancing around, singing, and playing a flute, to allow Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal, members of the lower class, to escape. Reluctantly and strictly out of duty, Rauffenstein is forced to shoot Bo\u00ebldieu, an act that Bo\u00ebldieu admits he would have been compelled to do were the circumstances reversed. However, in accepting his inevitable death, Bo\u00ebldieu takes comfort in the idea that \"For a commoner, dying in a war is a tragedy. But for you and me, it's a good way out\", and states that he has pity for Rauffenstein who will struggle to find a purpose in the new social order of the world where his traditions, experiences, and background are obsolete.\n\nThe critique of the romantic idealization of duty in ''La Grande Illusion'' is comparable to that in the earlier film ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1930), based on the novel by [[Erich Maria Remarque]].\n\n===Prejudice===\nIn ''La Grande Illusion'', Renoir briefly touches on the question of [[antisemitism]] through the character of Rosenthal, a son from a ''[[nouveau riche]]'' Jewish banking family (a parallel to the [[Rothschild banking family of France]]). His biographers believed that Renoir created this character to counter the rising anti-Jewish campaign enacted by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s government in [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=\"Pop 101\" /> Further, Rosenthal is shown as a symbol of humanity across class lines: though he may be financially wealthy, he shares his food parcels with everyone so that he and his fellow prisoners are well fed \u2014 when compared with their German captors. Through the character of Rosenthal, Renoir rebuffs Jewish stereotypes.\n\nThere is also a black French officer among the prisoners at Wintersborn who appears to be ignored by the other prisoners, and not accepted as an equal by them. When he speaks to them he is not responded to. For instance, when he shows his artwork, he is shrugged off.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1386/fiin.4.4.43|title=Insurmountable in their wake: Paradox and ideology in Cavell's title reading of ''La Grande Illusion''|journal=Film International|volume=4|issue=4|pages=43\u201345|year=2006|last1=Bird|first1=Morgan}}</ref>\n\n===War===\nIn ''La Grande Illusion'' Renoir seeks to refute the notion that war accomplishes anything, or that it can be used as a political tool to solve problems and create a better world. \"That's all an illusion\", says Rosenthal, speaking of the belief that this is the war that will end war forever.\n\n''La Grande Illusion'' is a [[war film]] without any depiction of battle. Instead, the [[prisoner of war|prisoner of war camp]] setting is used as a space in which soldiers of many nations have a common experience. Renoir portrays [[war]] as a futile exercise. For instance, Elsa, the German widow, shows photos to Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal of her husband and her brothers who were killed, respectively, at the battles of [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], [[Battle of Li\u00e8ge|Li\u00e8ge]], [[Battle of Charleroi|Charleroi]], and [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]]. The last three of these battles were amongst Germany's most celebrated victories in [[World War I]]. Through this device, Renoir refutes the notion that one common man's bravery, honor, or duty can make an impact on a great event. This undermines the idealistic intention of Mar\u00e9chal and Rosenthal to return to the front, so that by returning to the fight they can help end this war.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe score was written by the Hungarian composer [[Joseph Kosma]], who also wrote the famous song \"[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]].\" The soundtrack also includes many well-known songs of the day from French, English, and German cultures. The uncredited musical director was the film and music critic [[\u00c9mile Vuillermoz]], who had been a composer in his early career.\n\nSongs:\n* \"Frou-Frou\" (1897) lyrics written by Montr\u00e9al and Blondeau, music by Henri Chatau, performed by Lucile Panis.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110809051500/http://www.chanson.udenap.org/50_chansons/08_frou_frou.htm \"Song: 'Frou-Frou'.\"] ''Webarchive'', 9 August 2011.

The digging of the escape tunnel in ''The Great Escape'' and the singing of the \"Marseillaise\" to enrage the Germans in ''Casablanca'' can first be observed in Renoir's 1937 masterpiece. Even the details of the tunnel dig are the same\u2014the way the prisoners hide the excavated dirt in their pants and shake it out on the parade ground during exercise. But if ''Grand Illusion'' had been merely a source of later inspiration, it wouldn't be on so many lists of great films. It's not a movie about a prison escape, nor is it jingoistic in its politics; it's a meditation on the collapse of the old order of European civilization. Perhaps that was always a sentimental upper-class illusion, the notion that gentlemen on both sides of the lines subscribed to the same code of behaviour.

Prints of the film were rediscovered in 1958 and restored and re-released during the early 1960s. Then, it was revealed that the original negative had been shipped back to Berlin (probably due to the efforts of Frank Hensel) to be stored in the [[Reichsfilmarchiv]] vaults. In the Allied occupation of Berlin in 1945, the Reichsfilmarchiv by chance was in the Russian zone and consequently shipped along with many other films back to be the basis of the Soviet [[Gosfilmofond]] film archive in [[Moscow]]. The negative was returned to France in the 1960s, but sat unidentified in storage in [[Toulouse]] [[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise|Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que]] for over 30 years, as no one suspected it had survived. It was rediscovered in the early 1990s as the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que's nitrate collection was slowly being transferred to the French Film Archives at Bois d'Arcy.<ref name=\"criterion\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=\" La Grande illusion \", ou la red\u00e9couverte d\u2019un film disparu|url=https://www.cnc.fr/cinema/actualites/la-grande-illusion-ou-la-redecouverte-dun-film-disparu_1032884|website=CNC|language=fr|access-date=2022-05-19}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1999, [[Rialto Pictures]] re-released the film in the United States, based on the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que negative found in Toulouse;<ref name=\"ebert\" /> after watching the new print at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, [[Janet Maslin]] called it \"beautifully refurbished\" and \"especially lucid.\"<ref name=\"maslin\">Maslin, Janet.
