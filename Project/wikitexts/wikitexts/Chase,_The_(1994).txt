Set in [[California]], the film follows a wrongfully convicted man who kidnaps a wealthy heiress and leads police on a lengthy [[car chase]] in an attempt to escape prison, while the news media dramatize the chase to absurd extents. It features [[Henry Rollins]], [[Josh Mostel]], and [[Ray Wise]] in supporting roles, with [[cameo appearance]]s by [[Anthony Kiedis]] and [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] of the rock band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\n''The Chase'' was conceived as a direct response to Rifkin's 1991 comedy ''[[The Dark Backward]]'', which performed extremely poorly at the box office. The film was shot in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] and its soundtrack features [[alternative rock|alternative]] artists such as [[Bad Religion]], [[NOFX]], and [[Rollins Band]]. Although the film received mixed reviews from critics, it was considered a commercial success. Journalists generally criticized its forced script and subpar characters, but praised the film's use of [[satire]] to criticize the television news industry. According to Rollins, the film has attracted a [[cult following]].\n\n==Plot==\nConvict Jack Hammond stops at a gas station in [[Newport Beach, California]], where he encounters two police officers and a young woman. When the officers receive a car radio call that indicates the car Jack is driving is stolen, he panics and kidnaps the woman. Fleeing in her car, Jack learns that his hostage is Natalie Voss, daughter of a millionaire industrialist. Two police officers pursue them in a squad car with a television crew filming a [[reality television|reality show]]. The car chase moves onto southbound [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] as Jack decides to flee to Mexico. As the chase intensifies, two bystanders attempt to run Jack off the road in their [[monster truck]], but lose control and roll the truck onto its side, where it is hit by a [[semi-trailer truck]] and explodes. The bystanders manage to escape, but are arrested by police during a live T.V. interview explaining why they felt inspired to get involved.\n\nThe news media dramatize the car chase, going to such lengths as having a reporter hang out of the side of a van alongside the speeding car. Jack explains to Natalie that, while working as a [[clown]] performing at children's birthday parties in [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], he was mistaken for the \"red-nosed robber\", a criminal who had robbed several banks while wearing a clown costume. A blood test sample improperly collected at one of the crime scenes proved Jack's innocence but its inadmissibility led to his conviction and sentence to 25 years' incarceration. During transfer to prison, he escaped the guards and stole a car, leading to their present situation. Jack's lawyer explains Jack's predicament to the media and tries to convince him to surrender to the police, but Jack believes escape is his only option.\n\nNatalie sympathizes with Jack. She shares with him her hate for her stepmother and that she seeks to escape from her dysfunctional family. As the chase continues, she begins to fall in love with Jack; the two have sex while he drives, and she suggests feigning being his hostage so that they can flee together to Mexico. They reach the [[San Ysidro Port of Entry]] and find it heavily blockaded. Jack continues to evade the police but eventually stops, telling Natalie that her life cannot be ruined by him. He releases her reluctantly to her father. After considering going out in a blaze of glory, Jack decides to surrender. As he is being arrested, Natalie takes a television producer hostage at gunpoint and demands Jack's release. The two steal a news helicopter and escape to Mexico, where they relax on a beach.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Jack Hammond, the film's protagonist\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as Natalie Voss, Jack's hostage\n* [[Henry Rollins]] as Officer Dobbs, driver of the lead police car\n* [[Josh Mostel]] as Officer Figus, Dobbs' partner\n* [[Ray Wise]] as Dalton Voss, Natalie's father\n* [[Rocky Carroll]] as traffic reporter Byron Wilder\n* [[Bree Walker]] as news anchor Wendy Sorenson\n* [[Marshall Bell]] as Ari Josephson, Jack's attorney\n* [[Claudia Christian]] as Yvonne Voss, Natalie's stepmother\n* [[Natalia Nogulich]] as Frances Voss, Natalie's mother\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as news anchor Steve Horsegroovy\n* [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] as Dale, driver of the monster truck\n* [[Anthony Kiedis]] as Will, Dale's friend and passenger\n* [[Cassian Elwes]] as the producer of the police reality show\n* [[Ron Jeremy]] as a cameraman\n* [[Marco Perella]] as a police officer\n* [[John S.

According to him, \"I needed to make something that studio executives could watch and see money-making potential from. So, I wrote and directed, purposely, a really brightly lit, simplistic car crash movie that I wanted to be the polar opposite of ''The Dark Backward''.\"<ref name=\"Threat interview 2\"/> Although the film was released by [[20th Century Fox]], it was made with a relatively small budget of \"a few million dollars\".<ref name=\"Threat interview 3\"/> As a result, Rifkin considers it an independent film rather than a studio film.<ref name=\"Threat interview 3\"/>\n\nAlthough the film is set in [[California]], it was actually shot in the [[Houston]] metropolitan area, [[Texas]].<ref name=\"Houston area\"/> Rifkin explained that shutting down a freeway in [[Los Angeles]] for a long period of time would have been too expensive.<ref name=\"Rifkin celebrates\"/> The opening scene, where Jack kidnaps Natalie, was filmed at a convenience store in [[Kemah, Texas|Kemah]], while most of the chase scenes were shot on a section of the [[Hardy Toll Road]].<ref name=\"Rollins talks\"/> Other film locations include the [[Mecom Fountain]] and the [[Houston Police Department]] headquarters at 61 Riesner.<ref name=\"Rollins talks\"/> To reduce costs, part of the car chase was filmed in the middle of a traffic stream during an actual Houston [[rush hour]] without clearance and with no [[stunt]] drivers filling in for actors [[Charlie Sheen]] and [[Henry Rollins]].<ref name=\"Rollins talks\"/> During the film's production, Sheen was also training for his role in ''[[Major League II]]''.<ref name=\"Rollins talks\"/>\n\nRollins, a former vocalist of the [[punk rock]] band [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], was cast as an attention-seeking cop due to his muscled physique. The role proved to be exciting for Rollins, who used to sing about police brutality.<ref name=\"Rollins talks\"/> Musicians [[Anthony Kiedis]] and [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] of the rock band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] had [[Cameo appearance|cameo roles]] in the film. Flea commented positively on his experience in creating their characters. According to him, \"We were making up lines the whole time. I remember we said something about [[Geraldo Rivera]] and we called him Jeraldo. We thought that was so funny.\"<ref name=\"Flea memories\"/> Pornographic actor [[Ron Jeremy]] also had a cameo appearance as a cameraman.<ref name=\"Jeremy cameo\"/> The film's soundtrack features alternative artists such as [[Bad Religion]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[The Offspring]], [[Down by Law (band)|Down by Law]], [[NOFX]], [[Rollins Band]], [[Suede (band)|Suede]], and [[One Dove]].<ref name=\"Variety soundtrack\"/> A soundtrack album by [[Epitaph Records]] was originally intended to be released in March 1994.<ref name=\"Variety soundtrack\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''The Chase'' performed well when it opened on March 4, 1994, in 1,633 theaters,<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\"/> finishing fifth and grossing $3.4 million at the US weekend box office, behind ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', ''[[Greedy (film)|Greedy]]'', ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', and ''[[Sugar Hill (1994 film)|Sugar Hill]]''.<ref name=\"1st weekend\"/> During its second weekend, the film grossed an estimated $1.7 million, finishing in 13th place.<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\"/> Overall, ''The Chase'' went on to make $7.9 million in the US.<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\"/> Considering its limited budget, Rifkin felt the film was a commercial success, stating that it made \"a huge profit\" for 20th Century Fox.<ref name=\"Threat interview 3\"/> ''The Chase'' was released on [[VHS]] in the United States by [[Fox Video]] on August 3, 1994,<ref name=\"VHS release\"/> and on [[DVD]] on September 6, 2005.<ref name=\"DVD release\"/> The DVD's only supplemental material is the film's original theatrical trailer.<ref name=\"DVD release\"/>\n\n===Critical reception===\nAccording to review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Chase'' has a 40% approval rating based on 20 reviews.<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\"/> Although the film was generally criticized for its forced script and subpar characters,<ref name=\"EW review\"/><ref name=\"TWP review\"/> several critics praised the film's use of [[satire]] to criticize the television news industry.<ref name=\"NYT review\"/><ref name=\"TAC review\"/><ref name=\"Variety review\"/><ref name=\"Ebert review\"/><ref name=\"Berardinelli review\"/> The film also criticizes millionaire businessmen like the character of Dalton Voss, who uses the kidnapping of his daughter as a political advantage while he runs for the government of California.<ref name=\"media in movies\"/> ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]], who gave the film two-and-a-half out of three stars, felt that ''The Chase'' was \"slick, charming, and with moments of real wit\".<ref name=\"Ebert review\"/> He also praised Swanson's \"unaffected charm and Sheen's ability to play an almost impossible role in a fairly straight style\".<ref name=\"Ebert review\"/> Film critic [[James Berardinelli]] agreed, stating that Sheen develops \"a surprisingly effective chemistry\" with Swanson, and noted that Rifkin's use of satire is \"far more perceptive than one might expect from a piece of cartoon fluff like this\".<ref name=\"Berardinelli review\"/>\n\nWriting for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', editor John Petrakis noted the film's numerous gags and political and socio-economic commentary, stating that they parody films such as ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'', but said that its simplistic premise does not allow for an effective love story.<ref name=\"CT review\"/> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', while criticizing the film's superficial characters, remarked that ''The Chase'' \"still detonates laughs\".<ref name=\"NYT review\"/> Although Swanson's performance was highlighted,<ref name=\"Variety review\"/><ref name=\"Ebert review\"/> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' writer Brian Lowry felt that the \"whining [[Valley girl]] aspects of her role\" does not contribute to her [[characterization]].<ref name=\"Variety review\"/> He also described Sheen's performance as the same \"[[Jack Nicholson]]-wannabe pose he's employed with varying degrees of success\" in films such as ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'' and ''[[Navy SEALs (film)|Navy SEALs]]''.<ref name=\"Variety review\"/> Marc Savlov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' agreed, but noted that Sheen's \"familial transparency serves him well\" in the film. He concluded that, while ''The Chase'' is \"nobody's idea of excellence in cinema\", \"Rifkin's skewed world view suits this rollicking, stupid slab of celluloid just fine. It's big, it's dumb, it's fun.\"<ref name=\"TAC review\"/> In December 1994, ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'' included the film in its list of the worst films of the year.<ref name=\"Top 18 worst\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nRetrospectively, ''The Chase'' was considered ahead of its time because it was released before [[O. J. Simpson]]'s infamous [[White Bronco]] chase in June 1994.<ref name=\"That Shelf retro\"/> The film was highlighted for \"taking a look at the growing infatuation that the media had with tabloid journalism, and specifically the need for TV news crews to capture and speculate upon every minor freeway chase that happened in California.\"<ref name=\"That Shelf retro\"/> The film was released at a time when [[road movie]]s were considered appealing, hence the film's tagline reads: \"Getting there is twice the fun.\"<ref name=\"what a trip\"/> In 2015, Rollins stated that ''The Chase'' had attracted a [[cult following]] and that he had always received mail about it when the film airs on TV.<ref name=\"Rollins talks\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=afi>{{Cite web
