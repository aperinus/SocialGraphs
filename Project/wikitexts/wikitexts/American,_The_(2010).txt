The film was released on September 1, 2010. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $67&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nJack, a gunsmith and contract killer, and his lover, Ingrid, are relaxing in Sweden. As they walk in the wilderness outside their cabin, Jack becomes alarmed by a trail of footprints in the snow and pulls Ingrid towards shelter. Sniper gunshots ring out. Ingrid sees Jack pull a gun from his pocket and shoot the sniper. Knowing his identity is in jeopardy, and with little hesitation, Jack kills Ingrid before locating and killing another armed man. He flees to Rome and contacts his handler, Pavel, who insists that Jack cannot stay in Rome. Pavel sends him to [[Castelvecchio Calvisio|Castelvecchio]], a small town in the mountains of [[Abruzzo]]. Jack becomes nervous, and disposing of the cell phone Pavel gave him, goes to nearby [[Castel del Monte, Abruzzo|Castel del Monte]] instead\u2014where he uses the name Edward.\n\nWhile in Abruzzo, Jack contacts Pavel, who sets him up with another job. He meets Mathilde, an assassin who wants him to build her a custom sniper rifle. He also begins patronizing a prostitute, Clara, and they begin a relationship. Jack borrows tools from the priest's friend and builds a silencer. Jack continues to notice he's being followed by a man. He meets with Mathilde to test the weapon. She is impressed by the craftsmanship but asks him to make a few more adjustments. Later, Jack kills the man following him; an assassin from Sweden.\n\nJack is tormented by dreams of the events in Sweden and regrets killing Ingrid. His friendship and conversations with a local priest, Father Benedetto, encourage him to question his life choices. Both Mathilde and Clara notice Jack's association with butterflies, Mathilde by his expertise in endangered butterflies, and Clara by his prominent tattoo. When Father Benedetto tells Jack he senses he lives in a special kind of hell, \"a place without love\", Jack starts to let himself feel love for Clara and envisions a life with her.\n\nJack talks to Pavel, asking how the Swedes have found him. In his growing fear, he even suspects Clara when he discovers a small pistol in her purse. He questions Clara about the gun and is satisfied with her explanation (to defend herself, since newspapers have reported murdered prostitutes).\n\nJack agrees to deliver the weapon to Mathilde as his last job, but at the last moment, he re-opens the briefcase. At the drop-off, Jack becomes suspicious that Mathilde plans to kill him. Before anything can happen, a bus load of school children arrives. Mathilde gives Jack his payment\u2014a thick envelope full of cash\u2014and the two separate. As Mathilde drives away, Pavel contacts her and asks if she has killed Jack. She tells him she has not, but says she is following him and will kill him.\n\nClara meets Jack at a religious procession in town. Jack asks her to go away with him and she agrees. Mathilde tries to shoot Jack from a nearby rooftop but the rifle backfires in her face, confirming Jack's suspicion and his last-minute decision to sabotage the rifle. Seeing Mathilde fall from the roof, Jack gives Clara the envelope full of cash and tells her to go to a river where they had picnicked before and wait for him. He runs to Mathilde, who is dying on the pavement, and discovers that she also works for Pavel.\n\nAs Jack goes to meet Clara, he hears Pavel behind him. They exchange gunfire and Pavel drops dead. As Jack drives to meet Clara at the river, he feels his abdomen and realizes he has been shot. Jack arrives at the picnic spot and as he sees Clara, he collapses. Clara screams and runs to the car. A white butterfly flits skyward from Jack's car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[George Clooney]] as Jack/Edward\n* [[Violante Placido]] as Clara\n* [[Thekla Reuten]] as Mathilde\n* [[Paolo Bonacelli]] as Father Benedetto\n* [[Irina Bj\u00f6rklund]] as Ingrid\n* [[Johan Leysen]] as Pavel\n* [[Filippo Timi]] as Fabio \n* [[Anna Foglietta]] as Anna\n* [[Bj\u00f6rn Granath]] as the Swedish Assassin\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Sulmona0001.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Sulmona]] in [[Abruzzo]], Italian set of the film]]\n[[File:Castel del Monte 0328.jpg|thumb|right|View of the village of Castel del Monte (Abruzzo)]]\nFilming began in September 2009 and took place in [[Castel del Monte, Abruzzo|Castel del Monte]], [[Sulmona]], [[Castelvecchio Calvisio]], [[Calascio]] and [[Campo Imperatore]] in the [[Province of L'Aquila]] ([[Abruzzo]]); in Rome, and in [[\u00d6stersund]], [[J\u00e4mtland]] and other locations. As the Clooney character drives from Rome to Castel del Monte, there is an impressively long drive through the 4600-meter long San Domenico Tunnel (Galleria San Domenico) that is between the exits of [[Pescina]] and [[Cocullo]] on the [[Autostrada A25 (Italy)|A25 highway]] that connects Rome to [[Torano di Borgorose|Torano]] and [[Pescara]]. The car driven by Jack in the movie is a [[Fiat Tempra]] with Pescara licence plates.\n\nThe film's \"most romantic moment\", according to director Anton Corbijn\u2014when Jack takes Clara to a restaurant of her choice, their \"actual date\"\u2014was filmed at a restaurant in [[Pacentro]], near Sulmona. The comic-acting waiter in this restaurant scene was directed to stand in front of a two-bulb lamp fixture so that he appeared to have \"devil's horns\". Photographs on the restaurant's walls are reportedly all of the lovers of [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]. Clara orders [[Montepulciano d'Abruzzo]] wine for the dinner, and Corbijn said the film's company enjoyed many of the fine wines of the region during the months of production there.<ref name=DC01/>\n\nThe [[film score]] was written and composed by German singer-songwriter (and longtime friend of Corbijn) [[Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer]]. A 1967 song called \"Window of My Eyes\" by the Dutch blues band [[Cuby & the Blizzards]] is played over the ending credits. The aria \"[[Un bel d\u00ec vedremo]]\" (\"One fine day we'll see\") from Puccini's opera ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' can be heard in the background of one scene, and \"[[Tu vu\u00f2 f\u00e0 l'americano]]\" in another. In another scene, the Italian song \"[[La bambola]]\" by [[Patty Pravo]] plays.\n\n===Western films and other influences===\n''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), with [[Henry Fonda]] facing off as a villain in a gunfight, is playing on television on the back wall of a modest restaurant where Jack has been eating. In the DVD commentary, Corbijn notes this [[Homage (arts)|homage]] and says the American [[western (genre)|Western]]\u2014and more specifically the Italian-American [[Spaghetti Western]]s by Leone and others\u2014were explicit models for ''The American''. Corbijn also notes the [[Ennio Morricone]] scores made famous in ''Once Upon a Time in the West'', ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]'' (1966), and other films.<ref name=\"DC01\">Director commentary on DVD. Retrieved July 22, 2011.</ref> Speaking of the narrow, labyrinthine streets of the Italian hill towns where much of the action of ''The American'' occurs, Corbijn says he was thinking, in filming, of the streets of [[Venice]] and the way they appeared in [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973).<ref name=DC01/>\n\nLarge segments of the dialogue between Jack and Clara are taken verbatim from [[Graham Greene]]'s novel ''[[The Honorary Consul]]'' (1973).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Stetson |first=Nancy |date=June 30, 2016 |title=America: Land of the free, home of the brave, the movie, the book, the superhero, the beer and a whole lot more |work=Florida Weekly |location=Bonita Springs, FL |url=https://bonitasprings.floridaweekly.com/articles/america/}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\nThe first official poster was released on June 17, 2010.
