It was originally released in [[Japan]] on July 7 between episodes 54 and 55 of DBZ, at the \"Toei Anime Fair\" film festival, where it was shown as part of an [[Akira Toriyama]]-themed triple feature titled ''Toriyama Akira: The World'' (the other two films were [[anime]] versions of his one-shot stories ''Kennosuke-sama'' and ''[[Pink (manga)|Pink]]'').\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nA [[forest fire]] interrupts a camping trip enjoyed by [[Gohan]], [[Krillin]], [[Bulma]] and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Oolong|Oolong]]. Gohan and Krillin manage to put out the fire and use the Dragon Balls to restore the forest and the animals that were killed by the inferno, and Gohan befriends a small [[dragon]] he names Icarus. Unbeknownst to the group, the fire was started by a probe sent by a Saiyan space pirate named Turles, who bears a striking resemblance to [[Goku]] and who has chosen the Earth to plant the tree of might, which absorbs the life of a planet and converts it into fruit that when eaten, gives the consumer a massive power increase. Turles' [[henchmen]] plant the seed and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#King Kai|King Kai]] [[telepathically]] warns Goku of the danger. He, Krillin, [[Yamcha]], [[Tien Shinhan]], and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Chiaotzu|Chiaotzu]] attempt to destroy the tree using [[qi|energy]] blasts but fail. Turles' henchmen attack and overwhelm them. The Earth begins to succumb to the devastation of the tree's life absorption as water vanishes and plants and animals begin to perish.\n\nAfter Gohan fights back against the henchmen, Turles enters the fray after realizing Gohan is part-Saiyan and deduces that he is Goku's son, who he states is from the same class of Saiyan warrior and thus explains their similar appearances. Gohan impresses Turles with his power level and is invited to join his conquest, but he refuses and attempts to fight Turles before [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] intervenes to rescue him. Turles forces Piccolo to protect Gohan and the Namekian is dispatched. Turles creates an artificial moon and forces Gohan to observe it, causing him to transform into a great ape (oozaru), who attacks Goku but is calmed by the appearance of Icarus. Turles injures Icarus with an energy blast, causing Gohan to go into a frenzy before Goku severs his son's tail with an energy disc, transforming him back to normal and saving him from Turles' incoming energy blasts. Goku kills Turles' henchmen and engages his evil [[doppelganger]] in battle.\n\nGoku gains the upper hand against Turles, until he obtains a fully grown piece of fruit from the Tree of Might and consumes it. With the sudden surge of power, Turles overwhelms Goku until his allies come to his aid. As they fight Turles with limited success, Goku begins to form a Spirit Bomb, but the Earth, having been drained by the Tree of Might, does not have the energy left to properly fuel Goku's bomb which Turles destroys. However, the energy from the Tree of Might begins to flow into Goku and this allows him to create another, more powerful Spirit Bomb. Goku confronts Turles underneath the tree's roots and blasts him directly with the attack, launching him up the tree and destroying them both.\n\nThe Earth begins to heal as the heroes celebrate their victory. Piccolo meditates alone by a waterfall.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese voice actor\n! colspan=\"4\" |English voice actor\n|-\n! <small>[[Saban Entertainment|Saban]]/[[Funimation]]/<br>[[Ocean Studios]] (1997)</small>\n! <small>[[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer]]/[[Funimation]]/<br>[[Ocean Studios]] (1998)</small>\n! <small>Chinkel Post-Production/[[Mediawan Thematics|AB Groupe]] ({{Circa|2003}})<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Dragon-Ball-Z-The-Tree-of-Might/|title=Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might|website=Behind The Voice Actors|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref></small>\n! <small>[[Funimation]] (2006)</small>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Goku]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Masako Nozawa]]||[[Ian James Corlett]]||[[Peter Kelamis]]\n|[[David Gasman]]|| [[Sean Schemmel|Se\u00e1n Schemmel]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gohan]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Saffron Henderson]]\n|Jodi Forrest|| [[Stephanie Nadolny]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | {{Nihongo|Hire Dragon<br>|\u30cf\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3|Haiy\u0101 Doragon}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Naoki Tatsuta]]\n! <small>Icarus</small>\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Naoki Tatsuta\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Doug Rand\n! <small>Icarus</small>\n|-\n| [[Doug Parker (voice actor)|Doug Parker]]\n| [[Christopher Sabat|Christopher R.
