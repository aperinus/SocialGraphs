She is caught and brought home, where Martha's tutor, Walter O'Neil Sr., presents his timid son, Walter Jr., as the one responsible for Martha's recovery. Scolded by her aunt, Martha defiantly states her name is not Ivers, but Smith, her father's name.\n\nDuring a power failure, Sam comes for her, but Martha's aunt hears her calling to him from downstairs. While Sam slips out unnoticed, Mrs. Ivers starts beating Martha's kitten with her cane. Martha wrestles the cane away and strikes her across the head, causing her to fall down the stairs, accidentally killing her. When the power comes back on, Martha lies about the incident to Walter Sr. Even though Walter Jr. saw everything, he backs her up. The greedy Walter Sr. makes it clear to both Walter Jr. and Martha that he knows what happened but that as long as he and his son stand to benefit, he will play along. Sam leaves town.\n\nSeventeen years later, in 1946, Walter Sr. is now dead, and Walter Jr. is now Iverstown's [[district attorney]] and is married to Martha, who has used her inheritance to expand the Ivers milling empire. Their marriage is one-sided; he loves her, but Walter knows she does not love him.\n\nSam, a former soldier and itinerant gambler, drives into the small town by chance and, after an accident, leaves his car to be repaired. While waiting, he goes to his old home, now a boarding house. He meets Antonia \"Toni\" Marachek, who has just been released from jail. She misses her bus, and they spend the night in adjoining rooms in a hotel. She is later picked up for violating her [[probation]] by not returning to her hometown. Sam asks Walter to use his influence to get Toni released.\n\nWalter is convinced Sam has [[blackmail]] in mind. Sam then learns that Walter Sr. had presented Martha's version of the 1928 [[Voluntary manslaughter|accidental murder]] to the police: that an intruder murdered Martha's aunt. With his leverage, Walter Sr. had made Martha marry his son. When the police identified a former employee of the aunt as the murderer, the two Walters and Martha helped convict him, and he was hanged.\n\nWhen Martha reacts joyfully to seeing Sam, a jealous Walter forces Toni to set him up. Sam is beaten up and driven out of town, but he is too tough to be intimidated. When all else fails, Walter makes a halfhearted attempt to kill Sam himself but is easily disarmed. Walter inadvertently blurts out his fears of blackmail, only to learn that Sam had not witnessed the death. Martha breaks down and laments that he left without her all those years ago, taking her only chance for love and freedom with him.\n\nSam is torn between his old love and his new one with Toni. Although he eventually forgives Toni for betraying him, he and Martha spend an idyllic day together, rekindling his feelings for her.\n\nWalter arranges to meet Sam to settle matters. Before Sam arrives, Walter gets drunk, and Martha finds out about the meeting. When Walter falls down the stairs, Martha urges Sam to kill her unconscious husband. Sam instead brings Walter around. Martha pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot Sam in \"self-defense\" as an intruder. Sam tells her it would work if she could get Walter to corroborate her story. Sam turns his back on her and leaves.\n  \t\t  \t\nWalter embraces and kisses Martha, then points the gun at her midriff. Oddly relieved, she puts her thumb over his finger on the trigger and presses. As she is dying, she defiantly states her name is not Martha Ivers, but Martha Smith. Outside, Sam hears the shot. He runs toward the mansion but sees Walter, holding Martha's body, shoot himself. Sam and Toni drive away together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Barbara Stanwyck]] as Martha Ivers\n* [[Van Heflin]] as Sam Masterson\n* [[Lizabeth Scott]] as Antonia \"Toni\" Marachek\n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as Walter O'Neil\n* [[Judith Anderson]] as Mrs. Ivers\n* [[Roman Bohnen]] as Mr. O'Neil\n* [[Darryl Hickman]] as Sam Masterson as a Child\n* [[Janis Wilson]] as Martha Ivers as a Child\n* [[Ann Doran]] as Bobbi St. John\n* [[Frank Orth]] as Hotel Clerk\n* [[James Flavin]] as Detective #1\n* [[Mickey Kuhn]] as Walter O'Neil as a Child\n* [[Charles D.

Producer [[Hal B.

When she saw the coin trick Heflin had learned\u2014at Milestone's suggestion, to show that Heflin's character was a professional gambler\u2014she informed him he should make sure he did not do it during any of her important lines, since she had a bit of business that would upstage him, if she had to.  With that she raised her skirt high and adjusted her garter.  Heflin is seen rolling a coin on his fingers several times in several scenes.<ref name=callahan /> Kirk Douglas later wrote that Stanwyck was indifferent to him at first, until at one point she focused on him and told him, \"Hey, you're pretty good.\"  Douglas, smarting from having been ignored previously, replied, \"Too late, Miss Stanwyck,\" but the two got on well after that.<ref name=tcmart /><ref name=callahan />\n\nSix months after the film's release, Milestone gave an interview in which he said he would never work for producer Hal B.
