It won the [[Silver Lion]] for Best Direction at the [[Venice Film Festival]].\n\nThe literal translation of the title is actually \"Black (female) cat, white tomcat\". The movie characters speak in [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] - frequently switching among them.\n\n==Plot==\nMatko Destanov, a small-time [[Romani people|Romani]] smuggler and profiteer, lives with his teenage son Zare in a ramshackle house by the [[Danube|Danube River]] in eastern [[Serbia]] near the [[Bulgaria]]n border.  He has plans to steal a whole train of smuggled fuel. To obtain a loan that would subsidize the heist, he visits Grga Piti\u0107, a wheelchair-bound old gangster, who is an old friend of Zarije Destanov, Matko's father and Zare's grandfather. Matko plots the details of the job with an ally named Dadan, a rich, fun-living, drug-snorting gangster who has a harem, juggles grenades, and cheats at gambling. However, Dadan double-crosses him and glitches up the deal by giving Matko a drink that is drugged, and carrying out the job while Matko is unconscious.  Matko is unable to repay his loan, so Dadan makes a deal whereby he would forgive the debt if Zare marries Afrodita, Dadan's [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] sister. However, Zare (17) is in love with Ida (26), a barmaid who works in an establishment run by her Roma grandmother Sujka, and Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams. Dadan coerces Afrodita into marrying by dunking her in a well, while Zare first learns of the scheme to marry him off from Ida, who has overheard Dadan and Matko plotting it in the restaurant where she works. Meanwhile, Zare retrieves Zarije from the hospital where he is being kept, with the aid of a gypsy band. Grga Piti\u0107 is having problems of his own, as he wants his grandsons, including the 2.00m giant Grga Veliki, to get married.\n\nThe two reluctantly endure the wedding ceremony held at Matko's house, which Dadan refuses to postpone despite the sudden apparent death of Zarije. They were not supposed to have a wedding while in mourning, but Dadan decides to delay the death announcement, so Matko and Zare hide Zarije's body in the attic, packed in ice. Ida and Sujka provide the catering for the wedding, and Ida is upset at seeing her beloved married to someone else. However, the bride runs away mid-ceremony, pursued by Dadan, Matko and Dadan's criminal cronies. Meanwhile, Grga Veliki is driving his father and brother to Matko's house so that they may visit Zarije's grave (Grga Piti\u0107 and Zarije  old friends). The fleeing bride stumbles across Grga Veliki, and the couple fall instantly in love. Grga Piti\u0107 arrives on the scene, after his wheelchair had fallen out the back of the truck and rolled downhill, and he is delighted that Grga Veliki has found his mate. The old gangster forces Dadan, who had once worked for him, to accept the match.\n\nThe groom conspires with Sujka and Ida to bring Dadan down a peg, and rigs the [[outhouse]] so that the seat will come apart. While the preparations for the wedding ceremony of Afrodita and Grga Veliki are being conducted, Matko and Dadan pass the time by playing dice, with Dadan cheating. Sujka comes in during the game, and serves the unsuspecting Dadan a drink spiked with a laxative. Grga Piti\u0107 apparently dies, and Dadan and Matko hide his body in the attic, where Zarije's body is also hidden. However, the two corpses soon both come back to life; they were not dead after all. They are surprised to find themselves together, as they had not seen each other for 25 years and each had thought the other was dead. During the ceremony, Dadan starts to feel uncomfortable and rushes into the outhouse, only to fall into the manure. His harem and cronies desert him, and as he tries to clean himself off on a goose, only Matko remains loyal, and he provides Dadan with a shower from the garden hose. Zare grabs the wedding official at gunpoint and orders him to solemnize his marriage with his sweetheart, Ida, and the two sail off together on a riverboat set for [[Bulgaria]] with a fistful of cash stashed in his grandfather's accordion, the blessing of their respective grandparents and, as witnesses, a black cat and a white cat.\n\n==Cast==\n*Bajram Severd\u017ean as Matko Destanov\n*[[Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107]] as Dadan Karambolo\n*[[Branka Kati\u0107]] as Ida\n*Florijan Ajdini as Zare Destanov\n*Ljubica Ad\u017eovi\u0107 as Sujka\n*Zabit Memedov as Zarije Destanov\n*Sabri Sulejmani as Grga Piti\u0107\n*Jasar Destani as Grga Veliki\n*Salija Ibraimova as Afrodita\n*Stojan Sotirov as Bulgarian Customs Officer\n*[[Predrag Lakovi\u0107]] as Priest\n*[[Miki Manojlovi\u0107]] as Priest\n\n==Production==\nIn the aftermath of the worldwide success, as well as the controversy, of his previous feature, [[Palme d'Or]]-winning ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'', Kusturica was so hurt by the aggressive criticism coming from several French intellectuals that he publicly announced his retirement from movies at the age of 41.\n\nHe later changed his mind, deciding to come back with a project on Gypsy music which he originally envisioned as a documentary with a working title ''Musika Akrobatika''. The idea further evolved and Kusturica decided to add narrative flourishes of his own, so ''Musika Akrobatika'' got transformed into a fictional feature ''Black Cat, White Cat''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/090599film-cat.html 'Black Cat, White Cat': Kusturica Returns to the Gypsy Life];''New York Times'', 5 September 1999</ref>\n\n===Recurring images===\nThere are many recurring motifs  throughout the film, for example a scene where a pig is devouring an old run-down [[Trabant]], and the appearance of the titular two cats (a black one and a white one), who end up as the only witnesses to Zare and Ida's wedding.\n\nAlso, Grga Piti\u0107 is obsessed with the last line in the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', \"this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\", which he compulsively watches on his TV set and gets to say to Zarije at the end, looking at Matko washing Dadan.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=August 2017}}\n''Black Cat, White Cat'' received a positive response from critics, garnering an 85% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 34 reviews with an average score of 7/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_cat_white_cat/ Black Cat, White Cat];[[Rotten Tomatoes]]</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a positive review, summing the film up as \"a mad scramble through the Felliniesque realm of Mr. Kusturica's imagination\". She further praised Srdjan Todorovic's portrayal of Dadan Karambolo as \"a repetitive but irresistible turn\" before concluding that \"Mr. Kusturica so evidently adores all of the film's other characters that ''Black Cat, White Cat'' becomes a wild, warts-and-all celebration of their lives and like Fellini, Kusturica finds true grace where it's least expected and makes films utterly, uncompromisingly his own\".<ref>{{cite web | author=Janet Maslin | title=Take Gypsies, Add the Danube And Mix Well With Jubilation | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B05EFDE1338F930A35753C1A96E958260 | work=The New York Times | date=October 3, 1998 | access-date=November 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn his review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Kevin Thomas refers to the film as a \"raucous, knockabout comedy, a paean to love, freedom and friendship\", before concluding that despite being two hours and nine minutes long, ''Black Cat, White Cat'' \"gets away with it better than most over-long movies due to its beguiling rambling shaggy dog-story quality.\"<ref>{{cite web | author=Kevin Thomas | title='Black Cat' a Beguiling, Lighthearted Rom | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/17/entertainment/ca-11081p | work=Los Angeles Times | date=September 17, 1999 | access-date=November 8, 2013}} {{dead link|date=June 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nIn a generally positive review, [[J. Hoberman]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' refers to the film as \"bravura moviemaking by any objective standard\" and a \"vehicle for the director's lowdown magic-realist fantasies about Romany gangsters, which has a velocity that belies its jerry-built mise-en-sc\u00e8ne\" concluding that \"''Black Cat, White Cat'' is determined to twist every character into an ideogram for vulgar humanity\" while wondering if \"these gypsies are a screen on which the Bosnian-born director can project his own feelings of ostracism and homelessness\".<ref>{{cite web | author=J.

O'Hehir concludes with \"Kusturica strikes a half-ironic tone throughout this overcrowded, cacophonous masterpiece that\u2019s almost impossible to categorize. In the tradition of Eastern European film, he\u2019s satirizing the conventions of rural magic realism at least as much as he\u2019s embracing them. But there\u2019s nothing cynical or cold-hearted about ''Black Cat, White Cat''. Like the waves of geese, pigs, goats, dogs and cats that sometimes threaten to overwhelm the human characters, it is recklessly, indescribably alive\".<ref>{{cite web | author=Andrew O'Hehir | title=Black Cat, White Cat | url=http://www.salon.com/1999/09/23/cat_3/singleton/ | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913073519/http://www.salon.com/1999/09/23/cat_3/singleton/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=September 13, 2012 | work=Salon | date=September 23, 1999 | access-date=November 8, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nPeter Stack of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' praised the film's characters who \"whether freakish or treacherous, come up wonderfully human.\"<ref>{{cite web | author=Peter Stack | title='Black Cat' Pokes Fun at Slovenian Mobsters | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1999/09/17/DD23732.DTL | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=September 17, 1999 | access-date=November 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWeb critic [[James Berardinelli]] praised the film as \"something fresh and vibrant in an era when something as idiotic as ''Armageddon'' is the top-grossing movie of 1998 and films generally follow safe, comfortable patterns because that's what the studios' research shows that audiences want\". He commended the film's \"earthy feel as well as its charm that lies in it lacking the polished glaze of most big budget features although being expertly filmed\", praised the performances of Bajram Severdzan and Branka Katic, and concluded that \"while not a masterpiece, Kusturica's latest film is a real treat for those in search of a healthy dose of laughter set in a culture whose intricacies are rarely captured on film.\"<ref>{{cite web | author=James Berardinelli | title=Black Cat, White Cat | url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/b/black_cat.html | work=ReelViews | year=1999 | access-date=November 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Original Soundtrack From The Film 'Black Cat White Cat'\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1998 (CD)\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 55:50\n| label      = [[Barclay Records|Barclay]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}} [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r584238|pure_url=yes}} link]\n}}\nMusic has an important place in this picture, as it is present in almost every scene.
