Moritz]]. The film stars [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]], [[Martin Henderson]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Monet Mazur]], [[Jaime Pressly]], [[Will Yun Lee]], [[Jay Hernandez]], [[Matt Schulze]], [[Max Beesley]], [[Fredro Starr]] and [[Christina Milian]]. The film tells the story of biker Cary Ford (Martin Henderson) and how he discovers some motorcycles filled with crystal meth, he stows them away. But it turns out that villainous gangster Henry James (Matt Schulze) has plans to recover his drugs. James frames Ford for the murder of Junior (Fredro Starr), the brother of Trey (Ice Cube), who heads the Reapers, a notoriously malicious biker gang. Ford goes on the run in an attempt to clear his name, while the FBI and multiple groups of motorcycle-mounted marauders chase after him.\n\n''Torque'' was theatrically released on January 16, 2004 in the United States. The film under-performed at the box office, grossing $46.5 million worldwide against production budget of $40 million, and received generally negative reviews with common criticisms regarding the performances, writing and direction, though some critics praised the action sequences. It was nominated for several [[Taurus Award]]s for its stunts.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=September 2021}}\nThe film begins with two cars racing in the middle of the desert. Biker Cary Ford ([[Martin Henderson]]) pulls up on his motorcycle and tries to pass them. He finally does so and stops at a diner owned by his ex-girlfriend Shane ([[Monet Mazur]]). There are pictures all over the wall of Ford and Shane back when they were together. Ford takes one of the pictures. He then goes back outside and the two street racers who didn't let him pass arrive. The three get into a fight but Ford beats up both of them before letting them go.\n\nNext Ford meets up with his two best friends Dalton ([[Jay Hernandez]]) and Val ([[Will Yun Lee]]) and as they take a ride back to town to a motorcycle party, they encounter a black biker gang called the Reapers, consisting of Trey ([[Ice Cube]]) the leader and his brother Junior ([[Fredro Starr]]), who threaten Ford after getting into a scuffle with the latter.\n\nFord sees Shane and the two begin conversing, with Shane saying that she is mad that Ford left. A biker gang called the Hellions pulls up which includes Henry James ([[Matt Schulze]]) the leader, his girlfriend China ([[Jaime Pressly]]) and his right-hand man Luther ([[Max Beesley]]). Henry is pissed at Ford for stealing his bikes (which contain drugs) while Ford offers a little pithy comeback in return. Henry gives Ford an ultimatum till sun down to return the bikes.\n\nFord and his friends arrive at a nightclub where tons of biker gangs hang out. The three gangs run into each other and cause a big brawl. A scared Junior runs into the bathroom to find the Hellions there. Junior apologizes to Henry for not being able to pay him back for a botched drug deal (which Trey refused to allow earlier) and begs Henry to give him some time to work it out. Henry refuses and kills Junior by strangling him to death with a bike chain. Ford, Shane and the two friends go back to a motel to spend the night, where Ford and Shane normalize their relationship a bit.\n\nAt the murder scene where Junior was found dead, two [[FBI]] agents, Henderson ([[Justina Machado]])  and her partner, Jay McPherson ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]) show up, assuring Trey that they will take care of the case and find Junior's killer. China becomes a false witness to Junior's death and gives a statement that Cary Ford killed Junior, hearing which a vengeful Trey swears to kill Ford.\n\nAt a diner Shane sees on the TV that Ford is wanted for Junior's murder. Shane tells Ford and the four leave the diner and hit the road. The Reapers pull up at the diner and a high speed chase ensues with all riding into a forest full of palm trees. Ford tells Shane and the friends to split up. Ford rides out of the forest into a desert drawing Trey, resulting in the chase being led near a passenger train. Ford jumps up onto the train and Trey follows riding on top of the train and going inside the passenger cars. In the struggle, Trey slips and falls in front of the train with his leg getting caught on the tracks. Ford helps him out, gives him his own bike to escape leaving Trey puzzled. Shane, Dalton and Val meet up with Ford and the four find a cave for the night to stay.\n\nFord talks it out with his friends and says that he should call the FBI agents to tell them that he is innocent. Ford calls them and McPherson picks up the phone. He says that he doesn't believe Ford but Henderson does. Next morning the four leave the cave and hitch a ride inside a truck. The truck is stopped by police checkpoint and just before the agents open the back of the truck, Ford and Shane bust out of the truck in a race car with the two friends on their bikes. The four drive onto a highway with the two FBI agents and Trey on their tail.\n\nThe scene shifts to a highway as Ford jumps out of the car onto Val's bike and tells him to ride with Shane. Trey and the two agents follow. The agents survive a crash where their black Hummer hits a construction pipe. Trey rides his bike into Ford's and the two crash. Holding Trey at gunpoint, Ford explains to Trey that he did not kill Junior. Not wanting to believe him, Trey asks who the real killer is. Ford says that it was Henry and that he set them both up. Willing to take a leap of faith, Trey agrees to partner with Ford as he sets up a meeting with the agents.\n\nAt Shane's garage, Ford calls Shane and tells her that he wants her, Val and Dalton to come and meet him and Trey there. Subsequently, the two FBI agents bust in and tell Trey and Ford to get down. Henderson asks for an explanation since she believes Ford is innocent and as he tells them, McPherson turns and shoots Henderson, apparently killing her. McPherson reveals himself as Henry's mole in the agency and that he is working with the Hellions after making a deal with him. Henry, China and Luther show up with Dalton and Val in chains and Shane as hostage. Ford says that Henry can take the bikes back but Henry wants to kill Ford and Trey (after admitting to Trey that he had killed Junior).\n\nThereafter, a big fight scene begins with Trey killing Luther by hanging him with a chain and Henry and China leaving the garage. Ford frees Shane while Trey unties Val and Dalton and they leave the garage. Just before they do Henderson (who was wearing a bullet proof vest) blows up the garage killing McPherson. Outside of the garage, China meets up with Shane and the two fight on their bikes. The fight ends with Shane kicking China off her bike and throwing her through a car windshield, killing her.\n\nFinally, Ford catches up with Henry on the street in a bike chase. Henry shoots at the gas of Ford's ([[MTT Turbine Superbike]]) causing gas to leak from it. Henry's subsequent shots cause the gas trail to light up. Ford soars through the air and lands on top of Henry's bike, the fire catches up to them both causing both bike's to explode throwing Ford in the air and killing Henry. Shane picks him up and they drive back to the garage to find the others. It is also revealed that Henderson survived but is injured.\n\nFord and Shane get back together and decide that the four need a vacation (with Shane suggesting [[Mexico]]). Val picks up his girlfriend Nina ([[Christina Milian]]) and from a distance we see the five ride off in the desert as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Henderson]] as Cary Ford, the protagonist who is framed for murder\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Trey Wallace, leader of The Reapers who hated Ford for the framed murder of his brother, their member, but later, when he realized the truth, became an ally to Ford\n* [[Monet Mazur]] as Shane, Ford's longtime girlfriend\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as FBI Agent Jay McPherson\n* [[Matt Schulze]] as Henry James, leader of the [[Outlaw motorcycle club]] known as The Hellions, he is responsible for framing Ford and the film's antagonist\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as Dalton, Hispanic-American friend of Ford\n* [[Will Yun Lee]] as Val, Korean-American friend of Ford\n* [[Jaime Pressly]] as 'China', girlfriend of Henry James\n* [[Max Beesley]] as Luther, second-in-command of The Hellions\n* [[Christina Milian]] as Nina, Val's new fling and new friend of Ford\n* [[Faizon Love]] as Sonny, member of The Reapers, drives a black [[Ford Excursion]]\n* [[Fredro Starr]] as Junior Wallace, younger brother of Trey who is murdered\n* [[Justina Machado]] as FBI Agent Tehya Henderson, partners with FBI Agent McPherson\n* Hayden Mcfarland as Kho\n* John Ashker as Yellow [[Acura RSX]] Driver\n* Lance Gilbert as 18 Wheeler Driver\n\n===Cameos===\n[[Dane Cook]] makes a cameo appearance as a tourist that runs into Henry.

The film's director [[Joseph Kahn (director)|Joseph Kahn]] said his intention was to make a \"[[piss take]]\" version of the [[Fast & Furious|''Fast & Furious'' franchise]], even though both movies were produced by Neal H. Moritz.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/05/08/the-filmcast-after-dark-ep-98-the-making-of-torque-and-the-imagery-of-kick-ass-guest-joseph-kahn-director-of-torque/ | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130202190227/http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/05/08/the-filmcast-after-dark-ep-98-the-making-of-torque-and-the-imagery-of-kick-ass-guest-joseph-kahn-director-of-torque/ | url-status = dead | archive-date = February 2, 2013 | title = The /Filmcast: After Dark - Ep. 98 - The Making of Torque and the Imagery of Kick-Ass (GUEST: Joseph Kahn, Director of Torque) | date = May 8, 2010 | author = David Chen }}</ref> However, ''Torque'' was made by [[Warner Bros]], while ''The Fast and the Furious'' is made by [[Universal Studios|Universal]].\n\n''Torque'' specifically references ''The Fast and the Furious'' at one point, taking a line directly from the film. Henderson's character Ford borrows [[Vin Diesel]]'s line, \"I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.\"  To which Shane (Monet Mazur) replies, \"That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.\"\n\nMatt Schulze, who portrayed the film's antagonist, Henry James, also appeared in ''The Fast and the Furious'', playing Dominic Toretto's childhood friend and member of the truck hijacking team, Vince. Schulze would later reprise his role as Vince in ''[[Fast Five]]'', the fifth installment in the series that transitioned from street racing to an action-packed heist series.\n\nAnother reference to ''The Fast and the Furious'' is since ''Torque'' focused on motorcycles, it does show a [[street racing|street race]] in the beginning, involving a quarter-mile race between a [[Mitsubishi Eclipse]] and an [[Acura RSX]], with the protagonist Cary Ford beating the 2 cars on his Aprilia RSV motorcycle. Also, when Ford rides past the road sign at the start of the film, it spins and reads \"cars suck\".\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at #4 at the U.S. Box office raking in $9,970,557 [[USD]] in its first opening weekend.
