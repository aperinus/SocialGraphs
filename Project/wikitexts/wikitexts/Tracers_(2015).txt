Scott, and Kevin Lund. The film stars [[Taylor Lautner]], [[Marie Avgeropoulos]], [[Adam Rayner]], and [[Rafi Gavron]]. The film was released on March 20, 2015.\n\n== Plot ==\nCam is a New York City [[Bicycle messenger|bike messenger]] struggling to make ends meet. He rents a garage from a woman, Angie. While on a run, Cam wrecks his bike after a stranger named Nikki causes an accident while escaping police officers. Cam is later accosted by Jerry and Hu, enforcers who take his check and cash, warning him that he is behind on payments for a $15,000 loan to the Tong, a local gang that controls Chinatown, and warn him not to miss another payment.\n\nCam spends his free time trying to fix his father's [[Pontiac GTO|1967 Pontiac GTO]]. Cam's boss calls, telling him that his \"girlfriend\" has dropped off his new bike. Cam finds Nikki to thank her and tries to copy Nikki's [[parkour]], but fails. He also meets the rest of Nikki's group, who warn him about the dangers of parkour.\n\nCam begins practicing parkour. Eventually, Cam catches the attention of the group, and is invited to train with them. He is formally introduced to the rest of the squad: Jax, Tate, Nikki's older brother Dylan, and Miller, the group's leader. After a workout, Cam arrives home to find Jerry and Hu taking his father's car, taking off $5,000 dollars off his debt for it. They warn him he has one month to pay the rest of the $10,000, threatening Angie and her son. Angered, Angie packs Cam's belongings and kicks him out. Cam joins the group for work.\n\nMiller tells Cam that he must follow two rules: if Cam gets into trouble, he must call him immediately and he must stay out of Chinatown. Cam quickly becomes a valuable member of the team. He visits Angie at work and explains that he took the loan from the Tongs to help his sick mother keep her house, but that the money wasn't enough to stop [[foreclosure]] and his mother died a week after.\n\nCam runs into Jerry and Hu, who beat him for not having the money and give him two weeks to pay off his debt or they will kill Angie and Joey. Cam makes a move on Nikki at a party. Nikki initially reciprocates, but then runs out of the party. Miller arrives to pick her up as she is Miller's partner. Nikki apologizes to Cam for not being honest. Cam invites Nikki to leave the city with him once he clears his debt, but Nikki is hesitant.\n\nFor their biggest heist yet, the group tries to rob a bank run by Vietnamese gangsters. They discover that the money had been moved earlier, and flee as reinforcements arrive. Jax is shot and killed, and Cam is arrested. Miller visits Cam while the police question him. Miller reveals himself to be James Hatcher, a corrupt [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent. Miller tells Cam he can free him by claiming him as a [[Informant|confidential informant]] for the DEA; in return, Cam must help him pull off one last heist. Cam reluctantly agrees. Cam confronts Nikki for not telling him Miller's true identity. Nikki apologizes and reveals she is indebted to Miller for helping Dylan escape custody for beating a man who had sexually assaulted her.\n\nOn the day of the heist, Miller, Cam, and Dylan go to a [[Russian mafia|Russian]] [[Safe house|safehouse]] to steal a stash of diamonds. Nikki realizes Cam is being set up and goes to save him. Miller steals the diamonds and almost kills Cam, but is stopped as guards arrive and attack them. Cam takes the diamonds and flees, and Miller chases. Reuniting with Nikki, Cam leads Miller into a restaurant owned by Chen, leader of the Tongs. Chen reminds Miller that he has violated his agreement to never enter Chinatown and has him board a ship headed for [[Macau]], never to return.\n\nCam hands the diamonds to Chen, clearing his debt. Jerry congratulates Cam for clearing his debt and returns his father's car, now fully restored. Cam and Nikki drive off.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Taylor Lautner]] as Cam\n* [[Marie Avgeropoulos]] as Nikki\n* [[Adam Rayner]] as Miller\n* [[Rafi Gavron]] as Dylan\n* [[Christopher Jackson (actor)|Christopher Jackson]] as Lonnie\n* Luciano Acuna Jr. as Tate\n* Josh Yadon as Jax\n* Johnny M.
