The film's notable cinematography captures a wide range of landscapes across China's [[Xinjiang]] province. It was China's official entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], though it did not get nominated.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in western China in 700AD during the [[Tang Dynasty]], and revolves around two protagonists, the first of whom is Lieutenant Li of the Chinese army. Li's refusal to kill [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]] women and child prisoners is classed as a mutiny, leading him to be expelled from the army and to become a fugitive, traveling through the [[Gobi Desert]]. Years later, he is saved by the survivors of a caravan which carries a powerful, mystical relic accompanied by a Buddhist monk. Li protects the caravan from G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks as well as the overlord of the region, Master An, who is hired by the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khan to seize the relic.\n\nThe second protagonist, a Japanese emissary, Lai Xi, is ordered by the emperor of China to kill the fugitive, Li. In a twist of fate, Lai Xi discovers that the caravan is on a mission and helps Li to defend it, to ensure that it arrives at the capital safely. They promise to fight each other only after their duty is done, although that battle never comes to pass.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Jiang Wen]] as Lieutenant Li\n*[[Kiichi Nakai]] as Emissary Lai Xi\n*[[Wang Xueqi]] as Master An\n*[[Zhao Wei]] as Wen Zhu\n*Hasi Bagen as Cao Jian, One Eye Eagle\n*He Tao as Ma Gun\n*Lau Lei-nin as Wu Lao Er\n*Wang Deshun as Old Diehard\n*Li Haibin as Zao Zimo\n*Yeerjiang Mahepushen as Master An's servant\n*Hou Fugao as guard\n*Zhou Yun as Monk Jue Hui\n*Lee Wai as Di Hu / Salamander\n*Do Yuk-ming as rider\n*Wang Handong as rider\n*Yang Haiquan as Baldy\n*Tuerxunjiang Zunong as innkeeper\n*Wong Hiu as emperor\n*Sang Baozhong as General Wen\n*Gao Qiang\n*Sun Yingjie\n*Liu Mingzhe\n*Liu Qingwei\n*Hao Youyue\n*Guo Zhengjian\n*Chen Xiongwei\n*Qi Kejian\n*Chan Laap-san\n*Xie Ze\n*Feiluola\n*Sailike\n*Azili\n*Hanati\n*Zumureti\n*Ayiguli\n*Gulizha\n*Maierhaba\n*Mikereyi\n*Qing Gele\n*Kunakebayi\n*Julaiti\n*Li Guohai\n*Gao Quanjun\n*Sang Zongzhong\n}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n'''11th Beijing Student Film Festival'''\n* Won: Best Visual Effect\n* Won: Favorite Actress ([[Zhao Wei]])\n* Won: Favorite Actor ([[Jiang Wen]])\n\n'''27th [[Hundred Flowers Awards]]'''\n* Nominated: Best Film\n* Nominated: Best Actress ([[Zhao Wei]])\n* Nominated: Best Actor ([[Jiang Wen]])\n* Nominated: Best Actor ([[Wang Xueqi]])\n\n'''24th [[Golden Rooster Awards]]'''\n* Nominated: Best Supporting Actor ([[Wang Xueqi]])\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Warriors of Heaven and Earth: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = [[A.
