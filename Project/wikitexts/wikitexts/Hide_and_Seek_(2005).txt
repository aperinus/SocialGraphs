It was directed by [[John Polson]]. [[Hughes brothers|Albert Hughes]] was initially set to direct, making his debut as a solo director, but left due to creative differences.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2003/film/markets-festivals/hughes-off-hide-de-niro-s-still-in-1117891626/|title= Hughes off 'Hide'; De Niro's still in|first= Claude|last= Brodesser|date= August 27, 2003|access-date= March 14, 2022|work= Variety}}</ref>\n\nThe film opened in the United States on January 28, 2005, and grossed $127 million worldwide. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] cited praise for De Niro and Fanning for their performances, though its consensus called the film \"derivative, illogical and somewhat silly\". Fanning received an [[MTV Movie Award for Best Scared-As-S**t Performance|MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance]] in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing his discovery of the body of his wife Alison ([[Amy Irving]]) in a bathtub after her apparent suicide, Dr. David Callaway ([[Robert De Niro]]), a psychologist, decides to move with his 9-year-old daughter Emily ([[Dakota Fanning]]) to [[upstate New York]]. There, Emily makes an imaginary friend she calls \"Charlie\". Her friendship with Charlie begins to disturb David when he discovers their cat dead in the bathtub, who Emily claims was a victim of \"Charlie\". David has nightmares of the New Year's Eve party that occurred the night before Alison's death.\n\nWhen a family friend, Dr. Katherine Carson ([[Famke Janssen]]), comes to visit David, Emily reveals that she and Charlie have a mutual desire to upset her father. David meets Elizabeth Young ([[Elisabeth Shue]]), a local woman, and her niece, Amy, who is the same age as Emily. Hoping to cultivate a healthy friendship for Emily, David sets up a play date. Amy is eager  to become friends and gives one of her dolls to Emily but the play date is spoiled when Emily cuts up Amy's doll's face. Emily tells David she doesn't need any friends.\n\nDavid invites Elizabeth over to dinner one night, where Emily acts hostile toward her. Elizabeth later tries to make peace with Emily. When Emily tells her that she is playing hide-and-seek with Charlie, Elizabeth indulges her by pretending to look for Charlie. When she opens the closet, someone bursts out and pushes her out the window to her death.\n\nDavid asks Emily what happened. Emily claims Charlie killed Elizabeth and forced Emily to help him move the body. She tells David the location of the body. David discovers Elizabeth in the bathtub full of blood (similar to how Alison died). Armed with a knife, he goes outside, where he meets their neighbor and assumes that his neighbor is Charlie. He cuts the neighbor and the neighbor calls the police.\n\nBack in the house, David finds that, although he has been in his study many times, the boxes were actually never unpacked after the move. He realizes that he has [[dissociative identity disorder]] and Charlie is not imaginary at all: \"Charlie\" is David himself. Whenever \"Charlie\" would emerge, David would be in his study. He also finally recalls the New Year's Eve party the night before his wife's death. He had caught Alison making out with another guest. \"Charlie\" was created as a way to express David's rage so that he could murder his wife, something the docile David was too decent to do. Emily knew the entire time about her father's split personality but did not tell him because she was unsure which personality murdered her mother until \"Charlie\" killed Elizabeth.\n\nOnce David realizes the truth, he becomes completely consumed by Charlie, leading him to murder the local sheriff, who arrives to investigate the neighbor. Emily calls Katherine for help, tricks Charlie, and escapes into the cave where she originally met Charlie. Katherine takes the gun from the dead sheriff and finds Charlie in the cave. He pretends to be David and attacks Katherine. Katherine begs for David to fight his murderous other personality. Charlie says David no longer exists. Emily emerges, begging Charlie to let Katherine go. Her distraction allows Katherine to shoot Charlie, killing him at last.\n\nLater, Emily is preparing for school in her new life with Katherine. But Emily's drawing of herself with two heads suggests that she might also have [[dissociative identity disorder]].\n\n==Endings==\nThis film has a total of five different endings, The US theatrical version had the following ending:\n\nPreparing for school while living a new life with Katherine, Emily draws a picture of herself and Katherine, looking happy. But when the camera cuts back to Emily's drawing, Emily has two heads suggesting she now has dissociative identity disorder. This ending is included as an alternate ending on DVDs featuring the International theatrical ending.\nAnother four were included on the DVD:\n\n'''Happy Drawing''': The same as the ending in the US theatrical version, except that the drawing Emily makes of herself has only one head, suggesting that she does not have dissociative identity disorder.\n\n'''One Final Game''': Emily is shown seemingly in a new apartment bedroom, and Katherine's actions mirror that of her mother's at the beginning of the film. She reassures her love to Emily and begins to leave the room. Emily asks Katherine to leave the door open, but Katherine insists she cannot. As the door shuts, a protected window is visible on the door. The next cut is of Katherine locking the door from the outside, revealing this assumed apartment bedroom is actually a hospital room in a children's psychiatric ward. Emily gets out of bed and does a Hide and Seek countdown. She nears the closet, opens, and smiles at her own reflection in the mirror.\n\n'''Emily's Fate (International theatrical ending)''': Same as above in the psychiatric ward, but without the Hide and Seek countdown. This ending was featured in the international theatrical version.\n\n'''Life with Katherine''': An ending similar to that in the psychiatric ward, but in this ending Emily is not in a ward but her new home. After Katherine shuts the door, Emily gets out of bed to play Hide and Seek with her own reflection.\n\nOn the DVD, the main menu enables you to watch the film with any one of the five endings.\n\n==Main cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as David Callaway/Charlie \n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as Emily Callaway\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Dr. Katherine \"Kate\" Carson\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Elizabeth Young\n* [[Amy Irving]] as Allison Callaway\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Sheriff Hafferty\n* [[Melissa Leo]] as Laura\n* [[Robert John Burke]] as Steven\n\n==Release==\n[[20th Century Fox]] released two versions of the film: the international version and the domestic version.
