J. Cutler]] and based on the [[If I Stay|2009 novel of the same name]] by [[Gayle Forman]].\n\nThe film stars [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]], [[Mireille Enos]], [[Joshua Leonard]], and [[Stacy Keach]]. It was released on August 22, 2014, grossing $78.9{{nbsp}}million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nMia Hall and her family are getting ready to go on with their normal day activities when it is announced on the radio that school has been canceled. Mia's father, Denny, is a teacher and as a result of the snow day does not have to go to work. Mia's mother, Kat, a travel agent, decides to call in sick and along with her family and Mia's brother Teddy so they can get on the road to visit Mia's grandparents, who live on a farm.\n\nThe story flashes back to Mia's early life with a rockstar father and an inexperienced mother, when one day they take Mia to a music class where Mia decides that she wants to start playing the cello. After her parents see that Mia is passionate about the cello, they hire a teacher to help her play. Kat is shown pregnant with Teddy, whom Mia thinks is the reason for her father's departure from his band.\n\nYears later, an adolescent Mia is still passionate about the cello and is playing at school in the band room where Adam Wilde, a popular student and up-and-coming rockstar, peeks in on her playing. This leads him to ask Kim, Mia's best friend, about her. Adam then asks Mia out on a date to a cello recital, where they kiss.\n\nThe story flashes back to the present day, where the family is driving to the grandparents' farm, before their car suddenly collides with an oncoming truck. Mia appears to have an [[out-of-body experience]] where she finds herself barefoot and sees her body lying on the road while paramedics are trying to help her and her family. Mia tries to ask a paramedic what is happening, but realizes that no one can see or hear her. Mia, now in the hospital, panics as she does not know the current status of any of her family members when they take her in for surgery. A sympathetic nurse, Nurse Ramirez, tells Mia\u2014her physical body, not Mia's spirit, which apparently she cannot see either\u2014that it is up to her whether or not she wants to stay.\n\nThe story flashes back once again to Mia attending one of Adam's concerts with his band Willamette Stone, where she does not seem to fit in. Adam's band is steadily gaining more recognition and gets signed to a label, which puts a strain on their relationship due to the travel schedule. While at dinner, Mia's grandpa suggests that she should apply to [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]], an idea which she initially rebuffs, but later further researches. She eventually lands an audition in [[San Francisco]]. It takes a while for Mia to tell Adam about her audition and when she does he becomes upset and leaves for a week-long gig.\n\nIn the present day, Mia undergoes surgery. She sees a doctor speaking with her grandparents who are standing outside of a pediatric room where Teddy lies in a coma-like state. Adam comes to the hospital to see Mia, but is not allowed in as he is not an immediate family member. It is then revealed that Kat was pronounced [[dead on arrival]] and Denny died on the operating table. She later finds out that Teddy has died from an [[epidural hematoma]]. Mia's grandfather George talks to Mia, revealing that when her father heard her playing cello one time, he decided to sacrifice his career knowing that she was talented, so quit his band, sold his drums, and bought her first cello. He also tearfully gives Mia permission to move on from this life if she wants, which influences Mia to decide that she wants to die so that she can join her family on the other side.\n\nThe story flashes back to Mia at her audition for Juilliard, where she plays the best she has ever played, leading her to think that if accepted, she would go. After a reconciliation with Adam, they talk about the huge possibility of her going to Juilliard, which ultimately leads to them breaking up and going their separate ways.\n\nAfter some time, Mia seems stable enough to receive more visitors. Mia is shown symbolically about to let go when she hears the music performed at the cello recital that she attended with Adam. It is revealed that Adam has come to see Mia and that he is playing his [[iPod]] for her. He brings with him a letter Mia has received from Juilliard saying that she has been accepted and lets her know that he would do whatever she wants if she stays. He begins to play the song he has finally written about her. Mia, after flashing back through all the happy moments in her life, squeezes Adam's hand and opens her eyes. She sees Adam looking at her saying, \"Mia!\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as Mia Hall\n* [[Jamie Blackley]] as Adam Wilde\n* [[Mireille Enos]] as Kat Hall\n* [[Joshua Leonard]] as Denny Hall\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as George Hall\n* [[Aisha Hinds]] as Nurse Ramirez\n* [[Lauren Lee Smith]] as Willow\n* [[Liana Liberato]] as Kim Schein\n* [[Aliyah O'Brien]] as EMT\n* Jakob Davies as Teddy Hall\n\n== Production ==\nIn December 2010, it was announced that a film based on the novel ''[[If I Stay]]'' was in the works at [[Summit Entertainment]] and that [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] and [[Emily Browning]] were in talks to play Mia.<ref>{{cite web|first=Amy|last=Wilkinson|url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2010/12/09/if-i-stay-actresses/|title=Dakota Fanning Will Not Star In 'If I Stay'|publisher=Hollywood Crush|date=9 December 2010|access-date=21 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206225232/http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2010/12/09/if-i-stay-actresses/|archive-date=December 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Catherine Hardwicke]] was attached to direct, but was replaced by [[Brazil]]ian filmmaker [[Heitor Dhalia]],<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Justin|last=Kroll|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118026049?refCatId=13|title=Summit asks Dakota Fanning to 'Stay'|magazine=Variety|date=October 20, 2010|access-date=November 21, 2013}}</ref> who also left the film later.
