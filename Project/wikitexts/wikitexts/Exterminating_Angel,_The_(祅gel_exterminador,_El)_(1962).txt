The servants inexplicably begin to leave as the guests are about to arrive and, by the time the meal is over, only Julio, the [[majordomo]], is left. Luc\u00eda cancels a planned surprise involving a bear and three sheep upon discovering that guest Sergio Russell does not like jokes, but there are a few strange occurrences, such as the guests somehow entering the mansion and going upstairs twice, Edmundo repeating his toast to the opera singer Silvia, and Cristi\u00e1n Ugalde and Leandro Gomez greeting each other three times (as strangers, cordially, and antagonistically).\n\nThe guests mingle before adjourning to the salon to listen to Blanca play a [[piano sonata]] by [[Pietro Domenico Paradies|Paradisi]]. When she finishes, she says she is tired, and several other guests indicate they are about to go home, but no one does. Instead, without discussing it, the guests and hosts settle in and spend the night on the couches, chairs, and floor of the salon, preventing Luc\u00eda from sneaking off for a tryst with Colonel Alvaro Aranda, while Julio sleeps at the table in the dining room.\n\nIn the morning, it is discovered that Sergio is unconscious. The hosts and some of the guests wonder why no one attempted to leave the night before. A few guests try to exit the salon, but they all turn back or become distressed and stop before crossing the threshold. When Julio brings some leftovers for breakfast, he is trapped as well.\n\nBy that evening, everyone is on edge. They are using a closet as a toilet and have run out of clean water. Ra\u00fal blames Eduardo for their plight, but Leticia defends the host. Sergio dies during the night, and Dr. Carlos Conde and Alvaro put the corpse in a closet to prevent the sight of it from further worrying their peers.\n\nA crowd of onlookers, police, and soldiers gathers outside the gates of the mansion over the following days and finds no one is able to enter, though there is no physical barrier. The trapped individuals get water by tapping into a pipe in the wall, but their good manners continue to deteriorate. A growing number of them become ill, and Dr. Conde has no medicine, until Edmundo shows him a stash of [[opiate]]s, which some of the guests sneak for themselves.\n\nAt a particularly heated moment, the trapped group sees the three sheep and bear roaming the mansion. The sheep wander into the salon, where they are caught and roasted on a fire in the middle of the room. While the food calms things down somewhat, it does little to raise spirits, and Eduardo and Beatriz, a young engaged couple, kill themselves in a closet.\n\nOne night, all of the N\u00f3biles's\nservants are drawn back to the mansion. Inside, Ra\u00fal has convinced most of the other guests that their predicament will end if Edmundo dies. Dr. Conde attempts to reason with them, and a fight breaks out, the doctor assisted by Alvaro and Julio. Edmundo and Leticia come out of the curtained-off area they have begun to inhabit (Luc\u00eda is now openly with Alvaro), and Edmundo offers to take his own life. He gets a small pistol he had hidden, but Leticia tells him to wait. She says all of the people and furniture are in the same spot as the night of the party, and has Blanca play the end of the piano sonata and everyone repeat the conversation that followed. \n\nThis time, when Blanca says she is tired, the group finds they can leave the salon, and then the mansion. The members of the small crowd outside see them exit and are able to pass through the gates to greet them.\n\nTo give thanks for their salvation, most of the group from the salon attend a [[Te Deum]] service. Afterward, neither the clergy, nor the churchgoers, can leave the cathedral. Some time later, the military fires on a group of people and drives them away from the cathedral gates. A flock of sheep enters the building as the screams and gunshots continue.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- in the same order as the film's credits -->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;The Trapped\n* [[Silvia Pinal]] as Leticia, nicknamed \"La Valkiria\" (\"The [[Valkyrie]]\")\n* [[Jacqueline Andere]] as Alicia de Roc, Alberto's much younger wife\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Baviera]] as Leandro Gomez, who lives in New York\n* [[Augusto Benedico]] as Dr. Carlos Conde\n* [[Luis Berist\u00e1in]] as  Cristi\u00e1n Ugalde, Rita's husband, who has an [[Peptic ulcer disease|ulcer]] and is a [[Freemason]]\n* [[Antonio Bravo]] as Sergio Russell, an older guest who does not like jokes and is the first to die\n* [[Claudio Brook]] as Julio, the [[majordomo]]\n* [[C\u00e9sar del Campo]] as Colonel Alvaro Aranda, who is having an affair with Luc\u00eda\n* Rosa Elena Durgel as Silvia, an opera singer\n* [[Lucy Gallardo]] as Luc\u00eda de N\u00f3bile, Edmundo's wife and the hostess of the party\n* [[Enrique Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez (actor)|Enrique Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez]] as Alberto Roc, Alicia's elderly husband, who is a [[Conducting|conductor]] and a Freemason\n* [[Ofelia Guilm\u00e1in]] as Juana Avila, Francisco's overprotective sister\n* [[Nadia Haro Oliva]] as Ana Maynar, who was once in a train wreck and is interested in [[Kabbalah]]\n* [[Tito Junco (Mexican actor)|Tito Junco]] as Ra\u00fal, who walks with a cane\n* [[:es:Xavier Loy\u00e1|Xavier Loy\u00e1]] as Francisco Avila, Juana's brother\n* Xavier Mass\u00e9 as Eduardo, Beatriz's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Ofelia Montesco]] as Beatriz, Eduardo's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[:es:Patricia Mor\u00e1n|Patricia Mor\u00e1n]] as Rita Ugalde, Christian's wife, who is pregnant\n* Patricia de Morelos as Blanca, a pianist\n* [[Bertha Moss]] as Leonora, a woman who has cancer and is Dr. Conde's patient\n* [[Enrique Rambal]] as Edmundo N\u00f3bile, Luc\u00eda's husband and the host of the party\n{{col-2}}\n[[File:Rita Macedo en el \u00c1ngel Exterminador (1962).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rita Macedo]] in a publicity photograph for the film]]\n;The Rest\n* [[Pancho C\u00f3rdova]] as Lucas, the [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]], who is the first servant to leave\n* \u00c1ngel Merino as the waiter who trips and drops a tray of food\n* Luis Lomel\u00ed as the mayor's representative\n* Guillermo \u00c1lvarez Bianchi as Pablo, the chef\n* Elodia Hern\u00e1ndez as Camila, the older maid\n* [[Florencio Castell\u00f3]] as the bald waiter\n* [[Eric del Castillo]] as Deacon Sampson, who tutors and cares for the Ugalde children and takes part in the [[Te Deum]] service at the end of the film\n* Chel L\u00f3pez as the military official who tells the mayor's representative that his men were unable to enter the mansion\n* David Hayat (credited as David Hayyad Cohen) as Pablo's [[sous-chef]]\n* [[Janet Alcoriza]] as the younger maid (uncredited)\n* Roberto Meyer as the \"crazy\" onlooker who is not allowed to try to get inside the mansion (uncredited)\n* [[Rita Macedo]] as a churchgoer (uncredited)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe, visit to Mexico in 1962.jpg|thumb|(from left to right) [[Ofelia Montesco]], [[:es:Xavier Loy\u00e1|Xavier Loy\u00e1]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], unknown person in the back, [[:es:Patricia Mor\u00e1n|Patricia Mor\u00e1n]], [[Bertha Moss]], [[Nadia Haro Oliva]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Baviera]] on the set of the film]]\nThe film was shot in less than six weeks, from January 29 to March 9, 1962.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tiempo Y Narraci\u00f3n En \"el \u00e1ngel Exterminador\"  |trans-title= Time And Narration In \"The Exterminating Angel\" |url=https://xdoc.mx/documents/tiempo-y-narracion-en-el-angel-exterminador-e-5f1b4756ddd28 |quote=Efectivamente, el tiempo de realizaci\u00f3n fue escaso para una pel\u00edcula como esta que se rod\u00f3 en a penas dos meses, del 29 de enero al 9 de marzo de 1962 (54 d\u00edas).

Having set a banquet table for themselves by defeating the workers in the [[Spanish Civil War]], they sit down for a feast, only to find it never ends. They're trapped in their own bourgeois cul-de-sac. Increasingly resentful at being shut off from the world outside, they grow mean and restless; their worst tendencies are revealed.\"<ref name=\"ebert2\">[[Roger Ebert]], [https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-exterminating-angel-1962 ''The Exterminating Angel''], ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'', 11 May 1997.</ref>\n\nScholar [[Robert Stam]] said in his book ''Reflexivity in Film and Literature: From Don Quixote to Jean-Luc Godard'' that the film \"is structured on the comic formula of a slow descent from normality into anarchy&nbsp;... The 'Exterminating Angel' executes a mission of social justice, an apocalyptic laying low of the noble and the powerful.\"{{sfn|Stam|1992|p=185}}\n\n===Influence on the horror genre===\nIn a piece on the [[horror film]] website ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'', Samuel Pierce noted parallels between ''The Exterminating Angel'' and the contemporary horror film, writing: \"Within the film's already fascinating plot, there's plenty of poignant social commentary that will be just as familiar to horror fans. Though the film can be interpreted a number of ways, many of its themes are undeniable and as relevant today as they ever were. We see isolation drive madness. We see tribes form in times of strife. We see murder become more and more appealing. More than anything, however, ''The Exterminating Angel'' explores the hypocrisy of the social elite and the thin strands of society that keep them from utter depravity.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Pierce |first=Samuel |date=28 May 2020 |title=Luis Bu\u00f1uel's 'The Exterminating Angel' and its Ties to Modern Horror |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3618418/luis-bunuels-exterminating-angel-ties-modern-horror/ |access-date=21 August 2021 |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]}}</ref>\n\nRather than a precursor to many contemporary horror films, some critics have classified ''The Exterminating Angel'' as a horror film itself.

Initially, the characters seems to be psychologically unable to leave, but later they desire to leave and physically cannot due to a spell.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* In the 2011 [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'', the main character, Gil, travels back in time to 1920s Paris and suggests a story to a perplexed young Luis Bu\u00f1uel about guests who arrive for a dinner party and can\u2019t leave.
