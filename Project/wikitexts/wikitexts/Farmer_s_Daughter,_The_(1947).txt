It stars [[Loretta Young]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Ethel Barrymore]], and [[Charles Bickford]], and was adapted by [[Allen Rivkin]] and Laura Kerr from the 1937 Finnish play ''Juurakon Hulda'' by [[Hella Wuolijoki]], using the pen name Juhani Tervap\u00e4\u00e4 (misspelled in the film's credits as Juhni Tervataa).  It was directed by [[H.C. Potter]].\n\nThe film won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for [[Loretta Young]] and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] for [[Charles Bickford]]. Young's win was considered an upset; everyone had expected [[Rosalind Russell]] to win for her Lavinia in ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra (film)|Mourning Becomes Electra]]''.\n\nIn 1963, a [[The Farmer's Daughter (TV series)|television series based on the film]] was produced, starring [[Inger Stevens]], [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] and [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]].\n\n==Plot==\nSwedish-American Katie Holstrom ([[Loretta Young]]) leaves the family farm to attend nursing school in Capitol City.  Barn painter Adolph Petree ([[Rhys Williams (Welsh-American actor)|Rhys Williams]]), who completed a job for Katie's father, offers her a ride, then steals her money along the way. Katie, refusing to ask her family for help, goes to work as a maid for political power broker Agatha Morley ([[Ethel Barrymore]]) and her son, U.S. Representative Glenn Morley ([[Joseph Cotten]]). She impresses Agatha and her loyal butler Joseph Clancey ([[Charles Bickford]]) with her refreshing, down-to-earth common sense. Glenn is impressed with her other charms.\n\nUnexpected problems arise when the Morleys and the other leaders of their political party have to select a replacement for a deceased congressman; they choose the unscrupulous Anders J. Finley ([[Art Baker (actor)|Art Baker]]). Knowing the man's true background, Katie strongly disapproves. At a public meeting to introduce Finley, Katie asks him pointed and embarrassing questions. Leaders of the opposition party are impressed and offer to back Katie in the coming election. Katie accepts and reluctantly quits her job, much to Glenn's disappointment.\n\nWhen Katie's campaign gains support (with some coaching from Glenn), Finley smears her reputation by bribing Petree to claim Katie spent the night with him when he gave her a ride. Katie, distraught, runs home. When Glenn learns the truth, he follows her and proposes.\n\nAgatha and Joseph get Finley drunk and he reveals he is a member of an extreme nativist political group <ref>(Per the actual movie)</ref> and that he bribed Petree, who is hidden away at his isolated lodge, to disparage Katie's reputation. Assisted by Katie's three burly brothers ([[James Arness]], [[Lex Barker]], [[Keith Andes]]), Glenn retrieves Petree from his goon guards, then forces him to confess over the radio. Agatha withdraws her party's support for Finley and endorses Katie, ensuring her election. In the final scene, Glenn carries Katie across the threshold of the [[United States House of Representatives]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Loretta Young]] as Katie Holstrom\n*[[Joseph Cotten]] as Glenn Morley \n*[[Ethel Barrymore]] as Agatha Morley \n*[[Charles Bickford]] as Joseph Clancy \n*[[Rose Hobart]] as Virginia Thatcher \n*[[Rhys Williams (Welsh actor)|Rhys Williams]] as Adolph Petree \n*[[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as Dr. Matthew Sulven \n*[[Tom Powers]] as Hy Nordick \n*[[William Harrigan]] as Ward Hughes \n*[[Lex Barker]] as Olaf Holstrom \n*[[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]] as Mr. Holstrom \n*[[Keith Andes]] as Sven Holstrom \n*[[Thurston Hall]] as Wilbur Johnson \n*[[Art Baker (actor)|Art Baker]] as Anders J.
