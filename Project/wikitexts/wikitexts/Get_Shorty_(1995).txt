Based on [[Elmore Leonard]]'s [[Get Shorty|novel of the same name]], the film stars [[John Travolta]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Delroy Lindo]], [[James Gandolfini]], [[Dennis Farina]], and [[Danny DeVito]]. The film follows Chili Palmer (Travolta), a Miami mobster and loan shark, who inadvertently gets involved in Hollywood feature film production.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Be Cool]]'', which was also based on an Elmore Leonard novel, was released in 2005. In 2017, ''Get Shorty'' inspired a [[Get Shorty (TV series)|television series of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\nErnesto \"Chili\" Palmer is a [[Miami]] [[loan shark]] and movie buff. When his jacket is taken by rival mobster Ray \"Bones\" Barboni, Chili retrieves it and breaks Bones' nose. A vengeful Bones ambushes him at his office, but Chili shoots first, grazing Bones' forehead. Bones' boss refuses to retaliate, reminding him that Chili is under the protection of [[Brooklyn]] mob boss Momo.\n\nAfter Momo dies of a heart attack, Bones takes over his operation and demands that Chili collect an outstanding debt from Leo Devoe, a dry cleaner who died in a plane crash. Chili learns from Leo's wife Faye that Leo is alive, having left the plane before takeoff; he was presumed dead when Faye identified his belongings in the crash, and she received $300,000 in life insurance, but Leo ran away with the cash. Chili tracks Leo to a [[Las Vegas]] casino, and the director of gaming asks him to collect a debt from [[B movie]] director Harry Zimm.\n\nSurprising Harry in [[Los Angeles]] at the home of [[scream queen]] Karen Flores, Chili pitches him the story of chasing the dry cleaner\u2019s mob debt as an idea for a movie. Harry persuades Chili to help him placate his investor Bo Catlett, owner of a limo service that serves as a [[front organization|drug front]]. Having gambled away Bo's $200,000 investment, Harry shows him the script he really wants to make, ''Mr. Lovejoy'', but the screenwriter's widow Doris controls the rights. Chili confronts Leo and takes his money to invest in the film, deciding to become a Hollywood producer, and rejects Bo's suggestion that they collaborate.\n\nBo has left $500,000 in a locker at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] for his [[Illegal drug trade in Colombia|Colombian contacts]] to collect. The cartel sends Yayo, who refuses to retrieve the money with the [[DEA]] watching. At Bo's cliffside home, Yayo threatens to inform on Bo if he is arrested with the cash; Bo shoots Yayo, knocking him over the deck railing, and plans to eliminate Chili in a similar fashion. He is later visited by Colombian druglord Mr. Escobar, who demands his money and his nephew, Yayo.\n\nWarming to Chili, Karen also wants to become a producer and arranges a meeting with Hollywood star Martin Weir, her ex-husband. Interested in ''Mr. Lovejoy'', Martin is also intrigued by Chili's own pitch and in playing the role of Chili himself. Making Harry jealous of Chili and Karen's partnership, Bo offers him the locker money as a new investment, suggesting he send Chili to fetch it. Sensing a trap, Chili rents a nearby locker instead and is briefly interrogated by the DEA. Bo's henchman Bear demands the locker key back, but Chili subdues him, and they bond over Bear's former career as a stuntman.\n\nAfter being seduced by Doris, Harry drunkenly calls Bones and tells him that Chili has Leo's money. Having already questioned Faye, Bones flies to Los Angeles and brutally beats Harry, demanding the money. They are interrupted by Bo's associate Ronnie, whom Bones shoots dead and frames Harry. Bear has a change of heart about the plan to kill Chili, but Bo threatens him and his young daughter. Chili and Karen give in to their mutual attraction, and take a badly injured Harry to meet with Martin.\n\nDesperate to pay the Colombians, Bo demands Leo's money from Chili and kidnaps Karen. Chili delivers the money, but Bo and Bear prepare to kill him; in the scuffle, Bo falls through the deck railing to his death, as arranged by Bear, who saves Chili. At Chili's hotel room, Bones demands Leo's money at gunpoint. Chili sends him to the airport locker, where Bones is surrounded by DEA agents.\n\nSome time later, ''Get Shorty'' \u2014 the movie version of Chili's story \u2014 is being filmed, produced by Chili and Karen, directed by Harry, starring Martin as Chili and [[Harvey Keitel]] as Bones, with Bear as stunt supervisor. When Martin's prop gun fails, Harry halts filming for the day, to Doris' displeasure. Chili and Karen depart the studio lot, officially Hollywood producers.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Names are in credits order and named as credited; DO NOT CHANGE. -->\n<!-- Cast per opening credits order. -->\n* [[John Travolta]] as Chili Palmer: <br /> A Miami mobster, loan shark, and film buff who gets involved in the film industry.\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Harry Zimm: <br /> A debt-ridden [[B movie]] film director and producer.\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Karen Flores: <br /> A B movie scream queen actress dissatisfied with her career.
