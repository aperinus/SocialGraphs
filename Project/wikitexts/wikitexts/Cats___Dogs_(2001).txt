It stars [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Elizabeth Perkins]] and [[Alexander Pollock]], with the voices of (among others) [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Jon Lovitz]], [[Joe Pantoliano]] and [[Michael Clarke Duncan]]. The story centers on the relationships between cats and dogs, depicting the relationship as an intense rivalry in which both sides use organizations and tactics that mirror those used in human [[espionage]]. It was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on July 4, 2001. The film received mixed reviews and earned $200.7 million on a $60 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[MOS:FILM]], film plots should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nThe Brody family's pet [[Bloodhound]] Buddy chases a [[cat]] and is captured by other cats in an ambush. Cats and [[dogs]] are revealed to be highly intelligent, tech-savvy enemies capable of speech, waging war with covert operatives while concealing their true nature from humans. After an [[Anatolian Shepherd]] dog named Butch reports Buddy's capture to his superiors, the best canine agents are dispatched to complete Buddy's mission: to prevent the cats from making all humans allergic to dogs.\n\nAt a local barn, a litter of [[Beagle]] puppies mock their youngest brother for trying to escape captivity. A [[Doberman Pinscher]] agent replaces the litter with a pack of [[Miniature Pinscher]] agents, failing to notice the youngest Beagle. Carolyn, the Brodys\u2019 matriarch, arrives to adopt a new dog and selects the Beagle, naming him Lou after her son Scotty sarcastically suggests the name \"Loser\".\n\nAfter detonating an explosive trap laid by cats for Lou, Butch \u2013 mistaking him for a trained operative \u2013 brings him to the dogs\u2019 underground network, and introduces agents Peek, a [[Chinese Crested Dog]], and Sam, an [[Old English Sheepdog]]. Realizing Lou is a civilian, Butch raises his concerns to his superiors but is rebuffed. Lou is briefed on the origins of the conflict between cats and dogs, dating back to [[Ancient Egypt]] when cats ruled the world. Butch reveals that Buddy has escaped the cats and the spy trade, retiring to a [[condominium|condo]] in [[Boca Raton]].\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Tinkles, a white [[Persian cat]], plans to exploit the Brodys\u2019 patriarch Professor Charles\u2019 research on dog allergies to conquer the world. His scheming is interrupted by Sophie, his comatose owner's maid, who enjoys dressing Tinkles in embarrassing costumes. Tinkles orders his sidekick Calico, an [[Exotic Shorthair]], to send [[Devon Rex]] [[ninja]]s to steal the research. Lou foils the theft and meets a former agent and Butch's ex-girlfriend Ivy, a [[Saluki]] who encourages him to bond with Scotty.\n\nMr. Tinkles contracts a [[Russian Blue]] mercenary named Dimitri Kennelkoff, who tricks Lou and places a bomb on Brody's lab door. Kennelkoff battles Lou and Butch, damaging the Brodys\u2019 house until Butch disables the bomb and captures Kennelkoff. During the interrogation, the dogs recover a note by Mr. Tinkles from Kennelkoff's stomach.\n\nAfter a breakthrough involving Lou playing with Scotty, Charles' machine finally finds the formula to a cure for human allergies to dogs. Having bugged the house, Mr. Tinkles and Calico spring a trap for the Brodys. First, Mr. Tinkles travels to a [[Christmas tree]] flocking plant under the guise of the plant's comatose owner, Mr. Mason, and sends the employees home, then lures the Brodys with fake tickets to a soccer exhibition game, capturing the family.\n\nThe dogs receive a video from Mr. Tinkles demanding Charles\u2019 research as a ransom for the Brodys, and dogs around the world assemble at a meeting, led by a [[Mastiff]]. When the assembly decides not to surrender the formula, Lou confronts Butch. Revealing that he was abandoned by his owner, the unsympathetic Butch leaves Lou behind. Desperate, Lou brings Mr. Tinkles the research and is double-crossed. Butch, realizing what has happened, stages a raid of Mr. Tinkles' factory where [[Mouse|mice]] are being prepared to spread the mass-produced allergy.\n\nWhile Butch, Ivy, Peek, and Sam fight Tinkles' cat forces, Lou frees the Brodys and Calico, who was betrayed by Tinkles, revealing to the family that he can speak. Lou defeats Tinkles but is struck by an excavator as an explosion destroys the whole factory. Butch rescues the seemingly dead Lou, tearfully admitting that Lou was right to love his adoptive family, and Lou awakens. He decides to return to a normal pet's life with the Brodys until he can serve as a full-grown agent.\n\nMeanwhile, Tinkles is sent to live with Sophie and her three sisters, with even more humiliating outfits as punishment for his actions against the dogs.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Professor Charles Brody\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Mrs. Carolyn Brody\n* [[Alexander Pollock]] as Scotty Brody\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Sophie the Maid\n\n=== Voice cast ===\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as Louis \"Lou\" Brody: a [[Beagle]], who lives with the Brody family.\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Butch: An [[Anatolian Shepherd]], an experienced field agent, and Lou's mentor.\n* [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]] as Mr. Tinkles: A [[Persian cat]]; the leader of the cat agents, who seeks to defeat all dogs and rule the world.\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Ivy: A [[Saluki]]; \"domestically challenged\" former-dog agent who has a history with Butch.
