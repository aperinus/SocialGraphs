The first installment in the [[Hotel Transylvania|''Hotel Transylvania'' franchise]], it was directed by [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] (in his theatrical feature [[directorial debut]]) from a screenplay by [[Peter Baynham]] and [[Robert Smigel]] and a story by [[Todd Durham]], [[Dan Hageman]], and [[Kevin Hageman]]. The film stars the voices of [[Adam Sandler]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Kevin James]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Molly Shannon]], [[David Spade]] and [[CeeLo Green]].\n\nThe film tells the story of [[Count Dracula]], the owner of the titular Hotel Transylvania where the world's monsters can take a rest from human civilization. Dracula invites some of the most famous monsters to celebrate the 118th birthday of his beloved daughter Mavis. When the \"human-free hotel\" is unexpectedly visited by an ordinary 21-year-old traveler named Jonathan, Drac must do everything in his power to prevent Mavis from falling in love with him before the hotel's guests learn a human is in the castle, which may jeopardize the hotel's future and his career.\n\n''Hotel Transylvania'' was released on September 28, 2012 by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was positively welcomed from audiences and it earned a total of $358 million worldwide at the box office against a budget of $85 million and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]]. The financial success of ''Hotel Transylvania'' launched a multimedia franchise and a series of three sequels, starting with ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]'' (2015).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1895, after his wife Martha was killed by an angry human mob, [[Count Dracula]] commissions and builds a massive monsters-only hotel in [[Transylvania]], in which he raises his daughter, [[Hotel Transylvania characters#Mavis|Mavis]]. The hotel also serves as a safe haven and a getaway for the world's monsters from fear of human persecution. Famous monsters such as [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]] and his wife [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Eunice]], Wayne and Wanda [[Werewolf]] and [[Pack (canine)|their massive immediate family]], [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Griffin the Invisible Man]], and Murray the [[Mummy (undead)|Mummy]] often come to stay at the hotel.\n\nIn the present-day (2012), on Mavis' 118th birthday, Dracula allows his daughter to leave the castle to explore the human world, but he sets up an [[Potemkin village|elaborate plan]] using his [[zombie]] [[bellhop]]s disguised as humans to make them seem intimidating, and frighten her home. The plan works, but the zombies inadvertently lead a 21-year-old<ref name=\"Deadline1\" /> human Jonathan \"Johnny\" Loughran back to the hotel. Drac frantically disguises him as a Frankensteinesque monster and passes him off as Frank's cousin \"Johnnystein\". Jonathan soon encounters Mavis and [[Love at first sight|the two \"Zing\"]]. Unable to get Johnny out of the hotel without notice, Drac quickly improvises that Johnny is a party planner, brought in to bring a fresher approach to his own traditional and boring parties. Johnny quickly becomes a hit to the other monsters, but this worries Drac, who is both jealous of Johnny's popularity and afraid that his friends will never return to the hotel if they find out about the lie. Drac orders Johnny to leave, but he is brought back by Mavis, who is unaware of Johnny's real species and feud with her father. After being shown the beauty of a [[sunrise]] by Johnny, Mavis is inspired to give humans another chance.\n\nMeanwhile, the hotel chef [[Quasimodo]], with the help of his pet rat [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda]], learns that Johnny is a human and kidnaps him to cook him. Drac intervenes and magically freezes Quasimodo to keep him from telling anyone that Johnny is human. Drac leads Johnny to his quarters and shows him a painting of Martha, allowing Johnny to realize why Drac built the hotel and became overprotective of Mavis. Johnny then agrees to leave for good, but Drac, noticing that Mavis and Johnny's feelings for each other are real, persuades him to stay for the time being to avoid ruining Mavis's birthday. Drac and Johnny begin to bond and have fun together.\n\nThe party is a great success the next night, and Mavis looks forward to opening a gift from Martha. However, when Johnny and Mavis share their first kiss, Drac overreacts, and in his outburst, inadvertently confesses to deceiving Mavis with the town. A still-frozen Quasimodo bursts in and [[The Fly (George Langelaan)|Mr. Fly]] reveals from his frozen speech that Johnny is a human disguised by Drac. The guests are shocked and outraged by the deceit at play, but Mavis is undeterred and wants to be with Johnny. Johnny feigns uninterest in Mavis and rejects her out of respect for her father and leaves the hotel.\n\nA heartbroken Mavis flies onto the roof with her mother's gift, and Drac follows her in hopes of comforting her. He learns the present is a book about how Drac and Martha \"Zinged\" and fell in love. Drac realizes he no longer knows humankind's true tolerance of monsters. After apologizing to the patrons, Drac persuades Frank, Wayne, Griffin, and Murray to head out into the human world to help him find Johnny, and with the scent-tracking ability of Wayne's daughter, Winnie, they learn that he is about to catch a flight back to the United States.\n\nThe four head to the airport, but are held up in a town celebrating a Monster Festival along the way.  Frankenstein attempts to scare away the assembled crowd of humans with a loud roar but instead receives wild applause and adoration. He then gets the humans to agree to help, and a team of men dressed as vampires provides Drac shelter from the sunlight while he rushes to the airport. Drac arrives to see Johnny's plane taking off, and he gives chase in bat form, burning in the sunlight. After getting Johnny's attention, Drac makes his way to the windshield of the plane and uses his mind-controlling power on the pilot to help him apologize, stating that Mavis has grown up and can make her own decisions. Johnny accepts his apology, and Drac manipulates the pilot to return to the Transylvanian airport.\n\nDrac returns Johnny to Mavis, announcing that he approves of Johnny. Johnny confesses to Mavis that their \"Zing\" was mutual and the two kiss. The monsters finish celebrating Mavis' party, impressing the hotel guests.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Hotel Transylvania characters}}\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as [[Count Dracula|Count \"Drac\" Dracula]]: a [[vampire]] and the owner of the hotel and Mavis' overprotective father.\n* [[Andy Samberg]] as Jonathan \"Johnny\" Loughran: Mavis' love interest.\n* [[Selena Gomez]] as Mavis Dracula: daughter of Count Dracula and late Martha and Jonathan's love interest.\n** Sadie Sandler as young Mavis Dracula.\n* [[Kevin James]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]: one of Count Dracula's best friends who acts as an uncle to Mavis and mostly hangs out with Murray.\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Wayne: a male [[werewolf]] who is one of Count Dracula's best friends and Wanda's husband.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" />\n* [[CeeLo Green]] as Murray: a short, fat [[Mummy (undead)|mummy]] who is one of Count Dracula's best friends and mostly hangs out with Frankenstein.<ref name=entertainment /> He is later voiced by [[Keegan-Michael Key]] in the next three films.\n* [[Fran Drescher]] as [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Eunice]]: Frankenstein's wife and Wanda's best friend.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" />\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Wanda: a female werewolf, Wayne's heavily pregnant wife and Eunice's best friend.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" />\n* [[David Spade]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Griffin the Invisible Man]]: one of Count Dracula's best friends.<ref name=entertainment />\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as [[Quasimodo]] Wilson: a hunchbacked gourmet [[chef]] and the former [[bell-ringer]] [[Notre-Dame de Paris|of Notre Dame]] who desires to make a dish with human as the main ingredient.<ref name=\"Deadline1\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Lovitz|first=Jon|title=Here's a picture of my character,...|url=https://www.twitter.com/realjonlovitz/status/207914408364613633/photo/1|access-date=May 30, 2012|newspaper=Twitter|date=May 30, 2012|quote=Here's a picture of my character, Quasimodo the Chef, from Adam Sandler's \"Hotel Transylvania\"}}</ref>\n* Sadie Sandler as Winnie, Wayne and Wanda's werewolf daughter.\n* [[Jim Wise]] and [[Luenell]] as the [[shrunken head]]s that serve as a [[Door hanger|\"Do Not Disturb\" sign]] on the door of Mavis's room.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Luenell |author-link=Luenell |user=Luenell |number=187217148211507200 |date=April 4, 2012 |title=My 2nd movie w/Adam Sandler, \"Hotel Transylvania\"!
