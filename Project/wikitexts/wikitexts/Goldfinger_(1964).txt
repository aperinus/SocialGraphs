It is based on the 1959 [[Goldfinger (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. The film also stars [[Honor Blackman]] as [[Bond girl]] [[Pussy Galore]] and [[Gert Fr\u00f6be]] as the title character [[Auric Goldfinger]], along with [[Shirley Eaton]] as the iconic Bond girl Jill Masterson. ''Goldfinger'' was produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] and was the first of four Bond films directed by [[Guy Hamilton]].\n\nThe film's plot has Bond investigating gold smuggling by gold magnate Auric Goldfinger and eventually uncovering Goldfinger's plans to contaminate the [[United States Bullion Depository]] at [[Fort Knox]]. ''Goldfinger'' was the first Bond [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], with a budget equal to that of the two preceding films combined. Principal photography took place from\nJanuary to July 1964 in the United Kingdom, [[Switzerland]] and the United States.\n\n''Goldfinger'' was heralded as the film in the franchise where James Bond \"comes into focus\". Its release led to a number of promotional licensed\ntie-in items, including a toy [[Aston Martin DB5]] car from [[Corgi Classics Limited|Corgi Toys]] which became the biggest selling toy of 1964. The promotion also included an image of gold-painted Eaton on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''.\n\nMany of the elements introduced in the film appeared in many of the later James Bond films, such as the extensive use of technology and gadgets by Bond, an extensive pre-credits sequence that stood largely alone from the main storyline, multiple foreign locales and [[tongue-in-cheek]] humor. ''Goldfinger'' was the first Bond film to win an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] (for [[Best Sound Editing]]) and opened to largely favorable critical reception. The film was a financial success, recouping its budget in two weeks and grossing over $120 million worldwide.\n\nIn 1999, it was ranked No. 70 on the [[BFI Top 100 British films]] list compiled by the [[British Film Institute]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:An UH-1 Iroquois helicopter flies over the US Gold Bullion Depository.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository at Fort Knox]]\nAfter destroying a [[clandestine chemistry|drug laboratory]] in [[Latin America]], [[MI6]] agent James Bond vacations in [[Miami Beach]]. His superior, [[M (James Bond)|M]], via CIA agent [[Felix Leiter]], directs Bond to observe bullion dealer [[Auric Goldfinger]] at the hotel there. Bond discovers Goldfinger cheating at a high-stakes [[gin rummy]] game, aided remotely by his employee, Jill Masterson. Bond interrupts Jill and [[blackmail]]s Goldfinger into losing. After a night with Jill, Bond is knocked out by Goldfinger's Korean manservant [[Oddjob]]. Bond awakens to find Jill covered in gold paint, dead from \"skin suffocation\".\n\nIn [[London]], the [[governor of the Bank of England]] and M task Bond with determining how Goldfinger [[arbitrage|smuggles gold internationally]]. [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] supplies Bond with a modified [[Aston Martin DB5]] and two tracking devices. Bond meets Goldfinger at his country club in [[Kent]] and plays a round of [[golf]] with him, wagering a bar of recovered [[Nazi gold]]. Goldfinger attempts to cheat, but Bond tricks him into losing the match. Goldfinger warns Bond against interfering in his affairs, and Oddjob demonstrates his formidable strength. Bond trails Goldfinger to [[Switzerland]], where he meets Jill's sister, Tilly, who attempts and fails to assassinate Goldfinger. Bond sneaks into Goldfinger's refinery and overhears him telling a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] nuclear physicist, Ling, that he incorporates gold into the bodywork of his [[Rolls-Royce Phantom III]] to smuggle out of England. \n\nBond also overhears Goldfinger mention \"Operation Grand Slam\", and encounters Tilly, who again tries to kill Goldfinger. An alarm is tripped and Oddjob kills Tilly with his lethal [[Oddjob's hat|steel-rimmed hat]]. Bond is captured and strapped to a table with an overhead industrial [[laser]], the beam slicing toward him. Bond lies to Goldfinger that MI6 knows about Operation Grand Slam. Goldfinger spares Bond's life so that MI6 can think he is safe. Pilot [[Pussy Galore]] flies the captive Bond to Goldfinger's [[stud farm]] near [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] in a private jet. Once there, Bond escapes his cell and witnesses Goldfinger's meeting with [[American Mafia|American mafiosi]], who are supplying materials for Operation Grand Slam. Goldfinger plans to breach the [[United States Bullion Depository|U.S. Bullion Depository]] at [[Fort Knox]] by releasing delta-9 nerve gas into the atmosphere, killing the personnel. \n\nThe mobsters ridicule Goldfinger's scheme, particularly a Mr. Solo who demands to be paid immediately before the others are gassed to death by Goldfinger. Bond is captured by Pussy Galore, but attempts to alert the CIA by planting his homing device in Solo's pocket as he leaves. Unfortunately, Solo is killed by Oddjob and his body destroyed in a [[car crusher]] along with the homing device. Bond confronts Goldfinger over the logistical implausibility of [[Goldfinger (novel)#Adaptations|moving the gold]]. As Goldfinger denies an intent to steal it, Bond deduces from the presence of Mr. Ling that Goldfinger has been offered a [[dirty bomb]] by the Chinese government, to detonate inside the vault to [[irradiate]] the gold for decades. Goldfinger's own gold will increase in value and the Chinese gain an advantage from the economic chaos. \n\nBond pretends to Goldfinger the plan is brilliant (though later tells Pussy that Goldfinger is insane). Goldfinger warns that any attempt to interfere will result in the bomb being detonated at another vital U.S. location. Operation Grand Slam launches with Pussy Galore's Flying Circus spraying gas over Fort Knox, seemingly killing the military guards and government personnel. Goldfinger's private army breaks into Fort Knox and accesses the vault as Goldfinger arrives in a helicopter with the bomb. In the vault, Goldfinger's henchman, Kisch, handcuffs Bond to the bomb. Unbeknownst to Goldfinger and to Bond, Bond's earlier conversation with Pussy has convinced her to alert the American authorities. The nerve gas has been replaced with a harmless substance. Goldfinger locks the vault with Bond, Oddjob, and Kisch trapped inside. \n\nWhen the U.S. army begin their attack, Goldfinger kills nuclear expert Ling in a ruse and escapes. Kisch attempts to disarm the bomb but Oddjob throws him to his death. Bond frees himself with Kisch's key, but Oddjob batters him before he can stop the bomb. Bond electrocutes Oddjob to death, then forces the lock off the bomb but is unsure how to disarm it. After killing Goldfinger's men, U.S. troops open the vault. An atomic specialist rushes in and turns off the device with seven seconds left. En route with Pussy, Bond is flown to the [[White House]] for lunch with the president, but Goldfinger hijacks the plane. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, the gun discharges and creates an [[Uncontrolled decompression#Explosive decompression|explosive decompression]] that blows Goldfinger through the ruptured window. Bond and Pussy parachute safely from the aircraft before it crashes. Leiter's search helicopter passes over the pair, who have landed in a wood. Bond declares: \"this is no time to be rescued\", and draws the parachute over himself and Galore.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] (007): An MI6 agent who is sent to investigate Auric Goldfinger. Connery reprised the role of Bond for the third time in a row. His salary rose, but a pay dispute later broke out during filming. After he suffered a back injury when filming the scene where Oddjob knocks Bond unconscious in Miami, the dispute was settled: Eon and Connery agreed to a deal where the actor would receive 5% of the gross of each Bond film he starred in.<ref name=mi6production/>\n* [[Honor Blackman]] as [[Pussy Galore]]: Goldfinger's personal pilot and leader of an all-female team of pilots known as Pussy Galore's Flying Circus.
