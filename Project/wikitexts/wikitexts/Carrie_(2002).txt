It is the second film adaptation and a [[Remake|re-imagining]] of the novel, and the third film in the [[Adaptations of Carrie|''Carrie'' franchise]]. The film was written by [[Bryan Fuller]], directed by [[David Carson (director)|David Carson]], and stars [[Angela Bettis]] in the leading role. In the story, Carrie White, a shy girl who is harassed by her schoolmates, disappears and a series of [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s reveal what has happened to her.\n\n''Carrie'' was produced by [[Pen Densham|Trilogy Entertainment Group]] and [[MGM Television]] at the request of television network [[NBC]]. Filmed in [[Vancouver]], it was commissioned as a stand-alone feature by the network but the studios intended it as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a potential television series. The ending of the novel was changed accordingly, but no follow-up series was ever produced.\n\nThe film premiered on NBC on November 4, 2002, when it was viewed by 12.21 million people. Despite the good ratings and two award nominations (a [[Saturn Award]] and [[American Society of Cinematographers Award|ASC Award]]), the film was poorly received by film critics. The performances, especially Bettis', were praised, but the film was criticized for its poor special effects, lack of a horror atmosphere, and long runtime.\n\n== Plot ==\nPolice interview several people, including high school student [[Sue Snell]] and gym teacher [[Rita Desjardin|Miss Desjarden]]. Detective John Mulcahey is currently investigating the disappearance of a high school student and suspect of arson, [[Carrie White]]. These interviews [[Flashback (narrative)|reveal the preceding events]].\n\nOne week before the prom at Ewen High School, Carrie is a shy girl who is bullied by the popular girls, most notably Chris Hargensen and Tina Blake. When Carrie has her [[menarche|first period]] in the shower, the girls taunt her until Ms. Desjarden intervenes and comforts Carrie. Principal Morton decides to send Carrie home but addresses her by the wrong name. An infuriated Carrie yells out, causing Morton's desk to move several inches. Making her way home, Carrie is accosted by a boy on a bicycle, whose joke goes wrong when he inexplicably flies off his bike and crashes into a tree. On arrival at her house, Carrie has a flashback of her childhood. Her fanatically religious mother, [[Margaret White (Carrie)|Margaret White]], who considers menstruation a sign of sexual sin, locks Carrie in her \"prayer closet\" as punishment.\n\nThe next day, Ms. Desjarden gives the girls a week's detention for their bullying of Carrie. If any of them plans on skipping detention, they will be suspended and therefore banned from the prom. Chris is the only one who refuses to do so, so she is banned from prom. After Chris' father, John Hargensen, a lawyer, unsuccessfully attempts to rescind the ban, she enlists her boyfriend, Billy Nolan, to get revenge on Carrie. Meanwhile, Carrie discovers she has [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], the ability to move objects with her mind. After a telekinetic episode in class, Carrie goes home and practices her talent. Sue, who feels sorry for tormenting Carrie, hires her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the prom. With some trepidation, Carrie agrees. When she tells her mother about the prom invitation, Margaret forbids her to go. At last, Carrie is provoked into using her powers to confront her mother and Margaret seemingly gives in.\n\nOn the day of the prom, Tina switches the prom ballots so that Carrie and Tommy are elected the Prom King and Queen. As Tommy and Carrie take their place onstage, Chris, who has been hiding in the rafters with Billy, pulls a rope, causing a wave of pig blood to fall onto Carrie. Chris releases the rope and the bucket falls on Tommy's head, killing him. Carrie goes into a [[Acute stress reaction|shock]]-induced trance and locks everyone inside the gym, killing them all, except for a few students who escape through a vent with Ms. Desjarden. Carrie then leaves the burning school to walk home, unleashing a wave of destruction throughout the town. When Chris and Billy see Carrie walking, Billy tries to run her down but Carrie tosses their truck into a pole, killing them.\n\nWhen Carrie arrives home, she gets into a bathtub, where she finally snaps back to herself but cannot remember what has just happened. Margaret comes into the bathroom to deem her daughter a witch for destroying the town and then attempts to drown her in the tub. With her last ounce of strength, Carrie stops her mother's heart. Sue finds Carrie and manages to revive her by administering [[Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|two breaths]]. At Sue's suggestion, Carrie fakes her own death and Sue sneaks her out of town to Florida. As the two drive off, Carrie has a nightmarish vision of her mother. When she wakes up, she hallucinates Chris lunging at her. Noticing this, Sue asks her if she wants to stop for a moment, but Carrie tells her to keep driving.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Angela Bettis]] as [[Carrie White]]\n** [[Jodelle Ferland]] as Little Carrie White\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as [[Margaret White (Carrie)|Margaret White]]\n* [[Rena Sofer]] as [[Rita Desjardin|Miss Desjarden]]\n* [[Kandyse McClure]] as [[Sue Snell]]\n* [[Emilie de Ravin]] as Chris Hargensen\n* [[Tobias Mehler]] as Tommy Ross\n* Jesse Cadotte as Billy Nolan\n* Meghan Black as Norma Watson\n* [[Chelan Simmons]] as Helen Shyres\n* [[Katharine Isabelle]] as Tina Blake\n* [[David L.

the film's drawbacks were not simply caused by the medium, he did make the criticism that the prom scenes were sapped by the commercial breaks: the filmmakers, he argued, should have opted for a shorter sequence.<ref name=nyt/> ''[[SF Gate]]''{{'}}s Edward Guthmann also criticized the film's overall length, especially in regard to the prom scene, as he considered the \"dramatic impact\" was

of DVD Talk said the home media release evidenced \"gaps in the action\" caused by the commercials.<ref name=miller/>\n\nThe film's special effects were heavily criticized.{{efn|Gallo considered them to be \"a fizzle\";<ref name=gallo/> Wertheimer called them \"passable\",<ref name=nyt/> and Jane declared, \"some of the effects work is just plain bad to the point where it can be unintentionally

effects \"cheap\".<ref name=cbr/> Levesque and Gallo found their usage to be excessive,<ref name=spi/> and the former said the film suddenly \"shifts into a special effects bonanza\".<ref name=gallo/> Another common complaint was that the film was not scary,<ref name=sf/><ref name=nyp/> which lead Levesque to write that \"the new 'Carrie' doesn't even fit the category [of scary-movie genre]\".<ref

similar remark on the sexual content.<ref name=ct/>\n\nMost of the praise the film received was directed towards its cast,{{efn|Examples:\n* Stasi: \"Everything works \u2013 starting with the

performances\"<ref name=jane/>}} although Wertheimer and Arrigo were critical about the acting.<ref name=nyt/><ref name=dread/> While Clarkson, McClure, and Keith were praised by more than one reviewer,{{efn|Hanley considered \"strong performances\" were delivered by Keith, Clarkson and Bettis.<ref name=fang-rev/> Stasi praised the \"well-cast\" Clarkson, while declared, \"Even David Keith as the detective investigating the horror is perfect in the role\".<ref name=nyp/> Gallo considered Sue was \"played smartly\" McClure,<ref name=gallo/> while Levesque said \"McClure creates a Sue far more mysterious than Amy Irving's original\".<ref name=spi/> Jane wrote, \"Rena Sofer is decent as Miss Desjarden and Kandyse McClure plays the 'queen bitch' of the high school {{sic}}<!-- it's not McClure who plays her, but de Ravin --> really well but it's Patricia Clarkson and Angela Bettis who do most of the heavy lifting here\".<ref name=jane/>}} Bettis' performance was especially praised.{{efn|Examples:\n* Gallo: \"Angela Bettis does an admirable job as Carrie\"<ref name=gallo/>\n* Wertheimer: \"Better than passable is the performance of tonight's Carrie, Angela Bettis ...
