The film stars [[Dylan Baker]], [[Rochelle Aytes]], [[Anna Paquin]] and [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]. It relates four [[Halloween]] horror stories with a common element in them: Sam, a [[Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treater]] wearing orange [[Blanket sleeper|footie pajamas]] with a burlap sack over his head. The character makes an appearance in each of the stories whenever one of the other characters breaks a Halloween tradition.\n\nDespite being delayed for two years and having only a limited number of screenings at film festivals, the film received much critical acclaim and has since garnered a strong [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/10/trick-r-treat-movie/ |title=Cult-Favorite Halloween Flick Trick 'r Treat Streams on Facebook Tonight |magazine=Wired |publisher=www.wired.com |access-date=February 11, 2013|last1=Watercutter |first1=Angela }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Please keep this section short, as per [[WP:FILMPLOT]]. It should be a summary to aid in understanding the other sections of the article and should not go into significant detail. Please discuss on talk page before making any additions.-->\n\nThe film is framed by [[Halloween]] night in the fictional town of Warren Valley, [[Ohio]]. The plot follows a [[nonlinear narrative]], with characters crossing paths throughout the film. At the center of the story is [[Samhain|Sam]], a peculiar trick-or-treater in a burlap pajama costume, who appears to enforce the \"[[Trick-or-treating|rules]]\" of Halloween.\n\n===Opening===\nIn the opening scene, Emma and her Halloween-loving husband Henry return home after a celebratory night. Emma (who hates Halloween) blows out their jack-o'-lantern before midnight against Henry's superstitious advice. As Henry relaxes and falls asleep in the house, Emma begins tearing down the front lawn decorations without his knowing; but is then ambushed and murdered by an unseen assailant. Later, Henry discovers her mutilated corpse on display with the decorations.\n\n===Principal ===\nCharlie, an overweight child who vandalizes [[jack-o'-lantern]]s, is caught stealing candy from an unattended bowl left by his school principal Steven Wilkins. Seemingly taking the offense in stride, Wilkins offers Charlie a candy bar while lecturing Charlie on the importance of respecting Halloween rules and traditions. Charlie gradually feels more unwell until he begins to vomit chocolate and blood. As Charlie dies, Wilkins reveals that he laced the candy with [[cyanide]], remarking \"You should always check your candy.\"\n\nWhile clumsily attempting to hide the murder, he hands out candy to trick-or-treaters, including Sam. Wilkins attempts to bury Charlie in his backyard along with the body of another victim, but is continually interrupted by his young son Billy; his cantankerous elderly neighbor, Mr. Kreeg; and Kreeg\u2019s dog Spite. The other victim turns out to still be alive and struggles in his sack, forcing Wilkins to violently beat him to death with a shovel before anyone can discern the noise.\n\nWhen Wilkins returns indoors, he briefly notices Kreeg at the window, screaming for help before something seems to attack him. Wilkins guides Billy downstairs to carve a jack-o'-lantern, hiding a knife behind his back. After some hesitation, Wilkins appears to stab Billy. However, Billy is unharmed and it is revealed that the knife was plunged into Charlie's severed head, the \"jack-o'-lantern\" they are about to carve.\n\n===Halloween School Bus Massacre===\nA group of teenage trick-or-treaters (Macy, Chip, Schrader, and Sara) are collecting jack-o'-lanterns when they meet Rhonda, a Halloween traditionalist dressed as a witch. The group, led by Macy, visits a flooded [[quarry]] where she tells the [[urban legend]] of the \"Halloween School Bus Massacre\". In this legend, eight disabled children were killed by a school bus driver on Halloween. The children's parents (weary of the burden of caring for them and resenting them for their disabilities simply out of social embarrassment) wanted nothing more than to be rid of them; so they  paid the bus driver to dispose of them. However, before the driver could complete his plan, one child escaped his shackles and took control of the bus. The boy accidentally started the bus as it was on the edge of a cliff, causing the bus to fall into the quarry. The children drowned, though the driver survived.\n\nMacy leaves eight jack-o'-lanterns by the lake as a tribute to the deceased. The group splits up, leaving Rhonda and Chip behind. Rhonda is pursued by horrifying figures, but once she is reduced to tears the other teens claim responsibility, revealing that they disguised themselves as the dead children in an attempt to prank her, all planned out by Macy. Schrader realizes that the trick has gone too far and comforts the terrified Rhonda while a bitter Macy kicks a jack-o'-lantern into the water. The dead children emerge from the lake, attacking Macy and Sara. Sara is dragged away and killed while Rhonda escapes, abandoning the other three teens to their gruesome fate as revenge for their heartless prank on her. As she leaves, Rhonda encounters Sam and exchanges a nod of respect toward him.\n\n===Surprise Party===\nLaurie, a self-conscious 22-year-old, joins her sister Danielle and friends Maria and Janet for Halloween. She winds up with a \"Little Red Riding Hood\" costume that (in her opinion) makes her \"look like she's five\" in comparison to her friends' revealing outfits.\n\nA staunch traditionalist, Laurie misses just trick-or-treating which her sister and friends casually disregard. The other girls pick up dates, but Laurie declines in favor of staying to enjoy the town festival instead. She later encounters a hooded man dressed as a vampire who follows her into the woods and attacks her. A bundle of black cloth falls out of a tree, revealing a bloody and fearful killer. Laurie's friends unmask the incapacitated man, after Laurie remarks that he bit her. He is revealed to be Steven Wilkins, revealed to be a serial killer who had sought out victims at the festival. \n\nLaurie's friends are then revealed to be [[werewolf|werewolves]], shedding their clothing and skin before feasting on their deceased dates. Laurie, this being her first time consuming someone, makes an exception. She is the last to transform and kills Wilkins before devouring him. Sitting on a log nearby, Sam witnesses the werewolves\u2019 feast.\n\n===Sam===\nKreeg, Wilkins' curmudgeonly Halloween-hating neighbor, scares trick-or-treaters off his doorstep with his dog dressed up. As the night proceeds, Kreeg encounters escalating phenomena: The house is egged; the lawn is filled with ornate jack-o'-lanterns; and the hallways and ceiling are scrawled with Halloween and Samhain greetings.\n\nKreeg is ambushed by Sam, numerous times, and eventually manages to unmask his assailant, whose head resembles a frightful hybrid of a skull and a jack-o' lantern. Kreeg shoots Sam several times with a shotgun, and pumpkin innards spray from the wounds, apparently killing Sam. But when Kreeg sits down, relieved, Sam begins to reanimate, proves difficult to kill and, after badly injuring Kreeg, he eventually has the old man cornered. Instead of killing Kreeg, Sam impales a candy bar in Kreeg's lap, completing the tradition of \"handing out\" candy on Halloween. Satisfied, Sam spares a confused Kreeg and ominously departs. Meanwhile, photographs burning in the fireplace reveal that Kreeg is the driver from the School Bus Massacre.\n\n===Conclusion===\nA heavily-bandaged Kreeg gives candy to trick-or-treaters. While on his front porch, he observes the street, where he witnesses other characters in the film mill about observing Halloween traditions. Billy sits on his father's porch, handing out candy to trick-or-treaters and enjoying himself. Rhonda crosses the street casually pulling her wagon filled with jack-o'-lanterns along, and is nearly run over by Laurie and the girls' SUV as they drive by laughing to each other. Emma and Henry arrive at home, Henry relaxes in his home while Emma blows out the jack-o'-lantern as Sam moves in for the kill for breaking a Halloween tradition. Kreeg retreats into his home, but immediately hears a knock on his door. These last trick-or-treaters are the children from the bus; they mockingly greet him. The film transitions to comic strips, showing the children brutally tearing apart and devouring Kreeg as revenge for their murder.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Quinn Lord]] as Sam\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Principal Steven Wilkins\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Laurie\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Mr. Kreeg\n* Gerald Paetz as Young Kreeg\n* [[Lauren Lee Smith]] as Danielle\n* [[Rochelle Aytes]] as Maria\n* [[Britt McKillip]] as Macy\n* [[Jean-Luc Bilodeau]] as Schrader\n* Samm Todd as Rhonda\n* Alberto Ghisi as Chip\n* Isabelle Deluce as Sara\n* Moneca Delain as Janet\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Emma\n* [[Tahmoh Penikett]] as Henry\n* [[Brett Kelly (actor)|Brett Kelly]] as Charlie\n* Connor Levins as Billy Wilkins\n* James Willson as Alex\n* [[Patrick Gilmore (actor)|Patrick Gilmore]] as Bud the Cameraman\n* [[C.
