Some elements of the screenplay were taken from actual incidents that happened with some of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]'s submarines during the war. Other members of the cast include several actors who went on to become television stars in the 1960s and 1970s: [[Gavin MacLeod]] of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', [[Marion Ross]] of ''[[Happy Days]]'', and [[Dick Sargent]] of ''[[Bewitched]]''.\n\n[[Paul King (screenwriter)|Paul King]], Joseph Stone, [[Stanley Shapiro]], and [[Maurice Richlin]] were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing]] for their work on ''Operation Petticoat''. The film was the basis for a [[Operation Petticoat (TV series)|TV series in 1977]] starring [[John Astin]] in Grant's role.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1959, U. S. Navy [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] Matt Sherman, [[ComSubPac]], boards the obsolete submarine USS ''Sea Tiger'', prior to her departure for the [[ship breaking|scrapyard]]. Sherman, her first commanding officer, begins reading his wartime personal [[logbook]], and a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] begins.\n\nOn December 10, 1941, a Japanese [[Airstrike|air raid]] sinks ''Sea Tiger'' while she is docked at the [[Cavite Navy Yard]] in the Philippines. [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Sherman and his crew begin repairs, hoping to sail for [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Australia]] before the Japanese overrun the port. Believing there is no chance of repairing the submarine, the squadron commodore transfers most of Sherman's crew to other boats, but promises Sherman that he will have first call on any available replacements. [[Lieutenant (junior grade)]] Nick Holden, an admiral's aide, is reassigned to ''Sea Tiger'' despite a total lack of submarine training or experience.\n\nHolden demonstrates great skill as a scrounger after Sherman makes him the supply officer. He teams up with [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Sergeant]] Ramon Gallardo, an escaped prisoner (caught misappropriating Navy property to run his own restaurant), to obtain materials desperately needed for repairs. What Holden and his men cannot acquire from base warehouses, they steal. Chief Tosten, the senior Motor Machinist Mate, is forced to cannibalize the Nos. 3 and 4 diesels to keep Nos. 1 and 2 running. No. 1 especially is a problem, constantly backfiring and belching black smoke.\n\nRefloated and restored to barely seaworthy condition, ''Sea Tiger'' puts to sea after a native [[witch doctor]] casts a protection spell on her. ''Sea Tiger'' reaches [[Marinduque]], where Sherman reluctantly agrees to evacuate five stranded [[Army Nurse Corps (United States)|Army nurses]]. Holden is attracted to [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]] Barbara Duran, while Sherman has a series of embarrassing encounters with the well-endowed and clumsy Second Lieutenant Dolores Crandall. Later, when Sherman prepares to attack an enemy [[oiler (ship)|oiler]] moored to a pier, Crandall accidentally fires a torpedo before the [[Torpedo Data Computer]] finishes transmitting its settings to the \"tin fish.\" The torpedo misses the tanker and instead \"sinks\" a truck ashore. ''Sea Tiger'' flees amidst a hail of enemy cannon fire.\n\n[[File:USS Balao standing in for Operation Petticoat\u200d's fictional USS Sea Tiger.png|thumb|[[USS Balao (SS-285)|USS ''Balao'']] standing in for ''Operation Petticoat''{{'}}s fictional USS ''Sea Tiger''. Note the cloud of smoke from the balky No. 1 engine.]] \nSherman tries to put the nurses ashore at [[Cebu]], but the Army refuses to accept them without the proper orders, as the Japanese are closing in. Unable to obtain needed supplies from official sources, Sherman allows Holden to set up a casino in order to acquire them from the Army soldiers. Chief Torpedoman Molumphry, the Chief of the Boat, has been asking for paint. Holden manages to get some [[red lead|red]] and [[white lead]] [[primer (paint)|primer paint]], but does not have enough of either to prime the entire hull. Sherman reluctantly has the two mixed together, resulting in a pale pink primer that is applied. A Japanese air raid forces a hasty departure before the crew can apply a top coat of navy gray.\n\n[[Tokyo Rose]] mocks the mysterious pink submarine, while the U.S. Navy believes it to be a Japanese deception, ordering that it be sunk on sight. An American destroyer spots ''Sea Tiger'' and opens fire, then launches [[depth charge]]s when the submarine [[crash dive]]s. Sherman tries an oil slick and then launches blankets, pillows, and life jackets, but the deception fails. At Holden's suggestion, Sherman ejects the nurses' lingerie. Crandall's bra convinces the destroyer's captain that \"the Japanese have nothing like this\", and he ceases fire. ''Sea Tiger'', still painted pink, arrives at Darwin battered but under her own power.\n\nSherman's reminiscence ends with the arrival of [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Nick Holden, his wife (the former Lieutenant Duran), and their two sons. Sherman promises Holden command of a new [[nuclear-powered submarine]], also named ''Sea Tiger''. Sherman's wife (the former Lieutenant Crandall) arrives late with their four daughters and [[Rear-end collision|rear-end]]s her husband's staff car, causing it to lock bumpers with a Navy bus. When it drives away, dragging his car with it, Sherman reassures his wife that it will be stopped at the main gate. Commander Holden takes ''Sea Tiger'' out on her final voyage, her departure punctuated by a backfire from the No. 1 diesel, still troublesome after all these years.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Lieutenant Commander (later Rear Admiral) Matthew T. \"Matt\" Sherman, USN\n* [[Tony Curtis]] as Lieutenant, Junior Grade (later Commander) Nicholas \"Nick\" Holden, USNR (later USN)\n* [[Virginia Gregg]] as Major Edna Heywood, NC, US Army\n* [[Joan O'Brien]] as Second Lieutenant Dolores Crandall, NC, USAR\n* [[Dina Merrill]] as Second Lieutenant Barbara Duran, NC, USAR\n* [[Madlyn Rhue]] as Second Lieutenant Reid, NC, USAR\n* [[Marion Ross]] as Second Lieutenant Colfax, NC, USAR\n* [[Robert F.

He had joined the U.S. Navy during World War II intending to enter the submarine service in part because his hero, Cary Grant, had appeared in ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' (1943). After he became a star, Curtis suggested making a film in which Grant would stare into a periscope as he did in ''Destination Tokyo''. Curtis very much enjoyed working with Grant.<ref name=\"tcmcurtis\">\"Private Screenings: Tony Curtis\".

Most of the filming was done in and around Naval Station Key West, now the [[Truman Annex]] of [[Naval Air Station Key West]], Florida, which substituted for the Philippines and Australia. Filming for the period suggesting postwar 1959 was done at [[Naval Station San Diego]], California.\n\nUSS ''Sea Tiger'' was portrayed by three different American World War II [[Balao-class submarine|''Balao''-class submarine]]s:\n* [[USS Queenfish (SS-393)|USS ''Queenfish'']], in the opening and closing scenes (circa 1959), in which the \"393\" on the conning tower is visible;\n* [[USS Archerfish (SS-311)|USS ''Archerfish'']], for all the World War II scenes where the boat was painted the standard gray and black;\n* [[USS Balao (SS-285)|USS ''Balao'']], for all the scenes in which ''Sea Tiger'' was painted pink.\n\nThe attacking destroyer and, during the arrival at Darwin, the destroyer visible in the background was the [[Fletcher-class destroyer|''Fletcher''-class destroyer]] [[USS Wren (DD-568)|USS ''Wren'']] .\n\n==Historical accuracy==\nA plot error says that ''Sea Tiger'' is heading to Darwin to meet up with the [[sub tender]] [[USS Bushnell (AS-15)|USS ''Bushnell'']] in December 1941; ''Bushnell'' was not commissioned until 1943.\n\nAs noted above, the fictional ''Sea Tiger'' is played by three different Balao-class submarines.  The action of the film begins on December 10, 1941, with the ''Sea Tiger'' obviously already in-service; however, the first Balao-class submarine would not be launched until late October 1942. (Based on her name, the ''Sea Tiger'' probably would have been a prewar, ''Sargo''-class submarine.)\n\nSome of the plot points of ''Operation Petticoat'' were based on real-life incidents, such as:\n* The evacuation of one Navy nurse and several Army nurses from [[Corregidor]] to Australia by the submarine [[USS Spearfish (SS-190)|USS ''Spearfish'']], commanded by future Navy Cross recipient [[James C.
