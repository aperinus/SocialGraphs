Nelson]], and [[Sharon Stone]]. The film was released in the United States on February 12, 1988.\n\n[[Paula Abdul]] was the film choreographer. The film was released by [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar Film Entertainment]]. Although the film was quite successful at the box office, it received mostly negative reviews. Vanity was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe prologue shows two auto-worker [[trade union|union]] officials addressing the recent death of a peer. Within moments, both are brutally murdered by a group of shadowy, almost [[supernatural]] killers that seem to move, disappear and reappear at will during a daring skyscraper assault.\n\n[[Detroit Police Department]] Detective Sergeant Jericho Jackson, known locally as \"Action Jackson\", was a celebrated lieutenant in the police force but demoted (nearly two years before) because of a case he headed involving the criminal son of successful businessman Peter Anthony Dellaplane. The fallout over the case also collapsed Jackson's marriage and put the law-school-educated, star athlete and hometown hero at odds with the public. Even after his demotion, Jackson's continued interest leads to conflicts with his commander, Captain Armbruster, but he begins investigating Dellaplane's professional exploits, eventually uncovering a string of murdered trade-union members connected to Dellaplane's company. He discovers Dellaplane is secretly maneuvering into a \"behind-the-throne\" seat of power, and has been using a group of assassins, \"The Invisible Men\", to murder uncooperative union officials.\n\nJackson is assisted by Dellaplane's mistress, Sydney Ash, a local lounge singer and [[heroin]] [[addict]], whom the businessman has assisted financially. He is eventually [[frameup|framed]] in the murder of Dellaplane's wife Patrice (who was actually killed by her husband, after her discovery of his plot, and her seeking help from Jackson). On the run from the police, Jackson is helped by friends from his old neighborhood: Kid Sable, a local hotel owner and retired professional boxer and Dee, a lively local hairdresser (and gossip informant) who gives Jackson a way to discreetly get to Dellaplane\n\nJackson and Sydney arrange a meeting with Dellaplane's figurehead replacement for the auto union, unaware that The Invisible Men had been tracking them and allowed the meeting so that Dellaplane could confront Jackson face to face. Before he leaves with Sydney in tow, Dellaplane arrogantly reveals the reasoning for his plans and intends to exact it using Jackson as a pawn.  He intends to kill Jackson, put one of The Invisible Men in his place, have him kill an important union official, and then have Jackson's charred body discovered after he failed his getaway. \"Dellaplane, one of these days you are really going to piss me off,\" Jackson calls after his nemesis as he leaves with all but three of The Invisible Men. \"We're going to have ourselves a little barbecue,\" claims Shaker, The Invisible Men's leader, as they prepare to burn Jackson alive.  But Jackson is suddenly rescued by Sydney's bodyguard \"Big\" Edd and the pair battle the Invisible Men. Edd overpowers Birch, knocking him into a control panel, electrocuting him, while Jackson turns the welding torch they were about to use on him on Thaw, who is killed when the gasoline can he is holding explodes. Shaker opens fire on the pair with his grenade launcher, sending them running for cover. They lure him outside where Edd disarms him and Jackson takes the grenade launcher.\n\nJackson's escape leads to a fight at Dellaplane's mansion during the birthday party for the union leader Dellaplane plans to have assassinated. During the melee, the other members of The Invisible Men are killed by Jackson (who personally deals with the one set to make the kill and frame him), Edd, Jackson's old partner Detective Kotterwell, and a rehabilitated young thief named Albert, with help from Kid Sable. However, Dellaplane takes Sydney hostage and hides inside a bedroom in his mansion.  After being given a gun by Kotterwell, Jackson commandeers a car being displayed at the party, crashes into the house, kills Dellaplane's butler/bodyguard, Cartier by ramming him into a wall as the latter fires at him, and roars upstairs to crash into the room Dellaplane is holding Sydney in.  After a brief standoff, Dellaplane, (a trained martial artist) challenges Jackson to hand-to-hand combat. At first Dellaplane has the upper hand, but after ramming Jackson into a car window, he is abruptly shoved back by Jackson, who turns and shouts \"Now you've pissed me off!\" Jackson proceeds to thrash Dellaplane.  In desperation, Dellaplane goes for his gun, only for Jackson to seize his own and engage in a crossfire exchange, with Jackson killing Dellaplane and receiving a wound in the shoulder in return. Captain Armbruster arrives with reinforcements, informs Jackson that he wants a full report on his desk \"in the morning{{nbsp}}...\" and calls Jackson \"Lieutenant.\"   Sydney soon reveals she plans to go \"cold turkey\" off of heroin, promising Jackson can have her \"on Thanksgiving.\"  Jackson replies, \"Can I have you any sooner?\"  Sydney giggles and the two kiss passionately as the screen fades to black.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as Sergeant Jericho \"Action\" Jackson\n* [[Craig T.
