A co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, the film was written by ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' writers [[Jerry Juhl]] and [[Jack Burns]]. Produced between the first and second half of ''The Muppet Show''{{'}}s third season, the film tells the [[origin story]] of the Muppets, as [[Kermit the Frog]] embarks on a cross-country trip to [[Los Angeles]], encountering several of the Muppets\u2014who all share the same ambition of finding success in professional show business\u2014along the way while being pursued by Doc Hopper, a greedy [[restaurateur]] with intentions of employing Kermit as a spokesperson for his [[frog legs]] business.\n\nThe film stars Muppet performers Henson, [[Frank Oz]], [[Jerry Nelson]], [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]], and [[Dave Goelz]], as well as [[Charles Durning]] and [[Austin Pendleton]], and it features cameo appearances by [[Dom DeLuise]], [[James Coburn]], [[Edgar Bergen]] (in his final film appearance before his death), [[Steve Martin]], and [[Mel Brooks]], among others. Notable for its [[surreal humour]], [[meta-reference]]s and prolific use of [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s, ''The Muppet Movie'' was released by [[Associated Film Distribution]] in the United Kingdom on May 31, 1979, and in the United States on June 22, 1979, and it received critical praise, including two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and [[Kenneth Ascher]]'s [[Film score|musical score]] and their song, \"[[Rainbow Connection]]\". The success of ''The Muppet Movie'' led to several other feature films and television series starring the Muppets across different media. In 2009, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. As of June 20, 2020, the word count for this plot summary is 678 words. -->\nThe story opens with [[the Muppets]] sitting down at a private screening to watch a movie, for not only a screen testing, but as a [[pastiche]] of how they all met.\n\n[[Kermit the Frog]] lives a simple life in a Florida swamp. After he plays [[American Banjo Museum#Jim Henson|his banjo]] and sings \"[[Rainbow Connection]]\", he is approached by Bernie, a [[talent agent]] who encourages Kermit to pursue a career in show business. Inspired by the idea of \"making millions of people happy\", Kermit sets off on a cross-country trip to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]].\n\nKermit meets [[Fozzie Bear]], who is working as a hapless stand-up comedian, and Kermit invites Fozzie on his journey. The two set out in Fozzie's 1951 [[Studebaker Champion|Studebaker]], but are soon pursued by entrepreneur Doc Hopper and his assistant Max in an attempt by Hopper to convince Kermit to be the new spokesfrog of Hopper's struggling [[Deep frying|French-fried]] [[frog legs]] restaurant franchise. Horrified, Kermit kindly refuses and he and Fozzie drive away. Unwilling to accept Kermit's refusal, Hopper resorts to increasingly forceful means of persuasion. In an old church, Kermit and Fozzie meet the rock band [[Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem]], and the band's manager [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], who help them disguise their car. Driving on, they meet and are joined by [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] and his girlfriend [[List of Muppets#Camilla the Chicken|Camilla the Chicken]], who are also interested in becoming movie stars. They trade in their failing vehicle at a used car lot, where they meet [[List of Muppets#Sweetums|Sweetums]]. They invite Sweetums to come with them, but he runs away. The others drive away, only for Sweetums to emerge and reveal that he had only gone to pack his things.\n\nThe group meets [[Miss Piggy]] at a county fair, and she and Kermit immediately become love-stricken with each other. When Kermit and Miss Piggy meet for dinner that night, Hopper and Max sneak up on Miss Piggy and abduct her as bait to lure Kermit. When Kermit arrives at the designated location, mad scientist Professor Krassman tries to brainwash Kermit into performing in Hopper's advertisements, but Miss Piggy furiously knocks out Hopper's henchmen and causes Krassman to be brainwashed by his own device. However, immediately after the fight and saving Kermit, Miss Piggy receives a job offer and promptly abandons a devastated Kermit.\n\nJoined by [[Rowlf the Dog]] and reunited with Miss Piggy along the way, the Muppets continue their journey to Hollywood, but their car breaks down in the desert. Sitting at a campfire, the group sadly realizes that they will likely miss the audition the next day. Kermit wanders off, ashamed for bringing his friends on a fruitless journey, but some [[Internal monologue|personal reflection]] restores his commitment. He returns to camp, where he discovers the Electric Mayhem have come to their rescue, [[fourth wall|having learned of their plight by reading ahead in the film's script]]. The Mayhem offer to drive the entire group the rest of the way in their bus.\n\nThe group is warned by a reformed Max that Hopper has hired an assassin, Snake Walker, to kill Kermit.  Kermit decides to face his aggressor and proposes a Western-style showdown in a nearby [[ghost town]]. There, they find inventor [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]] and his assistant [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]]. Kermit confronts Hopper with an appeal to Hopper's own hopes and dreams, but Hopper is unmoved and orders his henchmen to kill Kermit and his friends. They are saved when one of Dr. Honeydew's inventions, \"insta-grow\" pills, temporarily enlarges Mayhem drummer [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]], who frightens away Hopper and his henchmen for good.\n\nOnce the Muppets reach the Hollywood studio, they finally meet studio executive Lew Lord, who signs the Muppets to a \"standard 'rich and famous' contract\". The first take in their attempt to perform the script goes awry when Gonzo crashes into the prop rainbow, and an explosion blows a hole in the roof of the studio. However, a real rainbow shines through the hole and onto the Muppets. Joined by other Muppet characters from ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas]]'', and ''[[The Land of Gorch]]'', the Muppets all sing together.\n\nSweetums then tears through the movie screen in the theater, ending the film and catching up with the rest of the crew as they congratulate each other on their performances.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charles Durning]] as Doc Hopper, a businessman, entrepreneur, and restaurateur.\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Max, Doc Hopper's shy right-hand man and sidekick.\n* Scott Walker as Snake Walker, an [[Assassination|assassin]] who specializes in killing frogs.\n* [[Hard Boiled Haggerty|H.B.

Director [[Tim Burton]] is one of the puppeteers in the final shot of the film. [[John Landis]] is also in the final shot, performing [[Grover]]. Landis and Burton were both uncredited.\n\nMany other long time members of Jim Henson's team also provided puppeteer services, including Whitmire, [[Kathryn Mullen]], [[Bob Payne]], [[Eren Ozker]], Carolyn Wilcox, Olga Felgemacher, [[Bruce Schwartz]], [[Michael Earl (puppeteer)|Michael Earl Davis]], Buz Suraci, Tony Basilicato, and Adam Hunt (brother of Richard Hunt).\n\n===Cameo guest stars===\n(in order of appearance)\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Bernie, a Hollywood agent who meets Kermit in the swamp.

The character's name alludes to [[Lew Grade|Sir Lew Grade]], head of [[Associated Television|ATV]], the British company that co-produced the original ''[[The Muppet Show|Muppet Show]]''.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe main obstacle the filmmakers were faced with during the development of ''The Muppet Movie'' was whether the Muppets would transition seamlessly from television to film. In 1978, director [[James Frawley]], [[Jim Henson]], and [[Frank Oz]] filmed several camera tests outside [[London]] to test how the characters would appear in real-world locations.<ref name=Frawley>{{cite news|last1=Roessner|first1=Beth|title=First 'Muppets' director recalls original|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/03/21/first-muppets-director-jim-frawley/6715775/|access-date=September 5, 2014|work=USA Today|date=March 22, 2014}}</ref> [[Austin Pendleton]] recalled that the film was shot on \"a very unhappy set, because Jim [Frawley] was very unhappy directing that movie. And I noticed that was the only time the Muppet people used an outside person to direct a Muppet movie. They never did that again. After that, it was either Jim Henson or Frank Oz. And I would have liked to have been in one of those, because those sets were very harmonious. But this was not.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/austin-pendleton,31009/|title=Austin Pendleton &#124; Film &#124; Random Roles|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|date=July 29, 2009|publisher=The A.V.

This scene took five days to film. Before this, no film had a hand puppet act with its entire body appearing on-screen. That is, hand puppets were only seen from the waist up, and it became a major plot point to show Kermit with legs. To have Kermit ride a bicycle in a full-body shot, a Kermit puppet with legs was posed onto the seat and his legs and arms were attached to the pedals and handlebars. An overhead crane with a marionette system held the bicycle through strong strings invisible to the camera, guiding the bicycle forward. The crane and system were out of the camera's frame of vision.<ref name=\"Frawley\" />\n\nOther shots required Muppets standing and acting in a full-body shot. Specially-made, remote-controlled puppets were placed on the set and controlled by puppeteers out of the frame. A dancing Kermit and [[Fozzie Bear]] were operated by Henson and Oz in front of a [[Chroma key|blue screen]], and they were composited onto a separate reel of the stage. Both of these effects and the bicycle effect were used again, and refined, in subsequent Muppet films.\n\nFor scenes involving driving, a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] sat in the trunk and controlled via remote control. A television monitor showed what was ahead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/80766/13-fun-facts-about-muppet-movie|title = 13 Fun Facts About the Muppet Movie|date = May 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2007/03/02/qa-the-muppet-movie-director-james-frawley/|title = Home}}</ref>\n\nThe closing reprise of \"Rainbow Connection\" featured a crowd of more than 250 Muppet characters\u2014virtually every Muppet that had been created up to that point in time. According to Henson Archivist Karen Falk: \"137 puppeteers were enlisted from the Puppeteers of America (along with the regular Muppets performers) to perform every Muppet extant. Prior to the day-long filming of the shot, Henson gave the enthusiastic participants a lesson in the art of cinematic puppetry. Amazingly, it did take just one day.\" The Muppet Show Fan Club newsletter answered the question of \"How did they do it?\" The response was \"There are 250 puppets in the last shot of the film, and they're all moving. How? 150 puppeteers in a 6' deep, 17' wide pit, that's how. They were recruited through the Los Angeles Guild of The Puppeteers of America and almost every puppeteer west of the Rockies reported for pit duty.\"<ref>''The Muppet Show Fan Club'' newsletter (vol. 2, no. 1)</ref> In September 1978, [[Edgar Bergen]], Henson's idol who appeared in a cameo role, died shortly after completing his scenes. Henson dedicated the film to his memory.\n\n===Style===\n''The Muppet Movie'' uses [[meta-reference]]s as a source of humor, as characters occasionally break the [[fourth wall]] to address the audience or comment on their real-life circumstances. In one scene, Kermit and Fozzie encounter [[Big Bird]] on the road, offering him a lift to Hollywood, but he declines, claiming he's heading to New York City to break into public television, referencing the character's role on ''[[Sesame Street]]''; Fozzie wishes the Bird luck before driving off.\n\nIn a particularly meta-fictional [[plot twist]], Kermit and Fozzie actually give the screenplay to Dr. Teeth, who later uses it to find and rescue them after they have been stranded in the desert.\n\n===Prop vehicles===\nSeveral classic cars were specially selected by Henson for appearances in the film. The most prominent were a pair of 1951 [[Studebaker]] Commander Coupes driven by [[Fozzie Bear]] in the film. One car was painted but unmodified and driven by a person in the front seat. It was used for long, traveling shots. The second car was driven by a person in the trunk who viewed the road through a TV set. The television received its image from a camera located in the center nose of the car's front grille. This made it possible for [[Frank Oz]] to perform [[Fozzie Bear]] in the front seat, and have the character seemingly drive the car in close-up shots. This car is now on display at the [[Studebaker National Museum]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]].\n\nDoc Hopper is chauffeured throughout the movie by Max in a 1959 [[Cadillac Series 70|Cadillac Fleetwood 75 Limousine]].\n\nThe final car driven by the Muppets is a [[1946 Ford]] [[Woodie (car body style)|Woodie]] station wagon, famous for its wood panel siding and a valuable collectible.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|The Muppet Movie (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's music and lyrics were written by [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and [[Kenneth Ascher]]. Regarding the music's composition, Williams said; \"Jim Henson gave you more [creative] freedom than anybody I've ever worked with in my life. I said, 'You want to hear the songs as we're writing them?' He said, 'No. I'll hear them in the studio. I know I'm gonna love them.' You just don't get that kind of freedom on a project these days.\"<ref name=\"songfacts\">{{cite web| url = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3146| title = Rainbow Connection| work = Songfacts.com| access-date = December 7, 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n\"Movin' Right Along\", \"Never Before, Never Again\", and \"I Hope That Somethin' Better Comes Along\" were shortened in the film, compared to their soundtrack versions, for continuity purposes. The latter, a duet between Rowlf and Kermit, contained references that the studio considered too mature for children, although the song appeared complete in the British theatrical and home video debut versions. In \"Finale: The Magic Store\", a line performed by Kermit in the film is sung by Fozzie on the soundtrack recording.\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\nIn May 1979, [[CBS]] aired ''[[The Muppets Go Hollywood]]'', a one-hour television special that promoted the then-upcoming release of ''The Muppet Movie''. In April, the film had been promoted when the Muppets hosted ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Brian Jay|year=2013|title=Jim Henson: The Biography|publisher=Ballantine Books|page=291|isbn=978-0-345-52612-0}}</ref> Additionally, a book adaptation of ''The Muppet Movie'', adapted by Steven Crist, was published by Peacock Press/[[Bantam Books]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Crist|first=Steven|date=1979|title=The Muppet Movie|publisher=Peacock Press/[[Bantam Books]]|isbn=978-0810913295}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=1986|title=Something About the Author|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Something_about_the_Author/jMVkAAAAMAAJ|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]]|volume=43|page=118|access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\n''The Muppet Movie'' was the first film by [[ITC Entertainment|ITC Films]] to be released on [[home video]] when [[Magnetic Video]] issued it in May 1980, having acquired the video rights to ITC's films.
