It stars [[Tony Ward (entertainer)|Tony Ward]] and LaBruce in an addition to the [[Queer Cinema]] canon, which is also an homage to classic [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] cinema. Also appearing in the film are [[Vaginal Davis]], [[Glen Meadmore]] and [[Graham David Smith]].\n\nIn a plot reminiscent of ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', ''Hustler White'' transposes the action from the silver screen's old movie backlots to contemporary male prostitution and the porn industry. The film, which like all of LaBruce's work is sexually explicit, includes a controversial [[amputee]] sex scene. Co-director Rick Castro cast real male hustlers and his former models, including Tony Ward, as amateur actors.<ref name=Johnson/><ref>Glyn Davis {{google books|AdFvAAAAQBAJ|Far from Heaven (2011)|page=27}}</ref> They also used the hustlers' homes (and other cast members' including Ron Athey's house in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake Hills]]) as location spots for filming.<ref name=Johnson/>\n\nPortions of the film appear in the music video for \"Misogyny\" a track by [[Canadians|Canadian]] rock band [[Rusty (band)|Rusty]] which appeared on [[MuchMusic]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Salerno |first1=Rob |title=Daily CanCon: \"Misogyny\" by Rusty \u2014 an odd outpost of queerness in Grunge rock |url=https://robsalerno.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/daily-cancon-misogyny-by-rusty-an-odd-outpost-of-queerness-in-grunge-rock/ |website=Exit Upstage |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=26 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Gormely |first1=Ian |title=Rusty Return with Their First Album in 20 Years |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/rusty_return_with_their_first_album_in_20_years |website=29 June 2018 |publisher=exclaim.ca |accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film starts with Monti Ward (Tony Ward), a male prostitute, dead in a jacuzzi. Then in a voice over, Monti describes the circumstances that led to his fate.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Anger (Bruce LaBruce), a writer from Europe, is in California researching a book on the gay prostitution and pornographic scene in Hollywood. While touring Santa Monica Boulevard, he meets Monti hustling on the street and develops a crush on him. Throughout the movie we discover various facets of Monti, including committing a hit and run which cripples a fellow hustler named Eigil (Kevin P. Scott). J\u00fcrgen unsuccessfully follows the devastatingly handsome rent-boy. As J\u00fcrgen continues his pursuit of the young man, the film follows Monti through his typical routine of various sordid and bizarre encounters with hustlers, johns and pornographers.\n\nFinally J\u00fcrgen can get Monti to show him various places in the gay prostitution scene of Hollywood. They end up at J\u00fcrgen's apartment, where Monti trips on a soap and remains unconscious in the jacuzzi. J\u00fcrgen finds him and pulls him out of the water, thinking he is dead. He brings him to the beach to dump his body in the ocean, but Monti wakes up. The two of them end up running hand in hand on the beach.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tony Ward (entertainer)|Tony Ward]] as Montgomery Ward\n* [[Bruce La Bruce]] as J\u00fcrgen Anger\n* Alex Austin as Alex\n* Kevin Kramer  as Kevin\n* [[Ron Athey]] as Seymour Kasabian\n* [[Glen Meadmore]] as Stew Blake\n* Ivar Johnson  as Piglet\n* Kevin P.
