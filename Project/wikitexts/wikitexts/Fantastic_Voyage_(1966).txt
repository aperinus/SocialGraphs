Its modern and imaginative production design received five nominations at the [[39th Academy Awards]] mostly in technical departments, winning for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction in Color]].\n\nThe movie used the concept of [[Size change in fiction|miniaturization]] in [[science fiction]] along with ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'' and inspired an [[Fantastic Voyage (TV series)|animated television series of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] have both developed technology that can miniaturize matter by shrinking individual atoms, but only for one hour.\n\nScientist Dr. Jan Benes, working behind the [[Iron Curtain]], has figured out how to make the process work indefinitely. With the help of American intelligence agents, including agent Charles Grant, he escapes to the West and arrives in [[New York City]], but an attempted assassination leaves him [[coma]]tose with a [[blood clot]] in his brain that no surgery can remove from the outside.\n\nTo save his life, Grant, Navy pilot Captain Bill Owens, medical chief and circulatory specialist Dr. Michaels, surgeon Dr. Peter Duval, and his assistant Cora Peterson are placed aboard a Navy [[ichthyology]] submarine at the Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces facilities. The submarine, named ''[[Proteus]]'', is then miniaturized to \"about the size of a microbe\", and injected into Benes' body. The team has 60 minutes to get to and remove the clot; after this, ''Proteus'' and its crew will begin reverting to their normal size, become vulnerable to Benes's immune system, and kill Benes.\n\nThe crew faces many obstacles during the mission. An undetected [[arteriovenous fistula]] forces them to detour through the heart, where [[cardiac arrest]] must be induced to, at best, reduce turbulence that would be strong enough to destroy ''Proteus''. As the crew faces an unexplained loss of oxygen and must replenish their supply in the lungs, Grant finds the surgical [[laser]] needed to destroy the clot was damaged from the turbulence in the heart, as it was not fastened down as it had been before: this and his safety line snapping loose while the crew was refilling their air supply has Grant begin to suspect a [[Sabotage|saboteur]] is on the mission. The crew must cannibalize their wireless radio to repair the laser, cutting off all communication and guidance from the outside, although because the sub is nuclear powered, surgeons and technicians outside Benes's body are still able to track their movements via a radioactive tracer, allowing General Alan Carter and Colonel Donald Reid, the officers in charge of CMDF, to figure out the crew's strategies as they make their way through the body. The crew is then forced to pass through the inner ear, requiring all outside personnel to make no noise to prevent destructive shocks, but while the crew is removing reticular fibers clogging the sub's vents and making the engines overheat, a fallen surgical tool causes the crew to be thrown about and Cora is nearly killed by [[antibody|antibodies]], but they are able to reboard the sub in time. By the time they finally reach the clot, the crew has only six minutes remaining to operate and then exit the body.\n\nBefore the mission, Grant had been briefed that Duval was the prime suspect as a potential surgical assassin, but as the mission progresses, he instead begins to suspect Michaels. During the surgery, Dr. Michaels knocks out Owens and takes control of ''Proteus'' while the rest of the crew is outside for the operation. As Duval finishes removing the clot with the laser, Michaels tries to crash the submarine into the same area of Benes' brain to kill him. Grant fires the laser at the ship, causing it to veer away and crash, and Michaels to get trapped in the wreckage with the controls pinning him to the seat, which attracts the attention of [[white blood cell]]s. While Grant saves Owens from the ''Proteus'', Michaels is killed when a white blood cell consumes the ship. The remaining crew quickly swim to one of Benes' eyes and escape through a tear duct seconds before returning to normal size.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stephen Boyd]] as Charles Grant, a CIA Agent enlisted to protect Benes\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Cora Peterson, the technical assistant for Dr. Duval\n* [[Edmond O'Brien]] as General Alan Carter, one of the officers in charge of Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Dr. Michaels, CMDF's medical chief and a circulatory specialist later revealed to be the saboteur of the mission\n* [[Arthur O'Connell]] as Colonel Donald Reid, the operational commander for Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces\n* [[William Redfield (actor)|William Redfield]] as Captain Bill Owens, a U.S. Navy officer who designed the ''Proteus'' for his branch's research and development program\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as Dr. Peter Duval, a top-class brain surgeon enlisted to perform the surgery on Benes\n* [[Jean Del Val]] as Dr. Jan Benes, the comatose scientist who perfected the formula for unlimited miniaturization\n* [[Barry Coe]] as communications aide\n* [[Ken Scott (actor)|Ken Scott]] as a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent\n* [[Shelby Grant]] as nurse\n* [[James Brolin]] as technician\n\n==Production==\nThe film was the original idea of Otto Klement and [[Jerome Bixby]].

The full-size Proteus mockup contained all the interior sets that the actors are seen in to represent the interior of the sub, with sections that could be pulled out to allow for cameras and crew to film the interior. The sub was also constructed in miniature, including a large miniature around five feet in length that could be flown on wires in the abstract sets representing the inside of the human body. The heart and brain sets built to accommodate the five-foot miniature filled a soundstage on the Fox lot\u2014these were filmed \"dry for wet,\" with floating, blob-shaped elements meant to be blood cells filmed separately and composited over the footage. A smaller, 18-inch miniature of the Proteus was constructed to operate in liquid for a shot of the submarine bursting through an arterial wall early in the movie. A tiny Proteus miniature just a few inches in length was made for the miniaturization sequence to show the ship being picked up by a \"precision handling device\" and dropped into a large glass cylinder which was then miniaturized to become part of a syringe that would inject the Proteus into the brain-injured scientist.<ref>{{Cite web|last1= Abbott |first1=L.B.| title= Special Effects: Wire, Tape and Rubber Band Style  |publisher= A S C Holding Corp; First Edition (December 1, 1984) ISBN 0935578064}}</ref>\n\nThe film starred Stephen Boyd, making his first Hollywood movie in five years.

The novel came out first because he wrote quickly and because of delays in filming.<ref name=\"Asimov 1980:363\">Asimov 1980:363</ref>\n\n==Biological issues and accuracy==\nIn the film, the crew (apart from the saboteur) manage to leave Benes's body safely before reverting to normal size, but the ''Proteus'' remains inside, as do the remains of the saboteur's body (albeit digested by a [[white blood cell]]), and several gallons (full scale) of a carrier solution (presumably saline) used in the injection syringe. Isaac Asimov pointed out that this was a serious logical flaw in the plot,<ref>Asimov 1980:363\u2013364</ref> since the submarine (even if reduced to bits of debris) would also revert to normal size, killing Benes in the process. Therefore, in his novelization Asimov had the crew provoke the white cell into following them, so that it drags the submarine to the tear duct, and its wreckage expands outside Benes's body. Asimov solved the problem of the syringe fluid by having the staff inject only a very small amount of miniaturized fluid into Benes, minimizing its effect on him when it expands.\n\n==Music==\nThe score was composed and conducted by [[Leonard Rosenman]]. The composer deliberately wrote no music for the first four reels of the film, before the protagonists enter the human body. Rosenman wrote that \"the harmony for the entire score is almost completely atonal except for the very end when our heroes grow to normality\".<ref>{{cite AV media notes| title = Fantastic Voyage| others = Leonard Rosenman| date = 1998| last = Bond| first = Jeff|page=2| type = CD insert notes| publisher = [[Film Score Monthly]]| id = Vol. 1, No. 3| location  = Los Angeles, California }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mostly positive reviews and a few criticisms.

In his autobiography ''[[In Joy Still Felt]]'', Asimov writes, \"I turned down the proposal out of hand. Hackwork, I said. Beneath my dignity.\"<ref name=\"Asimov 1980:363\"/> However, Bantam Books persisted, and at a meeting with Marc Jaffe and Marcia Nassiter on April 21, 1965, Asimov agreed to read the screenplay.\n\nIn the novelization's introduction, Asimov states that he was reluctant to write the book because he believed that the miniaturization of matter was physically impossible, but he decided that it was still good fodder for story-telling and that it could still make for some intelligent reading. In addition, 20th Century Fox was known to want someone with some science-fiction clout to help promote the film. Aside from the initial \"impossibility\" of the shrinking machine, Asimov went to great lengths to portray with great accuracy what it would actually be like to be reduced to infinitesimal scale. He discussed the ability of the lights on the sub to penetrate normal matter, issues of time distortion, and other side effects that the movie does not address. Asimov was also bothered by the way the wreck of ''Proteus'' was left in Benes. In a subsequent meeting with Jaffe, he insisted that he would have to change the ending so that the submarine was brought out. Asimov also felt the need to gain permission from his usual science-fiction publisher, Doubleday, to write the novel. Doubleday did not object, and had suggested his name to Bantam in the first place. Asimov began work on the novel on May 31, and completed it on July 23.<ref>Asimov 1980:366\u2013370</ref>\n\nAsimov did not want any of his books, even a film novelization, to appear only in paperback, so in August, he persuaded Austin Olney of [[Houghton Mifflin]] to publish a hardcover edition,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fantastic Voyage|isbn=978-1439526484|last1=Asimov|first1=Isaac|date=11 August 2008}}</ref> assuring him that the book would sell at least 8000 copies, which it did.<ref>Asimov 1980:371, 391</ref> However, since the rights to the story were held by Otto Klement, who had co-written the original story treatment, Asimov would not be entitled to any royalties. By the time the hardcover edition was published in March 1966, Houghton Mifflin had persuaded Klement to allow Asimov to have a quarter of the royalties.<ref>Asimov 1980:390</ref> Klement also negotiated for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' to serialize an abridged version of the novel, and he agreed to give Asimov half the payment for it. ''Fantastic Voyage'' (abridged to half its length) appeared in the February 26 and March 12, 1966 issues of the ''Post.''<ref>Asimov 1980:388\u2013389</ref> Bantam Books released the paperback edition of the novel in September 1966 to coincide with the release of the film.<ref>Asimov 1980:407</ref> [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], reviewing the Asimov novelization, called it a \"Jerry-built monstrosity\", praising the descriptions of science-fiction events as \"Asimov at his best\", while condemning the narrative framework as \"inane drivel\".<ref>\"Critique, [[Science Fantasy (magazine)|''Impulse'']], September 1966, p. 159.</ref>\n\n==Later adaptations==\n===Related novels and comics===\nThe film was adapted into a video game for [[Atari 2600]] in 1982 by [[Fox Interactive|Fox Video Games]].<ref>''[[Electronic Fun with Computers & Games]]'' [https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Fun_with_Computer_Games_Vol_01_No_06_1983-04_Fun_Games_Publishing_US/page/n53/mode/2up issue #6]</ref>\n\n''[[Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain]]'' (1987) was written by Isaac Asimov as an attempt to develop and present his own story apart from the 1966 screenplay. This novel is not a sequel to the original, but instead is a separate story taking place in the Soviet Union with an entirely different set of characters.\n\n''Fantastic Voyage: Microcosm'' is a third interpretation, written by [[Kevin J. Anderson]], published in 2001. This version has the crew of the ''Proteus'' explore the body of a dead alien that crash-lands on earth, and updates the story with such modern concepts as [[nanotechnology]] (replacing killer [[white blood cell|white cells]]).\n\nA comic book adaptation of the film was released by [[Gold Key Comics]] in 1967. Drawn by [[Wally Wood]], the book followed the plot of the movie with general accuracy, but many scenes were depicted differently and/or outright dropped, and the ending was given an epilogue similar as that seen in some of the early draft scripts for the film.<ref>{{Grand Comics Database issue|id=20741|title=Gold Key: ''Fantastic Voyage''}}</ref><ref>{{Comic Book DB|type=issue|id=143181|title=Gold Key: ''Fantastic Voyage''}}</ref>\n\nA parody of the film titled \"Fantastecch Voyage\" was published in ''[[Mad Magazine]]''.

July 2015, the project remained stuck in [[development hell]]. In 1984, Isaac Asimov was approached to write ''Fantastic Voyage II'', out of which a movie would be made.<ref name=\"I, Asimov\">{{cite book | last = Asimov | first = Isaac | title = I, Asimov | year = 1994 | publisher = Bantam Books | isbn = 0-553-56997-X | page = 501}}</ref> Asimov \"was sent a suggested outline\" that mirrored the movie ''[[Innerspace]]'' and \"involved two vessels in the bloodstream, one American and one Soviet, and what followed was a kind of submicroscopic version of World War III.\"<ref name=\"I, Asimov\"/> Asimov was against such an approach. Following a dispute between publishers, the original commissioners of the novel approached [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]], who \"wrote a novel and sent [in] the manuscript\" that was rejected despite \"stick[ing] tightly to the outline [that was sent to Asimov].\"<ref name=\"I, Asimov\"/> \"It dealt with World War III in the bloodstream, and it was full of action and excitement.\"<ref name=\"I, Asimov\"/> Although Asimov urged the publisher to accept Farmer's manuscript, it was insisted that Asimov write the novel. So, Asimov eventually wrote the book in his own way (completely different in plot from what [Farmer] had written), which was eventually published by Doubleday in 1987 as ''Fantastic Voyage II'' and \"dealt not with competing submarines in the bloodstream, but with one submarine, with [an] American hero cooperating (not entirely voluntarily) with four Soviet crew members.\"<ref name=\"I, Asimov\"/> The novel was not made into a movie, however.\n\n[[James Cameron]] was also interested in directing a remake (since at least 1997),<ref name=\"Sciretta\">{{cite web | last = Sciretta | first = Peter | url = https://www.slashfilm.com/2007/09/26/roland-emmerich-tries-to-explain-why-james-camerons-fantastic-voyage-script-sucked/ | title = Roland Emmerich Tries To Explain Why James Cameron's Fantastic Voyage Script Sucked | date = September 26, 2007 | work = [[/Film]] | access-date = 2009-11-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090825173038/http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/09/26/roland-emmerich-tries-to-explain-why-james-camerons-fantastic-voyage-script-sucked/ | archive-date = August 25, 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref> but decided to devote his efforts to his ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' project.
