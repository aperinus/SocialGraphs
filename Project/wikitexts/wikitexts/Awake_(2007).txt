It stars [[Hayden Christensen]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Terrence Howard]] and [[Lena Olin]]. The film was released in the United States and Canada on November 30, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nYoung billionaire, Clay Beresford, Jr. is in love with a beautiful woman, named Samantha \"Sam\" Lockwood; who is also his mother's personal assistant. Clay requires a heart transplant and Dr. Jack Harper is Clay's heart surgeon and friend. Clay asks Dr. Harper to arrange his elopement with Sam and they marry privately at midnight, then Clay goes to the hospital for the operation. While Clay's mother, Lilith awaits completion of his surgery, Clay encounters [[anesthesia awareness]]. The surgical pain causes Clay to have a clairvoyant experience exposing Dr. Harper's plot to murder him, also revealing that; Sam worked at the hospital under Dr. Harper and has conspired with him against Clay. Sam's plan was to poison the donor heart by injecting [[Doxorubicin|Adriamycin]] to cause it's rejection, thus; murdering Clay to collect insurance money to pay off Dr. Harper's malpractice lawsuits.\n\nThe scheme unravels and Lilith, realizing what has happened, she sacrifices her own life so that; Clay; who is close to death, can live; she dies by suicide so her heart can be switched for the poisoned one, and save Clay. While Sam tries to get away with what she did, Dr. Harper feels guilty and he holds onto proof so that; she can be arrested too. Another surgical team takes over the operation, as Clay barely clings to life and the conspirators are arrested. The new team takes Lilith's heart and transplants it into Clay's body, as Clay and Lilith have their final moments together in spirit; in an out-of-body experience.\n\nThe new head surgeon announces that Clay has come back to life, as the new team stitch Clay's wound. Clay in spirit, is still in the afterlife with Lilith, tries to take his own life to stay with his mother. Clay makes his new heart stop beating and the surgeons have to use the defibrillator in attempt to revive Clay. As Clay resists being revived, Lilith forces Clay; who is in the \"afterlife-world\", to revisit a scene from his childhood; when Lilith accidentally killed Clay's abusive father. This scene reveals the truth for Clay and connects his childhood flashbacks. After seeing this scene, Clay gives away to revival and before the surgeons could shock his body again, Clay; allows his new heart to begin beating. Clay opens his eyes when the surgeons remove the eye tapes; while Harper ends his narratings; with \"he is awake\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hayden Christensen]] as Clay Beresford, Jr. \n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Lockwood/Tunnel \n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Dr. Jack Harper \n* [[Lena Olin]] as Lilith Beresford \n* Nathalie Efron as Mary Beresford \n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Dr. Puttnam \n* [[Arliss Howard]] as Dr. Neyer \n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Dr. Larry Lupin \n* [[Georgina Chapman]] as Nurse Penny Carver \n* [[David Harbour]] as Dracula\n* [[Sam Robards]] as Clay Beresford, Sr.  \n* Steven Hinkle as Young Clay\n\n==Production==\nPortions of ''Awake'' were filmed on [[Fordham University]]'s Lincoln Center campus (Lowenstein Hall is converted to look like a hospital; the statue of \"[[St. Peter]]: Fisher of Men\" is visible in the film).
