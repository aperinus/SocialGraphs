Webb]], and released by [[20th Century Fox]] on November 15, 1956.<ref name=\"Day By Day-91\">Guralnick/Jorgensen, ''Elvis: Day by Day'', p. 91</ref> The film, named after [[Love Me Tender (song)|the song]], stars [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]], [[Debra Paget]], and [[Elvis Presley]] in his acting debut. As Presley's movie debut, it was the only time in his acting career that he did not receive top billing.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\">Victor, ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'', pages 314/315</ref>\n\n''Love Me Tender'' was originally to be titled ''The Reno Brothers'', but when advanced sales of Presley's \"Love Me Tender\" single passed one million\u2014a first for a single\u2014the film's title was changed to match.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/> This was the only time that Presley played a historical figure.\n\n==Plot==\nPresley plays Clint Reno, the youngest of the four [[Reno brothers]], who stays home to take care of his mother and the family farm as older brothers Vance, Brett and Ray fight in the [[American Civil War]] for the [[Confederate Army]].  The family is mistakenly informed that eldest brother Vance has been killed on the battlefield.  After four years of war, the brothers return home and find that Vance's former girlfriend Cathy has married Clint.  Although Vance accepts this wholeheartedly (\"We always wanted Cathy in the family\"), the family has to struggle to reach stability with this issue.  The subplot of unresolved passion carries the film; it is made clear from the outset upon the Reno brothers' return home that Cathy still loves Vance, although she is true to the younger Clint. Honor prevails for Vance, but jealousy leads Clint into irrational rivalry for Cathy's love.\n\nIn the film's opening scenes, the three Reno brothers, serving as Confederate cavalrymen, attack a Union train carrying a federal payroll of $12,000, not knowing that the war had ended only a day before. The Confederates come to a decision to keep the money as spoils of war, an issue that will come back into the plot after the Reno brothers return home.  A conflict of interest ensues when Vance tries to return the money against the wishes of some of his fellow Confederates, all of whom  are being sought by the U.S. Government for robbery. The film reaches its tragic climax with Clint's death during a final shootout. In the end, the money is returned, the Reno brothers are released, the other three ex-Confederates are arrested, and Clint is laid to rest at the family farm.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] as Vance Reno, Oldest Brother\n* [[Debra Paget]] as Cathy Reno, Clint's Wife\n* [[Elvis Presley]] as Clint Reno, Youngest Brother\n* [[Mildred Dunnock]] as Martha Reno, Mother\n* [[William Campbell (film actor)|William Campbell]] as Brett Reno, Brother\n* [[James Drury]] as Ray Reno, Brother\n* [[Neville Brand]] as Mike Gavin, Vance War Buddy\n* [[Russ Conway (actor)|Russ Conway]] as Ed Galt, Vance War Buddy\n* [[L.

His first No. 1 hit single, \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Top 100 chart [[1956 in music#US No. 1 hit singles|in April 1956]], a few weeks after his screen test for this film.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/> He had worked as a cinema usher in his youth and would often watch his screen idols [[James Dean]], [[Marlon Brando]], and [[Tony Curtis]]<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/> during shifts, studying their acting and learning lines from their movies.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/> When he first met his future manager, [[Colonel Tom Parker]], he expressed an interest in acting in film.{{Citation needed|date= December 2017}}\n\nIn interviews during his rise to fame, Presley would often talk about his hopes of attending somewhere like the [[Actors Studio]].<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/> He also insisted that he would not like to sing in any of his movies because he wished to be taken seriously as a film star.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/> However, Parker had a plan to cross-promote Presley's films with his music and this led to soundtracks being as important, if not more important, than the scripts.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/>\n\nPresley screen-tested for [[Hal Wallis]] on March 26, 1956 at [[Paramount Studios]].<ref name=\"Day by Day-67\">Guralnick/Jorgensen, ''Elvis:Day by Day'', p.67</ref> The test lasted three days<ref name=\"Day by Day-67\"/> and included Presley performing two scenes from ''[[The Rainmaker (1956 film)|The Rainmaker]]'',<ref name=\"Day by Day-67\"/> and lip-syncing to ''Blue Suede Shoes''.<ref name=\"Day by Day-67\"/>\n\nWallis' partner, Joe Hazen, commented: \"As a straight actor, the guy has great potentialities.\"<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/> His first screen test, a scene from the [[William Inge]] play ''The Girls of Summer'', resulted in drama coach Charlotte Clary declaring to her class of students, \"Now ''that'' is a natural born actor\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown; Broeske|first=Peter; Pat|title=Down at the End of Lonely Street: Life and Death of Elvis Presley|year=1998|publisher=Arrow Books Ltd|isbn=978-0-7493-2319-6|pages=102\u2013103}}</ref>\n\nOn April 2, Wallis offered Presley a contract for one motion picture, with options on six more.<ref name=\"Day by Day-67\"/> The contract was finalized on April 25, and also stipulated that Presley was free to make at least one picture a year for other studios.<ref name=\"Day by Day-67\"/>\n\nWallis, who had produced classics such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'', and ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', had promised Presley that he would look for dramatic roles to let the singer take his acting career seriously.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown; Broeske|first=Peter; Pat|title=Down at the End of Lonely Street: Life and Death of Elvis Presley|year=1998|publisher=Arrow Books Ltd|isbn=978-0-7493-2319-6|page=103}}</ref>\n\nWallis considered Presley for a role in ''[[The Rat Race]]'', a film about a \"naive, innocent boy\" who was struggling to make it as a musician in Manhattan, but he decided against it after another studio executive said, \"Elvis Presley just doesn't look like that\".<ref name=\"brown104\">{{cite book|last=Brown; Broeske|first=Peter; Pat|title=Down at the End of Lonely Street: Life and Death of Elvis Presley|year=1998|publisher=Arrow Books Ltd|isbn=978-0-7493-2319-6|page=104}}</ref> The film was eventually made in 1960 with [[Tony Curtis]] in the lead role. Another possible idea that Wallis mulled over was to pair Presley with [[Jerry Lewis]]. Lewis had just separated from his comedy partner [[Dean Martin]] after a successful run of seventeen movies together, but again the idea was shelved.<ref name=\"brown104\"/>\n\nOn April 10, Presley confidently announced during a radio interview that his debut feature would be ''The Rainmaker'' with [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]].<ref name=\"Day by Day-68\">Guralnick/Jorgensen, ''Elvis:Day by Day'', p.68</ref> However, despite this belief, and due to Wallis being unable to find a project \"good enough for the debut of Elvis Presley\", he was loaned out to ''20th Century Fox'' on August 13 and began work on ''Love Me Tender'' on August 22.<ref name=\"Day by Day-82\">Guralnick/Jorgensen, ''Elvis:Day by Day'', p.82</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film was originally called ''The Reno Brothers'' based on a story by Maurice Geraghty. Fox bought the screen rights in August 1952 and assigned [[Robert L.

A somewhat more realistic film telling the story of the Reno Brothers, ''[[Rage at Dawn]]'' starring [[Randolph Scott]], had been released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] in 1955.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/>\n\nRobert Buckner wrote a script and David Weisbart became a producer with [[Robert D.

It was decided to expand his part and give him some songs to sing.<ref>{{cite news|title=WTOP'S Eddie Gallaher On Records|work=The Washington Post and Times-Herald|date=Oct 21, 1956|page=G18}}</ref><ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nPresley arrived for filming with all of his lines learned, as well as the lines for all the other parts.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/> He found filming quite tasking, once commenting to a friend that he had spent a whole day \"behind a team of mules\".<ref name=Day83>Guralnick/Jorgensen, p. 83</ref> In little more than a month Presley had recorded all the songs for the film and had finished filming his scenes.<ref name=Day84>Guralnick/Jorgensen, p.84</ref>\n\nFilming of the movie's climactic sequence, including the death scene for Presley's character, took place at the Bell Moving Picture Ranch in the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] west of the [[San Fernando Valley]] on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The exact filming location, sometimes referred to among historians as the \"Rocky Hill\", remained elusive for almost 60 years, until the site was discovered on an expedition by filming location researchers in early 2015. The researchers were able to locate the site by combining details from ''Love Me Tender'' and the [[Victor Mature]] movie ''[[Escort West]]'', which also filmed on the \"Rocky Hill.\" Additional details on this expedition can be found in the external links, below.\n\nWeibsart said during the shoot Presley was \"humble, polite, solicitous... He was co operative with us, never late, and very serious about acting. This was another kind of career for him.\"<ref name=\"producer\"/>\n\nWhen Presley appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' during a break in filming the movie, on September 9, he performed \"Love Me Tender\" for the first time.<ref name=Day83/> Two weeks later RCA confirmed that advanced sales of the single had resulted in it going Gold before even being released\u2014an industry first.<ref name=Day84/> (It sold one million copies pre ordered and ultimately ended up selling two million copies.<ref name=\"producer\"/>)\n\nOn 2 September, Fox announced the film's title would be changed from ''The Reno Brothers'' to ''Love Me Tender''.<ref>{{cite news|title=WALD WILL FILM 'THE HARD HATS': Producer Plans Third Movie for Fox--TV Announcer Signs Acting Contract Behind Prison Walls|author=THOMAS M.

Actually he plays an acting part in a legitimate story and he does it very well. He sings but the script is so constructed that the situations are logical... when the family is together after the war.... [or] at a bazar and picnic.

Attempting to reach a compromise between the death and pleasing his fans, Presley filmed an extra scene and recorded an extra verse to the title track to be played over the end credits.<ref name=Day84/>\n\n==Release==\n''Love Me Tender'' premiered on November 15, 1956, at the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]] in New York City, and was released nationally on November 21.<ref name=\"Day By Day-91\"/> Though studios typically released were only 200-300 prints, 20th Century Fox released a record-breaking 575 prints.<ref name=\"Day By Day-91\"/><ref name=az222>''Elvis: His Life from A To Z'', p.222-224</ref> On November 20 Presley attended a private screening at Loew's State Theater in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]],<ref name=\"Day By Day-91\"/> during which his mother, Gladys, cried over the death of her son's character.<ref name=\"Day By Day-91\"/> Presley responded by insisting that his characters never die on screen again.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/>\n\n===Box Office===\nThe film grossed $540,000 in its first week of release, claiming the No. 2 at the box office and earning back the money it cost the studio to produce it.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/><ref name=az222/> James Dean's [[List of works published posthumously|posthumous]] release of ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' held the No. 1 spot.\n \nWithin weeks it had recouped the costs of the negatives and, despite being released in November, was the 23rd highest-grossing film of the year.<ref name=\"Elvis Enc\"/><ref name=az222/>\n\n===Critical reception===\nMany critics gave the film a lukewarm reception, though some viewed it in a positive light.
