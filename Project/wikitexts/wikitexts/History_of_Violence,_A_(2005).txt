It is an adaptation of the 1997 [[A History of Violence (comics)|graphic novel of the same title]] by [[John Wagner]] and [[Vince Locke]]. The film stars [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Maria Bello]], [[William Hurt]], and [[Ed Harris]]. In the film, When a pair of petty criminals attempt to rob his small-town diner, Tom Stall quickly and easily kills them both. In the flush of news coverage of Tom's seemingly heroic actions, a threatening stranger named Carl Fogarty comes to town, fingering the unassuming family man as long-missing Philadelphia mobster Joey Cusack. To the horror of his wife, Edie, and teenage son, Jack, Tom finds he must confront his violent past.\n\n''A History of Violence'' was in the main competition for the 2005 [[Palme d'Or]], and was put into a limited release in the United States on September 23, 2005, followed by a wide release on September 30, 2005. It is sometimes considered one of the greatest films of the 2000s. The film was specifically praised for its performances, screenplay, atmosphere, and plot. William Hurt was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], while Olson was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. Mortensen himself praised it as \"one of the best movies [he's] ever been in, if not the best\", also declaring it was a \"perfect [[film noir]]\" or \"close to perfect\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marrakech-fest-viggo-mortensen-honored-754740 |title=Marrakech Fest: Viggo Mortensen Honored, Praises David Cronenberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 8, 2014 |access-date=December 20, 2014}}</ref> It is also notable as being one of the last major Hollywood films to be released on [[VHS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/22/entertainment/et-vhs-tapes22 |title=VHS era is winding down|work=L.A.

One night, two [[spree killers]] enter Tom's restaurant, threaten those inside, and sexually assault one of his employees. Tom deftly kills them and is hailed a hero, while the incident makes national news.\n\nA few days later, Tom is visited by a man named Carl Fogarty, who alleges that Tom is actually Joey Cusack, a former [[gangster]] with the [[Irish mob]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Tom vehemently denies this, but Carl remains persistent and begins to [[stalking|stalk]] the Stalls. Under pressure, Tom's relationship with Edie, Jack, and Sarah faces continued strain.\n\nFollowing an argument with Tom over the use of violence at school, Jack runs away, only to be captured and held hostage by Carl. Carl confronts Tom and demands his return to Philadelphia in exchange for his son's release. After Jack is freed, Tom manages to kill Carl's henchmen until Carl shoots him. A wounded Tom drops his fa\u00e7ade and manifests his former self, but Jack shoots and kills Carl with a [[shotgun]] before he can fight back.\n\nAt the hospital, a furious Edie confronts Tom, who admits to being Joey Cusack, revealing that he started a new life to escape his criminal past. Tom becomes further isolated from the rest of his family and the community. One day, Tom receives a phone call from his estranged brother, Richie Cusack, who demands his return.\n\nReturning to Philadelphia, Tom learns that his past actions have delayed Richie's advancement with the Irish mob. Tom offers peace, but Richie orders his men to kill his brother. Tom manages to escape from being strangled to death; he kills the gangsters and confronts Richie before shooting him dead. After returning home to find his family eating dinner, Tom is offered food by Jack and Sarah, signaling his acceptance back into their lives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Joey Cusack / Tom Stall\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Edie Stall\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Carl Fogarty\n* [[William Hurt]] as Richie Cusack\n* [[Ashton Holmes]] as Jack Stall\n* [[Peter MacNeill]] as Sheriff Sam Carney\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as Leland Jones\n* [[Greg Bryk]] as Billy Orser\n* [[Kyle Schmid]] as Bobby\n* Sumela Kay as Judy\n* Gerry Quigley as Mick\n* Deborah Drakeford as Charlotte\n* Heidi Hayes as Sarah Stall\n* [[Aidan Devine]] as Charlie Roarke\n* Bill McDonald as Frank Mulligan\n* Michelle McCree as Jenny Wyeth\n* Ian Matthews as Ruben\n* [[R.

Screenwriter Josh Olson intended from the beginning to use the original story as a springboard to explore the themes that interested him.\n\nIn a 2014 interview, Mortensen said he read Olson's original version of the script and \"was quite disappointed. It was 120-odd pages of just mayhem; kind of senseless, really.\" He only agreed to do the movie after meeting with Cronenberg, who (according to Mortensen) reworked the script.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robey |first1=Tim |title=Viggo Mortensen interview: Peter Jackson sacrificed subtlety for CGI |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10826867/Viggo-Mortensen-interview-Peter-Jackson-sacrificed-subtlety-for-CGI.html |website=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=The Telegraph |access-date=13 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211212023255/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10826867/Viggo-Mortensen-interview-Peter-Jackson-sacrificed-subtlety-for-CGI.html |archive-date=December 11, 2021}}</ref>\n\nMost of the film was shot in [[Millbrook, Ontario]].

Both scenes display more blood flowing or gushing out of the victims in the European version. In addition, a more pronounced bone-crushing sound effect is used when Tom stomps on the thug's throat.<ref>''A History of Violence'' DVD Extra: U.S. vs. European.</ref>\n\nA deleted scene, known as \"Scene 44\", features a [[dream sequence]] in the diner, where Fogarty tells Tom he will kill his family and him, to which Tom responds by shooting him with his shotgun at close range. He then approaches Fogarty's mangled body, which raises a gun and shoots him.<ref>''A History of Violence'' DVD Extra: Scene 44.</ref>  In the DVD extras' on-set footage, Mortensen suggests Harris should pull the gun from his chest cavity. Cronenberg, while amused by the idea, rejects it for being too self-referential; he cites a sequence in his film ''[[Videodrome]]'', in which a character pulls a handgun from a slit in his stomach.\n\n===Interpretation===\nThe film's title plays on multiple levels of meaning. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] stated that Cronenberg refers to three possibilities:\n\n{{blockquote|... (1) a suspect with a long history of violence; (2) the historical use of violence as a means of settling disputes, and (3) the innate violence of Darwinian evolution, in which better-adapted organisms replace those less able to cope. \"I am a complete Darwinian\", says Cronenberg, whose new film is in many ways about the survival of the fittest\u2014at all costs.<ref name=\"ebert\"/>}}\n\nCronenberg himself described the film as a meditation on the human body and its relationship to violence:\n\n<blockquote>For me the first fact of human existence is the human body. I'm not an atheist, but for me to turn away from any aspect of the human body to me is a philosophical betrayal. And there's a lot of art and religion whose whole purpose is to turn away from the human body. I feel in my art that my mandate is to not do that. So whether it's beautiful things\u2014the sexuality part, or the violent part or the gooey part\u2014it's just body fluids. It's when Elliott in ''Dead Ringer'' (''sic'') says, \"Why are there no beauty contests for the insides of bodies?\" It's a thought that disturbs me. How can we be disgusted by our own bodies? That really doesn't make any human sense. It makes some animal sense but it doesn't make human sense so I'm always discussing that in my movies and in this movie in particular. I don't ever feel that I've been exploitive in a crude, vulgar way, or just doing it to get attention. It's always got a purpose which I can be very articulate about. In this movie, we've got an audience that's definitely going to applaud these acts of violence and they do because it's set up that these acts are justifiable and almost heroic at times. But I'm saying, \"Okay, if you can applaud that, can you applaud this?\" because this is the result of that gunshot in the head. It's not nice. And even if the violence is justifiable, the consequences of the violence are exactly the same. The body does not know what was the morality of that act. So I'm asking the audience to see if they can contain the whole experience of this violent act instead of just the heroic/dramatic one. I'm saying \"Here's the really nasty effects on these nasty guys but still, the effects are very nasty.\" And that's the paradox and conundrum.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://cinephiliabeyond.org/a-history-of-violence/ |title='A History of Violence': David Cronenberg's Superb Study of the Basic Impulses that Drive Humanity |first=Sven |last=Mikulec |date=October 20, 2020 |archive-date=25 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125202707/https://cinephiliabeyond.org/a-history-of-violence/ |url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Music==\nThe soundtrack to ''A History of Violence'' was released on October 11, 2005.\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| extra_column    = Artist\n| total_length    = 40:19<ref>[http://www.theost.com/2005/a_history_of_violence.html A history of violence Soundtrack] TheOST.
