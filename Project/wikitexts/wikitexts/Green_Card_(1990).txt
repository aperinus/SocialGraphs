The screenplay focuses on an American woman who enters into a [[marriage of convenience]] with a [[French people|Frenchman]] so he can obtain a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] and remain in the United States. Depardieu won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor. The film won the [[Golden Globe]] for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, and was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Best Original Screenplay.\n\n==Plot summary==\nBront\u00eb Parrish ([[Andie MacDowell]]), a [[Horticulture|horticulturalist]] and an [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]], enters into a [[Green Card marriage]] with Georges Faur\u00e9 (Depardieu), an [[Alien (law)|undocumented immigrant]] from France, so he may stay in the United States. In turn, Bront\u00eb uses her fake marriage credentials to rent the apartment of her dreams. After moving in, and in order to explain her spouse's absence, she tells the doorman and neighbors he is conducting musical research in Africa.\n\nContacted by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] for an interview to determine if her marriage is legitimate, Bront\u00eb tracks down Georges, who is working as a waiter. Although the two have little time to get their facts straight, the agents who question them appear to be satisfied with their answers. But when one of the agents asks to use the bathroom and Georges directs him to a closet, their suspicions are aroused, and they schedule a full, formal interview to be conducted two days later at their office.\n\nAdvised by her attorney (Robert Prosky) that she could face criminal charges if their deception is uncovered, Bront\u00eb reluctantly invites Georges to move in with her. They try to learn about each other's past and their quirks and habits but quickly find they can barely tolerate each other. Georges is a fiery-tempered selfish slob and smoker who prefers red meat to vegetarian food, while Bront\u00eb is shown as uptight and cold, obsessed with her plants and wrapped up in [[Environmentalism|environmental issues]].\n\nMeanwhile, the parents of Lauren Adler (Bebe Neuwirth),  Bront\u00eb's best friend, plan to leave New York City and consider donating their trees and plants to the Green Guerrillas, a group overseeing the development of inner-city gardens. Bront\u00eb is invited to a dinner party to discuss the issue and discovers Georges is there, having been asked by Lauren. He so impresses the Adlers with an [[Impressionist music|impressionistic]] [[piano]] piece, set to a poem about children and trees, that they agree to donate their plants to the Green Guerrillas. When Bront\u00eb's parents later arrive at the apartment for an unannounced visit, Georges pretends to be the [[handyman]].\n\nWhen Bront\u00eb's boyfriend Phil (Gregg Edelman) returns from a trip, Georges reveals that he is married to her. Bront\u00eb angrily kicks Georges out, but the pair nonetheless appear at the immigration interview the next day. The two are questioned separately, and when Georges is caught out by the interviewer (Ethan Phillips), he confesses the marriage is a sham. He agrees to [[deportation]] but insists Bront\u00eb not be charged for her role in the charade. He lets Bront\u00eb believe the interview was a success and the two go their separate ways.\n\nA few days later, Georges invites Bront\u00eb to join him at the cafe where they first met. When she notices one of the immigration agents is waiting outside, she realizes Georges is being deported and tries to stop him from being sent away as they've both realized they are in love with each other. Georges promises to write every day asking the same question \"When are you coming, ''ch\u00e9rie''?\", a line he had also used when describing their fabricated courtship to the INS. Just before he leaves with the immigration agent, Bront\u00eb asks if he still has their wedding rings; he pulls them out of his pocket and they quickly exchange rings again, laughing and kissing. Then Georges departs with the agent as Bront\u00eb watches from the sidewalk.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Georges Faur\u00e9\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Bront\u00eb Parrish\n* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Lauren Adler\n* [[Gregg Edelman]] as Phil\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Bront\u00eb's lawyer\n* [[Mary Louise Wilson]] as Mrs. Sheehan \n* [[Lois Smith]] as Bront\u00eb's mother\n* [[Ann Dowd]] as Peggy\n* [[Larry Wright (street drummer)|Larry Wright]] as Larry Wright the bucket drummer\n* [[Ethan Phillips]] as Gorsky\n\n==Production==\nPeter Weir wrote the script, an original, specifically as a vehicle for G\u00e9rard Depardieu to introduce him to a wide English-speaking audience.<ref>Katherine Tucker, \"Peter Weir\", ''Cinema Papers'', August 1990 p 6-10</ref> The film had a similar theme and plot to ''[[The Paper Wedding]]'' (French: ''Les noces de papier''), a 1989 made for television Canadian film directed by [[Michel Brault]], which was subsequently entered into the [[40th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>Marc Horton, \"The movie to see on immigration scams\".
