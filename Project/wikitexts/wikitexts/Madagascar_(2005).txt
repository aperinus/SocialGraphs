The film was directed by [[Eric Darnell]] and [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] (in McGrath's feature directorial debut) and written by [[Mark Burton (writer)|Mark Burton]], [[Billy Frolick]], Darnell, and McGrath. The film stars [[Ben Stiller]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Schwimmer]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], and [[Andy Richter]]. The film centers around a group of animals from the [[Central Park Zoo]] who find themselves stranded on the island of [[Madagascar]].\n\nReleased on May 27, 2005, ''Madagascar'' received mixed reviews from critics but was a success at the box office, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2005. It launched the [[Madagascar (franchise)|''Madagascar'' franchise]] which includes the sequels ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'' (2008) and ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' (2012); the spin-off film ''[[Penguins of Madagascar]]'' (2014); several short films, television series, and specials; and a number of video games, theme park attractions, and live stage shows.\n\n== Plot ==\nA [[zebra]] named Marty lived his entire life at the [[Central Park Zoo]] with his best friends since childhood: a [[lion]] named Alex, who is Marty's best friend, a [[giraffe]] named Melman and a [[hippopotamus]] named Gloria. Alex enjoys showing off for the public and his celebrity status as \"the king of New York\". Marty, on the other hand, has grown bored with his daily routine and longs to experience the wild. On Marty's tenth birthday, Alex, Melman and Gloria attempt to cheer him up, but Marty, still unsatisfied, learns that the zoo's [[penguin]]s\u2014Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private\u2014are trying to escape, and follows them out. Alex, Melman and Gloria pursue Marty and attempt to convince him to return. The four, along with the penguins and two [[chimpanzees]] named Mason and Phil, converge at [[Grand Central Station]] where the authorities sedate them using [[tranquillizer gun]]s. Under pressure from anti-captivity activists, the zoo is forced to ship the escaped animals by sea to a [[Kenya]]n wildlife preserve. During their travels, the penguins escape and take over the ship, intent on taking it to [[Antarctica]]. Their antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria to fall overboard and wash ashore on [[Madagascar]].\n\nThe animals come across a pack of [[lemur]]s led by King Julien XIII. The predatory [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] attack the lemurs, but are scared off by Alex's fearsome appearance. Alex blames Marty for the group's predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, and Gloria and Melman soon join him in enjoying the island. Alex eventually comes around, but without the raw [[steak]]s he was provided at the zoo, hunger sets in and his [[prey drive]] begins to show. King Julien has the lemurs befriend the zoo animals in the hope that Alex's presence will keep the fossa at bay, despite his adviser Maurice's warnings about Alex's predatory nature. When Alex loses control and attacks Marty, King Julien realizes that he is a threat and banishes him to the predator side of the island, where the fossa live. Seeing what Alex has become, and how dangerous the wild can be, Marty begins to regret his decision to leave the zoo.\n\nThe penguins, having found Antarctica to be inhospitable, land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing the chance to return Alex to New York, Marty crosses over to the predator side and attempts to convince the scared, starving Alex to return, but Alex refuses out of fear that he will attack Marty again. The fossa attack Marty, and though Gloria, Melman, and the penguins come to the rescue, they are outnumbered. Alex overcomes his predatory instincts, rescues his friends, and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory forever. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex, and the penguins satisfy his hunger by feeding him [[sushi]]. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to break the news that the ship has run out of fuel, thus leaving them stranded on the island.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:David Schwimmer 2005 Madagascar.jpg|thumb|[[David Schwimmer]] at the film's British premiere in London]]\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Alex, a [[lion]].

The idea was scrapped, but after production on ''Madagascar'' started, director [[Eric Darnell]] decided to revive the penguins, but make them a commando unit instead of a [[rock band]].<ref name=Skwigly>{{cite web|title=Escape from Zoo-York: Behind The Scenes of Madagascar|url=http://www.skwigly.co.uk/behind-the-scenes-of-madagascar/|website=Skwigly|last1=Phillips|first1=Julian|date=November 25, 2005}}</ref> In the original script Gloria was going to be pregnant due to being part of the zoo's breeding program and the baby was going to be born on the island and Melman, who is revealed to have a crush on Gloria would help raise the child like it was his own son. The idea was cut from the final version because the test audiences felt like the pregnancy plotline was too risky and mature for a family film especially young children who felt uncomfortable with the pairing of Melman and Gloria and may have gotten the film a PG-13 rating. However, the idea of Melman having a crush on Gloria was reused for the sequels. One of the lead characters was formerly to be an [[okapi]]. As a result, the character, Melman, was changed and played by a [[giraffe]] which is a more familiar animal. Originally, Julien was intended to be a minor character with only two lines. However, when [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] auditioned for the role, he improvised not only an Indian accent, but eight minutes of dialogue for his recording. The filmmakers found Cohen's performance so funny that they rewrote the script and made Julien a much more prominent character in the story as \"King of the Lemurs\".\n\n== Home media ==\n''Madagascar'' was released on DVD and VHS on November 15, 2005, by [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks Home Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite news|title=DreamWorks Launches Multi-Million Campaign For Madagascar DVD|url=http://www.chiefmarketer.com/special-reports-chief-marketer/dreamworks-launches-multi-million-campaign-for-madagascar-dvd-25082005|access-date=January 19, 2014|newspaper=Chief Marketer|date=August 25, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Arnold|url=http://hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=7909|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123150326/http://hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=7909|title=DreamWorks Puts Big Money Behind 'Madagascar'|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archive-date=November 23, 2005|date=August 18, 2005|access-date=September 22, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The DVD included a short animated film ''[[The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper]]'', and a music video \"I Like to Move It,\" featuring characters from the film dancing to the song.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ziebarth|first=Christian|title=Madagascar DVD bonus features review|url=http://animatedviews.com/2005/madagascar-dvd-bonus-features-review/|access-date=January 19, 2014|newspaper=Animated Views|date=November 14, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McCutcheon|first=David|title=Madagascar|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/08/madagascar|access-date=January 19, 2014|newspaper=IGN|date=December 8, 2005}}</ref> A Blu-ray version of the film was released on September 23, 2008.\n\nThe ''Madagascar - Movie Storybook'' was written by [[Billy Frolick]] and illustrated by Michael Koelsch, and was published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] in 2005.<ref name=\":23\">{{Cite book|last=Frolick|first=Billy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak2DHAAACAAJ|title=Madagascar: Movie Storybook|date=2005|publisher=Scholastic|isbn=978-0-439-69627-2|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":111\">{{Cite book|last1=Frolick|first1=Billy|url=http://archive.org/details/madagascarmovies00frol|title=Madagascar : movie storybook|last2=Frolick|first2=Billy|last3=Koelsch Studios|date=2005|publisher=New York : Scholastic Inc.|others=Internet Archive|isbn=978-0-439-69627-2}}</ref> Koelsch also illustrated the [[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa|''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa - Movie Storybook'']] in 2008.<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last1=Flexer|first1=Michael J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e8wMptcsymUC|title=Madagascar: the Crate Escape - Movie Storybook|last2=Hamashima|first2=Lawrence|date=2008|publisher=HarperCollins Children's Books|isbn=978-0-00-728436-8|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\nThe film was a commercial success.
