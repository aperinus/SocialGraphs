Wintergreen is an experienced patrolman looking to be transferred to the Homicide unit. When he is informed by Crazy Willie of an apparent suicide-by-shotgun, Wintergreen believes the case is actually a murder as the victim has shot himself in the chest rather than the head, which is more usual. Detective Harve Poole agrees it is a homicide, after a [[.22 bullet]] is found amongst the pellets in the man's chest during the autopsy, as well as hearing about a possible missing $5,000 (${{Inflation|US|5000|1973|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) from the man's home, and arranges for Wintergreen to be transferred to homicide to help with the case.\n\nWintergreen gets his wish, but his joy is short-lived. He begins increasingly to identify with the [[hippie]]s whom the other officers, including Detective Poole, are endlessly harassing. The final straw comes when Poole discovers that Wintergreen has been sleeping with his girlfriend, Jolene. The hostile [[workplace politics]] cause him to be quickly demoted back to traffic enforcement.\n\nDespite being demoted, Wintergreen is able to solve the murder. The killer turns out to be Willie, who confesses while Wintergreen goads him into talking about it. Wintergreen surmises that Willie did it because he was jealous of the old man he killed, who frequently had young people over to his house to buy drugs. Shortly after, it is discovered that Zipper stole the $5,000, which he used to buy a fully dressed [[Electra Glide]] motorcycle. Wintergreen is forced to shoot Zipper after he becomes distressed and belligerent, and shoots at Wintergreen and in the direction of two innocent bystanders, hitting one of them.\n\nWintergreen, now alone and back on his old beat, runs into a hippie that Zipper was needlessly harassing earlier on a previous stop. Recognizing him, Wintergreen lets him off with a warning, but the hippie forgets his driver's license, and Wintergreen drives up behind his van to return it to him. The hippie's passenger points a shotgun out of the back window and shoots Wintergreen, killing him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] as Officer John Wintergreen\n* [[Billy \"Green\" Bush]] as Officer Zipper Davis\n* [[Mitchell Ryan]] as Det.

During their discussions, it transpired that Guercio and Hall disagreed on how the film should look; a compromise was reached where Guercio would shoot the exterior scenes in a manner reminiscent of [[John Ford]]'s films (which was the look Guercio wanted to achieve), while Hall could set up and shoot all the film's interior scenes any way he saw fit. According to the DVD commentary, Guercio claims that a majority of the film was shot without permits, because the [[Arizona Highway Patrol]] would not cooperate with production. The movie was filmed in [[Monument Valley]] and [[Fountain Hills, Arizona]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=D'Arc |first1=James V. |title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah |date=2010 |publisher=Gibbs Smith |location=Layton, UT |isbn=9781423605874 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nPrior to production an LAPD Motor Officer (Gerald L. Ray) was hired to teach Blake how to properly ride a Police Motorcycle.  They spent more than a month riding replicas of Police Motorcycles around the Van Nuys area.  Production was several days behind schedule due to Guercio's inexperience as a director.  In Blake's 2012 autobiography ''Tales From a Rascal'', he refers to this film as being a very tough shoot and that he essentially co-directed the picture with Hall while Guercio \"stood around\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blake |first1=Robert |title=Tales From a Rascal: What I Did For Love |date=2012 |publisher=Black Rainbow Publications |isbn=978-0615591940 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nGuercio was best known as the producer of the rock band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]].<ref name=NYT2>{{cite web |title=Electra Glide in Blue Overview |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/15542/Electra-Glide-in-Blue/overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407063601/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/15542/Electra-Glide-in-Blue/overview|url-status=dead|department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]] |author=Mark Deming |date=2014 |archive-date=2014-04-07}}</ref> Members of the band appear in the film in minor roles,<ref name=NYT2/> including [[Peter Cetera]],<ref name=NYT3>{{cite web |title=Electra Glide in Blue Cast |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/15542/Electra-Glide-in-Blue/cast|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308003500/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/15542/Electra-Glide-in-Blue/cast|url-status=dead|department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]] |date=2016 |archive-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> [[Terry Kath]],<ref name=NYT2/> [[Lee Loughnane]]<ref name=NYT3/> and [[Walter Parazaider]],<ref name=NYT3/> as well as [[Hawk Wolinski]]<ref name=NYT3/> from the Guercio-produced band [[Madura (rock band)|Madura]].
