It features very little spoken dialogue. Its sparse plot and visual style have led to it being described as \"animated art rather than a story\".{{sfn|Ruh|2004|p=47}}\n\n==Plot==\n''Angel's Egg'' follows the life of an unnamed young girl living alone in an undefined building near an abandoned city.  She cares for a large egg which she hides under her dress, protecting it while scavenging the decrepit [[Neo-Gothic]]/[[Art Nouveau]] cityscape for food, water and bottles. In the prologue, an unnamed boy in militant garb watches an orb-shaped vessel covered with thousands of goddess-like sculptures descend from the sky. Awakened by the orb's whistles, the girl begins her day of scavenging, but soon crosses paths with the boy on a wide street traveled only by [[Biomechanical art|biomechanical]] roving tanks. Frightened by the boy, who carries a cross-shaped device over his shoulder, the girl runs off down an alley. When she returns to investigate, the boy has left. She resumes searching for food and glass bottles, avoiding the statuesque figures of men clutching harpoons.\n\nLater, the girl spots the boy again and approaches him. He turns and surprisingly produces her egg from underneath his cape; she had abandoned it on the plaza where she was eating. He instructs the girl to \"Keep precious things inside you or you will lose them,\" and returns the egg.  When asked what she believes is inside the egg, the girl asserts that she can't tell him. The boy then suggests breaking the egg to find out, which incenses the girl and drives her away, only to be pursued by the boy.\n\nEventually the chase gives way to the pair bonding, as the stoic fishermen figures spring to life and frighten the girl. The fishermen race after enormous shadows of [[coelacanth]]-like fish that swim across the surfaces of streets and buildings. The animated men ineffectually lob their harpoons at the shadows, hitting only brick and stone. As the shadows swim away, the girl explains that while the fish are gone, the men persist in hunting. The pair wait out the commotion within a vast cathedral decorated with stained windows of fish.\n\nLeaving the city and heading towards the girl's settlement, the pair stop within a massive structure which appears to be the carcass of a beached [[leviathan]]. Noticing an engraving of a tree on a pillar, the boy describes his memory of a similar tree which grew to hold a giant egg containing a sleeping bird. When the girl inquires as to what the bird dreams of, the boy flatly asks if the girl still won't tell him what's inside her egg. The pair ascend a staircase arrayed with bottles of water, like those the girl collects, on each step. Adding her newest tribute to the line of bottles, the girl and boy reflect on their amnesia, wondering about their identity and purpose. The boy begins to recount the biblical tale of [[Noah's Ark]]. The tale deviates when the boy claims that the dove never returned to the ark, and thus its passengers forgot why they were sailing, forgot about the civilization drowned below, forgot about the animals who, as a result, turned to stone.\n\nThe boy asks the girl if they themselves or if the strange world they live in really exists, or if it is merely a memory like his image of the sleeping bird. The girl suddenly insists that the bird does exist, and leads the boy down corridors of ancient fossils to arrive at an aerie. There they find the skeleton of a giant, angelic bird. The girl explains her intent to hatch the egg.\n\nLater, the pair warm themselves within the girl's settlement. As the girl drifts off to sleep, she speaks to the creature inside her egg of their future together. Outside, the heavy rain consumes the city and floods the streets. While the girl is turned away from the egg in her sleep, the boy takes it and smashes it, leaving  afterwards. The next day, the girl discovers the broken shell of her egg and shrieks out, utterly heartbroken. She starts to run away from her settlement into the woods, past a giant tree holding a huge egg, in pursuit of the boy. In her haste, she falls into a ravine. Beneath the chasm's water, the girl transforms into an adult woman before releasing a final breath, which rises to the surface as a multitude of bobbing eggs.\n\nAs the rain suddenly abates, trees holding eggs like those described by the boy are shown to be scattered throughout the landscape. The boy stands on a vast shore littered with white feathers as the orb-like vessel rises from underneath the ocean. Among the thousands of statues adorning the orb is a new feature: a figure of the girl, sitting serenely on a throne and caressing the egg in her lap. The screen slowly zooms out to reveal that the land of the beach, the forest, and the city is part of a small and lonely island within a vast sea, appearing not unlike the hull of an overturned ship.\n\n==Voice actors==\n*[[Jinpachi Nezu]] - Boy\n*[[Mako Hy\u014dd\u014d]] - Girl\n\nNezu worked with Oshii once again in ''[[Patlabor 2: The Movie]]''<ref name=\"allcinema-patlabor2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=89848|title=\u6a5f\u52d5\u8b66\u5bdf\u30d1\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\uff12 the Movie|trans-title=Mobile Police Patlabor 2: The Movie|language=ja|access-date=May 17, 2016|publisher=Stingray - AllCinema Movie and DVD Database}}</ref> and Mako Hy\u014dd\u014d played a supporting role in ''[[The Sky Crawlers (film)|The Sky Crawlers]]''.<ref name=\"allcinema-skycrawlers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=328359|title=\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30fb\u30af\u30ed\u30e9 The Sky Crawlers|language=ja|access-date=May 17, 2016|publisher=Stingray - AllCinema Movie and DVD Database}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nPrior to the production on ''Angel's Egg'', Mamoru Oshii lost his faith in Christianity.<ref name=\"soc-oshii\" /> ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' opined that the film \"seems informed by the existential desperation caused by the collapse of one's belief system\";<ref name=\"soc-oshii\" /> Oshii himself has stated he does not know what the film is about.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=75}}\n\nThe film repurposes ideas that Oshii developed for a cancelled ''[[Lupin the Third]]'' film (which later became ''[[Legend of the Gold of Babylon]]''); both concepts focus on a mysterious girl, while the angel's egg is based on the cancelled film's angel fossil.<ref>\u300c\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u62bc\u4e95\u5b88 \u5e7b\u306e\u62bc\u4e95\u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u306f\u300e\u865a\u69cb\u3092\u76d7\u3080\u300f\u306f\u305a\u3060\u3063\u305f\u300d\u300eTHE\u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u4e09\u4e16FILES \u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u4e09\u4e16\u5168\u8a18\u9332 \u301c\u5897\u88dc\u6539\u8a02\u7248\u301c\u300f\u30ad\u30cd\u30de\u65ec\u5831\u793e\u30011998\u5e74\u3001p.36</ref>\n\n==Production and release==\n''Angel's Egg'' was a collaboration between Oshii and Amano.{{sfn|Ruh|2004|p=46}} The animation was produced by [[Studio DEEN]], with [[Hiroshi Hasegawa]], [[Masao Kobayashi]], Mitsunori Miura, and [[Yutaka Wada]] working as producers.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=225}} Oshii and Amano collaborated on the script,{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=225}} and Yoshihiro Kanno composed the music.\n\n''Angel's Egg'' was released in the [[direct-to-video]] format on 15 December 1985 by [[Tokuma Shoten]].{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=225}}<ref name=\"apdn1999\">{{cite book|title=Animage Pocket Data Notes 1999|editor1-first=Masahiro|editor1-last=Haraguchi|publisher=[[Tokuma Shoten]]|language=ja|script-chapter=ja:\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u7de8 \u305f|trans-chapter= Video Releases: Ta|page=130|date=March 10, 1999}}</ref> The 71-minute [[OVA]] would later be used as the skeleton for the 1987 live-action independent film ''[[In the Aftermath]]'' directed by [[Carl Colpaert]].{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=75}}{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=81}} Colpaert's movie occasionally intercuts with footage from Oshii's ''Angel's Egg'' with dubbed over dialogue, which does not appear in Oshii's film.{{sfn|Cavallaro|2006|p=82}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Angel's Egg'' did not do well with critics on its release, and Oshii stated that \"it kept him from getting work for years\".{{sfn|Ruh|2004|p=51}} However, it is considered \"one of the highlights of 'artistic' anime and [his] career as a director.\"{{sfn|Ruh|2004|p=46}} Brian Ruh, a critical analyst of Japanese popular culture, stated that it was \"one of the most beautiful and lyric films in the animated medium.\"{{sfn|Ruh|2004|p=47}}\n\n[[Helen McCarthy]] called it \"an early masterpiece of symbolic film-making\", stating that \"its surreal beauty and slow pace created a Zen-like atmosphere, unlike any other anime\".{{sfn|McCarthy|2009|p=39}} In his book ''Horror and Science Fiction Film IV'', Donald C Willis described the film as \"a haunting, poetic melancholic science-fantasy film, and\u2013for non-Japanese-speaking viewers at least\u2013a very cryptic one.\"{{sfn|Willis|1997|p=20}} Willis also included the film in his list of most memorable films from 1987-1997.{{sfn|Willis|1997|p=viii}}\n\nBakanow.com called it \"Angel's Egg is a real Rorschach test, and the viewer may get one of the multiple meanings behind this beautiful film.
