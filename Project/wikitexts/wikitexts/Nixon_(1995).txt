Vajna]]. The film was written by Stone, [[Christopher Wilkinson]], and Stephen J. Rievele, with significant contributions from \"project consultants\" Christopher Scheer and Robert Scheer. The film tells the story of the political and personal life of former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]], played by [[Anthony Hopkins]].\n\nThe film portrays Nixon as a complex and, in many respects, admirable, though deeply flawed, person. ''Nixon'' begins with a disclaimer that the film is \"an attempt to understand the truth [...] based on numerous public sources and on an incomplete historical record.\"\n\nThe cast includes [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Joan Allen]], [[Annabeth Gish]], [[Marley Shelton]], [[Bai Ling]], [[Powers Boothe]], [[J. T. Walsh]], [[E. G. Marshall]], [[James Woods]], [[Paul Sorvino]], [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Larry Hagman]], [[Ed Harris]] and [[David Hyde Pierce]], plus archival appearances from political figures such as President [[Bill Clinton]] in television footage from the Nixon funeral service.\n\nThe film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $13.7&nbsp;million against a $44&nbsp;million budget, but received mostly positive reviews from critics, with Hopkins' performance receiving particular praise. The film was nominated for four [[68th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Anthony Hopkins), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Joan Allen), [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] (John Williams) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].\n\nThis was Stone's second of three films about the American presidency, made four years after ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', about the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], and followed 13 years later by ''[[W. (film)|W.]]'', about [[George W. Bush]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2022}}\nIn 1972, the [[White House Plumbers]] break into [[Watergate complex|The Watergate]] and are subsequently arrested.\n\nEighteen months later in December 1973, [[Richard Nixon]]'s Chief of Staff, [[Alexander Haig]], brings Nixon audio tapes for Nixon to listen to. The two men discuss the [[Watergate scandal]] and the resulting chaos. After discussing the death of [[J. Edgar Hoover]], Nixon uses profanity when discussing [[John Dean]], [[James W. McCord Jr.|James McCord]], and others involved in Watergate. As Haig turns to leave, Nixon asks Haig why he has not been given a pistol to commit suicide like an honorable soldier.\n\nA majority of the movie is told through flashbacks of Nixon's tapes.\n\nNixon starts the taping system, which triggers memories that begin a series of flashbacks within the film. The first begins on June 23, 1972, about one week after the break-in, during a meeting with [[H. R. Haldeman]], [[John Ehrlichman]] and Dean. Ehrlichman and Dean leave, and Nixon speaks the \"[[Watergate scandal#\"Smoking Gun\" tape|smoking gun]]\" tape to Haldeman.\n\n[[Henry Kissinger]] plays a major role in the film. First, as a respected professor and later as [[National Security Adviser]] and [[Secretary of State]]. Throughout the film, there is a battle with Nixon and his staff over who Kissinger actually is \u2013 is he a leaker who only cares about his reputation in the press, or is he a loyal subject who follows the president's orders? Although many cabinet members blame Kissinger for the leaks, Nixon cannot turn his back on him.\n\nWhile at the height of his political career, Nixon thinks back to childhood and how his parents raised him and his brothers. Two of his brothers died of tuberculosis at a young age and this deeply impacted the president.\n\nThe film covers most aspects of Nixon's life and political career and implies that he and his wife abused [[Alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] and [[Prescription drug|prescription medications]]. Nixon's health problems, including his bout of [[phlebitis]] and [[pneumonia]] during the Watergate crisis, are also shown; his heavy use of medications is sometimes attributed to these.\n\nThe film also hints at some kind of responsibility, real or imagined, that Nixon felt towards the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] through references to the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the implication being that the mechanisms set into place for the invasion by Nixon during his term as [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s vice president spiraled out of control to culminate in [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]] and, eventually, Watergate.\n\nThe film ends with [[Richard Nixon's resignation speech|Nixon's resignation]] and departure from the lawn of the White House on the helicopter, [[Marine One]]. Real-life footage of [[Death and state funeral of Richard Nixon|Nixon's state funeral]] in [[Yorba Linda, California]] plays out over the extended end credits, and all living ex-presidents at the time\u2014[[Gerald Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[George H. W. Bush]]\u2014as well then-president [[Bill Clinton]], are shown in attendance.\n\n==Cast==\n===First family===\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Richard Nixon]]\n* [[Joan Allen]] as [[Pat Nixon]]\n* [[Annabeth Gish]] as [[Julie Nixon Eisenhower]]\n* [[Marley Shelton]] as [[Tricia Nixon Cox]]\n\n===White House staff and cabinet===\n* [[James Woods]] as [[H.

He pitched the film to [[Warner Bros.]], but, according to the director, they saw it, \"as a bunch of unattractive older white men sitting around in suits, with a lot of dialogue and not enough action\".<ref name= \"mcguire\"/>\n\nIn 1993, Hamburg mentioned the idea of a Nixon film to writer Stephen J. Rivele with the concept being that they would incorporate all of the politician's misdeeds, both known and speculative.<ref name= \"hamburg\"/> Rivele liked the idea and had previously thought about writing a play exploring the same themes. Hamburg encouraged Rivele to write a film instead and with his screenwriting partner, Christopher Wilkinson, they wrote a treatment in November 1993.<ref name= \"hamburg\"/> They conceived of a concept referred to as \"the Beast\", which Wilkinson describes as \"a headless monster that lurches through postwar history,\" a metaphor for a system of dark forces that resulted in the assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Robert F.

He also interviewed [[Robert McNamara]], a former Secretary of Defense under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. The director also hired [[Alexander Butterfield]], a key figure in the Watergate scandal who handled the flow of paper to the President, as a consultant to make sure that the Oval Office was realistically depicted,<ref name= \"hamburg\"/> former deputy White House counsel [[John Sears (political strategist)|John Sears]], and [[John Dean]], who made sure that every aspect of the script was accurate and wrote a few uncredited scenes for the film.<ref name= \"hamburg\"/> Butterfield also appears in a few scenes as a White House staffer. To research their roles, Powers Boothe, David Hyde Pierce and Paul Sorvino talked to their real-life counterparts, but J.T. Walsh decided not to contact [[John Ehrlichman]] because he had threatened to sue after reading an early version of the script and was not happy with how he was portrayed.<ref name= \"mcguire\"/> Hopkins watched a lot of documentary footage on Nixon.

They wanted [[Tom Hanks]] or [[Jack Nicholson]] \u2013 two of Stone's original choices. The director also considered [[Gene Hackman]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Tommy Lee Jones]].

Of Hopkins, Stone said, \"The isolation of Tony is what struck me. The loneliness.

Kennedy]].<ref name= \"wilner\"/> The facts contained in the script were based on research from various sources, including documents, transcripts and hours of footage from the Nixon White House. Dean said about the film's accuracy: \"In the larger picture, it reflected accurately what happened.\"<ref name= \"weinraub\"/> Stone addressed the criticism of fictional material in the film, saying, \"The material we invented was not done haphazardly or whimsically, it was based on research and interpretation.\"<ref name= \"carnes\"/> [[John H.
