Avildsen]].<ref name=\"8 Seconds\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18442/8-Seconds/full-credits.html|title=8 Seconds|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|location=United States|access-date=March 31, 2018}}</ref> Its title refers to the length of time a bull rider is required to stay on for a ride to be scored. It stars [[Luke Perry]] as American [[rodeo]] legend [[Lane Frost]] and focuses on his life and career as a [[bull riding]] champion. It also features [[Stephen Baldwin]] as [[Tuff Hedeman]], and Red Mitchell as [[Cody Lambert]].\n\nThe film was completed and premiered shortly after what would have been Frost's 30th birthday, in late 1993.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile growing up in [[Oklahoma]], young [[Lane Frost]] learns the tricks of the [[bull riding]] trade at the hand of his father Clyde, an accomplished rodeo bronco rider himself. As he enters his teenage and early adult years, Lane travels the western rodeo circuit with his best friends [[Tuff Hedeman]] and [[Cody Lambert]]. He meets and falls in love with a young [[barrel racer]], Kellie Kyle, and they eventually marry in 1984.\n\nAs Lane's legend and fame increase, so does the amount of pressure he puts on himself, to be what everyone wants him to be, and he wants to show that he is as good as they say he is. His ascent to the world championship is marred by a cheating incident, questions about Kellie's devotion, and a near broken neck. The film also follows him through the true life series between himself and Red Rock, a bull that no cowboy had ever been able to stay on for 8 seconds. It cuts the series down to three rides. In 1989, he is the second-to-last rider at the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo. While riding on the bull known as \"Takin' Care Of Business\", he dismounts after his 8-second ride but the bull turns back and hits him in the side with his horn, breaking some ribs and severing a main artery. As a result of excessive internal bleeding, he dies on the arena floor before he can be transported to the hospital.\n\nThe final scene shows Hedeman later that same year at the [[National Finals Rodeo]] riding for the world championship. After the 8 second bell sounds, he continues to ride and stays on an additional 8 seconds as a tribute to his fallen best friend.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Luke Perry]] as [[Lane Frost]]\n** [[Cameron Finley]] as young Lane Frost\n* [[Stephen Baldwin]] as [[Tuff Hedeman]]\n* Red Mitchell as [[Cody Lambert]]\n* [[Cynthia Geary]] as Kellie Kyle Frost\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Clyde Frost\n* [[Carrie Snodgress]] as Elsie Frost\n* [[Linden Ashby]] as Martin Hudson\n* [[Ronnie Claire Edwards]] as Carolyn Kyle\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Buckle Bunny\n* [[George Michael (sportscaster)|George Michael]] as Himself\n* [[Brooks & Dunn]] as Themselves\n* [[McBride & the Ride]] as Themselves\n* [[Vince Gill]] as Himself\n* [[Karla Bonoff]] as Herself\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in mainly in [[Boerne, Texas]], [[Del Rio, Texas]], Tucson Rodeo Grounds, [[San Antonio]] and [[Pendleton, Oregon]] and a handful of other minor locations.<ref name=\"ORfilm\">{{cite web|url=http://library.state.or.us/repository/2015/201505210910074/2015.pdf|title=Filmed in Oregon 1908-2015|work=Oregon Film Council|publisher=Oregon State Library|access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Release==\n''8 Seconds'' was released in the United States on February 25, 1994.
