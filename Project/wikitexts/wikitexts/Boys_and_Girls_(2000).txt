The two main characters, Ryan ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) and Jennifer ([[Claire Forlani]]), meet each other initially as adolescents, and later realize that their lives are intertwined through fate.\n\n==Plot==\n12-year-old Jennifer Burrows and 11-year-old Ryan Walker meet aboard an airplane and are immediately at odds. Four years later, Ryan is the mascot at his high school, while Jennifer is elected Homecoming Queen at hers. During the halftime ceremony between their two schools, Ryan is chased by the rival mascot and loses his mascot head, only to find it run over by Jennifer's ceremonial car. Jennifer later finds Ryan and tries to console him about his costume. They part ways once more, realizing they are too different.\n\nA year later, Ryan and Jennifer are students at [[UC Berkeley]]. Ryan is in a steady relationship with his high school sweetheart Betty, and Jennifer is living with a musician. Ryan and Betty break up after realizing their differences. Ryan meets his roommate Hunter, aka Steve, a self-described ladies' man with countless elaborate (and unsuccessful) ploys for sleeping with women.\n\nJennifer moves in with her best friend Amy after she and her boyfriend break up. Ryan and Amy start going out, and he renews his friendship with Jennifer, even after Amy has her \"breakup\" with him for her. They take walks, console each other over break-ups, and gradually become best friends. Jennifer even talks Ryan into dating again, as he starts seeing a girl named Megan.\n\nOne night, in a cynical mood towards love, Jennifer breaks down and Ryan tries to console her. To their equal surprise, they have sex. Afraid of commitment, Jennifer says that sleeping together was a mistake, and that they should pretend it never happened. Hurt and lovesick, Ryan breaks up with Megan and withdraws into his studies.\n\nAs months pass, Jennifer graduates and readies herself to travel to [[Italy]]. She encounters Ryan, whom she has not seen since their night together, at a hilltop overlooking the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Ryan confesses his feelings towards her, but she tells him that she does not feel the same way. He wishes her well in Italy, and leaves.\n\nOn the shuttle to the airport, Jennifer passes the same hilltop where they used to spend time together and realizes that she indeed loves Ryan. She immediately races back to her apartment and finds Amy frantically getting dressed to greet her. Steve confidently strolls out of Amy's bedroom and tells Jennifer that Ryan is heading back to [[Los Angeles]] on an airplane.\n\nWhile waiting for departure, Ryan hears Jennifer confess her love for him in [[Latin]]. After some convincing, and feeling the wrath of a flight attendant, they rekindle their romance where they first met \u2014 on an airplane.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|* [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] as Ryan Walker\n** [[Brendon Ryan Barrett]] as young Ryan \n* [[Claire Forlani]] as Jennifer Burrows\n** Raquel Beaudene as young Jennifer\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Hunter / Steve\n* [[Amanda Detmer]] as Amy\n* [[Heather Donahue]] as Megan\n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as Betty\n* [[Monica Arnold]] as Katie\n* [[Matt Schulze]] as Paul\n* Gay Thomas as N.Y.

Iscove said Prinze \"wanted to blow away that good-looking guy image and grow as an actor\" by playing a geek. Prinze said, \"Most people won't give me a chance to play something different than the good-looking guy. But I love trying new things; I love doing something I haven't done before, and the chance to play a geek was the reason I accepted this role in the first place.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Koltnow |first1=Barry |date=14 June 2000 |title=Freddie's ready for stardom MOVIES: Freddie Prinze Jr. goes against the leading-man career track by playing a geek in 'Boys and Girls' |work=[[Orange County Register]]}}</ref>\n\nPrinze added, \"I set out a goal when I was making ''She's All That'' to do three movies for a specific generation...I did ''She's All That'', ''[[Down to You]]'', and ''Boys and Girls''.

Forlani said she was given minimal notices to do it, saying \"They literally pull me into this room with 30 dancers who for two days have been learning a routine that I have to learn in half an hour. And it was really complicated, too. I was in the corner \u2026 and they ordered like, the Gap kids \u2026 and I thought, 'Oh f***, I'm doomed! And Freddie said, 'Oh, I can do it.'
