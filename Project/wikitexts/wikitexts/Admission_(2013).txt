(VIDEO) |website=Slate.com |date=2012-11-16 |access-date=2013-02-02}}</ref> It is an adaptation of [[Jean Hanff Korelitz]]'s 2009 novel of the same name.\n\n==Plot==\nStraight-laced [[Princeton University]] [[University and college admission|Admissions Officer]] Portia Nathan ([[Tina Fey]]) is caught off guard while making a recruiting visit to an [[alternative high school]] overseen by a former college classmate, the free-wheeling John Pressman ([[Paul Rudd]]). With vast experience in the coaching, consoling, and criticism involving Princeton's admission, she pays a visit to the Quest School, where John teaches while raising an adopted son. After exposing Portia to outspoken Quest students' impressions of college, he takes her to meet the rather unconventional Jeremiah Balakian, a [[child prodigy]].\n\nBack on campus, Portia's longtime boyfriend Mark breaks up with her after impregnating a \"[[Virginia Woolf]] scholar\" named Helen. After an awkward romantic attraction to Pressman, she arranges for Jeremiah to visit Princeton, where she and a colleague, Corinne, are rivals to succeed the soon-to-retire Dean of Admissions.\n\nPortia long ago had a secret pregnancy, putting the baby up for adoption, and is shown apparent proof by Pressman that Jeremiah is hers.  Although he is brilliant, Jeremiah's miserable [[Transcript (education)|transcript]] results in his being deemed unfit to attend the University. Portia, in an act that greatly endangers her position, schemes to gain Jeremiah entrance into the school, knowing that Princeton cannot reveal such a scandal.\n\nHer resignation is demanded. Later, when revealing to Jeremiah that she is his biological mother, she finds out that there was a photocopy mistake on his birth certificate and that the boy has already located his actual [[Parent#Biological parents and parental testing|biological mother]]. Portia appears at the Adoption Agency, trying to locate her son, where she describes her life with a different perspective. When asked how would she feel to meet her actual child, she replies that she would feel \"nervous, but lucky.\"\n\nIn the end, now dating Pressman, she receives a letter about her son, which says he is not ready to meet her yet. Pressman points out to her that she is on the waitlist \"... and that's not so bad.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Portia Nathan\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as John Pressman\n* [[Michael Sheen]] as Mark\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Susannah\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Clarence\n* [[Nat Wolff]] as Jeremiah Balakian\n* [[Gloria Reuben]] as Corinne\n* Travaris Spears as Nelson\n* [[Christopher Evan Welch]] as Brandt\n* [[Sonya Walger]] as Helen\n* [[Leigha Hancock]] as Yulia Karasov\n* [[Dan Levy (TV personality)|Dan Levy]] as James\n\n==Production==\nThe film was directed by [[Paul Weitz (filmmaker)|Paul Weitz]], known for his work on ''[[About a Boy (film)|About a Boy]]'', and was based on the novel of the same name by [[Jean Hanff Korelitz]].
