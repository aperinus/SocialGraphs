Bailey is fishing with Ann Miller. They are in love. (Her lifelong friend Jim is jealous.) The Kid, Jeff's deaf-mute employee and friend, interrupts them, [[American Sign Language|signing]] to Jeff. At the station, Stefanos tells Jeff that he must go to [[Lake Tahoe]] to meet \"Whit.\" Jeff invites Ann to ride with him. He tells her about his past in a flashback.\n\nBailey's real last name is Markham. He and Jack Fisher were partners, [[private investigator]]s in New York. Whit Sterling, a gambling kingpin, hires Markham\u2014solo\u2014to find Whit's girlfriend, Kathie Moffat, who shot him and stole $40,000. Whit promises she will not be harmed.\n\nJeff eventually corners Kathie in [[Acapulco]]. She seduces him. She admits that she shot Whit, but denies taking his money. Eventually, Jeff proposes that they run away together. Whit and Stefanos arrive. Jeff says that Kathie is on a south-bound steamer. Whit instructs Jeff to keep looking for her.\n\nThe couple flee to [[San Francisco]]. Fisher, now working for Whit, spots Jeff at the track. Jeff arranges to meet Kathie at a mountain cabin, but Fisher follows Kathie and tries to blackmail them. The two men brawl. Kathie deliberately kills Fisher and drives away, leaving behind a bank book showing a balance of $40,000.\n\n[[File:Out of The Past 1947.JPG|thumb|right|Mitchum and Greer]]\n\nThe flashback ends. Jeff wants to clean things up and return to Ann. Ann leaves him at Whit's estate. A cheerful Whit tells Jeff he has a job for him. Jeff is startled when Kathie appears at breakfast. She comes to his room; he tells her to get out.\n\n[[File:OutOfThePastMitchumGreer.jpg|left|thumb|Mitchum and Greer]]\n\nLeonard Eels, a crooked San Francisco lawyer, helped Whit dodge $1 million in taxes and is [[blackmail]]ing him. Whit wants Jeff to recover the incriminating records. Eels' secretary, Meta Carson, explains the plan to Jeff, who suspects he is being framed. That night, at Eels' apartment, Jeff alerts Eels, obliquely, promising to return. After they leave, Jeff trails Meta, then returns and finds Eels dead. He hides the body.\n\nIn Meta's apartment, Jeff overhears Kathie arranging for the discovery of Eels' body. When the hidden body is not found, she believes Eels has escaped. Jeff confronts her and Kathie reveals that she gave Whit a signed [[affidavit]] swearing that Jeff killed Fisher. She says they can start all over again. They kiss, he leaves. Stefanos arrives and confirms that he killed Eels.\n\nJeff consigns the tax papers to a delivery service. Whit's thugs capture him. He offers the incriminating records in exchange for the affidavit, without implicating Kathie. When Kathie and Meta arrive at Eels' apartment to retrieve the affidavit, the police are already there. They instead phone Whit.\n\nJeff becomes wanted for the murders of Fisher and Eels and police expect him to return to Bridgeport. Stefanos, directed by Kathie, trails the Kid to the gorge where Jeff is hiding out. The Kid spots Stefanos poised to shoot Jeff and hooks his coat with a fishing line, accidentally pulls him over to his death. Jeff returns to Whit's mansion to inform them of Stefanos death and to tell Whit about Kathie's doublecross. He suggests making Stefanos' death look like a guilt-ridden suicide after his murder of Eels. He will return the records if Whit destroys Kathie's affidavit and hands her over to the police for Fisher's death. Whit accepts, promising Kathie he will kill her if she does not cooperate.\n\nJeff meets Ann in the woods. She believes in him, but tells him to be absolutely sure of what he wants. She will wait.\n\nJeff discovers that Kathie has killed Whit. She gives him a choice: run away with her or take the blame for all three murders. He dials the phone while she is upstairs. They leave in a car with Jeff driving. Seeing a police [[roadblock]] ahead, Kathie shoots him. She fires at the police. A [[machine gun]] riddles the car with bullets, killing her.\n\nIn Bridgeport, Ann asks the Kid if Jeff was going away with Kathie. Lying, the Kid nods his head. Ann gets into Jim's car, and the Kid smiles, saluting Jeff's name on the gas station's sign.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as Jeff Bailey, previously known as Jeff Markham\n* [[Jane Greer]] as Kathie Moffat\n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as Whit Sterling\n* [[Rhonda Fleming]] as Meta Carson\n* [[Richard Webb (actor)|Richard Webb]] as Jim\n* [[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]] as Jack Fisher\n* [[Virginia Huston]] as Ann Miller\n* [[Paul Valentine]] as Joe Stefanos\n* [[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]] as The Kid\n* [[Ken Niles]] as Leonard Eels\n* [[Theresa Harris]] as Eunice Leonard\n\n==Background and production==\n''Out of the Past'' was produced by [[RKO Pictures]], and the key personnel\u2014director [[Jacques Tourneur]], [[cinematographer]] [[Nicholas Musuraca]], actors Mitchum and Greer, along with [[Albert S.

Robert Mitchum is magnificently cheeky and self-assured as the tangled 'private eye,' consuming an astronomical number of cigarettes in displaying his nonchalance. And Jane Greer is very sleek as his [[Delilah]], Kirk Douglas is crisp as a big crook and Richard Webb, Virginia Huston, Rhonda Fleming and Dickie Moore are picturesque in other roles. If only we had some way of knowing what's going on in the last half of this film, we might get more pleasure from it. As it is, the challenge is worth a try.<ref name=crowther/>}}\n\nShortly after the film's release, the staff of the widely read [[trade publication]] ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also gave it a positive review:{{blockquote|''Out of the Past'' is a [[hardboiled]] [[melodrama]] [from the novel by Geoffrey Homes] strong on characterization. Direction by Jacques Tourneur pays close attention to mood development, achieving realistic flavor that is further emphasized by real life settings and topnotch lensing by Nicholas Musuraca...Mitchum gives a very strong account of himself. Jane Greer as the baby-faced, charming killer is another lending potent interest. Kirk Douglas, the [[gangster]], is believable and Paul Valentine makes his role of henchman stand out.

The film stars Robert Mitchum, whose weary eyes and laconic voice, whose very presence as a violent man wrapped in indifference, made him an archetypal noir actor. The story opens before we've even seen him, as trouble comes to town looking for him. A man from his past has seen him pumping gas, and now his old life reaches out and pulls him back.<ref name=ebert/>}}With regard to the production's stylish and moody cinematography, Ebert also dubbed the film \"The greatest cigarette-smoking movie of all time\":<ref name=\"ebert200\">Ebert, Roger - [https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/200-cigarettes-1999 \"200 Cigarettes\"], ''Chicago Sun'', February 26, 1999.

There were guns in ''Out of the Past,'' but the real hostility came when Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas smoked at each other.<ref name=\"ebert200\" />}}\n\nThe film holds ascore of 93% on review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average rating of 9/10, based on 40 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/out_of_the_past |title=Out of the Past  |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= August 18, 2022 }}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n''Out of the Past'' was remade as ''[[Against All Odds (1984 film)|Against All Odds]]'' (1984) with [[Rachel Ward]] in the Greer role, [[Jeff Bridges]] filling in for Mitchum, and [[James Woods]] as a variation of Kirk Douglas' villain, with Jane Greer as the mother of her original character in ''Out of the Past'' and [[Richard Widmark]] in a supporting role.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/against-all-odds-1984 |title=Reviews: Against All Odds |website=rogerebert.com |date=January 1, 1984}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=crowther>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9500E0DE1E3AE233A25755C2A9679D946693D6CF |title=''Out of the Past'' (1947) |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 26, 1947 |access-date=February 1, 2008}}</ref><ref name=ebert>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-out-of-the-past-1947|last=Ebert |first=Roger |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=Sun-Times Media Group |date=July 18, 2004 |access-date=February 1, 2008 |title=''Out of the Past'' (1947)}}</ref>\n<ref name=ottoson>{{cite book | last = Ottoson | first = Robert | title = A Reference Guide to the American Film Noir, 1940-1958 | publisher = Scarecrow Press | location = Metuchen, N.J., and London | year = 1981 | isbn = 0-8108-1363-7 |page=132 |oclc=6708669}}</ref>\n<ref name=ballingray>{{cite book | last1 = Ballinger | first1 = Alexander | last2 = Graydon | first2 = Danny | title = The Rough Guide to Film Noir | publisher = Rough Guides | location = London | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-84353-474-7 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/roughguidetofilm00ball/page/56 56, 151\u201352] | series = Rough Guides reference guides | oclc = 78989518 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/roughguidetofilm00ball/page/56 }}</ref>\n<ref name=schatzbmovie>{{Harvnb|Schatz|1999|p=173}}, table 6.3.</ref>\n<ref name=schatzofalltime>{{Harvnb|Schatz|1999|p=364}}</ref>\n<ref name=crafton>{{cite book | last = Crafton | first = Donald | title = The Talkies: American Cinema's Transition to Sound, 1926\u20131931 | url = https://archive.org/details/talkiesamericanc0010craf | url-access = registration | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-684-19585-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/talkiesamericanc0010craf/page/210 210] |series=History of the American cinema, volume 4 |oclc=37608321}}</ref>\n<ref name=nfr>{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Roberts M.|title=25 Films Designated For Preservation |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |publisher=Lee Enterprises |date=October 11, 1991}}</ref>\n}}\n\n;
