The film was co-written and directed by [[Olivier Dahan]], and stars [[Marion Cotillard]] as Piaf. The UK and US title ''La Vie en Rose'' comes from [[La Vie en rose|Piaf's signature song]]. The film is an [[international co-production]] between [[Cinema of France|France]], [[Cinema of Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], and the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].\n\nCotillard's performance received critical acclaim and earned her several awards including the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] \u2013 the first time an Oscar had been given for a French-language role \u2013 the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] and the [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress]]. The film also won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Makeup]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]], and four additional [[C\u00e9sar Awards]]. The film grossed $86.3 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is structured as a largely non-linear series of key events from the life of [[\u00c9dith Piaf]]. <ref group=\"note\">The audience ultimately learns that the events from the film are [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] from within \u00c9dith's own memory as she dies.</ref> The film begins with elements from her childhood, and at the end with the events prior to and surrounding her death, poignantly juxtaposed by a performance of her song, \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" (No, I do not Regret Anything).\n\nBeginning in 1918, young \u00c9dith suffers a chaotic childhood and is eventually sent to live with her paternal-grandmother, who runs a brothel in [[Normandy]]. \u00c9dith witnesses the brutal business of [[prostitution]]. When she suffers an episode of [[keratitis]]-induced blindness, a kind [[sex worker]] named Titine tenderly cares for \u00c9dith.\n\n\u00c9dith's [[World War I]] [[veteran]] father collects her to accompany him while he works as a [[circus]] [[Acrobatics|acrobat]]. One night, \u00c9dith sees a vision of [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux|St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se]] in a [[Fire eating|fire eater]]'s flames. St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se says she will always be with \u00c9dith\u2014a belief that she carries for the rest of her life. When \u00c9dith is nine years old, her father leaves the circus and performs on the streets of [[Paris]]. During a lackluster performance, a passerby asks if \u00c9dith is part of the show. She spontaneously sings \"[[La Marseillaise]]\" with raw emotion, mesmerizing the street crowd.\n\nYears later, [[Nightclub#Pre-WWII|nightclub]] owner [[Louis Lepl\u00e9e]] hires \u00c9dith to sing at his club and gives her the stage [[surname]] of Piaf, a [[colloquialism]] for sparrow that is inspired by her diminutive height of only 1.47m (4&nbsp;ft 8in). However, Lepl\u00e9e is soon shot dead and the police suspect it's due to \u00c9dith's connections to the mafia. When she next attempts a show at a [[cabaret]], she is jeered off the stage by a hostile crowd. Things go from bad to worse when her best friend, M\u00f4mone, is forcibly taken to a convent. Desperate, \u00c9dith turns to [[Raymond Asso]], a songwriter and accompanist. Through harsh means, he enlivens her stage presence with hand gestures, better enunciation, and other lessons.\n\n\u00c9dith's career progresses and she achieves fame. While performing in [[New York City]], \u00c9dith meets [[Marcel Cerdan]], a fellow French national and a [[middleweight]] [[boxing|boxer]] competing for the World Champion title. Despite him being married, \u00c9dith believes she's falling in love with Marcel. An affair ensues and, while it's supposedly a secret, \"La Vie En Rose\" is played for Marcel wherever he goes. \u00c9dith persuades Marcel to fly from Paris to join her in New York, and he wakes her up in her bedroom with a kiss. She goes to get coffee and is informed by her entourage that Marcel was killed when his plane crashed. \u00c9dith hysterically searches for the his ghost.\n\nThe narrative bookends scenes from \u00c9dith's middle life with repeated vignettes. One set of memories shows \u00c9dith with short curly hair, singing on stage and collapsing. She develops [[arthritis]], as well as a severe [[morphine]] [[addiction]]. Her husband, [[Jacques Pills]], persuades her to enter [[drug rehabilitation]], and she travels to [[California]] with him. A now-sober but manic \u00c9dith drives around in a convertible while joking and teasing her compatriots. She drives into a [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua tree]], but the hilarity continues as \u00c9dith gets out and pretends to hitchhike.\n\nYears later, an aged \u00c9dith is now frail and hunched. She squabbles with her entourage about whether or not she will be able to perform at [[Olympia (Paris)|the Olympia]]. [[Charles Dumont (singer)|Charles Dumont]] and [[Michel Vaucaire]] offer her the composition, \"Non, je ne regrette rien,\u201d which she loves and announces that she will perform it.\n\nPrior to what turns out to be her last performance, \u00c9dith asks for the [[cross necklace]] that she always wears and her staff rush away to get it. She sits in quiet solitude and experiences memories of her past. After \u00c9dith puts on the retrieved cross and shuffles out onto the stage, more flashbacks are shown as she sings. \u00c9dith relives a sunny day on a beach while [[knitting]]. She answers an interviewer\u2019s questions, during which she repeatedly encourages others to \"Love.\"\n\n\u00c9dith's hard living and cancer has caused her to waste away at the age of 47. As she is tucked into bed, a subtitle reveals this is her last day alive. She is afraid and experiences a disjointed series of memories of small, yet defining moments\u2014her mother commenting on her \"wild eyes\", her father giving her a doll, and thoughts of her own dead child, Marcelle. In a flashback, \u00c9dith performs \"''Non, je ne regrette rien''\" at the Olympia.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as [[\u00c9dith Piaf]]\n* [[Sylvie Testud]] as Simone \"M\u00f4mone\" Berteaut\n* [[Pascal Greggory]] as Louis Barrier\n* [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] as Titine\n* [[Jean-Paul Rouve]] as [[Louis Alphonse Gassion]]\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as [[Louis Lepl\u00e9e]]\n* [[Clotilde, Princess of Venice and Piedmont|Clotilde Courau]] as [[Line Marsa|Annetta Gassion]]\n* [[Jean-Pierre Martins]] as [[Marcel Cerdan]]\n* [[Catherine All\u00e9gret]] as Louise Gassion\n* [[Marc Barb\u00e9]] as [[Raymond Asso]]\n* [[Marie-Armelle Deguy]] as [[Marguerite Monnot]]\n* Caroline Raynaud as Ginou\n* [[Denis M\u00e9nochet]] as Journalist in Orly\n* [[Pavl\u00edna N\u011bmcov\u00e1]] as American journalist\n* [[Harry Hadden-Paton]] as Doug Davis\n* [[:fr:Caroline Sihol|Caroline Sihol]] as [[Marlene Dietrich]]\n* [[Pauline Burlet]] as a young \u00c9dith Piaf\n* Farida Amrouche as [[Emma Sa\u00efd Ben Mohamed]]\n* Andr\u00e9 Penvern : [[Jacques Canetti]] \n* [[Marie-Armelle Deguy]] : [[Marguerite Monnot]] \n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nCotillard was chosen by director [[Olivier Dahan]] to portray the French singer [[\u00c9dith Piaf]] in the biopic ''La Vie en Rose'' before he had even met her, saying that he noticed a similarity between Piaf's and Cotillard's eyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jUBxNT4i4J4SRqyJI9sSR5nUeALw |title=Piaf star Cotillard's career blooms with Oscar nom for 'La Vie En Rose' |date=14 February 2008 |publisher=The Canadian Press |access-date=6 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219031805/http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jUBxNT4i4J4SRqyJI9sSR5nUeALw |archive-date=19 February 2008 }}</ref> Producer [[Alain Goldman]] accepted and defended the choice even though distributors TF1 reduced the money they gave to finance the film thinking Cotillard wasn't \"bankable\" enough an actress.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/02/12/bfmarion112.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215071312/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/02/12/bfmarion112.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 February 2008 |title=Everything's coming up roses |publisher=Benjamin Sesher, Telegraph.co.uk |date=12 February 2008 |location=London |first=Benjamin |last=Secher |access-date=12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nFour songs were entirely performed by \"Parigote\" singer Jil Aigrot:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} \"[[Mon Homme]]\" ''(My Man)'', \"[[Les M\u00f4mes de la Cloche]]\" ''(The kids of the bell)'', \"[[Mon L\u00e9gionnaire]]\" ''(My legionnaire)'', \"Les Hiboux\" ''(Owls)'' as well as the third verse and chorus of \"[[L'Accord\u00e9oniste]]\" ''(The accordionist)'' and the first chorus of \"[[Padam, padam...]]\".
