The screenplay, by Paquet-Brenner, is based on [[Gillian Flynn]]'s [[2009 in literature|2009 novel]] [[Dark Places (novel)|of the same name]]. It stars [[Charlize Theron]], [[Christina Hendricks]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], and [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\nThe film was released in France on April 8, 2015,<ref name=\"allocine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=207623.html|title=Dark Places|author=AlloCine|date=8 April 2015|work=AlloCin\u00e9|access-date=8 August 2015}}</ref> and in the United States on August 7, 2015, by [[A24]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/04/17/dark-places-ew-preview|title='Dark Places': EW preview|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]'s EW.com|access-date=8 August 2015}}</ref> The film drew mixed reviews and was a commercial failure.\n\n== Summary ==\nIn 1985 in rural Kinnakee, Kansas, 8-year old Libby Day is the sole survivor of the massacre of her mother and two older sisters. Responding to the police's [[leading question]]s, she tells them that her brother teenage Ben (Sheridan) committed the crime. In the present day, Libby (Theron) has made a living from donations sent by strangers to the little girl they saw on the news. With donations drying up, she is hard up for cash when she is approached by Lyle Wirth (Hoult) to make a personal appearance at his \"True Crime\" club. She reluctantly agrees to go and answer questions about her past for $700.\n\nBack in 1985, Ben comes to the breakfast table with his hair dyed black. He has a tense relationship with his mother Patty (Hendricks) and his eldest sister Michelle, who taunts Ben about being a loner and rumors about him at school. Ben hangs out with a [[Satanist]] bookie named Trey Teepano. Meanwhile, their mother Patty is told  that her farm is being foreclosed on, despite her best efforts to stay afloat.\n\nAt Wirth's club, Libby learns that most of the members believe her brother Ben is innocent. His conviction was based on Libby's testimony. Still believing that Ben is guilty, Libby nevertheless agrees to work with the club in return for much needed money. Urged by Wirth to visit Ben in prison, Libby's curiosity about what motivated him to kill their family prods her to keep researching the case.\n\nPrior to the murders, Ben was planning to run away with his pregnant girlfriend Diondra (Moretz). Meanwhile, some young girls have accused Ben of molesting them. When Patty is informed of the charges, she visits the home of the chief accuser Krissi Cates, whose father is irate and looking to harm Ben. Patty is distraught by the accusations and feels that she has failed her kids. Back home, their estranged, alcoholic father Runner (Bridgers) is waiting for Patty. He needs money to skip town because he owes Trey the bookie more than he can repay. He becomes violent and abusive towards Patty. He attempts to rip her heirloom ruby necklace off her neck but, unable to do so, he beats her and steals money from her wallet.\n\nIn the present, Libby tracks down her father Runner to an abandoned factory where he lives with other homeless addicts. He tells her about Diondra's pregnancy, which Libby was not aware of. Libby also locates Krissi Cates (Matteo), who eventually confesses that she made up the molestation accusations against Ben.\n\nMeanwhile in 1985, Patty is informed by a friend with the [[Farmers Home Administration]] that he might have a solution to her problems. She meets with a stranger in the middle of the night at a park, who says that he can help her. It later turns out that he is Calvin Diehl, a serial killer known as the Angel of Debt, who murders people so that their families can collect on their life insurance policies. Unable to see any other solution to her financial problems, Patty goes home and hides some money for Diehl.\n\nAt the same time, Diondra finds out about the accusations against Ben and convinces him to flee with her immediately. They go to Ben's house to steal some money. Michelle overhears them talking and threatens to tell on them. Diondra impulsively attacks Michelle and starts to choke her. Diehl has also entered the house. In the hallway, he stabs Patty. When her middle daughter Debby rushes out of the bedroom to get help for Michelle, Diehl grabs the family shotgun and kills the young girl. The shot distracts Ben from his effort to protect Michelle. While he goes to see what has happened, Diondra strangles Michelle.\n\nIn the present, Libby finds Diondra and Crystal, the daughter she had with Ben. Libby then finds her mother's ruby necklace in Diondra's bathroom and realizes she is in danger. Crystal attacks her, but she manages to escape the house. She finds out about Diehl's involvement from Wirth, whose club has been working on the Angel of Debt case. Libby visits Ben again in prison, and they apologize to each other. She realizes he was trying to protect his unborn daughter by taking the rap for the murder of his mother and his sisters. A news report confirms that Diondra has been arrested. Libby returns to look at the family farm where she grew up. Ben is exonerated and released from prison while Libby states that she doesn't intend to press charges against Crystal, who is yet to be found, as she understands her actions.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Libby Day<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/amy-adams-out-charlize-theron-circling-adaptation-of-gillian-flynns-dark-places-20130204|title=Charlize Theron Joins Adaptation Of Gillian Flynn's 'Dark &#124; The Playlist|publisher=[[Indiewire]] blog|access-date=2015-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203052202/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/amy-adams-out-charlize-theron-circling-adaptation-of-gillian-flynns-dark-places-20130204|archive-date=February 3, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n** [[Sterling Jerins]] as young Libby Day\n* [[Christina Hendricks]] as Patty Day<ref name=\"deadline_a\">{{cite web|last=Patten|first=Dominic|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/09/christina-hendricks-dark-places-mad-men-charlize-theron-movie-casting/|title=UPDATE: 'Mad Men's Christina Hendricks Lands New 'Dark Places' Role|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=2013-09-03|access-date=2015-04-16}}</ref>\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as Lyle Wirth<ref>{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Brian|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/nicholas-hoult-joins-dark-places|title=Nicholas Hoult Joins 'Dark Places'|publisher=[[MovieWeb]]|date=2013-04-03|access-date=2015-04-16|archive-date=October 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001052745/http://www.movieweb.com/news/nicholas-hoult-joins-dark-places|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Andrea Roth]] as Diondra Wertzner<ref name=\"deadline\" />\n** [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as young Diondra Wertzner<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/dark-places-movie-chloe-moretz-charlize-theron/ |title=Chlo\u00eb Moretz Joins 'Dark Places' Cast Alongside Charlize Theron |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=2014-06-20 |access-date=2015-04-16}}</ref>\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as Ben Day<ref name=\"deadline\">{{cite web|last=Patten |first=Dominic |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/08/dark-places-adds-house-of-cards-corey-stoll-rescue-mes-andrea-roth/ |title='Dark Places' Adds 'House Of Cards' Corey Stoll & 'Rescue Me's Andrea Roth |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=2013-08-20 |access-date=2015-04-16}}</ref>\n** [[Tye Sheridan]] as young Ben Day<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason McDonald|url=http://www.horror-movies.ca/2013/08/tye-sheridan-joins-dark-places/|title=Tye Sheridan Joins 'Dark Places'|publisher=Horror-Movies.ca|date=2013-08-19|access-date=2015-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328102343/http://www.horror-movies.ca/2013/08/tye-sheridan-joins-dark-places/|archive-date=March 28, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Sean Bridgers]] as Runner Day\n* [[Drea de Matteo]] as Krissi Cates<ref name=\"deadline_a\" />\n** Addy Miller as young Krissi Cates\n* [[Shannon Kook]] as young Trey Teepano\n* [[Richard Gunn (actor)|Richard Gunn]] as Lou Cates\n* [[Dan Hewitt Owens]] as Robert\n* [[Glenn Morshower]] as Jim Jeffreys\n* [[Denise Williamson]] as Crystal\n* [[Jeff Chase]] as Calvin Diehl\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] commenced in late August 2013 in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[Minden, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zimbio.com/Charlize+Theron/articles/6EMa9yHHKqk/Charlize+Theron+Dark+Places+Starts+Shooting |title=Charlize Theron: 'Dark Places' Starts Shooting!
