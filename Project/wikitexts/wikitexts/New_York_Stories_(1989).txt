Paulette is Lionel's assistant and former lover. Lionel is still infatuated with her, but Paulette wants only his tutelage, which makes things difficult since they live in the same studio-loft. Paulette dates other people, including a performance artist and a painter.\n\nThese deliberate provocations on Paulette's part make Lionel insanely jealous\u2014and fuel his creativity. Lionel and Paulette, it becomes clear, have been using each other: Lionel using her sexually, Paulette using him as a means of entry into the higher spheres of the New York social and art scene. Paulette wants to give up and go home to her parents but Lionel persuades her to stay because New York is where a painter needs to be.\n\nLionel pours his anxiety and repressed passion into his work. Paintings around the studio show visual metaphors from relations past: stormy skies, burning bridges, and tormented clowns. Lionel realizes that he needs the emotional turmoil of his destructive relationships in order to fuel his art. At the art exhibit, Lionel meets another attractive young woman, a struggling painter. He persuades her to become his assistant and potentially his lover, beginning the cycle anew.\n\n===''Life Without Zo\u00eb''===\nZo\u00eb is a 12-year-old schoolgirl who lives in a luxury hotel. She helps return to an Arab princess a valuable piece of jewelry that the princess had given to Zo\u00eb's father and had been subsequently stolen and recovered. Zo\u00eb tries to reconcile her divorced mother, a photographer, and father, a flautist.\n\n===''Oedipus Wrecks''===\nNew York lawyer Sheldon Mills has problems with his overly critical mother Sadie Millstein. Sheldon complains constantly to his therapist about her, wishing aloud that she would just disappear. Sheldon takes his ''[[shiksa]]'' fianc\u00e9e, Lisa, to meet his mother, who immediately embarrasses him. The three, as well as Lisa's children from a previous marriage, go to a magic show. His mother is invited on stage to be a part of the magician's act. She is put inside a box that has swords stuck through it and she disappears, just as she is supposed to, but then she never reappears.\n\nAlthough he is furious at first, this development turns out to be great for Sheldon because, with her out of his life, he can finally relax. But soon, to his horror, his mother reappears in the sky over New York City. She begins to annoy Sheldon and Lisa (with the whole city now watching) by constantly talking to strangers about his most embarrassing moments. This puts a strain on his relationship with Lisa, who leaves him. Sheldon is persuaded by his psychiatrist to see a psychic, Treva, to try to get his mother back to reality. Treva's experiments fail, but Sheldon falls for her. When he introduces Treva to his mother, she approves and comes back to Earth.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n'''''Life Lessons'''''\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Lionel Dobie\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Paulette\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Gregory Stark\n* [[Jesse Borrego]] as Reuben Toro\n* [[Peter Gabriel]] as himself\n* [[Illeana Douglas]] as Paulette's friend\n* [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]] as girl at Blind Alley\n{{col-break}}\n'''''Life Without Zo\u00eb'''''\n* [[Heather McComb]] as Zo\u00eb\n* [[Talia Shire]] as Charlotte\n* [[Giancarlo Giannini]] as Claudio\n* [[Don Novello]] as Hector\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Mel\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as robber\n* [[Carmine Coppola]] as street musician\n* [[Carole Bouquet]] as Princess Soraya\n{{col-break}}\n'''''Oedipus Wrecks'''''\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Sheldon Mills\n* [[Mae Questel]] as Mother\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Lisa\n* [[Julie Kavner]] as Treva\n* [[George Schindler]] as Shandu, the magician\n* [[Larry David]] as theater manager\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as hardhat\n* Ira Wheeler as Mr. Bates\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Lisa's daughter\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Soundtracks==\n===''Life Lessons''===\n{{Div col}}\n* \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\" by [[Procol Harum]]\n* \"Politician\" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]\n* \"[[Night Time Is the Right Time|The Right Time]]\" by [[Ray Charles]]\n* \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\" by [[Bob Dylan]]/The Band\n* \"[[It Could Happen to You (song)|It Could Happen to You]]\" written by [[Johnny Burke (lyricist)|Johnny Burke]] and [[Jimmy Van Heusen]]\n* \"[[That Old Black Magic]]\" written by [[Johnny Mercer]] and [[Harold Arlen]]\n* \"[[Stella by Starlight]]\" written by [[Ned Washington]] and [[Victor Young]]\n* \"Conquistador\" by Procol Harum\n* \"[[Nessun dorma]]\" by [[Mario Del Monaco]]\n* \"Sex Kick\" by [[Transvision Vamp]]\n* \"[[What Is This Thing Called Love?]]\" performed by The Hot Club of France with [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[St\u00e9phane Grappelli]]\n* \"Bolero de Django\" by The Hot Club of France with Django Reinhardt and St\u00e9phane Grappelli\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===''Life Without Zoe''===\nThis segment's music was almost written in its entirety by [[Kid Creole]] (August Darnell) and performed by [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts]], except where noted.\n\n{{Div col}}\n* \"Zoe\"\n* \"Daiquiri Daiquira\"\n* \"Schoolin\"\n* \"Abu\"\n* \"The Robbery\"\n* \"My Love\"\n* \"People Will Talk\"\n* \"Party Girl\"\n* \"Don't Lead Me On\"\n* \"March of the Waiters\"\n* \"Takin' a Holiday\"\n* \"12th Street\" by Thick as Thieves\n* \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\" by [[Carl Perkins|Carl Lee Perkins]]\n* \"Back to School\" by [[Pianosaurus]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===''Oedipus Wrecks''===\n{{Div col}}\n* \"[[I Want a Girl (Just Like the Girl That Married Dear Old Dad)]]\" by [[Frankie Carle]]\n* \"Mother\" by [[Bernie Leighton]]\n* \"[[Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)|Sing, Sing, Sing]]\" by [[Benny Goodman]]\n* \"[[In a Persian Market]]\" by [[Wilbur de Paris]]\n* \"[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]\" by [[Liberace]]\n* \"[[I've Found a New Baby]]\" by Wilbur de Paris\n* \"[[All the Things You Are]]\" by [[David Rose (songwriter)|David Rose]] & His Orchestra\n* \"[[June in January]]\" by David Rose & His Orchestra<ref>{{cite book |last= Harvey |first= Adam|date= 2007|title= The Soundtracks of Woody Allen |publisher= Macfarland & Company |page=101 |isbn=978-0-786-42968-4}}</ref>   \n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''New York Stories'' opened on March 10, 1989, earning $432,337 in 12 theaters over its opening weekend.
