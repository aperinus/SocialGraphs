It tells the story of an unlikely romance between a young woman unlucky in love and a shy young man who has a [[Congenital heart defect|heart defect]]. The original [[Film score|music score]] was composed by [[Cliff Eidelman]], and includes a classical arrangement of \"[[Nature Boy]]\".  A remixed version of [[Suzanne Vega]]'s 1987 song \"[[Tom's Diner]]\" is featured in the opening scene of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nCaroline is a young woman living in [[Minneapolis]]. She is a [[beauty school]] student and a part-time [[waitress]] at a diner. She works with her best friend, Cindy, and Adam, a busboy and dishwasher who keeps to himself. One night at work, after Caroline's latest boyfriend breaks up with her, she and Cindy find themselves talking about Adam. Cindy confides that she thinks Adam is \"kinda cute\" and adds, \"I'd do him if he wasn't so dumb\".\n\nWalking home from work one night, Caroline is accosted by two men who attempt to rape her, but Adam shows up and fights them off. Unbeknownst to Caroline, Adam had been following her from a distance every night to make sure she gets home safely. The next evening at work, Caroline thanks Adam for coming to her rescue, and he quietly begins to open up about himself to her, bringing the two closer. Caroline later confides in Cindy that she was almost raped and that Adam saved her life, and thus she is now interested in Adam, which Cindy supports.\n\nThings begin looking up for Caroline as she and Adam become a couple: Caroline buys a used car, and Adam is beginning to overcome his shyness. One night the same two men who tried to rape Caroline attack and stab Adam outside the diner. Adam is rushed to the hospital, and Caroline later identifies the perpetrators in a police lineup. While Adam is recovering, Caroline learns that he has a heart defect and will die without a transplant. Adam, claiming that he has a [[baboon]]'s heart (lovingly told to him by a nun at the orphanage where he grew up), refuses to listen, stating that he is afraid he will no longer be the same person if he gets a transplant. Caroline tries to assure Adam that love comes from a person's mind and soul, but she is deeply touched when Adam asks why it hurts so much \"here\" (pointing to his own heart) when one's heart is broken.\n\nOn his birthday, Caroline visits Adam at his apartment and surprises him by taking him to a [[Minnesota North Stars]] hockey game, but Adam surprises her with flowers and a gift that he left for her to be opened only after they return. At the game, Adam catches a stray [[hockey puck]], and on the way home Adam falls asleep next to Caroline, but when they reach his house she discovers to her horror that his heart has given out and he had died in his sleep.\n\nAfter Adam's funeral, Caroline goes to his apartment and opens his gift for her: a box of his record albums with a handwritten note declaring his love.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Caroline\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Adam\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Cindy\n* [[Kyle Secor]] as Howard\n* [[Willie Garson]] as Patsy\n* Claudia Wilkens as Mother Camilla \n* James Cada aa Bill #1\n* Gary Groomes as Bill #2\n* Charley Bartlett as young Adam\n* [[Vincent Kartheiser]] as orphan boy\n* [[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]] as cook\n* Steve Cochran as Stromboli \n* Tom Sierchio as Ronnie\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nTony Bill discovered Tom Sierchio's screenplay for ''Untamed Heart'' during one of his talent searches: he had asked an agent at [[William Morris]] to send him screenplays from new writers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Hillbery |first=Rhonda J. |date=1992-06-07 |title=MOVIES : ON LOCATION : No Monkeying Around : Filmmaker Tony Bill went looking for something original and found it |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-07-ca-282-story.html |url-status=live |access-date=2022-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220702135713/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-07-ca-282-story.html?_ga=2.148762935.1016151946.1656769494-291656090.1656769493 |archive-date=2022-07-02}}</ref> Originally, Sierchio's screenplay had been submitted as a writer's sample.

Tomei\u2019s newfound success with ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'' helped in her casting.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nSierchio's screenplay was originally set in [[New Jersey]], but for logistical reasons they could not shoot there. The filmmakers considered finding a location to double for the state, but while Bill, Bartlett, and Sierchio were scouting in [[Minneapolis]], they realized it was an ideal location because of its strong acting community (they cast 35 of the film's 40 roles from it) and a large commercial production community that allowed them to utilize a mostly local crew.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news |date=February 12, 1993 |title=Minneapolis is a stand-in that became a star |pages=49 |work=[[Star Tribune]] |url=https://startribune.newspapers.com/clip/105198143/star-tribune/ |access-date=July 11, 2022 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}{{free access}}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web |title=Untamed Heart |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/59693 |access-date=2022-07-02 |website=[[AFI Catalog]]}}</ref>\n\nThe city's locations were also a strong factor in deciding to shoot there.
