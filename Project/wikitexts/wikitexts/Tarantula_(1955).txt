It stars [[John Agar]], [[Mara Corday]], and [[Leo G. Carroll]]. The film is about a scientist developing a miracle nutrient to feed a rapidly growing human population. In its unperfected state, the nutrient causes extraordinarily rapid growth, creating a deadly problem when a tarantula test subject escapes and continues to grow larger and larger. The screenplay by Robert M. Fresco and [[Martin Berkeley]] was based on a story by Arnold, which was in turn inspired by Fresco's teleplay for the 1955 ''[[Science Fiction Theatre]]'' episode \"No Food for Thought\", also directed by Arnold.<ref name=afi /> The film was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] as a [[Universal-International]] release, and reissued in 1962 through [[Sherman S. Krellberg]]'s [[Ultra Pictures]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nA severely deformed man is found dead in the [[Arizona]] desert. Dr. Matt Hastings, a doctor from the nearby town of Desert Rock, Arizona, is called in by the sheriff to examine the body. It appears to be that of biological research scientist Eric Jacobs, an acquaintance of Hastings. Jacobs' colleague, Dr. Gerald Deemer, says Jacobs died of [[acromegaly]], but Hastings is unconvinced, since acromegaly takes years to reach its current state. Deemer acknowledges that Jacobs's development of acromegaly was rapid, over just four days, but insists that such anomalies are to be expected on occasion.\n\nIn his home and research laboratory in an isolated desert mansion, Deemer keeps rabbits, [[white rat]]s, [[hamster]]s, and a [[tarantula]], all of enormous size, some as large as [[Golden Retriever]]s. Deemer's assistant, doctoral student Paul Lund, is now deformed like Jacobs and attacks Deemer, smashing the glass covering a tarantula's cage and setting the lab aflame in his rampage. Lund grabs the [[hypodermic needle]] that Deemer was using on the lab specimens and injects him with the contents. As flames engulf the lab, the tarantula leaves and Lund collapses and dies. Deemer regains consciousness, grabs a fire extinguisher and puts out the fire. That night, Deemer buries Lund in the desert.\n\nA newcomer to town, Stephanie Clayton, nicknamed \"Steve\", has signed on to assist in Deemer's lab. Told by the hotel clerk that she will have to wait until the only taxi returns, she accepts a ride from Hastings, who is also going to Deemer's lab. At the mansion, they encounter local journalist Joe Burch, who is asking questions about Jacobs's death but getting the runaround from Deemer. Deemer tells Hastings and Clayton that the fire was caused by an equipment malfunction, all the test animals were killed, and Lund has left his employment. Deemer explains his work: the use of a radioactive element to produce an artificial super-nutrient which, once perfected, could provide an unlimited food supply for humanity.\n\nDays later, the sheriff asks Hastings to accompany him to Andy Anderson's ranch as he investigates picked-clean cattle carcasses and large pools of a thick, white liquid. The tarantula, now grown to the size of a tank, is the cause. That night, Anderson and two men inside a pickup truck are killed by the tarantula.\n\nThe next day, at the scene of the wrecked truck, Hastings looks round at the request of the sheriff, and once again finds pools of the white liquid, which he takes samples of. He calls Deemer to ask him to analyze the liquid, and Clayton answers. Deemer ambushes her, and the phone call is cut. Hastings drives back to the mansion, where he finds Deemer near death, suffering from severe acromegalic deformities. Deemer divulges all that he knows about the nutrient and says that Lund and Jacobs tested it on themselves against his advice. Hastings flies the samples of white liquid to the Arizona Agricultural Institute in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. The substance is determined to be tarantula venom.\n\nHastings flies back to Desert Rock. As night falls, the tarantula, now larger than a house, attacks the mansion. Deemer is killed, but Clayton escapes. Hastings returns for her in his car. The tarantula pursues them down the highway toward the town. The sheriff's men intercept, but their guns have no effect. Dynamite is gathered from town, but a blast large enough to blow up the highway does not faze the tarantula. As they evacuate the town, an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] fighter jet squadron, summoned by the sheriff, launches a [[napalm]] attack, incinerating the tarantula at the town's edge.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[John Agar]] as Dr. Matt Hastings\n* [[Mara Corday]] as Stephanie Clayton\n* [[Leo G.

Real animals, including a rabbit and a guinea pig in Professor Deemer's lab, were used to represent their giant on-screen counterparts. A live tarantula was used whenever the gigantic spider is seen moving. Shooting miniatures were reserved for close-ups of its face and fangs and for the final scenes of the giant spider being set ablaze by the jet squadron's napalm attack. The resulting scenes proved more convincing in some ways, than the giant prop ants used in the earlier [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[Them!]]'' (1954).<ref name=FoSFF>Searles 1988, pp. 165\u2013167.</ref> Of this and the entire film, Jack Arnold said about ''Tarantula!'': \"We decided to do this film because, generally, people are very afraid of spiders\".\n\nAlthough set in Arizona, ''Tarantula!'' was filmed entirely in California, with the desert scenes being shot in [[Apple Valley, California|Apple Valley]].<ref>Thompson, Nathaniel. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/92350/Tarantula/articles.html \"Articles: 'Tarantula'.\"] ''[[TCM.com]]''. Retrieved: January 30, 2015.</ref> Additional footage was shot in and around the rock formations of Dead Man's Point in [[Lucerne Valley]], California, a frequently used location for many early Western films.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nLike ''Them!'', ''Tarantula!'' makes atmospheric use of its desert locations. While a radioactive isotope does make an appearance, it differs from most other 1950s big-bug features in having the mutation caused by the peaceful research of a well-intentioned scientist, rather than by nuclear weapons and/or a mad genius. Director Jack Arnold used [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] effects once again two years later to show miniaturization, rather than gigantism, in ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'' (1957), which also featured an encounter with a spider.\n\nThe film's theatrical release poster, featuring a spider with two eyes instead of the normal eight, and carrying a woman in its fangs, does not represent any scene in the final film; all the spider's human victims are male. This gaudy depiction of a woman-in-peril had become, by this time, a standard B-movie poster clich\u00e9 that would continue being used for some years, to promote similar films.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Reception==\n<!-- not really that notable {{expand section|date=April 2015}} -->\n\nThe film was often paired with ''[[Running Wild (1955 film)|Running Wild]]'' as part of a [[double feature]].<ref name=December>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title='Guys and Dolls' Jingly Pre-Xmas; December Pretty Downbeat; 'Trap,' 'Tarantula,' 'Rebel' 3-4-5|date=January 11, 1956|page=7|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety201-1956-01#page/n524/mode/1up|accessdate=August 25, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> It was the fourth biggest film at the U.S. box office in December 1955<ref name=December/> and earned rentals of $1.1 million.<ref name=rentals>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Top Film Grossers of 1956|date=January 2, 1957|page=1}}</ref>\n\nFilm critic [[Leonard Maltin]] awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising the film's fast pacing, special effects, and intriguing subplot.
