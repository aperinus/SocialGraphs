Larry Brand and [[Sean Hood]] devised the screenplay. The film is a direct sequel to ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later|Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later]]'' and the eighth installment overall in the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]]. It stars [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Bianca Kajlich]], [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]], [[Ryan Merriman]], [[Sean Patrick Thomas]], [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], with [[Brad Loree]] as the primary villain [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]. This was the final installment of the ''H20'' timeline of the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]], which had just been rebooted with the previous movie in 1998, before it was rebooted again in 2007 and again in 2018. The film follows Myers continuing his murderous rampage in his hometown of Haddonfield when his childhood house is used for a live internet horror show.\n\n''Halloween: Resurrection'' was released on July 12, 2002, to largely negative reviews, with many considering it an unnecessary sequel to ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later|Halloween H20]]''. Many fans and critics have deemed it to be the worst film in the ''Halloween'' franchise.<ref>{{Cite web |last=L\u00ea |first=Paul |date=2022-07-12 |title='Halloween: Resurrection' 20 Years Later \u2013 Why the 2002 Sequel Remains a Franchise Low Point |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3722206/halloween-resurrection-20-years-later-why-the-2002-sequel-remains-a-franchise-low/ |access-date=2022-07-21 |website=Bloody Disgusting! |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Chernov |first1=Matthew |date=2021-10-15 |title=All 12 'Halloween' Movies in the Franchise, Ranked |url=https://variety.com/lists/halloween-movies-ranked-franchise/ |access-date=2022-07-20 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref> The film also [[Box-office bomb|underperformed at the box office]], only grossing $37.6 million worldwide against a $15 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Why Jamie Lee Curtis Demanded That Laurie Strode Die in \u2018Halloween: Resurrection\u2019 |url=https://collider.com/jamie-lee-curtis-demanded-laurie-strode-die-in-halloween-resurrection/ |access-date=October 30, 2022 |website=Collider}}</ref> Although another sequel was planned to follow ''Resurrection'', the next film in the franchise became ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'', a 2007 [[remake]] directed by [[Rob Zombie]].\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing [[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later|the murders at Hillcrest Academy]], a guilt-ridden and traumatized [[Laurie Strode]] has been confined to a psychiatric facility, after killing a man whom she had mistaken for her murderous brother [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]. As two nurses talk about what happened, flashbacks reveal that a paramedic had found an unconscious Michael in the school, before he suddenly awakened and attacked the paramedic, crushing his [[larynx]] so that he could not speak. Michael then swapped clothes with the unconscious paramedic, and left the school grounds and escaped into the woods behind the school, as Laurie drove off in the ambulance she believed Michael was in.\n\nOn October 31, 2001, after three years of hiding, Michael re-emerges to attempt to murder Laurie again, who has been institutionalized at the Grace Andersen Sanitarium. Expecting his arrival, Laurie sets up a trap for him. After killing two security guards, Michael attacks and chases Laurie to the institution's rooftop, where her trap works and temporarily incapacitates Michael. However, Laurie's fears of killing the wrong person again get the better of her, and when she tries to remove his mask to confirm his identity, Michael stabs and throws her off the rooftop, killing Laurie in the process.\n\nIn 2002, a year later, college students Sara Moyer, Bill Woodlake, Donna Chang, Jen Danzig, Jim Morgan and Rudy Grimes win a competition to appear on an Internet reality show called ''Dangertainment'', directed by Freddie Harris and Nora Winston. The students have to spend a night in Michael's abandoned childhood house in order to figure out what led him to kill. However, while setting up cameras throughout the house in preparation for the show, cameraman Charlie is killed by Michael, who has returned to Haddonfield. On Halloween night, equipped with head cameras, Sara, Bill, Donna, Jen, Jim, and Rudy enter the house and separate into three groups to search for clues. While Sara messages friends, Myles \"Deckard\" Barton watches the live broadcast during a party. During the search, Michael suddenly appears and kills Bill.\n\nDonna and Jim discover a wall filled with fake corpses and realize that the show is a setup, before the former is killed by Michael. At the party, Deckard and other partygoers witness the murder. But only Deckard realizes that it was real. Meanwhile, Freddie enters the house dressed as Michael in order to scare the competitors. He is followed by the real Michael, whom he mistakes for Charlie. When Rudy, Sara, and Jim find Freddie in the Michael costume, he reveals the scheme to them and begs them to cooperate, telling them that they will all be paid well if the show works out. After Freddie leaves, the trio decides to gather up the rest of their friends and leave. Jen discovers Bill's corpse, and Michael decapitates her in front of Rudy, Sara, and Jim, who soon realize that it isn't Freddie. Michael proceeds to kill Jim and Rudy before chasing Sara upstairs.\n\nLocking herself in a bedroom, Sara begs Deckard to help her. As the other partygoers realize that all the murders are real, Deckard begins to message Sara Michael's locations to help her avoid him. Sara runs into Freddie just as Michael finds them and stabs the latter. Sara runs into the tunnels and finds an exit leading to the garage, where she discovers Nora's body. Michael again arrives and attacks Sara, but a still-living Freddie finds them and fights Michael as an electrical fire starts in the garage. After electrocuting Michael, Freddie carries Sara to safety, leaving Michael to die in the burning garage. Later, Freddie and Sara are interviewed by the local news, during which Sara thanks Deckard for saving her life and Freddie assaults the reporter. Meanwhile, Michael is presumed dead and his body is taken to the morgue. However, as the coroner prepares to examine his body, Michael suddenly awakens.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n{{Main|List of Halloween (franchise) characters|l1=''List of'' Halloween ''characters''}}\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as [[Laurie Strode]]\n* [[Brad Loree]] as [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] \n* [[Busta Rhymes]] as Freddie Harris\n* [[Bianca Kajlich]] as Sara Moyer\n* [[Sean Patrick Thomas]] as Rudy Grimes\n* [[Daisy McCrackin]] as Donna Chang\n* [[Katee Sackhoff]] as Jennifer 'Jen' Danzig\n* [[Luke Kirby]] as Jim Morgan\n* [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]] as Bill Woodlake\n* [[Ryan Merriman]] as Myles 'Deckard' Barton\n* [[Tyra Banks]] as Nora Winston\n* Gus Lynch as Harold Trumble\n* [[Lorena Gale]] as Nurse Wells \n* Marisa Rudiak as Nurse Phillips \n* Brent Chapman as Franklin Munroe \n* Dan Joffre as Willie Haines\n* Haig Sutherland as Aron\n* [[Brad Sihvon]] as Charlie Albans  \n* [[Rick Rosenthal]] as Professor Mixter\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe writers of ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' were left with a dilemma when [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] wanted to end the series, but [[Moustapha Akkad]] had a clause that legally wouldn't allow the writers to kill [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] off.
