It tells the story of Freddie Quell (Phoenix), a World War II [[United States Navy|Navy]] veteran struggling to adjust to a post-war society, who meets Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), the leader of a religious movement known as the Cause. Dodd sees something in Quell and accepts him into the movement. Freddie takes a liking to the Cause and begins traveling with Dodd's family to spread his teachings.\n\nThe film was produced by [[Annapurna Pictures]] and Ghoulardi Film Company and distributed by [[The Weinstein Company]]. The film's inspirations were varied: it was partly inspired by [[Scientology]] founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]],  by early drafts of Anderson's ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'', the novel ''[[V.]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]], drunken Navy stories that [[Jason Robards]] had told to Anderson while filming ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', and the life story of author [[John Steinbeck]]. ''The Master'' was shot almost entirely on 65mm film stock, making it the first fiction feature to be shot and released in [[70 mm film|70mm]] since [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'' in 1996.\n\nInitially, the film was set up with [[Universal Pictures]], but fell through due to script and budget problems. It was first publicly shown on August 3, 2012, at the [[American Cinematheque]] in 70&nbsp;mm and screened variously in the same way, before officially premiering at the [[69th Venice International Film Festival|Venice Film Festival]] on September 1, where it won the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI Award]] for Best Film. It was released in theaters in the United States on September 14, 2012, to critical acclaim; its performances (particularly those from the three leads), screenplay, direction, plausibility, and realistic portrayal of post-World War II Americans were praised.\n\nConsidered one of Anderson's finest works and one of the best films of the 2010s, it received three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Phoenix, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Hoffman, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Adams. In 2016, ''The Master'' was voted [[100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|the 24th greatest film of the 21st century by 177 critics from around the world.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films|title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films|date=August 19, 2016|access-date=December 17, 2021|archive-date=January 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131124228/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films|url-status=live}}</ref> Anderson has repeatedly stated that ''The Master'' is his favorite film of those he has made.<ref>{{cite web|title='The Master' Is Paul Thomas Anderson's Favorite Movie, Even If He's 'Not Sure It Was Entirely Successful'|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/02/paul-thomas-anderson-the-master-favorite-film-1201931234/|website=IndieWire|access-date=March 14, 2018|archive-date=March 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314174553/http://www.indiewire.com/2018/02/paul-thomas-anderson-the-master-favorite-film-1201931234/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFreddie Quell is a traumatized [[World War II]] [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[veteran]] struggling to adjust to post-war society and prone to violent and erratic behavior. He works as a photographer in a department store, but is fired after getting into a fight with a customer. While working on a farm in California, an elderly colleague collapses after drinking Freddie's homemade [[moonshine]]. Freddie flees after being accused of poisoning him.\n\nOne night, Freddie finds himself in [[San Francisco]] and stows away on the yacht of a follower of Lancaster Dodd, the leader of a nascent philosophical movement known as the Cause. When he is discovered, Dodd describes Freddie as \"aberrated\" and claims he has met him in the past but cannot remember where. He invites Freddie to stay and attend the marriage of his daughter as long as he will make more moonshine, which Dodd has developed a taste for. Dodd begins an exercise with Freddie called \"Processing\", in which he asks Freddie a flurry of disturbing psychological questions. Freddie has a flashback to a past relationship with Doris, a young girl from his hometown to whom he promised one day to return.\n\nFreddie travels with Dodd's family as they spread the teachings of the Cause along the East Coast. At a dinner party in New York, a man questions Dodd's methods and statements and accuses the movement of being a [[cult]]. Dodd angrily berates him and asks him to leave. Freddie pursues the man to his apartment and assaults him that night, to Dodd's dismay.\n\nFreddie criticizes Dodd's son Val for disregarding his father's teachings, but Val tells Freddie that Dodd is making things up as he goes along. Dodd is arrested for practicing medicine without proper qualifications after one of his former hostesses has a change of heart; Freddie attacks the police officers and is also arrested. In jail, Freddie erupts in an angry tirade, questioning everything that Dodd has taught him and accusing him of being a fake. Dodd calls Freddie lazy and worthless and claims nobody likes him except for Dodd. They reconcile upon their release, but members of the Cause have become suspicious and fearful of Freddie, believing him to be deranged or an undercover agent or simply beyond their help. Dodd insists that Freddie's behavior can be corrected with more rigorous conditioning, which Freddie struggles to internalize.\n\nFreddie accompanies Dodd to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], to celebrate the release of Dodd's latest book. When Dodd's publisher criticizes the book, Freddie assaults him. Helen Sullivan, a previously acquiescent acolyte, causes Dodd to lose his temper after she questions some of the book's details. Dodd takes a small group to a salt flat, inviting them to play a game consisting of picking a point in the distance and driving towards it in a straight line on Dodd's motorcycle; Dodd demonstrates, and upon returning to the group he calls it thrilling. On Freddie's turn, Freddie drives off at high speed and disappears.\n\nFreddie returns home to [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], to visit Doris, but learns from Doris' mother that she has gotten married and started a family. Freddie sleeps in a movie theater and receives a phone call from Dodd, who begs Freddie to visit him in [[England]], where he now resides. Upon arriving, Freddie finds the Cause to have grown ever larger. Dodd states that if Freddie can find a way to live without a master, any master, then he is to \"let the rest of us know\" because he will be the first person in history to do so. Dodd then recounts that, in a past life, they had worked in Paris to send balloons across a blockade created by Prussian forces. Dodd gives him an ultimatum: devote himself to the Cause for life, or leave and never return. As Freddie suggests that they may meet again in the next life, Dodd claims that if they do, it will be as sworn enemies. Dodd sings \"[[On a Slow Boat to China]]\" as Freddie weeps. Freddie leaves and picks up a woman at a local pub, repeating questions from his first Processing session with Dodd as he is having sex with her.\n\nOn a beach, Freddie curls up to a crude sand sculpture of a woman he and his Navy comrades sculpted during the war.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Freddie Quell\n*[[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Lancaster Dodd\n*[[Amy Adams]] as Peggy Dodd\n*[[Laura Dern]] as Helen Sullivan\n*[[Ambyr Childers]] as Elizabeth Dodd\n*[[Rami Malek]] as Clark Massey\n*[[Jesse Plemons]] as Val Dodd\n*[[Kevin J.

However, the festival's jury originally intended to give the film the top [[Golden Lion]] prize for Best Film; the prize was removed and awarded to ''[[Piet\u00e0 (film)|Piet\u00e0]]'' instead, owing to a new rule that prohibited the award of acting and directing honors to the same film that won the Golden Lion prize.

The film received the former, with the latter being awarded to [[Silvio Orlando]] for his work in ''[[Giovanna's Father]]''.
