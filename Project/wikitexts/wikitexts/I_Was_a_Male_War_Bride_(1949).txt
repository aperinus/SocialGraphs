He is assigned American Lieutenant Catherine Gates as his driver, much to their mutual discomfort (arising from several prior clashes). The only available transportation is a [[motorcycle]] which, due to Army regulations, only Catherine is allowed to drive; Henri has to ride in the [[sidecar]]. After several mishaps, the constantly quarreling couple arrive at their destination, [[Bad Nauheim]].\n\nAt the hotel, bothered by back pain, Catherine warily accepts Henri's offer of a [[back rub]]. When she falls asleep, he tries to leave her room, but the exterior door handle falls off, trapping him inside. He spends an uncomfortable night in a chair. In the morning, she refuses to believe his story. Unknown to him, the innkeeper's wife has replaced the exterior knob, so when he tells Catherine to see for herself how the door will not open, it does. Eventually, the innkeeper's wife comes to the room, forcing Henri to hide on the ledge outside the window. The innkeeper's wife explains everything to Catherine, but not before Henri falls off the ledge.\n\nLater, Henri goes undercover to search for Schindler, now working in the [[black market]]. He refuses to let Catherine help him and tells her that if she sees him to pretend she does not know him. The black market is raided by the authorities, and he is rounded up with everyone else. When he asks her to vouch for his identity, she obeys his earlier order not to reveal that she knows him. While he is in jail, she finds Schindler, who is happy to leave Germany and ply his trade in [[France]]. Later, she apologizes to a furious Henri, and by the time they return to [[Heidelberg, Germany|Heidelberg]], they have fallen in love.\n\n[[Red tape]] forces Henri and Catherine to be married first in a [[Civil union|civil]] ceremony before they can each have their choice of ceremony: Army chaplain (Catherine) and church (Henri). Before they can consummate their marriage, she is ordered to report immediately to headquarters in the morning; her unit has been alerted they are about to be shipped back to the United States. They subsequently learn that the only way Henri can get a visa is under the [[War Brides Act]] as the spouse of an American soldier. After many misunderstandings, he is given permission to accompany her, but circumstances and Army regulations conspire to keep them from spending the night together.\n\nWhen they try to board the transport ship, [[United States Navy|Navy]] sailors do not believe that Henri is a war \"bride\". He is forced to dress as a female Army nurse to get aboard. The deception works, but once underway, his disguise is discovered and he is arrested. Catherine manages to straighten out the situation, and they finally have some privacy - in the ship's [[military prison|brig]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Capt.

Sheridan contracted [[pleurisy]] that developed into [[pneumonia]], suspending shooting for two weeks. Hawks broke out in unexplained [[hives]] all over his body. Grant came down with [[hepatitis]] complicated by [[jaundice]], and production was shut down for three months, until Grant recovered and regained around 30 pounds. When screenwriter Charles Lederer was ill, his friend [[Orson Welles]] wrote part of a short chase scene as a favor to him.<ref>[[Orson Welles|Welles, Orson]], and [[Peter Bogdanovich]], edited by [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]], ''[[This is Orson Welles]]''.
