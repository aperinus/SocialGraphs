The screenplay was adapted by [[John Kohn]] and Robert Bentley from Tony Kenrick's 1978 novel ''Faraday's Flowers''.\n\nProduced by [[George Harrison]]'s [[HandMade Films]] and distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], Harrison himself appeared as a night club singer, and recorded several songs for the soundtrack, including \"Breath Away from Heaven\", which was re-recorded and released on his 1987 album ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' along with \"Someplace Else\", also used in the film. The soundtrack was never officially released, and was only briefly available as a promotional single featuring the title track, coupled with \"Zig Zag\".<ref>Booklet included with ''Cloud Nine'' CD, released 2004.</ref> Both of these songs have since been released as \"additional tracks\" on the 2004 ''Cloud Nine'' re-release. Another track, \"The Hottest Gong in Town\", was included on the EP ''Songs by George Harrison Volume 2''.\n\n''Shanghai Surprise'' was a critical and [[box office bomb|commercial failure]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nGlendon Wasey is a sleazy, down-on-his-luck con man struggling to sell glow-in-the-dark neckties in Shanghai. When he encounters the lovely Gloria Tatlock, a [[missionary]] nurse who wants to obtain a supply of opium to ease the suffering of her patients, he decides to help her get hold of a stolen supply of the valuable drug. The only problem is that a lot of other people want to secure the stolen opium as well\u2014gangsters, smugglers, thugs and a host of upstanding air force recruits.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Glendon Wasey\n* [[Madonna]] as Gloria Tatlock\n* [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]] as Walter Faraday\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as Willie Tuttle\n* [[Philip Sayer]] as Justin Kronk\n* [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as Joe Go\n* [[George Harrison]] as Night Club Singer\n* [[Victor Wong (actor, born 1927)|Victor Wong]] as Ho Chong\n* [[Lim Kay Tong]] as Mei Gan\n\n==Marketing==\n''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' reported in October, 1986, \"The movie opened so poorly in its first wave of playdates (late August in the Northeast and Midwest) that MGM has made severe cuts in its marketing budget. One MGM exec was quoted in the trades as saying this was necessary because 'the interest in the film has been non-existent.'\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Ringel |first= Eleanor |title= Sean Penn, Madonna flop in ''Shanghai Surprise'' |work= [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date= 21 October 1986 |page= B/3}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nAn overwhelming number of critics panned ''Shanghai Surprise''.  Bill Cosford of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', granting it 1 star out of 4, wrote, \"In ''Shanghai Surprise'', as you may have heard, almost everything is just a bit off. Though widely anticipated as a musical, ''Shanghai Surprise'' is actually a kind of miniaturization of ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' / ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'', with a feisty heroine (Madonna) in the vain [sic] of Rita Hayworth in ''The Lady From Shanghai'', and a roguish adventure hero (Sean Penn) as well as a pop-sprinkled score (partly the work of George Harrison)... There's a plot here, involving Madonna's quest to find a load of hijacked opium for conversion to morphine to help the troops fighting the Japanese. Penn, though he spends his big scene panting in a brothel, will save the day. But the film was conceived and executed as a star vehicle. Wrong stars, wrong roles, not much happening here. And for George Harrison and his Handmade Films, the first big bust.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Cosford |first= Bill |title= This ''Surprise'' is Bad News |work= [[The Miami Herald]] |date= 20 October 1986 |page= 4C}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' also gave it only 1 star: \"''Shanghai Surprise'' is so dismally scripted and directed that no one could redeem it... an atmospheric, handsomely shot and, sadly, utterly empty piece of work.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Rickey |first= Carrie |title= Madonna Plays a Missionary, Sean Penn Sells Ties as They Pursue Opium and Each Other in ''Shanghai Surprise'' |work= [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date= 19 September 1986 |page= 8}}</ref> The ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' called it \"a turkey\": \"This film is bad. The acting is terrible. The hackneyed screenplay traffics in stereotype and yuk-yuk jokes. And the point is non-existent.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Roberts |first= Michael |title= Shanghai's Surprise is that it's so bad |work= [[Lexington Herald-Leader]] |date= 4 September 1986 |page= D5}}</ref>  The ''[[U-T San Diego|San Diego Union]]'' said, \"In its campy nostalgia for old adventure films, ''Shanghai Surprise'' is cloddish. There's something rotten at the core about a movie that would recycle lines like \"That's mighty white of you.\" Even sadder is the realization that some of the old cornball movies are still fresher, more alive, than this regurgitation.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Elliott |first= David |title= ''Shanghai'' isn't worth the trip |work= [[U-T San Diego|San Diego Union]] |date= 22 September 1986 |page= D-1}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' faulted the casting as well as the script: \"The ever-important spirit is missing as Mr. and Mrs. Penn wrestle with old gags that are beyond their ken. It's not entirely their fault though: They've been given no characters to play. Much of ''Shanghai Surprise'' might have worked if they at least were permitted to play themselves&nbsp;\u2014 a punk rocker and punk actor at large in an alien movie world.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Baltake |first= Joe |title= Laughing with the Penns in China |work= [[Philadelphia Daily News]]|date= 19 September 1986 |page= 59}}</ref>  The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', awarding the movie half a star, complained of its \"warped attitudes toward women,\" adding, \"It's hard to know for whom this wretch of a film was made. Idiotic dialogue should turn off the adults, teens will be disappointed by their rock heroine and kids shouldn't even be watching.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Voedisch |first= Lynn |title= Even Madonna can't save ''Shanghai'' |work= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date= 1 September 1986 |page= 22}}</ref> Film professor Michal Conford, of [[Ryerson University]], reviewed the film for the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' with another half-star rating, saying sardonically, \"''Shanghai Surprise'' stars Madonna and Sean Penn together for the first time and has songs by George Harrison. That is the most positive sentence that can be written about the film, now playing locally. MGM must have suspected \u2013 the company tried to open the film in places like Iowa to avoid getting slaughtered. Nice try... The film is supposed to be a shaggy dog adventure... Shaggy, no.
