The film was loosely based on the non-fiction book, ''[[You Are Going to Prison]]'' by [[Jim Hogshire]]. It was released in theatres November 17, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter serving three prison sentences, [[Habitual offender|repeat offender]] John Lyshitski plots revenge on Judge Nelson Biederman III, a tough judge who presided over each of his [[Bench trial|trials]], passing him stiff sentences. John calls the courthouse to determine when he will next preside over a case, only to discover that he died three days before John's release.\n\nJohn turns his attention to the late judge's obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV. At a dedication ceremony for Judge Biederman, he breaks into Nelson's car, emptying his emergency [[inhaler]]. After the ceremony, John stalks him in his van and a hyperventilating Nelson frantically searches through a pharmacy's shelves for a new inhaler. His erratic behavior horrifies the owners, who think he is a [[Substance dependence|junkie]]. \n\nAfter Nelson finally finds an inhaler, he uses it; then he holds it up to prove he means no harm, but the pharmacy owners mistake it for a [[pistol]] and call the police. John fires a real shot into the air. The gunshot further terrifies the shop owners, who think Nelson is shooting at them. The police arrive and arrest Nelson. John is ecstatic that Nelson has landed in the criminal justice system which he suffered in for so long at the hands of Nelson's father.\n\nNelson is charged with felony assault. Demanding that the Biederman Foundation get him acquitted, the board nearly complies. However, as they are fed up with him, they realize they can get rid of him. They purposely provide Nelson with a grossly incompetent defense team at the [[Jury trial|trial]]. The incompetent jury find Nelson guilty and he is sentenced to three to five years in state prison. \n\nJohn, not satisfied with Nelson merely going to prison, decides to join him there by purposely selling narcotics to undercover cops. At his trial before the same judge Nelson had, John pleads guilty and convinces her he be sentenced to three to five years in the same prison as Nelson. He becomes Nelson's cellmate, pretends to be his friend, and gives Nelson terrible advice on surviving in prison.\n\nDespite being an unhardened and inexperienced prisoner, Nelson gets himself out of the many situations that John's misinformation creates. He meets gang leader Barry, an imposing, brawny [[Homosexuality|gay]] fellow who coerces him into a relationship. Despite his intimidating appearance, Barry is a sensitive romantic, supplying potential romantic partners with his finest toilet-made [[Merlot]].\n\nNelson angers [[white supremacist]] gang leader Lynard, who vows to kill him. He gets his hands on a syringe containing deadly chemical, to commit suicide. Before he can do so, Lynard attacks him in his cell. The syringe falls out of Nelson's pocket, Lynard assumes it is [[heroin]] and injects himself, accidentally killing himself and Nelson earns the respect of and authority over the white supremacists, who believe Nelson had done it. \n\nNelson reaches his one-year parole hearing relatively unharmed, and as the new leader of the white supremacist gang for \"killing\" Lynard, who was violent and spiteful towards everyone including his fellow white supremacists. Nelson, who initially submits to being Barry's partner out of fear, grows to care for him, willingly playing along with the \"relationship\" to keep him happy. Nelson also protects Barry from Lynard's former cronies, who are now loyal to him.\n\nFrustrated with Nelson's newfound respect, John drugs Nelson and tattoos \"white power\" onto his forehead, causing Nelson's parole to be denied. Enraged, Nelson confronts John, who then confesses to causing him to end up in jail, so they get into a fight. John quickly realizes that he is now Nelson's target. The guards set up a death match between them. John and Nelson secretly hatch a plan to inject each other with a [[coma]]-inducing drug. The guards and prisoners believe they are dead and bury them. \n\nJust before the death match, Nelson had legally adopted Barry, who has been paroled, so he retakes control of the Biederman Foundation. Barry uses the Biederman Foundation's funds to bribe the mortician to skip the autopsy and later also digs up John and Nelson. John, Nelson and Barry begin a new chapter of life, starting a winery (the product is \"toilet wine\").\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as John Lyshitski\n* [[Will Arnett]] as Nelson Biederman IV\n* [[Chi McBride]] as Barry\n* [[David Koechner]] as Shanahan\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Warden\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Lynard\n* [[David Darlow (actor)|David Darlow]] as Judge Nelson Biederman III\n* [[Bob Odenkirk]] as Duane\n* A. J. Balance as John Lyshitski \u2013 18 years\n* [[Michael Hitchcock]] as Wine Taster\n* [[Tim Heidecker]] as Wine Taster\n* [[Eric Wareheim]] as Wine Taster\n\n==Production notes==\nThe defunct [[Joliet Prison]] in [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]], [[Illinois]] used for the film is the same prison featured in the beginning of ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980) and the first season of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] show ''[[Prison Break]]'' (2005).\n\nDuring the end credits, Chi McBride in character as Barry, sings a song called \"Shower with U\" (credited as \"Barry's Love Theme\" on the soundtrack) in which he repeatedly sings \"I wanna take a shower with you\".\n\nThe studio made significant alterations during the film's editing process that made Odenkirk unhappy with the final result (which also happened with the ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]'' film, ''[[Run Ronnie Run]]'', which Odenkirk wrote). According to writers Tom Lennon and Robert Ben Garant's appearance on the Nerdist Podcast from August 23, 2011, changes included a happier ending, the removal of a sparse drums-only score recorded by [[Meg White]] of [[The White Stripes]], and other alterations that made a significant change to the overall tone of the film.<ref>Elliott, Alan (October 4, 2005).
