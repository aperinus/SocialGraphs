[[James Brolin]] and [[Margot Kidder]] star as a young couple who purchase a home haunted by combative supernatural forces. The film is based on [[Jay Anson]]'s 1977 book ''[[The Amityville Horror]]'' and is the first entry in the [[Works based on the Amityville haunting|''Amityville Horror'' film series]]. A [[The Amityville Horror (2005 film)|remake]] was produced in 2005.\n\n''The Amityville Horror'' was a major commercial success for [[American International Pictures]], grossing over $80 million in the United States and going on to become one of the highest-grossing [[independent film]]s of all time. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, though some film scholars have considered it a classic of the horror genre.{{efn|In ''Now a Terrifying Motion Picture!: Twenty-Five Classic Works of Horror Adapted from Book to Film'' (2012), film scholar James F. Broderick notes that the film continues to make critics' lists of the best horror films of all time.{{sfn|Broderick|2012|p=17}}}} The film was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] by composer [[Lalo Schifrin]] and Kidder also earned a [[Saturn Award]] nomination for [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- See WP:FILMPLOT before editing. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn the early morning hours on November 13, 1974, [[Ronald DeFeo Jr.]] murders his entire family with a rifle at their home of 112 Ocean Avenue in [[Amityville, New York]].\n\nOne year later, George and Kathy Lutz, a young married couple, move into the property. George appears not to be strong of faith, but Kathy is a Catholic in name at least. She has three children from her prior marriage: Greg, Matt, and Amy. The couple turn to Father Delaney to quickly bless the home, but Delaney encounters troubles in trying to doing so, including a room full of flies, out of season; violent stomach sickness; and later, blisters on his palm when trying to make a phone call to Kathy at their home. The experience eventually stops when a door is opened and a voice demands Delaney to leave the property. He rushes out of the house, but decides to continue helping the Lutz family. Delaney is later involved in a car accident resulting from mysterious malfunctions, and he becomes frustrated at the lack of support from his superiors in the [[diocese]].\n\nKathy's aunt, a [[nun]], comes by the house one afternoon, but becomes violently ill. George begins to be more sullen and angry over perceived cold in the house, and obsesses with splitting logs and keeping the fireplace stoked. Before Kathy's brother's engagement party one night, $1,500 to be used for the caterer inexplicably goes missing in the house. Meanwhile, the babysitter watching Amy for the evening is locked inside a bedroom closet by an unseen force. Further unexplained incidents occur when one of the two boys suffers a crushed hand when a sash window falls on it, and Amy having an imaginary friend, Jody, who seems to be of a malevolent nature. Kathy catches a glimpse of two red, swine-like eyes outside the daughter's second-story bedroom window. Even the family dog, Harry, scratches obsessively (causing his paws to bleed) at a brick wall in the basement.\n\nGeorge's land surveying business begins to suffer with his lack of attendance, and his business partner, Jeff, grows concerned. Jeff's wife, Carolyn, very sensitive to the paranormal, is both repulsed and intrigued by the things she feels when at the house. While in the basement of the house, Carolyn begins demolishing a wall with a hammer, revealing a small room behind the wall.  Discovering the damage, George takes down the rest of the wall, observing a small room with red walls.  Carolyn, in terror, shrieks that they have found \"the passage... to Hell!\" \u2013 only her voice now sounds like Father Delaney's voice.\n\nBack at the church, Father Delaney prays impassionately to stop the evil in Amityville, but is blinded and suffers a mental breakdown. He is next seen sitting at a garden in an unresponsive state, his mind completely gone.\n\nThroughout the strange incidents, Kathy observes George's persistent waking up at 3:15&nbsp;a.m., feeling he must go check on the boathouse. She also has nightmares, in which she is given details about the killings of the home's prior family. Research at the library and county records office suggest that the house is built atop a [[Shinnecock Reservation|Shinnecock]] burial ground and that a known Satanic worshipper named John Ketchum had once lived on the land. She also discovers the news clippings about the DeFeo murders and notices Ronald DeFeo's striking resemblance to George.\n\nFinally, the paranormal events culminate one stormy night. Blood oozes from the walls and down the staircase; Jody, appearing as a large, red-eyed pig, is seen through a window; and George attempts to kill the children with an axe, but regains his wits after Kathy disrupts him. After falling through the basement stairs into a pit of black sludge while rescuing Harry, George and the rest of the family drive away, abandoning their home and belongings. A final intertitle reads: \"George and Kathleen Lutz and their family never reclaimed their house or their personal belongings. Today they live in another state.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[James Brolin]] as  [[The Amityville Horror|George Lutz]]\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as [[The Amityville Horror|Kathleen 'Kathy' Lutz]]\n* [[Rod Steiger]] as Father Francis 'Frank' Delaney\n* [[Don Stroud]] as Father Bolen\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] as Father Ryan\n* [[John Larch]] as Father Nuncio\n* Natasha Ryan as Amy Lutz\n* K.

The film is taut, tense, and filled with the bizarre, unsettling events chronicled in the book.\"{{sfn|Broderick|2012|p=17}} In a 2013 assessment, [[John Kenneth Muir]] called ''The Amityville Horror'' a \"blunt and effective horror film\" and discussed author [[Stephen King]]'s analysis of the film's subtext of financial turmoil.  Muir wrote, \"If one follows King's lead, it's easy to contextualize ''The Amityville Horror'' as a financial nightmare... Similarly, the movie's dialogue constantly references financial matters. \"Bills have to be paid,\" says one character. \"The [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] is calling,\" warns another. 'They'll nickel and dime you to death\" is a mantra not just about the bill collectors, perhaps, but a warning about the demons in the house.\"{{sfn|Muir|2013|p=322}} On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 30% of 44 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, and the average rating is 4.8/10. Its consensus reads, \"Dull and disappointing, the best that can be said for ''The Amityville Horror'' is that it set a low bar for its many sequels and remakes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_amityville_horror|title=The Amityville Horror|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=October 20, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
