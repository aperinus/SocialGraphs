Based on the 1975 [[The Mothman Prophecies|book of the same name]] by [[parapsychology|parapsychologist]] and [[Charles Fort|Fortean]] author [[John Keel]], the screenplay was written by Richard Hatem.\n\nThe story follows John Klein (Gere), a reporter who researches the legend of the [[Mothman]]. Still shaken by the death of his wife two years earlier from Glioblastoma, Klein is sent to cover a news piece and ends up inexplicably finding himself in [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], where there have been sightings of an unusual creature and other unexplained phenomena. As he becomes increasingly drawn into mysterious forces at work, he hopes they can reconnect him to his wife, while the local sheriff (Linney) becomes concerned about his obsessions.\n\nThe film claims to be based on actual events that occurred between November 1966 and December 1967 in Point Pleasant, as described by Keel. It was shot in [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]] and was released to mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist John Klein and his wife Mary are involved in a car accident when Mary swerves to avoid a huge, flying, black figure that only she witnesses. John survives the crash unscathed, but Mary is hospitalized. There she is diagnosed with an unrelated [[glioblastoma|brain tumor]] and shortly thereafter passes away. John discovers her sketchbook of terrifying drawings of a \"mothlike\" creature with red eyes she drew over and over while hospitalized.\n\nTwo years later, driving in the middle of the night to [[Richmond, Virginia]] from [[Washington, D.C.]], his car breaks down, and he walks to a nearby house to get help. The owner, Gordon Smallwood, reacts violently to John's appearance and holds him at gunpoint. Local police officer Connie Mills defuses the situation while Gordon explains that this is the third consecutive night John has knocked on his door at 2:30 AM asking to use the phone. Connie and John try to make sense of these events. John checks in at a local motel and discovers he is in [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], hundreds of miles off his route and having travelled the distance impossibly fast. He ponders how he ended up so far from his original destination.\n\nOfficer Mills discloses to John that many strange things have been occurring in the past few weeks and that people have reported seeing a large winged creature like a giant [[moth]] with red eyes, with some witnesses making drawings of the creature that match Mary's. She also tells him about a strange dream she had, in which the words \"Wake up, Number 37\" were spoken to her as she drifts in open water. During a conversation with Gordon, he reveals to John that he has heard voices coming from his sink telling him that, in [[Denver]], \"99 will die.\" While discussing the day's events at a local diner, John notices that the news is showing the story of an airplane crash in Denver that killed all 99 passengers and crew aboard.\n\nThe next night Gordon frantically explains that the voices in his head emanate from a being named Indrid Cold. Later on, Gordon calls John and says that he is standing next to Indrid Cold. While John keeps Cold on the line, Officer Mills checks on Gordon. Cold gives John details about his life that only he knows and John tests Cold with questions that only someone in the same room could answer correctly, which Cold does. John is convinced that Cold is a supernatural being.\n\nThis particular event escalates a string of supernatural calls to John's motel room from Cold. One tells him that there will be a great tragedy on the [[Ohio River]]. Later, John receives a cryptic call from Gordon and rushes to his home to check on him. He finds Gordon outside, dead from [[Hypothermia|exposure]], though the police estimate that he died hours before he called John.\n\nJohn becomes obsessed with the local \"Mothman\" legend as some of the messages and apparitions imitate Mary, and he arranges to meet an expert on the subject, Alexander Leek. Leek explains its enigmatic nature and discourages John from becoming further involved, warning him that attempting to prevent predicted events is futile. However, when John learns the [[Governor of West Virginia|governor]] plans to tour a chemical plant located on the Ohio River the following day, he becomes convinced the tragedy will occur there. Officer Mills and the governor ignore his warnings, and nothing happens during the tour. \n\nSoon after, John receives a mysterious letter that instructs him to await a call from his deceased wife Mary back in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] on [[Christmas Eve]] at noon. He returns home to wait for her call. On [[Christmas Eve]], Officer Mills calls John to convince him to ignore the phone call from \"Mary,\" return to Point Pleasant, and join her and her family for Christmas Eve dinner. She says he shouldn't be alone on that night as it is \"no way to be,\" then ends the call to allow John to make a decision. Though anguished, John realizes his obsession is isolating him, and decides to return to Point Pleasant to spend the holiday with Officer Mills. \n\nAs John reaches the [[Silver Bridge]], malfunctioning [[traffic light]]s cause traffic congestion on the bridge. Hearing the bolts and supports of the bridge strain, John realizes that the prophesied tragedy on the Ohio River was about the bridge, not the power plant. The bridge comes apart, and as it collapses, Officer Mills' car falls into the water. John jumps in after her and pulls her from the river to safety. As the two sit in the back of an ambulance they are informed that 36 people have been killed. That makes Connie the \"number 37\" from her dream.\n\nThe film ends with a claim that the [[Silver_Bridge#Wreckage_analysis|cause of the bridge collapse]] was never fully determined, and that although Mothman has been sighted in other parts of the world, it was never seen again in Point Pleasant.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Richardgere.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Leading actor Richard Gere who portrayed the protagonist John Klein]]\n* [[Richard Gere]] as John Klein\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Connie Mills\n* [[Will Patton]] as Gordon Smallwood\n* [[Debra Messing]] as Mary Klein\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Denise Smallwood\n* [[Alan Bates]] as Alexander Leek\n* [[David Eigenberg]] as Ed Fleischman\n* Bob Tracey as Cyrus Bills\n* Bill Laing as Indrid Cold\n* [[Mark Pellington]] as Bartender / Indrid Cold (voice)\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\n[[File:Mothman2.jpg|200px |left |thumb |Film critics have interpreted the film's portrayal of [[Mothman]] as demonic.]]\nWriter Paul Meehan judged the film's explanation of the Mothman to be a \"confused mish-mosh of [[science fiction]] and [[demonology]]\" and likened it to the television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', though preserving Keel's \"breathless hysteria.\"{{sfn|Meehan|2009|p=130}} Meehan remarked that \"Aliens spouting prophetic utterances are rare in UFO literature.\" {{sfn|Meehan|2009|p=130}}\n\nIn contrast to Meehan, author Jason Horsley declared ''The Mothman Prophecies'' \"probably the most effective depiction of demonic forces at work\" in U.S. cinema.{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=197}} Horsley assessed its approach to the Mothman legend as depicting a \"schizophrenic nature of reality,\" fulfilling a \"revelation\" purpose in [[horror film]], as it \"strips away the comfortable veneer of consensus reality to reveal the seething abyss of irrationality.\"{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=197}} Horsley argued the film's Mothman arrives from a foreign dimension, but being without \"physical existence,\" it is also a product of the minds of Point Pleasant's citizens, based on \"formless and impersonal energy.\"{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=198}} The Mothman, identified by Horsley as \"emissary of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|Id]],\" is depicted in the film as being as natural as electricity.{{sfn|Horsley|2009|p=198}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Carl Franklin]] was originally attached to direct Richard Hatem's [[spec script]] before [[Mark Pellington]] was hired.<ref>{{cite news|author=Petrikin, Chris|title=Fox puts Armitage in Doud's 'Body'|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/fox-puts-armitage-in-doud-s-body-1117500041/|work=Variety|date=May 5, 1999|access-date=July 25, 2015}}</ref> Pellington rejected numerous screenplay drafts as literal interpretations of Keel's book, and wished to explore psychological drama in UFO witnesses.<ref name=\"Rickard\">{{cite web|last=Rickard |first=Bob |title=The moth man cometh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/22/artsfeatures3 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 22, 2002 |access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn reality, 46 people died in the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]], not 36 as depicted in the film. The motion picture's claim at the end credits of the collapse of the Silver Bridge never being explained is false; the incident was found to be caused by the failure of an [[Eyebar|eye-bar]] in a suspension chain in 1971, well before the publication of the book on which the film is based, let alone the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=cJ1eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MVMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4537,3056163|newspaper=The Portsmouth Times|date=28 May 1976|page=12|title=Claims In Disaster Denied}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvhs1504.html |title=The Collapse of the Silver Bridge-by Chris LeRose |publisher=Wvculture.org |access-date=2009-07-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830051225/http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvhs1504.html |archive-date=2013-08-30 }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Image:Kittanning Citizen's Bridge.JPG|thumb|200px|Kittanning Citizens Bridge]]\nAside from a few opening scenes filmed in [[Washington, D.C.]], most of the motion picture was filmed in the areas of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania|Kittanning]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. The scenes of Gere sitting on a park bench are on the [[University of Pittsburgh]] campus.{{sfn|Tiech|2014|p=72}} Road montages were filmed on [[Pennsylvania Route 28]], and the [[Chicago]] scenes are completely shot in downtown Pittsburgh\u2019s [[Mellon Square]] and Trinity Churchyard environs as well as the entrance to the Duquesne Club. The \"Chemical Plant\" featured in the movie is actually a power station owned by Reliant Energy in Elrama, Pennsylvania. The Avalon Motor Inn is in [[Eighty Four, Pennsylvania]], though scenes set indoors were built as separate sets, as the inn's atmosphere could not accommodate production.{{sfn|Tiech|2014|p=73}} Point Pleasant scenes were shot in [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]].  The hospital scenes were filmed at St. Frances Medical Center which is now the site of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.\nThe collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]] was actually filmed at the [[Kittanning Citizens Bridge]] in downtown Kittanning. Scenes shot at Gordon Smallwood\u2019s house were filmed in Washington County on [[Pennsylvania Route 917]]. [[Allegheny County Airport]], in the Pittsburgh suburb of West Mifflin, serves as backdrop for the airfield scenes. Despite this relocation, several police officers from Point Pleasant appeared as extras.<ref>{{cite web |author=Spiderweb 2000 Solutions |url=http://www.mothmanmuseum.com/MothmanLives/mothmanmovie/register/pointpleasantregister1.html |title=Point Pleasant Register \u2013 Mothman |publisher=Mothmanmuseum.com |access-date=2009-07-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717004446/http://www.mothmanmuseum.com/MothmanLives/mothmanmovie/register/pointpleasantregister1.html |archive-date=2009-07-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe film's musical score was composed by the creative lab [[tomandandy]].
