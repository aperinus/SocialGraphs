Because there are only three known photographs of Darger, and because of his reclusive lifestyle, the film is mostly a narrated biographical account, accompanied by animated versions of events from his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', which is also surveyed in detail. Interviews with his few neighbors and other acquaintances are included. The film's use of a child actor as its narrator is also unconventional as Dakota Fanning was only seven years old when she narrated the film.<ref>[https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Realms-Unreal-894.html CINEMABLEND]</ref><ref>[https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/in-the-realms-of-the-unreal/ Slant Magazine]</ref><ref>[https://www.deseret.com/2005/4/7/20090816/film-review-in-the-realms-of-the-unreal Deseret News]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has a 70% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a score of 74 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_realms_of_the_unreal Rotten Tomatoes]</ref><ref>[https://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-the-realms-of-the-unreal Metacritic]</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\nThe film won the [[National Film Board of Canada|National Film Board]] Award for Best Documentary at the 2004 [[Vancouver International Film Festival]]<ref>[https://www.indiewire.com/2004/11/wellspring-announces-deal-for-oscar-contender-in-the-realms-of-the-unreal-78541/ Wellspring Announces Deal for Oscar Contender \u201cIn The Realms of the Unreal\u201d|IndieWire]</ref> while it was also nominated for [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay|Best Documentary Screenplay]] from the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2004|Writers Guild of America]] and a [[Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Documentary|Gotham Award for Best Documentary]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2004 Winners and nominees|url=http://gotham.ifp.org/flash/Timeline/2004.html|publisher=Gotham Independent Film Awards|accessdate=January 1, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219132210/http://gotham.ifp.org/flash/Timeline/2004.html|archivedate=February 19, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WGA serves up 1st doc kudo to 'Super'|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/awards/wga-serves-up-1st-doc-kudo-to-super-1117918019/|website=variety.com|publisher=Variety|accessdate=18 February 2019|date=15 February 2005}}</ref><ref>[https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/gotham-awards-laud-best-indie-features-1117913337/ Gotham Awards laud best indie features - Variety]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2005/intherealms/index.html ''In the Realms of the Unreal''] at [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS.org]]\n*{{IMDb title|0390123}}\n*[http://officialhenrydarger.com/images/ Official website]\n\n{{Jessica Yu}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 animated films]]\n[[Category:2004 documentary films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American films with live action and animation]]\n[[Category:American animated documentary films]]\n[[Category:Collage film]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about painters]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jessica Yu]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jeff Beal]]\n[[Category:POV (TV series) films]]\n[[Category:Works about outsider art]]"}]}}}}
