The screenplay, which was inspired by the Southwest Dekalb High School Drumline, was [[Screenwriter|written]] by Tina Gordon Chism and Shawn Schepps. The film follows a young [[drummer]] from [[New York City|New York]], played by [[Nick Cannon]], who enters the fictional Atlanta A&T University and bumps heads with the leader of his new school's drum section. [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]], [[Leonard Roberts]] and [[Orlando Jones]] also co-star.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with most of them praising the musical bands' overall performances. It was a success at the box office, earning over $56&nbsp;million in the U.S., and almost $1.2&nbsp;million in foreign markets.\n\nA direct sequel ''[[Drumline: A New Beat]]'', premiered on [[VH1]] on October 27, 2014. Cannon reprises his role as Devon, albeit as a supporting character rather than the protagonist.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around Devon Miles, a teen who has just graduated from high school in [[New York City]]. Upon graduating, Devon heads to [[Atlanta, Georgia]] to attend Atlanta A&T University, a [[historically black college]] that takes enormous pride in its marching band. En route to A&T, Devon befriends fellow band mates Charles, Jayson, and Ernest. Devon was personally invited to attend on a full scholarship by Dr. Lee, head of the band, for his prodigious talents. The A&T band separates itself from its competitors by requiring all members to read music, by focusing on various styles of music rather than what is currently popular on the radio, and by dedication to the teamwork emphasized \"one band, one sound\" concept. Preseason band camp is physically and mentally challenging, designed to push members past what they previously thought were their limits. At the end of preseason, the musicians audition for spots on the field, and Devon is the only freshman to make P1, the highest level player. While going through this rigorous process, Devon also finds time to romance an upperclassman dancer, Laila.\n\nCollege life starts well for Devon, as he has a girlfriend and a spot on the field. Things begin to sour when Sean, Devon's percussion leader, begins to grow weary of Devon's cocky attitude. Sean later challenges Devon to take a solo in his first game, believing the freshman will panic and be embarrassed in front of everyone. Sean is shocked and subsequently humiliated when Devon takes the solo, upsetting Dr. Lee. As punishment, Dr. Lee orders Sean to clean the drums. This sets up some tension in the drumline which is exacerbated when Dr. Lee is told by President Wagner, the school's president, to change his focus from music to entertainment, otherwise he could potentially lose his funding. Lee does not want to give Devon more playing time because of Devon\u2019s lack of respect and selfish attitude. Upon learning he lied on his college application about knowing how to read music, Devon is demoted to P4 by Dr. Lee until he learns, then later put back on P1 when Wagner pressures Dr. Lee to do so. However, after inflaming a melee with a visiting band at A&T's homecoming game after Devon plays on a opposing band member's drum (a serious insult in drumline mythos), Devon is expelled from the band by Dr. Lee. The fight also strains his relationship with Laila, as she is embarrassed to introduce him to her parents, who attended the game.\n\nDevon contacts A&T's rival school [[Morris Brown College]], to discuss playing for their band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not need to know how to read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes Mr. Wade was merely trying to use him to steal A&T's performance plans, and that his heart and honor are still with the A&T band. Disgusted with both Mr. Wade and himself, he rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A&T.\n\nThough Devon is still not playing for the band, he refuses to give up his drumming. After receiving cassette tapes from his estranged father, Ray, Devon gets inspiration for new drum arrangements. As Devon goes to present these ideas to the band, he and Sean have a final confrontation that clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides to use them for the Classic. Devon helps the band prepare for the Classic and patches up his relationship with Laila. In appreciation for all his help getting the band ready for the Classic and impressed with Devon's maturing and growth, Dr. Lee tells Devon he can return to the band the following school year.\n\nAt the Classic, the bands are shown performing a mixture of popular songs. Morris Brown's band even gets rapper [[Petey Pablo]] to perform during their routine. A&T is not fazed by this and performs their mix of retro and current sounds. A tie results in the Morris Brown and A&T drumlines facing off against each other. Dr. Lee allows Devon to play for this face-off, showing his faith in Devon's improved character and in thanks for all the hard work he has done in getting the band ready for the Classic. Morris Brown goes first and A&T responds. Morris Brown's second cadence includes their snares moving forward and playing on the A&T drums (the same move that incited the fight at A&T's homecoming game), then throwing down their sticks. The A&T line manages to hold their composure in the face of the insult. They play their cadence and in the middle throw down their sticks, mimicking the Morris Brown actions, but then the entire line pulls out another set of sticks and continues playing. They end their routine in the faces of the Morris Brown drumline, but instead of playing on their drums, the line all drop their sticks onto the other drumline's drums. The judges award the win to A&T.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n*[[Nick Cannon]] as Devon Miles\n*[[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]] as Laila\n*[[Orlando Jones]] as Dr. Lee\n*[[Leonard Roberts]] as Sean Taylor\n*[[Jason Weaver]] as Ernest\n*[[J.
