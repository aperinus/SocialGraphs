Silverman addresses a number of topics, including [[religion]], [[AIDS]], [[the Holocaust]], [[racism|race]], [[sexism]], [[political parties]], people with [[disability|disabilities]], [[homeless]] people, and [[dwarfism|dwarves]]. Silverman also performs several original songs in the film.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benedictus|first=Leo|title=Comedy gold: Sarah Silverman's Jesus is Magic|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/mar/21/sarah-silverman-jesus-is-magic|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released November 11, 2005 in eight theatres. Receiving positive reviews, it made just under $125,000 during opening weekend. Its performance led to an expanded release in as many as 57 theatres, resulting in a [[box office]] take of more than $1.2 million. The film was released on DVD on June 6, 2006 in the United States, June 13 in Canada, and October 13, 2008 in the [[United Kingdom]]. A soundtrack CD was also released featuring most of the musical numbers, excerpts from Silverman's stand-up comedy, and several additional songs which did not appear in the film.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nJesus is Magic has been the subject of mixed reviews. [[A. O. Scott]] of the [[New York Times]] believed that the film's comedic value rests too heavily on the shock value of having such irreverent jokes delivered via the [[Jewish American Princess]] persona embodied by Silverman. Mr. Scott wrote, \"Most of the humor in 'Jesus Is Magic' depends on the scandal of hearing a nice, middle-class Jewish girl make jokes about rape, anal sex, the Holocaust and AIDS. She makes fun of religion. She riffs on 9/11. But Ms. Silverman is not smashing taboos so much as she is desperately searching for them.\"<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=A Comic in Search of the Discomfort Zone|first=A.

Using as an example of Silverman's off-color joke that \u201cbeing raped by a doctor\u201d could be \u201ckind of bittersweet for a Jewish girl,\u201d Benedictus concluded that \u201cit's not the Jewish stereotype that really powers the laugh, or the perfect inappropriateness of [Silverman\u2019s words], it's the flip of mood from: \u2018Here's something you can't joke about\u2019 to, \u2018Oh yes you can.\u2019 Dangerous \u2013 and liberating.\u201d <ref>Benedictus, Leo.
