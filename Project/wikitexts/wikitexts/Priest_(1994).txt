The screenplay by [[Jimmy McGovern]] concerns a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] priest ([[Linus Roache]]) as he struggles with two difficulties that precipitate a crisis of faith. The film's release was controversial and received condemnation from the Church.\n\n==Plot==\nFather Greg Pilkington, newly assigned to St Mary's parish in inner-city [[Liverpool]], is startled to discover Father Matthew Thomas is engaged in a sexual relationship with rectory housekeeper Maria Kerrigan. Moreover, Father Thomas is a [[left-wing]] radical and an outspoken proponent of [[Liberation Theology]], leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishop\u2014who nevertheless appreciates his abilities.\n\nWhile the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of [[celibacy]], he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets a man named Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship.\n\nMeanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she is being [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by her father, who confirms her story and displays no guilt nor any desire to stop. Both have revealed their secret in the [[confessional]], however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the [[Sacrament of Penance]] and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband.\n\nWhen Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. He pleads guilty to the charge, and the fact that he is a Catholic priest makes for a sensational news item. The story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest. Father Matthew persuades him to return to St Mary's, and the two preside over a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] that is disrupted by the loud protests of people opposed to Father Greg's presence at the altar. Father Matthew demands they leave the church. The two priests then begin to distribute the [[Eucharist]], but the remaining parishioners ignore Father Greg and line up to receive communion from Father Matthew. Lisa finally approaches the younger priest, and the two fall into each other's arms, sobbing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Linus Roache]] as Father Greg Pilkington\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Father Matthew Thomas\n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as Graham\n* [[Cathy Tyson]] as Maria Kerrigan\n* [[Christine Tremarco]] as Lisa Unsworth\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Mr. Unsworth\n* [[Lesley Sharp]] as Mrs. Unsworth\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[Blundellsands]], Liverpool, London, and [[Manchester]].\n\n==Release==\n''Priest'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 1994 and was one of the most talked about films. [[Miramax]] acquired the US distribution rights for $1.75 million and spent a further $500,000 on prints and advertising.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 2, 1995|page=13|last=Klady|first=Leonard|title=Indie niche getting packed with product}}</ref> The film received very vocal condemnation from the Church, with the [[Catholic Church in Ireland]] in particular calling for a ban on theatrical distribution. This marked the first major disagreement between the Church and the [[Irish Film Censor Board]], which decided to release it anyway. It went into general release in the UK on 17 March 1995 and into limited release on 8 screens in the US the following week. Catholic organizations in the United States, including the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] and the [[American Life League]], were in an uproar over its planned nationwide release by Miramax during Easter weekend, calling the film \"smut,\" \"blasphemous\" and \"sacrilegious\"; staged a national boycott over Miramax parent, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]; demanded that the film be withdrawn and called for Disney president [[Michael Eisner]] to be fired.<ref name = \"Ryll 2014\">{{cite web |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/watch-making-love/ |title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, Making Love |author=Alexander Ryll |publisher=Gay Essential |access-date=7 February 2015 |archive-date=2 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402072047/https://gay-themed-films.com/watch-making-love/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 3, 1995|page=24|title='Priest' foes pass over Miramax, boycott Disney|last=Evans|first=Greg}}</ref> Exhibitors in New Jersey received threats, including bomb threats, warning against screening the film.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=April 24, 1995|page=14|title=Limbaugh talker balks at anti-'Priest' ads|last=Evans|first=Greg}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a 64% approval rating based on 25 critical responses, with an average rating of 7/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/priest_1995|title=Priest (1995)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=7 June 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' rated the film one star out of a possible four, calling the screenplay \"shallow and exploitative.\" He added, \"The movie argues that the hidebound and outdated rules of the church are responsible for some people (priests) not having sex although they should, while others (incestuous parents) can keep on having it although they shouldn't. For this movie to be described as a moral statement about anything other than the filmmaker's prejudices is beyond belief.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/priest-1995 |title=Priest Movie Review & Film Summary (1995) |author-link=Roger Ebert |first=Roger |last=Ebert |website=rogerebert.suntimes.com }}</ref>\n\nPeter Stack of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called it \"an exceptional movie,\" \"powerful drama,\" and \"a curiously inspiring statement about faith and morality.\" He added, \"This film is extraordinary for the themes it explores\u2014sometimes with delicious humor\u2014beyond the obvious{{nbsp}}...

And although ''Priest'' is not without intelligence, humor and pathos, in the end it's little more than a tendentious [[melodrama]]. One can sympathize with [its] progressive politics{{nbsp}}... and still feel that director Antonia Bird and screenwriter Jimmy McGovern have made things much too easy for themselves{{nbsp}}... ''Priest'' is less a work of art than an [[Op-ed]] piece; as such, whatever virtues it has exist in the sociological sphere, not the aesthetic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1995/04/07/WEEKEND149.dtl|title=Priest' fails to live up to its calling|date=7 April 1995}}</ref>\n\nRita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, \"Part soap opera and part propaganda, this sometimes affecting drama presents a one-sided examination of the church's teachings on homosexuality and the celibacy of its clergy{{nbsp}}... Roache, a veteran of British stage and television, gives a stirring performance, which crests in the film's transcendent finale.
