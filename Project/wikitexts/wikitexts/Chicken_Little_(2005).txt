It is loosely based on the [[Henny Penny|\"Henny Penny\" Anglo-Saxon fairy tale]]. The 46th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], it was directed by [[Mark Dindal]] from a screenplay by [[Steve Bencich]], [[Ron J. Friedman]], and Ron Anderson, based on a story by Mark Kennedy and Dindal. In this version, the title character is ridiculed by his town for causing a panic, thinking that the sky was \"falling\". A year later he attempts to fix his reputation, followed by an unexpected truth regarding his past being revealed. The film is dedicated to Disney artist and writer [[Joe Grant]], who died before the film's release. This also marked the final film appearance of [[Don Knotts]] during his lifetime, as his next and final film, ''[[Air Buddies]]'' (another Disney-produced film that was released just over a year later), would be released posthumously.\n\n''Chicken Little'' was animated in-house at Walt Disney Feature Animation's main headquarters in [[Burbank, California]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] on November 4, 2005, in [[Disney Digital 3-D]] (the first film to be released in this format) along with the standard 2D version. It is Disney's first fully computer-animated feature film, as [[Pixar]]'s films were distributed but not produced by Disney, and ''[[Dinosaur (2000 film)|Dinosaur]]'' (2000) was a combination of live-action and computer animation which in turn was provided by division [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#The Secret Lab|The Secret Lab]].\n\n''Chicken Little'' was Disney's second adaptation of the fable after a [[Chicken Little (1943 film)|propaganda cartoon]] made during [[World War II]], serving as a loose remake to the cartoon.<ref>{{cite magazine |last = Willman |first = Chris |title = Chicken Little |url = https://www.ew.com/article/2006/03/17/chicken-little|access-date=July 9, 2015 |magazine = Entertainment Weekly |date = March 17, 2006 |quote = This Chicken Little feature wasn\u2019t Disney\u2019s first stab at animating the enduring fable of animal alarmism.

This sends the whole town into a frenzied [[panic]]. Eventually, the head of the Fire Department calms down enough to ask him what is going on. Chicken Little exclaims that the sky is falling, because a mysterious piece of the sky shaped like the nearby [[stop sign]] had fallen on his head when he was sitting under the big oak tree in the town square; however, he is unable to find the piece. His father, Buck \"Ace\" Cluck, who was once a middle school baseball star, assumes that the \"piece of the sky\" was just an acorn that has fallen off the tree and has also hit him on the head, making Chicken Little the laughingstock of the town.\n\nA year later, Chicken Little has earned a reputation in the town for being prone to ruin everything accidentally. His only friends are outcasts like himself: Abby \"Ugly Duckling\" Mallard, an obese and cowardly pig named Master Runt of the Litter, and Fish Out of Water, who wears a helmet full of tap water to breathe. Trying to help, Abby encourages Chicken Little to talk to his father, but he only wants to make his dad proud of him. He joins his school's baseball team to recover his reputation and his father's pride but is made last until the ninth inning of the last game. Chicken Little is reluctantly called to bat by the coach. Chicken Little hits the ball on his third swing and makes it past first, second, and third bases, but is met at home plate by the outfielders. He tries sliding onto the home plate but is touched by the ball. While it is presumed that he lost the game, the umpire brushes away the dust to reveal Chicken Little's foot is barely touching home plate, thus declaring Chicken Little safe and the game won; Chicken Little is hailed as a hero for winning the pennant.\n\nLater that night back at home, Chicken Little is hit on the head yet again by the same \"piece of the sky\" \u2014 only to find out that it is not actually a piece of the sky, but a hexagonal panel that blends into the background, which thereby explains why he was unable to find it last time. He calls his friends over to help figure out what it is. When Fish pushes a button on the back of the panel, it flies into the sky, taking him with it. It turns out to be part of the camouflage of a [[UFO]] piloted by two aliens in metallic armor. After \"rescuing\" Fish, they are horrified to see that the aliens are heading for Earth. Alerted by Fish\u2019s escape, the aliens give pursuit to Chicken Little and his friends throughout a cornfield. Just as they are cornered, the four narrowly escape and rush back to the school, where Chicken Little manages to ring the bell to warn everyone, but the aliens escape, leaving an orange alien child behind. Despite this, the citizens have their doubts over the story and Chicken Little's reputation is thus ruined.\n\nThe next morning, he and his friends discover the alien child, whose name is Kirby, just as a whole fleet of alien spaceships descend on the town and start what appears to be an invasion. However, the invasion is a misunderstanding, as the two aliens are looking for their lost child and attack only out of concern. As the aliens rampage throughout Oakey Oaks, vaporizing everything in their path, Chicken Little realizes he must return Kirby to his parents to save the town. First, though, he must confront his father and regain his trust. In the invasion, Buck, now regaining his pride and trust in his son, defends him from the aliens until they get vaporized. It is then discovered that the aliens were not vaporizing people but teleporting them aboard the UFO. Chicken Little and his father return Kirby. It turns out the aliens were merely touring Earth every summer while on their way to visit family, and they came to the town for its acorns due to Earth being the only place that has acorns and that their town welcoming sign says \"the best acorns in the universe\". It is also revealed that the panel that fell off their ship is malfunctioning. After everything is explained, the apologetic aliens return everything to normal, and everyone is grateful for Chicken Little's efforts to save the town.\n\nAnother year later, Chicken Little, Buck, his friends and the citizens of Oakey Oaks watch an in-universe movie depicting an extremely fanciful retelling of the events that transpired, portraying Chicken Little as an action hero named Ace.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Zach Braff]] as Ace \"Chicken Little\" Cluck, a young and diminutive [[rooster]], who suffers from a reputation for being called crazy when he caused a panic when he thought that the sky was falling.\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Abigail \"Abby\" Mallard (also known as the Ugly Duckling), a female [[duck]] (implied swan) with buckteeth.
