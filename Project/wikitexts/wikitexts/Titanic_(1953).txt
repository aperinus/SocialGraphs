It centers on an estranged couple on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the {{RMS|Titanic}}, which took place in April 1912.\n\nIt was the first ''Titanic'' film for 20th Century Fox, which also released the [[Titanic (1997 film)|1997 film of the same title]] internationally, while  [[Paramount Pictures]] handled the North American distribution.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the last minute, Richard Sturges ([[Clifton Webb]]), a wealthy expatriate in Europe, offers a [[Basques|Basque]] emigrant money for his [[steerage (deck)|steerage]]-class ticket (the lowest class) for the maiden voyage of the RMS ''Titanic''\u2014and succeeds. Once aboard, he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia ([[Barbara Stanwyck]]). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette ([[Audrey Dalton]]) and ten-year-old Norman ([[William Harper Carter|Harper Carter]]), to her hometown of [[Mackinac Island, Michigan]], to rear them as down-to-earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself.\n\nAs the ship is prepared for departure, the company representative suggests to captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]] ([[Brian Aherne]]) that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed.\n \nOther passengers include Maude Young (based on real-life Titanic survivor [[Margaret Brown|Margaret \"Molly\" Brown]]), a wealthy woman of a [[working class|working-class]] origin ([[Thelma Ritter]]); social-climbing Earl Meeker ([[Allyn Joslyn]]); a 20-year-old [[Purdue University]] [[tennis]] player, Gifford \"Giff\" Rogers ([[Robert Wagner]]); and George S. Healey ([[Richard Basehart]]), a Catholic priest who has been [[Defrocking|defrocked]] for [[alcoholism]].\n\nWhen Annette learns Julia's intentions, she insists on returning to Europe with Richard on the next ship as soon as they reach America. Julia concedes that Annette is old enough to make her own decisions, but she insists on keeping custody of Norman. This angers Richard, forcing Julia to reveal that Norman is not his son, but rather the result of a one-night stand after one of their many bitter arguments. Upon hearing that, he agrees to give up all claim to Norman. He joins Maude, Earl, and [[George Dunton Widener|George Widener]] in the lounge to play [[auction bridge]] with them. The next morning, when Norman reminds him of a shuffleboard game they had arranged, he coldly brushes him off.\n\nMeanwhile, Giff falls for Annette at first glance. At first she repulses his brash attempts to become better acquainted, but eventually warms to him. That night, Giff, Annette, and a group of young people sing and play the piano in the dining room, while Captain Smith watches from a corner table.\n\nSecond Officer [[Charles Lightoller]] ([[Edmund Purdom]]) expresses his concern to Captain Smith about the ship's speed when they receive two messages from other ships warning of iceberg sightings near their route. However, Smith assures him there is no danger.\n\nThat night, the lookout spots an iceberg dead ahead. The crew tries to steer clear of danger, but the ship is gashed below the [[waterline]] and begins taking on water. When Richard finds Captain Smith, he insists on being told the truth: The ship is doomed and there are not enough lifeboats for everyone on board. He tells his family to dress warmly but properly; then they head outside.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Titanic (1953).jpg|left|border|Titanic at the time of the collision in the film]] -->\nRichard and Julia have a tearful reconciliation on the boat deck, as he places her, Annette, and Norman into a lifeboat. Unnoticed by Julia, Norman gives up his seat to an older woman and goes looking for Richard. When one of the lines becomes tangled, preventing the boat from being lowered, Giff climbs down and fixes it, only to lose his grip and fall into the water. Unconscious but alive, he is dragged onto the boat.\n\nMeeker disguises himself as a woman to board a lifeboat, but Maude Young notices his shoes and unmasks him in front of the others. At the other end of the spectrum of courage and unselfishness, George Healey heads down into one of the boiler rooms to comfort injured crewmen.\n\nAs the ''Titanic'' is in her final moments, Norman and Richard find each other. Richard tells a passing steward that Norman is his \"son\" and then tells Norman that he has been proud of him every day of his life. Then they join the rest of the doomed passengers and the crew in singing the hymn \"[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]\".  As the last boiler explodes, the ''Titanic''{{'}}s bow plunges, pivoting her stern high into the air while she rapidly slides into the icy water. As dawn approaches, the survivors are seen in the lifeboats, waiting for help to arrive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Clifton Webb]] as Richard Ward Sturges\n*[[Barbara Stanwyck]] as Julia Sturges\n*[[Audrey Dalton]] as Annette Sturges\n*[[William Harper Carter|Harper Carter]] as Norman Sturges\n*[[Robert Wagner]] as Gifford \"Giff\" Rogers\n*[[Thelma Ritter]] as Maude Young\n*[[Brian Aherne]] as Capt.

He said the film would be \"60 percent truth, completely documentary\"<ref name=\"walter\"/> drawing on real-life accounts. A part was written for [[Thelma Ritter]].

She wrote: \"the actual sinking looks like a nautical tragedy on the pond in Central Park\".<ref>[http://www.geocities.ws/paulinekaelreviews/t4.html] \"Pauline Kael reviews on geocities\", retrieved 2013-05-21</ref>\n\nIt is generally considered by historians that ''Titanic'' contains abundant historical inaccuracies. For example, the maiden voyage was not sold out, but actually barely more than half-booked, as shown by [[White Star Line]] records of 1912. Linda Koldau writes: \"''Titanic'' experts rightly emphasize that the scene at [[Cherbourg]] is historical nonsense, since the ''Titanic'' was far from being sold out and an additional passenger would easily have been able to purchase a first-class ticket ...  Yet if one accepts that historical accuracy is not the point here, since the story is not at all that of the ''Titanic'', it is a perfectly functioning script\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Koldau|first1=Linda Maria|title=The Titanic on Film: Myth versus Truth|date=2012|publisher=McFarland}}</ref> Also, ''Carpathia'' had arrived at the scene at around 4:10 A.M., and started picking up the survivors before sunrise.  The rescue took several hours.  In addition, Captain Smith was not awake at the time of the ship's allision with the iceberg, as shown in the film, but was awakened immediately thereafter and summoned to the bridge.  Also, the wireless from the Caronia warning Titanic of an iceberg ahead of it on the steamer track, was never shown by the wireless operator Jack Phillips to the Captain or other officers, but in the film Phillips does show it to Captain Smith and First Officer Charles Lightoller, who then wonders in the film whether that is the same iceberg north of the steamer track previously warned of in a wireless from the Baltic, which Phillips had shown to his superior officers.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nThe film won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]], and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]. The film was also nominated for the [[Directors Guild of America Awards|Directors Guild of America Award]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0046435|title=Titanic}}\n* {{Amg movie|113936|Titanic}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=93430}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=1056130-titanic|title=Titanic}}\n\n{{RMS Titanic}}\n{{Jean Negulesco}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Titanic (1953 Film)}}\n[[Category:1953 films]]\n[[Category:1950s disaster films]]\n[[Category:1950s historical films]]\n[[Category:1953 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American disaster films]]\n[[Category:American historical films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about RMS Titanic]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jean Negulesco]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Charles Brackett]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1912]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Romantic period films]]\n[[Category:Seafaring films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Charles Brackett]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Sol Kaplan]]\n[[Category:1950s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1950s American films]]"}]}}}}
