The film stars [[Vin Diesel]], [[Radha Mitchell]], [[Cole Hauser]], and [[Keith David]]. Dangerous criminal [[Riddick (character)|Richard B. Riddick]] (Diesel) is being transported to prison in a spacecraft, and escapes when the spaceship is damaged by [[comet]] debris and crash lands on an empty [[desert planet]]. When predatory aboriginal creatures begin attacking the survivors, Riddick joins forces with them to escape the planet.\n\n''Pitch Black'' was the final film credit of [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]], which merged with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] during production.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brady |first=Erin |date=2022-08-13 |title=How Universal Saved Vin Diesel's Pitch Black From A Straight-To-Video Fate |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/959264/how-universal-saved-vin-diesels-pitch-black-from-a-straight-to-video-fate/ |access-date=2022-10-22 |website=[[/Film]]}}</ref> It was shot on a modest budget of US$23 million and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised some promising story elements, the visual style, and Diesel's performance, but criticized the lack of exploration of the alien world and recycled human conflicts, citing it as weaker than Twohy's ''[[The Arrival (1996 film)|The Arrival]]''. Despite this, it was a [[sleeper hit]], grossing over $53 million worldwide, and started a [[The Chronicles of Riddick (franchise)|franchise]] centered on the [[antihero]] Riddick. A sequel, ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]'', was released in 2004 by Universal, with Diesel back as the title character and Twohy returning as writer and director. A third film, simply titled ''[[Riddick (film)|Riddick]]'', was released in 2013, with Diesel and Twohy reuniting again.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the distant future, the spaceship ''Hunter-Gratzner'' is transporting passengers in [[suspended animation|cryostasis]]. Among them is Abu \"[[Imam]]\" al-Walid, a [[Muslim]] priest guiding three young pilgrims to New Mecca; a teenager named Jack; a pair of [[Prospecting|prospectors]] named Shazza and Zeke; a rich merchant named Paris; and a law enforcement officer, William J. Johns, who is escorting notorious criminal Richard B. Riddick. Riddick has surgically modified eyes that are highly sensitive to light. [[Micrometeoroids]] rupture the ship's hull, killing the captain and sending the ship off course. The ship's first officer, Owens, and the docking pilot, Carolyn Fry, attempt to land the ship on a nearby planet. As the ship falls apart, Fry decides to dump the passenger section to reduce weight, but Owens stops her. The vessel crashes into the planet's surface, most of the passengers are killed, and Owens is fatally wounded. Riddick escapes into the desert despite Johns' attempts to keep him restrained.\n\nThe survivors explore their surroundings, noticing that the planet's three suns keep it in perpetual daylight. They find an abandoned [[geology|geological research]] settlement, with a water well and a [[dropship (science fiction)|dropship]] that lacks power to fly. Zeke goes missing, and Riddick is suspected; while searching for Zeke, Fry escapes from aggressive [[photosensitive]] creatures after finding his remains in their cave. Johns recaptures Riddick and offers him a deal: if he helps the survivors escape the planet, Johns will allow him to go free. The group takes a power cell to the dropship. One of the young pilgrims is ambushed and eaten while exploring the settlement. An [[orrery]] shows that an eclipse is imminent and the creatures will be free to hunt above ground.  They realize the geologists must have been all killed by the creatures during the last eclipse. Johns informs Fry that Riddick is a capable pilot and could abandon them, and Riddick reveals that Johns is actually a [[bounty hunter]] and [[morphine]] addict who denied Owens the drug in his final moments.\n\nThe group returns to the crash site on a [[solar energy|solar-powered]] sand truck to salvage more power cells for the dropship before the eclipse, but it begins as they get there. Creatures pour out of the ground and devour Shazza and another pilgrim. With his enhanced sight, Riddick agrees to lead the group to the dropship on foot through the darkness. They build a rig from the ship's lighting rods as protection; Paris accidentally destroys the rig and is devoured. Riddick reveals to the group that Jack is female and the scent of her [[menstruation|menstrual blood]] is drawing the attention of the creatures; Johns suggests to Riddick that they use her as bait. Instead, Riddick fights and wounds Johns and leaves him as a distraction. The rest of the group pushes on as Riddick drags the power cells behind him.\n\nAfter Imam's last acolyte is killed and rainfall starts putting out their [[Molotov cocktail|improvised torches]], Riddick hides the others in a cave and goes to start the dropship himself. Inside the cave, the group discovers [[bioluminescent]] worms, which they stuff in bottles to use as light. Fry leaves the cave and finds Riddick powering the ship, ready to leave. She pleads with him to help her rescue the others, but instead he offers to take her with him. Riddick is soon persuaded to return after Fry answers his question that she would die for them, and they retrieve Imam and Jack, but Riddick is separated and wounded by the predators; Fry goes back for him but a creature stabs and carries her off. Riddick makes it to the ship and delays engaging the engines to incinerate as many creatures as possible. In space, Jack asks Riddick what they should tell the authorities about him; he tells her to say that Riddick died on the planet.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Vin Diesel]] as [[Riddick (character)|Richard B.

His initial premise was: \u201c[t]ravelers visit a planet where multiple suns mean perpetual daylight, but when an eclipse brings darkness, ghosts emerge.\u201d These \"ghost\" antagonists survived the first draft,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Every Picture Tells A Story - Screenwriting article by William C.

Multiple locations were used in and around [[Coober Pedy, South Australia]]. Most interior sequences were shot at the [[Village Roadshow Studios]], in [[Oxenford, Queensland]]. In Los Angeles, New Deal Studios were used for miniature photography and the interior sequence of the spaceship crash.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Box office}}\n''Pitch Black'' opened in 1,832 theaters on 18 February 2000, grossing $11,577,688 over its opening weekend and ranking 4th at the box office.
