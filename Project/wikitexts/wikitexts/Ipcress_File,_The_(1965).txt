Furie]] and starring [[Michael Caine]]. The screenplay, by [[Bill Canaway]] and James Doran, was based on [[Len Deighton]]'s novel ''[[The IPCRESS File]]'' (1962). It received a [[BAFTA]] award for the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film|Best British film]] released in 1965. In 1999, it was included at number 59 on the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] list of the [[BFI Top 100 British films|100 best British films]] of the 20th century.\n\nThis film and its sequels were a deliberately downbeat alternative to the hugely successful [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]], even though some of the production team were previously involved with the 007 movies.\n\n==Plot==\nA scientist called Radcliffe is kidnapped from a train and his security escort killed. [[Harry Palmer]], a British Army sergeant with a criminal past, now working for a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] organisation, is summoned by his superior, [[Colonel Ross]], and transferred to a section headed by Major Dalby. Ross suspects that Radcliffe's disappearance is connected to the fact that sixteen other top British scientists have inexplicably left their jobs at the peak of their careers. He threatens Dalby that his group will go if Radcliffe cannot be recovered. Palmer is then introduced as a replacement for the dead security escort.\n\nAfterwards, Dalby briefs his agents that the main suspect is Eric Grantby and his chief of staff, codenamed \"Housemartin\", and tells the team to find out where they are at present. Palmer is also introduced to and befriends Jock Carswell. Using a [[Scotland Yard]] contact, Palmer locates Grantby but, when Palmer tries to stop Grantby getting away, he is attacked by Housemartin.\n\nHousemartin is arrested later but, before he can be questioned, he is killed by men impersonating Palmer and Carswell. Suspecting that Radcliffe is being held in a certain disused factory, Palmer orders a search, but nothing is found except a piece of audiotape marked \"IPCRESS\" that produces meaningless noise when played. Dalby then points out that the paper on which Grantby had written a false phone number is the programme for an upcoming military band concert. There they encounter Grantby and a deal is struck for Radcliffe's return.\n\nThe exchange goes as planned but, as they are leaving, Palmer shoots a man in the shadows who turns out to be a [[CIA]] agent. Subsequently, another CIA operative threatens to kill Palmer if he discovers that the death was not a mistake. Some days later, it becomes clear that while Radcliffe is physically unharmed, his mind has been affected and he can no longer function as a scientist. Carswell has discovered a book titled \"Induction of Psychoneurosis by Conditioned Reflex under Stress\" \u2013 IPCRESS \u2013 which he believes explains what has happened to Radcliffe and the other scientists. Carswell borrows Palmer's car to test his theory on Radcliffe, but is shot before reaching him.\n\nBelieving that he himself must have been the intended target, Palmer goes home to collect his belongings and there discovers the body of the second CIA agent. When he returns to the office, the IPCRESS file is missing from his desk. Ross had previously asked him to [[microfilm]] the file and Palmer now believes that he is being set up. When he informs Dalby what has happened and that he suspects Ross, Dalby tells him to leave town for a while.\n\nOn the train to Paris, Palmer is kidnapped and wakes up imprisoned in a cell in [[Albania]]. After several days without sleep, food and warmth, Grantby reveals himself as his kidnapper. Having previously read the file, Palmer realises that they are preparing to [[brainwash]] him. He uses pain to distract himself, but after many sessions under stress from disorientating images and loud electronic sounds, he succumbs. Grantby then instills a trigger phrase that will make Palmer follow any commands given to him.\n\nPalmer eventually manages to escape and discovers that he is really still in London. He phones Dalby, who is in Grantby's company at the time. Dalby uses the trigger phrase and gets Palmer to call Ross to the warehouse where he had been held. As Dalby and Ross arrive, Palmer holds them both at gunpoint. Dalby accuses Ross of killing Carswell; Ross tells Palmer that he had been suspicious of Dalby and was investigating him.\n\nDalby now uses the trigger phrase again and tells Palmer to \"Shoot the traitor now\". As Palmer wavers, his hand strikes against a piece of equipment and the pain reminds him of his conditioning. Dalby goes for his gun and Palmer shoots him.\nRoss then remarks that, in choosing Palmer for the assignment, he had hoped that Palmer's tendency to insubordination would be useful. When Palmer reproaches Ross for endangering him, he is told that this is what he is paid for.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Michael Caine]] as [[Harry Palmer]]\n*[[Guy Doleman]] as [[Colonel Ross]]\n*[[Nigel Green]] as Major Dalby\n*[[Sue Lloyd]] as Jean Courtney\n*[[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]] as Jock Carswell\n*[[Aubrey Richards]] as Dr. Radcliffe\n*[[Frank Gatliff]] as Eric Grantby (Bluejay)\n*[[Thomas Baptiste]] as Barney\n*[[Oliver MacGreevy]] as Housemartin\n*Freda Bamford as Alice\n*Pauline Winter as Charlady\n*Anthony Blackshaw as Edwards\n*Barry Raymond as Gray\n*[[David Glover (actor)|David Glover]] as Chilcott-Oakes\n*[[Stanley Meadows]] as Inspector Keightley\n*Peter Ashmore as Sir Robert \n*Michael Murray as Raid Inspector\n*Anthony Baird as Raid Sergeant \n*[[Tony Caunter]] as O.N.I. man\n*[[Douglas Blackwell]] as Murray\n*[[Glynn Edwards]] as Police Station Sergeant\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDeighton was hired to write a screenplay for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'', but later was let go because of a lack of progress.

Sangster enjoyed the book and was eager to adapt the novel, suggesting Michael Caine to play the main role and Sidney J. Furie as director.

There it is only in Chapter 5 that Palmer remarks, \"My name isn't Harry, but in this business it's hard to remember whether it ever had been\". But from the opening scenes of the film, Sangster's screenplay identifies Caine's character clearly as someone who cares little for authority, who indulges in quick repartee and has an interest in good food. Newspaper cuttings shown in Palmer's kitchen are actually cookery articles written for ''[[The Observer]]'' by Deighton, who was an accomplished cook himself.<ref>{{cite book|title=Action Cook Book|publisher=[[Harper Perennial]]|year=2009|edition=Reissue|isbn=9780007305872|last=Deighton|first=Len|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Len Deighton's Cookstrip Cook Book|first=Len|last=Deighton|year=1965|publisher=B.

The film was shot [[location shooting|on location]] around London in the widescreen screen ratio using [[Techniscope]]. In this format, the normal 35mm film frame is split in half, each now taking up only two perforations on the edges of the film stock rather than usual four. The format was introduced by Technicolor Italia in 1963 and allowed for a greater [[depth of field]] as it was shot with shorter focal length lenses than used in the [[anamorphic]] widescreen processes. This allowed cinematographer [[Otto Heller]] to construct images in deep focus, shooting behind objects and allowing both the objects in the foreground and the action taking place in the background to be in focus.<ref name=\"The Ipcress File Blu-ray review\">{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Paul|title=The Ipcress File Blu-ray review|url=http://www.dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3329|website=Rewind|publisher=DVDCompare|access-date=1 August 2014|date=1 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sound===\n[[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], who had worked on all of the Bond films up to this time, composed the music score for the soundtrack.
