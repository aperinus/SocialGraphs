The film is generally considered to be one of Bresson's greatest films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/robert-bresson-69087|title=Robert Bresson|last=Semley|first=John|work=The A.V.

He leaves the track confident he was not noticed, but is suddenly arrested. At the police station, the chief inspector releases him because it cannot be proven that he stole the money.\n\nThe next day, Michel goes to visit his sickly mother, who he has not seen in a month. Her neighbor, Jeanne, offers to let him in the apartment, but, instead, he gives her money to give his mother and leaves. Michel goes to meet his friend Jacques at a bar and asks for help finding a job. He sees the chief inspector and they wind up discussing Michel's theory that certain [[\u00dcbermensch|superior men]] should not be bound by the same laws as everyone else.\n\nIn the subway, Michel notices a pickpocket. He practices the technique he observed and employs it successfully. Later, he tells Jacques that he is no longer looking for a job.\n\nAfter spending a week in the subway picking pockets, Michel is caught, so he lays low for a few days. He notices a mysterious man lurking outside, but is interrupted when Jacques shows up with Jeanne, who tells Michel that his mother is ill. Michel sends Jacques to see his mother in his place and goes out to find the mysterious man. The man turns out to be a pickpocket, and he teaches Michel several new techniques.\n\nWhen she is on her deathbed, Michel finally goes to see his mother. She says she is not worried about him and he says he is sure she will get better, but she dies soon after. Michel and the mysterious man begin to work together, and they eventually bring in a third man.\n\nOn a Sunday, Michel goes to a carnival with Jacques and Jeanne. While they are on a ride, he wanders off. Jacques finds him at his apartment cleaning himself up, having fallen during his escape from a man whose watch he stole. Michel asks if Jacques and Jeanne love each other, and Jacques leaves.\n\nMichel and his two accomplices undertake coordinated pickpocketing sprees at crowded locations, and one day he gets to [[Gare de Lyon]] station and sees his accomplices being lead away in handcuffs. He goes home, and the chief inspector comes by to tell him that, a month before he was arrested at the racetrack, Jeanne reported some money had been stolen from Michel's mother, but the complaint was withdrawn the next day. Deeming it unlikely Michel will turn his life around, the inspector indicates he is going to start watching Michel more closely.\n\nJeanne tells Michel that the police recently asked her to confirm his mother is the one who withdrew her complaint, which shows Michel that his mother knew he robbed her. Jeanne has still not figured this out, but he catches her up. Although she is appalled, she tearfully hugs him before he leaves and asks if he is going to run away before the inspector catches him, giving him the idea to do just that.\n\nMichel spends two years in London \"pulling off good jobs\", but he blows all of his money gambling and on women and returns to Paris. He goes to see Jeanne and discovers she and Jacques had a child, who she is raising alone because she did not want to marry him. Michel offers to help her support the child by getting an honest job, and he follows through. He is feeling good, but is drawn to a man reading the racing form and finds himself accompanying the man to Longchamp. Although suspicious when the man seems to win a bet he should have lost, Michel still tries to steal the money and is arrested, as the man is a [[plainclothes officer]].\n\nAt first, Michel is mostly just upset he was caught. He cannot understand why Jeanne visits him in jail, but, after she does not come for three weeks, he finds his hands shaking as he reads a letter explaining that her child has been sick. When he sees her again, she seems lit up, and he realizes he loves her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin LaSalle]] as Michel\n* [[Marika Green]] as Jeanne\n* [[Jean P\u00e9l\u00e9gri]] as the Chief Inspector\n* Dolly Scal as the Mother\n* Pierre Leymarie as Jacques\n* Henri Kassagi as 1st Accomplice\n* [[Pierre \u00c9taix]] as 2nd Accomplice\n* C\u00e9sar Gattegno as an Inspector\n\n==Production==\nBresson said ''Pickpocket'' \"was written in three months and shot in the midst of crowds in a minimal amount of time.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOuKCMq6Ir8C&pg=PA203|title=The Films of Robert Bresson|page=203|editor-last=Cardullo|editor-first=Bert|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1843318255}}</ref> The resulting disorder proved to be a challenge during shooting, but was sometimes used to the crew's advantage, as in the [[Paris-Gare de Lyon|Gare de Lyon]] pickpocketing sequence.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0MdDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA71|title=Bresson on Bresson: Interviews, 1943-1983|publisher=New York Review of Books|year=2016|isbn=978-1681370446}}</ref>\n\nAt one point in the film, Jacques reads and asks to borrow Michel's copy of [[Richard S. Lambert]]'s ''The Prince of Pickpockets: A Study of [[George Barrington]]''.\n\n==Style==\nThe film has been called an example of \"parametric narration\",<ref>Robert Stam, Robert Burgoyne, & Sandy Flitterman-Lewis, ''New Vocabularies in Film Semiotics: structuralism, post-structuralism, and beyond''.

The reasoning is immoral, but the characters claim special privileges above and beyond common morality. Michel, like the hero of ''Crime and Punishment'', has a 'good woman' in his life, who trusts he will be able to redeem himself. ... She comes to Michel with the news that his mother is dying. Michel does not want to see his mother, but gives Jeanne money for her. Why does he avoid her? Bresson never supplies motives.
