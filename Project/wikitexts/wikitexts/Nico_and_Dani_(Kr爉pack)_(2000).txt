The Spanish title refers to a form of mutual masturbation that the two practice.\n\nFilming took place in the Catalan town of [[Castelldefels]] and in various locations in the county of [[Garraf]]. The DVD offers short features on the making of the film, theater trailer, interviews with the actors and director, and two music videos made from the film. The film is unrated.\n\n== Plot ==\nNico and Dani are 17-year-old friends spending the summer together at Dani's parent's beach house, while his parents are traveling. They aim to meet girls and lose their virginity, and in the meantime they practice [[mutual masturbation]] and other sexual practices. They meet a pair of cousins, Berta and Elena. Nico is much more interested in Elena than Dani is in Berta. Nico has sex with Elena, making Dani jealous of her.\n\nDani realizes he is in love with Nico and tells him this, causing an argument. Dani then goes out to get drunk and meets a gay writer friend of his father. After having dinner and sailing with him, Dani proposes that the two have sex, but runs away and returns home to Nico. The friends reconcile by the end of the summer.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0250478|title=Nico and Dani}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nico And Dani}}\n[[Category:Films shot in Barcelona]]\n[[Category:2000s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Spanish LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Cesc Gay]]\n[[Category:2000 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:2000s Spanish films]]\n\n\n{{2000s-comedy-film-stub}}\n{{2000s-Spain-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
