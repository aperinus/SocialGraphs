Set in [[Vienna]] in 1957, the film centers on the [[sadomasochistic]] relationship between a former [[concentration camp|Nazi concentration camp]] officer (Bogarde) and one of his inmates (Rampling).\n\nThe film's themes of sexual and [[sadomasochistic]] obsession, and its use of [[Holocaust]] imagery, have made the film controversial since its initial release, dividing critics over its [[art film|artistic value]], but developing it a strong [[cult following]].<ref name=\"Amazon\">Staff (ndg) [https://www.amazon.com/The-Night-Porter-Dirk-Bogarde/dp/0780020405 \"The Night Porter\"] [[Amazon.com]]</ref><ref>Wolff, Zoe (September 2, 2014) [http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/charlotte-rampling/ \"Charlotte Rampling\"] ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''</ref><ref>Staff (ndg) [http://www.americancinemathequecalendar.com/content/the-night-porter \"The Night Porter\"] ''American Cinematheque''</ref> In July 2018, it was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section at the [[75th Venice International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/news/restored-films-venezia-classici |title=Biennale Cinema 2018, Venice Classics |work=labiennale.org |date=13 July 2018 |accessdate=22 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring [[World War II]], Maximilian Theo Aldorfer, a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer who had posed as a doctor to take sensational photographs in [[concentration camp]]s, and Lucia, a teenage girl interned in a concentration camp due to her father's [[Socialism|Socialist]] political ties, had an ambiguous [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] relationship. Max tormented Lucia, but also acted as her protector.\n\nIn 1957, Lucia, now married to an American orchestra conductor, meets Max again by chance. He is now a night porter at a hotel in Vienna, and a reluctant member of a group of former SS comrades who have been carefully covering up their pasts by destroying documents and eliminating witnesses to their wartime activities. Max has an upcoming [[mock trial]] at the hands of the group for his [[war crimes]]. The group's leader, Hans Fogler, accuses Max of wanting to live 'hidden away like a church mouse'. Max wishes to remain hidden, but he voices support for the group's activities. Memories of the past punctuate Max and Lucia's present  with urgent frequency, suggesting that Lucia survived through her relationship with Max \u2013 in one such scene, Lucia sings a [[Marlene Dietrich]] song, \"Wenn ich mir was w\u00fcnschen d\u00fcrfte\" (\"If I could make a wish\"), to the camp guards while wearing pieces of an SS uniform, and Max \"rewards\" her with the severed head of a male inmate who had been bullying her, a reference to [[Salome]].\n\nBecause she could testify against him, Lucia's existence is a threat to Max. He goes to see a former Nazi collaborator, Mario, who knows Lucia is still alive; Max murders him to protect his secret. After Lucia's husband leaves town on business, Max and Lucia renew their past lovemaking in Max's apartment. Max confesses to Countess Stein, another guest at his hotel, that he has found his \"little girl\" again. The Countess tells him that he is insane; Max replies that they are both 'in the same boat'. Meanwhile, Fogler has Max spied on by a youth who works at the hotel.\n\nMax is interviewed by the police about Mario's murder. He spends days with Lucia in his apartment, chaining her to the wall so that \"they can't take her away\", and sleeps little. Fogler, who wants Lucia to testify against Max in the mock trial\u2014though he harbors more ambiguous long-term intentions toward her\u2014visits and informs her that Max is ill. He suggests that Lucia must also be ill to allow herself to be in this position, but she sends him away, claiming to be with Max of her own free will.\n\nThe SS officers are infuriated at Max for hiding a key witness. Max refuses to go through with the trial, calling it 'a farce', and admits that he works as a night porter due to his sense of shame in daytime. He returns to Lucia, telling her that the police questioned him and others at the hotel about her disappearance, and that no suspicion fell on him. Eventually, Max quits his job, devoting all of his time to Lucia. The SS officers cut off the couple's supply of food from a nearby grocery store. Max barricades the door to the apartment, and he and Lucia begin rationing.\n\nMax seeks help by phoning one of his old hotel friends, who refuses, and imploring his neighbor, but she is prevented from providing aid by Adolph, the youth who had spied on Max earlier. Max retreats again to the apartment, where Lucia is almost unconscious from malnutrition. After one of the SS cuts off the electricity in Max's apartment, Max and Lucia, respectively dressed in his Nazi uniform and a negligee resembling the one she had worn in the concentration camp, leave the building and drive away; they are soon followed by a car driven by Max's former colleagues. Max parks his car on a bridge, where he and Lucia walk along the sidewalk as dawn breaks. Two gunshots ring out, and the lovers fall dead.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dirk Bogarde]] as Maximilian Theo Aldorfer\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Lucia\n* [[Philippe Leroy (actor)|Philippe Leroy]] as Klaus\n* [[Gabriele Ferzetti]] as Hans Fogler\n* [[Giuseppe Addobbati]] as Stumm\n* [[Isa Miranda]] as Countess Stein\n* Nino Bignamini as Adolph\n* [[Marino Mas\u00e9]] as Atherton \n* [[Amedeo Amodio]] as Bert\n* [[Piero Vida]] as Day Porter\n* [[Geoffrey Copleston]] as Kurt\n* Manfred Freyberger as Dobson\n* Ugo Cardea as Mario\n* Hilda Gunther as Greta\n* [[Nora Ricci]] as Neighbour\n* Piero Mazzinghi as Concierge\n* Kai-Siegfried Seefeld as Jacob\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nFilming took place in [[Vienna, Austria]] and at [[Cinecitt\u00e0|Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios]] in [[Rome]]. Locations included the [[Vienna Volksoper]], the [[Linke Wienzeile Buildings]], the [[Mozarthaus Vienna|Mozarthaus]], the [[Vienna Central Cemetery]], [[Karl-Marx-Hof]], and [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]]. The concentration camp scenes were shot in the [[Tuscolano]] district of Rome. The film's costumes were designed by five-time [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Oscar]]-nominee [[Piero Tosi]].\n\nThe budget, which had been paid for by the Italian distributor, ran out near the end of the shooting of the film's interiors at Cinecitt\u00e0. To ensure the film's completion, producer Robert Gordon Edwards instructed editor [[Franco Arcalli]] to create a rough cut of the best scenes that had been shot, which he presented to an American colleague who worked at Les Artistes Associ\u00e9s (the French arm of [[United Artists]]). On the basis of the rough cut, the company agreed to pay for the filming of the exterior scenes in Vienna in exchange for French distribution rights.\n\n[[Romy Schneider]] turned down the role of Lucia. [[Mia Farrow]] was considered, as well as [[Dominique Sanda]], before [[Charlotte Rampling]] was cast. Rampling shot the film only four months after giving birth to her son Barnaby. She and [[Dirk Bogarde]] re-wrote and ad-libbed much of their dialogue. Bogarde also enlisted [[Anthony Forwood]] to help rewrite the script, uncredited. Bogarde seriously considered retiring from acting after the end of principal photography, which he considered a very draining experience.\n\nSeveral of the actors' voices were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]], including Phillippe Leroy (by [[Edmund Purdom]]), [[Gabriele Ferzetti]] (by [[David de Keyser]]), and [[Geoffrey Copleston]] (by [[Charles Howerton]]). Ironically, Copleston himself was an accomplished [[voice actor]] and dub artist.\n\n== Reception ==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating 68% based on 31 reviews, with the site's critical consensus reading, \"''The Night Porter'''s salaciousness gives its exploration of historical trauma a bitter aftertaste, but audiences seeking provocation are unlikely to forget the sting of this erotic drama.\" In response to ''The Night Porter'', Cavani was both celebrated for her courage in dealing with the theme of sexual transgression and, simultaneously, castigated for the controversial manner in which she presented that transgression within the context of a Nazi Holocaust narrative.\n\nCritic [[Roger Ebert]] of ''The Chicago Sun-Times'' thought the main roles were well-performed, but nonetheless gave the film 1 star out of a possible 4, and called ''The Night Porter'' \"as nasty as it is lubricious, a despicable attempt to titillate us by exploiting memories of persecution and suffering\",<ref name=ebert>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750210/REVIEWS/502100301/1023|title=The Night Porter|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=February 10, 1975|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=2008-12-23|archive-date=2012-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928084352/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19750210%2FREVIEWS%2F502100301%2F1023|url-status=dead}}</ref> while adding  he did not \"object per se to the movie's subject matter.\" [[Leonard Maltin]]'s 2015 ''Movie Guide'' called it a \"Sleazy, bizarre drama\", awarding it two out of four stars.<ref>Leonard Maltin, editor.
