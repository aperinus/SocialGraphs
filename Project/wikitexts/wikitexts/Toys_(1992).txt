Released in December 1992 in the United States, and March and April 1993 in the United Kingdom and Australia, respectively, the film was produced by Levinson's [[production company]] Baltimore Pictures and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. Despite appearing somewhat juvenile at first glance, the movie garnered a PG-13 rating from the [[Motion Picture Association|MPAA]] for some language and sensuality.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=Robin|title=Toys|date=1992-12-18|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105629/|last2=Gambon|last3=Cusack|last4=Wright|first2=Michael|first3=Joan|first4=Robin|access-date=2017-05-08}}</ref>\n\nThe film was a [[Box-Office Bomb|box-office failure]] at the time of its release, despite its cast and filmmaking.

He surprises his assistant, Owen Owens, by announcing that instead of his son Leslie succeeding him, his younger brother, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] Leland Zevo, will do so. Even Leland, whose relationship with Kenneth is strained, is surprised, noting how Leslie has been apprenticed at the toy factory most of his life. Kenneth agrees Leslie loves toys and his work, but his childlike demeanor would jeopardize the company. Kenneth had even hired Gwen Tyler to work in the factory, hoping she and Leslie would start a relationship to help Leslie mature. Leland reluctantly takes control after Kenneth's death, and since Leslie and his sister Alsatia know about toymaking, he first decides to effectively give them control of the factory. However, Leland's interest is piqued upon hearing about corporate secrets potentially being leaked, and he hires his son, Patrick, a soldier with covert military expertise, to manage security. From Patrick, Leland is inspired to build war toys, even though Leslie explains that Zevo Toys has never made war toys due to Kenneth's overall dislike of war, which caused the strained relationship with his brother. Meanwhile, Leslie finally notices Gwen, and they start dating.\n\nOne night, Leland and Patrick go into town, where they peruse a video arcade, watching children play intently at the flickering game consoles. Going to a local toy store, Leland is amazed at what other companies have produced regarding war toys. As they drive back to the countryside, Leland and Patrick stop at a small pond, and Leland soon realizes that if military aircraft and hardware could be shrunken down and operated by remote control, military spending could become less cumbersome.\n\nLeland offers to drop the idea of Zevo Toys making war toys, but asks Leslie if he can partition off a small amount of the factory to develop toys of his own. He asks Leslie to avoid the area, fearing that his toys may not be good enough. Unknown to Leslie, Leland is using the space to develop miniature remotely controlled war machines, aspiring to sell these to the military. However, military leaders refuse to buy into his plan, and Leland, becoming unhinged by their refusal, moves ahead with his plan independently. He increasingly takes over the factory's space and increases security, shrinking other departments and shutting down Alsatia's, effectively laying off numerous workers. When Leslie sees children being led into a restricted area, he sneaks in and discovers Leland training children to operate the miniature war machines with arcade-like interfaces. Leslie barely escapes the \"Sea Swine\" amphibious drone guarding an exit, and flees to Gwen's house to reveal his findings. Unbeknownst to him, Leland, aware of Leslie's discovery, prepares to defend his parts of the factory, promoting himself to general of his own army. Patrick learns Leland lied about his mother's death and quits to warn Leslie.\n\nLeslie, Alsatia, Patrick, Gwen, and Owen infiltrate the factory and then disperse to locate the main control center. Leland takes the opportunity to unleash some cute-yet-deadly toys, before setting his military-style \"Tommy Tanks\" and \"Hurly-Burly Helicopters\" on them. Leslie, Alsatia, Gwen and Owen end up finding their way into a storage warehouse, where he had the older Zevo Toys stored. Devising a plan, Leslie winds up the old toys and puts them to battle against Leland's war machines. He then manages to get to Leland, and during a fight, Leland's helicopter attempts to hit Leslie with a missile but misses and hits Leland's control panel, which shuts down all the military toys. As Leslie and Patrick confront Leland, Alsatia is attacked by the Sea Swine and is revealed to be a [[Gynoid|robot]], built by Kenneth as a companion for Leslie after the death of his mother. As Leslie and Patrick tend to Alsatia, Leland tries to escape, but the Sea Swine attacks him. As Leland is hospitalized, Leslie takes over the factory and continues his relationship with Gwen, and Alsatia is fully repaired. Owen continues to work at Zevo, and Patrick prepares to depart for other missions, but remains with the others long enough to attend a brief memorial to Kenneth.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Leslie Zevo\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Lieutenant General Leland Zevo\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Old General Zevo\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Alsatia Zevo\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Gwen Tyler\n* [[LL Cool J]] as Captain Patrick Zevo\n* [[Donald O'Connor]] as Kenneth Zevo\n* [[Arthur Malet]] as Owen Owens\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Baker\n* [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]] as Cortez\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Hogenstern\n* [[Yeardley Smith]] as Researcher Miss Drum\n* [[Wendy Melvoin]] as Choir Soloist\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Nurse Debbie\n\n==Production==\nItalian designer [[Ferdinando Scarfiotti]] spent over one year designing the film's sets, which took over every sound stage at [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] Studios in Los Angeles. The influence of [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]]'s art is obvious in the set design and in some of the costume design. The poster distributed to movie theaters featuring Williams in a red bowler hat against a blue, cloud-lined background evokes ''[[The Son of Man]].'' ''[[Golconda (painting)|Golconda]]'' is featured during a sequence where Williams and Cusack's characters perform in a  music video sequence rife with [[Surrealism|surreal imagery]], much of it Magritte-inspired. The film's design was also influenced by  [[Dada]]ism, [[Modernism]]  and  [[Futurism#Italian Futurism|Italian Futurism]]\u2014notably the work of [[Fortunato Depero]].\n\nThe film has often been noted for many of its outdoor scenes, which feature the [[Palouse]] region. All of the outdoor scenes, including the trailer, were filmed on location in southeastern [[Washington (state)|Washington]] near [[Rosalia, Washington|Rosalia]], and north-central [[Idaho]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Performer\n| total_length = 47:14\n| title1 = Winter Reveries\n| note1 = Excerpt from Tchaikovsky's [[Symphony No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 1]]\n| writer1 = [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], arranged by Trevor Horn\n| extra1 = Shirley Walker Orchestra \n| length1 = 2:03\n| title2 = The Closing of the Year\n| note2 = Main Theme\n| writer2 = [[Trevor Horn]], [[Hans Zimmer]]\n| extra2 = The Musical Cast of ''Toys'' featuring [[Wendy & Lisa]]\n| length2 = 3:28\n| title3 = Ebud\u00e6\n| writer3 = [[Enya]], [[Roma Ryan]]\n| extra3 = [[Enya]]\n| length3 = 1:49\n| title4 = The Happy Worker\n| writer4 = Horn, [[Bruce Woolley]]\n| extra4 = [[Tori Amos]]\n| length4 = 4:19\n| title5 = Alsatia's Lullaby\n| writer5 = Zimmer\n| extra5 = [[Julia Migenes]] and Hans Zimmer \n| length5 = 4:16\n| title6 = Workers\n| writer6 = Horn, Woolley\n| extra6 = The Musical Cast of ''Toys'' featuring [[Tori Amos]]\n| length6 = 1:11\n| title7 = Let Joy and Innocence Prevail \n| note7 = Instrumental\n| writer7 = Horn, Zimmer\n| extra7 = [[Pat Metheny]]\n| length7 = 4:59\n| title8 = The General\n| writer8 = Zimmer\n| extra8 = [[Michael Gambon]] and Hans Zimmer\n| length8 = 2:21\n| title9 = The Mirror Song\n| writer9 = Horn, Woolley, [[Thomas Dolby|Dolby]]\n| extra9 = [[Thomas Dolby]] with [[Robin Williams]] and [[Joan Cusack]]\n| length9 = 4:35\n| title10 = Battle Introduction\n| writer10 = Zimmer\n| extra10 = Robin Williams\n| length10 = 2:45\n| title11 = [[Welcome to the Pleasuredome (song)|Welcome to the Pleasuredome]]\n| note11 = Into Battle Mix\n| writer11 = [[Peter Gill (FGTH drummer)|Peter Gill]], [[Holly Johnson]], [[Brian Nash]], [[Mark O'Toole (musician)|Mark O'Toole]]\n| extra11 = [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]\n| length11 = 4:59\n| title12 = Let Joy and Innocence Prevail\n| writer12 = Horn, Zimmer\n| extra12 = [[Grace Jones]]\n| length12 = 5:01\n| title13 = The Closing of the Year / Happy Workers\n| note13 = Reprise\n| writer13 = Horn, Woolley, Zimmer\n| extra13 = The Musical Cast of ''Toys'' (including Wendy & Lisa and [[Seal (musician)|Seal]]) (\"Happy Workers\" reprise: [[Jane Siberry]])\n| length13 = 5:28\n}}\nThe \"Into Battle\" mix of \"Welcome To The Pleasuredome\" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood was created for the movie by the song's original producer Trevor Horn and is exclusive to the Toys Soundtrack album.\n\n==Video game==\nA [[video game]] based on the film, ''[[Toys (video game)|Toys: Let the Toy Wars Begin!]]'', was released in 1993 for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] platforms by [[Absolute Entertainment]].<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/snes/action/toys/index.html?tag=result;title;1 Toys on GameSpot]</ref> The game is played from an isometric perspective, and involves the player, as Leslie Zevo, attempting to destroy the elephant-head security cameras in the factory, cafeteria, and warehouse levels in order to shut down those defenses.
