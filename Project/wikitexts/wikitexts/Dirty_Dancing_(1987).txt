She finished the script in 1985, but management changes at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] put the film in [[development hell]].

Exploring one night, Baby secretly observes Max instructing the waiters, all [[Ivy League]] students, to romance the guests' daughters, no matter how unattractive. Max also demeans the [[working class]] entertainment staff, including  Johnny Castle, one of the dance instructors. Baby is attracted to Johnny, and dances briefly with him after his kind-hearted cousin, Billy, introduces them at a secret \"dirty dancing\" party for resort staff. Max's grandson Neil flirts with Baby in the meantime.\n\nBaby learns Johnny's dance partner Penny is pregnant by Robbie, a waiter and womanizer who attends [[Yale School of Medicine]] and now has his eye on Lisa. When Robbie refuses to help Penny, Baby, without explaining why, borrows money from her father to pay for Penny's [[abortion]]. At first, Penny declines as it would cause her and Johnny to miss a performance at a nearby resort, costing them the season's salary, but Baby volunteers to stand in for Penny. During her dance sessions with Johnny, they develop a mutual attraction, and despite their failure to execute a climactic lift, Johnny and Baby's performance is successful.\n\nBack at Kellerman's, Penny is gravely injured by the botched abortion, and Baby enlists her father's help to stabilize Penny. Angered by Baby's deception, and assuming Johnny got Penny pregnant, Dr. Houseman orders Baby to stay away from them. Baby sneaks off to apologize to Johnny for her dad's treatment, but Johnny feels he deserves it due to his lower status; Baby reassures him of his worth, declaring her love. They begin secretly seeing each other, and her father refuses to talk to her.\n\n[[File:Dirty-dancing-coverx-large.jpg|right|thumb|Scene from the dancing finale<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|author=Vernon, Polly|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1868781,00.html|title=Hey Baby&nbsp;\u2013 we're all Swayze now|date=October 10, 2006|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=May 15, 2007|location=London|archive-date=February 22, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222120155/http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1868781,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=bbc/>]]\n\nJohnny rejects an indecent proposal by Vivian Pressman, an adulterous wife, who instead sleeps with Robbie, inadvertently foiling Lisa's plan to lose her virginity to him. When Vivian spots Baby leaving Johnny's cabin, she feels spurned and attempts revenge on Johnny by claiming he stole her husband's wallet. Max is ready to fire Johnny, but Baby backs up his alibi, revealing she was with Johnny the night of the theft. The real thieves, Sydney and Sylvia Schumacher are caught, but Johnny is still fired for mixing with Baby. Before leaving, Johnny tries to talk to Dr. Houseman but is only accused of trying to get at Baby. Baby later apologizes to her father for lying, but not for her romance with Johnny, and then accuses him of classism.\n\nAt the end-of-season talent show, Dr. Houseman gives Robbie a recommendation letter for medical school, but when Robbie admits that he got Penny pregnant, and then insults her and Baby, Dr. Houseman angrily grabs the letter back. Johnny arrives and disrupts the final song by bringing Baby up on stage and declaring that she has made him a better person, and then they perform the dance they practiced all summer, ending with a successful climactic lift. Dr. Houseman admits he was wrong about Johnny and reconciles with Baby, and all the staff and guests join Baby and Johnny dancing to \"[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Jennifer Grey]] as Frances \"Baby\" Houseman\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Johnny Castle\n* [[Max Cantor]] as Robbie Gould\n* [[Charles Coles]] as Tito Suarez\n* [[Neal Jones]] as Billy Kostecki\n* [[Cynthia Rhodes]] as Penny Johnson\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Max Kellerman\n* [[Lonny Price]] as Neil Kellerman\n* [[Jerry Orbach]] as Jack Houseman\n* [[Jane Brucker]] as Lisa Houseman\n* [[Kelly Bishop]] as Marjorie Houseman\n* [[Miranda Garrison]] as Vivian Pressman\n* [[Garry Goodrow]] as Moe Pressman\n* [[Paula Trueman]] as Sylvia Schumacher\n* Alvin Myerovich as Sydney Schumacher\n* [[Wayne Knight]] as Stan\n}}\n[[Bruce Morrow]] appears in a cameo as a magician; Morrow himself could be heard as a DJ's voice in different parts of the film.

Johnny Castle's line, \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\", has been used in song lyrics, as the title of the \"[[Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner]]\" episode of the TV series ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', and as the title of a [[Fall Out Boy]] song. \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\" was also quoted in ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'': when [[Dean Winchester|Dean]] says the line concerning his beloved Impala and his brother [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] retorts that the line is from a Swayze movie; Dean responds: \"Swayze always gets a pass\". The line was parodied in the webcomic ''[[Looking for Group]]'' where Richard, one of the primary characters, uttered a variation involving his own name, and in ''[[Family Guy]]'', where the scene is parodied by Baby's parents questioning Johnny due to her youth. In Sweden, feminist art group Sisters of Jam put the text \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\" (in English) in white neon light at [[Ume\u00e5]] Bus Square (2008) and at [[Karlstad University]] (2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sistersofjam.com/category/nobody-puts-baby-in-a-corner/|title=Nobody Puts Baby In a Corner|access-date=October 24, 2014|archive-date=October 24, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024155414/http://sistersofjam.com/category/nobody-puts-baby-in-a-corner/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''[[Family Guy]]'' also parodies the scene where Baby first sees Johnny dancing with the staff. In the TV series ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', [[Barney Stinson]] attempts to pass off the ''Dirty Dancing'' story as the story of his own loss of virginity because he is ashamed of his actual story; the original \"Love is Strange\" scene is shown with Barney replacing Johnny.\n\nThe famous lift scene is also widely referenced in popular culture. In the 2011 film ''[[Crazy, Stupid, Love]]'' Ryan Gosling's character is able to perform the \u201cmove from ''Dirty Dancing''\u201d and does it with Emma Stone's character.  In 2015, UnitedHealthcare released a commercial with a couple dancing and attempting to perform the \"lift\" scene.<ref>{{Citation |title=UnitedHealthcare TV Spot, 'Our Song' |url=https://www.ispot.tv/ad/7egY/unitedhealthcare-our-song |language=en |access-date=2022-06-19}}</ref>  In the soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'' the famous lift dance sequence was rehearsed for the 2018 wedding of Steve McDonald and Tracy Barlow and was also performed to \"[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life|The Time of My Life]]\" as in the film.\n\nThe French film ''[[Heartbreaker (2010 film)|Heartbreaker]]'' (2010) pays homage to the film, as a plot detail, with some clips from the film shown and a \"recreation\" by the two main characters of the \"lift\" scene.\n\nIn the first episode of the TV series ''[[New Girl]]'', the female lead Jess watches the film repeatedly after her break up.
