Along with her parents and brother, who are unaware that they are dead, she is stuck on the same day they were murdered in 1985. As she becomes more aware of her circumstances, she realizes that she can make contact with people in other timelines. As she explores this ability, a pale man appears and warns her to stop. Undeterred, Lisa uses personal items from other people killed in the house to make a connection with Olivia, part of a family living in the house in the future who will become the next set of victims.\n\nWith the help of Olivia and the spirits of other murdered girls, Lisa is transported into the timelines of other victims and unravels the mystery of the house, realizing that the previous resident of the house, Edgar Mullins, is possessing the fathers of the families who live in the house to continue his serial murders. She helps her family to come to terms with the knowledge that they are dead, and thus \"awakened\", they become able to assist her. After her family escapes to the afterlife, Lisa stays behind to stop Mullins. She is nearly trapped in Olivia's body as Mullins moves on to kill them, but Lisa is able to escape him long enough to summon the spirits of Mullins' past victims, delaying his next kill long enough for the spirits of his other victims to join her. As Mullins is \"incinerated\" in the furnace where he killed his own victims, Olivia's father retakes control of his body, confused about what just happened. After assuring him and Olivia that they will be a happy family again, Lisa goes to sleep, but awakens with her family on her birthday in [[heaven]], out of the loop that Mullins trapped them in.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Abigail Breslin]] as Lisa Johnson\n* [[Peter Outerbridge]] as Bruce Johnson\n* [[Michelle Nolden]] as Carol Johnson\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as Pale Man - Edgar Mullins\n** David Knoll as Young Edgar\n* [[Peter DaCunha]] as Robert \"Robbie\" Johnson\n* [[Samantha Weinstein]] as Frances Nichols\n* Eleanor Zichy as Olivia\n* [[David Hewlett]] as David - Olivia's Father\n* [[Sarah Manninen]] as Olivia's Mother\n* Martine Campbell as Olivia's Sister\n* Michelle Coburn as Mary Brooks\n* Tadhg McMahon as Edgar's Father\n* Marie Dame as Edgar's Mother\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's score was composed by Alex Khaskin.\n\n''[[PopMatters]]'' described the soundtrack as \"A fable-like soundtrack, included in both diegetic and non-diegetic sound, which is composed around famous sections from Peter and the Wolf.<ref>{{cite web|work=PopMatters|title='Haunter' Delivers for Ghost Story Inversion|author=Verona, Emily Ruth|date=27 February 2014|url=https://www.popmatters.com/179508-haunter-2495683139.html}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nHaunter was filmed at [[Toronto]] and [[Brantford]], [[Ontario]], Canada.<ref name=star>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2013/12/19/canadian_horror_haunter_stars_abigail_breslin.html|title=Canadian horror Haunter stars Abigail Breslin: review|last=Barnard|first=Lisa|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref>  Production took 25 days.<ref name=premiere/> Natali said that he was drawn to the film because, unlike ''[[Splice (film)|Splice]]'', which took him twelve years to complete, ''Haunter'' only needed to be shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/731980-exclusive-vincenzo-natali-on-his-reverse-ghost-story-haunter|title=Exclusive: Vincenzo Natali On His 'Reverse Ghost Story' Haunter|last=Cairns|first=Brian|date=March 4, 2013|work=ComingSoon.net|url-status=live|accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Haunter'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] film festival on March 9, 2013,<ref name=premiere/> and received a limited US theatrical release on October 18, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3245525/exclusive-haunter-poster-is-like-trapping-lightning-in-a-bottle/|title=Exclusive 'Haunter' Poster Is Like Trapping Lightning In A Bottle!|last=Miska|first=Brad|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref> It was released on home video on February 11, 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/73488/haunter-going-bump-night-dvd-and-blu-ray|title=Haunter Going Bump in the Night on DVD and Blu-ray|last=Barton|first=Steve|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=January 23, 2014|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref> and made $129,447 on domestic video sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Haunter#tab=summary|title=Haunter (2013)|work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|url-status=live|accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 54% of 35 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.37/10.
