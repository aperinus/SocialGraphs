The film is written and directed by [[Rob Epstein]] and [[Jeffrey Friedman (filmmaker)|Jeffrey Friedman]] and stars [[James Franco]] as Ginsberg.\n\n==Plot==\n''Howl'' explores the life and works of 20th-century American poet, [[Allen Ginsberg]]. Constructed in a [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinear]] fashion, the film juxtaposes historical events with a variety of [[cinematic techniques]]. It reconstructs  the [[Beat poets#History|early life of Ginsberg during the 1940s and 1950s]]. It also re-enacts Ginsberg's debut performance of \"[[Howl (poem)|Howl]]\" at the [[Six Gallery reading|Six Gallery Reading]] on October 7, 1955 in black-and-white.<ref>[http://www.tuftsdaily.com/arts/howl-filmmakers-talk-youth-culture-james-franco-1.2341729 \u2018Howl\u2019 filmmakers talk youth culture, James Franco]</ref> The reading was the first important public manifestation of the [[Beat Generation]] and helped to herald the West Coast literary revolution that became known as the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].<ref>The readings by the other four Six Gallery poets are not recreated in the film.</ref> In addition, parts of the poem are interpreted through animated sequences.

The film... is an exhilarating tribute from one form (cinema) to another (poetry). It takes Ginsberg's momentous, paradigm-changing poem as its launching pad and landing place; its beginning, middle, and end. You could call it a deconstruction except that sounds too formal.
