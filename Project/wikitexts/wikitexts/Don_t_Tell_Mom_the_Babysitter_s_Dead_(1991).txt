The plot focuses on a 17-year-old girl who assumes the role as head of the house when the elderly babysitter whom her mother had hired while she is away suddenly dies.\n\n''Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead'' was released in theaters on June 7, 1991 and grossed $25.1 million on a budget of $10 million. Despite moderate box-office success and receiving generally negative reviews from critics upon release, the film has gone on to gain a [[cult following]] on [[VHS]] and [[cable television]].\n\n==Plot==\nSue Ellen \"Swell\" Crandell is a 17-year-old [[Los Angeles]] high-school graduate who cannot afford to accompany her friends to Europe for the summer. When her divorced mother leaves for an Australian vacation with her boyfriend, Swell looks forward to a summer of freedom with her siblings Kenny, Zach, Melissa (along with her tri-colored [[Cardigan Welsh Corgi]] Elvis), and Walter.\n\nMuch to Swell's dismay, her mother hires a live-in babysitter named Mrs. Sturak, a seemingly sweet old woman who assures Mrs. Crandell that she can take care of all five children. As soon as Mrs. Crandell leaves, Mrs. Sturak shows her true colors as a tyrant, quickly drawing the ire of the children. However, she soon dies in her sleep. After Swell discovers the body, the kids worry that their mother will blame them for the death if they notify authorities. They agree to stuff Mrs. Sturak's body in a trunk and drop it off at a local [[funeral home]] with a note saying \"Nice Old Lady Inside, Died of Natural Causes\" while keeping Mrs. Sturak's car. They discover that the envelope their mother had given to Mrs. Sturak containing money for the summer is empty, and deduce that Mrs. Sturak had the money with her when they delivered her body to the funeral home.\n\nWith no money to pay the family's bills, Swell finds work at a [[Fast food|fast-food]] restaurant called Clown Dog. Despite a budding relationship with her coworker Bryan, she quits because of the obnoxious manager. Swell then forges an extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 under the guise of a [[Vassar College|Vassar]]-educated young fashion designer and applies at General Apparel West (GAW), hoping to secure a job as a receptionist. Company executive Rose Lindsey hires Swell as an executive assistant, much to the chagrin of Carolyn, a receptionist on Rose's floor who was initially in line for the job.\n\nWhile the kids have dinner at [[Chuck E. Cheese]], Mrs. Sturak's car is stolen by [[drag queen]]s, forcing Sue Ellen to call Bryan for a ride home. Swell obtains the keys to her mother's [[Volvo]] and begins stealing from [[petty cash]] at GAW to support the family, intending to return it when she receives her paycheck. Later, Swell is furious to discover that her siblings have stolen the petty-cash funds from her purse to buy extravagant gifts: Zach purchases a diamond ring for his girlfriend Cynthia and Walter orders a state-of-the-art home-entertainment center. Walter falls off the roof while trying to adjust the antenna, breaking his leg and forcing Swell to pay for his hospital visit.\n\nAt work, the inexperienced Swell must balance the adult responsibilities thrust upon her while still trying to enjoy herself as a teenager. The double life strains her relationship with Bryan when she discovers that he is Carolyn's brother. Resentful of Swell's promotion, Carolyn and her coworker Bruce repeatedly try to discredit Swell's accomplishments, even going so far as to make a copy of Swell's driver's license to prove she is only a teenager, but Rose views the efforts as the product of Carolyn's petty jealousy. Swell must also rebuff the unwelcome sexual advances of Rose's philandering boyfriend Gus, who also works with the company.\n\nWhen she learns that GAW is in danger of going out of business, Swell takes it upon herself to create a new clothing line, and Rose suggests holding a fashion show to exhibit the new designs. With no petty cash left to rent a banquet hall, Swell offers to host the party, convincing her siblings to help clean the house, beautify the yard and act as caterers. Although Swell manages to pull off the party, it comes to an abrupt end when Mrs. Crandell arrives home early, forcing Swell to confess her lie in front of everyone.\n\nCarolyn and Bruce find their vehicle vandalized by Kenny's friends while Rose breaks up with Gus. While apologizing to Rose after the party, Swell learns that her unique designs have saved GAW. Rose offers Swell a job as her [[personal assistant]], but Swell declines so that she can attend college. Rose tells Swell that she can \"pull some strings\" to get her admitted to Vassar.\n\nSwell and Bryan make up, but are soon interrupted by Mrs. Crandell who inquires about Mrs. Sturak. As the credits roll, two cemetery workers look over Mrs. Sturak's gravestone as they plan to use the money found on her to visit [[Las Vegas]]. The gravestone reads \"Nice Old Lady Inside, Died of Natural Causes.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as Sue Ellen \"Swell\" Crandell, a teenager who watches over her siblings when the babysitter dies.\n* [[Joanna Cassidy]] as Rose Lindsey, an executive at General Apparel West.\n* [[John Getz]] as Gus Brandon, Rose's philandering boyfriend.\n* [[Keith Coogan]] as Kenneth \"Kenny\" Crandell, the second oldest Crandell sibling after Swell who is a slacker and a stoner.\n* [[Josh Charles]] as Bryan, a worker at the restaurant Clown Dog who Sue befriends.\n* [[Concetta Tomei]] as Mrs. Crandell, the Crandell kids' mom - who goes on a vacation to Australia.\n* [[David Duchovny]] as Bruce, Head Inventory Clerk at General Apparel West.\n* [[Kimmy Robertson]] as Cathy Henderson\n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Carolyn, a receptionist at General Apparel West and older sister of Bryan who is jealous of Swell.\n* Eda Reiss Merin as Mrs. Sturak, an elderly and strict babysitter who dies watching over the Crandell kids.\n* [[Robert Hy Gorman]] as Walter Crandell, the 11-year-old brother of Swell who is a TV fanatic.\n* [[Danielle Harris]] as Melissa Crandell, the 12-year-old sister of Swell with a tomboy personality who is into baseball.\n* [[Christopher Pettiet]] as Zach Crandell, a 14-year-old ladies' man who is Swell's brother.\n* Chris Claridge as Lizard, one of Kenny's friends.\n* [[Jeff Bollow]] as Mole, one of Kenny's friends.\n* Michael Kopelow as Hellhound, one of Kenny's friends.\n* Alejandro Quezada as Skull, one of Kenny's friends.\n* Bryan Clark as Dr. Permutter, a doctor who tends to Walter's leg.\n* E.E.

Landau was inspired by the 1983 film ''[[Risky Business]]'', in which a high-school protagonist is thrust into the adult world and manages to hold his own. The first draft, titled ''The Real World'', was finished in 1987 and sold to [[20th Century Fox]], but was shelved. Fox wanted a film with a lighter theme than that of the script written by Landau and Ison and envisioned \"an actor like [[Winona Ryder]] in the starring role.\"<ref name=\"wieselman\" /> Landau was uneasy with the hiring of [[Stephen Herek]], then known for ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', to direct the film.<ref name=\"wieselman\" />\n\nIn 1989, the film was picked up by [[Outlaw Productions]], which attracted Christina Applegate to the project through her ''[[Married With Children]]'' costar [[Ed O'Neill]]. [[Joanna Cassidy]] was cast as Rose Lindsey after a suggestion by Landau. The film was one of David Duchovny's early roles before he achieved mainstream success, but casting director Sharon Bialy had trouble convincing the studio to hire him. [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] was originally cast as Melissa, but had to back out because [[Disney Channel]] would not release her from a television show in which she had been starring.<ref name=\"wieselman\" />\n\nAfter the production ended, the studio was forced to change ''The Real World'' title because of a conflict with [[MTV]]'s new television [[The Real World (TV series)|series of the same name]], and settled on ''Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead''. Landau was initially unimpressed with the revised title but accepted it after seeing [[Johnny Carson]] make a pun about it.<ref name=\"wieselman\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on June 7, 1991, bringing in $4.2&nbsp;million on its opening weekend and a total U.S. and Canada gross of $25,196,249,<ref name=\"bom\">{{cite web |title=Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead (1991) |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=donttellmomthebabysittersdead.htm |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=29 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709085813/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=donttellmomthebabysittersdead.htm |archive-date=9 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> making a small profit but below the filmmakers' expectations.

Let's hope none are dumber than this one. ...
