Set in [[Toronto]] during the early 1980s, it follows the CEO of a small [[UHF]] television station who stumbles upon a broadcast signal of [[snuff films]]. The layers of deception and [[mind-control]] conspiracy unfold as he uncovers the signal's source, and loses touch with reality in a series of increasingly bizarre hallucinations.\n\nDistributed by [[Universal Pictures]], ''Videodrome'' was the first film by Cronenberg to gain backing from any major Hollywood studio. With the highest budget of any of his films to date, the film was a [[box-office bomb]], recouping only $2.1 million from a $5.9 million budget. The film received praise for the special makeup effects, Cronenberg's direction, Woods and Harry's performances, its \"techno-[[surrealist]]\" aesthetic, and its cryptic, [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual]] themes.<ref name=technophobia>{{cite book | title=Technophobia!: science fiction visions of posthuman technology | first=Daniel | last=Dinello | publisher=University of Texas Press | year=2005 | isbn=0-292-70986-2 | page= 153}}</ref> Cronenberg won the [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Director|Best Direction]] award and was nominated for seven other awards at the [[5th Genie Awards]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/videodrome |title=Videodrome|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nNow considered a [[cult classic]], the film has been cited as one of Cronenberg's best, and a key example of the body horror and [[science fiction horror]] genres.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/240-videodrome|title=Videodrome|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deepfocusreview.com/definitives/videodrome/|title=Videodrome (1983) \u2013 Deep Focus Review \u2013 Movie Reviews, Critical Essays, and Film Analysis|website=Deep Focus Review|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref>\n[[File:Videodrome (1983) - trailer.webm|thumb|The film's trailer]]\n\n==Plot==\nMax Renn is the president of CIVIC-TV, a [[Toronto]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] television station specializing in sensationalist programming.

Max contacts Masha, a [[Softcore pornography|softcore pornographer]], and asks her to help him find out the truth about ''Videodrome''. Through Masha, Max learns that not only is the footage not faked, but it is the public \"face\" of a political movement. Masha further informs him that the enigmatic [[Media studies|media theorist]] Brian O'Blivion knows about ''Videodrome''.\n\nMax tracks down O'Blivion to a [[homeless shelter]] where vagrants are encouraged to engage in [[Marathon (media)|marathon sessions]] of television viewing. He discovers that O'Blivion's daughter Bianca runs the mission, intending to help realize her father's vision of a world in which television replaces every aspect of everyday life. Later, Max views a videotape in which O'Blivion informs him that ''Videodrome'' is a socio-political battleground in which a war is being fought to control the minds of the people of North America before being garrotted by Nicki; Max then hallucinates that Nicki speaks directly to him and causes his television to undulate as he kisses the screen. Disturbed, Max returns to O'Blivion's homeless shelter. Bianca tells him ''Videodrome'' carries a broadcast signal that causes the viewer to develop a malignant [[brain tumor]]. O'Blivion helped to create it as part of his vision for the future, and viewed the hallucinations as a higher form of reality. When he found out it was to be used for malevolent purposes, he attempted to stop his partners; they used his own invention to kill him. In the year before his death, O'Blivion recorded tens of thousands of videos, which now form the basis of his television appearances.\n\nLater that night, Max hallucinates placing his handgun in a slit in his abdomen. He is contacted by ''Videodrome''{{-'}}s producer, Barry Convex of the Spectacular Optical Corporation, an eyeglasses company that acts as a front for an [[Arms industry|arms company]], who uses a device to record Max's fantasies of whipping Nicki. Max then wakes up to find Masha's corpse in his bed. He frantically calls Harlan to photograph the body as evidence, but, shortly after he arrives, her body is no longer anywhere to be found.\n\nWanting to see the latest Videodrome broadcast, Max meets Harlan at his studio. There, Harlan reveals that he has been working with Convex with the goal of recruiting Max to their cause: to end North America's [[Decadence|cultural decay]] by giving fatal brain tumors to anyone so obsessed with sex and violence that they would watch ''Videodrome''. Convex then inserts a brainwashing [[Betamax]] tape into Max's torso. Under Convex's influence, Max murders his colleagues at CIVIC-TV. He later attempts to murder Bianca, who manages to stop him by showing him a videotape of Nicki's murder on the Videodrome set. Bianca then 'reprograms' Max to her father's cause: \"Death to ''Videodrome''. Long live the new flesh.\" On her orders, he kills Harlan and Convex.\n\nWanted for their murders as well of those of his colleagues, Max takes refuge on a derelict boat in the [[Port Lands]]. Appearing to him on a television, Nicki tells him he has weakened ''Videodrome'', but in order to completely defeat it, he must ascend to the next level and \"leave the old flesh\". The television then shows an image of Max shooting himself in the head, which causes the set to explode. Reenacting what he has just seen on the television, Max utters the words \"Long live the new flesh\" and shoots himself.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[James Woods]] as Max Renn\n*[[Debbie Harry]] as Nicki Brand\n*[[Sonja Smits]] as Bianca O'Blivion\n*[[Peter Dvorsky (actor)|Peter Dvorsky]] as Harlan\n*[[Leslie Carlson]] as Barry Convex\n*[[Jack Creley]] as Dr. Brian O'Blivion\n*Lynne Gorman as Masha\n*[[Julie Khaner]] as Bridey James\n*David Bolt as Raphael\n*Reiner Schwarz as Moses\n*[[Lally Cadeau]] as Rena King\n*[[King Cosmos]] as Brolley\n*[[Kay Hawtrey]] as Matron\n*[[David Tsubouchi]] as Japanese Pornographer}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe basis for ''Videodrome'' came from [[David Cronenberg]]'s childhood. Cronenberg used to pick up [[Television in the United States|American television signals]] from [[Buffalo, New York]], late at night after [[Television in Canada|Canadian stations]] had gone off the air, and worry he might see something disturbing not meant for public consumption.<ref name=commentary>Cronenberg, David. Director's commentary, ''Videodrome'', Criterion Collection DVD.</ref> As Cronenberg explained, \"I've always been interested in dark things and other people's fascinations with dark things. Plus, the idea of people locking themselves in a room and turning a key on a television set so that they can watch something extremely dark, and by doing that, allowing themselves to explore their fascinations.\"{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=34}} Cronenberg's first exploration of themes of the branding of sex and violence and media impacting people's reality was writing a treatment titled ''Network of Blood'' in the early 1970s; its premise was a worker for an independent television company (who would become Max Renn in ''Videodrome'') unintentionally finding, in the filmmaker's words, \"a private television network subscribed to by strange, wealthy people who were willing to pay to see bizarre things.\"{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=34}} He later planned the story to be told from the main character's [[first-person narrative|first-person perspective]], showcasing a duality between how insane he looks to other people and how he himself perceives a different reality in his head.{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=34}} Concepts similar to ''Network of Blood''{{'}}s were further explored in a 1977 episode of the [[CBC Television]] series ''[[Peep Show (Canadian TV series)|Peep Show]]'' Cronenberg directed, named \"The Victim.\"{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=34}} The film's fictional station CIVIC-TV was modeled on the real-life Canadian television network [[Citytv]], which was known for broadcasting pornographic content and violent films in its late-night programming blocs.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Torontoist|date=2012-11-21|title=Reel Toronto: Videodrome|url=https://torontoist.com/2012/11/reel-toronto-videodrome/|access-date=2021-01-22|website=Torontoist}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Perkins|first=Writer Will|date= May 21, 2015|title=Videodrome|url=https://www.artofthetitle.com/title/videodrome/|access-date=2021-01-22|website=www.artofthetitle.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCronenberg's increased reputation with films like ''[[Scanners]]'' (1981) made it easier for his projects to get produced, leading to the film's $5.5 million budget, more interest from studios and producers, and a larger number of interested actors to choose from.{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=35}} After the box office success of ''[[Scanners]]'', Cronenberg turned down the chance of directing ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', having had no desire to direct material produced by other filmmakers.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Collis |first=Clark |title=David Cronenberg Says Decision Not to Direct Return of the Jedi Was Met with 'Stunned Silence' |url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/09/28/david-cronenberg-return-of-the-jedi/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=9 February 2020 |date=September 28, 2018}}</ref> Cronenberg met with [[Pierre David (film producer)|Pierre David]] in [[Montreal]] to discuss ideas for a new film, with the former pitching two ideas, one of them being ''Videodrome''.<ref name=book/>\n\nCronenberg started writing the first draft of ''Videodrome'' in January 1981, and, as with first drafts of Cronenberg's prior projects, included many parts not featured in the final cut to make it more acceptable for audiences; this included Renn having an explosive grenade as a hand after he chops off his flesh gun during a hallucination, Renn and Nicki melting, via a kiss, into an object that then melts an on-looker, and five other characters besides Barry also dying of [[cancer]].{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=35}} Cronenberg admits that he was worried that the project would be rejected by Filmplan due to the excessive violent content of an early draft, but it was approved, with Claude H\u00e9roux joking that the movie would get a triple [[X rating]].<ref name=book>''Cronenberg on Cronenberg'' (1992)</ref> Although talent for the film was attracted using the first draft, alterations were made constantly from pre-production to post-production.{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=35}}\n\nAccumulation of the cast and crew started in the summer of 1981 in Toronto, with most of the supporting actors being local performers of the city.{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=35}} ''Videodrome''{{'}}s three producers, David, Claude H\u00e9roux and Victor Solnicki, suggested [[James Woods]] for the role of Max Renn; they unsuccessfully tried to attach him to another film they produced, ''Models'' (1982).{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=35}} Woods was a fan of ''[[Rabid (1977 film)|Rabid]]'' (1977) and ''Scanners'', and met Cronenberg in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] for the part; Cronenberg liked the fact that Woods was very articulate in terms of delivery,<ref name=commentary/> and Woods appreciated the filmmaker's oddball style as well as being a \"good controversialist\" with \"a lot of power.\"{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=35}} Cronenberg doubled for Woods in the scene where Max puts on the Videodrome helmet since the actor was afraid of getting electrocuted.<ref name=commentary/> Co-star [[Debbie Harry]] was recommended by David, and Cronenberg cast her after viewing her two times in ''[[Union City (film)|Union City]]'' (1980) and a Toronto audition.{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=35}} She had never had such a large part before, and said that the more experienced Woods gave her a number of helpful suggestions.<ref name=HarryFace>{{cite book |last1=Harry |first1=Debbie |last2=Simmons |first2=Sylvie |title=Face It |date=2019 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-074958-3 |pages=248\u2013252}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography for the film began on October 19, 1981, and ended in December of that same year, with the initial week of filming being devoted to videotaping various [[Video monitor|monitor inserts]]. These included the television monologues of Professor Brian O'Blivion, as well as the ''Videodrome'' torture scenes and the soft-core pornographic programs ''Samurai Dreams'' and ''Apollo & Dionysus''.<ref name=lucascriterion>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/676-medium-cruel-reflections-on-videodrome|title=Medium Cruel: Reflections on Videodrome|first=Tim |last=Lucas|author-link=Tim Lucas|date=2004|website=Criterion.com|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|access-date=December 7, 2010}}</ref> The videotape camera used for the monitor scenes was a Hitachi SK-91.{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=36}} The film's cinematography was handled by [[Mark Irwin]], who was very uncomfortable with doing the monitor scenes; he was far more experienced with composing shots for regular film cameras than videotapes, disliked the flat television standards of lighting and color, and couldn't compose his shots privately as all of the film crew watched the monitors as the shots were being set up.{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=36}}\n\nThe ''Samurai Dreams'' short was filmed in half a day without any audio recorded at a rented spot at a [[Global Television Network|Global TV]] studio in Toronto, and lasted five minutes longer than what ended up in the final film.{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=36}}\n\nThree different endings were filmed. The ending used in the final film, wherein Max shoots himself on the derelict ship, was James Woods' idea.<ref name=hnnnet>{{cite web|url=https://www.horrornewsnetwork.net/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-videodrome/|title=Ten Things You Might Not Know About \u2026 Videodrome!|first=William |last=Burns|date=August 28, 2014|website=HorrorNewsNetwork.net|access-date=March 11, 2018}}</ref> One of the initial intentions for the ending was to include an epilogue after the suicide, wherein Max, Bianca, and Nicki appear on the set of ''Videodrome''. Bianca and Nicki are shown to have chest slits like Max, from which grotesque, mutated [[sex organ]]s emerge.<ref name=hnnnet/> Cronenberg described his original vision of the ending as follows: \"After the suicide, [Max] ends up on the 'Videodrome' set with Nicki, hugging and kissing and neat stuff like that. A happy ending? Well, it's my version of a happy ending\u2014boy meets girl on the 'Videodrome' set, with the clay wall maybe covered in blood, but I'm not sure. [[Freudian]] rebirth imagery, pure and simple.\"<ref name=lucascriterion/> In his director's commentary for the [[Criterion Collection]] release of the film, Cronenberg credited his decision to omit the epilogue at least partially to his own [[Atheism|atheist]] beliefs, as the apparent [[resurrection]] of Max and Nicki on the Videodrome set could be interpreted as having gone to an [[afterlife]], whereas Cronenberg himself does not believe in one.\n\n=== Special effects ===\nThe special makeup effects were devised by [[Rick Baker]], with his crew composed mostly of twenty-year-olds; some of them had worked with Baker in ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'', while Michael Lennick served as special video effects supervisor. To create the breathing effects of the television set that Max interacts with, Frank C. Carere utilized an air compressor with valves hooked to a piano keyboard that he himself operated.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The undulating screen of the television set was created using a [[video projector]] and a sheet of rubbery [[dental dam]]. Baker stated that \"I knew we would need a flexible material ... we tested with a [[weather balloon]] first, stretching it over a frame the size of a TV screen, and pushed a hand through it to see how far it stretched, and then we [[Rear projection effect|rear-projected]] on it.\"<ref name=lucascriterion/> [[Betamax]] videotape cassettes were used as items to be inserted into Max's stomach slit, because [[VHS]] cassettes were too large to fit the faux abdominal wound.<ref>{{cite web |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About... Videodrome |url=https://www.hmv.com/video/10-things-you-didn-t-know-about-videodrome |website=HMV |access-date=20 October 2021}}</ref> Woods found the stomach slit uncomfortable,<ref name=hnnnet/> and after a long day of wearing it, vented, \"I am not an actor anymore. I'm just the bearer of the slit!\"<ref name=HarryFace/> Baker's original concept for Max's flesh gun featured eyes, mouth and foreskin, which Cronenberg found to be \"too graphic\".{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The cancer effects caused by Max's flesh gun went through various tests, with some tests having the face of the victim being distorted through the use of [[solvent]]s, but Baker decided against this upon learning that his mentor, [[Dick Smith (make-up artist)|Dick Smith]], had recently used the same technique in '' [[Spasms (film)|Spasms]]''.<ref name=lucascriterion/> Baker settled on having the cancer tumors burst out from the body of Barry Convex, with his crew operating a dummy underneath the set. Lennick devised effects such as having the image of the Videodrome television set distort whenever Max would whip it through the use of a device which he called the \"Videodromer\", and glitch and twitch effects related to Max's visions through the Videodrome helmet, but these effects were scrapped due to budget and time concerns.<ref name=lucascriterion/><ref name=commentary/><ref name=documentary>''Videodrome'', Criterion Collection ''Videodrome - Forging the New Flesh'', documentary</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Videodrome (soundtrack)}}\nAn [[Film score|original score]] was composed for ''Videodrome'' by Cronenberg's close friend, Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lucas |first=Tim |author-link=Tim Lucas |title= Studies in the Horror Film: Videodrome |publisher=[[Centipede Press]] |location=Lakewood, CO |year=2008 |page=130 |isbn=978-1-933618-28-9}}</ref> The score was composed to follow Max Renn's descent into video hallucinations, starting out with dramatic orchestral music that increasingly incorporates, and eventually emphasizes, electronic instrumentation. To achieve this, Shore composed the entire score for an orchestra before programming it into a [[Synclavier]] II digital synthesizer. The rendered score, taken from the Synclavier II, was then recorded being played in tandem with a small string section.<ref name=lucas133>{{Cite book |last=Lucas |first=Tim |author-link=Tim Lucas |title=Studies in the Horror Film - Videodrome |publisher=Centipede Press |location=Lakewood, CO |year=2008 |page=133 |isbn=978-1-933618-28-9}}</ref> The resulting sound was a subtle blend that often made it difficult to tell which sounds were real and which were synthesized.\n\nThe soundtrack was also released on vinyl by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]], and was re-released on compact disc in 1998. The album itself is not just a straight copy of Shore's score, but a remix. Shore has commented that while there were small issues with some of the acoustic numbers, \"on the whole I think they did very well\".<ref name=lucas133/>\n\n== Themes ==\nAccording to [[Tim Lucas]], ''Videodrome'' deals with \"the impression of a sprawlingly technological world on our human senses; the fascination and horror of sex and violence; and the boundaries of reality and consciousness.\"{{Sfn|Lucas|1983|p=33}} Cronenberg modeled Brian O'Blivion and his theories on [[Marshall McLuhan]], who taught at the [[University of Toronto]] when he attended it.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-04-19|title=The Video Word Made Flesh: 'Videodrome' and Marshall McLuhan|url=https://themillions.com/2017/04/the-video-word-made-flesh-videodrome-and-marshall-mcluhan.html|access-date=2021-01-22|website=The Millions|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a {{RT data|score}} aggregate rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}.

There are some differences, however, such as the inclusion of the \"bathtub sequence\", a scene never filmed in which a television rises from Max Renn's bathtub like in [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]''.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Lucas\n | first = Tim\n | author-link = Tim Lucas\n | title = Studies in the Horror Film - Videodrome\n | publisher = [[Centipede Press]]\n | location = Lakewood, CO\n | year = 2008\n | page = 119\n | isbn = 978-1-933618-28-9 }}\n</ref> This was the result of the lead time required to write the book, which left Etchison working with an earlier draft of the script than was used in the film.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pirate television]]\n* [[Snuff film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite magazine|last=Lucas|first=Tim|date=December 1983|title=Videodrome|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|pages=32\u201349}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Lucas, Tim.
