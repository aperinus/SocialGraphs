[[Amanda Seyfried]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] star as inhabitants of a society which uses time from one's lifespan as its primary currency, with each individual possessing a clock on their arm that counts down how long they have to live. [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Vincent Kartheiser]], [[Olivia Wilde]], [[Matt Bomer]], [[Johnny Galecki]], and [[Alex Pettyfer]] also star. The film was released on October 28, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2169, people are genetically engineered to stop aging on their 25th birthday, when a one-year countdown on their forearm begins. When it reaches zero, the person \"times out\" and dies instantly. Time has thus become the universal currency, transferred directly between people or stored in \"time capsules\". Several major areas called Time Zones exist; Dayton is the poorest, a manufacturing \"ghetto\" where people rarely have over 24 hours on their clocks, whereas in New Greenwich, people are wealthy enough to be essentially immortal.\n\nWill Salas, a 28-year-old Dayton factory worker, lives with his 50-year-old mother, Rachel. One night, he rescues a drunken 105-year-old man named Henry Hamilton from 75-year-old Fortis and his Minutemen, a group of time-robbing thugs. In a secret location, Hamilton, who has 116 years remaining on his clock but is tired of living, reveals to Will that the people of New Greenwich hoard most of the time while constantly increasing prices to keep poorer people dying. The following day, he transfers all but five minutes of his time to a sleeping Will, then times out by falling off a bridge before Will can stop him. Raymond Leon, the 75-year-old leader of a unit of police-like Timekeepers, erroneously assumes Will robbed and killed Hamilton.\n\nWill visits his friend Borel, who warns him against having so much time in Dayton, and gives him ten years, one for each year of their friendship, before meeting his mother to leave for New Greenwich together. However, the city bus fare has risen from one to two hours, and Rachel, having used all but 90 minutes of her time to pay off a two-day loan, is short on a bus fare to return to Dayton. The uncaring driver forces her to run back to Dayton, but she arrives a few seconds too late for Will to save her and times out in his arms. Heartbroken and angry, Will vows revenge for his mother's death by taking the people of New Greenwich for everything they have.\n\nIn New Greenwich, Will meets 110-year-old time-loaning businessman Philippe Weis and his 27-year-old daughter Sylvia at a casino. While playing poker, Will pretends to nearly time out but eventually wins over a millennium in a flawless gamble. Sylvia invites him to a party, and Will buys a new sports car and drives there. Raymond arrives and arrests Will, who insists on his innocence in Hamilton's death. Rather than attempting to prove Will's guilt, he confiscates all but two hours of Will's time, explaining it does not belong in Dayton.\n\nWill escapes, taking Sylvia to Dayton as a hostage, but Fortis' gang ambushes them, taking most of their time and leaving them with 30 minutes each. Will attempts to get some time back from Borel, but his wife Greta tearfully explains that he has drunk himself to death. They manage to get a day each by selling Sylvia's earrings. Will calls Weis to demand a 1,000-year ransom to be paid into the time-mission for the desperate. When Weis refuses, Will releases Sylvia anyway. Raymond finds Will, but Sylvia shoots him in the arm. Will gives Raymond enough time to survive long enough for his squad to find him and steals his car.\n\nNow committed to ending the system, Will and Sylvia rob Weis' time banks, giving the extra time capsules to the needy, but soon realize that they cannot significantly change anything, as prices are raised faster to compensate for the extra time. Fortis' gang ambushes them, but Will manages to time out Fortis in an arm-wrestling match and shoot his thugs. He and Sylvia then decide to rob Weis' vault of a 1,000,000-year capsule. Raymond chases them back to Dayton but fails to stop them from distributing the stolen time; Raymond times out, having neglected to collect his day's salary. Will and Sylvia nearly time out themselves but survive by taking Raymond's salary.\n\nTV reports show factories in Dayton shutting down as everyone has enough time and abandons their jobs. Having seen the consequences of his obsession with the pair, Raymond's colleague Jaeger orders the Timekeepers to return home. Will and Sylvia progress to larger banks, still trying to crash the system.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Will Salas\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Sylvia Weis \n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Timekeeper Raymond Leon\n* [[Alex Pettyfer]] as Fortis\n* [[Vincent Kartheiser]] as Philippe Weis\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Rachel Salas\n* [[Matt Bomer]] as Henry Hamilton\n* [[Johnny Galecki]] as Borel\n* [[Collins Pennie]] as Timekeeper Jaeger\n* [[Ethan Peck]] as Constantin\n* [[Yaya DaCosta]] as Greta, Borel's wife\n* [[Rachel Roberts (model)|Rachel Roberts]] as Carrera\n* [[August Emerson]] as Levi\n* [[Sasha Pivovarova]] as Clara Weis, Sylvia's grandmother and Philippe's mother-in-law\n* [[Jesse Lee Soffer]] as Webb\n* [[Bella Heathcote]] as Michele Weis, Sylvia's mother and Philippe's wife\n* [[Toby Hemingway]] as Timekeeper Kors\n* [[Melissa Ordway]] as Leila\n* [[Jessica Parker Kennedy]] as Edouarda\n* Jeff Staron as Oris\n* [[Matt O'Leary]] as Moser\n* [[Nick Lashaway]] as Ekman\n* [[Ray Santiago]] as Victa\n* [[Kris Lemche]] as Markus\n* [[Laura Ashley Samuels]] as Sagita\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nBefore the film was titled ''In Time'', the names ''Now'' and ''I'm.mortal'' were used.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cinemablend.com/new/I-m-mortal-Retitled-Now-Adds-Alex-Pettyfer-And-Matt-Bomer-To-Cast-21491.html|title=I'm.mortal Retitled Now, Adds Alex Pettyfer And Matt Bomer To Cast|first=Katey|last=Rich|date=November 1, 2010|work=Cinema Blend|access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref> On July 12, 2010, it was reported that [[Amanda Seyfried]] had been offered a lead role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NE36cc5aTpJx5c|title=Amanda Seyfried Signs on to I'm.mortal|first=Brian|last=Gallagher|date=July 12, 2010|work=[[MovieWeb]]|access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref> On July 27, 2010, it was confirmed that [[Justin Timberlake]] had been offered a lead role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=68287|title=Justin Timberlake Leading I'm.mortal?|first=Edward|last=Douglas|date=July 27, 2012|work=ComingSoon.net|access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref> On August 9, 2010, [[Cillian Murphy]] was confirmed to have joined the cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NE1rNPRWpMpc54|title=Cillian Murphy to Star in I'm.mortal|first=Brian|last=Gallagher|date=August 9, 2010|work=[[MovieWeb]]|access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe first photos from the set were revealed on October 28, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=71240|title=Timberlake and Seyfried Spotted Filming Their New Thriller|date=October 28, 2010|work=ComingSoon.net|access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref> [[20th Century Fox]] and [[New Regency]] distributed the film, and [[Marc Abraham]] and Eric Newman's [[Strike Entertainment]] produced it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/justin-timberlake-cillian-murphy-talks-join-immortal-19974|title=Justin Timberlake, Cillian Murphy in Talks to Join 'I'm.mortal| first=Jeff| last=Sneider| date=August 9, 2010|work=[[TheWrap]]|access-date=December 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with Kristopher Tapley of ''In Contention'', [[Roger Deakins]] stated that he would be shooting the film in digital, which makes this the first film to be shot in digital by the veteran cinematographer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://incontention.com/2010/12/22/tech-support-interview-true-grit-cinematographer-roger-deakins|title=TECH SUPPORT INTERVIEW: 'True Grit' cinematographer Roger Deakins| first=Kristopher| last=Tapley| date=December 22, 2010| work=In Contention|access-date=December 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Dayton scenes were filmed primarily in the [[Skid Row, Los Angeles|Skid Row]] and [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles|Boyle Heights]] neighborhoods of Los Angeles, while the New Greenwich scenes were filmed primarily in [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]], [[Bel Air, California|Bel Air]], and [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. Although the names of the ghetto-like zone and wealthy enclave reflect Dayton and Greenwich, respectively, the maps used by the Timekeepers are maps of [[Los Angeles]].\n\nFor the [[retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] setting, the production's vehicle suppliers assembled a fleet of cars and trucks from used car lots and junkyards. Although an old [[Citro\u00ebn DS]] 21 and [[Cadillac Seville]] feature, center stage goes to a fleet of seemingly immaculate Dodge Challengers and Lincoln Continentals. The rich drive around in the high gloss Lincolns, all of which have been smoothed, lowered and fitted with oversized disc wheels on low profile rubber. The Dodges are the Time Keeper's ''cop cars''. These too have been smoothed and externally customized, with grilles front and rear covering the lights, and low profile tires on disc wheels. In stark contrast to the Lincolns, paintwork is matte black. A slim police light-bar is fitted internally, behind the windshield.\n\nThe use of retrofuturism is one of many elements that the film shares with Niccol's earlier work, ''[[Gattaca]]''; Niccol himself referred to it as \"the bastard child of ''Gattaca''\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Capps |first1=Robert |title=Director Calls In Time 'Bastard Child of Gattaca' |url=https://www.wired.com/2011/10/in-time-gattaca/ |access-date=September 23, 2020 |magazine=Wired |date=October 6, 2011}}</ref>  That film also features electrically powered vintage cars (notably a [[Rover P6]] and again, a [[Citro\u00ebn DS]]), as well as buildings of indeterminate age. ''Gattaca'' also deals with innate inequalities (though in its case genetic, rather than longevity) and also features a character seeking to cross the divide that his birthright is supposed to deny him. Similarly, he is pursued by law enforcement officers after being wrongly identified as having committed a murder.\n\n==Similar works==\nThe series ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'' in 1952 included an episode, \"Time to Go\" (episode 29),<ref>{{cite web |title=Tales of Tomorrow, Time to Go |url=https://archive.org/details/Tales_Of_Tomorrow_-_Time_To_Go |website=Internet Archive |publisher=Internet Archive |access-date=26 October 2021}}</ref> in which aliens from another galaxy, who have learned how to use time as a currency, set up a \"time bank\" on Earth. The aliens solicit Earthling customers to bank some of their time in the bank in order to earn interest in the form of extended life. However, the aliens use a loophole in the contract with their customers to take all of their time, thus leaving the Earthlings dead. In [[Harlan Ellison]]'s 1965 short story \"[[\"Repent, Harlequin!\" Said the Ticktockman|{{-'}}Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman]]\", the crime of being late is punished by a proportionate amount of time being \"revoked\" from one's life. The ultimate consequence is to run out of time and be \"turned off\". This is done by the Master Timekeeper, or \"Ticktockman\".\n\nMany of the elements of ''In Time'' can be found in the 1987 short film ''[[The Price of Life (1987 film)|The Price of Life]]'',<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://vimeo.com/16265933 |title=The Price of Life |access-date=June 25, 2018 |author=jolipere |date=October 27, 2010 |via=[[Vimeo]]}}</ref> made by Chanticleer Films. Its basic premise and storyline are so similar that ''In Time'' has been called an unacknowledged remake of the earlier film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bryan |first=Steven |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/news/does-time-owe-debt-american-playhouses-price-life-221100365.html |title=Does 'In Time' Owe a Debt to 'American Playhouse's' 'The Price of Life'? |work=[[Yahoo! Movies]] |date=October 25, 2011 |access-date=July 5, 2013}}</ref> ''The Price of Life'' was a 38-minute short film (story by [[Stephen Tolkin]] and Michel Monteaux) in which a time account is physically linked to every infant at birth, with death automatic when the balance drops to zero. An elite upper-class is portrayed as living hundreds of years or more. The protagonist is given a certain amount of time as an infant, and as a young boy adds days and years to his time account by buying valuables from people and selling them to visiting tourists from the rich enclave. After his sister dies after gambling away her time, the protagonist (now a young man) sets out on a journey to the enclave of \"the Old Ones\" in order to save the life of his mother, who is (literally) running out of time. He gets there and meets a beautiful older woman who co-opts him into the immortal lifestyle.\n\nThe novel and movie ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]'' (1976) depict a world where everyone is destroyed when they reach the age of 30 in the film or 21 in the book. The antagonists are Sandmen who hunt Runners trying to avoid destruction.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.moviesmackdown.com/2011/10/in-time-vs-logans-run.html| first=Eric| last=Volkman| title=In Time (2011) -vs- Logan's Run (1976)| work=Movie Smackdown| date=October 27, 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104215425/http://www.moviesmackdown.com/2011/10/in-time-vs-logans-run.html| archive-date=November 4, 2011| access-date=November 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Salad Fingers|David Firth]]'s 2008 ''A Short Cartoon About Time'' also has the same concept of selling time for monetary gain.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/idCFV0KF4uo Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130302233749/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idCFV0KF4uo Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idCFV0KF4uo| title = David Firth : A Short Cartoon about Time | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n=== Copyright lawsuit ===\nOn September 15, 2011, a lawsuit was filed against the film by attorneys acting on behalf of [[Harlan Ellison]], author of \"[[\"Repent, Harlequin!\" Said the Ticktockman|{{-'}}Repent, Harlequin!'

The suit, naming New Regency, director Andrew Niccol and a number of anonymous [[John Doe]]s, appears to base its claim on the similarity that both the completed film and Ellison's story concern a dystopian future in which people have a set amount of time to live which can be revoked, given certain pertaining circumstances by a recognized authority known as a Timekeeper. Initially, the suit demanded an injunction against the film's release;<ref>{{cite web |last=Gardner |first=Eriq |date=September 15, 2011 |title=Harlan Ellison Sues Claiming Fox's 'In Time' Rips Off Sci-Fi Story (Exclusive) |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/harlan-ellison-sues-claiming-foxs-235987 |access-date=June 25, 2018 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> however, Ellison later altered his suit to instead ask for screen credit<ref>{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Roger |date=August 26, 2014 |title=Ellison wants 'In Time' concessions \u2014 only asks for credit? |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2011/11/ellison-wins-in-time-lawsuit-but-only-asks-for-credit-to-be-given.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213083348/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2011/11/ellison-wins-in-time-lawsuit-but-only-asks-for-credit-to-be-given.html |archive-date=February 13, 2013 |access-date=October 5, 2014 |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |df=mdy-all}}</ref> before ultimately dropping the suit, with both sides releasing the following joint statement: \"After seeing the film ''In Time'', Harlan Ellison decided to voluntarily dismiss the Action.
