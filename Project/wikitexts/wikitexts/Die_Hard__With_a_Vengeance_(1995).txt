It was written by [[Jonathan Hensleigh]], based on the screenplay ''Simon Says'' by Hensleigh and on [[List of Die Hard characters|the characters]] created by [[Roderick Thorp]] for his 1979 novel ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (Thorp novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]''. ''Die Hard with a Vengeance'' is the third film in the [[Die Hard (film series)|''Die Hard'' film series]], after ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' (1990). It is followed by ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]'' (2007) and ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'' (2013).\n\nThe film stars [[Bruce Willis]] as [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Lieutenant [[John McClane]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver, who team up to stop bomb threats across [[New York City]] carried out by \"Simon\" ([[Jeremy Irons]]). It was released on May 19, 1995 to mixed reviews and became [[1995 in film#Highest-grossing films|the highest-grossing film of the year]]. The film later gained a cult following and has been considered by many critics and fans as the best sequel of the franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/die-hard-with-a-vengeance-review/|title = DIE HARD WITH a VENGEANCE Review.

A man identifying himself as \"Simon\" telephones the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD), claiming responsibility and threatens to detonate another bomb unless policeman, [[John McClane]], is sent to [[Harlem]] wearing a [[sandwich board]] with a racist slur on it. The NYPD comply and send McClane to Harlem, where he is confronted by an electrician and shop owner named Zeus Carver. McClane explains his situation before a nearby crowd also confronts McClane over his sign. Carver intervenes and saves McClane, and they escape in a car. They arrive at [[1 Police Plaza]], where Simon demands that the pair follow a timed challenge or he will set off more bombs. They agree and McClane eventually boards the [[3 (New York City Subway service)|3 train]] heading towards the [[Wall Street station (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|Wall Street station]] in order to defuse a bomb that Simon planted on it. Carver arrives at the station before McClane finds the bomb and throws it on the tracks just as it explodes.\n\nMcClane and Carver regroup with the NYPD and meet some [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agents, who initially inform the pair that Simon is \"Peter Krieg\", a [[mercenary]] and former [[colonel]] in the [[National People's Army]] before revealing to them that Krieg is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of [[Hans Gruber (character)|Hans Gruber]], who McClane [[Die Hard|killed years earlier]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Simon then places another call to the NYPD, informing them that he has planted an explosive in one of the city's [[Primary school|elementary school]]s which is set to explode once class ends and can be triggered by the same radio frequencies utilised by law enforcement. Simon offers to give the authorities the school's location if McClane and Carver follow another timed challenge, warning that he will detonate the explosive if any evacuation attempts are carried out. While the pair solve Simon's next challenge, the NYPD begin to search all elementary schools in the city.\n\nMcClane realizes that Simon is attempting to distract the NYPD away from [[Wall Street]], which has no schools, and travels to the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building]] and discovers that Simon's men have stolen $140 billion of [[Precious metal#Bullion|gold bullion]] from there using [[dump truck]]s. He follows the trucks into a [[New York City Water Tunnel No. 3|water tunnel]] while Carver continues Simon's challenges. Simon blows up a [[cofferdam]] and floods the tunnel, but McClane escapes and reunites with Carver. Surviving a car chase with Simon's men, the pair find that they were carrying enough money to pay for a [[Toll bridge|bridge toll]]. The pair sneak aboard a [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] docked in the [[Long Island Sound]], but Simon's associates capture them and tie them up next to a bomb. Simon explains that his school threat was fake and broadcasts a message claiming that he is planning on destroying the tanker to destabilize the [[Western world]]'s economy. After he leaves, Carver and McClane free themselves and escape the tanker just before the bomb detonates.\n\nAs McClane and Carver are debriefed by the NYPD, McClane informs them that none of the bullion Simon's men stole was on the tanker's [[Hold (compartment)|cargo hold]], having deduced that Simon had intended to keep all of it for himself using his knowledge of the Gruber family's ''[[modus operandi]]''. While attempting to place a call to his estranged wife Holly, McClane glances at a bottle of [[aspirin]] given to him by Simon onboard the tanker and notices that it was purchased at a [[truck stop]] in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]] on the [[Canada\u2013United States border]]. McClane informs the NYPD of his discovery, and joins them and Carver as they rush towards a warehouse near the truck stop where Simon and his men are redistributing the bullion and planning their escape. The rest of Simon's men are quickly apprehended by law enforcement personnel, though Simon and his girlfriend Katya attempt to escape via a helicopter. McClane catches up to them and shoots at an overhead power line, which falls onto the helicopter, causing it to crash into the ground and explode. While they are celebrating their triumph, Carver persuades McClane to place another call to Holly again.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[John McClane]]\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Simon Peter Gruber\n* [[Samuel L.

Producer [[Joel Silver]] and 20th Century Fox wanted the third ''Die Hard'' film to take place on a ship; to that effect, between 1991 and 1992 they hired screenwriter W. Peter Iliff to write a script for ''Die Hard 3'' which would take place on a cruise ship in the Caribbean, where John McClane and his wife are when it gets taken over by terrorists who threaten the passengers' lives with a bomb. Iliff had recently written ''[[Point Break]]'' (1991), which turned into a huge hit and was a principle factor in his hiring. The initial version of ''Die Hard 3'' would have been based on a spec script titled ''Troubleshooter'' by [[James Haggin]], who wrote it in late 1989 and sold it to Largo Entertainment in March 1990, before Fox bought it from them in 1991, as they considered it ideal for the next ''Die Hard'' sequel. The original script required a number of rewrites to bring it in line with the series; however, the addition of several action sequences inflated the expected budget considerably.\n\nIliff's second re-write of the script was in progress when a similar film, titled ''Dreadnought'' and starring [[Steven Seagal]], went into production at Warner Bros. By the time Iliff completed his third re-write to remove or reduce similarities, the Seagal film was re-titled, first to ''Last To Surrender'' (because producers wanted three word title like Seagal's previous films had), and then to ''[[Under Siege]]'' (1992). Fox then decided it was pointless to keep trying to make this version of the third Die Hard film due to the perceived similarities. Ironically enough, before it was bought by Warner Bros for $1 million, [[J.F. Lawton]]'s original 1990 spec script for ''Under Siege'' (titled ''Dreadnought'') had been offered to Joel Silver to be possibly re-written into ''Die Hard 3'', but Silver had refused. During script development, [[Warner Bros.]] offered Iliff a job of re-writing ''Dreadnought'', not knowing he was already working on ''Die Hard 3''. Silver and Fox even bought another similar spec titled ''Supertanker'' in order to prevent it from being produced before ''Die Hard 3''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/09/25/Multiple-spoof/4882717393600/|title=Multiple spoof|website=UPI}}</ref><ref name=\"latimes\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-11-01-ca-1596-story.html|title=OFF-CENTERPIECE : 'Die Hard 3' Blown Out of the Water by 'Siege'|last=Wells|first=Jeffrey|date=November 1, 1992|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] S|issn=0458-3035|access-date=November 11, 2016|archive-date=February 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202080403/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-11-01-ca-1596-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1992/film/news/two-word-title-twice-as-nice-for-steven-seagal-101248/|title=Two-word title twice as nice for Steven Seagal|first1=Andy|last1=Marx|date=October 9, 1992}}</ref><ref>Kathy O'Malley, &.

It was rumored that the script was later adapted and used for ''[[Speed 2: Cruise Control]]''. [[Jan De Bont]], the director of ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' conceived the story for ''Speed 2'' independently from what was developed for the \"cruise ship\" version of ''Die Hard 3'', though certain elements were re-used in a minor capacity. Following all the issues during early development and previous problems he and [[Bruce Willis]] had with one another following the very troubled production of ''[[The Last Boy Scout]]'' (1991), Silver left the ''Die Hard 3'' production and never worked on any other ''Die Hard'' film or with Willis again, and [[John McTiernan]], who was going to return to direct this version of the third film, also quit the project. McTiernan disliked the concept of the entire film taking place on a ship. Director [[Danny Cannon]] was then involved to direct the film for some time, possibly when later different scripts were in development.\n\nBetween 1993 and 1994 at least three more versions of ''Die Hard 3'' were written, each one very different from the others. The first was written by [[John Milius]] and it took place in a jungle, and after his version was rejected, two more were written at the same time by two different writers. One by [[Doug Richardson]] which took place in Los Angeles subways taken over by terrorists who are actually planning to rob the federal reserve of the city, and second by [[John Fasano]] which took place across an entire city (New York or L.A.) as McClane chases kidnappers who took his teenage daughter, thinking she was the daughter of some rich industrialist. Both scripts were rejected by Willis, who felt they were more like ''Die Hard'' rip-offs, although the ending of Richardson's script was used for the ending of ''Speed'', which Richardson confirmed in interviews. Interestingly, the \"Die Hard in the jungle\" storyline was also at one point going to be used for the fourth ''Die Hard'' film which was in development around 1997, based on the original script by [[Alan B. McElroy]] titled ''Tears of the Sun'', about a group of people who go to the Amazon to set up a radio relay station only to end up encountering drug dealers and then having to escape through the jungle from them. Bruce Willis really liked McElroy's script, which was also considered to be re-written into a new modern ''Tarzan'' film before Willis had it changed into ''Die Hard 4'', and when the version of ''Die Hard 4'' based on it wasn't made, he requested for the title of his 2002 action war film ''Man of War'' to be renamed to ''[[Tears of the Sun]]'', which is why the film is occasionally erroneously cited as being based on the same script as the unproduced ''Die Hard 4''.<ref>L.A.

But apparently feeling that Tears of the Sun sounds a bit too much like some three-hanky melodrama, the suits at Revolution Studios and the film's producers decided to change the title to Hostile Rescue and then to Man of War. Enter Fox, which owns the rights to a property with the Man of War moniker. The studio reportedly offered to provide the War title. In return, producer Arnold Rifkin's Cheyenne Enterprises would have to agree to devise yet another Die Hard scenario for Willis.\"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/153721916/|title=Reno Gazette-Journal from Reno, Nevada on April 14, 1994 \u00b7 Page 83|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nFinally, after [[Brandon Lee]]'s death on set of ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', Fox took another spec script titled ''Simon Says'' by [[Jonathan Hensleigh]], which was offered as Lee's next film and considered as a sequel to Lee's ''[[Rapid Fire (1992 film)|Rapid Fire]]'', and decided to adapt it into what eventually became ''Die Hard With a Vengeance''. Hensleigh's original script was about a mad bomber who wants revenge against a police detective who is forced by the bomber to find and stop his bombs from exploding, and the only help he has is a shop owner who becomes involved by accident. Originally in early 1993 Joel Silver and Warner Bros. tried to buy ''Simon Says'' to have it re-written into ''Lethal Weapon 4'', but 20th Century Fox bought it instead. The script then went through dozens of different re-writes by writers such as Hensleigh, Dan Bronson, [[Lorenzo Semple Jr]], [[David Shaber]], and others. At some point during re-writes Zeus was changed into a female character which [[Angela Bassett]] was in talks to play. Even after the movie was completed, a new ending had to be written and filmed to replace the darker original ending, in which McClane is blamed for everything that's happened and loses his job, but still manages to track down Simon months later and makes Simon kill himself by accident after playing a game called \"McClane Says\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n[[Andrew G.

Producer Andy Vajna held out on the deal. Fishburne had earlier turned down the role of Jules Winnfield in ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', which was eventually played by Samuel L. Jackson. Fishburne was talked out of playing Jules by his representatives who wanted him to only accept leading parts, otherwise he would be stuck career-wise as a supporting actor. Subsequently, ''Pulp Fiction'' premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] during the same time as Fishburne's pay negotiations. Vajna also attended the event to support Willis who was appearing in the [[Quentin Tarantino]] film. Tarantino recalled that Vajna was so impressed by Jackson's performance that he offered him the part of Carver instead. Fishburne later filed a lawsuit against Vajna's company Cinergi for reneging on a verbal agreement.<ref>{{cite news |title=Quentin Tarantino Says Laurence Fishburne Turned Down 'Pulp Fiction' Which Led To Him Losing Role In 'Die Hard' |url=https://theplaylist.net/laurence-fishburne-tarantino-pulp-fiction-role-die-hard-20200120/ |work=theplaylist.net |access-date=January 26, 2020 |archive-date=January 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126040023/https://theplaylist.net/laurence-fishburne-tarantino-pulp-fiction-role-die-hard-20200120/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Insider |url=https://people.com/archive/the-insider-vol-46-no-18/ |work=People.com |access-date=January 26, 2020 |archive-date=January 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126040021/https://people.com/archive/the-insider-vol-46-no-18/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The lawsuit took two years and Fishburne received a settlement.<ref>{{cite web |date=19 August 2020 |last=Jung |first=E.

It can be found on the Special Edition DVD. In this version, it is presumed that the robbery succeeds, and that McClane was used as the scapegoat for everything that went wrong. He is fired from the NYPD after more than 20 years on the force and the FBI has even taken away his pension. Nevertheless, he still manages to track Simon using the batch number on the bottle of aspirins and they meet in a bar in Hungary. In this version, Simon has double-crossed most of his accomplices, gotten the loot to a safe hiding place somewhere in Hungary, and has the gold turned into statuettes of the [[Empire State Building]] in order to smuggle it out of the country; but he is still tracked down to his foreign hideaway. McClane is keen to take his problems out on Simon, who he invites to play a game called \"McClane Says\". This involves a form of [[Russian roulette]] with a small Chinese rocket launcher that has had the sights removed, meaning it is impossible to determine which end is which. McClane then asks Simon some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Simon gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which fires the rocket through Simon, killing him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/die-hard-with-a-vengeance-review/|title=Dying Hard: Matt Revisits DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|first=Matt|last=Goldberg|date=February 13, 2013|access-date=June 13, 2020|archive-date=June 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200613042808/https://collider.com/die-hard-with-a-vengeance-review/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Commentary\">{{cite AV media|title=Alternate Ending with Optional Commentary with Jonathan Hensleigh|date=March 25, 2002|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|people=[[Jonathan Hensleigh]]|trans-title=Audio Commentary}}</ref>\n\nIn the DVD audio commentary, screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh claims that this version was dropped because the studio thought it showed a more cruel and menacing side to McClane, a man who killed for revenge rather than in self-defense. The studio was also displeased with the lack of action in the scene, feeling that it did not fit as a \"climax\" and therefore chose to reshoot the finale as an action sequence at a significant monetary cost. Hensleigh's intention was to show that the events in New York and the subsequent repercussions had tilted McClane psychologically. This alternative ending, set some time after the film's main events, would have marked a serious break from the ''Die Hard'' formula, in which the plot unfolds over a period of roughly 12 hours.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\nAccording to the DVD audio commentary, a second alternative ending had McClane and Carver floating back to shore on a makeshift raft after the explosion at sea. Carver says it is a shame the bad guys are going to get away; McClane tells him not to be so sure. The scene then shifts to the plane where the terrorists find the briefcase bomb they left in the park and which Carver gave back to them (in this version it was not used to blow up the dam). The film would end on a darkly comic note as Simon asks if anyone has a four-gallon jug. This draft of the script was rejected early on \u2013 possibly due to the similarity of the ending to ''[[Die Hard 2]]'', where all the villains board a plane that later explodes \u2013 so it was never actually filmed. The rocket-launcher sequence was the only alternative ending to be filmed.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Die Hard with a Vengeance'' opened in the United States on May 19, 1995 and earned $22,162,245 in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3008333313/weekend/|title=Die Hard with a Vengeance - Weekend Grosses|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=June 11, 2020|archive-date=March 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308033813/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=diehardwithavengeance.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> In Japan, it set a record opening for 20th Century Fox with a five-day gross of $13.5 million, beating ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' and ranking [[List of 1995 box office number-one films in Japan|number one]] for five consecutive weeks, grossing over $81 million.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=12|date=10 July 1995|title=O'seas B.O. bows to big U.S. pix|last=Groves|first=Don}}</ref><ref name=France/><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=32|date=2 October 1995|title=O'seas auds boost B.O. of U.S. pix|last=Groves|first=Don}}</ref><ref name=\"BOM\"/> Its opening in France set a summer record with a gross of $8.8 million in its first 8 days.<ref name=France>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=10|date=14 August 1995|title=O'seas B.O. shimmers in August heat|first=Don|last=Groves}}</ref> The film went on to gross $100,012,499 in the United States and Canada, and $266,089,167 in other<!-- Using the word \"foreign\" in this case is like saying the USA is the only country in the world. --> markets, giving it a total worldwide gross of $366,101,666 and making it [[1995 in film#Highest-grossing films|the highest-grossing film of 1995]].<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/1995/?ref_=bo_cso_table_1|title=1995 Worldwide Box Office|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=March 7, 2020|archive-date=June 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200611115917/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/1995/?ref_=bo_cso_table_1|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 59% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 6.10/10.

The novel is written in [[Narration#Third-person, omniscient|third person omniscient]] and has a somewhat darker tone in comparison to the final film.\n\nThe novel provides a deeper exploration into McClane's psyche and shows how angry and broken he has become since leaving Holly and becoming an alcoholic. McClane's introduction is also different. In the film, McClane is first seen in the police van to Harlem while being briefed on what is going on. The novel includes a scene before this where Connie and Joe find McClane in his messy apartment.\n\nSimon's henchwoman Katya appears much later into the story than she does in the film. She is not involved in the Federal Reserve robbery and instead appears just before Simon and Targo take off in one of the dump trucks. Like the final film, she ends up killing Targo for Simon.\n\nThe original placement of the \"Yippee-Ki-Yay\" line is included. Instead of being used at the end, McClane uses the line when talking to Simon over the radios while in the aqueducts. This was meant to be in the same vein as the original use of the line in the first movie.\n\nZeus' original backstory is presented in the novel, explaining why he is looking after his nephews and why he hates white people. During the car chase, Zeus explains that his brother was killed during a drug raid. When McClane suggests that it was his brother's own fault, Zeus explains that his brother was never involved in drugs and the only reason he was there was to bring Zeus home.\n\nThe novel also uses the \"McClane Says\" ending rather than the film's version of the finale.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Film|United States|1990s}}\n{{wikiquote|Die Hard with a Vengeance}}\n* {{IMDb title|0112864|Die Hard with a Vengeance}}\n* {{tcmdb title|73104|Die Hard with a Vengeance}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{Allmovie title|134726|Die Hard with a Vengeance}}\n* {{AFI film|59875}}\n\n{{Die Hard}}\n{{John McTiernan}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Die Hard with a Vengeance}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s buddy cop films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s heist films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American buddy cop films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Cinergi Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Die Hard]]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the New York City Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films about the New York City Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John McTiernan]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Kamen]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Maryland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Films produced by John McTiernan]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
