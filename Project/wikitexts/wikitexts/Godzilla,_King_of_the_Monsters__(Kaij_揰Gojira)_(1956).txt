The film stars [[Raymond Burr]], [[Takashi Shimura]], [[Momoko K\u014dchi]], [[Akira Takarada]], and [[Akihiko Hirata]], with [[Haruo Nakajima]] and [[Katsumi Tezuka]] as [[Godzilla]]. In the film, an American reporter covers a giant reptilian monster's attack on Japan.\n\nIn 1955, Edmund Goldman acquired the 1954 film from Toho and enlisted the aid of Paul Schreibman, Harold Ross, [[Richard Kay (producer)|Richard Kay]], and [[Joseph E. Levine]] to produce a revised version for American audiences. This version [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] most of the Japanese dialogue into English, altered and removed key plot points and themes. New footage was produced with Burr interacting with body-doubles and Japanese-American actors in an attempt to make it seem like Burr was part of the original Japanese production.\n\n''Godzilla, King of the Monsters!'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 27, 1956, and was followed by an international release. The film was responsible for introducing Godzilla to a worldwide audience, as the 1954 film remained unavailable officially outside of Japan until 2004.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=106}}\n\n==Plot==\nInjured American reporter Steve Martin is brought from the ruins of Tokyo to a hospital filled with maimed and wounded citizens. A recent acquaintance, Emiko, discovers him by chance among the victims and attempts to find a doctor for him. Martin recalls in flashback stopping over in Tokyo, where a series of inexplicable offshore ship disasters catches his attention. When a victim of those disasters washes up on Odo Island, Martin flies there for the story, along with security officer Tomo Iwanaga. There he learns of the island inhabitants' long-held belief in a sea monster god known as \"[[Godzilla]]\", which they believe caused the ship disasters. That night, a heavy storm strikes the island, destroying houses and killing some villagers. The islanders believe that Godzilla was actually responsible for the destruction.\n\nMartin returns to the island with Dr. Yamane, who is leading a team to investigate the damage. Huge radioactive footprints and prehistoric [[trilobite]] are discovered. An alarm rings and Martin, the villagers, and Dr. Yamane's team head up a hill for safety. Near the summit, they encounter Godzilla, and they quickly flee downhill. Upon Dr. Yamane's later return to Tokyo, he deduces that Godzilla is {{convert|400.|ft}} tall and was resurrected by the repeated [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]] testing in the Pacific. To Yamane's dismay, the military responds by attempting to kill the monster using [[depth charge]]s. Martin contacts his old friend, Dr. Daisuke Serizawa, for dinner, but Serizawa declines due to a previous commitment with his fianc\u00e9e, Emiko, Dr. Yamane's daughter.\n\nEmiko goes to Serizawa's home to break off her arranged engagement with him because she is actually in love with Hideo Ogata, a salvage ship captain. Dr. Serizawa, however, gives her a demonstration of his secret project, which horrifies her. She is sworn to secrecy and unable to bring herself to break off the engagement. Godzilla surfaces from Tokyo Bay, unharmed by the depth charges, and attacks the city, destroying a train before returning to the bay. The next morning, the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF) supercharges the tall electrical towers along Tokyo's coast to repel the monster.\n\nGodzilla resurfaces that night and breaks through the electrical towers and JSDF defense line using his atomic heat breath. Martin documents Godzilla's rampage via tape recorder and is injured during the attack. Godzilla returns to the sea and the flashback ends. Martin wakes up in the hospital with Emiko and Ogata. Horrified by the destruction, Emiko reveals to them the existence of Dr. Serizawa's Oxygen Destroyer, which disintegrates oxygen atoms in saltwater and causes all marine organisms to die of acidic asphyxiation. Emiko and Ogata go to Dr. Serizawa to convince him to use his powerful weapon on Godzilla, but he initially refuses. After watching a television broadcast showing the nation's continuing plight, Serizawa finally gives in to their pleas.\n\nA ship takes Ogata, Serizawa, Yamane, Martin, and Emiko out to the deepest part of Tokyo Bay. In hardhat diving suits, Ogata and Serizawa are lowered down by lifelines near Godzilla to plant the weapon. Ogata is pulled up, but Serizawa delays his ascent and activates the device. He radios the surface of its success and wishes Emiko and Ogata happiness together. Serizawa cuts his lifelines, taking the secret of his invention to the grave. Godzilla succumbs to the Oxygen Destroyer, which dissolves its body and bones. All aboard the ship mourn the loss of Dr. Serizawa. Martin reflects that the world can \"live again\" due to Serizawa's ultimate sacrifice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Raymond Burr]] as Steve Martin\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Dr. Yamane\n* [[Momoko K\u014dchi]] as Emiko\n* [[Akira Takarada]] as Ogata \n* [[Akihiko Hirata]] as Dr. Serizawa\n* Sachio Sakai as Hagiwara\n* Fuyuki Murakami as Dr. Tabata\n* Ren Yamamoto as Seiji\n* Toyoaki Suzuki as Shinkichi\n* Tadashi Okabe as Dr. Tabata's Assistant\n* Toranosuke Ogawa as President of Company\n* Frank Iwanaga as Security Officer Tomo\n* [[Mikel Conrad]] as George Lawrence\n* [[James Hong]] as Ogata and Dr. Serizawa (English voices)\n*[[Sammee Tong]] as Dr. Yamane (English voice)\n* [[Haruo Nakajima]] as [[Godzilla]]\n* [[Katsumi Tezuka]] as Godzilla\n}}\nCast taken from ''Japan's Favorite Mon-star''.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=54}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=351}}\n\n==Production==\n===Crew===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Terry O.

Toho had shown Goldman advertising materials, which interested him in a screening of the film. Goldman then made Toho an offer of $25,000 for the theatrical and television rights, which they accepted quickly.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=52}} The contract was signed on September 27, 1955. The contract stipulated that Toho and Goldman agreed that the film would be \"narrated, dubbed in English and completed by the revisions, additions, and deletions,\" with final approval by Toho.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=51}}\n\nPaul Schreibman assisted in the film's acquisition.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=53}} [[Samuel Z.

According to Goldman, Ross and Kay's idea was to dub the film and hire Raymond Burr. Goldman would later sell his interest to Jewell Enterprises.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=52}}\n\nRoss and Kay turned to [[Joseph E. Levine]] to further finance the project. The duo arranged a screening of the film for Levine in Los Angeles. The film's possibilities excited Levine and paid $100,000 for half of the rights. This arrangement allowed the rights to ''Godzilla'' to be split between Jewell Enterprises and Levine's Embassy Pictures. Levine enlisted Edward Barison to create Trans World Releasing Corp., to distribute the film. Levine also enlisted producer Terry Turner to develop promotional strategies, which cost $400,000.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=52}}<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 5, 1987|page=4|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|author-link=Todd McCarthy|title=Joseph E.

Levine and Turner initially considered the title ''Godzilla, the Sea Beast'', but eventually settled on ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters''.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=53}} Ross and Kay hired [[Terry O. Morse]] to direct the film. Schreibman had arranged for Burr to participate in the film.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=53}} Morse was paid $10,000 for re-writing and directing the film and Burr was paid the same amount for a single day's work.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=54}}\n\n===Filming and dubbing===\nAlterations and new footage with Burr interacting with body doubles were produced to appeal to American audiences, as foreign films held no appeal to the mainstream public at the time.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=25}} Morse viewed the original Japanese cut, with an English translation of the script, to find key scenes in which Burr could be inserted.{{sfn|Kalat|2012|loc=00:08:47}} Rather than dub the entire film, Morse chose to retain most of the original Japanese dialogue and have Frank Iwanaga translate, albeit inaccurately, those scenes and alternate with Burr narrating. Burr worked with body-doubles, who were filmed over their shoulder to conceal their faces. Editing techniques were also used to mask the body doubles and the original Japanese actors. Asian-American extras were hired to play minor roles. The new footage was filmed in three days on a rented soundstage at Visual Drama Inc.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=54}} Since he was contracted for only one day, Burr was forced to work a 24-hour shift to shoot all his scenes.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=237-238}} Set decorator George Rohr provided mock-up sets that resembled the sets in the original Japanese cut.{{sfn|Kalat|2012|loc=00:09:36}} Overt references to the [[Nuclear weapon|atom bomb]] and [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]], such as the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Nagasaki]], the [[Nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll|Bikini Island tests]], [[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru|radioactive contamination of tuna]] by American and Russian bomb tests, were omitted.{{sfn|Kalat|2012|loc=00:22:12}}\n\nThe dubbing required for the entire film was recorded in under five hours. [[James Hong]] and the other voice actors have not given any details of the film's production. The voice actors were locked in a room with Morse and were told to read for every role. Each line was recorded at different speeds and the best one was chosen to match the footage. The voice actors never saw the film as they recorded their lines. The voice actors dubbed the entire film sitting at a table with a microphone before them.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=54}} Hong confirmed that several Japanese actors auditioned for the voice-over job. However, Hong and [[Sammee Tong]] were hired due to their versatility.

The poster would later be used for the cover of [[Fangoria]].]]\nIn 1977, Italian filmmaker [[Luigi Cozzi]] released to Italian theaters a further modified and [[Film colorization|colorized]] version of ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'', with a soundtrack that used a magnetic tape process similar to [[Sensurround]]. Though the Italian colorized version was released as ''Godzilla'', it is referred to by fans, and by Cozzi himself, as ''Cozzilla''. Cozzi coined that title as a pen name when he was writing for magazines, later adopting it as the production company name for re-releasing the film. According to Cozzi, Toho had licensed the colorized version to Turkey. Cozzi noted that his colorization was the first attempt ever done at colorizing a black-and-white feature.<ref name=\"Cozzilla\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2009/05/31/talking-cozzilla-an-interview-with-italian-godzilla-director-luigi-cozzi/|title=Talking COZZILLA: An Interview with Italian GODZILLA Director Luigi Cozzi|first=John|last=DeSentis|work=SciFi Japan|date=May 31, 2009|access-date=November 7, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108023002/http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2009/05/31/talking-cozzilla-an-interview-with-italian-godzilla-director-luigi-cozzi/}}</ref>\n\nDue to the success of the 1976 remake of ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'', Cozzi attempted to cash in on the film's success by re-releasing ''[[Gorgo (film)|Gorgo]]''. Cozzi, however, was unable to acquire the film because \"the King Brothers asked for too much money\". Cozzi then selected ''Godzilla'' as his second option. He originally intended to acquire the original 1954 film, but Toho was only able to provide negatives for the 1956 American version. Cozzi's regional distributors refused to release it after discovering that the film was in black-and-white, so he chose to colorize it to secure its release. Cozzi renegotiated with Toho, gaining their approval. Included in the new deal was that Toho retained sole ownership of the colorized negative. Cozzi had final approval over the stock footage, music, and colorization. At the time, theatrical films were required to run for 90 minutes. Therefore, Cozzi was forced to add stock footage to extend the film's runtime: <blockquote>\"The decision to insert extra footage was because the original film was 1 hour and 20 minutes. While this was the normal length in the fifties, a film to be shown theatrically had to run 1 hour and 30 minutes in the mid-seventies. So we were forced to add material to it to reach that length. Its final length was 1 hour and 45 minutes\".<ref name=\"Cozzilla\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe decision by Cozzi to specifically add real footage of death and destruction from war-time film reels was intentional. He wanted to give such an old feature an \"up-to-date and more violent look\". While editing the film, Cozzi was aware that certain stock footage did not match the Godzilla footage, but he chose to proceed anyway, feeling that the \"effect would have been stronger than the defects\". Additional footage was recycled from ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'' and ''[[The Day the Earth Caught Fire]]''. As tributes, Cozzi added brief clips from ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' and ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'', taken from his personal 16mm prints. He coined the term \"Spectrorama 70\" for advertising purposes, referring to the film's colorization and for a feeling of 70mm. Cozzi stated that it \"helped to give a 'bigger' look to my ''Godzilla'' theatrical re-release advertising materials\".<ref name=\"Cozzilla\"/>\n\nFor the soundtrack, Cozzi reprocessed the original 1956 soundtrack, turning it into a magnetic band eight-track stereophonic variation by adding new music and sound effects. Cozzi later added Sensurround effects and special giant loudspeakers to the theaters playing the film. Using the pseudonym \"Magnetic System\", [[Vince Tempera]] composed the film's additional score alongside [[Fabio Frizzi]] and [[:it:Franco Bixio|Franco Bixio]] using his personal electric piano. Cozzi hired Tempera after he expressed interest in collaborating on a project. Tempera, a fan of Godzilla, immediately accepted. Cozzi selected synth music because he wanted the score to give his version of the film a \"modern look\" and have audiences see the difference between the new scenes and the originals. During the film's opening weekend, Tempera's additional score was released as a 45 rpm record (it was later released as a 33 rpm LP).<ref name=\"Cozzilla\"/>\n\nCozzi hired Enzo Nistri to paint a new poster for Cozzi's colorized release (Nistri's poster was later used on the cover of ''[[Fangoria]]'' magazine). Cozzi hired Armando Valcauda to do the colorization of the film, while Alberto Moro, Cozzi's mentor, was hired to edit the film. It was colorized frame-by-frame using [[stop motion]] gel photography. The process took only three months, as they were in a rush to release the film. Valcauda did all the colorization himself, while Cozzi edited the film with Moro. Cozzi noted that Yamato Video in Milan owns one new 35mm print of the colorized version and an original colorized 35mm film negative, acquired from Toho. Yamato planned to release the original  1954 version, the 1956 American cut, and the 1977 Italian color cut on DVD. Those plans, however, were abandoned after the DVD release of the 1954 film flopped financially.<ref name=\"Cozzilla\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nWhile the 1954 film is credited for starting the franchise and establishing the template for ''[[tokusatsu]]'' filmmaking,<ref name=\"toku\">{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/06/12/general/preserving-a-classic-japanese-art-form-tokusatsu-magic/#.Wm0hhraZMk8|title=Preserving a classic Japanese art form: tokusatsu magic|last=Kelts|first=Roland|work=The Japan Times|date=June 12, 2013|access-date=January 27, 2018}}</ref> ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters!'' was responsible for introducing international audiences to the character of Godzilla.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=51}} The Japanese version was unavailable overseas until 2004, when it was given a limited theatrical run in North America to commemorate the franchise's 50th anniversary.<ref name=\"Rialto 2004\">{{cite web|url=https://www.scifijapan.com/godzilla-toho/godzilla-50th-anniversary-pressbook|title=Godzilla 50th Anniversary Pressbook|last1=Ryfle|first1=Steve|last2=Goldstein|first2=Bruce|work=SciFi Japan|date=December 6, 2007|access-date=April 6, 2018}}</ref> In 1982, a subtitled version of the Japanese cut was screened at New York and Chicago film festivals honoring [[Takeshi Shimura]]'s work.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=55}}\n\nAfter the release of the 1956 American version, Toho adopted the moniker \"King of the Monsters\" in publicity materials.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=29}} The moniker was used as the title for the [[Godzilla: King of the Monsters in 3D|1983 unproduced American film]]{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=152-153}} and as the title for [[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Legendary's ''Godzilla'' sequel]].<ref name=\"SVPs\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/12/legendary-hires-herbert-w-gains-evp-physical-production-svp-valerie-flueger-veras-sara-flamm-1201870723/|title=Legendary Taps Herbert W.
