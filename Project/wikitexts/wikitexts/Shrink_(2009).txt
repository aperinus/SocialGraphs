Carter lives in a large, luxurious house overlooking the [[Hollywood Hills]] and has published a hugely successful [[self-help book]]. However, he is disheveled and lives alone in his large house. He smokes [[marijuana]] at home, in his car and behind his office, when not seeing patients. Carter routinely drinks himself to sleep around his house, waking up in his clothes and never enters his bedroom. Despite his own problems, Carter continues psychotherapy with his patients, maintaining his incisiveness, compassion and strong [[doctor-patient relationship]]s.\n\nAround some of Carter's patients, Patrick ([[Dallas Roberts]]) is a high-powered [[talent agent]] who is both [[narcissistic]] and anxiety- ridden, with a germ phobia, Seamus ([[Jack Huston]]) is an actor addicted to various drugs and alcohol, and one of Patrick's biggest clients, Seamus is not one of Carter's patients, but they share a drug-dealer named Jesus ([[Jesse Plemons]]). Jack Holden ([[Robin Williams]]) is another popular celebrity with a drinking problem, about which he is in denial. He continues therapy, however, because he believes that he has a sex addiction. Kate ([[Saffron Burrows]]) is an actress in her thirties, who is intelligent, compassionate and poised, but is facing fewer career opportunities because of Patrick's notion that her age is a limitation. Her rock-star husband, who she says \"wasn't always like this,\" is self-centered and cheating on her. Carter's newest patient, Jemma ([[Keke Palmer]]) is a troubled high-school student, who is required to see a therapist by her school, after cutting her hand by punching a mirror. She is referred to Carter by his father as a pro bono case because like Carter's wife, Jemma's mother died by suicide. Jemma is an avid moviegoer who aspires to become a filmmaker.\n\nCarter has few friends, and spends time with Jesus, his quirky pot dealer. Carter also socializes with Jeremy ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]) to whom he is loosely related through Carter's deceased wife, whose mother was Jeremy's godmother. Jeremy is a struggling young screenwriter who finds romantic interest in Patrick's assistant Daisy ([[Pell James]]). Jeremy also derives creative inspiration from Jemma. Jeremy secretly steals Jemma's private file from Carter's office and pursues a [[Platonic love|platonic]] interest in Jemma. He writes his breakthrough [[screenplay]] about Jemma, and with Daisy's help, Jeremy succeeds in gaining Patrick's interest in the screenplay.\n\nCarter suffers a breakdown on a live television talk show, alarming the host ([[Gore Vidal]]) and the viewers when he states publicly for the first time that his wife died by suicide. He denounces his book as \"bullshit\" and himself as a fraud, and storms off of the set. Jemma, Daisy and Jeremy react to Carter's on-air outburst. Carter decides to stop treating Jemma, though he begins helping Jemma finally come to terms with her mother's suicide.\n\nJemma discovers the screenplay and feels betrayed by Jeremy. Carter angrily attacks Jeremy for his deception, but accepts his own professional responsibility in the situation, which he unknowingly allowed. Later, Carter and Jeremy are mysteriously invited to a meeting at Patrick's office. Patrick seats them in a conference room, where Jemma is already waiting. To their surprise, Jemma now approves of Jeremy's screenplay. Patrick announces that he will be representing Jemma and making Jeremy's screenplay into a movie. Carter, having disposed of his drug supply, approaches Kate at home. He tells her he doesn't want to see her anymore \"...professionally,\" implying his interest in seeing her romantically. She smiles.\n\nThat night, Carter enters his bedroom, wearing pajamas. He momentarily regards his former marital bed, before climbing into it and turning off the light.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Dr. Henry Carter\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as Kate Amberson\n* [[Keke Palmer]] as Jemma\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as Jeremy\n* [[Jack Huston]] as Shamus\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Dr. Robert Carter, Henry's father\n* [[Pell James]] as Daisy\n* [[Jesse Plemons]] as Jesus, Carter's pot dealer\n* [[Sierra Aylina McClain]] as Carina\n* [[Dallas Roberts]] as Patrick\n* [[Ashley Greene]] as Missy\n* [[Laura Ramsey]] as Kiera\n* [[Gore Vidal]] as George Charles\n* [[Jillian Armenante]] as writer in Patrick's writer's room\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Jack Holden (uncredited)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1247692|Shrink}}\n* ''[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10011435-shrink/ Shrink]'' at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n* ''[https://www.allmovie.com/work/shrink-477598 Shrink]'' at [[Allmovie]]\n* ''[https://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/shrink Shrink]'' at [[Metacritic]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shrink}}\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2009 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films about psychiatry]]\n[[Category:American films about cannabis]]\n[[Category:Roadside Attractions films]]\n[[Category:2009 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2009 drama films]]\n[[Category:2009 independent films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jonas Pate]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
