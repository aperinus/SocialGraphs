Although Stephen is intelligent, his friends and professors are concerned about his lack of a thesis topic. After he and his professor [[Dennis W. Sciama|Dennis Sciama]] attend a lecture on [[black hole]]s, Stephen speculates that black holes may have been part of the creation of the universe, and decides to write his thesis on them. However, Stephen's muscles begin to fail, giving him decreasing coordination with his body. He learns he has [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|motor neuron disease]], which will eventually leave him unable to move, swallow, and even breathe. There are no treatments, and he has approximately two years to live. The doctor assures Stephen that his brain will not be affected, so his thoughts and intelligence will remain intact, but eventually, he will be unable to communicate them. As Stephen becomes reclusive, focusing on his work, Jane confesses she loves him. She tells his father she intends to stay with Stephen even as his condition worsens. They marry and have their first son, Robert.\n\nStephen presents his thesis to the examination board, arguing that a black hole created the universe in a [[Big Bang]], that it will emit [[Hawking radiation|heat]], and end in a [[Big Crunch]]. He begins using a wheelchair after his walking ability deteriorates. After the Hawkings have their daughter [[Lucy Hawking|Lucy]], Stephen develops a theory about the visibility of black holes and becomes a world-renowned physicist. Jane, focusing on the children as well as Stephen's health and increasing fame, is unable to work on her own thesis and becomes frustrated. Stephen tells her he will understand if she needs help. She joins a church choir, where she meets widower Jonathan and they become close friends. She employs him as a piano teacher for Robert, and Jonathan befriends the entire family, helping Stephen with his illness, supporting Jane, and playing with the children. When Jane gives birth to another son, Timothy, Stephen's mother asks Jane if the baby is Jonathan's, which she denies. Jonathan is appalled, but when he and Jane are alone, they admit their feelings for one another. He distances himself from the family, but Stephen tells him Jane needs him.\n\nWhile attending an opera performance in [[Bordeaux]], Stephen is taken ill and rushed to a hospital. The doctor informs Jane that he has [[pneumonia]], and that he needs a [[tracheotomy]] to survive, but it will leave him mute. She agrees to the surgery. Stephen learns to use a [[partner-assisted scanning|spelling board]], and uses it to communicate with Elaine, his new nurse. He receives a computer with a built-in [[speech synthesis|voice synthesizer]], and uses it to write a book, ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' (1988), which becomes an international best-seller. Stephen tells Jane he has been invited to the United States to accept an award and will be taking Elaine with him. Jane faces the realization that the marriage has not been working, telling him she \"did her best\", and they agree to divorce. Stephen goes to the lecture with Elaine, the two have fallen in love, and Jane and Jonathan reunite. At the lecture, Stephen sees a student drop a pen; he imagines getting up to return it, almost crying at the reminder of how his disease has affected him. He goes on to give a speech telling audiences to pursue their ambitions despite the harsh reality of life: \"While there's life, there is hope\".\n\nStephen invites Jane to meet [[Queen Elizabeth II]] with him when being made a member of the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]]; they share a happy day together with their children. An extended closing series comprises select moments from the film; shown in reverse, back to the moment Stephen first saw Jane; the reversal is reminiscent of Stephen's research methodology of reversing time to understand the beginning of the universe. Later, Jane and Jonathan marry, and she completes her [[Doctor of Philosophy]]. She and Stephen remain close friends. Stephen declines a knighthood from the Queen and continues his research, with no plans to retire in the near future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Eddie Redmayne]]<ref name=BBFC /><ref name=WorkingTitleFilms118>{{cite web|title=The Theory of Everything |url=https://www.workingtitlefilms.com/films/view/film/118 |website=WorkingTitleFilms.com |publisher=[[Working Title Films]] |access-date=6 October 2017}}</ref> as [[Stephen Hawking]]<ref name=WorkingTitleFilms225>{{cite news|title=The Theory of Everything begins principal photography|url=https://www.WorkingTitleFilms.com/news/view/post/225|date=8 October 2013|publisher=[[Working Title Films]]|access-date=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906222953/https://www.workingtitlefilms.com/news/view/post/225|archive-date=6 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Felicity Jones]]<ref name=WorkingTitleFilms118 /> as [[Jane Hawking]]<ref name=WorkingTitleFilms225/>\n* [[Charlie Cox]] as Jonathan Jones<ref name=WorkingTitleFilms225/>\n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Dennis W.

Writing for the film blog of UK daily newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', Michelle Dean noted: {{blockquote|''The Theory of Everything''{{'}}s marketing materials will tell you it is based on Jane Hawking's memoir of her marriage, a book published in the UK as ''Music to Move the Stars'', and then re-issued as ''Travelling to Infinity''. But the screenwriters rearranged the facts to suit certain dramatic conventions. And while that always happens in these based-on-a-true-story films, the scale of the departure in ''The Theory of Everything'' is unusually wide. The film becomes almost dishonest{{endash}}in a way that feels unfair to both parties, and oddly, particularly Jane Hawking herself.<ref name=GuardianDisservice>{{cite web |url=https://www.TheGuardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/14/theory-of-everything-movie-jane-steven-hawking-memoir|title=The Theory of Everything does Jane Hawking a disservice |last=Dean |first=Michelle |date=14 November 2014 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=19 November 2016}}</ref>}} In ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', L.V.

Of course that didn't actually happen either. Jane's book describes a protracted breakup that comes to a head in a screaming fight on vacation. She also described devastation when Hawking announced by letter he was leaving her for his second wife, Elaine Mason. He ended up married to Mason for 10 years before that fell apart, and then he and Jane mended fences. Which, as it happens, the movie fudges too. It tries to present the rapprochement as coming when Hawking was made a Companion of Honour in 1989, but that actually happened before the couple separated.<ref name=GuardianDisservice/>}}\n\nPhysicist [[Adrian Melott]], a former student of [[Dennis W.
