The special debuted alongside ''[[A Garfield Christmas]]'' and the two continued to be aired back to back in subsequent years.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe special is co-hosted by Rex (Johnny Counterfit), an erudite ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', and Herb (Tim Conner), a dimwitted and [[bespectacled]] ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' with a gluttonous appetite. The two appeared in previous Will Vinton videos dating back to 1980 including ''[[Dinosaur (1980 film)|Dinosaur]]'', but this Christmas special is the first in which they have dialogue and contemporary personalities, vaguely parodying [[Siskel and Ebert]] respectively. \n\nSituated in a facsimile of [[London]]'s Christmas Square, Rex and Herb introduce several stand-alone videos of [[Christmas carol]]s and holiday standards and discuss the origins of each song relating to different holiday traditions around the world.\n\nAmong the musical performances:\n* The [[Biblical magi]] sing the verses of \"[[We Three Kings]]\" traditionally, while their camels sing the chorus in the style of [[doo-wop]].\n*At [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], The Paris Bell-Harmonic, a group of [[anthropomorphic]] church bells who strike their own heads with chime hammers to achieve their respective notes, performs \"[[Shchedryk (song)|Carol of the Bells]].\" The low C bell (the tonic) constantly dawdles and chimes out of tune, enraging the [[maestro]], [[Quasimodo]], who uses a [[slingshot]] on the bell to get the proper tone at the end.\n* A children's choir sings \"[[O Christmas Tree]]\", with the video depicting various scenes taking place inside of [[Christmas ornaments]]\n* \"[[Angels We Have Heard On High]]\" is set to a [[walrus]] couple doing an interpretive [[Ice dancing|ice ballet]] while several luckless [[penguin]]s watch.\n* At a [[black church]] in the countryside, a [[soul music|soul]]/[[jazz]] hybrid rendition of \"[[Joy to the World]]\" plays out in colorful scenes. (This segment, using stylized, flat animation resembling paintings and [[stained glass window]]s, is the only segment not rendered in Vinton's trademark Claymation.) \n* The [[California Raisins]] perform a [[cover version|cover]] of the Temptations' version of \"[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]],\".\n\nThroughout the program, Rex futilely attempts to clarify the true pronunciation and meaning of the term \"wassail', featured in the Christmas carol \"[[Here We Come A-Wassailing]]\".  As the show progresses, Rex is accosted by different groups, all singing lyrically incorrect versions of the song.\n\n* \"Here We Come A-Waffling\", by a kennel of dogs selling waffles from a vendor's wagon.\n* \"Here We Come A-Waddling\", by a gaggle of straggling geese carrying baskets of goodies.\n* \"Here We Come A-Wallowing\", by a herd of slovenly pigs on a [[Deere & Company|John Deere]]-style field wagon gorging themselves on an abundance of assorted fruits.\n\nRex is convinced that his own pronunciation is correct, but he is continually questioned by the others including Herb when he is not busy excessively partaking of the various Christmas treats offered by each group; consulting the dictionary provides no meaningful help.  Finally, near the program's end, a large truck loaded with [[cider]]-swilling Irish elves arrives in Christmas Square singing the correct version of the carol, validating Rex's theory much to his delight. When asked, one of the townies explains the real meaning of wassailing: going around the neighborhood singing Christmas carols, and getting treats and cordials. \n\nAt the end, the entire cast performs \"Here We Come A-Wassailing\", and then \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\" as the end credits roll.\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://library.state.or.us/repository/2015/201505210910074/2015.pdf\n | title=Filmed in Oregon 1908-2015\n | work=Oregon Film Council\n | publisher=Oregon State Library\n | accessdate=December 27, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n1988\u2014[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]] given to [[Will Vinton]] (executive producer/director), David Altschul (producer) and Ralph Liddle (writer)\n\n==Soundtrack & Video==\nA companion soundtrack album was released by Atlantic Records in 1988 and was originally available on LP, cassette, and compact disc.
