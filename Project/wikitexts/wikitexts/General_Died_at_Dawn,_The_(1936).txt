The movie was written by Charles G. Booth and Clifford Odets, and directed by Lewis Milestone.<ref>Paramount Pictures music cue sheet.</ref>\n\nIt stars Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll, Akim Tamiroff, and [[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]].  Director Milestone has a [[cameo role]].\n\nThe movie was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]] (Akim Tamiroff), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music, Score]]. There are several scenes in the film that show startling originality at the time. At one point, the camera focuses on a white door knob, and then dissolves to a white [[billiard ball]] to connect disparate scenes. In another scene, two characters have a conversation in which they speculate about the fates of other characters in the drama. The answers to their questions appear in screen segments in the corners of the screen, marking an unusual use of split screen to join narrative.\n\nThe main character, O'Hara, is based on the real-life Anglo-Canadian Jewish adventurer [[Morris Cohen (adventurer)|Morris Abraham \"Two-Gun\" Cohen]]. During the early 1930s, Cohen ran guns for various warlords in mainland China.\n\nThis is reported to be the first film to use [[foam latex]] prosthetics.  Makeup artist [[Charles Gemora]] applied sponge rubber eyelids for one of the actors.\n\nJohn Howard Reid called it one of the fifty finest films Hollywood ever made.<ref>{{Cite book |first=John Howard |last=Reid |year=2012 |title=50 of the Finest Films Hollywood Ever Made |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJO7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA38 |location=Raleigh, NC |publisher=Lulu.com |pages=38\u201339 |isbn=9781105758966 |oclc=934849010}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as O'Hara \n* [[Madeleine Carroll]] as Judy Perrie\n* [[Akim Tamiroff]] as General Yang\n* [[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]] as Mr. Wu\n* [[Porter Hall]] as Peter Perrie/Peter Martin\n* [[William Frawley]] as Brighton\n* [[J.M.

Greene noted that it was \"a melodrama of more than usual skill\", but criticized the end of the film and suggested that [[sine qua non|but-for]] the \"rather ludicrous ending, this would have been one of the best '[[Thriller film|thriller]]s' for some years\".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Greene|first= Graham|author-link= Graham Greene|date= 30 October 1936|title= La Kermesse H\u00e9ro\u00efque/The General Died at Dawn|journal= [[The Spectator]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book |editor-last= Taylor|editor-first= John Russell |editor-link= John Russell Taylor|date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|url=https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree|url-access= registration|pages= [https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/112 112-113]|isbn=0192812866}})</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 1938 an animated cartoon, called ''The Major Lied Till Dawn'', was produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]]. In it, a major tells tall tales about his hunting adventures to a boy who resembles [[Freddie Bartholomew]]. The character of the major may have been influenced by [[Colonel Heeza Liar]].\n\nA third-season episode of the TV show ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' was entitled \"[[The General Flipped at Dawn]]\" (broadcast September 10, 1974). In the episode, [[Harry Morgan]] appears as Major General Bartford Hamilton Steele, a batty general who is convinced that the [[4077th]] needs to move closer to the front lines, to be near the action. (Morgan formally joined the cast of ''M*A*S*H'' in Season Four as the much-saner [[Colonel Sherman T. Potter]].)\n\n''[[The General Danced at Dawn]]'' is a collection of short stories by [[George MacDonald Fraser]] first published in 1970.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0027664|The General Died at Dawn}}\n* {{Amg movie|19343|The General Died at Dawn}}\n* [https://archive.org/download/Escape19491950/esca.49.04.16_The_General_Died_at_Dawn.mp3 ''The General Died at Dawn''] on ''[[Escape (radio program)|Escape]]'': April 16, 1949  \n \n{{Lewis Milestone}}\n{{Clifford Odets}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:General Died at Dawn, The}}\n[[Category:1936 films]]\n[[Category:1930s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:American adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lewis Milestone]]\n[[Category:Films set in China]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American war films]]\n[[Category:Films about mercenaries]]\n[[Category:1936 war films]]\n[[Category:1936 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Werner Janssen]]\n[[Category:1930s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1930s American films]]"}]}}}}
