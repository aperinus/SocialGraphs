McGinley]], [[Guy Torry]], and [[Ed Asner|Edward Asner]]. The film depicts a police station evidence clerk who is critically injured and is put back together by a mad scientist who transplants animal parts, resulting in strange changes to his behavior.\n\nThe film received negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the town of Elkerton, Marvin Mange is an awkward, clumsy nice-guy who dreams of being a police officer like his dad was. He continuously fails the physical test to become a full-fledged police officer, is mistreated by sleazy police sergeant Doug Sisk, and he awkwardly fumbles through a first encounter with his idol, environmental protester Rianna. He works in the police station as an evidence clerk and is friends with airport security guard Miles who is a victim of \"reverse racism\" and fellow cadet Fatty. While alone at the station, he receives a robbery call from a restaurant. He takes the call and drives off the road, tumbling down a mountain. A boulder falls on the car.\n\nDays later, Marvin returns to his normal life with no memory of what happened. He is full of life while not noticing surgical marks on his back and fur on his rear end. He can outrun [[horse]]s, mean dogs are scared of him, he jumps to catch frisbees in his mouth, and he does not need his asthma medicine. He thinks it is due to his consumption of \"Badger Milk\", which is guaranteed in the ads to make him stronger.\n\nHe goes to the airport to talk to Miles about his problem. While there, Marvin sniffs out a man hiding heroin in his rectum. Marvin is declared a hero and is made a full-fledged police officer by Chief Marion Wilson.\n\nMarvin often wakes up in strange places, and subsequently hears about animal attacks that occurred in the middle of the night. Because of these attacks, the mad scientist Dr. Wilder believes that Marvin is out of control. Wilder takes him to his laboratory, and explains about the grafts and transplants that saved Marvin's life and gave him animal powers. He gives him pointers on controlling the rampant animal urges that often prompt him to behave inappropriately in public.\n\nDespite continuing embarrassments caused by Marvin's animal urges, his animal abilities allow him to excel as a police officer. He is partnered with Sisk, and gets a date with Rianna.\n\nChief Wilson questions Marvin about late-night attacks on cows because one of the witnesses made a police sketch and it looks like Marvin. Chief Wilson puts Marvin on paid leave.\n\nRianna goes to Marvin's house, where he has barricaded himself inside. She is convinced that he cannot be behind the animal attacks. They spend the night together. Marvin insists on being tied up so he cannot hurt anyone, but Rianna unties him after he falls asleep. The police show up to arrest Marvin for an attack on a hunter that night. Rianna convinces him to run. Marvin escapes to the woods. The police organize a search party to capture Marvin. While running through the woods, Marvin finds Wilder. The scientist tells him that another patient of his is out of control.\n\nSgt. Sisk confronts Marvin and is about to shoot him. Rianna jumps from a tree onto Sisk. In the presence of Wilder, Miles, and Fatty, she confesses that she was also operated on by Wilder and attacked the hunter in order to protect the [[turkey vulture]] that she released into the wild. An angry mob and police arrive to take out Marvin. Miles takes the blame for everything. Once the mob thinks a black man was responsible, the mob members don't want to take action causing Chief Wilson to call off the hunt much to the dismay of Miles.\n\nOne year later, Marvin and Rianna get married, open an animal sanctuary, and have a litter of children. While watching television, they see Dr. Wilder win the [[Nobel Prize]]. He says he owes it all to his fianc\u00e9e Yolanda, the spokesmodel for Badger Milk. There are large scars on her back, implying that Wilder performed the experiment on her as well.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Marvin Mange, a police evidence clerk who gets animal parts put in him.\n* [[Colleen Haskell]] as Rianna \"Hummingbird\" Holmes, an animal activist who Mange falls for.\n* [[John C.

At the time, Sony claimed that the error was due to a layout artist who entered 'dummy text' into print advertisements during their design, which was accidentally never replaced with real text.<ref>{{cite web\n| url          = http://www.bamlawca.com/pdf/sonynot.pdf\n| title        = Official court notice of David Manning settlement\n| access-date  = 2010-11-23\n| url-status     = dead\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090206042739/http://bamlawca.com/pdf/sonynot.pdf\n| archive-date = 2009-02-06\n}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\nIn October 2022, it was announced a sequel is in development.
