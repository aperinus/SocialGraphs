It is loosely based on the play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] and features the voices of [[James McAvoy]], [[Emily Blunt]], [[Michael Caine]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Maggie Smith]], [[Ashley Jensen]], [[Stephen Merchant]], [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]], [[Jim Cummings]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]], [[Patrick Stewart]], and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. The story follows Gnomeo and Juliet, a pair of garden gnomes who fall in love, but due to the feud between their respective families, they must find a way to keep their blossoming romance a secret.\n\n''Gnomeo & Juliet'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] on January 23, 2011, and was theatrically released on February 11 by [[Entertainment One|Entertainment One Films]] in the United Kingdom<ref name=\"BBFCGnomeo2D\" /> and [[Touchstone Pictures]] in the United States. The film grossed $193 million worldwide and received nominations for several [[Annie Award]]s. The song \"Hello Hello\" by [[Elton John]] and [[Lady Gaga]] was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], the [[Satellite Award]] for [[Satellite Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], and the [[Critics' Choice Movie Award]] for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song|Best Song]]. A sequel, ''[[Sherlock Gnomes]]'', was released in 2018 by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], elderly neighbours Miss Montague and Mr. Capulet despise each other. When they leave their respective gardens, their [[garden gnome]]s and other lawn ornaments come to life. The Montague garden is filled with blue-hatted gnomes led by Lady Bluebury, and the Capulet garden is filled with red-hatted gnomes led by Lord Redbrick, who share in their owners\u2019 feud. In a back-alley lawnmower race, Lady Bluebury's son Gnomeo competes against his Red rival Tybalt, who destroys Gnomeo's lawn mower. That night, Gnomeo and his best friend Benny infiltrate the red garden in disguise and vandalize Tybalt's mower, but Benny instead vandalizes Tybalt's pedestal and accidentally triggers a security light. During their escape, Gnomeo ends up in an abandoned garden nearby and bumps into a disguised Juliet, daughter of Lord Redbrick, who dislikes her father's overprotective nature and is attempting to retrieve a unique Cupid's Arrow [[orchid]] from the roof of the greenhouse. The two are enthralled by each other and a flirty fight for the flower ensues, culminating in the pair falling into a pond and discovering each other\u2019s colors. Shocked, Juliet flees home and tells her frog-sprinkler friend Nanette about her newfound love. Nanette declares it romantically tragic but agrees to keep it a secret.\n\nGnomeo and Juliet continue to meet secretly in the nearby garden, where they encounter a pink [[plastic flamingo]] named Featherstone who encourages their love. Lord Redbrick pairs Juliet with a Red gnome named Paris, but Juliet distracts him with Nanette, who quickly falls for him. Lady Bluebury is distraught after the Reds infiltrate the garden and destroy the plant nurtured by Gnomeo's late father in retaliation for Gnomeo's earlier actions. The Blues urge Gnomeo to take revenge on the Reds, and he is about to spray their prized tulips with [[insecticide]] when Juliet sees him and he backs out upon seeing her upset with his actions. At their next meeting, Gnomeo and Juliet argue until Featherstone tells them about how he lost his own love when the couple living in the garden's house broke up and they each took a flamingo.<ref>In ''[[Sherlock Gnomes]]'', the couple are said to be a younger Miss Montague and Mr. Capulet, who reconcile between the events of the two films.</ref>\n\nBenny sees them and runs into the alleyway, unaware that Tybalt (who wants revenge for his pedestal being vandalized) is waiting with his lawnmower; he attempts to run Benny down, but Gnomeo intervenes. They fight until the lawnmower runs into the wall, shattering Tybalt. Blaming Gnomeo for the incident, the Reds attack him, who soon ends up in the road and a blue teapot falls from a passing truck, leading everyone to believe Gnomeo has been run over. Lord Redbrick takes Juliet back to the garden and has her feet glued to her tower for her own safety. Gnomeo's [[mushroom]] friend, Shroom, discovers that Gnomeo is still alive and being carried off by a dog to a nearby park. He and Featherstone reach the park, where Gnomeo climbs onto a statue of [[William Shakespeare]] and tells him his story. Shakespeare notes that Gnomeo's tale is similar to his own story of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and predicts that Gnomeo's will have a tragic ending as well.\n\nBenny uses Miss Montague's computer to order a powerful Terrafirminator lawnmower (falling in love with a porcelain doll in the process), seeking revenge on the Reds. The Terrafirminator arrives and initially works well, but goes out of control, destroying both gardens, and gets itself stuck while the gnomes wage a full-scale war. Gnomeo returns to Juliet with Featherstone's help, but the Terrafirminator frees itself. Gnomeo is unable to free Juliet but refuses to leave her, and they share a passionate kiss as the lawnmower crashes into the tower and self-destructs, seemingly killing them both. Realizing the consequences of their vendetta, Lady Blueberry and Lord Redbrick reconcile and end their feud. Gnomeo and Juliet emerge from the ruins unscathed as the two clans celebrate, in which Tybalt gets rebuilt and Featherstone gets his mate back. Everyone happily sees the couple off as they get married and drive away on a lawnmower.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Gnomeo, Lady Bluebury's son and Juliet's love interest.

Disney studio chairman [[Dick Cook]] greenlit the film, under the Disney-owned [[Miramax Films]]. Miramax was later sold by Disney in 2010, but the latter studio retained the rights to the film. [[Starz Animation]] produced and animated the film. After first sitting on the film as it was an animated film not by a Disney animation unit, Disney Studios then opted to release the film through its [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner.<ref>{{cite news |last= D'Alessandro |first= Anthony |title= Johnny Depp Lending His Voice To Paramount/MGM Sequel 'Sherlock Gnomes' |url= https://deadline.com/2015/11/johnny-depp-sherlock-gnomes-gnomeo-juliet-1201611396/ |access-date= November 7, 2015 |work= [[Deadline Hollywood]] |date= November 6, 2015 }}</ref> Australian director [[Adam Elliot]] was approached and asked to direct the film, but he rejected the offer due to the film's incompatibility with his style, as well as his lack of experience with CGI.<ref name=\"Adam Elliot Interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenwize.com/archives/712 |title=Interview with Adam Elliot, writer/director/designer of Mary and Max |publisher=Crickey.com.au |access-date=January 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022357/http://www.screenwize.com/archives/712 |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nAsbury got on board in 2006, and was attracted to the movie in order to work with [[Elton John]].<ref name=\"Cinemablendiv\">{{cite web|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Eric|title=Exclusive Interview: Gnomeo And Juliet Director Kelly Asbury|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Exclusive-Interview-Gnomeo-Juliet-Director-Kelly-Asbury-23117.html|website=Cinemablend|access-date=7 August 2017}}</ref> Asbury and Hamilton Shaw then rewrote the film \"sort of from scratch,\" <ref name=\"Cinemablendiv\"/> A particular challenge, according to Asbury was how to differentiate the ending between the original play and the movie in order to \"keep daggers and poison and suicide out\".<ref name=\"Cinemablendiv\"/> Asbury had free range of the casting and conducted the process only through listening to voices, not knowing which actor was auditioning until he felt they were right for the character.<ref name=\"Cinemablendiv\"/> Prior to the casting of [[James McAvoy]] and [[Emily Blunt]], the roles of Gnomeo and Juliet were originally to be voiced by [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Kate Winslet]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/moviereviews/a297245/gnomeo--juliet.html |title=Gnomeo & Juliet |website=Digital Spy |date=February 7, 2011 |access-date=February 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Gnomeo & Juliet (Original Soundtrack)\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Elton John]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{start date|2011|2|8}}\n| recorded   = 2008-2010\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Orchestral]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]]\n| length     = 60:24\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Buena Vista]]\n| producer   = [[Elton John]] and [[David Furnish]]\n| chronology = [[Elton John]]\n| prev_title = [[The Union (Elton John and Leon Russell album)|The Union]]\n| prev_year  = 2010\n| next_title = [[Good Morning to the Night]]\n| next_year  = 2012\n}}\n\n'''''Gnomeo & Juliet: Original Soundtrack''''' is the [[soundtrack album]] and was released by [[Walt Disney Records|Buena Vista Records]] on February 8, 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Buena Vista Records to Release Gnomeo & Juliet Original Soundtrack 2/8|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Buena-Vista-Records-to-Release-Gnomeo-Juliet-Original-Soundtrack-28-20110125|access-date=June 25, 2015|work=PR Newsire|date=January 25, 2011}}</ref> It features music by [[Elton John]] (who was also the film's executive producer), [[Nelly Furtado]], [[Kiki Dee]], and selections from the score composed by Chris P.
