After being banished along with his friend Lar ([[Dennis Quaid]]), Atouk falls in with a band of assorted misfits, among them the comely Tala ([[Shelley Long]]) and the elderly blind man Gog ([[Jack Gilford]]). The group has ongoing encounters with hungry [[dinosaur]]s, and rescues Lar from a \"nearby [[ice age]]\", where they encounter an [[Yeti|abominable snowman]]. In the course of these adventures they discover sedative drugs and fire, invent cooking, music, and weapons, and learn how to walk fully upright. Atouk uses these advances to lead an attack on Tonda, overthrowing him and becoming the tribe's new leader. He rejects Lana and takes Tala as his mate, and they live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ringo Starr]] as Atouk\n* [[Barbara Bach]] as Lana\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lar\n* [[Shelley Long]] as Tala\n* [[Jack Gilford]] as Gog\n* [[Cork Hubbert]] as Ta\n* Mark King as Ruck\n* Paco Morayta as Flok\n* [[Evan C.

Filming was mostly done in the [[Sierra de \u00d3rganos National Park]] in the town of [[Sombrerete]] in the state of [[Zacatecas]], [[Mexico]]. The river and fishing lake scene was shot in the Mexican state of [[Durango]], and some scenes were filmed at the [[Estudios Churubusco|Churubusco Studios]] in [[Mexico City]]. The film features [[stop motion]] animated [[dinosaur]]s constructed by [[Jim Danforth]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Pettigrew |first=Neil |title=The Stop-Motion Filmography |publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland & Company, Inc.]] |year=1999 |page=111 |isbn=0786404469}}</ref> including a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus Rex]]'' which in one scene becomes intoxicated by a [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-type drug, animated by [[Randall W. Cook]].<ref>Pettigrew, p. 114.</ref> Danforth was a major participant in the [[special effects]] sequences, but left the film \"about two-thirds of the way\" (his words) through the work because the [[Directors Guild of America]] prohibited his contracted on-screen credit, co-direction with Carl Gottlieb. Consequently, Danforth's name does not appear on the film.<ref>Pettigrew, p. 109.</ref>\n\nThe film's dialog is almost entirely in \"caveman\" language, such as:\n* \"alunda\" &ndash; love\n* \"bobo\" &ndash; friend\n* \"haraka\" &ndash; fire\n* \"macha\" &ndash; monster\n* \"aiyee\" &ndash; help\n* \"ya\" &ndash; yes\n* \"nya\" &ndash; no/not\n* \"ool\" &ndash; food\n* \"pooka\" &ndash; broken/pain\n* \"ugh\" &ndash; like\n* \"zug zug\" &ndash; sex/mate\n* \"kuda\" &ndash; come\n* \"caca\" &ndash; shit\n* \"guwi\" &ndash; out to get\n* \"gluglug\" &ndash; drowned\n\nAt some showings audiences were issued a translation [[pamphlet]] for 30 \"caveman words.\"<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082146/trivia/|title=Caveman (1981) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> The only English dialog present is used for comedic effect, when it is spoken by a caveman played by Evan Kim who speaks modern English but is understood by none of the other characters. Being a [[Koreans|Korean]] caveman, by speaking English, he appears to be more advanced than the rest. At her audition, Long said she did not speak any English, but responded to everything with grunts.<ref name=\"imdb.com\"/>\n\nBarbara Bach and Ringo Starr first met on the set of ''Caveman'', and they married just over a year later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barbara-bach.com/Byography.html|title=Barbara Bach - Biography -|website=www.barbara-bach.com}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on Region 1 DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on June 4, 2002.

The cast was \"interesting\", he wrote, but the main failing of ''Caveman'' was it being a spoof with \"no popular original material for it to satirize. There has never been a really successful movie set in prehistoric times.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/caveman-1981 |title=Caveman |date=January 1, 1981 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref> Ebert and [[Gene Siskel]] both gave the film a negative \"don't see it\" review on their TV show but softened their criticism somewhat by noting that its dinosaur-related sequences were amusing.<ref>{{cite AV media\n | people = [[Siskel and Ebert]]\n | title = Sneak Previews\n | type = Television\n | language = English\n | url = https://youtube.com/watch?v=-HGv81e1SiI\n}}</ref>\n\nJanet Maslin of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film was \"dopey, but it's also lots of fun\", and that the real star was the special-effects dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/17/movies/caveman-with-ringo-starr.html |title='Caveman' with Ringo Starr |first=Janet |last=Maslin |date=April 17, 1981 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref> [[Pauline Kael]] of [[The New Yorker]] gave it a positive review, calling it \"a funky, buoyant farce.\"<ref><!-- archive copy: https://www.geocities.ws/paulinekaelreviews/c2.html --> [[Taking It All In]]'' (1984) {{ISBN|0-03-069362-4}}</ref>\n\nGary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave it a mixed review. He was critical with the lack of originality but suggests younger audiences who have not seen it before may enjoy it. Arnold compares the film unfavorably to ''[[The Three Ages]]'', where [[Buster Keaton]] was able to bring his genius, ''Caveman'' struggles to overcome Starr's limits and director Gottlieb fails to make use of other talented actors such as Quaid, Schreiber, or Gilford.<ref>{{cite news |date=18 April 1981 |last=Arnold |first=Gary |title=Neanderthal Nonsense |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1981/04/18/neanderthal-nonsense/c6a55075-adda-4d0d-bc14-f5f073bad99e/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|id=cavemancavernicola1981|title=Caveman}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0082146|title=Caveman}}\n* {{Amg movie|8693|Caveman}}\n* [http://www.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/cavespeak.html Cavespeak: A Dictionary Of Cavese]\n\n[[Category:1981 animated films]]\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1980s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American slapstick comedy films]]\n[[Category:Mexican comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fictional-language films]]\n[[Category:Films using stop-motion animation]]\n[[Category:Estudios Churubusco films]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Carl Gottlieb]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Carl Gottlieb]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Lalo Schifrin]]\n[[Category:1981 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about Yeti]]\n[[Category:Films about cavemen]]\n[[Category:Films set in prehistory]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Rudy De Luca]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:1980s Mexican films]]"}]}}}}
