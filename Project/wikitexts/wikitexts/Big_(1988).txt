The film also stars [[Elizabeth Perkins]], [[David Moscow]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], and [[Robert Loggia]], and was written by [[Gary Ross]] and [[Anne Spielberg]]. It was produced by [[Gracie Films]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]].\n\nUpon release, ''Big'' was met with wide critical acclaim, particularly for Hanks' performance. It was a huge commercial success as well, grossing $151 million worldwide against a production budget of $18 million, and it proved to be pivotal to Hanks' career, establishing him as a major box-office draw as well as a critical favorite.<ref name=\"Tom Hanks biography\">{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/tom-hanks-9327661#big-break |title=Tom Hanks Biography |website=[[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (TV channel)|FYI]] / [[A&E Networks]]) |access-date=August 6, 2014}}</ref> The film received [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Hanks) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].\n\n== Plot ==\n{{anchor|zoltar}}\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nTwelve-year-old<!-- 12 at the beginning, 45 by the end; DO NOT CHANGE. At the beginning of the film, the milk carton says the date missing is 9/12/1987 and the date of birth is 1/20/75. Later in the film, Josh tells Susan he is 13, and Josh's mother says \"He had a birthday.\" Josh begins the film at age 12, then towards the end of the film is 13--> Josh Baskin is told that he is too short for a carnival ride called the [[Fire Ball|Super Loops]] while attempting to impress a girl. Dejected, he inserts a coin into an antique [[Fortune teller machine|fortune-teller machine]] called Zoltar, and makes a wish to be \"big\". It dispenses a card stating \"Your wish is granted\", but Josh discovers the machine has been unplugged the entire time.\n\nThe next morning, Josh finds that he has grown into an adult. He tries to locate the Zoltar machine but finds that the carnival has moved on. Returning home, he tries to explain his predicament to his mother, who chases him from the house thinking he is a stranger who has kidnapped her son. He then finds his best friend Billy and convinces him of his identity by reciting a rap that only they know. With Billy's help, he learns that it will take at least six weeks to find the Zoltar machine again, so Josh rents a [[flophouse]] in [[New York City]] and gets a job as a data entry clerk at the MacMillan Toy Company.\n\n[[File:2004-12-12 - New York (9).jpg|thumb|[[Walking Piano|The Walking Piano]], as featured in ''Big'']]\nJosh meets the company's owner, Mr. MacMillan, at [[FAO Schwarz]], and impresses him with his insight into current toys and his childlike enthusiasm. They play a duet (\"''[[Heart and Soul (Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael song)|Heart and Soul]]''\") on a [[Walking Piano]], and MacMillan invites Josh to a massive marketing campaign pitch meeting with senior executives. Unimpressed with the toy being pitched, Josh shocks and challenges the executives with a simple declaration that the toy is not \"fun\", and while his follow-up suggestions invigorate the team for new ideas, he earns the animosity of Paul Davenport, the pitch's leader. Meanwhile, a pleased MacMillan promotes Josh to Vice President of Product Development. He soon attracts the attention of Susan Lawrence, a fellow executive, and a romance begins to develop, much to the dismay of her former boyfriend, Davenport. Josh becomes increasingly entwined in his \"adult\" life by spending time with her, mingling with her friends, and being in a steady relationship. His ideas become valuable assets to MacMillan Toys; however, he begins to forget what it is like to be a child, and his tight schedule rarely allows him to spend time with Billy.\n \nMacMillan asks Josh to come up with proposals for a new line of toys. He is intimidated by the need to formulate the business aspects of the proposal, but Susan says that she will handle the business end while he comes up with the ideas. Nevertheless, he feels pressured and longs for his old life. When he expresses doubts to Susan and attempts to explain that he is a child, she interprets this as fear of commitment on his part and dismisses his explanation.\n \nJosh learns from Billy that the Zoltar machine is now at [[Playland (New York)|Sea Point Park]], and he leaves in the middle of his presentation to MacMillan and the other executives. Susan also leaves and encounters Billy, who tells her where Josh went. At the park, Josh finds the machine, unplugs it, and makes a wish to become \"a kid again\". He is then confronted by Susan for running off, but upon seeing the machine and the fortune it has given him, realizes that he was telling the truth, and she becomes despondent at realizing their relationship will end. He tells her that he enjoyed their time together and suggests that she use the machine to wish herself younger, though she declines and offers to take him home.\n\nAfter sharing an emotional goodbye with Susan, Josh transforms into a child again before reuniting with his family and Billy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Joshua \"Josh\" Baskin\n** [[David Moscow]] as Young Josh Baskin \n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Susan Lawrence\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Mr. MacMillan\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Paul Davenport\n* [[Jared Rushton]] as Billy Francis Kopecki\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Scotty Brennen\n* [[Mercedes Ruehl]] as Mrs. Baskin\n* [[Josh Clark]] as Mr. Baskin\n* Kimberlee M.

While there, a Zoltar fortune-telling machine from ''Big'' catches Jack's eye. Alyssa explains that it's an \"enchanted\" Zoltar machine that makes wishes come true. After Jack says he wishes to know his major, Alyssa quickly warns him that Zoltar is a \"bit of a trickster\" who \"grants your wishes ironically.\" The machine, which is among the artifacts stolen by the demon summoned by the Knights of the Saint Christopher, can be spotted in multiple episodes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/order-season-2-netflix-big-easter-egg-zoltar/ |title=The Order Season 2 Has A Big Movie Easter Egg |first=Nicholas |last=Raymond |date=July 5, 2020 |website=ScreenRant}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Little (film)|Little]]'' \u2013 A similar film\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Notelist}}\n{{Commons category|Big (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0094737}}\n* {{Amg title|5343}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|68599}}\n\n{{Penny Marshall}}\n{{Gracie Films}}\n\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:1980s coming-of-age comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age comedy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about size change]]\n[[Category:Films about wish fulfillment]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into plays]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Penny Marshall]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Musical or Comedy Actor Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films produced by James L.
