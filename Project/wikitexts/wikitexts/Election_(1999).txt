The film stars [[Matthew Broderick]] as Jim McAllister, a popular high school social studies teacher, and [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Tracy Flick]], an overachieving student whom he dislikes. When Tracy runs for student government president, McAllister sabotages her candidacy by backing a rival candidate and tampering with the ballot count.\n\nAlthough not a success at the box office, ''Election'' received widespread critical acclaim. The film received an [[Academy Award]]s nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for Witherspoon for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress]], and the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film]] in 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nJim McAllister teaches [[U.S. history]] and [[civics]] at a suburban [[Omaha, Nebraska]], high school. [[Tracy Flick]] is an overachieving senior and one of Jim's students. Jim's colleague and best friend Dave lost his job and his wife after engaging in a sexual relationship with Tracy. While Jim felt Dave needed to suffer the consequences, he resents Tracy for having emerged unscathed.\n\nAppalled by Tracy's unopposed run for [[student government president]], Jim persuades Paul Metzler, a popular football player, to enter the race. Paul is sidelined from football with a broken leg and finds his candidacy gives him purpose. It also infuriates Tracy, who resents Paul's popularity and [[Social class|privileged upbringing]].\n\nTammy Metzler, Paul's younger sister, is dumped by her girlfriend Lisa, who becomes Paul's girlfriend and [[campaign manager]]. Tammy exacts revenge by running for president on a nihilistic platform that student government is a sham. In her speech at a school assembly, she denounces the election and vows to dissolve student government if she wins. She rallies the students to a rowdy [[standing ovation]], but the principal retaliates by suspending her.\n\nTracy sees that one of her campaign posters has come unstuck from the wall. She tries to secure it but accidentally rips the poster apart. In a fit of rage, she destroys the other candidates' campaign posters and discards them in a [[dumpster]], unaware that Tammy sees her. The next day, Jim confronts Tracy with his suspicion that she removed the posters. Tracy feigns innocence and trades threats with Jim. She is saved by Tammy, who appears with the torn posters and claims responsibility. Tammy is expelled, her name is struck from the ballot, and her parents enroll her in a private [[Catholic school]] for girls, much to her delight.\n\nThe day before the election, Jim has a tryst with Linda, Dave's ex-wife. Linda asks Jim to rent a motel room for an afterschool rendezvous, but she fails to show. When Jim drives to Linda's house to find her, he is [[Bee sting|stung by a bee]] on his eyelid. He returns home to find Linda and his wife Diane talking. Knowing his encounter with Linda has been exposed, he spends the night in his car.\n\nJim oversees the tally of the [[ballot]]s, which finds Tracy winning by a single vote. He secretly disposes of two of Tracy's ballots, throwing the election to Paul. The ballots are later discovered, and Tracy becomes president. Jim elects to resign, and notes that the election rigging made headlines across the USA due to Internet rumors. Diane divorces Jim, taking the house and most of their joint assets. \n\nDivorced and humiliated, Jim moves to [[New York City]], becomes a tour guide at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and begins dating a new woman. Paul develops an active social life at the [[University of Nebraska]], though without Lisa, who dumps him. Tammy finds a new girlfriend at her all-girls school. Tracy attends Georgetown, only to be dismayed most of her classmates got admitted through sliding by on connections, considering it a rehash of high school. Tracy misses Dave's intellect and wonders if he became a novelist as she believed he would be; the film shows Dave working in a big box store.\n\nOn a visit to [[Washington, D.C.]], Jim spots Tracy getting into a limousine with a [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]]. Annoyed that she will go through life as she did at Carver, he hurls a cup of soda at the limo's backglass. The film ends with Jim working at the museum lecturing a group of elementary students, and an overeager little girl is the only one to respond. Jim reflects to himself that she reminds him of Tracy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Jim McAllister\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Tracy Flick|Tracy Enid Flick]]\n* [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] as Paul Metzler\n* [[Jessica Campbell]] as Tammy Metzler\n* [[Phil Reeves]] as Principal Walt Hendricks\n* [[Molly Hagan]] as Diane McAllister\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Judith Flick\n* [[Nicholas D'Agosto]] as Larry Fouch\n* Jeanine Jackson as Jo Metzler\n* Holmes Osborne as Dick Metzler\n* [[Mark Harelik]] as Dave Novotny\n* Delaney Driscoll as Linda Novotny\n* [[Matt Malloy]] as Vice Principal Ron Ball\n* [[Frankie Ingrassia]] as Lisa Flanagan\n* Pegi Georgeson as Ballot Lady\n}}\n\n==Production==\nProducers [[Albert Berger]] and [[Ron Yerxa]] sent director [[Alexander Payne]] an unpublished manuscript from novelist [[Tom Perrotta]] called \"Election\" in 1996. Payne was initially uninterested in directing a high school movie, but changed his mind after he read the manuscript. \"It was set in a [[High school in the United States|high school]], but it wasn\u2019t a high school story, per se. Also what attracted me was the formal exercise of doing a movie with multiple points of view and multiple voice-overs,\" said Payne.<ref name=\"huff-oral\" /> The [[Election (novel)|novel]]'s rights were sold to Payne in January 1997 and it was officially published in March 1998.\n\nThe novel was inspired by two key events. The first was the [[1992 United States presidential election]], in which [[Ross Perot]] entered as a third-party candidate (a move echoed by Tammy Metzler). The second was a 1992 incident at [[Memorial High School (Eau Claire, Wisconsin)|Memorial High School]] in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], in which a pregnant student was elected homecoming queen, but staff announced a different winner and burned the ballots to cover it up.<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|date=October 14, 1992|title=Officials Deny Pregnant Girl School Crown|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D71538F937A25753C1A964958260|access-date=May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news|last=Crace|first=John|date=February 21, 2009|title=A life in writing: Tom Perrotta|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/21/tom-perrotta-interview|access-date=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe film uses a number of stylized techniques in its storytelling, particularly through the use of freeze frames, flashbacks and voiceovers, which allow sections of the narrative to be delivered from the points of view of the four main characters.<ref name=\"variety-review\" />\n\nThe film was primarily shot on location around the [[Omaha\u2013Council Bluffs metropolitan area|Omaha metro area]] in the fall of 1997,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ingalls|first=Chris|date=9 February 2018|title=Like Real Life 'Election' Is Dark, Hilarious, and Cringe-worthy|url=https://www.popmatters.com/election-the-criterion-collection-2532526125.html|url-status=live|website=[[PopMatters]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209230331/https://www.popmatters.com/election-the-criterion-collection-2532526125.html |archive-date=February 9, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=26 November 1997|title=MTV's ELECTION|url=http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/306|url-status=live|website=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210205181925/http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/306 |archive-date=February 5, 2021 }}</ref> most notably in [[Papillion, Nebraska|Papillion]], [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]] and the [[Dundee\u2013Happy Hollow Historic District|Dundee neighborhood]].
