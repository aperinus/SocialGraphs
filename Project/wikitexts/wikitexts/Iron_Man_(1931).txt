Following his first winning streak, his wife returns to him. But fools her husband into hiring her lover as his new boxing manager, despite his lack of experience. \n\n==Plot==\nAfter lightweight prizefighter Kid Mason (Ayres) loses his opening fight, golddigging wife Rose (Harlow) leaves him for Hollywood. Without her around, Mason trains seriously and starts winning. Naturally, Rose returns and worms her way back into his life, despite the misgivings of manager George Regan (Armstrong). Eventually, she cons Mason into dumping Regan and replacing him with her secret lover Lewis (Miljan), even though he has almost no experience in the fight game. To make matters worse, Mason's high living and neglect of his training threatens his latest title defense.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lew Ayres]] as Kid Mason\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] as George Regan\n* [[Jean Harlow]] as Rose Mason\n* [[John Miljan]] as Paul H.
