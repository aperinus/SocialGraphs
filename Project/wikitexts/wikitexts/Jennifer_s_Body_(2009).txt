R. Magney State Park#The Devil's Kettle|Devil's Kettle]], [[Minnesota]], is now a violent mental inmate who narrates the story as a flashback while in [[solitary confinement]].\n\nSince childhood, Needy has been best friends with Jennifer Check, a popular cheerleader, despite the two having little in common. One night, Jennifer takes Needy to a local [[dive bar]] to attend a concert by [[indie rock]] band Low Shoulder. A fire engulfs the bar, killing several people. Jennifer leaves with the band. Later that evening, she appears in Needy's kitchen, covered in blood, and attempts to eat a [[rotisserie chicken]]. She immediately vomits a trail of black fluid and almost bites Needy's neck, but retreats and leaves.\n\nThe next morning at school, Jennifer appears fine and dismisses Needy's concerns, appearing apathetic to the fire tragedy. She seduces the school's football captain and [[Disembowelment|disembowels]] him. Meanwhile, Low Shoulder gains popularity due to their falsely rumored heroism during the fire, and offer to make a charity appearance at the school's spring formal.\n\nA month later, Jennifer appears sick and listless. She accepts a date with school [[Alternative fashion|alternative]]/[[Emo fashion|emo]] Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and her boyfriend Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. Jennifer visits Needy at home, and the two kiss. Jennifer explains that Low Shoulder had taken her into the woods after the bar fire and offered her as a virgin [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] to [[Satan]] in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice was a success, Jennifer was not actually a virgin, so she became permanently possessed. She became hungry and Ahmet, a foreign exchange student, who was thought to have died in the fire, was her first victim. She had intended to eat Needy as well, but left because she could not bring herself to hurt her best friend. When she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, healing instantly.\n\nNeedy goes to the school library's [[occult]] section and determines that Jennifer is a [[succubus]] who must feed on flesh and can only be killed while she is hungry and weak. Needy tells Chip about Jennifer. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him in order to protect him. Chip is intercepted by Jennifer on the way to the school dance. She takes him to an abandoned pool and begins feeding on him. Needy arrives and Chip impales Jennifer through the stomach with a pool skimmer. Jennifer escapes and Chip dies.\n\nAngry and heartbroken, Needy breaks into Jennifer's bedroom. The two fight and Jennifer bites Needy's neck in the struggle. Needy rips Jennifer's half of their best friend necklace off her neck. Jennifer stops fighting back and Needy stabs her in the heart with a [[utility knife]], killing her and destroying the demon. Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy on top of her dead daughter's body. Needy is brought to an [[Insane asylum|asylum]]. She now manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers due to the bite. She escapes the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride, telling the driver she is following a band.\n\nIn a credits scene, a home video and crime scene photos show that the members of Low Shoulder were murdered in their hotel by Needy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Megan Fox]] as Jennifer Check:\n: Fox was in negotiations to star as Jennifer Check since 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007.<ref>{{cite news | author= Mr. Disgusting | title= Megan Fox to Star in Supernatural-Comedy 'Jennifer's Body' | url= https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10237 | publisher= [[Bloody Disgusting]] | date= October 23, 2007 | access-date= February 11, 2008 | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081120203404/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10237 | archive-date= November 20, 2008 | df= mdy-all }}</ref> Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. \"I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times,\" she said. \"That was my favorite part about the script and about the character.

In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on [[Diablo Cody]]'s script and [[Karyn Kusama]]'s direction to pull it off, stating, \"I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with [[Middle America (United States)|middle America]].

''Jennifer's Body'' could play on both of these aspects.<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>\n\nCody said she wanted the film to speak to female empowerment and explore the complex relationships between best friends.<ref name=in.reuters.com/> \"(Director) Karyn Kusama and I are both outspoken [[Feminism|feminists]]\", she said. \"We wanted to subvert the classic horror model of women being terrorized. I want to write roles that service women. I want to tell stories from a female perspective. I want to create good parts for actresses where they're not just accessories to men.\"<ref name=in.reuters.com/> Addressing \"the male-dominated\" horror genre, Cody said \"a key reason for writing the film was to bring to the screen a new way of expressing the intensity of female bonds\" and that the adolescent female friendships she experienced were unparalleled in their intensity. She wanted to show the \"almost horrific\" aspect of such devotion and its relation to [[parasitism]].<ref name=in.reuters.com/>\n\nThe producers decided to have the film open with the statement \"Hell is a teenage girl\" to reflect the \"horrors\" of [[puberty]] and that \"the hellish emotions felt during high school often reappear as teenage girls mature into young women\".<ref name=in.reuters.com/> Cody stated:\n\n<blockquote>There's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing makeup on her face. I always thought that was such a sad image. She's so vulnerable. I don't know any woman who hasn't had a moment sitting in front of the mirror and thinking, 'Help me, I want to be somebody else.' What makes it extra affecting is that [Megan Fox] is stunning.<ref name=in.reuters.com/></blockquote>\n\nCody crafted the story to follow a night that ends in a tragic fire, after which Jennifer is kidnapped and set up as a sacrifice which goes awry. Jennifer, now possessed by a demon and subsequently altered into a [[succubus]], sets out on a bloody rampage in which she devours boys, and it is up to Needy to stop her. In sort of a reversal [[Menstrual cycle|aspect of how puberty changes a girl's life]], Jennifer must consume the blood of others once a month or she becomes weak and plain-looking.<ref name=\"www.msnbc.msn.com\">{{cite web|first=Alonso|last=Duralde|title='Jennifer's Body' fails at horror and comedy.

I was never an [[Alpha (biology)|Alpha female]], and I've never gotten off with bullying other people\", she said. \"If I had to choose, I was definitely the one being shoved, not the one shoving.\"<ref name=in.reuters.com/>\n\nThe nickname \"Needy\" was given to Seyfried's character to underline the essentially condescending dynamic in Jennifer and Needy's high school relationship,<ref name=\"sfweekly.com\">{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Pinkerton|title=Jennifer's Body|publisher=[[Sci Fi Weekly]]|date=September 18, 2009|access-date=September 24, 2009|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/movies/jennifers-body-1279788/}}</ref> as Needy often admires Jennifer and feels she needs her. Cody said \"Jennifer is a product of a culture that pressures girls to be skinny, beautiful and just like movie stars\" and that she \"hopes the film inspires girls to take life into their own hands and do with it, what they want\".<ref name=in.reuters.com/> \"If I had gone to this movie as a teenage girl, I would've come out of it feeling totally inspired\", she stated. \"I would've wanted to write, I would've wanted to create and I would've felt like I watched something that was speaking to me.\"<ref name=in.reuters.com/>\n\nAssigned to direct the film, Kusama said, \"I think also a lot of horror is about femaleness \u2013 whether it's ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' or ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''.\"<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/> She said she feels \"like there's a lot of fear of the female or kind of celebration of it in some weird way and something about this movie managed to take the fear and the sense that it's the female that ultimately survives and sort of marry that in a really interesting way\".<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>\n\nAddressing her decision to have Jennifer and Needy be romantically intimate at one point during the film, which takes place in the form of a long and passionate kissing scene, Cody said she did not write the scene to score publicity.<ref name=www.afterellen.com/> Speaking of the scene's media hype, she said that \"if the two protagonists of the film were a guy and a girl and in a particularly tense moment, they shared a kiss, no one would say it was gratuitous\" but \"the fact that they're women means it's some kind of stunt\". The scene was \"intended to be something profound and meaningful\" to her and Kusama.<ref name=www.afterellen.com/> She further stated:\n\n<blockquote>Obviously we knew people were going to totally sensationalize it. They're beautiful girls, the scene is hot\u2014I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [your] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them and talk to them on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.<ref name=www.afterellen.com/></blockquote>\n\nThough the film is part comedy, Cody initially intended for it to be a \"very dark, very brooding\" traditional slasher film. Close to \"a third of the way into the process\" she felt that she was incapable of doing so because \"the humor just kept sneaking in\". She stated, \"I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot of the things in the movie that are horrifying are funny to me.\" Feeling that \"comedy films and horror films are kind of similar\" due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense audience reactions, Cody stated, \"They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience. So, I actually think comedy and horror are kind of similar in that way.\"<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>\n\n=== Design and effects ===\n[[Image:Jennifer's Body, demon within.jpg|thumb|right|One of the makeup designs in the film for Jennifer's mouth while the character is in demonic form. Fox explained that the jaw unhinges sort of like a [[snake]]'s so that Jennifer can \"fully envelop\" her victims.<ref name=\"maximotv\">{{cite news|title=Megan Fox on the 'Make-Up Process' for Jennifer's Body at Hot Topic Event|publisher=maximotv|date=September 16, 2009}}</ref> Unlike a snake, the character has long, sharp teeth in order to tear the flesh from her victims' bodies as she eats them.]]\n\nHandling the film's [[special effect]]s were KNB EFX GROUP and [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC). For Jennifer's demonic form, the creators used different techniques. \"I actually wasn't in [the makeup chair] that much because they created an entire head. They did a live cast of me from the shoulders up. They created me and then put the teeth in\", stated Fox. \"To save my face, they had a photo double that would come in and do most of the crazy monster makeup - they would do that on her. So it would go from me, then in post-production it would somehow go to her and the fake head. They would mix them all together.\"<ref name=shocktillyoudrop.com/>\n\nFor the \"vomit scene\" where Jennifer has just arrived at Needy's house after being murdered and inhabited by a demon, Fox said the liquid she was given to spit out \"was actually ... chocolate syrup initially\".<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/> \"We did a few takes where I would just do this scream and sort of puke [[The Hershey Company|Hershey]]'s chocolate syrup. Scratch the Hershey's because I don't want to endorse that or anything\", she stated. \"And then, special effects did a rig that clamps onto my ear and you revisit it in the pool scene ...\" Fox said it \"clips on. It goes around the back of my ear and then I bite down on it on the side of my face, like this, and it projectiles. It's a tube ...\"<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>\n\nDirector Kusama said it had a classic feel. Fox agreed, \"Yeah, and it projects whatever that material was. I'm not sure. It was pretty intense. I think it was worse for [Seyfried] because she's the one that got puked on. I was the one doing the puking.\"<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>\n\nFor more practical special effects on the set as opposed to [[Computer graphics|CG]], Kusama said it \"was a choice that we all sort of made organically\". She said they appreciate \"those kind of effects in older movies and [questions] sometimes how much more effective it is to use a ton of CG\" and that they \"always started with a practical effect and then moved forward from there to lay a groundwork of something that's actually physically, materially there\". They found this to be more enjoyable.<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>\n\n{{quote_box|width=35%|align=left|quote=Before we started shooting, it involved the full appliance attached to [Fox's] face and then her real jaw would be [[Chroma key|greened]] essentially inside of her mouth and then the appliance would drop below her real jaw and then visual effects essentially owned everything in her mouth and everything outside would've been a special effects appliance. And then there would've been a lot of clean up as well because of the way it attached to her face.|source=\u2014Erik Nordby on the construction of Jennifer's demonic mouth and jaw<ref name=www.awn.com/>}}\n\nErik Nordby of KNB (known for his work on ''[[The Haunting in Connecticut]]'', which also features co-star [[Kyle Gallner]]) stated, \"We immediately went into pitch mode in January and spent a solid two weeks trying to not only bid the script but also collect as much reference material and stuff for the first client get together.\"<ref name=\"www.awn.com\">{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Desowitz|title=Jennifer's Body: Jaw Dropping VFX|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=September 22, 2009|access-date=September 27, 2009|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/feature/ijennifers-bodyi-jaw-dropping-vfx}}</ref> He said the director and producers wanted an \"old-school, hands-off, lo-fi approach to the visual effects\" so that the horror elements would not overpower the storyline.<ref name=www.awn.com/> Based on the script, MPC similarly came to the same conclusion and \"provided a clear direction\" for Nordby and his team. \"At that point when we met with them, they had already met with KNB, who had already done up a stylized still of what, at the time, they were calling 'Evil Jennifer,'\" he said. \"There was a lot of info yet to come, but based on the script, Jennifer goes from very beautiful Megan Fox to a very ghoulish, succubus creature whose jaw distends half-way down her face.\" Nordby said the look was eventually toned down at the wishes of MPC. From there, KNB \"produced some tests, grabbing a bunch of stills from [Fox] and [did their] work to indicate how that balance could exist between special effects and visual effects and still maintain a level of subtlety\" and that \"[MPC] responded really well\".<ref name=www.awn.com/>\n\nThe teams wanted to \"maintain some sort of the Megan Fox allure\" but said that it was \"incredibly difficult because as soon as [they] warped her face in any direction, the shine kind of came off it\". To combat this, they ended up focusing on anything below her nose, where they had the freedom to make things \"as horrific as [they] needed to\" and then above her nose, \"[they] could manipulate it somewhat with warps and color correction in her eye sockets. So even at her worst, she had some of that sexiness throughout\".<ref name=www.awn.com/>\n\nNordby said most of the attention was devoted to Jennifer's face and that \"very quickly in combination\" with special effects and makeup, MPC thought up a five-station system for what Jennifer goes through. Nordby stated:\n\n<blockquote>Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain like the rest of us. And stage four was some custom [[dentures]] that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]] and a variety of other musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.<ref name=www.awn.com/></blockquote>\n\nDuring testing, Nordby and the special effects teams realized that getting Fox in and out of the appliance used to create Jennifer's murderous jaw would be too time-consuming. To remedy this, they hired a photo double. \"[E]very day (for about 10 days) she would sit in a chair with this full appliance on her and we would shoot this jaw, and then all [Fox] would have to do is the dentures\", stated Nordby. He said that \"when it came time to shoot any of these jaw moments, [Fox] would act out in rehearsal how she was going to attack her victim and [they would] fine tune that blocking so it was relatively locked\".<ref name=\"www.awn.com\" /> The camera accompanied them in the same way, as \"it would roll and she would put her dentures in, and they would really distort her face\" in a way that would produce a satisfying and nice side effect. Additionally, the team would have Fox wear [[contact lens]]es and go through exactly the same motions as normal Jennifer. \"But then I would shoot all the key poses that existed in whatever moves the digital double was doing, so that we had as much of that appliance in that lighting condition that we could get\", said Nordby. \"KNB also created a hairless but high detailed head of the stage five Jennifer that had an articulating jaw.\"<ref name=\"www.awn.com\" />\n[[Image:Fire and Jennifer's demon eyes.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Seyfried (left) as Needy during the fire which leads to Jennifer's kidnapping, and Fox (right) as demonic Jennifer a month after the incident; the special effects teams recessed the character's eyes and added a pinning effect to her irises, along with a variety of other musculature deforms to create the illusion.<ref name=\"www.awn.com\" />]]\n\nNordby spent a significant amount of time shooting \"the articulating jaw\" scene because they had \"ultimate control over how the light was hitting the head\". He said, \"This so-called jaw shot became a pivotal point, because for four months of the post, the filmmakers thought the film was getting too scary so MPC pulled back on the jaw and then they thought it wasn't scary enough.\"<ref name=\"www.awn.com\" /> Because of this, \"they pushed back and this jaw went back and forth quite a bit to help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day\". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. \"From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did\", said Nordby, \"there was a lot of work figuring out how to make this a scary film as well as a funny film.\"<ref name=\"www.awn.com\" /> Since the team was on a small budget, they \"relied more on skilled artists to think through shots rather than a brute force approach\".<ref name=\"www.awn.com\" />\n\nMPC additionally worked on the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed at the beginning of the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. \"We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a lot of confidence in our water sims\", stated Nordby. \"The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over.\"<ref name=\"www.awn.com\" /> They could not lock it to a [[Panning (camera)|pan]] or to a [[View camera#Tilt|tilt]] and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, \"I eventually lowered down a shot\u2014a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in.\" They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. \"He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match\", stated Nordby. \"And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it.\" Dealing with \"very shallow\" water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.<ref name=\"www.awn.com\" />\n\nDuring the film's fire scene, Cody appears as a character in the barroom. \"To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics and all that stuff which is why I don't know why I asked to be in the bar scene because I've never exploded before\", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. \"That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that [[Burt Reynolds]] had done it once\", stated Cody. \"But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, it was more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough.\"<ref name=\"www.moviesonline.ca\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nIn late 2007, Fox Atomic had plans to film ''Jennifer's Body'' before a possible writer's strike. When the [[Writers Guild of America strike (2007\u2013present)|Writers Guild of America strike]] began, shooting was then moved to March 7, 2008, in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]], specifically at Robert Burnaby Park near Cariboo Hill Secondary School. Some of the scenes, particularly those situated in a school setting, were filmed in local [[Vancouver]]-area schools such as [[Vancouver Technical Secondary School]], [[Langley Secondary School]] and [[University Hill Secondary School]].  The waterfalls scene was filmed at Cascade Falls in Cascade Falls Regional Park in British Columbia.\n\nFox said that while filming her highly anticipated kissing scene with Seyfried that Seyfried was \"extremely uncomfortable\" but that she herself was not. \"I feel much safer with girls, so I felt more comfortable kissing [Seyfried] than kissing any of the other people that I had to kiss\", she said.<ref name=\"moviesblog.mtv.com\">{{cite web | first = Adam | last = Rosenberg | title = Megan Fox Talks About Her 'Jennifer's Body' Kiss With Amanda Seyfried |publisher= MTV|date= August 31, 2009 |access-date= September 26, 2009 |url= http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/08/31/megan-fox-talks-about-her-jennifers-body-kiss-with-amanda-seyfried/ }}</ref> Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused \"giggling fits\" between takes.<ref name=moviesblog.mtv.com/> Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes.<ref name=wWw.afterellen.com/> She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. \"It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman\", she stated. \"It is just weird.

He noted films ''[[Tremors (1990 film)|Tremors]]'', ''[[Slither (2006 film)|Slither]]'', ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'', ''[[Eight Legged Freaks]]'' and [[The Evil Dead (franchise)|''The Evil Dead'' series]], and said that while many of those are considered critical and business successes, \"none of them have brought in the megabucks that a simple horror or comedy can.\"<ref name=www.eonline.com/> In addition, he labeled the [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' franchise]] as more \"straight-up horror\" than comedy and stated ''[[Zombieland]]''{{'}}s box office performance would determine the horror-comedy genre's current viability.<ref name=www.eonline.com/>\n\nDespite other R-rated horror films having centered around teenagers, some such as ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' having been successful, Bock said the second reason ''Jennifer's Body'' under-performed at the box office is the R-rating, which he described as a \"killer\" for the film. He said the film is set in high school and \"sounds like the perfect package for teens\" but that \"the R rating banned many teens from the theaters\" and the studio was left with \"an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?\"<ref name=www.eonline.com/> Nicole Sperling of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs'' was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the [[Matt Damon]] film ''[[The Informant!]]'' and [[Jennifer Aniston]] film ''[[Love Happens (2009 film)|Love Happens]]'', she concluded that this may support \"the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter\" and that it takes more than a name to open a film.<ref name=\"hollywoodinsider.ew.com\">{{cite magazine|first=Nicole|last=Sperling|title=Box Office: 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' soars; 'Jennifer's Body' sinks|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 21, 2009|access-date=September 22, 2009|url= http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/09/box-office-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-soars-jennifers-body-sinks/ |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120902183020/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/09/box-office-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-soars-jennifers-body-sinks/ |url-status= dead |archive-date= September 2, 2012 }}</ref> S.T.

The first, he said, is the distributor. \"[[20th Century Fox]]'s genre wing, [[Fox Atomic]], had ''Jennifer's Body'' in the can by the time the mother ship shut it down last spring\", he said. \"Instead of offloading the film to [[Fox Searchlight]], which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild ''Juno'' to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory\" and \"[[Postfeminism|post-feminist]] horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried\". VanAirsdale classified this as a \"[b]ig mistake\" and that \"[y]ou'd have to go back to ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'' to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you'd probably have to go back to ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully.\"<ref name=www.movieline.com/> He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in [[New York City|New York]].<ref name=www.movieline.com/>\n[[File:Diably Cody Jennifers Body TIFF09.jpg|thumb|left|Cody (center) at ''Jennifer's Body'' screening at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]].]]\n\nVanAirsdale cited the release date and [[Film screening|screening]] as the third and fourth reasons; he said there was confusion about what day the film was going to debut in theaters, and that [[Toronto]] is \"a nation removed from the audience where the film's actual momentum had been accruing for at least a month\" and that \"this rarely works for early fall releases; not because news doesn't travel, obviously, but because it peels away a layer of accessibility that accompanies New York and [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] bows.\"<ref name=www.movieline.com/> The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned Ty Burr's review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is \"ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization\" and that \"[t]he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women who happen to be two sides of the same coin.

It was written by Black Metal's [[Rick Spears]], with the first nine pages illustrated by [[Jim Mahfood]] (''[[Clerks. (comics)|Clerks]]''). Two covers, in Fox's likeness, were designed; one for the direct market by Eric Jones (available only in comic specialty stores), and the other by [[Frank Cho]] for the mass market focusing more on \"hellish Jennifer stories\" with art by Mahfood, [[Hack/Slash]]'s Tim Seely, [[DMZ (comics)|DMZ's]] Nikki Cook, and Popgun's Ming Doyle.

It focuses heavily on following her soon-to-be victims and provides information on their personalities not elaborated on in the film so that readers can better conclude whether the boys deserved to be murdered. The novel consists of four chapters, with a prologue and an epilogue, with art provided for each by different artists. Each one follows a different boy and what is happening in his life just before Jennifer kills him.<ref name=\"www.atomiccomics.com\"/>\n\nOn creating the story, Spears stated, \"The best part for me as a writer was to show some events from the movie from a different point of view, sort of like ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' for you [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] fans. And with comics we can get into the character's [''sic''] heads in a way that works well in comics and novels more so than in film.\"<ref name=\"www.atomiccomics.com\"/> He stated, \"... I was using the medium to change what we really know about these characters and twist around what we see in the movies. All the academics aside, it's also very funny and gore splattered.\"<ref name=www.atomiccomics.com/>\n\nSpears stated that while writing the stories, the film was still being made and he had not seen any of it at the time. He mainly learned about the characters through the script. \"I got to read the screenplay. It was kinda crazy writing characters that were being changed on set and in the editing process. I had to bob and weave to keep up but that was all part of the fun\", he said.<ref name=\"www.atomiccomics.com\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ginger Snaps (film)|''Ginger Snaps'' (film)]]\u2014A 2000 film with a similar plot\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=1131734|title=Jennifer's Body}}\n* {{tcmdb title|736809|Jennifer's Body}}\n* {{mojo title|id=jennifersbody|title=Jennifer's Body}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=jennifers_body|title=Jennifer's Body}}\n\n{{Karyn Kusama}}\n{{Diablo Cody}}\n{{Jason Reitman}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jennifer's Body}}\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2009 black comedy films]]\n[[Category:2009 comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:2009 fantasy films]]\n[[Category:2009 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:2000s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s female buddy films]]\n[[Category:2000s feminist films]]\n[[Category:2000s high school films]]\n[[Category:2000s satirical films]]\n[[Category:2000s supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s teen horror films]]\n[[Category:Films about teenagers]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American female buddy films]]\n[[Category:American high school films]]\n[[Category:American rape and revenge films]]\n[[Category:American satirical films]]\n[[Category:American splatter films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American teen horror films]]\n[[Category:American teen LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Cheerleading films]]\n[[Category:Demons in film]]\n[[Category:Female bisexuality in film]]\n[[Category:Lesbian-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related comedy films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related horror films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related satirical films]]\n[[Category:Succubi in film]]\n[[Category:Supernatural comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about mass murder]]\n[[Category:Films about proms]]\n[[Category:Films about Satanism]]\n[[Category:Films about spirit possession]]\n[[Category:Films about virginity]]\n[[Category:Films set in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Karyn Kusama]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jason Reitman]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Mason Novick]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Theodore Shapiro]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Diablo Cody]]\n[[Category:Dune Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Vigilante films]]\n[[Category:Films about human sacrifice]]\n[[Category:American vigilante films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
