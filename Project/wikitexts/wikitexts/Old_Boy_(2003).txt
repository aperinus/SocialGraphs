The film is the second installment of Park's ''[[The Vengeance Trilogy]]'', preceded by ''[[Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance]]'' (2002) and followed by ''[[Lady Vengeance]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 1988, businessman Oh Dae-su is arrested for drunkenness, missing his daughter's fourth birthday. After his friend Joo-hwan picks him up from the [[police station]], Dae-su is kidnapped and wakes up in a sealed hotel room, where food is delivered through a [[pet door]]. Dae-su learns that his wife has been murdered and that he has been framed as a prime suspect by his captors. As years of imprisonment pass, Dae-su hallucinates, grows deranged from solitude, and eventually attempts suicide. While unconscious after slashing his wrists, Dae-su is resuscitated and bandaged, prevented from dying in order to ensure that he continues to live in agony. After this, Dae-su passes the time practicing [[shadowboxing]] and attempting to dig an [[escape tunnel]] in order to seek vengeance against his captors.\n\nIn 2003, Dae-su is suddenly released after being sedated and [[Hypnosis|hypnotized]]. Dae-su wakes up and, after testing his fighting skills on a group of thugs, a mysterious beggar gives him money and a [[Mobile phone|cell phone]]. Dae-su enters a [[sushi]] restaurant where he meets Mi-do, a young chef. He receives a taunting phone call from his captor, collapses, and is taken in by Mi-do. Dae-su attempts to leave Mi-do's apartment, but Mi-do, now interested in Dae-su, stops him. They reconcile and begin to form a bond. After he recovers, Dae-su attempts to find his daughter, but gives up on trying to contact her after learning she was adopted after his kidnapping. Now focused on identifying his captors, Dae-su locates the [[Chinese restaurant]] that made his prison food and finds the prison by following a deliveryman. \n\nDae-su learns the hotel he was held in is a [[private prison]], where people pay to have others incarcerated. He tortures and interrogates the [[Prison warden|warden]], Mr. Park Cheol-woong, who divulges that Dae-su was imprisoned for \"talking too much\". Mr. Park's guards come to attack Dae-su, and they fight fiercely in the hotel corridor; Dae-su is stabbed but manages to defeat all of them. Dae-su's captor is revealed to be a wealthy businessman named Lee Woo-jin. Woo-jin gives him an ultimatum: if Dae-su can uncover the motive for his imprisonment within five days, Woo-jin will kill himself; otherwise, he will kill Mi-do. Dae-su and Mi-do get close and have sex. Meanwhile, Joo-hwan tries to contact Dae-su with important information, but is murdered by Woo-jin. Dae-su eventually recalls that he and Woo-jin went to the same high school, and that he witnessed Woo-jin committing [[incest]] with his own sister. Dae-su told Joo-hwan what he saw, which led to his classmates gossiping about it. Rumors spread and Woo-jin's sister committed suicide, leading a grief-stricken Woo-jin to seek revenge. In the present, Woo-jin cuts off Mr. Park's hand, leading Mr. Park and his gang to join forces with Dae-su. Dae-su leaves Mi-do with Mr. Park and sets out to face Woo-jin. \n\nAt Woo-jin's [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]], he shows Dae-su a purple box containing a [[Photo album|family album]] containing photos of Dae-su, his wife, and his infant daughter together from years ago, progressing to show how his daughter grew up. Woo-jin then reveals that Mi-do is actually Dae-su's daughter, and that he had orchestrated everything, using hypnosis to guide Dae-su to the restaurant so he and Mi-do would fall in love, so that Dae-su would experience the same pain of incest that he did. Woo-jin reveals that Mr. Park is still working for him and threatens to tell the truth to Mi-do. Dae-su apologizes for being the source of the rumor that caused the death of Woo-jin's sister, and humiliates himself by imitating a dog and begging. When Woo-jin is unimpressed, Dae-su cuts out his own tongue as a sign of [[penance]]. Woo-jin finally accepts Dae-su's apology and tells Mr. Park to hide the truth from Mi-do. He then drops the device he claims is the remote to his [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]] and walks away. Dae-su activates the device in an attempt to kill Woo-jin, only to find it is actually a remote for [[loudspeaker]]s, which play an audio recording of Dae-su and Mi-do having sex. As Dae-su collapses in despair, Woo-jin enters the elevator, where he recalls his sister's suicide and shoots himself to death.\n\nSome time later, Dae-su finds the hypnotist and asks her to [[Memory erasure|erase his knowledge]] of Mi-do being his daughter so that they can stay happy together. To persuade her, he repeats the question he heard from the man on the rooftop, and the hypnotist agrees. Afterward, Mi-do finds Dae-su lying in snow, but there are no signs of the hypnotist. Mi-do confesses her love for him and the two embrace. Dae-su breaks into a wide smile, which is slowly replaced by a more ambiguous expression.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Choi Min-sik.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Choi Min-sik]] played the lead role in Oldboy as Oh Dae-su.]]\n* [[Choi Min-sik]] as Oh Dae-su, a businessman who seeks revenge after being held in a mysterious prison for 15 years.

The [[octopus]] being eaten alive was not computer-generated; four were used during the filming of this scene. Actor Choi Min-sik, a [[Buddhist]], said a prayer for each one. The eating of squirming octopuses (called ''[[san-nakji]]'' (\uc0b0\ub099\uc9c0) in Korean) as a delicacy exists in East Asia, although it is usually killed and cut, not eaten whole and alive; the squirming is a result of posthumous nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/korean-restaurant-live-octopus-dish-animal-rights-activists-squirming-article-1.444306|title=Korean restaurant's live Octopus dish has animal rights activists squirming|last=Rosen|first=Daniel Edward|date=4 May 2010|work=[[New York Daily News]]|access-date=3 June 2017|archive-date=11 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211222854/https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/korean-restaurant-live-octopus-dish-animal-rights-activists-squirming-article-1.444306|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2017/05/123_65910.html|title=Clash of culture?

In an interview with Park (included with the European release of the film), he says that the ambiguous ending was deliberate and intended to generate discussion; it is completely up to each individual viewer to interpret what isn't shown.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Anchor|Response|Reception}}\n\n=== Critical response ===\n''Oldboy'' received generally positive reviews from critics.

Indeed, throughout the movie Lee Woo-jin is portrayed as an obscenely rich young man who lives in a lofty tower and is omnipresent due to having planted listening devices on Oh Dae-Su and others, which again furthers the parallel between his character and the secrecy of Greek gods.\n\nMido, who throughout the movie comes across as a strong-willed, young and innocent girl, which is not too far from Sophocles' Antigone, Oedipus' daughter, who, though she does not commit incest with her father, remains faithful and loyal to him which reminds us of the bittersweet ending where Mido reunites with Oh Dae-Su and takes care of him in the wilderness (cf. ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'', the second installment of the Oedipus trilogy). Another interesting character is the hypnotist, who, apart from being able to hypnotise people, also has the power to make people fall in love (e.g. Dae-Su and Mido), which is characteristic of the power of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, whose classic act is to make Paris and Helen fall in love before and during the Trojan War.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://keithtselinguist.wordpress.com/2015/04/18/greek-tragedy-in-east-asia-oldboy-2003/|title=Greek tragedy in East Asia: Oldboy (2003)|date=17 April 2015|access-date=23 September 2017|archive-date=24 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924045946/https://keithtselinguist.wordpress.com/2015/04/18/greek-tragedy-in-east-asia-oldboy-2003/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Box office performance ===\n{{Anchor|Box office}} \nIn [[South Korea]], the film was seen by 3,260,000 filmgoers and ranks fifth for the highest-grossing film of 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm03.html|title=Korean Movie Reviews for 2003: Save the Green Planet, Memories of Murder, A Tale of Two Sisters, Oldboy, Silmido, and more.|website=www.koreanfilm.org|access-date=18 August 2007|archive-date=28 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728222146/http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm03.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIt grossed a total of US$14,980,005 worldwide.<ref name=\"Mojo\"/>\n\n=== Home media ===\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 300,000 television viewers on [[Channel 4]] in 2011.
