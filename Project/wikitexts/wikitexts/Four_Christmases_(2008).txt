Both come from dysfunctional families: divorced parents and obnoxious siblings with out-of-control kids so they disdain the idea of getting married or having kids. They try to avoid their families at Christmas by traveling abroad, pretending to be doing charity work.\n\nOn the third Christmas of their relationship, they plan to go to [[Fiji]] but get trapped at [[San Francisco International Airport]] by a fog bank that cancels every outbound flight. The couple are also interviewed by a news crew, alerting their families they're stuck at home for the holidays.\n\nKate and Brad realize they can't get out of visiting: Brad's father first, then Kate's mother, then Brad's mother, and finally Kate's father: four Christmases in one day. Bracing themselves for a marathon of homecomings, Brad and Kate expect the worst but are still not quite prepared enough.\n\nThey keep discovering new secrets about each other they had previously been too embarrassed to share, such as Brad's real name being \"Orlando\" and Kate's fear of [[inflatable castle]]s (from a childhood trauma) and these strain their relationship. As Brad counts down the minutes to freedom, Kate studies their families' lives and realizes she does want marriage and children with Brad, the prospect of which frightens him when she mentions it.\n\nWhen they finally reach Kate's father's house, she asks Brad to let her go in alone then gets out of the car and tells her family they have split up. Meanwhile, Brad returns to his father's and they have a quiet talk alone. Brad realizes he wants marriage and children and with Kate\u2014he loves her too much to leave her. Returning to her, they discuss marriage and children then finally head to Fiji.\n\nOn New Year's Day a year later, Brad and Kate welcome their first child, a daughter, after spending nine months hiding the news from their families. As theirs is the New Year's baby, a news crew comes to congratulate them\u2014once again revealing them, and their new baby, to the whole city and their families.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Bradford \u201cBrad\u201d McVie, formerly Orlando McVie\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Kate Kinkaid\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Howard McVie\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Denver McVie\n* [[Mary Steenburgen]] as Marilyn Kinkaid\n* [[Dwight Yoakam]] as Pastor Phil\n* [[Tim McGraw]] as Dallas McVie\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Courtney\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Creighton Kinkaid\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Paula\n* [[Katy Mixon]] as Susan McVie\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Aunt Sarah\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Aunt Donna\n* [[Jack Donner]] as Grandpa\n* [[Steve Wiebe]] as Jim\n* [[Skyler Gisondo]] as Connor McVie\n* [[Patrick Van Horn]] as Darryl\n* [[Brian Baumgartner]] as Eric\n* [[Cedric Yarbrough]] as Stan\n* [[Haley Hallak]] as Baby Clementine\n* True Bella Pinci as Kasi\n{{div col end}}\n\nOne of the film's [[executive producer]]s, [[Peter Billingsley]], who had a starring role as Ralphie in the 1983 film ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', has a credited role as an airline ticket agent.\n\n==Production==\nPrior to Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s casting, it was announced that Spyglass Entertainment had set [[Adam Shankman]] to direct for [[Columbia Pictures]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/markets-festivals/spyglass-gets-christmases-1117893760/|title = Spyglass gets 'Christmases'|date = 10 October 2003}}</ref>\n\nGordon was brought in as director at the insistence of Vaughn, who had seen Gordon's documentary ''[[The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters]]'', a film, Gordon points out, which, like ''Four Christmases'', has a \"traditional [[Three act structure|three-act structure]]\".<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\nThe film began production in December 2007, during the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]], which meant that no changes could be made to the script.<ref name=\"lat\"/>  During production, [[New Line Cinema]] became a \"unit of [[Warner Bros.]]\",<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSWNAS301020080228 \"New Line Cinema to become unit of Warner Bros\"].
