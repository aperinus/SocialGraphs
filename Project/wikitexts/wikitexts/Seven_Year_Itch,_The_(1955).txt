The film stars [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Tom Ewell]], who reprised his stage role.

When he returns home from the train station with the kayak paddle Ricky accidentally left behind, he meets an unnamed woman, who is a commercial actress and former model. She rents the apartment upstairs while in town to make television spots for a brand of toothpaste. That evening, he works on reading the manuscript of a book in which [[psychiatrist]] Dr. Brubaker claims that almost all men are driven to have extra-marital affairs in the seventh year of marriage. Sherman has an imaginary conversation with Helen, trying to convince her, in three fantasy sequences, that he is irresistible to women, including his secretary, a nurse, and Helen's bridesmaid, but she laughs it off. A potted tomato plant falls onto his lounge chair; the woman upstairs apologizes for accidentally knocking it off her balcony, and Richard invites her down for a drink.\n\n[[File:Ewell leans in for kiss in The Seven Year Itch trailer 1.jpg|thumb|Ewell reprised his Broadway role and Monroe replaced [[Vanessa Brown]].]]\nWhile waiting for her to arrive, he vacillates between a fantasy of her as a [[femme fatale]] overcome by his playing of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Piano Concerto]], and guilt at betraying his wife. When she does come down, she is wearing pink pajamas and turns out to be a na\u00efve and innocent young woman. On his suggestion, she brings back a bottle of champagne from her apartment and returns in a white dress. Richard, overcome by his fantasies, awkwardly grabs at her while they are playing \"[[Chopsticks (music)|Chopsticks]]\" together on the piano, causing them to fall off the piano bench. He apologizes, but she says it happens to her all the time. Guilt-ridden, he asks her to leave.\n\nThe next day at work, Richard is distracted by the fear Helen will find out about his indiscretion, though she is none the wiser and just wants Richard to send Ricky his paddle so he can use the kayak. Richard's waning resolve to resist temptation fuels his fear that he is succumbing to the \"Seven Year Itch\". He visits Dr. Brubaker, who arrives at the office to discuss the book, to no avail. When he keeps hearing of his wife spending time with her writer friend McKenzie in Maine, Richard imagines they are carrying on an affair, and he decides to invite the young woman out to dinner and a film. They go to an [[Air conditioning|air-conditioned]] theater, seeking respite from the oppressive heat, and see ''[[The Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''. As the two are talking while walking home, she briefly stands over a subway grate to experience the updraft \u2013 Monroe in the iconic scene in her [[pleat]]ed white [[halterneck]] dress, blowing her skirt up in the breeze. The two then spend the night (platonicly) at his air-conditioned apartment (as her apartment is uncooled) so she can rest for her television appearance.\n\nThe next morning, Richard comes to his senses, and fearing his wife's retribution (within his dream), he tells the woman she can stay in his apartment, and leaves to catch the train to Maine.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe photo pose Seven Year Itch.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Monroe is posing for photographers, wearing a white halterneck dress, which hem is blown up by air from a subway grate on which she is standing.|Monroe posing for photographers while filming the subway grate scene for the film in September 1954]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marilyn Monroe]] as The Girl (credited as such, though Richard Sherman satirically remarks \"maybe she's Marilyn Monroe\")\n* [[Tom Ewell]] as Richard Sherman (billed as Tommy Ewell)\n* [[Evelyn Keyes]] as Helen Sherman\n* [[Sonny Tufts]] as Tom MacKenzie\n* [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]] as Kruhulik\n* [[Oscar Homolka]] as Dr. Brubaker\n* [[Marguerite Chapman]] as Miss Morris\n* [[Victor Moore]] as Plumber\n* [[Donald MacBride]] as Mr. Brady\n* [[Roxanne (model)|Roxanne]] as Elaine\n* [[Carolyn Jones]] as Nurse Finch\n* [[Tom Nolan (actor)|Tom Nolan]] as Ricky Sherman (uncredited)\n* [[Doro Merande]] as Waitress at Vegetarian Restaurant (uncredited)\n* [[Kathleen Freeman]] as Woman at Vegetarian Restaurant (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:090px;\"|Song<ref name=\"songs\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048605/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd|title=The Seven Year Itch (1955): Soundtracks|publisher=[[IMDb]] |access-date=November 9, 2014}}</ref>\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:120px;\"|Performer(s)\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:160px;\"|Note(s)\n|-\n|\"[[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]]\"\n|\n|Played on a record and often in the score\n|-\n|\"[[Sentimental Journey (song)|Sentimental Journey]]\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014\n|Played often in the score\n|-\n|\"[[Chopsticks (music)|Chopsticks]]\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Tom Ewell]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014\n|-\n|}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Monroe's skirt blows up in The Seven Year Itch trailer 1.jpg|thumb|right|Marilyn Monroe's skirt blows upwards in the film.]]\n[[File:What Happened on Twenty-third Street, New York City.png|thumb|right|The depiction of Monroe over the grate has been compared to a similar event in the 1901 short film ''[[What Happened on Twenty-third Street, New York City]]''.<ref>Rosemary Hanes with Brian Taves. \"[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmi10/ Moving Image Section&nbsp;\u2013 Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division]\" [[The Library of Congress]].

The characters of Elaine ([[Dolores Rosedale]]), Marie, and the inner voices of Sherman and The Girl were dropped from the play; the characters of the Plumber, Miss Finch ([[Carolyn Jones]]), the Waitress ([[Doro Merande]]), and Kruhulik the janitor ([[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]]) were added. Many lines and scenes from the play were cut or re-written because they were deemed indecent by the [[Hays Code|Hays office]]. Axelrod and Wilder complained that the film was being made under [[straitjacket]]ed conditions. This led to a major plot change: in the play, Sherman and The Girl have sex; in the movie, the romance is reduced to suggestion; Sherman and the Girl kiss three times, once while playing Sherman's piano together, once outside the movie theater and once near the end before Sherman goes to take Ricky's paddle to him. The footage of Monroe's dress billowing over a subway grate was shot twice: the first take was shot on location outside the Trans-Lux 52nd Street Theater, then located at 586 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, while the second take was on a sound stage. Both eventually made their way into the finished film,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} despite the often-held belief that the original on-location footage's sound had been rendered useless by the overexcited crowd present during filming in New York. The exterior shooting location of Richard's apartment was 164 East 61st Street in Manhattan.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121218091324/http://thecad.net/Theatre/george-axelrod.html The Cad]</ref>\n\n[[Saul Bass]] created the abstract title sequence, which was mentioned favorably in numerous reviews; up until that time, it was unheard of for trade press reviews to mention film title sequences.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Horak|first=Jan-Christopher|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/892799673|title=Saul Bass : Anatomy of Film Design.|date=2014|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-4720-8|location=Lexington|oclc=892799673}}</ref>\n\n[[Joe Dimaggio|Dimaggio]] was on set during the filming of the dress scene, and reportedly angry and disgusted with the attention his wife received from onlookers, reporters, and photographers in attendance.\nWilder had invited the media to drum up interest in the film.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.biography.com/news/marilyn-monroe-joe-dimaggio-relationship | title=Inside Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio's Roller Coaster Romance }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://scifidimensions.com/news-marilyn-monroe-dress-scene-joe-dimaggio/ | title=The Shocking Story You Never Knew Behind Marilyn Monroe's Skirt Scene | date=August 29, 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://factsverse.com/the-truth-behind-the-marilyn-monroe-dress-scene/ | title=The Truth Behind the Marilyn Monroe Dress Scene | date=July 3, 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nA major commercial success, the film earned $6&nbsp;million in rentals at the North American box office.<ref>\"All Time Domestic Champs\", ''Variety'', January 6, 1960, p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe original 1955 review by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was largely positive.
