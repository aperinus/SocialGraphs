Directed by [[Alan J. Pakula]] with a screenplay by [[William Goldman]], it is based on the [[All the President's Men|1974 non-fiction book of the same name]] by [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]], the two [[journalist]]s investigating the [[Watergate scandal]] for ''[[The Washington Post]]''.\n\nThe film stars [[Robert Redford]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively; it was produced by Walter Coblenz for Redford's Wildwood Enterprises.\n\nThe film was nominated in multiple [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] and [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] categories, and in 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hollywood Blockbusters, Independent Films and Shorts Selected for 2010 National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-10-273/2010-national-film-registry-announced/2010-12-28/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-18|archive-date=2017-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228035318/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-10-273/2010-national-film-registry-announced/2010-12-28/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-18|archive-date=2016-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn June 17, 1972, security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]] at the [[Watergate complex]] finds a door's bolt taped over to prevent it from locking. He calls the police, who find and arrest five burglars in the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters within the complex. The next morning, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' assigns new reporter [[Bob Woodward]] to the local courthouse to cover the story, which is considered of minor importance.\n\nWoodward learns that the [[White House Plumbers|five men]]&mdash;[[James W. McCord Jr.]] and four Cuban-Americans from Miami&mdash;possessed electronic bugging equipment and are represented by a high-priced \"country club\" attorney. At the arraignment, McCord identifies himself in court as having recently left the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), and the others are also revealed to have CIA ties. Woodward connects the burglars to [[E. Howard Hunt]], an employee of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[White House Counsel|White House counsel]] [[Charles Colson]], and formerly of the CIA.\n\n[[Carl Bernstein]], another ''Post'' reporter, is assigned to cover the Watergate story with Woodward. The two young men are reluctant partners but work well together. Executive editor [[Ben Bradlee|Benjamin Bradlee]] believes that their work lacks reliable sources and is not worthy of the ''Post'''s front page, but he encourages further investigation.\n\nWoodward contacts a senior government official, an anonymous source whom he has used before and refers to as \"[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]].\" Communicating secretly, using a flag placed in a balcony flowerpot to signal meetings, they meet at night in an underground [[multistorey car park|parking garage]]. Deep Throat speaks in riddles and metaphors, avoiding substantial facts about the Watergate break-in, but advises Woodward to \"[[follow the money]].\"\n\nWoodward and Bernstein connect the five burglars to corrupt activities involving campaign contributions to Nixon's [[Committee to Re-elect the President]] (CRP or CREEP). This includes a check for $25,000 paid by [[Kenneth H. Dahlberg]], whom Miami authorities identified when investigating the Miami-based burglars. However, Bradlee and others at the ''Post'' still doubt the investigation and its dependence on sources such as Deep Throat, wondering why the Nixon administration should break the law when the president is almost certain to defeat his opponent, Democratic nominee [[George McGovern]].\n\nThrough former CREEP treasurer [[Hugh W. Sloan, Jr.]], Woodward and Bernstein connect a [[slush fund]] of hundreds of thousands of dollars to White House chief of staff [[H. R. Haldeman]]&mdash;\"the second most important man in this country\"&mdash;and to former attorney general [[John N. Mitchell]], now head of CREEP. They learn that CREEP was financing a \"[[ratfucking]]\" campaign to sabotage Democratic presidential candidates a year before the Watergate burglary, when Nixon was lagging [[Edmund Muskie]] in the polls.\n\nWhile Bradlee's demand for thoroughness compels the reporters to obtain other sources to confirm the Haldeman connection, the White House issues a [[non-denial denial]] of the ''Post'''s above-the-fold story. Bradlee continues to encourage investigation.\n\nWoodward again meets secretly with Deep Throat and demands that he be less evasive. Deep Throat reveals that Haldeman masterminded the Watergate break-in and [[cover-up]]. He also states that the cover-up was not just intended to camouflage the CREEP involvement but also to hide \"covert operations\" involving \"the entire U.S. intelligence community,\" including the CIA and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. He warns Woodward and Bernstein that their lives, and those of others, are in danger. When the two relay this information to Bradlee, he urges them to carry on despite the risk.\n\nOn [[Second inauguration of Richard Nixon|January 20, 1973]], Bernstein and Woodward type the full story, while a television in the newsroom shows Nixon taking the oath of office for his second term as president. A montage of Watergate-related teletype headlines from the following years is shown, ending with the report of [[Resignation of Richard Nixon|Nixon's resignation]] and the inauguration of [[Gerald Ford]] on [[Inauguration of Gerald Ford|August 9, 1974]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Carl Bernstein]]\n* [[Robert Redford]] as [[Bob Woodward]]\n* [[Jack Warden]] as [[Harry M.

Goldman has said that Woodward was extremely helpful to him but that Bernstein was not. Goldman wrote that his crucial decision regarding the screenplay's structure was to discard the second half of the book.<ref>Goldman 1982, p. 235</ref> After he delivered his first draft in August 1974, Warner Bros. agreed to finance the film.\n\nRedford was not happy with Goldman's first draft.<ref name= \"shales\"/> Woodward and Bernstein read it and also did not like it. Redford asked for their suggestions, but Bernstein and his girlfriend, writer [[Nora Ephron]], wrote their own draft. Redford showed this draft to Goldman, suggesting that it might contain some material that he could integrate, but Goldman later called Redford's acceptance of the Bernstein\u2013Ephron draft a \"gutless betrayal.\"<ref name=\"Goldman 1982, p. 240\">Goldman 1982, p. 240</ref> Redford later expressed dissatisfaction with the Ephron\u2013Bernstein draft, saying, \"a lot of it was sophomoric and way off the beat.\"<ref name= \"shales\"/> According to Goldman, \"in what they wrote, Bernstein was sure catnip to the ladies.\"<ref name=\"Goldman 1982, p. 240\"/> He also said that one of Bernstein and Ephron's scenes was included in the final film, a bit in which Bernstein deceives a secretary in order to see someone, something that was not factually true.\n\n[[Alan J. Pakula]] was hired to direct and requested rewrites from Goldman. In a 2011 biography, Redford claimed that he and Pakula held all-day sessions working on the script. Pakula spent hours interviewing editors and reporters, taking notes of their comments.\n\nIn 2011, Richard Stayton wrote an article for ''Written By'' magazine<ref>{{cite web|title=Written By|url=http://bluetoad.com/publication/?i=67460|work=magazine publication of|publisher=[[Writers Guild of America West#Magazine|WGAw]]|access-date=2011-11-06|archive-date=2011-09-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906010215/http://bluetoad.com/publication/?i=67460|url-status=live}}</ref> following his comparison of several drafts of the script, including the final production draft.

However, Bradlee had recommended [[George C. Scott]] for the role, and he was somewhat unimpressed when Robards visited the ''Post'' offices to develop a feel for the newsroom. In advance of the shoot, Bradlee told Robards: \"Just don't make me look like an asshole.\" At first, Pakula was worried that Robards could not carry Bradlee's easy elegance and command authority. [[Karl Malden]], [[Hal Holbrook]] (who would play Deep Throat), [[John Forsythe]], [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Richard Widmark]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Telly Savalas]] were also considered for the role.<ref>{{cite book | first =Jeff| last = Himmelman | title =Yours in Truth: A Personal Portrait of Ben Bradlee, Legendary Editor of The Washington Post | publisher = Random House Publishing Group | year= 2012 | url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812980565/ | isbn=978-0-679-60364-1 }}</ref>\n\nCharacter actor [[Martin Balsam]] played managing editor [[Howard Simons]]. According to Bradlee, Simons felt that his involvement with the real story was greatly diminished in the script.\n\nBradlee teased ''Post'' publisher [[Katharine Graham]] about who would play her in the film. \"Names like [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Lauren Bacall]] and [[Patricia Neal]] were tossed out\u2014by us\u2014to make her feel good,\" Bradlee said. \"And names like [[Edna May Oliver]] or [[Marie Dressler]], if it felt like teasing time.

The filmmakers went to great lengths for accuracy and authenticity, including making replicas of outdated phone books.<ref name= \"shales\"/> Nearly 200 desks at $500 each were purchased from the same firm that had sold desks to the ''Post'' in 1971. The desks were painted the same color as those of the newsroom. The production was supplied with a brick from the main lobby of the ''Post'' so that it could be duplicated in fiberglass for the set.

It simultaneously recounts how ''The Washington Post'' broke Watergate and how the scandal unfolded, going behind the scenes of the film. It explores how the Watergate scandal would be covered in the present day, whether such a scandal could happen again and who Richard Nixon was as a man. [[W. Mark Felt]], deputy director of the FBI during the early 1970s, revealed his identity as Deep Throat in 2005, and this is also covered in the documentary.\n\nFootage from the film is included, as are interviews with Redford and Hoffman as well as with real-life central characters including Woodward, Bernstein, Bradlee, [[John Dean]], [[Alexander Butterfield]] and [[Fred Thompson]], who served as minority counsel to the [[Senate Watergate Committee]] in his first major public appearance. Contemporary media figures such as [[Tom Brokaw]], who was [[NBC News]]' White House correspondent during the scandal, [[Jill Abramson]], [[Rachel Maddow]] and [[Jon Stewart]] also are featured in the documentary, which earned a 2013 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bauder|first=David|title='All the President's Men Revisited' Documentary To Air On Discovery|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/20/all-the-presidents-men-revisited-documentary-discovery_n_3122655.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|access-date=October 17, 2013|date=March 20, 2013|archive-date=October 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026113500/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/20/all-the-presidents-men-revisited-documentary-discovery_n_3122655.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.emmys.com/shows/all-presidents-men-revisited The Primetime Emmys  \u2013 ''All The President's Men Revisted''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529235128/http://www.emmys.com/shows/all-presidents-men-revisited |date=2014-05-29 }} The Emmys</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Final Days (1989 film)|''The Final Days'' (1989 film)]]\n* [[The Post (film)|''The Post'' (2017 film)]]\n* [[All the Prime Minister's Men|''All the Prime Minister's Men'' (2021 documentary)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Goldman, William (1982).
