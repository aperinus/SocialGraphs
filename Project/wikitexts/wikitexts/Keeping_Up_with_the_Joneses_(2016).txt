He and his wife Karen live in a nice [[cul-de-sac]] with their two children, who are away at summer camp. They make the acquaintance of their new neighbors, Tim and Natalie Jones. Tim is a travel writer whose hobbies include [[glassblowing]], and Natalie is a social media consultant, cooking blogger and philanthropist. They are both impossibly good-looking, accomplished and stylish, yet overly friendly with the Gaffneys.\n\nKaren starts having suspicions about the Joneses when she catches Tim poking around Jeff's den during a neighborhood [[block party]], then witnesses Natalie doing what looks like a [[dead drop]] in a caf\u00e9. Karen follows Natalie to the mall, but Natalie confronts her in a dressing room, defusing the situation with some female bonding. Meanwhile, Tim invites Jeff to an underground Chinese restaurant, where Jeff drinks [[snake wine]] and is bitten by a severed snake head, forcing Tim to save his life. In exchange, Jeff takes Tim to [[vertical wind tunnel|indoor skydiving]], a passion of his that none of his friends share. All the way through, Tim tries to have Jeff talk about his coworkers at the office. One night, with the help of Natalie, Tim sneaks into the MBI building and looks over Jeff's emails.\n\nBack at their house, Jeff accidentally breaks the glass sculpture made by Tim that was given to them, revealing a [[covert listening device|bug]] among the shards. Realizing the Joneses are spies, Karen decides to sneak into their house to find more evidence. They discover files on Jeff and the other MBI employees and Jeff accidentally stuns Karen with a [[pen gun]]. They narrowly escape as the Joneses arrive. Natalie is worried Tim might be getting too close to Jeff, but they reveal they are in love with each other, which is also against the rules. Natalie notices the used pen gun on the floor, and they realize the Gaffneys had broken into their house.\n\nThe Gaffneys arrange a private meeting with MBI's head of security, Carl Pronger to expose the Joneses, but before Carl can disclose classified details, he is killed by a sniper who also attacks the Gaffneys. They are rescued by the Joneses and a high-speed chase and shootout ensue. The Gaffneys learn that the Joneses are actually trying to discover whether there is [[treason]] within MBI. Back in the cul-de-sac, Jeff gives Tim and Natalie some relationship advice and the two couples bond. After they return to their houses, the Joneses trigger a bomb that blows up their house alone.\n\nLater, after lying to the police about the Joneses, the Gaffneys are frantically preparing to go on the run when the Joneses reappear alive and well in their basement. They kidnapped Jeff's colleague Dan Craverston and his wife Meg, who are revealed to be trying to sell MBI's experimental microchips to an international arms dealer called \"The Scorpion\". When the Scorpion calls on Dan's phone, Jeff answers posing as Dan and arranges a meeting to deliver the microchips.\n\nJeff and Karen go to the hotel where the meeting takes place, while the Joneses back them up from the roof. The Scorpion turns out to be a former MBI employee named Bruce Springstine, who recognizes Jeff. With their cover blown, Tim radios for back-up, but the operation is aborted and the Gaffneys are declared collateral damage. The Joneses disobey orders and surrender to the Scorpion, but before the latter gets around to killing them, Karen is able to pass a knife to Natalie, giving the Joneses the opportunity to eliminate half of the Scorpion's henchmen. They escape by jumping out the window into a pool, just before the briefcase containing the chips is detonated by Natalie, and a bomb kills the Scorpion and his remaining henchmen. Proud of their new friends, the Joneses say goodbye and go back to their life of [[espionage]].\n\nThe next summer, the Gaffneys visit the caf\u00e9 in [[Marrakesh]] where the Joneses used to date and happen upon the Joneses who are in the middle of a new mission, accidentally blowing their cover and triggering yet another gunfight.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Jeff Gaffney\n* [[Jon Hamm]] as Tim Jones\n* [[Isla Fisher]] as Karen Gaffney\n* [[Gal Gadot]] as Natalie Jones\n* [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] as Dan Craverston\n* [[Maribeth Monroe]] as Meg Craverston\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Bruce Springstine / Scorpion\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Carl Pronger\n* [[Jona Xiao]] as Stacey Chung\n* [[Bobby Lee]] as Ricky Lu\n\n==Production==\nIn March 2014, it was announced that [[Greg Mottola]] would direct the film, from a screenplay by Michael LeSieur, with [[Fox 2000 Pictures]] having their eyes set on [[Jon Hamm]] and [[Zach Galifianakis]] to star, Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald producing under their [[Image Nation|Parkes + MacDonald Image Nation]] banner, and Marc Resteghini serving as an executive producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/03/fox-2000-sets-greg-mottola-to-helm-keeping-up-with-the-joneses-with-cast-circling-699385/|title=Fox 2000 Sets Greg Mottola To Helm 'Keeping Up With The Joneses' With Cast Circling|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Mike Jr.|last=Fleming|date=March 14, 2014|access-date=May 29, 2016}}</ref> In October 2014, [[Isla Fisher]] joined the cast of the film, and the casting of Hamm and Galifianakis was confirmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/isla-fisher-joins-jon-hamm-zach-galifianakis-in-keeping-up-with-the-joneses/|title=Isla Fisher Joins Jon Hamm, Zach Galifianakis in 'Keeping Up With the Joneses'|website=[[TheWrap]]|first=Linda|last=Ge|date=October 29, 2014|access-date=May 29, 2016}}</ref> In February 2015, [[Gal Gadot]] was in negotiations to star in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/02/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-keeping-up-with-the-joneses-1201378159/|title='Wonder Woman' Gal Gadot Circling 'Keeping Up With The Joneses'|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Mike Jr.|last=Fleming|date=February 20, 2015|access-date=May 29, 2016}}</ref> In April 2015, [[Maribeth Monroe]] and [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] also joined the cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/workaholics-veep-actors-join-keeping-786722|title='Workaholics,' 'Veep' Actors Join 'Keeping Up With the Joneses' (Exclusive)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Rebecca|last=Ford|date=April 7, 2015|access-date=May 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began on April 20, 2015 in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>{{cite news|title=On the Set for 4/20/15: Michael Bay Starts TMNT Sequel, Gal Gadot Begins Keeping Up With the Joneses, Natalie Dormer Wraps Shooting on Patient Zero|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-42015-michael-bay-starts-tmnt-sequel-gal-gadot-begins-keeping-up-with-the-joneses-natalie-dormer-wraps-shooting-on-patient-zero/|access-date=April 27, 2015|work=SSN Insider|author=SSN Insider Staff|date=April 20, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423153542/http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-42015-michael-bay-starts-tmnt-sequel-gal-gadot-begins-keeping-up-with-the-joneses-natalie-dormer-wraps-shooting-on-patient-zero/|archive-date=April 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released on April 1, 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/eddie-the-eagle-fox-taron-egerton-hugh-jackman-1201392499/|title='Eddie The Eagle' Has Landed At Fox; Biopic Starring Taron Egerton, Hugh Jackman Set For 2016|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Erik|last=Penderson|date=March 13, 2015|access-date=May 29, 2016}}</ref> but was pushed back to October 21, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/05/warner-bros-maze-runner-the-death-cure-dylan-obrien-1201764118/|title='Maze Runner: The Death Cure' Release Moved To 2018 As Dylan O'Brien Recovers|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Ross A.|last=Lincoln|date=May 27, 2016|access-date=May 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Keeping Up with the Joneses'' grossed $14.9 million in North America and $15 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $29.9 million, against a budget of $40 million.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\nThe film was expected to gross $7\u20139 million from about 3,022 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref name=preview>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-movie-projector-20161018-snap-story,amp.html |title='Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' to battle 'Ouija' sequel and 'Boo!
