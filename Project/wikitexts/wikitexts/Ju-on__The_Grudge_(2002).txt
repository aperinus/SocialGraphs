It is the third installment in the [[Ju-On (franchise)|''Ju-On'' series]] and the first to be released theatrically (the first two being direct-to-video productions). It stars [[Megumi Okina]], [[Misaki Ito]], [[Takashi Matsuyama (actor)|Takashi Matsuyama]], and [[Yui Ichikawa]].\n\n''Ju-On: The Grudge'' premiered at the [[Screamfest|Screamfest Film Festival]] on 18 October 2002, by [[Lions Gate Films]]. The film received favourable reviews from critics, but was unfavourably compared to another Japanese horror film, ''[[Ring (1998 film)|Ring]]''. It spawned [[Ju-On (franchise)|a franchise]], an [[The Grudge|American remake]], [[The Grudge 2|2006]] and [[The Grudge 3|2009]] sequels and a [[The Grudge (2020 film)|2020]] sidequel to the remake, and a prequel television series entitled ''[[JU-ON: Origins]]'' which premiered in 2020.\n\n==Plot ==\n{{hatnote|Below, the events of the film are in chronological order; however, the original film is presented in a nonlinear narrative.}}\n\nSeveral years prior to the main plot, [[Takeo Saeki]] murders his wife [[Kayako Saeki|Kayako]] after discovering she is in love with another man, also killing the family cat, Mar, and his son, [[Toshio Saeki|Toshio]]. The murders create a curse that revives the family as [[Onry\u014d|vengeful ghosts]], with Kayako's ghost murdering Takeo. Whoever enters their house in [[Nerima]], [[Tokyo]], is eventually consumed by the curse, which spreads to the place they die in and in turn consumes anyone who comes in.\n\nThe latest owners of the house are the Tokunaga family, consisting of [[salaryman]] Katsuya, his wife Kazumi, and his ill mother Sachie. Kazumi is quickly consumed by the curse, and Katsuya is emotionally affected by Takeo's personality before dying too. Katsuya's sister Hitomi dies shortly after Kayako's spirit follows her to her office and then her apartment.\n\n[[Social worker]] Rika is sent by her boss Hirohashi to care for Sachie. She discovers Toshio, and witnesses Sachie being killed by Kayako's ghost, causing her to faint. Hirohashi finds Rika and contacts the police. Detectives Nakagawa and Igarashi discover Katsuya's and Kazumi's bodies in the attic, and later learn of Hitomi's disappearance and the death of a security guard at her workplace. Hirohashi's body is discovered, and Rika is haunted by the ghosts.\n\nUpon researching the history of the house and the Saeki murders, Nakagawa and Igarashi contact a retired detective named Toyama, who is afraid of revisiting the case. Toyama goes to burn the house down but hears a group of teenage girls upstairs. One flees while the others are consumed. Kayako appears, chasing Toyama away but killing Nakagawa and Igarashi. Toyama eventually dies, leaving behind a daughter named Izumi. As a teenager, Izumi went to the house with her friends but fled while her friends were killed by Kayako; this was the event Toyama witnessed in the past.\n\nIzumi is wrought with guilt for abandoning her friends and becomes increasingly paranoid and unstable. Two of her other friends visit her and discover Izumi and her dead friends have their eyes blackened out in photos. Izumi encounters a vision of her dead father, then discovers the ghosts of her friends watching her. She is cornered by her dead friends, only for Kayako to appear and drag her into damnation.\n\nSome time after visiting the house, Rika has moved on with her life. Her friend Mariko, an elementary school teacher, pays a visit to Toshio, who is registered as her student but has never shown up for class. Rika races to save her but is too late. Kayako's ghost comes after her, and Rika witnesses Kayako briefly take on her appearance. She realizes that she is doomed to play out the curse and the same fate as Kayako. With Toshio watching from the banisters, Takeo\u2019s ghost descends the stairs and kills her.\n\nIn the deserted Tokyo streets, many missing persons posters lie on the ground. Rika's corpse, now with a much longer hairstyle similar to Kayako, lies in the house's attic, only to reawaken with a death rattle.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Megumi Okina]] as Rika Nishina\n* Misa Uehara as Izumi Toyama\n** Tomomi Kobayashi as Young Izumi \n* [[Misaki Ito]] as Hitomi Tokunaga\n* [[Yui Ichikawa]] as Chiharu\n* [[Takako Fuji]] as [[Kayako Saeki]]\n* Yuya Ozeki as [[Toshio Saeki]]\n* [[Takashi Matsuyama (actor)|Takashi Matsuyama]] as [[Takeo Saeki]]\n* [[Y\u014dji Tanaka]] as Y\u00fbji T\u00f4yama\n* [[Kanji Tsuda]] as Katsuya Tokunaga\n* Shuri Matsuda as Kazumi Tokunaga\n* [[Kayoko Shibata]] as Mariko Uki\n* Hirokazu Inoue as Detective Kenichi Nakagawa\n* Daisuke Honda as Detective Daisuke Igarashi\n* Risa Odagiri as Saori Takamiya \n* Kaori Nakaj\u00f4 as Chiaki Nakano\n* Kana Kobayashi as Ayano Muto\n* Yukako Kukuri as Miyuki\n* [[Hideo Sakaki]] as Welfare Center Clerk\n* Chikako Isomura as Sachie Tokunaga\n* [[Yoshiyuki Morishita]] as Security Guard \n* [[Miho Fujima]] as Joshi Ana\n* Isao Yatsu as Saito\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=May 2018}}\n''Ju-On: The Grudge'' was filmed entirely in Tokyo.<ref>{{cite web |date=February 18, 2018|url=https://the-irishman.com/15-famous-movies-filmed-tokyo-japan/|title=15 Famous Movies Filmed in Tokyo (Japan)|publisher=The Irishman.com|access-date=October 24, 2020}}</ref> Some critics have identified loose connections between the story in the film and the traditional Japanese folktale ''[[Yotsuya Kaidan]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/grudge-movie-ghost-origin-story-legend-explained/|title=The Grudge's Ghost Origin Story Explained|publisher=Screen Rant|author=28 December 2019|date=28 December 2019|access-date=5 November 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Remake==\n{{Main|The Grudge (2004 film)}}\nIn 2004, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] released an American [[The Grudge (2004 film)|remake]] of the film.
