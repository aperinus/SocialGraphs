Please do not add a single genre or repeating at cost. --> produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The film was directed by [[Pete Docter]], co-directed by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]] (in his [[directorial debut|feature directorial debut]]), and produced by [[Jonas Rivera]]. Docter and Peterson also wrote the film's screenplay and story, with [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Tom McCarthy]] co-writing the latter. The film stars the voices of [[Ed Asner]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Jordan Nagai]], and Peterson. The film centers on elderly widower Carl Fredricksen and Wilderness Explorer Russell, who go on a journey to South America in order to fulfill a promise that Carl made to his late wife Ellie. Along the way, they meet a talking dog named Dug, and encounter a giant bird named Kevin, who is being hunted by the explorer Charles Muntz who is Carl's childhood idol.\n\nOriginally titled ''Heliums'', Docter conceived the outline for ''Up'' in 2004 based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. Composer [[Michael Giacchino]] composed the film's score. It was Pixar's first film to be presented in [[3D film|3D]] format.\n\n''Up'' debuted at the [[62nd Cannes Film Festival]] on May 13, 2009, and was released in the United States on May 29. The film received critical acclaim from critics for its screenplay, animation, characters, themes, narrative, Asner's vocal performance, Giacchino's musical score, and the [[Up opening sequence|opening sequence]]. Organizations like the [[National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute]] named ''Up'' as one of the top 10 films of 2009. It earned $735.1 million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the [[2009 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2009]]. ''Up'' was nominated for five awards at the [[82nd Academy Awards]], winning two, and received [[List of accolades received by Up|numerous accolades]]. Among these, it became the second animated film in history to receive a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\n== Plot ==\n{{see also|Up opening sequence}}\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words.

After he is accused of presenting a fake giant bird skeleton from Paradise Falls in [[South America]], Muntz returns to the area intent on clearing his name by capturing a living specimen. Carl meets fellow Muntz fan Ellie, who confides her desire to move her \"clubhouse\"\u2014an abandoned house in the neighborhood\u2014to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls. The two later marry and live in the rebuilt house, with Carl working as a balloon salesman and Ellie a tour guide at the [[zoo]].

Years pass and Carl decides to arrange the trip as a surprise for Ellie. On the day that Carl plans to tell Ellie, she falls ill and is hospitalized, dying soon after.\n\nSome time later, a now-retired Carl stubbornly [[holdout (real estate)|holds out]] in the house while the neighborhood around him is replaced by skyscrapers. After Carl accidentally injures a construction worker during a mishap, the court deems him a public menace, requiring his relocation to an [[retirement home|assisted living facility]]. However, Carl resolves to keep Ellie's promise, turning his house into a makeshift airship using countless helium balloons and flying away. Russell, an eight-year-old \"Wilderness Explorer\" who visits Carl in an effort to earn his final [[scout badge|merit badge]] for assisting the elderly, becomes an accidental [[stowaway]]. Before Carl can land and send Russell home, they encounter a storm that propels the house to South America.\n\nThe house lands on a [[mesa]] opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a giant, colorful [[flightless bird]], whom he names Kevin. They then meet Dug, a [[Golden Retriever]] who wears a special collar with a device that translates his thoughts into English; he joins them on their trek.\n\nA [[pack (canine)|pack]] of fierce dogs led by the [[Dobermann|Doberman Pinscher]] Alpha take Carl, Russell, Dug, and Kevin to their master, the now elderly Charles Muntz. He invites them aboard his dirigible and talks about his search for the bird. Carl realizes Muntz\u2019s obsession with finding the bird has driven him mad, to the point of killing innocent travelers whom he suspected of seeking the bird for themselves. When Russell notes the skeleton's resemblance to Kevin, Muntz sees them as thieves and becomes hostile. The dogs pursue Carl, Russell, and Dug until Kevin saves them. Russell urges Carl to help Kevin get home and reunite with her chicks, but then Muntz captures her. He starts a fire beneath Carl's house, forcing him to choose whether to rescue it or Kevin; Carl chooses his home.\n\nAt the falls, Carl looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook and discovers that she filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage, accompanying a note written from her hospital bed, thanking him for the \"adventure\" and encouraging him to have a new one. Reinvigorated, he goes outside, only to see Russell set out after Kevin using a leaf blower and some balloons to fly. Carl lightens his house by throwing out furniture and keepsakes, allowing it to fly again. Muntz captures Russell, but Carl and Dug board the dirigible and free both Russell and Kevin. When Muntz pursues them to the tethered house, Carl lures Kevin back to the airship using a piece of chocolate. Muntz leaps after them, but his leg catches on balloon strings, and he falls to his death.<!-- The audio commentary confirms he died. --> The house descends out of sight, at which point Carl decides to let it go and live on the Spirit of Adventure with Russell and the pack of dogs.\n\nCarl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks before returning home in Muntz's airship. Russell finally receives his \"Assisting the Elderly\" badge, and Carl presents Russell with a grape soda bottle cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met, which he now dubs \"The Ellie Badge\". Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Carl, the house lands on the cliff beside Paradise Falls, fulfilling his promise to Ellie.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | footer = [[Ed Asner]] (left) in 2015 and [[Christopher Plummer]] in 2014\n   | image1 = Ed Asner 2015.jpg\n   | alt1 = Headshot of Ed Asner\n   | image2 = Christopher Plummer 2014.jpg\n   | alt2 = Headshot of Christopher Plummer\n  }}\n*[[Ed Asner]] as Carl Fredricksen.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Santos |first=Kara |date=August 30, 2021 |title=Ed Asner, voice of Carl Fredricksen in Pixar's 'Up,' passes away at 91 |url=https://philstarlife.com/geeky/407529-ed-asner-voice-of-carl-fredricksen-in-pixar-s-up-passes-away-at-91 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20211022084737/https://philstarlife.com/geeky/407529-ed-asner-voice-of-carl-fredricksen-in-pixar-s-up-passes-away-at-91 |archive-date=October 22, 2021 |access-date=October 22, 2021 |website=[[The Philippine Star]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Leopold |first=Todd |date=August 30, 2021 |title=Ed Asner, acclaimed 'Mary Tyler Moore Show' actor, dies at 91 |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/29/entertainment/ed-asner-death/index.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20211022084747/https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/29/entertainment/ed-asner-death/index.html |archive-date=October 22, 2021 |access-date=October 22, 2021 |website=[[CNN]] }}</ref> Docter and Rivera noted Asner's television alter ego, [[Lou Grant]], had been helpful in writing for Carl because it guided them in balancing likable and unlikable aspects of the curmudgeonly character.<ref name=\"slashvid\"/> The appearance of Carl was designed to resemble [[Spencer Tracy]] as he appeared in his final film, ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''.<ref name=\"exclaim\">{{cite news|last=Keast|first=James|title=Pixar Reveals Early Look At Up|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/pixar_reveals_early_look_at_up|access-date=November 22, 2013|newspaper=Exclaim!|date=February 6, 2009}}</ref> When they met Asner and presented him with a model of his character, he joked, \"I don't look anything like that.\" They tailored his dialogue for him, with short sentences and more [[consonant]]s, which \"cemented the notion that Carl, post-Ellie, is a disgruntled bear that's been poked awake during hibernation\".<ref name=time>{{cite news|last=Corliss|first=Richard|title=Up, Up and Away: Another New High for Pixar|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1896737,00.html|access-date=November 22, 2013|newspaper=Time|date=May 28, 2009|author-link=Richard Corliss}}</ref> \n*[[Christopher Plummer]] as Charles Muntz.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Agence France-Presse |author-link=Agence France-Presse |date=February 6, 2021 |title=Oscar-winning actor Christopher Plummer dead at 91 |url=https://mb.com.ph/2021/02/06/oscar-winning-actor-christopher-plummer-dead-at-91/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20211022084800/https://mb.com.ph/2021/02/06/oscar-winning-actor-christopher-plummer-dead-at-91/ |archive-date=October 22, 2021 |access-date=October 22, 2021 |website=[[Manila Bulletin]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Chang |first=Justin |author-link=Justin Chang |date=February 5, 2021 |title=From 'Sound of Music' to 'All the Money ...,' Christopher Plummer was irreplaceable |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-02-05/christopher-plummer-dead-critic-appreciation |url-access=limited |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20211022084810/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-02-05/christopher-plummer-dead-critic-appreciation |archive-date=October 22, 2021 |access-date=October 22, 2021 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref> The name of his airship, the ''Spirit of Adventure'', may have been inspired by [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s airplane, ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''.<ref name=\"notes\" /> In various interviews, Pete Docter has mentioned [[Howard Hughes]] and real-life adventurers [[Charles Lindbergh]] and [[Percy Fawcett]] as inspirations for Muntz.<ref name=\"empire\" /> Reviewers have noted his resemblance to [[Kirk Douglas]].<ref name=\"SlashfilmKirkDouglas\">{{Cite web|last=Connelly|first=Brendon|author-link=Brendon Connelly|date=2009-03-03|access-date=2022-10-27|website=Slashfilm|title=First Look At The Villain From Pixar's Up|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/502739/up-toys-give-us-our-first-look-at-the-villain/}}</ref><ref name=\"CartoonBrewKirkDouglas\">{{Cite web|last=Amidi|first=Amidi|author-link=Amid Amidi|date=2020-02-05|access-date=2022-10-27|website=Cartoon Brew|title=Kirk Douglas, RIP.

Docter was not concerned about an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl the way they relate to their grandparents.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n\nEarly concepts differed from the final film. The initial version featured a floating city on an alien planet populated with muppet-like creatures,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iml_slMLBUs#t=39m25s |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/iml_slMLBUs |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=PETE DOCTER - In Conversation With... - TIFF 2015|publisher=TIFF Originals|via=YouTube|date=June 19, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. But the story just didn't seem to work properly, and Docter and Peterson realized that the most intriguing element was the isolation of the floating city. Yet the people living there would consist of a whole community, and were therefore not really isolated. So the whole city was stripped down to a single flying house with just a single occupant, where balloons replaced the magic which kept the floating city up. After that they got the idea to use an old person, and found the contrast between the elderly grumpy man and the happy balloons in Docter's drawing appealing, inspiring them to work out his backstory. The next concept introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea [[Pixar]] was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but they decided this subplot was too distracting, and people would forgive the minor inconsistency.{{sfn|Catmull|Wallace|2014|pp=148\u2013150}}{{sfn|Hauser|2016|p=11}} Also, the biggest single influence on ''Up'' early on was ''[[The Station Agent]]'', by Tom McCarthy.{{sfn|Diamond|2019|p=121}}\n\nDocter noted the film reflects his friendships with Disney veterans [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], [[Ollie Johnston]], and [[Joe Grant]] (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them).

What Pete Docter wanted most importantly out of the music was the emotion, so Giacchino wrote a character theme-based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story. At the beginning of the movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is \"Muntz's Theme\", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70&nbsp;years later. \"Ellie's Theme\" is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement. Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that [[Thematic transformation|changes]] during a particular moment in the story.<ref name=\"allm\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r1590147 |title=Up <nowiki>[Original Score]</nowiki> |publisher=Allmusic.
