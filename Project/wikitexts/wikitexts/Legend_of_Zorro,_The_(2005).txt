It is the sequel to 1998's ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]''; [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] reprise their roles as the [[Zorro|titular hero]] and his spouse, Elena, and [[Rufus Sewell]] stars as the villain, Count Armand. The film takes place in [[San Mateo County, California]] and was shot in [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], Mexico, with second-unit photography in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0412/S00249.htm |title=The Legend Of Zorro To Shoot In New Zealand |publisher=Scoop|date=2004-12-16 |access-date=2015-08-27}}</ref> The film was theatrically released on October 28, 2005, by [[Columbia Pictures]] (instead of [[TriStar Pictures|TriStar]] due to Columbia holding the sequel rights to TriStar's pre-1999 film library), and earned $142.4 million on a $65 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1850, nine years after the events of [[The Mask of Zorro|the first film]], California is voting on whether to join the [[United States of America]] as a state. Alejandro Murrieta, now known as Don Alejandro De La Vega, foils a plot to steal the ballots, but during the fight with a gunman named Jacob McGivens, he briefly loses his mask. A pair of [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton agents]] see his face and recognize him. The following day, the agents confront Alejandro's wife, Elena, and blackmail her into divorcing him.\n\nThree months later, the separation from Elena and his son Joaquin, and the feeling that the people no longer need Zorro, are taking their toll on Alejandro. His childhood guardian, Father Felipe, convinces him to attend a party at French Count Armand's new vineyard. There, Alejandro discovers that Elena is dating the count, an admirer from her time spent in Europe. After leaving the party, Alejandro witnesses a huge explosion close to Armand's mansion and becomes suspicious of him.\n\nMcGivens leads an attack on the family of Guillermo Cortez, Alejandro's friend, to seize their land deed. Donning his mask again, Zorro succeeds in rescuing Guillermo's wife and son, but fails to save Guillermo and the deed. Zorro follows McGivens to Armand's mansion and discovers that Armand plans to build a railroad on Cortez's land. He also encounters Elena and, learning of an upcoming shipment, he tracks McGivens to a [[cove]] where the cargo is delivered. Unbeknownst to him, Joaquin also hitched a ride on McGiven's cart, having snuck out of a class field trip. Zorro saves his son from the bandits and, examining the shipment, he sees a piece of the cargo - a bar of soap - and the phrase ''Orbis Unum'' meaning ''One World'' in Latin on a crate lid. Upon researching the phrase, Felipe and Alejandro learn that Armand is the head of a secret society, the Knights of Aragon, which has been secretly ruling Europe. The United States is deemed a threat to the Knights, so they plan to throw the country into chaos before it can gain too much power.\n\nAlejandro is captured and imprisoned by the Pinkertons, who reveal that they forced Elena to divorce Alejandro in order to get close to Armand and learn of his plans without the aid of Zorro as they dislike his vigilante ways and due to their own lack of legal authority to search Armand's home due to California not yet being a U.S. state. Joaquin frees Alejandro from captivity. Zorro goes to Armand's mansion, meets Elena, and eavesdrops on Armand's meeting. Elena, in order to distract Armand, brings him to terrace, & throws keys to armand's vault to Alejandro, as Armand kisses Elena. After accessing secret documents, Alejandro learns that the [[Glycerin soap|soap bars]] are secretly used as [[Glycerol#Explosive|an ingredient]] for [[nitroglycerin]], which Armand plans to distribute throughout the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]], with the help of Confederate Colonel Beauregard, to destroy the Union. Zorro and Elena reconcile, and Zorro prepares to destroy the train carrying the explosives. McGivens arrives at Felipe's church to look for Zorro. Unable to find him, McGivens shoots the priest and kidnaps Joaquin.\n\nMeanwhile, however, Armand's butler Ferroq tracks down and kills the Pinkertons and informs his master about Elena's deception. Armand confronts Elena, and takes her and Joaquin hostage on the train carrying the explosives, making Zorro unable to destroy it. Zorro is captured and unmasked in front of his son. Armand takes Joaquin and Elena away and orders McGivens to kill Alejandro. Felipe, having been saved from McGivens's bullet by the cross he wears, arrives, and he and Alejandro overpower and kill McGivens.\n\nZorro catches up with Armand, and they engage in a sword fight. Meanwhile, Elena has Joaquin escape into the back cars of the train, which she disconnects. Elena fights Ferroq in the nitro storage car and throws him and a bottle of nitro out of the car and at the feet of Colonel Beauregard at their prearranged meeting point, killing them. Further along the tracks, the governor prepares to sign the bill to make California a Union state. Joaquin collects Tornado, Zorro's horse, jumps off the train, and overtakes it. He hits a track switch, causing the train to harmlessly pass around the ceremony. Zorro and Armand's duel takes them to the very front of the train engine. Seeing the track is a dead end, Zorro hooks Armand to the train by tying him up on the front of the engine and escapes with Elena. The train crashes into the pile of rails at the end of the track, setting off the nitroglycerin, killing Armand and destroying the train.\n\nWith Zorro as an official witness, the governor signs the bill, and California becomes the 31st state of the United States of America. Felipe remarries Alejandro and Elena, and Alejandro apologizes to his son for hiding his identity, admitting that Zorro's identity is a family secret rather than just his own. With Elena's support, Zorro rides off on Tornado to his next mission.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as [[Zorro|Don Alejandro de la Vega / Zorro]]\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as [[Elena Montero|El\u00e9na de la Vega]]\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as Count Armand\n* [[Nick Chinlund]] as Jacob McGivens\n* [[Adri\u00e1n Alonso]] as Joaquin de la Vega\n* [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]] as Padre Felipe\n* [[Shuler Hensley]] as Pike\n* [[Michael Emerson]] as Harrigan\n* [[Leo Burmester]] as [[P.

This was changed to the theatrical ending in order to allow for future sequels with Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, something that never happened.\n\n==Historical references==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Bear Point.jpg|thumb|150px|upright| The fictional Bear Point, as seen in the film.]]\n\n''The Legend of Zorro'' continues its predecessor's inclusion of Spanish historical elements of California history into the fiction, though many liberties have been taken. Alejandro, the Mexican-born Californian who became Zorro at the end of ''The Mask of Zorro'', is a fictional brother to [[Joaquin Murrieta]], for whom the character's son Joaquin is named. Military governor [[Bennet Riley]], the last of California's heads of state prior to statehood, is portrayed, but the Maryland-born American is played by the Mexican actor [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz Jr.]] who speaks English with a Hispanic accent. [[Leo Burmester]] plays R. S. Beauregard, a Confederate colonel whose character is not to be confused with the historical [[P. G. T. Beauregard]]. Pedro Mira plays a pre-Presidential [[Abraham Lincoln]] as an observer to California's statehood, though the real Lincoln never traveled to the region. The film also features a fictional monument called Bear Point, commemorating the site where the original [[Flag of California|Bear Flag]] of the [[California Republic]] flew briefly in 1846. Although the actual flag flew in [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]], the film suggests that Bear Point is located in [[San Mateo County]].\n\n''The Legend of Zorro'', which takes place in 1850, includes a significant number of deviations from national history as well, particularly in depicting an organized [[Confederate States of America]] and a presumed completed [[First transcontinental railroad]], each more than a decade before their times. Additional deviations include a quote from the ''[[Gettysburg Address]]'', which would not be written until 1863. A map discovered by Zorro delineates two states (Arizona and New Mexico) that did not achieve statehood until 1912; several other states depicted on the map entered into the Union long after California. The film also features characters who identify themselves as agents of the [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton Detective Agency]], which had been established in the year 1850 but was known at the time as the North-Western Police Agency.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Horan|first1=James David|last2=Swigget|first2=Howard|title=The Pinkerton Story|date=1951|publisher=Putam|page=202}}</ref>\n\nA deleted scene on the film's DVD features a short discussion on a [[magic lantern]] presentation.\n\nThe use of the Henry repeating rifle by Jacob McGivens is a mistake, it was introduced in the early 1860s and produced through 1866.\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Legend of Zorro: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = film\n| artist     = [[James Horner]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = October 25, 2005\n| recorded   = 2004\u20132005\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 75:34\n| label      = Sony\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[James Horner]]\n| prev_title = [[Flightplan#Soundtrack|Flightplan]]\n| prev_year  = 2005\n| next_title = [[The New World (2005 film)#Soundtrack|The New World]]\n| next_year  = 2005\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=3897 SoundtrackNet]\n|rev1score = {{rating|3.5|5}}\n}}\n\n;Track listing \n{{tracklist\n| headline        =\n| writing_credits =\n| title1          = Collecting the Ballots\n| length1         = 3:27\n| title2          = Stolen Votes\n| length2         = 6:31\n| title3          = To the Governor's...
