Pictures]]. It is the [[sequel]] to the 2009 film ''[[The Hangover]]'' and the second installment in [[The Hangover (film series)|''The Hangover'' trilogy]]. Directed by [[Todd Phillips]], who co-wrote the script with [[Craig Mazin]] and [[Scot Armstrong]], the film stars [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Ed Helms]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Ken Jeong]], [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Justin Bartha]], and [[Paul Giamatti]].\n\nIt tells the story of Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug as they travel to [[Thailand]] for Stu's wedding. After the bachelor party in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Stu takes no chances and opts for a safe, subdued pre-wedding brunch. Things do not go as planned, resulting in another bad hangover with no memories of the previous night.\n\nDevelopment began in April 2009, two months before ''The Hangover'' was released. The principal actors were cast in March 2010 to reprise their roles from the first film. Production began in October 2010, in [[Ontario, California]], before moving on location in Thailand. The film was released on May 26, 2011, and became the highest-grossing R-rated comedy during its theatrical run, but received mixed reviews. \n\nA third and final installment, ''[[The Hangover Part III]]'', was released on May 23, 2013.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\">{{cite web |date=2012-09-10 |title=The Hangover Part III Details Revealed as Production Begins |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=94586 |work=[[ComingSoon.net]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912051550/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=94586 |archive-date=2012-09-12 |access-date=2012-09-10 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nTwo years after the [[The Hangover#Plot|events in]] [[Las Vegas]], Stu Price travels to [[Thailand]] for his upcoming wedding to Lauren, his fianc\u00e9e, along with his three best friends, Doug Billings, Phil Wenneck and Alan Garner. Much to Alan's dismay, they are joined by Lauren's younger brother, a [[Stanford University]] [[scholar]] named Teddy. At the rehearsal dinner, Lauren's father reveals his disapproval of Stu during a toast. Later that night, Stu hesitantly joins Phil, Doug, Alan and Teddy for a beer. Sitting at a campfire and roasting [[marshmallow]]s, the group toast to Stu and Lauren's future happiness.\n\nThe next day, Phil, Stu and Alan awaken in a dilapidated hotel room in [[Bangkok]]. Stu has a face tattoo (a replica of [[Mike Tyson]]'s) and Alan's head is completely shaved. They meet a chain-smoking [[capuchin monkey]] and discover that their old 'friend', Chinese gangster Leslie Chow, followed them to Thailand on Alan's invitation. They cannot find Teddy, and discover only his severed finger. Chow begins to relay the events of the prior night, but he seemingly dies after snorting a line of [[cocaine]]. Panicked, the trio disposes of Chow's body in the hotel's ice box.\n\nThrough a tip from Doug (who left the campfire earlier and stayed at the resort), they go to a police station to pick up Teddy, but are given a wheelchair containing an elderly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monk]]. He refuses to reveal anything, having taken a [[vow of silence]]. After finding a business card, they travel to the smoldering ruins of the business.\n\nThey enter a nearby tattoo parlor where Stu got his tattoo, and they learn that they started a fight that escalated into a riot. The trio returns the monk to his temple, where they are encouraged by the head monk to [[meditate]]. Alan manages to recall that they had been at a [[strip club]], where they learn that Stu engaged in [[sexual intercourse]] with a [[trans woman]]. Upon exiting, the trio is attacked by two [[Russian mob]]sters who take the monkey, and one shoots Phil in his arm.\n\nAfter Phil is treated at a clinic, Alan confesses that he had drugged some of the marshmallows from the previous night with [[muscle relaxer]]s and his [[ADHD]] medication in order to sedate Teddy, as he feared the others were going to replace him, but accidentally mixed up the bags. Phil and Stu become furious that Alan drugged them again. Stu blames Alan for ruining his life and attacks him, but Phil breaks it up and tells them that they have to stick together. They notice something on Alan's stomach: an address and a time for a meeting. They meet a gangster named Kingsley, who demands Chow's bank account password by the following morning in exchange for Teddy. They return to the hotel to try to find Chow's password, only to discover that he is still alive. They steal the monkey, who had the code given to him and put inside his vest for safe-keeping by Chow, back from the Russian mobsters through a violent car chase, during which the monkey is shot and injured.\n\nAfter taking the code and leaving the monkey outside a [[veterinary]] clinic, the group completes the deal with Kingsley the next morning. [[Interpol]] agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that he does not actually know where Teddy is.\n\nDesperate, Phil calls Doug's wife Tracy to tell her they cannot find Teddy. Stu decides to call off the wedding, live in Bangkok and say that Teddy died. During a [[rolling blackout]], Stu realizes where Teddy is. The trio rushes back to the hotel to find Teddy who is in the elevator (though is still missing a finger). Teddy had woken up earlier than the others, but became trapped after the power went out when he went to get ice for his finger. The four use Chow's speedboat to travel back to the wedding reception.\n\nArriving just as Lauren's father is about to cancel the wedding, Stu makes a defiant speech, and rejects being a boring dentist and instead insists he is quite wild. Impressed, Lauren's father gives the couple his blessing. Alan presents Stu with a special gift at the reception: a musical guest performance by Mike Tyson. Teddy later discovers that he had taken many pictures during the night on his cell phone before the battery died. The group, along with Tyson, agree to look at the pictures together once before deleting them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Phil Wenneck,<ref name=\"Cast\"/> a teacher, the leader of the Wolfpack\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Dr. Stu Price,<ref name=\"Cast\"/> a dentist traveling to Thailand to get married\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Alan Garner,<ref name=\"Cast\"/> brother-in-law to Doug, idolizes Phil\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Leslie Chow<ref name=\"Jeong\" />\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Sid Garner<ref name=\"Tambor\">{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Owen |date=2011-02-25 |title=The Hangover 2 Teaser Online |url=https://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=30263 |access-date=2011-02-25 |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]}}</ref>\n* [[Justin Bartha]] as Doug Billings<ref name=\"Cast\"/>\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Kingsley/Detective Peters, an undercover [[Interpol]] agent<ref name=\"Giamatti\" />\n* [[Jamie Chung]] as Lauren Srisai, Stu's fianc\u00e9e<ref name=\"Chung\" /><ref name=\"Mason\">{{cite web |date=2011-05-19 |title=Nerves of Steel: interview with Mason Lee |url=http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?nerves_of_steel_interview_with_mason_lee_16753.aspx |publisher=Asia Pacific Arts |access-date=May 19, 2011 |archive-date=July 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720225137/http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?nerves_of_steel_interview_with_mason_lee_16753.aspx |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Sasha Barrese]] as Tracy Billings, Doug's wife\n* [[Mason Lee]] as Teddy Srisai, Lauren's brother<ref name=\"Mason\" />\n* [[Gillian Vigman]] as Stephanie Wenneck, Phil's wife\n* [[Bryan Callen]] as Samir, a strip club owner in Bangkok<ref name=\"Callen\"/>\n* [[Sondra Currie]] as Linda Garner, Tracy's and Alan's mother\n* [[Yasmin Lee]] as Kimmy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://translabyrinth.com/interview-with-transsexual-actress-yasmin-lee-hangover-2/|title=Interview with transsexual actress Yasmin Lee (Hangover 2)}}</ref>\n* [[Nirut Sirijanya]] as Fong Srisai, Lauren's father\n* [[Penpak Sirikul]] as Joi\n* [[Crystal the Monkey]] as The Drug-Dealing Monkey\n\n[[Mike Tyson]] reprises his role as himself and sings a cover of the 1984 [[Murray Head]] song \"[[One Night in Bangkok]]\" for the movie.<ref name=\"Tyson\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/atlantic/20110521/en_atlantic/miketysonhangoversequelslowestpaidstar38006 |title=Mike Tyson: 'Hangover' Sequel's Lowest Paid Star? |author=Ujala Sehgal |publisher=Yahoo!}}</ref> The film is the Hollywood debut of Mason Lee, son of director [[Ang Lee]].<ref name=\"Mason\"/> [[Nick Cassavetes]] has a [[cameo appearance]] as a Bangkok tattoo artist.
