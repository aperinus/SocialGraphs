Leonard]] and produced by [[Hunt Stromberg]]. It stars [[William Powell]] as the theatrical [[impresario]] [[Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.|Florenz \"Flo\" Ziegfeld Jr.]], [[Luise Rainer]] as [[Anna Held]], and [[Myrna Loy]] as [[Billie Burke]].\n\nThe film, shot at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studios in [[Culver City, California]] in the fall of 1935, is a fictionalized and sanitized tribute to [[Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.]] and a cinematic adaptation of Broadway's [[Ziegfeld Follies]], with highly elaborate costumes, dances and sets. Many of the performers of the theatrical Ziegfeld Follies were cast in the film as themselves, including [[Fanny Brice]] and [[Harriet Hoctor]], and the real Billie Burke acted as a supervisor for the film. The \"[[A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody]]\" set alone was reported to have cost US$220,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|220000|1936}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}),{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}} featuring a towering rotating volute of {{convert|70| ft|abbr=on}} diameter with 175 spiral steps, weighing 100 tons. The music to the film was provided by [[Walter Donaldson]], [[Irving Berlin]], and lyricist [[Harold Adamson]], with choreographed scenes. The extravagant costumes were designed by [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], taking some 250 tailors and seamstresses six months to prepare them using {{convert|50|lb}} of silver sequins and {{convert|12|yd|m}} of white ostrich plumes.<ref>The statement about ostrich plumes is incorrect. Perhaps the source said that a single costume in the film used 36 feet of ostrich plumes? Unfortunately, without a citation, there is no way to check.</ref>  Over a thousand people were employed in the production of the film, which required 16 reels of film after the cutting.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n\nOne of the biggest successes in film in the 1930s and the pride of MGM at the time, it was acclaimed as the greatest musical biography to be made in Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making. It won three [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] for producer [[Hunt Stromberg]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for [[Luise Rainer]], and [[Academy Award for Best Dance Direction|Best Dance Direction]] for [[Seymour Felix]], and was nominated for four others. \n\nMGM made two more ''Ziegfeld'' films \u2013 one titled ''[[Ziegfeld Girl (film)|Ziegfeld Girl]]'' (1941), starring [[James Stewart]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Lana Turner]], which recycled some footage from ''The Great Ziegfeld'', and in 1946, ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' by [[Vincente Minnelli]]. In 1951, the studio produced a Technicolor remake of ''[[Show Boat]]'', which Ziegfeld had presented as a stage musical.\n\n==Plot==\nThe son of a highly respected music professor, [[Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.|Florenz \"Flo\" Ziegfeld Jr.]] yearns to make his mark in show business. He begins by promoting [[Eugen Sandow]], the \"world's strongest man\", at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 Chicago World's Fair]], overcoming the competition of rival Jack Billings and his popular attraction, belly dancer [[Little Egypt (dancer)#Farida Mazar Spyropoulos|Little Egypt]], with savvy marketing (allowing women to feel Sandow's muscles).\n\nZiegfeld returns to his father and young Mary Lou at the [[Chicago Musical College]], and departs to San Francisco, where he and Sandow are deemed frauds for putting on a show in which Sandow faces a lion who falls asleep as soon as it is let out of the cage. Flo travels to England on an ocean liner, where he runs into Billings again who is laughing at a newspaper article denouncing him as a fraud.\n\nFlo discovers that Billings is on his way to sign a contract with beautiful French star [[Anna Held]]. Despite losing all his money gambling at Monte Carlo, Flo charms Anna into signing with him instead, pretending that he doesn't know Billings. Anna twice almost sends him away for his rudeness and for being broke, before revealing that she appreciates his honesty. Ziegfeld promises to give her \"more publicity than she ever dreams of\" and to feature her alongside America's most prominent theatrical performers.\n\nAt first, Anna's performance at the [[Herald Square Theatre]] is not a success. However, Flo manages to generate publicity by sending 20 gallons of milk to Anna every day for a fictitious milk bath beauty treatment, then refusing to pay the bill. The newspaper stories soon bring the curious to pack his theater, and Ziegfeld introduces eight new performers to back her. Audience members comment on how the milk must make her skin beautiful and the show is a major success. Flo sends Anna flowers and jewelry and a note saying \"you were magnificent my wife\", and she agrees to marry him, flaunting her new diamonds to her fellow performers.\n\nHowever, one success is not enough for the showman. He has an idea for an entirely new kind of show featuring a bevy of blondes and brunettes, one that will \"glorify\" the American girl. The new show, the ''Ziegfeld Follies'', an opulent production filled with beautiful women and highly extravagant costumes and sets, is a smash hit, and is followed by more versions of the Follies.\n\nZiegfeld tries to make a star out of Audrey Dane, who is plagued with alcoholism, and he lures [[Fanny Brice]] from [[vaudeville]], showering both with lavish gifts. He gives stagehand [[Ray Bolger]] his break as well. Mary Lou, now a young woman, visits Ziegfeld, who doesn't recognize her initially, and hires her as a dancer.\n\nThe new production upsets Anna, who realizes that Flo's world does not revolve around just her, and she becomes envious of the attention he pays to Audrey. She divorces him after walking in on Flo and a drunk Audrey at the wrong moment. Audrey walks out on Flo and the show after an angry confrontation. Broke, Flo borrows money from Billings for a third time for the new show.\n\nFlo meets the red-headed Broadway star [[Billie Burke]] and soon marries her. When she hears the news, a heartbroken Anna telephones Flo and pretends to be glad for him. Flo and Billie eventually have a daughter named [[Patricia Ziegfeld Stephenson|Patricia]].\n\nFlo's new shows are a success, but after a while, the public's taste changes, and people begin to wonder if the times have not passed him by. After a string of negative reviews in the press, Flo overhears three men in a barber's shop saying that he'll \"never produce another hit\". Stung, he vows to have ''four'' hits on Broadway at the same time.\n\nHe achieves his goal, with the hits ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927), ''[[Rio Rita (musical)|Rio Rita]]'' (1927), ''[[Whoopee!]]'' (1928), and ''[[The Three Musketeers (musical)|The Three Musketeers]]'', and invests over $1 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1929}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) of his earnings in the stock market. However, the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] bankrupts him, forcing Billie to return to the stage.\n\nShaken by the reversal of his financial fortunes and the growing popularity of movies over live stage shows, he becomes seriously ill. Billings pays him a friendly visit, and the two men agree to become partners in a new, even grander production of ''The Ziegfeld Follies''. But the reality is that both men are broke and Ziegfeld realizes this. In the final scene in his apartment overlooking the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|Ziegfeld Theatre]], in a half-delirium, he recalls scenes from several of his hits, exclaiming, \"I've got to have more steps, higher, higher\", before dying in his chair.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=28em}}\n* [[William Powell]] as [[Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.]]\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as [[Billie Burke]]\n* [[Luise Rainer]] as [[Anna Held]]\n* [[Frank Morgan]] as Jack Billings\n* [[Fanny Brice|Fannie Brice]] as Herself\n* [[Virginia Bruce]] as Audrey Dane\n* [[Reginald Owen]] as Sampson\n* [[Ray Bolger]] as Himself\n* [[Ernest Cossart]] as Sidney\n* [[Joseph Cawthorn]] as Dr. Ziegfeld\n* [[Nat Pendleton]] as [[Eugen Sandow|Sandow]]\n* [[Harriet Hoctor]] as Herself\n* Jean Chatburn as Mary Lou\n* [[Robert Greig]] as Butler  \n* [[Herman Bing]] as Costumer\n* [[Charles Judels]] as Pierre\n* [[Marcelle Corday]] as Marie\n* [[Raymond Walburn]] as Sage\n* A.

As a result, the film went into the pre-production phase in January 1934.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}} Macguire had initially proposed the biographical film to them in the form of a \"filmusical entertainment\" set in a \"theatrical tradition\" and William Powell was cast as Ziegfeld. However, by February 1935, Macguire had fallen into disagreement with Universal over financial problems at the studio,{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}} and the entire production, including some already constructed sets and musical arrangements, was sold to MGM for US$300,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|1935}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). As part of the deal however, Universal retained the services of Powell for the classic screwball comedy ''[[My Man Godfrey]]'', which was released the same year as ''The Great Ziegfeld''.{{sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}}{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}}\n\nThe film was shot at MGM Studios in Culver City, California mostly in the latter half of 1935 under a budget of US$1,500,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500000|1935}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), produced by [[Hunt Stromberg]].{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}}<ref name=Media>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1936/film/reviews/the-great-ziegfeld-2-1200411276/|title=Review: \"The Great Ziegfeld\"|work=Variety|date=April 15, 1936|access-date=August 19, 2013}}</ref> The cost exceeded US$2 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1935}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) by the end of the production in early 1936,<ref>Hanie, Jonathan, ''Great Ziegfeld \u2013 Mesmerizing Best Picture of 1936'', ''Orlando Movie Examiner'', Retrieved on August 25, 2013</ref> exorbitant for the period, and it was MGM's most expensive film to date after ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (1925).{{Sfn|Bryant|2006|p=105}} The principal cinematography was shot by [[Oliver T.

Gray (film editor)|William S.

Nugent of ''The New York Times'' said of the script: \"What William Anthony McGuire has attempted in his screen play, and with general success, is to encompass not merely the fantastic personal history of Ziegfeld but the cross-sectional story of the development of the Follies, the Midnight Frolic on the New Amsterdam Roof and the other theatrical enterprises floated under the Glorifier's aegis during a span of about forty years. The two biographies\u2014of the man and of his creations\u2014are, naturally, inseparable; but both have been told with such wealth of detail and circumstance (real and imaginative) that even the three-hour film narrative is fragmentary and, in some places, confused.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web|author=Nugent, Frank S.|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9802E4DE133FEE3BBC4153DFB266838D629EDE|title=The Great Ziegfeld (1936)|work=The New York Times |date=April 9, 1936|access-date=August 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it has some accuracies, ''The Great Ziegfeld'' takes many key liberties with Ziegfeld's life and the history of the ''Follies'', resulting in many inaccuracies.<ref name=Turner/> The earlier scenes with Sandow, the milk bath advertising scenario, and many other sequences including several of the dramatic ups and downs of the film were fictional.<ref name=Media/> [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' was never featured in the ''Follies'', and the number \"A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody\" was written for the 1919 ''Follies'',{{sfn|Merwe|2009|p=138}} not the first edition of the revue, as shown in the film. Ray Bolger was never cast in a \"Follies\" show,<ref name=Turner/> and although she was born in the U.S, Billie Burke grew up in England and spoke with a [[Mid-Atlantic accent]] throughout her life; Loy who portrays her clearly has an American accent in the film.{{sfn|Hayter-Menzies|2009|p=64}}\n\nIn the film, the last few lines of the song \"[[Ol' Man River]]\" (from ''Show Boat'') are sung by what sounds like a tenor, while the song was intended for bass [[Paul Robeson]] and sung in the original production by bass-baritone [[Jules Bledsoe]].{{Sfn|Boyle|Bunie|2005|p=253}} Further, the screenplay also gives the impression that the successful original production of ''[[Show Boat]]'', which Ziegfeld produced, closed because of the [[Great Depression]]. In fact ''Show Boat'' ended its original 1927 run in the spring of 1929 and the stock market crash did not occur until October of that year. It was the 1932 revival of the show (also produced by Ziegfeld shortly before his death), not the original production, that was affected by the Depression.{{sfn|Jones|2003|p=82}}\n\nIn real life, Ziegfeld did not die in his room at the [[Warwick New York Hotel|Hotel Warwick]] (not mentioned) which stood in front of the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|Ziegfeld Theatre]]; he actually died in Los Angeles and had not even spent his last years in New York.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=180}} However, McGuire did capture a number of Ziegfeld's traits, such as sending telegrams to people even in close proximity, his belief that elephants were a symbol of good luck, his exquisite taste in costumes and design, and perfectionism over his productions, especially lighting and rostrum pedestaling.<ref name=Media/> McGuire's script, now in the Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino, California, is dated September 21, 1935, probably the date when it was finalized.{{sfn|Smyth|2006|p=544}}\n\n===Casting===\n \nInitially, the main cast proposed for the film included [[Marilyn Miller]], [[Gilda Gray]], [[Ann Pennington (actress)|Ann Pennington]], and [[Leon Errol]].{{sfn|Green|1999|p=54}} Featured in the film are [[William Powell]] as Ziegfeld, [[Myrna Loy]] as Billie Burke, [[Luise Rainer]] as [[Anna Held]], [[Nat Pendleton]] as Eugen Sandow, and [[Frank Morgan]]. Powell admitted to being \"amazed\" with the film after viewing it and was very grateful at having had the privilege to portray Ziegfeld, considering it to be a very important moment in his career. He said \"After seeing this film I can see that most of the characters I have played before were contrived. They had no 'folks', as the character of Ziegfeld had in this picture. Their father was a pen and their mother was a bottle of ink. Here was a character with flesh, blood and sinews. I felt for the first time in my acting career I had tried the full measure of a man, regardless of my shortcomings in playing him.\"{{Sfn|Bryant|2006|p=108}}\n\nMany of the performers of the earlier Broadway version of the Ziegfeld Follies were cast in the film as themselves, including [[Fanny Brice]] and [[Harriet Hoctor]], the ballet dancer and contortionist.<ref name=Kindler>{{Cite web|url=http://thekindleroscarchronicles.com/2012/03/21/9-the-great-ziegfeld-1936/|title=The Kindler Oscar Chronicles|work=9.

However, according to Emily W. Leider, Burke was not keen on playing her younger self and says that Billie Burke's biographer stated that [[Miriam Hopkins]] would have been her first choice to play her part, not Loy.{{Sfn|Leider|2011|p=178}} Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did not object to Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio's refusal to give her the higher billing and salary she had demanded, which led to Miller walking away from the film.{{Sfn|Parish|Pitts|1992|p=221}}{{sfn|Hanson|2011|p=179}}\n\nBoth Miller and [[Lillian Lorraine]] threatened legal action if their names were so much as mentioned in the film.{{sfn|Hanson|2011|p=179}} Thus Miller's character was renamed Sally Manners, and Lorraine's character was renamed Audrey Dane (played by [[Virginia Bruce]]). In real life, Ziegfeld reportedly was obsessed with Miller, and was involved in numerous sex scandals.{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=164}} In 1922, Miller had given an interview in which she accused him of \"making love to chorus girls\" and sending her a diamond ring as \"big as her hand\";{{Sfn|Mizejewski|1999|p=164}} this essence of Ziegfeld's character is captured in the film. Incidentally, Miller died from toxicity complications after surgery just before the release of the film on April 7, 1936,{{Sfn|Vogel|2007|p=126}} which led one reviewer writing in ''Liberty'' to denounce an urban legend which had arisen surrounding the timing of her death, writing \"It's not true that Marilyn Miller died of a broken heart at not getting the lead in this.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Another myth surrounding her untimely death at the age of 37 is that she had contracted syphilis.{{Sfn|Vogel|2007|p=126}}\n\nFrank Morgan, a stage and film character actor, played the role of promoter Billings in the film.{{sfn|Hischak|2008|p=506}} [[Dennis Morgan]], in an uncredited role, performs in \"[[A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody]]\" (dubbed by [[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]]).
