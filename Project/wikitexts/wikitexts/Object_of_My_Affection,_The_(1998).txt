The film was adapted from the [[The Object of My Affection (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Stephen McCauley]] and the screenplay was written by [[Wendy Wasserstein]]. The story concerns a pregnant New York social worker who develops romantic feelings for her [[gay]] new friend and decides to raise her child with him, and the complications that ensue.\n\nIt was filmed in 1997 in various locations around [[New York City]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Connecticut]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120772/locations IMDb.com filming locations \u2013 ''The Object of My Affection'']</ref> The film received mixed reviews and was a moderate box office success grossing $46.9 million against a production budget of $15 million.\n\n==Plot==\nSocial worker Nina Borowski ([[Jennifer Aniston]]) is a bright young woman living in a cozy [[Brooklyn]] apartment. Nina attends a party given by her [[stepsister]] Constance ([[Allison Janney]]) and her husband, Sidney ([[Alan Alda]]). There Nina meets George Hanson ([[Paul Rudd]]), a young, handsome, and gay first grade teacher. Nina tells George that her stepsister is constantly trying to fix her up with somebody from higher society, completely ignoring the fact that Nina has a boyfriend, Vince ([[John Pankow]]). During the conversation, Nina offers George a room in her apartment as she has just heard from his boyfriend, Dr. Robert Joley ([[Tim Daly]]), that George is looking for somewhere to live. George, not knowing about Robert's plans, is taken aback and heartbroken, and after the party the two split up. George accepts Nina's offer and moves into her apartment.\n\nThe two soon become best friends; they watch films together and go [[ballroom dancing]]. Everything is great until Nina announces that she is pregnant. Vince, the baby's father, wants to marry her, but his constant control drives Nina crazy; she leaves him and George offers to help raise her child. For some time, they live together in her apartment in Brooklyn. Everything is perfect again until Nina finds that her love for George is growing every day, especially after he tells her he had a girlfriend in high school, leading her to believe they might develop a romantic relationship.\n\nOne afternoon, George and Nina are about to have sex when George gets a phone call from Robert who tells him how much he has missed him and invites him away for the weekend. George is confused but agrees to go. Nina feels threatened and gets jealous. George and Robert do not re-establish their relationship, but George meets Paul James (Amo Gulinello), a young actor, and the two are attracted to each other and have sex. Meanwhile, Nina is staying with Constance at a vacation mansion and is extremely moody. She has a horrible time and decides to head back home and asks George to return as well. Her purse is snatched on the way and a friendly police officer, Louis ([[Kevin Carroll (actor)|Kevin Carroll]]), gives her a ride home.\n\nNina decides to invite Paul and his older acting mentor with whom he lives, Rodney ([[Nigel Hawthorne]]), for [[Thanksgiving]] after a rather prickly brunch with a late arriving George, and his brother and his brother's latest fianc\u00e9e. After the evening winds down, Paul stays the night with George, resulting in a heated argument between George and Nina, and heartache for Rodney.\n\nAt George's brother's wedding, they continue their discussion as Nina has begun to realize the reality of the situation. Nina fully explains to George her feelings for him. George, who loves Nina as his best friend, tells her that, ultimately, he wants to be with Paul. A few hours later, Nina gives birth to a beautiful girl she names Molly. Vince, ecstatic, visits her in the hospital, but when he leaves to complete paperwork, Nina and George remain alone with Molly. Nina asks George when he plans to move out to which he replies that he doesn't know. She asks him to move out of her apartment before she gets home from the hospital, stating that it would hurt her too much to have him stay any longer knowing that he doesn't love her the same way she does him.\n\nEight years later at George's school, everyone goes to see Molly in a musical production that George has directed. George is now the principal of the school. Nina is now in a relationship with Louis, and George is still with Paul, both of them now happy. Rodney is also there, still considered 'one of the family' by Louis and Nina. Nina, George, and young Molly ([[Sarah Hyland]]) (who refers to George as her \"Uncle George\") walk together, hand-in-hand, on their way to get coffee and talk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Nina Borowski\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as George Hanson\n* [[John Pankow]] as Vince McBride\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Constance Miller\n* [[Alan Alda]] as Sidney Miller\n* [[Tim Daly]] as Dr. Robert Joley\n* [[Joan Copeland]] as Madame Reynolds\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Frank Hanson\n* Amo Gulinello as Paul James\n* [[Kevin Carroll (actor)|Kevin Carroll]] as Louis Crowley\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Rodney Fraser\n* [[Kali Rocha]] as Melissa\n* [[Gabriel Macht]] as Steve Casillo\n* [[Sarah Hyland]] as Molly\n* Holli Marie Connors as girl at zoo\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Mermaid\n* [[Liam Aiken]] as Nathan\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Dr. Goldstein\n* [[Daniel Cosgrove]] as Trotter Bull\n* [[Samia Shoaib]] as Suni\n* [[Audra McDonald]] as wedding singer\n* Lauren Pratt as Sally\n** [[Paz de la Huerta]] as 13-year-old Sally\n* [[Salem Ludwig]] as Mr. Shapiro\n* [[Antonia Rey]] as Mrs. Ochoa\n* [[John Roland]] as TV Anchor\n* [[Rosanna Scotto]] as TV Anchor\n* [[Kia Goodwin]] as Juliet\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe shooting took place from June to July 1997, in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.fr/license/907682|title = JenniferAniston plays a pregnant woman in a scence from her new movie}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.fr/license/908197|title = Jennifer Aniston on the setof Object of my Affection on location in}}</ref> [[Winona Ryder]] was initially offered the role of Nina, but turned it down so [[Uma Thurman]] was cast opposite [[Keanu Reeves]] but both dropped out.
