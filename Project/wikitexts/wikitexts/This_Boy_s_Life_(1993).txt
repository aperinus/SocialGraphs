It was directed by [[Michael Caton-Jones]] and stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Tobias \"Toby\" Wolff, [[Robert De Niro]] as Toby's stepfather Dwight Hansen, and [[Ellen Barkin]] as Toby's mother, Caroline. The movie marked the first time Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro ever collaborated. The film also features [[Chris Cooper]], [[Carla Gugino]], [[Eliza Dushku]] and [[Tobey Maguire|Tobey Maguire's]] first credited appearance in a feature-length movie.\n\nIt was the first collaboration on-screen between Maguire and DiCaprio, who both later worked in ''[[Don's Plum]]'' and ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]''.,<ref>Conversations with Leonardo di Caprio September 23, 2014, SAG Foundation</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|title=A Very Thoughtful Tobey Maguire on The Great Gatsby, Mental Health, and On-Set Injuries|url=https://www.vulture.com/2013/05/tobey-maguire-the-great-gatsby-interview.html|access-date=June 18, 2013|newspaper=vulture.com|date= May 6, 2013}}</ref> and also the first collaboration on-screen between DiCaprio and De Niro, who both later worked in ''[[Marvin's Room (film)|Marvin's Room]]'', short film ''[[The Audition (2015 film)|The Audition]]'', and the upcoming film ''[[Killers of the Flower Moon (film)|Killers of the Flower Moon]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1950s, nomadic and flaky Caroline Wolff wants to settle down and find a decent man to provide a better home for herself and her son, Tobias \"Toby\" Wolff. She moves to [[Seattle, Washington]] and meets Dwight Hansen, a man who seemingly meets her goals. However, Dwight's true personality is soon revealed as being emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive to Toby while Caroline is away for a few weeks.\n\nThe marriage proceeds, and Caroline and Toby move into Dwight's home in [[Concrete, Washington|Concrete]], a small town near the north Cascades Mountains. Dwight's domineering personality is soon apparent, but Caroline remains with him, enduring several years of a dysfunctional relationship. During this time, Toby befriends a classmate named Arthur Gayle, a misfit at school and ambiguously [[gay]]. Toby wants to leave Concrete and live with his older brother, Gregory, (who lives on the East Coast with their father). Arthur wants to leave because he knows he will never fit in and that there is more to life than living in Concrete.  Toby plans to apply for scholarships at East Coast prep schools by submitting falsified school records. Meanwhile, Arthur and Toby's friendship becomes strained when Arthur accuses Toby of behaving more like Dwight. Arthur helps Toby to falsify his grade records. After numerous rejections, Toby is accepted by [[The Hill School (Pennsylvania)|The Hill School]] in [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]] near [[Philadelphia]] with a full scholarship.\n\nLater, Caroline defends Toby from Dwight during a physically violent argument; they both leave Dwight and the town of Concrete.\n\n:''Note: The real Dwight died in 1992. Caroline (Rosemary Wolff) remarried and moved to [[Florida]]. Arthur Gayle left Concrete and became a successful businessman in [[Italy]]. Dwight's children all married and lived in Seattle. Toby and his brother Geoffrey both became noted writers.''\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Tobias \"Toby\" Wolff/\u201cJack\u201d\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Dwight Hansen\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Caroline Wolff Hansen\n* [[Jonah Blechman]]  as Arthur Gayle\n* [[Eliza Dushku]] as Pearl Hansen\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Roy\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Norma Hansen\n* [[Zachary Ansley|Zack Ansley]] as Skipper Hansen\n* [[Tracey Ellis]] as Kathy\n* [[Kathy Kinney]] as Marian\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as Chuck Bolger\n* [[Michael Bacall]] as Terry Taylor\n* [[Gerrit Graham]] as Mr. Howard\n* [[Sean Murray (actor)|Sean Murray]] as Jimmy Voorhees\n* [[Lee Wilkof]] as Principal Skippy\n* [[Bill Dow]] as Vice Principal\n* [[Jen Taylor]] as Deputy O'Riley (uncredited)\n* [[Deanna Milligan]] and Morgan Brayton as Silver Sisters\n\n==Production==\nLargely filmed in the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], the town of [[Concrete, Washington]] (where Tobias Wolff's teen years were spent with his mother and stepfather, Dwight), was transformed to its 1950s appearance for a realistic feel. Many of the town's citizens were used as extras, and all external scenes in Concrete (and some internal scenes, as well) were shot in and around the town, including the former elementary school buildings and the still-active Concrete High School building. Parts of the film were also shot in the [[La Sal Mountains]] in [[Utah]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was released in [[limited release]] on April 9, 1993, and earned $74,425 that weekend;<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1993&wknd=15&p=.htm ''This Boy's Life''] at Box Office Mojo.</ref> upon its [[wide release]] on April 23, the film opened at #10 at the box office and grossed $1,519,678.<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1993&wknd=17&p=.htm ''This Boy's Life''] at Box Office Mojo.</ref> The film would end with a domestic gross of $4,104,962.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\"/>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mostly positive reviews; review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a 76% 'Fresh' rating from 37 critics, with an average rating of 6.4/10.

The main titles (filmed in Professor Valley, Utah) feature [[Frank Sinatra]]'s version of \"[[Let's Get Away from It All]]\" from his 1958 album ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]''. Toby and his mother sing \"[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]\" from the popular post-war musical ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''. However, most of the music reflects Toby's fondness for [[rock and roll]] and [[doo wop]], including songs by [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers]], and [[Link Wray]]. [[Carter Burwell]] composed the film's pensive score, which featured New York guitarist [[Frederic Hand]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0108330}}\n* {{mojo title|thisboyslife}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|this_boys_life}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4Uq6wECLts ''This Boy's Life''] film trailer at [[YouTube]]\n\n{{Michael Caton-Jones}}\n\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1990s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about children]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films based on biographies]]\n[[Category:Films about domestic violence]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Caton-Jones]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Art Linson]]\n[[Category:Films set in Seattle]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1957]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1959]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Carter Burwell]]\n[[Category:The Hill School]]\n[[Category:Films about the Boy Scouts of America]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Utah]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1993 drama films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films about mother\u2013son relationships]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
