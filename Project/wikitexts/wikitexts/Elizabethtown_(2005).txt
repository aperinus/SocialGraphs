On the verge of suicide, Drew receives a call from his sister telling him that their father has died while visiting their former hometown of [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]]. Deciding to postpone his suicide and bring their father's body back to Oregon, he then becomes involved in an unexpected romance with Claire Colburn, who he meets near the start of his journey. ''Elizabethtown'' stars [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Alec Baldwin]], and [[Susan Sarandon]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]] and [[Vinyl Films]].

It grossed $10.6 million in its opening weekend and $52.2 million worldwide, against a budget of $45 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1095861761/|title=Elizabethtown|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=February 14, 2020}}</ref> It received generally negative reviews from critics.<ref name=\"rt\">{{cite web |title=Elizabethtown |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elizabethtown |url-status=live |access-date=February 12, 2021 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDrew Baylor is a shoe designer for Mercury, a global sportswear company. When his latest shoe, meant to be his great life accomplishment, is found to have a flaw, it costs the company $972 million, and Drew is shamed by his boss, Phil, before he is asked to speak to the press\u2014his future unknown and likely finished at Mercury.\n\nDisappointed in his failure, and the subsequent breakup with his fair-weather office girlfriend, Ellen, Drew stacks his expensive clothes and other valuables on the street for scavengers to take, then prepares to commit suicide. He stops at the last moment to answer a persistent phone caller, who turns out to be his sister, Heather, telling him that his father, Mitch, has died while visiting family in [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]]. When his mother, Hollie, refuses to go because of a long-time dispute between her and the Kentucky Baylors, who are bitter about Hollie and Mitch moving to the West Coast, Drew volunteers to retrieve his father's remains and plans to go through with the suicide upon his return. \n\nOn the flight to [[Kentucky]], Drew meets flight attendant Claire, who is managing the almost completely empty 747. To make her shift easier, she strikes up a conversation with Drew and invites him to move up to first-class seating. Depressed about his work failure, he tries to ignore the bubbly, quirky Claire who has nothing to do on the flight except talk to him incessantly about Kentucky and alludes to her boyfriend, \"Ben\", who is a workaholic. At the end of the trip, Claire gives him a paper with directions, helpful tips, and her phone number to help him get to his destination before they part. Drew dismisses Claire, who seems to be trying to get the last of his attentions as he seeks the airport exit.\n\nArriving to Elizabethtown, Drew is met by the family. He makes arrangements for [[cremation]] at his mother's request, despite the family's objections. While staying at a hotel, where a raucous bachelor party and wedding reception is being held, Drew calls his mother and sister, then his ex, Ellen, as he struggles with boredom and depression. Finally, he calls Claire, who is also alone because Ben is away working, and they talk for hours. She impulsively suggests they meet at sunrise, before she has to depart on a flight to [[Hawaii]]. They have a quiet, platonic moment, and then they part ways as she leaves for her trip.\n\nDrew struggles between the family members and his mother's demands regarding burial arrangements. His mother is manically attempting self-improvement to compensate for the loss of her husband. Claire suddenly appears at the hotel, claiming Drew's needs for help outweigh her needs for a tropical vacation. They tour various parts of Kentucky and she helps him at the funeral home, picking out the urn and keeping Drew emotionally on track.\n\nDuring a post-dinner discussion with the older family, Drew sees the stovetop flame and panics about the cremation. Rushing to the funeral home, he is too late to stop his father's cremation. Solemn, he takes the urn back to the hotel, where Claire has crashed the bachelorette party. Things lead to their physical conclusion in his hotel room, but Drew is still wrapped up in his job and self-pity and they part on strained terms.\n\nHollie and Heather arrive for the service, and Hollie, with newfound self-confidence, makes a breakthrough with the family with a standup comedy routine and a farewell tap dance to Mitch. Claire arrives, and tells Drew to take a final trip with his father, giving him a binder box with customized itineraries and mix CDs for the road trip. Drew follows Claire's map home, spreading his father's ashes at memorable destinations along the way until he reaches the \"World's Second Largest Farmer's Market\" in Nebraska. There, a series of notes and clues gives him a choice: to either follow the map home or to go in a new direction, searching for the \"girl in the red hat.\" He finds Claire, they kiss, and Drew realizes he loves her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as Drew Baylor\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Claire Colburn\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Hollie Baylor\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Phil DeVoss\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Bill Banyon\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Heather Baylor\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Ellen Kishmore\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Jesse Baylor\n* [[Loudon Wainwright III]] as Uncle Dale\n* [[Gailard Sartain]] as Charles Dean\n* [[Jed Rees]] as Chuck Hasboro\n* [[Jim Fitzpatrick (actor)|Jim Fitzpatrick]] as Rusty\n* [[Paula Deen]] as Aunt Dora\n* [[Dan Biggers]] as Uncle Roy\n* Alice Marie Crowe as Aunt Lena\n* Tim Devitt as Mitch Baylor\n* Ted Manson as Sad Joe\n* [[Shane Lyons]] as Charlie Bill\n* [[Emily Rutherfurd]] as Cindy Hasboro\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Jane Fonda]] was cast in Sarandon's role, but had to drop out. [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Seann William Scott]], [[Colin Hanks]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], and [[James Franco]] all auditioned for Bloom's part. Kutcher was actually hired to play Drew, but director Cameron Crowe decided during filming that the chemistry between him and Dunst was not right and Kutcher left the project. Biel auditioned for the female lead, but was given a smaller role as Drew's ex-girlfriend.\n\nThere is a character named Ben who is mentioned as a love interest of Claire. In the original cut of the film, Ben is revealed to be Claire's brother.\n\nRecognizable settings for scenes shot in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], include the [[Brown Hotel (Louisville, Kentucky)|Brown Hotel]], Highland Middle School, and [[Cave Hill Cemetery]]. Opening scene shows a helicopter flying over downtown [[Portland, Oregon]], and the [[Fremont Bridge (Portland, Oregon)|Fremont Bridge]]. Although the exterior, lobby, and corridors of the Brown Hotel are seen, the hotel's [https://www.brownhotel.com/louisville-weddings Crystal Ball Room] was replicated on a soundstage. While Bloom's character is supposedly driving to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]], he is traveling in the wrong direction. He is also pictured going through the [[Cherokee Park]] tunnel on [[I-64]] although Elizabethtown is on [[I-65]], about {{convert|40.|mi}} in the other direction.\n\nDespite the film's title, most of the smalltown scenes were filmed in [[Versailles, Kentucky]]. Only two scenes portraying distinctive landmarks were filmed in Elizabethtown, because many of its historic buildings have been replaced by [[chain stores]] and [[Urban sprawl]]. A few scenes were filmed in [[LaGrange, Kentucky|LaGrange]]. Other local scenes were filmed in [[Otter Creek Park]] in [[Meade County, Kentucky|Meade County]], near [[Brandenburg, Kentucky|Brandenburg]]. Filming also took place in [[Scottsbluff, Nebraska]]; [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]]; [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; and [[Oklahoma City]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Rebecca |date=June 17, 2010 |title=Elizabethtown Review - Orlando Bloom, Kirsten Dunst, Elizabethtown Movie Review |url=http://movies.about.com/od/elizabethtown/a/elizab101305.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220171412/http://movies.about.com/od/elizabethtown/a/elizab101305.htm |archive-date=February 20, 2012 |access-date=January 23, 2012 |website=[[About.com|Movies.about.com]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the original cut of the film shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], an epilogue reveals that the flaw in the shoe designed by Drew, that it whistles while walking, turns out to be a hit with consumers. This was cut from the release version of the film to prevent the ending from seeming overly drawn-out.<ref name=\"ebert\" />\n\n[[Joni Mitchell]]'s painting ''Hyde Park'' appears in the film. One of her paintings had previously appeared in Crowe's ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' (2001).\n\n== Themes ==\nOn a second viewing of the movie, [[Roger Ebert]] makes the observation that the film is really a hidden story of an [[angel]] who has [[Grace in Christianity|fallen from grace]]. Claire, the angel, is met in the heavens (the empty plane) and has decided to guide Drew through his depression, suicidal thoughts and redeem himself from failure. Character names, the corporation, etc. were found to be allusions to [[Hell]], [[The Bible]], [[sin]] and the [[Lucifer|devil]]. Drew has to redeem and cleanse himself from working with the devil. Claire also needs to make the choice to remain on [[Earth]] at the end. The movie is thought to take various cues from the films ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), ''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]'' (1998), and ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' (1999).<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/elizabethtown-revisited | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|title=Elizabethtown Revisited|author-link=Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|via=rogerebert.com|date=June 27, 2006|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception {{anchor|Critics}}===\n''Elizabethtown'' received mostly negative reviews from critics.
