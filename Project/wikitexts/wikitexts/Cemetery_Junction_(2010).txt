Freddie wants to escape their [[working class]] world but cheeky chappy Bruce and kind-hearted [[slacker]] Snork are happy with life the way it is. When Freddie gets a job as a door-to-door insurance salesman and bumps into his old school sweetheart Julie, the gang are forced to make choices that will change their lives forever.\n\nFreddie's boss is Julie's father. Selling life insurance in the hopes of improving his life and not ending up like his factory worker father, Freddie learns from the firm's top seller Mike Ramsay, who is also Julie's fianc\u00e9, how to scare people into buying insurance. Bruce lives life to the full, with the notion that one day he will leave Cemetery Junction, but he hates his father for letting his mother leave for another man without fighting for her. Snork just lives for spending his time with Bruce and Freddie, working at the railway station and looking for a girlfriend, a search hindered by his lack of social skills. Freddie rekindles his friendship with Julie, who reveals her dreams to see the world and become a photographer, but her father and fianc\u00e9 Mike both expect her to become a housewife, like her mother.\n\nFreddie is invited to his firm's winner's ball to celebrate his and several others' company initiation, and brings Bruce and Snork as his guests. During that night, Snork tires of the band, and claims he could do better. Bruce convinces them to let Snork perform with them. The crowd initially enjoys his performance, but he gets carried away and tells a highly inappropriate joke, embarrassing Freddie. He confronts and scolds Snork and Bruce, but Bruce shrugs it off, still claiming he will leave the town, and that Freddie will never be like his colleagues because he's 'not a cunt', which the crowd overhears, forcing them to leave.\n\nThe next day, Freddie goes around town thanking his clients for helping him start his new career, and learns that his very first client's husband has died. Deciding not to live off people's misery, he asks Bruce when they plan to leave. They invite Julie to a nightclub, and convince Snork to leave with them. In the club, Bruce starts dancing with a black woman, for which he is ridiculed by two men, provoking him to assault them and get locked up in the police cells overnight.\n\nFreddie accompanies Julie home, and they develop the pictures Julie had taken throughout the night. They argue about their feelings, the lives of her parents and Julie's engagement to Mike, which is following the same path as her parents'. Freddie declares his love for Julie and asks her to go travelling, but she refuses and tells him to leave. Bruce is met in his cell by officer Wayne Davies, an old friend of his father's and the one man Bruce respects, who is fed up with Bruce taking his anger with his father out on others. He tells Bruce the story of the night his mother left, revealing that she happily abandoned him  but his father wanted him and tells him to grow up and get over his anti-social behaviour.\n\nThe following morning, Snork goes to a caf\u00e9 he frequents and talks to Louise, a girl who works there who likes him and they form a relationship. Bruce walks home and silently makes amends with his father. When Freddie arrives at the railway station to begin his travels, he finds Snork ready for work, having decided to stay and they say an emotional goodbye. Julie realises that Freddie was right, that her relationship with Mike will stifle her, and goes to the railway station. Snork announces over the station PA that Bruce will not be joining Freddie on his journey. Deciding not to go alone, Freddie is on the point of abandoning his adventure when he sees Julie running towards him and they board the train.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Christian Cooke]] as Freddie Taylor\n* [[Felicity Jones]] as Julie\n* [[Tom Hughes (actor)|Tom Hughes]] as Bruce Pearson\n* [[Jack Doolan (actor)|Jack Doolan]] as Paul/Snork\n* [[Anne Reid]] as Freddie's Gran\n* [[Steve Speirs]] as Sgt Wyn Davies\n* [[Julia Davis]] as Mrs Taylor\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Mrs Kendrick\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Len Taylor\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as Mike Ramsay\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Mr Kendrick\n* [[Albert Welling]] as Mr Waring\n* [[Katy Murphy]] as Mrs Waring\n* [[Burn Gorman]] as Renwick\n* [[Matthew Holness]] as Bandleader\n* Kirk Yeomans as Voice of bandleader\n* [[Michael Jibson]] as Cliff\n* [[Francis Magee]] as Mr Pearson\n* Imdad Miah as Salesman #1\n* [[David Earl (Comedian)|David Earl]] as Brian the caf\u00e9 owner\n* [[Bryony Hannah]] as Louise the waitress\n*  Simone Richards as a Cafe worker\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Dougie\n* [[Stephen Simpson (musician)|Stephen Simpson]] as Musician\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Aerial view across East Reading - geograph.org.uk - 727712.jpg|alt=|thumb|The film uses the backdrop of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]'s [[Cemetery Junction, Reading|Cemetery Junction]]]]\nThe film was originally titled ''The Men at the Pru'', a colloquial term (and later an advertising slogan) for agents of the [[Prudential Plc|Prudential insurance company]].

Sure, I worked in an office for 8 years as a middle manager, like that [[David Brent]], then I worked my way up in TV like that [[Andy Millman]], and like most comedians, my stand up is observational. But Cemetery Junction is not only based on my memories of my most formative years but it feeds on the most fundamental things in the making of a man: family, economics, the time and place you happened to be plonked in. Even though the movie is a fiction, the values, themes and characters are based on my memory of growing up in Reading in the early 70s. The soundtrack had to reflect that. It's purely coincidence that the songs in the film happen to be some of my favourites.
