The film is an adaptation of [[Tom Clancy]]'s 1984 bestselling [[The Hunt for Red October|novel of the same name]]. It is the first installment of the [[Jack Ryan (film series)|film series]] with the protagonist [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]].\n\nThe story is set during the late [[Cold War]] era and involves a rogue [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] naval captain who wishes to [[defection|defect]] to the [[United States]] with his officers and the [[Soviet Navy]]'s newest and most advanced [[ballistic missile submarine]], a fictional improvement on the Soviet [[Typhoon-class submarine]]. A [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst correctly deduces his motive and must prove his theory to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] before a violent confrontation between the Soviet and the American navies spirals out of control.\n\nThe film was a [[International co-production|co-production]] between the motion picture studios [[Paramount Pictures]], Mace Neufeld Productions, and Nina Saxon Film Design. Theatrically, it was commercially distributed by Paramount Pictures and by the Paramount Home Entertainment division for home media markets. Following its wide theatrical release, the film was nominated for and won a number of accolades. At the [[63rd Academy Awards]], the film was honored with the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]], along with nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. On June 12, 1990, the original soundtrack, composed and conducted by [[Basil Poledouris]], was released by [[MCA Records]]. ''The Hunt for Red October'' received mostly positive reviews from critics and was the sixth-highest-grossing domestic film of the year, generating $122&nbsp;million in North America and more than $200&nbsp;million worldwide in box office business.\n\n==Plot==\nIn November 1984, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarine [[Captain 1st rank|captain]] Marko Ramius is given command of {{ship||Red October|fictional submarine|2}}, a new [[Typhoon-class]] [[ballistic missile submarine]] with a \"[[magnetohydrodynamic drive|caterpillar drive]]\", rendering it undetectable to [[sonar#Passive sonar|passive sonar]]. Ramius leaves port to conduct exercises along with [[Alfa-class]] [[attack submarine]] ''V. K. Konovalov'', commanded by his former student Captain Tupolev. At sea, Ramius secretly kills [[political commissar|political officer]] Ivan Putin and relays false orders to his crew that they are to conduct missile drills off America's [[East coast of the United States|east coast]]. American {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine|0}} attack submarine [[USS Dallas (SSN-700)|USS ''Dallas'']], which had been shadowing ''Red October'', loses contact once the sub's caterpillar drive is engaged.\n\n[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst and [[United States Marine Corps|former Marine]] [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan]], after consulting with Vice Admiral [[Ryanverse#Main|James Greer]], the Deputy Director of the CIA, briefs government officials on ''Red October'' and the threat it poses. After learning that the bulk of the [[Soviet Navy]] has been deployed to the Atlantic to find and sink the sub, they conclude that Ramius plans a renegade nuclear strike. During the briefing, Ryan hypothesizes that Ramius, a native-born [[Lithuania]]n widower with few remaining personal ties to the Soviet Union, instead plans to [[defection|defect]] to the United States, and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] Jeffrey Pelt gives Ryan three days to confirm his theory. He is sent to an aircraft carrier in the mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, after some delay, Tupolev also receives orders to intercept and destroy ''Red October''.\n\nDue to an unknown saboteur's actions, ''Red October''{{'}}s caterpillar drive malfunctions during risky maneuvers through a narrow undersea canyon. Petty Officer Jones, a sonar technician aboard ''Dallas'', discovers a way to detect ''Red October'' using his underwater acoustics software, and ''Dallas'' plots an intercept course. After a hazardous mid-ocean transfer, Ryan is able to board ''Dallas'', where he attempts to persuade its captain, Commander Bart Mancuso, to contact Ramius and determine his real intentions.\n\nThe Soviet ambassador informs the U.S. government that Ramius is a renegade and asks for help in sinking ''Red October''. That order is sent to the U.S. fleet, including ''Dallas'', which has reacquired the Soviet sub. Ryan remains convinced that Ramius plans to defect with his officers and finally convinces Mancuso to contact Ramius and offer assistance. Ramius, stunned that the Americans correctly guessed his plan, accepts Mancuso's offer. He then stages a nuclear reactor \"emergency\", ordering the sub to surface and his crew to abandon ship. After a U.S. frigate is spotted heading right for them, Ramius submerges, leaving his crew in life rafts. Ryan, Mancuso, and Jones board ''Red October'' via a [[Mystic-class deep submergence rescue vehicle|rescue sub]]. Docking with ''Red October'', they meet Ramius who requests asylum for himself and his officers.\n\n''Red October'' is suddenly ambushed by ''Konovalov''. As the two Soviet subs maneuver, one of ''Red October''{{'}}s cooks, Loginov, is revealed to be an undercover [[Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)|GRU]] agent and the saboteur. He opens fire on the bridge, fatally wounding first officer Vasily Borodin, before retreating to the missile bay, intending to ignite a missile engine and destroy the ship. Loginov is pursued by Ryan and Ramius, and he wounds Ramius before being killed by Ryan. Meanwhile, ''Konovalov'' fires upon ''Red October'' with a torpedo, which ''Dallas'' is able to divert toward herself and evade by launching [[sonar decoy|countermeasures]] and conducting an [[Emergency main ballast tank blow|emergency blow]] to the surface. The torpedo reacquires ''Red October'' but Mancuso, placed in temporary command by Ramius, executes a maneuver that diverts the torpedo towards ''Konovalov'', which it strikes and destroys. The crew of ''Red October'', now rescued, witness the explosion from the deck of the U.S. frigate. Unaware of the second Soviet submarine, they believe that Ramius has sacrificed himself and scuttled ''Red October'' to avoid being boarded.\n\nRyan and Ramius, their subterfuge complete, navigate ''Red October'' to the [[Penobscot River]] in [[Maine]]. Ramius admits that he defected because he believed ''Red October'' was intended for a preemptive nuclear [[First strike (nuclear strategy)|first strike]] against the United States and was unwilling to support such an action. Ryan boards a flight home to [[London]] and, thanks to his exertions, [[Fear of flying|is finally able to sleep aboard a plane]] while seated next to a teddy bear intended for his daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Captain 1st rank Marko Ramius, [[Commanding Officer]] of ''Red October''\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] intelligence analyst, author, Professor of Naval History at the [[United States Naval Academy]]\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as Andrei Lysenko, Soviet Ambassador to the United States\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Dr. Petrov, Medical Officer on ''Red October''\n* [[Peter Firth]] as Ivan Putin, [[Political officer (military)|Political Officer]] of ''Red October''\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Bart Mancuso, USN, Commanding Officer of {{USS|Dallas|SSN-700|6}}\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] James Greer, USN, Deputy Director of the [[CIA]]\n* [[Jeffrey Jones]] as Skip Tyler, a former submarine commander who identifies ''Red October''{{'}}s propulsion system\n* [[Richard Jordan]] as Jeffrey Pelt, [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]]\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Captain 2nd rank Vasily Borodin, [[Executive officer#Military|Executive Officer]] of ''Red October''\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Captain 2nd rank Viktor Tupolev, Commanding Officer of ''Konovalov'' and Ramius's former student\n* [[Fred Thompson]] as [[Rear admiral (United States)#Rear admiral (lower half)|Rear Admiral]] Joshua Painter, USN, Commander of the ''Enterprise'' [[carrier battle group]]\n* [[Courtney B.

Despite the book becoming a best seller, no Hollywood studio was interested because of its content. Neufeld said, \"I read some of the reports from the other studios, and the story was too complicated to understand\".<ref name=\"Thomas, Bob\">{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Bob |title=High-Tech Novel Took Five Years to Reach Screen |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=March 2, 1990}}</ref> After a year and a half he finally got a high-level executive at [[Paramount Pictures]] to read Clancy's novel and agree to develop it into a film.\n\nScreenwriters Larry Ferguson and Donald Stewart worked on the [[screenplay]] while Neufeld approached the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] for approval. They feared top secret information or technology might be revealed. However, several admirals liked Clancy's book and reasoned that the film could do for submariners what ''[[Top Gun]]'' did for the Navy's jet fighter pilots.<ref name=\"Thomas, Bob\" /> Captain Michael Sherman, director of the Navy's western regional information office in Los Angeles, suggested changes to the script that would present the Navy in a positive light.<ref name=\"Donohue, Cathryn\">{{cite news |last=Donohue |first=Cathryn |title=''Red October'' Surfaces as a Movie |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=March 2, 1990}}</ref>\n\nThe Navy gave the filmmakers access to several {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine|1}}s, allowing them to [[photograph]] unclassified sections of both {{USS|Chicago|SSN-721|2}} and {{USS|Portsmouth|SSN-707|2}} to use in set and prop design. {{USS|Louisville|SSN-724|2}} was used for the scene in which Baldwin is dropped from a helicopter to the submarine. Key cast and crew members rode along in subs, including Alec Baldwin and Scott Glenn, who took an overnight trip aboard {{USS|Salt Lake City|SSN-716|2}} commanded by then Commander [[Thomas B. Fargo]]. Glenn based his portrayal of Commander Bart Mancuso on Fargo.<ref name=\"Thomas, Bob\" />\n\nThe film is a somewhat faithful adaptation of Clancy's novel, though there are many deviations, including ''Red October'' traveling up the Penobscot River in Maine to dry dock, the omission of the [[Royal Navy]] task force including Ryan's time aboard {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}, the death of Borodin rather than Kamarov, and ''V. K. Konovalov'' being serendipitously destroyed by its own torpedo as opposed to being rammed by ''Red October'', with the planned explosion of [[USS Ethan Allen (SSBN-608)|USS ''Ethan Allen'']] as a subterfuge.\n\n===Casting===\nSome of the principal cast had previous military service which they drew on for their roles. Sean Connery had served in the [[Royal Navy]], Scott Glenn in the [[United States Marine Corps]], and James Earl Jones in the [[United States Army]]. Baldwin and Glenn spent time on a ''Los Angeles''-class submarine. Baldwin was trained to drive an attack submarine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://parade.com/486446/walterscott/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-alec-baldwin/|title=5 Things You Didn't Know About Alec Baldwin|last=Scott|first=Walter|newspaper=Parade|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en|archive-date=February 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211160016/https://parade.com/486446/walterscott/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-alec-baldwin/|url-status=live}}</ref> Some extras portraying the ''Dallas'' crew were serving submariners, including the pilot of the [[Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle|DSRV]], Lt Cmdr George Billy. Submariners from San Diego were cast as extras because it was easier to hire them than to train actors. Crew from {{USS|La Jolla}}, including Lt Mark Draxton, took leave to participate in filming. According to an article in ''Sea Classics'', at least two sailors from the Atlantic Fleet-based ''Dallas'' took leave and participated in the Pacific Fleet-supported filming. The crew of ''Houston'' called their month-long filming schedule the \"Hunt for Red Ops.\" ''Houston'' made more than 40 emergency surfacing \"blows\" for rehearsal and for the cameras.<ref name=\"Thomas, Bob\" />\n\nThe filmmakers' first choice to portray Jack Ryan was [[Kevin Costner]], who turned down the film in order to star in and direct ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64931/14-deep-facts-about-hunt-red-october|title=14 Deep Facts About The Hunt for Red October|date=2015-06-12|website=www.mentalfloss.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18|archive-date=March 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318144149/https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64931/14-deep-facts-about-hunt-red-october|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Harrison Ford]] was also approached to play Jack Ryan but turned it down; he would later replace Alec Baldwin as Ryan in ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/01/jack-ryan-10-things-you-didnt-know|title=10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Jack Ryan|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=January 17, 2014}}</ref> Baldwin was approached in December 1988, but was not told for what role.

The film begins with the actors speaking Russian with English subtitles. But in an early scene, actor [[Peter Firth]] casually switches in mid-sentence to speaking in English on the word \"Armageddon\", which is the same spoken word in both languages. After that point, all the Soviets' dialogue is communicated in English. Connery continued using his native Scottish accent for the rest of the motion picture. Only towards the climax of the film, at the beginning of the scene in which the Soviet and American submariners meet, do some of the actors speak in Russian again.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming in submarines was impractical. Instead, five soundstages on the Paramount backlot were used. Two {{convert|50|ft2|adj=on}}{{verify source|likely actually 50-foot x 50-foot => 15-metre x 15-metre => 225 m^2|date=January 2020}} platforms housing mock-ups of ''Red October'' and ''Dallas'' were built, standing on hydraulic gimbals that simulated the sub's movements. Connery recalled, \"It was very claustrophobic. There were 62 people in a very confined space, {{convert|45|feet|m}} above the stage floor. It got very hot on the sets, and I'm also prone to sea sickness. The set would tilt to 45 degrees. Very disturbing.\" The veteran actor shot for four weeks and the rest of the production shot for additional months on location in [[Port Angeles, Washington]] and the waters off Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Donohue, Cathryn\"/>\n\n[[File:USS Reuben James;075702.jpg|250px|thumb|{{USS|Reuben James|FFG-57|6}}, where a number of flight deck scenes were filmed]]\nMade before the extensive use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] became the norm in filmmaking, the film's opening sequence featured a long pull-out reveal of the immense titular Typhoon-class sub. It included a nearly full-scale, above-the-water-line mockup of the sub, constructed from two barges welded together. Each country's submarine had its own background color: Soviet submarines, such as ''Red October'' and ''V.K. Konovalov'', had interiors in black with chrome trim. American ships, such as ''Dallas'' and ''Enterprise'', had grey interiors. Early filming was aboard [[USS Reuben James (FFG-57)|USS ''Reuben James'']] in the area of the [[Juan de Fuca Strait]] and [[Puget Sound]] in March 1989. The ship operated out of [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] Station Port Angeles. The [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|SH-60B]] detachment from the Battlecats of HSL-43 operated out of [[NAS Whidbey Island]], after being displaced by the film crew. Most underwater scenes were filmed using smoke with a model sub connected to 12 cables, giving precise, smooth control for turns. Computer effects, in their infancy, created bubbles and other effects such as particulates in the water.<ref name=\"making-of-ripples\">{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_epfA20dOY&t=25m07s |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/2_epfA20dOY |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|editor1-first=Cynthia|editor1-last=Wichert|year=2003|title=Beneath the Surface: The Making of \"''The Hunt for Red October''\"|format=25:07|quote=we did want to make sure we did all the ripple effects and distortions and get those added in as computer graphics.}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nBy March 1990, just before the film's theatrical release, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Soviet Parliament]] removed the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] from government, effectively ending the Cold War. Set during this period, there were concerns that with its end, the film would be irrelevant but Neufeld felt that it \"never really represented a major problem\". To compensate for the change in the Soviet Union's political climate, an on-screen crawl appears at the beginning of the film stating that it takes place in 1984 during the Cold War. Tony Seiniger designed the film's poster and drew inspiration from Soviet poster art, using bold red, white and black graphics. According to him, the whole ad campaign was designed to have a \"techno-suspense quality to it\". The idea was to play up the thriller aspects and downplay the political elements.<ref name=\"Kilday\"/>\n\nThe film caused a minor sensation in the black projects submarine warfare technology community.<ref name=\"gravity0\">{{cite news |title=Hunt for Red October Article |publisher=CIA |date=Summer 2009 |volume=53 |page=24 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/special-review-supplement/U-%20Special%20Reviews%20Supplement%20-July%202009.pdf |access-date=2010-07-14 |archive-date=May 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527140312/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/special-review-supplement/U-%20Special%20Reviews%20Supplement%20-July%202009.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"gravity1\">{{cite news |title=Gravity Gradiometry Article |work=Scientific American |date=June 1998 |url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&ISSUEID_CHAR=C667095F-A703-4986-8225-6B29F3A59FF&ARTICLEID_CHAR=32C3A7D0-A12D-4BA3-BD2A-EE1D1829C8B |access-date=2010-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610155154/http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&ISSUEID_CHAR=C667095F-A703-4986-8225-6B29F3A59FF&ARTICLEID_CHAR=32C3A7D0-A12D-4BA3-BD2A-EE1D1829C8B |archive-date=June 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In one scene, where USS ''Dallas'' is chasing ''Red October'' through the submarine canyon, the crew can be heard calling out that they have various \"[[Gal (unit)|milligal]] anomalies\".
