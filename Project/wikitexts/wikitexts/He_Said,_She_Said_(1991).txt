It stars [[Kevin Bacon]] and [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as two journalists working in the same office and falling in love with each other.\n\n==Plot==\n''It is the story of the relationship between journalists Dan Hanson ([[Kevin Bacon]]) and Lorie Bryer ([[Elizabeth Perkins]]) told twice \u2013 once from each perspective. The male story was directed by [[Ken Kwapis]] and the female story by [[Marisa Silver]]. At the time, Kwapis and Silver were engaged and they married soon after the film was released.''\n\nDan and Lorie are writers of obituaries and weddings, respectively, and later rival editorial page contributors at the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]''. Shortly after starting their rivalrous, side-by-side columns, conservative Dan and liberal Lorie experience a case of opposites attracting. Close to three years after the column and their relationship commencing, a morning talk show appearance inspires a local channel to offer them a TV program. The point-counterpoint talk show will present their opposing views on various civic issues.\n\nTheir great differences cause sparks to fly and ratings to soar. One day on air, they create a great scene, which piques the public's interest, while simultaneously causing their breakup. We then see the film is split, with the first half showing us his perspective of the three years of their relationship up until the on-air scene and the second half, hers.\n\nDan is initially shown to be a womanizer and commitment-phobe. Early on, Lorie helps him hide from one woman he has jilted, later she sees his flirtatious interaction with women she perceives to be excessively sexily dressed and not very bright. He sees himself as a wolf, needing to be free. Then we see him mishearing and reading items on a menu, all connected to serious relationships and settling down.\n\nAs Dan and Lorie get to know one another, they both discover they have feelings for each other. She carefully orchestrates their first close encounters, making it appear that she is avoiding another man, so that he dances with her. She subtly lets him know she has just dumped her boyfriend so he knows she is available and they have dinner together.\n\nOnce they are resettled in their new office space as columnists, Lorie says she loves him, but Dan does not reciprocate. Obviously something he is not comfortable saying, he goes to a therapist but still cannot say it. Finally he tells her he loves her while she is sleeping. Unbeknownst to him, she has heard him and we see she is staggered.\n\nWe come to the fateful live scene with the mug. Moments before they step on-stage, they argue in the [[green room]]. Lorie discovers Dan had heard from Linda ([[Sharon Stone]]), and had made lunch plans with her. Jealous because of their past history, she asks if he will ever marry her and he tells her no.\n\nOn the day of what is meant to be their last show, Dan pre-records his rebuttal. Then, Lorie does a live redo response to the previous day's topic, the merger of two highways--a veiled reference to their relationship--this time saying the proposal was a bad idea. She shows that her mug is clean, alluding to an off-hand remark he made, that if she ever cleaned the bottom of her mug, he would consider their relationship a success. The studio shows Dan's prerecorded rebuttal to the proposal, likewise reversing his view, accepting the proposal. Then he directly apologizes to her, asking for another chance, reappears on stage, and they embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Dan Hanson\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Lorie Bryer\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as Wally Thurman\n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Mark\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Linda\n* [[Stanley Anderson]] as Mr. Weller\n* [[Charlayne Woodard]] as Cindy\n* [[Danton Stone]] as Eric\n* [[Phil Leeds]] as Mr. Spepk\n* [[Rita Karin]] as Mrs. Spepk\n* Paul Butler as Al, at the Deli\n* [[Erika Alexander]] as Rita, his daughter\n* [[Ashley Gardner]] as Susan\n* Michael Harris as Adam\n* [[Bruce MacVittie]] as Lou the Florist\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nAs of January 2022, ''He Said, She Said'' holds a rating of 35% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 17 reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=He Said, She Said (1991)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/he_said_she_said|language=en|access-date=2020-12-30}}</ref>\n\nIn a two-star review [[Roger Ebert]] described it as \"a gentle little film that raises some questions about the different ways men and women view reality, does not answer them, and succeeds in being entertaining all the same.\"<ref>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/he-said-she-said-1991 Review by Roger Ebert]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0102011|He Said, She Said}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|he_said_she_said|He Said, She Said}}\n* {{Mojo title|hesaidshesaid}}\n\n{{Ken Kwapis}}\n{{Marisa Silver}}\n\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:1991 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about journalists]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ken Kwapis]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Marisa Silver]]\n[[Category:Films set in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Miles Goodman]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
