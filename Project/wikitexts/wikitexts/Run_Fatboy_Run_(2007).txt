It was released in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2007, in [[Canada]] on 10 September 2007 and in the United States on 28 March 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nDennis Doyle is about to marry Libby, his [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] [[Engagement|fianc\u00e9e]]. However, he gets cold feet and runs away on the day of the wedding. Five years later, Dennis discovers that Libby, who has their son, Jake, has started seeing successful but arrogant Whit and realises that he has truly lost her. He finds out that Whit is running the Nike River Marathon in [[London]], and to prove himself to his uncertain friends and, most importantly, Libby and his son, he decides to run the race himself.\n\nHe receives motivation from his two \"coaches\", Gordon, a well-meaning [[slacker]] who is Libby's cousin and Dennis' best friend, who has made a hefty bet on Dennis succeeding, and Mr. Ghosh Dastidar, his landlord, who uses unorthodox methods of training, such as using a spatula to spank him. Days before the race, Whit proposes to Libby at her birthday party. Libby accepts and this puts Dennis in a state of deep [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. As a result, he decides to quit the race.\n\nMeanwhile, Jake, who has formed a crush on a girl in his class, runs away upset when he discovers that she prefers another boy just because he has a ponytail. Dennis, upon being informed by a frantic Libby, tracks him down and explains to him that he will find many things he does not like in his life and he should just stand up to them and face them, rather than running away. Having made that mistake himself, he decides to race after all.\n\nDennis starts the race alongside Whit, who informs Dennis that he intends to move Libby and Jake to [[Chicago]]. Enraged, Dennis mocks Whit and they altercate for a while at the start of the race and, in their efforts to out-do each other, they catch up to and then overtake the professional runners, and suddenly, Whit trips Dennis and severely injures him. Stretchers prepare to take Dennis to the hospital.\n\nWhit continues, but is taken to the hospital after feeling pain in his leg. Libby goes to the hospital to look for Dennis, but finds Whit, who claims loudly that his injuries are the result of Dennis deliberately tripping him. The doctor tells him he is not actually injured and has only \"[[Hitting the wall|hit the wall]]\". Jake is playing with Whit's hospital bed, and to Libby's disgust, Whit calls him a \"little shit\".\n\nDennis has in fact refused to be transported to the hospital or even get medical attention and is continuing the race well into the afternoon and evening with a sprained ankle, accompanied by a growing group of supporters, including Gordon and Mr. Ghosh Dastidar. A panting Dennis almost \"hits the wall\", but after an emotional [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], his goal to complete the race is restored. Later at Whit's house, Libby, Jake and Whit watch a television replay of the Whit/Dennis altercation, as the replay shows that in fact Whit had deliberately tripped Dennis and had fallen over because Dennis pulled him down as he was falling.\n\nAs Whit tries to justify his behaviour, he blurts out his intentions to have Libby and Jake move to Chicago with him. A fed up Libby puts the engagement ring on a table, telling Whit \"nobody's perfect\" and storms out with Jake. The two go to meet Dennis as he arrives at the finish line. Dennis falls over just metres from the finish line and cannot get up until he sees Libby and Jake calling to him, at which point he gets up, sprints to the finish and collapses in their arms.\n\nSome time later, notably healthier and fully recovered from his injuries, Dennis calls at Libby's house to pick up Jake. He says that he has something to ask her, but is interrupted by Jake, and says he'll talk to her later. However, just after she shuts the door, he knocks again and asks her on a date. She accepts.\n\nIn the film's postscript, Gordon \u2014 on the bridge of a new yacht \u2014 tells the tale of the race to two attractive bikini-clad women, whom he invites aboard for a drink. The camera then pans to reveal to the audience that he's, as usual, naked below the waist.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Simon Pegg 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Simon Pegg]] portrays [[protagonist]] Dennis Doyle.]]\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Dennis Doyle\n* [[Thandiwe Newton]] as Libby Odell (credited as Thandie Newton)\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Whit Bloom\n* [[Dylan Moran]] as Gordon\n* [[Harish Patel]] as Mr. Ghosh Dastidar\n* [[India de Beaufort]] as Maya Ghosh Dastidar\n* Matthew Fenton as Jake\n* [[Simon Day]] as Vincent\n* [[Ruth Sheen]] as Claudine\n* Tyrone Huggins as Grover\n* Nevan Finegan as Mickey\n* [[Iddo Goldberg]] as News reporter\n* [[Floella Benjamin]] as Libby's mother\n* [[Chris J.
