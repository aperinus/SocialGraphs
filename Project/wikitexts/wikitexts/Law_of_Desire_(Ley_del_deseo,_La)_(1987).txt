Starring [[Eusebio Poncela]] as Pablo, [[Carmen Maura]] as Tina and [[Antonio Banderas]] as Antonio. It was the first film Almod\u00f3var made independently with his own production company [[El Deseo]].\n\nThe story focuses on a complex love triangle between three men. Pablo, a successful gay film director, disappointed in his relationship with his young lover, Juan, concentrates in a new project, a monologue starring his transgender sister, Tina. Antonio, an uptight young man, falls possessively in love with the director, and in his passion would stop at nothing to obtain the object of his desire. The relationship between Pablo and Antonio is at the core of the film; however, the story of Pablo's sister, Tina, plays a strong role in the plot.\n\nShot in the later part of 1986, ''Law of Desire'' was Almod\u00f3var's first work centered on homosexual relationships. He considers ''Law of Desire'' the key film in his life and career.  It follows the more serious tone set by Almod\u00f3var's previous film, ''[[Matador (film)|Matador]]'', exploring the unrestrained force of desire. The film's themes include love, loss, gender, family, sexuality, and the close link between life and art.\n\n''Law of Desire'' was met with general positive reactions from film critics, and it was a hit with audiences, becoming Almod\u00f3var's most successful film up to that point. It toured many international film festival, winning the [[Teddy Award]] in [[Berlin]], and it made Almod\u00f3var known internationally.\n\nElements from ''Law of Desire'' grew into the basis for three later films: [[Carmen Maura]] appears in a stage production of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[The Human Voice]]'', which inspired Almod\u00f3var's next film, ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]''; Tina's confrontation scene with an abusive priest formed a partial genesis for ''[[Bad Education (2004 film)|Bad Education]]''; and a short film version of Cocteau's ''[[The Human Voice (film)|The Human Voice]]'', starring [[Tilda Swinton]], the first film by Almod\u00f3var to be acted in English.\n\n==Plot==\nPablo Quintero is a successful gay film and theatrical director whose latest work, ''The Paradigms of the Mussel'', has just been released. At the opening night party, he discusses with his much younger lover, Juan, their summer plans. Pablo would stay in [[Madrid]] working on a new project, while Juan would leave for his hometown in the south to work in a bar and stay with his family. Pablo is in love with Juan, but he realizes that his love is not returned with the intensity he desires.\n\nPablo is very close to his transsexual sister Tina, a struggling actress. Tina has recently been abandoned by her lesbian lover, a model, who left her in charge of her ten-year-old daughter Ada. Frustrated in her relationship with men, Tina dedicates her time to Ada, being a loving surrogate mother. The precocious Ada does not miss her cold mother. She is happier living with Tina and spending time with Pablo, on whom she has a crush. Tina, Ada, and Pablo form an unusual family unit. Pablo looks after them both. For his next project, Pablo writes an adaptation of [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]]'s monologue-play ''[[The Human Voice]]'', to be performed by his sister.\n\nAt the play's opening night, Pablo meets Antonio, a young man who has been obsessed with the director since he watched the gay theme film ''The Paradigms of the Mussel''. At the end of the evening, they go home together and have sex. For Antonio this is his first homosexual experience, while Pablo considers it just a [[lust]]y episode. Pablo is still in love with his long-time lover, Juan. Antonio misunderstands Pablo's intentions and takes their encounter as a relationship. He soon reveals his [[possessive]] character as a lover.\n\nAntonio comes across a love letter addressed to Pablo, signed by Juan, but which in fact was written by Pablo to himself. The letter makes Antonio fall into a jealous rage, but he has to return to his native [[Andalusia]], where he lives with his domineering German mother. As he promised, Pablo sends Antonio a letter signed Laura P, the name of a character inspired by his sister in a script he is writing. In his letter, Pablo tells Antonio that he loves Juan and intends to join him. However, Antonio, who is jealous and wants to get rid of Juan, gets there first. Antonio wants to possess everything that belongs to Pablo, and tries to have sex with Juan. When Juan rebukes his advances, Antonio throws him off a cliff. After killing his rival, Antonio quickly heads for his hometown. Pablo becomes a suspect in the crime because the police have found in Juan's fist a piece of clothing that matches a distinctive shirt owned by Pablo. In fact, Antonio was wearing an exact replica when he killed Juan.\n\nPablo drives down to see his dead lover, realizes that Antonio is responsible for the murder, and confronts him about it. They have an argument and Pablo drives off, pursued by the police. Blinded by tears, he crashes his car injuring his head. He awakes in a hospital, suffering from [[amnesia]]. Antonio's mother shows the police the letters her son received, signed Laura P. The mysterious Laura P becomes the prime suspect, but the police cannot find her. Antonio returns to Madrid and, in order to get closer to Pablo who is still in the hospital, seduces Tina who believes his love to be genuine.\n\nTo help her brother recover his memory, Tina tells him about their past. Born as a boy, in her adolescence she began an affair with their father. She ran away with him and had a sex change operation to please him, but he left her for another woman. When her [[incest]]uous relationship ended, Tina returned to Madrid, coinciding with the death of their mother, and got reunited with Pablo. Tina has been grateful with Pablo who did not judge her. Tina also tells him that she has found a lover. Pablo gradually begins to recover; he realizes that Tina's new love is Antonio and that she is in danger. He goes with the police to Tina's apartment where she is being held hostage by Antonio. Antonio threatens a bloodbath unless he can have an hour alone with Pablo. Pablo agrees and joins him. They make love and Antonio then commits [[suicide]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eusebio Poncela]] as Pablo Quintero: a gay film director and writer.

''Law of Desire'' was shot in [[Madrid]] and [[C\u00e1diz]] in the latter part of 1986. It was the first film that came out from [[El Deseo]], the production company that Almod\u00f3var formed in company with his younger brother Agust\u00edn and with which he has produced all his subsequent films.<ref name = \" Strauss 63\">Strauss, ''Almod\u00f3var on Almod\u00f3var'', p. 63</ref> It was the experience of working with the producer of ''Matador'' that led the path to the Almod\u00f3var brothers to become producers following the model of selling the film before its release.<ref name=\" Strauss 63\"/> With my first five films I had the impression of having had five children with five different fathers and of always fighting with each one of them, since my films belonged to them, from a financial point of view, but also on an artistic level, that is, on the level of a conception,<ref name=\" Strauss 63\"/> Almod\u00f3var commented.<ref name=\" Strauss 63\"/>\n\nThe homosexual subject matter in ''Law of Desire'' made it more difficult to find funding for its production.<ref name = \" Edwards 72\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 72</ref> Initially, the brothers could not get support from the ministry of culture. It was thanks to the personal intervention of Fernando M\u00e9ndez Leite, the government representative for film production, that the ministry of culture gave 40 million pesetas to make the film and Lauren films contributed with 20 million and the rest from other sources.<ref name=\" Edwards 72\"/> The film was a most modest production, with a total budget of 100 million pesetas, less than Almod\u00f3var's previous film.\n\nCommenting on ''Law of Desire'' Almod\u00f3var stated that his intention was to make a film about desire and passion: \"What interested me most is passion for its own sake. It is a force you cannot control, which is stronger than you and which is as much a source of pain as of pleasure. In any case, it is so strong that it makes you do things which are truly monstrous or absolutely extraordinary\".<ref name = \" Edwards 74\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 74</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Law of Desire'', Almod\u00f3var's sixth film, premiered in [[Madrid]] on 7 February 1987. It was the most commercially successful Spanish film at the local box office in 1987, and it was the Spanish film of that year most widely distributed abroad surpassing [[Mario Camus]]'s ''[[The House of Bernarda Alba (1987 film)|The House of Bernarda Alba]]''. ''Law of Desire'' toured many festival circuits. It won the award for best director at the Rio de Janeiro film festival; best new director at [[Los Angeles]]; the [[Teddy Award]] (1987) at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teddyaward.org/doc/teddy_winner_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-06-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317183014/http://www.teddyaward.org/doc/teddy_winner_en.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-17 }}</ref> and Best Film at the [[Frameline Film Festival|San Francisco International Gay and Lesbian film festival]]. In Spain it won Fotogramas de Plata as Best Film and the National award for cinematography for Carmen Maura for her performance as Tina; other awards for the film came from [[Italy]] and [[Belgium]].\n\nIt took time for Spanish film critics to warm up to Almod\u00f3var's work. His earlier films were recognized for the irreverence of their humor and social parody but were generally deemed as frivolous. ''Law of Desire'' was better received than its predecessor. Ernesto Pardo writing for ''Segre'' wrote: I have never been keen on Almod\u00f3var ... I find him too over the top, excessive, unreal... As if he lived in another world... on the other hand [with Law of Desire, Almod\u00f3var] has achieved what at the outset seemed impossible. That is, a more than acceptable film\".<ref name = \" Edwards 73\">Edwards, ''Almod\u00f3var: Labyrinth of Passion'', p. 73</ref> In ''Cinco Dias'' Antonio Gutti criticized the film's emphasis on the homosexual as too sustained and felt that Almod\u00f3var's irresistible humor did not appear.<ref name=\" Edwards 73\"/> Angel Fernandez Santos in ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' considered that the film contained \"such an excess of incidents and events that their sheer number neutralizes some of its quality\". In [[El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya|''El Periodico'']], Jorge de Cominges commented that: \"Pedro Almod\u00f3var's success is in putting together the different elements of such a wild story. In a quite brilliant manner he creates characters as impactful as the police detective and his son; and he turns the magnificent Carmen Maura into the most sensual woman you can imagine. ''Law of Desire'' is a film which is as satisfying as it is amusing. An outstanding achievement.\"{{full citation needed|date=September 2021}} Manuel Hidalgo wrote: \"''Law of Desire'' is Pedro Almod\u00f3var's most homogeneous, controlled and finished film\".<ref name=\" Edwards 73\"/>\n\n[[Pauline Kael]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' commented: \"The film has the exaggerated plot of an absurdist Hollywood romance, and even when it loses its beat (after a murder) there\u2019s always something happening. This director manages to joke about the self-dramatizing that can go on at the movies, and at the same time reactivate it. The film is festive. It doesn\u2019t disguise its narcissism; it turns it into bright-colored tragicomedy\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Kael|first1=Pauline|title=Manypeeplia Upsidownia|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1987/04/20/manypeeplia-upsidownia/amp|magazine=The New Yorker|date=12 April 1987}}</ref>\n\nIn her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Janet Maslin]] said: \"What it lacks in depth, ''Law of Desire'' makes up in surface energy, with a lively cast, a turbulent plot and a textbook-worthy collection of case histories\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|title=Law of Desire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/27/movies/new-directors-new-films-spanish-law-of-desire.html|website=New York Times|date=27 March 1987}}</ref> [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] from [[Chicago Reader]] concluded: \"The film bristles with energy and bright interludes before the lugubrious plot takes over\u2026\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Law of Desire|url=https://m.chicagoreader.com/chicago/law-of-desire/Film?oid=1072898|website=Chicago Reader|date = 26 October 1985}}</ref>\n\nIn his review for ''[[Time Magazine]]'', Richard Corliss called the film \"a bleak comic and defiantly romantic\". [[David Edelstein]] in  ''[[New York magazine]]'' called it \"a swirling ''Cri de Coeur'' [that] explores the conflict within a director between voyeurism and passionate love\".\n\n==Genre==                                                                                     \n''Law of Desire'' is anchored in the [[melodrama]] genre. However Almod\u00f3var explained that the film did not follow the conventions of the genre: \"In melodrama there have always been characters that are either good or bad, but today you can\u2019t portray characters so simplistically. There aren\u2019t good people and bad people, everything is more complex. Law of Desire is a melodrama which breaks the rules of the genre\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Indiewire's Law of Desire Review|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/pedro-almodovar-presents-law-of-desire-talks-life-love-art-at-afi-fest-2011}}</ref>\n\nAlmod\u00f3var has spoken of his aspiration for the films of [[Francis Ford Coppola]] particularly in the way he mixes genres, such as in ''[[The Godfather]]'' which mixes [[gangster film]] and family drama.\n\nThe director also mentioned that it was influenced by the Hollywood melodramas of the 1940s and 1950s particularly those made by [[Douglas Sirk]] and [[Billy Wilder]]'s 1950 ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', which he called \"an epic film with regards to emotion\".\n\nThere is also the influence of the French writer [[Jean Cocteau]], whose play ''[[The Human Voice]]''  (''La Voix humaine'') (1932), is adapted by Pablo Quintero. The work of Mexican poets in the early 1930s known as [[Los Contempor\u00e1neos]], also presented in the work of Spanish poet [[Federico Garcia Lorca]].  Almod\u00f3var refers to a Latin American sentimentality more openly melodramatic than in Spain as reflected in Almod\u00f3var's preference for choosing Latin American boleros for his films.\n\n==Analysis==                                                                                     \nThe outrageous titles of Pablo's film seem to belong to [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]{{'}} aesthetic universe of pop culture, media, and trash as found in ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972), ''[[Female Trouble]]'' (1974), and ''[[Desperate Living]]'' (1977). ''Law of Desire'' is closely linked to two of Almod\u00f3var's subsequent films. Religion and sexual abuse appear in the character of Ada who with Tina makes a cruz de mayo, a makeshift altar that mixes religious and pagan elements. Ada makes a vow of silence until certain wishes have been fulfilled. She also wants to make her first communion. The scene in which Tina enters her former school where she sang as the soloist at church and confronts Father Constantino, the priest who abused her when she was a boy, formed a partial genesis for Almod\u00f3var's later film ''[[La Mala educacion|Bad Education]]''.\n\nThe character of Pablo serves as an alter ego for Almod\u00f3var. Pablo is working on his new film whose main character is Laura P. The implausibility of its plot reflects the intricate and outrageous plot of Almod\u00f3var's own film. When she was left by one of her lovers, Laura ran after him and broke an ankle. She had her leg amputated, so that others would feel guilty, but even thus, her thirst for vengeance was not quenched.\n\nIn the video arcade scene in which Antonio tries to be seductive, he lights both his and Pablo's cigarette. This is a reference to [[Bette Davis]]'s film ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942) directed by [[Irving Rapper]] in which [[Paul Henreid]] puts two cigarettes into his mouth and lights one for Bette Davis.\n\nReinforcing the links between life and art, Ada's mother has left Tina to elope with a photographer. Stage life and real but through law of desire Cocteau monologue talks of the separation of the expressive pore. Almod\u00f3var cited American painter [[Edward Hopper]] as an inspiration for the way in which his cinematographer \u00c1ngel Luis Fern\u00e1ndez photographed Madrid. Tina's revelation of her torrid past to her amnesiac brother, although narrated but not shown, recalls [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s outrageous claims in ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'', [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]]'s 1959 adaptation of [[Tennessee Williams]]'s play.\n\n==Music==\nThe Soundtrack of ''Law of Desire'' has been credited to [[Bernardo Bonezzi]]. Almod\u00f3var simply reused music from ''[[What Have I Done to Deserve This? (film)|What Have I Done to Deserve?]]'' composed by Bonezzi.  The theme Gloria, from that film, is heard over the titles. Budget constraints did not allow Almod\u00f3var to commission a full original soundtrack. Instead, he used classical pieces that were either free or cheap to obtain. [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s tenth symphony is used for the opening credits and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[Tango]] for Pablo's escape in his car. \nAlmod\u00f3var also used his own composition ''Voy a ser mama'' (''I am going to be a mother'') as incidental music. Organ religious music takes Tina to her past in the scene where she confronts the priest who abused her when she was a boy.\n\n==Songs==\nTwo songs are shown prominently in the film underlining the emotional relationship between the characters: ''[[Ne me quitte pas]]'', a French torch song, and ''Lo Dudo'', a Latin-American bolero.\n\n''Ne me quitte pas'' was written by the French Belgian singer, actor and filmmaker [[Jacques Brel]]. First recorded in 1959, it is one of Brel's best known songs and has been recorded by many artists. Almod\u00f3var chose a version sung by [[Maysa Matarazzo]], a [[bossa nova]] artist who enjoyed considerable success. The song begs the lover not to leave and promises a different world should the lover stay. It is a song of despair full of poetic images. The singer promises to \"offer you pearls of rain that come from countries where it doesn't rain, I will create a domain where love will be king, where love will be law, and where you will be queen\". In the film the song is associated to Pablo's love for Juan. It is also later incorporated in the film during the scene in which Tina performs in [[Jean Cocteau]]'s [[monologue]] play ''La Voix humaine'' ([[The Human Voice]]) and the song is lip synced by Ada in the play. The sentimentality of the song reflects Tina's lost for the love of Ada's mother, and Ada's own feelings fearing that she is going to be separated from Tina, her surrogate mother.\n\nCentral to the film is the song ''Lo Dudo'' (''I doubt it'') a [[bolero]] by [[Los Panchos]], a Latin American [[trio (music)|trio]] formed in the 1940s. ''Lo Dudo'', written by Los Panchos's second voice [[Chucho Navarro]], has been immensely popular. It epitomizes Antonio's love for Pablo and he sings it during their last hour together. Almod\u00f3var described the song as key in the film. A song of spurned love, its lyrics fit the plot referring in the film to Antonio's love for Pablo and his belief that Pablo would not find a purer love than his.\n\nThe Italian romantic song ''Guarda Che Luna'' (''Look at the moon''), written by [[Fred Buscaglione]], frames the scene by the lighthouse in which Antonio confronts Juan. The romantic nature of its words and melody act as a counterpoint to the violence of Juan's murder.\n\nThe film closes with ''Dejame recordar'' (''Let me remember''), a bolero by Cuban singer and cabaret actor [[Bola de Nieve]]. \"Who will erase from your life the memory of me, and will allow this love to be forgotten? This love made out of blood and pain, poor love...\"\n\n==DVD release==\nThe film was released on DVD in the United States on 3 November 2009, originally as part of the box set pack ''Viva Pedro''.
