The film focuses on events in Ip's life that supposedly took place in the city of [[Foshan]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]]. The film was directed by [[Wilson Yip]], and stars [[Donnie Yen]] as Ip Man, with [[Combat in film|martial arts choreography]] by [[Sammo Hung]]. The supporting cast includes [[Simon Yam]], [[Lynn Hung]], [[Gordon Lam|Lam Ka-tung]], [[Xing Yu]], [[Hiroyuki Ikeuchi]], and [[Tenma Shibuya]]. The film was a co-production between China and Hong Kong, and was the last film to be distributed by Mandarin Films.\n\n''Ip Man'' is the first film in the [[Ip Man (film series)|''Ip Man'' film series]]. It premiered in Beijing on 10 December 2008, and was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 19 December 2008, receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences. Before the film's release, Raymond Wong announced that there would be a sequel; a second installment titled ''[[Ip Man 2]]'', was released in April 2010, a third installment titled ''[[Ip Man 3]]'' was released in 2015, and ''[[Ip Man 4|Ip Man 4: The Finale]]'' was released in 2019.<ref name=\"Ip Man 4\">{{Citation|title=Ip Man 4|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2076298/|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> ''Ip Man'' grossed more than US$22 million worldwide, despite not being released in North America and most of Europe. Following its success, the film was nominated for 12 [[28th Hong Kong Film Awards|Hong Kong Film Awards]], winning awards for [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography|Best Action Choreography]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1935, [[Foshan]] is a hub of [[Nanquan (martial art)|Southern Chinese martial arts]], where the various schools' students compete against each other. Ip Man, the most skilled martial artist in town, maintains a discreet profile while building a reputation for skill through friendly, closed-door competitions with other masters. One day, a local troublemaker named Yuan loses his kite, which lands in a tree in the Ip family's back yard. While retrieving it, Yuan witnesses Ip defeating fellow kung fu master Liu in a sparring match. Although Ip and Liu had agreed that the news of who won would remain a secret, Yuan unwittingly spreads the story around town, inadvertently embarrassing Liu. Yuan's brother Lin, a restaurant owner and disciple of Liu, publicly embarrasses Yuan as he tries to arrange a rematch between Liu and Ip, and Yuan runs away from home.\n\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Ip and his family are forced to move into a decrepit apartment after the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] confiscates their house for use as a military headquarters. Running out of valuables to sell for food, Ip gets a job at a coal mine alongside Lin, who hopes to reconcile with his brother but has so far failed to track him down. General Miura, a Japanese [[Karate]] master, sets up an arena where Chinese martial artists can challenge his military trainees for a bag of rice. Former police officer Li Zhao, now an interpreter for the Japanese, visits the mine to recruit anyone willing to fight. Ip at first declines to participate, but agrees to go when Lin fails to return from a match.\n\nAt the arena, Ip witnesses Liu being shot in the back of the head by Miura's sadistic deputy, Colonel Sato, for picking up a bag of rice from a prior victory after yielding to three [[wikt:karateka|karateka]] in a second challenge. Deducing that Lin was killed in his fight against Miura, Ip demands a match with ten karateka at once, whom he brutally defeats. His skill arouses the interest of Miura, who insists that Ip return as soon as possible. Refusing to accept all 10 bags of [[rice]] offered for his victory, Ip quietly picks up Liu's blood-stained bag and gifts it to his surviving family.\n\nJin Shanzhao, a highly-skilled [[Northern Chinese martial arts#Northern styles|Northern Chinese martial arts]] master who once defeated all the masters in Foshan except Ip, now leads a bandit gang and harasses the workers at a [[cotton mill]] run by Ip's friend Chow Ching-chuen. Ip agrees to train the workers in Wing Chun for self-defence. The workers are able to stall the gang when they return long enough for Ip to arrive and defeat Jin and Yuan, now a part of the gang. After running Jin's gang out of Foshan, Ip confronts Yuan and gives him a small tin that belonged to Lin after informing him of his brother's death. Yuan opens the tin and finds his kite inside; this motivates Yuan to leave the gang.\n\nWhen Ip does not return to the arena, Miura sends Sato and two soldiers to track him down. After overpowering them at the apartment, Ip and his family flee and hide in Li's house. The Japanese learn about the cotton mill and take the workers hostage. Despite Li's warnings, Ip surrenders himself to the Japanese while arranging for his wife and son to be sent to [[Hong Kong]] for protection. Miura asks Ip to train the Japanese soldiers in Chinese martial arts, but Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match. Though Sato insists on executing Ip, Miura accepts the challenge to uphold his honor and crush the Chinese spirit; Sato threatens Ip with death if he does not allow the General to win.\n\nWith the people of Foshan watching, Ip defeats Miura after a long and hard fight. Looking over the cheering crowd and seeing his wife and son, Ip is shot in the shoulder by Sato. As the crowd overwhelms the Japanese soldiers, Li manages to kill Sato with his [[Nambu pistol|own gun]]. Ip is taken away by Chow amid the chaos and manages to escape with his family to Hong Kong. A closing montage and captions reveal that Ip spent the rest of his life working to spread the teachings of Wing Chun, establishing a school and training several students, including [[Bruce Lee]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Donnie Yen]] as [[Ip Man]], the son of a wealthy family and Foshan's only practitioner of the martial art form known as [[Wing Chun]].<ref name=\"Ip Man Cast and Crew\">{{cite web|title=The Cast|url=http://www.ipman-movie.com/main_en.html|publisher=[[Mandarin Films Distribution Co.

[[Principal photography]] for ''Ip Man'' began in March 2008 and ended in August; filming took place in Shanghai, which was used to architecturally recreate Foshan. During filming, conflicts arose between the producers of ''Ip Man'' and filmmaker [[Wong Kar-wai]] over the film's [[working title]]. Wong, who had been developing his own Ip Man biopic, clashed with the producers after learning that their film would be titled ''Grandmaster Ip Man'' ({{zh|t=\u4e00\u4ee3\u5b97\u5e2b\u8449\u554f}}), which was too similar to the title of Wong's film, ''[[The Grandmaster (film)|The Grandmaster]]''.\n\n''Ip Man'' is the first film based on the life of [[Ip Man]].

It was disputed when film director [[Wong Kar-wai]] announced plans to make his own Ip Man film with [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai]] while filming ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]''. Wong had planned his own Ip Man biopic titled ''The Great Master'' (\u4e00\u4ee3\u5b97\u5e08), with Leung playing the role of Ip. Wong's film, however, had been in [[development hell]], having been announced several years earlier.

Donnie Yen reprised the lead role in the sequel ''[[Ip Man 2]]'', the second feature film based on the life of Ip Man. The film focuses on Ip's movements in Hong Kong as he attempts to propagate his discipline of Wing Chun martial arts; at the end it also briefly introduces a young [[Bruce Lee]] prior to becoming one of Ip's most famed disciples. ''Ip Man 2'' was released theatrically in Hong Kong in late April 2010. [[Lynn Hung]] and [[Fan Siu-wong]] reprise their supporting roles, while martial arts choreographer [[Sammo Hung]] appears as a master of [[Hung Ga]] martial arts.\n\nYen expressed his lack of interest in making a third film, feeling that, \"''Ip Man 2'' will incontrovertibly become a classic, bettering the first.\"<ref name=\"Hung vs. Yen\">{{Cite web | title = Ip Man 2: Sammo Hung Vs Donnie Yen Round 2 - Wu-Jing.org | work = wu-jing.org | date = 30 October 2009 | url = http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/725-Ip-Man-2-Sammo-Hung-Vs-Donnie-Yen-Round-2.html | access-date = 1 March 2010 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100309062542/http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/725-Ip-Man-2-Sammo-Hung-Vs-Donnie-Yen-Round-2.html | archive-date = 9 March 2010}}</ref> Yen later stated that after ''Ip Man 2'', he would no longer be involved in a film based on Ip's life.<ref name=\"Donnie Yen Has Had Enough of Ip Man\">{{Cite web| title = Donnie Yen Has Had Enough of Ip Man - Wu-Jing.org| work = wu-jing.org| date = 8 March 2010| url = http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/795-Donnie-Yen-Has-Had-Enough-of-Ip-Man.html| access-date = 29 March 2010| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100311034958/http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/795-Donnie-Yen-Has-Had-Enough-of-Ip-Man.html| archive-date = 11 March 2010}}</ref> While both Donnie Yen and Raymond Wong were not keen on making a third Ip Man film, director Wilson Yip expressed interest in making one that would focus on the relationship between Ip and Bruce Lee. While ''Ip Man 2'' very briefly shows Lee as a child, Yip hoped to find a suitable actor to portray Lee as an adult for the third installment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Will Jay Chou Play Bruce Lee in Ip Man 3?|url=http://theblackboxoffice.com/2010/05/will-jay-chou-play-bruce-lee-in-ip-man-3/|publisher=theblackboxoffice.com|access-date=5 August 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120211235111/http://theblackboxoffice.com/2010/05/will-jay-chou-play-bruce-lee-in-ip-man-3/|archive-date = 11 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that ''[[Ip Man 3]]'' would begin shooting in 2015 with Donnie Yen reprising his role as Ip Man and Wilson Yip returning to direct.
