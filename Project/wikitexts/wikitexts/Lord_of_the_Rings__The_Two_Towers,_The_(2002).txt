R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[sequel]] to 2001's ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', the film is the second instal<!-- DO NOT CHANGE SPELLING: \"instalment\" is spelt with one \"l\" in British English! -->ment in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]]. It features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Liv Tyler]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Sean Astin]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[John Rhys-Davies]], [[Bernard Hill]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]], [[Dominic Monaghan]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Miranda Otto]], [[David Wenham]], [[Brad Dourif]], [[Karl Urban]], and [[Andy Serkis]].\n\nContinuing the plot of the previous film, it intercuts three storylines. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] continue their journey towards [[Mordor]] to destroy the [[One Ring]], meeting and joined by [[Gollum]], the ring's former keeper. [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] come to the war-torn nation of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] and are reunited with the resurrected [[Gandalf]], before fighting against the legions of the treacherous wizard [[Saruman]] at the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Helm's Deep]]. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] escape capture, meet [[Treebeard]] the [[Ent]], and help to plan an attack on [[Isengard]], fortress of Saruman.\n\n''The Two Towers'' was financed and distributed by American studio [[New Line Cinema]], but [[Production of The Lord of the Rings film series|filmed and edited]] entirely in Jackson's native [[New Zealand]], [[Back-to-back film production|concurrently]] with the other two parts of the trilogy. It premiered on 5 December 2002 at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in [[New York City]], and was then released on 18 December in the United States and on 19 December in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by both critics and audiences, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film genre. It received praise for its direction, action sequences, performances, musical score, and CGI, particularly for Gollum. It grossed over $936 million worldwide, making it the [[2002 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2002]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|third<!-- This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, do NOT adjust! --> highest-grossing film of all time]] at the time of its release, behind ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''.<ref name=\"BOM 2003\">{{cite web |title=All Time Worldwide Box Office |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031207144634/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/ |archive-date=7 December 2003}}</ref> Following subsequent reissues, it has, as of 2021, grossed over $947 million.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\nLike the other films in the trilogy, ''The Two Towers'' is widely recognized as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential films ever made]].

Please check the word count before making any additions. Please go to the talk page before making any major changes. -->\n<section begin=Plot/>Awakening from a dream of [[Gandalf]] fighting the [[Balrog]] in [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], [[Frodo Baggins]] finds himself, along with [[Samwise Gamgee]], lost in the [[Emyn Muil]] near [[Mordor]]. They discover that they are being tracked by [[Gollum]], a former bearer of the [[One Ring]]. Capturing Gollum, Frodo takes pity and allows him to guide them, reminding Sam that they will need Gollum's help to infiltrate Mordor.\n\n[[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] pursue a band of [[Uruk-hai]] to save their companions [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], entering the kingdom of Rohan. The Uruk-hai are ambushed by a group of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohirrim]], allowing Merry and Pippin to escape into [[Fangorn]] Forest. Meeting Aragorn's group, the Rohirrim's leader [[\u00c9omer]] explains that he and his men have been exiled by Rohan's king, [[Th\u00e9oden]], who is under the control of [[Saruman]] and his servant [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue]]. \u00c9omer believes Merry and Pippin were killed during the raid but leaves the group two horses. In Fangorn, Aragorn's group encounters Gandalf, who after his fight against the Balrog was resurrected as Gandalf the White to help save [[Middle-earth]].\n\nGandalf leads the trio to Rohan's capital, [[Edoras]], where Gandalf frees Th\u00e9oden from Saruman's control. Aragorn stops Th\u00e9oden from executing Wormtongue, who flees. Learning of Saruman's plans to destroy Rohan with his Uruk-hai army, Th\u00e9oden evacuates his citizens to the fortress of The Hornburg at [[Helm's Deep]]. Gandalf departs to find \u00c9omer and his followers, hoping they will fight for their restored king. Aragorn befriends Th\u00e9oden's niece, [[\u00c9owyn]], who becomes infatuated with him. When the refugees travelling to Helm's Deep are attacked by Saruman's [[Warg (Middle-earth)|Warg]]-riding Orcs, Aragorn falls from a cliff and is presumed dead. He is found by Th\u00e9odred's horse Brego and rides to Helm's Deep, witnessing Saruman's army marching to the fortress.\n\nIn [[Rivendell]], [[Arwen]] is told by her father [[Elrond]] that Aragorn will not return. He reminds her that if she remains in [[Middle-earth]], she will outlive Aragorn by thousands of years, and she reluctantly departs for [[Valinor]]. Elrond is contacted by [[Galadriel]] of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], who convinces him that the Elves should honour their alliance to men, and they dispatch an army of Elves to Helm's Deep.\n\nIn Fangorn, Merry and Pippin meet [[Treebeard]], an [[Ent]]. Convincing Treebeard that they are allies, they are brought to an Ent Council, where the Ents decide not to take part in the coming war. Pippin asks Treebeard to take them in the direction of [[Isengard]], where they witness the deforestation caused by Saruman's war effort. Enraged, Treebeard and the Ents storm Isengard, trapping Saruman in his tower.\n\nAragorn arrives at Helm's Deep, bringing word that Saruman's army is close and Th\u00e9oden must prepare for battle despite being vastly outnumbered. The army of Elves from Lothl\u00f3rien arrives, as does Saruman's army, and a battle ensues. The Uruk-hai breach the outer wall with explosives and during the ensuing charge kill the Elves' commander, Haldir. The defenders retreat into the keep, where Aragorn convinces Th\u00e9oden to meet the Uruk-hai in one last charge. At dawn, as the defenders are overwhelmed, Gandalf and \u00c9omer arrive with the Rohirrim, turning the tide of the battle. The surviving Uruk-hai flee into Fangorn Forest and are killed by the trees. Gandalf warns that Sauron will retaliate.\n\nGollum leads Frodo and Sam through the [[Dead Marshes]] to the [[Minor places in Middle-earth|Black Gate]], but recommends they enter Mordor by another route. Frodo and Sam are captured by Rangers of Ithilien led by [[Faramir]], younger brother of the late [[Boromir]]. Frodo helps Faramir catch Gollum to save him from being killed by the Rangers. Learning of the One Ring, Faramir takes his captives to [[Gondor]] to bring the ring to his father [[Denethor]]. Passing through the besieged city of [[Minor places in Middle-earth|Osgiliath]], Frodo tries to explain to Faramir the true nature of the ring, and Sam explains that Boromir was driven mad by its power. A [[Nazg\u00fbl]] nearly captures Frodo, who falls under the ring's power, but Sam saves him and reminds him that they are fighting for the good still left in Middle-earth. Impressed by Frodo's resolve, Faramir releases them. Feeling betrayed, Gollum decides he will reclaim the Ring by leading Frodo to \"[[Shelob|Her]]\" upon arriving at [[Minor places in Middle-earth|Cirith Ungol]].<section end=Plot/>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further-text|[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)#Cast|Cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]]}}\n[[File:Twotowerscast2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.36|From left to right: [[Karl Urban]], [[Bernard Hill]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Orlando Bloom]], and [[Viggo Mortensen]].

Braun, ''The Lord of the Films'' (ECW Press, 2009).</ref>\n\n==Comparison to the source material==\nThe screenwriters did not originally script ''The Two Towers'' as its own film: instead, parts of it were the conclusion to ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', the first of two planned films under [[Miramax]].<ref>{{cite web |title=20 Questions with Peter Jackson |publisher=Peter Jackson online transcript from Ain't It Cool News |url=http://members.tripod.com/peter_jackson_online/lotr/articles/20_questions2.htm |access-date=24 October 2006}}</ref> However, as the two films became a trilogy under New Line, Jackson, Walsh and Boyens shuffled their scripts. ''The Two Towers'' was the most difficult of the ''Rings'' films to make, having neither a clear beginning nor end to focus the script.<ref name=\"story\">{{cite video |title=From Book to Script: Finding the Story |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line |date=2003}}</ref> Nonetheless, they had a clear decision with making the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Helm's Deep]] the climax, a decision affecting the whole story's moods and style.\n\nThe most notable difference between the book and the film is the structure. Tolkien's ''The Two Towers'' is split into two parts; one follows the war in Rohan, while the other focuses on the journey of Frodo and Sam. The film omits the book's opening, Boromir's death, which was used as a linear climax at the end of ''The Fellowship of the Ring''. Also, the film climaxes with the Battle of Helm's Deep, while the book ends with the Fellowship going to Isengard and Frodo's confrontation with [[Shelob]], scenes which were left for the film adaptation of ''The Return of the King''. This was done partly to fit more closely the timeline indicated by the book.\n\nOne notable change in plotting is that in the film [[Th\u00e9oden]] is [[Spirit possession|possessed]] by Saruman, whereas in the book he is simply depressed and deluded by Wormtongue. Afterwards, in the film, Th\u00e9oden is still unsure of what to do, and flees to Helm's Deep. In the book he rides out to war, only ending up besieged when he considers helping Erkenbrand. Erkenbrand does not exist in the films: his character is combined with \u00c9omer as the Rohirrim general who arrives with Gandalf at the film's end. \u00c9omer himself is present during the entire battle in the book.\n\nOn the way to Helm's Deep, the refugees from Edoras are attacked by [[Warg (Middle-earth)|Wargs]]. The scene is possibly inspired by one in the book cut from ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' where it is the Fellowship who battle them. Here, a new subplot is created where Aragorn falls over a cliff, and is assumed to be dead; Jackson added it to create tension.<ref name=\"DWC\">{{cite video |people=Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens |title=Director/Writers Commentary |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line |date=2003}}</ref> This scene also resonates with a new subplot regarding Arwen, where she decides to leave Middle-earth after losing hope in the long-term possibilities of her love. In the book, Arwen's role is primarily recorded in the Appendices, and she is never depicted as considering such an act.\n\nA larger change was originally planned: Arwen and Elrond would visit [[Galadriel]], and Arwen would accompany an army of Elves to Helm's Deep to fight alongside Aragorn. During shooting, the script changed, both from writers coming up with better ideas to portray the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, as well as poor fan reaction.<ref name=\"story\" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Clint |last=Morris |title=Interview: Liv Tyler |publisher=Moviehole |date=5 December 2002 |url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20021205_714.html |access-date=16 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011232013/http://moviehole.net/news/20021205_714.html |archive-date=11 October 2007}}</ref> The new scene of Arwen leaving for the West was created, and the conversation scene remains, edited to be a flashback to a conversation between them in Rivendell, on the evening before the Fellowship's departure.<ref name=\"story\" /> A conversation between Elrond and Galadriel in Lothl\u00f3rien was edited to be a [[telepathy|telepathic]] one.<ref>{{cite video |title=Editorial: Refining the Story |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line |date=2003}}</ref> Nonetheless, one major change (already filmed) remained that could not be reversed: the Elven warriors fighting at Helm's Deep, although Jackson and Boyens found this romantic and stirring and a reference to how, in the Appendices of ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Galadriel and the Elves of Lothl\u00f3rien, and [[Thranduil]] of Mirkwood were first attacked by an army out of [[Dol Guldur]] in [[Mirkwood]], and then later counter-attacked and assaulted the fortress itself.<ref name=\"story\" />\n\nAnother change is the fact Treebeard does not immediately decide to go to war. This adds to the tension, and Boyens describes it as making Merry and Pippin \"more than luggage\".<ref name=\"DWC\" /> Here, the Hobbits show Treebeard what Saruman has done to the forest, prompting his decision to act. Another structural change is that the Hobbits meet Gandalf the White early on, explaining why the Hobbits do not react to his return when they meet him again following Isengard's destruction. This was explained in the book by Gandalf arriving at Isengard in the middle of the night to talk to Treebeard.\n\nThe filmmakers' decision to leave [[Shelob]] for the third film meant that Faramir had to become an obstacle for Frodo and Sam.<ref name=\"story\" /> In the book, Faramir (like Aragorn) quickly recognises the Ring as a danger and a temptation, and does not hesitate long before letting Frodo and Sam go. In the film, Faramir first decides that the Ring shall go to Gondor and his father [[Denethor]], as a way to prove his worth. In the film, Faramir takes Frodo, Sam and the Ring to the Battle of Osgiliath\u2014they do not go there in the book. Jackson winks to readers with Sam's line, \"By all rights we shouldn't even be here, but we are.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} After seeing how strongly the Ring affects Frodo during the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] attack, Faramir changes his mind and lets them go. These changes reshape the book's contrast between Faramir and Boromir, who in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' attempted to take the Ring for himself. On the other hand, (which can be seen only in the film's extended version), it is actually their father who wants the Ring and urges Boromir to get it, while Faramir only wants to prove himself to his father. Boyens contends these plot changes were needed to keep the Ring menacing. Wenham commented on the [[DVD-Video|DVD]] documentaries that he had not read the book prior to reading the script, so the film's version of Faramir was the Faramir he knew. When he later read the book and noticed the major difference, he approached the writers about it, and they explained to him that if he did say \"I wouldn't pick that thing up even if it lay by the wayside\", it would basically strip the One Ring of all corruptive power.<ref name=\"story\" />\n\nThe meaning of the title itself, 'The Two Towers', was changed. While Tolkien considered several possible sets of towers<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|#140 & #143}}<br />{{ME-ref|A&I|#178}}</ref> he eventually created a final cover illustration<ref>{{ME-ref|A&I|#180}}</ref> and wrote a note included at the end of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' which identified them as [[Minas Morgul]] and [[Isengard#Orthanc|Orthanc]].<ref>{{ME-ref|Bibliography|92 (23 February 1954 entry)}}</ref> Jackson's film names them as Orthanc and [[Barad-d\u00fbr]], symbolic of an evil alliance out to destroy Men that forms the film's plot point. The film depicted Saruman openly presenting himself outright as Sauron's servant, whereas this association was not explicitly stated in the novel (and indeed analysis by Gandalf and Aragorn in the chapter \"The White Rider\" stated that there was a rivalry instead, as Saruman was afraid of the prospect of being at war with Sauron, if Rohan and Gondor fell).\n\n==Production==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series|l1=Production of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series}}\n\n===Production design===\nWhen [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]] joined the project in late 1997, Helm's Deep was the first structure he was tasked to design. At 1:35 scale, it was one of the first miniatures built for the film, and was part of the 45-minute video that sold the project to New Line. It was primarily drawn from an illustration Lee had once done for the book, though the curved wall featured in the film was proposed by fellow illustrator and designer [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]]. Used in the film for wide shots, Jackson also used this miniature to plan the battle, using 40,000 toy soldiers.<ref name=\"Big-atures\">{{cite video |title=Big-atures |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |date=2003}}</ref>\n\nHelm's Deep, a pivotal part of the film's narrative, was built at Dry Creek Quarry with its gate, a ramp, and a wall, which included a removable section as well as the tower on a second level. A 1:4-scale miniature of Helm's Deep that ran {{convert|50|ft}} wide was used for [[forced perspective]] shots,<ref name=\"Design\">{{cite video |title=Designing Middle-earth |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |date=2003}}</ref> as well as the major explosion sequence.<ref name=\"Big-atures\" />\n\nThe film explores the armies of Middle-earth. John Howe was the basic designer of the evil forces of Middle Earth, with the Uruk-hai being the first army approved by Jackson. Howe also designed a special crossbow for the Uruk-Hai characters, which was significant because it did not require external tools to rearm. This design was the realization of a 16th-century manuscript.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Also created were 100 Elven suits of armour, for which emphasis was placed on Autumnal colours due to the theme of Elves leaving Middle-earth. Two hundred and fifty suits were also made for the Rohirrim. The designs for Rohan were based on Germanic and Anglo-Saxon patterns, with most of the weapons designed by John Howe and forged by Peter Lyon. Each sword took 3 to 6 days to make.<ref name=\"Weta Workshop\">{{cite video |title=Weta Workshop |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |date=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe exterior of the Rohirrim's capital of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)#Other settlements|Edoras]], including its thatched roofs, took six months to build on Mount Sunday. The interior of the buildings doubled as offices and lunch halls. The interior of the Hall of Edoras was filmed at Stone Street Studios with tapestries designed by Lee, and Th\u00e9oden's wooden throne was partly created by his daughter.<ref name=\"Design\" /> Hill endured heavy make-up for the possession scene where his skin was pulled back and released for increased wrinkles. Dourif shaved off his eyebrows and put potato flakes as [[dandruff]] in his hair for unnerving effect.\n\nThrough Frodo and Sam's story, the film also provides a look at Mordor and Gondor. Barad-d\u00fbr is fully seen in a tracking shot, a design which Howe called a mockery of Gothic Cathedrals. He and Lee created the Black Gate (though a typo in the script made the miniature into two<ref name=\"Big-atures\" />) and Osgiliath, a ruined city reflecting London during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] or Berlin in 1945.<ref name=\"Filming\">{{cite video |title=Cameras in Middle-earth: Filming The Two Towers |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |date=2003}}</ref> The set on a backlot was based around a bridge and reused some of Moria.<ref name=\"Design\" />\n\n===Principal photography===\n[[File:MtSunday.jpg|thumb|The hill known as Mount Sunday, in [[Canterbury Region]], provided the location for Edoras]]\n''The Two Towers'' shared principal photography with ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' and ''The Return of the King''. The trilogy was filmed between 11 October 1999 and 22 December 2000. The scenes which take place in Rohan were shot earlier in the production, during which time Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies' stunt double Brett Beattie sustained many injuries. Mortensen broke two toes when he kicked an Orc helmet while filming the scene in which he, Legolas, and Gimli find the remains of the Uruk-hai and believing Merry and Pippin to be dead (a shot which is included in the film). Furthermore, during filming Bloom fell off his horse and cracked three ribs, and Beattie dislocated his knee. These injuries led to the actors suffering two days of pain during the running sequence in the first act of the film, leading Jackson to jokingly refer to them as \"The Walking Wounded.\"<ref name=\"Filming\" />\n\nThe filming of the Battle of Helm's Deep took approximately three months, with most of the nighttime shots handled by John Mahaffie. Some injuries were sustained during the filming of the sequence, including Mortensen chipping his tooth, and Bernard Hill's ear getting slashed.<ref name=\"Filming\" /> The sequence also features 500 extras, who insulted each other in [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]],<ref name=\"warriors\">{{cite video |title=Warriors of the Third Age |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |date=2003}}</ref> and improvised scenes such as the Uruk-hai stamping their spears before the beginning of the battle.<ref name=\"Filming\" /> However, there was alleged annoyance among the film's crew for the strength of the gates, which were claimed to be ''too'' reinforced during the Battering Ram scene.<ref name=\"Design\" /> Mortensen greatly respected the stunt team, and head butted them often as a sign of that respect.<ref name=\"warriors\" />\n\nWood and Astin were joined by Serkis on 13 April 2000.<ref>{{cite book |last=Serkis |first=Andy |title=Gollum: How we made Movie Magic |publisher=Harpercollins |year=2003 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lordofringsg00serk/page/24 24] |isbn=0-618-39104-5 | url-access = registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lordofringsg00serk/page/24}}</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\nAs with ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', [[Jim Rygiel]] served as the visual effects supervisor for ''The Two Towers'', while newcomer [[Joe Letteri]] joined the visual effects team to supervise [[Andy Serkis]]'s [[motion capture]] performance in the creation of the character [[Gollum]]. During the production of ''The Two Towers'' [[Weta Digital]] doubled their staff<ref name=\"Digital\">{{cite video |title=Weta Digital |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |date=2002}}</ref> of 260.<ref>{{cite video |title=Weta Digital (''The Fellowship of the Ring'' Appendices) |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |date=2003}}</ref> In total, they would produce 73 minutes of digital effects with 799 shots.<ref name=\"Digital\" /> The film would feature their first challenge in creating a battle scene, as well as creating two digital characters who needed to act rather than be a set piece, unlike [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|the previous film]]'s Cave Troll and Balrog.<ref name=\"Weta Workshop\" />\n\n;Gollum \n[[File:Two Towers-Gollum.jpg|thumb|Gollum eating a fish]]\n\nWeta began animating Gollum in late 1998 to convince New Line they could achieve the effect. [[Andy Serkis]] \"played\" Gollum by providing his voice and movements on set, as well as performing within the [[motion capture]] suit later on. His scenes were filmed twice, with and without him. Originally, Gollum was set to solely be a CGI character, but Jackson was so impressed by Serkis' audition tape that they used him on set as well.\n\nGollum's CGI model was also redesigned during 2001 when Serkis was cast as Sm\u00e9agol, Gollum's former self, so as to give the impression Andy Serkis as Sm\u00e9agol transforms into the CGI Gollum. The original model can still be glimpsed briefly in the first film. Over Christmas 2001, the crew proceeded to reanimate all the previous shots accordingly within two months. Another problem was that the crew realized that the cast performed better in the takes which physically included Serkis. In the end, the CGI Gollum was [[Rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] and animated on top of these scenes.\n\nSerkis' motion capture was generally used to animate Gollum's body, except for some difficult shots such as him crawling upside down. Gollum's face was animated manually, often using recordings of Serkis as a guide. Gino Acevedo supervised realistic skin tones, which took four hours per frame to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]].<ref>{{cite video |title=The Taming of Sm\u00e9agol |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |date=2003}}</ref>\n\nWhile the novel alludes to a division within his mind, the film depicts him as having a [[Dissociative identity disorder|split personality]]. The two personas\u2014the childlike Sm\u00e9agol and the evil Gollum\u2014are established during a scene in which they argue over remaining loyal to Frodo. The two personalities talk to each other, as established by contrasting camera angles and by Serkis altering his voice and physicality for each persona.\n\n;Treebeard \n[[Treebeard]] took between 28 and 48 hours per frame to [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]].<ref name=\"Digital\" /> For scenes where he interacts with Merry and Pippin, a 14-foot-tall puppet was built on a wheel. Weta took [[polyurethane|urethane]] moulds of tree [[bark (botany)|bark]] and applied them to the sculpt of Treebeard to create his wooden skin. [[Dominic Monaghan]] and [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]] sat on bicycle seats concealed into Treebeard's hands to avoid discomfort and were left alone on set sitting in the puppet's hands during breaks. The puppet was shot against [[Chroma key|bluescreen]].<ref name=\"Weta Workshop\" />\n\n===Score===\n{{Main|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (soundtrack)|l1=''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (soundtrack)}}\n{{Broader|Music of The Lord of the Rings film series{{!}}Music of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series}}\nThe [[Film score|musical score]] for ''The Two Towers'' was composed, orchestrated, and conducted by [[Howard Shore]], who also composed the music for the other two films in the series.

The song does not appear in the book, and the tune is a variation upon a theme of the [[r\u00edmur]] [[Iceland]]ic folk tradition; it can be heard as part of track 7 in the 1999 recording of a musical version of the [[Edda]] by [[Sequentia (music group)|Sequentia]].<ref>Sequentia, ''Edda&nbsp;\u2014 Myths from medieval Iceland'', [[Sony BMG|Deutsche Harmonia Mundi]], 1999</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]].

French commended the battle scenes and the visual style of the film, relating it to the paintings of \"[[Caspar David Friedrich]], the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]], [[Art Nouveau]] illustrations for children's books, and the apocalyptic biblical landscapes ... of the Victorian visionary [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]\".

Yet these preparations count as payoffs too ... Seldom has a popular entertainment set its stage so carefully or evocatively, with such lavish respect for its audience.\" Morgenstern also highlighted the digital effects and the battle scenes, and said of the series \"''The Lord of the Rings'' continues to stake its singular claim on movie history; it's a gift of epic proportions.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1040337236592860073|title=The Hobbits May Be Short, But 'Two Towers' Stands Tall|first=Joe|last=Morgenstern|newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=20 December 2002|via=www.wsj.com}}</ref> In his review for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', Alexander Walker wrote that the Battle of Helm's Deep was \"probably the greatest battlepiece composed for the screen since Eisenstein's ''Ivan the Terrible''\", and that with ''The Two Towers'' the trilogy had achieved \"a majestic proportion, chivalric and quixotic, earthly and magical, an experience that reaches beyond the dimensions of the cinema screen and somehow reflects the global unease of the world in the first years of the 21st century\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/darkness-on-middle-earth-7428288.html|title=Darkness on Middle Earth|first=Alexanderr Walker, Evening|last=Standard|date=10 April 2012|website=www.standard.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn his review for ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[David Ansen]] commended Jackson's direction of the battle scenes, writing \"Few people can stage a battle -- and the eyepopping siege of Helms Deep is one of the most spectacular you'll ever see -- with such sweep and clarity that the carnage doesn't seem an oppressive end in itself\". Ansen also praised the complexity of the character of Gollum, commenting \"While everyone else in Tolkien's myth falls neatly into the camps of Good and Evil, the self-lacerating Gollum is at war with himself.

An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time.\" Westbrook lauded Jackson's ability to temper the spectacular scenes \"with some heartstring-tugging moments - peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages, Aragorn and Arwen's troubled relationship, and, of course, the return of Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen, superb as ever), one of the film's most powerful, memorable images that may well leave Ring devotees a little misty-eyed.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/lord-rings-two-towers-review/|title=Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers|website=Empire}}</ref> A less enthusiastic review was written in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by [[Peter Bradshaw]], who had already written a mixed review of ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/dec/14/lordoftherings1|title=The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring|date=14 December 2001|website=The Guardian}}</ref> Bradshaw gave ''The Two Towers'' three stars out of five, appreciating it as \"a very watchable, distinctive, if over-extended FX spectacle\".
