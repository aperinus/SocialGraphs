It was directed by [[Diane Keaton]], and stars Keaton, [[Meg Ryan]], [[Lisa Kudrow]] and [[Walter Matthau]] in his final film role. The film is based on [[Delia Ephron]]'s 1995 novel of the same name.\n\n==Plot==\nGeorgia Mozell, Eve Marks and Maddy Mozell are adult sisters. Self-obsessed Georgia (Keaton) is the editor of her own wildly successful self-titled women's magazine. Maddy (Kudrow) is a vacuous [[soap opera]] actress who has always struggled for her own identity. Party planner Eve (Ryan) struggles to balance her family life with her career while also caring for their father. All three sisters are still wounded by their parents' divorce, after many years of acrimony, which resulted in their mother Pat (Leachman) essentially abandoning them all.\n\nDespite being as busy with her own life as the others, Eve is the only one of the three who deals with the long term hospitalization of their cantankerous seventy-nine-year-old father, Lou Mozell (Matthau), when he enters the early stages of [[dementia]] and has to be hospitalized. Lou has a history of alcoholism and womanizing, and despite a hurtful incident years earlier, Eve takes charge of her father's care. In addition to answering his frequent, often incoherent phone calls, she visits him in the hospital nearly every day. Maddy occasionally visits as well, but also saddles Eve with the care of her large dog, Buck.\n\nFlashbacks show Eve, Maddy and Georgia visiting Lou one Christmas after he attempted suicide after Pat left him. Eve confronts her mother, who admits she only had children because she believed that was what was normal, but discovered it wasn't actually what she wanted out of life. She goes back to her father and they go Christmas tree shopping together. Lou's joyful nature helps Eve to forget the pain of her mother's rejection.\n\nIn another flashback, Lou drunkenly crashes the birthday party of Eve's young son, Jesse, and when Eve tells him to leave he angrily tells her that she was a mistake. Eve's husband, outraged, forces Lou to leave and declares he's never to return to their house again.\n\nFed up and overwhelmed with caring for her father, siblings and an especially demanding client, Eve disconnects all the phones in her house. At an event Eve planned, where Georgia is the keynote speaker, Georgia uses Lou's illness to promote her magazine and claims that she's been more involved in his care than she actually is. Afterward, Maddy, Eve and Georgia argue viciously, until they're halted by the news that Lou's health has worsened.\n\nAll three sisters rush to the hospital and reconcile at their father's bedside. As they wait for Lou to emerge from a coma, they try to remember the name of an actress whose name Eve has been struggling to recall for weeks. Lou suddenly says it's [[June Allyson]] before passing away.\n\nSome time later, Eve, Maddy and Georgia are together in Eve's kitchen for Thanksgiving. Eve teaches Georgia how to make her stuffing recipe, which Georgia had previously stolen and given to a newspaper as hers. Georgia and Maddy begin to playfully throw flour at each other, and Eve takes a moment to enjoy being together with her sisters before joining in.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Eve Mozell Marks \n**Paige Wolfe as Young Eve\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Georgia Mozell \n**Katie Stratton as Young Georgia \n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Maddy Mozell \n**Talia-Lynn Prairie as Young Maddy\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Lou Mozell\n**[[Charles Matthau]] as Young Lou\n* [[Adam Arkin]] as Joe Marks\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Pat Mozell\n**Kristina Dorn as Young Pat\n* [[Jesse James (actor)|Jesse James]] as Jesse Marks \n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Esther\n* [[Tracee Ellis Ross]] as Kim\n* [[Maree Cheatham]] as Angie\n* [[Myndy Crist]] as Dr. Kelly\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Madge Turner\n* [[Stephanie Ittleson]] as Victoria\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was released in the United States on February 18, 2000, to relatively negative reviews.
