In addition to some of their debutante parties, it covers their frequent informal after-hours gatherings at a friend's [[Upper East Side]] apartment, where they discuss life, philosophy and their fate; form attachments, romances and intrigues; and react to an interesting but less well-to-do newcomer.

After the ball, a mix-up leads to his meeting a small group of young [[Upper East Side]] socialites known as the Sally Fowler Rat Pack, after the girl whose apartment they use for after-hours parties. Believing that they accidentally stole a taxi from Tom, they decide to invite him to their after-hours party, to prevent ill feelings.\n\nTom decides to attend the party, and befriends several other attendees, including Nick Smith, a cynic who takes Tom under his wing; Audrey, a shy girl who enjoys [[Regency era|Regency-era]] literature and develops a crush on Tom; and Charlie, an overly philosophical friend with an unrequited love for Audrey. Tom learns that he and the Rat Pack have some common friends, including his ex-girlfriend Serena Slocum, with whom he remains infatuated.\n\nUnder Nick's tutelage, Tom ingratiates himself to the Rat Pack and soon becomes a full-fledged member. Much of the film is composed of dialogues in which Tom and the Rat Pack discuss the nebulous social scene they occupy, including how they are coming of age just as the culture in which they were raised is ending, leaving them with uncertain social futures. During these discussions, Tom reveals that he, too, was raised wealthy, but that his father abandoned the family to marry another woman, leaving Tom and his mother with limited financial resources. As a result, Tom harbors a love\u2013hate relationship with wealth and the upper class.\n\nSerena has been dating Rick Von Sloneker, a young, [[Hereditary title|titled]] [[aristocrat]] notorious for his [[womanizing]]. At a party after the [[International Debutante Ball]], Nick alienates himself from the group by accusing Rick of getting a girl drunk and convincing her to \"[[group sex|pull a train]]\" several years before, after which she committed suicide. Nick admits that the story was a \"composite\" of incidents from Rick's life, but insists that it was based on real events. Shortly thereafter, Nick leaves Manhattan, giving Tom his [[top hat]] as a token of friendship.\n\nBelieving that Tom is not interested in her romantically, Audrey decides to leave Manhattan to spend the rest of vacation in [[the Hamptons]] with Rick and another girl from the Rat Pack named Cynthia. Realizing that he has developed feelings for Audrey, Tom recruits Charlie to help him rescue her from Rick. The two travel to the Hamptons together, bonding en route. Against their expectations, they arrive to find Audrey in no peril. Tom and Charlie nonetheless instigate a fight with Rick, which ends with them being kicked out of his beach house. Afterward, Tom and Audrey talk on the beach, with Audrey saying that she is planning to attend college in France, and Tom contemplating going to visit her there. Tom, Audrey, and Charlie begin [[hitchhiking]] together towards Manhattan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Carolyn Farina]] as Audrey Rouget\n* Edward Clements as Tom Townsend\n* [[Chris Eigeman|Christopher Eigeman]] as Nick Smith\n* [[Taylor Nichols]] as Charlie Black\n* [[Allison Rutledge-Parisi|Allison Parisi]] as Jane Clark\n* [[Dylan Hundley]] as Sally Fowler\n* [[Isabel Gillies]] as Cynthia McLean\n* Bryan Leder as Fred Neff\n* Will Kempe as Rick Von Sloneker\n* Ellia Thompson as Serena Slocum\n* Stephen Uys as Victor Lemley\n* Roger W.
