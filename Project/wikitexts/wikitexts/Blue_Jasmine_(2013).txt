The film tells the story of a rich [[Manhattan]] socialite ([[Cate Blanchett]]) who falls on hard times and has to move into her working-class sister's ([[Sally Hawkins]]) apartment in San Francisco.\n\nThe film received a limited release on July 26, 2013, in New York and Los Angeles, before expanding nationwide on August 23, 2013. The film was met with critical acclaim, particularly for Blanchett's performance.<ref name=\"Vanity\" /><ref name=\"tri-cityherald\" /> Blanchett won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and Hawkins and Allen were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Original Screenplay]], respectively. Blanchett also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]], the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role|SAG Award]], and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]]. The film was also a box office success, earning $99.1 million worldwide against a budget of $18 million.<ref name=budget/><ref name=bom/>\n\n==Plot==\nJasmine Francis disembarks in San Francisco after a flight from New York City. She takes a taxi to her sister Ginger's apartment, where Ginger is dismayed to learn that Jasmine traveled first class despite claiming to be broke. Jasmine has recently suffered a [[nervous breakdown]], and having incurred heavy debts, has been forced to seek refuge with her sister.\n\nA series of flashbacks reveals that Jasmine's husband, money manager Hal Francis, was arrested for defrauding his clients. Ginger and her husband, Augie, were among Hal's victims; he swindled them out of $200,000 in lottery winnings that Augie had wanted to start a business with, and their marriage fell apart. Hal dies by suicide in prison after being publicly disgraced. Jasmine's stepson Danny subsequently dropped out of [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and severed all ties with Jasmine. Following Hal's death, Jasmine began drinking heavily and abusing [[anti-anxiety]] medication. She also developed a habit of talking to herself about her past.\n\nGinger is now dating a mechanic called Chili, whom Jasmine detests for his lowbred and coarse manners. Jasmine considers becoming an [[interior designer]] because of her \"great taste\" and past experience in decorating her homes. She wants to take online courses, but having no computer skills, she decides to take a class in computers to gain basic proficiency. With no income, she grudgingly takes a job as a receptionist with a dentist, who harasses her with unwanted sexual advances. When he assaults her, she fights him off and quits.\n\nJasmine's situation improves when she meets a wealthy widower, Dwight Westlake, at a party in Marin County north of San Francisco. Dwight is a diplomat aspiring to become a congressman. She poses as an interior designer, telling him that her husband was a surgeon who died of a heart attack. Dwight is impressed by her stylishness and invites her to decorate his new home. Ginger begins a romance with Al, whom she met at the same party. She breaks up with Chili, who begs her not to leave him. Eventually, she discovers that Al is married and reconciles with Chili, realizing she has been influenced by Jasmine to believe Chili was beneath her.\n\nJasmine develops a romance with Dwight, and he is about to buy her an engagement ring, when they bump into Augie outside the jewelry store. Augie rails at Jasmine about what Hal did to Ginger and him. Augie also reveals that Danny is living nearby in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and is now married. Dwight is outraged that Jasmine lied to him and calls off the engagement. Jasmine goes to Oakland and finds Danny, who tells Jasmine he never wants to see her again because of what she did to his father.\n\nIt is revealed that Jasmine finally learned of Hal's many affairs and confronted him. When he told her he wanted to divorce her to be with a 19-year-old ''[[au pair]]'', Jasmine, in a moment of blind rage, called the FBI to inform the authorities of Hal's fraudulent business dealings, which led to his arrest, and subsequent suicide.\n\nJasmine returns to her sister's apartment and finds Ginger back with Chili, who is now moving in. Jasmine and Chili needle each other, and Jasmine is furious when Ginger takes his side. Jasmine lies to Ginger, claiming that she is going to marry Dwight, and tells her she is moving out that day. Leaving the door open as she exits the apartment, she walks to a park bench, sits, and begins muttering to herself.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Jeanette \"Jasmine\" Francis, Hal's ex-wife, Danny's stepmother, Ginger's sister, Nora's friend and Dwight's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Ginger, Jasmine's sister, Augie's ex-wife and Chili's girlfriend\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Hal Francis, Jasmine's husband and Danny's father\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as Dwight Westlake, Jasmine's suitor\n* [[Louis C.K.]] as Al Munsinger, Ginger's lover\n* [[Andrew Dice Clay]] as Augie, Ginger's ex-husband\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Chili, Ginger's boyfriend and Eddie's friend\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Dr. Flicker, the dentist who employs Jasmine\n* [[Alden Ehrenreich]] as Danny Francis, Hal's son and Jasmine's stepson\n**[[Charlie Tahan]] as Young Danny Francis\n* [[Tammy Blanchard]] as Nora, Jasmine's friend in the Hamptons \n* [[Max Casella]] as Eddie, Chili's friend\n* [[Glenn Fleshler]] as Hal and Jasmine's friend\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn preparation for her role, Blanchett explained, \"I did a lot of people watching. I drank my fair share of ros\u00e9. In the end I had to play the anti-heroine that Woody's written, but of course I thought about the [[Madoff investment scandal|Madoff scandal]], because that's the holocaust of the financial crisis.
