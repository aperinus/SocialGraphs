The film stars [[Roddy Piper]], [[Keith David]], and [[Meg Foster]], the film follows an unnamed [[Vagrant|drifter]]{{efn|The character is referred to as \"Nada\" in the film's credits, which is Spanish for \"Nothing\"; in the original short story, the name of the character is George Nada. \"Nada\" is also the name of a short [[comic book]] published in ''[[Alien Encounters (comics)|Alien Encounters]]'' in 1986, which was adapted from the same short story as ''They Live''.}} who discovers through special sunglasses that the ruling class are aliens concealing their appearance and manipulating people to consume, breed, and conform to the [[status quo]] via [[subliminal messages]] in [[mass media]].\n\nThe film was a minor success at the time of its release, debuting at #1 at the North American box office. It initially received negative reviews from critics, who lambasted its social commentary, writing, and acting; however, like Carpenter's other films, it later gained a [[cult following]] and experienced a significantly more favorable critical reception. It is now regarded by many as a largely underrated work. The film has also entered [[popular culture]], and notably had a lasting effect on [[street art]] (particularly that of [[Shepard Fairey]]), while its nearly six-minute alley brawl between the protagonists has made appearances on all-time lists for best fight scenes.\n\n==Plot==\nA homeless drifter\u2014credited as \"Nada\"\u2014comes to [[Los Angeles]] in search of a job. While out on the street, he sees a [[Open-air preaching|street preacher]] warning that \"they\" have recruited the rich and powerful to control humanity. Nada finds employment at a construction site and is befriended by coworker Frank, who invites him to live in a [[shanty town]] soup kitchen led by a man named Gilbert.\n\nThat night, a hacker takes over television broadcasts, claiming that scientists have discovered signals that are enslaving the population and keeping them in a dream-like state, and that the only way to stop it is to shut off the signal at its source. Those watching the broadcast complain of headaches. Nada secretly follows Gilbert and the preacher into a nearby church and discovers them meeting with a group that includes the hacker. He sees scientific equipment and cardboard boxes inside. Nada is discovered by the blind preacher and escapes.\n\nThe shantytown and church are both destroyed in a police raid in the same night, and the hacker and preacher are beaten by riot police. The following day, Nada retrieves one of the boxes from the church and takes a pair of sunglasses from it, hiding the rest in a trash can. Nada discovers that the sunglasses make the world appear monochrome, but also reveal [[subliminal messages]] in the media to consume, reproduce, and conform. The glasses also reveal that many people are actually aliens with skull-like faces.\n\nWhen Nada mocks an alien woman at a supermarket, she alerts other aliens via a wristwatch-like device. Nada leaves but is confronted by two alien police officers. He kills them and steals their weapons. Nada enters a bank, where he sees that several of the employees and customers are aliens. He kills several aliens with a shotgun and escapes by taking Cable&nbsp;54 employee Holly Thompson hostage. At Holly's home, Nada tries to get her to try on the glasses, but she knocks him out of the window and down a hill and calls the police.\n\nThe next day, Nada returns to the alleyway and retrieves the sunglasses from a garbage truck before Frank meets Nada to give him his paycheck. Nada tries to get Frank to put on the glasses, but Frank thinks Nada is a murderer and wants nothing to do with him. Frank and Nada get into a long and violent brawl, after which Frank is too tired to prevent Nada from putting the sunglasses on him. After seeing the aliens and a flying saucer, Frank goes into hiding with Nada.\n\nFrank and Nada run into Gilbert, who leads them to a meeting of the anti-alien movement. At the meeting, they are given contact lenses to replace the sunglasses, and learn that the aliens are using [[global warming]] to make Earth more like their own planet, and are depleting the Earth's resources for their own gain. They also learn that the aliens have been bribing humans to become collaborators, promoting them to positions of power. Holly arrives at the meeting, apologizing to Nada. The meeting is raided by police and the vast majority of those present are killed, with the survivors (including Frank, Nada, and Holly) scattering. Nada and Frank are cornered in an alley, but they accidentally activate an alien wristwatch, opening a portal through which they escape.\n\nThe portal takes them to the aliens' spaceport, where they discover a meeting of aliens and human collaborators celebrating the elimination of the \"terrorists\". They are approached by a former drifter they briefly met in the shantytown, now a collaborator, who gives them a tour of the facility. He leads them to the basement of Cable&nbsp;54, the source of the signal, which is protected by armed guards. Nada and Frank find Holly and fight their way to the transmitter on the roof, but Holly kills Frank, revealing that she too is a human collaborator. Nada kills Holly and destroys the transmitter, and is fatally wounded by aliens in a helicopter. Nada gives the aliens [[the finger|the middle finger]] as he dies.\n\nWith the transmitter destroyed, humans all over the world are free from their dream-like state and discover the aliens hiding amongst them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roddy Piper]] as Nada<!---do NOT change this to \"John Nada\"--->\n* [[Keith David]] as Frank Armitage\n* [[Meg Foster]] as Holly Thompson\n* [[Raymond St. Jacques]] as Street Preacher\n* [[George Buck Flower]] as Drifter / Collaborator\n* [[Peter Jason]] as Gilbert\n* [[Sy Richardson]] as Black Revolutionary\n* [[Susan Blanchard (actress)|Susan Blanchard]] as Ingenue\n* [[Norman Alden]] as Construction Foreman\n* [[Kerry Rossall]] as 2nd Unit Guard\n\n==Themes==\nCarpenter has said that the film's political commentary derives from his dissatisfaction with the [[Reaganomics|economic policies]] of then-U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], and increasing commercialization in both the popular culture and politics of the era.<ref name=\"clark\">{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Noelene|date=May 11, 2013 |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/john-carpenter-they-live-was-about-giving-the-finger-to-reagan/#/0|title=John Carpenter: 'They Live' was about 'giving the finger to Reagan' |work=Hero Complex |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-date=September 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918224930/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/john-carpenter-they-live-was-about-giving-the-finger-to-reagan/#/0 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Upon the film's release, he remarked \"The picture's premise is that the '[[Reagan Revolution]]' is run by aliens from another galaxy. Free enterprisers from outer space have taken over the world, and are exploiting Earth as if it's a [[third world]] planet. As soon as they exhaust all our resources, they'll move on to another world... I began watching TV again. I quickly realized that everything we see is designed to sell us something. ...&nbsp;It's all about wanting us to buy something. The only thing they want to do is take our money.\" To this end, Carpenter thought of sunglasses as being the tool to seeing the truth, which \"is seen in black and white. It's as if the aliens have colorized us. That means, of course, that [[Ted Turner]] is really a monster from outer space.\"{{efn|Turner had received some bad press in the 1980s for [[Film colorization|colorizing classic black-and-white movies]].}} The director commented on the alien threat in an interview: \"They want to own all our businesses. A [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] executive asked me, 'Where's the threat in that? We all sell out every day.' I ended up using that line in the film.\" The aliens were deliberately made to look like ghouls, according to Carpenter, who said \"The creatures are corrupting us, so they, themselves, are corruptions of human beings.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/>\n\nSome [[neo-Nazi]] and [[white supremacist]] groups have described the film as \"an allegory for [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|Jewish control of the world]]\", an interpretation which Carpenter has strongly condemned, calling it \"slander and a lie\" and firmly stating that the film \"is about [[yuppie]]s and [[unrestrained capitalism]]\".<ref>{{cite tweet|author=John Carpenter |user=TheHorrorMaster |number=816486706186596352 |date=January 3, 2017 |title=THEY LIVE is about yuppies and unrestrained capitalism.

When he awakens, he realizes that the entire human race has been hypnotized, and that alien creatures are controlling humanity. He has only until eight o'clock in the morning to solve the problem.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> Carpenter acquired the film rights to both the comic book and short story and wrote the screenplay, using Nelson's story as a basis for the film's structure.\n\nBecause the screenplay was the product of so many sources\u2014a short story, a comic book, and input from cast and crew\u2014Carpenter decided to use the pseudonym \"Frank Armitage\", an allusion to one of the filmmaker's favorite writers, [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (Henry Armitage is a character in Lovecraft's ''[[The Dunwich Horror]]'').<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> Carpenter has always felt a close kinship with Lovecraft's worldview, and according to the director \"Lovecraft wrote about the hidden world, the 'world underneath'. His stories were about gods who are repressed, who were once on Earth and are now coming back. The world underneath has a great deal to do with ''They Live''.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nFor the crucial role of Nada, the filmmaker cast professional wrestler [[Roddy Piper]], whom he had met at [[WrestleMania III]] earlier in 1987. For Carpenter, it was an easy choice: \"Unlike most Hollywood actors, Roddy has life written all over him.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> Carpenter was impressed with [[Keith David]]'s performance in ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' and needed someone \"who wouldn't be a traditional sidekick but could hold his own.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> To this end, Carpenter wrote the role of Frank specifically for Keith David.\n\n===Filming===\n''They Live'' was shot in eight weeks during March and April 1988, principally [[Location shooting|on location]] in downtown Los Angeles, with a budget only slightly greater than $3&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> One of the highlights of the film is a five-and-a-half-minute alley [[Stage combat|fight]] between Nada and Frank over a pair of the special sunglasses.
