It is based on ''The Undersea Warship: A Fantastic Tale of Island Adventure'' by [[Shunr\u014d Oshikawa]]  and ''The Undersea Kingdom'' by Shigeru Komatsuzaki. The film is directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]], with special effects by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] and stars [[Jun Tazaki]], [[Tadao Takashima]], Y\u014dko Fujiyama, [[Y\u016b Fujiki]], and [[Ken Uehara]].\n\nThe film was released in Japan on December 22, 1963, and in the United States in 1965 via [[American International Pictures]]. A two-episode [[anime]] OVA titled ''Super Atragon'', based on the same novels, was produced by Phoenix Entertainment in 1995.\n\n==Plot==\nThe legendary empire of the lost continent of [[Mu (mythical lost continent)|Mu]] reappears to threaten the world with domination. While countries unite to resist, an isolated [[World War II]] captain has created the greatest [[warship]] ever seen, and possibly the surface world's only defense.\n\nWhile on a magazine photo shoot one night, photographers Susumu and Yoshito witness a car drive into the ocean. While speaking with a detective the next day they spot Makoto Jinguji, daughter of deceased Imperial Captain Jinguji, who is also being followed by a suspicious character. Her father's former superior, retired [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] Kusumi is confronted by a peculiar reporter, who claims contrarily that Captain Jinguji is alive and at work on a new submarine project. The threads meet when a mysterious taxi driver attempts to abduct Makoto and the Admiral, claiming to be an agent of the drowned Mu Empire. Foiled by the pursuing photographers, he flees into the ocean.\n\nDuring another visit to the detective, a package inscribed \"MU\" arrives for the Admiral. Contained within is a film depicting the thriving undersea continent (with its own [[geothermal power|geothermal]] \"sun\") and demanding that the surface world capitulate, and prevent Jinguji from completing his Atragon submarine, named ''Gotengo''. The [[United Nations|UN]] realizes that the Atragon may be the world's only defense and requests that Admiral Kosumi appeal to Jinguji. Concurrently, Makoto's stalker is arrested and discovered to be a naval officer under Jinguji. He agrees to lead the party to Jinguji's base but refuses to disclose its location. After several days of travel, the party find themselves on a tropical island inhabited only by Jinguji's forces and enclosing a vast underground dock.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Atragon rising.jpg|275px|left|thumb|''Atragon'' takes flight during its test run.]] -->\nEventually Captain Jinguji greets the visitors, though he is cold toward his daughter and infuriated by Kusumi's appeal. He built ''Gotengo'', he explains, as a means to restore the [[Empire of Japan]] after its defeat in World War II, and insists that it be used for no other purpose. Makoto runs off in anger, later to be consoled by Susumu. ''Gotengo'''s test run is a success, the heavily armored submarine even elevating out of the water and flying about the island. When the Captain approaches Makoto that evening they exchange harsh words; again Susumu reproaches the Captain for his selfish refusal to come to the world's aid. After Makoto and Susumu are kidnapped by the reporter, and the base crippled by a bomb, Jinguji consents to Kusumi's request and prepares ''Gotengo'' for war against Mu.\n\nThe Mu Empire executes a devastating attack on [[Tokyo]] and threatens to sacrifice its prisoners to the monstrous [[deity]] [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]] if the Atragon appears. The submarine appears, pursuing a Mu submarine to the Empire's entrance in the ocean depths. Meanwhile, Susumu and the other prisoners escape their cell and kidnap the [[Emperor|Empress]] of Mu. They are impeded by Manda, but soon rescued by ''Gotengo'', which then engages the serpent and freezes it using the \"[[absolute zero|Absolute Zero]] Cannon\". Jinguji offers to hear peace terms, but the proud Empress refuses. The Captain then advances ''Gotengo'' into the heart of the Empire power room and freezes its geothermal machinery before successfully escaping to the surface. This results in a cataclysmic explosion visible even to those on deck of the surfaced submarine. Her empire dying, the Mu Empress abandons the Atragon and, Jinguji and company looking on, swims into the conflagration.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jun Tazaki]] as Captain Hachiro Jinguji\n* [[Tadao Takashima]] as Susumu Hatanaka\n* Y\u014dko Fujiyama as Makoto Jinguji\n* [[Ken Uehara]] as Rear Admiral Kusumi\n* [[Y\u016b Fujiki]] as Yoshito Nishibe\n* [[Kenji Sahara]] as Umino\n* [[Hiroshi Koizumi]] as Detective Ito\n* [[Akihiko Hirata]] as Mu Agent #23\n* [[Hideyo Amamoto]] as High Priest of Mu\n* Tetsuko Kobayashi as Empress of Mu\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n''Atragon'' is loosely based on ''The Undersea Warship: A Fantastic Tale of Island Adventure'' (1899) by [[Shunr\u014d Oshikawa]] and ''The Undersea Kingdom'' (1954-1955) by [[Shigeru Komatsuzaki]].{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=201}} Komatsuzaki also served as an uncredited designer for the film, as he had with ''[[The Mysterians]]'' and ''[[Battle in Outer Space]]''.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=204}}\n\n[[Shinichi Sekizawa]] submitted his first draft on August 10, 1963, following revisions and storyboards by Komatsuzaki. \nSekizawa thought up the character of Jinguji after reading about the Brazilian-Japanese groups Machigumi and Kachigumi, one of which felt that Japan should have won World War II. He saw this as pointless fanaticism and wanted to embody this in the admiral whose nationalism blinds him.\n\nInstead of a dragon, [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]] was envisioned as a giant rattlesnake. There is some debate as to whether Manda was always in the script (a snake monster doesn\u2019t appear in the Undersea Kingdom) or whether the beast was added at Tomoyuki Tanaka\u2019s insistence like he did with Maguma in ''[[Gorath]]'' (1962). Manda\u2019s design was changed to resemble a Chinese dragon due to 1964 being the Year of the Dragon, and this was Toho\u2019s New Year\u2019s blockbuster.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=203}}\n\nMany of the film\u2019s most memorable elements weren\u2019t added until the final draft, which was finished by September 1963. This includes the Mu attack launched from Mt. Fuji, the earthquake assault on Marunochi in [[Tokyo]], and the Gotengo\u2019s zero cannon. Sekizawa also hoped that Captain Jinguji would be played by [[Toshiro Mifune]], though he know his hopes were in vain as Mifune was too expensive and tended to decline offers for giant monster films.\n\nSekizawa originally wrote a scene in a late draft of the script where Jinguji learned of his daughter's kidnapping and was prepared to sacrifice her in order to save the world, which triggered an argument between Jinguji and Kosumi. This was cut by director Ishiro Honda because he saw the story as a parable of global problems rather than personal problems. The film was originally scheduled to show the Mu Empire also attacking [[New York City]], but there wasn\u2019t enough time due to the rushed shooting schedule. Another elaborate deleted scene is expressed in the film's storyboards and occurs as the characters arrive on Jinguji\u2019s island. As they drive through the vast wasteland In the jeep, they are consumed by a black dust cloud. The jeep almost drives into a huge pit, with Makota saved by Susumu.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Shinichi Sekizawa]] originally wrote the character of Jinguji for\u00a0[[Toshiro Mifune]]. However, no one approached the actor prior and by the time casting was underway Mifune was already tied up in rehearsals for what would be a 18 month shoot for\u00a0''[[Red Beard]]''\u00a0(1965).\n\nIshiro Honda had no idea whom to cast as the Empress of Mu but met Tetsuko Kobayashi by chance, who was working on a TV show in Toho's lot. Honda found her to be \"hard working and very energetic.\" Kobayashi also applied the Empress' makeup herself.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=204}}\n\nOver 70,000,000 yen was spent on the construction of sets and props for the film. By Toho standards, this was a large sum although less than recent productions such as\u00a0''[[Gorath]]''\u00a0(1962).\n\nThe film's production schedule was shorter than usual, with production beginning September 5, 1963, targeted for a December release of that same year. This resulted in effects director [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] scaling back some effects. Honda originally wanted to show towns and residual areas for the Mu Empire but did not have enough money in the budget.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=204}}\n\nThe film became the 13th highest grossing domestic film of the year, grossing 175 million yen.\n\n===Special effects===\nFive models of the Gotengo were built for the film with steel hulls for supporting their internal mechanisms. All at various scales, the largest was 4.5 meters (15 feet long), manufactured by an actual ship-building company for the price of 1,500,000 yen. This version was fully operational with wings, fins, gun turrets, the bridge, and the drill all movable by remote radio control devices built into the hull. This model was large enough for a technician to lie inside the hull and manually operate some of the ships movable parts. Other models of the Gotengo were built to lengths of 3 meters (1/50) scale, 2 meters (1/75) scale, 1-meter (1/150) scale, and 30&nbsp;cm (1/500) scale. Altogether, two models of each of these scales were built except for the 30&nbsp;cm version, of which five were built. The 30&nbsp;cm model was used mainly in water tank shots to depict the Gotengo cruising on the surface of the sea. A small mechanical arm was attached to the ship beneath the water line, providing the ship mobility from outside the camera\u2019s vantage point.\n\nThe films highlight is the trial run of the Gotengo. Using an indoor water tank with a miniature shore line placed in front of a huge curved backdrop painting, the scene was shot in three different cuts, each of which used a different scale miniature sub. The initial scene showing the Gotengo surfacing was done by Eiji Tsuburaya without any composition. The five-meter model was used to express the illusion of mass as the ship rises. From the water tank. The model was attached to an underwater crane which forced the ship through to the surface of the pool. High-speed photography was employed with the camera cranking at 10 times normal speed. As the ship began to fly, a two-meter model, suspended by wires, was also filmed at high speed. Air jets located at the bottom of the model created the illusion of upward propulsion. The final cut of the scene utilized a one-meter model to depict the Gotengo slowly flying forward in a long shot.\n\nThe scene where the American submarine Red Satan is crushed by water pressure was done by pumping air out of the model.\n\nThe largest set for the film was inside Toho\u2019s Stage No. 11, then the largest on the back-lot. An elaborate backdrop measuring 30 feet high and 120 feet long was made for long shots of the Empress and her court overseeing the Mu ritual. The royal contingent, consisting mostly of the wives of American servicemen, was placed on a small platform with the pillars, balcony, and antechambers all painted in perspective on the backdrop. The chamber was filled with 600 male and female dancers were choreographed by Ishiro Honda to Akira Ifukube\u2019s Mu ritual music.\n\nThe destruction of the Tokyo business district required that the Ginza and Marunouchi areas be reproduced in miniature at 1/20 scale. The buildings were made of plaster, and only a handful were made with internal steel structures, so that the buildings would partially survive the destruction. When the model was completed, stagehands crawled under the platform and partially cut though the main supports. Ropes were then tied to each support beam, and all the ropes were attached to the bumper of a truck. Tsuburaya\u2019s vision of the scene was that the underground collapse would slowly ripple through the city, destroying it in a rolling wave. The destruction of the Ginza and Marunouchi districts did not go as planned. When time came for shooting, the technician who was driving the truck panicked and drove off too quickly, causing the entire model city to collapse at the same time. The staff all gasped, thinking the shot was ruined and that Tsuburaya would surly order the set rebuilt for another take. Tsuburaya stood silently for a while contemplating the situation, and finally he announced that he would take care of the matter in editing room.\n\nThe attack by the Mu submarine on Tokyo Bay was done in the huge 100-centimeter water tank located outdoors on the Toho backlot. Ten miniature tankers were constructed, each to a different scale, the maximum scale being 1/20 and the smallest 1/100. These ships were distributed in the water tank to create a forced perspective, adding greater depth to the scene than the confines of the tank would normally allow. Since the scene was shot with high-speed photography for more realism, a great amount of light was required for filming. Natural sunlight was sufficiently bright for filming only between 3:00PM and 4:00PM, so preparations were made from sunrise to ready the set for a tight afternoon shooting schedule. Six automatic remote-control cameras shot the scene simultaneously as six miniature ships exploded in sequence. Conventional animation was used to add the Mu subs ray to live action.\n\nThe aqualungs used by the Mu agents cost 70,000 yen each, with an additional charge of 100,000 yen to Toho for custom design of the suit. Altogether, 30 such aqualungs were built, and each was fully functional for underwater use.\n\nThe underwater sequences were achieved through camera filters and smoke machines.\n\nThe immense wall of smoke and flames which erupted from the explosion of the Mu power chamber was created using a small water tank against which a camera was secured upside down beneath the water line. A sky backdrop was placed behind the water, and colored paints were poured into the water, creating billowing, smoke-like clouds.\n\nThe mu submarines which were destroyed by the Gotengo\u2019s freeze cannon were 2&nbsp;cm models built to float upside down in the water tank. The ice flow in which the subs were trapped prior to their demise consisted of paraffin.\n\nThe scene where Shingugi\u2019s strike team uses freeze ray guns on attacking Mu soldiers was done using matte paintings.\n\nThe underwater sequences were achieved through camera filters and smoke machines.\n\n==Release==\n''Atragon'' was released in Japan on December 22, 1963. It became the 13th highest grossing domestic film of the year, grossing \u00a5175 million.{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2017|p=204}}\n\n''Atragon'' became a popular feature on TV and at [[film festival]]s. In fact, it was so popular that it was re-released in 1968 as the support feature for Honda's ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]''. It was also the 1964 Japanese entry at the Trieste Science Fiction Film Festival.<ref>Parish, James Robert and Michael R. Pitts. ''The Great Science Fiction  Pictures.''</ref>\n\n[[American International Pictures]] afforded the film a successful US theatrical release in 1965 with minimal changes and quality [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] by [[Titra Studios]].<ref name=\"Craig\">{{cite book|author=Craig, Rob|title=American International Pictures: A Comprehensive Filmography|date=2019|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=9781476666310|page=43}}</ref> The new name ''Atragon'', derived from Toho's international title ''Atoragon'', is presumably a [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of \"[[atom]]ic [[dragon]]\", a colorful moniker for the titular juggernaut; however, AIP's dubbed dialogue refers to the ''Goten-go'' by the name \"Atragon\". This shortening from four to three syllables was the choice of AIP, since several European markets released the film as ''Atoragon'' (Italy) and ''Ataragon'' (France). While ''Atragon'' became Toho's first ''tokusatsu eiga'' (visual effects film) released on home video in 1982, and though the film is exceptionally popular among western tokusatsu fans, ''Atragon'' was not released on [[home video]] in the United States until Media-Blasters' [[DVD]] in 2005 (although the film was in constant television syndication in the US until the early 1980s). Media Blasters had intended to use the original [[Titra Studios]] dubbing, but Toho forced the company to use its international version. This alternate dubbed version syncs up precisely with the Japanese video, but fans generally consider these international dubs to be inferior.\n\n==Other appearances==\n[[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]] later appeared in the 1968 ''[[Godzilla (series)|Godzilla]]'' film, ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]''.
