It is based on ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]'', a science-fiction short story (1958) and subsequent novel (1966) by [[Daniel Keyes]].\n\nThe film stars [[Cliff Robertson]] as Charly Gordon, an intellectually disabled adult who is selected by two doctors to undergo a surgical procedure that triples his IQ as it had done for a laboratory mouse who underwent the same procedure. The film also stars [[Claire Bloom]], [[Lilia Skala]], [[Leon Janney]], [[Dick Van Patten]] and [[Barney Martin]]. Robertson had played the same role in a 1961 television adaptation titled \"[[Flowers for Algernon#Adaptations|The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon]],\" an episode of the anthology series ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]''.\n\nThe film received positive reviews and was a success at the box office and later in home media sales. Robertson won [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] at the [[Academy Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nCharly Gordon is an [[intellectually disabled]] man who lives in Boston. He has a desire to learn and has attended night school for two years, taking a class taught by Alice Kinnian. He learns to read and write, though his spelling and penmanship are poor and he is unable to spell his own name. He works as a janitor at a bakery, where his coworkers amuse themselves by taking advantage of his disability, and enjoys playing with children at a playground. \n\nAlice takes Charly to researchers Dr. Richard Nemur and Dr. Anna Straus<!-- \"Straus\" is the spelling used in the film, and is different from the book -->, who have been investigating methods for increasing intelligence. Having successfully tested a surgical procedure on a lab mouse named Algernon, they are looking for a human test subject. They put Charly through a battery of aptitude tests and have him try to solve a series of paper mazes while Algernon runs through models of them. Charly consistently loses to Algernon, but is selected for the surgery. \n\nAfter surgery, Charly loses to Algernon again and is frustrated at not immediately becoming smarter. After some time passes, he finally beats Algernon and his intelligence begins to increase. His coworkers tell him to operate a complex machine, hoping that he will break it so they can have the day off, but he successfully operates it. Embarrassed and frightened by his new intelligence, they persuade the bakery owners to fire Charly. Alice continues teaching him, but his intelligence continues to increase and eventually surpasses hers. Lacking emotional maturity, Charly becomes infatuated with Alice and confesses his love for her, but she sharply rejects his advances. He flees in an act of rebellion but eventually returns to Boston, and the two start to consider marriage. \n\nNemur and Straus present their research at a convention. After playing the film of Charly's original aptitude tests, they bring him out for a question-and-answer session. His intelligence now equals or exceeds everyone in the audience, but he has also developed a cynical view of humanity that the attendees mistake for humor.  He reveals that Algernon has lost his enhanced intelligence and died, facts that the research team kept from him, and expects to undergo a similar decline. \n\nCharly overhears Alice, Nemur, and Straus discussing his situation and offers to assist in finding a way to preserve his intelligence, but their combined efforts prove fruitless. He falls into a depression and asks Alice never to visit him again. Some time later, Alice sees Charly playing with children on the playground, having fully regressed to his original level of intellectual disability.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Cliff Robertson]]&nbsp;\u2013 Charly Gordon\n* [[Claire Bloom]]&nbsp;\u2013 Alice Kinnian\n* [[Lilia Skala]]&nbsp;\u2013 Dr. Anna Straus\n* [[Leon Janney]]&nbsp;\u2013 Dr. Richard Nemur\n* [[Ruth White (actress)|Ruth White]]&nbsp;\u2013 Mrs. Apple\n* [[Dick Van Patten]]&nbsp;\u2013 Bert (as Richard Van Patten)\n* Edward McNally&nbsp;\u2013 Gimpy (as Skipper McNally)\n* [[Barney Martin]]&nbsp;\u2013 Hank\n* William Dwyer&nbsp;\u2013 Joey\n* Dan Morgan&nbsp;\u2013 Paddy\n\n=== Music by ===\n\n* [[Ravi Shankar]]\n\n== Production history ==\n===Development===\n[[File:Cliff Robertson Mona Freeman Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon 1961.JPG|thumb|180px|Photo from the 1961 television presentation \"[[Flowers for Algernon#Adaptations|The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon]]\", with [[Mona Freeman]] in the role of Alice]]\nThe short story ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]'' had been the basis of \"[[Flowers for Algernon#Adaptations|The Two Worlds of Charlie Gordon]]\", a 1961 television adaptation in which Robertson had also starred for ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]''.<ref>{{cite web| title= Charly (1968): Notes | url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/22803/Charly/notes.html | publisher= [[Turner Classic Movies]] | access-date=2011-03-25}}</ref> Robertson had starred in a number of television shows that were turned into films with other actors playing his roles, such as ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (1958 TV drama)|Days of Wine and Roses]]''.
