It stars [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Tessa Thompson]], [[Jermaine Fowler]], [[Omari Hardwick]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[David Cross]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Steven Yeun]], and [[Armie Hammer]]. The film follows a young [[African American|black]] telemarketer who adopts a [[acting white|white accent]] to succeed at his job. Swept into a corporate conspiracy, he must choose between profit and joining his activist friends to [[labor union|organize labor]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in June 2017 in Oakland, California. ''Sorry to Bother You'' premiered at the [[2018 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]] on January 20, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 6, 2018, by [[Annapurna Pictures]] through [[Mirror Releasing]]. The film received critical acclaim for its cast, concept, and soundtrack, as well as Riley's screenplay and direction.\n\n==Plot==\nCassius \"Cash\" Green lives in his uncle Sergio's garage with his girlfriend, Detroit, an artist. Struggling to pay rent, Cash gets a job as a telemarketer for RegalView. Cash has trouble with customers until Langston, an older co-worker, teaches him to use his \"[[Acting white|white voice]]\" and adopt a blithe, affluent persona on calls, at which Cash excels.\n\nCash's coworker Squeeze forms a [[Trade union|union]] and recruits Cash, Detroit, and their friend Sal. When Cash participates in a protest, he expects to be fired but is instead promoted to an elite Power Caller position. In the luxurious Power Caller suite, Cash is told by the lead Power Caller, Mr. _______, to always use his white voice, and learns that RegalView secretly sells military [[Armament|arms]] as well as cheap labor from the corporation WorryFree, through which employees sign lifetime contracts to work and be housed in factories, which many condemn as slave labor.\n\nThough Cash is initially uncomfortable with the job, he is celebrated at work, and can now afford a new apartment, a flashy new car, and pays off Sergio's house (in the process keeping him from joining WorryFree). He stops participating in the union push and Detroit quits her RegalView job to avoid conflicting loyalties between the two, while secretly participating in the Left Eye Faction, an anti-WorryFree activist movement. She breaks up with Cash, arguing that his immoral job has changed him, while he insists he has the right to be proud of his success. He later attends Detroit's art exhibit and [[Performance art|artistic performance]] uninvited, at which she uses a white voice of her own. When Cash is escorted through the union's [[Picketing|picket line]] one morning, a picketer wounds him with a can of soda. Footage of the incident becomes an [[Internet meme]]; the thrower profits off of it herself, even signing a sponsorship with the brand of the soda she threw.\n\nCash is invited to a party with WorryFree CEO Steve Lift, where he is goaded into rapping for the predominantly white guests. In a private meeting, Lift offers Cash a powdered substance which Cash snorts, believing it is [[cocaine]]. Looking for the bathroom, Cash discovers shackled half-horse, half-human hybrids who beg him for help. Lift explains that WorryFree plans to make their workers stronger, more obedient, and thus more profitable by transforming them into hybrid \"Equisapiens\" through snorting a gene-modifying powder. Cash fears that he just ingested the substance, but Lift assures him it was cocaine. Cash refuses an offer of $100 million to become an Equisapien for five years and act as a false revolutionary figure to keep the employees in line.\n\nCash discovers he dropped his phone when he encountered the Equisapiens, who recorded a plea for help and sent it to Detroit. Taking advantage of his infamy as a meme, Cash appears on the extremely popular television show ''I Got the Shit Kicked Out of Me'', enduring humiliations and beatings to share the video, and spreads the word about WorryFree's cruelty. The plan backfires: Equisapiens are hailed as a groundbreaking scientific advancement, a [[cult of personality]] worshipping Lift develops, and WorryFree's [[stock]] reaches an all-time high.\n\nCash apologizes to Squeeze, Sal, and Detroit, and rallies the union in a final stand against RegalView. He uses a security code from the Equisapien's video to break into Lift's home. He goes to the picket line, where the police start a riot and detain Cash, but the Equisapiens overpower them and free Cash. Detroit and Cash reconcile and later move back into Sergio's garage. Cash suddenly starts to grow horse nostrils. Later, fully transformed, he leads a mob of Equisapiens to Lift's house and breaks down the door.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Cassius \"Cash\" Green\n**[[David Cross]] as Cash's white voice\n* [[Tessa Thompson]] as Detroit, Cash's girlfriend\n** [[Lily James]] as Detroit's white voice\n* [[Jermaine Fowler]] as Salvador\n* [[Omari Hardwick]] as Mr. _______, the head Power Caller\n** [[Patton Oswalt]] as Mr. _______'s white voice\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Sergio Green, Cash's uncle\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Langston\n**Ryan Coursey as Langston's white voice (uncredited)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Plante |first1=Corey |title='Sorry to Bother You' Spoilers: The White Faces Behind the White Voices |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/46776-sorry-to-bother-you-white-voices-and-white-faces |access-date=July 30, 2021 |work=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |publisher=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle Digital Group]] |date=July 6, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Steven Yeun]] as \"Squeeze\", a union organizer\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Steve Lift, WorryFree CEO\n* [[Kate Berlant]] as Diana DeBauchery\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as First Equisapien / Demarius\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Voice in Power Caller Elevator\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Boots Riley 20160118-1099.jpg|thumb|Riley speaks at a [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] rally in [[Emeryville, California]], January 2016.]]\nBoots Riley describes the film as \"an absurdist dark comedy with aspects of [[magical realism]] and science fiction inspired by the world of telemarketing\".
