The film popularised the [[Drunken boxing|Zui Quan]] (\"drunken fist\") infused with unique animal fighting style. In 2017, it was ranked number 3 on [[GamesRadar]]'s list of 50 greatest kung fu movies of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 25 best kung fu movies you have to see|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=11 April 2017|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/50-best-kung-fu-movies/|access-date=2017-04-11}}</ref> It spawned an official sequel, ''[[Drunken Master II]]'' (1994), and several spin-offs. It had a significant cultural impact, inspiring numerous later films, music, [[manga]], [[anime]] and [[video games]].\n\n==Background==\nThe film's protagonist [[Wong Fei-hung]] was a Chinese martial artist, a [[traditional Chinese medicine]] practitioner and a revolutionary who lived towards the end of the [[Qing dynasty]]. He became a Chinese folk hero and the subject of several Hong Kong television programmes and films. [[Beggar So]], who plays a supporting role in the film, is also another character from Chinese folklore and one of the [[Ten Tigers of Canton]]. The Beggar So character is often cast as an associate of Wong Fei-hung or Wong's uncle.\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot centers on a young and mischievous [[Wong Fei-hung]] (sometimes dubbed as \"Freddie Wong\"). Wong runs into a series of troubles. Firstly, he teaches an overbearing assistant martial arts teacher a lesson. Next, he makes advances on a woman to impress his friends, and is soundly thrashed by her older female guardian as a result; his shame is compounded when these two are later revealed to be his visiting aunt and cousin, whom he had not met before. Lastly, he beats up a hooligan who turns out to be the son of an influential man in town. His father decides to punish him for his behavior by making him train harder in martial arts.\n\nWong's father arranges for [[Beggar So]] to train his son in martial arts. Beggar So has a reputation for crippling his students during training so Wong flees from home in an attempt to escape his punishment. Penniless, he stops at a restaurant and tries to con a fellow patron into offering him a free meal. As he was about to leave after his meal, he discovers that the man is actually the owner of the restaurant. He fights with the owner's lackeys in an attempt to escape. An old drunkard nearby is drawn into the fight and helps him escape. The drunkard turns out to be Beggar So, the Drunken Master. (Beggar So is known in some versions of the film as Sam Seed, So Hi or Su Hua-chi)\n\nBeggar So forces Wong into his brutal and rigorous training programme. Wong flees again to avoid the torturous training and runs into the notorious killer Yim Tit-sam (known in some versions as Thunderfoot or Thunderleg) by accident. Yim is known for his \"Devil's Kick\", a swift and deadly kicking style which has never been defeated. Wong provokes and challenges him to a fight and is soundly defeated and humiliated. He makes his way back to Beggar So and decides to commit himself to the Drunken Master's training program.\n\nThe training resumes and soon Wong learns Beggar So's secret style of martial arts, a form of Drunken Boxing called \"[[Eight Immortals|The Eight Drunken Immortals]]\", named after the eight [[Xian (Taoism)|xian]] that the fighting style references. Wong masters seven of the eight styles with the exception of [[Immortal Woman He|Drunken Miss Ho]]'s as he feels that her style of fighting is too feminine.\n\nMeanwhile, Yim Tit-sam is contracted by a business rival to kill Wong's father. Wong's father fights with Yim and is defeated and injured by him. Wong and Beggar So arrive on the scene on time and Wong continues the fight with Yim. Beggar So promises not to interfere in the fight. Wong employs the new skills he has learned and outmatches Yim's kicking style. Yim then resorts to his secret technique, the Devil's Shadowless Hand, which is too fast for Wong to defeat. Wong confesses that he did not master the last style so Beggar So tells him to combine the seven styles and create his own version of the last style. Wong follows the instruction and discovers his own unique style of Drunken Miss Ho, which he uses to overcome the Shadowless Hand and finally defeat Yim.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jackie Chan]] as [[Wong Fei-hung]] / Freddy Wong (UK version)\n*[[Yuen Siu-tien|Yuen Siu-Tin]] (or Simon Yuen) as [[Beggar So]] / Sam Seed \n*[[Hwang Jang-lee]] as Thunderleg Yen Tie Hsin / Thunderfoot\n*[[Dean Shek]] as Professor Kai-Hsin\n*Lam Kau as [[Wong Kei-ying|Wong Kei-Ying]] / Robert Wong (UK version)\n*Fung King-man as Mr. Lee Man-ho\n*Hsu Hsia as King of Bamboo Hsu Ching-tien\n*Linda Lin as Wong Fei-hung's aunt\n*Yuen Shun-yi as Chan Kwok-wai / Charlie Wei\n*Tong Jing as Wong Fei-hung's cousin\n*Tino Wong as Jerry Lee\n*[[Yuen Woo-ping|Yuen Woo-Ping]] as Man with bucket of greens\n\n==Fight scenes and martial arts==\nA number of notable fights are featured in the film, almost all of them with strong elements of comedy\u2014from the game of [[Keep Away]] with [[Wong Kei-ying]]'s cocky, but incompetent, assistant kung fu instructor, to the novel \"head-fu\" fighting style used by one of his opponents. The film features the [[Hung Ga]] system of fighting, which was historically practiced by [[Wong Fei-hung]] and his father Wong Kei-ying, both of whom are major characters in the film. The animal styles of Snake, Crane, and Tiger performed in the film are derived wholly from the Hung Ga system and bear only a tangential relationship to the [[Fujian White Crane]], Lama Pai (Tibetan White Crane), [[Black Tiger Kung Fu|Black Tiger]], and [[Snake Kung Fu|Snake]] systems of kung fu. [[Monkey Kung Fu|Monkey]] style kung fu, popular in Southern Chinese martial arts performances, is also shown briefly.\n\nNumerous systems of kung fu include \"Drunken Boxing\" forms (e.g. [[Cai li fo|Choi Lei Fut]] and [[Drunken Monkey]]), and the [[Eight Immortals|Taoist Eight Immortals]] are popular staples of Chinese culture and art. However, the \"Eight Drunken Immortals\" forms depicted in this film are likely the creation of director and choreographer [[Yuen Woo-ping]] and based on routines found in other systems.\n\nThe primary villain in ''Drunken Master'' is played by Hwang Jang-lee, a Korean martial artist specialising in [[Taekwondo]] and known for his high-flying kicks, which are prominently displayed in the film. The systems of \"Devil's Kick\" and \"Devil's Shadowless Hands\" employed by Thunderleg are entirely fictitious.\n\nAccording to his book ''I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action'', Chan nearly lost an eye after his brow ridge was injured.<ref name=\"I Am Jackie Chan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html|title=Jackie's Aches and Pains: It Only Hurts When I'm Not Laughing|author=Jackie Chan|author-link=Jackie Chan|publisher=[[Random House]]|access-date=2012-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q98IAAAACAAJ|title=I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action|last=Chan|first=Jackie|date=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=9780613217385}}</ref>\n\n==Theme song==\nThe theme song of ''Drunken Master'' is based on a Chinese folk song, \"Under the General's Orders\". Since ''Drunken Master'', the theme song has been popularly associated with the folk hero [[Wong Fei-hung]], who Jackie Chan plays in the film. It was later used in the 1983 film ''[[Winners and Sinners]]'', starring [[Sammo Hung]]; it was played in a market scene whilst the [[Five Lucky Stars]] are watching two men demonstrating the beneficial effects of their medicines and their martial arts stances, in reference to Wong Fei-hung. \"Under the General's Orders\" later become the main theme song for the ''[[Once Upon a Time in China (film series)|Once Upon a Time in China]]'' series starring [[Jet Li]], who also plays Wong Fei-hung.\n\n==Box office==\nAt the Hong Kong box office, ''Drunken Master'' earned an impressive {{HK$}}6,763,793<ref name=\"DMatHKMDb\"/> ({{US$|{{#expr:6763793/4.68 round 0}}|link=yes}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1978&locations=HK&start=1977 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1978 |access-date=21 November 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref> It was the second most popular film in Hong Kong in 1978 behind the [[Michael Hui|Hui]] brothers' ''[[The Contract (1978 film)|The Contract]]'' and third on the all-time list.<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 23, 1995|page=56|title=More than 'the next Bruce Lee'|url=https://variety.com/1995/scene/markets-festivals/more-than-the-next-bruce-lee-99125161/}}</ref><ref name=gross>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 3, 1979|page=42|title=Hong Kong's 20 Alltime Top Pix}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Japan]], where it released on 21 July 1979, it became one of the year's top ten [[List of highest-grossing films in Japan|highest-grossing films]], earning {{JPY|1.9 billion|link=yes}}<ref>{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c12\u56de\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |url=http://kungfutube.info/3672 |website=KungFu Tube |access-date=21 November 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:1900/219.14 round 1}} million}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) - Japan |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1979&locations=JP&start=1978 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1979 |access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref> In [[South Korea]], it was the highest-grossing film of 1979, with 898,561 box admissions in [[Seoul City]],<ref name=\"korea2\">{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c10\u56de\uff1a\u97d3\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |url=http://kungfutube.info/3156 |website=KungFu Tube |date=5 September 2010 |access-date=7 December 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> equivalent to an estimated {{Currency|{{#expr:898561*1500 round -3}}|KRW}}<ref>{{cite journal |title=Asian Culture Quarterly |journal=Asian Culture Quarterly |date=1983 |volume=11-12 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLdBAAAAYAAJ |publisher=Asian Cultural Center. |quote=The average admission fee in 1979 was 1,000 won for national films and 1,500 won for imports.

Chan portrays the same character, Wong Fei-hung. The US release of the film in 2000 was entitled ''The Legend of Drunken Master''.\n*In 1979, [[Yuen Siu-tien|Yuen Siu-Tin]] reprised the role of Beggar So in the film ''[[Dance of the Drunk Mantis]]'', which is entitled ''Drunken Master Part 2'' (not to be confused with [[Drunken Master II]] noted above) in some releases. The film, which was again directed by his son, [[Yuen Woo-ping|Yuen Woo-Ping]], does not feature Jackie Chan, focusing instead on the drunken beggar character rather than on [[Wong Fei-hung]]. It is therefore generally considered to be a spinoff rather than a true sequel.\n*Yuen played this same role again in the films ''Story of Drunken Master'' and ''World of the Drunken Master''.\n*In 2010 Yuen Woo-ping returned to directing with ''[[True Legend]]'', which could be called a prequel to ''Drunken Master'' as it explains why Beggar Su (played by [[Vincent Zhao]]) turns to drinking.\n\n==Imitators==\n<!-- [[Johnny Chan (actor)]] redirects here --> \nAs with several successful Hong Kong action films, a number of films were released in the wake of ''Drunken Master'' (and its sequel) that could be considered to trade on the fame of the original films. These had less in common with the original films than the spinoffs starring Yuen Siu-tien.\nThey include:\n*''[[5 Superfighters]]'' (aka ''The Drunken Fighter'') (1978)\n*''Drunken Swordsman'' (aka ''Drunken Dragon Strikes Back'') (1979)\n*''Drunken Arts and Crippled Fist'' (Featuring Li Yi Min) (1979)\n*''Drunken Master, Slippery Snake'' (Starring [[Cliff Lok]]) (1979)\n*''Shaolin Drunken Monkey'' (Starring [[Elton Chong]]) (1981)\n*''[[The Shaolin Drunken Monk]]'' (starring [[Gordon Liu]]) (1982)\n*''[[Drunken Tai Chi]]'' (directed by Yuen Woo-ping and starring [[Donnie Yen]]) (1984)\n*''Revenge of the Drunken Master'' (1984), starring Johnny Chan,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2093206/|title= Johnny Chan (I) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref> whose name allowed him to trade off his more successful namesake in other low-budget martial arts films including ''Golden Dragon, Silver Snake'' (1979) and ''The Eagles Killer'' (1978)\n*''[[Drunken Master III]]'' (aka ''Drunken Master Killer'') \u2013 starring [[Andy Lau]] (1994)\n*''The Little Drunken Masters'' (1995)\n\nNot all films that feature the Zui Quan \"Drunken Fist\" style (or variations on it) can be considered as imitators of the ''Drunken Master'' films. Films such as ''[[Drunken Monkey (2002 film)|Drunken Monkey]]'' (2002) may feature a drunken style of kung fu, and in the case of ''[[The Forbidden Kingdom]]'' (2008), the same principal star, but they have a fundamentally different plot and sufficiently different title to separate them from ''Drunken Master''.\n\n==Home media==\n*On 24 April 2000, [[Hong Kong Legends]] released a DVD in the [[United Kingdom]]. The image is cropped from 2:35:1 to 1:78:1 and has the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] soundtrack with [[dubtitle]]s. However, it has a number of additional features including a deleted scene and an interview with producer [[Ng See-yuen]].\n*On 2 April 2002, [[Columbia Pictures]] released a DVD in the [[United States]]. Despite a 2:35:1 image and the inclusion of the original Cantonese track, the audio is incomplete in some sections (reverting to the English dub) and contains [[dubtitle]]s. There's an audio commentary by [[Ric Meyers]] and [[Jeff Yang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3564/drunken-master/ |title=Drunken Master : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |website=Dvdtalk.com |access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n*On 18 March 2004, HKVideo released a \"Wong Fei Hung\" DVD boxset in [[France]] containing this film (French title: \"Le ma\u00eetre chinois\") and two others. It contains a full 2:35:1 image and the Cantonese soundtrack. However, it contains slightly poorer image quality and no English subtitles.\n*On 30 April 2004, [[Mei Ah Entertainment]] released a remastered DVD in [[Hong Kong]] (pictured right). It contains a 2:35:1 image, Cantonese Dolby Digital 5.1 track, original Cantonese Dolby Digital 2.0 mono track and Mandarin Dolby Digital 2.0 mono track. Subtitles include Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and English. The missing Cantonese for the opening has been re-dubbed in Cantonese and the other missing Cantonese scenes as extended footage in Mandarin due to trouble of re-dubbing with new voice actors. Many short lines missing Cantonese had been removed. Special features include Extended footage, accessed during the film by selecting the wine jug icon when it appears on the right top corner, Mastering the Drunken Master, a 35-second music video with clips of Jackie Chan practicing the 8 Drunken Gods from the film, film synopsis and cast & crew.\n*PanMedia released a [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] DVD that contains the complete Cantonese track.\n\n==Cultural impact==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Fashion===\n*During the late 1970s to early 1980s, Jackie Chan's shoulder-length hairstyle in ''Drunken Master'' became popular across Asia, widely adopted by both men and women across the region.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jackie Chan Headed For Bruce Lee-Type Stardom With New Film |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/indiana-gazette-oct-09-1980-p-17/ |access-date=8 April 2022 |work=[[Indiana Gazette]] |via=[[NewspaperArchive]] |date=9 October 1980 |url-access=subscription |quote=The 1978 \"Drunk Monkey in a Tiger's Eye\" made him an instant star.
