The film stars [[Tim Robbins]], [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]], and [[Danny Aiello]]. In the film, Jacob Singer's experiences before and during his service [[Vietnam War|in Vietnam]] result in strange, fragmentary visions and bizarre hallucinations that continue to haunt him. As his ordeal worsens, Jacob desperately attempts to figure out the truth.\n\n''Jacob's Ladder'' was made by [[Carolco Pictures]] ten years after being written by Rubin. Though only moderately successful upon release, the film garnered a [[Cult film|cult following]] and its plot and special effects became a source of influence for various other works such as the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' video game series. A remake, also titled ''[[Jacob's Ladder (2019 film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'', was released in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. -->\nOn October 6, 1971, an American [[infantryman]], Jacob Singer, is with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Air Cavalry Division]], deployed in a village in Vietnam's [[Mekong Delta]], when his close-knit unit comes under sudden attack. As many of Jacob's comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior with some suffering [[catatonia]], convulsions, and seizures. Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be stabbed with a [[bayonet]] by an unseen assailant.\n\nJacob awakens in the [[New York City Subway]], where, after glimpsing what he believes to be a tentacle protruding from a sleeping homeless person, an inexplicably locked subway station exit results in him almost being hit by a train. The year is 1975, he works as a postal clerk, and lives in a rundown apartment in [[Brooklyn]] with his girlfriend, Jezebel. Jacob misses his old family and experiences visions of them, especially the youngest of his sons, Gabe, who had died in an accident before the war. Jacob is increasingly beset by disturbing experiences and apparitions, including glimpses of faceless vibrating figures, and narrowly escapes being run over by a pursuing car. He attempts to contact his regular doctor at the local [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] hospital, but after first being told that there is no record of him ever being a patient there, Jacob is told that his doctor has died in a car explosion.\n\nAt a party thrown by friends, a [[psychic]] reads Jacob's palm and tells him that he is already dead, which Jacob dismisses as a joke. After declining to dance with her, he appears to witness an enormous creature penetrating Jezzie before he collapses. At home, Jacob experiences a dangerous [[fever]], which Jezzie attempts to bring down with a painful ice bath. Jacob briefly wakes up in another reality where he lives with his wife and sons, including a still-alive Gabe. First-person perspective scenes of apparent [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] to his time in Vietnam show Jacob, badly wounded, being discovered by American soldiers before being evacuated under fire in a helicopter.\n\nOne of Jacob's former platoon mates, Paul, contacts him to reveal he is suffering from similar experiences, but is soon afterwards killed when his car explodes. Commiserating after the funeral, other surviving members of the platoon confess that they have all been experiencing horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, they hire a lawyer to investigate. However the lawyer quits the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob's comrades soon back down while Jacob suspects they have been threatened into doing so. He is abducted by suited men who try to intimidate him. Jacob fights them and escapes but is injured and nearly paralyzed in the process. He is taken to a nightmarish hospital, where he is told he has been killed and this is home, but his [[chiropractor]] friend Louis comes to his rescue and heals him. Louis quotes the 14th-century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] [[Meister Eckhart]]:\n\n<blockquote>Eckhart saw [[Hell]] too. He said: \"The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you\", he said. \"They're freeing your soul. So, if you're frightened of dying and ... you're holding on, you'll see [[devil]]s tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace, then the devils are really [[angel]]s, freeing you from the earth.\"</blockquote>\n\nJacob is approached by a distressed man who had been following him from a distance and who also dragged him away from Paul's burning car. Introducing himself as Michael Newman, he tells a story of having been a chemist with [[Chemical Corps|the Army's chemical warfare division]] where he designed a drug he called the Ladder, which massively increased aggression. Michael claims that, to test the drug's effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob's unit before the battle, causing some of them to turn on each other in a homicidal frenzy. Michael's story triggers a vision of Jacob's wounding in Vietnam, which shows his attacker as a fellow American soldier. Jacob returns to his family's home, where he finds Gabe, who takes him by the hand and leads him up the staircase into a bright light. The scene turns to a [[triage]] tent in 1971 as military doctors declare Jacob dead. The doctor notes that Jacob had put up a tremendous fight to stay alive, but looked peaceful in death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Jacob \"Professor\" Singer\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Jezebel \"Jezzie\" Pipkin\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Louis \"Louie\" Denardo\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Michael Newman\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Paul Gruneger\n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Mr. Geary\n* [[Patricia Kalember]] as Sarah Singer\n* [[Eriq La Salle]] as Frank\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as George\n* [[Brian Tarantina]] as Doug\n* Anthony Alessandro as Rod\n* Brent Hinkley as Jerry\n* [[S.

For several years, Rubin tried to sell the script, without success; [[Thom Mount]] of [[Universal Pictures]] said he \"loved it, but it was not for his studio\". Directors [[Michael Apted]], [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[Ridley Scott]] all expressed an interest in making the film, but still no major studio was ready to invest in Rubin's \"too [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]\" stories as \"Hollywood does not make [[List of ghost films|ghost movies]]\". Eventually, after ''Deadly Friend'' was filmed by [[Wes Craven]] in 1986, Rubin's screenplays for both ''Jacob's Ladder'' and ''Ghost'' were picked by [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=\"st\" /> In 1988,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> [[Adrian Lyne]], who described Rubin's work as \"certainly one of the best scripts I've ever read\", decided then to direct it instead of an adaptation of ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' as he had originally planned (incidentally, [[Tom Hanks]], an actor originally considered by Lyne for the role of Jacob, ended up starring in ''Bonfire''). The ownership and policy changes at Paramount resulted in the cancellation of the project; the executives had doubts about the film's ending and the scenes taking place in Vietnam. The [[independent film]] studio [[Carolco Pictures]] decided to take over the production of ''Jacob's Ladder'', giving Lyne a greater creative control<ref name=\"st\" /> and a budget of $25 million.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Rubin became the film's co-producer, along with [[Mario Kassar]], [[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]] and [[Andrew G.

A particularly strong inspiration for both Rubin and Lyne was [[Robert Enrico]]'s 1962 short film ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]'',<ref name=\"rubin\">Bruce Joel Rubin, ''Jacob's Ladder'', Applause Theatre & Cinema Books, 1990.</ref> one of Lyne's favorite movies,<ref name=\"st\" /> which was in turn based on [[Ambrose Bierce]]'s 1890 short story [[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge|of the same title]].\n\nCast in the role of Jacob, [[Tim Robbins]] said the film presented for him \"a great opportunity to go in a different direction.

The war scenes were filmed in the [[Puerto Rico]] area of [[Vega Baja]], featuring the [[UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] helicopters provided by the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nAll of the film's special effect sequences were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of ''Jacob's Ladder'', Lyne used a [[body horror]] technique in which an actor is recorded shaking his head around at a low [[frame rate]], resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he was inspired by the art of the painter [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] when developing the effect.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.widerscreenings.com/jacobsladder.html |title=Jacob's Ladder |publisher=Widerscreenings.com |access-date=June 18, 2012 |archive-date=August 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823224053/http://www.widerscreenings.com/jacobsladder.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to [[thalidomide]] deformities to achieve a greater shock effect.<ref name=\"rubin\" /> After many heated arguments,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist [[H. R. Giger]] and the photographers [[Diane Arbus]] and [[Joel-Peter Witkin]] for inspiration; another influence came from the [[Brothers Quay]]'s 1986 [[stop motion]] short film ''[[Street of Crocodiles]]''.\n\n{{quote box|quote=Vietnam was really a means to an end. It was a plot device rather than something we were trying to make a huge issue of.|source=\u2013[[Alan Marshall (producer)|Alan Marshall]]<ref name=nyt/>|width=30%}}\n\nIn the film, Jacob is told by Michael that the horrific events he experienced on his final day in Vietnam were the product of an experimental drug called \"the Ladder\", which was used on troops without their knowledge. At the end of the film, a message is displayed saying that reports of testing of BZ, [[NATO]] code for a [[deliriant]] and [[hallucinogen]] known as [[3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate|3-quinuclidinyl benzilate]], on U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War were denied by the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]]. Lyne said a part of the inspiration for this motif was [[Martin A. Lee]]'s book ''[[Acid Dreams: The CIA, LSD and Sixties Rebellion]]'', but noted that \"nothing in the book suggests that the drug BZ \u2014 a super-hallucinogen that has a tendency to elicit [[Mania|maniac behavior]] \u2014 was used on U.S. troops.\"<ref name=\"st\" />\n\nAccording to Lyne's audio commentary, [[test screening]]s indicated that the initial version of the film was overwhelming for the audience.
