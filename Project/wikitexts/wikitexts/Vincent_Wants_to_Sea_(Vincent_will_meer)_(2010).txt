With his roommate Alexander, who has [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], and his [[anorexic]] new friend Marie, he steals a car belonging to one of the psychiatrists to go to Italy to fulfill his mother's last wish: to have her ashes dumped into the Mediterranean Sea in the place where she and Vincent's father went on their honeymoon. Dr. Rose, the owner of the stolen car, goes with Vincent's father to find and retrieve them. Over the course of the trip, Vincent and Marie develop a relationship and Vincent's father realizes how badly he's been treating his son.\n\nWhen Vincent, Alexander, and Marie arrive at the sea, Marie promptly collapses from heart failure caused by her anorexia. Vincent and Alexander conclude that the trip was a suicide attempt on her part - she was the one who originally stole the car and had the idea of leaving. Dr. Rose and Vincent's father take Alexander and Vincent home while Marie remains hospitalized. On the way back, Vincent decides to return his mother's ashes to his father and goes back to the city where Marie is in the hospital; Alexander accompanies him.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Florian David Fitz]] as Vincent\n* [[Karoline Herfurth]] as Marie\n* [[Heino Ferch]] as Robert\n* [[Katharina M\u00fcller-Elmau]] as Dr. Rose\n* {{Interlanguage link|Johannes Allmayer|de}} as Alexander\n* {{Interlanguage link|Karin Thaler|de}} as Monika\n* [[Tim Seyfi]] as Carabinieri\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|1611211}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{German Film Award for Best Film}}\n\n[[Category:2010 drama films]]\n[[Category:2010 films]]\n[[Category:German drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about Tourette syndrome]]\n[[Category:Films about obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]\n[[Category:Films about eating disorders]]\n[[Category:2010s German-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s German films]]\n\n{{2010s-Germany-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
