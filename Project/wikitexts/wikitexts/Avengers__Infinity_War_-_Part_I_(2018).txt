The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015, and a month later Markus and McFeely signed on to write the script for the film, which draws inspiration from [[Jim Starlin]]'s 1991 comic book ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet]]'' and [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s 2013 comic book ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]''. In 2016, Marvel shortened the title to ''Avengers: Infinity War''.

Thanos and his lieutenants leave, destroying the ship.\n\nHulk crash-lands in the [[New York Sanctum|Sanctum Sanctorum]] in New York City, reverting to the form of Bruce Banner. He warns [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] and [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] about Thanos' plan to destroy half of all life in the universe, and they recruit [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]'s attention. Maw is unable to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment and captures Strange. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship while Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.\n\nThe [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor. Thor surmises that Thanos is going after the Reality Stone, which [[Taneleer Tivan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Taneleer Tivan]] possesses on [[Knowhere (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Knowhere]]. He travels with [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]] and [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]] to [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Nidavellir|Nidavellir]] to enlist the aid of the dwarf king [[Eitri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Eitri]] in creating the battle-axe [[Stormbreaker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stormbreaker]].

On Vormir, the Stone's keeper,<!--The CREDITS specifically call him the \"Stonekeeper\"--> [[Red Skull (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Red Skull]], tells Thanos that he can only acquire it by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos kills Gamora, earning the Stone.\n\nIn [[Edinburgh]], Midnight and Glaive ambush [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] and [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead.

Vision asks Maximoff to destroy him and the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it, but Maximoff refuses. Rogers suggests they travel to [[Wakanda (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wakanda]], which he believes has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision.\n\nNebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos' destroyed homeworld, [[Titan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Titan]]. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. The trio crash-lands on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] win. The group formulates a plan to subdue Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, which he uses to safely house the Stones. Thanos appears and justifies his plans as necessary to guarantee the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. Nebula arrives soon after and helps the others subdue Thanos, but then deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks Thanos, inadvertently allowing him to break the group's hold and overpower them. Thanos grievously wounds Stark, but Strange offers the Time Stone in exchange for sparing Stark's life.\n\nIn Wakanda, Rogers reunites with [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, along with [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]] and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while [[Shuri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shuri]] works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Unable to summon the Hulk after losing his fight with Thanos, Banner fights in Stark's [[Hulkbuster armor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulkbuster armor]]. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers and together they kill Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive. Although Thanos' army is routed, Shuri is unable to complete the extraction before Thanos himself arrives on the field. Vision convinces Maximoff to destroy him and the Mind Stone, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse her actions and rips the stone from Vision's forehead. Thor severely wounds Thanos with Stormbreaker, but Thanos activates the completed Gauntlet by [[The Blip|snapping his fingers]] before teleporting away.\n\nHalf of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, Parker, [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]], and [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]], though Fury is able to send an emergency signal on a modified [[pager]].{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel|group=N|Identified off-screen as a message to [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel]].<ref name=\"CaptainMarvel\" />}} Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while Banner, [[M'Baku (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|M'Baku]], [[Okoye (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Okoye]], Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield.

She said the convention footage (intended to please the crowd who were \"jittery with anticipation\") was released between ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' and ''Thor: Ragnarok'', and heavily focused Thor and the Guardians, while the trailer (designed to explain the film to general audiences) heavily features Black Panther and Wakanda, which Alexander said could not have been done before the additional marketing for ''Black Panther'' that happened after the conventions provided additional context.<ref name=\"PolygonTrailer\" /> Gael Cooper of [[CNET]] observed that the trailer was viewed nearly 500,000 times in its first 15 minutes after it was posted on [[YouTube]], but questioned if the trailer broke the site after the view counter appeared to be stuck at 467,331.<ref name=\"Cooper_trailer\" /> The trailer was viewed 230&nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, [[List of most viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period]], surpassing the record of ''It''.<ref name=\"TrailerViews\" />\n\nIn January 2018, Marvel Comics published a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|two-issue prequel comic]] titled ''Avengers: Infinity War Prelude'', which serves as a bridge between ''Captain America: Civil War'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War''.<ref name=\"PreludeComic\" /> A commercial for ''Infinity War'' aired during [[Super Bowl LII]], and generated the most social media buzz of all the films advertised according to comScore and [[United Talent Agency]]; it was viewed 17.6&nbsp;million times across YouTube and [[Facebook]].<ref name=\"SuperBowl\" /> On February 27, Disney and Marvel announced the \"Marvel: The Universe Unites\" charity campaign leading to the release of merchandise for the film on March 3.

However, there was some controversy with the film's release in that country. Originally, the [[Russian government]] ordered it to be released on May 11, but after a scandal the government made concessions and agreed to let it premiere on May 3 with a condition that on May 9, during the [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]], only Russian films would be played in the cinema theatres.<ref name=\"RussiaFun\" /> ''Infinity War'' was also the first film in Russia to sell more than 1 million tickets in a single day,<ref name=\"DeadlineIntWknd1Mid\" /> and went on to gross $17.6 million in the market, a new opening weekend record.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"''Avengers: Infinity War'' ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions.\"<ref>{{Cite Rotten Tomatoes |id={{RT data|rtid|noprefix=y}}|type=m |title=Avengers: Infinity War |access-date={{RT data|access date}}}}{{RT data|edit}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100 based on 54 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{Cite Metacritic |id=avengers-infinity-war |type=movie |title=Avengers: Infinity War |access-date=April 20, 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' praised the writers' and directors' ability to balance the large cast of characters, saying they, \"under the supervision of Marvel Films maestro Kevin Feige, acknowledge the traffic jam of egos and play it for laughs\".<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' concurred, stating, \"''Infinity War'' is a brashly entertaining jamboree, structured to show off each hero or heroine and give them just enough to do, and to update their mythologies without making it all feel like homework\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] said the film is \"too much of a good thing\" and wrote, \"The Russo brothers have clearly never learned the concept that less is more. They've used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs that won't quit\".<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\" /> [[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it Marvel's \"biggest and most ambitious movie yet\", but concluded \"it's certainly not the best. However, there's plenty of action, humor and heart\u2014and some genuinely effective dramatic moments\". Roeper went on to praise the film's cast and Josh Brolin in particular, whom he called \"the film's most interesting performance\".<ref name=\"SunTimesReview\" /> Gleiberman called Brolin's motion capture performance \"supremely effective\" and said, \"Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> McCarthy wrote, \"Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain\".<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> Gleiberman also praised the film's action sequences, saying \"''Infinity War'' brims with tensely spectacular combat sequences, even if the question of who's going to win each one has that extravagantly arbitrary could-[[Mighty Mouse|Mighty-Mouse]]-beat-up-[[Superman]]? quality\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> McCarthy called the scale of the action \"astonishing\",<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> and Travers wrote, \"''Avengers: Infinity War'' leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes\".<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview\" /> Josh Spiegel, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', said the film takes \"a cue from the ending of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' in its super-sized finale; this is the equivalent of [[Han Solo]] frozen in the [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]], on steroids\".<ref name=\"EmpireStrikesBack\" />\n\n[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized the film's reliance on other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"Considered on its own, as a single, nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie, ''Avengers: Infinity War'' makes very little sense\", but conceded that it \"was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\" /> [[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' agreed, stating, \"The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\".<ref name=\"NewYorkerReview\" /> [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said, \"[It] isn't really a beginning, but more of a middle or an end with a new piece of yarn attached. You need to have seen and internalized every one of the previous 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to fully get it\".<ref name=\"TimeReview\" /> [[Justin Chang]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it a \"brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close\", but called its ultimate bid for catharsis \"unsuccessful\" since the Marvel \"assembly line [is not stopped] from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency\".<ref name=\"LATReview\" /> Scott also criticized the action sequences, calling them \"tedious and predictable\" and \"surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\" /> Likewise, Zacharek said, \"There's no pacing in ''Avengers: Infinity War''. It's all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time\".<ref name=\"TimeReview\" />\n\n=== Audience response ===\nAudiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" /> and those at [[PostTrak]] gave the film an 87% overall positive score and a 68% \"definite recommend\".<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd2\" /> American YouTube personality Tony \"Nem\" Mitchell watched the film 103 times in theaters, a world record. When Mitchell's streak was gaining media awareness around his 44th viewing, he noted that IMAX reached out to give him 50 free tickets to continue the streak, and the Russo brothers invited him to ''Endgame''{{'}}s premiere.<ref name=\"NemViewingPolygon\" /><ref name=\"NemViewingComicBook\" /><ref name=\"NemViewingCBR\" /> Mitchell said this was the way he \"want[ed] to support Marvel and the Russo brothers\".<ref name=\"NemViewingPolygon\" /> Seventeen-year-old Kieran Harvey from [[Staffordshire]] also watched the film in theaters 100 times. Harvey stated that he \"didn't plan on seeing it this many times it just sort of happened\" adding that ''Infinity War'' \"just felt so different to anything I've ever seen before, and I just love it so much so have been going as much as I can!\"<ref name=\"HarveyViewing\" />\n\nThe ending of the film sparked various [[Internet meme]] reactions,<ref name=\"CBRMemes\" /> including one referencing Spider-Man saying he does not feel good as he disintegrates, which was applied to other things.<ref name=\"SpideyFadeMeme\" /> The website, ''DidThanosKill.Me'' was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not.<ref name=\"DidThanosKillMeWebsite\" /> The ending also spawned the creation of the [[Reddit]] subreddit, /r/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible. Once the administrators agreed to the random ban of half the subscribers, it was set to occur on July 9, 2018.<ref name=\"PolygonRedditBan\" /> Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit's subscribers increase to over 700,000,<ref name=\"GizmodoRedditBan\" /> including both of the Russos who subscribed.<ref name=\"RussosRedditBan\" /> Ahead of the ban, Brolin posted a video saying \"Here we go, Reddit users,\" and ending it with a snap.<ref name=\"BrolinRedditBan\" /> Over 60,000 people watched a live [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] stream of the ban occurring, which lasted several hours.<ref name=\"GizmodoRedditBan\" /> The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history.<ref name=\"GizmodoRedditBan\" /><ref name=\"VergeRedditBan\" /> Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit, /r/inthesoulstone.<ref name=\"PolygonRedditBan\" /><ref name=\"GizmodoRedditBan\" /> One Reddit user who participated described the ban as embodying \"the spirit of the Internet\" with people \"banding together, en masse, around something relatively meaningless but somehow decidedly awesome and hilarious\".<ref name=\"VergeRedditBan\" /> Andrew Tigani of ''[[Screen Rant]]'' said this showed \"how impactful the film has already become to pop culture. It is also a testament to how valuable fan interaction can be via social media\".<ref name=\"BrolinRedditBan\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Avengers: Infinity War|l1=List of accolades received by ''Avengers: Infinity War''}}\nAt the [[91st Academy Awards]], ''Avengers: Infinity War'' received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]].<ref name=\"AcademyAwards\" /> The film's other nominations include an [[Annie Award]],<ref name=\"Annie\" /> a [[British Academy Film Award]],<ref name=\"Bafta\" /> and two [[Critics' Choice Awards]].<ref name=\"CriticsChoice\" /> In 2020, ''Infinity War'' was ranked seventh in an ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.<ref name=\"EmpireRanking\" />\n\n== Sequel ==\n{{Main|Avengers: Endgame{{!}}''Avengers: Endgame''}}\n{{further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films}}\n\n''Avengers: Endgame'' was released on April 26, 2019,<ref name=\"EndgameTitleReveal\" /> with the Russos returning to direct,<ref name=\"Russos2\" /> and Markus and McFeely once again writing the screenplay.<ref name=\"MarkusMcFeely\" /><!-- Please note!
