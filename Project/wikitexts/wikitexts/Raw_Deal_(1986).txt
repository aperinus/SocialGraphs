The film was released in North America on June 6, 1986. The film tells the story of an elderly and embittered high-ranking FBI chief, Harry Shannon, who wants to get revenge against a [[American Mafia|Mafia organization]] and sends a former FBI agent and now small-town sheriff Mark Kaminski to destroy the organization from the inside.\n\nThe film received negative reviews, grossing $16.2 million domestically against its $8\u201310 million budget.<ref name=\"dino\"/><ref name=\"dinod\"/><ref name=number/>\n\n==Plot==\nOn December 16, 1985, in a remote wooded cabin, a mob informant is under protection by the [[FBI]]. They are ambushed by a hit squad who brutally slaughter the bodyguards and the witness. One of the agents killed is Blair Shannon, son of FBI Agent Harry Shannon, who vows revenge.\n\nAfter capturing a man posing as a motorcycle cop, small-town sheriff Mark Kaminski goes home to his alcoholic wife Amy, who resents what their lives have been reduced to; Kaminski once worked for the FBI, but five years ago he brutally beat a suspect who sexually assaulted and murdered a young girl. Kaminski was given the option to \"resign or be prosecuted\" by ambitious prosecutor Marvin Baxter, who is now Special Federal Prosecutor heading up a committee investigating the dealings of Luigi Patrovita, the strongest of the [[Chicago Outfit]] Dons.\n\nDue to a leak within the FBI ranks causing their agents to be killed, Shannon recruits Kaminski for an unsanctioned assignment to infiltrate and dismantle Patrovita's organization. Kaminski fakes his own death in a chemical plant explosion and poses as convicted felon Joseph P. Brenner. He manages to get an audience with Patrovita's right-hand man Paulo Rocca, and convinces them of his worth by harassing Martin Lamanski, a rival mob boss who is trying to move in on his former boss Patrovita's territory. While at Patrovita's casino, hidden in a basement level of a high class hotel, he makes the acquaintance of Monique, who works for Rocca's top lieutenant Max Keller.\n\nKaminski continues to work his way into the good graces of the Patrovita family, including devising a plan that recovers $100 million of [[heroin]] and cash seized by the feds from one of Patrovita's hideouts and simultaneously assisting in Lamanski's assassination. Keller isn't convinced that 'Brenner' is who he says and manages to find proof of the deception, showing Kaminski's photo to a police informant who previously arrested the real Brenner. The leak the FBI has been looking for is revealed to be Baxter, who is forced to stay close to Patrovita. Kaminski accompanies Keller to a cemetery for a hit job, but discovers that the target is Shannon, forcing Kaminski to blow his cover and kill Keller. In the ensuing shootout, Shannon is severely wounded and crippled.\n\nKaminski escapes with Monique's assistance. He tells her to go to the airport and wait for him. After gathering an arsenal of firearms, Kaminski raids one of Patrovita's gravel pits, killing everyone and stealing a large amount of drug money. He then sets off for Patrovita's casino, where he embarks on a killing spree, single-handedly wiping out all his soldiers, including the men directly responsible for the murder of Blair and his fellow FBI agents. Rocca and Patrovita retreat to a back room, but Rocca is cut down in a barrage of gunfire. Patrovita flees into an office pleading for his life, but Kaminski mercilessly guns him down. On his way out, he encounters a whimpering Baxter who tries to talk his way out by apologizing for what happened five years ago. Kaminski responds to Baxter by saying that because of him a lot of people are dead, and now it\u2019s his turn and offers him a gun with the same line Baxter gave him five years earlier: \"Resign, or be prosecuted. Any way you want it.\" Kaminski starts to walk off, and when Baxter attempts to shoot him, Kaminski turns and shoots Baxter dead in [[self-defense]].  After driving to the airport, Kaminski hands a duffel bag containing $250,000 in cash to Monique and gets her on a chartered plane, telling her she is free and can start a new life with no obligations to anyone.\n\nDuring the aftermath, Kaminski is reinstated with the FBI and is reunited with a pregnant Amy. Kaminski visits a despondent Shannon, who refuses to undergo physical therapy. In order to thank Shannon for helping him, Kaminski asks him to be his child's godfather in exchange for completing his therapy, which Shannon accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Sheriff Mark Kaminski / Joseph P.

Partly due to the poor box office performance of ''Raw Deal'', De Laurentiis would eventually file for bankruptcy and the rights to ''Total Recall'' were sold to [[Carolco Pictures]]. At the time, Schwarzenegger was still under contract with De Laurentiis for a number of ''Conan the Barbarian'' sequels, and in exchange for dissolving this multi-picture agreement, Schwarzenegger agreed to star in ''Raw Deal''. Initially, Schwarzenegger was more interested in doing ''Total Recall'' but De Laurentiis objected as he did not feel that Schwarzenegger was right for the leading role. [[Patrick Swayze]] was cast before De Laurentiis' bankruptcy.<ref name=\"trivia\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091828/trivia|title = Raw Deal (1986) - IMDb| website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref>{{better source needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nFilming was done on location in [[Chicago]], [[Castle Hayne, North Carolina]] and [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] at the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] Studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091828/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt|title=Raw Deal (1986) - IMDb|website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref>{{better source needed|date=January 2019}} The film was originally intended to be called \"Let's Make a Deal\", and during production and filming this was changed to \"Triple Identity\".
