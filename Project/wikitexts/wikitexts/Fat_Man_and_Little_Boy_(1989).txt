The story follows the [[Manhattan Project]], the secret [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] endeavor to develop the first [[nuclear weapon]]s during [[World War II]]. The film is named after \"[[Little Boy]]\" and \"[[Fat Man]]\", the two bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nIn September 1942, [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] Colonel [[Leslie Groves]] ([[Paul Newman]]) who oversaw construction of [[the Pentagon]] is assigned to head the ultra-secret Manhattan Project, to beat the Germans, who have a similar [[German nuclear weapons program|nuclear weapons program]].\n\nGroves picks [[University of California, Berkeley]], physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] ([[Dwight Schultz]]) to head the team of the project. Oppenheimer was familiar with northern [[New Mexico]] from his boyhood days when his family owned a cabin in the area. For the new research facility, he selects a remote location on top of a mesa adjacent to a valley called Los Alamos Canyon, northwest of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].\n\nThe different personalities of the military man Groves and the scientist Oppenheimer often clash in keeping the project on track. Oppenheimer in turn clashes with the other scientists, who debate whether their personal consciences should enter into the project or whether they should remain purely researchers, with personal feelings set aside.\n\nNurse Kathleen Robinson ([[Laura Dern]]) and young physicist Michael Merriman ([[John Cusack]]) question what they are doing. Working with little protection from radiation during an experiment, Michael drops a radioactive component during an experiment dubbed [[Demon core|Tickling the Dragon's Tail]] and retrieves it by hand in order to avoid disaster, but is exposed to a [[lethal dose of radiation]]. In the base hospital, nurse Kathleen can only watch as he develops massive swelling and deformation before dying a miserable death days later. (This episode is drawn from an accident that happened to physicist [[Louis Slotin]].<ref>Grouett, Stephane. Manhattan Project: The Untold Story of the Making of the Atomic Bomb (Boston: Little, Brown & Company), 1967, page 324.</ref>)\n\nWhile the technical problems are being solved, investigations are undertaken in order to thwart foreign [[espionage]], especially from [[Red scare|communist sympathizers]] who might be associated with socialist organizations. The snooping reveals that Oppenheimer has had a young mistress, [[Jean Tatlock]] ([[Natasha Richardson]]), and he is ordered by Groves to stop seeing her. After he breaks off their relationship without being able to reveal the reasons why, she is unable to cope with the heartache and is later found dead, apparently a suicide.\n\nAs the project continues in multiple sites across America, technical problems and delays cause tensions and strife. To avoid a [[single point of failure]] plan, two separate bomb designs are implemented: a large, heavy [[plutonium]] bomb imploded using [[shaped charge]]s (\"[[Fat Man]]\"), and an alternative design for a thin, less heavy [[uranium]] bomb triggered in a shotgun design (\"[[Little Boy]]\"). The bomb development culminates in a detonation in south-central New Mexico at the [[Trinity Site]] in the [[Alamogordo]] Desert (05:29:45 on July 16, 1945), where everyone watched in awe at the spectacle of the first [[mushroom cloud]] with roaring winds, even miles away.\n\nIn the end, both bombs, Fat Man and Little Boy, were successful, ushering in the [[Atomic Age]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Paul Newman]] as General [[Leslie Groves]]\n* [[Dwight Schultz]] as [[J.

Noted critic [[Roger Ebert]] felt the film lackluster, giving it 1 and a 1/2 stars, and felt that \"The story of the birth of the bomb is one of high drama, but it was largely intellectual drama, as the scientists asked themselves, in conversations and nightmares, what terror they were unleashing on the Earth. ''Fat Man and Little Boy'' reduces their debates to the childish level of Hollywood stereotyping.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fat-man-and-little-boy-1989 |title = Fat Man and Little Boy movie review (1989) &#124; Roger Ebert}}</ref> The film holds a 48% rating on review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 21 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fat_man_and_little_boy/ |title = Fat Man and Little Boy (1989)|website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nThe film made under $4 million on its original release.
