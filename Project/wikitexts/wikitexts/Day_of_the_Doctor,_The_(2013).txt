Revising the [[back story]], the Doctor succumbs to [[Clara Oswald]]'s plea to change his mind; and instead he freezes his war-torn home planet in a single moment in time and hides it in a pocket universe, rather than destroy it. Unfortunately the time distortions incurred causes all but his latest incarnation to have no memory of his changed decision.\n\nThe episode starred [[Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[Jenna Coleman]] as his companion, Clara Oswald. Previous lead actors [[David Tennant]] and [[Billie Piper]] returned for the episode, Tennant reprising his role as the [[Tenth Doctor]], while Piper portrayed a sentient doomsday weapon called the Moment, projected as an image based on her character [[Rose Tyler]]. She is invisible and inaudible to everyone but the War Doctor ([[John Hurt]]). Other appearances included a very brief glimpse of the then-upcoming [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]), and a guest appearance by [[Fourth Doctor]] actor [[Tom Baker]], in his late 70s.

It received critical acclaim and has been described by series producer Marcus Wilson as a \"love letter to the fans\" and by the controller of [[BBC One]], [[Danny Cohen (television executive)|Danny Cohen]], as an \"event drama\".<ref name=\"SS13\" /><ref>{{cite journal |title=BBC1 Controller Danny Cohen outlines new commissions and five key themes for 2013 |journal=Radio Times |date=30 November 2012 |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-11-30/bbc1-controller-danny-cohen-outlines-new-commissions-and-five-key-themes-for-2013}}</ref>\n\n==Mini-episodes==\n{{see also|The Night of the Doctor|The Last Day (Doctor Who)|l2=The Last Day}}\nTwo mini-episodes written by [[Steven Moffat]], \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" (14 November 2013) and \"[[The Last Day (Doctor Who)|The Last Day]]\" (21 November 2013), were released shortly prior to \"The Day of the Doctor\", depicting in-series events occurring during the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] between the Doctor's own race of [[Time Lord]]s and his [[Archenemy|nemesis]], the [[Dalek]]s.\n\n\"The Night of the Doctor\" depicts the [[Eighth Doctor]]'s [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] into the [[War Doctor]]. After being resurrected temporarily by the Sisterhood of Karn in the aftermath of a spaceship crash, the Doctor is persuaded by the sisters to take action to end the Time War, offering him a selection of potions to control his regeneration.\n\n\"The Last Day\" is filmed from the first-person perspective of a soldier who has had a camera implanted in his head when the [[Gallifrey]] city of Arcadia falls to the Daleks. The \"Fall of Arcadia\" becomes the central battle of the Time War around which \"The Day of the Doctor\" is centred.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (14896794319).jpg|150px|thumb|left|The Moment prop as shown at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nIn the midst of the Time War between the Time Lords and the Daleks, the War Doctor \u2014 an incarnation of [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] about 400 years younger than the [[Eleventh Doctor]] \u2014 decides to trigger an ancient and sentient weapon called the Moment to destroy both sides. The Moment's humanoid interface, resembling [[Rose Tyler]], shows what the War Doctor's future would be after the Time Lords are destroyed but the Doctor survives. The Moment opens a fissure linking the War Doctor to the [[Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] and Eleventh Doctors in 1562 England. In 1562, the [[Zygon]]s enter three-dimensional paintings made with the Time Lords' stasis cubes, and go into suspended animation to emerge in the present. After breaking out of the paintings in the [[National Gallery]] in the present, the Zygons take the forms of members of the military organisation [[UNIT]] so that they can utilise weapons and technology kept by UNIT in the [[Tower of London]].\n\nUNIT head Kate Stewart starts a countdown for a nuclear warhead beneath the Tower that will destroy the advanced technology along with London. The Doctors, unable to land a [[TARDIS]] in the Tower, use the stasis cube technology to enter a painting. They exit the painting in the Tower in the present and use UNIT's mind-wiping equipment to render the UNIT members and Zygons temporarily unaware which of them are which. The countdown is stopped and all present negotiate a peace treaty.\n\nThe War Doctor, convinced that detonating the Moment will save many more lives in the longer term, is returned to his time. The other two Doctors follow him with the intention of helping him detonate the Moment. When [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] insists they do not destroy their people, the Doctors devise an alternative solution. The Doctors, aided by ten of their other incarnations, plan to use the stasis technology to freeze Gallifrey in a pocket universe. When Gallifrey disappears, the surrounding Dalek warships obliterate themselves in the inevitable crossfire.\n\n{{quote box\n|width = 30em\n|border = 1px\n|align=right\n|bgcolor=\n|fontsize = 85%\n|title_bg =\n|title_fnt =\n|title =\n|quote = \"I have a new destination.

The War and Tenth Doctors realise they will not remember what happened; they will continue shouldering the guilt. The War Doctor begins to regenerate after leaving. Hinting that the plan worked, the gallery's curator, who resembles the Doctor's fourth incarnation, reveals to the Eleventh Doctor that one of the three-dimensional paintings is called ''Gallifrey Falls No More''. The Eleventh Doctor vows to find Gallifrey.\n\n===Continuity===\nAs the show's 50th anniversary special, the episode contains a multitude of references to previous episodes. It opens with the title sequence and theme arrangement used at the series' debut in 1963. Echoing the opening of \"[[An Unearthly Child]]\", the first episode of the [[An Unearthly Child|first ''Doctor Who'' serial]], a policeman is shown walking past the sign for I.M. Foreman, the scrap merchant in whose yard the TARDIS was located, and its first few seconds are in monochrome (as had been the case in ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' (1985), the last time more than one Doctor had featured in an official story). [[Coal Hill School]], which the Doctor's granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] attended when they were on Earth in 1963 in the very first story, also featured in the 1988 serial ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''. According to the school sign, the chairman of the school governors is now [[Ian Chesterton]], one of the First Doctor's original three companions and a science teacher at the school, and the headmaster is W. Coburn, a reference to [[Waris Hussein]] and [[Anthony Coburn]], who respectively directed and wrote ''An Unearthly Child''.<ref name=\"callbacks\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2013/11/doctor-13-best-callbacks-references-day-doctor/ |title='Doctor Who': The 13 Best Callbacks and References in 'The Day of the Doctor' |last=Patrick |first=Seb |work=Anglophenia |publisher=[[BBC America]] |date=25 November 2013 |access-date=30 November 2013 }}</ref> Clara rides out of Coal Hill School on the Eleventh Doctor's anti-gravity motorcycle from \"[[The Bells of Saint John]]\" at 5:16, the time ''An Unearthly Child'' originally aired on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] (the first broadcast began 1 minute 20 seconds after its scheduled time of 17:15 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on 23 November 1963).<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), p. 54</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml | title=An Unearthly Child |publisher=BBC | date=16 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhen the TARDIS is picked up by UNIT, the call sign used by the helicopter to refer to UNIT is \"Greyhound leader\", reflecting that of [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]],<ref name=\"nostalgia\">{{cite news |url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/11/24/15-nostalgic-classic-doctor-who-hat-tips-in-the-day-of-the-doctor-what-did-you-spot-4199273/ |title=16 nostalgic classic Doctor Who hat-tips in the Day of the Doctor \u2013 what did you spot? |last=Wilson |first=Dan |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=24 November 2013 |access-date=30 November 2013 }}</ref> whose daughter Kate is now portrayed as having his role as commander of UNIT.

An image of the Brigadier is seen alongside images of various companions of the Doctor. The [[UNIT dating]] controversy, regarding whether the Third Doctor era stories took place in the 1970s or 1980s, is alluded to in dialogue by Kate Stewart, when she mentions that events occurred in \"the '70s or '80s depending on the dating protocol used\".<ref name=\"nostalgia\"/>\n\nThe Tenth Doctor's era is also heavily revisited.
