The film centers on Stanley Jobson, an ex-con and [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] who is targeted for recruitment into a bank robbery conspiracy because of his formidable hacking skills.\n\n== Plot ==\nStanley Jobson is a [[Hacker (computer security)|cyber-hacker]] who became notorious for infecting the [[FBI]]'s [[Carnivore (software)|Carnivore]] program with a [[computer virus]]. Stanley's parole forbids him from accessing the internet and computers while his ex-wife Melissa, an alcoholic and part-time porn star, has issued a restraining order against him. This also prevents him from seeing his only daughter Holly.\n\nGinger Knowles persuades Stanley to work for Gabriel Shear, who threatens him into cracking a secure [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] server. After the hack, Gabriel offers Stanley $10&nbsp;million to program a multi-headed [[Computer worm|worm]], a \"hydra\", to siphon $9.5&nbsp;billion from government [[slush fund]]s. Stanley begins work on the worm, learning that Gabriel leads Black Cell, a secret organization created by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to launch retaliatory attacks against [[terrorist]]s that threaten the United States. He also privately discovers Ginger is a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent working undercover and is further surprised to discover a corpse that resembles Gabriel.\n\nAfter he takes Holly home from school, Stanley discovers that he is being followed by FBI agent J.T. Roberts, who had previously arrested him. Roberts, though monitoring Stanley closely, is more interested in Gabriel as he does not appear on any government database, and after learning that another hacker, Axl Torvalds had been killed by Gabriel's men, warns Stanley to be cautious. Stanley opts to secretly code a backdoor in his hydra that reverses the money transfer after a short period. Meanwhile, [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] Jim Reisman, who oversees Black Cell, learns the FBI has started tracking Gabriel and orders him to stand down. Gabriel refuses and narrowly defeats a hit team dispatched against him by Reisman. In retaliation, Gabriel personally kills Reisman in revenge and continues his plan.\n\nStanley delivers the hydra to Gabriel and leaves to see Holly, only to find that Gabriel has [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] her and framed him for Melissa's murder alongside her husband and porn producer. Stanley has no choice but to participate in a bank heist to get Holly back. At the site of the heist, Gabriel and his men storm a branch and secure its employees and customers as hostages, fitting each of them with ball-bearing-based explosives similar to [[Claymore mine]]s. When police and FBI surround the branch, Gabriel takes Stanley to a nearby coffee shop across the street to meet with Roberts, but Gabriel spends the time discussing the film ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'' and the nature of misdirection. Once back in the bank, Gabriel has one of his men escort a hostage to demonstrate the situation where a sharpshooter kills the man. As other agents pull the hostage away from the bank, the bomb detonates and devastates much of the street, a scene shown ''[[in medias res]]''.\n\nGabriel instructs Stanley to launch the hydra and turns Holly over to him once completed. However, the back door triggers before they can leave the bank, leading to Stanley being recaptured while Holly is rescued. Gabriel threatens to kill Ginger, who he knows is a DEA agent, unless Stanley re-siphons the money back to a [[Monte Carlo]] bank. Although Stanley complies, Gabriel shoots Ginger. Gabriel and his men load the hostages onto a bus and demand a plane wait for them at the local airport, but while en route, the bus is lifted off by an [[Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane|S-64 Aircrane]] and deposited on the roof of a local skyscraper. Gabriel deactivates the bombs and departs with his surviving men on a waiting helicopter, which Stanley shoots down using a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] from the bus.\n\nRoberts takes Stanley to verify a corpse they found, believing Gabriel was a [[Mossad]] agent. There is no record of a DEA agent named Ginger Knowles, and her body hasn't been found. Stanley recognizes the corpse as the one he discovered earlier and personally realizes that the whole scenario was a deception; Ginger was wearing a bulletproof vest and was working with Gabriel all along, who escaped via a different route. Despite Stanley not telling the police that Gabriel and Ginger are still alive, Roberts arranges for Stanley to have full custody of Holly, where they depart to places elsewhere. In Monte Carlo, Gabriel and Ginger withdraw the stolen money and later watch as a yacht at sea explodes. Over the film's credits, a news report reveals the destruction of the yacht, carrying a known terrorist, as the third such incident in as many weeks.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as Stanley Jobson\n* [[John Travolta]] as Gabriel Shear\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Ginger Knowles\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Agent J.T.

Critics said the scene looked forced, just to garner press. \"Halle Berry Nude\" jumped to the top of search engine results. Berry said she did the topless scene, knowing it was gratuitous, to overcome the fear of appearing nude onscreen.<ref name=Berry>{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/B/Berry_Halle/2007/03/22/3804325.html|title=Halle Berry bares her soul|access-date=July 20, 2009|publisher=[[Canoe.ca]]|last=Kirkland|first=Bruce|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711143619/http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/B/Berry_Halle/2007/03/22/3804325.html|archive-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2020|08}}, 25% of the 138 reviews compiled on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] are positive, with an average rating of 4.35/10.

The film's orchestral score was written by [[Christopher Young]] with several electronic additions by Paul Oakenfold. Fragments from the score were added to the official soundtrack, but were remixed by Oakenfold.
