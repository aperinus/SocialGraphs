It stars [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]], [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Ruth Hussey]]. The film is set in 1759, and tells a partly fictionalized version of the real-life [[St. Francis Raid]] by [[Rogers' Rangers]], led by [[Robert Rogers (British Army officer)|Robert Rogers]] (played by Tracy) on the primarily [[Abenaki]] village of [[Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis]], in modern-day [[Canada]]. The screenplay, by [[Laurence Stallings]] and [[Talbot Jennings]], is based on the 1937 historical novel ''[[Northwest Passage (novel)|Northwest Passage]]'' by [[Kenneth Roberts (author)|Kenneth Roberts]].\n\nRoberts' novel is split into two parts, referred to as \"Book 1\" and \"Book 2\", and the film is based entirely on Book 1. There was originally discussion about filming a sequel that would cover Book 2, but this did not happen. Ironically, Rogers' quest to find a [[Northwest Passage]] through [[North America]], which gave both the novel and the film their title, takes place in Book 2, and is only briefly mentioned in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1759, Langdon Towne ([[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]]), son of a ropemaker and ship rigger, returns to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] after his expulsion from [[Harvard University]]. Though disappointed, his family greets him with love, as does Elizabeth Browne ([[Ruth Hussey]]). Elizabeth's father ([[Louis Hector]]), a noted clergyman, is less welcoming and denigrates Langdon's aspirations to become a [[artist|painter]].\n\nAt the local tavern with friend Sam Livermore ([[Lester Matthews]]), Langdon disparages Wiseman Clagett ([[Montagu Love]]), the king's attorney and the Native American agent [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson]], unaware that Clagett is in the next room with another official. Facing arrest, Langdon fights the two men with the help of \"Hunk\" Marriner ([[Walter Brennan]]), a local woodsman and both escape into the countryside.\n\nFleeing westward, Langdon and Marriner stop in a backwoods tavern, where they help a man in a green uniform. After a night of drinking \"Flip\" - similar to hot buttered rum - the two men wake up at [[Fort Crown Point]], where they learn the man they met is [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Major Robert Rogers]] ([[Spencer Tracy]]), commander of [[Rogers' Rangers]]. In need of Langdon's map-making skills, Rogers recruits the two men for his latest expedition to destroy the hostile [[Abenakis]] tribe and their town of [[Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-du-Lac, Quebec|St. Francis]] far to the north.\n\nRogers' force rows north in whale boats on [[Lake Champlain]] by night, evading [[New France|French]] patrols, but several soldiers are injured in a confrontation with [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] scouts. Rogers sends not only the wounded back to Crown Point, but also the disloyal Mohawks provided by Sir William Johnson (Frederick Worlock) and a number of men who disobeyed orders. Concealing their boats, the depleted force marches through swampland to conceal their movements. Informed by Stockbridge Indian scouts that the French have captured their boats and extra supplies, Rogers revises his plan and sends an injured officer back to Fort Crown Point requesting the British send supplies to old [[Fort Wentworth]], to be met by the returning rangers.\n\nMaking a human chain to cross a river, the rangers reach St. Francis. Their attack succeeds, and they set fire to the dwellings and cut the Abenakis off from retreat. After the battle, the rangers find only a few baskets of parched corn to replenish their provisions. Marriner finds Langdon shot in his abdomen. The rangers set out for Wentworth, pursued by hostile French and Indian forces. Their initial objective is [[Lake Memphremagog]], with the injured Langdon bringing up the rear.\n\nTen days later, Rogers' men reach the hills above Lake Memphremagog. Encountering signs of French activity, Rogers prefers to press on a hundred miles to Fort Wentworth, but the men vote to split up into four parties to hunt for food. [[game (food)|Game]] proves scarce and two of the detachments are ambushed by the French, leaving most of the men dead. Persevering through harsh conditions, Rogers and the remaining fifty men finally reach the fort, only to find it unoccupied and in disrepair, and the British relief column has not arrived. Though personally despairing, Rogers attempts to perk up their flagging spirits with a prayer. They then hear the [[Fife (musical instrument)|fifes]] and drums of approaching British boats with the supplies. Reporting that the Abenakis have been destroyed, the British honour Rogers\u2019 men by [[present arms (command)|presenting their firearms]] and shouting \"Huzzah\".\n\nReturning to Portsmouth, Langdon reunites with Elizabeth while the Rangers are given a new mission: to find the [[Northwest Passage]]. Rogers fires them up with a speech about the wonders they will see on the march to the first point of embarkation, a little fort called \"[[Fort Detroit|Detroit]].\" He passes by Langdon and Elizabeth to say goodbye; Elizabeth informs him that she and Langdon are headed for London where she is hopeful Langdon will become a great painter. Rogers bids them farewell and marches down the road and off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Major Rogers]]\n* [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] as Langdon Towne\n* [[Walter Brennan]] as \"Hunk\" Marriner\n* [[Ruth Hussey]] as Elizabeth Browne\n* [[Nat Pendleton]] as \"Cap\" Huff\n* [[Louis Hector]] as Reverend Browne\n* [[Robert Barrat]] as Humphrey Towne\n* [[Lumsden Hare]] as Lord Amherst\n* [[Donald MacBride]] as Sergeant McNott\n* [[Isabel Jewell]] as Jennie Coit\n* [[Douglas Walton (actor)|Douglas Walton]] as Lieutenant Avery\n* [[Addison Richards]] as Lieutenant Crofton\n* Hugh Sothern as Jesse Beacham\n* [[Regis Toomey]] as Webster\n* [[Montagu Love]] as Wiseman Clagett\n* [[Lester Matthews]] as Sam Livermore\n* [[Truman Bradley (actor)|Truman Bradley]] as Captain Ogden\n* [[Tom London]] as Ranger (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film is set in the mid-18th century during the [[French and Indian War]] (as the [[Seven Years' War]] in [[North America]] is usually known in the US). It is a partly fictionalized account of the [[St. Francis Raid]], an attack by [[Rogers' Rangers]] on Saint Francis (the current [[Odanak, Quebec]]), a settlement of the [[Abenakis]], an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribe. The purpose of the raid was to avenge the many attacks on British settlers and deter any further ones.\n\nThe title is something of a misnomer, since this film is a truncated version of the original story, and only at the end do we find that [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Rogers]] and his men are about to go on a search for the [[Northwest Passage]].\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in central [[Idaho]], near [[Payette Lake]] and the city of [[McCall, Idaho|McCall]].\n\nThe film wound up as MGM's most expensive film since ''Ben Hur'' (1926).<ref name=\"tracy\"/> The picture was originally slated for an even more lavish budget in an earlier incarnation and was to star [[Wallace Beery]] and Tracy but management difficulties between [[Irving Thalberg]] and [[Louis B. Mayer]] interceded at that time.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $2,169,000 in the US and Canada and $981,000 elsewhere but because of its high cost incurred a loss of $885,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\n===Awards and honors===\nThe film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography (Color)]] in 1941, but lost out to ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]''.\n\n==Sequels and related projects==\nAccording to one source, the script was revised by as many as 12 other writers, in addition to the two credited.<ref>Rob Nixon, [http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=21745&rss=mrqe ''Northwest Passage''], TCM.com.</ref>  Author [[Kenneth Roberts (author)|Kenneth Roberts]] served as a co-writer on a second draft of a proposed script for the movie, one that covered the entire novel, not just the first book of it. However, executives at MGM scuttled the revision and instead used the first draft of the script, which covered only the first book, as the basis for the finished film. This is why the film ''Northwest Passage'' was subtitled ''Book One: Roger's Rangers''.\n\nDirector [[King Vidor]] then attempted to make a sequel to the film in which Rogers' Rangers find the Northwest Passage, although Roberts refused to cooperate with the project. But filming never began, because MGM ultimately refused to [[green-light]] it.\n\nMGM produced a 1958-1959 American television series ''[[Northwest Passage (TV series)|Northwest Passage]]'' starring [[Keith Larsen]] as Robert Rogers, with [[Buddy Ebsen]] costarring as \"Hunk\" Marriner, replacing Walter Brennan, who had his own TV series, ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', in production at the time. The show aired on [[NBC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051299/ |title = Northwest Passage (TV Series 1958\u20131959) - IMDb}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Depiction of American Indians===\nThe film's depiction of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]s came to be criticized as racist, even by the standards of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] at the time. This appraisal mirrors that of the section of the novel set during the [[French and Indian War]], which has become equally regarded as racist.\n\nClive Denton, in his 1976 book ''The Hollywood Professionals: Volume 5'', made these observations on the subject:\n\n{{blockquote| Vidor\u2019s ''Northwest Passage'' \u201csits more than a trifle uneasily that [Spencer] Tracy and his submissive band attack and burn a sleeping Indian village. The tribe has massacred and outraged [innocent whites], we are told, but we have not ''seen'' them do anything wrong, and they are certainly not belligerent in their sleep. Perhaps I should not berate Vidor for the conventions of good guys and bad guys in adventure movies. But I am still somewhat bothered by Major Rogers, who, beneath Tracy\u2019s charm, is something of a bastard...\u201d (emphasis in original) <ref>Denton, 1976 p. 19-20: Denton adds that Tracy\u2019s character, Major Rogers \u201creminds his men to kill only bad Indians, not the good ones, who conveniently wear white crosses on their backs. Perhaps in 1939 one could question less the morality and the smooth practicality of such discrimination.\u201d</ref>}}\n\n===Later screenings===\nThe film was shown at the [[70th Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2020, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/press/press-releases/detail_8008.html |title=Berlinale 2020: Retrospective \"King Vidor\" |work=Berlinale |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Denton, Clive. 1976.
