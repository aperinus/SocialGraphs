The film is based loosely on the 2005 [[Yes Man (book)|memoir of the same name]] by humorist [[Danny Wallace (humorist)|Danny Wallace]], who also makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the film.\n\nProduction for the film began in [[Los Angeles]] in October 2007. It was released on December 19, 2008 in the United States and was then released in the United Kingdom on December 26, 2008. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office success, making $223 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nCarl, a bank loan officer, has become withdrawn since his divorce from Stephanie. He has an increasingly negative outlook on his life and routinely ignores his friends Peter and Rooney. On the advice of an old colleague, Nick, Carl attends a motivational seminar that encourages people to seize the opportunity to say \"Yes!\" At the seminar, Carl meets inspirational guru Terrence, who extracts from him a promise to answer \"Yes!\" to every opportunity that presents itself.\n\nLater, Carl says yes to a homeless man's request and is stranded out-of-gas and with no battery on his cell phone in [[Elysian Park, Los Angeles|Elysian Park]]. Disillusioned, he hikes to a nearby gas station where he meets Allison, an unorthodox young woman. She gives him a ride back to his car on her scooter and kisses him before leaving. \n\nAfter this positive experience, Carl feels more optimistic about saying yes. However, he refuses oral sex from his elderly neighbor Tillie, and then falls down the stairs and is nearly attacked by a dog. Seeing the repercussions of saying no, he goes back to Tillie and to his surprise enjoys the moment.\n\nCarl starts to seize every opportunity that comes his way. He renews his friendships with Peter and Rooney; builds a bond with his nerdy boss, Norman; assists Peter's fianc\u00e9e, Lucy, with her bridal shower; attends Korean language classes; and much more. \nAccepting a band flyer outside of a coffee shop, he sees an idiosyncratic band called Munchausen by Proxy; the lead singer is Allison. He is charmed by her quirkiness; she is delighted by his spontaneity and they begin dating. He earns a corporate promotion at work and, making use of his guitar lessons, plays [[Third Eye Blind]]'s song \"[[Jumper (Third Eye Blind song)|Jumper]]\" to persuade a man not to commit suicide.\n\nCarl and Allison meet at the airport for a spontaneous weekend excursion. Having decided to take the first plane out of town, regardless of its destination, they end up in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], where they bond more. Allison confesses her love for Carl and asks him to move in with her and he hesitantly agrees. \n\nWhile checking in for the return flight, Carl and Allison are detained by [[FBI]] agents who have profiled him as a potential terrorist as he has taken flying lessons, studied Korean, approved a loan to a fertilizer company, met an Iranian, and bought plane tickets at the last minute. Peter, his attorney, travels to Nebraska to explain Carl's odd habits, lessons, and decisions. \n\nAs she finds out about Carl's motivational covenant, Allison begins to doubt whether his commitment to her was ever sincere. Deciding that she can no longer trust him, she leaves Carl and refuses to return his phone calls.\n\nCarl's life takes a turn for the worse and he almost forgets about Lucy's shower. He manages to arrange a major surprise party, set his friend Norm up with Soo-Mi, a Korean girl, and Rooney with Tillie. After the party, Carl receives a tearful phone call from Stephanie, whose new boyfriend has walked out on her. When he goes to her apartment to comfort her, she kisses him and asks him to spend the night with her. After Carl emphatically says no, his luck takes a turn for the worse and he decides to end his commitment to the covenant.\n\nCarl goes to the convention center and hides in the backseat of Terrence's convertible so he can beg to be released from the covenant. He emerges as Terrence drives off, startling him. An oncoming vehicle collides with them, resulting in their being taken to a hospital. After Carl regains consciousness, Terrence tells him the covenant was not real. It was merely a starting point to open Carl's mind to other possibilities, not to permanently take away his ability to say no if he needed to. \n\nFreed from this restraint, Carl finds Allison teaching her sports-photography lesson and admits that he is not ready to move in with her just yet, but that he genuinely loves her, and they reconcile with a kiss as Allison's students take pictures.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Carl\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Allison\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Peter, Carl's best friend\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Nick\n* [[Rhys Darby]] as Norman, Carl's boss\n* [[Danny Masterson]] as Rooney, Carl's other best friend\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Tillie, Carl's elderly neighbor\n* [[Terence Stamp]] as Terrence\n* [[Sasha Alexander]] as Lucy, Peter's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Molly Sims]] as Stephanie, Carl's ex-wife\n* [[Aaron Takahashi]] as Lee\n* [[Sean O'Bryan]] as Ted\n* [[Spencer Garrett]] as Multack\n* [[Rocky Carroll]] as Wes\n* [[Vivian Bang]] as Soo-Mi\n* [[Jarrad Paul]] as Reggie\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Jumper\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as Homeless Guy\n* [[Maile Flanagan]] as Janet\n* [[Danny Wallace (humourist)|Danny Wallace]] as Conventioner (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Yes Man'' is based on a memoir of the same name by humourist [[Danny Wallace (humorist)|Danny Wallace]].

Wallace also has a cameo in the film, in the final bar-scene of the movie, in which he is speaking to someone behind [[Danny Masterson]].<ref name=\"digitalspy\">{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/a138060/video-ds-at-the-yes-man-premiere.html |title=Video: DS at the 'Yes Man' premiere |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |date=December 10, 2008 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |access-date=December 10, 2020 }}<!-- note: as of 2020 the video content appears to be dead --></ref>\n\nJim Carrey declined an upfront salary for his role in the film.
