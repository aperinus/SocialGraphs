Romero]]. It stars Lane Carroll, [[Will McMillan]], and Harold Wayne Jones as residents of a small American town that accidentally become afflicted by a military [[biological weapon]]. Filmed in Evans City in Western Pennsylvania, ''The Crazies'' was a box office failure upon release, but has since become a [[cult film]]. A [[The Crazies (2010 film)|remake]] of the film was released in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Evans City, Pennsylvania]], a man kills his wife and burns down his farmhouse. [[Firefighters]] David and Clank \u2014 both [[Vietnam War]] veterans \u2014 are called to the scene. David's pregnant girlfriend, a nurse named Judy, is called to the office of Dr. Brookmyre, where the two children of the arsonist are being treated for burns.\n\nHeavily armed U.S. troops led by Major Ryder take over Dr. Brookmyre's office. Days earlier, an Army plane carrying a bioweapon had crash-landed near the town, infecting the water supply with a virus code-named \"Trixie\" which is highly contagious and causes victims to either die or become hysterical and homicidally insane.\n\nGovernment officials send Colonel Peckem and Dr. Watts, who worked on the creation of the virus, to Evans City to contain the virus and work towards a cure. [[Martial law]] is declared in Evans City and a [[quarantine]] is placed on the town. Army soldiers forcibly move the townspeople into a high school, rousting many from their homes, and shoot anyone attempting to escape. [[Bombers]] armed with [[nuclear weapon]]s are dispatched to destroy the town if necessary.\n\nDavid, Judy, Clank, teenager Kathy Fulton and her father Artie, try to find a way to escape the town. After spending the night hiding in a [[country club]], the group attempts to escape through the nearby woods, eluding soldiers both on the ground and in an overhead helicopter. They overpower several soldiers in a house. One of the soldiers discloses what he knows about the virus to David, but when one of the soldiers reaches for his gun, Clank opens fire and kills the soldiers. David confides Judy about what he knows about the virus and tells her that Kathy, Artie, and probably Clank are infected.\n\nAfter Clank beats him for attempting to have sex with Kathy, Artie hangs himself. Kathy wanders outside and is killed by soldiers. Realizing he is infected, Clank kills several soldiers to give David and Judy time to escape. He is then shot and killed. The next night, Judy, now visibly infected, is killed by armed civilians. Angry and frightened, David surrenders to the military. After being taken into custody, David eventually realizes that he is immune to the virus, but he keeps the knowledge to himself.\n\nDr. Watts develops a potential cure for the virus but when he tries to take samples to Peckem and Ryder, he is killed and the samples are destroyed in a stampede of infected townspeople breaking free from quarantine. Depressed and distraught by his experiences in Evans City, Colonel Peckem is ordered to relocate to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], where symptoms of the virus have been reported.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* Lane Carroll as Judy\n* [[Will McMillan]] as David\n* Harold Wayne Jones as Clank\n* Lloyd Hollar as Colonel Peckem\n* [[Lynn Lowry]] as Kathy\n* [[Richard Liberty]] as Artie\n* [[Richard France (writer)|Richard France]] as Dr. Watts\n* Harry Spillman as Major Ryder\n* Will Disney as Dr. Brookmyre\n* Edith Bell as Lab Technician \n* Leland Starnes as Shelby\n* Bill Thunhurst as Brubaker\n* A.C.

Romero revealed that the military subplot was only featured in the first act of the script, and the rest of the film focused on the survivors and their attempts to cope with what was happening. The director called McCollough's script \"very existential and heady\".\n\nThe screenplay was read by Lee Hessel, a producer who owned Cambist Films and with whom Romero had previously worked on ''[[There's Always Vanilla]]''.<ref name=\"kane100\"/> Hessel expressed interest in it and offered to finance it as Romero's next film, but only if the director would be willing to rewrite McCollough's screenplay to focus on what Hessel considered the most interesting ingredient of the story, namely the military takeover of the town, which occurred in the first 10 to 20 pages. Romero agreed and rewrote the script, and he was given a budget of approximately $270,000.<ref name=\"kane100\"/>\n\nThe film was shot in and around [[Evans City, Pennsylvania|Evans City]] and [[Zelienople, Pennsylvania|Zelienople]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Tiech|first=John|title=Pittsburgh Film History: On Set in the Steel City|publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]]|page=25|year=2012|ISBN=9781614235897}}</ref> both small towns in [[Pennsylvania]] about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh. Romero has spoken of how the majority of people in the towns were very cooperative and happy to help with the production.\n\nOn February 23, 2010, the film was released on [[Blu-ray]] by [[Blue Underground]], the same company who first issued a DVD release on April 29, 2003. It was later re-released with a new 4K restoration by [[Arrow Video]] as part of a boxset entitled George A. Romero: Between Night and Dawn. It was later released separately on March 13, 2018.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film did not have a wide release, instead playing in a limited number of theaters before opening in a different market.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dornellas|first=Jonathan|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/19300|title=Special Article: Year of 'The Crazies': 1973|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=March 1, 2010|access-date=August 30, 2020}}</ref> Romero later claimed he felt that the major reason ''The Crazies'' failed at the box office was due to poor distribution. He stated that Hessel made a true attempt to adequately market the film, including releasing it under a variety of titles in different parts of the country, but that it never managed to catch the public's eye.\n\n===Critical reception===\n{{expand section|date=April 2016}}\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Crazies'' holds an approval rating of 65% with an average rating of 5.44/10, based on 23 reviews.
