The film was directed by [[Steve Carr]] and written by James and [[Nick Bakay]]. The film tells a story of Blart, a single dad and bumbling mall [[security guard]], who finds himself in the middle of a heist and the only one in position to rescue hostages.\n\nFilming began in February 2008 with a majority of the shooting taking place at the [[Burlington Mall (Massachusetts)|Burlington Mall]] in [[Burlington, Massachusetts]]. ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop'' opened in the United States on January 16, 2009, and was distributed by [[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Releasing]]. The film was poorly received by critics but grossed $183.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $26 million. A sequel titled ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2]]'' was released in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\nPaul Blart lives in [[West Orange, New Jersey]] with his teenage daughter Maya and his mother. Aspiring to join the [[New Jersey State Police]], he trains at the police academy, but his [[hypoglycemia]] causes him to collapse before finishing the exam. Blart works as a security guard at the West Orange Pavilion Mall.\n\nBlart patrols the mall on a [[Segway PT|Segway]] and begins training Veck Simms, a new hire who shows little interest in the job. Meanwhile, Blart becomes acquainted with Amy Anderson, a vendor of a new kiosk. Paul meets her one evening at a restaurant with other mall employees. Things initially go well, but when Blart participates in a [[nacho]]-eating contest with his friend Leon, the jalape\u00f1o peppers are too spicy for him and he chugs two glasses of margarita, mistaking it for lemonade. He gets drunk and makes a wild exit by falling through a window.\n\nTwo days later on the night of [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], an organized gang of thugs disguised as Santa's Village employees begin a heist inside the mall. They take Amy and others inside a bank hostage, and Simms is revealed as the gang\u2019s leader. The crew force the majority of shoppers to exit the mall and place motion sensors at each entrance to detect any attempt to enter or exit the building.\n\nBlart is oblivious as he plays ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' before walking back into the mall to discover that it is nearly empty. He calls the police and plans to leave the mall, but he realizes that Amy is still inside and returns to the mall to look for her. A [[SWAT]] team arrives with commander James Kent at the helm. Kent, a former classmate and bully from Blart's childhood, takes control of the police units and orders Blart to let them handle the situation. Blart refuses and attempts a rescue. Vastly outnumbered, he takes a stand against Simms' crew, improvising to take them down one by one. He discovers credit-card codes written in [[invisible ink]] on the burglars' arms, realizing that their plans go beyond robbing the bank.\n\nMaya, unaware of what is happening, shows up at the mall to bring Blart some food, but Simms' henchmen seize her and add her to the hostages. Blart manages to subdue all of Simms' accomplices and attempts to rescue the hostages by pulling them up into the air vent. The plan fails when Leon does not fit. Simms enters the room, capturing Blart and forcing him to give up the credit card codes recorded on his cell phone. Simms flees, taking Amy and Maya with him. As the SWAT team raids the mall, Blart borrows a display minivan with Kent, pursuing Simms to the airport, where he is attempting to escape to the [[Cayman Islands]].\n\nAfter a brief scuffle, Blart overpowers Simms and puts him in handcuffs. Moments later, however, Kent pulls his gun on Blart, revealing that he was working with Simms. Kent demands the phone containing the codes from Blart, who refuses and destroys the phone. Before Kent can retaliate by shooting Blart, Chief Brooks of the mall security team arrives and shoots Kent in the arm. Kent and Simms are arrested, and Amy and Maya are returned safely. For his bravery and assistance, Howard offers Blart a job with the New Jersey State Police. Blart declines, preferring to remain in mall security. Blart and Amy are eventually married in the mall, where they exchange vows on a set of black and white Segways.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kevin James]] as Paul Blart\n* [[Jayma Mays]] as Amy Anderson\n* [[Keir O'Donnell]] as Veck Simms\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Commander James Kent\n* [[Adam Ferrara]] as Sergeant Howard\n* [[Peter Gerety]] as Chief Brooks\n* [[Stephen Rannazzisi]] as Stuart\n* [[Jamal Mixon]] as Leon\n* [[Adhir Kalyan]] as Pahud\n* [[Erick Avari]] as Vijay\n* [[Raini Rodriguez]] as Maya Blart\n* [[Shirley Knight]] as Margaret Blart\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Jerky security guy\n* [[Gary Valentine]] as Karaoke singer\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Kevin-james-at-set-burlington-mall.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Airport scenes were filmed at LG Hanscom Field, [[Bedford, Massachusetts]] on the set of ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop'' in Burlington, Massachusetts.]]\nProduction began in late February 2008 in [[Boston]].<ref>[http://news.bostonherald.com/track/star_tracks/view.bg?articleid=1078649&srvc=home&position=also A Mall Cop by any other name] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709045710/http://news.bostonherald.com/track/star_tracks/view.bg?articleid=1078649&srvc=home&position=also |date=2009-07-09 }}, accessed March 18, 2008</ref> [[Principal photography]] took place at the [[Burlington Mall (Massachusetts)|Burlington Mall]] in [[Burlington, Massachusetts]] after being denied a permit from [[Willowbrook Mall (Wayne, New Jersey)|Willowbrook Mall]] in [[Wayne, New Jersey]].
