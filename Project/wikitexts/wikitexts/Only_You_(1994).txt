Written by [[Diane Drake]] and [[Malia Scotch Marmo]] (uncredited), the film is about a young woman whose search for the man she believes to be her soulmate leads her to Italy where she meets her destiny. Upon its release the film received mixed reviews, but critics praised Tomei and Downey's performances.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter playing with a [[Ouija]] board with her brother Larry, 11-year-old Faith Corvatch becomes convinced that her soul mate, the man she is destined to be with, is named \"Damon Bradley.\" This belief is strengthened when a few years later a carnival fortune-teller tells her that \"Damon Bradley\" is the name of the man she will marry.\n\nFourteen years later, Faith is a teacher at a Catholic school and is engaged to a [[podiatrist]]. Ten days before the wedding, Faith learns that her fianc\u00e9's high-school classmate, Damon Bradley, is flying to [[Venice]] that day. Determined to meet him, Faith follows his trail with her sister-in-law, Kate, from [[Pittsburgh]] through Venice and the Italian countryside to a street-side restaurant in [[Rome]], but they keep missing him.\n\nFaith meets a young American, but has no interest until he identifies himself as Damon Bradley. They spend a romantic evening together and fall hopelessly in love. Then he reveals that his actual name is Peter Wright, so she angrily leaves him and prepares to fly back home. Meanwhile, a suave Italian businessman named Giovanni has been wooing Kate.\n\nThe next morning Peter tells Faith he searched for Damon overnight, discovering he has moved on to [[Positano]]. Giovanni offers to drive the three Americans there. At a posh hotel, Faith meets Damon, a good-looking playboy, and invites him to dinner. Peter spies on them until Damon makes unwelcome sexual advances on Faith. It turns out that this \"Damon\" really is a friend of Peter's who has helped stage the entire scene.\n\nBack in the United States, Larry finds out that his wife, Kate, is in Italy. He travels there to find her while Kate and Faith are again planning to return home. Larry arrives in time to make up with Kate. He also reveals to her that he intentionally spelled out the name \"Damon Bradley\" on the Ouija board as a prank, and then paid the fortune-teller to tell Faith that her true love had the same name. He hadn't told her the truth because he feared she would never speak to him again.\n\nFaith and Peter are at the airport when they hear Damon Bradley paged. At the information desk they finally meet Damon. Peter tells him why Faith has been following him, and also that he (Peter) is in love with her, then boards his flight home to Boston. Damon asks Faith if she loves Peter. She realizes that she does and rushes to join him on his plane. The airport staff delays the flight until she can board. She and Peter embrace and kiss as the passengers and crew applaud.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Faith Corvatch\n**Tammy Minoff as Young Faith Corvatch\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Peter Wright\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Kate Corvatch\n**Jessica Hertel as Young Kate Corvatch\n* [[Joaquim de Almeida]] as Giovanni\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Larry Corvatch\n**Harry Barandes as Young Larry Corvatch\n* [[Billy Zane]] as Harry / Fake Damon Bradley\n* [[Siobhan Fallon Hogan|Siobhan Fallon]] as Leslie\n* [[John Benjamin Hickey]] as Dwayne, Faith's Fianc\u00e9\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Damon Bradley\n* [[Barbara Cupisti]] as Anna\n* Antonia Rey as Fortune Teller\n* [[Phyllis Newman]] as Faith's Mother\n* Denise Du Maurier as Dwayne's Mother\n* Dina Morrone as Shoe Show Announcer<ref>{{cite web |title=Full cast and crew for Only You |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110737/fullcredits#cast |access-date=March 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716010221/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110737/fullcredits#cast |archive-date=July 16, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=May 2021}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming locations===\n* Chicago Studio City, 5660 W.

In his review in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it \"an endangered species in today's Hollywood.\" \n{{blockquote|It is total fantasy, light as a feather, contrary to all notions of common sense, it features a couple of stars who are really good kissers\u2014and it takes place mostly in Venice, Rome, and the glorious Italian hillside town of Positano. What more do you want? Movies like this were once written for Katharine Hepburn (''Summertime''), Audrey Hepburn (''Roman Holiday'') and Rossano Brazzi (''Three Coins in the Fountain''). Or remember Clark Gable and Sophia Loren in ''It Happened in Naples''? There is a case to be made that no modern actors have quite the innocence or the faith to play such heedless lovers, but Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. somehow manage to lose all the baggage of our realistic, cynical age, and give us a couple of fools in love.<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news  |date= October 7, 1994 |last= Ebert |first= Roger |author-link= Roger Ebert |title= Only You |newspaper= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/only-you-1994 |access-date= March 2, 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070430130723/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19941007%2FREVIEWS%2F410070302%2F1023 |archive-date=April 30, 2007 |url-status= live }}</ref>}}\nEbert singles out Tomei's performance as particularly noteworthy. \n{{blockquote|I can think of many angst-laden young Hollywood stars, many of them accomplished actors, who could not have come within miles of the work done by Downey and Tomei in this movie. There is craft involved, yes, and even a certain inspiration, but what I reacted to more strongly was an ineffable sense of good nature: Tomei and Downey seem happy in their being here, and happier together than apart.

Maslin was even less impressed with Tomei's performance, calling her \"the least convincing actress ever to pretend to teach school.\" Maslin acknowledged Sven Nykvist's \"picturesque\" cinematography, Milena Canonero's \"slinky, glamorous costumes\", and Diane Drake's \"rather sweet\" screenplay.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news |last= Maslin |first= Janet |author-link= Janet Maslin |title=Only You (1994): Mr. Wright Is Mr. Right.

Puccio wrote, \"What every good romantic comedy demands are two beautiful people, usually of opposite sexes, beautiful scenery, beautiful music, and beautifully written situations. Never mind that director Norman Jewison's previous hit comedy, ''Moonstruck'', didn't quite fit the mold. ''Only You'' does.\" Puccio called the film \"one of the most charming films to come along since, well, since ''Moonstruck''. On DVD it is beautiful just to look at. ...
