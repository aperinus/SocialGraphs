The film also stars [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Mark Duplass]], [[Nat Faxon]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Sandra Oh]], with [[Dan Aykroyd]], and [[Kathy Bates]]. The film tells the story of a woman named Tammy who hits the road with her profane, alcoholic grandmother after finding out her husband is cheating. ''Tammy'' was released in theaters on July 2, 2014.<ref name=\"release\"/>\n\nAlthough a box office success, grossing $100.3 million from a $20 million budget, it received highly negative reviews from critics with McCarthy and Sarandon receiving [[34th Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie nominations]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress|Worst Supporting Actress]] respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Murphysboro, Illinois]], Tammy Banks strikes a deer on the way to her job at the fast food restaurant Topper Jack's, damaging her vehicle; when she arrives, her supervisor, Keith Morgan, is forced to [[dismissal (employment)|dismiss]] her from the restaurant. After her car breaks down on the way home on [[Illinois Route 13]], she walks home to find her husband, Greg, eating a romantic meal with their neighbor, Missi. Tammy leaves in frustration and walks two doors down to her parents' house.\n\nShe tells her mother, Deb, about her plans to leave and takes her grandmother Pearl's [[Cadillac DeVille]]. Pearl requests to come along. Tammy initially refuses but ultimately agrees when Pearl proves that she has a large sum of cash. Tammy has beer with Pearl, and the next morning they wake up near a park where Pearl convinces Tammy not to go back home. Pearl wants to go to [[Niagara Falls]] with Tammy since she hadn't gone as a child. Along the way the two stop in a bar in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Tammy meets Earl Tillman and his son Bobby, and Earl hooks up with Pearl. Tammy and Bobby begin to make a love connection as Pearl and Earl drunkenly make out in the car. Bobby gives Tammy his number to call him so he can pick up Earl. Back at the hotel, Tammy is forced to sleep outside. The next morning, Bobby picks up Earl, and the two leave. Tammy, infuriated with Pearl, leaves her, but returns after feeling guilty. Tammy and Pearl are arrested after Pearl gets caught buying a case of beer for two teenagers as well as shoplifting a pint of whiskey for herself. Tammy is released, but Pearl stays at the jail for possessing illegal prescription drugs.\n\nTo bail out Pearl, Tammy robs a Topper Jack's, where she converses with employees Becky ([[Sarah Baker (actress)|Sarah Baker]]) and Larry (Rich Williams). Finally having obtained the money, she rushes to the prison to bail Pearl out, but Bobby has already bailed her out. With the help of Pearl's wealthy lesbian cousin Lenore, they destroy the car to hide the evidence from the robbery. The two then stay at the home of Lenore and her wife, Susanne. At a [[4th of July]] party thrown at the house, Pearl gets drunk and humiliates Tammy by making rude comments about her weight and appearance in front of all the guests. After Tammy runs off to the dock on the lake by the house, Lenore follows her with both comfort and some [[tough love]].\n\nTammy brings coffee to Pearl, who is presumably asleep outside. After repeatedly trying to wake her, Pearl does not wake up and Tammy assumes she is dead. She, Lenore, and Susanne grieve Pearl's death, but Pearl suddenly awakens, much to everyone's shock. Pearl was actually unconscious due to the large amount of alcohol she drank the previous night. Tammy is relieved, and she tearfully demands Pearl to get help for her drinking problem. The ambulance arrives and takes Pearl to the hospital. The police arrive as well, and Tammy is arrested for her robbery of Topper Jack's.\n\nTammy is released from prison 38 days later, and her father, Don, picks her up. He offers to kill Greg for her, though she declines. Returning home, Tammy finds that Greg and Missi have packed Tammy's belongings. She and Greg agree to an amicable divorce. She walks down the street to her parents' place and finds out that Pearl is now living in Brookview Retirement Home. Tammy goes to Brookview to break her out, but Pearl is actually happy there. She has been attending [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings at the home, and she is dating one of the men there. However, they do still take a trip to Niagara Falls.\n\nAt Niagara Falls, Bobby surprises Tammy there and they kiss. Tammy tells him about her choice to move to Louisville to get a fresh start in life and get closer to him. Missi leaves Greg to be with Keith and Tammy befriends Becky and Larry.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Tammy Banks, the titular character\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Pearl Balzen, Deb's mother, Don\u2019s mother-in-law and Tammy's grandmother\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Lenore, Pearl's cousin\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Deb, Tammy's mother\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Don, Tammy's father\n* [[Mark Duplass]] as Bobby Tillman, Tammy's love interest\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Earl Tillman, Bobby's father and Pearl's love interest\n* [[Nat Faxon]] as Greg Banks, Tammy's husband\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Missi Jenkins, Tammy and Greg's neighbor and Greg's love interest\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Susanne, Lenore's wife\n* [[Ben Falcone]] as Keith Morgan, Tammy's supervisor at a local Topper Jack's Fast Food \n* [[Sarah Baker (actress)|Sarah Baker]] as Becky, an employee at the Topper Jack's, where Tammy commits a robbery\n* Rich Williams as Larry, an employee at the Topper Jack's, where Tammy commits a robbery\n* [[Mark L.

But eventually the film does manage to find its own awkward way, with enough effective and less desperate jokes to smooth things over after the rocky start. It's a shakier debut of McCarthy and Falcone's efforts behind the camera than one might have hoped for, but if Tammy can turn things around, surely they can too.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/07/03/327657802/melissa-mccarthy-an-unstoppable-force-imperfectly-deployed-in-tammy|title=Melissa McCarthy, An Unstoppable Force Imperfectly Deployed In 'Tammy'|first=Ian|last=Buckwalter|work=[[NPR]]|date=July 3, 2014|access-date=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Eden Caceda of ''[[Filmink]]'' gave a negative review, saying, \"McCarthy plays the same foul-mouthed and distasteful character she\u2019s played in just about every movie since Bridesmaids.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmink.com.au/reviews/tammy-film/|title=Tammy review|first=Eden|last=Caceda|work=[[Filmink]]|date=August 14, 2014|access-date=July 6, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927152845/http://www.filmink.com.au/reviews/tammy-film/|archive-date=September 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
