Adapted from [[Ron Hansen (novelist)|Ron Hansen]]'s [[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (novel)|1983 novel of the same title]], the film dramatizes the relationship between Jesse James and [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Robert Ford]] ([[Casey Affleck]]), focusing on the events that lead up to the titular killing.\n\nPhotography started at August 29, 2005 and ended in December 2005. Filming took place near [[Calgary]], [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]], and [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. To achieve the visual style he wanted for the movie, Dominik took influences from many sources, including still photographers, images clipped from magazines, stills from ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', and even [[Instant film|Polaroids]]. The original edit of the movie was envisioned by Dominik to be \"a dark, contemplative examination of fame and infamy\", reaching more than three hours in runtime. This was opposed by the studio and the film was edited repeatedly.\n\nInitially intended for a 2006 release, it was postponed and re-edited for a September 21, 2007, release date. Before it released to theatres, it had its world premiere at the [[64th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 2, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venice-pitt-idUSL0269302420070902|title=Pitt plays Jesse James as outlaw who saw end coming|newspaper=Reuters|date=2 September 2007|access-date=25 June 2020|via=www.reuters.com|last1=Collett-White|first1=Mike}}</ref> Although a [[box-office bomb]], the film received positive reviews from the critics, with Pitt and Affleck's performances receiving widespread acclaim. It received two nominations at the [[80th Academy Awards]]; [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (for Affleck). It has since gained a large [[Cult following|fan following]] with many of them organizing re-releases of the film under the \"Jesse James Revival\" banner.<ref>{{Cite web|title=THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES Returning to the Big Screen for New York's Museum of Moving Image; Revival Campaign Launched|url=https://collider.com/assassination-of-jesse-james-revival-campaign-screening/|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|date=2013-10-18|website=Collider|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1881, young starstruck [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Robert \"Bob\" Ford]] seeks out [[Jesse James]] when the [[James-Younger Gang|James Gang]] is planning a [[train robbery]] in Blue Cut, Missouri, making unsuccessful attempts to join the gang with the help of his older brother [[Charley Ford|Charley]], already a member. The train turns out to be carrying only a fraction of the money originally thought, and a dispirited [[Frank James]] leaves the gang and his brother.  Jesse returns home to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], bringing the Fords, [[Dick Liddil]] and Jesse's cousin, [[Wood Hite]]. Jesse sends Charley, Wood, and Dick away, but insists that Bob stay for his help in moving furniture to a [[Jesse James Home Museum|new home]] in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]]. Bob becomes more admiring of Jesse before being sent away. He stays at the farmhouse of his widowed sister, Martha Bolton, where he rejoins his brother Charley, Hite, and Liddil.\n\nLiddil reveals to Bob that he is in collusion with another member of the James gang, [[James Robert Cummins|Jim Cummins]], to capture Jesse for a substantial [[bounty (reward)|bounty]]. Meanwhile, Jesse visits another gang member, [[Edward T. Miller (outlaw)|Ed Miller]], who gives away information on Cummins' plot. Jesse kills Miller, then departs with Liddil to hunt down Cummins. Unable to locate him, Jesse viciously beats Albert Ford, a young cousin of Bob and Charley who had hosted him. Later, Liddil stays with Hite at Hite's father's house, where he has sex with Hite's young stepmother. Upon learning of this, Hite tracks Liddil down to Bolton's and holds him at gunpoint, but Bob intervenes, fatally shooting Hite. They dump his body in the woods to conceal the murder from Jesse.\n\nJesse appears at the Boltons' for dinner, where the Fords deny having seen Liddil recently. At dinner, Jesse mocks Bob for his idolization of him, leading Bob to become less enchanted with and more resentful of Jesse, especially after hearing of what was done to his cousin. Jesse and Charley travel to St. Joseph where Jesse learns of Hite's disappearance, about which Charley denies knowing anything. Meanwhile, Bob goes to Kansas City [[Police Commissioner]] Henry Craig, saying he knows Jesse' whereabouts. To prove his allegiance with the James Gang, Bob urges Craig to arrest Dick Liddil. Following Liddil's arrest and confession to participation in numerous gang robberies, Bob brokers a deal with the [[Governor of Missouri]], [[Thomas Theodore Crittenden|Thomas T. Crittenden]]. He is given ten days to capture or kill Jesse and is promised a substantial bounty and full pardon for murder.\n\nCharley persuades Jesse to take Bob into the gang; the brothers return to St. Joseph. Introduced as cousins to Jesse's wife and two children, they stay with the family. Jesse wants to revive his gang by robberies with the Fords, beginning with the [[Platte City]] bank. During their stay, Jesse becomes increasingly suspicious of the brothers, not allowing them to be alone together. However, as the stay passes uneventfully, he later gives Bob a gun as a token of apology. On the morning of April 3, 1882, as Jesse and the Ford brothers prepare to depart for the robbery, Jesse reads in the newspaper about the arrest and confessions of Liddil. While the three men are in the living room, Jesse removes his gun belt and climbs a chair to clean a dusty picture. Bob shoots Jesse in the back of the head with the gun given to him. He flees with Charley. They send a [[telegram]] to the governor to announce Jesse's death, for which they were to receive $10,000. However, they never receive more than $500 each.\n\nAfter the killing, the Fords hope to become celebrities, touring with a theatre show in [[Manhattan]] in which they re-enact the shooting, but people soon gradually become hostile towards the pair, hailing Jesse as a legend and calling Bob a \"coward.\"  Guilt-stricken, Charley writes numerous letters to Zee James asking for her forgiveness, but he does not send them. Suffering from terminal [[tuberculosis]], he commits suicide in May 1884. Bob works around the West as a saloon owner, becoming increasingly regretful of his past actions. On June 8, 1892, Bob is murdered by [[Edward Capehart O'Kelley|Edward O'Kelley]] at his saloon in [[Creede, Colorado]]. O'Kelley is sentenced to life in prison, but he is pardoned after ten years in 1902.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Jesse James]]\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Robert Ford]]\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as [[Frank James]]\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Wood Hite]]\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[Charles Ford (outlaw)|Charley Ford]]\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as [[Dick Liddil]]\n* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as [[Zerelda Mimms|Zerelda James]]\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Dorothy Evans\n* [[Garret Dillahunt]] as [[Edward T.

The studio opposed Dominik's approach, preferring less contemplation and more action. One version of the film had a running time of more than three hours. Producers Pitt and [[Ridley Scott]] and editors [[Dylan Tichenor]] and [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]] collaborated to assemble and test different versions. Tichenor left the production early to cut ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'' and was replaced by editor Curtis Clayton, who ultimately finished the production. Kahn was brought in for several weeks as the studio's \"go to\" editor. The test versions did not receive strong scores from test audiences.

Notice the color aberration around the edges, imitating the look of old photographs.]]\nOne of the most well-known sequences of the film is the scene of a train robbery at night time. Cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]] used various cinematographic techniques to give the train more of a presence when it was in pitch darkness. The idea was to generate a sense of foreboding atmosphere by using only the lanterns held up by the outlaws and the 5K [[Parabolic aluminized reflector light|PAR light]] mounted on the front of the train<ref name=\"deakins\">[http://www.theasc.com/ac_magazine/October2007/QAWithDeakins/page2.php \"Q&A with Roger Deakins\"], AC Magazine, October 2007</ref> In order to enhance the blacks, Deakins did a slight [[bleach bypass]] on the negative, which was especially important in terms of rendering detail.<ref name=\"deakins\"/>\n\nSome scenes in the film have a blurred effect around the borders of the frame. These were achieved by taking old wide-angle lenses and mounting them onto the front of several cameras (Arri Macros in this case). Deakins claimed to have pioneered this technique, naming these combinations of lenses \"Deakinizers\", which created the effect of [[vignetting]] and a slight [[chromatic aberration|color aberration]] around the edges. Deakins recalls:\n\n{{blockquote|Most of those shots were used for transitional moments, and the idea was to create the feeling of an old-time camera. We weren't trying to be nostalgic, but we wanted those shots to be evocative. The idea sprang from an old photograph Andrew [Dominik] liked, and we did a lot of tests to mimic the look of the photo. Andrew had a whole lot of photographic references for the look of the movie, mainly the work of still photographers, but also images clipped from magazines, stills from ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', and even [[Instant film|Polaroids]] taken on location that looked interesting or unusual. He hung all of them up in the long corridor of the production office. That was a wonderful idea, because every day we'd all pass by [images] that immediately conveyed the tone of the movie he wanted to make.<ref name=\"deakins\"/>}}\n\nSeveral [[time-lapse]] sequences appear throughout the film, which were shot by [[Steadicam]] operator Damon Moreau. According to Moreau, he was sent to do such shots when the crew was not quite ready to shoot a scene. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} These time-lapse sequences were often accompanied by the film's melancholic score, suggesting the passage of time and contributing to the unease that builds up to the inevitable yet unsettling climax.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Further|The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (soundtrack)}}\nThe music for the film was composed by [[Australia]]n musicians [[Nick Cave]] and [[Warren Ellis (musician)|Warren Ellis]] who had collaborated previously to create the award-winning score for the Australian film ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005).<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Cave, Warren Ellis \u2013 Music From The Motion Picture - The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford|url=http://www.discogs.com/Nick-Cave-Warren-Ellis-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture-The-Assassination-Of-Jesse-James-By-The-Coward-/release/1141894|access-date=29 July 2012|work=Discogs|publisher=Discogs}}</ref>\n\nNick Cave had a minor part in the latter part of the film.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/nick-cave-and-warren-ellis-the-assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford-ost |title=Nick Cave And Warren Ellis \u2013 The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford: OST |date=10 December 2017 |access-date=14 August 2019 |magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]}}</ref> He played a strolling balladeer in a crowded bar, where, unrecognized by the other patrons, Bob Ford had to listen to the lyrics of \"[[The Ballad of Jesse James]]\" as performed by Cave.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.screendaily.com/the-assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford/4034289.article |title=The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford |first=Lee |last=Marshall |date=3 September 2007 |access-date=14 August 2019 |magazine=[[Screen Daily]] |publisher=Media Business Insight Limited}}</ref> This folk song referred to Ford as a coward.\n\nCave and Ellis released a double disc album titled ''White Lunar'' in September 2009, which contains several tracks from the ''Jesse James'' score, as well as tracks they composed for other films up to 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickcaveandwarrenellis.com/works/white-lunar-2009 |title=Nick Cave & Warren Ellis ~ White Lunar (2009) |publisher=Nickcaveandwarrenellis.com |date=2009-09-21 |access-date=2011-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'' was originally slated a release date for September 15, 2006.<ref>{{cite news |author=Stax |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/710/710606p1.html |title=Superman's New Date |publisher=IGN |date=2006-05-30 |access-date=2007-05-09 }}</ref> The release date was postponed to February 2007 at first,<ref>{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Williamson |author-link=Kevin D.
