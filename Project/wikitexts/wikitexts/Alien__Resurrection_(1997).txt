The United Systems Military (USM) hopes to breed Aliens to study and research on the spaceship USM ''Auriga'', using human hosts abducted and delivered to them by a group of [[mercenaries]].

Sigourney Weaver was not interested in this setting, but has remained open to reprising her role as Ellen Ripley for a fifth installment, on the condition that she likes the story.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Breznican | first=Anthony | date=July 13, 2016 | title=Sigourney Weaver reveals more details of Neill Blomkamp's Aliens sequel | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | url=http://ew.com/article/2016/07/13/sigourney-weaver-aliens-sequel-neill-blomkamp/ | access-date=July 27, 2017 | archive-date=June 20, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620202033/http://ew.com/article/2016/07/13/sigourney-weaver-aliens-sequel-neill-blomkamp/ | url-status=live }}</ref> More sequels were planned to follow ''Resurrection'', but were ultimately abandoned as the crossover series arrived with the 2004 film ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'', along with the [[Alien (franchise)#Prequel series|prequel series]] including the 2012 film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''. The storylines of ''Resurrection'' have been continued in the comic series ''[[Aliens versus Predator versus The Terminator]]'', and books ''[[Aliens: Original Sin]]'' and ''[[List of Alien (franchise) novels#Third novel series (2014\u2013present)|Alien: Sea of Sorrows]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n200 years after the events of ''[[Alien 3]]'', military scientists on the space vessel USM ''Auriga'' create a [[cloning|clone]] of [[Ellen Ripley]], designated Ripley 8, using [[DNA]] from blood samples taken before her death. The [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorph]] Queen's DNA has been combined with Ripley's, so the clone grows up with an [[embryo]] inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it, and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As a result of the Xenomorphs' DNA inside her, the clone has enhanced strength and reflexes, acidic blood, and a psychic link with the Xenomorphs. Additionally, the Xenomorph's [[genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memory]] allows the clone to have some of Ripley's memories.\n\nA group of [[mercenary|mercenaries]] consisting of Elgyn, Johner, Christie, Vriess, Hillard, and Call arrives at ''Auriga'' on their ship ''Betty'' and deliver several abducted humans in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]]. The military scientists use the humans as hosts for the aliens, raising several adult Xenomorphs for study.\n\nThe ''Betty'' crew soon encounters Ripley 8. Annalee Call recognizes her name and tries to kill her, suspecting that Ripley 8 may be used to create Xenomorphs, but the creatures have already been cloned. The mature Xenomorphs escape confinement by killing off one of their own to use its acidic blood to burn through their enclosures and capture Dr. Jonathan Gediman. They damage the ''Auriga'' and kill the majority of the crew who failed to evacuate, including General Perez and Elgyn. Military scientist Dr. Wren reveals that the ship's default command in an emergency is to return to Earth. Realizing that this will unleash the Xenomorphs on Earth, Ripley 8, the mercenaries, Wren, a soldier named DiStephano, and surviving Xenomorph host Purvis decide to head for the ''Betty'' and use it to destroy the ''Auriga''. Along the way, Ripley 8 discovers a laboratory containing the grotesque results of the previous seven failed attempts to clone Ellen Ripley. A surviving one begs Ripley 8 to euthanize her; she complies and then incinerates the lab.\n\nAs the group makes their way through the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two Xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the Xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the Xenomorph. After Wren betrays the group, Call is revealed to be an [[android (robot)|android]]. Using her ability to interface with the ''Auriga''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s systems, Call sets it on a [[collision course]] with Earth, hoping to destroy the Xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the Xenomorphs toward him. Ripley 8 is captured by a Xenomorph, while the others head for the ''Betty''. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage, and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest as the Xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile Xenomorph.\n\nRipley is taken to the Alien nest, where she finds Gediman, alive and partially cocooned. The Alien Queen, having developed a [[uterus]] as a result of her genetic contamination with Ripley 8, gives birth to a Xenomorph with overtly human traits. Unable to bond with the Queen, the hybrid Xenomorph recognizes Ripley 8 as its mother, so it kills the Alien Queen and Gediman. Ripley 8 takes advantage of the distraction to escape and makes her way to the ''Betty''.\n\nThe newborn hybrid reaches the ship and attacks Call, killing DiStephano when he tries to help her. Ripley 8 finds her way onto the ship and saves Call by distracting the hybrid. Using her acidic blood, Ripley 8 melts a hole in a window and pushes the hybrid towards it. The decompression violently blows the creature through the hole and out into space as Ripley 8 tearfully watches on.\n\nThe countdown on the ''Auriga'' continues as the survivors escape in the ''Betty''. The ''Auriga'' collides with Earth, causing a large explosion. As they look down at Earth, Call asks what Ripley 8 wants to do next. \"I don't know. I'm a stranger here myself,\" she replies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Alien (film series) characters|l1=List of ''Alien'' (film series) characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Ellen Ripley]], reprising her role from the previous three ''Alien'' films.

Whedon's initial screenplay had a [[Three-act structure|third act]] on Earth, with a final battle for Earth itself.<ref name=\"gits09\">{{cite web| url= http://www.gointothestory.com/2009/01/interview-joss-whedon.html | title= Interview: Joss Whedon |author=Scott Myers | date= January 3, 2009 | work=Go Into The Story | format=blog entry| access-date=2010-07-06 | quote=But rather than go into all of the reasons why ''Alien Resurrection'' is disappointing to me, I will tell you that, yes, I wrote five endings.

Whedon composed a thirty-page treatment surrounding this idea before being informed that the studio, though impressed with his script, now intended to base the story on a clone of Ripley, whom they saw as the anchor of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natoonline.org/infocus/05augustseptember/whedonuncut.htm |title=In Focus &#124; August/September 2005 &#124; Serenity Now!

The idea of cloning was suggested by producers [[David Giler]] and [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]], who opposed the production of ''Alien Resurrection'', as they thought it would ruin the franchise.<ref name=\"From the Ashes\">{{cite video|title=From the Ashes \u2013 Reviving the Story|location=''Alien Resurrection'', [[Alien Quadrilogy|Quadrilogy]] edition|date=2003|publisher=Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n[[Sigourney Weaver]], who had played Ripley throughout the series, wanted to liberate the character in ''Alien 3'' as she did not want Ripley to become \"a figure of fun\" who would continuously \"wake up with monsters running around\". The possibility of an ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]'' film was another reason for the character's death, as she thought the concept \"sounded awful\". However, Weaver was impressed with Whedon's script. She thought that the error during Ripley's cloning process would allow her to further explore the character, since Ripley becoming part-human and part-Alien would create uncertainty about where her loyalties lay. This was an interesting concept to Weaver, who thought the film brought back the spirit of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.<ref name=\"From the Ashes\"/> Weaver received a co-producer credit and was reportedly paid $11&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Beauties and the Beast\"/>\n\n===Direction and design===\n''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' director [[Danny Boyle]] was the producers' first choice to direct the film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, but he was not interested in pursuing the project and went on to make ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]'' instead. [[Peter Jackson]] was also approached, but declined as he could not get excited about an ''Alien'' film.<ref name=\"Peter Jackson FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Peter Jackson FAQ |author=Jackson, Peter |publisher=theonering.net |url=http://tbhl.theonering.net/peter/faq.html |access-date=2008-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225035055/http://tbhl.theonering.net/peter/faq.html |archive-date=2007-12-25 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1995, after the release of ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', [[20th Century Fox]] approached [[Bryan Singer]] to direct.<ref>[[Bryan Singer]], [[Tom DeSanto]], The Secret Origin of The ''X-Men'', 2000, [[20th Century Fox]]</ref> [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] was asked to direct, as the film's producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' and was surprised he was offered the job for ''Alien Resurrection'', as he thought the franchise had finished with ''Alien 3'' and believed that making a sequel was a bad idea.<ref name=\"French Twist\">{{Cite video|title=French Twist \u2013 Direction and Design|location=''Alien Resurrection'', [[Alien Quadrilogy|Quadrilogy]] edition|date=2003|publisher=Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref> Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Sigourney Weaver Eludes the Image Police\"/> He required an [[Language interpretation|interpreter]] as he did not speak much English when filming began.<ref name=\"audioc\">''Alien Resurrection'' \u2013 [[Audio Commentary]]</ref>\n\nJeunet hired French special effects supervisor [[Pitof]] and [[cinematographer]] [[Darius Khondji]], both of whom he had worked with on ''[[The City of Lost Children]]''. [[Nigel Phelps]] was chosen for [[production designer]], having made a name for himself designing [[Gotham City]] in [[Batman (1989 film)|''Batman'']] and [[Mega-City One]] in ''[[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|Judge Dredd]]''. Jeunet and his crew watched the latest science fiction and ''Alien'' films as reference material, and obtained production reports from the ''Alien'' films to study the camera setups. Jeunet was given creative control, contributing several elements to the script including five different endings, although the expensive ones were dismissed. He also opted to make the film a [[dark comedy]] and was encouraged to include more violence. In June 1996, Jeunet's frequent co-director, [[conceptual artist]] [[Marc Caro]] had drawn rough sketches of characters' costumes, which were shown to veteran costume designer [[Bob Ringwood]]. Ringwood made several modifications for the final design.<ref name=\"French Twist\"/>\n\n===Creatures===\n[[File:Alien- Resurrection - Newborn.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The original design of the human/Alien hybrid included a mix of female and male [[sex organ]]s, which were removed during post-production.]]\nSpecial effects company [[Amalgamated Dynamics]] Incorporated (ADI) was hired for the film, having previously worked on ''Alien 3''. ADI founders [[Tom Woodruff Jr.]] and Alec Gillis also had experience working with [[Stan Winston]] on ''Aliens''. ADI based their designs and modifications of the Alien creatures on the film's script, which included the creatures having pointed tails for swimming, making their head domes and chins more pointed, and establishing them to appear more vicious using techniques of camera angles and shot duration. After receiving the director's approval, ADI began to create small sculptures, sketches, paintings, and life-size models.<ref name=\"Mutation\">{{cite video|title=Unnatural Mutation \u2013 Creature Design|location=''Alien Resurrection'', [[Alien Quadrilogy|Quadrilogy]] edition|date=2003|publisher=Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref> Referring to the use of animatronics in the film, Twentieth Century Fox executive [[Tom Rothman]] stated, \"Most movies would be tempted to do the Newborn digitally ... [but] it looks so much more real when you [use] animatronics\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferrante|first=Anthony C.|date=January 1998|title=To Build a Better Alien|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_169_1998_Alien_Resurrection_HQS_c2c/page/n27?q=james+wong|journal=[[Fangoria]]|issue=169|pages=28\u201333, 82}}</ref>\n\nJeunet asked ADI to lean towards making the human/Alien [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] creature more human than Alien. An early concept was to replicate Sigourney Weaver's features, although the crew felt this design would be too similar to the design of the creature Sil from the 1995 film ''[[Species (film)|Species]]''. Eyes and a nose were added to the hybrid to allow it to have more expressions and communicate more emotion than the xenomorphs, so that it would have more depth as a character rather than being \"just a killing machine\".<ref name=\"Mutation\"/> Jeunet was adamant about the hybrid having [[Sex organ|genitalia]] which resembled a mix of male and female sexes. 20th Century Fox was uncomfortable with this, however, and Jeunet eventually changed his mind, feeling that \"even for a Frenchman, it's too much\".<ref name=\"Mutation\"/> The genitalia were removed during [[post-production]] using digital effects techniques. The animatronic hybrid required nine puppeteers and was the most complex animatronic in the film.<ref name=\"Mutation\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n''Alien Resurrection'' was filmed at Fox studios in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], from October 1996 to February 1997. Jeunet had difficulty securing studio space, as the filming of Hollywood blockbusters such as ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'', and ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' were taking place at the same time. ''Alien Resurrection'' was the first installment in the ''Alien'' series to be filmed outside England, a decision made by Weaver, who believed that the previous films' travel schedules exhausted the crew.<ref name=\"French Twist\"/>\n\nThe underwater scene was the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36-by-45-meter tank, 4.5&nbsp;meters deep, containing 548,000&nbsp;gallons of water.<ref name=\"Beauties and the Beast\">{{cite magazine\n |title=Beauties and the Beast\n |author=Hochman, David\n |magazine=Entertainment Weekly\n |date=1997-12-05\n |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,290562,00.html\n |access-date=2008-01-31\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106122006/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C290562%2C00.html\n |archive-date= 6 January 2008\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref> The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in [[San Diego]] would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would be able to use the tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two-and-a-half weeks of training took place at the studio with [[stunt coordinator]] Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. [[Winona Ryder]] faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had not been in the water since. She suggested using a [[body double]], but knew that it would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference in hair length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.<ref name=\"Filming\">{{cite video|title=Death From Below \u2013 Fox Studios Los Angeles 1996|location=''Alien Resurrection'', [[Alien Quadrilogy|Quadrilogy]] edition|date=2003|publisher=Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nDirector Jeunet wanted to display Ripley's new powers, including a scene in which Ripley throws a basketball through a hoop while facing the opposite direction. Weaver trained for ten days and averaged one out of six baskets, although the distance required for filming was farther than she had practiced. Jeunet was concerned about the time being spent on the shot and wanted to either use a machine to throw the ball or to insert it later using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). Weaver, however, was determined to make the shot authentic, and insisted on doing it herself. The shot required many dozens of takes, during which none of the balls went in. The crew were going to give up, but gave Weaver one last shot, and in this take, she got the ball in perfectly (the idea that she did it in one take is a myth). The ball was out of frame for a moment during the shot, and Pitof offered to edit it so that the ball was on-screen for the entire scene, but Weaver refused. [[Ron Perlman]] broke character when she made the basket, and turned to the camera to say \"Oh my god!\" There was enough of a pause between Weaver's basket and Perlman's statement for the film's editors to cut the scene accordingly during post-production.<ref name=\"BBall\">{{cite video|title=In the Zone \u2013 The Basketball Scene|location=''Alien Resurrection'', [[Alien Quadrilogy|Quadrilogy]] edition|date=2003|publisher=Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n===Visual effects and miniatures===\nThe film's script was laid out similar to a comic book, with pictures on the left and dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. [[Blue Sky Studios]] was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on ''[[Joe's Apartment]]'' creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.<ref name=\"CGI Aliens\">{{cite video|title=Virtual Aliens \u2013 Computer Generated Imagery|location=''Alien Resurrection'', [[Alien Quadrilogy|Quadrilogy]] edition|date=2003|publisher=Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nAll of the spaceships in the film were miniatures, as visual effects supervisors believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM ''Auriga'' was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the film's opening shot, in which the camera pans out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory in the film's 2.35:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and [[concept art]]ist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design was too much like a space station, while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.<ref name=\"Scale\">{{Cite video|title=A Matter of Scale \u2013 Miniature Photography|location=''Alien Resurrection'', [[Alien Quadrilogy|Quadrilogy]] edition|date=2003|publisher=Fox Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n[[Argonaut Games]], developer of the film's [[Alien Resurrection (video game)|tie-in video game]], was also tasked to create a game that would appear in the film titled ''Atom Zone''.

This included themes of romance and [[eroticism]], incorporating sound effects such as a gong and rub rod.
