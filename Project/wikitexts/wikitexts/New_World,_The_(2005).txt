It is the fourth feature film written and directed by Malick.\n\nThe cast includes [[Colin Farrell]], [[Q'orianka Kilcher]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Christian Bale]], [[August Schellenberg]], [[Wes Studi]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Yorick van Wageningen]] and [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]]. The production team includes director of photography [[Emmanuel Lubezki]], producer [[Sarah Green (film producer)|Sarah Green]], production designer [[Jack Fisk]], costume designer [[Jacqueline West]], composer [[James Horner]] and film editors [[Richard Chew]], [[Hank Corwin]], [[Saar Klein]] and Mark Yoshikawa.\n\n''The New World'' was a box-office failure even though it received many award nominations for Lubezki's cinematography, Kilcher's acting and Horner's score. The film was initially met with an only mildly positive critical response, although several critics later ranked it as one of the best films of the decade.\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[File:Pocahontas by Simon van de Passe (1616).png|thumb|[[Pocahontas]] by Simon van de Passe 1616]]\n\nIn 1607, [[Pocahontas]], the adventurous daughter of [[Chief Powhatan]], and others from her tribe witness the [[Jamestown Expedition|arrival of three ships]] sent by [[kingdom of England|English]] [[London Company|royal charter to found a colony]] in the [[New World]]. Aboard one ship is [[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]], sentenced to death for mutinous remarks, but once ashore pardoned by Captain [[Christopher Newport]], leader of the expedition.\n\nWhile the settlement's prospects are initially bright, disease, poor discipline, supply shortages, and tensions with local Native Americans, whom Newport calls \"the naturals\", jeopardize the expedition. Taking a small group upriver to seek trade while Newport returns to England for supplies, Smith is captured by Native Americans and brought before Chief Powhatan. After being questioned, the captain is nearly executed but spared when Pocahontas intervenes.\n\nLiving as the Native Americans\u2019 prisoner, Smith is treated well, earning the tribe's friendship and respect. Coming to admire this new way of life, he falls deeply in love with Pocahontas, who is intrigued by the Englishman and his ways. The chief returns Smith to Jamestown with the understanding that the English are to leave the following spring, once their boats return.\n\nSmith discovers the settlement in turmoil and is pressed into accepting the governorship, finding the peace he had with the Natives replaced by privation, death, and the difficulties of his new position. Smith wishes to return to Pocahontas but dismisses the idea, thinking of his time among the Native Americans as \"a dream\". The settlers dwindle throughout the brutal winter, and are saved only when Pocahontas and a rescue party arrive with food, clothing, and supplies.\n\nAs spring arrives, Powhatan realizes that the English do not intend to leave. Discovering his daughter's actions, he orders an attack on Jamestown and exiles Pocahontas. Repulsing the attack, the settlers learn of Pocahontas's banishment. The English sea captain [[Samuel Argall]] convinces them on a trading expedition up the [[Potomac River]] to abduct Pocahontas from the [[Patawomeck]]s as a prisoner in order to negotiate with her father in exchange for captive settlers, but not their stolen weapons and tools. Opposing this plan, Smith is removed as governor, but renews his love affair after Pocahontas is brought to Jamestown. Captain Newport returns, telling Smith of an offer from the king to lead his own expedition to find passage to the East Indies. Torn between his love and his career, Smith decides to return to England. Before departing, he leaves instructions with another settler, who later tells Pocahontas that Smith died in the crossing.\n\nDevastated, Pocahontas sinks into depression. Living in Jamestown, she is eventually comforted by a new settler, [[John Rolfe]], who helps her adapt to the English way of life. She is baptized, educated, and eventually married to Rolfe and gives birth to a son, [[Thomas Rolfe|Thomas]]. She later learns Captain Smith is still alive, news to which she has a violent reaction; she finds herself rejecting Rolfe and retreats to her loyalty to Smith, thinking fate spared his life and they are to be reunited. Rolfe and his family are given a chance to travel to England. Arriving in London and sharing an audience with the king and queen, Pocahontas is overwhelmed by the wonders of this \"New World.\"\n\nShe meets privately with Smith, who admits he may have made a mistake in choosing his career over Pocahontas. He says that what they experienced in Virginia was not a dream but instead \"the only truth\". Asked if he ever found his Indies, he replies, \"I may have sailed past them.\" They part, never to meet again. Realizing Rolfe is the man she thought he was and more, Pocahontas finally accepts him as her husband and love. The couple make arrangements to return to Virginia, but Pocahontas falls ill and dies near Gravesend. Rolfe still decides to return to Virginia with Thomas.\n\nThe film ends with images of the young adult Pocahontas and her young son happily playing in the gardens of their English estate. Rolfe, in a [[voice-over]], reads a letter addressed to their only son about his deceased Native American mother, who is heard to say, \"Mother, now I know where you live,\" with concluding images of nature in the New World.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[Colin Farrell]] as [[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]]\n*[[Q'orianka Kilcher]] as [[Pocahontas|Pocahontas (Matoaka, Rebecca Rolfe)]]\n*[[Christopher Plummer]] as [[Christopher Newport|Captain Christopher Newport]]\n*[[Christian Bale]] as [[John Rolfe]]\n*[[August Schellenberg]] as [[Chief Powhatan]] (Wahunsonacock)\n*[[Wes Studi]] as [[Opchanacanough|Opechancanough]]\n*[[David Thewlis]] as [[Edward Maria Wingfield|Edward Wingfield]]\n*[[Yorick van Wageningen]] as [[Samuel Argall]]\n*[[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Ben\n*[[Raoul Trujillo]] as [[Tomocomo]]\n*[[Br\u00edan F.

It was released for a week from Christmas to New Year's Day in two theaters each in Los Angeles and New York to qualify for the [[Academy Award]]s.\n\nFor the film's [[wide release]], which began on January 20, 2006, Malick re-edited the film, cutting it to 135 minutes, but also adding footage not seen in the first release. He altered some of the film's extensive voiceovers to clarify the plot.

[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' hailed the film as \"a masterpiece\", while others such as [[Ty Burr]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' gave positive reviews.\n\nOn the other hand, [[Stephen Hunter]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' faulted the film for being \"stately almost to the point of being static\", while [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' criticized it as \"sluggish\", \"underdramatized\", and \"emotionally remote\". While its release was timed for consideration for the awards season, it was nominated only for the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] for [[Emmanuel Lubezki]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]].\n\nIn November 2009, ''[[Time Out New York]]'' ranked the film as the fourth-best of the decade, saying:\n\n<blockquote>The particular power of this [[tone poem]] comes from how quietly resigned both characters are to their fates, as if they sense a guiding hand in their every action.

I have seen it at least five times and have no idea how Malick knew, when he put it all together, that the movie would even make sense. It's difficult to write a great short poem. It's difficult to write a great long novel. But to write a great long poem that's the size of a great long novel \u2013 one that makes sense, doesn't flag and is exponentially better than the short poem or the long novel ever would have been \u2013 that's almost impossible.

And that film is ''The New World'', Terrence Malick's American foundation myth, which arrived just as the decade reached its dismal halfway point, in January 2006. [...] ''The New World'' is a bottomless movie, almost unspeakably beautiful and formally harmonious. The movie came and went within a month, and its critical reception was characterised for the most part by bafflement, condescension, lazy ridicule and outright hostility.
