The film is a commentary on the desperate employment and financial conditions many people faced during the [[Great Depression]] \u2014 conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern [[industrialization]]. The movie stars Chaplin, [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Henry Bergman]], [[Tiny Sandford]] and [[Chester Conklin]]. It is notable for being the last time that Chaplin portrayed the Tramp character and for being the first time Chaplin's voice is heard on film.\n\nIn 1989, ''Modern Times'' was one of the first 25 films selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news| date=September 19, 1989| title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies| url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| location=[[Washington, D.C.]]| access-date=April 22, 2020| url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Complete National Film Registry Listing| url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/| website=Library of Congress| access-date=May 6, 2020}}</ref> In 2003, it was screened \"out of competition\" at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4075172/year/2003.html |title=Modern Times |access-date=November 8, 2009 |website=Festival de Cannes}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Chaplin - Modern Times.jpg|thumb|right|The Tramp working on the giant machine in the film's most famous scene]]\n[[File:Charlie Chaplin.jpg|thumb|269x269px|{{center|Charlie Chaplin as The Tramp}}]]\n[[The Tramp]] works on an [[assembly line]], where he suffers greatly due to the stress and pace of the repetitive work. He eventually suffers a nervous breakdown and runs amok, getting stuck within a machine and throwing the factory into chaos; he is then sent to the hospital. Following his recovery, the now unemployed Tramp is mistakenly arrested in a [[Communist]] demonstration. In jail, he accidentally ingests smuggled [[cocaine]], and in his subsequent delirium, he avoids being put back in his cell. When he returns, he stumbles upon a jailbreak and knocks the convicts unconscious for which he is hailed as a hero and given special treatment. When he is informed that he will soon be released due to his heroic actions, he argues unsuccessfully that he prefers life in jail.\n\nUpon release, he applies for a new job with a shipbuilder but leaves after causing an accident. Soon after, he runs into a orphaned girl, Ellen ([[Paulette Goddard]]), who is fleeing the police after stealing a loaf of bread. Determined to go back to jail and to save her from arrest, the Tramp tells the police that he is the thief and asks to be arrested, but a witness reveals his deception and he is freed. He then eats an enormous amount of food at a [[cafeteria]] without paying to get arrested, and once again encounters Ellen in a [[paddy wagon]] after he is put in it. It soon crashes however, and she convinces him to escape with her. The Tramp then gets a job as a night watchman at a department store, and encounters three burglars led by \"Big Bill,\" a fellow worker from the factory, who explains that they are hungry and desperate. After sharing drinks with them, he wakes up the next morning during opening hours and is arrested once again for failing to call the police on the burglars and for sleeping in the store\u2019s clothes on a desk, shocking a customer and the storekeeper.\n\nDays later, Ellen takes him to a run-down shack to live in. The next morning, he reads about an old factory\u2019s re-opening and lands a job as a mechanic's assistant. The other workers then suddenly decide to go on strike, and tell the Tramp to leave with them. Outside the factory, he accidentally launches a brick at a policeman and is arrested again.\n\nHe is released two weeks later, and learns that Ellen is now a caf\u00e9 dancer. She gets him a job as a singer and waiter, but he goes about his duties clumsily. During his floor show, he loses his cuffs, which bear the lyrics to his song, but he rescues the act by improvising the lyrics using gibberish and by   [[pantomime|pantomiming]]. When police arrive to arrest Ellen for her earlier escape, the two are forced to flee again, and Ellen despairs that their struggles are all pointless, but the Tramp reassures her. At a bright dawn, they walk down the road towards an uncertain but hopeful future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Charlie Chaplin]] as a factory worker ([[The Tramp]])\n* [[Paulette Goddard]] as Ellen Peterson \"The Gamin\"\n* [[Henry Bergman]] as the Caf\u00e9 proprietor\n* [[Tiny Sandford|Stanley \"Tiny\" Sandford]] as Big Bill\n* [[Chester Conklin]] as a Mechanic\n* [[Al Ernest Garcia]] as the President of the Electro Steel Corp.\n* [[Stanley Blystone]] as Gamin's father\n* [[Richard Alexander (actor)|Richard Alexander]] as the prison cellmate\n* Cecil Reynolds as a Minister\n* [[Mira McKinney]] as the Minister's wife\n* [[Murdock MacQuarrie]] as J.

Chaplin did not understand why Gandhi generally opposed it, though he granted that \"machinery with only consideration of profit\" had put people out of work and ruined lives.<ref>{{cite book |title=Chaplin in the Sound Era: An Analysis of the Seven Talkies |page=80| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXUwCgAAQBAJ&q=Chaplin+in+the+Sound+Era:+An+Analysis+of+the+Seven+Talkies |first=Eric L. |last=Flom |publisher=McFarland |date=July 11, 2015 |edition=reprint |isbn=978-1476607986 |access-date=August 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nChaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first \"talkie\", and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However, he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects and sparse dialogue. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of his \"Little Tramp\" character would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen. Most of the film was shot at \"silent speed\", 18 frames per second, which when projected at \"sound speed\", 24 frames per second, made the slapstick action appear even more frenetic. The duration of filming was long for the time, beginning on October 11, 1934, and ending on August 30, 1935.<ref>As said in ''Chaplin Today: Modern Times'', a 2003 French documentary.</ref>\n\nChaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance has noted, \u201cChaplin recognized that ''Modern Times'' was the valedictory for the Tramp and deliberately included many gags and sequences as a loving farewell to the character and an homage to the visual comedy tradition.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/modern_times.pdf |title=Modern Times |publisher=www.loc.gov |last=Vance |first=Jeffrey |date= |accessdate=2021-05-28}}</ref>\n\nThis film also famously uses [[matte painting]] in the harrowing skating scene where Charlie skates blindfolded, not realizing he's constantly near the edge and very likely could fall down. The illusory drop has been matte-painted, and Chaplin was never in actual danger while filming this scene {{emdash}} in reality, he skated on a plain floor, with a ledge for him to discern when to stop. This can be observed in the fact that, at one moment, Chaplin's back wheel briefly disappeared behind the painting. This most likely escaped the eyes of Chaplin, which could be the reason he left it in.<ref>{{cite web|title=thekidsshouldseethis.com|url=http://thekidsshouldseethis.com/post/the-roller-skating-scene-from-charlie-chaplins-modern-times|access-date=2021-02-10|website=thekidsshouldseethis.com}}</ref>\n\nThe reference to drugs seen in the prison sequence is somewhat daring for the time (since the [[production code]], established in 1930, forbade the depiction of illegal drug use in films); Chaplin had made drug references before in one of his most famous short films, ''[[Easy Street (1917 film)|Easy Street]]'', released in 1917.\n\n==Music==\nAccording to the official documents, the music score was composed by Chaplin himself, and arranged with the assistance of [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], who had collaborated with Chaplin on the music score of his previous film ''[[City Lights]]''.  Newman and Chaplin had a falling out near the end of the ''Modern Times'' soundtrack recording sessions, leading to Newman's angry departure.\n\nThe romance theme was later given lyrics, and became the pop standard \"[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]\", first recorded by [[Nat King Cole]]. A cover of this song by [[Jimmy Durante]] was also used in the trailer for the 2019 film ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'', in which the lead character also watches scenes from a showing of ''Modern Times'' after sneaking into a movie theatre.\n\n''Modern Times'' was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard as he performs [[L\u00e9o Daniderff]]'s comical song \"''Je cherche apr\u00e8s Titine''\". Chaplin's version is also known as \"The Nonsense Song\", as his character sings it in [[gibberish]]. The lyrics are nonsensical but appear to contain words from French and Italian; the use of deliberately half-intelligible wording for comic effect points the way towards Adenoid Hynkel's speeches in ''[[The Great Dictator]]''.\n\nAccording to film composer [[David Raksin]], he wrote the music as a young man wanting to make a name for himself. Chaplin would sit, often in the washroom, humming tunes and telling Raksin to \"take this down\". Raksin's job was to turn the humming into a score and create timings and synchronization that fit the situations. Chaplin was a violinist and had some musical knowledge, but he was not an orchestrator and was unfamiliar with synchronization. Along with [[Edward B. Powell]], Raksin did receive screen credit for the music arrangements.<ref>David Raksin & C.M. Berg, Music Composed by Charles Chaplin: Auteur or Collaborateur? Journal of the University Film Association, 1979.</ref> Raksin later created scores for films including ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' and ''[[The Day After]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Grand Op Mod Times.jpg|thumb|World premiere of ''Modern Times'' (1936), New York]]\n\n''Modern Times'' is often hailed as one of Chaplin's greatest achievements, and it remains one of his most popular films. It holds an approval rating of 98% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 108 reviews, with a [[weighted average]] of 9.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A slapstick skewering of industrialized America, ''Modern Times'' is as politically incisive as it is laugh-out-loud hilarious.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/modern_times/| title=Modern Times (1936)| work=Rotten Tomatoes| access-date=May 6, 2021}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reports an aggregated score of 96/100 based on 4 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/modern-times-re-release| title=Modern Times (re-release) Reviews| website=Metacritic| access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nContemporary reviews were very positive.

Greene noted that whereas prior Chaplin films had featured \"fair and featureless\" heroines, the casting of [[Paulette Goddard]] suggested that his female characters might be presented with more personality than previously. He also voiced concern that the film would be considered to be a Communist film when in reality Chaplin's message was predominantly apolitical.

The opening of a fantasy sequence in the film, in which the unemployed factory worker trips over a footstool upon entering the living room of his \"dream home\" with the Gamin, inspired a similar opening to ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''.{{Citation needed|reason=Cool if true, but cite a reference to show this is true other than coincidence of ideas.|date=December 2021}}\n\nThis was Chaplin's first overtly political-themed film, and its unflattering portrayal of industrial society generated controversy in some quarters upon its initial release. Writing in ''The Liberal News'', the official magazine of the British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], in October 1936, Willoughby Dewar observed ''Modern Times'' \"should be seen by every Young Liberal.

Clair, a friend and huge admirer of Chaplin who was flattered that the film icon would depict a similar subject, was deeply embarrassed that Tobis Film would sue Chaplin, and was never part of the case.\n\nThe film did attract criticism for being almost completely [[silent film|silent]], despite the movie industry having long since embraced the talking picture. Chaplin famously feared that the mystery and romanticism of the Tramp character would be ruined if he spoke, and feared it would alienate his fans in non-English speaking territories. His future films, however, would be fully fledged \"talkies\"&nbsp;\u2013 although without the character of the Little Tramp.\n\nChaplin biographer [[Jeffrey Vance]] has written of the reception and legacy of this classic comedy, <blockquote>''Modern Times'' is perhaps more meaningful now than at any time since its first release. The twentieth-century theme of the film, farsighted for its time\u2014the struggle to eschew alienation and preserve humanity in a modern, mechanized world\u2014profoundly reflects issues facing the twenty-first century. The Tramp's travails in ''Modern Times'' and the comedic mayhem that ensues should provide strength and comfort to all who feel like helpless cogs in a world beyond control. Through its universal themes and comic inventiveness, Modern Times remains one of Chaplin's greatest and most enduring works. Perhaps more important, it is the Tramp's finale, a tribute to Chaplin's most beloved character and the silent-film era he commanded for a generation.<ref>{{cite book| last=Vance| first=Jeffrey| date=October 1, 2003| title=Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema| location=New York| publisher=Harry N.
