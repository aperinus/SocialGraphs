Based on the 1985 novel ''[[Ardiente paciencia]]'' (English translation: \"Burning Patience\") by [[Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta]], itself adapted from a 1983 film written and directed by Sk\u00e1rmeta, the film tells a fictional story in which the real life [[Chile]]an poet [[Pablo Neruda]] forms a friendship with a simple [[Procida]] postman (Troisi) who learns to love poetry. The cast includes Troisi, [[Philippe Noiret]], and [[Maria Grazia Cucinotta]]. The screenplay was adapted by Radford, Troisi, Anna Pavignano, [[Furio Scarpelli]], and [[Giacomo Scarpelli]].\n\nWriter/star Troisi was severely ill during filming, postponing heart surgery so it could be completed. The day after principal photography ended, he suffered a fatal heart attack, and the film was completed and released posthumously.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/11/arts/film-a-postman-a-poet-an-actor-s-farewell.html|title=FILM; A Postman, a Poet, an Actor's Farewell|last=Laurino|first=Maria|date=11 June 1995|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=14 March 2019}}</ref> The film was critically acclaimed,<ref>{{Citation|title=Il Postino: The Postman (Il Postino) (1995)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/il_postino_the_postman|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> earning numerous accolades including [[BAFTA Awards]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film Not in the English Language]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music|Best Film Music]]. Composer [[Luis Bacalov]] won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Dramatic Score]], and the film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1950, [[Pablo Neruda]], the famous [[Chile]]an poet, is exiled to a small island in Italy for political reasons. His wife accompanies him. On the island, a local, Mario Ruoppolo, is dissatisfied with being a fisherman like his father. Mario looks for other work and is hired as a temporary postman, with Neruda as his only customer. He uses his bicycle to hand deliver Neruda's mail. (The island seems to have no cars). Though poorly educated, the postman eventually befriends Neruda and becomes further influenced by Neruda's political views and poetry.\n\nMeanwhile, Mario falls in love with a beautiful young lady, Beatrice Russo, who works in her aunt's village cafe. He is shy with her, but he enlists Neruda's help. Mario constantly asks Neruda if particular metaphors that he uses are suitable for his poems. Mario is able to better communicate with Beatrice and express his love through poetry. Despite the aunt's strong disapproval of Mario, because of his sensual poetry (which turns out to be largely stolen from Neruda), Beatrice responds favourably.\n\nThe two are married. The priest refuses to allow Mario to have Neruda as his best man because of politics; however, this is soon resolved. This was because Di Cosimo was the politician in office in the area with the [[Christian Democrats]]. At the wedding, Neruda receives the welcome news that there is no longer a Chilean warrant for his arrest so he returns to Chile.\n\nMario writes a letter but never gets any reply. Several months later, he receives a letter from Neruda. However, to his dismay, it is actually from his secretary, asking Mario to send Neruda's old belongings back to Chile. While there Mario comes upon an old [[phonograph]] and listens to the song he first heard when he met Neruda. Moved, he makes recordings of all the beautiful sounds on the island onto a cassette including the heartbeat of his soon-to-be-born child.\n\nFive years later, Neruda finds Beatrice and her son, Pablito (named in honour of Neruda) in the same old inn. From her, he discovers that Mario had been killed before their son was born. Mario had been scheduled to recite a poem he had composed at a large [[communist]] gathering in Naples; the demonstration was violently broken up by the police. She gives Neruda the recordings of village sounds that Mario had made for him. The film ends with Neruda walking on the beach where he used to talk with Mario, showing at the same time the communist gathering in which Mario was killed.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Massimo Troisi]] as Mario Ruoppolo\n*[[Philippe Noiret]] as [[Pablo Neruda]]\n*[[Maria Grazia Cucinotta]] as Beatrice Russo\n* [[Renato Scarpa]] as The Telegrapher\n* Linda Moretti as Donna Rosa\n* [[Mariano Rigillo]] as Di Cosimo\n* [[Anna Bonaiuto]] as [[Matilde Urrutia]]\n* [[Simona Caparrini]] as [[Elsa Morante]]\n*Michael Diana as Pablito\n\nNoiret's Italian-language dialogue was dubbed by actor Bruno Alessandro.\n\n== Production ==\n[[Massimo Troisi]], a popular Italian actor and filmmaker, had purchased the film rights to [[Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta]]'s ''[[Ardiente paciencia]]'' intending to adapt it into a feature film. The novel was itself an adaptation of a largely-unknown 1983 film of the same name, written and directed by Sk\u00e1rmeta. Troisi, having seen [[Michael Radford]]'s 1983 film [[Another Time, Another Place (1983 film)|''Another Time, Another Place'']], wrote a script treatment and gave it to Radford, who appreciated Troisi's enthusiasm but was dissatisfied with the script. Together with Troisi's ex-girlfriend Anna Pavignano, they stayed in a [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] beachfront hotel and wrote a new screenplay.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/23/how-we-made-il-postino-michael-radford-maria-grazia-cucinotta|title=How we made Il Postino|last=Hoad|first=Phil|date=2018-10-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Among the changes made to the original novel was changing the setting from contemporary Chile to 1950s Italy, and the character of Mario from a teenage fisherman to a 40-year old postman. Whereas the novel and the 1983 film were set in Chile, with Neruda living in his home at [[Isla Negra]] around 1970, ''Il Postino: The Postman'' moves the setting to Italy in about 1950.\n\nThe film is set and was filmed on the island of [[Procida]], gulf of [[Naples]]; some additional filming took place on [[Salina Island|Salina]], one of the volcanic [[Aeolian Islands]] that form an archipelago off the northern coast of Sicily. [[Corricella]] is the setting for some of the waterfront scenes in the movie.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XcD9AgAAQBAJ&q=corricella&pg=PA117|title=Fodor's The Amalfi Coast, Capri & Naples|publisher=Fodor's Travel Guide|year=2014|isbn=9781908206947}}</ref> Filming took 11 weeks, with only one break for the Easter holiday.\n\nTroisi's performance was hampered by his worsening heart condition, brought on by childhood [[rheumatism]]. Troisi was so weak that it was only possible for him to work for about an hour each day. Most of his scenes were shot in one or two takes. A shooting schedule was designed to allow the film to be shot around him. This was aided greatly by the fact his stand-in bore such a striking resemblance to Troisi. He was used for all back to camera, long/medium shots and most of the bicycle riding sequences. Troisi recorded all of his dialogue early in the production, in case he died before filming could be completed. This later proved necessary, since Troisi died one day after principal photography at his sister's house.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTroisi originally intended to co-direct the film with Radford, but was unable to effectively do so due to his illness. Though he is credited as co-director in the Italian release version, he is not credited in any other version, and as such was not eligible to be nominated for directing awards outside of Italy.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{further|Il Postino (soundtrack)}}\n\nIn 1994 to promote the film, [[Miramax]] published ''The Postman (Il Postino): Music From The Miramax Motion Picture'', which besides the film's score, composed by [[Luis Enr\u00edquez Bacalov]], includes Neruda's poems recited by many celebrities. There are a total of 31 tracks.\n\nIn 2002 [[Creazioni Artistiche Musicali|CAM]] Original Soundtracks released a 17 track version of the score (CAM 509536-2) which was mastered in Dolby Surround.\n\nThe album won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]].\n\nFor the 2010 opera based on the film see [[Daniel Cat\u00e1n]].\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was very well-received.
