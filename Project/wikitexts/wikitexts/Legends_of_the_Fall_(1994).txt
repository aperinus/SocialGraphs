Based on the 1979 [[novella]] of the same title by [[Jim Harrison]], the film is about three brothers and their father living in the wilderness and plains of [[Montana]] in the early 20th century and how their lives are affected by nature, history, war, and love. The film's time frame spans from the early 20th century; [[World War I]], through the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era, and ending with a brief scene set in 1963. The film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] and won for Best Cinematography ([[John Toll]]).<ref name=deseretnews/> Both the film and book contain occasional [[Cornish language]] terms, the Ludlows being a [[Cornish American|Cornish]] immigrant family.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tristram|first=Hildegard L.

Along with One Stab, a [[Cree]] friend, he builds a ranch and raises his family. Accompanying them are hired hand and former outlaw Decker, Decker's Cree wife Pet, and daughter Isabel Two. William has three sons: Alfred, the eldest; Tristan, the  middle son; and Samuel, the youngest.\n\nWilliam's wife Isabel does not adapt to the harsh Montana winters and moves to the East Coast; Tristan vows never to speak of her. At age 12, Tristan touches a sleeping grizzly bear. The bear awakens and injures him, but he cuts off a claw.\n\nYears later, Samuel returns from [[Harvard University]] with his fianc\u00e9e, Susannah. Susannah finds Tristan captivating but loves Samuel. Before they can marry, Samuel announces his intention to join the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] and aid Britain in the fight against Germany. Much to their father's displeasure, Alfred also joins. Although Tristan does not want to join, he does so after swearing to Susannah to protect Samuel.\n\nThe brothers find themselves in the [[10th Battalion (Canadians), CEF|10th Battalion, CEF]]. Alfred, commissioned as an officer, leads a charge into no man's land. The attack results in heavy casualties and Alfred is wounded. While visiting Alfred in the field hospital, Tristan learns that Samuel volunteered for a dangerous reconnaissance mission. He rushes off to protect his brother but arrives too late. Tristan holds Samuel until he dies, then cuts out his brother's heart and sends it home to be buried at the ranch. Tristan single-handedly raids the German lines and returns to camp with the scalps of German soldiers hanging around his neck, horrifying his fellow soldiers. He is discharged but does not go home. Alfred returns to Montana and proposes to Susannah, but she declines.\n\nTristan returns home, where Susannah finds him weeping over Samuel's grave. She comforts him and they become lovers. A jealous Alfred confronts Tristan before leaving to make his name in [[Helena, Montana|Helena]]. Tristan is plagued with guilt over Samuel's death and feels responsible for driving Alfred away; he leaves Montana for several years. Susannah vows to wait for Tristan, but eventually receives a letter from him telling her to marry someone else. Alfred comforts Susannah, and William finds them together, which leads to a falling out between him and Alfred. William later suffers a stroke. He does not speak for years and the ranch deteriorates. Susannah marries Alfred, now a congressman. Alfred's business and politics cause him to get involved with the O'Banion brothers, Irish bootleggers and gangsters.\n\nTristan returns during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], bringing life back to the ranch and to his father. He falls in love with Isabel Two and they marry and have two children. Tristan becomes involved in small-scale [[rum-running]], finding himself at odds with the O'Banion brothers. Isabel Two is accidentally killed by a police officer working for the O'Banions. In a fit of grief, Tristan beats the officer nearly to death and is jailed. Susannah visits Tristan, still having feelings for him, but he refuses her advances. After his release, Tristan and Decker kill those responsible for Isabel's death, including one of the O'Banion brothers.\n\nUnable to live without Tristan, Susannah commits suicide. The remaining O'Banion brother, along with the sheriff and another police officer, come after Tristan. At the ranch, William and Alfred kill the attackers. Alfred reconciles with his father and brother. The family realizes that Tristan will be blamed for the deaths, which prompts Tristan to ask Alfred to take care of his children. One Stab's narration explains that they buried the bodies and dumped the car in the Missouri River. He reflects that rather than dying young as One Stab expected, Tristan lived to watch his children and grandchildren grow. One Stab observes that it was the people Tristan loved and wanted to protect most that died young.\n\nIn 1963, Tristan, now an old man living in the North Country, investigates an animal carcass and is confronted by a grizzly bear. He draws his knife and fights it. As they struggle, One Stab narrates, \"It was a good death.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Tristan Ludlow\n** Keegan MacIntosh as Young Tristan Ludlow\n**[[Eric Johnson (actor)|Eric Johnson]] as Teen Tristan Ludlow\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Colonel William Ludlow\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Alfred Ludlow\n* [[Julia Ormond]] as Susannah Fincannon-Ludlow\n* [[Henry Thomas]] as Samuel Ludlow\n* [[Karina Lombard]] as Isabel 'Isabel Two' Decker-Ludlow\n** Sekwan Auger as Young Isabel Two Decker\n* [[Gordon Tootoosis]] as One Stab\n* [[Christina Pickles]] as Isabel Ludlow\n* Paul Desmond as Tom Cullen / Roscoe Decker\n* [[Tantoo Cardinal]] as Pet Decker\n* [[Robert Wisden]] as John T.
