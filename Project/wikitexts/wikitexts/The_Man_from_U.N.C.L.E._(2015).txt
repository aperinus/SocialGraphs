It is based on the 1964 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] [[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|television series of the same name]], which was created by [[Norman Felton]] and [[Sam Rolfe]]. The film stars [[Henry Cavill]], [[Armie Hammer]], [[Alicia Vikander]], [[Elizabeth Debicki]], and [[Hugh Grant]]. The film was produced by [[RatPac-Dune Entertainment]], and [[Davis Entertainment]], while [[Turner Entertainment Co.]], the original TV series current holder, was also involved.\n\nIn 1993, [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] obtained the rights for a film adaptation based on the original series. However, the film fell into [[development hell|development limbo]] due to multiple script rewrites. Over the years, [[Matthew Vaughn]], [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]], and [[Steven Soderbergh]] were optioned for directing until Ritchie signed on in March 2013. The film premiered at [[Barcelona]] on August 2, 2015 and was released on August 14, 2015, by [[Warner Bros.]] It received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing only $107&nbsp;million worldwide on a $75\u201384&nbsp;million budget.<ref>{{Cite web |title=10 Great Films From The 2010s That Underperformed at The Box Office |url=https://collider.com/films-underperformed-box-office/ |access-date=July 21, 2022 |website=Collider}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1963, at the height of the [[Cold War]], ex-[[United States Army]] Sergeant and professional thief-turned-[[CIA]]-Agent [[Napoleon Solo]] extracts Gaby Teller, daughter of Dr. Udo Teller, a missing alleged [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] scientist-turned United States collaborator at the end of World War II, from [[East Berlin]], evading [[KGB]] Agent [[Illya Kuryakin]]. He later reports to his superior, Sanders, who reveals that Gaby's maternal uncle Rudi works in a shipping company owned by Alexander and Victoria Vinciguerra, a wealthy Nazi sympathizer couple who intend to use Teller to build their own private [[nuclear weapon]] and give it to lingering Nazi elements. Due to the potentially world-ending nature of this crisis, the CIA and KGB have reluctantly teamed up, and Solo and Kuryakin are ordered to stop the Vinciguerras from succeeding, with both men secretly assigned to steal Udo Teller's research for their respective governments.\n\nThe trio travels to [[Rome]], where Gaby and Kuryakin reluctantly pose as an engaged couple, and Solo pretends to be an antiquities dealer. Solo deduces they are being monitored and instructs Kuryakin not to defend himself from muggers so as to preserve this cover. Despite their hostilities towards each other, Kuryakin heeds his advice and does not react when his father's prized watch is stolen. Later, at an auto racing event promoted by the Vinciguerras, Solo and Gaby flirt with Victoria and Alexander to obtain information about Teller. Meanwhile, Kuryakin acquires evidence the Vinciguerras were recently exposed to radiation, indicating that their weapon is near completion.\n\nSolo and Kuryakin begrudgingly join forces to break into a Vinciguerra shipping yard, in which they find traces of uranium. After accidentally setting off the alarm, they escape into the water but find their way blocked. During a scuffle with the guards, Kuryakin nearly drowns. Solo escapes but surprises himself by returning to save Kuryakin. Although a suspicious Victoria pursues them with her henchmen, Solo and Kuryakin manage to slip past into their own rooms undetected. Victoria and Solo spend the night together. The following day, Gaby meets with Rudi and Alexander to discuss a job, but unexpectedly betrays Kuryakin and Solo to them. Kuryakin escapes but Victoria drugs and captures Solo and takes him to a nearby warehouse. There, Rudi, who is revealed as an infamous Nazi war criminal, tortures Solo in an [[electric chair]]. Solo is rescued by Kuryakin, who tortures Rudi. Rudi reveals that the weapon is hidden in an island fortress where Gaby has been reunited with her father; while Solo and Kuryakin discuss what they should do with Rudi, the chair malfunctions and causes a fire which kills him. Solo and Kuryakin travel to the fortress.\n\nTo protect Gaby, Dr. Teller pretends to resume work on the weapon but intends to sabotage it. Victoria quickly sees through this deception, and has Alexander imprison Gaby as an incentive. Victoria kills Teller as soon as he has finished the weapon.\n\nMeanwhile, Solo and Kuryakin are approached by [[Alexander Waverly]], a high-ranking [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] Agent who reveals that Gaby is an undercover agent under his employment. He and members of the [[Special Boat Service]] help Solo and Kuryakin infiltrate the Vinciguerras's compound. While they search the compound, Solo finds Kuryakin's stolen watch on a guard. Alexander Vinciguerra then attempts to escape with Gaby and the warhead, but is intercepted and killed. Solo retrieves the disc with Teller's research, but realizes that the warhead Vinciguerra was taking with him was a non-nuclear secondary missile. Victoria has left undetected on another boat with the real warhead. Solo is able to contact Victoria via radio and keep her on the line long enough for Waverly to locate her and launch a homing missile, destroying the nuclear weapon and the boat, ostensibly taking Victoria with them.\n\nKuryakin is ordered by his commander to kill Solo and steal the disc. Furious at the order, but threatened with being sent to [[Siberia]] if he fails, a broken Kuryakin confronts Solo in his hotel room. When Solo produces Kuryakin's father's stolen watch, Kuryakin admits what his assignment was, only to have Solo reply that he knew this, and had the same orders. They instead share a drink on the terrace and burn the contents of the disc, so as to not give either of their countries the upper hand in the [[Nuclear arms race|arms race]]. Reuniting with Gaby and Waverly, they are told that the trio has been reassigned to a new international organization under Waverly's command. Waverly gives them a new mission in [[Istanbul]] under a new codename: [[U.N.C.L.E.]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as [[Napoleon Solo]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as [[Illya Kuryakin]]\n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as Gaby Teller\n* [[Elizabeth Debicki]] as Victoria Vinciguerra\n* [[Sylvester Groth]] as Uncle Rudi\n* [[Christian Berkel]] as Udo Teller\n* [[Luca Calvani]] as Alexander Vinciguerra\n* Misha Kuznetsov as Oleg\n* [[Jared Harris]] as Adrian Sanders \n* [[Hugh Grant]] as [[Alexander Waverly]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nProducer [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] optioned the film rights to the 1960s TV series in 1993, setting up a development deal for an adaptation with [[Warner Bros.]] and series producer [[Norman Felton]]. Davis has estimated that he commissioned 12 or 14 different scripts over the course of 20 years, with writers [[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim]] and [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]], [[John Requa]], [[Glenn Ficarra]], and [[Scott Z.
