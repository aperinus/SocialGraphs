However, Carter himself suffers from [[multiple personality disorder]], as his alternate personalities include violent petty criminal Cain, shy 7-year-old boy Josh, and middle-aged nanny Margo who protects the others at all costs. Carter and Cain are killing young mothers to procure their children, apparently for experiments performed by Carter's father, a child psychologist who lost his license years earlier after performing unethical experiments on children.\n\nJenny is having an affair with her ex-boyfriend Jack Dante, the widower of a former patient, and she plans to leave Carter for him. When Carter discovers their tryst, Cain takes over and begins leaving subtle clues for the police implicating Jack in the murders. Next, he attempts to kill Jenny by suffocating her and submerging her car in a lake. She escapes, however, and confronts Carter at home. Unable to find Amy, Jenny demands Carter tell her where she is. Carter replies that she is with his father - only for an incredulous Jenny to reply that his father has been dead for years.\n\nThe police contact Dr. Lynn Waldheim, who co-wrote a book with Nix Sr. called ''Raising Cain'', about a boy with multiple personality disorder. Nix Sr. had extensive detailed knowledge of Cain's tortured childhood, including taped recordings of their sessions. However, Waldheim was never allowed to meet Cain. She eventually discovered the truth: Nix Sr. dispassionately put his own son through years of severe [[child abuse]] to gain firsthand accounts of his traumatic psychological development and study the emerging personalities. Horrified, Waldheim quit the project. Nix Sr. then disappeared, leaving behind a suicide note. After the police make the connection, Carter is apprehended for [[attempted murder]]. Waldheim is sent in alone to interrogate him.\n\nDuring interrogation, Margo and Josh act and speak for Carter. Josh recites a rhyme and vanishes, and Margo assumes control, stonewalling Waldheim from any further questioning. Eventually, Carter and Cain break from their confines and pounce upon Dr. Waldheim, knocking her unconscious and leaving the building disguised as her. The police soon find Waldheim, who begs them to arrest Carter before he harms Amy.\n\nJenny follows a woman who she thinks is Waldheim to a motel, but it is actually Carter/Cain. She follows Carter/Cain, who is now Margo, into an elevator. When it opens, she sees Nix Sr. holding Amy hostage. While Jenny begs for Nix Sr. to give back her daughter, Carter, Cain and Margo stab \"their\" father from behind. Jack arrives with the police, and Carter and his personalities disappear.\n\nLater on, Jenny takes Amy to a park and explains to her friend Sarah that Nix Sr. faked his own death and established a new identity and a clandestine research facility in [[Norway]]. He had been using Carter and his multiples to procure the children so he would have an adequate [[control group]] to study the development of MPD.\n\nAmy runs off into the woods, calling for her father. Jenny follows her and finds Amy, who says her father has gone away. When Jenny bends down to pick Amy up, Carter appears behind her in a wig and a dress; Margo is now in control.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Dr. Carter Nix / Cain / Dr. Nix Sr. / Josh / Margo\n* [[Lolita Davidovich]] as Dr. Jenny O\u2019Keefe Nix\n* [[Steven Bauer]] as Jack Dante\n* [[Frances Sternhagen]] as Dr. Lyn Waldheim\n* [[Gregg Henry]] as Lieutenant Terri\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Sergeant Sean Cally\n* [[Mel Harris]] as Sarah\n* [[Teri Austin]] as Karen Bowman\n* [[Gabrielle Carteris]] as Nan\n* Barton Heyman as Mack\n* Amanda Pombo as Amy Nix\n* Kathleen Callan as Emma\n* [[Geoff Callan]] as Young Lover\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nDuring production on ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'', [[Brian De Palma]] toyed around with the idea of a suspense movie set on a playground.

De Palma came across Gelderblom's edit and was impressed by it, and successfully arranged to have the cut added to the Blu-ray release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fanedit.org/fanedit-impresses-director-and-becomes-official-cut/|title=Fanedit Impresses Director and Becomes Official Cut \u2013 Fanedit.org|website=www.fanedit.org|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Martin, Mick & Porter, Marsha.
