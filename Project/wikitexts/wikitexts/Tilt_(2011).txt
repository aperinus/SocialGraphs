A chance meeting between Stash (Yavor Baharoff) and Becky (Radina Kardjilova) brings them to a passionate love affair. \n\nSuddenly, they are caught illegally distributing porn films. Becky's father, a police colonel, takes charge of the case and threatens them with prison. The only way to avoid going to jail is for Stash and Becky to stop seeing each other. They decide to run away to a small German village. Being poor emigrants, they find themselves in a series of funny and absurd situations. Stash is constantly trying to reach Becky, but with no luck. The four friends finally decide to go back to Bulgaria. Meanwhile, Bulgaria has changed, and so has Becky.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yavor Baharov]] as Stash\n* [[Radina Kardjilova]] as Becky\n* [[Ovanes Torosian]] as Gogo\n* [[Alexander Sano]] as B-Gum\n* [[Ivaylo Dragiev]] as Angel\n* [[Phillip Avramov]] as Snake\n* [[Joreta Nikolova]] as Stash's Mother\n* [[Georgi Staykov]] as Katev\n* [[Georgi Novakov]] as Grigorov\n* [[Robert Yanakiev]] as Sgt.
