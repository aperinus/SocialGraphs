The film's tale of a community of settlers moved to defend themselves against a roving band of [[Banditry|marauders]] follows an archetypical \"[[western (genre)|Western]]\" frontier movie motif, as does Max's role as a hardened man whose decision to assist the settlers helps him rediscover his humanity.<ref name=Scheib/> Filming took place in locations around [[Broken Hill]], in the [[Outback]] of [[New South Wales]].<ref>[http://www.madmaxmovies.com/mad-max-2-the-road-warrior/filming-locations/index.html Mad Max 2 / The Road Warrior Filming Locations].

It was also a box office success, and the film's post-apocalyptic and punk aesthetics helped popularise the genre in film and [[fiction]] writing. At the [[10th Saturn Awards]], the film won [[Saturn Award for Best International Film|Best International Film]] and was nominated for five more awards: [[Saturn Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Saturn Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Gibson, [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Bruce Spence]], [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]], and [[Saturn Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costumes]] for [[Norma Moriceau]].

Now, former policeman Max Rockatansky, haunted by the death of his family,{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Mad Max (film)|Mad Max]]'' (1979)}} drives his [[Supercharger|supercharged]] black V-8 [[Pursuit Special]] around the desert wilderness of [[Australia]], scavenging for food and petrol with his [[Australian Cattle Dog]]. He outmaneuvers a small group of marauders led by the unhinged biker Wez using his driving skills and a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and gets some petrol from a wrecked [[semi-truck]].\n\nLater, Max tries collecting an apparently abandoned [[gyrocopter]]'s fuel, but is ambushed by the pilot. Max overpowers the man with his dog's help, sparing his life in return for being led to a working oil refinery the pilot has discovered. They arrive during the daily attack on the facility by a motley motorised gang, whose members include Wez.\n\nThe next day, Max witnesses several cars leave the besieged compound and get chased down by marauders. He rescues the sole survivor of one car and strikes a deal to return him to the complex in exchange for fuel, but the man dies shortly after Max gets him back, and the leader of the settlers, Papagallo, reneges on the deal. The settlers are about to confiscate Max's car and cast him out of their compound when the marauders return to parley. A feral child who lives in the wasteland near the refinery kills Wez's partner with a metal boomerang and Wez wants revenge, but the gang's leader, a muscular masked man called \"Lord Humungus\", offers to spare the settlers' lives in exchange for their fuel supply and leaves for the day.\n\nWith the settlers split about what to do, Max offers his own deal: he will bring them the semi-truck he saw earlier so they can try to haul away their [[Tank truck|tanker]] full of oil, if they return his car and give him as much fuel as he can carry. The settlers agree to let him try, and that night Max sneaks past the marauders on foot carrying fuel for the truck. He encounters the Gyro Captain and forces the man to fly him to the truck, which he is able to get started. It is somewhat damaged as Max passes through the marauders' encampment on the way back to the refinery, but he makes it, followed by the gyrocopter.\n\nMax refuses Papagallo's entreaty to accompany the settlers to a fabled northern paradise,{{efn|Revealed by a set of postcards to be the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]].}} opting instead to collect his fuel and leave. Wez catches him using Humungus's [[Nitrous oxide engine|nitrous oxide]]-equipped vehicle and causes him to crash. A Marauder kills Max's dog and is about to kill the seriously-injured Max when a Marauder named Toadie attempts to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special's tanks, triggering the car to self-destruct. Left for dead, Max is rescued by the Gyro Captain and returned to the compound.\n\nDespite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired truck during the escape. His support consists of the Gyro Captain, Papagallo in a separate vehicle, three of the settlers on the outside of the armoured tanker, and the Feral Kid, who jumps on the truck as it is leaving. The marauders pursue the tanker, allowing the remaining settlers to flee their compound in a caravan of smaller vehicles after rigging the refinery to explode.\n\nPapagallo and the three settlers are killed and the Gyro Captain is shot down. Max turns the truck around and, as he is fighting with Wez, Humungus collides with the truck head on, killing Wez and himself. The truck rolls off the road and the surviving marauders survey the scene and leave. As Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he sees sand, not oil, leaking from the tank. The Gyro Captain drives up and takes Max and the Feral Kid to rendezvous with the settlers, who transported the fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles.\n\nThe Gyro Captain succeeds Papagallo as leader of the settlers and takes them north. The Feral Kid, revealing himself as the film's narrator, relates that he became \"Chief of the Great Northern Tribe\" when he grew up. He concludes by saying that he never saw the Road Warrior again.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- in the same order as the closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Max Rockatansky|\"Mad\" Max Rockatansky]], a former member of the Australian highway patrol (the Main Force Patrol, or MFP) who, after a biker gang killed his family, left the force and hunted down and killed all of the gang members.
