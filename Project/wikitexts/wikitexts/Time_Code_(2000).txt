The dialogue was largely [[improvisation|improvised]], and the sound mix of the film is designed so that the most significant of the four sequences on screen dominates the soundtrack at any given moment.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film takes place in and around a film production company office, and involves several interweaving plot threads which include a young actress named Rose who tries to score a screen test from her secret boyfriend Alex Green, a noted but disillusioned director. Meanwhile, Rose's tryst with him is discovered by her girlfriend Lauren, an insanely jealous businesswoman who plants a microphone in Rose's purse and spends most of the time in the back of her limousine parked outside the office building listening in on Rose's conversations. Elsewhere, Alex's wife Emma is seen with a therapist debating about asking him for a divorce. In the meantime, numerous film industry types pitch ideas for the next big hit film.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Solman |first=Gregory |title=Review: Time Code |url=https://www.filmcomment.com/article/time-code-review/ |access-date=2022-10-22 |website=Film Comment |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Screenshot-Timecode.png|thumb|right|270px|An illustration of the [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split-screen]] technique used throughout ''Timecode'']]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Evan Wantz\n* [[Golden Brooks]] as Onyx Richardson\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as Emma Green\n* [[Viveka Davis]] as Victoria Cohen\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Lester Moore\n* Aimee Graham as Sikh Nurse\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Rose\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as Dava Adair, Therapist\n* Andrew Heckler as Auditioning Actor\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as Renee Fishbine, Executive\n* [[Danny Huston]] as Randy\n* [[Daphna Kastner]] as Auditioning Actress\n* Patrick Kearney as Drug House Owner\n* Elizabeth Low as Penny, Evan's Assistant\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Bunny Drysdale\n* [[M\u00eda Maestro]] as Ana Pauls\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Cherine\n* [[Suzy Nakamura]] as Connie Ling\n* [[Alessandro Nivola]] as Joey Z\n* [[Zuleikha Robinson]] as Lester Moore's Assistant\n* [[Julian Sands]] as Quentin\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Alex Green\n* [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] as Lauren\n* [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]] as Darren\n}}\n\nIn the first run through, Headly's role as Dava Adair was performed by [[Laurie Metcalf]].\n\n== Production ==\nThe movie was shot with four hand-held digital cameras, in one take, on the sixteenth performance.
