It stars [[Cate Blanchett]] in the title role and is a fairly fictionalised portrayal of events during the later part of the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], a sequel to Kapur's 1998 film ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]''. The film co-stars [[Geoffrey Rush]] (reprising his role from the previous film), [[Clive Owen]], [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]], [[Abbie Cornish]], and [[Samantha Morton]]. The screenplay was written by [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]] and [[Michael Hirst (writer)|Michael Hirst]], and the music score was composed by [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]] and [[A. R. Rahman]]. [[Guy Hendrix Dyas]] was the film's production designer and co-visual effects supervisor, and the costumes were created by [[Alexandra Byrne]]. The film was shot at [[Shepperton Studios]] and various locations around the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film premiered on 9 September 2007 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. It opened in wide release in the United States on 12 October 2007, premiered in London on 23 October 2007, and opened wide on 2 November 2007 throughout the rest of the UK and Republic of Ireland. At the [[80th Academy Awards]], the film won [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] and Blanchett received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1585, Catholic Spain, ruled by [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip of Spain]] (Jordi Moll\u00e0), is the most powerful country in the world. Seeing Protestant England as a threat, and in retaliation for English piracy of Spanish ships, Philip plots to take over England and make his daughter, [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]], the Queen of England in Elizabeth's place. Meanwhile, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] (Cate Blanchett) of England is pressured by her advisor, [[Francis Walsingham]] (Geoffrey Rush), to marry \u2013 if she dies childless, the throne will pass to her first cousin, once removed, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (Samantha Morton), who is Catholic.\n\nEnglish explorer [[Walter Raleigh]] (Clive Owen) is presented at Queen Elizabeth's English court, having returned from the [[New World]]. Queen Elizabeth is attracted to Raleigh, enthralled by his tales of exploration, and asks [[Elizabeth Raleigh|Bess Throckmorton]] (Abbie Cornish), her most favored lady-in-waiting, to observe him. Bess also finds Raleigh attractive and they begin a secret affair. With tensions strained between England and Spain, Elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer, Dr. [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]].\n\n[[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in London conspire with Philip to assassinate Queen Elizabeth and replace her with Queen Mary, in what King Philip calls \"The English Enterprise\", historically known as the [[Babington Plot]]. From her imprisonment, Queen Mary sends secret correspondence to the Jesuits, who recruit [[Anthony Babington]] to assassinate Elizabeth. Walsingham continues to warn Queen Elizabeth of Spain's rising power and of the Catholics' plots against her, but unlike her predecessor and half-sister [[Mary I of England]], Elizabeth refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs.\n\nWalsingham's Catholic brother, who knows of the plot against Elizabeth, is jailed, leading Walsingham to reveal Spain's plan to Queen Elizabeth, who angrily confronts the Spanish diplomats. The Spanish ambassador feigns ignorance, accuses Queen Elizabeth of receiving Spanish gold from pirates, and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with Raleigh. Enraged, Elizabeth throws the Spaniards out of court. Meanwhile, Philip is cutting down the forests of Spain to build the [[Spanish Armada]] to invade England. Mary writes letters condoning the plot.\n\nBabington storms into a cathedral where Elizabeth is praying and fires a pistol at her, though Elizabeth is unharmed as there was no bullet in the gun. As Elizabeth learns of Mary's involvement in the plot, Walsingham insists Mary be executed to quell any possible revolt. Elizabeth reluctantly agrees. Mary is tried for high treason and beheaded; Walsingham realizes this was part of the Jesuits' plan all along: Philip never intended for Mary to become queen, but with the Pope and other Catholic leaders regarding Mary as the true Queen of England, Philip uses Mary's death to obtain papal approval for war. The \"murder\" of the last legitimate Catholic in the line of succession gives Philip the pretext he needs to invade England and remove Elizabeth, leaving the way to the English throne free for his own daughter.\n\nBess reveals to Raleigh that she is pregnant with his child, and pleads with him to leave. Instead, the couple marries in secret. When Elizabeth confronts Bess, she confesses her pregnancy and that Raleigh is her husband. An infuriated Elizabeth berates Bess, reminding her that she cannot marry without royal consent. She banishes Bess from court and has Raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the Queen.\n\nAs the Spanish Armada begins its approach up the English Channel, Elizabeth forgives Bess and sets Raleigh free to join [[Sir Francis Drake]] in the battle. The ships of the Armada vastly outnumber England's, but a storm blows the Armada toward the beaches, endangering its formation and becoming vulnerable to English [[fire ship]]s. Elizabeth, atop her coastal headquarters, walks out to the cliffs and watches the Spanish Armada sink in flames as the English prevail.\n\nShe visits Raleigh and Bess and blesses their child. Elizabeth appears to triumph personally through her ordeal, again resigned to her role as the Virgin Queen and mother to the English people.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]\n*[[Geoffrey Rush]] as [[Sir Francis Walsingham]]\n*[[Clive Owen]] as [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]]\n*[[Abbie Cornish]] as [[Elizabeth Raleigh|Bess Throckmorton]]\n*[[Samantha Morton]] as [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]\n*[[Jordi Moll\u00e0]] as [[King Philip II of Spain]]\n*[[Susan Lynch]] as [[Mary Fleming|Annette Fleming]]\n*[[Rhys Ifans]] as Robert Reston\n*[[Eddie Redmayne]] as [[Anthony Babington]]\n*[[Tom Hollander]] as [[Amias Paulet]]\n*[[David Threlfall]] as [[John Dee]]\n*[[Steven Robertson]] as Sir [[Francis Throckmorton]]\n*[[Adam Godley]] as William Walsingham\n*[[Laurence Fox]] as Sir [[Christopher Hatton]]\n*[[Will Houston|William Houston]] as [[Guerau de Esp\u00e9s]]\n*[[Christian Brassington]] as [[Charles II, Archduke of Austria]]\n*[[John Shrapnel]] as [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]]\n*[[Kelly Hunter]] as [[Ursula Walsingham]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Historical background===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\nIn 1558, King [[Philip II of Spain]]'s second wife, Queen [[Mary I of England]], died. They had wed in July 1554, a year after Mary's accession to the English throne, but the English Parliament had refused to grant him much real power as co-monarch of England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/king-philip-ii-spain.htm |title=King Philip II of Spain |website= elizabethan-era.org.uk}}</ref> On Mary's death he tried unsuccessfully to persuade her sister and successor, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], to marry him.\n\nFor many years Philip maintained peace with England, and even defended Elizabeth from the Pope's threat of excommunication. This was a measure taken to preserve a European balance of power. Ultimately, Elizabeth allied England with the Protestant rebels in the Netherlands. Further, English ships began a policy of piracy against Spanish trade and threatened to plunder the great Spanish treasure ships coming from the New World. English ships went so far as to attack a Spanish port. The last straw for Philip was the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] signed by Elizabeth in 1585 \u2013 promising troops and supplies to the rebels. Although it can be argued this English action was the result of Philip's [[Treaty of Joinville]] with the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League of France]], Philip considered it an act of war by England. With the Pope's blessing, he launched the [[Spanish Armada]] to attack England, [[Protestantism]], and Elizabeth herself. [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], whom the Queen favored, married [[Elizabeth Throckmorton]], a ward of Elizabeth's court, after learning she was carrying his child. Elizabeth I had both of them arrested, imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], and some time later released them.\n\n===Dramatic licence===\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2013}}\nThis representation of a historical period is heavily fictionalised for the purposes of entertainment. The film's lead Cate Blanchett was reported as saying: \"It's terrifying that we are growing up with this very illiterate bunch of children, who are somehow being taught that film is fact, when in fact it's invention\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Cate Blanchett's film rant |work=M&C, People News |date=5 November 2007 |url=http://people.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1371160.php/Cate_Blanchetts_film_rant |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715003643/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1371160.php/Cate_Blanchetts_film_rant |archive-date=15 July 2012 |access-date=16 August 2018 }}</ref> Some of the simpler fictions are:\n* [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] is falsely portrayed as a major figure in the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] and does not so credit [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] and other key leaders.\n* [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]], was lieutenant general at the Armada crisis, but in the film, he is not present at the Tilbury camp, his role having been given to Raleigh. The movie also does not make mention of Dudley's military campaign in the Netherlands.\n* [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles Howard]] (Lord Howard of Effingham, the actual commander of the English fleet), says at one point, \"We're losing too many ships.\" In reality, not a single English ship was lost during the battle.\n* The film depicts Elizabeth being advised by [[John Dee|Dr John Dee]]. Historically, Dee was travelling the continent throughout the period depicted and did not return until more than a year after the defeat of the Armada. Elizabeth's actual main advisor and chief minister, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], is omitted from the film altogether.\n* The portrayed Jesuit leader of the [[Babington Plot]], Robert Reston, is completely fictional, though based on the real-life Jesuit [[John Ballard (Jesuit)|John Ballard]], who encouraged Babington to initiate the assassination attempt on Elizabeth, which would subsequently begin the chain of events leading to the Spanish invasion. However, because Ballard was depicted being executed in [[Elizabeth (film)|the previous film]] for participating in the [[Ridolfi plot]], the persona of Reston was created to replace him.\n* In the film, Elizabeth is confronted at the altar of Old St Paul's Cathedral by [[Anthony Babington]], who has a pistol charged with powder but no shot. The real Babington Plot was, like preceding plots against Elizabeth, discovered and thwarted by [[Francis Walsingham]]'s investigative efforts while still in the planning stages, long before there was any threat of harm to Elizabeth.\n* The film also depicts Babington (and, implicitly, the other conspirators) as having been hanged by [[Hanging#Long drop|long drop]], rather than the actual, and more gruesome method of [[hanging, drawing and quartering]].\n* In 1585, Elizabeth was 52 (considered too old to bear children). The film shows various suitors being presented to the queen, with a view to marriage and children; the events presented actually took place much earlier in her reign. For instance, [[Erik XIV of Sweden]] abandoned his proposals to marry Elizabeth after his trip to England was interrupted by his father's death in 1560, when Elizabeth was 27. In fact, by 1568, Erik had been deposed from the Swedish throne and died in captivity in 1577. Likewise, marriage negotiations with [[Charles II, Archduke of Austria]] were abandoned in 1568 and in 1571, Charles married his niece [[Maria Anna of Bavaria (Archduchess of Austria)|Maria Anna of Bavaria]], with whom he had fifteen children.\n* [[Philip II of Spain]] is depicted at the time of the Armada as an old, sick man. In fact he was just five years older than Elizabeth, and his death (from cancer) was not until eight years later, in 1596.\n* In 1588, [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Infanta Isabel of Spain]] is portrayed as a child. In reality, she was 21 by this time.\n* The lady-in-waiting, [[Elizabeth Raleigh|Bess Throckmorton]], in fact became pregnant with Walter Raleigh's child in the summer of 1591, three years after the defeat of the Armada, not immediately before. After their secret marriage was inevitably discovered, Elizabeth had them locked up in the Tower of London. While she did eventually release them both, it was not out of any sense of forgiveness as the movie depicts. She released Raleigh because one of his expeditions returned to England with a captured Spanish ship, the ''Madre de Dios'', and his men threatened a mutiny if she did not return Raleigh to them. Bess was released because Elizabeth felt guilty after Bess's baby died of plague while she was incarcerated in the Tower.\n* The affair between Raleigh and Bess is depicted as beginning when Raleigh consoles Bess after her cousin [[Francis Throckmorton|Francis]] is executed for [[Throckmorton plot|his plot to assassinate Elizabeth]], six years before the affair actually took place.\n* [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] is depicted as having a Scottish accent, when in actuality, she had been raised at the French court from the age of five and did not return to Scotland until she was a young woman.\n* The film shows Spanish envoys and other members of court wearing swords during their audiences with Elizabeth. Owing to threats of assassination, only members of the [[Royal Guard]] were permitted to carry weapons near Elizabeth while she was in court.\n* The execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, is portrayed as having happened very swiftly after her arrest, while she was still a young woman. In fact, Mary was held in custody at various places for 19 years before her execution in 1587, at the age of 44.\n* The film depicts the battle between the English navy and the Spanish Armada as consisting of [[Broadside (naval)|broadside]]s from the ships of both fleets. In fact, while the English ships were able to fire multiple times during the course of a day, the heavy Spanish guns were so difficult to reload that they were frequently only fired once. Broadsides would accompany later developments in ship design in the first half of the 17th century, the first major actions involving such technology and tactics for the English being the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]].\n* During the film, Elizabeth spoke German to Charles II, Archduke of Austria. Although Elizabeth [[Elizabeth I#Early life|spoke several languages]] there is no evidence that she was taught or spoke German; nor is it likely that they ever met.\n* There was no Spanish ambassador in Elizabeth's court in 1585, as Elizabeth had him expelled from England following the discovery of the Throckmorton plot, after Francis Throckmorton claimed under torture that his plot had been sanctioned by the Spanish.\n\n====Claims of anti-Catholicism====\nThe film depicts an important episode in the violent struggle between the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Counter-Reformation]] that [[History of Europe#16th, 17th and 18th centuries|polarised European politics]]. Several critics (some cited below) claimed the film was \"[[anti-Catholic]]\" and followed a traditional English view of their own history. A British-based priest, Father Peter Malone, declared the film to be [[jingoism|jingoistic]] in his review.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn the US the ''[[National Catholic Register]]'', film critic Steven D. Greydanus compared this film to ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'', and wrote: \"The climax, a weakly staged destruction of the [[Spanish Armada]], is a crescendo of church-bashing imagery: rosaries floating amid burning flotsam, inverted [[crucifix]]es sinking to the bottom of the ocean, the rows of ominous berobed clerics slinking away in defeat. Pound for pound, minute for minute, ''Elizabeth: The Golden Age'' could possibly contain more sustained church-bashing than any other film I can think of.\" Greydanus asked: \"How is it possible that this orgy of anti-Catholicism has been all but ignored by most critics?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.decentfilms.com/sections/reviews/elizabeth2.html |title=Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) |access-date=15 October 2007 |author=Steven D.

My interpretation of Elizabeth is an interpretation of greater tolerance [than] Philip, which is absolutely true. It's completely true that she had this kind of feminine energy.

[A]sk any Catholic and they'll give you a totally different aspect of history ... History has always been an interpretation ... I do believe that civilisations that don't learn from history are civilisations that are doomed to make the same mistakes again and again, which is why this film starts with the idea of [[fundamentalism]] against [[toleration|tolerance]]. It's not Catholic against [[Protestant]]; it's a very fundamental form of Catholicism. It was the time of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and against a woman whose half of her population was Protestant, half was Catholic. And there were enough bigots in her Protestant [[Parliament of England#King, Lords and Commons|Parliament]] to say, 'Just kill them all', and she was constantly saying no.
