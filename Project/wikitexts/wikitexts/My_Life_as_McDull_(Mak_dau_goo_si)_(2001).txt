The film surrounds the life of [[McDull]], a hugely popular cartoon pig character created by [[Alice Mak (cartoonist)|Alice Mak]] and [[Brian Tse (writer)|Brian Tse]] which has appeared on [[comics]] ever since the 1990s. In 2004, the sequel to this film, ''[[McDull, Prince de la Bun]]'', was released.\n\n==Awards==\nThe FIPRESCI prize at the 26th [[Hong Kong International Film Festival]] (2002)\n\nGrand Prix at the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]], [[Annecy]], [[France]] (2003)\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nMcDull is not the brightest kid, but he continually tries his best to please his mother. Although it seems that he may not be destined for great things in life as his mother wishes, McDull never gives up.\n\nThe story focuses on several tales about McDull and his childhood. This is told as a narrative reflection of a now adult McDull. These tales muddle up in imaginative uses of [[Cantonese]] and heaps of local [[Hong Kong]] culture. From tales about a [[turkey meat|turkey]] dinner to dreams of following in [[Lee Lai-shan]]'s footsteps, McDull faces ebbs and flows with his demanding but devoted mother. In a part of the film, McDull decides to train to be an Olympic-level athlete like the Hong Kong Olympian [[Lee Lai-shan]]. However, the trade he learns is Cheung Chau bun-snatching. Realising that bun-snatching is not a formal sporting event in the [[Olympic games]], McDull's mother writes a letter to the chairman of the [[International Olympic Committee]] ([[IOC]]), asking him/her with her limited proficiency of English to sanctify the so-called sport event.\n\nThere is a significant amount of material in the movie which is culturally relevant to Hong Kong. For example, a large proportion of the humour and appeal of the movie arises from its complex wordplay and subtle hints of Hong Kong's historical legacy and dynamic.\n\nThe songs featured in the film are bright and beguiling, and are not overbearing as some musical animations are likely to become. The film's animation is trouble-free and colourful changing at times as stories alter, but echoing the fashion of the innovative artwork. It uses a number of contemporary [[Computer Graphics]] animations in several scenes to illustrate an urban Hong Kong, but it skillfully shows Hong Kong as the dirty [[conurbation]] it is rather than the high-pitched clean cityscape that many travel advertisements like to portray.\n\nThe genial and timid piglet McDull has cheered up the lives of kids, professors, housewives and CEOs, because he epitomises the uncontainable and happy-go-lucky spirit of Hong Kong. His no-holds-barred porcobiography is a frame-by-frame account of life growing up in the slums of [[Shamshuipo]], set against the colourful campaign of a post-97 Hong Kong trudging along regardless of downturn woes. Pouncing shots of busy [[Kowloon]] streets, slimy caf\u00e9s, plus sights and smells of local flavour fused with animation, live object shooting and 3-D computer graphics define the film.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hong Kong\u2013Maldives relations]]\n\n==External links==\n*{{YouTube|Lz-QIA0ZjOY|\u300a\u9ea5\u515c\u6545\u4e8b\u300b My Life as Mcdull}}\n*{{IMDb title|0312941}}\n\n{{McDull}}\n\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2000s Cantonese-language films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong animated films]]\n[[Category:Films based on comic strips]]\n[[Category:Television shows based on comic strips]]\n[[Category:Yellow Bus]]\n[[Category:Chinese children's films]]\n[[Category:2001 animated films]]\n[[Category:McDull]]\n[[Category:Annecy Cristal for a Feature Film winners]]\n[[Category:2000s Hong Kong films]]"}]}}}}
