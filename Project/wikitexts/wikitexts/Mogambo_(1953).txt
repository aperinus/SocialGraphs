Shot on location in Equatorial Africa, with a musical soundtrack consisting entirely of actual African tribal music recorded in the Congo, the film was adapted by [[John Lee Mahin]] from the play ''Red Dust'' by [[Wilson Collison]]. The picture is a remake of ''[[Red Dust (1932 film)|Red Dust]]'' (1932), which was set in [[Vietnam]] and also starred Gable in the same role.\n\nAlthough the original trailer for the film explains that \"Mogambo\" means \"the Greatest,\" in fact, the word \"Mogambo\" has no meaning at all. Producer Sam Zimbalist came up with the title by altering the name of the ''[[Mocambo (nightclub)|Mocambo]]'', a famous Hollywood nightclub.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Mogambo Ava.jpg|left|thumb|Ava Gardner in ''Mogambo'']]\nEloise \"Honey Bear\" Kelly arrives at a remote African outpost, looking for a rich maharajah acquaintance, only to find he has cancelled his trip owing to unrest in his realm. While waiting for the next river boat out, she spars with hardworking big game hunter and wild animal catcher Victor Marswell, who initially views her as disreputable. They later develop a mutual attraction and make love. Then the river boat brings Donald Nordley and his wife Linda. Honey Bear takes the steamer out at Marswell's urging, although she would prefer to stay with him and he expresses some regret at their parting. The Nordleys wish to go on [[safari]] to record the cries of gorillas. Marswell declines to guide them there due to the difficulties involved and insists that they be guided on the agreed route by his assistant, despite the Nordley's protests. Honey Bear rejoins the group after the steamer runs aground.\n[[File:Mogambo2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Clark Gable and Grace Kelly in ''Mogambo'']]\nMarswell rescues Linda from a panther, and Honey Bear sees that they are attracted to one another. After Marswell talks to Linda privately, he agrees to take the Nordleys into gorilla country, while also taking Honey Bear part of the way to join the district commissioner, who can then take her back to civilization. However, they find the commissioner mortally wounded by recently belligerent natives. With reinforcements days away, the small party narrowly escapes, taking the commissioner with them. Meanwhile, a serious romance is developing between Marswell and Linda. Only Donald is blind to the situation. Marswell plans to tell him about how he and Linda feel, but has second thoughts after realizing how much Donald loves his wife and perhaps how she would be better off remaining with him. The situation is aggravated when Marswell reluctantly shoots a gorilla to save Donald, blowing a chance to capture a baby gorilla. Marswell goes back to camp, depressed, and begins drinking heavily in his tent. Honey Bear joins him.\n\nWhen Linda appears, she finds them cuddling. Marswell decides he can fix everything by making Linda hate him and makes a show of this cuddling followed by dismissive remarks about Linda's infatuation with \"the White Hunter\" to enrage her. Unfortunately, his ploy works too well when Linda shoots him with his own pistol, wounding him in the arm. Honey Bear lies to the others, telling them that Marswell had been making advances to Linda for some time, finally forcing Linda to shoot him in his drunken state. The next day, the party breaks camp to head back, leaving Marswell behind to try to capture young gorillas to pay for the safari. Marswell, acknowledging to himself his feelings for Honey Bear, asks her to stay and then proposes to her, but she rebuffs him. As the canoes set off, however, she suddenly jumps into the water and wades her way back to him.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Mogambo (1953) Cast.jpg|thumb|right|''Mogambo'' cast with [[Donald Sinden]], Grace Kelly, [[Clark Gable]], [[Denis O'Dea]], [[Ava Gardner]] and [[Philip Stainton]]]]\n* [[Clark Gable]] as Victor Marswell\n* [[Ava Gardner]] as Eloise Kelly\n* [[Grace Kelly]] as Linda Nordley\n* [[Donald Sinden]] as Donald Nordley\n* [[Philip Stainton]] as John Brown-Pryce\n* [[Eric Pohlmann]] as Leon Boltchak\n* [[Laurence Naismith]] as Skipper\n* [[Denis O'Dea]] as Father Josef\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mogambo Ava2.jpg|left|thumb|Ava Gardner in ''Mogambo'']]\n\n===Development===\nIn 1946, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported MGM were considering remaking ''Red Dust'' with [[Marilyn Maxwell]] as a possible star.<ref>{{cite news |title='Red Dust' Repeat May Star Marilyn Maxwell |author=Edwin Schallert |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=4 November 1946}}</ref> In March 1948, [[Marie McDonald]] reportedly screen tested for the Jean Harlow part.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hedda Hopper--Looking at Hollywood |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=30 March 1948}}</ref> In May 1949, Maxwell and [[Gene Kelly]] were being considered for lead roles.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bickford Named Costar With 20th Luminaries; Maxwell Deal Hinted |author=Edwin Schallert |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=27 May 1949}}</ref>\n\nThe studio went on to have a great deal of success with color remakes of older films shot on location overseas, including ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1950 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'' (1950) and ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951). In August 1951, MGM announced they would make ''Mogambo'', which would be shot on location in Africa.

Gardner fell ill with dysentery during the shoot, requiring her to be flown to England (she recovered and flew back). There was a rumor Clark Gable was going to be assassinated by the Mau Mau, so John Ford moved a location. Two of the crew were revealed to be Mau Mau.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ava Gardner III With Dysentery |newspaper=New York Times |date=25 November 1952}}</ref> The unit was plagued by rain and the poor quality of the roads - three of the crew were killed in road accidents, including assistant director John Hancock.<ref>{{cite news |title=Actors Find Roads Chief Peril in Africa |author=Bob Thomas |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=3 April 1953}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Clark Gable's Film Aide Dies in Africa Crash |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=19 January 1953}}</ref>\n\n[[Donald Sinden]], then a contract star for the [[Rank Organisation]] at [[Pinewood Studios]], recalled:<blockquote>\"Ten White Hunters were seconded to our unit for our protection and to provide fresh meat. Among them were [[Duke of Manchester|Viscount Mandeville]] and Marcus, Lord Wallscourt, a delightful man whom Ford treated abysmally - sometimes very sadistically. In Ford's eyes the poor man could do nothing right and was continually being bawled out in front of the entire unit (in some ways he occasionally took the heat off me). None of us could understand the reason for this appalling treatment, which the dear kind man in no way deserved. He himself was quite at a loss. Several weeks later we discovered the cause from Ford's brother-in-law: before emigrating to America, Ford's grandfather had been a labourer on the estate in Ireland of the then Lord Wallscourt: Ford was now getting his own back at his descendant. Not a charming sight.<ref name=\"sinden\">[[Donald Sinden|Sinden, Donald.]] ''A Touch Of The Memoirs'', Hodder & Stoughton 1982; {{ISBN|0340262354}}/{{ISBN|9780340262351}}; pp. 174-75, 185</ref>\n\nBefore leaving camp on the first morning [of shooting] I had been told to report to the hair-dressing departments tent, where I found the make-up men armed with electric clippers: 'I have to remove the hair from your chest.' 'Whatever for?' I asked, 'Orders.' It transpired that Clark [Gable], whose chest was completely devoid of hair, had always insisted that no other actor should appear on film exposing a hirsute breast. This included any member of the crew not wearing a shirt as well. He considered it a slight on his masculinity.<ref name=\"sinden\"/> We now had to return to the [[MGM-British Studios|MGM Studios]] in London to shoot all the interior scenes. Someone must have pointed out to Ford that he had been thoroughly foul to me during the entire location shoot and when I arrived for my first day's work I found that he had caused a large notice to be painted at the entrance to our sound stage in capital letters reading \"BE KIND TO DONALD WEEK\". He was as good as his word - for precisely seven days. On the eighth day he ripped the sign down and returned to his normal bullying behaviour.\"<ref name=\"sinden\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Post-production===\nThe music featured in the film was performed by local native tribes (except for Gardner accompanied by player piano), unusual for [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], and the film records a traditional Africa and [[safari style]].\n\n[[Francoist Spain|Francoist Spanish]] censors would not allow [[adultery]] to be shown onscreen. For that reason, they changed the relationship of the characters of Linda Nordley (Kelly) and Donald Nordley (Sinden) from wife and husband to sister and brother in the dubbed version released in Spain, thus necessitating the removal of a bedroom scene in which only one bed is present.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was a hit&nbsp;\u2014 according to MGM records it made $4,576,000 in the US and Canada and $3,692,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $2,026,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/> It currently has a 77% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 13 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mogambo/ | title=Mogambo | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | access-date=11 March 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nGrace Kelly won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress]] while the film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] (Gardner) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] (Kelly).
