Houseman earned an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the professor. Houseman later reprised the role in a [[The Paper Chase (TV series)|TV series of the same name]] that lasted four seasons, following Hart, played by [[James Stephens (actor)|James Stephens]], through his three years of law school.\n\n==Plot==\nJames T. Hart starts his first year at Harvard Law School in a contract law course with Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. When Kingsfield immediately delves into the material using the [[Socratic method]] and asks Hart the first question, Hart is totally unprepared and feels so humiliated that, after class, he throws up in the bathroom.\n\nHart is invited to join a study group with five others:\n* Franklin Ford, the fifth generation of Fords at Harvard Law School\n* Kevin Brooks, a married man with a [[photographic memory]] but lacking in analytical skills\n* Thomas Anderson\n* Willis Bell, who is devoted to property law\n* O'Connor\nEach member of the group agrees to focus on a specific course and write a synopsis of their notes to share with each other before the final exams. Hart chooses contract law.\n\nWhile out getting pizza, Hart is asked by a woman, Susan Fields, to walk her home, as she says she feels uncomfortable about a man who has been following her. Hart returns to her house soon after and asks her on a date, after which they begin a complicated relationship: she resents the time he devotes to his studies and his fascination with Kingsfield, while he expects her to provide him with considerable attention and wants a firm commitment. When Hart and a select few of his classmates are invited to a cocktail party hosted by Kingsfield, he is stunned to discover that Susan is Kingsfield's married daughter. She is, however, separated from her husband and eventually gets a divorce. She and Hart break up and get back together several times.\n\nHart categorizes his classmates into three groups: those who have given up; those who are trying, but fear being called upon in class to respond to Kingsfield's questions; and the \"upper echelon\" who actively volunteer to answer. Hart strives to move from the second classification to the third, and succeeds as time goes on. \n\nHart eventually learns of the existence of the \"Red Set\", the archived and sealed personal notes that Harvard professors wrote when they were students, which are stored in a locked room of the library. Late one night, Hart and a classmate break into the library to read Kingsfield's notes. Hart marvels at the young Kingsfield's musings, such as whether or not humanity had an unwritten legal contract with God.\n\nThe mounting pressure gets to everyone as the course nears its end. Brooks attempts suicide and drops out of school. The study group is torn apart by personal bickering and dissolves. With final exams looming, Hart and Ford hole up in a hotel room for three days and study feverishly. Following the exam, on the last day of class, Hart and his classmates give Kingsfield a standing ovation which the professor acknowledges in his usual reserved manner. Later, as Hart and Susan walk together by the ocean, Hart makes a paper airplane out of the unopened envelope containing his grades and sends it flying into the water.\n\nThe film is a faithful adaptation of the novel, although it adds two elements not in the book: Hart's first name and middle initial (James T.), and his final grade in contract law (93, an A).<ref>{{cite news |last=Walsh |first=Colleen |title=''The Paper Chase'' at 40: Law School audience reflects on iconic film about earning degree |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/10/the-paper-chase-at-40/ |date=October 2, 2012 |newspaper=[[Harvard Gazette]] |access-date=October 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main cast===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Timothy Bottoms]] as James T.

Kingsfield Jr.===\nThere are several possible inspirations for the character. Retired Harvard Law professor Clark Byse is said to have been the inspiration for the character's position at [[Harvard Law School]], though not the character's personality. According to John Houseman,<ref>''[http://picasaweb.google.com/stuart.fanning/JohnHousemanThePaperChaseTVSeriesTVGuideArticleAugust91986# TV Guide]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', August 9, 1986</ref> the inspiration for Kingsfield was crusty professor Edward \"Bull\" Warren, also reflected in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/08/24/hes_still_crimson_after_all_these_years/ | title=He's still crimson after all these years|publisher=boston.com}}</ref> Houseman had noted that Kingsfield's behavior is actually a toned-down version of Warren's famous classroom rudeness, as enshrined in classroom lore, and recounted several examples of the professor's putdowns.\n\n[[James Bridges]] originally earmarked [[James Mason]] for the Kingsfield role, but he was unavailable. After attempts to cast [[Melvyn Douglas]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Paul Scofield]], and other famous actors in the role, Bridges offered it to Houseman, who agreed to fly to Toronto (where the film's interior sequences were to be shot) for a screen test. Bridges called it \"fabulous\", and Houseman accepted the part, thus launching his acting career. He had seldom acted before, but knew Bridges from the time he was a stage manager in Houseman's UCLA Professional Theater Group. Houseman then recommended Bridges as a writer for the television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', for which Bridges wrote 18 teleplays before establishing himself as a motion picture writer-director.<ref>Houseman, John, ''Unfinished Business: Memoirs 1902-1988,'' New York, Applause Theatre Books, 1989, p. 459-460.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe exterior shots of the Harvard Law School buildings were filmed on the Harvard Law School campus, and the library shots were filmed in the Harvard Andover library at the [[Harvard Divinity School]]. All interiors were shot on stages in [[Toronto]]. In a 1999 interview, [[Gordon Willis]] said production designer [[George C.

Most of the extras for the Harvard Law School venue scenes were then current Harvard Law students, paid a $25 [[per diem]] by 20th Century Fox.\n\nWillis shot ''The Paper Chase'' in [[anamorphic format]] due to the \"schoolroom and the graphics in the film.\"<ref name=\"pp1999\"/> He also commented on the cinematography, noting that the composition of the scenes with Houseman and Bottoms \"related to who had command of the situation.

His Ivy League Olympian is Kingsfield, a professor of contract law who passes along scholarship with finely tempered disdain. In an original bit of casting, Kingsfield is played by veteran theater and film producer John Houseman. It is a forbidding, superb performance, catching not only the coldness of such a man but the patrician crustiness that conceals deep and raging contempt.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[University of Chicago Law School]] called Houseman's rendition of the [[Socratic method]] \"over-the-top\", telling prospective students:<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.law.uchicago.edu/prospectives/lifeofthemind/socraticmethod| date= October 17, 1973 | title= Prospective Students : Studying Law at Chicago : The Socratic Method | publisher= University of Chicago Law School| access-date= 2011-09-02}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>John Houseman may have won an Oscar for his impressive performance, but if anyone ever did teach a law school class like his Professor Kingsfield, no one at Chicago does today. Instead, our students discover quickly that the Socratic Method is a tool and a good one that is used to engage a large group of students in a discussion, while using probing questions to get at the heart of the subject matter. The Socratic Method is not used at Chicago to intimidate, nor to \"break down\" new law students, but instead for the very reason Socrates developed it: to develop critical thinking skills in students and enable them to approach the law as intellectuals.</blockquote>\n\nOthers disagreed; another reviewer found it accurate:\n\n<blockquote>This is really the only serious flick about law school life. It's brooding and intense, perfectly capturing the dynamic between law professor and student. The movie is worth watching just for actor John Houseman's Academy Award-winning performance as Professor Kingsfield. Every school still has a professor that knows how to absolutely terrify the 1Ls \u2014 for us at UChicago, that was [[Richard H. Helmholz|Richard \"The Hammer\" Helmholz]].  ''The Paper Chase''{{'}}s Professor Kingsfield is like a distillation every one of these scary arch-villain type professors.<ref>{{cite web | last=Jones | first=Evan | url=https://lawschooli.com/best-law-school-movies/ | title=The Best Legal Movies That Every Law Student Should Watch | publisher=lawschooli}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the movie four stars and singled out the performances of Bottoms and Houseman for praise.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-paper-chase-1973 |title=The Paper Chase |first=Roger |last=Ebert |date=October 16, 1973}}</ref>\n\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 7.16/10.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Paper Chase (1973) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paper_chase |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=December 23, 2020}}</ref>  On [[Metacritic]], which sampled seven critic reviews and calculated a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, the film received \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title= The Paper Chase Reviews |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-paper-chase |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date= December 22, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
