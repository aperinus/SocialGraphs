The small cast film follows Herzog and his crew ([[Gabriel Beristain]], [[Russell Williams II]]) while working on the production of a movie project on the [[Loch Ness Monster]] titled '''''Enigma of Loch Ness'''''. ''Incident at Loch Ness'' won the New American Cinema Award at the 2004 [[Seattle International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"awards\">{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374639/awards?ref_=tt_awd | title=Incident at Loch Ness: Awards | publisher=IMDB | access-date=31 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a mysterious shot of a body floating in Loch Ness (reprised near the end), ''Incident at Loch Ness'' flashes back to the beginning of a [[Documentary film|documentary]] called '''''Herzog in Wonderland''''' being directed by [[John Bailey (cinematographer)|John Bailey]] with an overview of Herzog's work as he himself begins work for a separate documentary to be called ''Enigma of Loch Ness'', in which he is exploring the [[Loch Ness Monster]] myth.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/17/movies/17LOCH.html | title=Werner Herzog Takes a Trip Down the Rabbit Hole | work=The New York Times | date=17 September 2004 | access-date=31 May 2014 | author=Kehr, Dave}}</ref> Throughout the film, Herzog asserts the Loch Ness Monster is merely a creation of a collective psychological need in society.<ref name=\"offscreen\" />\n\nAs the film continues, Herzog hosts a dinner party to kick off film production. In attendance are his wife ([[Lena Herzog]]), several Hollywood celebrities (actors [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Ricky Jay]], and [[Crispin Glover]] and editor [[Pietro Scalia]]), and the film's crew. Difficulties begin to arise as the untested [[Film producer|producer]], [[Zak Penn]], attempts to transform Herzog's film into a high-grossing [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]. In this attempt, Penn commits several Hollywood clich\u00e9s such as hiring a beautiful woman (Kitana Baker) for a dubious role as a [[sonar]] operator and a delusional [[cryptozoologist]] (Michael Karnow) for comic relief.<ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nAs the shooting progresses, the tension between Herzog and Penn escalates with each revelation that Penn is acting in an underhanded manner. First, it becomes quite apparent the producer has commissioned a fake \"[[Nessie]]\" to be used. Then both Kitana and Karnow are revealed to be actors hired by Penn.<ref name=\"offscreen\" />\n\nIn a twist of events, when Herzog and his crew are working on their film, the crew begins to see what appears to truly be the Loch Ness Monster. Herzog and crew become more and more concerned as first the boat's motor fails and then the \"monster\" appears to be attacking the vessel in a deepening fog. The crew huddles below decks until the monster returns again to ram the boat hard enough to cause it to begin to sink. Karnow is thrown overboard during another attack, \"Nessie\" now clearly visible to the crew. Karnow is lost in the fog and presumably eaten by the monster.  After Penn and the [[assistant director]] (Robert O'Meara), sneak away in the liferaft, Herzog decides to put on the ship's sole [[wetsuit]] and swim to shore for help.<ref name=\"ebert\" /> Before he can do so, however, \"Nessie\" returns to finally sink the ship. While holding a camera in a water-resistant housing, Herzog captures underwater images of a large creature passing him in the murky, dark water.\n\nThe next day, Penn is found by vacationers and leads them back to recover all but O'Meara and Karnow, who are presumed dead. At this point, it appears that both the documentary film we have been watching and the documentary film we were watching Herzog make could be fictitious. However, this never becomes completely obvious, and the film ends without making it clear exactly who is duping whom.<ref name=\"offscreen\">{{cite web | url=http://www.offscreen.com/index.php/phile/essays/incident_ness/ | title=Searching for Nessie | date=30 September 2005 | access-date=31 May 2014 | author=Church, David}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as Himself\n* Kitana Baker as Herself\n* [[Gabriel Beristain]] as Himself\n* [[Russell Williams II]] as Himself\n* David A.

The ruse is revealed in [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]] hidden on the [[DVD]]. Penn wrote what he calls a \"[[scriptment]]\" (part [[Screenplay|script]], part [[Film treatment|treatment]]) that outlined the specific structure of the film and including key dialogue that was needed in order to advance the plot, but left most of the dialogue and interaction up to the participants to work out as [[improvisation]].<ref name=\"murray\">{{cite web | url=http://movies.about.com/od/directorinterviews/a/lochness102404.htm | title=Screenwriter Zak Penn Makes His Directorial Debut With \"Incident at Loch Ness\" | access-date=31 May 2014 | author=Murray, Rebecca | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620033045/http://movies.about.com/od/directorinterviews/a/lochness102404.htm | archive-date=20 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAs shown on the DVD, the \"hoax\" was on even before photography started as several media outlets announced the upcoming production as an actual film.<ref name=\"offscreen\" /> Adding to the [[verisimilitude]] is the fact that everyone who appears on screen is a real person and most are in fact who they say they are.
