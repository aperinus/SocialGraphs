He signed a contract with [[RKO Pictures]] in 1939. Although it was unusual for an untried director, he was given freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have [[final cut privilege]]. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the [[Screenplay for Citizen Kane|screenplay for ''Citizen Kane'']], collaborating with Herman J. Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940, the same year [[Citizen Kane trailer|its innovative trailer]] was shown, and the film was released in 1941.\n\nAlthough it was a critical success, ''Citizen Kane'' failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release, but it returned to public attention when it was praised by French critics such as [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]] and re-released in 1956. In 1958, the film was voted number 9 on the prestigious [[Expo 58#International film poll|Brussels 12]] list at the 1958 World Expo. ''Citizen Kane'' was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] as an inductee of the 1989 inaugural group of 25 films for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing \u2013 National Film Preservation Board &#124; Programs &#124; Library of Congress|website=[[Library of Congress]]|date=October 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|archive-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/film/registry_titles.php|title=National Film Registry|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419221742/http://www.loc.gov/film/registry_titles.php|archive-date=April 19, 2012|access-date=April 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=April 22, 2020|archive-date=May 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200505082616/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Citizen-Kane-Welles-Podium.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Favored to win election as governor, Kane makes a campaign speech at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Citizen-Kane-Comingore-Welles-Collins.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = The affair between Kane and Susan Alexander ([[Dorothy Comingore]]) is exposed by his political opponent, Boss Jim W. Gettys ([[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]])\n}}\nIn a mansion called [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|Xanadu]], part of a vast palatial estate in [[Florida]], the elderly [[Charles Foster Kane]] is on his deathbed. Holding a [[snow globe]], he utters his last word, \"Rosebud\", and dies. A [[newsreel]] obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher and industrial magnate. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of \"Rosebud\".\n\nThompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He tries to approach his second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an [[alcoholic]] who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns about Kane's rise from a Colorado boarding house and the decline of his personal fortune.\n\nIn 1871, gold was discovered through a mining deed belonging to Kane's mother, Mary Kane. She hired Thatcher to establish a trust that would provide for Kane's education and to assume guardianship of him. While the parents and Thatcher discussed arrangements inside the boarding house, the young Kane played happily with a [[sled]] in the snow outside. When Kane's parents introduced him to Thatcher, the boy struck Thatcher with his sled and attempted to run away.\n\nBy the time Kane gained control of his trust at the age of 25, the mine's productivity and Thatcher's prudent investing had made him one of the richest men in the world. He took control of the ''New York Inquirer'' newspaper and embarked on a career of [[yellow journalism]], publishing scandalous articles that attacked Thatcher's (and his own) business interests. Kane sold his newspaper empire to Thatcher after the [[1929 stock market crash]] left him short of cash.\n\nThompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls that Kane hired the best journalists available to build the ''Inquirer''{{'}}s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating [[public opinion]] regarding the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of the President of the United States.\n\nThompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a [[retirement home]]. Leland says that Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrated over the years, and he began an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while running for [[Governor of New York]]. Both his wife and his political opponent discovered the affair and the [[Political scandal|public scandal]] ended his political career. Kane married Susan and forced her into a humiliating [[opera]]tic career for which she had neither the talent nor the ambition, even building a large opera house for her. After Leland began to write a negative review of Susan's disastrous opera debut, Kane fired him but finished the negative review and printed it. Susan protested that she never wanted the opera career anyway, but Kane forced her to continue the season.\n\nSusan consents to an interview with Thompson and describes the aftermath of her opera career. She attempted suicide and so Kane finally allowed her to abandon singing. After many unhappy years and after being hit by Kane, she finally decided to leave him. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan left him, he began violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. When he happened upon a snow globe, he grew calm and said \"Rosebud\". Thompson concludes that he cannot solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane's last word will remain a mystery.\n\nBack at Xanadu, Kane's belongings are cataloged or discarded by the staff. They find the sled on which the eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado and throw it into a furnace with other items. Behind their backs, the sled slowly burns and its trade name becomes visible through the flames: \"Rosebud\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Citizen-Kane-Moorehead.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = [[Harry Shannon (actor)|Harry Shannon]], [[George Coulouris]] and [[Agnes Moorehead]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Citizen-Kane-Inquirer-Window.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Orson Welles]] and [[Everett Sloane]]\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =Citizen-Kane-Comingore-Welles.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Dorothy Comingore and Orson Welles\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image4    =Citizen-Kane-Collins-Welles.jpg\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = Ray Collins, Dorothy Comingore, Orson Welles and [[Ruth Warrick]]\n}}\nThe beginning of the film's ending credits state that \"Most of the principal actors in ''Citizen Kane'' are new to motion pictures.

Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed \"Pan-focus\", as I have been active for two years in its development and used it for the first time in ''Citizen Kane''. Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism.

Henry Luce was in attendance and reportedly wanted to buy the film from RKO for $1&nbsp;million to distribute it himself. The reviews for this screening were positive. A ''Hollywood Review'' headline read, \"Mr. Genius Comes Through; 'Kane' Astonishing Picture\". The ''Motion Picture Herald'' reported about the screening and Hearst's intention to sue RKO.

Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations.<ref name=\"PBS\"/> Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason ''Kane'' failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.<ref name=\"Nasaw\">{{cite book |last=Nasaw |first=David |author-link=David Nasaw |title=The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst |url=https://archive.org/details/chieflifeofwilli0000nasa |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location=Boston,MA |date=2000 |isbn=0-395-82759-0}}</ref>{{Rp|572\u2013573|date=April 2012}}\n\nHearst's attacks against Welles went beyond attempting to suppress the film.

A 14-year-old girl had reportedly been hidden in the closet of his room, and two photographers were waiting for him to walk in.

Falacci noted that throughout the process he had daily visits in 1990-1 from an unnamed \"older RKO executive showing up every day \u2013 nervous and sweating\". According to Falacci's colleague, this elderly man was keen to cover up a clerical error he had made decades earlier when in charge of the studio's inventory, which had resulted in the original camera negatives being sent to a silver reclamation plant, destroying the [[nitrate film]] to extract its valuable silver content. Falacci's account is impossible to verify, but it would have been fully in keeping with industry standard practice for many decades, which was to destroy prints and negatives of countless older films deemed non-commercially viable, to extract the silver.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wellesnet.com/citizen-kane-negative/ |last=Falacci |first=Nicolas |author-link=Nicolas Falacci |title=Negative for 'Citizen Kane' may be lost forever |newspaper=Wellesnet |date=February 27, 2021 |access-date=February 28, 2021}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent prints were derived from a master positive (a fine-grain preservation element) made in the 1940s and originally intended for use in overseas distribution.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McGreevey |first1=Tom |last2=Yeck |first2=Joanne L. |title=Our Movie Heritage |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |location=New Brunswick, NJ |date=1997 |isbn=0-8135-2431-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ourmovieheritage0000mcgr/page/135 135\u201336] |url=https://archive.org/details/ourmovieheritage0000mcgr/page/135}}</ref> Modern techniques were used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical reissue in 1991 which [[Paramount Pictures]] released for then-owner [[Turner Broadcasting System]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/20/movies/for-citizen-kane-a-fresh-start-at-50.html |last=Rohter |first=Larry |author-link=Larry Rohter |title=For 'Citizen Kane,' a Fresh Start at 50 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 20, 1991 |access-date=February 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611053838/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/20/movies/for-citizen-kane-a-fresh-start-at-50.html |archive-date=June 11, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> which earned $1.6&nbsp;million in North America<ref name=\"Mojo\">{{cite web |title=Citizen Kane (1941) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=citizenkane.htm |access-date=December 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101036/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=citizenkane.htm |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> and {{US$|1.8 million|long=no}} worldwide.<ref name=\"Paducah\">{{cite news |last1=Thomas |first1=Bob |title=Treasure trove: Recycling movie classics financial success for film studio |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/427330404/ |access-date=21 April 2022 |work=[[The Paducah Sun]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |date=3 August 1992 |page=58 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, RKO sold the American television rights to its film library, including ''Citizen Kane'', to [[C&C Group|C&C Television Corp.]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Boddy |first=William |title=Fifties Television: The Industry and Its Critics |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |location=Champaign, Illinois |date=1993 |access-date=November 29, 2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWjhCESKy4AC&q=c%26c%20%2B%20rko%20%2B%201955&pg=PA138 |isbn=978-0-252-06299-5 |archive-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114035151/https://books.google.com/books?id=sWjhCESKy4AC&pg=PA138&q=c%26c+%2B+rko+%2B+1955&hl=en |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1960, television rights to the pre-1959 RKO's live-action library were acquired by [[United Artists]].
