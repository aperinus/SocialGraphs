It is the sequel to ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and the second film in the [[Scary Movie (film series)|''Scary Movie'' film series]]. The film stars [[Anna Faris]], [[Regina Hall]], [[Shawn Wayans]] and [[Marlon Wayans]] (all reprising their roles from the first film, despite their characters having seemingly been killed off), as well as [[Tim Curry]], [[Tori Spelling]], [[Chris Elliott]], [[Christopher Masterson|Chris Masterson]], [[Kathleen Robertson]], [[David Cross]] and [[James Woods]].\n\nThe film is the last in the series to feature the involvement of stars Marlon and Shawn Wayans, and director Keenan. Marlon would eventually go on to produce a similar horror-themed parody, ''[[A Haunted House]]'', and [[A Haunted House 2|its sequel]], both starring himself. In the latter film, Wayans pokes fun at the ''Scary Movie'' series' decline in quality after his family's departure.\n\nWhere the original film was mainly based on the [[slasher film]]s of the 1990s, ''Scary Movie 2'' parodies an array of supernatural and haunted house films from various decades, namely ''[[The Haunting (1999 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1999), ''[[Stigmata (film)|Stigmata]]'' (1999), ''[[The Exorcist]]'' (1973), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (1979), ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982), ''[[The Legend of Hell House]]'' (1973), ''House on Haunted Hill'' (both the [[House on Haunted Hill|1959]] and [[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|1999 versions]]), ''[[The Changeling (film)|The Changeling]]'' (1980), ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000) and ''[[Bloodbath at the House of Death]]'' (1984) while also making many references to the slasher flick ''[[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1998). It also spoofs the comedy film ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'' (2000) and some contemporary films, such as ''[[Hannibal (2001 film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001) and ''[[Hollow Man]]'' (2000). ''Scary Movie 2'' was commercially successful, grossing $141.2 million worldwide from a $45 million budget,<ref name=mojo/> but received largely negative reviews from critics.<ref name=rt/>\n\n== Plot ==\nAt haunted mansion Hell House, teenage Megan Voorhees becomes possessed by the spirit of Hugh Kane, the house's cruel, wicked previous owner. She interrupts a formal dinner party, thrown by her mother, who seeks help from two priests, Fathers McFeely and Harris. After an unsuccessful attempt to exorcise Kane's ghost, McFeely pulls a gun and shoots Megan.\n\nOne year later, [[Cindy Campbell]], Brenda Meeks, Ray Wilkins and Shorty Meeks are at college, trying to live new lives after surviving the events of the first film. Cindy and Brenda are tagged by socially maladjusted Alex. Shorty is still the same stoner he was before. Ray, still confused about his sexuality, has two new male friends, Tommy and Buddy, the latter of whom becomes romantically interested in Cindy. She rebuffs him but agrees to be friends.\n\nThe sinister Professor Oldman and his charming paraplegic assistant, Dwight Hartman, plan to study the paranormal activity at Hell House. They recruit Cindy and her friends as test subjects under the pretense of a psychological experiment on [[sleep paralysis]]. At the mansion, Cindy encounters a foul-mouthed parrot and Hanson, a creepy caretaker with a badly malformed hand. Later, the group is joined by the attractive Theo. They sit down for dinner, but soon lose their appetite due to Hanson's repulsive treatment of the food.\n\nThat night, Cindy hears voices directing her to a secret room, where she and Buddy discover the diary of Kane's wife. Seeing her portrait, they note Cindy's (slight) resemblance. Meanwhile, the others also experience bizarre encounters. Kane's ghost has sex with Alex in her bedroom, and quickly departs at the mention of commitment. Cindy gets into a fistfight with the house cat, Mr. Kittles. When Cindy tries to tell Oldman, he dismisses it, and sends Theo to take Cindy to bed. Later, Cindy is possessed by Kane's wife, and she seduces Oldman. She quickly returns to normal, with no memory of the event. A toy clown attempts to kill Ray, but in a strange turn of events, the doll is sexually assaulted by Ray instead. A weed-monster rolls Shorty into a joint. It proceeds to smoke him (much to Shorty's enjoyment), but gets distracted and lets him escape. The next morning, Oldman tells Dwight that no one is leaving the house, despite the attacks, and shows his true lecherous nature. Dwight is given the only house keys, and told to give them to nobody. Theo offers oral sex to no avail; Dwight does it to himself. She knocks him out and takes the keys.\n\nOldman is seduced and killed by the ghost of Kane's mistress, Victoria Crane. Shorty later encounters the same ghost, but charms and has sex with her. After Dwight equips the teens with weapons that can injure their spectral enemy, they are pursued throughout the mansion, Alex attempts to win Kane's love, but is killed by Crane's ghost. Buddy and Cindy are locked in the walk-in freezer. Cindy uses a collection of random objects to produce a [[Caterpillar tractor|Caterpillar 2-Ton tractor]] and escapes the freezer.\n\nHanson becomes possessed by Kane and kidnaps an inebriated Shorty. Cindy, Brenda and Theo team up to battle Hanson with highly stylized fight choreography, but are defeated. Dwight regroups with the teens, and Cindy chooses to act as bait to lure Kane into a device that will destroy him. The plan succeeds, freeing the group from the house's curse.\n\nTwo months later, Cindy and Buddy are in a relationship. They are out on a walk when Hanson appears to take Cindy away with him. Buddy disappears as Hanson gets hit by a car, driven by Shorty.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Anna Faris]] as [[Cindy Campbell]]\n* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Ray Wilkins \n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Shorty Meeks\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Brenda Meeks\n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Buddy Sanderson\n* [[Kathleen Robertson]] as Theo\n* [[David Cross]] as Dwight Hartman\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Professor Oldman\n* [[Tori Spelling]] as Alex Monday\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Hanson\n* [[James Woods]] as Father McFeely\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Father Harris\n* [[Richard Moll]] as Hugh Kane (Hell House Ghost)\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Mrs. Voorhees\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Megan Voorhees\n* [[Beetlejuice (entertainer)|Beetlejuice]] as Shorty's brain\n* [[Matthew Friedman (film editor)|Matt Friedman]] (''voice'') as Polly the parrot \n* [[Vitamin C (singer)|Vitamin C]] (''voice'') as herself\n* [[Suli McCullough]] (''voice'') as Clown\n* Jennifer Curran as Victoria Crane, Hugh's mistress\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is a sequel to ''[[Scary Movie]]''. According to director [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]], the filmmakers watched over 130 horror films for background research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1425783.stm|title=Scary sequel 'out-grosses' first|author=Brook, Tom|date=6 July 2001|publisher=bbc.co.uk|access-date=18 October 2016}}</ref> [[Marlon Brando]] was originally cast as Father McFeely and completed one day of filming before he had to leave the production due to illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/celebrity/brandos-scary-scene/|title=Brando's 'Scary' Scene|author=Silverman, Stephen M.|date=15 June 2001|publisher=people.com|access-date=18 October 2016}}</ref> He was replaced by [[James Woods]] who was paid $1 million for four days work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jun/29/news.britneyspears|title=Hugh Grant up for Harry Potter role|date=29 June 2001|publisher=theguardian.com|access-date=18 October 2016}}</ref>\n[[Charlton Heston]] had also turned down the Woods role. At one point, former President [[Bill Clinton]], who had just left office the year the film came out, was also considered.\n\nBecause Miramax had not greenlit this sequel until the massive box office success of the first, the film faced a punishing production schedule that involved coming up with a script and tearing through production and post-production in a total of less than nine months, roughly half the average time for all those steps to be completed on a standard Hollywood production in 2000\u20132001. It was this rushed production that made the Wayans never want to make another ''Scary Movie'', and they were not involved in any of the sequels.\n\n== Music ==\nUnlike its predecessor, the film does not have an official soundtrack. It features a heavily [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[rap music|rap]] catalogue, with some [[rock music|rock]] and [[techno]] songs.\n\n* \"[[Hello, Dolly!
