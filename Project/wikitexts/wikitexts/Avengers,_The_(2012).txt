After the success of the film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' in May 2008, Marvel announced that ''The Avengers'' would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Tony Stark (Downey), Steve Rogers (Evans), Bruce Banner (Ruffalo), and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Natasha Romanoff in March 2009 and Renner as Clint Barton in June 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by [[Zak Penn]]. Production began in April 2011 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], before moving to [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots.\n\n''The Avengers'' premiered in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the last film of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score. The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

In 2017, ''The Avengers'' was featured as one of the [[Empire (film magazine)#The 100 Greatest Movies|100 greatest films of all time]] in an ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine poll. It received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]], among [[List of accolades received by The Avengers (2012 film)|numerous other accolades]]. Three sequels have been released: ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<!-- Please note! Current consensus is to NOT include Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars here because, while they are Avengers franchise films, given the nature of the MCU, they have less correlation to the Avengers films that have released to date.

In exchange for retrieving the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]],{{refn|name=Tesseract|group=N|Producer Kevin Feige stated that the Tesseract is based on the [[Cosmic Cube]] from the Marvel Comics.<ref name=\"movieline\" /> After ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013), he stated that it was also the [[Space Stone]].<ref name=\"CraveOnline3\" />}} a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]], director of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], arrives at a remote research facility, where physicist Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] is leading a team experimenting on the Tesseract. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a [[wormhole]], allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and other agents, including [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]], to aid him.\n\nIn response, Fury reactivates the \"[[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Initiative]]\". Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] heads to [[Kolkata]] to recruit Dr. [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to trace the Tesseract through its [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] emissions. Fury approaches [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] to retrieve the Tesseract, and Agent [[Phil Coulson]] visits [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] to have him check Selvig's research. Loki is in [[Stuttgart]], where Barton steals the [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power, leading to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki gets escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers intervene and Loki is taken to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Helicarrier]], where he is imprisoned.\n\nThe Avengers become divided over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop powerful weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As they argue, Loki's agents attack the Helicarrier, and the stress causes Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff knocks Barton unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a wormhole generator Selvig built to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark Tower]] to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.\n\nRogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk rally in defense of [[New York City]], and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri. The Hulk beats Loki into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can shut down the generator. Fury's superiors from the [[World Security Council]] attempt to end the invasion by launching a [[nuclear missile]] at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit loses power, and he goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him. In the aftermath, Thor returns with Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki will face their justice.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the Other confers with his master{{refn|name=Thanos|group=N|Feige confirmed that the \"master\" in the post-credits scene is [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]].<ref name=\"EmpirePodcast\" />}}<!-- NOTE!

Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which included ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"RDJ\" /> He said he initially pushed Whedon to make Stark the lead: \"Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> About the character's evolution from previous films, Downey said, \"In ''Iron Man'', which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. ''Iron Man 2'' is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In ''The Avengers'', he's throwing it down with the others\".<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Downey earned $50 million from the film, \"once box-office bonuses and backend compensation [were] factored in\".<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]]: <br />A [[World War II]] veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films, in addition to ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Evans\" /> Evans said that Steve Rogers is much darker in ''The Avengers'': \"It's just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You've got to imagine, it's enough of a shock to accept the fact that you're in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they're all dead. He's just lonely. I think in the beginning it's a fish-out-of-water scene, and it's tough. It's a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, Evans said, \"I think there's certainly a dichotomy\u2014this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they're polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it's pretty fun.\"<ref name=\"MTVNews10\" /> Evans earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner / Hulk]]: <br />A genius scientist who, because of exposure to [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]], transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, who was considered to play Banner in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008) before [[Edward Norton]] took the role,<ref name=\"CastRuffalo2\" /> was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton broke down.<ref name=\"Ruffalo\" /> About replacing Norton, Ruffalo said, \"I'm a friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation's ''[[Hamlet]]''.\" About the character, he said, \"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself\u2014the dark and the light\u2014and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|Bill Bixby TV series]], which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities\".<ref name=\"EW1\" /> Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, \"He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!\"<ref name=\"Kimmel\" /> This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, \"I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''Avatar'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun\".<ref name=\"NYMag\" /> The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.<ref name=\"CastRuffalo1\" /> To create the Hulk's voice, Ruffalo's voice was blended with those of [[Lou Ferrigno]] and others;<ref name=\"soundworks\" /> however, the Hulk's only speaking line (\"Puny god.\") was provided solely by Ruffalo.<ref name=\"HulkVoice\" /> Ruffalo earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]: <br />The [[crown prince]] of [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]], based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] deity [[Thor|of the same name]]. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"MTVNews7\" /> Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, \"My body weight in protein pretty much!\"<ref name=\"EOnline\" /> He remarked that Thor's motivation \"is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it's some bad guy who they've gotta take down. It's a different approach for me, or for Thor. He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . . I've been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I'm the only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There's a bit of that.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> Hemsworth earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]]: <br />A highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"Johannson\" /> About the character and her relationship with Hawkeye, Johansson said, \"Our characters have a long history. They've fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries. We're the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors \u2013 we have no superpowers. Black Widow is definitely one of the team, though. She's not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy. She's there to fight, so I never felt like I was the only girl. We all have our various skills and it feels equal\".<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Regarding her training, Johansson said, \"Even though ''Iron Man 2'' was 'one-for-them,' I'd never done anything like that before. I'd never been physically driven in something, or a part of something so big. For ''The Avengers'', I've spent so many months training with our stunt team, and fighting all the other actors, it's crazy. I do nothing but fight\u2014all the time.\"<ref name=\"Biskind\" /> Johansson earned $4\u20136 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton / Hawkeye]]: <br />A master [[Archery|archer]] working as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"Renner\" /><ref name=\"ABCNews\" /> Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation.<ref name=\"WSJ\" /> About the role, Renner said, \"When I saw ''Iron Man'', I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes. Then they told me about this Hawkeye character, and I liked how he wasn't really a superhero; he's just a guy with a high skill set. I could connect to that.\"<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Regarding Hawkeye's sniper mentality, Renner said, \"It's a lonely game. He's an outcast. His only connection is to Scarlett's character, Natasha. It's like a left hand/right hand thing. They coexist, and you need them both, especially when it comes to a physical mission.\"<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> Renner said Hawkeye is not insecure about his humanity. \"Quite the opposite, he's the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his [tranquilizer-tipped] arrows. He knows his limitations. But when it comes down to it, there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero.\"<ref name=\"EW4\" /> Renner earned $2\u20133 million for the film.<ref name=\"CastPay\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]: <br />Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the Norse mythological deity [[Loki|of the same name]].<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> About his character's evolution from the film ''Thor'', Hiddleston said, \"I think the Loki we see in ''The Avengers'' is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up in ''The Avengers'', he's seen a few things.\"<ref name=\"HiddlestonInt1\" /> About Loki's motivations, Hiddleston said, \"At the beginning of ''The Avengers'', he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven't let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter5\" />\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: <br />An agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who oversees many of the division's field operations.<ref name=\"Gregg\" /> Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel.<ref name=\"Gregg2\" /> Gregg said his role was expanded in ''The Avengers'': \"[What] Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story, and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together, it kind of felt a little surreal, like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn't the real script. But it wasn't, it was the real thing, I got to show up and do that stuff, and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years.\"<ref name=\"Gregg3\" /> Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character's backstory, particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America.<ref name=\"Gregg3\" />\n* [[Cobie Smulders]] as [[Maria Hill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maria Hill]]: <br />A high-ranking agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Nick Fury.<ref name=\"SmuldersCostume\" /> Smulders, whom Joss Whedon once considered for his [[Wonder Woman in other media#Live action film|unproduced live-action Wonder Woman film]], was selected from a short list of potential actresses including [[Morena Baccarin]]. Smulders' deal would integrate her into nine films.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter3\" /><ref name=\"Variety3\" /> Regarding her preparation, Smulders said, \"I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun, take me to a shooting range, how to hit, how to hold myself, how to walk and basically how to look. I don't do a ton of fighting in the movie, which is why I wasn't offered a trainer, but I wanted to look like I had the ability to.\"<ref name=\"HIMYM\" /> On relating to the character, Smulders said, \"I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career. We're asked to do a lot of things these days. I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter4\" />\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />An astrophysicist and friend of Thor under Loki's control who is studying the Tesseract's power.<ref name=\"Expressen\" /><ref name=\"SSA\" /> Regarding Loki's control over Selvig, Skarsg\u00e5rd said, \"Well with the scene we did in ''Thor'', it was like Loki, one way or the other, entered Erik's mind. And in Avengers, you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik's mind.\"<ref name=\"SSA\" /> About his role, he said, \"[My character] is of importance but the size of the role is not big.\"<ref name=\"SSA\" />\n* [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]]: <br />The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the \"Avengers Initiative\". Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films.<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Jackson said he does more in ''The Avengers'' than in any of the previous films: \"You don't have to wait until the end of the movie to see me\". About the role, Jackson said, \"It's always good to play somebody [who] is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem.\" Jackson compared the character to Ordell Robbie in ''[[Jackie Brown]]'', calling him \"a nice guy to hang out with.

Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, \"It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with ''Avengers'' you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor [...] [Mixing] the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created\".<ref name=\"MTVNews2\" /> In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced [[Emily Blunt]] in portraying Natasha Romanoff in ''Iron Man 2'', a deal that subsequently attached her to ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Johannson\" /> The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later.<ref name=\"Cinematical3\" /> Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" />\n\nIn July 2009, Penn talked about the crossover process, stating, \"My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we're mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected. . . There's just a board that tracks 'Here's where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie'. . . I'm pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we're all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority\".<ref name=\"CraveOnline\" /> At first, Penn tried to reduce Thor's role in the script because he had doubts about the character's ability to succeed on film. He changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor.<ref name=\"PennMarch2018\" /> The film had always intended to use Loki as its villain, but Penn noted that early discussion had considered using [[Red Skull]].<ref name=\"RedSkull\" />\n\nIn January 2010, Marvel Studios chief [[Kevin Feige]] was asked if it would be difficult to meld the fantasy of ''Thor'' with the high-tech science fiction in ''Iron Man'' and ''The Avengers''. \"No,\" he said, \"because we're doing the [[Jack Kirby]]/Stan Lee/[[Walt Simonson]]/[[J. Michael Straczynski]] ''Thor''. We're not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library ''Thor''. And in the ''Thor'' of the Marvel Universe, there's a race called the Asgardians. And we're linked through this Tree of Life that we're unaware of. It's real science, but we don't know about it yet. The 'Thor' movie is about teaching people that\".<ref name=\"SuperheroHype2\" /> In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] and ''Avengers'' comic-book writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] had received copies.<ref name=\"MTVNews3\" /> Also in March, [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Evans\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=\"People forget that we started filming ''Avengers'' before either [[Thor (film)|''Thor'']] or [[Captain America: The First Avenger|''Captain America'']] were released.

He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer [...] It's part of his life so you know he is going to protect it [...] I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better\".<ref name=\"SuperheroHype3\" /> Feige added, \"I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it [...] we want[ed] to find a director that\u2019s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is.\"<ref name=\"MTVNews8\" /> Whedon stated at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], that what drew him to the film is that he loves how \"these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team\u2014and that is the definition of family\".<ref name=\"MTVNews4\" />\n\nWhen Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not \"have anything\" and they should \"pretend this draft never happened\".<ref name=\"WhedonMoviefone\" /> Part of Whedon's issue was the lack of character connections in Penn's draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin \"at square one\".<ref name=\"ThrillistApril2018\" /> Whedon went on to write a five-page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline \"Avengers: Some Assembly Required\", riffing on the \"Avengers Assemble\" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the film done for its May 2012 release.<ref name=\"WhedonMoviefone\" /> The script would go through \"a lot of insane iterations of what might be\" according to Whedon. Whedon explained there was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he \"wrote a huge bunch of pages starring [[Wasp (comics)|The Wasp]]\",<ref name=\"ThrillistApril2018\" /> and wanted [[Zooey Deschanel]] to play the character.<ref name=\"Deschanel\" /> He also was \"worried that one British character actor [(Hiddleston)] was not enough to take on Earth's mightiest heroes, and that we'd feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft with [[Zeke Stane|Ezekiel Stane]], [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]]'s son, in it.\" Once all of the actors were \"locked in place the movie stayed on mission.\" Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the [[X-Men]]. He felt \"these guys just don't belong together\" before realizing their interactions could be like ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967). Whedon also referenced ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964), ''[[The Abyss]]'' (1989), ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), and ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he \"fought\" for sole credit and was \"very upset about it.\" Penn felt the two \"could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that.\"<ref name=\"ThrillistApril2018\" />\n\n[[File:Joss Whedon looking right.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Joss Whedon at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\nThe casting process continued into much of 2010, with the additions of [[Jeremy Renner]],<ref name=\"Renner\" /> [[Mark Ruffalo]],<ref name=\"Ruffalo\" /> and [[Clark Gregg]].<ref name=\"Gregg\" /> Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back.<ref name=\"HitFix\" /> \"We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in ''The Avengers'',\" stated Feige. \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. ''The Avengers'' demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks.\"<ref name=\"HitFix2\" /> In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it \"purposefully misleading\" and an \"inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light\".<ref name=\"HitFix3\" /> In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.<ref name=\"NortonTHR\" />\n\nIn August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February.<ref name=\"SuperheroHype4\" /> In October 2010, [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]]<ref name=\"LIBN\" /> and the [[Steiner Studios]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, were announced as filming locations,<ref name=\"NewsdayGrumman\" /> with set construction slated to begin in November,<ref name=\"LIBN\" /> but as Whedon later explained, \"Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque.\"<ref name=\"filmfestivaltraveler\" /> Also that October, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] agreed to pay Paramount at least $115&nbsp;million for the worldwide distribution rights to ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013) and ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Variety2\" /> The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8&nbsp;percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit\u2014placement of the company's [[production logo]] on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads \"Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures\" though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's [[Epix (TV network)|Epix]] retained pay TV rights.<ref name=\"Variety4\" />\n\nIn December 2010, Governor of New Mexico [[Bill Richardson]] and Marvel Studios Co-president [[Louis D'Esposito]] announced ''The Avengers'' would film primarily in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan,<ref name=\"FilmNewMexico\" /> but a plan to film in [[Detroit]] ended after Governor [[Rick Snyder]] issued a budget proposal that would eliminate a film tax incentive.<ref name=\"DetroitFreePress\" /> Three months later in March, Governor of Ohio [[John Kasich]] announced before Mayor [[Frank G. Jackson]]'s State of the City address that ''The Avengers'' would film in [[Cleveland]].<ref name=\"Cleveland\" />\n\nConcept illustrator and designer of Iron Man's Mark VII armor Phil Saunders stated that \"Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the 'cool' factor of the suitcase suit [from ''Iron Man 2''], while still being a fully armored, heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle.\" To that end, Saunders borrowed ideas that had been proposed in ''Iron Man&nbsp;2'' as well as some ideas that had been abandoned in ''Iron Man'' and merged them together in a modular suit that has big ammo packets on the arms and a backpack.<ref name=\"Marvel4\" /> The [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] also provided science consultation for the film.<ref name=\"SEE\" />\n\nCasting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, [[Cobie Smulders]] was cast in the role of Maria Hill,<ref name=\"Variety3\" /> after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, who Samuel L.

A Marvel spokesperson later told [[TMZ]] that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set.<ref name=\"TMZ\" /> The following month, [[second unit|secondary filming]] took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler area]].<ref name=\"Vancheri\" /> A chase sequence was also shot in [[Worthington, Pennsylvania]] at [[Creekside Mushrooms|Creekside Mushroom Farms]], the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.<ref name=\"Vancheri2\" />\n\nProduction relocated to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming took place over a period of four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City's [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] to be used in climactic battle scenes.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo\" /> [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] soldiers assigned to the [[Columbus, Ohio]]-based [[200th Military Police Command (United States)|391st Military Police Battalion]] provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, \"It's easy for us to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms. The director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging\".<ref name=\"Army\" /> Filming also took place in the large [[vacuum chamber]] at the [[Glenn Research Center|NASA Plum Brook Station]] near [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. The station's [[Space Power Facility]] was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility.<ref name=\"Sandusky2\" /> A series of explosions were filmed at the [[Chevrolet]] powertrain plant in [[Parma, Ohio]] as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo2\" /> Scenes from the film were also shot on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] and the [[Detroit\u2013Superior Bridge]].<ref name=\"Sangiacomo3\" /> Public Square's southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany for filming.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo4\" />\n\nPrincipal photography concluded in New York City, where filming occurred over two days.<ref name=\"Sangiacomo5\" /> Locations there included [[Park Avenue]] and [[Central Park]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHype5\" /><ref name=\"CentralParkFilming\" /> For scenes taking place in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to \"get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also making sure that the effects work doesn't look too computer-generated\". \"We're getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments,\" Morrison explained, \"but there is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need.\"<ref name=\"ARRI1\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Seamus McGarvey]] stated that he composed the frame with a 1.85:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] to cope with the main characters' varying heights, explaining, \"shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [Whedon] knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important.\" The film was McGarvey's first venture with a digital camera, the [[Arri Alexa]].<ref name=\"ARRI2\" /> The [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]] and [[Canon EOS 7D]] [[digital single-lens reflex camera|digital SLR cameras]] were used for some shots,<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter13\" /><ref name=\"Canon7D\" /><ref name=\"Canon DSLRs\" /> and [[high-speed photography|high-speed]] shots were captured on [[35 mm movie film|35 mm film]] with the [[Arriflex 435]]. About his visual approach, McGarvey remarked, \"Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery.\"<ref name=\"ARRI2\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn December 2011, Disney announced that the film would be [[2D to 3D conversion|converted]] to 3D.<ref name=\"Deadline2\" /> Said Whedon, \"I'm not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies \u2013 I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years.\" Whedon also said that \"there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D\" but \"''The Avengers'' isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway\".<ref name=\"Sampson\" /> In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for [[IMAX 3D]] and would open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opened in regular theaters. The IMAX release followed Marvel's IMAX releases of ''Iron Man 2'' and ''Thor''.<ref name=\"IMAX\" />\n\nIn a May 2012 interview, Whedon said that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. \"He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [comic book] was ''Avengers Annual'' #7 (1977) that [[Jim Starlin]] did followed by ''[[Marvel Two-in-One|Marvel Two-in-One Annual]]'' #2 (1977) that contained the death of [[Adam Warlock]]. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'\"<ref name=\"Thanos\" /> An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown.<ref name=\"EW post-credits\" /> Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release.<ref name=\"Shawarma1\" /><ref name=\"Shawarma2\" /><ref name=\"Shawarma3\" /> Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]] dies in [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]]'s arms in the ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' episode, \"[[A Hole in the World]]\". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors [[Amy Acker]] and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, \"went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events,\" which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.<ref name=\"ShawarmaAngelInspiration\" />\n\n[[File:The Avengers Hulk motion capture.jpg|thumb|left|Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk (bottom) wearing a [[motion capture]] suit and prosthetics on his upper half to simulate the Hulk's size<ref name=\"ScreenCrush\" />]]\nThe film contains more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Weta Digital]], [[Scanline VFX]], [[Hydraulx]], Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, [[Luma Pictures]], [[Cantina Creative]], Trixter, [[Modus FX]], Whiskytree, [[Digital Domain]], The Third Floor, and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man and the Hulk. To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, aimed for a \"less cartoony\" depiction of the Hulk compared to the one the firm created for [[Ang Lee]]'s [[Hulk (film)|2003 film]], stating, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\nILM digitally recreated the vast majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted eight weeks.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager on the film, helped by securing the rights to almost every building's likeness in the area ILM needed.<ref name=\"ThrillistApril2018\" /> Disney and [[Sony Pictures]] agreed for [[Green Goblin|OsCorp]] Tower from ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012) to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.<ref name=\"latino-review\" />\n\nWeta Digital took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" /> Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.<ref name=\"fxguide\" />\n\nScanline VFX completed the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from the moment Black Widow and Captain America arrive on the carrier deck to the point where it lifts off. Evil Eye Pictures composited digital backgrounds into shots filmed against a greenscreen for scenes taking place inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause of Hydraulx said, \"We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space\" including Loki's arrival on Earth and subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures worked on shots featuring the Helicarrier's bridge and incorporated the graphic monitor displays that were developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX completed shots taking place in and around Tony Stark's penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain created the asteroid environment, where Loki encounters The Other.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> Method Design in Los Angeles created the film's closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, said, \"This piece was a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG. For each of the shots in the sequence, we designed, modeled, textured, and lit all of the environments and many of the foreground objects. We received assets from Marvel to include in the piece, then heavily re-modeled and re-surfaced them to create a post-battle macro sequence. We also designed a custom typeface for the Main Title of ''The Avengers'' as well as 30 credits set in-scene.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|The Avengers (soundtrack){{!}}''The Avengers'' (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nIn November 2011, Marvel announced that [[Alan Silvestri]], who scored ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', would write and compose the score for ''The Avengers''. Silvestri said, \"I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together.\"<ref name=\"Silvestri\" /> Silvestri developed the score with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, England.<ref name=\"SXSW1\" /> Whedon said, \"The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Hans Zimmer]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.\"<ref name=\"SXSW1\" />\n\nIn March 2012, the Indian rock band [[Agnee (band)|Agnee]] released a music video for its single \"Hello Andheron\", which serves as the theme song for the film's Indian release.<ref name=\"Agnee\" /> [[Hollywood Records]] released the soundtrack [[concept album]] inspired by the film, ''Avengers Assemble'', on May 1, 2012, the same day as the score.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n===Trailers===\nThe film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, during which a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L.

Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines\".<ref name=\"CBR\" /> However, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it, \"Awesome.

An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company's involvement with the film, \"As you may know, Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for ''The Avengers''. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced.

This led to confusion over the film's actual title. ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine reported that the film would be titled ''Marvel Avengers Assemble''<ref name=\"AvengersAssemble2\" /> while ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that it would be called simply ''Avengers Assemble''.<ref name=\"AvengersAssemble\" /> Marvel's UK website refers to the film as ''Marvel's Avengers Assemble'',<ref name=\"MarvelUK\" /> although David Cox of ''[[The Guardian]]'', in arguing that it was one of the worst film titles ever, considered this to be an error in the production notes, albeit grammatically clearer.<ref name=\"Cox\" /> According to the [[British Board of Film Classification]] and the [[Irish Film Classification Office]], the title is ''Marvel Avengers Assemble''.<ref name=\"BBFC\" /><ref name=\"IFCO\" /> [[Frank Lovece]] in FilmFestivalTraveler.com addressed the discrepancy, writing, \"''The Avengers'' \u2014 formally titled ''Marvel's The Avengers'' onscreen, though no apostrophe-s appears on [the posters]\".<ref name=\"filmfestivaltraveler\" /> Producer Kevin Feige said there are only two words in the UK title, one more than in the U.S. title, and stated that \"decisions like that aren't made lightly and there are lots of marketing research, lawyers and things that get into the mix on it\".<ref name=\"digitalspy\" />\n\nThe film's world premiere was April 11, 2012, at Hollywood's [[El Capitan Theatre]].<ref name=\"premiere\" /> ''The Avengers'' closed the 11th Annual [[Tribeca Film Festival]] with a screening on April 28.<ref name=\"Tribeca\" /> The film received an expanded one-week theatrical push for the 2012 U.S. [[Labor Day]] weekend, increasing the number of theaters from 123 to 1,700.<ref name=\"LaborDayPush\" /> ''The Avengers'' was the last film released in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseOne\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]<ref name=\"HM Magazine1\" /><ref name=\"Bluray6\" /> on [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[Blu-ray 3D]], [[DVD-Video|DVD]], and [[Digital copy|digital download]] on September 25 in the United States and as early as August 29 in various international markets.<ref name=\"Bluray\" /><ref name=\"Bluray5\" /> Producer Kevin Feige said the Blu-ray features a new [[Marvel One-Shots|Marvel One-Shot]] titled ''[[Item 47]]'' (2012) and \"a number of deleted scenes and a few storylines that fell by the wayside during the editing process\" including \"a few more scenes with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill, played by Cobie Smulders\" and \"some slightly different versions of Maria Hill and Nick Fury's interaction with the World Security Council\".<ref name=\"Bluray3\" />\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"Bluray2\" /> It was released on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"Bluray4\" /><ref name=\"Boxset release\" /> Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on August 14, 2018.<ref name=\"UltraHDRelease\" />\n\nSome fans have criticized the UK DVD and Blu-ray release for omitting Joss Whedon's audio commentary, and for altering the scene involving Phil Coulson's death from the film's theatrical version.<ref name=\"UKBluray\" /> Disney's UK division said the \"less graphic depiction of Agent Coulson's confrontation with Loki\" occurred because \"[e]ach country has its own compliance issues relative to depictions of violence. Unfortunately, another region's elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release\".<ref name=\"UKBluray\" />\n\nUpon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the [[Nielsen VideoScan]] First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart with 72% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray, a record for a new release in which both the DVD and Blu-ray formats were released simultaneously.<ref name=\"Bluray6\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Avengers'' grossed $623.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $895.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.519 billion,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of all time]],<ref name=\"third highest news\" /> the [[2012 in film|highest-grossing film of 2012]], the highest-grossing comic book adaptation, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film ever released by Walt Disney Studios, at the time of its release.<ref name=\"highest-Disney\" /> The film's worldwide opening of $392.5&nbsp;million was the fourth-largest.<ref name=\"world-open\" /> ''The Avengers'' also became the fifth film distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Disney]] and the twelfth film overall to earn more than $1&nbsp;billion.

But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again.\"<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter9\" /> To ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' journalist [[Peter Travers]], the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. \"It's also the blockbuster,\" Travers said, \"I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's ''[[Transformers (film series)|Transformers]]'' with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor.\"<ref name=\"rollz\" /> Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story.\"<ref name=\"Variety6\" /> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' complimented the film's frenetic pace,<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /> while [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' commented that it \"provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable\".<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> Conversely, [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' believed that \"while ''The Avengers'' is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nThe performances of several cast members was a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators.
