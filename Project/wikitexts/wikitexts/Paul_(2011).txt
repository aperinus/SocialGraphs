Starring Pegg and Frost, with the voice and [[motion capture]] of [[Seth Rogen]] as the titular character, the film follows two science fiction geeks who come across an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]. Together, they help the alien escape from the Secret Service agents who are pursuing him so that he can return to his home world. The film is a [[parody]] of other science-fiction films, especially those of [[Steven Spielberg]], as well as of [[science fiction fandom]] in general.\n\nIt is a British-American venture produced by [[Working Title Films]], [[StudioCanal]], [[Big Talk Productions#Big Talk Pictures|Big Talk Pictures]] and [[Relativity Media]], and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Paul'' was released on 14 February 2011 in the United Kingdom and on 18 March 2011 in the United States to generally positive reviews from critics, and grossed $98 million worldwide on a $40 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nBest friends Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings are British [[comic book]] and sci-fi enthusiasts who travel to the United States to attend the annual [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. They embark on a road trip through the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern U.S.]] to visit [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] sites on a remote desert highway at night. \n\nAfter a brush with homophobic rednecks at a diner, they watch a car driving erratically and crashing. Stopping to offer assistance to the driver, he is revealed to be Paul, an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]. Graeme agrees to give him a ride, despite Clive fainting and wetting his pants upon seeing him.\n\nLater, Special Agent Zoil of the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] arrives at the car-crash site, informing his unseen female superior, \"the Big Guy\", that he is closing in on Paul. She sends rookies Haggard and O'Reilly to assist. Clive remains paranoid over Paul's intentions, considering his appearance as evidence of a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]]. Then Paul explains the government fed his image to the public to keep them from panicking if anyone encounters his race.  \n\nThey later camp at an [[RV park]] run by [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]], one-eyed Ruth Buggs and her father Moses. The next day, when Ruth sees Paul, she faints, so they take her with them. During an argument, Paul convinces Ruth to question her beliefs and uses his healing power to cure her blind eye.\n\nStopping at a bar, Ruth calls her father, but Zoil intercepts the call. She is accosted by the rednecks and a bar fight ensues. They escape when Paul terrifies them into fainting. Later, at another RV park, Ruth is questioned by Agent Zoil, but plays dumb and escapes. Meanwhile, Haggard and O'Reilly have figured out about Paul. Confronting Zoil, he orders them to return to base, but they go behind his back and try to catch the alien on their own.\n\nThe group soon arrives at Tara's, who rescued Paul when he crashed on Earth 60 years ago, accidentally killing her dog (hence Paul's name) in the crash (opening scene). As no-one believed her story, she has spent her life as a pariah. Although angry at first, she forgives Paul and prepares to make tea for her visitors. Haggard, O'Reilly and Zoil arrive and surround the house. The group flee but O'Reilly shoots at them, igniting gas from Tara's stove and destroying her house with him inside. Haggard pursues and catches up to the RV but loses control and drives off a cliff. Zoil reassures the Big Guy that he will have Paul within the hour but tired of waiting, she orders a \"military response\".\n\nPaul, Graeme, Clive, Ruth and Tara arrive at [[Devils Tower|Devils Tower National Monument]], where they set off fireworks to signal Paul's mothership. A helicopter suddenly arrives with agents and the Big Guy. Zoil appears and initiates a stand-off, unexpectedly shooting the agents, before being wounded. He is revealed to be Paul's friend, attempting to aid his escape under the guise of capturing him. During the fight, Tara knocks out the Big Guy. Moses arrives unexpectedly and fires at Paul, but hits Graeme instead. Paul once again uses his healing powers, reviving Graeme in spite of the danger to himself, causing Moses to believe Paul to be a [[messiah]].\n\nGraeme and Ruth admit their feelings for each other and kiss, but the Big Guy regains consciousness and holds the group at gunpoint. Just as she is about to kill them, she is crushed by the landing transport ship. Paul says goodbye to his friends and offers Tara a chance to go with him, promising to give her a new life after ruining her childhood and accidentally killing her dog. The aliens go home as the remaining humans wave. Two years later, Graeme, Clive and Ruth are at another Comic-Con, where Graeme and Clive are promoting their new bestselling novel titled ''Paul''.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Seth Rogen 2013.jpg|right|thumbnail|195px|Prominent [[comedy|comedic]] actor [[Seth Rogen]] provided the voice work and [[motion capture]] for Paul the alien (pictured in 2013).]]\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Graeme Willy\n* [[Nick Frost]] as Clive Gollings\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Paul (voice and [[motion capture]])<ref name=\"paul\">{{cite news| date= 2009-05-26| first= Michael\n| last= Fleming| title= Seth Rogen to voice 'Paul' for Pegg| url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118004183.html| work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| access-date= 2009-06-18}}</ref>\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Special Agent Lorenzo Zoil.

One problem is that Mr. Rogen, however comically inclined, has become overexposed, and there\u2019s just something too familiar and predictable about this voice coming out of that body. Yet while Paul seems great conceptually, he's not particularly interesting or surprising, despite a funny recap of what he\u2019s been doing on his time on Earth. With his vibe and vocabulary, shorts and weed, [[juvenilia]] and sentimentality, Paul turns out to be not much different from a lot of guys who have wreaked comedy havoc on American screens lately, even if this one only wants to beam up, not knock up.\"<ref>{{cite news| title=Calm Down, People; He Comes in Peace | date= March 17, 2011 | first=Manohla |last= Dargis| author-link= Manohla Dargis| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/movies/paul-he-comes-in-peace-review.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826050217/https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/movies/paul-he-comes-in-peace-review.html |archive-date=2015-08-26 | access-date=2022-02-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
