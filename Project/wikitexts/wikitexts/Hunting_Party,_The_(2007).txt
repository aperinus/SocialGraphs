The working title for this film was ''Spring Break in Bosnia'' before being changed to ''The Hunting Party'' during post-production.\n\n''The Hunting Party'' had its world premiere at the [[64th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 3, 2007.  The film turned out to be a huge commercial disappointment domestically, grossing only US$969,869 in US theatres.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with a disclaimer: ''Only the most ridiculous parts of this story are true''.\n\nAfter years of covering one armed conflict after another, American journalist Simon Hunt is in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in early 1994 reporting on the [[Bosnian War]]. In parallel, he has managed to romance a local [[Bosnian Muslims|Muslim]] girl who is pregnant with his child. However, in the late stages of her pregnancy, she is killed by the [[Bosnian Serbs|Bosnian Serb]] forces when they overrun her village. Upon seeing the carnage, Simon vows revenge on the Bosnian Serb political leader Dragoslav Bogdanovi\u0107 \u2014known as \"The Fox\".\n\nReporting on the gruesome event later that day in a live remote link-up, Simon loses his composure at the [[News presenter|network anchor]] Franklin Harris' suggestion that the Serb attack may have been a reaction to Muslim provocation attacks from inside the village. As a result of his on-air meltdown, Simon's journalistic career takes a tumble. While his professional prospects spiral downhill, those of his long-time camera man Duck go in the opposite direction. Duck gets a cushy job at the network, while Hunt is left following war after war, as a [[freelance journalist|freelancer]], in an attempt to get back on the US network television map.\n\nIn fall 2000, Duck, now a professional, travels to [[Sarajevo]] to a \"puff piece\" of the network anchor Franklin Harris covering the fifth anniversary of the [[Dayton Agreement]], along with the fresh-out-of-[[Harvard University|Harvard]] young journalist, and son of the network vice-president, Benjamin. Duck runs into his old buddy Simon. Once a US network star reporter, Simon is, by this point, a desperate half-drunk cynic reduced to filing freelance reports for underfunded news outlets in places like [[Jamaica]] and [[Poland]].\n\nAll the while, Simon's looking for a story big enough to propel him back to the realm of credibility. He tells Duck that, through a source, he has located Bogdanovi\u0107, who is now wanted for war crimes with a US$5 million [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on his head, and that he'd be interested in trying to score an interview with the fugitive. The Fox is assumed to be in the village of [[\u010celebi\u0107i (Fo\u010da)|\u010celebi\u0107i]], in the [[Republika Srpska|Serbian entity of Bosnia]], near the border with [[Montenegro]], with various stories circulating about him, such as that he enjoys [[fox hunting]] (hence the nickname) and that the head of his security detail is a ruthless psychopath with a tattooed forehead.\n\nConvinced by Simon, Duck comes along to shoot the interview, with Benjamin in tow. On the way, Simon confesses his plan to capture the Fox to collect the bounty \u2014 something Duck and Benjamin consider insane even to think about. Along the way, the group is mistaken for a [[CIA]] hit squad by several groups, including the [[United Nations]] police force and the Serbs themselves; at one point, at the initiative of Benjamin, they claim to be CIA agents themselves, using a threat to avoid paying a fee for a tip. Still, Boris, the local area UN commander, puts them in touch with a woman claiming to have been romantically involved with the Fox's main bodyguard Sr\u0111an.\n\nSimon, Duck, and Benjamin are then captured by the Fox's guards and taken to a barn to be executed where [[axe]]-wielding Sr\u0111an \u2014 who has the phrase \"''\u0443\u043c\u0440\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0452\u0435\u045a\u0430''\" (\"died before birth\") tattooed on his forehead in Cyrillic alphabet \u2014 is preparing to kill them through torture. At the last moment, a team of CIA assassins, tipped off by Boris, storms the barn and frees the journalists, but Fox escapes. It quickly becomes evident to the journalists that, even in the international community, there are people who do not wish the Fox to be captured.\n\nThe CIA orders the journalists to board an airplane bound for the US, but they run away to carry out their plan to catch the Fox. They capture him while he is hunting in the woods without his guards. The journalists then release him, with his hands securely bound, in a village called Polje filled with the surviving family members of victims of his war crimes, where he is lynched by the vengeful mob.\n\nAs the film ends, before the closing credits, the screen goes to black and the following message is shown:\n\n''In theory, the official hunt for war criminals in Bosnia continues to this day...However, the two most wanted men \u2014 [[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107]] and [[Ratko Mladi\u0107]], continue to elude the U.S, The [[United Nations]], The [[European Union]], [[NATO]], [[The Hague]] and all in the civilized world who claim to be looking for them. In the ten years that Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 has been on the run, he has published two books and one play. Perhaps if the International Community opened a summerstock theatre...But they're probably too busy \"searching\" for [[Osama Bin Laden]]''{{sic}}.\n\nRatko Mladi\u0107 was arrested on 26 May 2011, and Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 was arrested in Belgrade on 21 July 2008 and brought before Belgrade's War Crimes Court a few days later.\n\nThe film ends and is then followed by a montage of people and events seen in the movie with words such as, \"really existed\", flashed across the screen as various characters are shown throughout the film.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Simon Hunt\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as \"Duck\"\n* [[James Brolin]] as Franklin Harris\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Benjamin Strauss\n* [[Ljubomir Kereke\u0161]] as Dr. Dragoslav \"The Fox\" Bogdanovi\u0107\n* [[Kristina Krepela]] as Marta\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as Mirjana\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Boris, Local UN Commander\n* Zdravko Ko\u010devar as Sascha\n* Sne\u017eana Markovi\u0107 as Una\n* [[Goran Kosti\u0107]] as Sr\u0111an, Fox's Main Bodyguard\n* [[Miraj Grbi\u0107]] as Goran, Thug #1\n* R.

The film  is, in fact, very loosely based on the events depicted in an ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine article by American journalist [[Scott Anderson (novelist)|Scott Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findingkaradzic.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_archive.html |title=Karadzic-hunting now going Hollywood: 'Spring Break in Bosnia' due for 2006 release |website=Findingkaradzic.blogspot.com |date=2004-04-22 |access-date=2010-05-21|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722163209/http://findingkaradzic.blogspot.de/2004_04_01_archive.html|archive-date=2012-07-22}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite news|last=Anderson |first=Scott |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/summer-vaction-1000 |title=What I Did on My Summer Vacation |magazine=Esquire |date=2000-10-01 |access-date=2010-05-21}}</ref> Published in October 2000 under the title \"What I Did on My Summer Vacation\",<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> the article talks about a group of five Western war-reporters who reunited in [[Sarajevo]] during April 2000 and, over some drinks at a local bar one night, decided to make a half-hearted attempt at catching the accused war criminal and fugitive [[Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107]]. In addition to Anderson, the group consisted of two more Americans, [[Sebastian Junger]] and [[John Falk (journalist)|John Falk]], as well as Dutchman {{Interlanguage link multi|Harald Doornbos|nl}} and [[Philippe Deprez]] from [[Belgium]]. Other than alcohol, the starting point for their \"manhunt\" was an article in local weekly newsmagazine ''[[Slobodna Bosna]]'' notorious for sensationalist reporting that claimed Karad\u017ei\u0107, along with his heavily armed security detail, had been spotted in the village of [[\u010celebi\u0107i (Fo\u010da)|\u010celebi\u0107i]] in [[Republika Srpska]] (Serbian entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina) near the border with [[Montenegro]].\n\nBefore going into \u010celebi\u0107i, the party of five journalists first came to the nearby town of [[Fo\u010da]], where they inquired about the safety of their trip among the locally stationed [[United Nations|UN]] personnel. They soon caught the eye of a well-connected local UN officer from [[Ukraine]] who became convinced they were a covert crew sent in to apprehend Karad\u017ei\u0107 and decided to help them out by putting them in touch with a supposedly high-ranking Serbian secret police officer. The journalists decided to play along, and after returning from an uneventful visit to \u010celebi\u0107i, they arranged a meeting with the Serbian secret policeman who, too, was convinced they were a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Black Operation]]s team. He also claimed to have an intimate knowledge of Karad\u017ei\u0107's movements and whereabouts, and in return for ratting him out he wanted American passports for himself, his wife, and their four kids, as well as a cut of the bounty prize.\n\nDespite being not at all convinced of the honesty and sincerity of either the Ukrainian UN officer or the Serbian secret policeman, the journalists decided to play along even further, thus setting in motion a chain of events that in the end led to local [[NATO]] officials, American embassy personnel, and apparently even top American security officials from overseas getting involved.\n\nScott Anderson's conclusion at the end of the article was that UN and NATO not only exhibited little interest in actually finding Karad\u017ei\u0107, but they also actively sabotaged any such meaningful attempt from within their own ranks.\n\nWhen he was discovered, however, Karad\u017ei\u0107 turned out to be hiding in disguise and alone.\n\nJunger, Falk, Doornbos, and Deprez make cameo appearances in the movie as unnamed journalists in the press pack.\n\n==Reception and reaction==\n\n===United States===\nCritical reaction to ''The Hunting Party'' was mixed.

Still, the movie turned out to be a commercial disappointment domestically, grossing only [[US$]]969,869 in US theatres.\nIt opened small, on September 7, 2007, initially being shown only on four screens in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]]. It gradually expanded to other parts of USA over the following weeks, first to 40 screens, and then to 329. It ended its US theatrical life some six weeks after its release.\n\n===Europe===\nAlmost simultaneously to the US, ''The Hunting Party'' was released in [[Turkey]] on September 14, 2007. Released as ''Av Partisi'', in its two months at Turkish theaters, the movie managed to gross US$424,048.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=huntingparty.htm |title=The Hunting Party |website=Box Office Mojo |date=2009-04-12 |access-date=2010-05-21}}</ref>\n\nNext up was [[Germany]] on November 29, 2007, where it was released as ''Hunting Party \u2013 Wenn der J\u00e4ger zum Gejagten wird'' (\"When the Hunter Becomes the Hunted\") and grossed US$203,705 during just under a month at the theaters.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nOn November 29, 2007, the movie was also released in [[Croatia]]. Its release in that country is particularly notable because most of the movie was shot there and the only two non-Hollywood actors with significant roles in it are [[Croats]] Kristina Krepela and Ljubomir Kereke\u0161. However, the movie received mostly lukewarm reviews in the Croatian media with mainstream print daily ''[[Jutarnji list]]'' reviewer [[Nenad Polimac]] criticizing the stock character portrayal of its villain - The Fox - as a stereotypical Hollywood baddie while suggesting the end product would've been a lot better had the movie been shot verbatim according to Anderson's original magazine article without the application of the Hollywood makeover. Additionally, Polimac's review longs for the days when \"prestigious films like ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'' and ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' were being shot here\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/clanak/art-2007,11,28,hunting_party,99885.jl |title=Proma\u0161ena tema o lovu na Kard\u017ei\u0107a |website=Jutarnji |date=2007-11-28 |language=hr |access-date=2010-05-21}}</ref> The movie didn't fare much better in Croatian cyberspace, as Film.hr's Bo\u0161ko Picula complains: \"despite its smooth plot, rounded-off characters, commendable attempts at reaching the virtue of genuineness, and welcome flirting with the absurd, ''The Hunting Party'' fails when all of that needs to be put together into a logical unit\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.hr/vijest.php?tekst_id=718&PHPSESSID=9b0e4957db8c3a9846db20f20 |title=Lov u Bosni |website=Film.hr |language=hr |first=Bo\u0161ko |last=Picula |access-date=2010-05-21|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120801234621/http://www.film.hr/vijest.php?tekst_id=718&PHPSESSID=9b0e4957db8c3a9846db20f20|archive-date=2012-08-01}}</ref> while Film-Mag.net's Robert Juki\u0107 refers to the overall product as \"interestingly conceived, but poorly executed\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film-mag.net/content.php?review.3295 |title=KINO: LOV U BOSNI, avantura |website=F.I.L.M. |date=4 December 2007 |first=Robert |last=Juki\u0107 |language=hr |access-date=2010-05-21}}</ref> At present, there is no box-office data for Croatia.\n\nThe release in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]'s [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosniak-Croat part]], where the movie was partly shot, was originally scheduled for December 7, 2007, but one day before the premiere, it had to be postponed for a week due to technical difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/clanak/071206075 |title=Pomjerena premijera filma \"Lov u Bosni\" |website=Sarajevo-x.com |date=2007-12-06 |access-date=2010-05-21 |language=bs}}</ref> The movie was finally released on December 14, 2007, with a premiere showing at Sarajevo's Meeting Point cinema attended by screenwriter [[Zlatko Top\u010di\u0107]], film directors [[Danis Tanovi\u0107]] and Elmir Juki\u0107, as well as politician [[Bakir Izetbegovi\u0107]], among others.
