Based on the [[Joyce Carol Oates]] novel ''[[Foxfire: Confessions of a Girl Gang]]'', it examines the [[coming of age]] of four [[high school]] girls who meet up with a mysterious and beautiful drifter.\n\n==Plot==\nMaddie Wirtz is a high school senior living in the suburbs of [[Portland, Oregon]]. Her plans to coast through her last school year before college are waylaid when she meets another teenage girl, \"Legs,\" a drifter who takes shelter from the rain inside Maddie's school. The same day she meets them, Legs convinces Maddie and fellow students Rita Faldes and Violet Kahn to confront Mr. Buttinger, a teacher who has been sexually harassing Rita and Violet. Maddie, Rita, and Violet flee after the confrontation turns violent, witnessed by student Goldie Goldman, who flees with them. Later, Legs finds Maddie at her house from the address in a notebook Maddie dropped in Mr. Buttinger's classroom. Legs spends the night at Maddie's house and bonds with her further in the morning before school.\n\nAt school, Maddie, Rita, Violet, and Goldie are suspended for the confrontation of Mr. Buttinger, despite their explanation of what happened. After getting kicked out of school, the girls go to an abandoned house where Maddie suggested Legs stay, finding Legs there. All five girls quickly form a close bond, with the abandoned house as their \"headquarters\" and engaging in further acts of rebellion, such as breaking into the school to retrieve part of Maddie's art school application (which the principal refused to let her get before she got kicked out) and Legs tattooing a flame on all of them. Legs and Maddie also learn Goldie's father physically abuses her. Everything culminates when the girls crash a car stolen from a group of boys who were about to rape Maddie in \"revenge\" for what happened to Mr. Buttinger.\n\nThough not seriously injured, the girls go on trial for stealing the car, with the boys and one of their girlfriends, Cindy, lying about the events leading up to it. Legs is sent to a juvenile prison and the group flounders without her, with Goldie starting to use heroin. Eventually, Cindy, feeling guilty, tells the judge the truth, leading to Legs' release.\n\nThe girls' reunion is tempered by Legs learning of Goldie's addiction; Maddie has taken her to the abandoned house to detox. In an effort to help her, Legs leads Maddie, Rita, and Violet to Goldie's house to demand $10,000 from her parents to send Goldie to rehab. The situation escalates when Goldie's father refuses and Legs, holding him at gunpoint, forces the others to take him to the abandoned house. He is tied to a chair while the girls try to think of what to do next, and the tension rises as Legs begins taking her own paternal frustrations out on him. In the midst of the chaos, Rita accidentally shoots Goldie's father in the shoulder.\n\nPanic ensues and the girls resolve to get Goldie's father to the hospital. When Goldie, Rita, and Violet leave with Goldie's father, Maddie realizes Legs is missing. She finds Legs walking along the bridge, looking for a ride to another town. Both girls make proposals, Maddie for Legs to stay with her and the others and Legs for Maddie to join her on the road. Sad but resolute, the two eventually go their separate ways. Legs gets a truck to stop and boards as Maddie watches it disappear.\n\nIn a [[voice-over]], it is revealed that Maddie reunited with her boyfriend, finished high school, and went on to attend art school in [[New York City]]. She travels the world, always stopping at airports and bus stops along the way. Although none of the group ever see Legs again, they still get together once in a while and strengthen their bond over the past.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hedy Burress]] as Madeline \"Maddie\" Wirtz\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Margaret \"Legs\" Sadovsky\n* [[Jenny Lewis]] as Rita Faldes\n* [[Jenny Shimizu]] as \"Goldie\" Goldman\n* Sarah Rosenberg as Violet Kahn\n* Michelle Brookhurst as Cindy\n* [[Dash Mihok]] as Dana Taylor \n* [[Peter Facinelli]] as Ethan Bixby\n* [[Richard Beymer]] as Mr. Parks\n* [[Fran Bennett]] as Judge Holifield\n* [[John Diehl]] as Mr. Buttinger\n* [[Chris Mulkey]] as Dan Goldman\n* [[Jay Acovone]] as Chuck\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref name=\"ORfilm\">{{cite web\n | url=http://library.state.or.us/repository/2015/201505210910074/2015.pdf\n | title=Filmed in Oregon 1908\u20132015\n | work=Oregon Film Council\n | publisher=Oregon State Library\n | access-date=December 27, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has an approval rating of 27% based on reviews from 11 critics.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web |title=Foxfire |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1073285-foxfire |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0116353|Foxfire}}\n* {{AllMovie title|136503|Foxfire}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 drama films]]\n[[Category:1996 independent films]]\n[[Category:1996 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1990s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s female buddy films]]\n[[Category:1990s feminist films]]\n[[Category:1990s high school films]]\n[[Category:1990s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:American female buddy films]]\n[[Category:American feminist films]]\n[[Category:American high school films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American teen drama films]]\n[[Category:American teen LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Rysher Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michel Colombier]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
