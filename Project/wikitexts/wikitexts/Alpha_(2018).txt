Tau, its chief, trains his teenage son Keda, accepting him and Keda's friend Kappa to join the hunting party. His wife Rho worries that Keda is not ready, but Tau believes he is and the hunters set out.\n\nTau tests Keda by having him kill a [[wild boar]] they've caught, but Keda hesitates. One night, the party's fire draws the attention of a large [[Panthera spelaea|cave lion]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BqiCgdzn7T1/ | title=Alpha on Instagram: \"Get #AlphaMovie on Blu-ray, DVD & Digital to hear the cast and crew discuss the creation of the stunning visuals with visual effects, new language, extensive research on artifacts, costumes and more in \"Building the World.\"\" }}</ref> which lunges through their circle, snatching Kappa before anyone can do anything. Hearing the fatal struggle in the darkness, the tribe gives him up for dead. Kappa is given a memorial service in the form of a [[cairn]] to symbolize the passing of one's spirit to the afterlife.\n\nThe hunters eventually reach a herd of [[steppe bison]], which they attempt to stampede off a cliff with relative success. Amidst the chaos, the bull rushes towards Keda and tosses him over the edge, leaving him gripping the rough cliff edge with his hand. Keda loses his grip and plummets to a further ledge where he appears to break his leg and is knocked unconscious. Tau attempts to climb down to him, but he is stopped by fellow hunter Sigma who assures him in good faith that Keda is dead and there would be no way to reach him anyway. The tribe leaves and Tau performs another funeral ritual, stricken with grief.\n\nKeda is awoken by a vulture who mistakes him for dead. He kills the bird by wringing its neck and tries to climb the rest of the way down the cliff. A sudden heavy rainfall causes the ravine below to flood. Losing his grip, Keda falls into the water. He survives and splints his injured foot before returning to the top of the cliff. Seeing the memorial cairn left by his tribe, he realizes he must travel back to the village by himself.\n\nKeda is later attacked and chased by a pack of ferocious wolves, but escapes up a tree and wounds one of the pack members which the others leave behind. Keda takes pity on it and cares for its injury. Gradually gaining the wolf's trust, he gives it water and then food, establishing himself as dominant by feeding himself first. He sets out for the village without the wolf, but it follows him. Their relationship grows, and they learn to hunt animals together. Along the way, Keda names the wolf ''Alpha''.\n\nOne night, they are approached menacingly by a pack of wolves. Upon seeing Alpha, who steps forward to greet them, they recognize Keda's companion. The pack run off and with Keda's blessing, Alpha joins them. Keda continues his journey alone as the season changes into winter. On a frozen lake, he encounters a pack of wolves feeding on a carcass. Recognizing Alpha, he runs to them, but the ice breaks and he falls through. Alpha helps rescue him and they are reunited.\n\nContinuing the journey together, they find a man who has frozen to death outside his tent and scavenge a bow and arrow from it. Later, they take refuge from a pack of [[cave hyena]]s inside a cave. However, inside they are confronted and attacked by another cave lion, causing Alpha to violently fight the animal. Keda saves Alpha by using the bow to kill the lion with the arrow, although Alpha is badly wounded in the fight and now travels with difficulty. Meanwhile, an equally injured Keda begins to cough up blood. When Alpha finally cannot walk, Keda carries the wolf.\n\nKeda eventually finds his village while nearly passing out from exhaustion, and he reunites with his shocked but relieved parents who are amazed and proud of him. As the village healer tends to both Keda and Alpha's wounds, Alpha delivers a litter of puppies much to Keda's surprise, as Alpha is revealed to be female. Alpha and her pups are formally welcomed into the tribe and grow up in the care of Alpha and Keda. The final image of the film shows the tribe and their [[Origin of the domestic dog|domesticated wolves]], hunting together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] as Keda\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Tau\n* [[Natassia Malthe]] as Rho\n* [[Marcin Kowalczyk (actor)|Marcin Kowalczyk]] as Sigma\n* [[Jens Hult\u00e9n]] as Xi\n* [[Leonor Varela]] as Shaman\n* Mercedes de la Zerda as Nu \n* Spencer Bogaert as Kappa\n* Chuck as Alpha\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Narrator<ref>{{cite news|last=Brady|first=Tara|title=Alpha: Absorbing origins story for man's best friend|date=24 August 2018|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/alpha-absorbing-origins-story-for-man-s-best-friend-1.3603253?mode=amp|access-date=3 July 2019}}</ref> (in the cut of the film released in the United Kingdom and Ireland; as released in the U.S. Morgan Freeman has no role and there is no voice-over narration<ref>{{cite web |work=Variety |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/alpha-review-kodi-smit-mcphee-1202904941/ |author=Owen Gleiberman |title=Film Review: 'Alpha'  |date=2018-08-14 }}</ref><!-- see discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9aiumf/alpha_did_you_hear_a_narration_from_morgan/   -->)\n\n==Production==\nThe film was first announced in September 2015 as ''The Solutrean'', with Albert Hughes as director, produced by Studio 8.
