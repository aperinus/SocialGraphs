Elias Merhige|Edmund Elias Merhige]]. It stars Brian Salsberg, Donna Dempsy, Stephen Charles Barry, and members of Merhige's theatre company, Theatreofmaterial. The film contains no dialogue and employs a style similar in some ways to early silent films. Its enigmatic plot, drawn from elements of various [[creation myth]]s, opens with the suicide of a godlike figure and the births of Mother Earth and the Son of Earth, who set out on a journey of death and rebirth through a barren landscape. According to art historian Scott MacDonald, the film's [[Allegory|allegorical]] qualities and purposeful ambiguity invite multiple interpretations.\n\n''Begotten'' was first conceived as an experimental [[theatre]] piece with dance and live musical accompaniment, but Merhige switched to film after deciding that his vision would be too expensive to achieve as a production for live audiences. [[Antonin Artaud]] and philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were major influences on ''Begotten'', as Merhige believed their ideas and theories had not been explored in film to their full extent. The film's visual style was inspired by [[Georges Franju]]'s documentary short ''[[Blood of the Beasts]]'', [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', [[Stan Brakhage]]'s ''[[The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes]]'', and the [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] film ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]''. ''Begotten'' was shot on location in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] over a period generally thought to have been three and a half years {{endash}} although, in an interview, Merhige said filming took only five and a half months.\n\nOnce the film was finished, Merhige spent the next two years trying to find a [[film distributor|distributor]] willing to market it. Following its debut at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]], it was screened at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], where it was seen by film critics [[Tom Luddy]] and Peter Scarlet. They brought it to the attention of fellow critic [[Susan Sontag]], whose enthusiastic praise and private screenings of the film in her own home were instrumental to its eventual release. Though largely ignored by main-stream critics, it attained [[cult film]] status and influenced several [[avant-garde film]]-makers, visual artists and musicians. The film's scarcity on [[home video]] prompted its fans to spread their own [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] copies, a phenomenon described as a \"copy-cult\" by film studies scholar [[Ernest Mathijs]]. As the first part of a planned series, ''Begotten'' was followed in 2006 by ''Din of Celestial Birds'', a [[Short film|short]] sequel with the theory of [[evolution]] as its dominant theme.\n\n==Plot==\nInside a small shack, a robed figure {{endash}} dubbed \"God Killing Himself\" in the film's credits {{endash}} [[disembowelment|disembowels]] himself using a [[straight razor]]. After removing some of his internal organs, the robed god dies. A woman, [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]], then emerges from his mutilated remains. She brings the corpse to arousal and [[Artificial insemination|uses his semen to impregnate herself]]. Time passes and Mother Earth, now visibly pregnant, stands beside the [[coffin]] of the dead god. Wandering off into a vast and barren landscape, Mother Earth later gives birth to Son of Earth, a [[Malformation|malformed]] convulsing man. He is soon abandoned by his mother, who leaves him to his own devices.\n\nAfter an untold period of time wandering across the barren landscape, the Son of Earth encounters a group of faceless [[nomad]]s who seize him by his [[umbilical cord]]. Upon being captured, the Son of Earth begins to vomit up what appears to be organs, which the nomads excitedly accept as gifts. They then throw the man into a [[fire pit]], where he burns to death. Son of Earth is resurrected by Mother Earth, who comforts her newly reborn offspring before they continue together across the barren landscape. The nomads soon return and proceed to attack the Son of Earth as Mother Earth stands in a [[trance]]-like state. Turning their attention to her, the nomads knock her to the ground, rape, and murder her as her son watches helplessly near-by.\n\nOnce the nomads have left, a group of robed figures arrive to carry away Mother Earth's mutilated, disemboweled remains. The group returns to murder and disembowel her son, placing pieces of both mother and son into jars, which they bury into the crust of the earth. As time passes, the burial site soon becomes lush with flowers. A montage of grainy photographs depicting God Killing Himself are shown. In the final scene, Mother Earth and her son appear in a flash-back, wandering through a forested path.{{sfn|Merhige 1991}}\n\n==Cast==\n* Brian Salzberg as God Killing Himself:\n:A mysterious, robed entity who disembowels himself with a straight razor. He is also the father of Mother Earth and Son of Earth, the latter of which was born through artificial insemination.\n* Donna Dempsey as Mother Earth:\n:A female entity based on the earth deity of the same name. She is the mother of Son of Earth, whom she conceived via artificial insemination. \n* Stephen Charles Barry as Son of Earth (Flesh on Bone):\n:The deformed, convulsing son of Mother Earth and God Killing Himself. Barry would later reprise his role in the film's sequel, ''[[Din of Celestial Birds]]'', which was also written and directed by Merhige.{{sfn|Turner Classic Movies 2006}}\n\nMembers of Merhige's theater company Theatreofmaterial \u2013 which included Adolpho Vargas, Arthur Streeter, Daniel Harkins, Erik Slavin, James Gandia, Michael Phillips, and Terry Andersen {{endash}} provided additional credits for other characters in the film such as the Nomads and Robed Figures.{{sfn|Merhige 1991}}\n\n==Themes==\nCritics have identified several major themes in ''Begotten''. In interviews, Merhige himself has acknowledged that he intentionally incorporated these themes into the film, while also inviting viewers to form their own interpretations of the film.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=289}}\n\n===Death and rebirth===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Language Bearers, Photographers, Diary makers<br/>\nYou with your memory are dead, frozen<br/>\nLost in a present that never stops passing<br/>\nHere lives the incantation of matter<br/>\nA language forever.<br/>\nLike a flame burning away the darkness<br/>\nLife is flesh on bone convulsing above the ground.\n| source = \u2014 The opening [[intertitle]] for the film, suggesting the film's themes of life and death.\n| bgcolor=#E0FFFF\n| align = right\n| width = 35%\n}}\nSeveral critics have noted that ''Begotten'' contains an underlying theme of death and rebirth,{{sfn|Stephens|2000}}{{sfn|Mapes|2004}}{{sfn|DiMatteo|1991|p=2}} recurring throughout most of the director's works.{{sfn|Dutka|2004a|p=51}} In an interview with Marty Mapes of ''Movie Habit'', Merhige stated, \"I've always believed in the continuity of consciousness. I don't think the body dying means it's over. It just means that there's a transformation taking place. So what we call physical death is not something that I think is some sorrowful loss.\"{{sfn|Mapes|2004}}\n\nIn her review of Merhige's third film ''[[Suspect Zero]]'' for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Elaine Dutka noted that themes of death and rebirth that appeared throughout the director's works might have been inspired by a [[near-death experience]] Merhige had suffered during his youth at age nineteen.{{sfn|Dutka|2004a|p=51}}{{sfn|Dutka|2004b|p=67}} Author and independent filmmaker [[John Kenneth Muir]] pointed out the film's ideas of suffering, death, and rebirth as being exemplified in the Son of Earth's journey. As Muir noted, the character's mistreatment, through various means intentionally drew parallels to mankind's 'painful' toil and reshaping of the earth for the purpose of planting [[Field (agriculture)|crops]], which represented the bringing forth of life through suffering. Muir also pointed out the film's characters as visualized symbols of certain concepts of mankind and the earth itself, with the depictions of life, death, and renewal as representing the [[seasons|four seasons]].{{sfn|Muir|2011|p=141}} Film and literary scholar William E.B. Verrone also noted these themes, pointing out that, as the viewers, we are encouraged to mourn the film's characters (father/mother/son) through the agony and torment inflicted upon them. Verrone further elaborates that through these depictions of death and violence, we are then symbolically  \"offered salvation\" in its depiction of the blossoming flowers seen growing on their graves.{{sfn|Verrone|2012|p=157}} In the book ''Contemporary North American Film Directors: A Wallflower Critical Guide'', co-author [[Jason Wood (writer)|Jason Wood]] noted that the film's \"evocation of the body as the source of horror and decay\" was redolent of surreal works by [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] and early [[David Lynch]]. Wood also compared the film's grainy look and landscapes to the recurring themes of hopelessness and desolation in the works of [[Russia]]n filmmaker [[Aleksandr Sokurov]].{{sfn|Wood|2002|p=374}}\n\n===Religion, mythology, and the occult===\n[[File:Atalanta Fugiens - Emblem 2d.jpg|thumb|right|The film incorporates several mythological/religious themes including the character of Mother Earth, which is loosely based on [[Earth goddess|the deity of the same name]] and [[Mary, mother of Jesus]].|alt=A 17th century [[alchemy|alchemical]] depiction of Mother Earth, a goat and wolf [[Breastfeeding|breast-feeding]] human children]]\nMany critics have pointed out the film's incorporation of various religious and mythological themes and events from [[Christian mythology|Christian]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], and [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] [[mythology]] including various [[Creation myth]]s, [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]], and other religious themes, on which the events that take place in the film are loosely based.{{sfn|''MovieMaker'' 2007}} Merhige, a firm believer in [[alchemy]] and [[hermeticism]],{{sfn|Riefe 2020}}{{sfn|Riefe 2021}} has acknowledged that the film was deliberately arranged to appear as part of a mythology.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=286}} According to film and literary scholar William E.B. Verrone, ''Begotten''{{'}}s core storyline was a mixture of ancient mythologies that dealt with stories and themes, such as the birth of a divine entity and their subsequent suffering through various means, citing the film as \"a cryptic [[passion play]] about Earth's birth and torture\". Verrone went on to explain that the film's highly symbolic and metaphorical plot was intended to evoke a response different than that offered in more traditional cinematic offerings.{{sfn|Verrone|2012|p=154}} Art historian Scott MacDonald pointed out that the film's highly allegorical plot represents many of the popular attitudes towards both the origins of life and religion, which have been put forth over the span of several centuries. MacDonald also interpreted the film's plot as the [[death of god]] or deity, and the birth and rape of Nature.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=290}} In their book ''Cult Cinema: An Introduction'', film studies scholars [[Ernest Mathijs]] and Jamie Sexton noted that the film \"makes perhaps the most serious attempt to visualize elements of [[Dionysian]] orgiastic cultism in combination with [[Gnostic]] and pagan myths\".{{sfn|Mathijs|Sexton|2011|p=140}} Robert DiMatteo pointed out the film's ritualistic and religious aspects such as the idea of \"God's eye\".{{sfn|DiMatteo|1991|p=2}}\n\nThe film's opening sequence shares many similarities with various creation myths, specifically those in which life is generated from the corpse or dismemberment of an originator deity.{{sfn|Leonard|McClure|2004|pp=32\u201333}}{{sfn|Savlov|2009}} Art historian Herbert S. Lindenberger felt that Merhige had reworked myths that [[social anthropologist]] and [[folklorist]] [[Sir James Frazer]] had published during the [[Victorian era]]. Lindenberger also noted the film's inclusion of themes taken from [[Christianity]] such as the \"buried god\", his resurrection, and the inclusion of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|god's mother]].{{sfn|Aldama|Lindenberger|2016|p=165}}\n\n[[Janet Maslin]]  of ''[[The New York Times]]'' categorized the film as a mixture of ancient mythologies, which were reworked in what she called \"visceral, monstrously immediate terms\".{{sfn|Maslin|1991}} Film critic [[Richard Corliss]] from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' pointed out that it contained multiple references to [[Druidism]].{{sfn|Mathijs|2017|pp=20\u201421}}{{sfn|Corliss|1991|p=69}} Corliss also noted the film's mixture of druidism with several biblical stories such as the Creation (Genesis), the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's torture/death]].{{sfn|Verrone|2012|p=157}}{{sfn|Corliss|1991|p=69}}\n\n==Influences==\nMerhige was informed by the theories and ideas of [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], which in his opinion had not been developed on film to the fullest extent.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} His key cinematic influences included [[Andrzej Munk|Munk]], [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]], and Bu\u00f1uel.{{sfn|Maslin|1991}}  In a 1993 interview with art historian Scott MacDonald, Merhige also listed [[Georges Franju]]'s documentary short ''[[Blood of the Beasts]]'' as an inspiration for the visual style of the film, as well as [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', [[Stan Brakhage]]'s ''[[The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes]]'', and the [[German Expressionism|German expressionist film]] ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]''.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=292}} Merhige also stated that \"fine arts had far more of an influence on this project than film. The horrific beauty you find in [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or [[Edvard Munch|Munch]] or [[Goya]] got to me more than anything.\"{{sfn|Hart|1992|p=39}}\n\nCritics have identified a variety of other possible influences.{{sfn|Stephens|2000}} [[Film critic]] Eric D. Snider has pointed out that David Lynch's ''[[Eraserhead]]'' might also have influenced the film's visual style.{{sfn|Snyder|2011}} While comparing ''Begotten''{{'}}s opening sequence to the eye slicing scene in Bu\u00f1uel's ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'', ''[[Film Comment]]''{{'}}s Robert DiMatteo also noted [[Dimitri Kirsanoff]]'s ''[[M\u00e9nilmontant (1926 film)|M\u00e9nilmontant]]'', [[tribal art]], [[ethnographic studies]], [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', as well as the paintings of [[Piero della Francesca|Piero Francesca]] as possible influences on the film.{{sfn|DiMatteo|1991|p=2}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and pre-production===\n{{Quote box|width= 40%|align=right|quote=The writing for ''Begotten'' was all Vision material, or whatever you want to call it, and I used those parts that scared me, or that I just couldn't understand{{emdash}}the parts that stuck with me for days and forced me to wonder ''where'' within ''me'' did ''this'' come from? A tableau of the unknown was important to me. Then it was a matter of arranging this material as a myth. That was important, too. It began as a personal myth and ended as a collective myth, a myth of everyone involved in making the film.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=286}}|source = Writer{{emdash}}director [[E. Elias Merhige]] on the development of the film's script}}\n\n''Begotten'' was written, produced, and directed by Merhige,{{sfn|Maslin|1991}} with development for the film beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s,{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} although some sources list the date as 1984.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1995}} Merhige had studied at [[New York State University]], and soon developed an interest in the theater after attending several performances while in [[Manhattan]]. Merhige would later state in an interview that he had been drawn towards the use of performers creating a highly visualized form of storytelling through dramatic movement to provoke, what Merhige called, \"an otherworldly response\". He was particularly fascinated by a Japanese [[dance troupe]] called [[Sankai Juku]] which, the director later learned, consisted of a handful of core members that were well in tune with one another, knowing each other completely on both a professional and personal level. Wanting to accomplish a similar group dynamic,{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=285}} Merhige founded Theatreofmaterial, a small [[Theatre production|theater production company]] based in [[New York City]].{{sfn|DiMatteo|1991|p=2}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=285}} \nAfter working on several different [[Experimental theatre|experimental theater productions]], he began developing his next project, which was initially for the theater. As Merhige would later recall, the initial concept for the film was envisioned as a dance production at the [[Lincoln Center]], which would have been set to a live orchestra. It was only after discovering that it would cost a quarter of a million dollars to produce{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} that the decision was made to adapt the script for a motion picture instead of a theater production.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}}\nMerhige also wanted to document the company's work, as many of its members were transitioning to other projects.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=286}} Interviewed in 2013 by horror film magazine ''[[Fangoria]]'', Merhige revealed that the film itself had also been an attempt to document many of the thoughts and ideas he was going through at the time, believing that if he did not \"get it out there\" they would overwhelm him.{{sfn|Beahm|2013|p=32}}\n\nStill only twenty at the time, he wrote the film's script in six months.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} Before working on ''Begotten'', he had previously made several [[short film]]s such as ''Implosion'' (1983), ''Spring Rain'' (1984), and ''A Taste of Youth'' (1985).{{sfn|Quigley|2007|p=325}} These were well-received, and gave the director the experience and insight he needed while working on ''Begotten''.{{sfn|Wood|2002|p=374}} Merhige developed the film's script with members of Theatreofmaterial, who worked as both cast and crew during production. They decided that the film should be silent and that they would strive to evoke what the director called \"emotions on the fringes\", which they felt were avoided by most directors and actors. In preparation for writing the script, Merhige and members from Theatreofmaterial performed intense, ritual [[breathing exercises]] as a group. As Merhige explained, \"We would breathe to the point of [[hysteria]] and create these moments of panic. Afterwards, we would analyze what the experience was all about. It was an intimate science.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=286}} He brought portions of the script to the cast members and began a process of rehearsals followed by group discussion and reflection on the material as it took shape. Over a period of four-and-a-half months, the group gradually translated the script's abstract ideas into more concrete, enactable scenes, though Merhige emphasized that the rehearsals were focused on group cohesion rather than precise choreography.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=286}} Merhige later revealed to ''UltraCulture'' host Jason Louv that he strove to imbue the film with the same tribal and ritual aspects associated with alchemical and hermetic traditions. To that end he worked closely with the film's cast, experimenting with various techniques such as [[hypnosis]] and [[meditation]] in order to help the cast achieve a mental state of what he called \"universal stream\" rather than having the actors simply mimic those aspects.{{sfn|Louv|2015|loc=10:23\u201312:33}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place in the mid-to-late 1980s,{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} over a period of three-and-a-half months{{refn|name=Note3|group=Note|In an interview with Scott MacDonald, Merhige alternately stated that filming spanned over a period of five-and-a-half months.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=286}}}} in several different locations. Merhige filled multiple roles in the film's production, including work on [[cinematography]], and [[special effects]],{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} the latter using a [[16 mm film|16{{nbsp}}mm]] [[Arri]]flex camera on [[black and white|black-and-white]] [[reversal film]].{{sfn|DiMatteo|1991|p=2}}{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} He had previously worked on several short film subjects before developing ''Begotten''. The opening sequence depicting the robed figure (listed in the credits as \"God Killing Himself\") disemboweling himself and Mother Earth emerging from his remains was the first to be shot. The sequence was then edited and shown to the cast and crew, whose reactions to the footage was very enthusiastic, with Merhige stating: \"it proved to everyone that this ''was'' an important film, that there really was nothing else like it, and we were actually going to make it happen.\" Most of the cast and crew were paid little to nothing, with their forms of payment being free room and board, and Merhige himself paying for all of their expenses.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=287}} In his book ''Film Out of Bounds: Essays and Interviews on Non-Mainstream Cinema Worldwide'', film historian Matthew Edwards cited ''Begotten'' as an example of low-budget films outside of Hollywood which displayed unique flair and artistry that rivaled most Hollywood productions, in spite the fact that they were made under a very low budget.{{sfn|Edwards|2007|p=20}}\n\nA majority of the film was shot at a construction site on the border between [[New York City]] and [[New Jersey]], where Merhige had been given permission to shoot for a period of twenty days when construction crews were not working. Members of the construction site would occasionally lend the film crew a hand by constructing landscapes when certain shots of mountains were needed during a scene.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=290}}{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} Scenes involving [[Time-lapse photography|time-lapse]]s of sunrises and sunsets were shot by the director,{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=290}} who spent a couple of days alone in the mountains near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] or [[Albuquerque]].{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} Funding for the film came from Merhige's grandfather, who had set Merhige up with a trust fund for medical school.{{refn|name=Note4|group=Note|A total of approximately $20,000.{{sfn|''LA Weekly''|1994|p=43}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=287}}}} Additional costs were paid by Merhige from income he received while working multiple jobs as a special effects artist.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=287}} Merhige described working on the film as being a powerful, almost ceremonial experience that \"changed the lives of all those involved\" with the project.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}}\n\n===Post-production and visual effects===\n[[File:Begotten,1990 film, screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A long shot depicting the sillouette of six figures kneeling before a seventh figure|The film's distinctive decayed aesthetic was accomplished through intense [[Photographic processing|processing]] through an [[optical printer]].

These jobs had provided him with the technical knowledge{{emdash}}and savings{{emdash}}he needed to handle the film's [[post-production]] and [[visual effects]] on his own.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=287}}\n\nThe visuals have a decayed look, as if the film itself were an artifact that has been damaged and degraded over vast stretches of time; Merhige said\n\n{{blockquote|I wanted ''Begotten'' to look, not as if it were from the twenties, not even as if it were from the nineteenth century, but as if it were from the time of Christ, as if it were a cinematic [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea Scroll]] that had been buried in the sands, a remnant of a culture with customs and rites that no longer apply to this culture, yet are somewhere ''underneath'' it, under the surface of what we call \"reality.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=288}}}}\n\nBefore and during the film's shooting, he had experimented with the reel to give it an old, withered look. In one such experiment, he ran the unexposed [[Negative (photography)|negative]] against sandpaper to scratch its surface before shooting.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} Unsatisfied with the results, Merhige decided to use an [[optical printer]] for further processing. The \"rephotography\" removed almost all of the [[Grayscale|gray midtones]] from the footage's visible spectrum, leaving only extreme contrasts of black and white.{{sfn|Beahm|2013|p=32}} He was unable to find an optical printer priced within his budget, so he built one himself.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=287}}{{sfn|Hoberman|2003|p=91}}{{sfn|Kaufman|2001}} He constructed the printer over a period of eight months{{sfn|Merhige|2009}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=287}}{{sfn|Hoberman|2003|p=91}} with spare parts from camera stores and special effects houses where he had worked before.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=287}}{{sfn|Hoberman|2003|p=91}}\n\nThe process proved to be time-consuming.

Eventually, he found a small studio willing to accommodate his requests: Kin-O-Lux Labs, located on Manhattan's [[48th Street (Manhattan)|48th Street]] and owned by a German-American ''[[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]'' named Fred Schreck.{{refn|name=Shreck|group=Note|No relation to famed German actor [[Max Schreck]], the subject of Merhige's later film ''Shadow of the Vampire''.{{sfn|Stephens|2000}}}} Merhige quickly developed a friendship with Schreck, who allowed the director to use the laboratory to develop the footage while teaching him how to develop footage by hand.{{sfn|Stephens|2000}} Schreck's name appears under \"special thanks\" in the film's [[closing credits|end credits]].{{sfn|Merhige 1991}} At one point during the editing process, Merhige enlisted his father's input on certain scenes, stating that his father was \"very open-minded\" to the project.{{sfn|''MovieMaker'' 2007}} Merhige used similar \"rephotography\" techniques for segments of his next film, ''[[Shadow of the Vampire]]''.{{sfn|Kaufman|2001}}{{sfn|Atkinson|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Soundtrack===\n''Begotten'' contains no dialogue.{{sfn|Mathijs|2017|p=20}} Merhige envisioned \"a time that predates [[spoken language]]\", in which \"communication is made on a sensory level.\"{{sfn|Mathijs|2017|pp=20\u201421}}{{sfn|Mathijs|Sexton|2011|p=163}} The film's [[soundtrack]] {{endash}} including [[sound effect]]s and music {{endash}} was composed and [[Audio mixing|mixed]] by Evan Albam.

The soundtrack took a year to complete.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} The music is [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[dirge]]-like, and the [[sound design]] is fleshed out by [[natural sounds]] such as [[Bird vocalization|bird calls]], insect noises, and [[Heart sounds|the sounds of a heartbeat]].{{sfn|Hart|1992|p=39}}{{sfn|Kane|1991|p=39}}\n\n==Release==\n===Distribution===\nOnce editing for ''Begotten'' was completed, Merhige spent two years trying to find a distributor willing to market and release it.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} Merhige screened the film to possible distributors but most refused to release the film as it did not fit into a specific genre, making it difficult to bring the film to market.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=291}} Merhige later recalled, \"When I first went looking for distribution, everyone laughed at me, saying 'We don't know what this is...'\"{{sfn|Beahm|2013|p=33}} Merhige then took it to a number of museums in hopes of eventually finding a distributor. In the end, only two showed any interest, but both were turned down by Merhige who felt that they would not have been the right choice. As a result, Merhige became very protective of the film, only showing it to people he felt he could trust.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=291}} Through these private screenings, film critics [[Tom Luddy]] and Peter Scarlet would eventually view the film, becoming fascinated by its distinct visual style.{{sfn|DiMatteo|1991|p=2}} Although uncertain how the film would be received, Luddy and Scarlet were able to put together several screenings of the film at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]],{{sfn|Stephens|2000}} before showing the film to fellow critic [[Susan Sontag]].{{sfn|Nicolay|2016}} Sontag, who set up a private screening at her home for twenty of her closest friends, would become one of the ''Begotten''{{'}}s leading advocates and instrumental for its eventual theatrical release.{{sfn|Merhige|2009}} Sontag later brought a copy of the film to the [[Berlin Film Festival]] where she informally screened it to interested cin\u00e9astes, proclaiming it to be an artistic masterpiece.{{sfn|Simon|2001}} During one of Sontag's screenings, it was supposedly viewed by director [[Werner Herzog]], whom Merhige later claimed was \"very supportive of the film\".{{sfn|Merhige|2009}}\n\n===Theatrical screenings===\n[[File:Japantown-AMC-Pagoda.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph showing the exterior of a large multiplex cinema|The US premiere of ''Begotten'' occurred at the 1990 [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], where it was screened at the [[Japantown, San Francisco|Japantown]] [[AMC Kabuki 8|Kabuki{{nbsp}}8]] multiplex (''pictured in 2005'').{{sfn|''San Francisco Examiner''|1990|pp=20\u201321}}]]\n\nUnable to find a distributor, ''Begotten'' did not attain either [[Wide release|wide]] or [[Limited theatrical release|limited]] theatrical release.
