The film was written and directed by Keaton and [[Edward F. Cline]], and runs for 19 minutes. [[Sybil Seely]] co-stars. The film contains a large number of innovative visual gags largely pertaining to either the house or to ladders.\n\nIn 2008, ''One Week'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997810.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | work=Variety | title='Terminator' joins Film Registry | first=Cynthia | last=Littleton | date=December 30, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=May 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:One Week Screenshot.png|left|thumb|Buster Keaton One Week title card]]\n[[File:Keaton One Week 1920.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Keaton admires his build-it-yourself house]]\n\nThe story involves a newlywed couple who receive a build-it-yourself house as a wedding gift. The house can be built, supposedly, in \"one week\". A rejected suitor secretly re-numbers packing crates. The groom struggles to assemble the house according to this new \"arrangement\". The result is a lopsided structure with revolving walls, kitchen fixtures on the exterior, and upper-floor doors that open onto thin air. During a housewarming party on [[Friday the 13th]], a storm spins the house and its occupants around like a merry-go-round.\n\nAs if this were not enough, the couple find they have built the house on the wrong lot and must move it. They manage to move it on rollers but it stalls on railroad tracks. The couple try to move it out the way of an oncoming train, which eventually passes on the neighboring track. As the couple look relieved, the house is immediately struck and demolished by another train coming the other way. The groom stares at the scene, places a 'For Sale' sign with the heap (attaching the building instructions) and walks off with his bride.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Buster Keaton]] as the groom\n* [[Sybil Seely]] as the bride\n* [[Joe Roberts (actor)|Joe Roberts]] as piano mover\n\n== Production ==\n===Development===\n''One Week'' was likely inspired by ''Home Made'', an educational short film produced by the [[Ford Motor Company]] in 1919 to promote [[Prefabricated building|prefabricated housing]]. Keaton used numerous elements seen in the film, including \"the wedding, the Model T and the use of the pages from a daily calendar to show the house being built in one week\" in his comic parody.{{sfn|Keaton|Vance|2001|p=68}} Years later, Keaton told an interviewer that the film's title is a play on ''[[Three Weeks (book)|Three Weeks]]'', a notorious 1907 sex novel by [[Elinor Glyn]].{{sfn|Meade|2014|p=65}} Keaton reportedly joked that it was \"one-third as scandalous\".\n\nKnopf notes that ''One Week'' is Keaton's first attempt to move away from a plot-driven narrative, as he employed in his earlier film ''[[The High Sign]]'', toward mining more and more gags from a few basic elements\u2014in this case, the house and ladders.{{sfn|Knopf|1999|pp=45, 47}} According to [[Kevin Brownlow]], ''One Week'' \"set the style for all the future Keatons; the opening gag sequence ... the slow build-up ... the frenetic climax ... and then that climax outmatched by the final sequence\". Furthermore, the film lay the basis for the cinematic techniques of his future films: \"The simple setups, the flat comedy lighting, the spare use of titles\u2014and the overall excellence of the direction\".{{sfn|Brownlow|1968|p=43}}\n\nAccording to [[Eleanor Keaton]], Buster originally thought to combine two of his two-reel films, ''One Week'' and ''[[The Boat (1921 film)|The Boat]]'' (1921), into a four-reeler charting a young couple's adventures. [[Virginia Fox]], who had been hired for the latter film, was replaced with [[Sybil Seely]] who had starred in ''One Week''. However, the idea of combining the films never came to fruition.{{sfn|Keaton|Vance|2001|p=84}}\n\n===Casting===\nSybil Seely plays the young bride in her film debut.{{sfn|Keaton|Vance|2001|p=69}} The mischievous rival (\"Handy Hank\") is an unknown actor.{{sfn|Neibaur|Niemi|2013|p=31}} [[Joe Roberts (actor)|Joe Roberts]] has a brief bit as a strong-man piano mover.\n\n===Filming and special effects===\nMany special effects, such as the house spinning around during a storm and the train collision, were filmed as they occurred and were not model work. The house was constructed on a turntable so that it could spin around during the storm scene.{{sfn|Keaton|Vance|2001|p=69}}{{sfn|Knopf|1999|p=49}} The train collision was filmed at the [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] train station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://silentlocations.com/2011/10/04/busters-trains-one-week-to-speak-easily/|title=Buster's Trains \u2013 One Week to Speak Easily|first=John|last=Bengtson|author-link=John Bengtson|publisher=silentlocations.com|date=October 4, 2011|access-date=January 11, 2021}}</ref>\n\nKeaton reused the gag of the side of a building falling on him, but emerging unscathed in the opening of a window in the wall, from the [[Fatty Arbuckle]]\u2013Keaton film ''[[Back Stage (1919 film)|Back Stage]]''; he would reuse the same joke in ''[[The Blacksmith]]'' (1922) and ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]'' (1928).{{sfn|Keaton|Vance|2001|p=17}}\n\nKeaton's fall down two stories after stepping out of the bathroom was one of the few times he injured himself badly. His arms and back swelled up a few hours after the filming. His physical trainer gave him both hot and cold showers and then treated the swelling with olive oil and horse [[liniment]].{{sfn|Keaton|Vance|2001|p=69}}\n\nThe film is noted for a risqu\u00e9 (for its time) scene involving Seely's character taking a bath. She drops a bar of soap out of the tub and waits until (as a [[fourth wall]]-breaking gag) someone's hand is placed over the camera lens so she can lean out and retrieve it.{{sfn|Neibaur|Niemi|2013|p=23}} Although intended as a joke, the scene has appeared in a number of documentaries as an example of [[Pre-Code sex films|pre-Hays Code]] censorship.\n\n==Release==\n''One Week'' was released on September 1, 1920.{{sfn|Knopf|1999|p=181}} It is noted as the first of Keaton's independent releases, although he had filmed ''[[The High Sign]]'' earlier. Keaton considered the latter film an inferior effort to debut with, and released it the following year when he was convalescing from an injury.{{sfn|Keaton|Vance|2001|p=66}}\n\n''One Week'' was one of the top-grossing releases of 1920.{{sfn|Meade|2014|p=65}}\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' review said: \"''One Week'', a Buster Keaton work, has more fun in it than most slap-stick, trick-property comedies\".<ref name = \"NYT Review\">{{Citation | title = The Screen | newspaper = New York Times | pages = 22 | date = October 25, 1920}}</ref> ''[[The Star Press|The Muncie Evening Press]]'' wrote: \"Buster Keaton's 'One Week' is one of the funniest pictures ever made and plants Buster firmly on his feet as star\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67406845/muncie-evening-press/|title=Theaters|newspaper=[[The Star Press|The Muncie Evening Press]]|date=May 24, 1921|page=6|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}{{open access}}</ref> ''[[The Santa Clarita Valley Signal]]'' wrote: \"If Buster Keaton in 'One Week' broke loose in a museum he'd tickle the mummies to life again.
