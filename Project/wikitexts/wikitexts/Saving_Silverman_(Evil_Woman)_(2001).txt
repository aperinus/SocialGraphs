[[Neil Diamond]] has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo role]] playing himself. In the film, Darren Silverman's longtime friends try to save him from marrying his controlling new girlfriend, whose behavior threatens the friends, their band, and Darren's chance at happiness with his lifelong true love.\n\nThe film was remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Thotti Gang]]'' in 2002 and [[Hindi]] as ''[[De Taali]]'' in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nDarren Silverman, Wayne LeFessier, and J.D. McNugent, best friends since fifth grade and [[Neil Diamond]] fans throughout, form a Neil Diamond [[tribute band]] called \"Diamonds in the Rough\".\n\nThrough a chance encounter in a local bar after a band gig, Darren meets Judith Fessbeggler, a beautiful but domineering [[psychologist]] who shows signs of being [[emotional abuse|emotionally abusive]]. Six weeks into their relationship, Darren asks her if they could finally have sex, but Judith refuses until marriage. She suggests non-penetrative sex instead, so Darren gets nothing but a sore jaw.\n\nJudith isolates Darren from his friends, demands that he quit the band, receive humiliating medical procedures, and attend relationship counseling under her care. Wayne and J.D. decide to save Darren from her by attempting to bribe her, arm wrestle her, and finally shock her with faked photographs of Darren cheating, all to no avail.\n\nThe friends, undaunted, try to reunite Darren with his \"one and only\", Sandy Perkus, when she returns to Seattle before she takes her final vows as a nun. When Darren and Judith announce their engagement, Wayne and J.D. kidnap her. However, she discovers the identity of her captors, and the duo are convinced they cannot let her go.\n\nWhen they visit Coach Norton in jail (who accidentally killed a referee with a football signal pole in a fit of rage) he suggests they just kill her. The pair attempt to shoot Judith, but end up deciding against it. Sandy's feelings for Darren are reawakened, but their attempted date is ruined by his preoccupation with Judith. Sandy, disheartened, returns to the convent, but Darren snaps out of it and runs the 30 miles there to win her back.\n\nChained to an engine block in Wayne's garage, Judith helps J.D. realize he is gay. She knocks him unconscious to steal his keys and escape, only to be [[Tranquilizer gun|tranquilized with a dart gun]] by Wayne. Returned to the garage, Judith seduces him into releasing one of her hands, so she escapes again. She runs to Darren's house in time to see him kiss Sandy, but shames him into confessing his engagement to her. Sandy, disappointed, returns to the convent again.\n\nDarren has Wayne and J.D. arrested. Escaping from jail with Coach Norton's help, J.D. and Wayne rush to the convent on the brink of Sandy's final vows as a nun. Convincing her that Darren still loves her, they then kidnap Neil Diamond to help Darren and Sandy reunite.\n\nAt the wedding, Neil stalls the proceedings with the song [[Hello Again (Neil Diamond song)|\"Hello Again\"]] while Darren and Sandy reunite. Wayne and Judith (the latter being furious that her wedding is ruined) beat each other up (as love play) and J.D. arrives holding Coach in his arms, who coincidentally reveals to J.D. that he too is gay. The couples then wed on stage at Neil Diamond's concert; Darren to Sandy, Wayne to Judith, and J.D. to Coach.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Darren Silverman\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Wayne Lefessier\n* [[Jack Black]] as J.D.

The differences between the two versions are mostly dialogue changes and small additions to certain scenes, although two new scenes do appear, with some other scenes in the movie swapped around to compensate for the longer run time. A Blu-ray version was finally released through Mill Creek Entertainment on July 13, 2021 in a bare-bones package that contained no bonus features from the earlier DVD releases. Additionally, this format's packaging claims the film is PG-13, but actually contains the R-rated cut of the movie.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0239948}}\n* {{AllMovie title|234652}}\n\n{{Dennis Dugan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saving Silverman}}\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2001 black comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:2001 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Seattle]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Dennis Dugan]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related black comedy films]]\n[[Category:Village Roadshow Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Original Film films]]\n[[Category:2001 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
