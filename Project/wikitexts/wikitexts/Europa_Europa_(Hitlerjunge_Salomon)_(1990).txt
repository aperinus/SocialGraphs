It is based on the 1989 autobiography of [[Solomon Perel]], a [[Germany|German]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] boy who escaped [[the Holocaust]] by masquerading as a [[Nazi]] German and joining the [[Hitler Youth]]. Perel himself appears briefly as himself in the film's finale. The film\u2019s title refers to [[World War II]]\u2019s division of continental [[Europe]], resulting in a constant national shift of allegiances, identities, and [[front line]]s. The film is an [[international co-production]] between the German company [[CCC Film]] and companies in [[France]] and [[Poland]].\n\nThe film is not be confused with the 1991 [[Lars von Trier]] film ''[[Europa (1991 film)|Europa]]'', which was released as ''Zentropa'' in the United States to avoid confusion. ''Europa Europa'' won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] in 1992.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1938 [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], thirteen-year-old Solomon \"Solek\" Perel is taking a bath on the eve of his [[Bar and bat mitzvah|bar mitzvah]] when ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' occurs. Solek evades the Nazis, but returns home to find his sister Berta has been killed. His father decides the Perel family will move to his birthplace of [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] in central [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], as he believes it will be safer there. Less than a year later, [[World War II]] begins with the German [[invasion of Poland]]. Solek's family decides he and his brother Isaak should flee to [[Eastern Europe]]. Isaak and Solek head for the eastern border of Poland, only to find that the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviets have invaded]]. The brothers are separated and Solek ends up in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] orphanage in [[Grodno]] with other Polish refugee children.\n\nSolek lives in the orphanage for two years, where he joins the [[Komsomol]], receives [[Communism|Communist]] education and learns [[Russian language|Russian]]. He takes a romantic interest in Inna, a young and attractive instructor who defends him when the authorities at school discover Solek's class origin is [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]. Zenek, a Polish [[Catholic Church in Poland|Catholic]] boy whose father was captured by the Soviets, antagonizes Solek for being a [[Eastern European Jewry|Jew]] and accuses him of being a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]]. Solek receives a letter from his parents informing him of their imprisonment in the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto]].\n\nSolek is captured by German soldiers during the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] and finds himself amongst a group of Soviet prisoners. As the German soldiers single out the Jews and [[commissars]] for execution, Solek hides his identity papers and tells the Germans he is \"Josef Peters\", a ''[[Volksdeutsche]]r'' from a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] family in [[Latvia]]. The soldiers deduce that \"Josef\" was in the orphanage because his parents were killed by the Soviets and promise him vengeance. The unit adopts Solek as their interpreter due to his fluency in German and Russian.\n\nSolek avoids any public bathing or urinating, as his [[circumcision|circumcised penis]] would expose him as a Jew. Robert, one of the soldiers, sneaks in on Solek while he bathes. Robert reveals he is [[homosexual male|homosexual]] and promises solidarity to Solek, as both have secrets that the Nazis would kill them for. During combat, Robert is killed and Solek, the lone survivor of his unit, attempts to reach the Soviet lines. As he crosses a bridge, the unit charges across behind him and the Soviet troops surrender; Solek is hailed as a hero. The company commander decides to adopt Solek and send him to the elite [[Hitler Youth]] Academy in [[Braunschweig]] to receive a Nazi education.\n\nAt the school, \"Josef Peters\" is introduced to the other boys as a heroic combat veteran. Solek manages to avoid baring himself through several methods, and attempts to disguise his circumcision with string and rubber bands to simulate a foreskin. During class, a Nazi \"expert\" in [[scientific racism|racial science]] uses Solek as a subject to determine his [[anthropometry|anthropometric indices]], declaring him to be of \"pure [[Aryan race|Aryan]] stock\". Leni, a member of the [[Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del]] who serves meals at the Academy, becomes infatuated with Solek. He returns Leni's affections, but does not consummate their relationship for fear of exposing himself. The two eventually part ways after Leni makes a violent [[anti-Semitic]] remark to Solek.\n\nDuring his leave from the Academy, Solek travels to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to find his family; however, the ghetto is sealed off and guarded by the ''[[Feldgendarmerie]]''. Solek rides a tram that travels through the ghetto, observing horrific sights of tortured and starved people. He spots an elderly woman resembling his mother, but is unable to get closer to the woman. Later, Solek visits Leni's mother, who does not sympathize with the Nazis. She tells him Leni is pregnant by Solek's roommate, Gerd, and intends to give up the child to the ''[[Lebensborn]]'' program. When Leni's mother presses Josef on his identity, he breaks down and confesses he is Jewish; she tells him she had suspected but promises not to betray him. He does not see Leni again.\n\nSolek is summoned to the [[Gestapo]] offices and is nearly exposed when he is prodded about his supposed parentage and is asked to show a Certificate of Racial Purity. When Solek claims the certificate is in Grodno, the Gestapo official says he will send for it and then rants about how the war will be won by [[Hitler]]'s ''[[Wunderwaffen]]''. As Solek leaves to meet with Gerd, the building is destroyed by Allied bombs; Solek's relief is tempered by Gerd's death in the bombing.\n\nAs Soviet troops close in on [[Berlin]], the Hitler Youth are sent to the frontlines. Solek deserts his unit and surrenders to the Soviets. His captors are initially doubtful Solek is a Jew and accuse him of being a traitor. When a Soviet officer angrily shows Solek photos of murdered Jews from [[Nazi concentration camps|death camps]] they liberated, Solek explains he was not aware of the extent of the death camps. They are about to have Solek shot by an elderly Communist political prisoner when Solek's brother Isaak, just released from a concentration camp, recognizes Solek. Isaak reveals to Solek that their parents were killed years prior when the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto was \"[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto#Liquidation|liquidated]]\". Before leaving the camp, Isaak tells Solek to never reveal his story to anyone, saying it would never be believed. Shortly thereafter Solek [[Aliyah|emigrates]] to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. The films ends with the real Solomon Perel, as an older man, singing a Jewish folk song taken from the [[Book of Psalms]] (\"[[Hine Ma Tov]],\" [[Psalm 133]]:1).\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marco Hofschneider]] as Solomon \"Solek\" Perel \n* [[Julie Delpy]] as Leni\n* [[Hanns Zischler]] as Hauptmann\n* Ren\u00e9 Hofschneider as Isaak\n* Piotr Kozlowski as David\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Wilms]] as Robert Kellerman, soldier\n* Ashley Wanninger as Gerd\n* Halina \u0141abonarska as Leni's mother\n* Klaus Abramowsky as Solomon's father\n* Mich\u00e8le Gleizer as Solomon's mother\n* Marta Sandrowicz as Berta\n* Nathalie Schmidt as Basia\n* [[Delphine Forest]] as Inna\n* Martin Maria Blau as Ulmayer\n* Andrzej Mastalerz as Zenek\n* [[Solomon Perel]] as himself\n}}\n\n== Release ==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was given a limited release in the United States on 28 June 1991 and grossed $31,433 in its opening weekend in two theaters.
