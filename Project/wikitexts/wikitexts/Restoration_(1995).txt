Merivel finds himself enjoying a life of debauched pleasure and popularity at [[noble court|court]], until the King informs him that he has arranged for Merivel to wed Celia, the King's favorite [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. The purpose of the [[arranged marriage]] is to fool another of the King's mistresses. Merivel is given an estate named Bidnold in [[Suffolk]], and Celia is installed in a house in [[Kew]] where the king can visit her secretly. Merivel lives a life of debauchery there, but also finds pleasure in [[Building restoration|restoring]] the house to its former beauty with the support of Will Gates, the man who runs the estate. However, things become complicated when Merivel breaks the King's cardinal rule by falling in love with Celia. Elias Finn, a painter commissioned by the King to paint a portrait of Celia, tricks Merivel into revealing his romantic feelings for Celia, who does not return Merivel's affections. After finding out about Merivel's romantic feelings toward Celia, the King [[Exile|banishes]] him from court back to his life as a physician.\n\nMerivel rejoins his old friend, John Pearce, who has opened a [[Quaker]] [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]]. There, Merivel meets Katherine, a troubled young woman whose husband walked out on her after their daughter drowned in the river. Merivel and Katherine become lovers. Pearce falls fatally ill with [[tuberculosis|consumption]], and while Merivel is tending to his dying friend, they discover that Katherine is pregnant with Merivel's child. After the death of Pearce, Merivel and Katherine leave.\n\nThe pair returns to London just as the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] has hit. Katherine gives birth to a daughter, Margaret, via [[Caesarean section]], but dies in the process as there is no way to ward off [[infection]] once the body has been cut open. In her dying moments, Merivel promises Katherine that he loves her, and will care for Margaret.\n\nAs the plague continues to kill the people of London, Merivel feels compelled to do what he can as a physician. He leaves Margaret with a wet nurse who promises to care for her in his absence, and goes out into the city, separating the sick from the well, who have all been [[quarantine]]d together, and does what he can to ease the suffering of the dying. When someone asks for Merivel's name, he says he is John Pearce, as a tribute to his friend. Under this misnomer and in disguise, Merivel is once again summoned to the palace. The King fears that Celia has contracted the plague. Merivel soon assures him that she does not have the plague, but rather has a treatable fever and is with child. With this, Merivel realizes the life he has now is more rewarding and fulfilling than the life and loves at the court he left behind.\n\nSuddenly, the court is notified that the [[Great Fire of London|city is ablaze]], and Merivel races back to the city to retrieve his infant daughter from the flames. He is unable to find her, and falling through burning wood, Merivel lands in a small [[Watercraft rowing|row boat]], unconscious, and is floated by the river current away from the city. When he awakens, he is being cared for by Will Gates back at Bidnold. As Merivel recovers from his fall, he cannot recover from his failure to protect his young daughter from harm, when suddenly the King arrives at the house with his entourage. He informs Merivel that he has discovered the doctor's true identity, and that he was impressed with the man Merivel had become. With that, the King steps aside to reveal a nurse holding Margaret safely in her arms. For his courage and good work done in treating the victims of the plague, the King once again gives Bidnold to Merivel, stating that this time it will never be taken away. The film ends with Merivel returning to London, to set up a new hospital with help from the King.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Robert Merivel\n* [[Sam Neill]] as [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]\n* [[David Thewlis]] as John Pearce\n* [[Polly Walker]] as Celia Clemence\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Katharine\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as Will Gates\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Elias Finn\n* [[Ian McDiarmid]] as Ambrose\n* [[Mary MacLeod (actress)|Mary MacLeod]] as Midwife\n* [[Mark Letheren]] as Daniel\n* [[Sandy McDade]] as Hannah\n* [[Andrew Havill]] as Gallant\n* [[Rosalind Bennett]] as Eleanor\n* Willie Ross as Man with Visible Heart\n* [[David Gant]] as Chiffinch\n* [[Benjamin Whitrow]] as Merivel's Father\n* Neville Watchurst as Latin Doctor\n* [[Bryan Pringle]] as Watchman\n* [[Roy Evans (actor)|Roy Evans]] as Fleeing Man\n* [[John Quarmby]] as The Chancellor\n* John Dallimore as The Secretary\n* [[Roger Ashton-Griffiths]] as Mr. Bung\n*  Bridie & Hannah Rees-Davies as Twin Babies\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Restoration'' won Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration]] for [[Eugenio Zanetti]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] for [[James Acheson]].<ref name=\"Oscars1996\" /> The film was also entered into the [[46th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1996/02_programm_1996/02_Programm_1996.html |title=Berlinale: 1996 Programme |access-date=2012-01-01 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> According to the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], {{RT data|score}} of critics have given the film a positive review based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}.
