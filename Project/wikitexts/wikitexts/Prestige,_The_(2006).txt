Obsessed with creating the best stage [[Magic (illusion)|illusion]], they engage in a competitive rivalry, with tragic results.\n\nThe film stars [[Hugh Jackman]] as Robert Angier and [[Christian Bale]] as Alfred Borden.

Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be under 700 words. Please don't expand this plot summary.-->In 1890s London, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden work as [[shill]]s for a magician under the mentorship of John Cutter, an engineer who designs stage magic. During a [[Chinese Water Torture Cell|water tank trick]], Angier's wife Julia fails to escape and drowns. Angier, devastated, blames Borden for using a riskier knot, causing her death. When Angier asks Borden which knot he used, Borden claims not to know. The two become bitter enemies and rivals. Angier and Borden launch their own magic careers, with Angier working with Cutter, and Borden with the mysterious Fallon. Angier sabotages one of Borden's performances when he slips a real bullet into Borden's pistol during a [[Bullet catch|bullet-catch trick]], resulting in Borden losing two of his fingers. \n\nBorden reciprocates by sabotaging Angier's disappearing bird act, killing the bird on stage and injuring a volunteer from the audience. Borden develops a trick he calls the Transported Man, in which he appears to travel instantly between two wardrobes on opposite ends of the stage. Unable to discern Borden's method, Angier hires a double, Gerald Root, to perform his own version of the trick. The imitation is a greater success, but Angier is dissatisfied, as he ends the trick hidden under the stage while Root basks in the applause. Root threatens to blackmail Angier and Cutter after being approached by Borden. Obsessed with figuring out Borden's trick, Angier has his assistant, Olivia, spy on Borden to learn how he performs the Transported Man. \n\nHowever, Olivia falls in love with Borden and becomes his assistant. With her help, Borden sabotages Angier's act, crippling his leg in the process. Confronted by Angier, Olivia gives him a copy of Borden's encoded diary. Angier acquires the keyword to decode it, \"TESLA\", by threatening to kill Fallon. The diary takes Angier to America to meet scientist [[Nikola Tesla]], who Angier believes built a teleportation machine for Borden. Tesla warns Angier about the dangers of obsession, but agrees to create the machine for him. Angier finishes reading the diary, where Borden reveals that he has no connection to Tesla, and that he faked his diary in order to send Angier on a wild goose chase. Tesla builds a machine for Angier, but instead of teleporting objects, Tesla's machine duplicates anything placed inside it a short distance away. \n\nTesla is driven from Colorado Springs by agents of his rival, [[Thomas Edison]], but has the machine delivered to Angier. He advises Angier to destroy it, saying it will bring him only misery. Borden's wife, Sarah, is driven to suicide by his contradictory personality, alternately loving and cold. Borden tells Olivia that he never loved Sarah, and that he loves her more. Tired of Borden and Angier's feud, Olivia leaves the relationship. In London, Angier debuts the \"Real Transported Man\" using Tesla's machine, appearing to have teleported across the theater. Borden sneaks backstage and witnesses Angier fall through a trapdoor and drown in a tank. He is discovered by Cutter and turned over to the police. \n\nUnable to prove his innocence, Borden is found guilty of murder and [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|sentenced to death]]. Tesla's machine is sold off to the wealthy Lord Caldlow, a purported magic enthusiast.  Cutter visits Caldlow to advise him to destroy the machine and is shocked to discover that Caldlow is Angier, alive and well, and the \"Angier\" who drowned that night was actually Angier's copy. Angier visits Borden in prison, accompanied by Borden's daughter Jess. Borden offers the secret to his \"Transported Man\" in exchange for his daughter's safety, but Angier rebuffs him, saying that his own trick is better. Cutter is disgusted that Angier allowed Borden to be sentenced to death, but agrees to help dispose of Tesla's machine. Borden is hanged for Angier's murder.\n\nAngier goes back to the theatre. A stranger enters and shoots Angier, revealing himself as Alfred Borden. Angier discovers \"Borden\" was an identity shared by a pair of identical twins. The brothers performed the original Transported Man together; when one was \"Borden\", the other was disguised as \"Fallon\". Alfred loved Sarah while his dead brother had loved Olivia. A dying Angier reveals that every performance a duplicate would fall into the tank and drown and that every time he used the machine he was unsure if he would end up dead or not.  The theater catches fire and burns, while Borden reunites with his daughter, who has been rescued by Cutter.<!--STOP! Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be under 700 words.

For the role of Nikola Tesla, Nolan wanted someone who was not necessarily a film star but was \"extraordinarily charismatic\". Nolan said that \"David Bowie was really the only guy I had in mind to play Tesla because his function in the story is a small but very important role\".<ref name=\"Casting\" /> Nolan contacted Bowie, who initially turned down the part.

While in [[London]], Nolan read Priest's book and shared the story with his brother while walking around in [[Highgate]] (a location later featured in the scene where Angier ransoms Borden's stage engineer in [[Highgate Cemetery]]).

Obsession, secrecy, and sacrifice fuel the battle, as both magicians contribute their fair share to a deadly duel of one-upmanship, with disastrous results. Angier's obsession with beating Borden costs him Cutter's friendship, while providing him with a collection of his own dead clones; Borden's obsession with maintaining the secrecy of his twin leads Sarah to question their relationship, eventually resulting in her suicide when she suspects the truth. Angier and one of the twins both lose Olivia's love because of their inhumanity. Finally, Borden is hanged and the last copy of Angier shot. Their struggle is also expressed through [[class conflict|class warfare]]: Borden as ''The Professor'', a working-class magician who gets his hands dirty, versus Angier as ''The Great Danton'', a classy, elitist showman whose accent makes him appear American.<ref>{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Rebecca |title=Christian Bale Talks About \"The Prestige\" - Page 2 |work=About.com |url=http://movies.about.com/od/theprestige/a/prestigcb101606_2.htm |access-date=November 1, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321134514/http://movies.about.com/od/theprestige/a/prestigcb101606_2.htm |archive-date=March 21, 2007}}</ref> Film critic Matt Brunson claimed that a complex theme of duality is exemplified by Angier and Borden, that the film chooses not to depict either magician as good or evil.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brunson|first=Matt|title=Trick and Treat|work=Creative Loafing Charlotte|url=http://clclt.com/charlotte/trick-and-treat/Content?oid=2145474|access-date=July 22, 2013|archive-date=January 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119043824/http://clclt.com/charlotte/trick-and-treat/Content?oid=2145474|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAngier's theft of Borden's teleportation illusion in the film echoes many real-world examples of stolen tricks among magicians.
