In an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate universe]], humanity and vampires have warred for centuries. After the last Vampire War, a veteran Warrior Priest lives in obscurity until his niece ([[Lily Collins]]) is kidnapped by vampires.\n\nThe film was released on {{nowrap|May 13}}, 2011. The film earned over $78 million at the box office against a $60 million production budget, but it was panned by critics, who praised the film's visual style and art direction while criticizing the movie's use of genre clich\u00e9s, writing, acting, editing and action scenes.\n\n==Plot==\nA centuries-long war between [[human]]s and [[vampire]]s has devastated the planet's surface and led to a [[theocracy]] under an organization called The Church. Despite the vampires' vulnerability to [[sunlight]], and all of mankind's technological advances, the vampires' greater strength and speed made them impossible to defeat until humanity sheltered them in giant walled cities and trained a group of elite warriors, the Priests, which turned the tide.\n\nIn the opening scene, a group of Priests enters the Sola Mira Hive but are ambushed by the vampires.  As they attempt to retreat, one of their numbers is seized from behind, and their leader tries to pull him to safety, but is forced to let go and watch him dragged, screaming, back into the hive.\n\nYears later, the majority of the vampires have been killed, while the remainder were placed in [[wikt:reservation|reservation]]s. With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of The Church.\n\nPriest ([[Paul Bettany]]) is approached by Hicks ([[Cam Gigandet]]), the sheriff of a free town, Augustine. Priest learns that his brother, Owen, and Owen's wife, Shannon\u2014Priest's girlfriend before he was recruited by the clergy\u2014were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy ([[Lily Collins]]), was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Church to reinstate his authority, but leader Monsignor Orelas ([[Christopher Plummer]]) does not believe the vampire story and refuses, insisting on maintaining the common belief that the vampires have been completely defeated, for fear of compromising the Church's authority. Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess ([[Maggie Q]]) to bring him back.\n\nPriest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a [[pathogen]] that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, which was thought to have been abandoned after the war. Priestess, one of Priest's team during the failed attack on the Hive, joins them at Sola Mira. The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an [[Armoured train|armored train]] arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat ([[Karl Urban]]). When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them all.\n\nThe next morning, Priest, Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Priest and Priestess share an intimate moment when she confesses her feelings for him, hoping that now that Shannon has died, he would no longer feel bound to her. Priest gently refuses. Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line. Hicks believes the cities are likewise protected by the sun, but Priest explains that the cities' [[Air pollution|massive clouds of smoke and ash]] have permanently deprived them of sunlight.  If the train reaches one of the cities, the attack will be a slaughter.\n\nHicks, who is in love with Lucy, threatens Priest, believing that Priest intends to kill her if she has been infected by the vampires.  Priestess explains that he cannot do so, because Lucy is actually Priest's daughter, and that Owen stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by the Church.  Lucy was never told the truth about her parentage.\n\nWhile Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy. Battling vampires and Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy. Black Hat is revealed as the priest who was lost in the attack on Sola Mira.  After being captured, the vampire Queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can survive the sun. As Priest fights Black Hat, Lucy discovers the truth about her parentage. On the tracks ahead of the train, Priestess battles several Familiars, but one of them destroys the detonator for the explosives.  Instead, she mounts the explosives on her motor bike and drives it into the train engine. The explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in flames, while Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape.\n\nPriest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies, but not the Queen's. He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room. Orelas still refuses to believe him, declaring that the war is over, while Priest says that it is just beginning. Outside the city Priest meets Priestess, who confirms that other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point. Priest sets off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Priest\n* [[Karl Urban]] as Black Hat\n* [[Cam Gigandet]] as Hicks\n* [[Maggie Q]] as Priestess\n* [[Lily Collins]] as Lucy Pace\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Salesman\n* [[Stephen Moyer]] as Owen Pace\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Monsignor Orelas\n* [[Alan Dale]] as Monsignor Chamberlain\n* [[M\u00e4dchen Amick]] as Shannon Pace\n* [[Jacob Hopkins]] as Boy\n* Dave Florek as Crocker\n* Joel Polinsky as Dr. Tomlin\n* [[Josh Wingate]] as Familiar\n\n==Production==\n{{rquote|right|The priests of our story are like [[Jedi]] knights.
