It is directed by [[Thomas Carter (director)|Thomas Carter]], and produced by [[Roger Birnbaum]]. The plot follows Scott Roper (Murphy), a hostage negotiator and inspector for the [[San Francisco Police Department]] who seeks revenge against a psychotic jewel thief, Michael Korda (Wincott), who murdered Roper's best friend, Lt. Sam Baffert (Evans). ''Metro'' was released on January 17, 1997, in the United States, where it grossed $32 million.\n\n==Plot==\n[[SFPD]] Inspector Scott Roper is the best hostage negotiator in his department. He is called in to deal with a [[Bank robbery|bank robber]], Earl, demanding a getaway vehicle and police escort. He manages to defuse the situation, shooting Earl non-fatally in the shoulder and rescuing his 17 hostages.\n\nThat night, Scott accompanies his friend and former partner Sam Baffert to the apartment of Michael Korda, a jewel thief involved in Baffert's investigation. After Sam questions Korda about his involvement, Korda stabs him to death and leaves his corpse inside an elevator for Scott to find. Despite demanding to go after Korda, Captain Frank Solis refuses to let him take the case due to the probable [[conflict of interest]]. Scott resolves to bring Korda to justice, but in the meanwhile must adjust to his new partner, [[SWAT]] sharpshooter Kevin McCall.\n\nScott and Kevin are called to a hostage situation at a downtown jewelry store, with Korda as the hostage taker. When Scott and Korda see each other, the latter grabs a hostage and makes a getaway in a truck. Scott and Kevin use Solis' car to pursue him. Korda wrecks the truck, and boards a [[cable car (railway)|cable car]], shooting the operator. Scott and Kevin manage to stop the cable car and chase Korda into a parking garage, where they apprehend him.\n\nDuring visitation at the jail with his cousin Clarence Teal, Korda orders Teal to kill Ronnie, Scott's girlfriend, as a way to seek revenge on Scott. Teal attacks Ronnie at her apartment, but Scott intervenes and chases Teal down the fire escape, where, after a chase, Teal is struck and killed by a passing car. An angry Scott visits Korda in jail and warns him to stay away from Ronnie, showing him an autopsy picture of Teal, which enrages Korda.\n\nThe next morning, Korda escapes from the jail and kidnaps Ronnie, leading Scott and Kevin into a confrontation at an abandoned shipyard. Korda threatens to kill Ronnie by decapitating her on the cutting machine she is pinned to if Scott doesn't follow his instructions. Korda charges toward Scott in a sports car, but is shot from a vantage point by Kevin, causing him to swerve and crash through the warehouse entrance. Scott frees Ronnie, while Kevin engages Korda in a shootout where the former is shot in the upper leg. Korda tries to escape in Scott's truck, but Scott fights for control of it. Scott leaps out of the way while Korda, who is unable to escape due to Scott ramming a steal pipe into the door and on the gas pedal continues on, trapped in the truck. As Korda struggles to get the door open he screams, \"Get the fuck open!\" before crashing into a stack of explosive barrels and is killed in a massive explosion. The movie ends with Scott and Ronnie relaxing on vacation at a [[Tahiti]]an beach resort.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Inspector Scott Roper\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Inspector Kevin McCall\n* [[Carmen Ejogo]] as Veronica \"Ronnie\" Tate\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as Michael Korda\n* [[Art Evans (actor)|Art Evans]] as Lieutenant Sam Baffett\n* [[Denis Arndt]] as Captain Frank Solis\n* [[Paul Ben-Victor]] as Clarence Teal\n* [[Kim Miyori]] as Inspector Eiko Kimura\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Earl\n* [[James Carpenter (actor)|James Carpenter]] as Officer Forbes\n\n==Production==\nIn February 1995 Caravan Pictures bought the script for ''Metro'' in a preemptive bid of $1 million.<ref name=\"MurphyCopsMetro\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/murphy-cops-metro-role-99127445/|title=   Murphy cops 'Metro' role  |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 21, 2021}}</ref> Eddie Murphy entered negotiations for the lead role in May 1995.<ref name=\"MurphyCopsMetro\" />\n\n==Release==\n\n===Reception===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 17% based on reviews from 35 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Metro (1997) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1074675-1074675-metro |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a favorable review; he said \"[t]he big action scenes are cleverly staged and Eddie Murphy is back on his game again, with a high-energy performance and crisp dialogue.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=1997 |author=Roger Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |title= Metro |work=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/metro-1997 |access-date=2021-01-31 }}{{Rating|3|4}}</ref> \nA negative review came from [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who called the film \"aimless\" and stated that \"[t]he vehicular pirouettes and ski jumps are so exaggerated that they correspond neither to the urban geography nor to the laws of physics.

At the end, writer Feldman has actually dreamed up a variation on the old silent movie chestnut, where the mustache-twirling villain has the heroine tied to a sawmill plank. I'm not even sure this scene is intended humorously; the actors and director all milk it dry. And, except for Murphy's rapid-fire badinage, \"Metro\" has the kind of writing that suggests a mind filled with heroines tied to sawmill planks.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= Eddie Murphy Wisecracks Through 'Metro' |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-01-17/entertainment/9701170279_1_scott-roper-metro-beverly-hills-cop |access-date=2012-05-31}}</ref>\n\nAudiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= METRO (1997) B+ |work= [[CinemaScore]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe movie debuted with $9.3 million.<ref>{{cite news |title= Beverly Hills Ninja Edges 'Metro' to Top Box Office|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-20/entertainment/ca-20389_1_beverly-hills-ninja |access-date=2012-05-31}}</ref> ''Metro'' eventually brought in $32,000,301 domestically, not recovering its $55 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=metro.htm |title=Metro (1997) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=March 22, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nDirector Thomas Carter said that one of the biggest mistakes he made in his career was to make ''Metro'' as a rated-R movie.
