It is the first [[feature film]] directed by Trier and the first installment of the director's [[Europa trilogy]] \u2013 succeeded by ''[[Epidemic (film)|Epidemic]]'' (1987) and ''[[Europa (1991 film)|Europa]]'' (1991).\n\n==Plot==\nA detective named Fisher, who has become an [[expatriate]] living in [[Cairo]], undergoes hypnosis in order to recall his last case. The [[Europe]] of his dreamlike recollection is a [[dystopia]], dark and decaying. Fisher remembers pursuing an elusive killer called the \"Lotto Murderer\", who was strangling and then mutilating young girls who were selling lottery tickets. He attempts to track down the killer using the controversial methods outlined in a book entitled ''The Element of Crime'', written by his disgraced mentor, Osborne. He is joined in his search by a prostitute named Kim, who, it turns out, has had a child by his target. Fisher's search is based on a tailing report written by Osborne when trying to track down a murderer who had been killing in the same way as the \"Lotto Murderer\", but who, supposedly, has since died in a crash. The Osborne method requires the detective to try to identify with the mind of the killer. This he does, but, in so doing, begins to behave more and more like a serial killer himself.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|* [[Michael Elphick]] as Fisher\n* [[Esmond Knight]] as Osborne\n* [[Me Me Lai|Meme Lai]] as Kim\n* [[Jerold Wells]] as Kramer\n* Ahmed El Shenawi as Therapist\n* [[Astrid Henning-Jensen]] as Housekeeper\n* [[J\u00e1nos Hersk\u00f3]] as Coroner\n* [[Stig H\u00e5kan Larsson|Stig Larsson]] as Coroner's assistant\n* Harry Harper and Roman Moszkowicz as Portiers\n* [[Lars von Trier]] as Schmuck of Ages\n* Frederik Casby as White policeman\n* Duke Addabayo as Black policeman\n* {{ill|Jon Bang Carlsen|da}} as Angry policeman\n* {{ill|Leif Magnusson|sv|Leif Magnusson (regiss\u00f6r)}} as Hotel guest\n* [[Preben Lerdorff Rye]] as Grandfather\n* [[Camilla Overbye Roos]] and Maria Behrendt as Lotto girls\n* [[Mogens Rukov]] as Librarian\n* {{ill|Gotha Andersen|af||da||sv}} as Judge\n}}\n\n==Style==\nThe film employs the [[film noir]] conventions of monochrome footage, apparently constant night, and the frequent presence of water, such as rain and rivers. The film is shot almost entirely in [[sodium light]] resulting in images reminiscent of [[sepia tone]], though with a more intense yellow.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lumholdt |first=Jan |title=Lars von Trier: interviews |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voTOt3GaRJAC&pg=PA74 |access-date=14 October 2010 |year=2003 |publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi |isbn=978-1-57806-532-5 |page=74 |quote=Both The Element of Crime and Images of a Relief are romances in decomposition and set in a landscape saturated in yellow sodium color.}}</ref> Because sodium lamps produce light in only a few narrow [[emission peak]]s, rather than over a wide spectrum, the film has an almost monochrome appearance. The sepia is occasionally contrasted with piercing blues and reds.\n\nThe world depicted in the film is semi-derelict. Disordered collections of similar or identical objects are found in many of the scenes, reinforcing the sense of a crumbling society. Examples include white paper, light bulbs, heaps of keys, surgical scissors, glass bottles, rubber stamps, and Coca-Cola cans.\n\nThe film's slow pace, dark visuals and occasional [[Surrealism|surreal]] imagery give it a dreamlike quality. In addition, much of the dialogue is contradictory. An example is one conversation between Fisher and his mentor's housekeeper:\n:Fisher: Is it always as dark as this at this time of year?\n:Housekeeper: There are no seasons anymore. The last three summers haven't been summers. The weather changes all the time. It never alters.\n\nIn the opening of the film, a shot of a donkey lying on its back and then slowly struggling to stand may be a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to a similar shot in [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/element.shtml |title='The Element of Crime' Review |last=Anderson |first=Jeffrey M. |date= |website=Combustible Celluloid |publisher= |access-date=November 5, 2022 |quote=}}</ref> Trier has stated that he is an admirer of Tarkovsky's work.\n\n<blockquote>I was very inspired by Tarkovsky. I won't make any bones about that. I saw an excerpt from ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (''Zerkalo'') on Swedish television once, just a travelling shot around that house, and that was one of those 'I'll be damned' experiences.<ref name=\"HjortBondebjerg2003\">{{cite book |last1=Hjort |first1=Mette |last2=Bondebjerg |first2=Ib |title=The Danish directors: dialogues on a contemporary national cinema |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEqSeQvWaHgC&pg=PA215 |access-date=14 October 2010 |date=1 January 2003 |publisher=Intellect Books |isbn=978-1-84150-841-2 |page=215}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Element of Crime'' polarized critics at Cannes in 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1650-all-those-things-that-are-to-die-antichrist |title=All Those Things That Are to Die: ''Antichrist'' |last=Christie |first=Ian |publisher=The Criterion Collection |date=November 9, 2010 |access-date=December 29, 2016}}</ref> [[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 77% of critics gave the film a positive review.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/element_of_crime/ |title=The Element of Crime |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |access-date=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film received several awards including the [[Bodil Awards]] and [[Robert Awards]] in 1985 for the Best Film, and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1984 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1177/year/1984.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Element of Crime |access-date=2009-06-23 |work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n! width=\"20%\"|Organization\n! width=\"35%\"|Category\n! width=\"35%\"|Recipients and nominees\n! width=\"10%\"|Result\n|-\n|[[Avoriaz#Avoriaz Film Festival|Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival]] || Grand Prix||[[Lars von Trier]]|| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Cannes Film Festival]] || Technical Grand Prize ||Lars von Trier ||{{won}}\n|-\n|[[Palme d'Or]] ||Lars von Trier|| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| [[Bodil Awards]] || [[Bodil Award for Best Danish Film|Best Film]] ||Lars von Trier|| {{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Fantasporto]] || International Fantasy Film Award for Best Director||Lars von Trier|| {{won}}\n|-\n|International Fantasy Film Award for Best Film||Lars von Trier|| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg|Mannheim-Heidelberg International Filmfestival]]<ref name=\"iffmh1984\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iffmh.de/en/1984_Awards_And_Juries |title=Awards and Juries 1984 |access-date=2011-05-22 |work=iffmh.de}}</ref> || Josef von Sternberg Award ||Lars von Trier|| {{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"| [[Robert Awards]] || Best Cinematography || {{ill|Tom Elling|da}} || {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Costume Design || [[Manon Rasmussen]] || {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Editor || {{ill|T\u00f3mas Gislason|da}} || {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Film ||Lars von Trier|| {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Production Design || {{ill|Peter H\u00f8imark|sv}} || {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Sound || Morten Degnbol || {{won}}\n|-\n|Best Special Effects || Peter H\u00f8imark || {{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"| [[Vulcain Prize]] || [[Vulcain Prize#Technical Grand Prize (1951-2000)|Technical Grand Prize]]||Lars von Trier|| {{won}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==Home media==\n''The Element of Crime'' has been released on [[DVD]] in [[North America]] by the [[Criterion Collection]].
