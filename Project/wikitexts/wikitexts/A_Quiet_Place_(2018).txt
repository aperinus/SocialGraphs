The plot revolves around a father (Krasinski) and a mother ([[Emily Blunt]]) who struggle to survive and rear their children ([[Millicent Simmonds]] and [[Noah Jupe]]) in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by blind monsters with an acute sense of hearing.\n\nBeck and Woods began developing the story while in college. In July 2016, Krasinski read their [[spec script]] and was hired to direct and rewrite the script in March the following year. Krasinski and Blunt were cast in the lead roles in May 2017. Filming took place in [[upstate New York]] from May to November 2017.\n\n''A Quiet Place'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 9, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 6, 2018, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It grossed more than $350 million worldwide and received critical acclaim. The film was described as a \"smart, wickedly frightening good time\" by [[Rotten Tomatoes]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/a-quiet-place-and-blockers-are-certified-fresh/ |title='A Quiet Place' and 'Blockers' Are Certified Fresh |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=April 5, 2018 |access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref> and chosen by both the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] and [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] as one of the top ten films of 2018. The film was nominated for several awards, including a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]]; an [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]]; a [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]]; and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role]] for Blunt, which she won.\n\nA sequel, ''[[A Quiet Place Part II]]'', was released on May 28, 2021, with Krasinski returning to the director's chair and the main cast also returning with the addition of [[Cillian Murphy]].\n\n==Plot==\nSightless aliens with sharp hearing have taken over the planet and killed most of the human population. The Abbott family \u2014 mother Evelyn, father Lee, deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau \u2014 live on their isolated farm in the middle of a forest in upstate New York, and have survived by taking up special precautions in order to make as little noise as possible, such as laying sand paths to avoid stepping on crunching leaves, and using [[American Sign Language]] when communicating.\n\nWhen the family goes into the nearby town for supplies, Beau finds a toy space shuttle, which Lee makes him leave alone because it would make too much noise. As they are getting ready to leave, Regan secretly gives him back the toy, but without its batteries. When they leave, Beau secretly takes back the batteries. While walking back home, Beau secretly triggers the toy space shuttle, which starts making noise. The sound alerts a nearby creature which immediately jumps out of the forest and kills him.\n\nAlmost a year after Beau's death, the family has seemingly gone back to normal, with Evelyn several months pregnant. Marcus reluctantly goes fishing with Lee while Regan, upset that she cannot go, visits Beau's grave. While everybody is gone, Evelyn goes into [[Childbirth|labor]]; while going downstairs, she steps on a nail and drops a photo frame, which alerts nearby creatures. She flips a switch, turning the surrounding lights around the house red. She tries to go upstairs but finds out that one of the creatures has entered the house. Soon after, it enters the basement; Evelyn sets an egg timer, distracting the creature and giving herself time to run upstairs. She begins giving birth in the bathtub upstairs as the creature slowly makes its way towards her. Lee and Marcus, who are back from fishing, notice the red lights and set off fireworks to create a diversion.\n\nRegan, seeing the fireworks, runs back to the house. Lee then enters the house and brings the baby and Evelyn into the basement. The baby cries, alerting a creature into the basement. This creature fails to find the source, but breaks some water pipes. Marcus and Regan go to the top of a silo and light a fire. Meanwhile, Evelyn wakes up in the flooded basement with the beast still inside; she hides behind a waterfront as this creature moves towards her.\n\nAfter getting into an argument, Marcus falls through the silo's roof, and Regan jumps in after him. The creature in the basement runs towards the silo and attacks Regan and Marcus. Regan squeezes her [[cochlear implant]], making a high pitched noise. The creature, in pain, runs off, breaking a hole in the silo. Lee finds Regan and Marcus, and tells them to get in his truck and drive back to the house. A creature then appears, attacks Lee, and wounds him; Marcus screams inside the truck, turning the creature's attention to them. Lee, realizing that his children are about to die unless he intervenes, signs to Regan that he has always loved her, before screaming loudly. The creature then kills Lee, giving Regan and Marcus time to drive back to the house.\n\nBack at the house, the children are greeted by Evelyn and they embrace. After hearing a nearby creature shriek, they retreat to the basement, where Regan sees that her dad was studying cochlear implants to help her hear. A creature comes into the basement; Regan takes off her cochlear implant and slams it on a guitar amp; the resulting noise makes the creature shriek in pain and expose its soft inner mouth, allowing Evelyn to shoot and kill it. With Marcus and the baby hiding in the corner of the basement, Regan and Evelyn look on the screens connected to the security cameras and see two other creatures running towards the house. Regan turns up the wattage and lifts the microphone. Evelyn looks at Regan, smiles, and cocks her shotgun.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Emily Blunt and John Krasinski.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Krasinski]] (''left'') and [[Emily Blunt]] (''right''), who play the lead roles in the film]]\n\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Evelyn Abbott, wife of Lee, and the mother to their four children, Regan, Marcus, Beau, and baby Abbott.

Farrar said the initial creature design showed them with rhinoceros-like horns out of their faces, later redesigned.
