The film was directed by [[Chris Renaud]] and [[Pierre Coffin]] (in their [[directorial debuts|feature directorial debuts]]) and produced by [[Chris Meledandri]], [[Janet Healy]], and John Cohen, from a screenplay written by [[Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio]], based on an original story by [[Sergio Pablos]]. The film stars the voices of [[Steve Carell]], [[Jason Segel]], [[Russell Brand]], [[Miranda Cosgrove]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Will Arnett]], and [[Julie Andrews]]. The film follows a supervillain named [[Gru (Despicable Me)|Gru]] as he formulates a plan to steal the Moon, while adopting three orphan girls.\n\n''Despicable Me'' debuted at the [[Moscow International Film Festival]] on June 19, 2010, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 9, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews and earned $543.2 million worldwide, becoming the [[2010 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2010]]. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the [[68th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]], [[64th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] and [[38th Annie Awards|Annie Awards]]. ''Despicable Me'' is the first entry in what would become the [[Despicable Me|franchise of the same name]], which includes four more films\u2014''[[Despicable Me 2]]'' (2013), ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]'' (2015), ''[[Despicable Me 3]]'' (2017), and ''[[Minions: The Rise of Gru]]'' (2022). A sixth film, ''[[Despicable Me 4]]'', is in development and will be released in 2024.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nLongtime supervillain [[Gru (Despicable Me)|Gru]] is outdone by an unknown rival who stole the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. Gru, his elderly assistant [[Dr. Nefario]], and his army of [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]] formulate a plan to steal the Earth's Moon. Dr. Nefario worries that the plan will be too expensive, so Gru applies for a loan from Mr. Perkins, the director of the \"Bank of Evil\", who orders Gru to steal a shrink ray first. While at the bank, Gru meets Perkins's son, Vector, a budding supervillain responsible for the Pyramid heist. \n\nGru and two of his Minions steal the shrink ray from a research base, only for Vector to intercept them and obtain it for himself. After a series of failed attempts to steal back the shrink ray from Vector's fortress, Gru notices three orphan girls, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, being allowed into the fortress to sell cookies for Vector. Gru disguises himself as a dentist and adopts the girls; he later uses them to distract Vector long enough for him to steal back the shrink ray. The girls insist Gru upon stopping at an amusement park on the way home. \n\nDr. Nefario calculates the travel to the Moon when it gets closest to Earth, the same day as the girls' ballet recital. Gru starts bonding with the girls after intending to abandon them. He shows Mr. Perkins the shrink ray via video call just as the girls interrupt it, causing Mr. Perkins to refuse the loan. A heartbroken Gru tells the Minions that the bank ceased funding the project. The girls give him their piggy bank, and the Minions pool all of their resources to raise the funds needed for the project.\n\nSeeing the girls doing too much distraction to Gru's plan, he calls the orphanage's owner, Miss Hattie, and tells her to take the girls back. Meanwhile, Mr. Perkins informs Vector of Gru's possession of the shrink ray, prompting Vector to take action by kidnapping the girls. Gru shrinks and steals the Moon, and surrenders it to Vector at the fortress, where he later activates his escape aircraft. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefario and the Minions discover that the shrink ray's effects are temporary: larger objects quickly revert to their normal size. Gru and his allies rescue the girls before the Moon returns to its normal size and launches itself into orbit, with Vector stranded on it. Gru reclaims custody of the girls and they celebrate with a special recital that becomes a dance party.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Steve Carell November 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Steve Carell]] voices [[Gru (Despicable Me)|Gru]].]]\n* [[Steve Carell]] as [[Gru (Despicable Me)|Gru]]\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Vector\n* [[Russell Brand]] as [[Dr. Nefario]]\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Miss Hattie\n* [[Miranda Cosgrove]] as Margo\n* [[Will Arnett]] as Mr. Perkins\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Fred McDade\n* [[Jack McBrayer]] as a carnival barker and a tourist dad\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as Marlena Gru\n\nAdditionally, [[Dana Gaier]] voices Edith and [[Elsie Fisher]] voices Agnes.
