It is based on the book ''[[Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Carandiru]]'' by [[Drauzio Varella|Dr. Drauzio Varella]], a physician and [[AIDS]] specialist, who is portrayed in the film by [[Luiz Carlos Vasconcelos]].<ref name=\"ctribune\">{{cite news |title='Carandiru' a prison drama that grips viewers |author=Michael Wilmington |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-05-28/entertainment/0405280383_1_ailton-graca-gero-camilo-carandiru-station |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=28 May 2004 |accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Carandiru'' tells some of the stories that occurred in [[Carandiru Penitentiary]], which was the biggest prison in [[Latin America]]. The story culminates with the [[Carandiru massacre|1992 massacre]] where 111 prisoners were killed, 102 by Police. The film was the last thing for which the prison was used before it was demolished in 2002, one year before the release of the film.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293007/trivia\n|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]\n|title=Trivia for Carandiru\n|accessdate = 17 June 2010\n}}</ref>\n\nBabenco stated that ''Carandiru'' is the \u201cmost realistic film [he\u2019s] ever made\",<ref name=ProQuest237109313>{{cite journal |id={{ProQuest|237109313}} |last1=Jaafar |first1=Ali |title=Protect and survive |journal=Sight and Sound |location=London |volume=14 |issue=5 |date=May 2004 |pages=21\u201322, 3 }}</ref> presenting a new kind of Brazilian realism inspired by [[Cinema Novo]] (not only is it meant to portray different sides of Brazil, but it was also shot on location and used many actual prisoners as actors).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite thesis |id={{ProQuest|}} |last1=Abreu |first1=Aida Penna Campos |title=Brazilian docudrama: 'City of God', 'Carandiru' and 'Elite Squad' |year=2009 }}</ref> Due to this focus on portraying reality and the film's memoir inspiration, ''Carandiru'' can be read as a [[docudrama]] or as a testimony from the prisoners.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |id={{ProQuest|53550864}} |last1=Pellegrini |first1=T\u00e2nia |title=No Fio da Navalha: Literatura e Viol\u00eancia no Brasil de Hoje |journal=Estudos de Literatura Brasileira Contempor\u00e2nea |volume=24 |date=July 2004 |pages=15\u201334 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThis episodic story is set in [[S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo's]] notorious prison Carandiru, one of Latin America's largest and most violent prison systems.\n\n''Carandiru'' tells the stories of different inmates at S\u0101o Paulo's Carandiru Penitentiary through the filter of Dr. Varella, who goes to the prison to test the inmates for [[HIV]]. Similar to many Brazilian crime films, Dr. Varella narrates ''Carandiru'', however, it is not his story that is told. He (like Buscap\u00e9 in ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'') acts as a filter for the stories of those that cannot speak.\n\nThe inhumane conditions of the prison, such as the 100 square foot cells inhabited by sometimes up to 16 prisoners, are shown, as well as the lack of control that the guards have. Order in the prison is entirely controlled by the prisoners themselves, which leads them to face problems such as murders, rampant drug use, and disease all within the prison.\n\nSeveral stories are developed, ranging from drug addiction to murder to family struggles to romance. Some of the more memorable stories are Lady Di (a transwoman) and No Way's marriage, Deusdete and Zico's family dynamic, Ezequiel and Zico's crack addictions, and Majestade's \u201caffairs.\u201d\n\nThe prisoners are humanized to the audience by telling their stories, which makes the riot and the [[Carandiru Massacre]] even more painful for the audience to watch. Thus, when the film ends with real shots of Carandiru Penitentiary's demolition, Babenco employs catharsis.<ref name=ProQuest237109313/>\n\n==Themes==\n===Innocence===\nAt one point during the film, Ebony sarcastically asks Dr. Varella if he's noticed that all the inmates of Carandiru are innocent. All the inmates do see themselves as innocent, which speaks to the idea that the prisoners see themselves as people forced into crime. In this sense, Carandiru employs Dr. Varella as a social mediator who listens to all versions of the prisoners' truths, allowing the audience a glimpse into their world, prompting the audience to see the incarcerated from a different perspective.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> By giving the prisoners a voice, Carandiru gives the prisoners a chance to tell their stories without facing judgment.\n\n===Morality===\nThe theme of morality plays very closely to the theme of innocence in Carandiru. While some of the characters are literally innocent, others (who are guilty) commit their crimes for potentially moral reasons. Deusdete (who has no history of crime) shoots one of the men who raped his sister. Another example is Majestade, who takes the blame for his wife's crime. Majestade, though guilty of having two wives that only sort of know about each other (and are not very happy with that), is not guilty of arson and attempted murder (which is what he is in prison for).\n\n===Law systems===\nWhile the focus of Carandiru is humanizing the prisoners, it still emphasizes the flawed Brazilian legal system and the prisoners' own legal system. Deusdete, who murders a man for raping his sister, originally wants to report the rape to the police. However, his friends advise him not to, because the police will not take his allegation seriously, and will not look to punish the rapists. Thus, Deusdete feels the need to take matters into his own hand, creating his own \u201clegal system.\u201d The idea of creating a \u201clegal system,\u201d or \u201cprisoner code of honor\u201d fascinates Babenco, who stated that the code of honor was one of the most interesting aspects of the film.<ref name=ProQuest237109313/> This highlights a problem rampant in the post-colony \u2013 that of indirect government in both the streets and the prisons.\n\n===Brutality vs. Civilization===\nThe focus on unfair law systems comes into play during the actual massacre during the climax of the film. The prisoners end their revolt and surrender all their makeshift weapons at the request of the prison warden. However, the police force storms the complex anyhow, killing hundreds of defenseless prisoners. The police are illustrated as monsters, killing simply to kill, forcing the audience to question whether the police or the prisoners are more civil. With that, Carandiru illuminates that Brazil has two civilizations, both of which are brutal: those who live under the governmental law and those who live under their own set of laws.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Luiz Carlos Vasconcelos]] as Dr. [[Drauzio Varella]]\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Lady Di\n* [[Milton Gon\u00e7alves]] as Chico\n* [[L\u00e1zaro Ramos]] as Ezequiel\n* [[Caio Blat]] as Deusdete\n* [[Milhem Cortaz]] as Peixeira\n* [[Wagner Moura]] as Zico\n* [[Floriano Peixoto (actor)|Floriano Peixoto]] as Ant\u00f4nio Carlos\n* [[Rita Cadillac (Brazilian dancer)|Rita Cadillac]] as Herself\n* [[Gero Camilo]] as No Way\n* Ivan de Almeida as Ebony\n* [[Ailton Gra\u00e7a]] as Majestade\n* [[Maria Luisa Mendon\u00e7a]] as Dalva\n* Aida Leiner as Rosirene\n* J\u00falia Ianina as Francineide\n* Sabrina Greve as Catarina\n* Nelson Machado as Carioca\n* Dionisio Neto como Lula\n* [[Leona Cavalli]] as Dina\n* S\u00e9rgio Loroza as Gordo\n* [[Sabotage (rapper)|Sabotage]] as Fuinha\n{{div end}}\n\n==Background==\nDirector H\u00e9ctor Babenco shot the film on location in the actual penitentiary, and in [[Neorealism (art)|neo-realist]] fashion he used a huge cast of novice actors \u2014 some of whom are former inmates.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/04/08/carandiru_2004_review.shtml Russell, Jamie].
