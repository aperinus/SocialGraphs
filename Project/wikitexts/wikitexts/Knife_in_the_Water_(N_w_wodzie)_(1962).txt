Its plot follows a husband and wife who are accompanied on a boating trip with a young male hitchhiker, who spurs a number of escalating confrontations between the couple.\n\nThe film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and is Polanski's only Polish-language feature to date. ''Knife in the Water'' has garnered acclaim from film critics since its release, and is one of Polanski's best-reviewed works.\n\n==Plot==\nAndrzej ([[Leon Niemczyk]]) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) are driving to a lake to go sailing when they come upon a young man ([[Zygmunt Malanowicz]]) hitchhiking in the middle of the road. After nearly hitting him, Andrzej invites the young man along. When they arrive at the lake, instead of leaving the young man behind, Andrzej invites him to go sailing with them. The young man accepts the offer, and, not knowing much about sailing, must learn many hard lessons from Andrzej.\n\nMeanwhile, tension gradually builds between Andrzej and the hitchhiker as they vie for the attentions of Krystyna. The title refers to the major turning point in the film when Andrzej taunts the young man with the latter's treasured pocket knife, which is accidentally lost overboard. A fight ensues between Andrzej and the hitchhiker and the latter falls into the water. Andrzej and his wife search for him, but cannot find him and assume that he has drowned, since earlier he said that he could not swim. Andrzej and his wife quarrel about what to do, and Andrzej swims to shore to fetch the police. When the young man realizes that Andrzej has gone he comes out from hiding behind a buoy on the lake and swims to the yacht. There he sees Krystyna naked drying off. He boards the yacht and Krystyna tells him he is as bad as Andrzej but sexual attraction wins out and they have sex, off screen.\n\nKrystyna sails back to the dock, the man jumps off and goes on his way before Andrzej appears and takes charge again. He wants to go to the police to report the young man missing. Krystyna tells him that the young man returned and she was unfaithful. Andrzej does not know what to believe and at the road junction, where they would turn one way to return home and another to go to the police station, the car does not move.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Leon Niemczyk]] as Andrzej\n* Jolanta Umecka as Krystyna\n* [[Zygmunt Malanowicz]] as Young Man\n\nRest of cast listed alphabetically:\n* [[Anna Ciepielewska]] as Krystyna (voice)\n* [[Roman Polanski]] as Young Man (voice)\n\n==Analysis==\nFilm professor Charles Derry notes that ''Knife in the Water'' is atypical from other thrillers due to the fact that it \"represses the usual violence promised by the thriller, [and] it ends its narrative with violence's opposite: a scene of total stasis, in which no action is perfectly acceptable to the husband protagonist.\"{{sfn|Derry|2010|p=93}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe screenplay for the film, written by Polanski, [[Jakub Goldberg]], and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]], was initially rejected by the [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Polish Ministry of Culture]] due to its \"lack of social commitment.\"{{sfn|Caputo|2012|p=17}} Unable to obtain funding in his native Poland, Polanski reworked the screenplay to be set in [[France]], though the production was ultimately unable to receive funding there as well.{{sfn|Caputo|2012|p=17}} After making a number of minor edits to the screenplay\u2014mainly snippets of dialogue demonstrating \"social commitment\" to \"appease the Ministry [of Culture]\"\u2014Polanski again pitched the project to the national film board, who approved it for production.{{sfn|Caputo|2012|p=17}}\n\n===Filming===\n''Knife in the Water'' was shot by Polanski in 1961 using only three actors. It marked Polanski's debut as a feature-length director. Two of the actors (Jolanta Umecka, who plays Krystyna and Zygmunt Malanowicz, who plays the young man) had virtually no previous professional acting experience. [[Krzysztof Komeda]] composed the film's music and the featured saxophonist was [[Bernt Rosengren]].\n\nBeing filmed on the water (in the Polish [[Masurian Lake District]]), and largely within the confines of a sailboat and life raft, the film was technically difficult. While the sailboat was large enough for the three actors, it was quite cramped for the film crew, who often had to hang over the side of the boat with safety harnesses in order to shoot.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/901-knife-in-the-water | title=Knife in the Water | first=Roman | last=Polanski | author-link=Roman Polanski | date=June 12, 1991 | publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Knife in the Water'' was released theatrically in Poland on 9 March 1962.{{sfn|Sanders|2016|p=15}} It premiered in the United States the following year, on 28 October 1963.<ref name=tcmdetails>{{Cite web|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|title=Knife in the Water: Film Details|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80459/knife-in-the-water#film-details|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210717192350/https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80459/knife-in-the-water%23film-details|archive-date=17 July 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Knife in the Water'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[36th Academy Awards|1963 Academy Awards]],<ref name=\"Oscars1964\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1964 |title=The 36th Academy Awards (1964) Nominees and Winners |access-date=2011-11-03|work=oscars.org}}</ref> the first Polish motion picture to receive this kind of recognition.
