Delia is a spirited, working-class woman from a small town in [[New York state]] who leaves her abusive husband and sets out on a journey to reclaim the power she has lost. Greta is a sharp, spunky editor who is rotten with ambition. To spite the hated unfaithful ways of her father, she has settled into a complacent relationship and is struggling (not too hard) with issues of fidelity to her kind but unexciting husband. Finally Paula, who ran away from home and got pregnant, is now in a relationship she doesn't want. She's a troubled young woman who takes off on a journey with a hitchhiker after a strange, fateful encounter on a New York street.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as Delia Shunt\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Greta Herskowitz\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Paula\n* [[John Ventimiglia]] as Narrator\n* [[Ron Leibman]] as Avram Herskovitz\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Gelb\n* [[David Warshofsky]] as Kurt Wurtzle\n* [[Leo Fitzpatrick]] as Mylert\n* [[Tim Guinee]] as Lee\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 103 reviews, and an average rating of 6.5/10.
