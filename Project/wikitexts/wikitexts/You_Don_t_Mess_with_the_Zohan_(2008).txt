It was the fourth film that included a collaboration of Sandler as actor and Dugan as director and tells the story of Zohan Dvir ({{lang-he|\u05d6\u05d5\u05d4\u05df \u05d3\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8}}), an [[Israel]]i army counter terrorist [[commando]] with superhuman traits who fakes his own death in order to pursue his dream of becoming a [[hairdresser|hairstylist]] in [[New York City]] while contending with a crooked businessman and a superhuman terrorist.\n\n''You Don't Mess with the Zohan'' was released on June 6, 2008, in the United States and on August 15, 2008, in the United Kingdom. The film was a box office success, grossing $204.3 million worldwide from a $90 million budget,<ref name=\"mojo\" /> however, despite this, the film received mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nZohan Dvir is a [[promiscuous]], [[superhuman]] [[Israelis|Israeli]] counter-terrorist of the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. Despite his success and popularity, he has grown tired of the everlasting conflicts in his country and dreams of becoming a [[hairstylist]] at [[John Paul Mitchell Systems|Paul Mitchell's]] in the [[United States]]. He finally admits to his parents his desire to cut hair, but they make fun of him.\n\nDuring his next mission against a [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] [[terrorist]] group led by his arch-enemy superhuman Fatoush \"Phantom\" Hakbarah, Zohan [[Pseudocide|fakes his own death]] and smuggles himself onto a plane to [[New York City]], cuts his hair, and adopts the alias \"Scrappy Coco\" after two dogs (Scrappy and Coco) whom he shared the flight with. Following his \"success\" at killing Zohan, Phantom opens a restaurant chain called Phantom Muchentuchen.\n\nAfter his arrival in the United States, Zohan immediately goes to Paul Mitchell's salon to ask for a job where the stylists laugh at him. He tries other salons, but is also refused due to his lack of experience. Zohan befriends a [[American Jews|Jewish]] man named Michael after defending him against a bullying motorist and is taken in by him and his mother Gail. Zohan and Gail have sex, much to Michael's disapproval.\n\nZohan then meets a fellow Israeli immigrant named Oori at a [[disco]]. Oori recognizes Zohan but vows to keep his identity a secret and brings him to an area in lower [[Manhattan]] populated by other Middle Eastern immigrants, including [[Palestinian Americans|Palestinian]] and [[Israeli American|Israeli]] Americans. Zohan attempts to secure a job with the struggling salon of a Palestinian woman named Dalia, but she only allows Zohan to sweep the floors. When a stylist named Nadira unexpectedly quits, one of the customers asks Zohan to cut her hair. Zohan proceeds to give her a sexually charged but exceptional haircut and has sex with her in the bathroom. Zohan's reputation spreads rapidly among the elderly women of lower Manhattan, causing Dalia's business to prosper which upsets Grant Walbridge, a corporate businessman who has been trying to buy out all the local tenants on the block so that he can build a massive mall with a roller coaster in it.\n\nZohan is eventually identified by a Palestinian cab driver named Salim who bears a grudge against Zohan for having taken his beloved goat away in Palestine because Salim spat on him. Salim convinces his friends Hamdi and Nasi to help him kill Zohan. After several failed attempts, they are forced to contact Phantom and convince him to visit New York to find Zohan.\n\nMeanwhile, Zohan has fallen in love with Dalia and comes clean to her, Michael, and Gail about his true identity. After Dalia rejects Zohan for his counter-terrorist background, Zohan decides to leave to protect her and confronts Phantom in a championship [[Hacky Sack]] game sponsored by Walbridge. Zohan's fight is cut short with sudden news of the Middle Eastern neighborhood being attacked and he quickly departs.\n\nAs their businesses [[arson|burn]], Zohan calms the Israelis and Palestinians who each blame the other for the violence and makes peace with Salim. Phantom then appears and confronts Zohan, but Zohan refuses to fight. Dalia appears where she reveals that she is Phantom's sister, and convinces her brother to cooperate with Zohan against the arsonists, revealed to be racist [[white supremacy|white supremacists]] led by James T. O'Scanlon. They were hired by Walbridge to instigate an inter-ethnic riot so he can get his new mall in the aftermath. As Zohan and Phantom work to save the block, Phantom admits that he always wanted to be a shoe salesman rather than a terrorist. Although the racist arsonists are defeated and Walbridge is arrested by the police, the overexcited Phantom accidentally destroys all of the shops on the block with his powerful screams.\n\nWith the Israelis and Palestinians united, the block is rebuilt and transformed into a collectively-owned mall. Phantom opens a shoe shop there, Oori relocates his electronics shop to the mall, Salim gets back his goat from Zohan and starts a goat ride business, and Michael becomes a hairdresser. Zohan and Dalia, having now married, open a beauty salon together. Zohan's parents arrive and approve of his new job and lifestyle before his father requests that he cut his hair, which Zohan happily does.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Zohanele \"Zohan\" Dvir ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: \u05d6\u05d5\u05d4\u05df \u05d3\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8), a superhuman counter-terrorist who aspires to be a stylist and fakes his death to pursue his dream under the alias of \"Scrappy Coco\".\n* [[John Turturro]] as Fatoush \"Phantom\" Hakbarah ([[Arabic]]: \u0641\u062a\u0648\u0634 \u062d\u0643\u0628\u0631\u0629), a superhuman terrorist and Zohan's rival, who, after Zohan's supposed death, opens a chain of kebab Muchentuchen restaurants named \"Phantom Muchentuchen\".
