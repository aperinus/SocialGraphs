It was written by [[Jerome Bixby]], who conceived the screenplay in the early 1960s and completed it on his deathbed in April 1998.<ref name = \"promotional site\">{{cite web | title = The Man From Earth (About) | work = Manfromearth.com | url = http://www.manfromearth.com/ManFromEarth-About.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228142327/http://www.manfromearth.com/ManFromEarth-About.html| archive-date=2012-12-28 | access-date = 2015-11-29}}</ref> It stars [[David Lee Smith]] as John Oldman, a departing university professor, who claims to be a caveman who has secretly survived for more than 14,000 years. The entire film is set in and around Oldman's house during his farewell party and is composed almost entirely of dialogue. The plot advances through intellectual arguments between Oldman and his fellow faculty members.\n\nThe screenplay mirrors similar concepts of longevity which Bixby had introduced in \"[[Requiem for Methuselah]]\", a ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode he wrote which originally aired in 1969. ''The Man from Earth'' gained recognition in part for being widely distributed through Internet [[peer-to-peer]] networks, which raised its profile. The film was later adapted by Schenkman into a stage play.\n\n==Plot==\nProfessor John Oldman is packing his belongings onto his truck, preparing to move to a new home. His colleagues show up to give him an impromptu farewell party: Harry, a [[biologist]]; Edith, an [[art history]] professor and devout [[Christians|Christian]]; Dan, an [[anthropologist]]; Sandy, a [[historian]] who is in (unrequited) love with John; Art, an [[archaeology|archaeologist]]; and his younger student Linda.\n\nAs John's colleagues press him to explain the reason for his departure, he picks up from a reference to [[Magdalenian]] cultures by Dan and slowly, and somewhat reluctantly, reveals that he is a prehistoric [[caveman]] himself from that precise period. He states that he has lived for more than 14 millennia, and that he relocates every ten years to keep others from realizing that [[immortality|he does not age]]. He begins his tale under the guise of a possible science-fiction story, but eventually stops speaking in hypotheticals and begins answering questions from a first-person perspective. His colleagues refuse to believe his story but accept it as a [[working hypothesis]] in order to glean his true intentions. John relates he was a [[Sumer]]ian for 2000 years, later a [[Babylonia]]n, and eventually went east to become a disciple of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]. He claims to have had a chance to sail with [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] (admitting that at the time he [[Myth of the flat Earth|still believed the earth was flat]]) and to have befriended [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] (one of whose original paintings he apparently owns, a gift from the artist himself).\n\nIn the course of the conversation, each guest questions John's story based on knowledge from their own academic specialty. Harry struggles with how biology could allow for the possibility of a human being living for so long. Art, arguably the most skeptical of the group, questions [[prehistory]]. He exclaims that John's answers, although correct, could have come from any textbook; John rejoins that, like any human, his memory is imperfect and he only sees events from his own narrow, hence not [[Omniscience|omniscient]], perspective. Dr. Will Gruber, a [[psychiatry]] professor who arrives at Art's request later that afternoon, questions if John feels guilt for outliving everyone he has ever known and loved. He then threatens John with a gun (later revealed to have been unloaded) before temporarily leaving.  John then learns from Harry that Will's wife had died the previous day after a long illness.  John chases after Will, expresses his condolences  and they both rejoin the group.\n\nThe discussion veers to religion, and John mentions that he does not follow any. Even though he does not necessarily believe in an omnipotent God, he does not discount the possibility of such a being's existence. Pressed by the group, John reluctantly reveals that in trying to take the Buddha's teachings to the west, into the eastern [[Roman Empire]], he became the inspiration for the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Jesus story]]. After this revelation, emotions in the room run high. Edith (the representative \"true believer\" of the group) begins crying. Will demands that John end his tale and give the group a sense of closure by admitting it was all a hoax, and threatens to have John involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluation should he refuse to do so. John appears to ruminate over his response before finally \"confessing\" to everyone that his story was a prank.\n\nJohn's friends leave the party with various reactions: Edith is relieved; Harry indicates an open mind; Art never wants to see John again; Will still believes John needs professional help; Sandy and Linda clearly believe John; Dan is heavily implied to believe John. After everyone else but Will and Sandy have left, Will overhears John and Sandy's conversation, which suggests the story could be true after all. John mentions some of the [[pseudonym]]s he has used over the years, and Will realizes one was his father's name. He asks John questions that only a very close acquaintance could answer. When John answers them correctly, Will has an emotional breakdown, suffers a heart attack, and dies in their arms. After the body has been taken away, Sandy realizes that (if the story is true) this is the first time John has seen one of his grown children die. John wordlessly gets in his truck and starts to drive to an unknown destination. Having reconsidered, he then stops and waits for Sandy, who slowly walks over and gets in. They both depart in John's truck.\n\n==Cast==\nIn order of appearance:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[David Lee Smith]] as John Oldman\n* [[Tony Todd]] as Dan\n* [[John Billingsley]] as Harry\n* [[Ellen Crawford]] as Edith\n* Annika Peterson as Sandy\n* [[William Katt]] as Art Jenkins\n* [[Alexis Thorpe]] as Linda Murphy\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as Dr. Will Gruber\n* Robbie Bryan as Police Officer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe story is [[Jerome Bixby]]'s last work, which he completed on his deathbed in April 1998. Bixby dictated the last of the screenplay to his son, screenwriter Emerson Bixby. After Jerome Bixby's death, the script was given to Richard Schenkman to direct on a budget of just US$200,000 ({{Inflation|US|200000|2007|fmt=eq}}). The film was shot in eight days after a week of rehearsals.<ref name = \"latimes\">{{cite news | last = Fernandez | first = Jay A. | title = A sci-fi writer's final words are brought to life | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2007-07-25 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/07/25/calendar/et-scriptland25 | access-date = 2008-01-07}}</ref>\n\n==Release and marketing==\nThe film screened at the San Diego [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] Film Festival in July 2007, and premiered theatrically in [[Hemet, California]], and [[Pitman, New Jersey]],<ref>[http://blog.nj.com/southjerseylife/2007/11/now_in_theaters.html Movie producer from Newfield releases sci-fi film November 1, 2007 by Senitra Horbrook] at [[Gloucester County Times]].</ref> in October 2007.
