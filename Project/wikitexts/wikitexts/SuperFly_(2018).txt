The film was directed by [[Director X]], written by [[Alex Tse]] and stars [[Trevor Jackson (performer)|Trevor Jackson]], [[Jason Mitchell (actor)|Jason Mitchell]], [[Michael K. Williams]], [[Lex Scott Davis]], and [[Jennifer Morrison]]. Rapper [[Future (rapper)|Future]] produced alongside [[Joel Silver]], as well as writing the film's original songs.\n\n''Superfly'' was released in the United States on June 13, 2018 and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the movie's style but ultimately found a lack of substance.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\n<!-- Remember it's a plot SUMMARY, not a blow-by-blow account of everything that happens -->\nYoungblood Priest is a young [[cocaine]] [[Drug lord|kingpin]] from [[Atlanta, Georgia]], working the streets since he was brought in by his mentor Scatter at age eleven. He lives with his two girlfriends, Georgia and Cynthia.\n\nJuju, a member of rival gang Snow Patrol, hits on Cynthia and, shooting at Priest, accidentally hits a bystander. The Snow Patrol members leave while Priest gives the victim money and directs them to the trauma center.\n\nPriest confides in his second-in-command Eddie that he wants out of drug-dealing, and has a plan. Eddie has his back but Scatter refuses to help. Juju suspects Priest of a hit on Snow Patrol and plans to retaliate. Snow Patrol deduces that Priest's colleague, Fat Freddie, was one of the assailants.\n\nFat Freddie is pulled over by corrupt cops Franklin and Mason. They discover cocaine and find Eddie in Freddie's contacts. With Mason's gun at Freddie's head, Freddie's girlfriend reveals his criminal history and Priest's identity. Franklin kills Freddie and Rochelle.\n\nMason threatens to expose Priest's dealing if he does not work with her. Fighting over recriminations about Freddie's death, Priest starts strangling Eddie and leaves him unconscious. Scatter surprises Priest at Freddie's funeral, ordering him to meet with his supplier Adalberto, after finding out Priest cut a secret deal for more product. Adalberto kills Scatter, having realized he was stealing from him. Adalberto threatens Priest, telling him that he can never get out of the game.\n\nSnow Patrol members led by Juju shoot up Priest's mansion. Cynthia is killed, and Priest and Georgia set fire to the mansion. Chasing Priest, Juju is injured and Q is killed in a car crash. Eddie feigns allegiance with Snow Patrol, and tricks them into an ambush where they are killed by Mason and other cops alerted by Priest.\n\nPriest thanks Eddie for his help and prepares to leave the country with Georgia. He blackmails the mayor with a sex tape and promises the mayor will win the upcoming election. Adalberto is disowned by his mother, and executed at her order after she receives proof that he framed his brother for a crime. Instead of paying off Mason, Priest tips off police and she is arrested for cocaine possession.\n\nPriest meets Franklin and beats him to avenge Freddie's murder. Having settled his business obligations, and with his enemies either dead or in custody, Priest and Georgia relax on a cruise in [[Montenegro]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Trevor Jackson (performer)|Trevor Jackson]] as Youngblood Priest, an [[Atlanta]] drug lord, who sees an opportunity to leave the game before he gets killed.\n* [[Jason Mitchell (actor)|Jason Mitchell]] as Eddie, Priest's right-hand-man.
