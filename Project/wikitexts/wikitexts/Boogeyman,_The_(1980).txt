The film's title refers to the long-held superstition of [[boogeymen]] beings, and its plot concerns two siblings who are targeted by the [[ghost]] of their mother's deceased boyfriend which has been freed from an mirror.\n\nReleased theatrically in November 1980 by the independent distributor the Jerry Gross Organization, ''The Boogeyman'' was a box-office hit, grossing $25 million internationally.\n\nThe film has received mixed to negative critical reviews, with criticism mainly regarding the heavy similarities from earlier horror films such as ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[The Exorcist]]'', and ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]''. The film was followed by two sequels: ''[[Boogeyman II]]'' and ''[[Return of the Boogeyman]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nYoung siblings Willy and Lacey watch their mother and her boyfriend kissing in her bedroom. When their mother notices them, she has her boyfriend tie Willy to his headboard before sending Lacey to her room. Lacey frees Willy from his bed and Willy enters their room and repeatedly stabs his mother's boyfriend with a chef knife in front of a large [[mirror]].\n\nTwenty years later, Lacey, now an adult, is married with a young son and lives with her aunt and uncle on a farm. Willy also lives with them, but has been [[muteness|mute]] since the night he killed his mother's boyfriend. One night over dinner, Lacey finds a letter in the mail from her mother, who claims to be on her [[wikt:deathbed|deathbed]] and wishes to see them one last time, but Willy burns the letter.\n\nLacey suffers from [[nightmare]]s, and has a particularly frightening dream where she is dragged, tied to a bed and almost stabbed by an unseen entity. Her husband, Jake, takes her to a psychiatrist to help her confront her [[fear]]s, and decides to go visit the house she grew up in. They arrive not knowing who is actually living there and meet two teenage girls and their younger brother. Their parents, the [[homeowner]]s, have apparently just placed the home for sale and then gone out of town. The daughter thinks Lacey and Jake have been sent by the [[real estate company]] to view the house. Jake and Lacey pretend they want to buy the house so they can look around. At the house, Lacey sees a reflection of her mother's deceased boyfriend coming towards her in a mirror inside the bedroom where he died, and smashes the mirror in a panic with a chair. Her husband takes the broken mirror with him in an attempt to repair it, but a piece is left behind which later glows red. Shortly after, the teenage girls and their brother are all violently killed by an unseen force; the vengeful spirit of the deceased lover has been released from the mirror.\n\nWilly similarly has disturbing visions involving mirrors, which cause him to paint all the mirrors in the house black. Later, pieces of a broken mirror in a bag at his feet cause a pitchfork to levitate and nearly impale him. A shard from the broken mirror becomes stuck to Lacey's son's shoe and is left on the ground where the light refracts across a lake where a group of teenagers are partying by an abandoned house. A couple are soon impaled by a screwdriver as they are kissing in their car, while another couple drives off and leaves them. Soon after, Lacey flees to get in the house, only to see that her shirt supernaturally starts to tear apart. This also leads her to discover her aunt and uncle dead in the barn.\n\nLater, Lacey's husband brings in the family priest to investigate the mirror, only to see that when the priest's hand touches the mirror, it suddenly turns red. A piece of the mirror floats across the room and becomes lodged over Lacey's eye, letting the ghost possess her body. Controlling Lacey's body, the ghost nearly kills her husband and attacks the priest. Before he dies, the priest removes the shard from Lacey's eye, releasing her from the ghost's control, and throws it into the kitchen sink, where it bursts into flames as it touches the water. The remainder of the mirror is then thrown into a well, where the same thing happens, as an explosion releases the trapped souls and destroys the mirror once and for all.\n\nThe film ends with Lacey, her brother and Kevin visiting the graveyard. After they leave, the final shard of the mirror on the ground, which had gotten stuck to her son's shoe, glows red.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Suzanna Love]] as Lacey\n*Ron James as Jake\n*[[John Carradine]] as Dr. Warren\n*Nicholas Love as Willy\n*Raymond Boyden as Kevin\n\n==Analysis==\nThough the film has been noted as stylistically imitating [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), critic Jeff Franzen notes that the film possess a subtext that is filled with \"multi-layered references to Lommel's childhood and fears, much of which lingers long after you forget about the gimmicky gore\".{{sfn|Franzen|1998|p=35}} Franzen asserts that one of the film's central themes is \"that people conspire to hide the truth, although to one or more characters the truth is obvious\".{{sfn|Franzen|1998|p=35}}\n\n==Production==\n===Concept===\n{{quotebox|align=left|width=27%|quote=\"[Something like] [[Frankenstein]]'s castle is so far removed from our everyday experiences that it's easy to say, 'Oh yeah, well, that's a horror movie'.

Additionally, there is the belief that a mirror in a room where someone has died will show the dead person looking back over the shoulder of anyone looking into the mirror. All this was used in the Mexican translation of the film title, released as \"El espejo asesino\" (\"the killer mirror\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iedb.net/movie/aka/el-espejo-asesino\n|title=El espejo asesino|access-date=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nStylistically, Lommel stated that he wanted to make a \"movie about outrageous killings set in an average-looking environment with ordinary actors.

Lacey travels to Hollywood, to the home of a film director (played by Ulli Lommel himself), where she brings along the last surviving haunted mirror shard from the end of the first movie as proof to her horrifying experiences. One by one, the phonies are killed by the mirror spirit who possesses the body of the director's manservant. ''Boogeyman 2'' is padded with many [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequences from the first film.{{sfn|Franzen|1998|pages=40\u201341}}\n\n''Return of the Boogeyman'' (or ''Boogeyman 3'') was released on May 5, 1994, and is largely constructed around numerous flashbacks to ''The Boogeyman'' as well.{{sfn|Franzen|1998|p=48}}\n\nIn 2016 Hollywood Action House began developing ''Boogeyman Chronicles'', a series of eight 45-min. episodes. The series started with the first episode airing on Halloween 2018 worldwide. It is inspired by Ulli Lommel's 1980 cult hit ''The Boogeyman''. The new storyline was developed after test audiences in the US and Europe saw various cuts of a series of plot-possibilities and characters entitled ''Boogeyman: Reincarnation''. The writing team headed by Colin McCracken is currently working on episodes 2 - 8 with the plan to create a total of up to 64 episodes. Lommel has indicated that, even though he directed episode 1, most of the remaining episodes will be directed by a series of young directors from the US, Europe and Asia. Starring in episode 1 are Skylar Radzion, Laurence R. Harvey, Andreea Boyer and Tristan Risk. It was produced by Frank Dragun, Ulli Lommel and David Bond.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.soiledsinema.com/2013/01/interview-with-ulli-lommel.html|title = Interview with Ulli Lommel|author = |publisher = Soiled Sinema|date = January 29, 2013|access-date = January 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-ulli-lommel-on-franchise-reimagining-boogeyman-reincarnation/|title = Q&A: Ulli Lommel on Franchise Reimagining \"''Boogeyman: Reincarnation''\"|last = Paige|first = Lacey|publisher = Fangoria|date = June 8, 2015|website = [[Fangoria]]|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150612012933/http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-ulli-lommel-on-franchise-reimagining-boogeyman-reincarnation/|archive-date = June 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite magazine|last=Franzen|first=Jeff|year=1998|volume=44|magazine=[[Video Watchdog]]|title=Ulli Lommel: Stranger in Paradise|pages=26\u201349|issn=1070-9991|publisher=Starbrite|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|url=https://archive.org/details/VideoWatchdog44Starbrite/page/n27}}\n* {{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Douglas|year=2004|title=Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More!|volume=1|publisher=Harbor Electronic Pub.|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-1-932-91600-3}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0080464|title=The Boogeyman}}\n* {{AllMovie title|6624|The Boogeyman}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|the_boogey_man_1980|Boogeyman}}\n\n{{Ulli Lommel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boogeyman (1980 film), The}}\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980 films]]\n[[Category:1980 horror films]]\n[[Category:1980 independent films]]\n[[Category:1980 thriller films]]\n[[Category:1980s horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:1980s slasher films]]\n[[Category:1980s supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen horror films]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American slasher films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American teen horror films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ulli Lommel]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Maryland]]\n[[Category:Video nasties]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
