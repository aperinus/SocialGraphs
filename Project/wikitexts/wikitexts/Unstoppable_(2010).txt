It is based on the real-life [[CSX 8888 incident]], telling the story of a [[Runaway train|runaway]] [[Rail freight transport|freight train]] and the two men who attempt to stop it. It was the last film Tony Scott directed before his death in 2012.\n\nThe film was released in the United States and Canada on November 12, 2010. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $167 million against a production budget between $85\u2013100 million. It was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], but lost to ''[[Inception]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile two [[Hostler#Modern uses|yard hostlers]] are moving a mixed-freight Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad (AWVR) train at Fuller [[Classification yard|Yard]] in northern [[Pennsylvania]], Dewey, the engineer, realizes that a [[Facing and trailing|trailing-point]] switch ahead is not correctly aligned and leaves the cab of lead locomotive 777 to change it, after setting the throttle to idle. However, the throttle pops out of idle into full throttle notch 8 before he can get back on the now-accelerating locomotive, leaving the train unattended going south down the mainline.\n\nBelieving the train is coasting, Dewey calls [[yardmaster]] Connie Hooper, who orders lead welder Ned Oldham to get ahead of the train in his pickup truck and switch it off the main track, but when he finds that the train has already passed where it was expected to be, they realize it is running on full power. Connie alerts Oscar Galvin, VP of Train Operations, and contacts local, county, and state police, asking them to block all level crossings, while Ned continues to chase 777 in his truck. [[Federal Railroad Administration]] inspector Scott Werner, while visiting Fuller Yard to meet with students on the Railroad Safety Campaign excursion train (RSC 2002), warns that eight of 777's 39 freight cars contain highly toxic and flammable molten [[phenol]], which would cause a major disaster if the train should derail in a populated area. News of the runaway soon draws ongoing media coverage.\n\nConnie suggests they purposely derail the train while it passes through unpopulated farmland. Galvin dismisses her opinion, believing he can save the railroad money by lashing the train behind two locomotives helmed by veteran engineer Judd Stewart, slowing it down enough for employee and former U.S. Marine Ryan Scott to descend from a helicopter to the control cab of 777. However, Ryan is knocked unconscious during the attempt when 777 suddenly lunges forward as he touches down, sending him crashing into trailing locomotive 767's windshield. When Stewart attempts to divert 777 to a [[Siding (rail)|siding]], he is unable to slow it down and is killed when his locomotives derail at a switch and the diesel fuel ignites and explodes, engulfing the lash-up diesels in a huge fireball. Realizing that 777 will derail on the Stanton Curve, an elevated portion of track in the heavily populated Southern Pennsylvania town of Stanton, Galvin decides to derail the runaway just north of the smaller town of Arklow.\n\nMeanwhile, veteran AWVR [[Train driver|railroad engineer]] Frank Barnes and [[Conductor (rail)|conductor]] Will Colson, a new hire preoccupied with a restraining order from his wife Darcy, are pulling 25 cars with locomotive 1206 on the same line going north out of Brewster Yard in Southern Pennsylvania. Ordered onto a siding off the mainline, they narrowly manage to pull into a [[RIP track]] before 777 races by, smashing through their last [[boxcar]]. Frank observes that 777's last car has an open [[Railway coupling|coupler]] and proposes that they travel in reverse and attempt to couple their engine to the runaway, then use 1206's brakes to slow down 777 before it reaches the Stanton Curve. Will uncouples 1206 from their own cars, while Frank reports his plan to Connie and Galvin, warning that Galvin's idea of using portable [[derail]]ers will not work given 777's momentum. Galvin threatens to fire Frank, who informs Galvin that he has already received a forced, half-benefits, early-retirement notice. Galvin threatens to fire Will as well, but both Frank and Will ignore him and pursue 777.\n\nAs 777 approaches the portable derailers, police sharpshooters first attempt to engage the engine's fuel cutoff button by shooting at it, but are unsuccessful. As Frank predicted, the train barrels through the derailers unhindered, to Galvin's dumbfounded disbelief and horror. Knowing that Frank's plan is their only remaining chance at preventing a cataclysmic disaster, Connie and Werner fully support him and take over control of the situation from Galvin. Meanwhile, Darcy learns from her sister about Will's involvement in the chase, while Frank's daughters learn of their father's involvement from television news coverage at the [[Hooters]] where they both work.\n\nFrank and Will catch up to 777's trailing [[hopper car]] and attempt to engage the coupler, accidentally blowing the seal on the car and spraying grain onto 1206. When the locking pin will not engage, Will kicks it into place, but his foot gets crushed in the process. Will hobbles back to 1206's cab, and Frank tries to slow 777 with the independent brakes, but 777's momentum proves to be too powerful. Will stays in the cab to work the [[Dynamic braking|dynamic brakes]] and throttle while Frank works his way along the top of 777's cars in a risky attempt to engage the handbrakes on each car. Eventually, 1206's brakes burn out due to the traction motors being overworked and the train starts gaining speed again. Using the independent air brake, Will coordinates the brake timing with Frank, and they manage to reduce speed enough to clear the Stanton Curve ([[B & O Railroad Viaduct]]), just barely, with the train tipping but righting itself. As 777 picks up speed, Frank finds his path to 777's cab blocked. Ned arrives in his truck with a police escort on a road parallel to the tracks. Will jumps onto the bed of Ned's truck, and Ned races to the front of 777, where Will leaps onto the locomotive, reduces the throttle to idle, and applies the brakes, finally allowing them to bring the runaway train to a safe stop. Ned and first responders pull up next to the now stopped 777, and Will's injured foot is treated by the paramedics. Darcy arrives with hers and Will's son and reunites with him. Connie arrives shortly thereafter to congratulate them and Ned while Ned is handling the press conference with another AWVR representative, surrounded by friends, family, and vehicles from first responders and news outlets.\n\nFrank, Will, and Ned are hailed as heroes. Before the [[closing credits]], it's revealed that Frank was promoted and later retires with full benefits. Will is happily married to Darcy (who is currently expecting their second child), recovers from his injuries, and continues working with AWVR. Connie is promoted to Galvin's VP position, while it\u2019s implied Galvin was fired for his poor handling of the incident, costing the railroad money and equipment and causing Stewart\u2019s death. Ryan makes a full recovery, and Dewey, who is held responsible for causing the situation, is fired from his job and goes on to work in the fast-food industry.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Frank Barnes, a veteran railroad engineer.\n* [[Chris Pine]] as Will Colson, a young train conductor.\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Connie Hooper, the yardmaster of Fuller Yard.\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Dewey, a hostler who accidentally instigates the disaster.\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Oscar Galvin, vice-president of AWVR train operations.\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Inspector Scott Werner, an [[Federal Railroad Administration|FRA]] inspector who helps Frank, Will, and Connie.\n* [[Kevin Chapman]] as Bunny, a railroad operations dispatcher for Fuller Yard.\n* [[Lew Temple]] as Ned Oldham, a railroad lead welder.\n* [[T.

Led by [[CSX Transportation]] [[EMD SD40-2|SD40-2]] #8888, the train left Stanley Yard in [[Walbridge, Ohio]] with no one at the controls, after the hostler got out of the slow-moving train to correct a misaligned switch, mistakenly believing he had properly set the train's [[dynamic braking]] system, much as his counterpart (Dewey) in the film mistakenly believed he had properly set the locomotive's throttle (in the CSX incident, the locomotive had an older-style throttle stand where the same lever controlled both the throttle and the dynamic brakes; in fact, putting on \"full throttle\" and \"full brakes\" both involved advancing the same lever to the highest position after switching to a different operating mode. Thus if the engineer failed to properly switch modes, it was easy to accidentally apply full throttle instead of full brake, or vice-versa.)\n\nTwo of the train's tank cars contained thousands of gallons of molten [[phenol]], a toxic ingredient used in glues, paints, and dyes. The chemical is very dangerous; it is highly corrosive to the skin, eyes, lungs, and nasal tract. Attempts to derail it using a portable derailer failed, and police had tried to engage the red fuel cutoff button by shooting at it; after having three shots mistakenly hit the red fuel cap, this ultimately had no effect because the button must be pressed for several seconds before the engine would be starved of fuel and shut down. For two hours, the train traveled at speeds up to {{convert|51|mph}} until the crew of a second locomotive, CSX #8392, [[Railway coupling|coupled]] onto the runaway and slowly applied its brakes. Once the runaway was slowed down to {{convert|11|mph}}, CSX trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, and climbed aboard, shutting down the locomotive. The train was stopped at the [[Ohio State Route 31]] crossing, just south-southeast of [[Kenton, Ohio]]. No one was seriously injured in the incident.<ref>{{cite web|title=CSX 8888 \u2013 The Final Report|url=http://kohlin.com/CSX8888/z-final-report.htm|access-date=November 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nRSC 2002 was inspired by a CSX [[Operation Lifesaver]] passenger train, which was turning around at Stanley Yard and was preparing to head back south after having traveled north from Columbus to Walbridge using the same track CSX 8888 was now on. CSX ended up having to bus the safety train's 120 passengers back to the cities at which they had boarded, including Bowling Green, Findlay, and Kenton.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Feehan|first=Jennifer|last2=Lecker|first2=Kelly|date=16 May 2001|title=Disaster avoided during hours of panic, 66 miles of terror|url=https://www.toledoblade.com/frontpage/2001/05/16/Coach-s-ways-are-familiar-to-Toledoans.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210804052550/https://www.toledoblade.com/frontpage/2001/05/16/Coach-s-ways-are-familiar-to-Toledoans.html|archive-date=4 Aug 2021|access-date=2021-08-04|website=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|The Blade]]|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen the film was released, the Toledo ''[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Blade]]'' compared the events of the film to the real-life incident. \"It's predictably exaggerated and dramatized to make it more entertaining,\" wrote David Patch, \"but close enough to the real thing to support the 'Inspired by True Events' announcement that flashes across the screen at its start.\" He notes that the dead man switch would probably have worked in real life despite the unconnected brake hoses, unless the locomotive, or independent brakes, were already applied. As explained in the movie, the dead man's switch failed because the only available brakes were the independent brakes, which were quickly worn through, similar to CSX 8888. The film exaggerates the possible damage the phenol could have caused in a fire, and he found it incredible that the fictional AWVR freely disseminated information such as employees' names and images and the cause of the runaway to the media. In the real instance, he writes, the cause of the runaway was not disclosed until months later when the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] released its report, and CSX never made public the name of the engineer whose error caused the runaway, nor what disciplinary action was taken.<ref>{{cite news|last=Patch|first=David|date=November 12, 2010|title=Hollywood widens truth gauge in runaway train flick|newspaper=Toledo Blade|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Movies/2010/11/12/Hollywood-widens-truth-gauge-in-runaway-train-flick.html|access-date=August 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Unstoppable (soundtrack)}}\nThe film score was composed by [[Harry Gregson-Williams]] and the soundtrack album was released on December 7, 2010.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was scheduled on November 12, 2010 in the United States and Canada.\n\n===Marketing===\nA trailer was released online on August 6, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Adam|date=June 8, 2010|title='Unstoppable' Trailer Rolling Like An Out-Of-Control Freight Train|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/08/06/unstoppable-trailer-rolling-like-an-out-of-control-freight-train|access-date=2010-12-21|website=MTV Movie Blog}}</ref> The film went on general release on November 12, 2010.\n\n===Home media===\n''Unstoppable'' was released on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] on February 15, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Unstoppable (2010)|url=http://videoeta.com/movie.html?via=form&id=99467|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313135611/http://videoeta.com/movie.html?via=form&id=99467|access-date=2011-01-08|website=VideoETA|archivedate=March 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response{{Anchor|Critics}}===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 87% certified fresh based on 193 reviews, with an average rating of 6.92/10.
