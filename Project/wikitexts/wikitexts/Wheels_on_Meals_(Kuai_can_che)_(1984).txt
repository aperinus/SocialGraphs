The film stars Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, [[Yuen Biao]], [[Lola Forner]], [[Benny Urquidez]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Sancho]]. The film was shot in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].\n\nThe film was a box office hit in [[East Asia]], including Japan where the film was released as '''''Spartan X'''''. The film was also well-received by critics for its comedy and action, particularly the final fight between Jackie Chan and Benny Urquidez, which is considered one of the greatest fight scenes of all time. [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team|Jackie Chan with his stunt team]] were nominated for [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography|Best Action Choreography]], for both ''Wheels on Meals'' and ''[[Project A (film)|Project A]]'', at the [[4th Hong Kong Film Awards]], winning the award for ''Project A''.\n\n''Wheels on Meals'' spawned the ''Spartan X'' franchise. In 1984, it was adapted into the video game ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Spartan X]]'' (released as ''Kung-Fu Master'' internationally), which laid the foundations for the [[beat 'em up]] genre of [[action games]]. The video game also had a sequel, ''[[Spartan X 2]]'', and there was a ''Spartan X'' [[comic book]] series. The ''Spartan X'' franchise grossed an estimated total revenue of approximately {{US$|{{#expr:13+121}} million}} worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nThomas and David are cousins who run a fast food van in Barcelona. The food is delivered by Thomas, who rushes around the square on a skateboard. After fending off a biker gang they continue business as normal.\n\nThey pay a visit to David's father, who is in a mental institution, and bump into Sylvia, the daughter of David's father's girlfriend. Thomas encourages his cousin to try to ask her out on a date, but David chickens out of this, making the excuse she would have said no anyway.\n\nLater that night, while at the van serving food, Thomas inadvertently bumps into Sylvia, who is pretending to be a prostitute. She is actually a pickpocket, and she robs a man in a bedroom and runs away to their fast food van.\n\nBoth Thomas and David are enamored by her, but after allowing her to stay in their apartment that night, they wake to find Sylvia and their money gone. The next day, they bump into Moby, a bumbling private investigator who is also tracking Sylvia. They later discover that Sylvia is the heir to a sizable inheritance that a criminal gang is trying to steal from her. When she is kidnapped, Thomas, David and Moby team up to save her, infiltrating the villains' castle and defeating them in a martial arts battle. The final scene of the film shows David, Thomas and Sylvia reunited. Sylvia asks for a summer job, and Moby asks David and Thomas if they wish to work as private detectives with him, which they refuse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] \u2013 Thomas\n* [[Sammo Hung]] \u2013 Moby\n* [[Yuen Biao]] \u2013 David\n* [[Lola Forner]] \u2013 Sylvia\n* [[Benny Urquidez]] \u2013 Thug #1\n* [[Keith Vitali]] \u2013 Thug #2\n* [[Herb Edelman]] \u2013 Henry Matt\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Sancho]] \u2013 Mondale\n* Susanna Sent\u00eds \u2013 Gloria\n* Paul Chang \u2013 David's father\n* Amparo Moreno - Susana\n* [[Richard Ng]] \u2013 Mental Patient (Brilliant)\n* [[John Shum]] \u2013 Mental Patient (Laughing)\n* [[Wu Ma]] \u2013 Mental Patient (Clock)\n* Lau Sau-leung \u2013 Mondale Punk\n* [[Blackie Ko]] \u2013 Delinquent Biker\n* [[Mars (actor)|Mars]]\n* [[Stanley Fung]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Title===\nThe film's title was supposed to be ''Meals on Wheels''.

This was something of a golden period for Hong Kong cinema-goers, as three of the nation's most beloved action stars performed together on screen.\n\nThe film also features [[cameo appearance]]s from fellow Lucky Stars [[Richard Ng]] and [[John Shum]] as mental patients in the hospital attended by the father of Yuen's character.\n\n''Wheels on Meals'' was the first of two films which paired star [[Jackie Chan]] against former professional [[kickboxing]] champion [[Benny Urquidez]] (the other being the 1988 film ''[[Dragons Forever]]''). Their fight in this film is typically regarded as one of the greatest on-screen martial arts fights ever performed. At one point in the final battle between the pair, a spin-kick performed by Urquidez is so quick that the resulting airflow extinguishes a row of candles. This is shown onscreen, with no cuts or trick photography.\n\nCo-star [[Lola Forner]] appeared in another [[Jackie Chan]] film, ''[[Armour of God (film)|Armour of God]]'' (1987).\n\n===Filming===\nAudio commentator Bey Logan explains why Sammo Hung decided to shoot the film outside of Hong Kong. By the time it was made in 1984, shooting in Hong Kong had become practically impossible \u2013 firstly, because the action stars had become so famous that they could not walk through the streets with impunity, and secondly due to the mounting difficulties in obtaining a permit from the government in order to film in Hong Kong. Bruce Lee had paved the way for Hong Kong filmmakers shooting abroad with the 1972 film ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', whose location filming was done in Italy, whereas the interiors had been shot at [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] studio.\n\nWhen Hung took his cast and crew to [[Barcelona, Catalonia|Barcelona]], he wanted to strongly establish the locations in Barcelona as real, and to avoid shooting interiors at Golden Harvest. In comparison to [[Hong Kong]], the Spanish authorities were very cooperative in allowing the use of locations for filming, even for car chases and fight scenes.<ref name=\"Wheelsonmeals\">{{cite video | title = ''Wheels on Meals'', Audio commentary Bey Logan Disc 1, Sammo Hung interview Disc 2 (DVD featurette) | medium = DVD | publisher = [[Hong Kong Legends]], UK | date = 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nDuring its [[Hong Kong]] theatrical run, ''Wheels on Meals'' grossed {{HK$}}21,465,013<ref>{{cite web |title=Wheels on Meals (1984) |url=http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=6604 |website=[[Hong Kong Movie DataBase]] |access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:21465013/7.818 round 0}}|link=yes}}),<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) - Hong Kong |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1984&locations=HK&start=1983 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1984 |access-date=22 June 2020}}</ref> becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of the year in Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c8\u56de\uff1a\u9999\u6e2f\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |trans-title=[Jackie Chan Box Office Results] 8th: Box Office Revenue in Hong Kong |url=https://kungfutube.info/3129 |website=KungFu Tube |date=2010-08-16 |access-date=22 June 2020 |language=ja}}</ref> In [[Taiwan]], where it ran during September{{ndash}}October 1984, it became the third highest-grossing film of the year, earning {{TWD|23,455,346}}<ref>{{cite web |title=1984 Taiwan Box Office |url=http://cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a84.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010219163210/http://cinema.nccu.edu.tw/box/3a/3a84.htm |website=[[National Chengchi University]] |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 February 2001 |language=zh |access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref> (US$601,075).<ref>{{cite web |title=Historical currency converter with official exchange rates (TWD) |url=https://fxtop.com/en/historical-currency-converter.php?A=23455346&C1=TWD&C2=USD&DD=31&MM=10&YYYY=1984 |website=fxtop.com |date=31 October 1984 |access-date=22 June 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Japan]], where it released as ''Spartan X'', it grossed {{JPY|2.02 billion|link=yes}}<ref>{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c12\u56de\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |trans-title=[Jackie Chan Box Office Results] 12th: Box Office in Japan |url=http://kungfutube.info/3672 |website=KungFu Tube |year=2012 |access-date=7 December 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:2020/237.52 round 2}} million}}),<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) - Japan |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1984&locations=JP&start=1983 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1984 |access-date=22 June 2020}}</ref> becoming the sixth highest-grossing foreign film of 1985.<ref>{{cite web |title=1985\u5e74\uff081\u6708\uff5e12\u6708\uff09 |url=http://www.eiren.org/toukei/1985.html |website=Eiren |publisher=Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan |access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref> In [[South Korea]], it was the second highest-grossing film of 1985, with 307,751 box admissions in [[Seoul]],<ref name=\"korea2\">{{cite web |title=\u3010\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u8208\u884c\u6210\u7e3e\u3011 \u7b2c10\u56de\uff1a\u97d3\u56fd\u3067\u306e\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165 |trans-title=[Jackie Chan Box Office Results] 10th: Box Office in Korea |url=http://kungfutube.info/3156 |website=KungFu Tube |date=5 September 2010 |access-date=7 December 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> equivalent to an estimated {{Currency|{{#expr:307751*3500}}|KRW}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Park |first1=Seung Hyun |title=A Cultural Interpretation of Korean Cinema, 1988-1997 |date=2000 |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ilEeAQAAMAAJ |quote=Average Ticket Prices in Korea, 1974-1997 [...] * Source: Korea Cinema Yearbook (1997-1998) * Currency: won [...] Foreign [...] 1985 [...] 3,500}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:1077128500/870.02 round 0}}|link=no}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) - Korea, Rep. |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1985&locations=KR&start=1984 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1985 |access-date=7 December 2018}}</ref> Combined, the film's total estimated box office gross in [[East Asia]] was approximately {{US$|{{#expr:2745589+601075+8500000+1238050}}|long=yes}}, equivalent to {{US$|{{Inflation|US|13.084714|1984}} million}} adjusted for inflation.\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film was generally well-received by critics.
