The film is based on the [[Paranoid Park (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Blake Nelson]] and takes place in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]]. It's the story of a teenage skateboarder (played by [[Gabe Nevins]]) set against the backdrop of a police investigation into a mysterious death.\n\nVan Sant wrote the draft script in two days after reading and deciding to adapt Nelson's novel. To cast the film's youths, Van Sant posted an open casting call on social networking website [[MySpace]] inviting teenagers to audition for speaking roles, as well as experienced skateboarders to act as [[extra (actor)|extras]]. Filming began in October 2006 and took place at various locations in and around Portland. Scenes at the fictional Eastside Skatepark were filmed at [[Burnside Skatepark]] which was, like Eastside, built illegally by skateboarders.\n\n''Paranoid Park'' premiered on May 21, at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]] and was given a [[limited release]] on March 7, 2008. It grossed over [[United States dollar|US$]]4,481,000 from its $3 million budget.<ref name=tdt>{{cite news| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3670186/Paranoid-Park-The-voice-of-doomed-youth.html| title = Paranoid Park: The voice of doomed youth| access-date = 2009-04-06| date = December 28, 2007| work = [[The Daily Telegraph]]| first = David| last = Gritten| location = London| archive-date = 2012-11-11| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121111103323/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3670186/Paranoid-Park-The-voice-of-doomed-youth.html| url-status = live}}</ref> The film received mostly positive reviews; some critics praised the direction and cinematography in particular, though others believed the film to be overly stylized and slow paced. It won one [[Independent Spirit Award]], two [[Boston Society of Film Critics]] awards and the Cannes Film Festival's special [[2007 Cannes Film Festival|60th anniversary]] prize.\n\n==Plot==\nAlthough the film is told in non-chronological order, the following synopsis tells the plot of the film in order.\n\nAlex, a 16-year-old skateboarder, rides a freight train clandestinely with a man named Scratch whom he has just met at the Eastside Skatepark, known as \"Paranoid Park\". While the train is moving a security guard notices the pair, chases after them, and tries to get them off by hitting Scratch with his flashlight. During the melee, Alex hits him with his skateboard and the guard, losing balance, falls onto another track into the path of an oncoming freight train which cuts him in half. Alex tries to destroy some of the evidence. For example, he throws his skateboard into the [[Willamette River]] from the [[Steel Bridge]], and when he arrives at his friend Jared's house, he showers and disposes of the clothes he had been wearing.\n\nAlex is later questioned at school by Detective Richard Lu, as are several other students who had been skateboarding on the night in question. It is revealed that the police have recovered Alex's skateboard, though they have not traced it back to him, and have identified [[DNA]] evidence which places the skateboard at the scene of the security guard's death.\n\nThroughout the film, Alex keeps the incident to himself, and does not confide in anyone else. After having impassive sex with his girlfriend, Jennifer, he breaks up with her. Another of his friends, Macy, notices that he is worried about something. She advises him to write down whatever is bothering him as a [[catharsis|cathartic]] release if nothing else. He initially rejects the idea, but eventually writes an account, which becomes the basis for the story. After completing the written account, Alex burns it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gabe Nevins]] as Alex\n* Daniel Liu as Detective Richard Lu\n* Jake Miller as Jared\n* [[Taylor Momsen]] as Jennifer\n* Lauren McKinney as Macy\n* Scott Patrick Green as Scratch\n* John Burrowes as Security Guard\n\n==Production==\nGus Van Sant chose to [[film adaptation|adapt]] American author [[Blake Nelson]]'s novel ''[[Paranoid Park (novel)|Paranoid Park]]'' into a film of the same name because it was set in his hometown of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], because he was an amateur skateboarder himself and because he found the story particularly interesting.<ref name=prodnotes>{{cite press release| url = http://thecia.com.au/reviews/p/images/paranoid-park-production-notes.rtf| title = Paranoid Park| access-date = 2009-04-06| publisher = Madman Cinema| archive-date = 2009-10-08| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091008164708/http://thecia.com.au/reviews/p/images/paranoid-park-production-notes.rtf| url-status = live}}</ref> At the time that he first read the novel, he was accumulating the finances for another film, but abandoned the project and decided instead to write a screenplay based on Nelson's story.<ref name=times>{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/movies/02nels.html?_r=1| title = Back in Portland, the Latest Outsider Has a Skateboard| access-date = 2009-04-06| date = March 2, 2008| work = [[The New York Times]]| author = Nelson, Blake| author-link = Blake Nelson| archive-date = 2009-04-17| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090417094227/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/movies/02nels.html?_r=1| url-status = live}}</ref> His first draft of the script was written in two days,<ref name=times/> and the final draft was just 33 pages long.<ref name=elle>{{cite web| url = http://ellegirl.elle.com/entertainment/tv_movies/content/taylor_momsen_on_paranoid_park.html| title = Taylor Momsen on Paranoid Park| access-date = 2009-04-06| work = [[Elle Girl]]| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090301014427/http://ellegirl.elle.com/entertainment/tv_movies/content/taylor_momsen_on_paranoid_park.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->| archive-date = 2009-03-01}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to his 2003 film ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'', Van Sant sought non-professional young actors to play the main roles, and so created a page for the film on social networking site [[MySpace]]. On the page, he posted an open casting call for males and females aged 14\u201318 who were \"skaters, honor roll [students], cheerleaders, punks, drama kids, musicians, artists, student council [members], athletes, award winners, class skippers, photographers, band members, leaders, followers, shy kids, class clowns\".<ref name=wired>{{cite web| url = https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2008/03/paranoid_park| title = Filmmakers Find Fresh Talent on MySpace| access-date = 2009-04-06| date = March 14, 2008| work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]| first = Hugh| last = Hart| archive-date = 2009-05-15| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090515125450/http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2008/03/paranoid_park| url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=ifilm>{{cite press release| url = http://www.independentfilm.com/resources/gus-van-sant-independent-film-audition-2006.shtml| title = Filmmaker Gus Van Sant Offers Regional Teens a Unique Shot at the Spotlight with Casting Calls for 'Paranoid Park'| access-date = 2009-04-06| date = July 26, 2006| publisher = Lana Veenker Casting| archive-date = 2011-07-21| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721235755/http://www.independentfilm.com/resources/gus-van-sant-independent-film-audition-2006.shtml| url-status = live}}</ref> Two audition sessions were held on August 3 and August 5, 2006, as well as an additional casting call for experienced skateboarders to act as [[extra (actor)|extras]] in the film;<ref name=ifilm/> a total of 2,971 people auditioned.<ref name=wired/> [[Gabe Nevins]], having never acted before, heard about the casting call from a skateboard store and originally auditioned as an extra.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2007/12/24/gabe_nevins_paranoid_park_2007_interview.shtml| title = Gabe Nevins: Paranoid Park| access-date = 2009-04-06| date = December 24, 2007| work = [[BBC]]| first = Kate| last = Lloyd| archive-date = 2007-12-28| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071228133413/http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2007/12/24/gabe_nevins_paranoid_park_2007_interview.shtml| url-status = live}}</ref> Nevins was cast in the lead role, which he says was based on his innocence that Van Sant believed trained actors to be lacking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2008/030608/film1.html |title=Twist of skate |access-date=2009-04-06 |date=March 6, 2008 |work=[[Montreal Mirror]] |first=Matthew |last=Hays |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012204104/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2008/030608/film1.html |archive-date=2008-10-12 }}</ref> Jake Miller, originally from [[Boise, Idaho]], was on a [[road trip]] in Portland when he heard about the casting call and decided to audition with his friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/2007/09/younghollywood?slide=3 |title=Almost Famous |access-date=2009-04-06 |date=September 2007 |work=[[Teen Vogue]] |first=Lauren |last=Waterman |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228002227/http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/2007/09/younghollywood?slide=3 |archive-date=2011-02-28 }}</ref> [[Taylor Momsen]] was a professional actor beforehand and received the ''Paranoid Park'' script through her agent.
