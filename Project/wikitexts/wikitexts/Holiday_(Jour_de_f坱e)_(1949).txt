Shot largely in and around [[Sainte-S\u00e9v\u00e8re-sur-Indre]], where Tati had lived during the [[Occupation of France|Occupation]], most of the actors were unknown and villagers served as extras.\n\n==Plot==\nOn a public holiday, a young boy watches a travelling fair arrive in his village of [[Sainte-S\u00e9v\u00e8re-sur-Indre]]. Among the locals is Fran\u00e7ois, the amiable and bumbling mailman, whom everybody likes but nobody takes seriously. Marcel and Roger, the two men running the fair, make him their butt and get him drunk. In the cinema tent, people watch a spoof documentary that contrasts the unbelievable efficiency of the [[United States Post Office Department|US post office]] with the antiquated [[Postes, T\u00e9l\u00e9graphes et T\u00e9l\u00e9phones (France)|French post office]]. They decide that Fran\u00e7ois must get up to date and, although he only has a bicycle, must start using transatlantic dash in his delivery. In the end, exhausted by his frantic efforts, he stops to help a family pitchfork their new-mown hay into a horse-drawn cart, while the boy from the opening scene completes the deliveries on Fran\u00e7ois's route.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jacques Tati]] as Fran\u00e7ois\n*[[Paul Frankeur]] as Marcel\n*[[Guy Decomble]] as Roger\n\n==Themes==\nIn ''Jour de f\u00eate'', several characteristics of Tati's work appear for the first time in a full-length film. Largely a visual comedy in the silent tradition, dialogue is used at times to tell part of the story and an ancient woman with a goat appears sybil-like on occasions as a commentator. Music is mostly diegetic, coming from the carousel, the village brass band, and the pianola in the bar. Sound effects are a vital element, with imaginative use of voices and other background noises, particularly of birds, to provide both ambiance and humor.\n\nGiving a sympathetic portrayal of what was already a vanishing way of life, where the villagers do not yet have cars or tractors and water comes from the pump, the film introduces what would be a key theme of Tati's films. Instead of rounded individuals rooted in communities, changes in Western society were turning people into operators of technology and consumers of its products. Though much of this trend originated in the USA, France was catching up fast.<ref>{{citation|last = Guigueno |first = Vincent |article = L'\u00e9cran de la productivit\u00e9: \"Jour de f\u00eate\" et l'am\u00e9ricanisation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise |title = Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle.

In using both formats, Tati feared that Thomsoncolor might not be practical, a well-founded concern when the firm proved unable to complete the processing. A colour version has subsequently been released, with a prologue detailing the failure of the original colour recording and asserting that the new version is in accordance with the director's intentions. This version is in fact the work of Sophie Tatischeff, editor and daughter of Jacques Tati, and Fran\u00e7ois Ede, cinematographer, who meticulously edited and restored the film from the original camera negative which had been preserved and stored away for years. The optical system device that allowed the restitution of the colors was restored and allowed, more than forty years after the shooting, to produce the original colors of the film.\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Theatrical===\nOver 7 million tickets for ''Jour de f\u00eate'' had been sold in French cinemas up to 2015, making it one of the top 40 most popular French films of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/top100.php?variable=France |title=TOP250 All-Time |website=www.jpbox-office.com |access-date=31 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on {{nowrap|21 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 8.3/10.<ref name=\"rottomatoes\">{{cite web|title=The Big Day (Jour de Fete) (1952) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_day_1952|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|publisher=Fandango Media|accessdate=2 January 2021}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0040497}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|the_big_day_1952}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070609165325/http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/jourdefete.htm DVDBeaver comparison between black&white and colour DVD versions of the film]\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3339-jacques-tati-things-fall-together ''Jacques Tati: Things Fall Together''] an essay by [[David Cairns (writer)|David Cairns]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Jacques Tati}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jour de Fete}}\n[[Category:1949 films]]\n[[Category:1949 comedy films]]\n[[Category:French comedy films]]\n[[Category:Cycling films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jacques Tati]]\n[[Category:French black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:1940s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1940s French films]]"}]}}}}
