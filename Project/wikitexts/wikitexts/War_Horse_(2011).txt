The film's ensemble cast includes   <!--PER END CREDITS.-->[[Jeremy Irvine]] (in his feature film debut), [[Peter Mullan]], [[Emily Watson]], [[Niels Arestrup]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Tom Hiddleston]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]].\n\nSet before and during [[World War I]], it tells of the journey of Joey, a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[Irish Sport Horse|Irish Hunter]] horse raised by British teenager Albert (Irvine), as he is bought by the British Army, leading him to encounter numerous individuals and owners throughout Europe, all the while experiencing the tragedies of the war happening around him. [[DreamWorks Pictures]] acquired the film rights to the novel in December 2009, with Spielberg announced to direct the film in May 2010. Having directed many films set during [[World War II]], it was his first film to tackle the events of World War I. Shot in England over 63 days, the production used 5,800 extras and 300 horses. Longtime Spielberg collaborators [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]], [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]], [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]], [[Rick Carter]], and [[John Williams]] all worked on the film as producer, cinematographer, editor, production designer, and composer, respectively.\n\nProduced by DreamWorks Pictures and released worldwide by [[Touchstone Pictures]], ''War Horse'' became a box-office success and was met with positive reviews. The film was named one of the top ten [[2011 in film|best films of 2011]] by the [[American Film Institute]] and the [[National Board of Review]], and  was nominated for six [[84th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), two [[69th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]], and five [[65th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]]s.\n\n==Plot== \nIn 1912, a bay [[Irish Sport Horse|Irish Hunter]] is born in [[Devon]], England. At an auction, farmer Ted Narracott outbids his landlord Lyons for the [[colt (horse)|colt]], to the dismay of his wife Rose, because the family needs a working horse that can plough the field, not an Irish Hunter. Their son Albert, accompanied by his best friend Andrew, names the colt Joey, and teaches him to come when he imitates an owl's call. The pair form a close bond. Against all odds, the horse and boy successfully plough a rocky field, saving the family's farm.\n\nRose shows Albert his father's medals from the [[Second Boer War]], and gives him Ted's [[Military colours, standards and guidons|regimental pennant]], confiding in Albert that his father carries physical and mental scars from the war.\n\nIn 1914, as [[British entry into World War I|war with Germany is declared]], heavy rain ruins the family's crops, forcing Ted to sell Joey to the [[British Army|army]]. Albert is heartbroken and tries to stop the sale but is too late. Captain James Nicholls sees Albert's attachment to the horse and promises to look after Joey. Albert tries to enlist but is too young, and before the company departs, he ties his father's pennant to Joey's bridle and promises Joey he will find him.\n\nJoey bonds with Topthorn, a black stallion with whom he is trained for his military role. The horses are deployed to [[Flanders]] with a [[flying column]] under the command of Nicholls and Major Stewart. They lead a [[Charge (warfare)#Cavalry charges|cavalry charge]] through a German encampment, but the unit is decimated by [[machine gun]] fire. Nicholls is killed along with almost all his fellow cavalrymen and the Germans capture the horses.\n\nGunther, a young German soldier, is assigned to the care of Joey and Topthorn. When his younger brother Michael is sent to the front lines, Gunther takes the horses and the four of them desert. The German army soon tracks down the boys, who are shot for desertion, but the Germans leave without noticing the horses. They are found by a French girl named Emilie the next morning. German soldiers arrive at her grandfather's farm, but Emilie hides the horses in her bedroom. For her birthday, Emilie's grandfather allows her to ride Joey, but they run into the Germans who confiscate the horses. Emilie's grandfather keeps the pennant.\n\nBy 1918, Albert has finally enlisted and is now fighting alongside Andrew in the [[Second Battle of the Somme]]. After a British charge into [[no man's land]], Albert and Andrew miraculously make it across to the German trench, where a [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas bomb]] explodes. Andrew is killed by the gas attack while Albert survives, temporarily blinded.\n\nThe Germans use Joey and Topthorn to haul artillery, under the care of Private Hengelmann. He cares for them as best as he can, but Topthorn succumbs to exhaustion and dies. Devastated over the loss of an animal he came to care for, Hengelmann rebels against his commanders and is detained; but not before freeing Joey from his reins. Joey escapes, narrowly evading an oncoming [[Mark IV tank|tank]], and gallops into [[no man's land]], becoming entangled in barbed wire. Colin, a British soldier, makes his way to Joey under a white flag and tries to free him. Peter, a German soldier, comes over with wire cutters, and together they rescue Joey. To decide who should take the horse, they flip a coin, and Colin wins and guides the injured Joey to the British trench. Albert hears about Joey's rescue while recuperating. Just as Joey is about to be put down by a doctor who deems the horse too injured to recover, Joey hears Albert's owl call. Albert, his eyes still bandaged, is able to describe Joey in perfect detail, and the two are reunited. The doctor decides to nurse Joey back to health.\n\nWorld War I [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|ends]], and Joey is ordered to be auctioned because only the horses of officers will return home. Albert's comrades raise a collection to bid for the horse. The auction is won by Emilie's grandfather, who implies that Emilie has died and the horse is all he has left of her. However, after Albert pleads with him, the old man recognizes the strength of the soldier's bond, and returns the pennant and Joey to Albert. Albert returns with Joey to his family's farm, embracing his mother and returning the pennant to his father, who extends his hand to him with pride, as Joey watches.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jeremy Irvine]] as Albert Narracott\n* [[Peter Mullan]] as Ted Narracott\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Rose Narracott\n* [[Niels Arestrup]] as Grandfather\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Lyons\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Captain James Nicholls\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Major Jamie Stewart\n* [[C\u00e9line Buckens]] as Emilie\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Colin\n* [[Patrick Kennedy (actor)|Patrick Kennedy]] as Lieutenant Charlie Waverly\n* [[Leonard Carow]] as Private Michael Schr\u00f6der\n* [[David Kross]] as Private Gunther Schr\u00f6der\n* [[Matt Milne]] as Andrew Easton\n* [[Robert Emms]] as David Lyons\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Sergeant Fry\n* [[Nicolas Bro]] as Private Friedrich Hengelmann\n* [[Rainer Bock]] as Brandt\n* [[Hinnerk Sch\u00f6nemann]] as Peter\n* Gary Lydon as Si Easton\n* [[Geoff Bell (actor)|Geoff Bell]] as Sergeant Sam Perkins\n* [[Liam Cunningham]] as British Army Doctor\n* Sebastian Hulk as German Officer at Darm\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as Market Auctioneer\n* [[Tony Pitts]] as Sergeant Martin\n* [[Pip Torrens]] as Major Tompkins\n* [[Philippe Nahon]] as French Auctioneer\n* Jean-Claude Lecas as Butcher\n* [[Julian Wadham]] as British Captain in Trench\n* [[David Dencik]] as German Base Camp Officer\n* [[Edward Bennett (actor)|Edward Bennett]] as Cavalry Recruiting Officer\n* [[Johnny Harris (actor)|Johnny Harris]] as Infantry Recruiting Officer\n* [[Tam Dean Burn]] as British Medic in Trench\n* [[Maximilian Br\u00fcckner]] as German Artillery Officer\n* [[Maggie Ollerenshaw]] as the Narracotts' neighbour\n* [[Michael Ryan (actor)|Michael Ryan]] as British Trench Soldier #1\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Background and development===\n[[File:Michael Morpurgo 20090315 Salon du livre 1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Michael Morpurgo]], the author of the novel on which the film is based]]\n\n[[Michael Morpurgo]] wrote the 1982 children's novel ''[[War Horse (novel)|War Horse]]'' after meeting World War I veterans in the Devon village of [[Iddesleigh]] where he lived.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morpurgo |first1=Michael |title=First world war centenary is a year to honour the dead but not to glorify |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/01/first-world-war-centenary-michael-morpurgo |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=5 September 2020 |archive-date=29 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529145628/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/01/first-world-war-centenary-michael-morpurgo |url-status=live }}</ref> One had been with the [[Royal Devon Yeomanry|Devon Yeomanry]] and was involved with horses; Captain Budgett, another veteran in his village, was with the [[British cavalry]] and told Morpurgo how he had confided all his hopes and fears to his horse.
