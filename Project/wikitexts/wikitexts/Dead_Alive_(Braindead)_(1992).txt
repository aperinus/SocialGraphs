It stars [[Tim Balme|Timothy Balme]], [[Diana Pe\u00f1alver]], [[Elizabeth Moody (actor)|Elizabeth Moody]] and [[Ian Watkin]]. The plot follows Lionel, a young man living in South Wellington with his strict mother Vera. After Lionel becomes romantically entangled with a girl named Paquita, Vera is bitten by a hybrid rat-monkey creature and begins  to transform into a zombie, while also infecting swathes of the city's populace.\n\nMade on a budget of $3 million, ''Braindead'' was Jackson's most expensive film up to that point.<ref>{{cite book |title=Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008 |url=https://archive.org/details/comedyhorrorfilm00hall|url-access=limited |last=Hallenbeck |first=Bruce G.|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2009 |isbn=9780786453788|pages=187\u2013188}}</ref> Although it received positive reviews from critics, it was a [[box office bomb]].

During the team's escape from the island's warrior natives, who demand the return of the creature, Stewart is bitten by the rat-monkey, resulting in his dismemberment and killing by his crew, who fear the effects of the bite. As per Stewart's warning to the natives, \"this monkey's going to [[Newtown, New Zealand|Newtown]]\", the captured rat-monkey is then shipped to [[Wellington Zoo]] by the survivors of the expedition.\n\nIn Wellington, Lionel Cosgrove lives in [[Hataitai]] in a Victorian mansion with his domineering mother Vera. When he was a child, Lionel's father drowned trying to save him at the beach, and the incident has haunted him into adulthood. To Vera's dismay, Lionel falls in love with a [[Spanish Romani]] shopkeeper's daughter, Paquita Mar\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, who is convinced the two are destined to be together. When the two visit the Wellington zoo together on a date, Vera follows them and is bitten by the rat-monkey, killing the animal in the process. Over the following days, she grows increasingly more decrepit; her skin begins to peel and her ear falls off during lunch with friends. She appears to die before reanimating as a ravenous [[zombie]] and killing the attending nurse Mrs. McTavish, who also returns as a zombie, before Lionel locks them both in the basement and keeps them sedated with animal tranquilizers. While visiting Paquita, Lionel is given a pendant for luck by her grandmother. Vera is able to break out of the basement and is ran over into Paquita's shop by a [[Wellington tramway system|tram]], but Lionel tranquilizes Vera before she attacks them.\n\nAt her funeral, Lionel tranquilizes Vera to keep her from attacking the mourners. Later, while returning to the graveyard to administer more of it, he is accosted and beaten by a group of [[hoodlums]] who presume him to be a [[necrophilia]]c. Vera suddenly bursts from her grave and attacks the hoodlums. In the ensuing commotion, the gang leader \"Void\", as well as the local priest Father McGruder, are bitten and become zombies, so Lionel has to keep them locked in the basement too. After the nurse and priest copulate and produce a zombie baby, Lionel breaks up with Paquita to keep her safe. Shortly afterward, Lionel's uncle Les arrives to wrangle with Lionel over Vera's estate. Discovering the zombies, which he believes to be dead bodies, in the basement, Les blackmails his nephew into giving up the house and his inheritance and invites his friends over for a housewarming party despite Lionel's objections.\n\nDuring the party, Paquita arrives to try to make amends with Lionel. She discovers the zombies in the basement, and Lionel explains to her all that has occurred. She is able to convince Lionel to administer poison to the zombies to finally kill them, but after injecting the zombies with it, he discovers the poison is animal stimulants, which revives them. They narrowly escape the now-enhanced zombies, who burst into the house upstairs and slaughter the party guests. The guests subsequently reanimate and begin to attack the survivors. Lionel enters the house with a lawnmower and proceeds to mow through a horde of zombies, while Paquita tries to dispose of zombie body parts in the blender. Les enters the basement, where he is beheaded by Vera, who has now grown to monstrous proportions. Vera erupts from the basement and pursues them both to the rooftop as the house catches fire from a burst gas pipe.\n\nAs Vera corners them on the roof, Lionel confronts his mother and reveals that he witnessed Vera drowning his father and his lover in the bathtub as a child, and proclaims that he is no longer afraid of her. Vera becomes enraged and swallows Lionel with an opening in her stomach before trying to kill Paquita. Lionel cuts his way out of his mother's body with the good luck pendant, causing Vera to fall back into the burning house. Lionel and Paquita escape the burning rooftop as the fire brigade arrives. They kiss and then walk away arm-in-arm.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tim Balme|Timothy Balme]] as Lionel Cosgrove\n* [[Diana Pe\u00f1alver]] as Paquita Mar\u00eda S\u00e1nchez\n* [[Elizabeth Moody (actor)|Elizabeth Moody]] as Vera Cosgrove \n** Elizabeth Brimilcombe as Zombie Vera\n* [[Ian Watkin]] as Uncle Les \n* Brenda Kendall as Nurse McTavish\n* [[Stuart Devenie]] as Father McGruder \n** [[Stephen Papps]] as Zombie McGruder\n* [[Jed Brophy]] as Void\n* Murray Keane as Scroat\n* Glenis Levestam as Nora Matheson\n* Lewis Rowe as Albert Matheson\n* Elizabeth Mullane as Rita\n* [[Harry Sinclair]] as Roger\n* [[Davina Whitehouse]] as Paquita's Grandmother\n* Silvio Famularo as Paquita's father\n* Daniel Sabic as Baby Selwyn (body)\n** Vicki Walker as Baby Selwyn (voice)\n* [[Bill Ralston]] as Zoo official Stewart McAlden\n* [[Brian Sergent]] as Vet\n* [[Forrest J Ackerman]] as Forry (Tourist at Zoo with ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland|Monsters of Filmland]]'' magazine)\n* [[Peter Vere-Jones]] as the Undertaker\n* Tich Rowney as Barry\n* Tony Hiles as the Zookeeper\n* [[Peter Jackson]] (''cameo'') as the Undertaker's assistant\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] took place over eleven weeks on location in and around [[Wellington]] on a reported budget of around $3 million.
