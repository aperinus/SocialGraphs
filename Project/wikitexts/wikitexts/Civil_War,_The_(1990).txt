It was the first broadcast to air on [[PBS]] for five consecutive nights, from September 23 to 27, 1990.\n\nMore than 39 million viewers tuned in to at least one episode, and viewership averaged more than 14 million viewers each evening, making it the most-watched program ever to air on PBS. It was awarded more than 40 major television and film honors. A companion book to the documentary was released shortly after the series aired.<ref>Ward, Geoffrey C.; Burns, Ric; Burns, Ken (1992) [First published 1991]. ''The Civil War: An Illustrated History''. New York: Knopf. {{ISBN|978-0679742777}}.</ref>\n\nIts filmography was groundbreaking for the time, and spawned film techniques such as the [[Ken Burns effect]]. Its theme song, \"[[Ashokan Farewell]]\" is widely acclaimed. The series was extremely influential, and serves as the main source of knowledge about the Civil War to many Americans. However, some historians have criticized its historical accuracy, especially its lack of coverage of slavery as a cause of the war.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe series was rebroadcast in June 1994<ref>{{cite news |title='The Civil War', 'Gettysburg' capture history |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/82341082/ |access-date=June 2, 2018 |work=Southern Illonoisan |date=June 25, 1994}}</ref> as a lead-up to ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'', then remastered for its 12th anniversary in 2002, although it remained in standard definition resolution. To commemorate the film's 25th anniversary and the 150th anniversary of [[Lincoln's assassination]], the film underwent a complete digital restoration to high-definition format in 2015.\n\n==Production==\n[[Mathew Brady]]'s photographs inspired Burns to make ''The Civil War'', which (in nine episodes totaling more than 10 hours) explores the war's military, social, and political facets through some 16,000 contemporary photographs and paintings, and excerpts from the letters and journals of persons famous and obscure.\n\nThe series' slow zooming and panning across still images was later termed the \"[[Ken Burns effect]]\".\nBurns combined these images with modern [[cinematography]], music, narration by [[David McCullough]], anecdotes and insights from authors such as [[Shelby Foote]],<ref name=\"TV Today\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=wZJMF1LD7PcC&dat=19900925&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title='Civil War' audience 'discovers' storyteller-writer Shelby Foote|publisher=The Milwaukee Sentinel|work=TV Today|date=September 25, 1990|access-date=2013-07-01}}</ref> historians [[Barbara J. Fields]], [[Ed Bearss]], and [[Stephen B. Oates]]; and actors reading contemporary quotes from historical figures such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Robert E. Lee]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Stonewall Jackson]], and [[Frederick Douglass]], as well as diaries by [[Mary Boykin Chesnut]], [[Samuel R. Watkins]], [[Elisha Hunt Rhodes]] and [[George Templeton Strong]] and commentary from [[James W. Symington]]. A large cast of actors voiced correspondence, memoirs, news articles, and stood in for historical figures from the Civil War.\n\nBurns also interviewed [[Daisy Turner (storyteller)|Daisy Turner]], then a 104-year-old daughter of an ex-slave, whose poetry features prominently in the series. Turner died in February 1988, a full two-and-a-half years before the series aired.\n\nProduction ran five years. The film was co-produced by Ken's brother [[Ric Burns]], written by [[Geoffrey C. Ward]] and Ric Burns with Ken Burns, and edited by [[Paul Barnes (film editor)|Paul Barnes]] with cinematography by Buddy Squires. It was funded by [[General Motors]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], the [[Arthur Vining Davis|Arthur Vining Davis Foundations]], and the [[MacArthur Foundation|John D. & Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]].\n\n===Music===\nThe theme song of the documentary is the instrumental \"[[Ashokan Farewell]]\", which is heard twenty-five times during the film. The song was composed by [[Jay Ungar]] in 1982 and he describes it as \"the song coming out of 'a sense of loss and longing' after the annual Ashokan Music & Dance Camps ended.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/civilwar/film/music.html|title=The Civil War .

Musicologist Alexander Klein wrote: \"Upon watching the full documentary, one is immediately struck by the lyricism of Schwab's playing and, more importantly, her exceptional arranging skills. What had been originally rousing and at times [[bellicose]] songs such as the southern \"[[The Bonnie Blue Flag|Bonnie Blue Flag]]\" or the northern \"[[Battle Cry of Freedom]]\" now suddenly sounded like heart-warming, lyrical melodies due to Schwab's interpretations. The pianist not only changed the songs' original mood but also allowed herself some harmonic liberties so as to make these century-old marching tunes into piano lamentations that contemporary audiences could fully identify with\".<ref name=klein>Alexander Klein, ''[http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/fsmonline/story.cfm?maID=4057&issueID=99&page=1 \"Scoring Ken Burns' Civil War: An Interview with Pianist Jacqueline Schwab\"]''Film Score Monthly,'' April 2013.</ref>\n\nA major piece of vocal music in the series is a version of the old spiritual \"[[We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder]]\", performed [[a cappella]] by the [[African-American]] singer, scholar and activist [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]] and several other female voices.

Griffith Award, and the US$50,000 [[Lincoln Prize]], among dozens of others.\n\nThe series sparked a major renewal of interest in the Civil War. It was widely acclaimed for its skillful depiction and retelling of the Civil War events, and also for drawing huge numbers of viewers into a new awareness of the historical importance of the conflict. Before the series, the Civil War had receded in popular historical consciousness since its 1960s centennial. Following the series, there was a sharp upturn in popular books and other works about the Civil War.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/06/thanks_a_lot_ken_burns.html Thanks a Lot, Ken Burns], by James M. Lundberg, Salon. com, June 7, 2011.</ref>\n\nRobert Brent Toplin in 1996 wrote ''Ken Burns's The Civil War: Historians Respond'', which included essays from critical academic historians who felt their topics of interest were not covered in enough detail and responses from Ken Burns and others involved in the series' production.\n\nThe series has been criticized for perceived historical inaccuracies, since it focuses mostly on the battles of the Civil War to the detriment of other areas. Some also believe it provides a weak or faulty explanation of the causes of the war. While academic historians concur that [[Causes of the American Civil War|the war was fought to preserve slavery]], Burns presented [[Shelby Foote]]'s framing of that dispute as a \"failure to compromise\".<ref>{{citation |last=Mackowski |first=Chris |title=Primary Sources: Slavery as the Cause of the Civil War |date=January 22, 2019 |url=https://emergingcivilwar.com/2019/01/22/primary-sources-slavery-as-the-cause-of-the-civil-war/ |journal=Emerging Civil War |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210120013621/https://emergingcivilwar.com/2019/01/22/primary-sources-slavery-as-the-cause-of-the-civil-war/ |archive-date=January 20, 2021 |accessdate=September 15, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Though Foote was a journalist and novelist rather than a trained historian, he was given more screen time than any other commentator. The fact that Burns himself was not a historian, nor were most of his production team, has similarly led to accusations that his series did not contain a thorough enough historical overview of its subject. That most of them were also white men has also been fingered for a lack of coverage of women, blacks, or Reconstruction. The series has also been criticized for propagating the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]] ideology. Because Burns' documentary has been so influential, and serves as the main source of knowledge about the Civil War for many Americans, some critics fear it has perpetuated this supposedly discredited view.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Debate over Ken Burns Civil War doc continues over decades {{!}} The Spokesman-Review|url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/nov/04/debate-over-ken-burns-civil-war-doc-continues-over/|website=www.spokesman.com|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title=Why We Need a New Civil War Documentary|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-we-need-new-civil-war-documentary-180971996/|last=Merritt|first=Keri Leigh|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>\n\n==Remastering==\n\n===12th Anniversary===\nThe entire series was digitally [[remaster]]ed for re-release on September 17, 2002 in [[VHS]] and [[DVD-Video|DVD]] by [[PBS Home Video]] and [[Warner Home Video]]. The DVD release included a short documentary on how a [[Spirit DataCine]] was used to transfer and remaster the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/civilwar/film/remaster.html|title= Why we decided to Re-master ''The Civil War''|website= [[PBS]]}}</ref> The remastering was limited to producing an improved fullscreen standard-definition digital video of the film's [[interpositive]] negatives, for broadcast and DVD. The soundtrack was also re-mastered and remixed in [[5.1]] Dolby Digital AC3 surround sound.\n\nPaul Barnes, Editor & Post-Production Supervisor, Florentine Films at that time commented:\n\n<blockquote>Ken Burns and I decided to remaster ''The Civil War'' for several reasons. First of all, when we completed the film in 1989, we were operating under a very tight schedule and budget. As the main editor on the film, I always wanted to go back and improve the overall quality of the film. The other reason for remastering the film at this time is that the technology to color correct, print and transfer a film to video for broadcast has vastly improved, especially in the realm of digital computer technology... We also were able to eliminate a great deal of the dust and dirt that often get embedded into 16mm film when it is printed.</blockquote>\n\n===25th Anniversary===\nFor the 150th anniversary of the end of the war, and the 25th anniversary of the series, PBS remastered the series in [[High-definition video|high definition]]. This work involved creating a new [[4K resolution|4K]] ultra-high-definition digital master of the film's [[original camera negative]]s and was carried out in association with the [[George Eastman House]], where the original 16mm negatives are preserved. It aired on PBS from September 7 to 11, 2015.<ref>{{cite
