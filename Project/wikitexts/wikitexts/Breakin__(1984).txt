After release, MGM and Cannon dissolved their distribution deal, reportedly over the potentially X-rated content in [[John Derek]]'s film ''[[Bolero (1984 film)|Bolero]]'' and MGM's then-policy of not theatrically releasing X-rated material, forcing Cannon to become an in-house distribution company once again. Because of this, ''Breakin<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' is considered to be the final financially profitable film released by Cannon.\n\n''Breakin<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' was released to theaters on May 4, 1984, and despite receiving negative reviews from critics, it was a box office success. A theatrical sequel entitled ''[[Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo]]'', was released later in the same year.\n\n==Plot==\nProtagonist Kelly \"Special K\" Bennett is a young dancer training under instructor Franco in Venice, California. Through her friend Adam, Kelly meets two street dancers, Ozone and Turbo on the boardwalk at [[Venice beach|Venice Beach]]. Kelly is enamored with their dancing, and all three become friends. This leads to their becoming their own dance troupe.\n\nFranco tells Kelly that breakdancing is low-class and not a real art. He is disrespectful to Ozone and Turbo, and makes inappropriate advances on Kelly. She quits training with Franco. Later, Kelly attends a dance audition and is shut down by harsh directors.\n\nKelly then wanders to a breakdancing event where she finds Ozone and Turbo in the midst of a dance battle that they eventually lose against rivals \"Electro Rock.\" Adam convinces Ozone and Turbo to teach Kelly how to breakdance. After training for a while, the three defeat Electro Rock. Kelly convinces the troupe to enroll in a dance competition. Kelly's agent friend, James, sees what the group can do and agrees to back them.\n\nThe competition requirements are traditional, socially respected styles of dance. The troupe walks before the judges in tuxedos, top hats and white gloves to give the impression of traditional dancers. Just before the audition starts, they rip off the sleeves of their shirts and show their true style. The judges are initially shocked and disapproving. Yet within two minutes of their audition, the judges recognize the troupe's talent and allow them to continue. The troupe earns a standing ovation from the judges and win the competition. The troupe's popularity skyrockets, and all three members continue dancing professionally and in the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/breakin-1984|title=Breakin' Movie Review & Film Summary (1984) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}</ref>\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Special K, Ozone, and Turbo meet James some time after the competition, who informs them about a new phenomenon known as \"the [[Electric boogaloo (dance)|electric boogaloo]].\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Lucinda Dickey]] as Kelly \"Special K\" Bennett\n* [[Shabba Doo|Adolfo \"Shabba Doo\" Qui\u00f1ones]] as Orlando \"Ozone\" Barco\n* [[Michael Chambers|Michael \"Boogaloo Shrimp\" Chambers]] as Tony \"Turbo\" Ainley\n* [[Ice-T|Ice T]] as Rap Talker\n* [[Chris Taylor (music producer)|Chris \"The Glove\" Taylor]] as Club Radiotron DJ\n* Ben Lokey as Franco\n* [[Christopher McDonald (actor)|Christopher McDonald]] as James Wilcox\n* Phineas Newborn III as Adam\n* Vidal \"Lil Coco\" Rodriguez as Hot Tot\n* Bruno \"Pop N' Taco\" Falcon as Electro Rock 1\n* [[Popin Pete|Timothy \"Popin' Pete\" Solomon]] as Electro Rock 2\n* Ana \"Lollipop\" Sanchez as Electro Rock 3\n* Cooley Jaxson as Himself, A Dancer\n* [[Peter Bromilow]] as Judge\n* [[Michel Qissi]] as Background Dancing Spectator (uncredited)\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Spectator in First Dance Sequence (uncredited) <ref>{{cite news|title= Jean-Claude van Damme|work= [[The A.V.
