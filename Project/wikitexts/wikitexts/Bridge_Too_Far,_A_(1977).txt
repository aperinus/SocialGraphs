At the time of its release, it was the most expensive film ever produced.\n\nThough it received a tepid critical response, ''A Bridge Too Far'' received several awards. At the [[31st British Academy Film Awards|31st BAFTA Awards]] it won four out of eight nominated categories, including [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actor]] for Edward Fox and [[BAFTA Award for Best Score|Best Score]] for [[John Addison]]\u2014who himself had served in the British [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] during Market Garden. Attenborough was nominated for [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]], and the film was nominated for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Operation Market Garden]] envisages 35,000 men being flown {{convert|300|mi}} from air bases in England and dropped behind enemy lines in the [[Netherlands in World War II|Netherlands]]. Two divisions of US paratroopers are responsible for securing the road and bridges as far as [[Nijmegen]]. A British division, under Major-General [[Roy Urquhart]], is to land near [[Arnhem]] and hold both sides of the bridge there, backed by a brigade of [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish]] paratroopers under General [[Stanis\u0142aw Sosabowski]]. [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Armoured Corps]] are to push up the road over the bridges captured by the American paratroopers and reach Arnhem two days after the drop.\n\nAs General Urquhart briefs his officers some of them are surprised they are going to attempt a landing so far from their objective since  the distance from their landing zone to the bridge will render their portable radios useless. Although the consensus is that resistance will consist entirely of inexperienced old men and [[Hitler Youth]], [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] photos show the presence of German tanks at Arnhem. General [[Frederick Browning|Browning]] nevertheless dismisses the photos and also ignores reports from the [[Dutch resistance|Dutch underground]], believing the operation will be successful regardless.\n\nThe Arnhem bridge is the prime target, since it serves as the last means of escape for the German forces in the Netherlands and a direct route to Germany for the Allies. However the road to it is only a single lane linking the various key bridges and vehicles have to squeeze onto the verge to pass. The road is also elevated, causing anything moving along it to stand out.\n\nThough the airborne drops catch the enemy by surprise and encounter little resistance, the [[Son, North Brabant|Son bridge]] is demolished by the Germans just before it can be secured. Furthermore, troubles beset Urquhart's division, since many of the [[Willys MB|jeeps]] either do not arrive or are destroyed in an ambush, in addition to their nonfunctional radio sets.\n\nMeanwhile, XXX Corps' progress is slowed by German resistance, the narrowness of the road and the need to construct a [[Bailey bridge]] to replace the one destroyed at Son. They are then halted at Nijmegen, where soldiers of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] perform a dangerous daylight river crossing to capture the [[Nijmegen railway bridge|Nijmegen bridge]] and XXX Corps is further delayed waiting for infantry to secure the town.\n\nThe Germans close in on the isolated British paratroopers occupying part of Arnhem at the bridge, and although Sosabowski's troops finally arrive after being delayed in England they are ultimately too late to reinforce the British. After days of intense fighting against [[SS]] infantry and [[panzer]]s the outgunned troops are eventually either captured or forced to withdraw to [[Oosterbeek]]. Urquhart receives orders to retreat, while the other Allied commanders blame the various difficulties encountered for their failure to provide the needed support.\n\nUrquhart escapes with less than a fifth of his original 10,000 troops while those who are too badly injured to flee stay behind to cover the withdrawal. On arrival at British headquarters Urquhart confronts Browning about his personal sentiments regarding the operation and the latter contradicts his earlier optimism regarding it.\n\nBack in Oosterbeek [[Kate ter Horst]], whose home has been converted into a makeshift hospital by the British, abandons its ruins. Passing through the front yard, now a graveyard for fallen troops, she and her children leave with an elderly doctor, pulling a few possessions in a cart, while wounded British troops sing \"[[Abide with Me]]\" as they await capture.\n\n==Cast and roles==\n''Note: Characters ordered by rank''\n\n===British===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Actor\n! style=\"width:280px;\"|Role\n! style=\"width:650px;\"|Notes\n|-\n| [[Dirk Bogarde]] || [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Frederick Browning|Frederick 'Boy' Browning]] || [[General officer commanding|GOC]] [[I Airborne Corps (United Kingdom)|I British Airborne Corps]], and at [[Headquarters|HQ]] [[First Allied Airborne Army]] as its [[Second-in-command|deputy commander]], [[British Army]] at Nijmegen\n|-\n| [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] || Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]] || GOC, XXX Corps,<ref>Carried the primary responsibility for the 'Garden' ground offensive part of the operation</ref> British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]].<ref>Fox had known General Horrocks as a friend before working on the film and took care to portray him accurately.

Parachute drops were conducted by the 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment, only 100 jumpers plus support, 10 man sticks per Dakota.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}</ref> Supplies were dropped from a number of [[Douglas Dakota|Dakota]] aircraft. The Dakotas were gathered by the film company Joseph E. Levine Presents Incorporated. All aircraft were required to be CAA ([[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]]) or FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) registered and licensed to carry passengers. An original deal for the purchase of 10 fell through when two airframes were rejected as passenger configured without the necessary jump doors. Eleven Dakotas were procured. Two ex-[[Portuguese Air Force]], 6153 and 6171 (N9984Q and N9983Q), and two from [[Air Djibouti]], operating from [[Djibouti]] in [[French Somaliland]], F-OCKU and F-OCKX (N9985Q and N9986Q) were purchased by [[Joseph E. Levine]]. Three [[Danish Air Force]] K-685, K-687, and K-688, and four [[Finnish Air Force]] [[C-47 Skytrain|C-47]]s, DO-4, DO-7, DO-10 and DO-12, were loaned for the duration of the parachute filming.\n\nAircraft 6171 doubled as the camera ship on most formations, with a camouflaged [[Piper Aztec]], G-AWDI. A camera was mounted in the astrodome, one on the port upper mainplane surface, with a third camera on the outside of the forward port cabin window and a fourth under the aircraft centre section. In addition, centre escape hatches were removed to make additional camera ports available, provided that no troops were aboard during filming. A second Aztec, G-ASND, was a backup camera ship on some shots, but it was not camouflaged. An [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette]], G-BDWN, was also employed. After a mishap with G-AWDI, two locally hired [[Cessna 172]]s, PH-GVP and PH-ADF, were also used. Ten [[Airspeed Horsa|Horsa]] glider replicas were built, but a windstorm damaged almost all of them. Seven or eight were hastily repaired for the shoot. The replica gliders were tail-heavy and required a support post under the rear fuselage, with camera angles carefully chosen to avoid revealing this. Dakota 6153 was fitted with tow gear and [[Airspeed Horsa|Horsa]] replicas were towed at high speed, though none went airborne. A two-seat [[LET L-13 Blan\u00edk|Blan\u00edk]] sailplane, provided by a member of the [[London Gliding Club]], [[Dunstable]], was towed aloft for the interior takeoff shots.\n\n[[File:Shooting of a scene from A bridge too far.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Shooting of a scene in Deventer on May 18, 1976.

Their original identities were PH-KLU, PH-BKT, B-64 and B-118, the former two aircraft loaned by the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]]. These were flown by members of the ''Gilze Rijen Aero Club'', which also provided an [[Auster]] III, PH-NGK, which depicted an Auster V, RT607, in wartime camouflage.

Although a replica of the original road bridge in Arnhem existed, by the mid-1970s modern urban development surrounded it, making it impossible to use as a setting for a 1940s city. A few scenes were shot in [[Zutphen]], where the old municipality house and the main church can be seen. Additional scenes were filmed at [[Twickenham Studios]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56111|access-date=2021-07-28|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Motion Picture Association|Motion Picture Association of America]] initially gave the film an [[R rating (Motion Picture Association)|R rating]] for its use of the [[Fuck|F-word]] and depictions of war violence, but United Artists lobbied it to change it to a PG rating so that younger audiences could see the film.
