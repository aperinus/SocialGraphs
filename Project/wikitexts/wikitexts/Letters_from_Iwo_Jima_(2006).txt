The film portrays the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] from the perspective of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Imperial Japanese Army|soldiers]] and is a companion piece to Eastwood's ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'', which depicts the same battle from the American viewpoint; the two films were shot back to back. ''Letters from Iwo Jima'' is almost entirely in Japanese, despite being co-produced by American companies [[DreamWorks Pictures]], [[Malpaso Productions]] and [[Amblin Entertainment]].\n\nThe film was released in Japan on December 9, 2006 and received a limited release in the United States on December 20, 2006 in order to be eligible for consideration for the [[79th Academy Awards]], for which it received four nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and winning [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]]. It was subsequently released in more areas of the U.S. on January 12, 2007, and was released in most states on January 19. An English-dubbed version of the film premiered on April 7, 2008. Upon release, the film received critical acclaim and although it only grossed slightly better at the box office than its companion, it was much more successful compared to its budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2005, Japanese [[archaeologist]]s explore tunnels on [[Iwo Jima]], where they find something in the dirt.\n\nThe scene changes to [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] in 1944. [[Private (rank)|Private First Class]] Saigo, a [[Conscription|conscripted]] baker who misses his wife and daughter, is digging beach trenches with his platoon when [[Lieutenant General]] [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] arrives to take command of the garrison. He saves Saigo from a beating by Captain Tanida for being \"unpatriotic\", and orders the garrison to tunnel underground defenses throughout the island.\n\nKuribayashi and [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Kazoku|Baron]] [[Takeichi Nishi]], a famous [[Olympic medalist|Olympic gold medalist]] [[show jumping|show jumper]], clash with some of the other officers, who do not agree with Kuribayashi's [[defense in depth]] strategy. Kuribayashi learns that Japan can not send reinforcements, therefore he believes that the tunnels and mountain defenses stand a better chance for holding out. Poor nutrition and unsanitary conditions take their toll, and many die of [[dysentery]]. [[Army ranks of the Japanese Empire during World War II|Superior Private]] Shimizu arrives as a replacement, who Saigo suspects is a spy from the [[Kempeitai]] sent to report on disloyal soldiers.\n\nSoon, American aircraft and warships bombard the island. A few days later, the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] land and suffer heavy casualties, but they overcome the beach defenses and attack [[Mount Suribachi]]. While delivering a request from Captain Tanida for more machine guns, Saigo overhears Kuribayashi radioing orders to retreat. However, Tanida ignores the order and instead has his unit commit [[mass suicide]]. Saigo flees with Shimizu, convincing him to stay alive and fight on.\n\nThe Mount Suribachi survivors make a run for friendly lines, but Marines ambush and wipe them out, except Saigo and Shimizu. The two reach safety, but are accused by Lieutenant Ito of cowardice. They are about to be executed when Kuribayashi arrives and confirms his order to retreat. Against Kuribayashi's orders, Ito leads an attack on US positions and many soldiers are killed. Colonel Nishi reprimands Ito for his insubordination; in response, Ito leaves carrying several [[land mine]]s and intends to throw himself under a US tank. Shimizu reveals to Saigo that he was dishonorably discharged from the Kempeitai because he disobeyed an order to kill a family's dog. Nishi is eventually blinded by shrapnel, and orders his men to withdraw before committing suicide.\n\nSaigo and Shimizu attempt to surrender, but they are spotted by their superior and only Shimizu escapes, who is then found by a Marine patrol. Shimizu and another Japanese prisoner are then shot dead by their guard. Saigo and the remaining soldiers flee to Kuribayashi's position. Saigo befriends Kuribayashi, and a counter-attack is planned due to depleted supplies. Kuribayashi orders Saigo to stay behind and destroy any vital documents, saving Saigo for a third time.\n\nThat night, Kuribayashi leads a final [[banzai charge]]. Most of his men are killed, and Kuribayashi is critically wounded, but his loyal aide Fujita drags him away. Meanwhile, Ito has long abandoned his suicidal mission and is captured by Marines. The next morning, Kuribayashi orders Fujita to behead him with his [[Gunt\u014d]], but Fujita is shot dead by a Marine sniper. Saigo arrives, having buried a bag of letters before leaving headquarters. Kuribayashi asks Saigo to bury him where he will not be found, then draws his pistol\u2014an [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] gifted to him in the US before the war\u2014and commits suicide. Saigo dutifully buries him.\n\nLater, a Marine platoon finds Fujita's body. Saigo reappears and attacks them, infuriated to see a lieutenant has taken Kuribayashi's pistol. Saigo is subdued and taken to the beach to recover alongside wounded Marines. Awakening on a stretcher, he glimpses the setting sun and smiles.\n\nReturning to 2005, the archeologists complete their digging and reveal the bag of letters that Saigo had buried. As the letters spill out from the opened bag, the voices of the Japanese soldiers who wrote them are heard.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Actor !!

The Japanese critics noted that Clint Eastwood presented Kuribayashi as a \"caring, erudite commander of Japan's Iwo Jima garrison, along with Japanese soldiers in general, in a sensitive, respectful way.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fccj.or.jp/files/February_issue.pdf#search=%27iwo%20jima%20haruko%20watanabe%27|title=Letters from Iwo Jima|format=PDF}}{{Dead link|date=March 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Also, the Japanese newspaper ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' noted that the movie is clearly \"distinguishable\" from previous Hollywood movies, which tended to portray Japanese characters with non-Japanese actors (e.g., Chinese-Americans, and other Asian-Americans). Consequently, incorrect [[Japanese grammar]] and non-native accents were conspicuous in those former films, jarring their realism for the Japanese audience. In contrast, most Japanese roles in ''Letters from Iwo Jima'' are played by native Japanese actors. Also, the article praised the film's new approach, as it is scripted with excellent research into Japanese society at that time. According to the article, previous Hollywood movies describing Japan were based on the stereotypical images of Japanese society, which looked \"weird\" to native Japanese audiences. ''Letters from Iwo Jima'' is remarkable as the movie that tries to escape from the stereotypes.<ref>Asahi Shimbun, December 13, 2006: \u305d\u308c\u307e\u3067\u306e\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u6620\u753b\u3067\u306f\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u3092\u63cf\u3044\u305f\u4f5c\u54c1\u3084\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3067\u3042\u308a\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3082\u3001\u809d\u5fc3\u306e\u4ff3\u512a\u306b\u306f\u4e2d\u56fd\u7cfb\u3084\u6771\u5357\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u7cfb\u3001\u65e5\u7cfb\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u7b49\u304c\u8d77\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f\u308a\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306b\u5999\u306a\u8a1b\u308a\u3084\u6587\u6cd5\u306e\u9593\u9055\u3044\u304c\u76ee\u7acb\u3061\u3001\u9006\u306b\u82f1\u8a9e\u3092\u6d41\u66a2\u306b\u8a71\u3059\u3068\u3044\u3063\u305f\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u3055\u304c\u76ee\u7acb\u3064\u3053\u3068\u304c\u591a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u304c\u3001\u672c\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u306f\u30b9\u30c6\u30ec\u30aa\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306a\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u63cf\u5199\uff08\u6587\u5316\u3084\u5b97\u6559\u89b3\u7b49\uff09\u3084\u9055\u548c\u611f\u306e\u3042\u308b\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3001\u300c\u662d\u548c\u53f2\u300d\u3067\u77e5\u3089\u308c\u308b\u534a\u85e4\u4e00\u5229\u3082\u3001\u7d30\u90e8\u306b\u9593\u9055\u3044\u306f\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3088\u304f\u8abf\u3079\u3066\u3044\u308b.</ref> Owing to the lack of stereotypes, ''Letters from Iwo Jima'' was appreciated by Japanese critics and audiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinejun.com/ |title=\u30ad\u30cd\u30de\u65ec\u5831\u793e |publisher=Kinejun.com |date=2012-09-21 |access-date=2012-10-04}}</ref>\n \nSince the film was successful in Japan, a tourist boom has been reported on the [[Bonin Islands|Ogasawara islands]], of which [[Iwo Jima]] is part.<ref name=\"joriku\">[http://www.ogpress.com/2p/topix/A-06.12.19ioutou.html \u6620\u753b\u300c\u786b\u9ec4\u5cf62\u90e8\u4f5c\u300d\u3067\u2026\u786b\u9ec4\u5cf6\u30d6\u30fc\u30e0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219042326/http://www.ogpress.com/2p/topix/A-06.12.19ioutou.html |date=December 19, 2007 }} \u5c0f\u7b20\u539f\u65b0\u805e\u793e 2006\u5e7412\u670819\u65e5</ref>\n\nNicholas Barber's review in the UK's ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', argued that the movie was \"a traditional film wearing the uniform of a revisionist one\" which proved Hollywood could be \"as mawkish about other country's {{sic}} soldiers as it can about its own\", and that the Japanese characters were \"capable of being decent, caring fellows, just so long as they've spent some time in the United States\".<ref>Barber, Nicholas. \"Review: 'Letters from Iwo Jima.\" The Independent, 25 Feb. 2007.
