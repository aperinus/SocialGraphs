During the aforementioned incident, his partner was killed and he found himself served up on a [[platter (dishware)|platter]] of [[watermelon]] with a gun shoved in his face just before back-up arrived. Charlie, once known for his ease and almost \"magical\" talent on the job, is finding it very hard to return to work. His requests to be taken off the case or [[retired]] are denied by his bosses, Lonny Burke ([[Louis Giambalvo]]) and Dexter Helvenshaw ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) as so much time was put into his cover. Charlie works with the dream of one day retiring to Ocean Views, a luxury housing complex with servants and utilities.\n:\nDuring his flight to [[New York City]], where his job will resume, another passenger strikes up a conversation with him. It turns out that this man, Dr. Jeff Bleckner (Michael Mantell), is a [[psychiatrist]] and upon arriving to New York, Charlie enlists his services. Dr. Bleckner listens to his troubles and prescribes him [[anti-anxiety]] medication to help him deal with [[Psychological stress|stress]]. He also encourages him to join a [[group therapy]] session. At therapy, Charlie meets and befriends a group of stressed out men from the business world.\n:\nTo deal with his gastrointestinal issues, Charlie goes to the doctor where he meets the free-spirited and beautiful Judy Tipp ([[Sandra Bullock]]), the self-proclaimed \"[[Enema]] Queen\" who introduces him to [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]] to his problems as well as some [[romantic interest]].\n:\nBack on the job, Charlie is knee-deep in [[negotiations]] for high-stakes [[money laundering]] and [[stock manipulation]]. He was brought into the group by the passionate Fidel Vaillar ([[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]]) and his close bodyguard, Estuvio Clavo ([[Michael DeLorenzo]]). Vaillar is a son of an important [[Colombians|Colombian]] [[druglord]] and fears being viewed as a [[stereotype]]. They are dealing with an intense man with an unpredictable temper named Fulvio Nesstra ([[Oliver Platt]]) who represents the [[Italian mob]] in New York. Fulvio is the disfavored son-in-law of high-ranking Italian mobster, Carmine Minetti ([[Frank Vincent]]). Jason Cane ([[Andrew Lauer]]), a young [[Wall street]]-type with a plan, but poor taste, completes the group. Each thinks he understands the other players, but there is more to these characters than meets the eye.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as DEA Agent Charlie Mayough\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Fulvio Nesstra\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Judy Tipp\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] as Fidel Vaillar\n* [[Michael DeLorenzo]] as Estuvio Clavo\n* [[Andrew Lauer]] as Jerry M.
