The film was directed by [[Tom Shadyac]], who wrote the screenplay with Jack Bernstein and Jim Carrey. The film co-stars [[Courteney Cox]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Sean Young]], and then-Miami Dolphins [[quarterback]] [[Dan Marino]] and features a cameo appearance from [[death metal]] band [[Cannibal Corpse]].\n\n[[Morgan Creek Productions]] produced the film on a budget of {{nowrap|$15 million}}, and [[Warner Bros.]] released the film in February 1994. It grossed $72.2 million in the United States and Canada and $35 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $107.2 million. It received mixed reviews from critics. Carrey's performance led to the film having a [[cult following]] among male [[Adolescence|adolescents]]. In addition to launching Carrey's film career, it also started [[Ace Ventura (franchise)|a franchise]], spawning the sequel film ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]'' (1995), the animated television series ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (TV series)|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' (three seasons, 1995\u20132000), and later, standalone [[television film|made-for-television]] sequel ''[[Ace Ventura Jr.: Pet Detective]]'' (2009).\n==Plot==\n[[Ace Ventura]] is an unorthodox [[Miami]]-based private detective who specializes in retrieving tame or captive animals. He struggles to pay his rent and is often mocked by the [[Miami Police Department]], led by Lieutenant Lois Einhorn, who finds Ventura insufferable. Two weeks before the [[Super Bowl]], the [[Miami Dolphins]]' [[Mascot#Sports mascots|mascot]], a [[bottlenose dolphin]] named Snowflake, is kidnapped at [[Joe Robbie Stadium]]. Melissa Robinson, the team's chief publicist, hires Ventura to find Snowflake.\n\nSearching Snowflake's tank for clues, Ventura finds a rare triangle-cut orange amber stone, which he recognizes as a part of a [[1984\u201385 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Miami Dolphins 45.2C Pittsburgh Steelers 28|1984 AFC Championship]] ring. Ace suspects billionaire Ronald Camp may have stolen Snowflake, as he is known for collecting exotic animals through less-than-reputable means and sources. Ventura and Melissa sneak into Camp's party, where Ventura mistakes a shark for Snowflake and is nearly eaten. Camp apologizes and shakes Ventura's hand, revealing on one of his own fingers a ring with an amber stone set identical to the one Ventura found. Ruling out Camp, as his ring was not missing the amber stone, Ventura concludes that a member of the 1984 Miami Dolphins line-up may have kidnapped Snowflake, and attempts to identify the culprit by their rings. However, he discovers all of the team members' rings are intact.\n\nRoger Podacter, the team's head of operations, mysteriously dies after falling from his apartment balcony. Einhorn declares it a suicide, but Ventura proves that it was murder due to the balcony glass doors being soundproof and a neighbor claiming to have heard screaming. He comes across an old photograph of the football team, discovering an unfamiliar player named Ray Finkle who was added as a placekicker in mid-season. Finkle missed a relatively easy field-goal kick at the end of [[Super Bowl XVII]], which cost the Dolphins the championship and ruined his career. Visiting Finkle's parents, Ventura learns that Finkle blamed quarterback [[Dan Marino]] for allegedly mishandling the ball before the kick, and became so fixated on this that he was committed to a mental hospital for homicidal tendencies. Marino himself is kidnapped shortly thereafter. Ventura visits Einhorn, pitching his theory that Finkle kidnapped both Marino and Snowflake in an act of revenge, as he was offended that the dolphin has been given Finkle's old team number and a field-goal trick to boot. He also theorizes that Finkle murdered Podacter when the latter discovered him snooping around his apartment. Einhorn compliments Ventura and kisses him before attempting to dissuade him from continuing the case since there is now a suspect, but Ventura refuses since he is still under contract by the Dolphins to locate Snowflake.\n\nVentura and Melissa go to the mental hospital, where Ventura poses as a potential patient.  Ventura uncovers a newspaper article in Finkle's possessions about a missing hiker named Lois Einhorn. Piecing together the evidence, Ventura, to his shock and disgust, realizes that Einhorn is Finkle: Finkle took on the identity of the missing Einhorn, and took advantage of her position in the Miami Police Department to get revenge on Marino and the Dolphins. On [[Super Bowl Sunday]], Ventura follows Einhorn to an abandoned yacht storage facility where she has Marino and Snowflake held hostage. Einhorn calls the police, blaming Ventura with no proof. Melissa and Ventura's friend, police officer Emilio, suspecting the deception, stage a hostage situation to get the police to listen to Ventura. To prove Einhorn is Finkle, Ace strips her of her clothes and, with help from Marino, reveals that Einhorn never got the [[penectomy]] and [[vaginoplasty]] necessary to perfect the disguise; Podacter discovered this during a date with Einhorn and was pushed off the balcony to stop him from revealing this to the public.\n\nEinhorn/Finkle is arrested by the police after attacking Ventura, and her ring is confirmed to have the stone missing. Marino and Snowflake are welcomed back during half-time at the Super Bowl; Ventura is then shown on the stadium's [[jumbotron]] and acknowledged as their savior, even as he gets into a scuffle with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' mascot [[Swoop (Philadelphia Eagles)|Swoop]] over a rare pigeon, receiving a large ovation from the crowd.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[Ace Ventura]]\n* [[Courteney Cox]] as Melissa Robinson\n* [[Sean Young]] as Lt.

Robinson, sought in the early 1990s to produce a comedy that would have wide appeal.

Carrey said of his approach, \"I knew this movie was going to either be something that people really went for, or it was going to ruin me completely. From the beginning of my involvement, I said that the character had to be rock 'n' roll. He had to be the 007 of pet detectives. I wanted to be unstoppably ridiculous, and they let me go wild.\" He said he sought comedic moments that would be unappealing to some, \"I wanted to keep the action unreal and over the top.
