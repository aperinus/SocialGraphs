It is the sequel to ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'', and the second installment of the [[Shanghai (film series)|''Shanghai'' film series]]. Directed by [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] and written by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]], it stars [[Jackie Chan]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Fann Wong]], [[Donnie Yen]] and [[Aidan Gillen]].\n\nIt was released on February 7, 2003. The film received mixed reviews but it performed well at the box office.<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1887, Lord Nelson Rathbone leads a band of [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxers]] into the [[Forbidden City]], killing the Keeper of the [[Imperial Seal of China]] and stealing the seal. With his dying breath, the Keeper gives his daughter, Chon Lin, a [[puzzle box]] for her brother, [[Sheriff]] Chon Wang.\n\nIn [[Carson City]], [[Nevada]], Wang has captured an impressive array of fugitives. Wang receives the box and a letter from Lin telling him of their father's death and that she has tracked the murderer to [[London]].\n\nWang travels to [[New York City]] to find his old partner Roy O'Bannon and collect his share of their gold so that he can buy passage to [[London]]. Roy has left [[law enforcement]], broken off his marriage, invested all their gold in the [[Zeppelin]], and is now a [[waiter]] and part-time [[gigolo]]. After an aborted attempt at [[prostitution]] to pay for tickets, the pair ship themselves to London in a crate.\n\nIn London, Roy's pocket is picked by a youth named Charlie. After a struggle between Roy, Wang, Charlie, and a gang angered by Charlie stealing on their turf, they are arrested. In [[Scotland Yard]], Inspector [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Artie Doyle]] thanks the two for defeating the [[Fleet Street]] gang. When they ask about Lin, Artie shows them she is in custody, having attempted to kill Lord Rathbone. Roy is instantly smitten with Lin and gives her a deck of playing cards as a good luck charm. Wang and Roy encounter Charlie. Breaking into an estate for shelter, they find an invitation to a gala at [[Buckingham Palace]].\n\nRoy and Wang infiltrate the gala in [[disguise]]: Roy as [[Major General]] \"[[Sherlock Holmes]]\" (a name he derives from the face of a clock) and Wang as the \"[[Maharaja]] of Nevada\". Wang and Roy follow Rathbone to a private library, where he slips through a secret passage. Wang finds the seal box, but the seal itself is gone and they are attacked by guards. Lin, having used Roy's playing cards to pick the lock on her cell, arrives and saves Roy. The three see Rathbone give the Imperial Seal to Wu Chow, the [[illegitimate]] brother of the [[Emperor of China]]. After a brief struggle, Charlie steals the seal. Rathbone and Wu Chow escape after the former sets the barn that they were in on fire. Lin manages to escape, with Roy and Wang stealing Rathbone's car, later crashing it into [[Stonehenge]]. Rathbone fires Artie after suggesting that his \"incompetence knows no bounds\". Wang and Roy are picked up by Lin the next morning who takes them to [[Whitechapel]].\n\nAt a [[brothel]], Roy overhears Wang try to convince Lin that Roy is an unsuitable husband, even telling her of his gigolo history and suspected [[infertility]]. Wang soothes Roy's feelings of betrayal by treating him to a pillow fight with the brothel staff. Wang, Roy, and Lin are found and captured by Rathbone, who reveals his plan: In exchange for the seal, Wu Chow will kill the British royal family and frame Lin. As tenth in line for the throne, Rathbone will then become king. Awaiting death, Roy confesses he spent most of the fortune publishing novels such as ''Roy O'Bannon Vs. The Mummy'', in which he portrayed himself as a hero and Wang as a cowardly sidekick. The two are reconciled and Wang says he will not stand between him and Lin. He frees himself and saves Roy.\n\nWong and Roy consult Artie about Charlie's location. Artie deduces from a hat he dropped that Charlie is at [[Madame Tussauds]]. They save him from the Boxers but lose the seal after the three are forced to hand it over to the Boxers, in exchange for Charlie's life. The three are then captured by police. Charlie rescues them and reveals his full name is [[Charlie Chaplin]]. They save the royal family from being assassinated by Wu Chow, whom Lin kills with a rocket. The three pursue Rathbone to the top of [[Big Ben]]. Roy is thrown off but hangs onto the clock face, while Wang is hopelessly outmatched at swordplay by Rathbone, who repeatedly spares his life so as to prolong their duel. Wang gives up on trying to outright defeat Rathbone, instead severing the support ropes for their platform. Roy catches Wang as Rathbone falls to his death. Both soon jump after grabbing a portion of the Union Jack landing safely on the Queen's coach.\n\nRoy, Wang, and Artie are [[British honors system|knighted]]. Artie decides to write stories, and asks Roy for use of the \"Sherlock Holmes\" name. Wang opens the box his father sent him to find a message reminding him of the importance of family. Roy proposes that he and Wang go to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to join the new [[motion picture]] industry. Charlie stows away as they drive off.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Chon Wang\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Roy O'Bannon\n* [[Fann Wong]] as Chon Lin\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]] as [[Charlie Chaplin]]\n* [[Tom Fisher (actor)|Tom Fisher]] as [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Arthur \"Artie\" Doyle]]\n* [[Donnie Yen]] as Wu Chow\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Lord Nelson Rathbone\n* [[Oliver Cotton]] as [[Jack the Ripper]]\n* [[Kim Chan]] as Chon Wang and Chon Lin's Father\n* [[Gemma Jones]] as [[Queen Victoria]]\n* [[Tom Wu]] as \"Lead Boxer\" Liu\n* Kelly-Marie Kerr as Clara\n* [[Constantine Gregory]] as the Mayor of New York City\n* [[Ray Donn]] as Chinese villager <small>(''uncredited'')</small>\n* [[Barbara Nedelj\u00e1kov\u00e1]] as Debutante\n* [[Anna-Louise Plowman]] as Debutante\n* [[Georgina Chapman]] as Debutante\n* [[Daisy Beaumont]] as Cigarette girl\n* [[Alison King]] as Prostitute\n* [[Matt Hill]] as Deputy\n* [[Barry Stanton (actor)|Barry Stanton]] as Lord Chancellor\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Jackie Chan Stunt Team===\n* [[Brad Allan]] as Street thug / Library thug <small>(''uncredited'')</small>\n* Paul Andreovski as Library thug with sword (double) / English policeman <small>(''uncredited'')</small>\n* Nicky Li\n* He Jun\n* Wu Gang\n* Park Hyun Jin\n* Lee In Seob\n* Han Guan Hua\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\nDirector [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] was personally chosen by Jackie Chan.
