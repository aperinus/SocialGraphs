It was directed by [[Tom Brady (film director)|Tom Brady]] and produced by [[Rob Schneider]] and Carr D'Angelo for [[Happy Madison]] and [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] (though [[Touchstone Pictures]]), and written by Brady and [[Rob Schneider]]. The film stars Schneider, [[Anna Faris]], [[Matthew Lawrence]], [[Eric Christian Olsen]], and introducing [[Rachel McAdams]] in her film debut. The film details a mean-spirited teenager who comes across magic earrings that causes her to switch bodies with an incompetent thief. Together with her cheerleader friends, she searches for her body while dealing with awkward social situations.\n\n[[Adam Sandler]] served as executive producer and has a small role in the film as the Mambuza Bongo Player, a character based on one played by Schneider in a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch. Sisters [[Tia Mowry|Tia]] and [[Tamera Mowry]] and singers [[Ashlee Simpson]], [[Angie Stone]], and [[Michelle Branch]] also had small roles. Parts of the film were shot at [[Redondo Union High School]] and [[El Segundo High School]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 50 BC, in an [[Ethiopia|Abyssinian]] castle, the princess Nawa uses a pair of enchanted earrings to escape an [[arranged marriage]] by [[Body swap|swapping bodies]] with a slave girl. When each woman wears one of the earrings, their bodies are magically swapped while their minds remain in place.\n\nIn her modern-day suburban home, Jessica Spencer is a beautiful but selfish \"hot chick\". Jessica's closest friends are April, Keecia, and Lulu. April is Jessica's best friend, and all four girls are cheerleaders. At school one day, Jessica makes fun of an overweight girl named Hildenburg and a [[Wicca]]n girl named Eden. After that, Jessica and her friends visit the local mall, where Jessica gets her rival Bianca into trouble and finds the earrings in an [[Africa]]n-themed store. The earrings are not for sale, so Jessica steals them.\n\nShortly afterward, a small-time criminal named Clive Maxtone robs a nearby gas station. When Jessica and her friends stop there and mistake him for an employee, he services their car to avoid raising suspicion. Jessica accidentally drops one of the earrings on the ground, the girls drive away, and Clive picks up the earring. That evening, in their respective homes, Jessica and Clive put on their earrings. When they wake up the next morning, each of them is trapped in the other's body. This is especially difficult for Jessica, who has a cheering competition and the school [[prom]] coming up soon.\n\nAfter Jessica convinces her friends of who she is, they help her investigate the body swap. Hildenburg, Eden, and Bianca are all innocent, Hildenburg and Eden join Jessica after she apologizes to them, and Eden finds a picture of the earrings on the [[internet]]. When the girls return to the African store, the owner explains how the earrings work and tells the girls they must find the other earring soon or the change will become permanent.\n\nMeanwhile, Jessica is hired for two jobs while secretly living with April. At her own home, where she works as a gardener, her parents tell her about their marital problems and she helps them rekindle their sex life. At school, while cleaning the boys' locker room as a custodian, she spies on her boyfriend Billy, who truly loves her, and April's boyfriend Jake, who has been cheating on her. Faced with Jake's infidelity, April begins to fall in love with Jessica, who agrees to take her to the prom. At the cheering competition, Jessica signals romantically to Billy while disguised as the school mascot, but when the head of her suit falls off, he becomes confused and leaves with Bianca. Jessica goes to the prom with April and they kiss. Jake sees this and is so upset, he spills his drink on his date. April confesses to being in love with Jessica. Jessica tells April she is perfect and doesn't need anybody. Jessica tries to win Billy back. Jessica tells Billy it's her in Clive's body, but Billy is so shocked and confused that he runs off. \n\nDuring this time, Clive has been using Jessica's body to make money from men, including Billy, who gives him his money and car, believing he is Jessica. Clive then tries to run him over. On the evening of the prom, Hildenburg sees a video of Clive in Jessica's body robbing a man on the [[television|TV]] news, goes to the scene of the crime, and finds a business card for the club where Clive works as a [[pole dance]]r. She informs Jessica at the prom, and the girls go to the club. When they find Clive, Jessica steals his earring and puts it on herself along with the other one. With the two earrings now on the same person, Jessica's and Clive's bodies return to their original owners.\n\nAfter Jessica makes up with Billy, the film ends with the school's graduation ceremony, followed by a scene in which Clive, running from the law and still dressed in [[lingerie]], is picked up by a bartender who believes he is a [[homosexual]]--and plans to have sex with him. Clive screams in horror.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Clive Maxtone / Man Jessica Spencer, an incompetent middle-aged criminal who accidentally switches bodies with Jessica Spencer.\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Jessica Spencer / Girl Clive Maxtone, a popular, beautiful, and mean-spirited cheerleader who accidentally switches bodies with Clive Maxtone.\n* [[Anna Faris]] as April, Jessica's best friend.\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Billy, the love interest of Jessica.\n* [[Alexandra Holden]] as Lulu, the red-haired friend of Jessica.\n* [[Sam Doumit]] as Eden, a goth girl who Jessica bullies and later befriends.\n* Megan Kuhlmann as Hildenburg, an overweight smart girl who Jessica bullies and later befriends.\n* [[Michael O'Keefe]] as Mr. Richard Spencer, the father of Jessica.\n* [[Melora Hardin]] as Mrs. Carol Spencer, the mother of Jessica.\n* [[Eric Christian Olsen]] as Jake, Billy's jock friend, who only thinks about sex.\n* Maritza Murray as Keecia \"Ling-Ling\" Jackson, Jessica's African-Korean friend.\n* [[Tamera Mowry]] as Sissie, Venetia's twin and Keecia's friend.\n* [[Tia Mowry]] as Venetia, Sissie's twin and Keecia's friend.\n* [[Maria-Elena Laas]] as Bianca, a cheerleader who is Jessica's enemy.\n* Matt Weinberg as Booger Spencer, the younger brother of Jessica.\n* [[Jodi Long]] as Mrs. Jackson, Keecia's Korean mother.\n* [[Angie Stone]] as Madame Mambuza, a woman who runs an African store at the mall where the magic earrings are held.\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Vice Principal Marjorie Bernard, the vice-principal of the high school that Jessica and her friends attend.\n\n'''Cameos'''\n* [[Robert Davi]] as Stan, April's father.\n* [[Leila Kenzle]] as April's mother\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Mambuza Bongo Guy\n* [[Ashlee Simpson]] as Monique, Bianca's friend.\n* [[Michelle Branch]] as the Club DJ at Instant Tango\n* [[Dick Gregory]] as the bathroom attendant at Instant Tango\n* Scott Dolezal as the bartender at Instant Tango who thinks Jessica in Clive's body is gay\n* [[Ozman Sirgood]] as The King\n* Shazia Ali as Princess Nawa, an Abyssian princess who switches bodies with a slave girl to get out of an arranged marriage\n* Vivian Corado as a slave girl who switches bodies with Princess Nawa\n* [[Louis Lombardi]] as Pole Cat Bar Patron\n* Bob Rubin as Pole Cat Club Bouncer\n* Wiley Roberts as Mr. Jackson, the father of Keecia who is half-Jewish\n}}\n\n[[Wes Takahashi]], former animator and visual effects supervisor for [[Industrial Light & Magic]], makes a cameo appearance as a news reporter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agni-animation.com/fullerton/halloffame/Wes_Ford_Takahashi.html|title=Subject: Wes Ford Takahashi|publisher=Animators' Hall of Fame|access-date=26 June 2016|archive-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812020742/http://www.agni-animation.com/fullerton/halloffame/Wes_Ford_Takahashi.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Schneider's mother Pilar appears as a judge of the cheerleading contest.\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place at [[University High School (Los Angeles)|University High School]] in West Los Angeles.<ref name=\"schools\">{{cite news |date=December 16, 2003 |last=Hayasaki |first=Erika |title=Schools Ready for Close-ups;
