While baking a cake one night, she is continually bothered by a large [[moth]] that keeps flying around her kitchen. No matter what she does, she cannot get rid of the intruder; she is especially annoyed when it runs into a photograph, taken many years ago, of herself and her late husband on their wedding day. Eventually, she knocks it into the cake batter, which she quickly and angrily pours into a pan and shoves into the oven. She then sets the kitchen timer and falls asleep, only to be awakened by loud rumblings and a blue-white light coming from the oven, whose door soon falls open. Crawling inside, she finds herself face-to-face with the moth and begins to float through an otherworldly space toward the source of the light, with a pair of giant moth wings sprouting from her back to propel her as the insect leads her along. She is soon revealed to be among dozens of moths being drawn to the light. The film ends with a close-up of the wedding photo, which comes to life as the younger Bunny nestles her head contentedly on her husband's shoulder; the shadows and reflections of two of the moths play across the image as well.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/1999Bunny 1999 Bunny: Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming: Internet Archive]</ref>\n\nDuring his introduction to the film on the ''Ice Age'' DVD, Wedge offers his take of these events: Bunny dies in her sleep, and the oven serves as a gateway to the afterlife. Her spirit is instinctively drawn into it, as a moth going toward a bright light, and is finally reunited with her husband.<ref>[https://animatedviews.com/2002/ice-age-2-disc-special-edition/ Ice Age:  Disc Special Edition - Animated Views]</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n*1999: [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] (won) <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTQODmIlTAw Short Film Winners: 1999 Oscars]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://web.archive.org/web/20210209220748/http://blueskystudios.com/films/bunny/}}\n* {{bcdb title|id=29252|title=Bunny}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0179011|title=Bunny}}\n* {{tcmdb title|521922|Bunny}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Awards for ''Bunny''\n| list1 =\n{{AcademyAwardBestAnimatedShortFilm 1981\u20132000}}\n{{Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject}}\n}}\n{{Chris Wedge}}\n{{Blue Sky Studios}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 computer-animated films]]\n[[Category:1998 short films]]\n[[Category:1990s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s animated short films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about rabbits and hares]]\n[[Category:Animated films about insects]]\n[[Category:Animated films without speech]]\n[[Category:Best Animated Short Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Best Animated Short Subject Annie Award winners]]\n[[Category:Blue Sky Studios short films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox short films]]\n[[Category:Computer-animated short films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Chris Wedge]]\n[[Category:Films about the afterlife]]\n[[Category:Films about death]]"}]}}}}
