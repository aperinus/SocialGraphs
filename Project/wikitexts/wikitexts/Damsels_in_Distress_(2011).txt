In August 1998, he had moved from New York to Paris with his wife and two daughters. In that time, he wrote a novelization of ''The Last Days of Disco'', in addition to several original film scripts which were not made, including one set in Jamaica in the 1960s. He resolved to make a lower-budgeted film in the style of his debut, ''[[Metropolitan (1990 film)|Metropolitan]]'' (1990). In 2006, he met with Liz Glotzer and Mart Shafer at [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], who had financed his second and third films. According to Shafer:\n<blockquote>Whit said, 'I want to write a movie about four girls in a dorm who are trying to keep things civil in an uncivil world.' It took him a year to write 23 pages. Six months later, a few more dribbled in. He just doesn't work very fast. Finally we had a draft. When we started production he said, 'I think 12 years is the right amount of time between movies.'<ref name=\"new\">{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Chip |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/magazine/whit-stillman-and-the-wasps.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=Whit Stillman and the Song of the Preppy |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=March 16, 2012 |access-date=March 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402214505/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/magazine/whit-stillman-and-the-wasps.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |archive-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\nCastle Rock provided most of the $3 million budget.<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe movie was filmed on location in New York City on [[Staten Island]] at the [[Sailors' Snug Harbor]] Cultural Center. Filming finished on November 5, 2010.<ref name=\"new\"/>\n\nStillman has said that the film was cut between its festival and theatrical runs:\n<blockquote>I felt the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] helped us out there. I'd hoped to get a PG-13 even with the Venice cut, but in the first viewing they thought it was R. So we looked at it, the editor [Andrew Hafitz] and I, and we saw immediately some things that would make it pretty clearly PG-13, and we felt would help the movie. There could've been a little heaviness of talking a little too much about what was going on, and it would delay the laugh until later \u2013 which I think is always good. We were really happy with the small changes we made. We made tiny changes in two scenes: we took out the text for what the ALA stood for... I think it gave it a [[Ernst Lubitsch|Lubitschean]] vagueness and delayed the laugh.<ref>{{cite web | title = Mr. Beaks And Whit Stillman Discuss The Delightful DAMSELS IN DISTRESS! | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/node/55311 | date=April 27, 2013 | website = Ain't It Cool News | access-date = September 1, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Music==\nThe film features an original score by Mark Suozzo.
