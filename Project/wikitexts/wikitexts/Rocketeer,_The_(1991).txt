It is based on the [[Rocketeer|character of the same name]] created by comic book artist and writer [[Dave Stevens]].\n\nSet in 1938 [[Los Angeles, California]], ''The Rocketeer'' tells the story of [[Aerobatics|stunt pilot]] Cliff Secord who discovers a hidden [[rocket pack]] that he thereafter uses to fly without the need of an aircraft. His heroic deeds soon attract the attention of [[Howard Hughes]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], who are hunting for the missing rocket pack, as well as the [[Nazism|Nazi]] operatives that stole it from Hughes.\n\nDevelopment for ''The Rocketeer'' started as far back as 1983, when Stevens sold the [[film rights]] to the character. [[Steve Miner]] and [[William Dear]] considered directing ''The Rocketeer'' before Johnston signed on. Screenwriters [[Danny Bilson]] and [[Paul De Meo]] had creative differences with Disney, causing the film to languish in [[development hell]].<ref>Mitchell, Kerrie. \"Dept. of development hell.\" ''Premiere (American edition)'', Volume 18, Issue 5, February 2005, p. 40.</ref> The studio also intended to change the trademark helmet design; Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] wanted a straight [[NASA]]-type helmet, but Johnston convinced the studio otherwise. Johnston also had to convince Disney to let him cast actor Billy Campbell in the lead role. Filming for ''The Rocketeer'' lasted from September 19, 1990, to January 22, 1991. The [[visual effects]] sequences were created and designed by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and supervised by animation director [[Wes Takahashi]].\n\nThe film was released on June 21, 1991, and received positive reviews from critics.<ref>Maltin 2000, p. 302.</ref> Plans for ''Rocketeer'' sequels were abandoned after the film was a [[box office disappointment]], grossing $46 million on a $35 million budget. However, a [[The Rocketeer (2019 TV series)|television series]] based on the film, with Campbell reprising his role, premiered on [[Disney Junior]] in November 2019. In early 1991, [[Toy Biz]] had the rights to a massive Rocketeer toy line including different versions of Cliff akin to the [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] Batman toy lines. Several prototypes were made but the toy line was promptly shut down and Disney pulled the license from Toy Biz leaving only Just Toys to have the rights.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1938 [[Los Angeles]], gangsters from Eddie Valentine's gang steal a prototype [[rocket pack]] from aviation magnate [[Howard Hughes]]. During their escape from the pursuing police, the getaway driver quickly stops and hides the rocket pack in a [[biplane]] at an airfield. As the chase continues, [[stunt pilot]] Cliff Secord's [[Gee Bee Model Z|Gee Bee]] [[monoplane]] is wrecked, ending his air-racing career. Valentine's gang has been hired by film star Neville Sinclair to steal the rocket pack, and he now sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver as to device's location before Lothar kills him. Meanwhile, Cliff and his [[Aircraft maintenance technician|airplane mechanic]], Peevy, find the hidden rocket pack and begin testing it.\n\nCliff's girlfriend is aspiring actress Jenny Blake, who has a small part in Sinclair's latest film; recent events are now driving a wedge in their relationship. Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local [[air show]], Cliff uses the rocket pack to rescue his elderly friend Malcolm, who is piloting an aging [[Curtiss JN Jenny]] biplane in order to save Cliff's job. This makes Cliff an immediate flying sensation, but also sets Sinclair and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] on his trail.\n\nSinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket pack. The FBI arrives soon after, but Cliff and Peevy escape while Lothar steals a [[schematic]] drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy are trapped by several Valentine mobsters; they learn about Jenny's date with Sinclair and the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, but a stray fired bullet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum. Cliff proceeds to fly to the South Seas Club, where he tells Jenny about his new Rocketeer alter ego. The Valentine gang arrives, and in the ensuing mel\u00e9e, Sinclair kidnaps Jenny.\n\nAt Sinclair's home, Jenny knocks him out and discovers that he is a [[Nazi Germany|German]] spy. She is quickly recaptured and forced to tell Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the [[Griffith Observatory]] in exchange for her life. Shortly afterwards, Cliff is arrested by the FBI and taken to Howard Hughes, who explains his rocket pack is a prototype similar to one Nazi scientists have been unsuccessful in developing; he shows him a horrifying Nazi propaganda film depicting an army of Third Reich commandos using rocket packs to invade the United States. He also mentions that the FBI are trying to locate a Nazi spy in Hollywood employing Valentine's gang, whom Cliff realizes is Sinclair. When Hughes and the FBI demand the return of the rocket pack, Cliff escapes. but inadvertently leaves behind a clue to where he is headed.\n\nCliff flies to the rendezvous, where Sinclair demands that Cliff hand over the rocket pack. Cliff divulges to Eddie that the actor is a Nazi spy, and the infuriated Valentine gang turns their weapons on Sinclair. However, Sinclair summons a hidden troop of heavily armed Nazi [[Sturmabteilung|S.A.]], as the German [[rigid airship|airship]] ''Luxembourg'' appears overhead to evacuate Sinclair and the troops. The FBI, who have secretly followed Cliff, suddenly announce their presence, and they and the mobsters join forces and battle the Nazis. Sinclair and Lothar escape, dragging Jenny aboard the airship.\n\nCliff flies to and boards ''Luxembourg'', but during the ensuing showdown, Jenny accidentally starts a fire with a flare gun on the airship's bridge. Sinclair holds Jenny hostage, forcing Cliff to give him the rocket pack, but not before Cliff covertly removes the chewing gum patching the leak. Sinclair dons the rocket pack and flies off, but the leaking fuel causes the rocket to catch on fire, causing Sinclair to plummet to his fiery death. Lothar is killed as ''Luxembourg'' explodes, but Cliff and Jenny are rescued by Howard Hughes and Peevy flying a [[Pitcairn PCA-2]] [[autogiro]].\n\nHughes later presents Cliff with a brand-new Gee Bee air racer and a fresh pack of [[Beemans gum]]. As Hughes leaves, Jenny returns Peevy's rocket pack blueprints, which she found in Sinclair's home; Peevy decides that, with some modifications, he can build an even better rocket pack.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Billy Campbell]] as Cliff Secord (\"The Rocketeer\")\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Jenny Blake\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as A. \"Peevy\" Peabody\n* [[Timothy Dalton]] as Neville Sinclair\n* [[Terry O'Quinn]] as [[Howard Hughes]]\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as FBI Agent Fitch\n* [[James Handy]] as FBI Agent \"Wooly\" Wolinski\n* [[Paul Sorvino]] as Eddie Valentine\n* [[Jon Polito]] as Otis Bigelow\n* [[William Sanderson]] as Skeets\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Millie\n* [[John Lavachielli]] as Rusty\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Monk\n* [[Melora Hardin]] as South Seas Singer\n* [[Rick Overton]] as South Seas Patron\n* [[Max Grod\u00e9nchik]] as Wilmer\n* [[Tiny Ron Taylor]] as Lothar\n* [[Eddie Jones (actor)|Eddie Jones]] as Malcolm\n* Don Pugsley as \"Goose\"\n* Nada Despotovich as Irma \n* [[America Martin]] as Patsy \n* [[Michael Milhoan]] as Jeff\n* Daniel O'Shea as Mike\n* Joe D'Angerio as Stevie\n* Tommy J.

[[Steve Miner]] purchased the [[film rights]] from Stevens in 1983, but he strayed too far from the original concept and the rights reverted to Stevens.<ref name=Cooke/> In 1985 Stevens gave writers [[Danny Bilson]] and [[Paul De Meo]] a free [[option (finance)|option]] on ''The Rocketeer'' rights. Stevens liked that \"their ideas for ''The Rocketeer'' were heartfelt and affectionate tributes to the 1930s [[movie serial]]s with all the right dialogue and atmosphere. Most people would approach my characters contemporarily, but Danny and Paul saw them as pre-war mugs\".<ref name=Dan/>\n\nStevens, Bilson and De Meo began to consider making ''The Rocketeer'' as a [[low-budget film]], shot in [[black-and-white]] and funded by [[independent film|independent investors]]. Their plan was to make the film a complete [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to Republic's ''[[Commando Cody]]'' rocket man serials, and use a cast largely associated with [[character actor]]s. However, that same year, the trio approached [[William Dear]] to direct/co-write ''The Rocketeer'', and they eventually dropped the low-budget idea.<ref name=Cooke/> Bilson, De Meo, and Dear kept the comic book's basic plot intact, but fleshed it out to include a Hollywood setting and a climactic battle against a Nazi Zeppelin.<ref name=Dan>{{cite web|author=Tom K. Ranheim|url=https://www.davestevens.com/gallery/publisher/cinefantastique|title=Cinefantastique - The Authorized Dave Stevens Web Site|website=Davestevens.com|date=August 1, 1991|access-date=August 20, 2021}}</ref> They also tweaked Cliff's girlfriend to avoid comparisons to [[Bettie Page]] (Stevens' original inspiration), changing her name from Betty to Jenny and her profession from nude model to Hollywood extra (a change also made to make the film more Disney family-friendly).<ref name=Cooke/> Dear proceeded to transform the climax from a submarine into a Zeppelin setpiece.<ref name=Dan/>\n\nStevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear began to [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] ''The Rocketeer'' in 1986 to the [[major film studio]]s but were turned down. \"This was 1986, long before ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' or ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' or anything similar\", Stevens explained. \"In those days, no studio was interested at all in an expensive comic book movie. We got there about three years too early for our own good!\"<ref name=Cooke/> [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] eventually accepted ''The Rocketeer'' because they believed the film had [[toyetic]] potential and appeal for merchandising. ''The Rocketeer'' was set to be released through the studio's [[Touchstone Pictures]] label; Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear all signed a contract which would permit them to make a trilogy of ''Rocketeer'' films. However, Disney studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] switched the film to a [[Walt Disney Pictures]] release. According to Stevens, \"immediately, Betty and anything else 'adult' went right out with the bathwater. They really tried to shoehorn it into a kiddie property so they could sell toys. All they really wanted at the end of the day, was the name\".<ref name=Cooke/>\n\nBilson and DeMeo then submitted their seven-page [[film treatment]] to Disney, but the studio put their script through an endless series of revisions. Over five years, Disney fired and rehired Bilson and DeMeo three times. DeMeo explained that \"Disney felt that they needed a different approach to the script, which meant bringing in someone else. But those scripts were thrown out and we were always brought back on\".<ref name=Dan/> They found the studio's constant tinkering with the screenplay to be a frustrating process as \"executives would like previously excised dialogue three months later. Scenes that had been thrown out two years ago were put back in. What was the point\"?<ref name=Dan/> DeMeo said. One of Bilson and De Meo's significant revisions to the script over the years was to make Cliff and Jenny's romance more believable and avoid [[clich\u00e9]] aspects that would [[stereotype]] Jenny as a [[damsel in distress]].<ref name=Dan/> The numerous project delays forced Dear to drop out as director. [[Joe Johnston]], a fan of the comic book, immediately offered his services as director when he found out Disney owned the film rights. Johnston was quickly hired and [[pre-production]] started in early 1990. After Bilson and De Meo's third major rewrite, Disney finally [[Greenlight|greenlit]] ''The Rocketeer''.<ref name=Dan/>\n\nThe characterization of Neville Sinclair was inspired by movie star [[Errol Flynn]].<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Time's Reviewers/Compiled by Andrea Sachs |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,973528-2,00.html |title=Critics' Voices|date=August 5, 1991|magazine=TIME}}</ref> The film's Neville Sinclair is, like biographer [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]]'s Flynn, a movie star known for his work in swashbuckler roles who is secretly a Nazi spy.

He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a [[fear of flying]] but overcame it with the help of the film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft.<ref name=Dan/> Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.<ref name=\"Vaz\">Vaz and Duignan 1996, pp. 68, 70.</ref>\n\nFor the female lead of Cliff's girlfriend Jenny, [[Sherilyn Fenn]], [[Kelly Preston]], [[Diane Lane]] and [[Elizabeth McGovern]] were considered before [[Jennifer Connelly]] was eventually cast.<ref name=Rescue/> Campbell and Connelly's working relationship eventually led to a romantic coupling, which Johnston found to be a technique for [[method acting]] that helped with their on-screen chemistry.<ref name=Dan/> For Secord's sidekick, Peevy, Dave Stevens hoped that [[Lloyd Bridges]] would play the part, but Bridges turned it down and [[Alan Arkin]] was cast. The part of Neville Sinclair was offered to [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Charles Dance]] before [[Timothy Dalton]] accepted the role. Lastly, the part of Eddie Valentine was written with [[Joe Pesci]] in mind, but he turned down the part, which went to [[Paul Sorvino]].<ref name=Rescue>\"Rocketeer To The Rescue!\" ''Prevue'', Issue #84, August 1991.</ref>\n\nRemaining cast members included [[Tiny Ron Taylor]] as Lothar, [[Terry O'Quinn]] as Howard Hughes, [[Jon Polito]] as Otis Bigelow, [[Ed Lauter]] as Agent Fitch, [[Eddie Jones (actor)|Eddie Jones]] as Malcolm the Mechanic and Robert Miranda as Spanish Johnny. ''Rocketeer'' creator [[Dave Stevens]] has a cameo as the German test pilot who is killed when the Nazis' version of a rocket backpack explodes during the takeoff sequence.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] for ''The Rocketeer'' lasted from September 19, 1990, to January 22, 1991.<ref name=budget/> Filming at the Griffith Observatory took place in November 1990.<ref name=budget/> The film ended up going 50 days over schedule due to weather and mechanical problems.<ref name=Dan/> ''Rocketeer'' creator Dave Stevens allied himself with director Joe Johnston and production manager Ian Bryce in an effort to be as heavily involved in the production process as possible and to try and secure as much [[artistic control]] as he could from Disney. Disney, in particular, was not enthusiastic with Stevens' involvement. \"I was on the set day and night\", Stevens reflected, \"from [[pre-production]] till [[post-production]]! And initially, I had to fight to prove that I was there for the benefit of the film, and not for my own ego\".<ref name=Cooke/>\n\nThe original production budget was set at $25 million, but rose to $35 million. This happened after Disney became impressed with the [[dailies]]; \"they realized this was a bigger movie than they were anticipating\", Johnston explained, \"and they approved overages. It never got completely out of control\".<ref name=budget/> An abandoned World War II [[runway]] at the Santa Maria, California airport set the scene for the fictional Chaplin Air Field. Additional scenes were shot at [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]].<ref group=Note>The large hangar built for the movie at the Santa Maria airport was purchased and moved across the field and placed next to the original at the airport.

Much of the original film set detail is visible inside, and there is an added library that can be used for researchers.</ref> For the air circus scene, 700 Santa Maria [[extra (actor)|extra]]s and 25 vintage aircraft were employed.

President [[Michael Eisner]] wanted a straight [[NASA]]-type helmet but director Johnston threatened to quit production on ''The Rocketeer''. Disney relented, but only after creating a number of prototype designs that were ultimately rejected by the filmmakers. Stevens asked Johnston for one week to produce a good helmet design. He proceeded to work with a sculptor he knew, made a cast of the film's main stunt man's head and brainstormed ideas with the help of his sketches. They produced a helmet that the filmmakers agreed looked appropriate from all angles; in most respects it was identical to the helmet design Stevens had used for his comics series.<ref name=Cooke/>\n\n[[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] designed the [[Rondo Hatton]]-inspired [[prosthetic makeup]] designs for the Lothar character, portrayed by [[Tiny Ron Taylor]].<ref name=\"Maltin\">[[Leonard Maltin|Maltin, Leonard]] et al. 2003, pp. 1178\u20131179.</ref>\n\n===Visual effects===\n[[File:H-WoodX.jpg|thumb|ILM's scale modeled-explosion of the [[Hollywood Sign]]]]\nThe visual effects were designed and created by [[George Lucas]]' [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) with Ken Ralston (''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] founder) serving as the [[visual effects supervisor|VFX supervisor]].
