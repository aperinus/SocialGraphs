The film features an [[ensemble cast]] including MacFarlane, [[Charlize Theron]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Giovanni Ribisi]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Liam Neeson]]. The film follows a cowardly [[American frontier|frontier]]sman who gains courage with the help of a female gunfighter and must use his newfound skills in a confrontation with her villainous outlaw husband.\n\nDevelopment for ''A Million Ways to Die in the West'' began while MacFarlane and co-writers Sulkin and Wild were watching western movies during the development of ''[[Ted (film)|Ted]]''. Casting was done between December 2012 and March 2013. Filming began on May 6, 2013, in various locations in [[New Mexico]] including [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and it concluded on August 9 that year. [[Joel McNeely]] composed the score.\n\nThe film was released on May 30, 2014, in the United States, and distributed worldwide by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with criticism for its length, screenplay, humor and Macfarlane's performance and directing. It was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on October 7, 2014, and earned more than $15 million in home media sales.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=October 2022}}\nIn 1882, in the town of Old Stump, [[Arizona]], timid [[Sheep farming|sheep farmer]] Albert Stark's girlfriend Louise breaks up with him because of his refusal to defend himself in a duel. He prepares to migrate to [[San Francisco]], believing that the [[American frontier|frontier]] offers nothing for him. Meanwhile, infamous outlaw Clinch Leatherwood shoots and kills an old prospector over a single gold nugget. He orders his right-hand man, Lewis, to escort his wife Anna to Old Stump while he continues his banditry.\n\nLewis and Anna arrive in Old Stump under the guise of two siblings intending to build a farm, but Lewis is arrested after shooting the pastor's son in a saloon fight. During the brawl, Albert saves Anna from being crushed to death, and the two become close friends. They attend a county fair where Louise's new boyfriend, the arrogant Foy, challenges Albert to a shooting contest. Albert loses, but Anna steps in and defeats Foy. Foy publicly humiliates Albert, who impulsively challenges Foy to a duel in a week's time to win back Louise. Anna then spends the week teaching Albert how to shoot.\n\nDuring a barn dance the night before the duel, Anna gives Foy a [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|Mickey]]. After leaving the dance, Albert and Anna kiss before heading home. After breaking out of jail and murdering the sheriff, Lewis observes the kiss and reports it to Clinch. On the day of the duel, Foy arrives late and gets [[diarrhea]] from the [[laxative]] he had unknowingly drunk. Albert, who has decided that Louise is not worth fighting for, forfeits anyway. He retires to the saloon, but Clinch arrives and reveals that Anna is his wife, threatening to kill more people unless his wife's lover duels him the next day. Later, Clinch confronts Anna by demanding that she reveal Albert's name and his whereabouts, or he will kill her. Before he attempts to rape her, she knocks him unconscious with a rock and escapes.\n\nAnna returns to Albert's farm to warn him about Clinch, but he chastises her for lying to him. Clinch, having regained consciousness, tracks down Anna to the farm, but Albert helps her escape, then escapes himself. While fleeing, he is captured by a tribe of [[Apache]] Indians, who threaten to burn him alive. The Apaches spare him when he reveals that he can speak their language. They give him a bowl of [[peyote]], which sends him flashing back to his birth and through painful events of his childhood before a vision of Anna makes him realize he loves her.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinch recaptures Anna in town, but Albert returns to Old Stump and confronts him. He wounds Clinch with a bullet dipped in [[rattlesnake]] venom before his own gun is shot out of his hand but manages to stall until Clinch fatally succumbs to the poison. Louise attempts to win back Albert, but he rejects her and instead happily enters into a relationship with Anna, who becomes his new girlfriend. Albert also receives a bounty for killing Clinch and uses the money to buy more sheep.\n\nIn a pre-credits scene, the proprietor of a [[Racism|racist]] shooting game called \"Runaway Slave\" at the fair asks who would like to take a shot. [[Django Unchained|Django]] steps up and shoots the man while commenting that \"people die at the fair\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Seth MacFarlane]] as Albert Stark, a wimpy but kind-hearted sheepherder\n** Mike Salazar as 6-year-old Albert\n** [[Preston Bailey]] as 12-year-old Albert\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Anna Barnes-Leatherwood,<ref>{{cite web  | url=https://screenrant.com/a-million-ways-die-west-trailer-seth-macfarlane-charlize-theron/  | title='A Million Ways to Die in the West' Trailer Has a Whole Lot of Death  | last1=Shaw-Williams  | first1=Hannah  | date=February 3, 2014  | website=Screen Rant  | access-date=February 5, 2014}}</ref> Clinch Leatherwood's rebellious wife, who befriends Albert\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Louise,<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\">{{cite news | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rex-linn-joins-seth-macfarlanes-560741  | title=Rex Linn Joins Seth MacFarlane's 'A Million Ways to Die in the West' | newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]  | date=May 30, 2013  | access-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref> Albert's unappreciative ex-girlfriend\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Clinch Leatherwood,<ref name=\"screenrant1\">{{cite web | url=https://screenrant.com/million-ways-to-die-in-the-west-liam-neeson-giovanni-ribisi/  | title=Liam Neeson & Giovanni Ribisi Join 'A Million Ways to Die in the West'  | website=Screen Rant | access-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref> a notorious [[Outlaw (stock character)|outlaw]] and Anna's abusive husband\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Edward,<ref name=\"screenrant1\"/> a cobbler, Albert's best friend and Ruth's boyfriend\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as Foy,<ref>Quinlan, Erin (May 21, 2014).
