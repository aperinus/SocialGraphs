It was based on the 1990 [[Death and the Maiden (play)|play of the same name]] by [[Ariel Dorfman]], who also co-wrote the screenplay with [[Rafael Yglesias]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPaulina Escobar (Weaver) is a housewife married to a prominent lawyer in an unnamed [[South America]]n country (implied to be [[Chile]]). One day a storm  forces her husband Gerardo (Wilson) to ride home with a charming stranger, while the power at his home is cut. She is convinced that the stranger, Dr. Miranda (Kingsley), was part of the old regime and that he tortured and raped her for weeks while she was blindfolded. Paulina takes him captive to determine the truth. Despite attempts by both her husband and Miranda to convince her that he is innocent, Paulina is certain that he is the one, and forces her husband to be Miranda's \"attorney\" in the \"trial\" she arranges for him.\n\nMiranda conspires with Gerardo to agree to a false confession (as Paulina states that this is all that she wants in exchange for his life), so they write one up and present it to Paulina. Enraged, Paulina deems Miranda as being unrepentant, and threatens to kill him. As Gerardo tries to stop her, Miranda succeeds in getting Paulina's gun, and threatens to kill her if he is not freed. As he advances toward the door, the power in the house turns on and Paulina hits him, getting back in control. In a last-ditch effort to save his life, Miranda implores Gerardo to call the Spanish medical school where he claims to have been at the time of Paulina's rape, as she leads him blindfolded out the door to the edge of the cliff. Gerardo contacts the school, where Miranda's colleague seems to confirm the story. He races to inform Paulina, at last convinced that Miranda is innocent. Paulina refuses to believe it, however, saying that the doctors at that time created alibis in order to conceal their identities. Accepting defeat, Miranda finally tells them that he really was the doctor, that he enjoyed brutalizing Paulina, and that he was sorry that the old regime fell.\n\nEnraged, Gerardo attempts to throw Miranda from the cliff, only to realize he cannot bring himself to take a life. Paulina apparently accepts the confession, and they both leave Miranda on the cliff as he stares down at the water. The camera simulates someone falling off the cliff as seen from his own point of view. In the final scene, Paulina and Gerardo are at the same concert where the film began with Miranda also present, looking down with his wife and sons. Paulina and Miranda cast uncomfortable glances at each other, and look away. Miranda glances down at the couple again as the camera shows Gerardo glancing up towards the balcony at the now off-screen Miranda.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Paulina Escobar\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Dr. Roberto Miranda\n* [[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]] as Gerardo Escobar\n\n== Production ==\nRoman Polanski said he greatly enjoyed making the film. Producer [[Bonnie Timmermann]], who had worked with Polanski on three other films, was pleased to say that he was ahead of schedule and praised Polanski's work calling it \"his best movie since '[[Tess (1979 film)|Tess]]'.<ref name=\"Archerd\">{{cite web |date=22 April 1994 |last=Archerd |first=Army |author-link=author |title=Polanski excited about 'Maiden' voyage |url=https://variety.com/1994/voices/columns/polanski-excited-about-maiden-voyage-1117862470/ |website=Variety }}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nA central [[motif (literature)|motif]] is [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[string quartet]] in [[D minor]], which is known as the [[Death and the Maiden Quartet (Schubert)|\"Death and the Maiden\" Quartet]].
