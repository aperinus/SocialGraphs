The film stars [[Ashley Judd]], [[Michael Shannon]], [[Lynn Collins]], [[Br\u00edan F. O'Byrne]], and [[Harry Connick Jr.]]\n\n''Bug'' debuted at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]] before being purchased by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]], which released the film the following year in May 2007. The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised its intensity, directing, acting, and take on [[paranoia]], but were polarized about its writing. They disagreed about the ending in particular. Friedkin and Letts collaborated again as director and writer on the 2011 film ''[[Killer Joe (film)|Killer Joe]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAgnes White is a waitress working at a [[gay bar]] while living in a run-down motel in rural [[Oklahoma]]. Unable to move on after the disappearance of her young son nearly ten years ago, Agnes binges on drugs and alcohol with her lesbian friend R.C.\n\nAgnes is constantly plagued by silent telephone calls that she believes are being made by her abusive ex-husband Jerry Goss, who has recently been released from prison. One night, R.C. introduces Agnes to Peter Evans, a drifter who says his father is a preacher. Agnes and Peter's mutual loneliness draws them together and Agnes allows Peter to stay the night. Peter, who has a sore tooth, tracks down a cricket that is chirping in a smoke alarm within the motel room, and kills it with a ball handed to him by Agnes.\n\nJerry barges into Agnes's room next morning while Peter is out getting food. Agnes is afraid of Jerry who she says nearly killed her previously. He menaces her but tries to reconcile with her; she says she hates him, whereupon he hits her, knocking her to the ground. He says he will return to the house in later days after he has finished some business he has to take care of down South. Jerry then robs her, and as he leaves the motel, pushes past the returning Peter.\n\nPeter seems oddly paranoid about machines but Agnes seems to trust him. She tells him that her son Lloyd disappeared when he was six and she gave up looking for him some years ago. The two have sex. Peter apparently discovers aphids in the bed and kills a number of them. He decides to flee, upsetting Agnes, who feels newly abandoned. Peter returns within moments as Agnes cries. He convinces her that he was the subject of biological testing by the U.S. government while in the military, and says the anonymous phone calls were made by government agents in anticipation of his arrival. Afterwards, he tells her that the room has become infested by bugs planted by the government as part of the experiments. Peter's movements and behavior become more erratic as he fights the \"invisible\" bugs, that he claims are infesting his body.\n\nOver time, Agnes begins to share in his behavior. R.C., who has taken Agnes to visit a dermatologist, is convinced there are no bugs in the motel room. Agnes has also reported to the motel owner that their room has bugs but says he told her none of the other rooms have a bug problem. Peter is furious over these developments. R.C. tries to convince Agnes to leave Peter, mentioning that a man named Dr. Sweet is looking for him. But, after Peter has an episode, Agnes slaps R.C. and tells her to leave. Peter and Agnes isolate themselves, closing the room, covering it with [[flypaper]] and [[aluminum foil]] to fend off communications, and lighting it with the glow from [[bug zapper]]s. Peter, believing that a colony of microscopic bug egg-sacs was implanted in one of his teeth, tears the tooth out with pliers. After examining the tooth using a child's microscope, he believes he sees the bugs in the remains of the crushed tooth, as does Agnes. Peter is progressively more obsessed with using the microscope, believing that the bugs are living in and eating his blood.\n\nDr. Sweet arrives at the motel with Jerry Goss. Sweet sends Goss outside. Sweet tells Agnes that Peter escaped from a [[mental institution]] where he was undergoing treatment. Sweet says that [[delusional parasitosis|delusions about insects]] are a known symptom of Peter's mental illness. Sweet questions Agnes about her mental condition and circumstances. Agnes tells Sweet that she and Peter believe that the foil shields the room from signals which the bugs are attempting to transmit to the outside world. Sweet is placating and tries to convince Agnes to deliver Peter into his care so he can put Peter back into the hospital where if necessary an operation can be performed to remove the bugs. Agnes distrusts him until Sweet implies that he knows where her son Lloyd might be and that if he helps her, he could reveal more information that might reunite her with her missing son. After Agnes slaps a bug that seems to be biting her and holds it out to show Sweet, he says 'that's no delusion\" and his questioning of her takes a more sinister turn. The sound of what may be a helicopter overhead is heard and Sweet says that 'they are listening' but that he can help Agnes and Peter.\n\nPeter appears from the bedroom wielding a knife. As he argues with Sweet, Sweet unobtrusively readies a syringe, preparing to sedate Peter, but Peter stabs and savagely kills Sweet. Agnes is distraught believing that Peter has destroyed her chance of learning more about her son, but Peter insists Sweet was not even human, merely a 'robot' sent by the government. Together, Peter and Agnes elaborate upon Peter's beliefs in an escalating conspiracy, becoming convinced that Agnes's son was kidnapped by the government to lead her and Peter to meet. They believe that each was separately infected with bugs meant to mate with each another (one being the 'drone' and one being the 'Queen') and take over the world. To prevent this, Agnes and Peter decide douse each other in [[gasoline]]. Jerry Goss, furious over his ex-wife's unstable behaviour, tries to break into the room after being ordered to leave a third time by Sweet but Agnes injures him with a [[nailgun]]. Both she and Peter then set themselves on fire, dying in the process. Before they ignite, they swear their love to each other.\n\nDuring the end credits, various toys in Agnes's room are shown completely intact, with no sign of the aluminum foil. The opening shot of the film is repeated with the body of Sweet lying prone in the foil-covered room which is undamaged by fire. It is left unclear which shot, if any, is \"real\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as Agnes White\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Peter Evans\n* [[Lynn Collins]] as R.C.\n* [[Br\u00edan F. O'Byrne]] as Dr. Sweet\n* [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] as Jerry Goss\n\n==Production==\n===Settings===\nThe set design was done by [[Franco-Giacomo Carbone]], the production designer of films such as ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005) and ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (2006).\n\nMost of the film's action occurs in a seedy motel room. The scenario has three interconnected rooms \u2014 a bathroom, a [[kitchenette]] and a living room. At one point in the film, the room has several dozen [[Flypaper|fly strips]] hanging from the ceiling. At another point the entire room is covered from floor to ceiling in tinfoil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lectrosonics.com/US/Press-Releases/it-s-all-lectrosonics-wireless-for-william-friedkin-s-new-thriller-bug.html|title=It's All Lectrosonics Wireless for William Friedkin's New Thriller \" Bug \"|date=March 1, 2006|publisher=Lectrosonics|access-date=December 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114034417/http://www.lectrosonics.com/US/Press-Releases/it-s-all-lectrosonics-wireless-for-william-friedkin-s-new-thriller-bug.html|archive-date=January 14, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Friedkin has said the tinfoil was a nightmare to work with, because it had to be repaired constantly, and because it reflected everybody who was there, including the crew.\n\n===Filming locations===\nExteriors of the motel were filmed near [[Olancha, California|Olancha]], [[California]], and at [[Grace King High School]]<ref>[http://blog.nola.com/annmaloney/2007/06/pirates_and_paintings.html Pirates and Paintings | NOLA.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725150218/http://blog.nola.com/annmaloney/2007/06/pirates_and_paintings.html|date=July 25, 2011}}.
