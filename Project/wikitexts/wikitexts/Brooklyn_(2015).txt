A co-production between the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada, it stars [[Saoirse Ronan]] in the lead role, with [[Emory Cohen]], [[Domhnall Gleeson]], [[Jim Broadbent]], and [[Julie Walters]] in supporting roles. The plot follows Eilis Lacey, a young Irishwoman who emigrates to [[Brooklyn]] in the early 1950s to find employment. After building a life there, she is drawn back to her home town of [[Enniscorthy]] and has to choose where she wants to forge her future. Principal photography began in April 2014 with three weeks of filming in Ireland, which were followed by four weeks in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]; only two days of filming took place in Brooklyn, one of which was spent at the beach in [[Coney Island]].\n\nThe film premiered on 26 January 2015 at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]],<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-fox-searchlight-nabs-brooklyn-765808|title=Sundance: Fox Searchlight Nabs 'Brooklyn'|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=27 January 2015|access-date=25 July 2016|last=Kit|first=Borys}}</ref> and was later screened as part of the Special Presentations section of the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September.

Critical response to the film was overwhelmingly positive, with many reviewers praising the screenplay and direction. Ronan's performance was also highlighted by many critics, and she was nominated for numerous awards for Best Actress, including a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA]], [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress|Critics' Choice Award]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe]], and [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]]. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]], and was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Ronan), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It was also featured on more than 120 film critics' \"Top 10\" lists of the best films of 2015, and was ranked 48th on the [[BBC]]'s 2016 list of the [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]].<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1951, in [[Enniscorthy]], a small town in southeast Ireland, Eilis Lacey lives with her mother and older sister, Rose. Although she is an intelligent young woman, Eilis is unable to find full-time employment, so she works weekends at a shop run by the spiteful Miss Kelly. Eilis often accompanies her friend Nancy to local dances, but she is uninterested in the local young men.\n\nRose arranges with Father Flood, an Irish priest in Brooklyn, for Eilis to move to New York City, where, it is hoped, there will be more opportunities for her. On the trip over, Eilis suffers from seasickness, but is locked out of the shared toilet by the women in the adjoining cabin. Her bunkmate, Georgina, an experienced traveler returning to the United States after a visit home, comes to her aid and offers advice and support.\n\nIn New York, Eilis moves into a Brooklyn boarding house run by Mrs Kehoe that caters to young Irish women, and Father Flood gets her a job as a salesclerk at a fancy department store, but she has difficulty adjusting to her new life. She feels homesick, particularly after reading the letters she receives from Rose. Upon learning this, Father Flood takes a more active interest in Eilis and gets her enrolled in [[night school]] bookkeeping classes at [[Brooklyn College]], as she wants to become an accountant.\n\nAt an Irish dance, Eilis meets Tony Fiorello, an amiable Italian-American plumber. They begin dating, and, as their romance becomes more serious and she progresses in her studies, she gradually begins to feel more at home in Brooklyn.\n\nWhen Rose unexpectedly dies, Eilis tells Tony she must return home to help her mother. He shows her a plot of land on Long Island and tells her he and his brothers intend to build five houses on it, selling three and keeping one for their parents and one for him and Eilis, if she wants it. She says she does, but she still feels the need to visit her mother, so Tony asks her to marry him before she goes. Eilis is hesitant, but agrees, and they secretly marry at City Hall. While there, they bump into an Irish couple with relatives in Enniscorthy.\n\nOnce back in Ireland, Eilis falls, not back into her old life, but into a new one. She temporarily takes Rose's still-vacant bookkeeping job to help out, and all indications are that the permanent position is hers, if she wants it. Perhaps more surprisingly for her, however, Eilis finds herself developing feelings for the thoughtful, well-off bachelor Jim Farrell, who Nancy set her up with, not knowing about Eilis' marriage. Eilis extends her trip to attend Nancy's wedding, and avoids reading Tony's letters. Jim asks her to stay and indicates he would like to propose marriage, but Eilis remains noncommittal, as she is not sure which future she wants for herself.\n\nOne day, Miss Kelly tells Eilis, seemingly as a threat, that she knows through gossip from the couple at City Hall that Eilis is married. Agitated, Eilis remembers the stifling and restrictive nature of life in Enniscorthy. She tearfully informs her mother that she is married to Tony and returns to Brooklyn, leaving a farewell letter for Jim. On the ocean crossing, Eilis offers guidance to a young woman making her own first trip to America. Once home, Eilis reunites with Tony and they embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- first 14 in the same order as the tombstone closing credits, the rest in the same order as the closing credits scroll (which is in order of appearance) --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Eilis Lacey\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Jim Farrell\n* [[Emory Cohen]] as Tony Fiorello\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Father Flood\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Mrs Kehoe\n* [[Jessica Par\u00e9]] as Miss Fortini\n* Eve Macklin as Diana\n* [[Br\u00edd Brennan]] as Miss Kelly\n* [[Fiona Glascott]] as Rose Lacey\n* [[Jane Brennan]] as Mary Lacey\n* [[Nora-Jane Noone]] as Sheila\n* [[Jenn Murray]] as Dolores\n* [[Eva Birthistle]] as Georgina\n* [[Michael Zegen]] as Maurizio Fiorello\n* [[Eileen O'Higgins]] as Nancy\n* [[Peter Campion (actor)|Peter Campion]] as George Sheridan\n* [[Emily Bett Rickards]] as Patty McGuire\n* Mary O'Driscoll as Miss McAdam\n* [[Ellen David]] as Mrs Fiorello\n* [[Christian de la Cortina]] as Laurenzio Fiorello\n* Paulino Nunes as Mr Fiorello\n* James DiGiacomo as Frankie Fiorello\n* [[Karen Ardiff]] as Mrs Farrell\n* Gary Lydon as Mr Farrell\n* Mella Carron as Girl on Deck\n}}\n\n[[Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn]], the author of [[Brooklyn (novel)|the novel]] upon which the film is based, has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as the man in line in front of Eilis the first time she goes through immigration in New York.\n\n==Production==\n===Historical context===\nThe film is set during a time when Irish migration to [[New York City|New York]] was thriving. The initial boom of Irish [[immigration]] to the US had started during the period following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] (1845\u201349).<ref>O'Sullivan, Patrick (4 November 1998). \"Irish Women and Irish Migration\". Retrieved 15 February 2019</ref> By the end of [[World War II]], the rate of Irish immigration to New York had declined, but newly arriving citizens were still be able to find bustling Irish communities in which women were arguably a more significant presence than men.<ref>Begley, Sarah (4 November 2015). \"Brooklyn and the True History of Irish Immigrants in 1950s New York City\". time.com. Retrieved 15 February 2019</ref> These women immigrants were often very active in the workplace, placing marriage ambitions on hold to find practical occupations in places such as supermarkets, eateries, and stores. Eilis makes her journey from Ireland to America in the 1950s, along with approximately 50,000 other immigrants (around a quarter of whom moved to New York) as a part of the second minor wave of migration. Many of these migrants were in search of steadier jobs and a happier lifestyle. There were also smaller surges of immigrants from many other countries at this time, expanding the trend of modern-day America becoming a vast land of many different cultures.<ref>Brownfield, Alan (25 January 2016). \"Brooklyn in the 1950s: an America that lives only in memory\". chroniclesmagazine.org. Retrieved 15 February 2019</ref>\n\n===Adaptation===\n''Brooklyn'' is adapted from Irish writer [[Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn]]'s 2009 novel [[Brooklyn (novel)|of the same name]]. The novel has been much-celebrated in the literary world, with ''[[The Observer]]'' naming it as one of \"The 10 best historical novels\" in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2012/may/13/ten-best-historical-novels|title=The 10 Best Historical Novels|last=Skidelsky|first=William|website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=13 May 2012|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref> In addition to this, it won the 2009 [[Costa Book Awards|Costa Novel Award]], was shortlisted for the 2011 [[International Dublin Literary Award]], and was longlisted for the 2009 [[Booker Prize]].\n\nThe film is generally regarded as a faithful adaptation of the novel, with T\u00f3ib\u00edn noting the overall \"authenticity\" of the film in an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/colm-toibin-loves-the-new-movie-version-of-his-brooklyn/2015/11/02/14db7ce6-8103-11e5-8ba6-cec48b74b2a7_|title=Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn loves the new movie version of his 'Brooklyn'|last=Burns|first=Carole|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2 November 2015|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref> However, the two works differ notably in how they end: in the novel, Eilis leaves Ireland, but her destination and ultimately her fate is left for the reader to decide, while the film ends with Eilis having a poignant reunion with Tony in Brooklyn. In T\u00f3ib\u00edn's later novel, [[''Nora Webster'']], set in the 1960's, the author offers a glimpse of Eilis's later life during a conversation between that story's main charachter, and Eilis's mother.  Both the book and film have been praised for their refreshing perspective on the plight of the Irish immigrant.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Principal photography===\n[[Principal photography]] began on 1 April 2014 in Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rosser|first=Michael|title=Brooklyn begins shoot with Saoirse Ronan|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/brooklyn-begins-shoot-with-saoirse-ronan/5070238.article?blocktitle=HEADLINES&contentID=40295|access-date=2 April 2014|newspaper=screendaily.com|date=1 April 2014}}</ref> The three weeks of filming in the country took place at locations in [[Enniscorthy]], [[Wexford]], and [[Dublin]].<ref name=variety-filming>{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title=Saoirse Ronan Heads to Ireland for John Crowley's 'Brooklyn'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/saoirse-ronan-heads-to-ireland-for-john-crowleys-brooklyn-1201151073/|access-date=2 April 2014|newspaper=variety.com|date=1 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kemp|first=Stuart|title=Saoirse Ronan to Star in 'Brooklyn'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/saoirse-ronan-star-brooklyn-692518|access-date=2 April 2014|newspaper=hollywoodreporter.com|date=1 April 2014}}</ref> On the first day of shooting, Ronan was spotted in period costume on the set in Enniscorthy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Blake Knox|first=Kirsty|title=Saoirse Ronan keeps warm with water bottle on movie set|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/saoirse-ronan-keeps-warm-with-water-bottle-on-movie-set-30143178.html|access-date=2 April 2014|newspaper=independent.ie|date=1 April 2014}}</ref> Production then moved to Montreal, Quebec, for four more weeks of filming.<ref name=\"variety-filming\"/> Two days were spent shooting in Brooklyn, one day of which was spent at the beach in [[Coney Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/2015/11/08/interview-director-john-crowley/|title=Interview : Director John Crowley|work=AwardsDaily|first=Jazz|last=Tangcay|date=8 November 2015|access-date=28 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{Further|Music of Brooklyn (film)}}\n\n==Release==\n''Brooklyn'' premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]] on 26 January 2015, after which a bidding war began between [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], [[Focus Features]], and [[The Weinstein Company]].
