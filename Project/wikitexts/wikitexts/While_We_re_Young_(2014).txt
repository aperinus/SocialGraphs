The film stars [[Ben Stiller]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Adam Driver]], and [[Amanda Seyfried]]; its plot centers on a [[New York City|New York]]-based [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[filmmaking|filmmaker]] and his wife, a couple in their 40s, who develop a friendship with a couple in their 20s. The film was screened in the Special Presentations section of the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"Indiewire\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/tiff-toronto-intl-film-festival-gala-special-presentations-1201266480/|title=Toronto Film Festival Lineup|work=Variety|date=July 22, 2014 |access-date=22 July 2014}}</ref> and [[A24]] released it in the United States on March 27, 2015. The film went on to gross more than any of Baumbach's previous films at the US box office.\n\n==Plot==\nMiddle-aged couple Josh and Cornelia Srebnick are filmmakers living in a shaky marriage in New York City. Josh has spent the last 10 years struggling on the post-production of his documentary film about leftist intellectual Ira Mandelstam while not letting his producer wife help him with the project.\n\nAfter finishing a lecture at the college where he teaches, Josh is approached by Jamie and Darby Massey, a young couple who invite him and Cornelia out to dinner. Jamie claims to be a fan of Josh's work and the works of his accomplished documentary filmmaker father-in-law, Leslie Breitbart. Josh is immediately awestruck by Jamie and Darby's non-conservative outlook on life as he and Cornelia begin spending more and more time with them, joining in on their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle.\n\nAn aspiring filmmaker himself, Jamie talks with Josh about their projects, including Josh's own documentary. This inspires Jamie to make a film about connecting with an old high school friend that he found on [[Facebook]]. Jamie and Darby invite Josh and Cornelia to an [[ayahuasca]] ceremony where a hallucinating Cornelia kisses Jamie while Jamie receives Josh's approval in helping with the production of his film. Cornelia agrees to produce the film. Jamie and Josh find the old friend, Kent Arlington, who is in the hospital after a suicide attempt. Josh and Jamie discover that Kent was involved in a civilian massacre during an Army tour in Afghanistan, creating an even bigger story for Jamie's film.\n\nWhile pitching his own film, Josh is dismayed when he cannot engage a potential [[hedge fund]] investor with the concept of his intellectual documentary. He goes to Leslie for a second opinion. When Leslie's criticisms and suggestions are brought down by Josh, they get into an argument over Josh and Cornelia's inability to have children, as well as Josh calling himself a disappointment to him.\n\nJosh attends a party for a screening of Jamie's film, which is met far more positively by Leslie and the hedge fund investor. A jealous Josh argues with Cornelia over Jamie's success, and they separate. Josh meets up with Darby, who is sick of Jamie's increasingly self-centered attitude and tells him about Cornelia kissing Jamie. Josh confronts Cornelia the next morning and denounces Jamie.\n\nWhile teaming up with his editor on cutting his film, Josh comes across footage for Jamie's film, finding evidence that suggests the meeting with Kent was actually staged. Finding him, Kent reveals that he was really friends with Darby, not Jamie, and that he was contacted by Jamie weeks before their shoot. Capturing his confession on camera, Josh goes to Jamie and Darby to confront him only to discover that a fed-up Darby is moving out and that Jamie is at the tribute celebrating Leslie at [[Jazz at Lincoln Center|Lincoln Center]].\n\nJosh confronts Jamie in private at the event, admonishing him for compromising the truth and genuineness of his story for dramatic purposes. Josh forces Jamie to admit the truth to Leslie, who excuses it, saying that it's a good story regardless of the fabrication. Defeated, Josh admits to Leslie he was right about the edits needed on his film. Outside, Josh and Cornelia reconcile.\n\nOne year later, Josh and Cornelia drive to the airport for a flight to [[Port-au-Prince]], Haiti where they will adopt a newborn baby. Josh finds an article in a magazine lauding Jamie as a filmmaking genius, which Cornelia and Josh pass off by admitting, \"He's not evil, he's just young.\" They then watch a young child at the gate playing with an [[iPhone]], studying him as if to imply that yet another generation with disparate ethics and morals is approaching.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Josh Srebnick\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Cornelia Srebnick (n\u00e9e Breitbart) \n* [[Adam Driver]] as Jamie Massey\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Darby Massey\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Leslie Breitbart\n* [[Ad-Rock|Adam Horovitz]] as Fletcher\n* [[Maria Dizzia]] as Marina\n* [[Dree Hemingway]] as Tipper\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as Kent Arlington\n* [[Matthew Maher (actor)|Matthew Maher]] as Tim\n* [[Ryan Serhant]] as Hedge Fund Dave\n* [[Peter Yarrow]] as Ira Mandelstam\n* [[Matthew Shear]] as Benny\n* [[James Saito]] as Dr. Nagato\n}}\n\n[[Peter Bogdanovich]] appears as an MC at an event celebrating Leslie Breitbart, and [[Greta Lee]] voices a [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] interviewer.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was spotted shooting on September 17, 2013 in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news|date=September 18, 2013|title='While We're Young', starring Ben Stiller, filming in NYC|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2013/09/18/while-were-young-starring-ben-stiller-filming-in-nyc/|website=onlocationvacations.com|access-date=19 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]].<ref>{{cite news|title=LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy Scoring Noah Baumbach's 'While We're Young'|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/07/22/lcd-soundsystems-james-murphy-scoring-noah-baumbachs-while-were-young/|access-date=August 1, 2014|publisher=filmmusicreporter.com|date=July 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\n# \"Golden Years\" \u2013 [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]]\n# \"Concerto for Lute, 2 Violins and Continuo in D, RV. 93\" \u2013 [[Antonio Vivaldi]]\n# \"[[All Night Long (All Night)]]\"\u2013 [[Lionel Richie]]\n# \"Buggin' Out\" \u2013 [[A Tribe Called Quest]]\n# \"[[The Ghost in You]]\" \u2013 [[The Psychedelic Furs]]\n# \"The Inch Worm\" \u2013 [[Danny Kaye]]\n# \"Only the Stars Above Welcome Me Home\" \u2013 [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]]\n# \"[[Falling (Haim song)|Falling (Duke Dumont Remix)]]\" \u2013 [[Haim (band)|Haim]]\n# \"[[Eye of the Tiger]]\" \u2013 [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]]\n# \"Andante du Concerto Pour Flautino en ut Majeur\" (from the MGM film ''The Wild Child'') \u2013 [[Antonio Vivaldi]]\n# \"[[Waiting for a Girl Like You]]\" \u2013 [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]\n# \"[[Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five]]\" \u2013 [[Wings|Paul McCartney & Wings]]\n# \"We Used to Dance\" \u2013 [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]]\n# \"[[Golden Years (David Bowie song)|Golden Years]]\" \u2013 [[David Bowie]]\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/were-young-toronto-review-730802|title='While We're Young': Toronto Review|author=Todd McCarthy|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 6, 2014 |access-date=November 29, 2014}}</ref> Shortly after, [[A24]] acquired distribution rights to the film for $4 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2014/09/toronto-a24-4-million-deal-while-were-young-831421/|title=Toronto: A24 In $4 Million U.S. Deal For Noah Baumbach's 'While We're Young'|publisher=Deadline.com|first=Mike Jr.|last=Fleming|date=September 8, 2014|access-date=January 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in [[limited release]] on March 27, 2015 and earned $227,688, ranking number 24 in the box office that weekend.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2015&wknd=13&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for March 27-29, 2015 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=March 30, 2015 | access-date=May 20, 2015}}</ref> On April 17, the film was given a [[wide release]] and grossed $1,438,384, ranking number 12.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2015&wknd=16&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for April 17-19, 2015 | work=Box Office Mojo | publisher=Internet Movie Database | date=April 20, 2015 | access-date=May 20, 2015}}</ref> The film eventually grossed $7,587,485 domestically, more than all of Baumbach's previous films in the United States box office.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 84%, based on 205 reviews, with an average rating of 7.32/10.
