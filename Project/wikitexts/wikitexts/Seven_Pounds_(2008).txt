Wikipedia policy is to assume that a reader reading a plot wants to know the correct details. -->In Los Angeles, Ben Thomas berates a sales representative, Ezra Turner, over the phone. Ezra, who is blind, maintains his composure and politely ends the call. At an [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] office after hours, Ben researches Emily Posa, finding that she is being treated for a [[congenital heart defect]]. His brother calls, but he denies having taken something from his house.\n\nAt an elderly [[care home]], Ben introduces himself as an IRS agent. Administrator Stewart Goodman brags about cutting costs despite buying himself a new [[BMW Z4|BMW]]. Having paid for an unsuccessful [[bone marrow]] transplant, Stewart asks for an extension from the IRS until he can receive a bonus. Ben asks a resident named Inez if Stewart is a \"good man\", and she reveals that he is punishing her by refusing to bathe her. Ben takes Inez to the washroom himself, angrily denying Stewart\u2019s request for an extension.\n\nBen tells Emily she is being [[audit]]ed, surprises her at home to assist with her debts, and they begin to bond. He moves into a motel room, where he keeps a deadly [[box jellyfish]].\n\nBen asks Holly, a [[child and family services]] worker, for someone he can help. She directs him to Connie Tepos, a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic immigrant]] trapped in an abusive relationship. Ben visits Connie and urges her to take action, leaving his business card. He donates a kidney to George, a junior hockey coach who arranged partial scholarships for some of his players to attend college.\n\nWhen Emily is taken back to the hospital, Ben comforts her with a story about a boy named Tim and his little brother, and spends the night at her bedside. Beaten by her boyfriend, Connie calls Ben, who gives her the deed to his own house, providing her and her children with a safe home.\n\nEmily is placed on the priority list for a heart transplant, and Ben takes her home. He initially rejects her attempts to become closer, but later apologizes, and she shows him her [[letterpress printing]] workshop. At the hospital, Ben donates bone marrow to help treat Nicholas, a young patient. Emily invites Ben over; after a romantic evening, he shows her he repaired her [[Original Heidelberg Platen Press|antique printing press]], and they kiss. Ben\u2019s brother arrives, revealing he is the real IRS agent Ben Thomas; \u201cBen\u201d is actually Tim, who stole his brother\u2019s identity temporarily. Tim starts to leave, but spends the night with Emily.\n\nAfter Emily falls asleep, Tim goes to the hospital, where her doctor explains that her rare [[blood type]] makes finding a viable [[organ donation|donor organ]] almost impossible. Tim calls his lifelong friend Dan Morris, who has promised to execute Tim's will, and announces, \u201cIt\u2019s time\u201d. Returning to his motel room, Tim calls Ezra, to apologize and explain that his previous rude call was to ensure Ezra was a decent person, and Dan will contact him with a \u201cgift\u201d. He then calls [[9-1-1]] to report his impending suicide.\n\nIt is revealed that Tim, once a successful [[aeronautics|aeronautical]] engineer, [[texting while driving|texted while driving]] and collided with a van, killing all six occupants and his fianc\u00e9e. Submerged in a bathtub of ice water, Tim allows himself to be stung to death by the jellyfish. His carefully-planned suicide preserves his organs.\n\nHaunted by the deaths of these seven people, Tim was able to save the lives of six others with his organs: Ben required a [[lung transplant#types of lung transplant|lobe transplant]], Holly receives part of his liver, George a kidney, Nicholas got bone marrow, Emily receives his heart, and Ezra receives his eyes. The seventh, Connie, received Tim's home allowing her and her children to escape an abusive relationship. Emily meets Ezra, who is now a music teacher and has Tim's eyes. Ezra realizes who she is from the heart surgery scar, and they embrace.\n\n==Production==\n''Seven Pounds'' is based on a script written by [[Grant Nieporte]] under [[Columbia Pictures]].

You don't ever get it really the way you want in life. That really fascinates me. As an actor, there are certain parts of a character that you create, and you train yourself to have those reactions and then it becomes hard to stop them when the role is over. You have to retrain yourself. My character in this film is like [[grits|hot grits]].

The character was a contrast to Smith's previous characters, and Smith felt that director Gabriele Muccino's trust in him helped him relax and avoid overextending himself. Smith acknowledged ''Seven Pounds'' as a drama film, but he saw it as more of a love story.<ref>{{cite news | last = Topel | first = Fred | title = Will Smith discusses Seven Pounds | work = CraveOnline.com | publisher=CraveOnline Media, LLC | date = December 15, 2008 | url = http://www.craveonline.com/articles/filmtv/04652507/will_smith_discusses_seven_pounds.html | access-date = December 19, 2008}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Ealy]] as Ben Thomas, Tim's brother\n:Will Smith handpicked Ealy for the role of the main character's brother.<ref name=rolls>{{cite news | first=Borys | last=Kit |author2=Leslie Simmons | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ealy-rolls-seven-col-103995 | title=Ealy rolls 'Seven' for Col | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=February 4, 2008 | access-date=July 7, 2008 }}</ref> [[Connor Cruise]], the adopted son of actor [[Tom Cruise]] and actress [[Nicole Kidman]], was cast in his first role as a younger version of Ben Thomas.<ref>{{cite news | first=Elizabeth | last=Leonard |author2=Alexis Chiu | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20193895,00.html | title=Connor Cruise Is Making His Big Screen Debut | work=[[People (magazine)|People]] | date=April 22, 2008 | access-date=July 7, 2008 }}</ref>\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as Dan Morris\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Emily Posa\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Kate, Emily's nurse\n* [[Tim Kelleher (actor)|Tim Kelleher]] as Stewart Goodman\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Ezra Turner\n* [[Elpidia Carrillo]] as Connie Tepos\n* [[Judyann Elder]] as Holly\n* [[Bill Smitrovich]] as George\n* Quintin Kelly as Nicholas\n* [[Robinne Lee]] as Sarah Jenson, Tim's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Madison Pettis]] as Connie's daughter\n* Ivan Angulo as Connie's son\n* [[Skylan Brooks]] as Choir kid\n* Bryce J Harris as a toddler in the social service office\n* Bradly J Harris as a toddler in the social service office\n* Weston Harris as a child in the social service office\n}}\n\n=== Title ===\nBefore the film's release, the title ''Seven Pounds'' was considered a \"mystery\" which the studio refused to explain.
