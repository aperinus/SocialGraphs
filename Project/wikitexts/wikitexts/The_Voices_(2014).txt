Jerry has [[schizophrenia]], but chooses not to take his medication and enjoys delusions and hallucinations that manifest in the form of his pets talking to him. Bosco often represents his good intentions, while Mr. Whiskers represents his more violent nature. Jerry has a crush on his coworker Fiona, and asks her out on a date at a local Chinese [[dinner theater]] called Shi Shen. She agrees to go, but stands him up to go to a karaoke party with two other women from work, Lisa and Alison. Fiona's car doesn't start, leading her to flag down Jerry as he drives by. While driving her home, Jerry accidentally hits a deer, which crashes through his windshield. Jerry's hallucinations show the deer begging him to put it out of its misery. Jerry does as told, using a hunting knife to cut its throat. Terrified, Fiona runs off into the woods. Jerry chases her, still carrying the knife, and tries to explain, but ends up tripping over Fiona, and accidentally stabbing her. Jerry tearfully apologizes for hurting her and says that he loves her. To end her pain, Jerry stabs her again, and she dies.\n\nUpon returning home, Bosco suggests he go to the police and confess, while Mr. Whiskers says there is no shame in what he did, but insists Jerry needs to dispose of the body. Jerry collects Fiona's body but leaves a bloody shoe and pile of organs. He dismembers Fiona, packing her innards in numerous [[Tupperware]] containers and placing her severed head inside his fridge. As his delusions increase in intensity, Fiona's head comes to life and starts talking to him. Jerry attempts to apologize once again, but she rejects his apology, citing the good life she had before she died. Fiona then demands Jerry take his medication. Jerry takes his pills, and the next day, he experiences nightmares of his emotionally abusive father. When he wakes up his hallucinations have ended; his pets no longer speak to him, his apartment is a mess, with animal waste and garbage littering his living room, and blood stains all over his kitchen. Fiona's head no longer speaks and has become foul and rotting. He throws away the pills in terror, and the next morning, his hallucinations return and his life is back to 'normal'. Fiona tries to convince Jerry to kill another person \"so she has a friend\".\n\nJerry asks Lisa on a date. He takes her to his abandoned childhood home, where it is revealed his mother was mentally ill and was about to be institutionalized. When the authorities arrived, she decided to commit suicide by trying to slit her throat, but couldn't do it herself and so she begged Jerry to finish the job to end her suffering. The police found Jerry standing over his dead mother, and he was committed instead. Jerry sobs in front of Lisa, who comforts him. He leaves the knife he had intended to use to kill Lisa at his old house and they go to her place to spend the night together.\n\nThe next day, wanting to surprise Jerry, Lisa goes to his house. She discovers the state of the apartment, including all the containers of organs and blood stains, becoming hysterical when she discovers Fiona\u2019s disembodied head on the coffee table. Despite pressure from Mr. Whiskers, Jerry refuses to kill her. Jerry tries to explain, but Lisa flees and locks herself in the bathroom. When Jerry breaks in, Lisa starts hitting him with a towel hanger and runs to his room. Jerry tries to calm her with an apology, which she seems to accept. When she tries to escape, Jerry throws her back into the room, accidentally breaking her neck, leaving her paralyzed and slowly dying. After she dies, Jerry dismembers her, placing her head in the fridge next to Fiona\u2019s. The other workers realize both have gone missing. When Alison goes to Jerry's house to investigate, Jerry kills her, taking her head as well.\n\nJerry confesses his killings to his counselor Dr. Warren. She tries to call the police, but he takes her hostage and flees into the countryside, desperately wanting her to help him. She calms him down and shows understanding, seeming to make some progress with Jerry. Meanwhile, two other workers from accounting break into Jerry's home, letting Bosco escape through the front door, and immediately call the police. Shortly after Jerry returns home, still holding Warren hostage, the police surround his house and prepare to move in. Jerry flees down into the bowling alley, accidentally breaking a gas pipe while doing so. After rescuing Dr. Warren, the police are knocked back from an explosion caused by the gas leak.\n\nJerry realizes the bowling alley is on fire and he is in grave danger. The voices of Bosco and Mr. Whiskers speak to him in his own mind. Mr. Whiskers insists that he get out of there and find another place to live, to hide, so that he may continue killing and feeling alive. However, Bosco tells him that there is no place for him in life any longer and that he should let the fire \"put him to sleep\". Choosing to stay and end his own misery, he lies down and waits until he blacks out and eventually dies from the smoke inhalation.\n\nIn a white void, Bosco and Mr. Whiskers confess that, despite their opposing beliefs, they did like each other, before going their separate ways. Jerry then appears with his parents, Fiona, Lisa and Alison, and he apologizes to the women for killing them. [[Jesus]] appears, and they all dance and sing together. In the end, Jesus raises Jerry in a forklift.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Jerry Hickfang and the voices of Bosco, Mr. Whiskers, The Deer and Bunny Monkey\n** [[Gulliver McGrath]] as young Jerry\n* [[Gemma Arterton]] as Fiona \n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Lisa\n* [[Jacki Weaver]] as Dr. Warren\n* [[Ella Smith (actress)|Ella Smith]] as Alison\n* [[Paul Chahidi]] as Dennis Kowalski\n* [[Stanley Townsend]] as Sheriff Weinbacher\n* [[Adi Shankar]] as John\n* [[Sam Spruell]] as Dave\n* Valerie Koch as Jerry's mother\n* [[Paul Brightwell]] as Jerry's stepfather\n* Alessa Kordeck as Sheryl\n* [[:de:Michael Pink|Michael Pink]] as Jesus\n* Stephanie Vogt as Tina TV\n}}\n\n==Production==\nBefore initial production, the script for ''The Voices'' received critical praise, including being listed on The Black List's Best UN-produced Screenplays of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-black-list-2009-the-years-best-unproduced-screenplays/|title=The Black List 2009 The Years Best UN-produced Screenplays|last=Fischer|first=Russ|date=December 11, 2009|website=[[/Film]]|access-date=April 11, 2018}}</ref> The film originally had [[Mark Romanek]] attached to direct in 2010, with [[Ben Stiller]] attached to star, but was never made due to budget issues.
