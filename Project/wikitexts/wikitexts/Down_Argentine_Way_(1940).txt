It made a star of [[Betty Grable]] in her first leading role for the studio although she had already appeared in 31 films,<ref>Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub. Hal Leonard Corporation {{ISBN|0-634-00765-3}} p. 97</ref> and it introduced American audiences to [[Carmen Miranda]]. It also starred [[Don Ameche]], [[Nicholas Brothers|The Nicholas Brothers]], [[Charlotte Greenwood]], and [[J. Carrol Naish]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Irving Cummings]] and produced by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] from a [[screenplay]] by [[Karl Tunberg]] and Darrell Ware, based on a story by Rian James and Ralph Spence. The cinematography was by [[Leon Shamroy]] and [[Ray Rennahan]], and the costume design was by [[Travis Banton]]. The American-composed music was by [[Harry Warren]] and [[Jimmy McHugh]], with lyrics by [[Mack Gordon]] and [[Al Dubin]].\n\nShooting lasted for 10 months in which members of the film's crew traveled about 35,000 miles. A second unit was sent to [[Buenos Aires]] for location establishing shots, returning with about 20,000 feet of film, and another group flew to [[New York City]] and filmed Miranda for over a month. Miranda was then performing [[South America]]n songs in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production ''[[The Streets of Paris]]''. She was thus a prominent participant in the film although she spent no time in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19401117&id=9WAsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6soEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6609,1488217&hl=pt-BR|title=Location Outfits Covered 35,000 Miles In Filming 'Argentine Way'|date=November 17, 1940|page=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal|Herald-Journal]]|access-date=June 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, ''Down Argentine Way'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\"loc.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-14-210/new-films-added-to-national-registry/2014-12-17/|title=Cinematic Treasures Named to National Film Registry|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-06-08|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nThe film begins with [[Carmen Miranda]] singing ''South American Way,'' followed by a montage of the Argentine capital [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nYoung Ricardo Quintana ([[Don Ameche]]) is preparing to voyage from [[Argentina]] to [[New York (state)|New York]] to sell some of his father's prize horses. Before leaving, Don Diego Quintana ([[Henry Stephenson]]) instructs his son that no steeds are to be sold to Binnie Crawford ([[Charlotte Greenwood]]) or any member of her family because her brother Willis cheated him years earlier. Upon arriving in New York and displaying his horses at a racetrack, Ricardo falls in love with Glenda Crawford ([[Betty Grable]]), and goes to dinner with her later that evening. When he learns that she is Binnie's niece, he refuses to sell her the horse she wants to buy, instead selling it to her best friend Helen ([[Kay Aldridge]]). He hurriedly returns to Argentina, while Glenda, perturbed by his sudden change, follows him, accompanied by her Aunt.\n\nThe couple meet again in Argentina at a performance by Carmen Miranda, where they eventually confess their love for each other. When Binnie attempts to buy horses from Don Diego in person, he has her and her tour guide, Tito ([[Leonid Kinskey]]), evicted from his property. Ricardo subsequently introduces Glenda to his father as Miss Cunningham. When Ricardo realizes that their horse trainer Casiano has been privately racing his father's prize jumper, Furioso, Glenda encourages Ricardo to enter Furioso in a race, against Don Diego's wishes. Soon after, while attending a horse show, Don Diego discovers Glenda's true identity and disowns his son for becoming involved with Crawfords. His bad mood is compounded when Furioso refuses to jump and runs off the field.\n\nTo make up for the humiliating defeat, Ricardo, Glenda and Casiano enter Furioso in the big race at [[San Isidro, Buenos Aires|San Isidro]]. When Don Diego finds out he is furious, but Casiano changes his mind when he tells him Furioso ran the mile in 1:36. As Don Diego prepares to bet a large amount of money on his horse, Tito meanwhile, switches jockeys and has the race fixed so Furioso will lose, causing Binnie to discharge him. When Furioso overcomes the crooked jockey and wins the race, Don Diego changes his mind about racing horses and accepts his son's relationship with Glenda.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/4656|title=American Film Institute Catalog: Down Argentine Way|page=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|access-date=October 9, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Don Ameche]] as Ricardo Quintana\n* [[Betty Grable]] as Glenda Crawford\n* [[Carmen Miranda]] as Herself\n* [[Charlotte Greenwood]] as Binnie Crawford\n* [[J.

''Down Argentine Way'' is considered the first of many Fox films made to implement industry-wide approach to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s \"[[Good Neighbor Policy]]\" toward Latin America. During [[World War II]], the U.S. government developed an administrative agency to encourage good relations with Latin America, as there was growing German influence there. The [[Office of Inter-American Affairs]] was established to promote this. It specifically encouraged the production of \"Good Neighbor\" films.\n\nProduction of ''Down Argentine Way'' preceded the establishment of the Office of Inter-American Affairs, but was likely influenced by Roosevelt administration policy. The film was a box-office success, earning $2 million in domestic rentals in 1940. Fox continued to support government policy and its own self-interest by making films such as ''[[That Night in Rio]]'' and ''[[Week-End in Havana]]'' (both 1941). The films were a success in the United States, but failed as propaganda aimed at Latin America because they lacked regional authenticity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ceart.udesc.br/dapesquisa/files/01CENICAS_Karitha_Bernardo_de_Macedo.pdf|title=Brazilian cinema, Hollywood and the Good Neighbourhood Policy in the 1930s: a background for Carmen Miranda|work=K\u00e1ritha Bernardo de Macedo|access-date=November 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA big star in her adopted country of [[Brazil]], [[Carmen Miranda]] was a singer and dancer known for sex appeal. She signed a film contract with Fox in 1940 while she was appearing at a New York club, and ''Down Argentine Way'' was her first appearance in an American film. Since Miranda could not break her nightclub contract, her numbers for this film were shot in New York, while all other actors were working with director [[Irving Cummings]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Fox, with its revue approach to musicals, cut and pasted Miranda into the film. Miranda made several more films for [[20th Century Fox]], but the studio never was able to take advantage of the Brazilian star's special qualities to fit with American productions.<ref name=\"lev\"/>\n\nThe film made [[Betty Grable]],<ref name=\"lev\">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHR6ma7XKBsC&q=down%20argentine%20way&pg=PA89|title=Twentieth Century-Fox: The Zanuck-Skouras Years, 1935\u20131965|work=Peter Lev|isbn=9780292744493|access-date=October 14, 2014|last1=Lev|first1=Peter|date=15 March 2013}}</ref> and began the period of her highest profile. Grable was cast in the film as a replacement for [[Alice Faye]], who was originally intended for the female lead but became ill. Faye appeared in the follow-up films ''That Night in Rio'' and ''Week-End in Havana'', which again feature Carmen Miranda.\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that J. Carroll Naish's success in a comedy role in this film prompted Fox to feature him again in ''That Night in Rio''. More recent sources, such as film historian W. Lee Cozad, cited the inclusion of actress [[Elena Verdugo]] (at age 14) among the cast in a bit part and note that this may have been her first film.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq2IW_Ghso4C&dq=Elena+Verdugo+Down+Argentine+Way&pg=PA167|title=More Magnificent Mountain Movies|publisher=W.

We even see her trying to act, which is something less of a pleasure.\" But then, after referring to the film's play for profits and part in \"Good Neighbor Policy\", he backtracks: \"But, hold \u2013 what sort of good neighbor would make a remark like that!
