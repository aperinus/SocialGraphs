J. Quinnell]]. The novel had [[Man on Fire (1987 film)|previously been adapted into a feature film]] in 1987. In this film, [[Denzel Washington]] portrays John Creasy, a despondent, alcoholic former [[CIA]] [[Special Activities Center|SAD/SOG]] officer (and [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]) turned bodyguard, who goes on a revenge rampage after his charge, nine-year-old Lupita \"Pita\" Ramos ([[Dakota Fanning]]), is abducted in [[Mexico City]]. The supporting cast includes [[Christopher Walken]], [[Radha Mitchell]], [[Giancarlo Giannini]], [[Marc Anthony]], [[Rachel Ticotin]] and [[Mickey Rourke]].\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. It grossed $130 million worldwide against a production budget of $60\u201370&nbsp;million.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[CIA]] [[Special Activities Division|SAD/SOG]] officer John W. Creasy visits his old friend Paul Rayburn in Mexico. Rayburn convinces him to take a bodyguard position with Samuel Ramos, a Mexico City automaker whose young daughter Lupita \"Pita\" requires a bodyguard for her kidnapping insurance policy to take effect. Struggling with alcoholism, burnout, and guilt over his actions with the CIA, Creasy tries to commit suicide but the bullet in his gun misfires. While coaching Pita to become a more confident swimmer, he bonds with her.\n\nWaiting outside Pita\u2019s piano lesson, Creasy recognizes a car that followed them earlier, as two [[Federal Judicial Police|Federal Police]] officers block the street. Realizing that Pita is about to be abducted, Creasy kills four of the attackers including the officers but is critically wounded and Pita is taken. Recovering from his injuries, Creasy is declared a suspect, but reporter Mariana Garcia Guerrero questions the story. [[Federal Ministerial Police|AFI]] agent Miguel Manzano relocates Creasy to a veterinary clinic to protect him from corrupt police.\n\n\"The Voice,\" leader of the kidnapping ring, demands a $10 million ransom and Samuel complies, with the help of police Lt. Victor Fuentes. However, the kidnappers are ambushed at the ransom drop and the Voice\u2019s nephew is killed. Holding the Ramoses responsible, the Voice informs them that Pita will be lost to them forever as retribution. Guerrero warns Creasy that the kidnappers belong to a powerful \u201cbrotherhood\u201d called La Hermandad that consists of corrupt officials, police, and criminals, but Creasy promises Pita\u2019s mother, Lisa, that he will kill everyone responsible for Pita's death.\n\nWith Rayburn\u2019s help, Creasy obtains a small arsenal of weapons and equipment. He brutally interrogates and kills the getaway driver, who points him to a club where he confronts three of the kidnappers. Killing middleman \"Jersey Boy\" and another criminal, Creasy recovers an incriminating ATM card and another kidnapped girl. He turns both over to Guerrero, who reveals that Fuentes is part of the brotherhood. Manzano interviews Rayburn, who describes Creasy as an \u201cartist of death.\u201d\n\nGuerrero convinces Manzano to help Creasy wage war against the kidnappers. Waylaying Fuentes\u2019 motorcade with a [[rocket-propelled grenade]], Creasy abducts the officer, who admits that he had his officers ambush the ransom drop, but discovered afterward most of the ransom money had already been stolen by Jordan Kalfus, Samuel's lawyer. After killing Fuentes with a bomb in his rectum, Creasy searches Kalfus\u2019 home and finds his decapitated body and a fax with bank account information leading to Samuel.\n\nCreasy confronts the Ramoses, and Samuel confesses that Kalfus suggested they arrange Pita\u2019s kidnapping to claim the insurance payout to pay his father's debts, though they were promised Pita would be unharmed. When Fuentes interfered with the drop, Samuel blamed Kalfus for Pita's death and killed him. Lisa, unaware of Samuel's involvement, angrily tells Creasy to kill her husband or she\u2019ll do it herself; he leaves Samuel a gun and the bullet he attempted suicide with, and a remorseful Samuel shoots himself.\n\nGuerrero and Manzano trace the ATM card to the Voice\u2019s wife and find her address, allowing Manzano's officers to infiltrate her home and obtain a photo of the Voice. Despite the brotherhood\u2019s threats, Guerrero publishes the photo and passes the address on to Creasy. Taking the Voice\u2019s wife and his brother Aurelio prisoner, Creasy is shot in the chest but learns the ringleader\u2019s real name is Daniel Sanchez. He calls Daniel and threatens his family, but Daniel reveals that Pita is alive, offering to trade her for his brother and for Creasy, which Creasy accepts.\n\nInstructing Lisa to join him at the exchange, Creasy reunites with Pita in the middle of an overpass, assuring her that he loves her before sending her to her mother. He and Aurelio are taken by Daniel\u2019s men, but Creasy succumbs to his wounds. Manzano tracks Daniel down later that day and shoots him dead \u201cduring the course of arrest.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as John W.
