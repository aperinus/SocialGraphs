While she is implementing new, more stringent rules for visa applications of potential terrorist suspects, most of her team are killed while at a restaurant for the birthday of their superior, Bill Talbot ([[Robert Forster]]). Bill is Johnny's father, and is being blackmailed under threat of Johnny's death. He delayed attending the party to \nreturn to his desk to delete records of the visas he has approved for terrorists entering the United States. Kate survives the bombing when she leaves the restaurant to get a last-minute present for Bill.\n\nAn investigation into the attack reveals that the bomb has traces of [[chromium]], leading her superior at the embassy, Sam Parker ([[Dylan McDermott]]), to deduce that the perpetrator was the 'Watchmaker' ([[Pierce Brosnan]]), one of the world's most wanted killers, known for his precision work, who detonated a bomb with similar traces in Paris two years earlier. Nobody knows the Watchmaker's appearance, as he has had lots of plastic surgery over the years. Kate's subsequent attempts to find out the cause of the explosion reveal that Bill was being blackmailed to let certain visa applicants through after Johnny's capture, and the man behind the attack was indeed the Watchmaker. Her efforts uncover a plan to detonate another bomb at [[Times Square]] in New York City during the New Year's Eve celebrations.\n\nAs she carries out her own investigation, she is attacked by Bill, unintentionally killing him in self-defense. Kate is later considered, through witnesses and footage, the prime suspect for the attacks at the embassy.\n\nSam Parker, who believes in her innocence, is injured in an attack by the Watchmaker. \n \nKate is forced to sneak back into the embassy to create false passports for herself to follow the Watchmaker to New York, with continuing support from Sam and her friend Sally ([[Frances de la Tour]]), the only two people who still believe in her innocence.\n\nMeanwhile, the Watchmaker uses a [[Steyr HS .50]] cal sniper rifle to fire an [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary round]] into a sphere filled with explosive gas atop a vacant block of apartments in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The building is devastated. Later, the Watchmaker reveals that he is aware that his client's purpose for the Times Square attack is not terrorism but financial. He intends to bet against the stock market and make millions when the stock market reopens. The Watchmaker demands half the profits, threatening to cancel the attack, and the client agrees.\n\nThe Watchmaker leaves for New York. Dr Emil Balan ([[Roger Rees]]), is motivated to avenge his late wife's death when her visa to the U.S. was delayed and she didn't receive emergency medical treatment in time. In New York, he coordinates filling the New Year's Eve ball with explosive gas. The Watchmaker's job is to shoot the sphere and ignite the gas. Balan meets the Watchmaker on top of a high rise a few blocks from Times Square. The Watchmaker kills Balan, removing any connection back to him. Kate deduces the plot and finds the Watchmaker, moments away from triggering the bomb. After a struggle, she manages to throw the Watchmaker off the side of the building. He falls to his death on the stroke of midnight.\n\nHer suspicion about Balan's guilt is vindicated and her name is cleared. She receives a call from Sam, who has recovered from recent injuries, congratulating her.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Katherine \"Kate\" Abbott, a [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] officer at the US Embassy in London.\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Nash, a notorious assassin, known as the Watchmaker.\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Maureen Crane, the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom]].\n* [[Dylan McDermott]] as Sam Parker, Abbott's superior at the US Embassy in London.\n* [[Frances de la Tour]] as Sally, the analyst of the US Embassy in London.\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Bill Talbot, a senior [[United States Foreign Service]] officer at the US Embassy in London.\n* [[Roger Rees]] as Dr. Emil Balan, a scientist specialising in combustible gases.
