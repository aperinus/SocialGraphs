Little]], written by [[Alan B. McElroy]], and starring [[Donald Pleasence]], [[Ellie Cornell]], [[Danielle Harris]] in her film debut.\n\nAs its title suggests, the film attempted to bring back Michael Myers after his absence in ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' (1982). Initially, [[John Carpenter]] and co-producer [[Debra Hill]] intended to create an [[anthology]] series, with only the first two films being connected. ''Halloween 4'' was originally intended to be a ghost story, but after the poor reception of ''Halloween III,'' the idea was abandoned. \n\nReleased in the United States on October 21, 1988, ''Halloween 4'' grossed $17.8 million domestically on a budget of $5 million, and received mostly negative reviews from critics. However, the film, much like the series in general, has developed a strong [[cult following]] since its release. The film begins the \"Thorn Trilogy\" story arc which would be continued in ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' (1989) and ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' (1995).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-09-24|title=Every Halloween Movie Ranked, According to Critics|url=https://www.cbr.com/every-halloween-movie-ranked-critics/2/|access-date=2020-12-28|website=CBR|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|last=Lea|first=Robert|date=2018-10-28|title=Halloween: A franchise that won't die but will forget|url=https://medium.com/@roblea_63049/halloween-a-franchise-that-wont-die-but-will-forget-db6e1fc38b2f|access-date=2020-12-28|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 30, 1988, Michael Myers, who has been comatose for ten years [[Halloween II (1981 film)|since the explosion at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital]], is transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium by ambulance from his current residence in the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium. Upon hearing that he has a niece, Michael awakens and kills the ambulance personnel, causing the vehicle to crash into a river. Michael escapes and makes his way to Haddonfield. Michael's former psychiatrist, [[Samuel Loomis]], learns of Michael's escape and gives chase. He follows Michael to a gas station and eatery, where Michael has killed a mechanic for his clothes, along with a female clerk. Michael escapes in a tow truck and causes the gas pumps to explode in the process, destroying Loomis's car and disabling the phone lines. Loomis catches a ride to Haddonfield to continue pursuing Michael.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Jamie Lloyd]], [[Laurie Strode]]'s daughter and Michael's niece, is living in Haddonfield with her foster family, Richard and Darlene Carruthers, and their teenage daughter, [[Rachel Carruthers|Rachel]]. Jamie has nightmares about Michael; though she knows of her uncle, she does not realize he is the figure in said nightmares. On Halloween night, Richard and Darlene go to a party and leave Rachel to babysit, forcing her to cancel a date with her boyfriend Brady. After school, Rachel takes Jamie to buy ice cream and a Halloween costume. Michael arrives in Haddonfield and steals a mask from the same store that Jamie and Rachel are visiting; he almost attacks the former but flees when she screams.\n\nThat night, as Rachel takes Jamie [[trick-or-treating]], Michael breaks into the house and finds photos of Laurie in Jamie's bedroom. Loomis arrives in Haddonfield and warns the new Sheriff Ben Meeker that Michael has returned. Michael heads to the power station and kills a worker by throwing him into a transformer, plunging the town into darkness. Michael then attacks the police station, killing every officer inside. A lynch mob is formed by the townspeople to kill Michael. Rachel discovers Brady cheating on her with Sheriff Meeker's daughter Kelly, and loses track of Jamie. After being chased by Michael, Rachel finds Jamie.\n\nSheriff Meeker and Loomis arrive and take the girls to the sheriff's house, where Brady is with Kelly, along with a deputy. They barricade the house, and Loomis departs to look for Michael. Brady tries to talk to Rachel, but she refuses to speak with him. Michael sneaks into the house and kills the deputy and Kelly. Rachel and Jamie flee to the attic while Brady stays to fend off Michael, and is killed when Michael snaps his neck. The girls climb through a window onto the roof and Jamie is lowered down safely, but Michael attacks Rachel and knocks her off the roof, rendering her unconscious.\n\nPursued by Michael, Jamie runs and finds Loomis. They take shelter in the school, but Michael appears and throws Loomis through a glass door, then chases Jamie through the building. Jamie trips and falls down a flight of stairs. Rachel reappears and subdues Michael with a fire extinguisher, and he escapes. The lynch mob arrives, and four of the men agree to drive the girls to the next town. Along the way, they meet up with the state police en route to Haddonfield. Michael, who hid underneath the truck, climbs aboard and kills the four men. Rachel takes the wheel, throws Michael off the truck and then rams into him, casting him into a ditch near an abandoned mine. Sheriff Meeker, Loomis, the remaining lynch mob, and the state police arrive. Jamie approaches Michael and touches his hand, and he rises. Meeker, the state police, and the lynch mob shoot Michael until he falls down into the mine.\n\nLoomis and Meeker take Jamie and Rachel back home. As Darlene goes upstairs to run a bath for Jamie, she is suddenly attacked. When Loomis investigates, he finds an emotionless Jamie holding a pair of bloody scissors at the top of the stairs, reminiscent of Michael when [[Halloween (1978 film)|he killed his own sister]]. Loomis screams \"No!\" repeatedly and attempts to shoot Jamie, but Meeker stops him. Loomis sinks to the floor and begins sobbing, as Rachel, Richard, and Meeker stare in horror.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Halloween (franchise) characters|l1=''List of'' Halloween ''characters''}}\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]]\n* [[Ellie Cornell]] as [[Rachel Carruthers]]\n* [[Danielle Harris]] as [[Jamie Lloyd]]\n* [[Tom Morga]] and [[George P.

Producer Paul Freeman, a friend of Akkad with a long list of credits to his name, explained to ''[[Fangoria]]'' magazine in 1988 that everybody came out of ''Halloween III'' saying, \"Where's Michael?\"<ref name=\"bts\" /> John Carpenter was approached by [[Cannon Films]], who had just finished 1986's release of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'', to write and direct ''Halloween 4''. Debra Hill planned to produce the film, while Carpenter teamed up with [[Dennis Etchison]] who, under the pseudonym Jack Martin, had written [[novelization]]s of both ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981) and ''Halloween III: Season of the Witch'' (1982) to write a script to ''Halloween 4''. Originally, [[Joe Dante]] was Carpenter's choice in mind of director for the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blumhouse.com/2017/01/06/exclusive-interview-dennis-etchison-on-his-unmade-halloween-4-the-ghosts-of-the-lost-river-drive-in/|title=Exclusive Interview: Dennis Etchison On His Unmade HALLOWEEN 4 & The Ghosts Of The Lost River Drive-In|last=Assip|first=Mike|date=2017-01-06|website=Blumhouse.com|access-date=2017-04-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108183635/http://www.blumhouse.com/2017/01/06/exclusive-interview-dennis-etchison-on-his-unmade-halloween-4-the-ghosts-of-the-lost-river-drive-in/|archive-date=January 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Akkad rejected the Etchison script, calling it \"too cerebral\" and insisting that any new ''Halloween'' sequel must feature Myers as a flesh and blood killer.<ref>An [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] special \"Backdraft\", a show about the behind the scenes info on the whole [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' series]] clarified all of this information.</ref> In an interview, Etchison explained how he received the phone call informing him of the rejection of his script. Etchison said, \"I received a call from Debra Hill and she said, 'Dennis, I just wanted you to know that John and I have sold our interest in the title 'Halloween' and unfortunately, your script was not part of the deal.\"<ref name=\"Halloween: 25 Years of Terror DVD\" />\n\nCarpenter and Hill had signed all of their rights away to Akkad, who gained ownership. Akkad said, \"I just went back to the basics of ''Halloween'' on ''Halloween 4'' and it was the most \nsuccessful.\"<ref>{{cite video |title=Halloween: 25 Years of Terror DVD |date=2006 |medium=DVD |location=United States |publisher=Trancas International Pictures |people=Moustapha Akkad}}</ref> As Carpenter refused to continue his involvement with the series, a new director was sought out. [[Dwight H. Little]], a native of Ohio, replaced Carpenter. Little had previously directed episodes for ''[[Freddy's Nightmares]]'' and the film ''Getting Even''.\n\n===Screenplay===\nOn February 25, 1988, writer [[Alan B. McElroy]], a native of a [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], was brought in to write the script for ''Halloween 4''.<ref name=\"H4info\">{{cite web|year = 2001|url = http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h3bts.htm|title = Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, Behind the Scenes|work = HalloweenMovies.com|publisher = Trancas International Films|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://archive.today/20120906130444/http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h3bts.htm|archive-date = September 6, 2012|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|writer's strike]] was to begin on March 7 that year. This forced McElroy to develop a concept, pitch the story, and send in the final draft in under eleven days.{{sfn|Little|2013|loc=event occurs at 3:49}}<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web| url = https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-242/page/n29| title = Starlog Magazine Issue 242 : The Starlog Group : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive| date = September 1997}}</ref> McElroy came up with the idea of Brittany \"Britti\" Lloyd, Laurie Strode's daughter, to be chased by her uncle, who has escaped from Ridgemont after being in a coma for ten years. Dr. Samuel Loomis goes looking for Michael with Sheriff Meeker. The setting of the place was once again Haddonfield, Illinois. The character of Laurie Strode was revealed to have died, leaving Britti with the Carruthers family, which included Rachel, the family's seventeen-year-old daughter. Britti's name was later changed to Jamie, a homage to Laurie Strode actress [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].\n\nMcElroy told ''[[Fangoria]]'':\n{{blockquote|When I first saw the original, I was dating a girl and took her to a theater in Boston to see it. We were the only ones in the place, but she was climbing all over me. When ''Halloween II'' came out, I got completely blitzed and saw it, and I had the best time. So when the director, Dwight Little, asked me to write the script, I jumped at the chance. Here I was going to bring the Shape \u2014 Michael Myers \u2014 back to life. It's a piece of film history. He's truly an icon.<ref name=\"H4info\" />}}\n\nIn the original draft, Sheriff Ben Meeker was to be killed during the Shape's attack on the Meeker house. A fire would have started in the basement and burnt down the entire house. The scene on top of the roof with the Shape, Rachel, and Jamie was supposed to be engulfed in flames. This idea was scrapped due to budget issues.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} Instead, a more \"soap opera\" feel was incorporated, which included a love triangle subplot between Rachel, Brady, and Kelly Meeker, the sheriff's daughter.\n\nDirector Dwight H. Little stated in 2006 that his interpretation of McElroy's screenplay had the Michael Myers character played as a literal escaped mental patient, not a supernatural figure.{{sfn|Little|2013|loc=event occurs at 11:58, 12:19}} Little approached the screenplay as though Myers was pursuing Jamie as a means of \"connecting with her\", but that he had no social capacity to interact with her, and thus resorted to violence.{{sfn|Little|2013|loc=event occurs at 12:50}} The screenplay references the events of ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), in which a fire breaks out in Haddonfield Hospital, by having both Myers and Loomis display burn scars on their respective hands and faces.{{sfn|Little|2013|loc=event occurs at 14:45}}\n\n===Casting===\nThe cast of ''Halloween 4'' included only one actor from the first two films, [[Donald Pleasence]], who reprised his role as Samuel Loomis, Michael Myers' [[psychiatrist]].{{sfn|Little|2013|loc=event occurs at 15:40}} According to Little, Pleasence was \"committed conceptually\" to the role, but did not sign on to the project until having read a finished screenplay.{{sfn|Little|2013|loc=event occurs at 15:44}} Before McElroy's script was chosen, the producers asked [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], another original cast member, to reprise her role as Laurie Strode, the original's heroine. Curtis had become a success in the film industry and had established a career with her roles in films like ''[[Trading Places]]'' (1983) and ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' (1988). Curtis declined and did not want to continue her participation in the film, although she did return for the [[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later|seventh ''Halloween'' film]]. As a result, her character was written out and died, which is briefly explained in the film.\n\nThe script introduced Laurie Strode's seven-year-old daughter, Jamie Lloyd.

Instead of filming in [[Pasadena, California]] (the original filming location and stand in for Haddonfield) due to high-rising costs, filming took place in and around [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].{{sfn|Little|2013|loc=event occurs at 9:13}} As filming was taking place in March,<ref name=\"H4info\" /> during springtime, the producers were forced to import leaves and big squash, which they would use to create pumpkins by painting them orange.{{sfn|Little|2013|loc=event occurs at 12:00}} \"One of the obvious challenges in making a part four of anything is to interest a contemporary audience in old characters and themes,\" said director [[Dwight H. Little]]. \"What I'm trying to do is capture the mood of the original ''Halloween'' and yet take a lot of new chances. What we're attempting to do is walk a fine line between horror and mystery. ''Halloween 4'' will not be an ax-in-the-forehead kind of movie.\" Paul Freeman agreed. \"This film does contain some humorous moments, but it's not of the spoof or send-up variety. It's humor that rises out of the film's situations and quickly turns back into terror.\"<ref name=\"bts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h4bts.htm|title=\"Behind the Scenes\" of ''Halloween 4''|publisher=Trancas International Films Inc.|work=HalloweenMovies.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125161124/http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h4bts.htm|archive-date=January 25, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[George P. Wilbur]], who was cast as Michael Myers, wore hockey pads under the costume to make himself look more physically imposing, and he was often filmed in mirror reflections or off-center so that the audience could witness him \"in pieces\" rather than have an encompassing view.{{sfn|Little|2013|loc=event occurs at 10:22}} During filming, the cast and crew made it a point to take it easy on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and he was not going to hurt her.<ref>''Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers'' DVD: Halloween 4: Final Cut</ref>\n\nThe late night scenes caused issues with the cast. Garlan Wilde, a gaffer for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape when he dropped a light and accidentally slit his wrists. He was rushed to the hospital. In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while sliding down the roof, though she continued filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood. During most of the night scenes, Donald Pleasence became so cold that he wore a hat for most of the scenes, unbeknownst to the crew. This caused over six hours of footage to be re-shot. The shoot lasted about 41 days and Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were required to be on set for 36 of those days.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nDuring filming, it was considered that the customized 1975 [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] mask be reused for this film. However, the mask was long gone and a new one was purchased from a local costume shop. The producers wanted to test and see what it would look like without the edits. The school scene was filmed and when reviewing the producers did not like how the mask turned out. It was allegedly customized again but did not live up to the original, and the producers felt it was too old and went for a new mask. Some scenes had to be re-shot with the new mask.<ref>{{cite video |title=Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers DVD Commentary |date=2006 |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] |location=United States |people=Alan B.

Little and producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] decided that the film's violence was too soft, and so an extra day of \"blood filming\" commenced. [[Special effect]]s [[make-up artist]] [[John Carl Buechler]] (director of ''[[Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood]]'') was brought in to create the thumb in the forehead kill and neck-twisting of the [[redneck]] seen in the film's final cut.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (soundtrack)}}\nThe score was performed by Alan Howarth, who had assisted John Carpenter on ''Halloween II'' and ''Halloween III''. Howarth gained approval from Dwight H. Little before he could accept the offer, creating a new score that referenced the original's but with a [[synthesizer]] twist. Howarth also included new tracks such as \"Jamie's Nightmare\", \"Return of the Shape\", and \"Police Station\". The soundtrack was released to Compact Disc, LP Vinyl Record, and Cassette Tape on September 28, 1988.\n\n==Release==\n''Halloween 4'' opened in 1,679 theaters on October 21, 1988 and grossed $6,831,250 in its opening weekend, ranking number one at the box office.
