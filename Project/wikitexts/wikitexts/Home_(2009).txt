Taking over eighteen months to complete the film, director Yann Arthus-Bertrand and a camera man, a camera engineer and a pilot flew in a small [[helicopter]] through various regions in over fifty countries. The filming was done using [[High-definition video|high-definition]] ''\"Cineflex\"'' cameras which were suspended from a gyro-stabilized sphere from rails on the base of the helicopter. These cameras, originally manufactured for army firing equipment, reduce vibrations helping to capture smooth images, which appear as if they had been filmed from crane arms or [[Camera dolly|dollies]]. After almost every flight, recordings were immediately checked to ensure they were usable.<ref>{{YouTube|i5a78lAezMM|''Home''- The shooting}}</ref> Raw footage totaled 488 hours.\n\n== Distribution and promotion ==\nTo promote the documentary online, a YouTube channel known as \"HomeProject\" was created.
