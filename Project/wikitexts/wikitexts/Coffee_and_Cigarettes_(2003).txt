The feature film consists of 11 [[short story|short stories]] which share coffee and cigarettes as a common thread, and includes the earlier three short films.\n\n== Themes ==\nThe film is composed of a [[comics|comic]] series of short vignettes shot in [[black and white]] built on one another to create a cumulative effect, as the characters discuss things such as [[caffeine]] popsicles, [[Paris]] in the 1920s, and the use of [[nicotine]] as an [[insecticide]] \u2013 all while sitting around drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. The theme of the film is absorption in the obsessions, joys, and addictions of life, and there are many common threads between vignettes, such as the [[Tesla coil]], medical knowledge, the suggestion that coffee and cigarettes don't make for a healthy meal (generally lunch), cousins, The Lees (Cinqu\u00e9 and Joie, and a mention of [[Spike Lee]]), delirium, miscommunication, musicians, the similarities between musicianship and medical skill, industrial music, acknowledged fame, and the idea of drinking coffee before sleeping in order to have fast dreams. In each of the segments of the film, the common motif of alternating black and white tiles can be seen in some fashion. The visual use of black and white relates to the theme of interpersonal contrasts, as each vignette features two people who disagree completely yet manage to sit amicably at the same table.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\n== Plot segments ==\nThe eleven segments that make up the film are as follows:\n\n=== Strange to Meet You ===\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:CoffeeandCigarettesSegment1.jpg|left|125px|thumb|{{deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 1 November  2007}}]] -->\nThis is the original 1986 short ''Coffee and Cigarettes'' with [[Roberto Benigni]] and [[Steven Wright]] having a conversation about coffee and cigarettes. Steven tells Roberto about his coffee ideas, such as freezing it into \"caffeine Popsicles\" for kids, and how he likes to drink coffee right before he goes to sleep so he can dream faster \"like a camera on those [[Indy 500]] cars\". Roberto does not understand anything he says but is entertained to listen. They experiment with switching chairs, but decide to switch back again. Steven suddenly remembers he has a dentist appointment that he is afraid to go to, but has to. Roberto happily volunteers and goes instead of him.\n\n=== Twins ===\nOriginally the 1989 short ''Coffee and Cigarettes, Memphis Version'' \u2013 aka ''Coffee and Cigarettes II'' \u2013 this segment features [[Joie Lee]] and [[Cinqu\u00e9 Lee]] as the titular twins and [[Steve Buscemi]] as the waiter who expounds on his theory on [[Elvis Presley]]'s evil twin. The scene also features a recounting of the urban legend that Elvis Presley made racist comments about African Americans during a magazine interview.<ref name=\"Guralnick, 2007\">{{cite news |last1=Guralnick |first1=Peter |title=Was Elvis a racist?

At various points each musician remarks that the other is not on the jukebox, though Iggy Pop's music can be heard on a jukebox in another segment later in the film.\n\n=== Those Things'll Kill Ya ===\n[[Joseph Rigano]] and [[Vinny Vella]] have a conversation over coffee about the dangers of smoking. The silent Vinny Vella Jr. also appears to beg his father for money, which is given in exchange for affection, which is not provided.\n\n=== Ren\u00e9e ===\nRen\u00e9e French (played by herself) drinks coffee while looking through a gun magazine. [[E. J. Rodr\u00edguez]] plays the waiter, who is eager to be of service. He initially approaches her to serve more coffee, to which she reacts by saying \"I had the right color, right temperature, it was just right\". After that, he comes back several times, hesitates, and leaves. He seems intent on striking up a conversation with her.\n\n=== No Problem ===\n[[Alex Descas]] and [[Isaach De Bankol\u00e9]] are a couple of friends who meet and talk over some coffee and cigarettes. Alex has no problems, or so he answers to Isaach's repeated questioning.  At the end of the scene, Alex takes out a pair of dice and rolls three sets of doubles. \nIt could be assumed that he has a gambling problem but to him it appears to be a non-issue. Despite this, he doesn't roll the dice in front of his friend.\n\n=== Cousins ===\n[[Cate Blanchett]] plays herself and a fictional and non-famous cousin named Shelly, whom she meets over some coffee in the lounge of a hotel. There is no smoking in the lounge, as the waiter informs Shelly (but not until Cate is gone).  Shelly tells Cate about her boyfriend, Lee, who is in a band.  She describes the music style as hard industrial, similar to the band Iggy describes.  Cate tells Shelly she looks forward to meeting \"Lou\" someday. Cate is made to feel awkward and uncomfortable by Shelly's constant envious remarks about how she perceives Cate's life and attitude.\n\n=== Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil ===\nFeatures [[Jack White (musician)|Jack]] and [[Meg White]] of the band [[The White Stripes]] having some coffee and cigarettes.  They play themselves, although the scene seems to perpetuate the band's former pretense that they are indeed siblings. Jack shows Meg his [[Tesla coil]] that he says he built himself and waxes intellectual on the achievements of [[Nikola Tesla]]. In the beginning, Jack seems upset that Meg doesn't share his excitement, and it takes Meg some coaxing to get Jack to agree to show Meg his Tesla coil. He introduces the line, \"Nikola Tesla perceived the earth to be a conductor of acoustical resonance.\"  Cinqu\u00e9 Lee plays a waiter in this segment. In the end, the coil breaks, and Meg and the Waiter offer suggestions as to why it might be broken. Finally Meg says something that Jack seems to agree to, and he leaves to \"go home and check it out\". Meg clinks her coffee cup to produce a ringing noise, pauses, says \"Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance\" and clinks her coffee cup to produce the noise again; she looks pensively out into the distance before a cut to black. Early during the segment, \"Down on the Street\" by Iggy Pop's band [[The Stooges]] is played on the jukebox in the background.\n\n=== Cousins? ===\nBritish actors [[Alfred Molina]] and [[Steve Coogan]] have a conversation over some tea. (Coogan offers Molina a French cigarette, but Molina saves his for later.) Molina is a very enthusiastic fan of Coogan's, who contrarily is very uninterested at their meeting and barely manages to hide this. Molina excitedly shares with him research he came across, learning that they are distant cousins, and proposes a friendship or show business project to capitalize on this. Steve Coogan still remains evasive, lightening up only when an attractive female fan recognizes him. He later tries to make up excuses to keep from ever having to hear from Alfred Molina again, and then clumsily tries to reverse this when he overhears Molina get a call from good friend [[Spike Jonze]]. But it is too late and Molina, disappointed, leaves Coogan with the bill. Although the scene is set in LA, the segment was actually shot in Brooklyn at Galapagos, Williamsburg.\n\n=== Delirium ===\nHip-hop artists (and cousins) [[Gza|GZA]] and [[Rza|RZA]] of the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] drink naturally caffeine-free [[herbal tea]] and have a conversation with the waiter, [[Bill Murray]], about the dangers of caffeine and nicotine. During this conversation GZA makes a reference to how he would drink much coffee before going to bed so his dreams would \"whip by\" similar to the camera-shots at the [[Indianapolis 500|Indy 500]], very similar to the same reference that Steven Wright did in the first segment. Murray requests that GZA and RZA keep his identity secret, while GZA and RZA inform Murray about nontraditional methods to relieve his smoker's hack.\n\n=== Champagne ===\n[[William \"Bill\" Rice]] and [[Taylor Mead]] spend their coffee break having a nostalgic conversation, whilst [[Janet Baker]] singing \"Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen\" from [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[R\u00fcckert-Lieder]] appears from nowhere.  William Rice repeats Jack White's line, \"Nikola Tesla perceived the earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance.\" It is possible to interpret the relevance of this line to the constant recurrent themes throughout the seemingly unconnected segments.\n\n==Reception== \n{{expand section|date=November 2016}}\n\nSeveral reviewers have praised the film's handling of the relationship between celebrities and fame.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Phipps |first=Keith |date=May 11, 2004 |title=Coffee And Cigarettes |url=https://www.avclub.com/coffee-and-cigarettes-1798199584 |access-date=2019-12-17 |website=The A.V.

He noted that \"four or five are duds. Three, however, in which people appear as versions of themselves, are outstanding.
