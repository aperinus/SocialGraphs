The film follows two young boys who accidentally release a horde of demons from their backyard through a large hole in the ground.\n\nAn international co-production between Canada and the United States, the film was released by the New Century Vista Film Company and grossed around twice its budget. Since its release, it has obtained a [[cult following]] and was followed by a sequel in 1990 titled ''[[The Gate II: Trespassers]]''.\n\nA 3D-remake directed by [[Alex Winter]] was in production; it was initially set for a release in 2011, but no release occurred at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenread.de/the-gate-3d-alex-winter-interview-english|title=Remaking ''The Gate'' \u2013 Interview Alex Winter|accessdate=12 August 2010|publisher=screen/read| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100909165838/http://www.screenread.de/the-gate-3d-alex-winter-interview-english| archivedate= 9 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nTwelve-year-old Glen has a nightmare of finding his home abandoned, then going into his tree-house only for it to be struck by lightning and collapse. When he wakes, he finds that in his backyard, workers have cut down the same tree from his nightmare and unearthed a [[geode]]. Glen returns with older friend Terry to investigate. Though the workers attempted to fill the hole left by the tree, Glen and Terry breach the surface, finding a large geode. Glen catches a splinter and leaves a small amount of blood behind.\n\nGlen's parents leave town for three days, placing his 15-year-old sister Alexandra (\"Al\") in charge. While Al throws a party, Terry and Glen break open the geode after having discovered that it has left strange writing on a notepad, and read the incantations aloud. They go downstairs just as the party-goers are playing a levitation game. Everyone is shocked when they levitate Glen.\n\nThat night, Glen sees his bedroom wall stretching, and Terry embraces an apparition of his dead mother that turns out to be Glen's dog Angus, who dies as a result. The next day, Terry brings a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] album to Glen's house with lyrics based on \"The Dark Book\". He believes that the hole in Glen's backyard is a gateway to a domain of evil gods, and speculates that their actions opened it. He concludes that the only missing element would be to deposit a sacrifice into the hole. Unknown to them, a friend of Al's dumps Angus's body into the hole, completing the summoning. After having read a section from \"The Dark Book\" that is supposed to close the gateway, the boys find the hole closed and assume that their efforts succeeded.\n\nThat night, a swarm of moths shatter Glen's bedroom window, and Angus' corpse is found in Terry's bed. Demonic arms try pulling Al under her bed; Terry and Glen barely save her. They try fleeing the house, but are greeted outside by Glen and Al's parents, actually disguised demons. After having returned to the house, Al volunteers to inspect the yard, but the others see it swarming with small demons and call her back. Terry leads everyone to the basement to retrieve \"The Dark Book\", but it bursts into flames. They then attempt to stop the creatures by reading the [[Bible]]. Terry reads from [[Psalm 59]] and the hole begins to close, but he slips and falls into the hole. Terry is attacked by the small demons before Al and Glen pull him out. Terry reads from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], then throws the Bible into the hole, causing an explosion that appears to seal the hole.\n\nThat night, a wall breaks open and a construction worker's corpse falls through (Terry had previously lied to Glen that when his house was built, one of the workers died and the other workers had sealed him inside a wall). The worker pulls Terry into the wall, which seals behind him. Upstairs, Al notices a hazy image of the construction worker in her mirror before Glen bursts into her bedroom. Al throws a stereo at the construction worker and he disintegrates into dozens of little demons. Al holds the bedroom door shut while Glen races downstairs to find their father's gun. A demonic version of Terry appears, biting his hand before Al stabs Terry in the eye. Al and Glen hide in a closet, but the construction worker breaks through an interior wall and drags Al away.\n\nGlen realizes that Terry and Al represent the two human sacrifices that would fully open the gate. He also realizes that the rocket that he had given to Al for her birthday, a symbol of love, light and purity, may stop the rise of the Old Gods. He makes his way upstairs as the floor collapses, revealing a [[Chasm (disambiguation)|chasm]] beneath the house. Glen attempts to launch the rocket, but his matches keep blowing out. The wind sucks Glen onto the foyer, where a giant serpentine demon emerges. The demon pats Glen on the head and touches his hand before returning to the hole. Glen discovers that the demon's touch has placed an eye in the palm of his hand. He stabs the eye, then struggles to descend the staircase, at which point the demon re-emerges. Glen uses a battery-powered launcher to fire his rocket into the demon, causing it to explode.\n\nAngus emerges from the front closet, seemingly restored to life. He is followed by Terry and Al, also unhurt. Later, the kids worry about how to explain the wreckage of the house to their parents.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Glen\n* Christa Denton as Al\n* Louis Tripp as Terry Chandler\n* [[Kelly Rowan]] as Lori Lee\n* [[Jennifer Irwin]] as Linda Lee\n* [[Deborah Grover]] as Mom\n* Scot Denton as Dad\n* [[Ingrid Veninger]] as Paula\n* Sean Fagan as Eric\n* [[Linda Goranson]] as Mrs. Chandler\n* Carl Kraines as The Workman\n* [[Andrew Gunn (film producer)|Andrew Gunn]] as Brad\n\n== Production ==\nThe first draft of the script was written by [[Michael Nankin]] when he was unemployed and recently divorced, basing it on \"the nastiest thoughts from [his] childhood\".<ref name=moviepilot>{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/2862800|title=10 Things About \"The Gate\" You Probably Didn't Know|author=Manny MassGrave Serrano|date=December 7, 2016|work=MoviePilot| access-date=January 11, 2018| url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111224138/https://moviepilot.com/posts/2862800| archivedate=January 11, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://joblo.com/horror-movies/news/happy-30th-birthday-the-gate-156|title=Happy 30th Birthday, The Gate!|author=Mike Sprague|date=May 15, 2017|work=JoBlo.com|access-date=January 11, 2018}}</ref> Glen and Al were depicted as being more mischievous than shown in the final film, and the demons spread to the rest of the town, where they would drag neighbors out into the streets to kill them. The gigantic demon was originally envisioned as being made of bloody entrails.<ref name=moviepilot />\n\nThe house was a real home in [[Toronto]], but an exterior exit had to be constructed for the production, featuring bricks, stairs, and a bug zapper. Beyond the backyard was a new housing development, so the crew erected a fence around the yard to block the construction vehicles and workers from view.<ref name=moviepilot />\n\nThe effects used to create the demons included [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] as well as [[forced perspective]], wherein actors wearing [[Creature suit|rubber suits]] were made to look minuscule by their position relative to the camera and to the human characters.
