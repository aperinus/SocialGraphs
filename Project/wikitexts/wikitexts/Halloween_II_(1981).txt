It is the second installment in the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' film series]] and is a continuation sequel to ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).\nThe plot picks up directly after the [[Cliffhanger|cliffhanger ending]] of the first film, with [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] following survivor Laurie Strode to the local hospital, while his psychiatrist Dr. Loomis continues his pursuit of him.\n\nThough Carpenter directed a good portion of the film and wrote the screenplay to the sequel, Carpenter realistically could not direct the entire film in time due to directing his other film in that timeframe, appointing the direction to Rosenthal. Filming took place in the spring of 1981, primarily at [[Morningside Hospital (California)|Morningside Hospital]] in [[Los Angeles]], California, on a budget of $2.5 million. Stylistically, ''Halloween II'' reproduces certain key elements that made the original ''Halloween'' a success, such as first-person camera perspectives, and was intended (at the time) to finish the story of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. It also introduces the plot twist of Laurie Strode being the sister of Michael Myers, an element that would form the narrative arc of the series in subsequent films after ''Halloween II''\u2014including [[Rob Zombie]]'s [[Halloween (2007 film)|remake]] and its [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]]\u2014but was dropped from the series' canon from the [[Halloween (2018 film)|2018 film]] onwards. \n\n''Halloween II'' was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], and premiered in the United States on October 30, 1981. The film was a huge box office success, grossing over $25 million domestically alone. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise directed towards its performances and atmosphere.\n\n==Plot==\nOn <!--This is a date, not a movie-->October 31, 1978<!--Do not link to a movie per WP:EASTEREGG-->, [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] is shot by his psychiatrist [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]] and falls off a balcony. He survives and escapes into the night. Wandering the alleys, he steals a kitchen knife from an elderly couple and kills the teenage girl next door. Meanwhile, [[Laurie Strode]], who narrowly avoided being killed that night, is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital while Loomis continues his pursuit of Michael, accompanied by Sheriff Leigh Brackett. Loomis mistakes costumed teenager [[Ben Tramer]] for Michael, resulting in Ben being hit by a police car and burning to death. Upon learning his daughter [[Annie Brackett|Annie]] has been killed by Michael, Sheriff Brackett blames Loomis and abandons the search, leaving Deputy Gary Hunt to take his place.\n\nAt the hospital, [[Emergency medical technician|paramedic]] Jimmy develops an attraction to Laurie, but head [[nurse]] Virginia Alves limits the time he spends with her. After hearing a newsflash revealing Laurie's location, Michael makes his way to the hospital, where he cuts the phone lines and slashes all the car tires so no one can escape and go for help. Wandering the halls in search of Laurie, he kills the security guard, the doctor, and several nurses throughout the night. In her hospital room, Laurie dreams about the time she learned she was adopted, and remembers she once visited a young Michael at the sanitarium. Jimmy and nurse Jill Franco search the hospital for Laurie, who is trying to evade Michael.\n\nJimmy finds the body of Mrs. Alves by slipping in a pool of her blood and knocking himself unconscious, giving himself a concussion. Meanwhile, police are informed that Michael broke into the local elementary school earlier. Loomis rides with them. His colleague Marion Chambers arrives to escort him back to Smith's Grove on the governor's orders and under the enforcement of a [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshal]]. On the way, she tells him that Laurie is Michael's younger sister; she was put up for adoption after the death of Michael's parents, with the records sealed to protect the family.\n\nRealizing that Michael is after Laurie and being told she was brought to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, Loomis forces the marshal at gunpoint to drive back to Haddonfield. Jill finally finds Laurie, only to be killed by Michael, who then pursues Laurie through the hospital. She manages to escape to the parking lot and hides in a car. Jimmy soon arrives and tries to drive the car to safety, but passes out again on the horn, attracting Michael\u2019s attention. Loomis, Marion, and the marshal reach the hospital just in time to save Laurie. Loomis shoots Michael until he falls down, seemingly dead. While Marion calls the police on the marshal\u2019s radio, the marshal tries to check Michael's pulse as Loomis warns him to stay away, knowing he isn't dead. Michael revives and slits the marshal\u2019s throat with a [[scalpel]].\n\nLoomis and Laurie run into an operating room, where he gives her the marshal's gun before being stabbed by Michael. Laurie shoots the assailant in both eyes, blinding him. As he swings around the space violently, the two fill the room with flammable gas. Loomis orders Laurie to get out before igniting the gas, immolating himself and Michael in an explosion. Laurie watches as Michael, engulfed in flames, emerges from the fire before finally collapsing. The next morning, she is transferred to another hospital, traumatized but alive.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Halloween (franchise) characters|l1=List of ''Halloween'' characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as [[Laurie Strode]]\n**Nichole Drucker as Young Laurie Strode\n*[[Donald Pleasence]] as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]]\n*[[Charles Cyphers]] as Sheriff Leigh Brackett\n*[[Lance Guest]] as Jimmy\n*[[Pamela Susan Shoop]] as Nurse Karen Bailey \n*[[Hunter von Leer]] as Deputy Gary Hunt\n*[[Tawny Moyer]] as Nurse Jill Franco\n*[[Ana Alicia]] as Nurse Janet Marshall\n*[[Nancy Stephens]] as Marion Chambers\n*[[Dick Warlock]] as [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers / The Shape]] / Patrolman #3\n**Adam Gunn as Young Michael Myers\n**[[Nick Castle]] and [[Tony Moran (actor)|Tony Moran]] as Michael Myers {{small|(archive footage)}}\n*Gloria Gifford as Nurse Virginia Alves\n*[[Leo Rossi]] as Budd Scarlotti\n*[[Ford Rainey]] as Dr. Frederick Mixter\n*[[Jeffrey Kramer]] as Graham\n*[[Cliff Emmich]] as Bernard Garrett \n*[[John Zenda]] as Marshall Terrence Gummell \n*Anne Bruner as Alice Martin\n*[[Lucille Benson]] as Mrs Elrod\n*Catherine Bergstrom as Debra Lane\n*[[Anne-Marie Martin]] as Darcy\n*[[Dana Carvey]] as Barry McNichol\n*[[Billy Warlock]] as Craig Levant\n*Alan Haufrect as Reporter (Robert Mundy)\n*[[Nancy Kyes|Nancy Loomis]] as [[Annie Brackett]] {{small|(corpse cameo)}}\n*[[Kyle Richards]] as Lindsey Wallace {{small|(archive footage)}}\n*[[Brian Andrews (actor)|Brian Andrews]] as Tommy Doyle {{small|(archive footage)}}\n*[[Jonathan Prince]] as Randy Lohnner\n*Jack Verbois as Ben Tramer{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nCarpenter and Hill, the writers of the first ''Halloween'', had originally considered setting the sequel a few years after the events of ''Halloween''.

He stated, \"I did not see the original first but being from a small town, I wanted the Deputy to have compassion.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} [[Nancy Stephens]], who played Loomis's nurse colleague Marion Chambers in the original, also reprised the character and was given a more important role, revealing to Loomis the family connection between Laurie and Michael.{{sfn|Felsher|2012|loc=event occurs at 12:10}}\n\nStunt performer [[Dick Warlock]] played Michael Myers (as in ''Halloween'', listed as \"The Shape\" in the credits), replacing Castle who was beginning a career as a director. Warlock's previous experience in film was as a stunt double in films, such as ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' (1968) and ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), and the 1974 television series ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]''. In an interview, Warlock explained how he prepared for the role since Myers received far more screen time in the sequel than the original. Warlock said:\n\n{{Blockquote|[I watched the scenes] where Laurie is huddled in the closet. Michael breaks through. She grabs a hanger and thrusts it up and into his eyes. Michael falls down and Laurie walks to the bedroom doorway and sits down. In the background, we see Michael sit up and turn towards her to the beat of the music. ...

Hill confirmed this in an interview.<ref name=h2bts/>\n\nThe supporting cast consisted of relatively unknown actors and actresses, except for [[Jeffrey Kramer]] and [[Ford Rainey]]. Most of the cast previously or later appeared in films or television series by [[Universal Studios]] (the distributor for this film). Kramer was previously cast in a supporting role as Deputy Jeff Hendricks in ''Jaws'' and ''[[Jaws 2]]'' (1978). In ''Halloween II'', Kramer played Dr. Graham, a dentist who examines the charred remains of Ben Tramer. Rainey was chosen to play Haddonfield Memorial Hospital's drunk resident doctor, Frederick Mixter. A host of character actors were cast as the hospital's staff.

Featured in the only nude scene in the film, Shoop discussed filming the scene, and recalled getting an [[ear infection]]: \"[The water] was cold and dirty. They were playing it off like the water was boiling, but it was absolutely freezing! Leo [Rossi] and I were so cold, our teeth were chattering.!\"{{sfn|Collum|2004|p=129}} Gifford and Alicia played minor supporting roles as head nurse Mrs. Virginia Alves and orderly Janet Marshall.

The murder of Dr. Mixter is presumed to still happen, but remains off camera; as does Janet's, although dialogue indicates she might have also gone home at the end of her shift instead of being killed. The scene where Michael stalks Alice is recut to imply that he attacks and kills her neighbor Mrs. Elrod instead. Jimmy's discovery of Mrs. Alves dead and his subsequent slipping in the pool of blood has been significantly shortened (or removed altogether in some prints) and moved just prior to the explosion which kills Myers and Loomis. Jill's stabbing is less graphic, and a moan from the ground implies she might have survived it. Also added are scenes of Michael cutting the power (this explains the dark setting throughout the latter half of the film) and a power generator kicking in. There is also extra dialogue between Laurie and Jimmy, Laurie and Mrs. Alves, Janet and Karen, Karen and Mr. Garrett, Bud and Karen, Jill and Jimmy, etc. Another notable difference is the killing of the marshal. In the theatrical version his throat is slit, while in the TV version it is softened, with Michael grabbing him and stabbing him from behind (with no detail shown). While the theatrical version ends with the deaths of Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis and leaves the audience in a gray area as to whether Jimmy survives, the television cut features an extended ending showing Jimmy alive (with a bandaged head wound from his slip) in the ambulance with Laurie Strode.

Akkad's son, Malek, called the stunt \"disgusting. It's a disgrace ...&nbsp; objectively, any horror fan would find this as an insult to the man who has done so much to the series.

On December 7, 1982, [[Richard Delmer Boyer]] of [[El Monte, California]], murdered Francis and Eileen Harbitz, an elderly couple in Fullerton, California, leading to the trial ''People v. Boyer'' (1989). The couple were stabbed 43 times by Boyer. According to the trial transcript, Boyer's defense was that he suffered from [[hallucination]]s in the Harbitz residence brought on by \"the movie ''Halloween II'', which defendant had seen under the influence of [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], marijuana, and alcohol.\" The film was played for the jury, and a [[psychopharmacologist]] \"pointed out various similarities between its scenes and the visions defendant described.\"<ref>''People v.

The incident became known as the \"''Halloween II'' Murders\" and was featured in a short segment on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s ''[[MonsterVision]]'', hosted by film critic [[Joe Bob Briggs]].<ref name=h2bts/> Following the trial, moral critics came to the defense of horror films and rejected calls to ban them. Thomas M. Sipos, for instance, stated,\n\n<blockquote>It would be silly, after all, to ban horror films just because Boyer claims to have thought that he was reenacting ''Halloween II'', or to ban cars because Texas housewife Clara Harris intentionally ran down and killed her husband. Nor does it make sense to ban otherwise useful items such as drugs or guns just because some individuals misuse them.<ref>Thomas M.
