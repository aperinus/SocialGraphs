He is visited by a probe sent by the starship ''Axiom'', a robot called EVE, with whom he falls in love and pursues across the galaxy.\n\nAfter directing ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. ''WALL-E'' has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with [[body language]] and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film incorporates various topics including [[consumerism]], [[corporatocracy]], [[nostalgia]], [[waste management]], [[human impact on the environment|human environmental impact and concerns]], [[obesity]]/[[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary lifestyles]], and [[global catastrophic risk]].<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\">{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Robin L.|author2=Heumann, Joseph K.|title=WALL-E: From Environmental Adaptation to Sentimental Nostalgia|journal=Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media|date=Spring 2009|series=No. 51|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc51.2009/WallE/text.html|access-date=November 16, 2012|archive-date=October 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021222552/http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc51.2009/WallE/text.html|url-status=live}}</ref> It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters.

This summary is currently at 667. -->\nIn the 22nd century, rampant [[consumerism]], corporate greed, and environmental neglect had turned [[Earth]] into a garbage-strewn wasteland, and the [[megacorporation]] Buy n Large (BnL) had evacuated humanity to space on giant [[Generation ship|starliners]], leaving [[trash compactor|trash compacting]] robots to clean up the planet. Seven centuries later, in 2805, the cleanup has failed and the last remaining active robot, named [[WALL\u00b7E (character)|Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth Class]] (WALL\u00b7E) has developed a personality. WALL\u00b7E is able to remain active by salvaging parts from other inactive robots and lives in a large truck designed to carry the robots. One day, WALL\u00b7E's routine of compressing trash and collecting interesting objects is broken by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an egg-shaped robot named ''Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator'' (EVE) who is sent to scan the planet for signs of sustainable life. WALL\u00b7E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, and the two begin to connect, until EVE goes into [[standby mode]] when WALL\u00b7E shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. The probe ship eventually returns and collects EVE and the plant, with WALL\u00b7E clinging on. The probe ship then returns to its mothership, the starliner ''Axiom''.\n\nIn the centuries since the ''Axiom'' left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into helpless [[obesity]] due to [[microgravity]] and laziness, with robots catering to their every whim. Even the Captain B. McCrea is used to sitting back while his robotic [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] autopilot steering wheel pilots the ship. McCrea is unprepared to receive the positive probe response, but discovers that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a [[warp drive|hyperjump]] back to Earth so that humanity can begin [[recolonization]]. When McCrea inspects EVE's storage compartment, the plant is missing, with EVE blaming WALL-E for its disappearance.\n\nEVE is deemed faulty and taken to diagnostics. Mistaking the process for torture, WALL\u00b7E intervenes and inadvertently releases all the other faulty bots when a stray pulse shot hits the control panel, causing him and EVE to be designated as rogues. Frustrated, EVE tries to send WALL\u00b7E home in an [[escape pod]], but before she can, the two witness AUTO's henchman GO-4 stowing the plant in a pod set to self-destruct, revealing that WALL\u00b7E did not steal the plant. WALL\u00b7E attempts to retrieve it, but is then launched into space. EVE uses an emergency exit to chase after WALL\u00b7E, and witnesses the pod explode, although both he and the plant survive unscathed. He and EVE reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the ''Axiom''.\n\nEVE brings the plant back to McCrea, who watches her recordings of Earth, concluding that they can and must save it. However, the autopilot reveals that it has been programmed with the secret no-return directive [[A113]] issued after BnL CEO Shelby Forthright inaccurately declared in 2110 that Earth could not be saved; the autopilot also reveals that it ordered GO-4 to steal the plant. When McCrea countermands the directive, the autopilot and GO-4 mutiny, electrocuting WALL\u00b7E's circuit board, forcefully putting EVE into standby, throwing them both down the garbage chute, and locking McCrea in his quarters. EVE (having been reactivated by a mouse-like robot) and WALL\u00b7E are nearly ejected into space along with the ship's refuse, but ''Microbe Obliterator'' (M-O), a cleaning robot who had been following WALL-E's dirt trail across the ship, saves the two when he gets stuck when the gate closes and inadvertently alerts the WALL\u00b7A bots, prompting them to abort the ejection. As humans and robots help in securing the plant, McCrea and the autopilot fight for control of the ''Axiom''. WALL\u00b7E is crushed by the Holo-Detector while trying to stop the autopilot from closing it; McCrea eventually overpowers and deactivates the autopilot by switching it to manual mode, and EVE successfully inserts the plant, initiating the hyperjump.\n\nArriving back on Earth, EVE repairs WALL\u00b7E, but finds that his memory and personality have been erased. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL\u00b7E a goodbye \"kiss\", which restores him to his normal self. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the inhabitants of the ''Axiom'' take their first steps on Earth. Humans and robots turn the ravaged planet into a paradise, and the plant grows into a mighty tree, which EVE and WALL\u00b7E rest beneath.\n\n==Cast==\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Ben Burtt]] as [[WALL\u00b7E (character)|WALL\u00b7E]] (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class),<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1813964,00.html|title=WALL-E: Pixar's Biggest Gamble|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=June 12, 2008|magazine=Time|access-date=September 23, 2017|issn=0040-781X|archive-date=October 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002025914/http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1813964,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref> a compactor robot who has achieved [[sentience]], he is the only one still functioning on Earth.

The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL\u00b7E's point-of-view. As an homage to ''[[Get Smart]]'',<ref name=comingsoon>{{cite news|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=45885|author=Joshua Starnes|title=WALL\u2022E Writer/Director Andrew Stanton|publisher=ComingSoon.net|date=June 13, 2008|access-date=November 22, 2008|archive-date=August 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817131043/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=45885|url-status=live}}</ref> AUTO takes the plant and goes into the bowels of the ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have not been sympathetic.<ref name=deleted/> One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges AUTO. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he really takes command of the ''Axiom''.<ref name=evolution/>\n\nStanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship. Originally, EVE would have been electrocuted by AUTO, and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the ''Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Axiom-class'' (WALL\u00b7A) robots, by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt.<ref name=deleted/> Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end.

The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a [[Christmas tree]]. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E\u2014who was made yellow to emulate a tractor\u2014would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.<ref name=eggleston/>\n\n[[File:Wall-E lighting.png|thumb|left|alt=WALL-E holding a bra|[[WALL\u00b7E (character)|WALL\u00b7E]] finds a bra.

He thought that Pixar captured the physics of being underwater with ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and so for ''WALL\u00b7E'', he wanted to push that for air.

Eggleston divided the inside of the ship into three sections; the rear's economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red, blue, and white of the BnL logo. The coach class with living/shopping spaces has \"S\" shapes as people are always looking for \"what's around the corner\". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs. The premier class is a large [[Zen]]-like spa with colors limited to turquoise, cream, and tan, and leads on to the captain's warm carpeted and wooded quarters and the sleek dark bridge.<ref name=eggleston>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationartconservation.com/?c=art&p=wall_e_design_with_a_purpose|title=Design With a Purpose: An interview with Ralph Eggleston|work=Animation Art Conservation|author=Ron Barbagallo|date=January 2009|access-date=February 12, 2009|archive-date=April 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414150036/http://www.animationartconservation.com/?c=art&p=wall_e_design_with_a_purpose|url-status=live}}</ref> In keeping with the artificial ''Axiom'', camera movements were modeled after those of the [[steadicam]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mag.awn.com/article_view.php?id=3682&page=all|format=Printable version|date=June 27, 2008|title=Hello, WALL\u2022E!: Pixar Reaches for the Stars|work=[[Animation World Network]]|author=Bill Desowitz|access-date=February 14, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720073659/http://mag.awn.com/article_view.php?id=3682&page=all|archive-date=July 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe use of live action was a stepping stone for Pixar, as Stanton was planning to make ''[[John Carter (film)|John Carter of Mars]]'' his next project.<ref name=awn/> Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make the rest of the film look even more realistic.<ref name=ripple/> Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly caricaturized, the audience then would not have been able to recognize how serious their devolution was.<ref name=eggleston/> Stanton cast [[Fred Willard]] as the historical Buy n Large CEO because \"[h]e's the most friendly and insincere car salesman I could think of.\"<ref name=newsarama2/> The CEO says \"[[stay the course]]\", which Stanton used because he thought it was funny.<ref name=moviesonline/> [[Industrial Light & Magic]] did the visual effects for these shots.<ref name=notes/>\n\n===Animation===\n''WALL\u00b7E'' went undeveloped during the 1990s partly because Stanton and Pixar were not confident enough yet to have a feature-length film with a main character that behaved like [[Luxo Jr. (character)|Luxo Jr.]], the [[Balanced-arm lamp|Pixar lamp]] or [[R2-D2]].<ref name=avclub/> Stanton explained there are two types of robots in cinema: \"human[s] with metal skin\", like the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]], or \"machine[s] with function\" like Luxo and R2.

His answer was it was not; it was a way to answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself. Nevertheless, some critics have noted an incongruity between the perceived pro-environmental and anti-consumerist messaging of the film, and the environmental impacts in the production and merchandising of the film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://governmentcheese.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:test&catid=11&Itemid=111 |title=Wall-E (2008) and the Ecological Footprint of Animation Production |access-date=January 29, 2019 |archive-date=January 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129064032/https://governmentcheese.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:test&catid=11&Itemid=111 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn \"WALL-E: from environmental adaption to sentimental [[nostalgia]],\" Robin Murray and Joseph Heumann explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, for example [[Zippo]] lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items that are used out of necessity are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing \"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.<ref name=\"Murray and Heumann, 2009\"/>\n\nStanton describes the theme of the film as \"irrational love defeats life's programming\":<ref name=newsarama2/>\n<blockquote>I realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was&nbsp;... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built&nbsp;... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.<ref name=newsarama2/></blockquote>\n\n===Technology===\nStanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because \"that disconnection is going to be the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Jonathan L'Ecuyer |title=An Oscar shout-out |work=[[Gloucester Daily Times]] |url=http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120527035746/http://gloucestertimes.com/punews/local_story_054221319.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |date=February 23, 2009 |access-date=March 3, 2009 }}</ref> Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships.<ref name=robot/> Christian journalist [[Rod Dreher]] saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the ''Axiom'' has separated them from nature, making them \"slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human\". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. \"''WALL\u00b7E'' is not a [[Luddite]] film,\" he said. \"It doesn't demonize technology.

He is shown facing a typological dilemma of classifying a [[spork]] as either a fork or spoon, and his nostalgic interest in the human past further demonstrated by his attachment to repeated viewings of the 1969 film [[Hello, Dolly! (film)|''Hello, Dolly!'']]. Marwick notes that the film features major human evolutionary transitions such as obligate bipedalism (captain of the spaceship struggles with the autopilot to gain control of the vessel) and the invention of agriculture, as part of watershed moments in the story of the film. According to Marwick, one prominent message of the film \"appears to be that the envelopment by technology that the humans in ''Wall-E'' experience paradoxically results in physical and cultural devolution.\" Scholars such as [[Ian Tattersall]] and [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]] have similarly discussed scenarios where elements of modern technology (such as medicine) may have caused [[human evolution]] to slow or stop.\n\nIn 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Tartaglione\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by WALL-E|l1=List of accolades received by ''WALL-E''}}\n''WALL-E'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Sound Mixing]] at the [[81st Academy Awards]], which it lost to ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (Original Score, Original Song, Sound Mixing), ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (Sound Editing), and ''[[Milk (2008 American film)|Milk]]'' (Original Screenplay).<ref name=\"Oscars2009\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/81st-winners.html |title=The 81st Academy Awards (2009) Nominees and Winners |access-date=November 22, 2011 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101405/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/81st-winners.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Oscars 2009: The nominees|work=[[BBC News]]|date=January 22, 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7842438.stm|access-date=January 22, 2009|archive-date=February 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215015708/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7842438.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] nomination,<ref>{{cite news|author1=Michael Cieply|author2=Brooks Barnes|title=Studios Are Pushing Box Office Winners as Oscar Contenders|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/movies/28stud.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|access-date=October 28, 2008|archive-date=May 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512094248/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/movies/28stud.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|url-status=live}}</ref> but it was not nominated, sparking controversy over whether the Academy deliberately restricted ''WALL-E'' to the Best Animated Feature category.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bandyk |first=Matthew |title=Academy Awards Controversy: Wall-E Gets Snubbed For Best Picture Oscar |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/risky-business/2009/01/22/academy-awards-controversy-wall-e-gets-snubbed-for-best-picture-oscar.html |publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |date=January 22, 2009 |access-date=January 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717180938/http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/risky-business/2009/01/22/academy-awards-controversy-wall-e-gets-snubbed-for-best-picture-oscar |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Film critic [[Peter Travers]] remarked, \"If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Academy accused of snubbing Dark Knight, Wall-E |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/23/2473002.htm?section=entertainment |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=January 22, 2009 |access-date=January 22, 2009 |archive-date=March 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302061451/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/23/2473002.htm?section=entertainment |url-status=live }}</ref> Only three animated films, 1991's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and Pixar's next two films, 2009's ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and 2010's ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.
