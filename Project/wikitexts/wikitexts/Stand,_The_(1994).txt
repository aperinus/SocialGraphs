King also wrote the [[teleplay]] and has a minor role in the series. It was directed by [[Mick Garris]], who previously directed the original King screenplay/film ''[[Sleepwalkers (1992 film)|Sleepwalkers]]'' (1992). In order to satisfy expectations from King fans and King himself, ''The Stand'' is a mostly faithful adaptation to the original book,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} with only minor changes to material that would otherwise have not met broadcast [[standards and practices]], and in order to keep ABC content.\n\n''The Stand'' includes a cast of more than 125 speaking roles and features [[Gary Sinise]], [[Miguel Ferrer]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Jamey Sheridan]], [[Laura San Giacomo]], [[Molly Ringwald]], [[Corin Nemec]], [[Adam Storke]], [[Ray Walston]], [[Ed Harris]], and [[Matt Frewer]]. The miniseries was shot in several locations and on 225 sets. Each episode was given a $6 million budget so to reduce cost, the miniseries was shot on [[16&nbsp;mm film]]. ''The Stand'' originally aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from May 8 to May 12, 1994.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news|author=O'Connor, John J.|title=TV Weekend; A Plague and Its Effects|work=The New York Times|date=May 6, 1994|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/arts/tv-weekend-a-plague-and-its-effects.html|access-date=August 5, 2018|archive-date=November 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119025143/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/06/arts/tv-weekend-a-plague-and-its-effects.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Reviews were positive and the miniseries was nominated for six [[46th Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Awards]], winning two for its makeup and sound mixing.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2021}}\nOn June 13, at a top-secret government laboratory in rural [[California]], a weaponized version of [[influenza]], called Project Blue, is accidentally released. A U.S. Army soldier, Charlie Campion, escapes the lab and flees across the country with his wife and daughter, unintentionally spreading the virus. On June 17, Campion crashes his car into a gas station in Arnette, [[Texas]], where Stu Redman and some friends are gathered. With his wife and child already dead from the superflu, Campion warns Redman that he had been pursued by a \"Dark Man\" since they left the lab, before he succumbs to the virus as well. The next day, the U.S. military arrives to quarantine the town on orders from General Starkey, commander of Project Blue.\n\nThe townspeople are taken to a [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]] facility in Stovington, [[Vermont]]. All but Stu succumb to the superflu, called \"Captain Trips\" by the populace, which kills 99.4% of the world's population in two weeks. General Starkey commits suicide, and it is implied that the rest of his team are killed by the superflu. The scattered survivors include would-be rock star Larry Underwood, [[deaf mute]] Nick Andros, Frannie Goldsmith and her unborn child, her teenaged neighbor Harold Lauder, imprisoned criminal Lloyd Henreid, and \"Trashcan Man\", a mentally ill [[arson]]ist and scavenger. The survivors begin having visions, either from kindly Mother Abagail, or from the demonic \"Dark Man\" [[Randall Flagg]]. The dreams counsel the survivors to either travel to [[Nebraska]] to meet Abagail, or to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to join Flagg.\n\nLloyd is freed from prison by Flagg in exchange for becoming his second in command. Trashcan Man destroys fuel tanks across the Midwest and is directed to Las Vegas. Larry escapes [[New York City]] with a mysterious woman named Nadine Cross. Despite their mutual attraction, Nadine is unable to consummate a relationship with Larry because of her visions of Flagg, who commands her to join him; she leaves Larry to travel on her own. Larry then meets a young school teacher named Lucy, and a traumatized boy she calls Joe, outside [[Des Moines]], [[Iowa]], which has been burned to the ground, most likely by \"Trashcan Man\", who is seen blowing up a petroleum refinery. After escaping the CDC facility, Stu gathers a group of survivors, including Frannie, Harold, and former college professor Glen Bateman. They are joined by various other immune survivors.\n\nHarold is consumed with jealousy over Stu's leadership of the group and his growing relationship with Frannie, on whom Harold has an unrequited crush. Nick barely escapes an attempt on his life in Shoyo, [[Arkansas]] by the bigoted town bully, and makes his way across the Mid-South. Nick ends up in May, [[Oklahoma]] where he meets Tom Cullen, a large mentally challenged man who spells every meaningful word he utters as M-O-O-N. The two men travel into Kansas, and encounter Julie Lawry, a vicious girl who vows to kill them when they refuse to let her join them. Nick and Tom then meet kindly farmer Ralph Brentner, and the three head west together in Ralph's pickup truck. Nick's group reaches Abagail's farm in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]]. She warns that a great conflict is imminent and they must travel to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]]. The survivors form a community called the Boulder Free Zone and begin restoring civilization.\n\nFlagg sets up a brutal [[autocracy|autocratic]] regime in Las Vegas, with the intent of defeating the Boulder survivors using salvaged [[nuclear weapon]]s, which he sends \"Trashcan Man\" out to find. Harold's resentment toward Stu and Frannie intensifies, causing him to be seduced by Nadine and join forces with Flagg. Abagail, convinced that she has fallen into the sin of [[pride]], leaves Boulder to [[Catholic spirituality#Desert spirituality|walk in the wilderness]] in an act of atonement. Three Boulder survivors are chosen by the Free Zone Committee to infiltrate Las Vegas as spies: Tom, Dayna Jurgens, and Judge Farris. Glen hypnotizes Tom to follow a specific set of instructions, including that he leave Las Vegas at the next full moon.\n\nHarold and Nadine plant a bomb in Frannie and Stu's home using demolition dynamite, planning to set it off during a meeting of the Free Zone Committee. A weakened Abagail returns to town, and gives a psychic warning to the council members. The warning allows most of the council to escape the explosion, but Nick and a few others are killed. Before she passes away, Abagail tells Stu, Larry, Glen, Ralph, and Frannie that the men must travel by foot to Las Vegas to confront Flagg. When Nadine and Harold flee Boulder, Flagg causes Harold to be crippled in a motorcycle accident. Nadine leaves him in a ravine, and he kills himself with a gun the next day. Once Nadine reaches the desert, Flagg calls her to him. She realizes that she has made a terrible mistake and tries to escape, but Flagg forces himself on her, revealing his true demonic form. Nadine is catatonic following the sexual attack by Flagg, and her hair has turned white. Flagg's men intercept Judge Farris, who is accidentally killed by one of his henchmen, Bobby Terry, before he can be tortured. Flagg tears Bobby to pieces for not following instructions. Upon returning to Las Vegas, Flagg has Dayna brought to him. He plans to torture her for information about the identity of the third spy. Flagg could see Judge Farris and Dayna with his powers, but whenever he tried to see the third spy, all he could see was the moon. After a failed attempt to kill Flagg, Dayna kills herself before he can extract any useful information from her.\n\nTom leaves Las Vegas when the moon is full, but Julie Lawry recognizes him; she tries to alert Flagg, but Tom escapes into the desert and hides from Flagg and his men. A crazed Nadine taunts Flagg, and she commits suicide by jumping off the hotel balcony with the baby he conceived in her. With winter approaching, Stu, Larry, Glen, and Ralph leave Boulder to set out on their quest. Stu breaks his leg when he falls in a dry riverbed, and must be left behind with Glen's dog, Kojak. The remaining three are captured by Flagg's forces a few days later, and Glen is separated from Larry and Ralph. Flagg orders Lloyd to kill Glen after he taunts Flagg. As Larry and Ralph endure a [[show trial]] on [[Fremont Street]], Flagg uses his powers to silence a dissenter, striking him with a ball of plasma energy emitted from his fingers. \"Trashcan Man\" arrives towing a stolen nuclear weapon with an ATV and showing signs of radiation poisoning, so Flagg orders Lloyd to kill him. Flagg is unable to stop the energy ball from transforming into a spectral hand, the Hand of God, and it detonates the nuclear bomb as the voice of Mother Abagail declares that God's promise has been kept, and she welcomes Larry and Ralph into heaven. Las Vegas is destroyed by the nuclear blast, and Flagg is apparently killed along with all of his followers.\n\nStu is rescued by Tom, and they witness the nuclear explosion together. Tom takes Stu to a nearby cabin to set his leg as winter arrives, but Stu has contracted the flu. In a dream, Nick comes to Tom and tells him which medicine to give him. Stu recovers from the infection, and the two of them return to Boulder in a snow storm via a [[Snowcat]]. Stu finds that Frannie has given birth to a daughter, whom she has named Abagail. The baby has contracted the superflu, but she is able to fight off the virus. Lucy reveals that she is pregnant with Larry's child, and Joe sees a spectral image of Mother Abagail, as she blesses the newborn baby. Assured that the immune survivors can safely reproduce, the inhabitants of Boulder set to work rebuilding the world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Stu Redman\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Frannie Goldsmith\n* [[Jamey Sheridan]] as [[Randall Flagg]]\n* [[Laura San Giacomo]] as Nadine Cross\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Mother Abagail Freemantle\n* [[Ossie Davis]] as Judge Richard Farris\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Lloyd Henreid\n* [[Corin Nemec]] as Harold Lauder\n* [[Matt Frewer]] as Trashcan Man\n* [[Adam Storke]] as Larry Underwood\n* [[Ray Walston]] as Glen Bateman\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Nick Andros\n* [[Bill Fagerbakke]] as Tom Cullen\n* [[Peter Van Norden]] as Ralph Brentner\n* Bridgit Ryan as Lucy Swann\n* [[Rick Aviles]] as Rat Man\n* [[Max Wright]] as Dr. Herbert Denninger\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as Julie Lawry\n* Cynthia Garris as Susan Stern\n* Richard Jewkes as Dick Ellis\n* [[Sarah Schaub]] as Gina McKone\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Dr. Soames\n* [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] as The Monster Shouter\n* [[Warren Frost]] as Dr. George Richardson\n* [[Joe Bob Briggs|John Bloom]] (aka Joe Bob Briggs) as Deputy Joe-Bob\n* [[Troy Evans (actor)|Troy Evans]] as Sheriff Johnny Baker\n* [[Stephen King]] as Teddy Weizak\n* [[John Landis]] as Russ Dorr\n* [[Dan Martin (actor)|Dan Martin]] as Rich Moffat\n* John Dunbar as Dave Roberts\n* [[Sam Raimi]] as Bobby Terry\n* [[Chuck Adamson]] as Barry Dorgan\n* Kellie Overbey as Dayna Jurgens\n* [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] as Charlie D.

Romero]]'s first conversations with each other were about the development of an adaptation of ''[['Salem's Lot]]'' (1975) in the late 1970s; although Romero wouldn't be involved in any adaptation of that novel, he did express interest in adapting ''The Stand'' during these discussions.{{Sfn|Gagne|1982|p=20}} While King initially didn't think of the novel being worthy of a film version,{{Sfn|Witer|1980|p=26}} Romero's reason was the amount of traveling he could do, as the novel takes place in several locations;{{Sfn|Gagne|1982|p=34}} and the story's relevance to social issues.{{Sfn|Wiater|1980|p=26}}\n\nDue to the [[Epic (genre)|epic]] style of the novel demanding a huge budget, King and Romero's primary concern was possibly having to deal with financing from [[major studio]]s, which would likely have meant losing a lot of artistic control{{Sfn|Gagne|1982|p=20}} or worsening studio reputation if the film was a box office bomb.{{Sfn|Wiater|1980|p=27}} King recalled in a 1980 interview of Hollywood middlemen being skeptical of Romero's idea of ''The Stand'' becoming a feature-length picture for the content's huge scale.{{Sfn|Wiater|1980|p=26}} There were some studios that did offer King and Romero several [[option contract]]s for adapting ''The Stand'' shortly after the novel's release, but the two turned all of them down.<ref name = \"Summer1980\"/>\n\nAt the same time, [[Laurel Entertainment]]'s [[Richard P. Rubinstein]] was also obsessed with trying to produce a film of ''The Stand'' since the book had been published in 1978, and it became Laurel's pet project throughout the adaptation's development as a theatrical production.{{Sfn|Wood|1994|p=19}} In a summer 1979 talk between Romero and Rubinstein, they came up with an idea of how to fund it independently: by producing ''[[Creepshow]]'', a low-budget original film that would create a huge profit{{Sfn|Gagne|1982|p=20}} and increase Laurel's credibility.{{Sfn|Wood|1994|p=19}} Both ''Creepshow'' and ''The Stand'' were first announced in a summer 1980 edition of ''[[Cinefantastique]]'',<ref name = \"Summer1980\">{{cite magazine|last=Gagne|first=Peter|date=Summer 1980|title=Stephen King|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|page=34|volume=10|number=1}}</ref> and King completed the first draft in early 1981.{{Sfn|Gagne|1981|p=9}}\n\n[[Warner Bros.]] initially wanted King to do a single, two-hour script, but he ended up turning in a screenplay that was over 400 pages (equivalent to six hours in length).{{Sfn|Wood|1994|p=19}} ''Creepshow'' was released in 1982 to commercial success,{{Sfn|Gagne|1982|p=34}} and ''The Stand'' project garnered the interest of Warner Bros., a company that placed it into development.{{Sfn|Wood|1994|p=19}} The budget for ''The Stand'' was set around $15\u201325 million just after ''Creepshow''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release.{{Sfn|Gagne|1982|p=34}}\n\nAs of September 1982, King had completed two drafts of ''The Stand''.{{Sfn|Gagne|1982|p=20}} The second draft planned for it to be a two-film series with each movie being two hours.{{Sfn|Gagne|1982|p=20}} However, Laurel, by the completion of King's third draft in December 1983, switched the plan to one three-hour film.{{Sfn|Gagne|1982|p=20}}<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Gagne|first=Paul|date=December 1983|title=Trick or Treat|magazine=Cinefantastique|page=14|volume=14|number=2}}</ref>\n\n[[Dario Argento]] stated in a 1983 interview that he was once approached to direct a film version of ''The Stand'' but rejected the offer due to a lack of interest in working on adaptations.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Jones|first=Alan|date=September 1983|title=Argento|magazine=Cinefantastique|page=21|volume=14|number=1}}</ref>\n\nKing completed the final draft circa 1986.<ref name = \"1988cine\"/> Despite Romero's initial excitement,{{Sfn|Gagne|1982|p=34}} he grew increasingly distant from the project due to the poor box office performance of King films in the 1980s and conflicts between him and Rubinstein leading him to leave Laurel.<ref name = \"1988cine\">{{cite magazine|last=C.

one of these was an adaptation of ''The Stand'', which was reported in a January 1990 ''Cinefantastique'' article to be \"the most anticipated\" developing King project.<ref name = \"CineJan1990\">{{cite magazine|last=Wood|first=Gary|date=January 1990 |title=Stephen King Strikes Back!|magazine=Cinefantastique|page=4|volume=20|number=3}}</ref> Stephen King's most popular novel among fans,{{Sfn|Warren|1994b|p=41\u201342}} ''The Stand'' was controversial as a film adaptation from the beginning.{{Sfn|Warren|1994b|p=40}} Nevertheless, King began working on a screenplay based on the book for Rubinstein.{{Sfn|Warren|1994b|p=41}}\n\nKing wrote a 700-page screenplay and then made five attempts to condense it into a 130-page script.<ref name = \"CineJan1990\"/>{{Sfn|Warren|1994a|p=29}} Rubinstein disliked King's drafts, suggesting the author knew the novel too closely.{{Sfn|Warren|1994b|p=41}} Thus, he hired [[Rospo Pallenberg]] for screenwriting duties and planned for [[John Boorman]] to direct.{{Sfn|Warren|1994a|p=29}} Rubinstein and Laurel were very serious about the project to the point where they paid Pallenberg $30,000 for just one treatment.<ref name = \"CineJan1990\"/> However, nothing further materialized.{{Sfn|Warren|1994b|p=42}} As King put it simply, there was \"too much story for a movie,\" and yet he was skeptical about making a TV version of the book because \"you can't have the end of the world brought to you by [[Charmin]] toilet tissue.\"{{Sfn|Warren|1994a|p=29}}\n\n===As a television miniseries===\nIn June 1992,{{Sfn|Warren|1994b|p=42}} King figured that a miniseries was a way to present most of the novel's contents without having to deal with the other broadcast Standards and Practices regular television shows face.{{Sfn|Warren|1994a|p=29}} He spent four months writing a 420-page first draft{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=9}} without using his or Pallenberg's theatrical film drafts as reference.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=8}} He submitted the draft to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which offered King the ability for the script to be produced just days after submission.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=9}} The network also had to follow conditions that it couldn't throw so many Standards and Practices at him that it would ruin the spirit of the source material.{{Sfn|Warren|1994b|p=42}}\n\nWorried about not disappointing fans, King took six months just to write one draft, \"and then there were two more.\"{{Sfn|Warren|1994b|p=40}} King wrote six drafts of the miniseries before production began.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=9}} Only minor changes were made in writing the miniseries,{{Sfn|Warren|1994a|p=29\u201330}} and while it is not based on the 1990 expanded version of the novel, the first scenes of the miniseries are taken from that edition.{{Sfn|Warren|1994a|p=29}} ABC still had discussions with King and Garris about certain plot elements likely not following practices, such as the use of a mummified child doll, a man on a cross wearing a crown of drug needles with the sign \"Drug Addict\" on his neck,{{Sfn|Warren|1994b|p=43}} and open-eyed corpses.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=18}} A lot of these, however, were kept in the final product because of expectations from fans of ''The Stand''.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=18}}\n\nWhile ABC and Rubinstein suggested [[Brian De Palma]] to direct ''The Stand'', King chose [[Mick Garris]] after viewing his work for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990) and the [[Sleepwalkers (1992 film)|1992 film version of King's ''Sleepwalkers'']].{{Sfn|Warren|1994|p=44}} King thought the director was good at just being a \"medium\" that did not alter the story's original message.{{Sfn|Warren|1994b|p=44}} King told Garris about the project while both were on the set on ''Sleepwalkers'', and Garris signed on due to the content's unusual fantasy elements and the large scale of the production he would be dealing with, such as in effects, outdoor locations, action sequences, and the number of extras.{{Sfn|Warren|1994a|p=32}}\n\n===Casting===\nDespite the script's 125-plus speaking roles,{{Sfn|Warren|1994a|p=29}} casting for ''The Stand'' was very easy except for one character: [[Randall Flagg]].{{Sfn|Warren|1994a|p=30}} While [[Miguel Ferrer]], who played Lloyd Henreid, was interested in the part,<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Garris and King had other plans, searching for any A-list Hollywood actor they thought was suitable for the part, such as [[Christopher Walken]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[James Woods]], [[Lance Henriksen]], and [[David Bowie]];

Evans|Colorado Amendment 2]], which nullified local gay rights laws, protests<ref>Dusty Saundes. \"Amendment 2 Drives Film's Makers Away\" ''Rocky Mountain News'', May 8, 1994</ref> as well as the production team not morally agreeing with the Amendment led them not to shoot there.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=20}} Shooting was moved to Utah, a state that had many Stephen King fans and religious people that related to the themes of the original novel, and four months of filming was done in Utah locations during what would be the state's bitterest winter in 100 years.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=20}} The interior shots were done first with the plan that the snow will [[thaw (weather)|melt]] later on, only for that not to happen.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=21}} This resulted in shots that featured weather not originally planned to be part of the plot, which worked in favor of some sequences in Garris's opinion.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=21}}\n\nFor filming the gas station scene, they had to deal with freezing cold rain.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=21}} There were supposed to be close-up shots of Stu Redman being still, but it was impossible for Sinise to not shake from the cold weather.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=21}} Thus, the close-up shots were rejected.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=21}} It was also tough for Sinise to deliver lines in filming days following the shoot.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=21}} The harsh weather also caused another unforeseen problem. Faced with prices of $40 per stalk for New York-made fake cornstalks, Coates opted instead to grow 3,250 cornstalks as a cost-cutting measure; when a winter storm hit Utah, the reproduction of a Nebraska house with cornfield became complicated by the fact that the harsh weather did not allow the corn crop to grow taller than 4 feet.<ref name=\"5points\">Michael Booth. \"5 Points a star: Hollywood action invades Denver neighborhood\", ''The Denver Post'', August 27, 1994, page A1.</ref>\n\nThe jail sequences were shot for three days at the sex offender wing of the [[Utah State Prison]].{{Sfn|Beeler|1994b|p=16}} However, the effects crew who were working on dead body dummies in the cells were unaware of this on the first day of shooting at the location and assumed it was an unused wing.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994b|p=16}} The prison actually moved the sex offenders out of their cells for the miniseries, but the prisoners' belongings were left in the cells only for members of the effects team to confuse them as props by the art directors.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994b|p=16\u201317}} On the first shooting day, the effects people moved all of the props from one cell to another; the next day, several letters were written by prisoners and attached to their respective cells, ranging from angry responses to bids for King to sign an autograph.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994b|p=17}}\n\nThe miniseries was then shot in [[Las Vegas]] following the Utah shoots.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=11}}\n\n===Effects===\n{{blockquote|I just wanted to do the best possible job I could because I really wanted to do justice to the material.

he described it as \"a dream come true\" to work with King on set.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994b|p=16}}\n\nJohnson's team [[XFX]] did Abagail's age makeup, Flagg's demonic heads, the Trashcan Man's burn make-up, 60 dummies of the dead bodies, and facial hair controlled with [[electrostatics]].{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=11}} The corpses of the flu victims were intended to be dummies rather than \"[[movie monster]][s],\" Garris described.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=22}} [[Bill Corso]], a member of the effects team for ''The Stand'', voices two of the corpses.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=22}}\n\n====Randall Flagg====\nTo work with Sheridan's clean-cut look in working on Randall Flagg's normal make-up, Johnson came up with the idea of adding a longer hair wig for a more abrasive look.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}}\n\nThe source material's religious elements were referred to when designing Flagg's demon incarnations.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}} According to writer Michael Beeler, Flagg's goat head was a \"traditional concept of what evil in human form would be.\"{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}} In order for the ram horns to glow, they were made out of translucent substance with illumination coming from a [[backlight]].{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}} For Flagg's hands, the effects team went for a recurring theme of eccentricities in how they worked, such as the extending of a third finger for symbolizing the devil's existence.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}} In the scene where Flagg raises his fist at Abagail, the original screenplay presented him as having it clenched throughout; however, Johnson came up with a representation of [[Stigmata]] by first showing Flagg's palm with blood spewing out and then clenching it into a fist.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}} The split-second shot of Flagg's fingers flexing backwards was done with the hand palm up, but the actor wore an appliance for a palm down illusion.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}}\n\nFor the scarecrow form, Johnson was initially skeptical to create one due to the idea of it being \"kind of silly\" and attempted to persuade Garris not to include it.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}} The two ultimately decided to produce a \"rotted\" version of the scarecrow, meaning the stitching of the fabric, as Beeler put it, \"makes it appear as if it has scars all across its face that are coming apart at the seams with dust and sawdust falling out whenever it speaks.\"{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}} Johnson later admitted that the scarecrow was his favorite Flagg incarnation of the miniseries.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}} For a [[silhouette]] shot of the scarecrow in the cornfield, the shape of the character's eyes and mouth are indicated through a glowing effect.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}} The radiating contact lens used on the eyes were previously made by XFX for the film ''[[Innocent Blood (film)|Innocent Blood]]'' (1992);{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14}} while a [[LED|light-emitting diode]] palate for the mouth was created by [[Rick Baker]] colleague Mark Setraikien and triggered via wires under Sheridan's make-up.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=14, 17}}\n\nXFX members came up with multiple concepts for the scarecrow's hair, Johnson suggesting a set of mushrooms, flowers, and moss growing around it.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=17}} He also thought of worms and cockroaches crawling in the hair for close-up shots; however, when they were placed on Sheridan's hair during a test, the actor freaked out and Johnson thought it \"wouldn't have read on film anyway.\"{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=17}} The final result was that the hair was made of \"muddy, twisted roots growing out of his head\" which Johnson thought \"looked the creepiest.\"{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=17}}\n\nWhile Tom Barham of New York's Image Group company handled the morphing FX, Garris came up with the idea of having Flagg's head morph executed in a way different from the traditional media morph of one head design just melting into another: inside out.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=22}} Not only was it different, but also a way to work around the limited budget as the morphing could look \"active\" without the camera having to move.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=22}} In creating Flagg's morphs, the actor first filmed the scene on set without his makeup on.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=22}} Then, on a [[greenscreen]] stage in [[Las Vegas]], he was filmed doing the exact same action with makeup on, the camera set at precisely the same angle and character distance as the original shot.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=22}} Both shots were then combined in post-production.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=22}} The green-screening technique was done due to the amount of time it took to get Flagg's make-up on, which was at minimum three hours.{{Sfn|Bernstein|1994|p=22}}\n\n====Trashcan Man====\nSix stages of burn make-up were placed on Frewer, such as when the Trashcan Man is burned by an oil factory explosion, a really hot desert sun, and radiation from an atomic bomb.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=18}}\n\n====Facial hair====\nThe growing facial hair effect seen on the extras was done by Camille Calvetty through a technique involving [[electrostatic charge]]s; on each actor, she would first put adhesive all throughout the face, then trim the hair \"to the right length\" for it to be placed in a device that grows the hair through an electric charger.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=17}} While this technique had been done on past films and television series, ''The Stand'' was the first ever production that involved it being applied to several extras.{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=17}} The varying amount of loose hair and make-up on each extra complicated the process according to Johnson: \"You don't have a lot of control. So it takes an incredible amount of maintenance and a lot of patience to keep it looking good.\"{{Sfn|Beeler|1994a|p=17\u201318}}\n\n==Releases==\n\n===Original broadcast===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n! style=\"background:#333;\"| Part\n! style=\"background:#333;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#333;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#333;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#333;\"| Original air date<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title =The Plague\n |WrittenBy = [[Stephen King]] \n |DirectedBy = [[Mick Garris]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1994|5|8}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 333333\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title =The Dreams\n |WrittenBy = Stephen King\n |DirectedBy = Mick Garris \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1994|5|9}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 333333\n}}{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title =The Betrayal\n |WrittenBy = Stephen King\n |DirectedBy = Mick Garris \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1994|5|11}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 333333\n}}{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title =The Stand\n |WrittenBy = Stephen King\n |DirectedBy = Mick Garris \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1994|5|12}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 333333\n}}\n|}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n<!-- See [[Template:Tracklist]] if you want to improve this section --> \n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Stephen King's ''The Stand'' (Original Television Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| longtype   = ([[Music download|Digital download]])/Audio CD\n| artist     = [[W.
