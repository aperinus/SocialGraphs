Sandberg]], written by [[Gary Dauberman]] and produced by [[Peter Safran]] and [[James Wan]]. It is a [[prequel]] to 2014's ''[[Annabelle (film)|Annabelle]]'' and the fourth installment in [[The Conjuring Universe|''The Conjuring'' Universe]] franchise. The film stars [[Stephanie Sigman]], [[Talitha Bateman]], [[Anthony LaPaglia]], and [[Miranda Otto]], and depicts the possessed [[Annabelle (doll)|Annabelle doll]]'s origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/annabelle-2-trailer-teaser/ |title=Annabelle 2 \u2013 Trailer Teaser |first=Haleigh |last=Foutch |website=Collider.com |date=March 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2015, it was confirmed that an ''Annabelle'' sequel was in development; it was later revealed that the film would be a prequel rather than a sequel. ''[[Lights Out (2016 film)|Lights Out]]'' director David F. Sandberg replaced Leonetti as director, with Dauberman returning to write the script and Safran and Wan returning to produce. [[Principal photography]] began on June 27, 2016, in [[Los Angeles]], California, and concluded on August 15, 2016.\n\n''Annabelle: Creation'' premiered at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival|LA Film Festival]] on June 19, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 11, 2017. The film grossed over $306{{nbsp}}million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, who noted it as an improvement over its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/annabelle-creation-is-a-potent-prequel/ |title=Annabelle: Creation is a Potent Prequel |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=August 10, 2017 |access-date=August 11, 2017}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Annabelle Comes Home]]'', was released on June 26, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nA dollmaker named Samuel Mullins and his wife Esther grieve for the loss of their seven-year-old daughter Annabelle, nicknamed \"Bee\", who dies when she accidentally steps in front of a car.\n\nTwelve years later, the Mullins open their home to provide shelter for Sister Charlotte and six girls left homeless by the closing of their orphanage. Despite having been warned to avoid Bee's locked bedroom, Janice, a young orphan disabled by [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], discovers a note saying \"Find me\" and sneaks into the room, which has mysteriously become unlocked. She finds a key for Bee's closet and opens it, where she sees an eerie porcelain doll. This unwittingly releases a powerful demon that begins to terrorize the girls.\n\nOne night, the demon, taking Bee's form, appears to Janice, saying that it wants her soul. Although she attempts to get away using a [[stairlift]], the demon recalls the stairlift and hurls her violently down to the ground floor, leaving her severely injured and confined to a wheelchair. Janice's best friend Linda is tormented by the demon. One morning, the demon, posing as Sister Charlotte, wheels Janice into the old barn, where, in the form of Bee, it attacks and possesses her after throwing up black bile directly into Janice's mouth. Linda notices changes in Janice's behavior and tells Samuel that Janice snuck into Bee's room and found the doll. Samuel trusts Linda. Janice, who can now walk, transforms into the demon and brutally kills Samuel who follows her while holding a crucifix, forcing him to drop it. Outside, Sister Charlotte hears his screams and is horrified to find him dead.\n\nLinda takes Janice's doll and throws it into the well. A strange noise comes from the well and she is almost dragged into it, but Sister Charlotte saves her. Alarmed, Sister Charlotte speaks with the disfigured Esther, who is confined to her bedroom. Esther explains that after Bee's death, they prayed to whatever entity would grant their wish to see their daughter again. An unknown entity answered their prayer and though they briefly saw Bee's spirit, the entity convinced them to transfer its essence into one of Samuel's crafted dolls. They happily agreed but soon realized they had attracted a demon looking for a human host. One night, Esther saw Bee's spirit transforming into the demon, which then gouged out her eye. Enlisting the help of priests to bless the house, they locked the doll in Bee's closet. Esther and Samuel opened their house as a shelter to repent for their actions, but Esther now regrets it since this has provided an opportunity for the demon to look for a human host.\n\nThe demon murders Esther and attacks Sister Charlotte. The orphans leave the house, but Linda is trapped and hides in Bee's room as the possessed Janice tries to stab her. Sister Charlotte locks Janice and the doll inside the closet. The next day, police arrive to search the house and find only the doll, which they remove as evidence. Sister Charlotte, Linda, and the orphans are escorted away by officers, while Janice escapes through a hole in the closet wall and relocates to an orphanage in [[Santa Monica]]. Still possessed, she becomes reclusive and calls herself Annabelle. Pete and Sharon Higgins soon adopt Annabelle.\n\nTwelve years later, after being involved in devil worship, a grown-up Annabelle returns home and murders her adoptive parents, [[Annabelle (film)|awakening Mia Form, who warns John about Sharon Higgins's screams]].\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Talitha Bateman and Lulu Wilson talk about Annabelle Creation.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Talitha Bateman]] (left) and [[Lulu Wilson]] (right) discuss ''Annabelle: Creation'' in 2017]]\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Stephanie Sigman]] as Sister Charlotte, the mother figure to the orphans.\n* [[Talitha Bateman]] as Janice, one of younger orphans who is disabled due to suffering from polio prior to the events of the film\n** Tree O'Toole as adult Janice / Annabelle Higgins\n* [[Lulu Wilson]] as Linda, Janice's best friend, who tries to help her feel better about her polio \n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Samuel Mullins, Bee's father and Esther's husband\n* [[Miranda Otto]] as Esther Mullins, Bee's mother and Samuel's wife\n** Alicia Vela-Bailey as evil Esther Mullins\n* [[Grace Fulton]] as Carol, one of the older orphans who likes to tease Linda and Janice\n* [[Philippa Coulthard]] as Nancy, Carol's best friend\n* Samara Lee as Annabelle \"Bee\" Mullins, Samuel and Esther's deceased daughter, who dies in a car accident\n* Tayler Buck as Kate\n* Lou Lou Safran as Tierney\n* Mark Bramhall as Father Massey\n* [[Adam Bartley]] as Officer Fuller\n* [[Lotta Losten]] as the adoption agent \n* [[Joseph Bishara]] as Annabelle Demon\n** [[Fred Tatasciore]] as the voice of Demon\n* [[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]] as Pete Higgins\n* Kerry O'Malley as Sharon Higgins\n* [[Brad Greenquist]] as Victor Palmeri \n{{div col end}}\n\nAdditionally, [[Annabelle Wallis]] and [[Ward Horton]] appear in archive footage from ''[[Annabelle (film)|Annabelle]]'' as Mia and John Form, respectively,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leadbeater |first1=Alex |title=Annabelle: Creation Ending & Post-Credits Scenes Explained |url=https://screenrant.com/annabelle-creation-post-credits-scenes-ending-explained-nun-movie/2/ |website=[[Screen Rant]] |access-date=September 3, 2018 |date=August 11, 2017}}</ref> and [[Bonnie Aarons]] reprises her role from ''[[The Conjuring 2]]'' as the demon nun [[Valac|Valak]] in an uncredited appearance.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fletcher |first1=Rosie |last2=Armitage |first2=Hugh |title=The Conjuring Universe explained \u2013 The Conjuring 3, Annabelle, The Nun, The Crooked Man and more |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/the-conjuring/feature/a846502/conjuring-universe-conjuring-3-annabelle-the-nun-the-crooked-man/ |access-date=September 3, 2018 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=August 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn October 2015, it was confirmed that an ''Annabelle'' sequel was in development.<ref name=\"Annabelle2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/annabelle-2/ |title='Annabelle 2' is on the Way, So Burn Your Doll Collection Now |website=[[/Film]] |first=Jacob |last=Hall |date=October 19, 2015}}</ref> [[David F.
