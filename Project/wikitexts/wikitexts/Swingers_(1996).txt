The film was honored on the 2007 [[Spike TV Guys' Choice Awards]].

To help Mike with his depression, his womanizing friend Trent and some other aspiring actor friends try and get him back into the social scene.\n\nThe movie opens with Mike telling his friend Rob about how desperately he misses Michelle and that she has not called him. Rob explains that \"somehow\" women \"know\" not to call their ex-boyfriends until they have completely moved on from them.\n\nTo help Mike recover, Trent coaxes him into an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. Trent succeeds in picking up two waitresses, but his obsession with Michelle ruins Trent's plans. The women seem interested, but Mike spoils the mood, telling his date about her.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, Mike, Rob and other friends golf, play video games, and go out. All of them trying to make it in the entertainment industry. Then they go bar hopping, stopping at a party, and later an after-hours spot, where Trent demonstrates his prowess in handling the opposite sex. Inspired by this, Mike meets a woman named Nikki and gets her phone number. His friends insist he wait two days minimum before calling.\n\nBack at his apartment, however, he leaves a series of increasingly anxious and desperate messages on Nikki's answering machine in the middle of the night, until she picks up the phone and disgustedly orders him not to call her again. Missing Michelle more than ever, he contemplates moving back to New York until Rob comes over and consoles him.\n\nOut again for swing night at [[Brown Derby#Los Feliz Brown Derby|The Derby]], Mike spots a woman named Lorraine. He summons all his courage to approach and connect with her. They both recently broke off relationships and moved to LA, and dance well together.\n\nThe following morning, Mike receives a call from Michelle, and finds that he no longer misses her. When Lorraine calls him, Mike cuts off his call with Michelle mid sentence saying she loves him, to further things with Lorraine. Like him, she disregarded friends' advice to wait days before calling.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Mike Peters, a struggling comedian from [[New York City]], recently broken up from his longtime girlfriend. New to Los Angeles.\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Trent Walker, an aspiring actor, Mike's closest friend, and a confident swinger. \n* [[Ron Livingston]] as Rob, Mike's friend from New York, a struggling actor and a recent arrival to Los Angeles.\n* [[Patrick Van Horn]] as Sue, an irritable swinger who is named after the Johnny Cash song \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\". Trent's roommate. \n* [[Alex D\u00e9sert]] as Charles, an acquaintance of the group and another struggling actor. \n* [[Heather Graham]] as Lorraine, a woman Mike meets at a bar\n* [[Brooke Langton]] as Nikki, another woman Mike meets at another bar\n* [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]] as Derby Band\n* [[Ahmed Ahmed]] as Party Mystery Guy\n* [[Stephen Gaghan]] as Onlooker at Model Party Entrance (uncredited)\n* [[Roger Kumble]] as Partygoer (uncredited)\n* [[Mike White (filmmaker)|Mike White]] as Partygoer (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Jon Favreau-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Favreau wrote and starred in ''Swingers''.]]\n\n===Development===\nFavreau wrote the screenplay for ''Swingers'' in about two weeks. His father had given him a screenwriting program on a computer and he wanted to see if he could make a screenplay \"just as an exercise\". He had moved from Chicago and had also broken up with his girlfriend there, but the stories and events he wrote in were fictional. He had characters that he loosely based on friends, and used fellow actors for the key parts. He had become friends with Vaughn from the 1993 film ''[[Rudy (film)|Rudy]]'', a movie they had acted in together. He had known Livingston from Chicago and their work at [[iO Theater|ImprovOlympic]], and that they moved to Los Angeles around the same time.<ref name=\"grantland\"/>\n\nDuring the time Favreau was trying to raise production money, some of the producers wanted to change the character of Trent to a woman, to not go to Vegas, and to make it darker and more violent. Others wanted to cast more notable actors like [[Johnny Depp]] or [[Chris O'Donnell]], but Favreau declined those ideas despite trying hard to embrace them. Favreau and his friends gave [[Reader's Theatre|reader's theater]] performances of the script to drum up interest in and capital for the movie. Nicole LaLoggia, who knew of Favreau when the latter read for the film ''[[Getting In]]'', agreed to work on the film. Her roommate, [[Doug Liman]], secured production money from his father's business associate on the condition that Liman direct the film.<ref name=\"grantland\"/><ref name=\"nymag\">{{cite news|last=Fishman|first=Steve|url=https://nymag.com/news/features/42823/|title= The Liman Identity|website=New York Magazine|date=January 11, 2008|access-date=November 30, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the film was partly inspired by the Swingers Diner on Beverly Boulevard, a coffee shop that Liman and Favreau frequented.<ref name=\"laweekly locations\"/><ref name=\"lamag iconic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/find-iconic-l-diners-film-tv/|title=Where to Find the Most Iconic L.A.
