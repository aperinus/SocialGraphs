It is an [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of the 1998 [[About a Boy (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Nick Hornby]]. The film stars [[Hugh Grant]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Toni Collette]], and [[Rachel Weisz]]. The film at times uses double [[voice-over]] narration, when the audience hears alternately Will's and Marcus's thoughts.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on 26 April 2002 by [[Universal Pictures]]. It was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. Actors Hugh Grant and Toni Collette were nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]], respectively, for their performances. The film received positive reviews from critics and earned $130.5 million against a $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nWill Freeman lives a carefree lifestyle without any responsibility or commitments, thanks to [[Royalty payment|royalties]] left to him by his father's successful Christmas song. Will joins the Single Parents Alone Together (SPAT) community group under the pretense that he is the father to an imaginary child, but instead aims to meet single mothers. Will meets Suzie who he is attracted to but also meets Marcus, the [[socially awkward]] son of one of Suzie's friends unexpectedly on a planned play-date. When Will and Suzie take Marcus home, they find Marcus' mother Fiona (who suffers bouts of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]) has attempted suicide and rush to get her to the hospital in time.\n\nMarcus soon discovers that Will's imaginary son does not exist, and uses it as leverage by blackmailing Will to go out with his mother as he wants to ensure Fiona doesn't get depressed again. Though Will shows no interest in Fiona, he begins to bond with Marcus and ultimately matures as an adult as a result. Will helps Marcus to establish confidence, but this plan soon backfires, and Marcus accidentally reveals that Will is not a parent. Fiona confronts Will and demands an explanation. Will retorts that he is only building confidence in the boy because he is routinely humiliated and [[bullied]] at school. Though Will promises to cease further contact with Marcus, Fiona recognizes that Will's genuine interest in her son is good for both of them.\n\nWill joins Marcus and Fiona for [[Christmas]], giving Marcus a [[Shake Ya Ass|Mystikal]] album as well as a portable [[CD player]]. During an exchange with Suzie who knows by now of Will's earlier deception, Marcus stands up for Will, and in turn, also stands up to Fiona's confrontational methods. Will defuses the situation, citing an earlier incident where Marcus accidentally killed a [[duck]] with his mother's [[cottage loaf]]. Marcus invites Will to Christmas dinner, and Will genuinely enjoys his day with Marcus' family. As Marcus develops his first crush at school (Ellie), Will also meets Rachel, who he hits it off with, and for the first time in his dating life, he begins to develop a serious interest in a woman. When Rachel begins to lose interest in Will as he describes his lifestyle, he brings up Marcus, and she responds as she is a single mother and believes Marcus is Will's son. Will fails to correct her, and asks Marcus to pose as his son for a while. Marcus eventually encourages Will to tell the truth, but when Will does so and admits the truth to Rachel, it does not have the effect Will had expected, and the relationship ends.\n\nFiona's depression returns, and Marcus goes to Will for help. Will, however, is still upset over his break-up and lashes out at Marcus. He soon finds his previous life of self-dependence unfulfilling, missing the company Marcus provided. Will decides to reconcile with Marcus and talks to Fiona about her depression, but then finds out from her that Marcus is due to perform at a school talent show that night, which would ultimately result in him being humiliated for the rest of his school life. As expected, Marcus' performance is greeted with brutal mockery, but Will joins in with a [[guitar]], ultimately saving him from total humiliation.\n\nBy the next Christmas, Will and Rachel reconcile, with Will having abandoned his previous lifestyle permanently. Will invites one of his [[Amnesty International]] colleagues to set him up with Fiona, and Marcus and Ellie remain good friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Will Freeman\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as Marcus Brewer\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Fiona Brewer\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as Rachel\n* [[Natalia Tena]] as Ellie\n* [[Sharon Small]] as Christine\n* Nicholas Hutchinson as John\n* [[Victoria Smurfit]] as Suzie\n* Isabel Brook as Angie\n* [[Jenny Galloway]] as Frances / SPAT\n* [[Augustus Prew]] as Ali\n* Denise Stephenson as Lindsey\n* [[Rosalind Knight]] as Lindsey's mum\n* [[Sir Tim Rice]] as himself\n* [[Jason Salkey]] as [[Amnesty International]] worker\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released theatrically on 26 April 2002 by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], and on DVD and VHS on 2 December 2002 by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|About a Boy (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack composed by singer-songwriter [[Badly Drawn Boy]] was released on 23 April 2002.

Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s [[Owen Gleiberman]] took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it \"looked good on him.\"<ref name=\"EWBoy\" /> He added that Grant's \"pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency.\"<ref name=\"EWBoy\">{{Cite news | last = Gleiberman | first = Owen | author-link = Owen Gleiberman | title = Review: About A Boy | newspaper = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 15 May 2002 | access-date = 7 December 2012 | url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,237958,00.html | archive-date = 3 May 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130503003437/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,237958,00.html | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n|-\n| [[75th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]\n| [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]\n|rowspan=2| [[Chris Weitz]], [[Paul Weitz (filmmaker)|Paul Weitz]] and [[Peter Hedges]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[56th British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Awards]]\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]\n| [[Toni Collette]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[60th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]]\n| [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]]\n| \n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Musical or Comedy]]\n| [[Hugh Grant]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|About a Boy (film)|About a Boy}}\n* {{official website|http://www.about-a-boy.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0276751}}\n* {{AllMovie title|261808}}\n* {{British Comedy Guide|film|about_a_boy|About a Boy}}\n* {{Mojo title|aboutaboy}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|about_a_boy}}\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1959728.stm BBC News 2002: About a Boy storms to top]\n\n{{Chris Weitz}}\n{{Paul Weitz}}\n{{Nick Hornby}}\n{{Peter Hedges}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:About A Boy (Film)}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2002 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Nick Hornby]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Chris Weitz]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paul Weitz]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Eric Fellner]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert De Niro]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Tim Bevan]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Chris Weitz]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Weitz]]\n[[Category:Films about mother\u2013son relationships]]\n[[Category:StudioCanal films]]\n[[Category:Working Title Films films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
