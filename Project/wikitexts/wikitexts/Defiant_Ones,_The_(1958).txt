It stars [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Sidney Poitier]].\n\nThe film was adapted by [[Harold Jacob Smith]] from the story by [[Nedrick Young]], originally credited as Nathan E. Douglas. It was produced and directed by [[Stanley Kramer]].\n\nThe film was highly regarded at the time of its release; it won [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematography (Black-and-White)]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Original Screenplay]] and was nominated for seven others, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for both Poitier and Curtis. Poitier won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actor]] at the [[8th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nOne night in the [[Southern United States]], a truck loaded with prisoners swerves to avoid another truck and crashes through a barrier. The rescuers clear up the debris and discover two prisoners have escaped, a black man shackled to a white man because \"the warden had a sense of humor.\" They are told not to look too hard as \"they will probably kill each other in the first five miles.\" Nevertheless, a large [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] and many [[bloodhound]]s are dispatched the next morning to find them. The two missing men are Noah Cullen and John \"Joker\" Jackson. Despite their mutual hatred, they are forced to cooperate, as they are chained together. At first their cooperation is motivated by self-preservation, but gradually they begin to respect and like each other.\n\nCullen and Joker flee through difficult terrain and weather, with a brief stop at a turpentine [[Company town|camp]] where they attempt to break into a general store, in hopes of obtaining food and tools to break the chain. Instead, they are captured by the inhabitants, who form a lynch mob; they are saved only by the interference of \"Big\" Sam, a man who is appalled by his neighbors' bloodthirst. Sam persuades the onlookers to lock the convicts up and turn them in the next morning. That night, he secretly releases them, being a former chain-gang prisoner himself.\n\nFinally, they run into a young boy named Billy. They make him take them to his home and his mother, whose husband has abandoned his family. The escapees are finally able to break their chains. When they spend the night there, the lonely woman is attracted to Joker and wants to run off with him. She advises Cullen to go through the swamp to reach the railroad tracks, while she and Joker will drive off in her car. However, after Cullen leaves, the woman reveals that she had lied: she has sent Cullen into the dangerous swamp to die, to eliminate any chance he would be captured and reveal where Joker had gone. Furious, Joker runs after his friend; as he leaves, Billy shoots him.\n\nWounded, Joker catches up with Cullen and warns him about the swamp. The posse led by humane sheriff Max Muller gets close. The two hear a train whistle and run toward it. Cullen catches up to the train and jumps aboard. Joker runs alongside, desperately trying to catch up. Cullen calls to Joker and holds out his hand. Their hands clasp, but Cullen is unable to pull Joker aboard. Both men tumble to the ground. Too exhausted to run, they realize all they can do is wait for their pursuers. The sheriff finds Cullen singing defiantly and Joker lying in his arms.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Tony Curtis-Sidney Poitier in The Defiant Ones trailer.jpg|thumb|Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier in the trailer for the film]]\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Noah Cullen\n* [[Tony Curtis]] as John \u201cJoker\u201d Jackson\n* [[Theodore Bikel]] as Sheriff Max Muller\n* [[Charles McGraw]] as Captain Frank Gibbons\n* [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as Big Sam\n* [[King Donovan]] as Solly\n* [[Claude Akins]] as Mack\n* [[Lawrence Dobkin]] as Editor\n* [[Whit Bissell]] as Lou Gans\n* [[Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer|Carl Switzer]] as Angus (final film role)\n* Kevin Coughlin as Billy\n* [[Cara Williams]] as Billy's mother\n\n==Production==\n[[Robert Mitchum]], a veteran of a Southern chain gang, turned down the role of Jackson because blacks and whites would never be chained together in the segregated South. The story was corrupted into the claim - repeated by Curtis and others - that Mitchum refused to work with a black man. Kramer wrote that Poitier was initially unsure of Curtis' casting but became supportive. Curtis, however, denied this; he stated that he had contractual rights to approve who would play Cullen. However, despite Curtis' many later claims and stories, Kramer had originally cast Poitier and [[Marlon Brando]] as the two leads when a previous contractual obligation prevented Poitier from being able to accept the role. Kramer wanted Poitier for the role so badly that he delayed the film's production, which led to Brando having to decline because the delay caused shooting to overlap with another obligation. Curtis was cast afterwards. Curtis did request [[billing (filmmaking)#Main billing|Poitier's name appear with his]] above the movie title marking a first for Poitier in his career.<ref name=\"tcmcurtis\">''Private Screenings: Tony Curtis''.

It was his last before his death.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film earned rentals of $2.5 million in the United States and Canada but did not perform as well overseas.<ref name=rentals/> It ultimately made a profit of $1 million.<ref name=\"tino\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nWhen the film was original released, [[Bosley Crowther]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', lauded the production and the acting in the film, writing, \"A remarkably apt and dramatic visualization of a social idea\u2014the idea of men of different races brought together to face misfortune in a bond of brotherhood\u2014is achieved by producer Stanley Kramer in his new film, ''The Defiant Ones''...&nbsp;Between the two principal performers there isn't much room for a choice. Mr. Poitier stands out as the Negro convict and Mr. Curtis is surprisingly good. Both men are intensely dynamic. Mr. Poitier shows a deep and powerful strain of underlying compassion...In the ranks of the pursuers, Theodore Bikel is most impressive as a sheriff with a streak of mercy and justice, which he has to fight to maintain against a brutish state policeman, played by Charles McGraw.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE0D61430E73BBC4D51DFBF668383649EDE Crowther, Bosley].  ''[[The New York Times]]'', film review, September 25, 1958. Last accessed: February 23, 2011.</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine likewise praised the acting and discussed the film's major theme, writing, \"The theme of ''The Defiant Ones'' is that what keeps men apart is their lack of knowledge of one another. With that knowledge comes respect, and with respect comradeship and even love. This thesis is exercised in terms of a colored and a white man, both convicts chained together as they make their break for freedom from a Southern prison gang. The performances by Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier are virtually flawless. Poitier captures all of the moody violence of the convict, serving time because he assaulted a white man who had insulted him. It is a cunning, totally intelligent portrayal that rings powerfully true...Curtis delivers a true surprise performance. He starts off as a sneering, brutal character, willing to fight it out to-the-death with his equally stubborn companion. When, in the end, he sacrifices a dash for freedom to save Poitier, by saving him from the swamp, he has managed the transition with such skill that sympathy is completely with him.\"<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790341?refcatid=31 ''Variety''], film review, September 24, 1958.

Defiant Ones'' was revisited several times in popular media:\n\n* [[Lenny Bruce]] parodied the film in his bit The Defiant Ones from his album ''I Am Not A Nut, Elect Me''.\n* [[Warner Bros.]] [[parody|parodied]] the film in [[Friz Freleng]]'s 1961 cartoon ''[[D' Fightin' Ones]]'', in which [[Sylvester the Cat]] escapes from captivity in a dogcatcher truck while chained to a [[bulldog]].\n* On his 1964 debut LP, [[Godfrey Cambridge]] parodied the film, re-writing the final scene so that Cullen makes it onto the train without his white companion, to which Cullen (played by Cambridge) says, \"Byeeee, baby...!\"\n* In 1972, the story changed the gender of the protagonists in the film ''[[Black Mama White Mama]],'' starring [[Pam Grier]] and [[Margaret Markov]].\n* Another 1972 [[B-movie]] added a [[science fiction]] [[blaxploitation]] twist as ''[[The Thing with Two Heads]]'', in which a [[racist]] white man (played by [[Ray Milland]]) has his head [[grafting|grafted]] onto the body of a living black man (played by [[Rosey Grier]]).\n* In 1986, the film was [[The Defiant Ones (1986 film)|remade]] for [[TV movie|television]], starring [[Robert Urich]] and [[Carl Weathers]]. \n* The film was paid homage to by the 1992 ''[[Quantum Leap]]'' episode \"[[Quantum Leap (season 4)#ep63|Unchained]]\", in which protagonist Sam Beckett lands in the body of a white Mississippi road-gang worker chained to a wrongly convicted black man, and the two must escape together or be murdered by the corrupt warden.\n* In 1996, the film was remade as ''[[Fled]]'', starring [[Laurence Fishburne]] and [[Stephen Baldwin]].\n* The 2018 western video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' features an optional questline where the player can help two chain gang escapees, a white man named Mr. Black and a black man named Mr. White, evade the law after being wrongfully convicted of a crime, or hand them over to the authorities for their bounties. \n* A pair of [[Marvel Comics]] supervillains called [[Hammer and Anvil (comics)|Hammer and Anvil]] were parodies of the film's leads.\n* The film was unofficially remade in Hindi by Bollywood (Indian cinema) titled ''[[Kachche Dhaage]]'' starring Ajay Devgan & Saif Ali Khan. The story was changed to a different setting to enable the protagonists to be chained together while settling their differences on the run.\n* The 1987 G.I. Joe the Movie has the temporarily blinded Roadblock and the former Cobra Commander working together to escape Cobra-La; this was a deliberate reference to The Defiant Ones by writer Buzz Dixon, as admitted in the commentary for the 25th anniversary Blu-ray edition.\n*In his second autobiography ''Why Me'', [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] revealed that [[Elvis Presley]] wanted to star alongside him in this film. However, [[Colonel Tom Parker]], Presley\u2019s manager, was against it.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0051525/trivia/ | title=The Defiant Ones (1958) - IMDb | website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref>\n\n<!--Do not include minor pop culture references here, including name-dropping-->\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1958]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{TCMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie movie}}\n* {{AFI film}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes}}\n* [http://everyoscarever.blogspot.com/2012/01/defiant-ones-1958.html \"The Defiant Ones\"] at Every Oscar Ever\n\n{{Stanley Kramer}}\n{{Curtleigh Productions}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Awards for ''The Defiant Ones''\n| list =\n{{GoldenGlobeBestMotionPictureDrama 1951-1960}}\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Defiant Ones}}\n[[Category:1958 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1958 films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Best Drama Picture Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:Curtleigh Productions films]]\n[[Category:Edgar Award-winning works]]\n[[Category:1950s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about criminals]]\n[[Category:Films about race and ethnicity]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stanley Kramer]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Stanley Kramer]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Ernest Gold]]\n[[Category:Films whose cinematographer won the Best Cinematography Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:1950s American films]]"}]}}}}
