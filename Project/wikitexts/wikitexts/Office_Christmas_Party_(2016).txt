The film stars an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Jason Bateman]], [[Olivia Munn]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Jillian Bell]], [[Vanessa Bayer]], [[Courtney B. Vance]], [[Rob Corddry]], [[Kate McKinnon]], and [[Jennifer Aniston]].\n\nThe film was released on December 9, 2016, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It grossed $114 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nJosh Parker, [[Chief technology officer|Chief Technology Officer]] of Zenotek in [[Chicago]], finalizes his divorce and goes to work. The [[Interim CEO|interim]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Carol Vanstone arrives to notify Josh and branch manager, Clay Vanstone that the company has failed to meet its new quarterly quota. She threatens to [[Layoff|lay off]] 40% of their employees, cut bonuses, and cancel the annual Christmas party. Carol and Clay are siblings having recently lost their father, the former CEO. Clay is desperate to keep his staff and to pay out employee bonuses however, Carol resenting Clay as their dad's favorite, threatens to shut down the branch.\n\nJosh, Clay, and Tracey Hughes, Chief of [[Research and development|Research and Development]], inform Carol that they have a meeting with financial giant Walter Davis later in the day so Carol gives them a last chance. Walter likes the pitch, but is concerned, fearing they care more about the budget than their people. Clay invites him to the Christmas party, hoping to show him their company is stable with a healthy employee environment. On the way to the airport Carol stops by Josh's apartment to offer him a position working for her at the [[New York City|New York]] headquarters at twice his current salary.\n\nClay funds an exorbitant Christmas party, vexing Mary, head of [[Human resources|Human Resources]]. The party struggles to pick up even with [[Chicago Bulls]] player [[Jimmy Butler]] present. Initially reluctant, Walter is accidentally doused with [[cocaine]] and he livens up. Various employees also cut loose: Nate hired [[Prostitution|escort]] Savannah, to pretend to be his girlfriend; Clay's assistant and single mom Allison unsuccessfully tries to hook up with Fred; Jeremy cuts loose dancing with Mary, whom he previously despised. Josh and Tracey nearly kiss on the roof. As Clay wins over Walter, the celebration grows more and more chaotic, including [[Orgy|orgies]], damaging company property, with heavy alcohol and drugs.\n\nCarol's flight is cancelled due to weather, and she rushes back when she hears about the party from her [[Uber]] driver as the party is now the talk of the town with many non-employees in attendance. Though initially impressed with receiving Walter's business, he injures himself attempting to swing off a balcony. It is revealed that Walter was fired from his firm earlier, nullifying the contract and leaving Zenotek helpless. Carol decides to immediately shut down the branch.\n\nCarol then loudly mentions her job offer to Josh to everyone, especially Clay. Despite stating he didn't accept it, he is angrily shunned. Tracey was also given an offer by Carol but explicitly rejected it, where he kept it open. Feeling betrayed, Clay rushes off with Savannah's unstable pimp, Trina, to party elsewhere, though she is more interested in robbing him of his wealth which he has on his person. Josh, Tracey, Mary, and ultimately Carol race to save him.\n\nHearing the branch is being terminated instigates a riot, destroying everything in sight. Josh authorizes security guard Carla to shut down the party. Clay races Trina's car towards an opening drawbridge, attempting to jump the gap, a feat he'd earlier mentioned to Josh. Driving Mary's minivan alongside him, Josh tries to convince Clay not to jump, but he is still upset. Convinced he's a failure he still wants to jump, dead or alive. After everyone fails to convince Clay to pull over, Josh threatens to join him, and Clay agrees. Scared of dying, Carol takes the wheel, swerving into Clay's car and causing him to veer off and crash into an internet hub, disconnecting the entire city.\n\nTrina and Savannah are arrested, while Clay is taken to the hospital. The internet blackout, inspires Tracey to implement an innovation combining internet Wi-Fi with wire connections through the power grid, which had previously failed. They race back to the destroyed office to set up her tech, it works and internet is restored to Chicago.\n\nThe innovation saves the entire branch, with Clay apologizing for how his father treated Carol. Walter, in the same hospital, agrees to join the team. Josh and Tracey kiss amidst the ruins of the office. Jeremy opens up to Mary, and Nate and Allison agree to go on a date. Everyone meets Carol and Clay at the hospital, and they all go out for breakfast, driving recklessly on the way.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Josh Parker, Chief of Technical Advancement, Zenotek Chicago\n* [[Olivia Munn]] as Tracey Hughes, Chief of R&D, Zenotek Chicago\n* [[T.J.
