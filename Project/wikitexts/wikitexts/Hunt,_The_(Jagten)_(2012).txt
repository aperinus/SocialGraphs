He misses his teenage son, Marcus, who mostly lives with his ex-wife, but he gets along well with the young children at the local [[kindergarten]] where he has worked since the school at which he taught closed. When Marcus says he wants to live with Lucas and Lucas starts to date Nadja, a co-worker, his fortunes seem to be looking up.\n\nKlara, who is the daughter of Lucas' best friend, Theo, as well as a pupil at Lucas' kindergarten, has a tendency to wander off on her own when her parents argue, and Lucas occasionally happens upon her when she is alone and helps her out. He accommodates her aversion to stepping on cracks and says she can walk his dog whenever she wants, and, over time, Klara develops a crush on Lucas. When she kisses him on the mouth and gives him a small gift, he gently rebuffs her and she becomes dejected. Using details from a pornographic picture shown to her by a friend of her older brother, Klara makes comments that lead Grethe, the director of the kindergarten, to believe Lucas [[Indecent exposure|exposed]] himself to her. Grethe invites an acquaintance to interview Klara and, after Klara nods in response to the man's [[leading questions]], Grethe, who does not believe that children lie about such things, alerts the authorities and informs the parents of the children who attend the kindergarten. Klara later contradicts her initial story, but the adults see this as stemming from denial of what happened to her.\n\nLucas loses his job, his friendship with Theo is destroyed, and he is shunned by the community as a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] and outcast. Due to the vague language used and the secrecy around the investigation, he does not know what specifically he is supposed to have done, but he eventually hears he may have been accused of abusing multiple children. The strain of this revelation leads him to break up with Nadja when he thinks she doubts his innocence.\n\nMarcus runs away from his mother to be with Lucas. After a trip to the grocery store, where he is told that neither he nor his father are welcome anymore, he sees Lucas being arrested by the police. Locked out of the house, Marcus goes to ask Theo for a spare key and ends up fighting with several adults for confronting Klara and asking why she lied about his father. He is taken in by Bruun, one of Lucas' friends, and his family, who believe Lucas is innocent. Bruun tells Marcus that Lucas has a hearing in the morning and he is hopeful the case against Lucas will be dropped, since he has heard that all of the children's accounts of their abuse mention the same details of the basement of Lucas' house, which does not have a basement.\n\nLucas is released from custody, but someone kills his dog and throws a stone through his window, so he sends Marcus back to his ex-wife. On Christmas Eve, he gets beaten up and thrown out of the grocery store when he refuses to leave without his food, however, he headbutts the butcher to get his groceries back. At church, he notices Theo and his wife, who saw him limp out of the store bleeding from his head, whispering during the service, so he challenges Theo to look in his eyes for a sign he is lying about his innocence, since Theo had previously stated he can always tell when Lucas is lying. When Theo goes to put Klara to bed that night, she reaffirms that Lucas did not do anything bad to her, and Theo's doubts about Lucas are resolved. He brings Lucas food and alcohol and the two men sit together.\n\nBy the next fall, tensions in the community have lessened and Lucas and Nadja have gotten back together. Marcus receives his first rifle at a ceremony at Bruun's house, after which the assembled adult men go hunting on the surrounding estate. When Lucas is by himself, a bullet whizzes past his head. He turns and watches as the shooter, silhouetted against the sun, reloads his rifle and points it at Lucas for a moment before he flees.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as Lucas\n* [[Thomas Bo Larsen]] as Theo, Lucas' best friend, Agnes' husband, and Klara's father\n* Annika Wedderkopp as Klara, Theo and Agnes' daughter\n* Lasse Fogelstr\u00f8m as Marcus, Lucas' son\n* [[Susse Wold]] as Grethe, Lucas' boss\n* [[Anne Louise Hassing]] as Agnes, Theo's wife and Klara's mother\n* [[Lars Ranthe]] as Bruun, Lucas' friend, Marcus's godfather\n* [[Alexandra Rapaport]] as Nadja, Lucas' girlfriend\n* Sebastian Bull Sarning as Torsten, Theo and Agnes' son, Klara's older brother, and Marcus' friend\n* [[Bjarne Henriksen]] as Ole\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by [[Zentropa]] for 20 million [[Danish krone]]r.
