Starring [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Tom Hanks]], the film is based on the radio and television [[Dragnet (series)|crime drama of the same name]]. The screenplay, both a [[parody]] of and [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the long-running television series, was written by Aykroyd, Mankiewicz, and [[Alan Zweibel]]. The original music score is by [[Ira Newborn]].\n\nAykroyd plays [[Joe Friday]] (nephew of the original series protagonist) while Hanks plays Pep Streebek, his new partner. [[Harry Morgan]] reprises his role from the television series as Bill Gannon, now a captain and Friday and Streebek's boss.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Sergeant Joe Friday's nephew and namesake, whose [[anachronistic]] views reflect those of his late uncle, is involuntarily assigned a cocky, streetwise new partner, Pep Streebek. Their contrasting styles clash at first, with Friday disapproving of Streebek's attitude, hairstyle, and wardrobe. However, they start to bond while investigating a series of bizarre thefts. One of the stolen items is the entire print run of ''Bait'', a pornographic magazine published by Jerry Caesar. Reverend Jonathan Whirley has been leading a moral crusade against Caesar's business.\n\nThe trail leads Friday and Streebek to a cult calling itself P.A.G.A.N. (People Against Goodness and Normalcy), and they focus on member Emil Muzz, who also works as Caesar's limousine driver. Under interrogation, Muzz reveals the time and place of a secret ceremony. Friday and Streebek sneak in, disguised as members, and witness a masked leader using several of the stolen items in a ritual leading up to a virgin sacrifice.\n\nThe leader throws the victim, Connie Swail (referred to as \"the virgin Connie Swail\"), into a pit of water with an anaconda. Friday and Streebek disrupt the ritual, saving Connie and subduing the snake, and report the incident to their boss Captain Bill Gannon. However, when Gannon and Police Commissioner Jane Kirkpatrick (who is running for mayor) visit the site with them the next day, no evidence of the ritual can be found. Kirkpatrick removes Friday and Streebek from the case.\n\nStreebek gets a tip on the whereabouts of a load of chemicals stolen by P.A.G.A.N. that can be used to mass-produce a toxic gas. He and Friday lead a SWAT team to raid the location, which proves to be an ordinary milk factory; the chemicals and gas-making equipment are actually hidden next door. With no further leads to follow, Streebek tags along on a birthday dinner for Friday and his grandmother, and Connie soon joins them at Friday's invitation. During dinner, Connie identifies Whirley (at another table with Gannon and Kirkpatrick) as the P.A.G.A.N. leader (as at the ritual, she came face to face with him and removed his mask). Friday attempts to arrest Whirley, but the corrupt Kirkpatrick, whose mayoral campaign is being secretly bankrolled by Whirley and Caesar, overrules him and relieves him of duty. Gannon takes Friday's badge and gun and orders Streebek to stay away from Whirley.\n\nAs Friday takes Connie home, Muzz captures them and takes them to the [[Griffith Observatory]], where Whirley reveals to them his plan to kill Caesar at a reunion party for the models of ''Bait''. He has his men take Connie to his private jet and prepares to kill Friday, but Streebek arrives just in time, having forced Muzz to reveal Friday's whereabouts at gunpoint. Streebek infiltrates Caesar's mansion and disrupts the P.A.G.A.N. plans to release the gas made from the stolen chemicals, just before Whirley sets fire to the stolen magazines to cover his escape. Gannon arrives with SWAT teams and Friday crashes the estate gates with an armored vehicle. Streebek personally arrests Muzz while Friday is thanked for stopping the gas attack by a grateful Caesar. Gannon reinstates Friday and returns his badge so he can pursue Whirley.\n\nAt the airport, Whirley meets Kirkpatrick and then abandons her and takes off with Connie as his hostage. The following morning, Friday catches up to him in a police jet and forces him to land. Whirley is convicted on multiple charges and received \"43 consecutive 99-year sentences\" in the Men's Correctional Institue in Chino (Kirkpatrick's fate is never given, though the exposure of her criminal activity means the end of her career), while Friday continues his partnership with Streebek and begins dating Connie, who is no longer called \"the virgin\" by Friday.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Sergeant Joe Friday\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Detective Pep Streebek\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Reverend Jonathan Whirley\n* [[Harry Morgan]] as Captain Bill Gannon\n* [[Alexandra Paul]] as \"the virgin\" Connie Swail\n* [[Jack O'Halloran]] as Emil Muzz\n* [[Elizabeth Ashley]] as Commissioner Jane Kirkpatrick\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Jerry Caesar\n* [[Kathleen Freeman]] as Enid Borden\n* [[Bruce Gray]] as Mayor Peter Parvin\n* [[Lenka Peterson]] as Granny Mundy\n* Julia Jennings as Sylvia Wiss\n* [[Fred Asparagus]] as Tito Provencal\n* [[Kimberly Foster (actress)|Kimberly Foster]] as Betsy Blees\n* D.D.

Aykroyd had in fact starred as Friday in a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' parody of ''Dragnet'' in 1976. [[Tom Mankiewicz]], best known for his work on ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' and the [[James Bond]] series, had a deal at Universal and was brought in to work on the film script with them. [[Ted Kotcheff]] was originally attached to direct but did not like the draft the three writers had come up with, so [[Frank Price]] at Universal suggested Mankiewicz himself direct.<ref name=\"tom\">{{cite news|first1=Tom|last1=Mankiewicz|author-link1=Tom Mankiewicz|first2=Robert|last2=Crane|title=My Life as a Mankiewicz: An Insider's Journey Through Hollywood|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|location=Lexington, Kentucky|date=2012|isbn=978-0813161235|pages=284\u2013285}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=JUST THE FACTS, MANK: Director Tom Mankiewicz Is 'Dragnet's' Top Cop|first=Patrick|last=Goldstein|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=March 22, 1987|page=K3}}</ref> [[Albert Brooks]] was offered the role of Pep Streebek, but he turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2011/06/the-lost-roles-of-albert-brooks.html|title=The Lost Roles of Albert Brooks|date=30 June 2011}}</ref> Aykroyd originally wanted [[Jim Belushi]] to play the role of Friday's partner Pep Streebek, but Belushi was unavailable and Tom Hanks was cast instead.<ref name=\"tom\"/>\n\nBritish electronic group [[Art of Noise]] produced an update of the series' original [[Dragnet (theme music)|theme music]] for the title credits.<ref name=EO>{{cite web|url= https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/awful-80s-end-credit-songs/|title=15 Gloriously Awful '80s End Credit Songs|first=Owen|last=Williams|magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=22 February 2013|access-date=19 June 2017}}</ref> They set the ''Dragnet'' theme against an electronic [[breakbeat]] and added soundbites from the film, such as Friday's line \"Just the facts, ma'am\", timed to the music.\n\nThe soundtrack includes an original song called \"City of Crime\", a rock/hip-hop hybrid collaboration performed by Aykroyd and Hanks with bassist/vocalist [[Glenn Hughes (British musician)|Glenn Hughes]] and guitarist [[Pat Thrall]]. The track is played over the film's closing credits and had a promotional music video that featured Aykroyd and Hanks.<ref name=EO/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received favorable reviews from [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] on their program ''[[At the Movies (1982 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert and the Movies]]''. Siskel praised Aykroyd's performance in particular, going so far as to say he deserved an [[Academy Award]] nomination. Ebert extended this praise to the ensemble cast, although he lamented the lack of stylized camera shots from the original television show and criticized the use of contemporary pop music. Siskel concluded that \"they didn't have enough confidence in the material that they had to try and hook kids in with some disco thing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://siskelebert.org/?p=1817|title=Dragnet, Adventures In Babysitting, Inner Space, 1987 |website=siskelebert.org|access-date=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn his written review, Ebert gave the movie three out of four stars, concluding that \"it is great for an hour, good for about 25 minutes and then heads doggedly for the Standard 1980s High Tech Hollywood Ending, which means an expensive chase scene and a shootout.\" He also added that he felt the film would have been more effective in black and white.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dragnet-1987 |title=Dragnet|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=June 26, 1987|via=rogerebert.com|access-date=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe film holds a 50% approval score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 36 reviews with an average rating of 5.2/10.
