Paul was recently dumped by his longtime girlfriend Jan because he refused her ultimatum of marriage. Believing that she is now seeing Victor the meat cutter, he vindictively blocks her driveway with snow every night. Tommy is cheating on his girlfriend Sharon with his married high school sweetheart Darian.\n\nWillie meets 13 year-old neighbor girl Marty, and they strike up a witty rapport. She presses him about his relationship: he has been with his girlfriend Tracy for a year, but is unsure if he wants to marry her. He is considering taking a steady job as a salesman, but Mo urges him not to quit his music.\n\nPaul desperately proposes to Jan, but she turns him down. Sharon argues with Tommy about his infidelity, and seeks advice from her girlfriends. The outspoken Gina advises her to break up with Tommy, but Sharon tries to salvage the relationship by planning him a surprise birthday party.\n\nWhen the attractive Andera comes to town from Chicago, the guys compete for her attention. The next day, Gina lectures Willie and Tommy about men's unrealistic expectations of women set by [[supermodel]]s and pornography. Willie feels jealous when he sees that Marty has a boyfriend.\n\nDarian shows up at Tommy's surprise party drunk and openly tries to seduce him, causing Sharon to leave, heartbroken. Tommy drives Darian home but refuses her advances, and unsuccessfully tries to patch things up with Sharon. Willie tells Mo about his feelings for Marty, but is reminded how young she is and says that he just doesn't want to grow up.\n\nWillie again encounters Marty, who says that she has broken up with her boyfriend because she is interested in him, asking him to wait five years until she is 18 and they can be together. Willie declines, saying that she will outgrow her feelings for him as she matures.\n\nPaul takes Andera out, trying to make Jan jealous. Andera plays along, but when Paul tries to kiss her she smacks him and leaves. Willie chastises Paul about his obsession with supermodels; he responds that beautiful girls represent hope and promise. Tommy breaks things off with Darian, but she states her intent to win him back at the reunion.\n\nAndera approaches Willie, turning down his flirtations but accompanying him to Paul's [[ice shanty]], where they discuss their respective relationships. He misses the emotional rush of new love, but she feels truly happy with her boyfriend and returns to Chicago the next day. Tracy arrives from New York, and Willie's feelings for her are rekindled. Marty is downhearted by this, but Willie assures her that she will grow up to do amazing things.\n\nAt the reunion, Darian is confronted by a former classmate who she bullied; he tells her that she was beautiful, but \"mean as a snake\". Tommy skips the reunion to avoid Darian, but encounters her husband Steve and his friends at a bar. Steve reveals he knows about the affair; a fight ensues, and Tommy is badly beaten. Learning of this, the guys rush to Steve's house to confront him. Steve calls his friends, but Willie pushes their car into a snowbank using Paul's snowplow. Mo is about to beat Steve up, but stops when Steve's daughter comes to the door. Darian arrives home in the aftermath of the confrontation. Tommy ends up in the hospital with a concussion and two broken ribs. Sharon stays with him overnight, and they make up. Paul, overcome with emotion, clears Jan's driveway of snow.\n\nWillie says his goodbyes the next day, having decided to head back to New York with Tracy and not take the sales job. Paul announces that Jan and Victor are engaged. Willie introduces Tracy to Marty, and kisses Marty on the cheek before departing.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Listed in order of the film's credits reel, with bluelinked actors as bullets and others described as minor roles -->\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Tommy \"Birdman\" Rowland, a former high school football star turned snowplower\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Michael \"Mo\" Morris, a textile plant manager and family man\n* [[Annabeth Gish]] as Tracy Stover, an attorney and Willie Conway's girlfriend\n* [[Lauren Holly]] as Darian Smalls, Tommy's high school girlfriend, now married with a daughter and having an affair with Tommy\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as Willie Conway, a New York City pianist visiting his hometown\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Gina Barrisano, the outspoken friend of several of the characters\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Kev, a snowplower employed by Tommy and Paul\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Jan, Paul Kirkwood's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Marty, the Conways' 13 year-old neighbor, a witty, self-described \"old soul\" who connects with Willie\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Paul Kirkwood, a snowplower\n* [[Mira Sorvino]] as Sharon Cassidy, Tommy's girlfriend\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Andera, Stanley Womack's attractive cousin from Chicago\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Stanley \"Stinky\" Womack, proprietor of a local bar\n* [[Anne Bobby]] as Sarah Morris, Mo's wife\n* [[Richard Bright (actor)|Richard Bright]] as Dick Conway, Willie's father\n* [[Sam Robards]] as Steve Rossmore, Darian's husband\n* [[David Arquette]] as Bobby Conway, Willie's younger brother\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Victor the meat cutter, who is dating Jan\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Frank Womack, a bartender\n* [[Tom Gibis]] as \"Peter the Eater\", a former classmate of Darian's whom she bullied about his weight\n* [[John Scurti]] as a [[Greyhound Lines]] ticket agent\n* [[Greg Dulli]], lead singer of [[the Afghan Whigs]], as himself in a scene with the band performing\n* [[Harold \"Happy\" Chichester]], lead singer of [[Howlin' Maggie]], as himself in a scene with the band performing\n\nAdditional minor roles were played by Kristen Rossmore as Steve and Darian's daughter Kristen; Camille D'Ambrose as Sharon's mother; Martin Ruben as Jan's restaurant boss Chip; Allison Levine as a waitress; Earl R.
