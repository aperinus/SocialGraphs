At the time of its release, it received special attention because, eight years after his death, it was the first (and still only) posthumous film to feature previously unreleased material from John Cassavetes.\n\nThe film stars [[Sean Penn]] and [[John Travolta]] as the respective men who bid for the affection of Maureen Murphy Quinn ([[Robin Wright]]). [[Harry Dean Stanton]] co-stars as a friend of Penn's character, and [[James Gandolfini]] plays the abusive neighbor.\n\n==Plot==\nEddie Quinn's unruly wife Maureen drinks and smokes to excess, even though she is pregnant. Eddie has troubles of his own, disappearing for days at a time. When she is physically and sexually assaulted by Kiefer, a neighbor, it is more than Eddie can handle. He shoots someone and lands in a psychiatric hospital.\n\nTen years go by. Eddie finally returns, only to find Maureen is now a clean, sober, solid citizen, married to a new man, Joey, and a mother of three children, one of whom is Eddie's own daughter. Eddie's return complicates and endangers all of their lives.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Eddie Quinn\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Maureen Murphy Quinn\n* [[John Travolta]] as Joey Giamonti\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Kiefer\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Tony \"Shorty\" Russo\n* [[Neill Barry]] as Michael\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Georgie\n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Miss Jane Green\n* [[Susan Traylor]] as Lucinda\n* Bobby Cooper as Cooper\n* [[John Marshall Jones]] as Leonard\n* [[Chloe Webb]] as Nancy Swearingen\n* James Soravilla as Avi\n* Jamie Bozian as Intern #1 (as James Bozian)\n* [[Paul Johansson]] as Intern #2\n* [[Justina Machado]] as Carmen Rodriguez as Lady Ticket Taker\n* [[Tito Larriva]] as Lead Singer\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 66% based on 41 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |title=She's So Lovely (1997) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shes_so_lovely |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2020-05-04 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] gave it 3 out of 4 stars and wrote: \"What [Nick Cassavetes] understands is that if you want to see true weirdness, you don't look along skid row, where the motives are pretty easy to understand, but out in suburbia, where those green lawns can surround human time bombs.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=August 29, 1997 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=She's So Lovely movie review & film summary (1997) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shes-so-lovely-1997 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\nWriting in [[Time Out New York]], [[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnston]] remarked: \"Watching the films of John Cassavetes now, one is struck by how complex and human his characters are, compared with those in even the most sophisticated of today's independent films. This effect is even more pronounced in ''She's So Lovely,'' an unproduced Cassavetes script given the '90s treatment and filled with stars by the late director's son. The final product features some of the year's best performances....\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Andrew|date=September 1997|title=She's So Lovely|journal=Time Out New York|pages=77}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n[[Sean Penn]] won the award for [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4809/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: She's So Lovely |access-date=2009-09-23|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> [[Robin Wright]] received a nomination for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role|Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role]] at the [[4th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0120112|title=She's So Lovely}}\n* {{Amg title|id=154964|title=She's So Lovely}}\n* {{Mojo title|id=shessolovely|title=She's So Lovely}}\n\n{{Nick Cassavetes}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Nick Cassavetes]]\n[[Category:1997 independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
