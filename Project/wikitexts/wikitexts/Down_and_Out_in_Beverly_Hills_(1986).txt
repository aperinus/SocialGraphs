Dave is the owner of \"Dave-Bar\", a manufacturing business that makes wire garment hangers.  He is having an affair with Carmen, the live-in maid, while Barbara tries to relieve her constant feelings of anxiety through shopping and experimenting with various [[New Age]] therapies.  She admits to having hired Carmen partly to satisfy Dave's lust.  Their teenage son, Max, has a strained relationship with his parents, communicates with them largely through his avant-garde videos, and is having issues around his gender presentation. Dave feels estranged from his 19-year-old daughter Jenny, who he believes is [[anorexia|anorexic]] and making poor life choices. The family dog is also poorly adjusted.\n\nJerry Baskin, a down-and-out homeless man, attempts to drown himself in the Whitemans' pool, driven to despair by the loss of his own dog. Dave saves him and offers to let him to recuperate at their home for a few days. He is intrigued by Jerry's colorful accounts of his past life and former success and wealth, and offers to help him back onto his feet. As they spend time together, meeting Jerry's friends, Dave finds liberation in observing Jerry's lifestyle and outlook, which contrasts his own materialistic conformism. Meanwhile, Jerry overcomes Barbara's hostility and begins a sexual relationship with her. This reawakens her sex drive, and she and Dave re-consummate their marriage. Jerry soon also has sex with Carmen, who now rejects Dave's advances as exploitative, thanks to the political literature Jerry introduced her to. He also cures the dog of its behavioral problems through his empathetic skills, and he persuades Max to come out to his parents in his androgynous persona. Finally, he seduces Jenny, just as she vehemently denounces him as a manipulative psychopath. When next seen, at an extravagant party thrown by the Whitemans, she has overcome her apparent anorexia and declares herself deeply in love with him. This development impels Dave to physically attack Jerry, and the major characters end up floundering in the swimming pool. The following morning, Jerry ruefully confesses to inventing the stories he had told of his past and prepares to leave the Whitemans' home. Wandering down the back service alley with the family dog (now his firmly bonded companion), Jerry turns to see the entire household gathering in the alley, gazing after him longingly. Without a word, he turns back to rejoin them, and they re-enter the grounds of the house together, apparently to resume their unorthodox living arrangement.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nick Nolte]] &ndash; Jerry Baskin\n* [[Bette Midler]] &ndash; Barbara Whiteman \n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] &ndash; Dave Whiteman\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] &ndash; Carmen the Maid \n* [[Little Richard]] &ndash; Orvis Goodnight\n* Evan Richards &ndash; Max Whiteman \n* [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Nelson]] &ndash; Jenny Whiteman\n* [[Felton Perry]] &ndash; Al\n\n===Production credits===\n* [[Mino Argento]] &ndash; Paintings<ref>{{cite news| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/14493/Down-and-Out-in-Beverly-Hills/credits | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121103005947/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/14493/Down-and-Out-in-Beverly-Hills/credits | url-status= dead | archive-date= 2012-11-03 | department= Movies & TV Dept. | work= [[The New York Times]] | date= 2012 | title=Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986) }}</ref>\n* [[Toni Grant]] &ndash; Herself, talk radio host\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a financial success.
