David (Vladimir Cruz), is rejected by Vivian, who marries an older and wealthier man. It is revealed that he is a university student when he meets Diego (Jorge Perugorr\u00eda), a [[gay]] artist unhappy with the [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] regime's attitude toward the [[LGBT]] community as well as the censored conceptualization of culture. David's homophobic classmate, Miguel (Francisco Gattorno), plans to use David to [[espionage|spy]] on Diego, a person whom they see as aberrant and dangerous to the [[Communist]] cause; Diego, for his part, initiates the friendship with sexual intentions, but David for the most part rejects his advances.\n\nAlthough David initially chafes at the idea of being Diego's \"baby\", he decides to do so in order to relay information back to Miguel. The two form a tenuous friendship in the process of this spying, and David makes it clear that their relationship will be platonic. Nancy, a \"vigilance\" who lives above Diego, attempts suicide as David arrives one day, and he ends up donating blood so that she can recover. As David spends more and more time with Diego, he argues with him about Communism, sexuality, and what is truly revolutionary. After constantly reporting their activities to Miguel, David eventually ends up erupting, telling Miguel that Diego has principles despite his sexuality. Vivian tries to reconnect with David and begin an affair, but he finally rejects her advances. David begins to show more signs of affection for Diego, buying him flowers and posting up Marxist icons in Diego's room, and letting him read his manuscript.\n\nIn a side plot, Diego and German, his artist protege and sexual partner, are unable to exhibit their full collection of work. In this process, the two have a falling out and Diego sends an angry letter to the museum curators of Cuba. This leads to his firing, and an inability to find work outside of manual labor due to his blacklisting by the government. Diego tells this to Nancy, who has developed a romantic interest in David. In a gesture of friendship to both parties, he decides to set Nancy and David up, and David loses his virginity to Nancy.  In the days after, Miguel comes to Diego's apartment, accusing David of being a homosexual.\n\nDiego eventually decides to leave the country, but is unable to keep it a secret from David. He confesses his love for David, and reveals it was the fact that Diego didn't deny rumors that he was in a relationship with David that led to David's false \"outing\" as a gay man. Despite this, David embraces Diego with a hug, leaving their future relationship ambiguous.\n\n== Cast==\n*[[Jorge Perugorr\u00eda]] ...  Diego\n*[[Vladimir Cruz]] ...  David\n*[[Mirta Ibarra]] ...

''Strawberry and Chocolate'' is not a movie about the seduction of a body, but about the seduction of a mind. It is more interested in politics than sex &mdash; unless you count [[Sexual Politics]], since to be homosexual in Cuba is to make an [[anti-authoritarian]] statement whether you intend it or not.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950210/REVIEWS/502100303/1023 Ebert, Roger. \"''Strawberry and Chocolate''\" (review)], ''Chicago Sun-Times'', February 10, 1995.
