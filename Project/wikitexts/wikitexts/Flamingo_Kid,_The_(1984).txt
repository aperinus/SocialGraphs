It stars [[Matt Dillon]], [[Richard Crenna]], [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] and [[Jessica Walter]]. The film tells the story of a [[working class]] boy who takes a summer job at a [[Seaside resort|beach resort]] and learns valuable life lessons.\n\nIt was the first film to receive a [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] rating, although it was the fifth to be released with that rating (after ''[[Red Dawn]]'', ''[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|The Woman in Red]]'', ''[[Dreamscape (1984 film)|Dreamscape]]'' and ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/57083|title=The Flamingo Kid|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|access-date=March 12, 2021}}</ref> Crenna received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for his supporting role and [[Marisa Tomei]] made her big screen debut with a minor role in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the summer of 1963, Jeffrey Willis joins some friends for a day of gin rummy at ''El Flamingo Club'', a private beach resort. There, he meets the girl of his dreams Carla Sampson. After the gin game and being told of the club's strict policy regarding guests, Jeffrey is upset, but not for long, since he immediately lands a job as a car valet and eventually, cabana steward. Jeffrey is a kid from a middle class Brooklyn family and his father does not approve of him working at the private club.\n \nHis hero and mentor at the resort is the reigning [[gin rummy|gin rummy card game]] champ, Phil Brody, a salesman of exotic sports and luxury cars.<ref>Blank, Ed.

Retrieved March 12, 2021.</ref>\n\nJeffrey, a winning gin rummy player himself, and his friends admire Brody and how his wins at the Gin rummy table make him seem \"psychic,\" knowing which cards to give up. Brody also takes a liking to Jeffrey, eventually showing him his car business, and gives him hopes that car sales are where he belongs as a career.\n\nJeffrey gets further immersed in the \"easy buck\", as evidenced by Phil showing off his success, as opposed to Mr. Willis' manual labor, or the example of Phil's brother, who studied for years to become a lawyer but has had little financial return. During dinner, Jeffrey notably says he \"will not be needing college\" and plans to pursue being a car salesman instead. Jeffrey and his co-workers at the ''El Flamingo'' also venture to Yonkers Raceway together, risking cash on a horse tip but coming up short when the trotter breaks stride.\n\nEventually, Jeffrey leaves home to pursue the sales job. However, Brody, angry that he disturbed him during a dance class, reveals to him that the job opening at the car dealership is for a stock boy, not as a salesman as Jeffrey had been led to believe was his when he asked for it. Brody lectures Jeffrey in a similar lesson that Mr. Willis had \"You can't plant a tree and expect to hang a swing on it the next day\", and recommends Jeffrey accept the stock boy job to prove himself and work his way up. \n\nJeffrey becomes shocked at his mentor's actions and reconsiders college. Near summer's end, he observes that a regular onlooker, \"Big Sid\", is feeding signals to Brody, the true cause of his winning. When Big Sid and a member of the gin team playing against Brody's team are overcome by the heat, Jeffrey fills in, opposing Brody, and seeking to help win back the unfair profits Brody won from his friends over the course of the summer. \n\nJeffrey and his team eventually win back what was unfairly lost, including a good profit besides. Impressed that he was defeated without cheating, Phil says they can \"skip this stock boy nonsense\" and offers him the salesman job, but Jeffrey declines. \n\nRealizing the mistakes he made in rejecting his father's good advice, Jeffrey makes up with his dad in a touching scene at Larry's Fish House (\"Any Fish You Wish\"), where his family is dining.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Matt Dillon]] as Jeffrey Willis\n*[[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Arthur Willis\n*[[Richard Crenna]] as Phil Brody\n*[[Jessica Walter]] as Phyllis Brody\n*[[Janet Jones]] as Carla Samson\n*[[Brian McNamara]] as Steve Dawkins\n*[[Fisher Stevens]] as Hawk Ganz\n*[[Leon Robinson]] as Fortune Smith\n*[[Bronson Pinchot]] as Alfred Shultz\n*Molly McCarthy as Ruth Willis\n*[[Martha Gehman]] as Nikki Willis\n*[[Carole Davis]] as Joyce Brody\n*[[Frank Campanella]] as Colonel Cal Eastland\n*[[Richard Stahl]] as Charlie Cooper\n*[[Joe Grifasi]] as Mario Minetta\n*[[Ron McLarty]] as Pat McCarty\n*Seth Allen as Jerry Berlin\n*[[Adam Klugman]] as Lewis Madrone\n*Ray Roderick as Danny Walsh\n*[[Steven Weber]] as Paul Hirsch\n*Irving Metzman as Big Sid\n*Googy Gress as Freddy\n*[[Eric Douglas]] as Donny\n*[[Marisa Tomei]] as Mandy\n*[[Tracy Reiner]] as Polly\n*Kristina Kossi as Kristina\n*[[Brad Kane]] as Mitch\n*[[Steve Witting]] as Frank \n*[[Novella Nelson]] as Lizzy\n\n==Production==\n[[Cass Elliot]], of [[The Mamas & The Papas]] fame, told producer and friend Michael Phillips about Neil Marshall's script, which took over ten years to finally get made into a film.\n<ref>\"[https://www.newspapers.com/image/487120767/?terms=cass%2Belliot%2Bflamingo%2Bkid The Flamingo Kid]\".
