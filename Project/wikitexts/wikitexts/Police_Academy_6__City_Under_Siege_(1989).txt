It was directed by [[Peter Bonerz]] and written by Stephen Curwick, based on characters created by [[Neal Israel]] and [[Pat Proft]]. The film was given a PG rating for violence and language. This was the fifth and last ''Police Academy'' sequel to be released in the year immediately following the previous installment of the series. It would take five years until the release of the following film, ''[[Police Academy: Mission to Moscow]]''. ''Police Academy 6: City Under Siege'' was also the last film in the series to feature Bubba Smith, [[Marion Ramsey]], [[Bruce Mahler]], [[Lance Kinsey]] and [[George R. Robertson]] as Hightower, Hooks, Fackler, Proctor and Commissioner Hurst respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the city the police are investigating a series of robberies along the old 51 bus route in the area of the city known as Wilson Heights. Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) and Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) stake out a bank, but the Wilson Heights gang, composed of Ace (Gerrit Graham) a skilled gunman, Flash (Brian Seeman) an acrobatic martial artist, and Ox (Darwyn Swalve) a strong man, manages to elude capture.\n\nIn his office, the mayor is furious with the latest crime spree and reprimands Harris and Commissioner Hurst (George R. Robertson) for his precinct's slow response. The governor is involved now, he brought in special team to stop the robberies and that is Commandant Lassard. The mayor orders Harris and Hurst to work with Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) to apprehend the gang. Lassard assembles a seven-man team consisting of Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler), and Lassard's nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy).\n\nAt the site of the gang\u2019s latest robbery, a bank, the police academy team discovers clues that suggest that the Wilson Heights gang are being orchestrated by some other shadowy figure. After canvassing the neighborhood for any information on the Wilson Heights gang with little success, Nick stumbles upon a paper reporting an antique diamond heading to a museum, and gets an idea to use it as bait. However, the robbers nab the diamond anyway by cutting a hole in the truck and escaping through the sewer system. Nick then decides to go undercover to get information regarding a possible hideout, but Harris insists on going instead, and botches the job after Proctor accidentally knocks him over the balcony. Commandant Lassard and his men are later suspended after jewelry from the gang's last robbery is found in Lassard's office, pending an investigation.\n\nThe team decides to clear his name by investigating and solving the crimes themselves. Having Hooks access data files from a computer, Nick deduces that the robberies are occurring along the old bus line in the city, thus intentionally lowering property values in that part of the city prior to the announcement of a new replacement line system. They also learn that someone must be leaking information to the criminals, which is why they are always one step ahead of the police.\n\nThe police academy force finds and does battle with the Wilson Heights gang during a city wide blackout, taking down Ace, Flash, and Ox, while Nick chases the leader. A pursuit follows, which leads to Commissioner Hurst's office, where they find Commissioner Hurst. But, after the real Commission Hurst arrives, Hightower unmasks the fake Hurst to reveal that the mastermind has been the mayor all along. Caught, the mayor admits that Captain Harris has been unwittingly leaking information during his daily meetings with him, and how he could have made billions off the properties if it had not been for Lassard and his team. Hurst then apologizes to Lassard and reinstates him and his team, and a plaque is given to honor the officers' bravery the next day.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Police Academy characters}}\n\n=== The Police Force ===\n* [[Matt McCoy (actor)|Matt McCoy]] as Sergeant Nick Lassard \n* [[Michael Winslow]] as Sergeant Larvell Jones \n* [[David Graf]] as Sergeant Eugene Tackleberry \n* [[Bubba Smith]] as Lieutenant Moses Hightower \n* [[Marion Ramsey]] as Sergeant Laverne Hooks \n* [[Leslie Easterbrook]] as Lieutenant Debbie Callahan  \n* [[George Gaynes]] as Commandant Eric Lassard \n* [[G.

The police station is called Oakdale Police Station, referencing the Oakdale area of Toronto which a small area between the western intersections of [[Ontario Provincial Highway 400|Highway 400]] and [[Finch Avenue]], extending to just south of [[Sheppard Avenue]], and east just past [[Jane Street]].  This is often referred to as part of the Downsview area of Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.ca/maps/search/oakdale/data=!4m2!2m1!4b1?sa=X&hl=en&dg=dbrw&newdg=1|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps}}</ref> Additionally, the criminal organization behind the crime wave in the city is called the Wilson Heights Gang, a reference to Wilson Heights Boulevard, a street in the Downsview area. The specific area itself is called Wilson Heights as well.\n\n== Production ==\n''Police Academy 6: City Under Siege'' was filmed entirely in [[Los Angeles, California]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a 0% rating based on 7 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |title= Police Academy 6 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/police_academy_6_city_under_siege |access-date=2020-05-04 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 16% based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating \"Overwhelming dislike\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Police Academy 5 |work= [[Metacritic]] |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/police-academy-5-assignment-miami-beach |access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade B\u2212.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= CinemaScore |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= December 20, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nPete Hammond in ''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'' gave ''Police Academy 6: City Under Siege'' a BOMB rating, writing that \"This entry is only\u2014repeat ''only''\u2014for those who thought ''Police Academy 5'' was robbed at [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] time\".<ref name=\"hammond20140819\">{{cite web | url=https://deadline.com/2014/08/r-i-p-leonard-maltins-movie-guide-internet-kills-iconic-print-paperback-after-45-years-821849/ | title=Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide Ending After 45 Years \u2013 Internet Kills Iconic Print Paperback | work=Deadline Hollywood | date=2014-08-19 | access-date=19 August 2014 | last=Hammond |first=Pete }}</ref> ''The DVD/Video Guide'' by Mick Martin and Marsha Porter gave the first two ''Police Academy'' films 2 stars out of 5; and each subsequent film received a Turkey (their lowest score).{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} \n<ref>{{cite news|title= Police Academy 6: City Under Siege |publisher= [[Deseret News]]|url= https://www.deseret.com/1989/4/3/20088413/film-review-police-academy-6-city-under-siege|access-date=2010-12-04}}</ref>\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Director Peter Bonerz and writer Stephen J.
