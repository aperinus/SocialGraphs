It was the first of five films the Marx Brothers made under contract for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] after their departure from [[Paramount Pictures]], and the first after [[Zeppo Marx|Zeppo]] left the act. The film was written by [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Morrie Ryskind]] from a story by [[James Kevin McGuinness]], with additional uncredited dialogue by [[Al Boasberg]]. The film was directed by [[Sam Wood]].\n\nOne of MGM's biggest hits at the 1935 box office, ''A Night at the Opera'' was selected in 1993 for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"registry\">[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Unofficial/Movies/NFR-Titles.html List of National Film Registry (1988-2003).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012093512/https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Unofficial/Movies/NFR-Titles.html |date=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> It is also included in the 2007 update of [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]], at number 85; and previously in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] 2000 showing, at number 12.\n<!--spacing, please do not remove-->\n\n==Plot==\nAt a restaurant in Milan, Italy, Mrs. Claypool, a wealthy widow, has apparently been stood-up for dinner by Otis B. Driftwood, her business manager. After she discovers him dining with another woman and seated directly behind her, Driftwood joins Mrs. Claypool and soon introduces her to Herman Gottlieb, director of the New York Opera Company, also dining at the restaurant. Driftwood has arranged for Mrs. Claypool to invest $200,000 in the opera company, allowing Gottlieb to engage Rodolfo Lassparri, the \"greatest tenor since [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]]\".\n\nBackstage at the opera house, chorister Ricardo Baroni hires his best friend Fiorello to be his manager. Ricardo is in love with the soprano, Rosa Castaldi, who is also being courted by Lassparri. Driftwood arrives backstage and finds Lassparri attacking Tomasso, his [[Dresser (theatre)|dresser]]; Tomasso knocks Lassparri unconscious by hitting him over the head with a mallet. Fiorello appears and introduces himself to Driftwood as the manager of the \"greatest tenor in the world\". Driftwood, who believes Fiorello is referring to Lassparri (who is  still lying unconscious at their feet), unwittingly signs Ricardo to a contract.\n\nSoon, Driftwood, Mrs. Claypool, Rosa, Lassparri and Gottlieb all set sail from Italy to New York aboard an ocean liner. After bidding farewell to Rosa at the pier, Ricardo, Fiorello, and Tomasso stow away inside Driftwood's steamer trunk. After being discovered, Driftwood attempts to get the three of them to leave, as he is expecting a rendezvous with Mrs. Claypool. Fiorello refuses to go until they've eaten, and eventually Driftwood's very small  stateroom is crowded with an assortment of people. (See ''[[#Stateroom scene|Stateroom scene]]'' below.)\n\nLater, Lassparri spots the three stowaways among the Italian immigrants on the ship, and they are caught and thrown into the brig. They escape with Driftwood's help and are able to sneak into the country by assuming the identities of three famous bearded aviators,<ref group=n>The nationality of the aviators is never identified. In ''The Annotated Marx Brothers: A Filmgoer's Guide to In-Jokes, Obscure References and Sly Details'' (2015, McFarland, {{ISBN|978-0786497058}}), Matthew Coniam points out that the omission seems to have been intentional, in order to avoid an obvious lampoon of the Italian fascist aviator [[Italo Balbo]], and that in the newspaper caption that follows they are identified as the \"Santopoulos Brothers\", suggesting that they may be Greek. (pp. 124-125)</ref> who are traveling aboard the ship. During a hero's welcome in New York, the stowaways are exposed as frauds and they flee, hiding out in Driftwood's hotel room while pursued by police sergeant Henderson.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosa and Ricardo are reunited after he climbs in the window of her hotel room. Lassparri appears and after a physical altercation with Ricardo, both Rosa and Driftwood are fired from the opera company by Gottlieb. The boys decide to seek revenge by sabotaging the opening night performance of ''[[Il trovatore]]'' with various antics, climaxing with the abduction of Lassparri from the stage, which forces Gottlieb to substitute Ricardo and Rosa in his place. Mrs. Claypool and the audience clearly prefer Ricardo over Lassparri, and the latter is booed and hit with an apple after he is untied and attempts to return to the stage. The film ends with Driftwood and Fiorello negotiating another contract, as Rosa and Ricardo sing an encore.\n\n==Selected scenes==\n[[File:El camarot dels germans Marx.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.47|The stateroom scene, from the trailer to the film]]\n\n===Stateroom scene===\nThis scene was written primarily by legendary gag man [[Al Boasberg]]. Famously eccentric, Boasberg typed up the finished scene, then shredded the pages into thin pieces and tacked them to his ceiling. It took Irving Thalberg and the brothers hours to cut and paste the scene back together.\n\nDriftwood plans a rendezvous with Mrs. Claypool in his stateroom. Then he finds out how small it is (a third class cabin, about the size of a janitor's closet), and that he, his [[steamer trunk]], and the bed barely fit in it. Driftwood discovers that Fiorello, Tomasso, and Ricardo have stowed away in his steamer trunk and discarded his clothes. Fiorello insists on eating (\"We getta food or we don't go\"). Driftwood calls a steward (\"I say, Stew\") and orders dinner.\n\n{{blockquote|<poem>\n'''Driftwood''': And two medium-boiled eggs.\n'''Fiorello''': ''(inside room)'': And two hard-boiled eggs.\n'''Driftwood''': And two hard-boiled eggs.\n'''Tomasso''': ''(inside room)'': (honk)\n'''Driftwood''': Make that ''three'' hard boiled eggs.\n</poem>}}\n\nThis continues until Fiorello and Tomasso each have ordered about a dozen hard-boiled eggs and Driftwood has ordered about everything else &ndash; including coffee to sober up some stewed prunes. This is just a set-up for the famous \"Stateroom Scene\", in which a total of 15 people crowd into Driftwood's tiny cabin.\n\nThe three stowaways have to hide out in the room while a parade of people walk in, asking to either use the cabin, or to perform their regular duties. Crammed into this little space at the end of the scene are Driftwood, Fiorello, Tomasso, Ricardo, two cleaning ladies who make up the bed, a manicurist (Manicurist: \"Do you want your nails long or short?\" Driftwood: \"You better make them short, it's getting kind of crowded in here!\"), a ship's engineer and his fat assistant, a young woman passenger using the phone to call her Aunt Minnie, a maid (Maid: \"I come to mop up. Driftwood: \"You'll have to start on the ceiling.\") and four waiters with trays of hard-boiled eggs. \n(Driftwood: \"Tell Aunt Minnie to send up a bigger room.\") All of the foregoing tumble out into the hallway when Mrs. Claypool opens the door.\n\n===Contract scene===\nThe contract scene between Driftwood and Fiorello (\"the party of the first part ...\"):\n\n{{blockquote|<poem>\n'''Fiorello''': Hey, wait, wait. What does this say here, this thing here?\n'''Driftwood''': Oh, that? Oh, that's the usual clause that's in every contract. That just says, it says, 'if any of the parties participating in this contract are shown not to be in their right mind, the entire agreement is automatically nullified'.\n'''Fiorello''': Well, I don't know...\n'''Driftwood''': It's all right, that's in every contract. That's, that's what they call a sanity clause.\n'''Fiorello''': Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! You can't fool me.

Anobile in ''The Marx Brothers Scrapbook'', Groucho said he was so appalled by an early draft of the script\u2014which was apparently written by [[Bert Kalmar]] and [[Harry Ruby]]\u2014that he shouted, \"Why [_] around with second-rate talent, get Kaufman and Ryskind [to write the screenplay]!\" <ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmIrAQAAIAAJ&q=%22why+fuck+around%22 |title=The Marx Bros. scrapbook \u2013 Groucho Marx, Richard J.

In their Paramount films, the brothers' characters were much more [[anarchism|anarchic]]: they attacked almost anybody who was so unfortunate to cross their paths whether they deserved it or not, albeit comically. Thalberg, however, felt that this made the brothers unsympathetic, particularly to female filmgoers. So in the MGM films, the brothers were recast as more helpful characters, saving most of their comic attacks for the villains.\n\nThough some Marx Brothers fans disliked these changes, Thalberg was vindicated when the film became a solid hit. It helped that the film contained some of what fans consider to be among the brothers' funniest and most memorable routines. These routines were carefully honed in a series of live [[Theatre|stage]] performances, as the brothers took to the road and performed the new material around the country before filming began.\n\nHowever, according to [[Oscar Levant]], the first preview of the finished film in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] was a \"disaster\", with \"hardly a laugh\" as was the second. Thalberg and [[George S. Kaufman]] spent days in the editing room, adjusting the timing to match the rhythm of a stage performance. About nine minutes was cut from the running time, and the result was a hit.<ref>Oscar Levant, ''[[The Unimportance of Being Oscar]]'', Pocket Books 1969 (reprint of G.P. Putnam 1968), p. 67. {{ISBN|0-671-77104-3}}.</ref>\n\n==Box office==\n[[File:A Night at the Opera lobby card.jpg|thumb|upright=1.13|[[Lobby card]]]]\n\nThe film grossed a total (domestic and foreign) of $1,815,000: $1,164,000 from the US and Canada and $651,000 elsewhere. It made a profit of $90,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\n===Opera===\nTrue to its title, the film includes adaptations of some real [[opera]] scenes from ''[[I Pagliacci]]'' and ''[[Il Trovatore]]'', featuring the ''Miserere'' duet sung by [[Kitty Carlisle]] and [[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]]. The opera setting also allowed MGM to add big production song numbers (which were one of this studio's specialties), such as the song \"[[Alone (1935 song)|Alone]]\", with the departure of the steamship, and the song \"Cosi Cosa\" with the [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] [[buffet]] and dancing.\n\nCarlisle and Jones were both trained in operatic singing and provided their own singing voices in the film. [[Walter Woolf King]] was a trained [[baritone]], but he portrayed a [[tenor]] in the film. His singing was dubbed by [[Metropolitan Opera]] tenor [[Tandy MacKenzie]].\n\n===Subsequent re-editing===\nThe film originally was to have begun with each of the Marx Brothers taking turns roaring instead of [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] (MGM's iconic mascot); Harpo was to have honked his horn. This unique opening was created, but not used in the released film because MGM studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]] felt the parody would cheapen the respected trademark. It turned up years later, however, in a re-release trailer for the film.<ref name=\"IMDb\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026778/trivia ''A Night at the Opera'' trivia at the Internet Movie Database.]</ref><ref name=\"Louvish\">''Monkey Business: The Lives and Legends of the Marx Brothers'' (Hardcover) by Simon Louvish. Thomas Dunne Books; 1st U.S. edition (2000), {{ISBN|0-312-25292-7}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to MGM's dialogue cutting continuity and [[Leonard Maltin]]'s audio commentary on the current DVD release, the film originally began (after the opening credits) with the image of a \"boat on canal\". A superimposed title read, \"ITALY \u2013 WHERE THEY SING ALL DAY AND GO TO THE OPERA AT NIGHT\", and was followed by a musical number featuring bits and pieces from Leoncavallo's ''[[Pagliacci]]'' performed by \"everyday\" Italians: a street sweeper sings part of the prologue (\"Un nido di memorie...\") as he greets a man who then hands out opera tickets to a group of children emerging from a store; the children respond with \"la-la-la-la-la, verso un paese strano\" (from \"Stridono lass\u00f9\"); a \"captain\" comes down a set of steps, salutes a sentry, then bursts into \"[[Vesti la giubba]]\"; then, a [[lap dissolve]] into a hotel lobby, where a \"baggage man\" is rolling a trunk and crooning about \"nettare divino\" (\"divine nectar\"); a waiter joins the baggage man in song, enters the dining room, and sings as he serves a man who for a few notes also sings; the waiter then crosses the dining room to speak to Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont), marking the beginning of the film in existing copies.\n\nIn his commentary, Maltin repeats an assertion originally made by Glenn Mitchell in ''The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia''<ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite book\n  | last = Mitchell\n  | first = Glenn\n  | title = ''The Mark Brothers Encyclopedia''\n  | publisher = BT.

Both Groucho and Harpo stated this as fact in their memoirs,<ref name=\"Groucho\">''Groucho and Me'' by Groucho Marx. {{ISBN|0-306-80666-5}}</ref><ref name=\"Harpo\">[[Harpo Marx|Marx, Harpo]] (1961). ''Harpo Speaks!''. New York: B. Geis Associates; New York: Limelight Editions, 1985, {{ISBN|0-87910-036-2}}.</ref> and Leonard Maltin repeats it in the DVD commentary. But this could not have occurred, because Sam Marx had died in 1933, during pre-production of ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', two years before ''A Night at the Opera'' was released.<ref name=\"Louvish\"/> The rumor arose because Frenchy had had such a cameo appearance in the Marx Brothers' earlier ''[[Monkey Business (1931 film)|Monkey Business]]''. There is, however, a reference to the Marx Brothers' mother, [[Minnie Marx]], during the stateroom scene, in which a woman asks, \"Is my Aunt Minnie in here?\"<ref name=\"IMDb\"/>\n\nPart of the concept of casting the Marx Brothers as stowaways on a ship was recycled from ''Monkey Business''. As Groucho's and Margaret Dumont's characters are boarding the ocean liner, Dumont asks Groucho, \"Are you sure you have everything, Otis?\"; Groucho replies, \"I've never had any complaints yet.\" In two different interviews with Dick Cavett on ''The Dick Cavett Show \u2013 Comic Legends'' DVD, Groucho claimed that that exchange of dialogue was banned in a majority of states when the film was released because it was too suggestive, although the number of states varied with different tellings of the story.\n\n===Hungarian rediscovery===\nIn 2008, a film student reported that the Hungarian National Film Archive possesses a longer print of the film.<ref name=\"hungary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marx-brothers.org/marxology/opera.htm |title=Timphus, Stefan. ''A Night At The Opera: The Hungarian Discoveries'' |publisher=Marx-brothers.org |access-date=2013-12-25}}</ref> While the print does not contain the opening musical number, it does contain several excised lines referencing Italy that had been cut sometime after the film's original release. With the opening number still missing, it may be that this scene was cut before the subsequent edits were made. However, the discovery of the Hungarian print has not yet been independently verified, and [[Turner Entertainment]], who owns the rights to the film, has not indicated that any restoration is forthcoming.\n\n===Hidden material===\nIn the scene where the three stowaways are impersonating \"the three greatest [[aviator]]s in the world\", Driftwood seems to talk gibberish with the dignitaries. Actually it is English; if played backwards, it can be heard what they are saying (\"This man is accusing you of being impostors\", etc.). It was recorded normally, then reversed and dubbed over the scene in post-production.<ref name=\"filmsite\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/night.html |title=Analysis of ''A Night at the Opera'' by Tim Dirks at |publisher=Filmsite.org |access-date=2013-12-25}}</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n*\"[[Alone (1935 song)|Alone]]\" ([[Nacio Herb Brown]] and [[Arthur Freed]])\n*\"[[Santa Lucia (song)|Santa Lucia]]\"\n*\"[[Luigi Mercantini|Garibaldi Hymn]]\" \n*\"[[All I Do Is Dream of You]]\"\n*\"Cosi-Cosa\" ([[Bronis\u0142aw Kaper]] and [[Walter Jurmann]])\n*\"[[Take Me Out to the Ballgame]]\"\n*\"Stridono lass\u00f9\" (from ''[[I Pagliacci]]'')\n* Prelude to ''[[Il trovatore]]''\n*\"[[Anvil Chorus]]\" (from ''Il trovatore'')\n*\"Stride la vampa\" (from ''Il trovatore'')\n*\"[[Di quella pira]]\" (from ''Il trovatore'')\n*\"Miserere\", (From ''Il trovatore'')\n\n==Style change==\n''A Night at the Opera'' began a new era for the Marx Brothers' style of comedy. Whereas their previous comedies at [[Paramount Pictures]] consisted of a constant barrage of jokes within a loosely plotted storyline, ''A Night at the Opera'' was calculated comedy. Producer [[Irving Thalberg]] insisted on a strong story structure, making the Brothers more sympathetic characters, interweaving their comedy with romantic plots and non-comic spectacular musical numbers. The targets of their mischief were largely confined to clear villains. Thalberg's logic was that the Marxes could get \"twice the box office with half the laughs\", believing their films would attract a wider audience.<ref name=stables>{{Cite book |last = Stables |first = Kate |title = The Marx Bros. |publisher = Chartwell Books, Inc. |year = 1992 |location = [[Secaucus, New Jersey|Secaucus]], New Jersey |isbn = 1-55521-793-1}}</ref> Groucho himself agreed with Thalberg's rationale. In his autobiography, ''Groucho and Me'', he wrote of the Marx Brothers' 13 films, \"Two were far above average. Some of the others were pretty good. Some were deplorable. The best two were made by Thalberg\"\u2014a reference not only to ''A Night at the Opera'' but ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZiOk7VWkigC&q=%22the+best+two%22 |title=Groucho and me \u2013 Groucho Marx \u2013 Google Boeken |isbn=9780671677817 |access-date=2013-12-25|last1=Marx |first1=Groucho |year=1989 }}</ref>\n\nAnother idea which Thalberg consented to, was that before filming would commence on an upcoming film, the Marx Brothers would try out the new material on the vaudeville stage, working on comic timing and learning which jokes and gags earned a laugh and which did not. Jokes were planted accordingly, so the laughs could be timed correctly.<ref name=stables/> What was to become the famous \"stateroom\" scene was nearly eliminated because it was not getting any laughs. One evening the Marx Brothers threw away the script and ad-libbed the whole scene. As a result, a weak scene was transformed into one of their all-time classics.{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}}\n\nIn ''A Night at the Opera'', each of the brothers' characters was refined: Groucho was somewhat less nonsensical, and less trouble; Chico became less of a scammer and gained ''some'' intelligence; Harpo became less mischievous and more sympathetic. The film dives straight into a plot and accompanying comedy, with every scene having a clear beginning, middle, and end. The end consisted of a grand finale in the traditional MGM musical fashion, something lacking from the brothers' Paramount efforts.<ref name=stables/>\n\n''A Night at the Opera'' established a basic formula that was utilized in every subsequent film the Marx Brothers made at MGM:\n* a friendship existing between the romantic couple and Chico\n* establishing sympathy for Harpo\n* Chico and Groucho going through an extensive verbal routine\n* Harpo joining as Chico's partner (or brother)\n* lush surroundings as a backdrop to the brothers' lunacy\n* a key scene with all three Marxes\n* a fall from grace\n* a rebound on a grand scale in which everything is righted<ref name=stables/>\n\n==Reputation and legacy==\n\nContemporary reviews were positive. [[Andre Sennwald]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"If 'A Night at the Opera' is a trifle below their best, it is also considerably above the standard of laughter that has been our portion since they quit the screen.

The book's title also parodies the name of the movie.\n\n'''Sanity clause'''\n*The British punk band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] used Chico's quote (\"There ain't no sanity clause\") as a title for [[There Ain't No Sanity Clause|a 1980 single]].\n*''[[Detective Comics]] #826'' pays homage to the film. In it the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] captures [[Tim Drake]], the third [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and takes him on a mad spree in a car, running over anyone they encounter over the Christmas season. When the Joker plans to kill a street [[Santa Claus]], Robin distracts him by saying \"You can't fool me. There ain't no Sanity Claus.\" The Joker laughs and they get in an argument over which [[Marx Brothers]] film is the source of the gag. Robin claims it is from ''[[The Big Store]]''. The Joker is distracted long enough for Robin to attack him and escape. The Joker himself uses the line in ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]''.\n\n'''General'''\n*The British rock group [[Queen (band)|Queen]] paid homage to this film by naming [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|their 1975 studio album]] after it. Their follow-up album, ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]'', was also named after a [[A Day at the Races (film)|Marx Brothers film]].\n*The film's script is credited as the basis for the 1992 film ''[[Brain Donors]]'', executive produced by [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] of ''[[Airplane!]]'' and ''[[The Naked Gun]]'' fame.\n*In the 1990 film ''[[The Freshman (1990 film)|The Freshman]]'', \"Rodolfo Lassparri\" is the alias used on [[Matthew Broderick]]'s [[passport]].\n*In the 1993 film ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'' (also released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]), Kitty Carlisle appears in the small role of Mrs. Bannister; during production of the film, the idea of naming her character either Rosa Castaldi or Rosa Baroni was discussed as a tribute to her role in ''A Night at the Opera'' nearly sixty years earlier, but the idea never came to fruition.\n*The German power metal band [[Blind Guardian]] paid homage to this film by naming [[A Night at the Opera (Blind Guardian album)|one of their albums]] after it.\n*The demented main character played by veteran horror actor [[Bill Moseley]] in [[Rob Zombie]]'s films ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'', ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'', and ''[[3 From Hell]]'' is named Otis B. Driftwood. He is the older brother of Baby Firefly, and stepson to Cutter \"Captain Spaulding\" Firefly. He takes over leadership of the family of killers following Captain Spaulding's prison execution in ''3 From Hell''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of United States comedy films]]\n\n==References==\n'''Informational notes'''\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category|A Night at the Opera}}\n* {{AFI film|965|A Night at the Opera}}\n* [http://www.Marx-Brothers.org Marx-Brothers.org]\n* {{IMDb title|0026778|A Night at the Opera}}\n* {{tcmdb title|344|A Night at the Opera}}\n* {{Amg movie|35272|A Night at the Opera}}\n* [http://www.filmsite.org/night.html Full description of ''A Night at the Opera'' from Filmsite.org]\n* [https://www.marxbrotherscouncilpodcast.com/2020/11/episode-29-make-that-three-hard-boiled.html ''The Marx Brothers Council Podcast'' analyzing \"A Night at the Opera\"]\n\n{{Marx Brothers}}\n{{Sam Wood}}\n{{Irving Thalberg}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Night At The Opera, A}}\n[[Category:1935 films]]\n[[Category:1930s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1935 musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about opera]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sam Wood]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Irving Thalberg]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Herbert Stothart]]\n[[Category:Films set in opera houses]]\n[[Category:Films set on ships]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Buster Keaton]]\n[[Category:Marx Brothers (film series)]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:1930s American films]]"}]}}}}
