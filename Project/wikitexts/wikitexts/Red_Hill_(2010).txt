The film stars [[Ryan Kwanten]], [[Steve Bisley]] and [[Tom E. Lewis]].\n\n==Plot==\nShane Cooper ([[Ryan Kwanten]]), a young police officer, relocates to the small town of Red Hill with his pregnant wife Alice ([[Claire van der Boom]]). On his first day on the job, he is shown hostility from William \"Old Bill\" Jones ([[Steve Bisley]]), the head of the police force, for being unable to find his gun and getting shot on duty when he could not bring himself to fire his weapon on an armed boy.\n\nShortly afterwards, the police learn that Jimmy Conway ([[Tom E. Lewis]]), a convicted murderer who was arrested by Old Bill for killing his wife, has escaped from prison. Knowing that Jimmy will return to town to seek revenge, Old Bill orders his officers and a group of civilians to arm themselves and shoot Jimmy on sight.\n\nOld Bill's men prove to be no match for Jimmy, who remorselessly kills officers and armed civilians.  The convict encounters Shane but lets him live. When Shane finds Old Bill, he confronts Bill over the fact that Jimmy spared his life and learns that Bill has refused to call for backup from a nearby town. Shane draws his gun on Bill, but again finds himself unable to fire it and is subsequently knocked out and handcuffed to a table.\n\nShane escapes and uses a satellite phone at Gleason's farm to contact the nearby police for backup. During the call Shane discovers Gleason ([[Cliff Ellen]]) on the verge of hanging himself; when Shane talks to him, the farmer reveals that Jimmy Conway is innocent of the murder of his wife. The murder was the work of Old Bill and his men, who set fire to Jimmy's house after raping and killing his wife, revenge for Jimmy's interference in a proposed railroad extension that would have gone through Red Hill. Gleason informs Shane that he has a written document of what really happened, before committing suicide. Now knowing the real reason why Jimmy returned to Red Hill, Shane returns home to get his gun, which Alice found while he was on duty.\n\nNear the outskirts of town, Old Bill sets stacks of hay on fire to attract Jimmy's attention. Jimmy arrives and kills Bill's last remaining deputies, but is stopped from finishing Bill off when two of Bill's friends arrive and hold him at gunpoint. Shane also arrives and saves Jimmy by shooting Bill's friends after informing Bill that he knows the truth.\n\nThe police backup arrives and confront Jimmy as he prepares to get his revenge on Old Bill. Despite Shane's efforts to get him to drop his gun, Jimmy kills Old Bill and is promptly shot by the police. Before dying, the seemingly mute Jimmy tells Shane that his wife was pregnant with his son.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Kwanten]] as Shane Cooper\n* [[Steve Bisley]] as William \"Old Bill\" Jones\n* [[Tom E.
