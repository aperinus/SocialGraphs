It is produced by Bancroft's husband, [[Mel Brooks]]. The screenplay by [[Hugh Whitemore]] is based on a play by [[James Roose-Evans]], which itself is an adaptation of the [[84 Charing Cross Road|1970 epistolary memoir of the same name]] by [[Helene Hanff]] \u2014 a compilation of letters between Hanff and [[Frank Doel]] dating from 1949 to 1968. Several characters who are not in the play were added for the film, including Hanff's [[Manhattan]] friends and Doel's wife Nora.\n\nThe film garnered mainly positive reviews from critics, as well as receiving numerous industry awards and nominations. Bancroft won the [[BAFTA Award]] for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her portrayal of Hanff. Additionally, Dench was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award]] for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and Whitemore for Best Adapted Screenplay. Dench has said that [[84 Charing Cross Road]] is one of her favourite films in which she has appeared. The film has become something of a cult classic among [[bibliophiles]] and epistophiles.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1971, [[New York City|New Yorker]] Helene Hanff is on an airplane heading for [[London]]. She is on a [[promotional tour]] for her book ''84 Charing Cross Road'' which is about her 20-year correspondence with a secondhand bookshop specializing in [[out-of-print]] books. By the time she arrives in London, the book shop has permanently closed, but she still visits it. To the sound of hammering and a builder's radio, Hanff recalls the first letter she wrote to the shop in 1949.\n\nAs a [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]], at a bookstore in 1949 in New York City, Hanff seeks obscure British literary classics and notices an advertisement in the ''[[Saturday Review of Literature]]'' placed by antiquarian booksellers [[Marks & Co]], located at the titular address in London. She contacts the shop, where chief buyer and manager Frank Doel fulfills her requests. Over time, a long-distance friendship develops between Hanff and Doel and also the other staff members; even Doel's wife corresponds with Hanff. In gratitude for their extraordinary service, Hanff begins sending small gifts: holiday packages and food parcels to compensate for post\u2013war [[Rationing in the United Kingdom#Post-Second World War 1945\u20131954|food shortages in Britain]]. Their correspondence includes discussions about topics as diverse as the sermons of [[John Donne]], how to make [[Yorkshire pudding]], the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[coronation of Elizabeth II]].\n\nHanff intends to visit London and meet her bookseller friends but for various reasons has to postpone her plans. In January 1969, she receives word that Doel has died and the bookshop has closed.\n\nShe finally visits Charing Cross Road and the vacant shop in the summer of 1971.\n\n==Principal cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Anne Bancroft]] as [[Helene Hanff]]\n*[[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Frank Doel]]\n*[[Judi Dench]] as Nora Doel\n*[[Mercedes Ruehl]] as Kay\n*[[Maurice Denham]] as George Martin\n*[[Eleanor David]] as Cecily Farr\n*[[Jean De Baer]] as Maxine Stuart\n*[[Daniel Gerroll]] as Brian\n*[[Wendy Morgan (actress)|Wendy Morgan]] as Megan Wells\n*[[Ian McNeice]] as Bill Humphries\n*[[J.

[She] brings Helene Hanff alive in all her dimensions, in the process creating one of her most memorable characterizations.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790662.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 |title=Variety Reviews \u2013 84 Charing Cross Road \u2013 Film Reviews  |work=Variety.com |date=1986-12-31 |access-date=2012-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn his ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' review, [[Gene Siskel]] wrote: \"Years ago, ''84 Charing Cross Road'' would have been called a 'woman's picture' or a 'perfect matinee.' But it's that and more. It should be irresistible to anyone able to appreciate the goodness of its spirit and its spirited characters.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' observed, \"The film is based on a hit London and New York play, which was based on a best-selling book. Given the thin and unlikely subject matter, that already is a series of miracles. And yet there are people who are pushovers for this material. I should know. I read the book and I saw the play and now I am reviewing the movie, and I still don't think the basic idea is sound... Miss Fiske... was the librarian at the Urbana Free Library when I was growing up... She never had to talk to me about the love of books because she simply exuded it and I absorbed it. She would have loved this movie. Sitting next to her, I suspect, I would have loved it, too. But Miss Fiske is gone now, and I found it pretty slow-going on my own.\"<ref>{{cite web | last=Ebert | first=Roger | title=84 Charing Cross Road | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/84-charing-cross-road-1987 | work=RogerEbert.com | publisher=Ebert Digital LLC | date=March 27, 1987 | access-date=February 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''84 Charing Cross Road'' a less favourable review, citing it as \"a movie guaranteed to put all teeth on edge . . . a movie of such unrelieved genteelness that it makes one long to head for [[Schrafft's (restaurant chain)|Schrafft's]] for a double-[[gin]] martini, straight up, and a stack of cinnamon toast from which the crusts have been removed.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Canby |first=Vincent |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE1D6113DF930A25751C0A961948260 |title=Movie Review - 84 Charing Cross Road - FILM: BANCROFT IN '84 CHARING CROSS' - NYTimes.com |website=Movies.nytimes.com |date=1987-02-13 |access-date=2012-07-04}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nIn its opening weekend in the U.S. the film grossed $24,350 at one theater.
