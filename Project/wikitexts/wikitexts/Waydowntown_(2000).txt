The film is a [[dark comedy]] that explores office culture and its effects and often uses [[surrealism]] to achieve its thematic goals.\n\nThe film is set in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], where many downtown buildings are connected by the [[Plus 15]], an extensive network of indoor [[skyway|skywalk]]s.  Because of this network, the hustle and bustle of the traditional \"main street\" has been replaced by recirculated air, food courts, and fluorescent lights.  The result is a bleak and often humorous [[dark comedy]] about Canadian corporate culture.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film centres on a group of office colleagues in downtown Calgary, Alberta, who bet a month's salary on who can last the longest without going outside by using [[+15|the system of covered walkways that connect the buildings]]. The film takes place over one lunch hour on day 28 of the month-long competition.  Things start to become complicated as the office prepares for the company founder's retirement party.\n\nThe film's title is derived from a particular form of suicide where one smashes the (non-openable) window of one's high-rise office and then jumps through. In the movie, one of the characters has accumulated a 2-litre pop bottle full of marbles in the hopes of breaking his window. The dark joke for this is referenced in the film as: \"a 15 bus takes you downtown, [but] a bottle of marbles takes you way downtown.\"\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Fab Filippo]] as Tom Bennett\n*[[Don McKellar]] as Brad\n*[[Marya Delver]] as Sandra West\n*[[Gordon Currie (actor)|Gordon Currie]] as Curt Schwin\n*Jennifer Clement as Vicki\n*Tammy Isbell as Kathy\n*Tobias Godson as Randy\n*James McBurney as Phil\n\n==Production==\nThe majority of the film was shot in [[TD Square]], the [[Calgary Eaton Centre]], and [[Bankers Hall]]. The company's offices are situated in the [[TD Canada Trust Tower, Calgary|TD Canada Trust Tower]]. The low-budget film was shot on digital and later transferred to [[35 mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has a 70% freshness rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Most critics praise the satirical elements, casting, and plot. Others find the film to be humourless and incomplete, and the plot to be too nonsensical and uninteresting.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Waydowntown |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waydowntown |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> The film won the [[Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film|Best Canadian Film Award]] prize at the 2000 [[Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Great Canadian Film Directors |publisher=University of Alberta |year=2007 |isbn=9780888644794 |editor-last=Melnyk |editor-first=George |pages=374}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Goodridge |first=Mike |date=September 18, 2000 |title=waydowntown, Crouching Tiger top Toronto prizes |url=https://www.screendaily.com/waydowntown-crouching-tiger-top-toronto-prizes/403636.article |access-date=20 September 2022 |website=[[Screen Daily]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shown at the [[Calgary International Film Festival]] on September 19, 2019, to celebrate its 20th anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date= |title=Waydowntown |url=https://www.calgaryfilm.com/films/2019/waydowntown/ |url-status=live |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=November 14, 2019 |website=Calgary International Film Festival}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* ''[[Office Space]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*''[https://web.archive.org/web/20091112074629/http://waydowntown.com:80/ Waydowntown]'' website\n* {{IMDb title|id=0219405|title=Waydowntown}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=waydowntown|title=waydowntown}}\n*AV Club [https://film.avclub.com/waydowntown-1798192474 DVD Review]\n\n{{TFCA Award for Best Canadian Film}}\n{{TIFF Best Canadian Film}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000s business films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Canadian black comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gary Burns]]\n[[Category:Films set in Calgary]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Calgary]]\n[[Category:Canadian satirical films]]\n[[Category:2000 black comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Canadian independent films]]\n[[Category:2000 independent films]]"}]}}}}
