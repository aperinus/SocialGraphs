It stars [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Selma Blair]], [[Matthew Davis]], [[Victor Garber]], and [[Jennifer Coolidge]]. The story follows [[Elle Woods]] (Witherspoon), a [[Fraternities and sororities#Sororities|sorority]] girl who attempts to win back her ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Davis) by getting a [[Juris Doctor]] degree at [[Harvard Law School]], and in the process, overcomes [[Blonde stereotype|stereotypes against blondes]] and triumphs as a successful lawyer.\n\nThe outline of ''Legally Blonde'' originated from Brown's experiences as a blonde going to [[Stanford Law School]] while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]''  magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her peers. In 2000, Brown met producer [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]], who helped her develop her manuscript into a novel. Platt brought in screenwriters McCullah Lutz and Smith to adapt the book into a motion picture. The project caught the attention of director Luketic, an Australian newcomer who came to Hollywood on the success of his quirky debut short film ''[[Titsiana Booberini]]''. \"I had been reading scripts for two years, not finding anything I could put my own personal mark on, until ''Legally Blonde'' came around,\" Luketic said.\n\nThe film was released on July 13, 2001, and was a hit with audiences, grossing $141 million worldwide on an $18 million budget, as well as receiving moderately positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going to Witherspoon's performance. It was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture: Musical or Comedy]]. Witherspoon received a Golden Globe nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]], and the 2002 [[MTV Movie Awards|MTV Movie Award]] for [[2002 MTV Movie Awards#Best Female Performance|Best Female Performance]].\n\nThe box office success led to [[Legally Blonde (franchise)|a series of films]]: a 2003 sequel, ''[[Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde]]'', and a 2009 [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] spin-off, ''[[Legally Blondes]]''. Additionally, ''[[Legally Blonde (musical)|Legally Blonde: The Musical]]'' premiered on January 23, 2007, in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and opened in [[New York City]] at the [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on April 29, 2007, starring [[Laura Bell Bundy]].\n\nIn May 2020, it was announced that [[Mindy Kaling]] and [[Dan Goor]] were signed to write a third film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2020/05/legally-blonde-3-mindy-kaling-dan-goor-giving-fresh-take-to-mgm-hello-sunshine-sequel-1202937634/ |title='Legally Blonde 3': Mindy Kaling & Dan Goor Giving Fresh Take To MGM-Hello Sunshine Sequel |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |date=May 18, 2020 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=May 19, 2020}}</ref> The third film was set to release mid 2022 but has been delayed to an undisclosed date.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400-700 words long.-->\n[[Fashion merchandising]] student and [[sorority]] girl [[Elle Woods]] is taken to an expensive restaurant by her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III. She expects a proposal, but he breaks up with her instead. Intending to go to Harvard Law School and become a successful politician, he believes that Elle is not \"serious\" enough for that kind of life. Elle believes she can win Warner back if she shows herself capable of achieving the same things. After months of studying, Elle scores a 179 on the [[Law School Admission Test]]<ref>\"LSAT scores can range from a low of 120 to a perfect score of 180.\" https://www.thoughtco.com/whats-a-good-lsat-score-3211993#</ref> and, combined with her 4.0 [[GPA]], is accepted to [[Harvard Law School]].\n\nUpon arriving at Harvard, Elle's [[Southern California|SoCal]] personality is a complete contrast to her [[Northeastern United States|East Coast]] classmates, who frequently distrust her. She soon encounters Warner but discovers he is engaged to his old girlfriend, Vivian Kensington, who considers Elle a fool. Later, Elle tells Warner that she intends to apply for one of her professor's internships, but he tells her that she is wasting her time as she is not intelligent enough. Realizing that Warner will never take her back or take her seriously, Elle finds motivation to prove herself by working hard and demonstrating her understanding of the subject.\n\nThe following semester, Professor Callahan, the school's most respected teacher, decides to take on some first-year interns to help with a high-profile case. Among those chosen are Elle, Warner, and Vivian. Callahan is defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, one of Elle's role models. Accused of murdering her husband, Brooke is unwilling to produce her alibi, and she later reveals to Elle that she was having [[liposuction]], a fact that would ruin her reputation, which Elle promises not to disclose. Vivian gains a new respect for Elle and reveals that Warner could not get into Harvard without his father's help. Emmett Richmond, Callahan's junior partner, has also taken notice of her potential.\n\nOne night, Callahan tries seducing Elle, who now believes that is why she got the internship. Devastated, she quits and nearly returns home to California, telling Emmett what happened. When he tells Brooke, she fires Callahan, replacing him with Elle under Emmett's guidance; as she is only a law student, Brooke cites a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that law students may represent clients if they do so under the supervision of a licensed attorney.\n\nElle begins to cross-examine Brooke's stepdaughter, Chutney, and catches her in a lie when she discovers significant inconsistencies in her story: Chutney testified that she was home during her father's murder but did not hear the gunshot because she was in the shower after [[Perm (hairstyle)|getting her hair permed]] that morning. Elle says that washing permed hair within the first 24 hours would deactivate the [[ammonium thioglycolate]], pointing out that Chutney's curls are still intact. A distraught Chutney admits her culpability in inadvertently killing her father as she really intended to kill Brooke because she hated the fact that her father married someone the same age as her.\n\nAfter the trial, Chutney is sent to jail, and Warner approaches Elle and asks her to take him back as she has proven herself. She rejects him, realizing that he is shallow and a \"complete bonehead\". However, she and Vivian become good friends, especially after Vivian dumps Warner. Elle gives the graduation speech two years later, while Warner graduates with no honors, no job offers, and no girlfriend. Emmett has started his own law firm and has been dating Elle for two years, with plans to propose to her later that night.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Elle Woods]]\n* [[Moonie (dog)|Moonie]] as Bruiser Woods\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Emmett Richmond\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Vivian Kensington\n* [[Matthew Davis]] as Warner Huntington III\n* [[Victor Garber]] as Professor Callahan\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Paulette Bonafont\u00e9\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Professor Elspeth Stromwell\n* [[Ali Larter]] as Brooke Taylor-Windham\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Margot\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Serena McGuire\n* [[Francesca P.
