The film tells the story of [[Ron Woodroof]] ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), an [[AIDS]] patient diagnosed in the mid-1980s when [[HIV]]/AIDS treatments were under-researched, while the disease was not understood and was highly stigmatized. As part of the experimental AIDS treatment movement, he smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas for treating his symptoms, and distributed them to fellow people with AIDS by establishing the \"Dallas Buyers Club\" while facing opposition from the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Two fictional supporting characters, Dr. Eve Saks ([[Jennifer Garner]]), and Rayon ([[Jared Leto]]), were composite roles created from interviews with transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors. Presidential biographer and PEN-USA winner [[Bill Minutaglio]] wrote the first magazine profile of the Dallas Buyers Club in 1992. The article, which featured interviews with Woodroof and also recreated his dramatic international exploits, attracted widespread attention from filmmakers and journalists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10612550/Dallas-Buyers-Club-The-not-so-straight-truth.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10612550/Dallas-Buyers-Club-The-not-so-straight-truth.html |archive-date=January 11, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Dallas Buyers Club: The not-so-straight truth|first=Alex|last=Hannaford|date=February 7, 2014|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nScreenwriter Borten interviewed Woodroof in 1992 and wrote the script, which he polished with writer Wallack in 2000, and then sold to producer [[Robbie Brenner]]. Several other actors, directors, and producers who were attached at various times to the development of the film left the project. [[Universal Pictures]] also tried to make the film, but did not. A couple of screenwriters wrote drafts that were rejected. In 2009, producer Brenner involved Matthew McConaughey, because of his Texas origins, the same as Woodroof's. Brenner selected the first draft, written by Borten and Wallack, for the film, and then Vall\u00e9e was set to direct the film. [[Principal photography]] began in November 2012, in [[New Orleans]], continuing for 25 days of filming, which also included shooting in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. Brenner and [[Rachel Winter]] co-produced the film. The official soundtrack album featured various artists, and was released digitally on October 29, 2013, by the [[Relativity Music Group]].\n\n''Dallas Buyers Club'' premiered at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released theatrically in the United States on November 1, 2013, by [[Focus Features]], entering wide release on November 22. The film grossed over $52 million worldwide against a budget of $5 million. The film received widespread critical acclaim, resulting in [[List of accolades received by Dallas Buyers Club|numerous accolades]]. Most praised the performances of McConaughey and Leto, who received the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] and for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], respectively, at the [[86th Academy Awards]], making this the first film since ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'' (2003), and only the fifth film ever, to win both awards. The film also won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], and garnered nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn July 1985, promiscuous [[Dallas]] electrician and rodeo cowboy [[Ron Woodroof]] is diagnosed with [[AIDS]] and given 30 days to live. Being heterosexual, he initially refuses to accept the diagnosis until he remembers having unprotected sex with a prostitute who was an [[drug injection|intravenous drug]] user years prior. His family and friends ostracize him, mistakenly assuming he contracted AIDS from homosexual relations. He is fired from his job, and evicted from his home. His doctor, Eve Saks, tells him an [[antiretroviral drug]] called [[zidovudine]] (AZT) is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients, and is the only drug yet approved for testing in human [[clinical trials]] by the [[FDA]]. To Ron's disappointment, Saks informs him that in the trial, half the patients receive the drug and the other half a [[placebo]], as this is the only way they can determine if it is working.\n\nWoodroof bribes a hospital worker to get him AZT which, exacerbated by his [[cocaine]] use, sees his health deteriorate. Recuperating in hospital, he meets Rayon, a drug addicted, HIV-positive [[trans woman]], to whom he is initially hostile. As his health worsens, he drives to a makeshift Mexican hospital to get more AZT. The facility is run by an American, Dr. Vass, whose U.S. medical license was revoked because aspects of his work with AIDS patients had violated US regulations. Vass warns Woodroof against AZT, telling him it is \"poisonous\", and instead prescribes a cocktail of drugs and nutritional supplements centered on [[Zalcitabine|ddC]] and the protein [[peptide T]], which are not yet approved in the US. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved, and realizes he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. Since the drugs alone are not illegal, he is able to get them over the border by masquerading as a priest, saying they are for personal use. Meanwhile, Saks also begins to notice the negative effects of AZT, but her supervisor, Dr. Sevard, tells her the trials cannot be discontinued.\n\nOver the next year, Woodroof begins selling the drugs in Dallas on the street, at [[gay nightclub]]s, and at [[discotheque]] bars. He reluctantly sets up business with Rayon, since she can bring in more customers. The pair establish the \"Dallas Buyers Club\", charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. Woodroof gradually begins to respect Rayon as a friend. When Woodroof has a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] caused by an overdose of recently acquired [[interferon]], Sevard learns of the club and the alternative medication. He is angry that it is interrupting his trial. The FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Saks agrees that there are benefits to AIDS medicine [[buyers club]]s (of which there are several around the country) but feels powerless to change anything. The processes that the FDA uses to research, test and [[Approved drug#United States|approve drugs]] are seen as flawed and a part of the problem for AIDS patients. At that time, the United States and its FDA were seen as particularly conservative by international standards in testing and approving anti-AIDS drugs, and hostile to imported drugs to the point they were made contraband.<ref name=\"cma\">{{Cite journal |last=Singer |first=Merrill |date=1994-10-01 |title=Aids and the health crisis of the U.S. urban poor; the perspective of critical medical anthropology |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536%2894%2990205-4 |journal=Social Science & Medicine |language=en |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=931\u2013948 |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(94)90205-4 |pmid=7992126 |issn=0277-9536}}</ref> Saks and Woodroof strike up a friendship.\n\nThe FDA gets a warrant to raid the Buyers Club, but can ultimately do nothing but fine Woodroof. In 1987, the FDA changes its regulations, making any unapproved drug illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is [[Cocaine dependence|addicted to cocaine]], begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her [[life insurance]] policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon has died after being taken to the hospital. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she had been linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug ineffective. She refuses, and insists that she will have to be fired instead.\n\nAs time passes, Woodroof shows more compassion towards gay, lesbian, and transgender members of the club and making money becomes less of a concern; His priority is now the provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in late 1987 he files a lawsuit against the FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is sympathetic toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the power to do anything. As the film ends, the on-screen text reveals that the FDA did later allow Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of the disease's effects in 1992, 7 years later than his doctors initially predicted.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Dallas Buyers Club 08 (9765736361).jpg|175px|thumbnail|right|alt=A profile picture of a middle-aged man with brown color, smiling at something.|McConaughey at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] premiere]]\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as [[Ron Woodroof]],<ref name=\"casting1\" /> a real-life [[AIDS]] patient who smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas when he found them effective at improving his symptoms.

As a result, it was only used by doctors for a relatively short time.<ref name=\"Matthews\"/> A third treatment promoted by Woodroof, called Compound Q ([[Trichosanthin]]), was specifically linked to two deaths during trials, and therefore, was not used by doctors thereafter.
