Shot mostly in and around the Norwegian capital [[Oslo]], the film, which was released in 2001, is primarily  based on [[Ingvar Ambj\u00f8rnsen]]'s novel ''Br\u00f8dre i blodet'' (\"Blood brothers\", 1996), one of a series of four featuring the Elling character \u2013 the others are ''Utsikt til paradiset'' (\"A view of paradise\", 1993), ''Fugledansen'' (\"The bird dance\", 1995), and ''Elsk meg i morgen'' (\"Love me tomorrow\", 1999). The film was followed by an original prequel not based on any of the novels, ''Mors Elling'' (2003), and a sequel, ''Elsk meg i morgen'' (2005) based on the fourth and last book in the series.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie deals with the main character, Elling, a man with generalized anxiety in his 40s, and his struggle to function normally in society. He suffers from anxiety, dizziness, and neurotic tendencies, preventing him from living on his own. Elling has lived with his mother for his entire life, and when his mother dies, the authorities take him from the apartment where he has always lived and send him to an institution. His roommate is the simpleminded, sex-obsessed Kjell Bjarne. The Norwegian government pays for the two to move into an apartment in Oslo, where every day is a challenge as they must prove they can get out into the real world and lead relatively normal lives. With the help of social worker Frank and a few new friends, they learn to break free from their respective conditions. Elling eventually discovers a new vocation as a rebel poet, as Kjell befriends a pregnant woman with a drink problem which finally becomes a romance. The film ends with both men as firm friends, embarking on new lives filled with hope.\n\n==Cast==\n*'''Elling''' \u2014 ([[Per Christian Ellefsen]])\n*'''Kjell Bjarne''' \u2014 ([[Sven Nordin]])\n*'''Reidun Nordsletten''' \u2014 ([[Marit Pia Jacobsen]])\n*'''Frank \u00c5sli''' \u2014 ([[J\u00f8rgen Langhelle]])\n*'''Alfons J\u00f8rgensen''' \u2014 ([[Per Christensen]])\n*'''Gunn''' \u2014 ([[Hilde Olausson]])\n*'''Hauger''' \u2014 ([[Ola Otnes]])\n*'''Johanne''' \u2014 ([[Eli Anne Linnestad]])\n*'''Cecilie Kornes''' \u2014 ([[Cecilie A.
