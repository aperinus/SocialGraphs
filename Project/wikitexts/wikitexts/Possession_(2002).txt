It is based on the 1990 [[Possession: A Romance|novel of the same name]] by British author [[A. S. Byatt]], who won the [[Booker Prize]] for it the year it was published.\n\n==Synopsis==\nLiterary scholars American Roland Michell and British Maud Bailey independently find that the socially antagonistic relationship between the [[Victorian era]] poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte may have concealed a secret connection as lovers. Ash is traditional and conservative and LaMotte is a [[freethinking]] [[bisexual]]. Rival scholars become aware of their efforts and each seeks to be the first at the public disclosure of this major finding about the poets. In a parallel relationship, Michell and Bailey have their own deepening connection.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--In order of film credits-->\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Maud Bailey\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as Roland Michell\n* [[Jeremy Northam]] as Randolph Henry Ash\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Christabel LaMotte\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Blanche Glover\n* [[Toby Stephens]] as Fergus Wolfe\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Euan\n* [[Trevor Eve]] as Cropper\n* [[Tom Hickey (actor)|Tom Hickey]] as Blackadder\n* [[Graham Crowden]] as Sir George\n* [[Anna Massey]] as Lady Bailey\n* [[Holly Aird]] as Ellen Ash\n}}\n\n==Development==\nThree early drafts of the film's screenplay were written by American playwright [[David Henry Hwang]] in the 1990s, but the project languished in pre-production for years.
