Released on September 27, 2005, the film's main plot point concerns [[Stewie Griffin]], following a near death experience, trying to find who he thinks is his [[Biological parent|real father]] after seeing the man on TV. He travels to [[San Francisco]], only to find that the man is him from the future.  The DVD contains [[Audio commentary|commentaries]] and a promo [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)]] says Good News of the ''[[American Dad!]]''.<ref>{{Citation| url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/dvd-reviews/family-guy-presents-stewie-griffin-the-untold-story/2006/01/23/1137864848861.html | contribution = Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story | title = DVD Reviews| first = Michael | last = Idato | date = 23 January 2006 |publisher =  The Age Company Ltd.

Fox had several scenes cut out and other scenes altered to make it only 66 minutes long. The shortened and separated versions of the three segments \u2013 \"Stewie B. Goode\" (written by [[Gary Janetti]] and [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]]), \"Bango Was His Name, Oh!\" (written by [[Alex Borstein]]), and \"Stu and Stewie's Excellent Adventure\" (written by [[Steve Callaghan]]) \u2013 were aired on May 21, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with the [[Film premiere|premiere of the film]], with celebrities such as [[Drew Barrymore]] and her date the [[Kool-Aid Man]], the [[Greased-up Deaf Guy|Greased-Up Deaf Guy]], the [[Evil Monkey]], [[David Bowie]], and the [[Griffin family]] attending. Everyone goes into the theatre where Channel 5 reveals they have hired [[Glenn Quagmire]] to provide them with a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg copy]] of the film. We then see an advertisement for a new movie, ''People Who Look Like They Never Sleep...'', starring [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Vince Vaughn]], and another film, ''The Littlest Bunny'', made by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] and featuring music by [[Randy Newman]]. After this, the film begins.\n\n===Stewie B. Goode===\nWhen the Griffins go swimming at the Quahog Community Pool, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] tries teaching [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] to swim and manages to throw  him into the pool, despite Stewie begging to be put down. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] takes Stewie to [[swimming lessons]], after Stewie nearly drowns,where Stewie meets Brad, a child about his age who is the \"Star Swimmer.\" In jealousy, Stewie does everything he can to steal Brad's glory. As a last resort he tries to kill him by rigging a [[lifeguard]] chair with [[dynamite]] and luring Brad beneath it with [[marzipan]]; however, Stewie's detonator malfunctions, blowing up the legs of the chair and causing it to fall on Stewie, presumbably killing him. He ends up in [[Hell]] with [[Steve Allen]]. When Stewie is revived by Lois, he believes it is a sign for him to be a good boy.\n\nAfter Peter learns that the new video store will not let him rent [[pornography]], he vents his frustration in front of newscaster [[Tom Tucker (Family Guy)|Tom Tucker]], who gives him a job at Quahog 5 hosting a segment called \"What Really Grinds My Gears\", in which he [[rant]]s about things that bother him. Peter becomes extremely popular, eventually overshadowing Tucker, who is fired after attempting to distract Peter during filming.\n\nStewie attempts to be a good boy by smothering [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] with affection. Brian finally goads Stewie into reverting to his old, violent ways by crushing a [[spider web]] and eating the [[spider]]. Stewie starts drinking heavily, following Brian's way of coping. Brian attempts to cure Stewie of his [[alcoholism]] by taking him out for a night of drinking at the Drunken Clam. While drunk, Stewie crashes Brian's car through the wall of the bar. Knowing Stewie is Peter's son, Tom takes advantage of the situation and presents footage of the accident at the news station. Peter is fired and Tom is rehired as the anchor. The next morning, Stewie has a [[hangover]] and realizes his lonely existence in the world, wishing that there were someone else to whom he could relate. At the end, Stewie says it is good that he stopped drinking now, so that it would not have any repercussions later in life.\n\n===Bango Was His Name, Oh!===\nPeter buys a [[TiVo]]. While watching it, Stewie spots a man in [[San Francisco]] on the news that has the same face and hairstyle as him. Stewie then believes that he may be his [[Biological father|true father]]. After several failed attempts to raise money for a plane ticket and learning that Quagmire is going on a cross-country tour in which he plans to have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with a different woman in every state of America (and [[Las Vegas|Vegas]]), Brian and Stewie hitch a ride in his [[recreational vehicle|RV]]. At a [[motel]] in [[New Jersey]], Quagmire is handcuffed to a bed and mugged by the latest woman. Then Stewie and Brian drive off with his RV, leaving Quagmire at the motel.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter and Lois are trying to get [[Intimacy|intimate]], but are constantly interrupted by [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Meg Griffin|Meg]]. To solve this problem, Peter and Lois decide to teach the children how to find dates. After several \"lessons\", Peter and Lois send them to the mall. However, Lois is concerned that people will think they're bad parents simply because they wanted their children out of the way so they can be together.\n\nStewie crashes the RV in the [[desert]] after going insane from ingesting an entire bottle of \"[[caffeine pill|West Coast Turnaround]]s\". After wandering through the desert, Stewie breaks down crying and nearly decides to give up until Brian encourages him to keep going. The two manage to get a [[rental car]] and arrive in San Francisco. Stewie mysteriously leaves Brian and confronts the man from TV on a [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]], and is shocked to discover that the man is actually himself from 30 years in the future.\n\n===Stewie and Stu's Excellent Adventure===\n\"Stu\", as Stewie's future self is called, tells Stewie that he is on vacation (Stu explains that rather than just simply travel to different places in the world, people from his [[time travel]] to other time periods). Stu reveals he cannot tell anyone about his time, but when he leaves for his time, Stewie stows away with him. Stewie learns he will not become [[World domination|ruler of the world]] but rather \"a 35-year-old [[Parade (magazine)|''Parade'' magazine]]-reading [[Virginity|virgin]]\". Stewie is further disappointed when, doing a family dinner, he learns Lois is still alive, Meg underwent a [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex change]] shortly after college and is now called Ron, Chris is a [[Police officer|cop]] married to a [[Profanity|foul-mouthed]] [[chain-smoking]] woman called Vanessa whose only interest is sticking Lois and Peter into a [[retirement home]] so she can have their house, and that Brian [[Theobromine poisoning|died after eating chocolate]] out of the garbage and is seen in [[Heaven]] with [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Kurt Cobain]], who all [[Suicide methods#Firearm|shot themselves]]. Stu passes off Stewie as a [[Nicaragua]]n boy named Pablo to everyone until Stu can send him back to his own time.\n\nStewie learns he will work at the Quahog Circuit Shack while living with Rupert, his childhood [[teddy bear]], in a filthy [[apartment]]. Disgusted with the way his life will turn out, Stewie remodels Stu's apartment and gets him to lose his virginity to his co-worker, Fran (though he spends more time crying than having sex). The next day, Fran tells everyone about the humiliating experience, costing Stu his job for having relations with a co-worker. Returning home, he finds that his apartment is on fire due to the stress-relieving candles Stewie put there. With his life now ruined, Stu laments the day of his [[near-death experience]] at the community pool, revealing that, despite Stewie's earlier ascertation that the incident would have no impact on his life, memories of the experience will re-surface when Stewie is 20 years old, causing him to repress most of his major emotions and preventing him from taking any risks.\n\nThey visit Lois (who reveals that she had recognized \"Pablo\" as her \"little Stewie\" immediately) at a retirement home for a [[loan]] and get a new time travel watch, which she agrees to on the condition that Stewie travels back in time to Chris and Vanessa's wedding and kill her as a favor. After saying goodbye to Stu, Stewie travels to the day of the accident (after fulfilling Lois' favor) and prevents himself from getting crushed by the chair. However, future Stewie gets [[Vaporization|vaporized]] by present Stewie, thus creating a [[Temporal paradox|paradox]] and skipping the formalities of Future Stewie disappearing eventually. In the bleachers at the pool, Meg is seen talking to a man named Ron, admitting she likes the name.\n\n===Ending===\n\nAt the end [[Tricia Takanawa]] talks with the fans and asks them how they liked the film, receiving completely negative feedback. After this, Tricia asks the family what they did during the [[Family Guy#Early history and cancellation|show's cancellation]] between Seasons 3 and 4. Peter talks about how he did several [[part-time job]]s that involved wearing costumes, although he always wound up fired because he kept [[Urination|peeing]] in them because he thought it was like an astronaut suit, but when he finally did become an [[astronaut]], he did not believe he had to pee in the suit and almost died. Brian talks about how he met his fans and competed in the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race|Iditarod Dog Race]], only to get very tired and lose. Lois talks about how she became a [[prostitute]] and shows video footage of her trying to beat up a policeman and of her having an argument in a [[convenience store]] over her wanting to taste the chips. Meg talks about entertaining the [[U.S. Navy]] by singing and dressing like [[Cher]] for \"[[If I Could Turn Back Time]]\". However, she was actually repulsing the sailors instead, causing them to abandon and sink the ship they were on. Stewie talks about his appearances in those \"damn\" [[talk shows]]. Chris then talks about his [[guest star|guest appearance]] on ''[[The West Wing]]''.\n\nIn the end, during his final speech, Peter rips out a [[Flatulence|fart]] as a joke, prompting everyone to laugh. The screen pulls back, revealing it to be on another TV screen with Peter next to it. He explains that over 300 million Americans pass gas each day. He also tells the viewers to \"visit my ass\" for more information. Peter then rips out another fart as a joke, thus ending the movie.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Seth MacFarlane]] as [[Stewie Griffin]], [[Peter Griffin]], [[Brian Griffin]], [[Glenn Quagmire]], [[List of Family Guy characters#Tom Tucker|Tom Tucker]], [[Stewie Griffin|Stuart \"Stu\" Griffin]], [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce Jenner]], [[James Woods]], [[Mort Goldman]], [[List of Family Guy characters#Death|Death]], [[Pee-wee Herman]], [[Matt Lauer]], [[John Candy]], [[List of Family Guy characters#Seamus|Seamus]], [[List of Family Guy characters#Dr Hartman|Dr Hartman]], [[Danny Elfman]], and [[Kool-Aid Man]]\n* [[Alex Borstein]] as [[Lois Griffin]], [[Tricia Takanawa]], [[Vanessa Griffin]], [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Ann Curry]], and [[Diane Sawyer]]\n* [[Seth Green]] as [[Chris Griffin]] and [[Neil Goldman (Family Guy)|Neil Goldman]]\n* [[Mila Kunis]] as [[Meg Griffin]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Sexy Girls]]\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as [[Joe Swanson]]\n* [[Lori Alan]] as [[Diane Simmons (Family Guy)|Diane Simmons]] and [[Kathie Lee Gifford|Drunk Lady]]\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as herself\n* [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] as [[Cleveland Brown]], [[List of Family Guy characters#Herbert|Mr. John Herbert]], [[Bruce the Performance Artist|Bruce]], [[List of Family Guy characters#Gressed Up Deaf Guy|The Greased-Up Deaf Guy]],  and [[Fred Rogers]]\n* [[Rachael MacFarlane]] as [[Katie Couric]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Luanne Platter]], and [[Muriel Goldman]]\n* [[Noel Blanc]] as [[Elmer Fudd]]\n* [[Phil LaMarr]] as [[Ollie Williams]], [[List of Family Guy characters#The Judge|Judge of Quahog]], and [[Al Roker]]\n* [[Adam West]] as [[Mayor West]]\n* [[Ali Hillis]] as Meg Griffin singing \"[[If I Could Turn Back Time]]\"\n* [[Busy Philipps]] as Additional voices\n* [[Jason Priestley]] as [[List of Beverly Hills, 90210 characters#Brandon Walsh|Brandon Walsh]]\n* [[Jennie Garth]] as [[Kelly Taylor (90210)|Kelly Taylor]]\n* [[Tori Spelling]] as [[List of Beverly Hills, 90210 characters#Donna Martin|Donna Martin]]\n* Rory Thost as Brad and [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]]\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as the Stork\n* [[Will Sasso]] as [[Randy Newman]] and [[James Lipton]]\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Young [[Ray Charles]]\n* [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] as [[List of Family Guy characters#Evil Monkey|The Evil Monkey who lives in the Closet]], [[Stewie Griffin|Rupert]], and Al Harrington\n* [[John Viener]] as Ron Griffin, [[Joe Pesci]] and [[Jeff Boomhauer|Boomhauer]]\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] as [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]]\n* [[Joy Behar]] as Herself\n* [[Johnny Brennan]] as Horace\n* [[Bill Fagerbakke]] as Change For A Buck\n* [[Larry Kenney]] as [[Lion-O]]\n* [[Don LaFontaine]] as FOX Announcer\n* [[Lynne Lipton]] as Cheetara\n\n== Reception ==\n\n''[[The A.V.

The council ordered that [[Global Television Network|Global Television]] must apologize to its viewers for not warning them about the violence in a scene where Elmer Fudd kills Bugs Bunny with a rifle during a July 23, 2011 airing of the ''Family Guy'' episode \"Stewie B. Goode\". The Council stated \"The panel finds that the scene was definitely somewhat gruesome and uncomfortable to watch. It recognizes, however, that the scene was intended to satirize the violence found in that type of cartoon program. The gag was somewhat tongue-in-cheek since ''Family Guy'' itself is an animated program that sometimes contains violence.\"<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2012/120301.php | publisher = Canadian Broadcast Standards Council | author = National Conventional Television Panel | date = 2 February 2012 | access-date = 5 November 2012 | title = Global re Family Guy (\"Stewie B.
