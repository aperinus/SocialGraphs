The film serves as a [[sequel]] to the 1999 film ''[[The Boondock Saints]]''. The film stars [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] and [[Norman Reedus]], who return to their roles, as well as several of the other actors from the first film.\n\nThe film takes place eight years after the events of the original ''Boondock Saints'', as [[fraternal twin]] brother [[vigilantes]] Connor (Flanery) and Murphy (Reedus) are living a quiet life in Ireland with their father, the former assassin known as \"Il Duce\". However, they are drawn back into action after someone attempts to frame the twin brothers for the murder of a priest in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Connor and Murphy travel back to the United States, where they meet some old friends and are pursued by Eunice Bloom ([[Julie Benz]]), an FBI agent and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Agent Smecker.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the McManus twins, Connor and Murphy, and their father, Noah (Il Duce), assassinated Joe Yakavetta, they fled to [[Ireland]]. Eight years later, their uncle Father Sibeal arrives to inform them that a renowned Boston priest was murdered by a mysterious assassin who attempted to frame the Saints by using their ritual assassination style. In response, the twins dig up their old gear and weapons and depart for the United States.\n\nEn route to Boston aboard a container ship, the twins meet a Mexican underground fighter named Romeo, who recognizes them as the Saints. Romeo convinces them to let him join them as their new partner. Hearing a radio broadcast regarding Joe's son, Concezio Yakavetta, they deduce that he must have hired the hitman who killed the priest  to draw them out of hiding.\n\nMeanwhile, Detectives Greenly, Dolly, and Duffy are at the scene of the priest's murder. They are greeted by Special Agent Eunice Bloom, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Paul Smecker (who has died) who has been assigned to investigate the murder and determine whether or not the Saints are responsible. She comes to the conclusion that the Saints were not who murdered the cleric, and begins an investigation to find the real assassin. She and the other officers find out the assassin is Ottilio Panza, a man who appears to be working for a mysterious man known only as \"The Old Man\".\n\nConnor, Murphy, and Romeo hit a warehouse that is being used by an Chinese [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] gang to process heroin for Yakavetta. After killing everyone at the warehouse, Connor and Murphy reunite with their old bartender friend, Doc. They learn that the assassin was an independent contractor and that Yakavetta himself is hiding in the [[Prudential Tower]]. Later at the warehouse, now a crime scene, Bloom confirms that the Saints have returned. Bloom interrupts a massage in progress and hits a mob boss with a paddle, displaying her identity.\n\nThe twins and Romeo have one of Yakavetta's caporegimes named Gorgeous George set up a meeting with a group of mobsters at a bar, where they kill them. Panza arrives shortly after and attempts to ambush the twins, but Bloom arrives in time to save them by wounding Panza, who then flees. Bloom introduces herself, revealing her intentions to help the Saints in Smecker's place. The group then cleans up the crime scene to make it look as if the mobsters had turned on each other. Later, Bloom reunites the other detectives with the Saints, thus bringing them in on their plans.\n\nYakavetta calls a meeting with his crew, during which the Saints arrive and kill everyone, including Yakavetta. Bloom interrogates Yakavetta's ''[[consigliere]]'' Jimmy and learns of the Old Man's involvement with Panza. The crime scene is visited by FBI Special Agent Kuntsler, who takes over the gang murder case after suspending Bloom. Later at the bar, Greenly arrives to celebrate the boys' victory, but is shot and killed by Panza. Noah, earlier having decided to help his sons, unexpectedly arrives to demand Panza tell him the Old Man's location. They engage in a type of \"Russian roulette\" stand-off, and after Panza still refuses to answer, Noah angrily shoots him dead.\n\nNoah reveals to the group that in 1958 New York, he watched a trio of mobsters brutally murder his father. Consumed with rage and anger and wanting revenge, Noah hunted down and killed the mobsters with the help of his best friend Louie, who is revealed to be the Old Man. Noah still felt unsatisfied, so Louie helped him pick out mobsters to kill. They continued this until 1975, when Louie gave Noah up to the police.\n\nBloom illegally obtains a file regarding Louie's location and gives it to Noah. Louie, anticipating the Saints' arrival at his mansion, has several hit men stationed on the grounds. When the McManus family arrives, Louie reveals that he had only used Noah to eliminate the competition in the Mafia, afterwards giving him up to the police when he was no longer useful. After this, however, the Mafia cast Louie himself out for the same reason. He then helped rebuild the Yakavetta family after Joe's demise and let the Saints take out the rest of the organization so Louie could take control. Louie signals the hit men waiting to take out the Saints to make their move, but the Saints kill them all. Noah suffers a fatal gunshot wound, but kills Louie before he dies. The police arrive and arrest the wounded Connor, Murphy, and Romeo.\n\nBloom meets with Father Sibeal, who has arranged to take her to a safe place out of the country to flee FBI prosecution. She is shocked to discover that Sibeal has been working with Smecker, who faked his own death and developed a network of support for the Saints and their work. Smecker tells Bloom his plans to break the Saints out of prison.\n\nAs protesters outside of the prison shout for the freedom of the Saints, Connor and Murphy stare out of their window at the sea of prisoners in the yard, finding that they will have plenty of work while they wait to be freed.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Troy Duffy, Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus, Boondock Saints 2.jpg|thumb|right|Norman Reedus (left), Troy Duffy (center), and Sean Patrick Flanery (right) promoting Boondock Saints 2 at Drexel University in Philadelphia]]\n* [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] as Connor MacManus, one-half of the MacManus twins.
