It deals with two American friends imprisoned in [[Thailand]] for alleged drug smuggling. Its title is taken from a [[Grateful Dead]] song written by [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]] from their 1970 album ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nLifelong best friends Alice Marano and Darlene Davis take a trip after graduating from high school, giving their parents the impression that they are going to Hawaii. However, Alice talks Darlene into going to Thailand instead, after comparing the prices of both destinations. Darlene agrees, albeit with some reluctance. Once in Thailand, they meet a captivating [[Australia]]n man who calls himself Nick Parks. Unknown to them, Nick is a drug smuggler. Darlene is particularly smitten with Nick and persuades Alice to take him up on his offer to treat them both to a side trip to [[Hong Kong]]. While boarding their flight at [[Don Mueang International Airport]], the girls are detained by the police. Alice and Darlene are shocked to discover that one of their bags contains [[heroin]], which they insist must have been planted by Nick.\n\nThe two girls are interrogated by the Thai police and Darlene signs a confession written in Thai, believing it to be a transcript of her statement. At their trial, they beg for mercy and are sentenced to 33 years in prison, the judge choosing to show leniency and not issue the standard life sentence. In prison, the girls are advised to seek out Henry Greene, aka \"Yankee Hank\", an expatriate American attorney living in Thailand.\n\nAs the girls try to deal with the violence and squalor of prison, Hank begins work on their case. He tracks down another girl who had been used as an unwitting drug mule by a man named Skip K. Carn. Hank deduces that Carn and Parks are the same person, since each name is an [[anagram]] of the other, and that he planted the drugs and tipped off the Thai police about the girls as a distraction to make sure his other mules could avoid scrutiny. Warned that Parks has influential friends in the Thai government, Hank arranges a deal with a corrupt prosecutor to secure a pardon for the girls if they recant their claim about Parks' involvement and take full responsibility for smuggling the drugs. The girls agree, but the prosecutor double-crosses them on the deal. Realizing that Darlene will not survive their time in prison, Alice begs the [[Monarchy of Thailand|King of Thailand]] to allow her to serve both sentences, which have been extended by 15 years after an escape attempt, in exchange for letting Darlene go. The deal is accepted and Darlene is released. She promises to continue working with Hank to try to free Alice. The film ends with the narration from Alice saying many people will not understand why she made this decision. It's also implied Alice may be in prison for a long time.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Claire Danes]] as Alice Marano\n*[[Kate Beckinsale]] as Darlene Davis\n*[[Bill Pullman]] as Hank Greene\n*[[Lou Diamond Phillips]] as Roy Knox\n*[[Jacqueline Kim]] as Yon Greene\n*[[Daniel Lapaine]] as Nick Parks\n*[[Tom Amandes]] as Doug Davis\n*Aimee Graham as Beth Ann Gardener\n*[[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] as Bill Marano\n*[[Lori Lethin]] as Lori Davis\n*[[Lim Kay Tong]] as Chief Detective Jagkrit\n*[[Amanda de Cadenet]] as English prisoner \n*[[Paul Walker]] as Jason\n*[[Victor Neri]] as bellhop\n*[[Ronnie Lazaro]] as security\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nProducer [[Adam Fields]] was inspired to make the film based on interviews he conducted with young American woman serving life sentences in a [[Thailand]] prison for drug-related offenses, as well as with U.S. Embassy and Drug Enforcement Agency officials in [[Bangkok]]. Fields said the idea traces back to \u201c'the self-assurance and naive arrogance I certainly had as an American teenager when I wanted to go to London or Amsterdam or Morocco and I said to my parents, \u2018I\u2019m 16, I\u2019m grown up, I ride the New York subways--what could happen?\u2019\u201d<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news |last=Chase |first=Donald |date=1998-05-24 |title=Shoulda Taken the Summer Job |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-may-24-ca-52977-story.html |url-status=live |access-date=2022-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211022233306/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-may-24-ca-52977-story.html |archive-date=2021-10-22}}</ref> Fields developed the story with screenwriter [[David Arata]], who expanded it into a screenplay.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nArata and director [[Jonathan Kaplan]] said a key emotional theme of the film is the friendship between the characters of Alice and Darlene. Said Kaplan, \u201cYou have this relationship between two young women that I\u2019ve never seen on the screen before. And I just thought the script...treated them with so much respect. And I also think that when one girl [Danes\u2019 Alice] is incredibly needy and doesn\u2019t want to let go, and the other one [Beckinsale\u2019s Darlene] is ready to go out into the world, it\u2019s a major rite of passage that\u2019s almost a death--and a very compelling story.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Claire Danes]] said she was drawn to the project because of its depiction of female friendship; she deferred her enrollment at [[Yale University|Yale]] for a year to do the film.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Bill Pullman]] signed on for the opportunity to shoot in the [[Philippines]]. \u201cLast fall, when I was in [[Guadalcanal]] doing [[Terrence Malick|Terry Malick]]\u2019s \u2018''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]''\u2019...I was seeing all these expatriates we were using as extras.
