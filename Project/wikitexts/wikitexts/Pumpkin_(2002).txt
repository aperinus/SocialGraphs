It is a story of forbidden love between a developmentally-disabled young man and a sorority girl. The film was directed by Anthony Abrams and Adam Larson Broder and written by Broder.\n\n==Plot==\nCarolyn McDuffy is a college senior beginning her last year of studies at a [[Southern California]] university. To help her [[Fraternities and sororities|sorority]] win a coveted award that has eluded them in the past years, she joins them in training some handicapped young adults for the Challenged Games (a fictional version of the [[Special Olympics]]).\n\nCarolyn is paired with Jesse \"Pumpkin\" Romanoff, and is horrified as she has never been around challenged people. He is kind towards her and soon she finds herself developing affection towards him as he is genuine, unlike her boyfriend Kent Woodlands, and her sorority sisters, as led by Julie Thurber.\n\nCarolyn experiences backlash and disdain about the relationship from her friends and family, including Pumpkin's own mother, Judy, despite the fact that her love has inspired him to get out of his wheelchair and become the best athlete on the team. Judy later walks into her son's room, discovering that Carolyn and Pumpkin have been sexually involved.\n\nPumpkin's mother accuses Carolyn of [[Sexual assault|raping]] her son, saying she \"has no idea what she has done\" to him. Then she calls Carolyn's college, causing her to be kicked out of both her sorority and expelled from the university. Carolyn makes a suicide attempt by taking most of the pills and solutions from her medicine cabinet, but vomits them up.\n\nHearing of Carolyn's suicide attempt, the sorority convinces the university to allow her back in, and she is encouraged to attend the sorority ball with Kent; Julie feels their attendance will help the sorority secure their award. At the ball, Pumpkin and his friends crash the party to allow Pumpkin a dance with Carolyn. Kent confronts Pumpkin, punching him repeatedly, who responds by tackling Kent to the ground, temporarily knocking him unconscious.\n\nHumiliated, Kent leaves the dance. When Carolyn tries to take Pumpkin inside to the dance, Julie and her sorority sisters block the door. She pushes her way through with Pumpkin and they dance alone. Soon, other attendees are impelled to join them on the dance floor.\n\nKent leaves the dance in his car, sobbing and driving erratically. He swerves to avoid a truck and plunges off a cliff with the car exploding in mid-air, crashing to the bottom. Carolyn goes to the hospital to check on Kent and finds that he is now [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]], though not burned from the explosion.\n\nKent blames Carolyn for his problems and she is left distraught. She drops out of college, swearing off Pumpkin forever. The sorority stops helping the team and their rival sorority wins the award. Carolyn enrolls at a public university, opening up to her encouraging peers.\n\nThe sorority sisters have a change of heart and show up at the Olympic event. Kent is now the coach for Pumpkin's team, becoming both a motivator and humble. Pumpkin races his rival, a bully who berates him at every chance. Pumpkin is motivated by Kent, telling him to win it for Carolyn, saying she wouldn't want him to lose. As he is running, seeing her in the stands gives him a sudden burst of energy.\n\nPumpkin wins the race, and at the finish line is congratulated by the sorority sisters, his mother, and Kent. Carolyn comes down to see him as his mother is hugging him. She endears him to Carolyn, finally accepting her son's progress into a man.\n\nAs Carolyn and Pumpkin walk off together, she asks him what name she should call him, and he replies that \"Pumpkin will be fine.\" She then asks what he meant when he asked her early on in the film about the moon, wondering if the question was literal or metaphorical, to which he replies, \"What?\" Carolyn glances back with an ambiguous expression before continuing ahead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Carolyn McDuffy\n* [[Hank Harris]] as Jesse \"Pumpkin\" Romanoff\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Judy Romanoff\n* [[Dominique Swain]] as Jeanine Kryszinsky\n* [[Marisa Coughlan]] as Julie Thurber\n* Sam Ball as Kent Woodlands\n* [[Harry J.
