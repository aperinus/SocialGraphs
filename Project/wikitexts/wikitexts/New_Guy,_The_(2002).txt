He begins dating popular girl Danielle (Dushku) and unites a once-divided school, also greatly improving its football team. Eventually, Gil has to face his demons from his old school when they face each other in a football game. The film received generally negative reviews, but was a modest box office success.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Prison]] inmate Luther speaks [[Fourth wall|directly to the camera]] in the opening, telling the story of Dizzy Gillespie Harrison, an 18-year-old nerdy high school senior in [[Austin, Texas]]. Dizzy is friends with Nora, Kirk, and Glen,<ref name=\"screenit\"/> who together started a [[funk rock]] band called \"Suburban Funk\" and are addicted to video games. \n\nAttending Rocky Creek High School, Dizzy is picked on by everyone, especially star football player Barclay. After Tina Osgood touches his arm, causing him to have an [[erection]] and embarrassing him as the jocks belittle him,<ref name=\"screenit\"/><ref name=\"mahalo\">{{cite web| url = http://www.mahalo.com/the-new-guy/| title = The erection scene of ''The New Guy''| publisher = Mahalo| access-date = 2012-04-02| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102321/http://www.mahalo.com/the-new-guy/| archive-date = 2015-04-02}}</ref> his briefs are yanked from under his pants and placed around his head.<ref name=\"screenit\">{{cite web | url = http://www.screenit.com/movies/2002/the_new_guy.html| title = Advanced summary| publisher = Screen It!| access-date = 2009-07-22}}</ref> The school librarian [[Penile fracture|\"breaks\"]] his penis after Dizzy refuses to \"hand\" over the \"weapon\" to her.<ref name=\"thenewguy\"/><ref name=\"mahalo\"/> \n\nDizzy is misdiagnosed with [[Tourette's syndrome]] and placed on medication by the school counselor, who advises his father to spend every possible moment with him. While at the mall's food court, the heavily medicated Dizzy makes a fool of himself at a church revival and gets arrested.<ref name=\"thenewguy\"/>\n\nIn jail, Dizzy meets Luther, who turns out to be a sympathetic ex-victim who makes it his goal to teach him how to be cool.<ref name=\"screenit\"/> To wipe the slate clean, Dizzy gets himself expelled from his old high school, then undergoes a makeover with the help of the prison inmates and guards.<ref name=\"thenewguy\"/> Changing his name to \"Gil Harris\", he enrolls at East Highland High and makes an impression by being dropped off in a prison van in restraints and beating up the school bully, Conner.<ref name=\"thenewguy\"/>\n\nThe action has the intended effect, and head cheerleader Danielle welcomes the newcomer to school.<ref name=\"screenit\"/> Her friend Courtney invites Dizzy to a party and through a mishap, he gives her the impression that he has blown her off. Using a photo given to him by the prison inmates and help from his old friends, Dizzy manages to escape the party with his reputation intact. Upon returning home, however, he finds his father has sold their house and quit work to supervise him, which results in them living in a trailer.\n\nDanielle asks Dizzy to encourage the school to go to see the football team play; he, referencing [[Patton (film)|General Patton]] and [[Braveheart]], gives an impassioned speech, inspiring the team to win their first game in years. He is soon enlisted by the coach and principal to plan the school's homecoming dance, and becomes imbued with school spirit, shedding his bad boy image. Danielle breaks up with Conner and starts a relationship with Dizzy.\n\nHowever, Dizzy and Gil are fast becoming too big for one body. When Nora berates Dizzy for becoming the same person he once hated, he uses his newfound popularity to confront Conner. Dizzy and Danielle spur the students to reunite, and the lines dividing the different cliques are broken. \n\nWith a new philosophy, the school football team wins more games and bullying becomes a thing of the past.<ref name=\"thenewguy\"/> Reaching the state championship, where they play Rocky Creek, Dizzy's antics on the sideline cost Rocky Creek the game. \n\nAfter Rocky Creek's loss to East Highland, Barclay slowly starts realizing who Gil is, as East Highland High celebrates their victory. At school the next day, while East Highland still celebrates, Barclay confronts and attempts to fight Dizzy, but before he can do anything, he is attacked by the entire student body. After the attack, Conner helps Barclay up from the ground, telling him he wants to know what he knows about Dizzy.\n\nThe homecoming dance, which Dizzy's funk band is supposed to play, is crashed by the students of Rocky Creek. Barclay and Conner, who have joined forces to set a trap for Dizzy, play an embarrassing video of the librarian incident. However, Luther and the other inmates arrive to save Dizzy, tying up the two bullies. Nora admits longstanding feelings for Glen, and Danielle reveals to Dizzy that she was also a nerd growing up. She forgives him for hiding who he was, and they kiss.\n\nLuther ends the film, and the man he is talking to is revealed to be [[David Hasselhoff]]. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Dizzy and Danielle mount a horse and ride off into the sunset together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[DJ Qualls]] as Dizzy Gillespie Harrison/Gil Harris\n* [[Eliza Dushku]] as Danielle\n* [[Eddie Griffin]] as Luther\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Nora\n* [[Lyle Lovett]] as Bear Harrison\n* [[Jerod Mixon]] as Kirk\n* [[Parry Shen]] as Glen\n* Rachael E.
