It stars [[Matt Damon]] as [[Tom Ripley]], with [[Jude Law]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] in supporting roles. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $128 million worldwide. It received five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Law.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1958, Tom Ripley is approached by shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf, who believes that Ripley attended [[Princeton University|Princeton]] with his son, Dickie, because Ripley wears a borrowed Princeton jacket. Greenleaf pays Ripley to travel to Italy, where Dickie has settled, to persuade him to return to the United States. After a first-class ocean liner voyage, Ripley pretends to be Dickie in the Italian ship terminal and befriends an American socialite, Meredith Logue.\n\nIn the seaside village of Mongibello, Ripley befriends Dickie and his girlfriend Marge Sherwood, claiming to be Dickie's former Princeton classmate. Ripley enjoys Dickie's extravagant lifestyle and becomes obsessed with him. Eventually, Dickie tires of him and starts spending time with his socialite friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with contempt. When he returns from Rome, Dickie catches Ripley dressed in his clothes and dancing in front of a mirror, which disturbs him.\n\nWhen Dickie impregnates a local woman and spurns her, she drowns herself. Ripley, aware of what has happened, promises a guilt-ridden Dickie to keep it a secret. After Dickie's father cuts off Ripley's travel funds, Dickie cancels a trip to Venice and tells Ripley that they should part ways, but offers to take him on a final trip to [[Sanremo|San Remo]]. They argue aboard a small boat; Dickie says that he has grown tired of Ripley and is going to marry Marge, while Ripley insists that Dickie is afraid of the feelings they have for each other. The argument becomes physical, and Ripley kills Dickie with an oar. He takes Dickie's belongings and scuttles the boat.\n\nRealizing that people mistake him for Dickie, Ripley assumes his identity. He forges a letter to Marge, convincing her that Dickie has left her and moved to Rome. He creates the illusion that Dickie is still alive by checking into one hotel as Dickie and another as himself, fabricating an exchange of communications between the two. Through forgery, he is able to draw on Dickie's allowance, which allows him to live lavishly. He runs into Meredith, who still knows him as Dickie, in Rome, and accepts an invitation from her to attend an opera with her family. Ripley's ruse is threatened when he unexpectedly runs into Marge and her friend Peter Smith-Kingsley at the opera. Ripley rushes Meredith out of the opera house on a pretext, then rejects her to prevent himself from being exposed.\n\nFreddie shows up at Ripley's apartment looking for Dickie. When the landlady addresses Ripley as Dickie, Freddie realizes the fraud. Ripley bludgeons Freddie to death and disposes of his body. After the body is found, police visit the apartment to question \"Dickie\". To evade the police and Marge, both of whom are looking for Dickie, Ripley forges a suicide note with \"Dickie\" claiming responsibility for Freddie's death. Under his real name, Ripley travels to Venice, where he again encounters Peter. \n\nDickie's father arrives in Italy with a private detective, Alvin MacCarron, and meets with the police. Ripley tries to kill Marge after she discovers that he has Dickie's rings, but they are interrupted by Peter. Mr. Greenleaf dismisses Marge's suspicions and MacCarron tells Ripley that the police are convinced that Dickie, who had a history of violence, murdered Freddie before killing himself. MacCarron tells Ripley that Greenleaf intends to bequeath a portion of Dickie's trust fund to him to reward his loyalty to Dickie and to ensure his silence.\n\nFree and clear of his crimes, Ripley boards a ship to Greece with Peter; it is implied they are now lovers. Ripley is surprised to encounter Meredith, who still believes he is Dickie and also knows Peter socially. Ripley kisses her and promises to talk later. In his cabin, Peter tells Ripley he saw him kiss Meredith, and demands answers. Ripley realizes that he will have to kill Peter, as it is only a matter of time before Peter and Meredith run into each other and Meredith, who is traveling with family, would be missed. After apologizing to Peter for lying to him, a sobbing Ripley strangles him to death and returns to his cabin, alone.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Tom Ripley]]\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Marge Sherwood\n* [[Jude Law]] as Dickie Greenleaf\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Meredith Logue\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Freddie Miles\n* [[Jack Davenport]] as Peter Smith-Kingsley\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Herbert Greenleaf\n* [[Lisa Eichhorn]] as Emily Greenleaf\n* [[Sergio Rubini]] as Inspector Roverini\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Alvin MacCarron\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Aunt Joan\n* [[Rosario Fiorello]] as Fausto\n* [[Stefania Rocca]] as Silvana\n* [[Ivano Marescotti]] as Colonnello Verrecchia\n* [[Silvana Bosi]] as Ermelinda\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Casting ===\n''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] declined the role which went to Damon.<ref>{{cite news |first=Akin |last=Ojumu |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jan/30/comment.akinojumu1 |title=Bad will hunting |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=January 30, 2000 |access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref> Minghella cast Matt Damon after seeing his performance in ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', because he felt the actor had the right mix of \"credibility and warmth and generosity\" to engage the audience and help them understand how Ripley \"thinks and operates\".<ref name=Bricker/> The character of Meredith Logue, not present in the novel, was added by Minghella with Cate Blanchett in mind. He was \"entranced\" with Blanchett after meeting with her and surprised that she was actually interested in playing the small part; Minghella went on to write more scenes for the character to expand her role.<ref name=Bricker/>\n\nMinghella happened to see the [[dailies]] from a film his wife Caroline Choa was producing at the time, which Law starred in: ''[[The Wisdom of Crocodiles]]''. Minghella was impressed with Law's performance and offered him the role of Dickie; in his \"insane arrogance\", as Law put it, he initially refused, because he did not wish to play a \"pretty boy\".
