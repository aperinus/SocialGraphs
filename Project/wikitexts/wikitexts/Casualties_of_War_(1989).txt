Individual Conscience | date=1989-08-18}}</ref> The film stars [[Michael J. Fox]] and [[Sean Penn]], and is based on the events of the 1966 [[incident on Hill 192]] during the [[Vietnam War]], in which a Vietnamese woman was kidnapped from her village by a squad of American soldiers, who raped and murdered her. For the film, all names and some details of the true story were altered.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is presented as a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of Max Eriksson, a [[Vietnam veteran]].\n\nLieutenant Reilly leads his platoon of American soldiers on a nighttime patrol. They are attacked by the [[Viet Cong]] (VC) after a panicked soldier exposes their position. While guarding the platoon's flank, Eriksson falls as the top of a VC tunnel gives way beneath him. Eriksson's squad leader, Sergeant Tony Meserve, pulls Eriksson out of the hole and eventually, the platoon retreats out of the jungle.\n\nThe platoon takes a break outside a river village in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]]. While relaxing and joking around, one of Meserve's friends, [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist 4]] \"Brownie\" Brown, is killed when the Viet Cong ambushes them. Brownie's death has a major impact on Meserve. The platoon is sent back to their base. Private First Class Antonio D\u00ecaz arrives as the replacement radio operator.\n\nFrustrated because his squad has been denied [[Leave (U.S. military)|leave]] for an extended period, Meserve orders the squad to kidnap a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] girl. Eriksson strenuously objects, but Meserve, Corporal Thomas E. Clark and Private First Class Herbert Hatcher ignore him. Before the quintet disembarks, Eriksson voices his concerns to his closest friend, Rowan. At nightfall, the squad enters a village and kidnaps a Vietnamese girl, Tran Thi Oanh.\n\nAs the squad treks through the mountains, D\u00ecaz begins to reconsider raping Tran and begs Eriksson to back him up. The squad and Tran eventually take refuge in an abandoned hooch, where Eriksson is confronted and threatened by Meserve, Clark, and Hatcher. D\u00ecaz suddenly gives in to the pressure, leaving Eriksson alone in opposing the act. Meserve forces Eriksson to stand guard outside while the other men sequentially rape Tran.\n\nAt daybreak, Eriksson is ordered to guard Tran while the rest of the squad takes up a position near a railroad bridge overlooking a Viet Cong river supply [[Main Operating Base|depot]]. Through his acts of kindness, Eriksson manages to earn Tran's trust and prepares to go [[AWOL]] and return Tran to her family. However, Meserve sends Clark to get Eriksson and Tran to go to the bridge before Eriksson can carry out his plan.\n\nMeserve has D\u00ecaz order [[close air support]] for an assault on the depot and then orders D\u00ecaz to kill Tran with a knife. Before D\u00ecaz can kill her, Eriksson fires his rifle into the air, exposing them to the nearby Viet Cong. Amidst the firefight, Tran tries to escape. Eriksson tries to save her but Meserve stops him and knocks him down with the butt of his gun. Eriksson watches helplessly as the entire squad shoots Tran numerous times until she falls off the bridge to her death.\n\nAfter the battle, Eriksson wakes up in a field hospital at the base. He eventually bumps into Rowan and tells him everything that happened. Rowan suggests that Eriksson see Reilly and company commander Captain Hill. Reilly and Hill both prefer to bury the matter but Hill, infuriated at Eriksson's determination to press the issue, resolves to get rid of Eriksson and orders him transferred to a [[tunnel rat]] unit. The other men in Meserve's squad will all be reassigned as well.\n\nAfter narrowly escaping an attempt to [[fragging|kill him in the latrine with a grenade]] (made by Clark), Eriksson storms into a tent and smacks Clark in the face with a shovel, reminding Meserve that killing him is unnecessary because no one cares about what they did. Meserve shakily derides Eriksson, saying he's crazy, and Eriksson leaves.\n\nEriksson then meets an Army chaplain at a bar and describes what happened during the patrol. The chaplain in turn reports it, launching an investigation. The four men who participated in the rape and murder are [[court martial]]ed: Meserve receives 10 years [[hard labor]] and a [[dishonorable discharge]], Clark receives [[life in prison]], and Hatcher and Diaz receive 15 and 8 years of hard labor, respectively.\n\nAt the end of the film, Eriksson wakens from a nightmare to find himself on a [[J-Church]] transit line in [[San Francisco]], just a few seats from a [[Vietnamese-American]] student who resembles Tran. She disembarks at [[Dolores Park]] and forgets her scarf, prompting Eriksson to run after her to return it. As she thanks him and turns away, he calls after her in Vietnamese. She surmises that she reminds him of someone, and that he has had a bad dream. They go their separate ways, and Eriksson is somewhat comforted.\n\n==Cast==\nThe film continued the pseudonyms Lang used in his article, even though the soldiers' real names had since become public. Only the victim ''Tran Thi Oahn'' was referred to by her real name.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brownmiller|first=Susan|title=Against our will: men, women and rape|title-link=Against Our Will|date=1977|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-004244-3|location=Harmondsworth|language=English|oclc=16364614}}</ref>\n\n* [[Michael J.

In the meantime, [[Michael Verhoeven]] made his film based on the incident, titled ''[[o.k. (film)|o.k.]]''. Verhoeven's film was entered to the [[Berlin Film Festival]] in 1970, causing so much controversy among the judges, that the festival was shut down for that year with no awards given. De Palma was at that festival with his film ''[[Dionysus in '69]]''.\n\nIn the late 1970s Susskind announced he would make the film for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref>{{cite news |title=David Susskind: Growing Up in TV |first=Mitch |last=Broder |work=New York Times |date=19 Feb 1978 |page=D31 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/19/archives/david-susskind-growing-up-in-tv.html }}</ref> This did not happen.\n\nIn 1979 [[David Rabe]] mentioned the project to Brian De Palma, who was interested but was unable to raise the money to finance it. Some years later Rabe had written a script, and De Palma attached Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn as actors. They almost succeeded in getting the film financed at [[Paramount Pictures]], but ultimately decided not to proceed when the budget went from $17 million to $20 million. De Palma then went on to make ''The Untouchables'' which was a big hit; [[Dawn Steel]] had liked the project at Paramount, and when she became head of production at [[Columbia Pictures]], ''Casualties of War'' was the first film she green-lit.<ref name=\"dawn\" /><ref>{{cite news |title=At the Movies: A Linson-De Palma Vietnam film The man who makes Merchant-Ivory music The woman who made Day-Lewis sound like a Czechoslovak |first=Lawrence |last=Van Gelder |author-link=Lawrence Van Gelder |work=New York Times |date=26 Feb 1988 |page=C8 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/26/movies/at-the-movies.html }}</ref><ref name=\"steel\">{{cite news |title=It's Back to Vietnam for Hollywood: Columbia's Dawn Steel has a lot riding on a brutal Brian DePalma war movie.

He had previously starred in ''[[Light of Day]]'' and ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]''. [[John C. Reilly]] makes his screen debut in the film; he would work with Penn again in ''[[We're No Angels (1989 film)|We're No Angels]]'' and ''[[State of Grace (1990 film)|State of Grace]]''. [[John Leguizamo]], who appeared in his first major film role, would again star with Penn in another picture by De Palma, 1993's ''[[Carlito's Way]]''.\n\n\"Let's be honest,\" said Fox at the time. \"If this movie makes a buck and a half it's going to be things like ''Bikini's Away'' for me. But to fail doing something unexpected is no disgrace. To fail doing the ordinary is a disaster. This movie is about how much you will risk if you have nothing to gain.\"<ref name=\"fox\"/>\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=January 2014}}\n''Casualties of War'' opened in 1,487 theatres, and ranked number 4 in box office for the first week of its release. It went on to gross $18.7 million.\n\nThe theatrical cut of the film was released on DVD in 2001. This version has the original 113 minute running time.\nAn extended cut of the film was released on DVD in 2006, that contains two scenes cut from the original release. One has Eriksson being interrogated by the two investigators, and the other is the defense attorney (played by uncredited [[Gregg Henry]]) trying to discredit Eriksson during the trial. This extended version has a running time of 119 minutes.\n\n==Reception== \nThe film holds an 83% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 47 reviews.

She highlights how the few changes made to the real story serve to support a narrative of the military as a flawed, but ultimately just and heroic institution. Among the details she highlights is its failure to mention that the sentences imposed at trial were later severely cut down, with the last of the perpetrators being freed after only four years. While Eriksson/Storeby is the hero whose bravery is suggested to represent U.S. national and military identity, even the rapists and murderers on his squad are granted an imaginary backstory of a recently fallen squadmate to \"explain\" their acts.<ref name=\"wieskamp\"/> \n{{blockquote|To re-imagine a good society whose military interventions in third world countries are motivated by a desire to help people, ideological strategies develop to dispel historical disruptions.
