The character of Larry Cook corresponds to the title character of that play, while the characters of Ginny, Rose and Caroline represent Lear's daughters Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. The dramatic catalyst in both works is the division of the father's estate among his three offspring, causing bitter rivalry and ultimately leading to tragedy.\n\n== Plot ==\nLarry Cook, a prosperous farmer in Iowa, decides to retire and split his acres of land among his three daughters, Ginny, Rose and Caroline. Ginny and Rose happily accept the lucrative agreement to live and work on the farm but Caroline abandons farming for a law career in [[Des Moines]] and refuses to take part in the deal.\n\nLarry is consumed with rage and rejects Caroline, leaving Rose and Ginny to go about running the farm with their husbands. However, as Larry loses touch with farming life, he begins to lose touch with reality, and his painful descent into [[senility]] leaves him bitterly opposed to his daughters' ways of running the farm.\n\nAs she struggles to maintain the farm, Ginny encounters a rift in her relationship with Rose, who reveals that Larry had [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] her when she was a child, and insists that he had done the same thing to Ginny. The two women also develop a strong extra-marital attachment to Jess, the handsome son of a neighboring farmer who is loyal to Larry.\n\nParanoid and disillusioned, Larry decides to sue Rose and Ginny in an effort to regain his patriarchal control, and seeks Caroline's help. The lawsuit divides the family forever, leaving Rose and Ginny to suffer alone while realizing painful truths about their childhood. As Rose and Ginny discover their own individual strengths in the face of adversity, they learn how to survive on their own, without the protection of the farm and the suffocating presence of their father.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Rose Cook Lewis\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Ginny Cook Smith\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Larry Cook\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Caroline Cook\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Jess Clark\n* [[Keith Carradine]] as Ty Smith\n* [[Kevin Anderson (actor)|Kevin Anderson]] as Peter Lewis\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Harold Clark\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Ken LaSalle\n* [[Anne Pitoniak]] as Mary Livingstone\n* [[Vyto Ruginis]] as Charles Carter\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Pammy\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Linda\n* Ray Toler as Marv Carson\n* [[Kenneth Tigar]] as Doctor\n* Steve Key as Loren Clark\n* Dan Conway as Henry Dodge\n* Stan Cahill as Frank\n* [[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] as Wallace Crockett\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Roberta\n* Andrea Nittoli as Waitress\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''A Thousand Acres'' holds a rating of 24% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 51 reviews.

The screenplay is based on a novel by [[Jane Smiley]], unread by me, which won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] - which means that either the novel or the prize has been done a great injustice.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970919/REVIEWS/709190307/1023 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=A Thousand Acres|newspaper=[[The Chicago Sun-Times]] |via=[[RogerEbert.com]]|date=September 19, 1997 |access-date=February 27, 2022 |archive-date=October 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004102141/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19970919%2FREVIEWS%2F709190307%2F1023 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Desson Howe]] wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'': \"That Jane Smiley's ''A Thousand Acres'' would become a movie was inevitable. Another virtual certainty was its [[bowdlerization]]... Without Smiley\u2019s connecting prose (although we're subjected to long bouts of narration), there\u2019s nothing left but the melodrama... If there are any positives to point to, it would be Lange's performance. Her emotional battle to avoid harsh realities is sure to put her up for those big-time awards. It's too bad she's emoting away in an empty drama that - with all its narrative ellipses - should have been called ''A Hundred Acres''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/review97/thousandacreshowe.htm |first=Desson |last=Howe |authorlink=Desson Howe|title='Thousand Acres': Fallow Melodrama |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 19, 1997}}</ref>\n\nGodfrey Cheshire in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Considering that Moorhouse made one of the best Australian directorial debuts of the last decade with ''[[Proof (1991 film)|Proof]]'', a small film of great precision and insight, it's a shame that with this film and ''[[How to Make an American Quilt]]'' she seems to have consigned herself to a world of big-budget, broad-stroke Americana, where her skills are still evident but noticeably diluted. It's likewise regrettable that she's able to make so little use here of Leigh and Robards, who are as good as they can be in thankless roles. Lange and Pfeiffer are well-matched and generally fare better, even though they too are circumscribed by the lackluster writing. The film's standout perf, meanwhile, comes from [[Keith Carradine]], who takes the relatively small role of Ginny's husband and manages to give it a degree of shading and dignity-unto-desperation.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117906414 |first=Godfrey |last=Cheshire |title=A Thousand Acres Review |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 9, 1997}}</ref>\n\n[[Mick LaSalle]] in ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote: \"Imagine it.

Too bad, then, that ''A Thousand Acres'', the film version of Jane Smiley's novel of the same name, should turn out to be a soap opera. Don't blame the actors. Their efforts succeed in keeping the bad news from the audience for almost half the picture. Pfeiffer has never been more fierce and committed, and just seeing Leigh and Lange in the same frame is gratifying...
