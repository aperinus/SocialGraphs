It follows a 13-year-old girl in 1987 who dreams of being popular. During her birthday party, she is humiliated by her classmates and wishes that she was 30 years old. Shortly after wishing this, she awakens, 30 years old and in 2004, uncertain how she got there.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Garner's performance and its nostalgic environment. It was also praised for its humorous plot and self-empowering message. The film was also a commercial success, earning $22 million in its first week and grossing over $96 million, becoming one of the year's biggest-selling [[DVD]] rental titles. Additionally, the soundtrack charted inside the top 50 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Garner's acting earned her nominations from both the [[MTV Movie & TV Awards|MTV Movie Awards]] and the [[Teen Choice Awards]].\n\n==Plot== \nIn 1987, geeky Jenna Rink yearns to be popular, but can only persuade the \"Six Chicks\" \u2013 the ruling [[clique]] led by \"Tom-Tom\" \u2013 to attend her 13th-birthday party by doing their homework. Jenna's best friend and next-door neighbor, Matt \"Matty\" Flamhaff, who is secretly in love with her, gives her a pink [[dollhouse]] he made himself, and a packet of \"magic wishing dust\" he sprinkles on the dollhouse roof.\n\nThe Six Chicks arrive with the cutest boys in class, and trick Jenna into playing \"[[seven minutes in heaven]]\". While Jenna waits blindfolded in a closet, expecting to kiss one of the boys, the Six Chicks and the boys leave with their completed homework, and Matty finds Jenna alone. Humiliated, she tearfully wishes to be \"30, flirty, and thriving\", as the wishing dust falls on her. The next morning, Jenna awakens in a luxurious [[Fifth Avenue]] apartment \u2013 her wish has come true \u2013 it is now 2004, and Jenna is 30, with no memory of the intervening 17 years. In the apartment there is a naked guy who Jenna has no memory of.\n\nJenna discovers she works as an editor for her favorite fashion magazine ''Poise'', with her co-editor and best friend, Lucy Wyman. ''Poise'' has been [[scoop (news)|scooped]] so often by rival magazine ''Sparkle'' that editor-in-chief Richard believes someone is tipping them off. Jenna finds Matty's address and races to [[Greenwich Village]] where the adult Matt, a struggling photographer, is unable to fill her in on her past, as she apparently had become the head of the \"Six Chicks\" and stopped speaking to him. Lucy is revealed to be the adult Tom-Tom, having had [[plastic surgery]].\n\nWhile delighting in her freedom, Jenna stumbles through adult life, learning enough to advise the 13-year-olds she prefers to spend time with. She saves a dull and awkward ''Poise'' party by leading the guests, including Matt, in an impromptu \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\" [[line dance]]. The following night, he introduces Jenna to his fianc\u00e9e, Wendy. Her slowly emerging past reveals that the adult Jenna is nothing like the sweet, shy girl she was before \u2013 the adult Jenna plagiarizes ideas, refuses to speak to her parents, and had office sex with a co-worker's husband. The struggling magazine is forced to redesign, and Jenna overhears Lucy planning to cut her out of her redesign presentation.\n\nJenna returns to her childhood home in [[New Jersey]], weeping in the same closet and reuniting with her parents. She apologizes to Matt, and hires him for her yearbook-inspired redesign photoshoot. Even though Wendy is eager for Matt to move to [[Chicago]], he and Jenna begin to fall for each other.\n\nJenna's plans to save ''Poise'' are a rousing success, while Lucy's presentation fails. Lucy lies to Matt, claiming Jenna decided not to use his photos. While looking for Matt to deliver the good news, Jenna finds Wendy, who reveals that their wedding is the next day. Richard informs Jenna that Lucy has become the new editor-in-chief of ''Sparkle'' after presenting them with Jenna's material, including Matt's photographs. Jenna confronts Lucy, who scornfully reveals that Jenna was the one conspiring with ''Sparkle'' and sabotaging ''Poise''; Lucy merely stole the job Jenna was to receive.\n\nJenna rushes to Matt's childhood home, where the wedding will soon be underway. She declares to him that Lucy was lying about the photos, and Matt reveals he already knew, as he never trusted her. She also declares that she is not the bad person she seems to be and begs Matt to give their relationship a chance. Matt realizes though that Jenna is from the past and although he still cares for her, too much time has passed, but returns to Jenna the dollhouse he made her that he has kept for the past 17 years, having rebuilt it, and confesses that he has always loved her. As Jenna sits outside with the dollhouse, she looks inside to see a young Matt and herself.  She begins to cry as the wedding begins, but as she cries, remnants of the wishing dust begins to swirl around her.\n\nJenna reawakens to find herself back in 1987 on her 13th birthday. This time, when Matt finds her alone in the closet, she embraces and kisses him, and realizes that Lucy was never a true friend. She rips up the homework she did for them and with this second chance, Jenna lives the intervening 17 years differently, with her and Matt emerging in 2004 as a newly married couple. They share their favorite childhood candy, [[Razzles]], while moving into a pink house identical to the dollhouse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Jenna Rink\n** [[Christa B.
