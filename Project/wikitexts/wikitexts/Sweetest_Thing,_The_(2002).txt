She is a 28-year-old successful [[interior designer]] living in [[Kearny Street|San Francisco near Chinatown]].\n\nChristina meets up with her friend Courtney Rockcliffe, a divorce lawyer. They console their friend and roommate Jane, who had recently broken up with her boyfriend, by taking her out to a dance club. Jane feels out of place, so Christina grabs a man named Peter to set Jane up with, but he berates Christina for her methods before disappearing for the night. While in the bathroom with Courtney, she calls him by name, leading her to suspect that he got under Christina's skin and she is actually in love with him, which she denies.\n\nAfter running into Peter again, Christina buys him a drink and they spend time together. He explains that he will be attending a wedding on Saturday, and that he is at the club with his obnoxious, [[womanizing]] brother Roger to celebrate. He invites Christina and Courtney to an after-party at their hotel, but Christina goes home and later regrets not going.\n\nThe next day, Christina cannot stop talking about Peter, while Jane pays an embarrassing visit to the [[dry cleaner]].{{efn|In the unedited version, Jane also returns to the lunch and the women talk about always complimenting men for the sizes of their [[Human penis|penises]], eventually breaking out into a restaurant-wide \"Penis Song\".}} Courtney arranges for Christina and herself to travel to [[Somerset, California|Somerset]], where Peter's brother's wedding is to take place, and they meet Jane's boyfriend. After they leave in Courtney's [[Saab 9-5]], Christina and Courtney go on a series of misadventures including an exploding toilet, a [[Glory hole (sexual slang)|glory hole]] discovery, and a motorcyclist who is led to believe Courtney is receiving [[cunnilingus]] while driving.\n\nMeanwhile, Jane encounters her boyfriend at her retail job and is nearly caught having sex with him in a [[changing room]]. When Christina and Courtney finally arrive in Somerset, they visit a store to replace their wet and ruined clothes, only to come out in extremely gaudy, indiscreet outfits. Christina begins having second thoughts, but a series of coincidences causes a change of heart, and they attend Peter's brother's wedding. However, they discover that it is Peter, not Roger, who is getting married, and the pair nearly ruin the ceremony in their attempt to escape. Peter and his fianc\u00e9e then decide that they do not want to marry each other and they call off the wedding.\n\nChristina and Courtney return home and help Jane get out of a sexual situation where the [[Emergency service|emergency crew]] was called in. Christina is back to a newly unfulfilled life of being single again. Later, Peter finds Christina's address in the log at the store they bought their clothes in and tracks her down. Christina, determined not to fear the commitment, kisses Peter and then walks away disappointed.\n\nSometime later, Courtney is dating a doctor and is clearly very attracted to him, and Peter is interviewed like the men at the beginning of the film, retelling his version of the events calling her a bitch and a player, but ultimately reveals that he and Christina are together, having gotten married and are living very happily with Jane and Courtney and Roger as well.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- closing title cards -->\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Christina Walters\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as Courtney Rockcliffe\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as Peter Donahue\n* [[Selma Blair]] as Jane Burns\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Roger Donahue\n<!-- and -->\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Judy Webb\n<!-- end closing title cards -->\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on DVD and VHS on August 20, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|first=Fred|last=Topel|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/product_article.cfm?article_id=3381|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020828200636/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/product_article.cfm?article_id=3381|title=Sweetest Is a Sweeter Deal With Extras|website=hive4media.com|archive-date=August 28, 2002|date=July 5, 2002|access-date=September 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAn unrated version was also released on DVD with some extra scenes added, including a musical performance by Diaz, Applegate and Blair, known as \"The Penis Song\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253867/alternateversions|title=The Sweetest Thing (2002) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=3 March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/movies/2018/03/29/the-sweetest-thing-reunion-diaz-applegate-blair/|title='The Sweetest Thing' reunion!
