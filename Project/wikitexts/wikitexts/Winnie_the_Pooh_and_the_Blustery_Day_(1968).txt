A. Milne]]. The featurette was directed by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution Company]] on December 20, 1968 as a double feature with the live-action comedy feature ''[[The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''. This was the second of the studio's ''[[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' theatrical featurettes. It was later added as a segment to the 1977 film ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]''. The music was written by [[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]]. It was notable for being the last animated short produced by [[Walt Disney]], who died of lung cancer in December 1966, two years before its release.\n\nIt starred the voices of [[Sterling Holloway]] as Winnie the Pooh, [[Jon Walmsley]] as Christopher Robin (replaced [[Bruce Reitherman]]), [[Barbara Luddy]] as Kanga, [[Clint Howard]] as Roo, [[Paul Winchell]] as Tigger, [[Ralph Wright]] as Eeyore, [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Owl, [[Howard Morris]] as Gopher, [[John Fiedler]] as Piglet, [[Junius Matthews]] as Rabbit, and [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]] as the narrator.\n\n''Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day'' won the 1968 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]. The Academy Award was awarded [[List of posthumous Academy Award winners and nominees|posthumously]] to Disney. This was also the only ''Winnie the Pooh'' production to ever win an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Julie|url=https://www.waltdisney.org/blog/and-award-goes-program-recap\n|title=And the Award Goes To....|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Family Museum]]|date=February 23, 2012|access-date=January 27, 2015}}</ref> (''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'', which was released six years later in December 1974, was nominated for the same Academy Award, but lost to ''[[Closed Mondays]]''.)\n\nThe animated featurette also served as an inspiration for the [[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (attraction)|Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride]] in the Disney theme parks in which the rider experiences several scenes from the cartoon, including Pooh's Heffalump and Woozle dream.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/many-adventures-of-winnie-the-pooh/|title=The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh|publisher=[[Walt Disney World]]|date=January 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Sources==\nThe film's plot is based primarily on seven A. A. Milne stories: \"In which Eeyore finds the Wolery and Owl moves into it\" (Chapter IX from ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]]'') \"In which Tigger comes to the forest and has breakfast\" (Chapter II from ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]]''), \"In which Pooh & Piglet go hunting and nearly catch a Woozle\" (Chapter III of ''Winnie the Pooh''), \"In which Piglet does a very grand thing\" (Chapter VIII from ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]]''), \"In which Christopher Robin gives a Pooh Party and we say goodbye\" (Chapter X of ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'') and \"In which Piglet is entirely surrounded by water\" (Chapter IX of ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]''), with elements taken from \"In which Piglet meets a Heffalump\" (Chapter V from ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'': Winnie the Pooh's nightmare of Heffalumps and Woozles). In A. A. Milne's original story, Pooh shows more initiative during the flood, finding his way to Christopher Robin by riding on one of his floating honey pots, which he names ''The Floating Bear'', then having the inspiration of using Christopher Robin's umbrella to carry them both to Piglet's house.<ref>A. A. Milne. ''Winnie-the-Pooh'', Chapter IX</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn a very windy day, Winnie the Pooh visits his \"thoughtful spot\". As Pooh sits thinking, [[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)|Gopher]] pops out of the ground and advises him to leave as it is a \"[[Wednesday|Winds-day]]\". Misunderstanding Gopher's warning, Pooh goes across the Hundred Acre Wood to wish everyone a happy Winds-day. He arrives at the [[beech tree]] home of his good friend [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]], who is nearly blown away while trying to rake leaves. Pooh grabs Piglet by his scarf, like the string of a kite. They pass by [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]] and [[Roo]]; [[Eeyore]], whose stick house Pooh breaks as he passes; and [[Rabbit (Winnie the Pooh)|Rabbit]], whose carrots Pooh inadvertently helps harvest as he slides by.\n\nThe wind blows Pooh and Piglet to [[Owl (Winnie the Pooh)|Owl]]'s treehouse, where he invites them in. Pooh wishes Owl a happy Winds-day, as he has everyone else, but Owl informs them that the wind is due to \"a mild spring [[West wind|zephyr]]\". As Owl tells Pooh and Piglet some of the adventures of his relatives, the strong wind causes his tree to sway. It collapses, taking the house with it; Owl briefly suspects Pooh caused this. [[Christopher Robin]] and the others soon hear of the news and rush to the scene; as Owl's house is wrecked beyond the point of repair, Eeyore volunteers to seek out a new house for Owl, who proceeds to tell the others more stories for quite some time, boring them.\n\nAs night falls, the wind is still blowing, and Pooh is kept awake by noises outside. He opens his door for a visitor: [[Tigger]], who introduces himself with his signature song (\"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\") before stating that he has come looking for something to eat. Disgusted by the taste of Pooh's honey, Tigger tells him that there are Heffalumps and Woozles in the forest that steal honey before departing. Frightened by Tigger's words, Pooh stays up to guard his honey but falls asleep as a thunderstorm brews. After he has a nightmare about Heffalumps and Woozles stealing his honey and chasing him around, Pooh wakes up in a flood caused by the storm.\n\nIn the flood, Piglet is washed away from his home in a floating chair, but not before he manages to write a [[message in a bottle]] for help. Pooh manages to escape to higher ground with ten honey pots, only to also be washed away by the rising waters. Kanga, Roo, Rabbit, and Tigger gather at [[Christopher Robin]]'s house, the only place in the Hundred Acre Wood that isn't flooded, while Eeyore continues house hunting for Owl. Roo finds Piglet's bottle, and Owl flies off to tell Piglet that help is on the way.\n\nOwl eventually finds Piglet as well as Pooh, but before he can inform them of the impending rescue \u2013 and tell another boring story \u2013 a [[waterfall]] threatens to carry them all over the side. Pooh switches places with Piglet as they take the plunge, and the waterfall washes them right into Christopher Robin's yard. Thinking that Pooh has rescued Piglet, Christopher Robin tells Pooh he is a hero. Once the flood has subsided, Christopher Robin throws a party for Pooh, where Eeyore announces he has found a new home for Owl. He leads everyone to his discovery which, known to everyone except Owl and Eeyore, is Piglet's house. Piglet generously lets Owl have his home, despite having nowhere else to live himself. Pooh then invites Piglet to move into his home, which Piglet happily accepts, and at Pooh's request Christopher Robin declares the occasion a \"two hero party\".\n\n==Voice cast==\n\n*[[Sterling Holloway]] as Winnie the Pooh, a [[bear]] who loves eating [[honey]].\n*[[Paul Winchell]] as Tigger, a [[tiger]] who loves to bounce on his tail.\n*[[John Fiedler]] as Piglet, a small [[pig]] and Pooh's best friend who fears nearly everything.\n*[[Clint Howard]] as Roo, Kanga's energetic young joey.\n*[[Barbara Luddy]] as Kanga, a [[kangaroo]] and Roo's mother.\n*[[Ralph Wright]] as Eeyore, an old grey [[donkey]] who is always losing his tail and talks in a slow and deep depressing voice.\n*[[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Owl, an [[owl]] who loves to talk about his family.\n*[[Junius Matthews]] as Rabbit, a [[rabbit]] who is [[obsessive-compulsive]] and loves planting his vegetables in his garden.\n*[[Jon Walmsley]] as Christopher Robin, a seven-year-old [[boy]] and Pooh's human best friend.\n*[[Howard Morris]] as Gopher, a hardworking [[gopher]] who lives underground and often falls into his hole.\n*[[The Mellomen]] as the Singers.\n*[[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]] as Mr. Narrator.\n\n==Production==\nShortly before Walt Disney's in December 1966, the animation department was finishing work on ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' and preparing for ''[[The Aristocats]]''. In late summer 1967, before ''The Aristocats'' went into production, it was decided to go ahead with a featurette-length sequel to ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree]]''.{{sfn|Finch|2000|p=50}} Because ''The Honey Tree'' was popular with American audiences, it was decided ''Blustery Day'' would be the first animation project without Disney. Under the new circumstances, the \"[[Disney's Nine Old Men|Nine Old Men]]\" animators [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], [[Ollie Johnston]], and [[Milt Kahl]] were brought onto the project. [[Wolfgang Reitherman]] remained as director, but he decided to feel more faithful to the source material.{{sfn|Finch|2000|p=51}}\n\nDuring a story meeting for the short, Disney considered [[Wally Boag]] to be perfect for the role of Tigger, who was added to the short.<ref name=\"laughingplace.com\">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Jim|title=The Greatest Performances You Never Got to Hear|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/News-PID115010-115011.asp|page=[https://www.laughingplace.com/w/leg/?legacyasppage=News-PID115010-115011.asp 2]|website=The Laughing Place|date=April 3, 2001|access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref> However, after Disney's death, Boag's performance of the character was considered to be \"too zany for a children's film,\" and [[Paul Winchell]], a ventriloquist, took the job instead.<ref name=\"laughingplace.com\"/> Following a British backlash to ''The Honey Tree'' led by film critic [[Felix Barker]], [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]] was added to the short.<ref>{{cite web|last=Milne|first=James|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611191355/http://www.pooh-corner.org/general.shtml|title=The Page at Pooh Corner|url=http://www.pooh-corner.org/general.shtml|website=pooh-corner.org|archive-date=June 11, 2007|access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref> For the part, Disney had heard [[John Fiedler]]'s voice on television and selected him to voice the character.
