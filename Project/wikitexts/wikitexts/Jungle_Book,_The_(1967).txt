Based on [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s 1894 [[The Jungle Book|book of the same title]], it is the 19th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. Directed by [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], it was the last film to be produced by [[Walt Disney]], who died during its production, and the first animated feature film released after his death. The plot follows [[Mowgli]], a [[feral child]] raised in the [[India]]n jungle by wolves, as his friends [[Bagheera]] the panther and [[Baloo]] the bear try to convince him to leave the jungle before the evil tiger [[Shere Khan]] arrives.\n\nThe early versions of both the screenplay and the soundtrack followed Kipling's work more closely, with a dramatic, dark, and sinister tone which Disney did not want in his family film, leading to writer [[Bill Peet]] and songwriter [[Terry Gilkyson]] being replaced. The casting employed famous actors and musicians [[Phil Harris]], [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]], [[George Sanders]] and [[Louis Prima]], as well as Disney regulars such as [[Sterling Holloway]], [[J. Pat O'Malley]] and [[Verna Felton]], and the director's son, [[Bruce Reitherman]], as Mowgli.\n\n''The Jungle Book'' was released on October 18, 1967, to positive reception, with acclaim for its soundtrack, featuring five songs by the [[Sherman Brothers]] and one by Gilkyson, \"[[The Bare Necessities]]\". With a gross of $23.8 million worldwide, the film initially became Disney's second-highest-grossing animated film in the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"AllTime1971\">{{cite news|work=[[Variety (Magazine)|Variety]]|title=All-Time Box Office Champs |date=January 6, 1971|page=12}}</ref> the [[1967 in film|ninth-highest-grossing film of 1967]], and was also successful during its re-releases.

Current count is 550 words.-->\n\n[[Mowgli]], a young [[orphan]] boy, is found in a basket in the deep jungles of [[India]] by [[Bagheera]], a [[black panther]] who promptly takes him to Raksha, a mother [[Indian wolf|wolf]] who has just had cubs. She and her mate, Rama, raise him along with their own cubs and after ten years, Mowgli becomes well acquainted with jungle life and plays with his wolf siblings. Bagheera is pleased with how happy Mowgli is now, but also worries that Mowgli must eventually return to his own kind.\n\nOne night, the wolf pack parents meet at Council Rock, having learned that [[Shere Khan]], a [[Bengal tiger]], has returned to the pack's part of the jungle. Pack leader Akela decides that Mowgli must leave the jungle for his own safety, and the safety of those around him, due to the tiger\u2019s intense hatred of humans due to a fear of guns and fire. Bagheera volunteers to escort him to a \"Man-Village\". They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle. He and Bagheera rest in a tree for the night, where [[Kaa]], a hungry [[Indian python]], tries to devour Mowgli, but Bagheera intervenes. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the [[Indian elephant|elephant]] patrol, led by [[Hathi|Colonel Hathi]] and his wife Winifred. Bagheera finds Mowgli, but after a fight, decides to leave Mowgli on his own. Mowgli soon meets up with the laid-back, fun-loving [[sloth bear]] [[Baloo]], who promises to raise Mowgli himself and never take him to the Man-Village.\n\nShortly afterward, a group of [[Bandar-log|monkeys]] kidnap Mowgli and take him to their leader, [[King Louie]] the [[orangutan]]. King Louie offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle if he will tell Louie how to make fire, like other humans. However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli does not know how to make fire. Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli and in the ensuing chaos, King Louie's palace is demolished to rubble. Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli with Shere Khan around. In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for him, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol. However, Shere Khan himself, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Mowgli has a second encounter with Kaa, who once again, attempts to eat him after putting him to sleep with [[hypnosis]], but eventually wakes up and escapes thanks to the unwitting intervention of the suspicious Shere Khan. As a storm gathers, a depressed Mowgli encounters a group of friendly [[Slender-billed vulture|vulture]]s who accept Mowgli as a fellow outcast. Shere Khan appears shortly after, scaring off the vultures and confronting Mowgli. Baloo arrives and haplessly tries to keep the tiger from getting the boy. When lightning strikes a nearby tree and sets it ablaze, the vultures swoop in to distract Shere Khan, while Mowgli grabs a large flaming branch and ties it to the tiger's tail. Shere Khan, seeing this, panics and runs away.\n\nAfter that, Bagheera and Baloo take Mowgli to the edge of the Man-Village, but Mowgli is still hesitant to go there. However, his mind abruptly changes when he is smitten by a beautiful young girl from the village who is coming down by the riverside to fetch water. After noticing Mowgli, she \"accidentally\" drops her water pot. Mowgli retrieves it for her and follows her into the Man-Village. After Mowgli [[shrug]]s to Baloo and Bagheera, to show that he has made up his mind and chosen to go to the Man-Village, Baloo and Bagheera decide to head home, content that Mowgli is safe and happy with his own kind.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|The Jungle Book characters}}\n* [[Bruce Reitherman]] as [[Mowgli]], an orphaned boy, commonly referred to as \"man-cub\" by the other characters.\n* [[Phil Harris]] as [[Baloo]], a [[sloth bear]] who leads a carefree life and believes in letting the good things in life come by themselves.\n* [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]] as [[Bagheera]], a [[black panther]] who is determined to take Mowgli back to the village and disapproves of Baloo's carefree approach to life.\n* [[Louis Prima]] as [[King Louie]], an [[orangutan]]  who wants to be a human, and wants Mowgli to teach him how to make fire.\n* [[George Sanders]] as [[Shere Khan]], an intelligent yet merciless [[Bengal tiger]] who hates all humans for fear of their guns and fire and wants to kill Mowgli.\n* [[Sterling Holloway]] as [[Kaa]], an [[Indian python]] who also seeks Mowgli as prey, but comically fails each time he attempts to eat him.\n* [[J.

However, after the disappointing reaction to ''The Sword in the Stone'', Disney decided to become more involved in the story than he had been with the past two films,<ref name=thomas/> with his nephew [[Roy E. Disney]] saying that \"[he] certainly influenced everything about it. (...) With ''Jungle Book'', he obviously got hooked on the jungle and the characters that lived there\".<ref>{{cite AV media|title=The Legacy of the Jungle Book|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|location=''[[The Jungle Book 2]]'' DVD |year=2003 }}</ref>\n\nPeet decided to follow closely the dramatic, dark, and sinister tone of Kipling's book, which is about the struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going back and forth from the jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created the character of Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from ''[[The Second Jungle Book]]'', gold and jewels under his ruins.<ref name=kipling>{{cite AV media|title=Disney's Kipling: Walt's Magic Touch on a Literary Classic''|location=''The Jungle Book'' Platinum Edition, Disc 2|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|year=2007}}</ref><ref name=thomas>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Bob|url=https://archive.org/details/disneysartofanim0000thom|title=Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Beauty and the Beast|chapter=Chapter 7: The Post-War Films|publisher=Disney Editions|pages=[https://archive.org/details/disneysartofanim0000thom/page/106/mode/2up 106\u2013107]|year=1991|isbn=1-56282-899-1|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nThe ending also was very different from the final film's. After Mowgli had arrived to the man village, he would get into an argument with Buldeo the hunter which would cause him to return to the jungle with a torch that he would use to scare those who attacked or mocked him through the journey, before being dragged back to the ruins by Buldeo in search for the treasure. After recovering a great part of the treasure, Buldeo would declare his intentions to burn the jungle to avoid the threat of Shere Khan, only for the tiger to attack and kill him, before being killed by Mowgli with the hunter's gun. Due to his actions, Mowgli would be hailed as a hero in both the jungle and the village, and declared the first human to be part of the wolves' council.<ref name=kipling/><ref name=thomas/> Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.<ref name=bare>{{cite book|last=Barrier|first=Michael|title=The Animated Man: A Life of Walt Disney|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmanlifeo0000barr|page=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmanlifeo0000barr/page/276/mode/2up 276]|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-520256-19-4|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nDisney then assigned Larry Clemmons as his new writer and one of the four-story men for the film, giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling's book, and telling him: \"The first thing I want you to do is not to read it\".<ref name=thomas /> Clemmons still looked at the novel and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity, needing adaptations to fit a film script. Clemmons wanted to start [[in medias res]], with some flashbacks afterward, but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight: \"Let's do the meat of the picture. Let's establish the characters. Let's have fun with it\".<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Larry Clemmons |title=The Jungle Book |type=[[audio commentary]] |location=''The Jungle Book'' Platinum Edition DVD |year=2007 |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nAlthough most of Peet's work was discarded, the personalities of the characters remained in the final film. This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple, and the characters should drive the story. Disney took an active role in the story meetings, acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters, helping create gags, and developing emotional sequences.<ref name=thomas /> Clemmons also created the human girl with whom Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle.<ref name=kipling/><ref name=thomas/> Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most sequences. The story artists then discussed how to fill the scenes, including the comedic gags to employ.<ref name=norman>{{cite book|title=Prepare To Board!: Creating Story and Characters for Animated Features and Shorts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0Ub7xvnBkYC&pg=PA163|first=Nancy|last=Beiman|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-240-80820-8|access-date=July 19, 2016|archive-date=January 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106131841/https://books.google.com/books?id=V0Ub7xvnBkYC&pg=PA163|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Walt's People: Volume 9\u2013Talking Disney with the Artists who Knew Him|editor=Ghez, Didier|author=Norman, Floyd|chapter=Three Disney Story Guys|page=175|publisher=[[Xlibris]]|year=2010|isbn=978-1-450-08746-9}}</ref> The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other.<ref name=crown/> ''The Jungle Book'' also marked the last animated film to have Disney's personal touches, before his death on December 15, 1966.<ref name=maltin>{{cite book|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|title=The Disney Films|chapter=The Jungle Book|publisher=Disney Editions|pages=253\u2013256|year=2000|isbn=978-0-786885-27-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=\"In ''The Jungle Book'' we tried to incorporate the personalities of the actors that do the voices into the cartoon characters, and we came up with something totally different.

This was Felton's last film before her death.<ref name=maltin /> David Bailey was originally cast as Mowgli, but his voice changed during production, leading Bailey to not fit the \"young innocence of Mowgli's character\" at which the producers were aiming. As a result, director [[Wolfgang Reitherman]] cast his son [[Bruce Reitherman|Bruce]], who had just voiced [[Christopher Robin#Disney adaptations|Christopher Robin]] in ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree]]''.

Disney lightened it up by having the vultures bearing a physical and vocal resemblance to [[The Beatles]], including the signature [[mop-top]] haircut. It was also planned to have the members of the band to both voice the characters and sing their song, \"[[That's What Friends Are For (The Vulture Song)|That's What Friends Are For]]\".

Following one of Reitherman's trademarks of reusing animation of his previous films, the wolf cubs are based on dogs from ''101 Dalmatians''.
