The film was released in June 1995 in the United States.\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in Paris, France, in 1940 in the early days of World War II before the German [[Battle of France|invasion]] and conquest of France, Elena Martin ([[Audie England]]) is a young American writer struggling to get by in Paris while searching for inspiration for her first novel. Elena meets and has a sordid affair with a fellow American expatriate named  Lawrence Walters ([[Costas Mandylor]]). With some encouragement from her friends, her lover, and her publisher, Elena gets involved in nude modeling and progresses onward through many other forms of voyeuristic and participatory sexual adventures as she further researches for inspiration to write her book and become an author of erotic fiction.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Audie England]] as Elena Martin\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as Lawrence Walters\n* Eric Da Silva as Marcel\n* Raven Snow as Leila\n* Rory Campbell as Miguel\n* Emma Louise Moore as Ariel\n* Bernard Zette as Donald (as Zette)\n* [[Marek Vasut]] as Luc\n* Mark\u00e9ta Hrubesov\u00e1 as Bijou\n* Daniel Leza as Pierre\n* Stephen Halbert as Harry\n* Dale Wyatt as Millicent\n* Jir\u00ed Ded as Priest\n* Val\u00e9rie Zawadsk\u00e1 as Landlady\n* James Donahower as Bandleader\n* [[Robert Davi]] as The Collector\n* [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] as The Clairvoyant (as Wale)\n* [[Clive Revill]] as Radio Announcer (voice)\n* [[Roberta Hanley]] as Opium Den Proprietor\n\n== Background ==\nThe novel by [[Ana\u00efs Nin]] on which the film is based is not autobiographical, nor does it have a frame narrative. The film imposes a frame-narrative about a \"Nin-like\" American who begins an affair with another [[expatriate]] American in pre\u2013[[World War II]] [[Paris]], and who writes [[Erotic literature|erotic stories]] that represent her fantasies. Some of these stories/fantasies, based on those of Nin, are explored on-screen.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0109593}}\n\n{{Zalman King}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delta Of Venus (Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:American erotic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Zalman King]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George S.
