This was the fifth of fourteen films in which Powell and Loy were teamed.\n\n''Libeled Lady'' was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. The film was [[remake|remade]] in 1946 as ''[[Easy to Wed]]'' with [[Esther Williams]], [[Van Johnson]], and [[Lucille Ball]].\n\n==Plot==\nWealthy Connie Allenbury is falsely accused of breaking up a marriage and sues the ''New York Evening Star'' newspaper for $5,000,000 for [[libel]]. Warren Haggerty, the managing editor, turns in desperation to former reporter and suave ladies' man Bill Chandler for help. Bill's scheme is to maneuver Connie into being alone with him when his wife shows up, so that the suit will have to be dropped. Bill is not married, so Warren volunteers his long-suffering fianc\u00e9e, Gladys Benton, to marry Bill in name only, over her loud protests.\n\nBill arranges to return to America from England on the same ocean liner as Connie and her father J. B. He pays some men to pose as reporters and harass Connie at the dock, so that he can \"rescue\" her and become acquainted. On the voyage, Connie initially treats him with contempt, assuming that he is just the latest in a long line of fortune hunters after her money, but Bill gradually overcomes her suspicions.\n\nComplications arise when Connie and Bill actually fall in love. They get married, but Gladys decides that she prefers Bill to a marriage-averse newspaperman and interrupts their honeymoon to reclaim her husband. Bill reveals that he found out that Gladys was married before and that her Yucat\u00e1n divorce was invalid, thus rendering their own marriage invalid. But Gladys reveals she got a second divorce in Reno, so she and Bill are legally man and wife. Connie and Bill manage to show Gladys that she really loves Warren.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Image:Jean Harlow in Libeled Lady trailer.jpg|70px]] [[Jean Harlow]] as Gladys Benton\n* [[Image:William Powell in Libeled Lady trailer.jpg|70px]] [[William Powell]] as Bill Chandler\n* [[Image:Myrna Loy in Libeled Lady trailer.jpg|70px]] [[Myrna Loy]] as Connie Allenbury\n* [[Image:Spencer Tracy in Libeled Lady trailer.jpg|70px]] [[Spencer Tracy]] as Warren Haggerty\n* [[Image:Walter Connolly in Libeled Lady trailer.jpg|70px]] [[Walter Connolly]] as James B.
