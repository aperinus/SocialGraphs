Directed by [[Academy Award]] winning filmmaker [[Taylor Hackford]] and written by [[Edward di Lorenzo]], The Idolmaker was the feature film debut of Peter Gallagher, Joe Pantoliano, and Paul Land. Bob Marcucci served as a [[technical advisor]] for the production.\n\n==Plot== \nSet in 1959, Vincent \"Vinnie\" Vacarri ([[Ray Sharkey]]), a Brooklyn-based songwriter pursues success in the fledgling rock 'n' roll music business, along with his best friend and piano accompanist Gino \"G.G.\" Pilato ([[Joe Pantoliano]]). After being impressed by a charismatic local saxophone player, Tomaso DeLorusso ([[Paul Land]]), Vinnie convinces him to trade his instrument for a microphone and over the next few months, under Vinnie's strict guidance, the newly named \"Tommy Dee\" becomes a rock 'n' roll sensation.\n\nSearching for continued success, Vinnie prepares another act in the form of Guido ([[Peter Gallagher]]), a local teen [[busboy]], prompting a jealous and arrogant Tommy Dee to abandon him for a new manager. With even more gusto and single-mindedness, Vinnie embarks on a destructive journey to control every aspect of his new act's image.\n\nDespite his obvious flair for creating teen idols, Vinnie's girlfriend, Brenda ([[Tovah Feldshuh]]), a successful teen magazine editor, is concerned that his obsession is destroying everyone around him, including himself.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ray Sharkey]] as Vincent \"Vinnie\" Vacarri\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as Guido/Caesare\n* [[Tovah Feldshuh]] as\tBrenda Roberts\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Gino \"G.G.\" Pilato\n* [[Paul Land]] as Tomaso \"Tommy Dee\" DeLorusso\n* [[Maureen McCormick]] as Ellen Fields\n* [[Olympia Dukakis]] as Mrs. Vacarri\n* [[John Aprea]] as Pani Vacarri\n\n==Production==\nMarcucci approached producer Gene Kirkwood with the idea for the film. In the original script, the singers were more sympathetic and the producer less so.<ref>\"MOVIES: THE STORY OF FRANK AND FABE AND BOB\" Farley, Ellen.
