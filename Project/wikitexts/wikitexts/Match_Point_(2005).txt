In the film, Rhys Meyers's character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Scarlett Johansson. The film deals with themes of morality and greed, and explores the roles of lust, money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' (1989). It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set in New York, for a British setting.\n\nCritics in the United States praised the film and its British setting, and welcomed it as a return to form for Allen. In contrast, reviewers from the United Kingdom treated ''Match Point'' less favorably, finding fault with the locations and especially the British idiom in the dialogues. Allen was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nChris Wilton, a recently retired tennis professional from Ireland, is taken on as an instructor at an upmarket club in [[London]]. He strikes up a friendship with a wealthy pupil, Tom Hewett, after discovering their common affinity for opera. Tom's older sister, Chloe, is smitten with Chris, and the two begin dating. During a family gathering, Chris meets Tom's American fianc\u00e9e, Nola Rice, and they are instantly attracted to each other. Tom's mother, Eleanor, does not approve of her son's relationship with Nola, a struggling actress. This is a source of tension in the family. Chloe persuades her father, Alec, to give Chris a job as an executive in one of his companies.  Alec does so, and Chris begins to be accepted into the family, and marriage is discussed.\n\nOne afternoon, Nola's choice of profession is questioned by Eleanor, and Nola leaves the house in anger during a rainstorm. Chris follows Nola outside and confesses his feelings for her, and they passionately have sex in a wheat field. Feeling guilty, Nola treats this as an accident. Chris, however, wants an ongoing clandestine relationship. Chris and Chloe marry, while Tom ends his relationship with Nola.\n\nChloe, to her distress, does not become pregnant immediately. Chris vainly tries to track down Nola, but meets her by chance sometime later at [[Tate Modern]]. He discreetly asks for her number, and they begin an affair. While Chris is spending time with his wife's family, Nola calls to inform him that she is pregnant. Panicked, Chris asks her to get an abortion, but she refuses, saying that she wants to raise the child with him. Chris becomes distant from Chloe, who suspects he is having an affair, which he denies. Nola urges Chris to divorce his wife, and he feels trapped and finds himself lying to Chloe as well as to Nola. Nola confronts him on the street outside his apartment and he just barely escapes public detection.\n\nSoon afterwards, Chris takes a shotgun from his father-in-law's home and carries it to his office in a tennis bag. After leaving the office, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he has good news for her. He goes to Nola's building and gains entry into the apartment of her neighbor, Mrs. Eastby, whom he shoots and kills and then stages a [[burglary]] by ransacking the rooms and stealing jewelry and drugs. As Nola returns, he shoots her in the stairwell. Chris then takes a taxi to the theater to watch a musical with Chloe. [[Scotland Yard]] investigates the crime and concludes it was likely committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, as the murder is in the news, Chris returns the shotgun and he and Chloe announce that she is pregnant.\n\nDetective Mike Banner invites Chris for an interview in relation to the murder. Before he goes in to see the detectives, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the railing and falls to the pavement. This imagery ties in to the opening scene when a tennis ball hits the net, but bounces back, and the narrator (Chris) says, \"The man who said, 'I'd rather be lucky than good,' saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control. There are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second, it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward, and you win. Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose.\"\n\nAt the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.\n\nOne night, Chris sees apparitions of Nola and Mrs. Eastby, who tell him to be ready for the consequences of his actions. He replies that his crimes, though wrong, had been \"necessary\", and that he is able to suppress his guilt. The same night, Banner dreams that Chris committed the murders.\n\nThe next morning, however, his theory is discredited by his partner, Dowd, who informs him that a drug addict found murdered on the streets had Mrs. Eastby's ring in his pocket. Banner and Dowd consider the case closed and abandon any further investigation. Chloe gives birth to a baby boy named Terence, and his uncle blesses him not with greatness but with luck.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as Chris Wilton\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Nola Rice\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Chloe Hewett Wilton\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as Tom Hewett\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Alec Hewett\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Eleanor Hewett\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Inspector Dowd\n* [[James Nesbitt]] as Detective Mike Banner\n* [[Rupert Penry-Jones]] as Henry\n* [[Margaret Tyzack]] as Mrs. Betty Eastby\n* [[Alexander Armstrong]] as Mr. Townsend\n* [[Geoffrey Streatfeild]] as Alan Sinclair\n* [[Miranda Raison]] as Heather\n* [[Zoe Telford]] as Samantha\n* [[Rose Keegan]] as Carol\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as Ian\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Policeman\n* [[Paul Kaye]] as Estate Agent\n* [[Steve Pemberton]] as Detective Parry\n\n==Production==\nThe script was originally set in [[The Hamptons]], a wealthy enclave in New York, but was transferred to London when Allen found financing for the film there.<ref name='Scott'>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.O.|author-link=A.

The sequence establishes the protagonist as an introvert, a man who mediates his experience of the world through deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from the outer world and that ramifications therein pale in comparison to the purity of interior experience.<ref name='Goyios'>Goyios, Charalampos [http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2006/40/match-point/ Living Life as an Opera Lover: On the Uses of Opera as Musical Accompaniment in Woody Allen's ''Match Point''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722082003/http://sensesofcinema.com/2006/40/match-point/ |date=22 July 2012 }}, ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'', Issue 40. Retrieved 21 January 2012.</ref>\n\nThe film is a debate with [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', which Wilton is seen reading early on, identifying him with the [[anti-hero]] [[Raskolnikov]].<ref name='Goyios' /> That character is a brooding loner who kills two women to prove that he is a superior being, but is racked by guilt and is finally redeemed by confession of his crime, the love of a young woman forced into prostitution, and the discovery of God. Wilton is a brooding loner who kills a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little guilt, and avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance in the stairwell, and both sleuths play cat and mouse with the suspect. Allen argues, unlike Dostoevsky, that there is neither God, nor punishment, nor love to provide redemption. The theme of parody and reversal of Dostoevsky's motifs and subject matter has been visited by Allen before, in his film ''[[Love and Death]]''. In ''Love and Death'', the dialogue and scenarios [[parody]] Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoevsky and [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], such as ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', ''[[The Gambler (novel)|The Gambler]]'', ''[[The Idiot]]'', and ''[[War and Peace]]''.<ref name=tcmart>{{cite web | last=Stafford | first=Jeff | url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17640/Love-and-Death/articles.html | title=Love and Death (1975) | publisher=[[TCM.com]] | access-date=23 August 2013 | quote=...he was able to pay homage to some of his favorite films: a battlefield hawker who sells [[blini]]s to the troops recalls [[Harpo Marx]] in ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933), a dueling scene appears modeled on a Bob Hope routine in ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (1946 film)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' (1946), the climax is a direct nod to Ingmar Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957) and the ''[[Scythian Suite]]'' by Stravinsky is used as background music in one scene, just as it was in Sergei Eisenstein's ''[[Alexander Nevsky]]'' (1938). Famous dialogue from the novels of Tolstoy like ''[[War and Peace]]'' and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' is also parodied along with in-jokes about the poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]]. | archive-date=31 July 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731040302/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17640/Love-and-Death/articles.html | url-status=live }}</ref> In ''Match Point'', Allen moves the theme from parody to the more direct engagement of Dostoevsky's motifs and narratives.<ref name=\"tcmart\" />\n\nAllen revisits some of the themes he had explored in ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' (1989), such as the existence of justice in the universe. Both films feature a murder of an unwanted mistress, and \"offer a depressing view on fate, fidelity, and the nature of man\".<ref name='Jacobs'>Jacobs, Andy [https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2005/12/19/match_point_2005_review.shtml ''Match Point'' (2006)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201015615/http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2005/12/19/match_point_2005_review.shtml |date=1 December 2017 }} www.bbc.co.uk/film, 6 January 2006; Retrieved 21 January 2012</ref> That film's protagonist, Judah Rosenthal, is an affluent member of the [[upper-middle class]] having an extramarital affair. After he tries to break the affair off, his mistress blackmails him and threatens to go to his wife. Soon, Rosenthal decides to murder his mistress, but is racked with guilt over violating his moral code. Eventually, he learns to ignore his guilt and go on as though nothing has happened. [[Philip French]] compared the two films' plots and themes in ''[[The Observer]]'', and characterized ''Match Point'''s as a \"clever twist on the themes of chance and fate\".<ref name='French' />\n\nMoney is an important motivator for the characters: both Wilton and Nola come from modest backgrounds and wish to enter the Hewett family using their sex appeal. That family's secure position is demonstrated by their large country estate, and, early on in their relationships, both prospective spouses are supported by Mr. Hewett, Wilton with a position on \"one of his companies\" and Nola reports being \"swept off her feet\" by Hewett's attention and presents.<ref name='Ebert'>[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]], [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/match-point-2006 Review: ''Match Point''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920082244/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/match-point-2006 |date=20 September 2016 }}, 6 January 2006. Retrieved 22 January 2012</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] posed the film's underlying question as \"To what degree are we prepared to set aside our moral qualms in order to indulge in greed and selfishness? Wilton is facing a choice between greed and lust, but his sweet wife, Chloe, herself has no qualms about having her father essentially 'buy' her husband for her.\"<ref name='Ebert' />\n\nJean-Baptiste Morain, writing in ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'', noticed how the strong do not accept their own weakness and have no qualms about perpetuating an injustice to defend their interests. This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and ''arrivisme'', resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.<ref name='Morain' />\n\n==Musical accompaniment==\nThe film's soundtrack consists almost entirely of pre-[[World War I]] [[78 rpm]] recordings of opera [[aria]]s sung by the Italian tenor [[Enrico Caruso]]. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work as an indicator of social class, such as in ''[[Husbands and Wives]]'' (1992). In ''Match Point'', the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasizes his detachment from his crime.<ref name='Goyios' />\n\nThe 10-minute murder scene which forms the film's climax is scored with almost the whole of the Act II duet between [[Othello (character)|Otello]] and [[Iago]] from [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Otello]]''. This is an atypical scoring for a film, since Verdi's piece is not an aria, but a dramatic dialogue in which the words are as important as the music. Thus the astute spectator will be presented with ''two'' dramatic narratives to follow; Allen is not respecting traditional conventions of cinematic accompaniment, since the score's events do not match the story unfolding onscreen.<ref name='Goyios' />\n\nArias and extracts include work by Verdi (in particular ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', ''[[La traviata]]'', '' [[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[Rigoletto]]''), [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'', [[Georges Bizet]]'s ''[[Les p\u00eacheurs de perles]]'', and [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes]]'s ''[[Salvator Rosa (opera)|Salvator Rosa]]'' sung by Caruso. The romanza \"[[Una furtiva lagrima]]\" from ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' is featured repeatedly, including during the opening credits. The Caruso arias are supplemented by [[diegetic]] music from contemporary performances that the characters attend over the course of the film. There are scenes at the [[Royal Opera House]] and elsewhere performed by opera singers (scenes from ''La traviata'' performed by [[Janis Kelly (soprano)|Janis Kelly]] and [[Alan Oke]], from ''Rigoletto'' performed by [[Mary Hegarty]]), accompanied by a piano (performed by Tim Lole).<ref>{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Adam|year=2007|chapter=''Match Point'' (2005)|title=The Soundtracks of Woody Allen|publisher=Macfarland|pages=87\u201390|isbn=9780786429684}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nAllen has said that ''Match Point'' is one of his few \"A-films\", and even \"arguably may be the best film that I've made.
