The film follows the show's hectic, rushed six-day production schedule, in which a 22-minute episode is completed just hours before its original air date.\n\nThe film premiered on October 9, 2011 on [[Comedy Central]], and received positive reviews from critics. The documentary was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] in the Outstanding Nonfiction Special category.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film opens as ''South Park'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] leave [[New York City]] and the 2011 opening night of their [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' to return to [[Los Angeles]] to begin the [[South Park (season 15)|fifteenth season]] of ''South Park''. The documentary chronicles the production of the season premiere, \"[[HumancentiPad]]\", beginning the Thursday prior to airing. Parker and Stone, alongside producers [[Anne Garefino]], [[Vernon Chatman]], [[Bill Hader]], and Susan Arneson, discuss ideas for the episode. Parker mentions his annoyance with downloading the latest version of [[iTunes]], and being forced to comply with the software's long list of [[terms and conditions]]. The rant leads to ideas, with Parker instructing the [[storyboard]] team on how to stage a shot. The film covers various aspects of production, including [[voice acting]], animation, [[lip sync]], communication with [[standards and practices]], character design, and editing.\n\nBy the next Tuesday, one day before airing, the staff are preparing for their ritual all-nighter, with Parker and Stone still involved in crafting the episode's plot, and the former still crafting its unfinished script. The episode is completed the following morning just after 7am, with audio and picture lock lasting until the afternoon, after which supervising producer Frank C. Agnone II takes the master tape to a nearby uplink facility, where it is sent to [[Comedy Central]] in New York hours before it airs nationwide.\n\n==Production==\nBradford was friends with the duo for nearly 17 years prior, and they had worked together on the program ''[[How's Your News?]]''. Stone initially declined Bradford's suggestion of documenting the ''South Park'' production process, as they disliked having cameras in the studio, among other reasons. Bradford became involved when they later requested he film a documentary based on ''The Book of Mormon''. That documentary \"ended up not working out,\" and, combined with the fifteenth anniversary of ''South Park'', \"things kind of aligned at that point.\" Bradford was a fan of the show prior, and felt a license to ask harder questions behind the camera than he would with the duo personally.<ref name=\"mtv\">{{cite web|author= Charles Webb |title=Documentarian Arthur Bradford on ''6 Days to Air: The Making of South Park''|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2011/10/10/documentarian-arthur-bradford-on-6-days-to-air-the-making-of-south-park/|date=October 10, 2011|publisher=[[MTV News]]|access-date=May 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''6 Days to Air'' received positive reviews.
