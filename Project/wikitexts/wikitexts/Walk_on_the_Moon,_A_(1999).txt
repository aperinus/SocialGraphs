The film, which was set against the backdrop of the [[Woodstock]] festival of 1969 and the United States's [[Apollo 11|Moon landing]] of that year, was distributed by [[Miramax|Miramax Films]]. Directed by [[Tony Goldwyn]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], the fim was acclaimed on release. [[Diane Lane]] earned an [[Independent Spirit Award]] nomination for Best Female Lead for her performance.\n\n== Plot ==\nPearl Kantrowitz and her husband Marty are a [[lower middle class]] [[Jews|Jewish]] couple in [[New York City]]. For the summer of 1969, the couple go on their annual vacation at [[Borscht Belt|Dr. Fogler's Bungalows]] in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] with their family, which includes teenage daughter Alison, young son Danny, and Marty's mother Lillian.\n\nMarty, who works as a television repairman back in the city, can only visit his family at the camp on the weekends. Pearl, who got pregnant with Alison at the age of 17 and quickly married Marty, feels at a crossroads in her life. She meets Walker Jerome, a free-spirited salesman who goes from resort to resort selling clothes. With Marty absent, Pearl starts spending more time with Walker and they begin an affair. Meanwhile, Alison undergoes her own summer of changes and experiences teenage rites of passage\u2014her [[menarche|first period]], her first date, and her first kiss with Ross Epstein, a boy at the camp.\n\nThe impending [[Apollo 11|Moon landing]] has kept Marty busy at his job, as customers are anxious to have their TV sets ready for the historic event. While the whole town celebrates [[Neil Armstrong]]'s first steps on the moon, Pearl and Walker have sex. Marty's mother Lillian learns of the affair and tries to persuade Pearl to break it off. But the affair continues when Marty cannot visit on the weekend because of the traffic jams caused by the huge [[Woodstock festival]], which is taking place within walking distance of the bungalow colony. Pearl goes to the festival with Walker. Alison goes to the festival as well with her friends, although her mother had explicitly forbidden her to do so. When Alison happens to see Pearl in the festival crowds carousing with Walker while on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], she becomes upset and leaves with Ross.\n\nMarty learns of his wife's affair and confronts Pearl. Alison also confronts her mother in an emotional scene. Pearl is forced to deal with her love of her family and her conflicting yearning for marital freedom.\n\nPearl decides to stay with Marty and tells Walker she can\u2019t go away with him. Walker says he understands. The final scene shows Pearl and Marty dancing together, first to [[Dean Martin]]'s \"[[When You're Smiling]]\" and then to [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s \"[[Purple Haze]]\", after Marty changes the radio station.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Diane Lane]] as Pearl Kantrowitz\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Walker Jerome\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Marty Kantrowitz\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Allison Kantrowitz\n* [[Tovah Feldshuh]] as Lillian Kantrowitz\n* Bobby Boriello as Danny Kantrowitz\n* [[Julie Kavner]] as P.A.
