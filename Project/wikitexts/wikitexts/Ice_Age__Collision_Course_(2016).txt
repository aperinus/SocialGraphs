The film was directed by [[Michael Thurmeier]].<ref name=\"AWNMannyDiegoSidScratReturn\" /> and stars [[Ray Romano]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Keke Palmer]], [[Josh Peck]], [[Simon Pegg]], [[Seann William Scott]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], and [[Queen Latifah]] reprising their roles from previous films, with [[Adam DeVine]], [[Jesse Tyler Ferguson]], [[Max Greenfield]], [[Jessie J]], and [[Nick Offerman]] voicing new characters. In the film, after Scrat is propelled into [[outer space]] in an abandoned [[unidentified flying object|spaceship]] during an attempt to bury his acorn and accidentally sends a giant [[asteroid]] towards Earth, Manny, the Herd, and Buck must go on a life-or-death mission to find a way to fend it off.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Sydney Film Festival]] on June 19, 2016, and was released in the United States on July 22, 2016. The film received generally negative reviews from critics with Rotten Tomatoes calling it \"unoriginal and unfunny\". It grossed $408.5 million worldwide against a $105 million production budget, [[Box office bomb|grossing below expectations]] in the US market, but faring better internationally. ''Ice Age: Collision Course'' was the final film in the ''Ice Age'' series to be produced by Blue Sky Studios before its closure on April 10, 2021.<ref>{{cite news|last1=D'Alessandro|first1=Anthony|title=Disney Closing Blue Sky Studios, Fox's Once-Dominant Animation House Behind 'Ice Age' Franchise|url=https://deadline.com/2021/02/blue-sky-studios-closing-disney-ice-age-franchise-animation-1234690310/|access-date=February 9, 2021|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=February 9, 2021|language=en|archive-date=February 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209175505/https://deadline.com/2021/02/blue-sky-studios-closing-disney-ice-age-franchise-animation-1234690310/|url-status=live}}</ref> A standalone spin-off, titled ''[[The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild]]'', was released in 2022 on [[Disney+]].<ref name=\"Production Document\">[https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/documents/production_notes_disney_0d41ade6.pdf Production Document]</ref> With the exception of Simon Pegg, who returned as the voice of Buck, none of the actors in the spin-off reprised their roles.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|section|date=May 2022}}\nSome time after the events of [[Ice Age: Continental Drift|the fourth film]], Peaches is engaged with a good-natured mammoth named Julian, and they are about to marry, to Manny's disapproval, as he finds Julian annoying and incapable of protecting Peaches. This only increases when Peaches reveals her wish to move out after the marriage, traveling and exploring the world as their honeymoon, which Manny and even Ellie disagrees with, as the latter thought they could be neighbors for at the least the first few years. Diego and Shira want to start a family, but fear their children won't make any friends as the other kids are afraid of saber-toothed tigers. Sid is about to propose to his fake girlfriend, Francine, but he is dumped by her after Sid previously gave her a poison ivy [[lingerie]], and he laments his solitude. During Manny and Ellie's wedding anniversary party, asteroids (caused by Scrat, who was propelled into outer space earlier in an abandoned spaceship during an attempt to bury his acorn) strike the place and The Herd barely escape. Meanwhile, at [[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs|the underground lost world]], Buck returns a ''[[Chasmosaurus]]'' egg back to its mother after it was stolen by a trio of flying [[dromaeosaurs]] named Gavin, Gertie, and Roger. Buck discovers an ancient stone pillar and takes it to the surface, where he reunites with The Herd.\n\nBuck explains to them that according to the pillar, the asteroids had caused two extinctions of \"horseshoe crab-looking thingies\" and dinosaurs in the past and with the next one incoming, he believes that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones; a nearby volcano, as according to its engravings, they always fall in the same place. However, the dromaeosaurs overhear their conversation, and Gavin and Gertie decide to stop them, believing that they could easily avoid the impact due to their natural ability to fly, thus not only getting their revenge on Buck, but also eradicating Earth's population and securing domination over the planet for the dinosaurs once again. Roger is reluctant, but Gavin and Gertie strong-arm him into cooperating. \n\nDuring the Herd's journey to the crash site, Manny and Ellie try to manipulate Peaches to stay with them forever by making her think its her idea, but Peaches finds out and scolds them, while Buck discovers that the asteroids have electro-magnetic properties, theorizing that if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit, they could attract the main asteroid away from Earth, stopping it. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the dromaeosaurs, The Herd arrives at \"Geotopia\", a community of immortal animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago, where Sid meets Brooke, a female ground sloth who instantly falls in love with him.\n\nHowever, Shangri Llama, the leader of Geotopia, refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to use the city's crystals in order to stop the asteroid, as they are the key to the residents' longevity. After seeing how much sad Peaches is, thinking that their last chance of survival is gone, Manny and Ellie regret their actions. Sid inadvertently destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the crystals to present Brooke with, immediately aging them to their real ages and revealing their true crone-like appearances, much to Shangri Llama's anger.\n\nAfter Brooke convinces the other Geotopians that stopping the asteroid is more important than their lost youth, they and The Herd help with Buck's plan, which is to fill up a volcano with the gigantic ball made up of all the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away. The dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene, but they soon discover that they will not be able to survive the asteroid's impact and Buck convinces them to help and that the dinosaurs can live with them in harmony. After an small meteor hits Gavin, they accidentally drop the last and biggest crystal, but Manny and Julian manage to throw it back into the volcano using Julian's idea, causing him to finally earn Manny's approval. The volcano then violently erupts, sending the magnetic crystal shards to the sky and successfully diverts the oncoming asteroid plummeting back to space.\n\nThe Herd then departs back home, including Sid, who parts ways from Brooke, but just after they leave, a small crystal shard falls inside a hot spring, giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Granny, who stayed behind with them, [[Fountain of Youth|regain their youth]]. After The Herd returns, Manny and Ellie reconcile with Peaches, approving and encouraging her to chase her dreams. Peaches and Julian then celebrate their wedding afterwards while Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before, and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid, much to his delight.\n\nIn the epilogue, Neil deBuck Weasel (an animal version of [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] from Buck's mind) talks about the planet Mars, and how it served life like Earth in its earlier years. When Scrat sends the UFO impacting on the planet, it all turns red (becoming the Mars we know today). Scrat gets up and looks for a few seconds, but stops when he notices a dead iguana, which dissipates into ashes when he taps it with his foot. The film ends with the saber-toothed squirrel racing back to the spaceship, and flees for Earth just like nothing has happened.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Ice Age characters}}\n<!-- Main cast as identified in film credits and in credit order -->\n* [[Ray Romano]] as [[Manny (Ice Age)|Manny]], a [[woolly mammoth]] and the leader of The Herd<ref name=USATSquirrelMacy>{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Exclusive: 'Ice Age' squirrel to make Macy's debut|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/22/exclusive-ice-age-scrat-balloon-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/74366580/|access-date=October 29, 2015|work=USA Today|date=October 22, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]], a [[ground sloth]] and the founder of The Herd<ref name=USATSquirrelMacy />\n* [[Denis Leary]] as [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]], a [[Smilodon|saber tooth tiger]] and the co-leader of The Herd<ref name=USATSquirrelMacy />\n* [[Adam DeVine]] as [[List of Ice Age characters#Julian|Julian]], a woolly mammoth and Peaches's fianc\u00e9<ref name=USATBipolarLlama>{{cite news |last=Truitt |first=Brian |title=Jesse Tyler Ferguson is a limber llama in new 'Ice Age' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/11/05/jesse-tyler-ferguson-ice-age-collision-course-exclusive-character-reveal/75184240/ |access-date=November 5, 2015 |work=USA Today |date=November 5, 2015 |archive-date=September 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920142737/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/11/05/jesse-tyler-ferguson-ice-age-collision-course-exclusive-character-reveal/75184240/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Devine|first1=Adam|title=Look at me Mom I'm a walking talking Woolly Mammoth!

It was one of the first scenes put into production but also one of the last to exit production due to its time-consuming and difficult structure, as the team would only be able to produce three or four seconds of footage a week.\n\nThe recording session took place in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] since most of the actors live there while the studio is based in [[New York City]]. Director [[Michael Thurmeier]] and co-director Galen Tan Chu would take turns travelling to L.A. to head the recording sessions.<ref name=\"FR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.flickreel.com/ice-age-collision-course-interview-with-co-director-galen-t-chu/|title=ICE AGE: COLLISION COURSE INTERVIEW WITH CO-DIRECTOR GALEN T.

An acorn-shaped ship appears and pulls the acorn, with Scrat holding onto it. In the ship, three alien squirrels (A.K.A Scratzons) are surprised by finding Scrat, and blast him away from the acorn. Scrat tries to take it back with a tractor beam in a nearby saucer, but the alien leader pulls it back with another tractor beam. Being pulled to both sides, the nutrogen inside the acorn snaps, creating a massive explosion, which destroys the ship and creates a [[black hole]] sucking everything nearby into it. Scrat jumps out of the saucer, knocks the Scratazon alien leader into the black hole while trying to save the acorn, but gets pulled in the hole nonetheless. He emerges in space along with the acorn, only for the black hole appearing again, snatching the acorn and leaving Scrat alone again. The short ends with the latter screaming in frustration.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Ice Age: Collision Course'' grossed $64 million in North America and $344 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $408.5 million, against a production budget of $105 million.<ref name=BOM /> In terms of total earnings, its biggest markets outside of North America were China ($66 million) (with the country being also its largest territory overall), France ($26.3 million), Brazil ($25 million), Germany ($24.7 million) and Mexico ($22.2 million).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=iceage5.htm|title= Ice Age: Collision Course (2016) - International Box Office Results|access-date= November 29, 2016|work= [[Box Office Mojo]]|archive-date= November 22, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161122081754/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=iceage5.htm|url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada ''Ice Age: Collision Course'' opened on July 22, 2016, alongside ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' and ''[[Lights Out (2016 film)|Lights Out]]'', and was projected to gross $30\u201335 million from 3,997 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref name=\"DEADproj\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/07/star-trek-beyond-ghostbusters-lights-out-box-office-comic-con-1201788846/|title='Star Trek Beyond' To Blast Off Fueled By Comic-Con World Premiere \u2013 Box Office Preview|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=July 19, 2016|access-date=July 21, 2016|archive-date=July 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720163355/https://deadline.com/2016/07/star-trek-beyond-ghostbusters-lights-out-box-office-comic-con-1201788846/|url-status=live}}</ref> It made $850,000 from Thursday night previews and $7.8 million on its first day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/box-office-star-trek-beyond-ice-age-lights-out-1201820167/|title=Box Office: 'Star Trek Beyond' Blasts Off With $5.5 Million on Thursday|first=Dave|last=McNarry|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 22, 2016|access-date=July 22, 2016|archive-date=July 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723160546/http://variety.com/2016/film/news/box-office-star-trek-beyond-ice-age-lights-out-1201820167/|url-status=live}}</ref> It had a $21 million debut in its opening weekend, finishing fourth at the box office.
