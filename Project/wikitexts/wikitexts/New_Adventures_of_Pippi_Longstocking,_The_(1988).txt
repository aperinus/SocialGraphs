It is a Swedish-German-American<ref name=\"BFI\"/> joint venture produced by [[Columbia Pictures]], Longstocking Productions, and [[SF Studios|Svensk Filmindustri]]. While the title suggests a continuation of previous entries, it is in fact a remake of the original story.\n\nFilmed in [[Fernandina Beach]] on [[Amelia Island]] and at soundstages in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], the film premiered on March 8, 1988 in [[Tokyo]], before it was released on July 29 in the United States and September 9 in Sweden. It received negative reviews upon release<ref name=\"Jacksonville\"/> and became a financial failure. It was Annakin's final completed film before his death on April 22, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\n[[Pippi Longstocking]], who travels on the ship ''Hoptoad'' with her sailor father, Efraim, encounters a sudden storm caused by a volcanic eruption. After Efraim disappears into the sea, Pippi travels to the small coastal town of Rocksby, accompanied by her horse, Alfonso, and monkey, [[Mr. Nilsson]]. She takes up residence in her father's home, [[Villa Villekulla]], which the neighborhood children believe is haunted.\n\nSoon Tommy and Annika Settigren venture into it after seeing lights in the windows. Looking for ghosts, they meet Pippi, Mr. Nilsson, and Alfonso instead. They become friends and get into various adventures together such as making pancakes, cleaning the floor with scrubbing shoes, serving ice cream to residents of the local children's home, riding a motorcycle, and dodging \"splunks\". Pippi must also fight off Mr. Blackhart and his henchmen, Rype and Rancid, who want to demolish her house and sell the property, as well as avoid being legally taken to the children's home by the owner, Miss Bannister. She agrees to escape and flee with Tommy and Annika in a homemade [[autogyro]] to avoid this fate. However, they are rescued after nearly going over a waterfall while riding in barrels down a river.\n\nThinking that Pippi will hurt Tommy and Annika, Mr. and Mrs. Settigren refuse to let them play with her anymore. Pippi believes that they would be better off without her and goes to the children's home. As a result, she is forced to leave Mr. Nilsson and Alfonso behind. She is unable to fit in with the other orphans due to her lack of discipline and education. However, after she rescues the children's home from a fire accidentally started by the janitor and is lauded by the townsfolk as a heroine, she is allowed to return home and play with Tommy and Annika again.\n\nShe is reunited with Efraim on [[Christmas Day]], and he offers her the chance to become a cannibal princess of the uncharted island he had washed ashore on and was crowned king. She agrees and everyone comes out to bid her a tearful farewell. Just as they prepare to sail off, she decides to stay after seeing that everyone is sad to see her go. She explains to Efraim that she can't leave Tommy and Annika. He understands and tells her that he loves her. As Efraim sails off he tells Pippi that if she needs anything she knows where to find him. They say goodbye and she goes home with Tommy, Annika, Mr. Nilsson, and Alfonso.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tami Erin]] as Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Efraim's Daughter \"Pippi\" Longstocking, a spunky eleven-year-old girl who arrives on land after her father is lost at sea.

Because for American children, he told me, there\u2019s only violence to watch and listen to and they needed to get used to seeing someone who was kind - and that\u2019s why it had to be Pippi. And then I thought to myself, well if I can help combat the misery of violence in America then so be it.
