It is the third to star [[Roger Moore]] as the fictional secret agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]. The film co-stars [[Barbara Bach]] and [[Curt J\u00fcrgens]] and was directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]]. The screenplay was by [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] and [[Richard Maibaum]], with an uncredited rewrite by [[Tom Mankiewicz]].\n\nThe film takes its title from [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1962 novel ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', the tenth book in the [[List of James Bond novels and stories|James Bond series]], though it does not contain any elements of the novel's plot. The storyline involves a reclusive megalomaniac named [[Karl Stromberg]], who plans to destroy the world and create a new civilisation under the sea. Bond teams up with a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agent, [[Anya Amasova]], to stop the plans, all while being hunted by Stromberg\u2019s powerful henchman, [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]].\n\nIt was shot on location in [[Egypt]] ([[Cairo]] and [[Luxor]]) and [[Italy]] ([[Costa Smeralda]], [[Sardinia]]), with underwater scenes filmed at [[the Bahamas]] ([[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]), and a [[007 Stage|new soundstage]] built at [[Pinewood Studios]] for a massive set which depicted the interior of a [[supertanker]]. ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was well received by critics, who saw the film as a return to form for the franchise and praised Moore's performance. Moore himself called the film his personal favourite of his tenure as Bond.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Roger|last2=Owens|first2=Gareth|title=My Word is My Bond: A Memoir|year=2008|location=New York|publisher=[[HarperCollins|Collins]]|page=212|isbn=978-0-06-1673887}}</ref> The soundtrack composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] also met with success. The film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] amid many other nominations and novelised in 1977 by Christopher Wood as ''[[James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Royal Navy|British]] and a [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]] [[Ballistic Missile Submarine|ballistic-missile submarine]] suddenly disappear. James Bond{{snd}}[[MI6]] agent 007{{snd}}is summoned to investigate. On the way to his briefing, Bond escapes an ambush by a squad of Soviet agents in [[Austria]], killing one during a downhill ski chase and evading the others. The plans for a highly advanced submarine tracking system are being offered in [[Egypt]]. There, Bond encounters Major Anya Amasova \u2013 [[KGB]] agent Triple X \u2013 as a rival for the [[microfilm]] plans. They travel across Egypt together, encountering [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]]{{snd}}a tall assassin with razor-sharp steel teeth{{snd}}along the way. Bond and Amasova reluctantly join forces after a truce is agreed by their respective British and Soviet superiors. They uncover evidence linking the plans to shipping tycoon and scientist Karl Stromberg.\n\nWhile travelling by train to Stromberg's base in [[Sardinia]], Bond saves Amasova from Jaws, and their cooling rivalry turns to affection. Posing as a [[oceanography|marine biologist]] and his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover that he had launched a mysterious new supertanker, the ''Liparus'', nine months previously. As they leave the base, a henchman on a motorcycle featuring a rocket sidecar, Jaws in a car, and Naomi, an assistant/pilot of Stromberg in an attack helicopter, chase them, but Bond and Amasova escape underwater when his car \u2013 a [[Lotus Esprit]] from [[Q Branch]] \u2013 converts into a submarine. Jaws survives a car crash, and Naomi is killed when Bond fires a sea-air missile from his car which destroys her helicopter. While examining Stromberg's underwater ''Atlantis'' base, the pair confirms that he is operating the submarine tracking system and evade an attack by a group of Stromberg's minisubs. Back on land, Bond finds out that the ''Liparus'' has never visited any known port or harbour. Amasova discovers that Bond killed her lover Sergei Barsov (as shown at the beginning of the movie), and she vows to kill Bond as soon as their mission is complete.\n\n[[File:Strongberglair.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Stromberg's hideout, ''Atlantis'']]\nBond and Amasova board an [[SSN (hull classification symbol)|American submarine]] to examine the ''Liparus'', but the submarine is captured by the tanker, which is revealed to be a floating submarine dock. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the simultaneous launching of nuclear missiles from the captured British and Soviet submarines to obliterate Moscow and New York City. This would trigger [[World War III|a global nuclear war]], which Stromberg would survive in ''Atlantis'', and subsequently a new civilization would be established underwater. He leaves for ''Atlantis'' with Amasova, but Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian, and American sailors. They battle the ''Liparus'' crew and eventually breach the control room, only to learn from the dying captain of the ''Liparus'' that the commandeered British and Soviet submarines are primed to fire their missiles in only a few minutes. Bond tricks the submarines into firing the nukes at each other, destroying the subs and Stromberg's crews. The victorious submariners escape the sinking ''Liparus'' on the American submarine.\n\nThe submarine is ordered by the Pentagon to destroy ''Atlantis'' but Bond insists on rescuing Amasova first. He confronts and kills Stromberg but again encounters Jaws, whom he drops into a shark tank. However, Jaws kills the [[tiger shark]] and escapes. Bond and Amasova flee in an escape pod as ''Atlantis'' is sunk by torpedoes. Amasova picks up Bond's gun and points it at him, but then chooses not to kill him and the two embrace. The Royal Navy recovers the pod and the two spies are seen in an intimate embrace through its port window, to the astonishment of their superiors on the ship.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], British MI6 agent 007, assigned to investigate the theft of two submarines.\n* [[Barbara Bach]] as [[Anya Amasova]], a Soviet [[KGB]] agent XXX, also investigating the theft.

Saltzman had branched out into several other ventures of dubious promise, including an unfilmed biopic about [[Cuthbert Grant]] starring Sean Connery, and consequently was struggling through personal financial reversals unrelated to Bond. Saltzman offered his shares in the company as collateral for his loans, and [[UBS]] attempted to [[Foreclosure|foreclose]] on them. When Saltzman's attempted [[hostile takeover]] of [[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]] led to a lawsuit, Broccoli refused to allow him to use Danjaq funds, leading to a deadlock in the company as Saltzman refused to allow another Bond film to go forward.{{sfn|Field|Chowdhury|2015|p=280\u2013281}} This was exacerbated by the twin personal tragedies of his wife's terminal cancer and many of the symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] in himself.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Harry Saltzman, Showman |type=Documentary bonus feature |format=DVD |publisher=MGM Home Entertainment |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqQwGaCY8io |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101194504/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqQwGaCY8io |archive-date=November 1, 2020 |via=[[YouTube]] |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUnder Danjaq's distribution agreement with United Artists, it was required they produce a Bond adaptation every eighteen months or run the risk of losing the rights to the series to United Artists if they did not.{{sfn|Field|Chowdhury|2015|pp=281\u2013282}} However, Saltzman continued blocking production on another Bond film and refused to allow Broccoli to buy his shares. [[Maurice Binder]] and Broccoli held negotiations about selling Saltzman's shares to [[Adnan Khashoggi]], [[David Frost]], [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|Lord Hanson]], and [[David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech|Lord Harlech]]. Saltzman finally agreed to sell his shares directly to United Artists so that another Bond film could go forward. Although Broccoli initially objected to the deal, he acquiesced after Saltzman received a counter-offer to sell his rights to the rival studio [[Columbia Pictures]].{{sfn|Field|Chowdhury|2015|pp=282\u2013283}}\n\nAnother troubling aspect of the production was the difficulty in obtaining a director. [[Guy Hamilton]], who had directed the previous three Bond films as well as ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964), was initially set to direct. However, in November 1975, he left after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'',{{sfn|Field|Chowdhury|2015|p=292}} although [[Richard Donner]] subsequently took over the project.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete James Bond Movie Encyclopedia|first=Steven Jay|last=Rubin|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-07-141246-9|page=392}}</ref> [[Steven Spielberg]], who had finished ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) months earlier, approached Broccoli about wanting to direct the next Bond film, but Broccoli declined his offer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/i-spy-25-fascinating-bond-facts-1-5097132|title=I spy...25 fascinating Bond facts|date=6 November 2012|website=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-date=25 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325105724/https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/i-spy-25-fascinating-bond-facts-1-5097132|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|website=[[The Independent]]|title=Steven Spielberg reveals he was rejected as Bond director twice|first=Jacob|last=Stolworthy|date=18 July 2016|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/steven-spielberg-james-bond-the-bfg-moonraker-broccoli-007-jaws-close-encounters-a7142731.html|access-date=24 March 2018|archive-date=25 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325045857/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/steven-spielberg-james-bond-the-bfg-moonraker-broccoli-007-jaws-close-encounters-a7142731.html|url-status=live}}</ref> By December of that year, Broccoli hired [[Lewis Gilbert]], who had directed the earlier Bond film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967), after screening his then-latest film, ''[[Operation Daybreak]]'' (1975).{{sfn|Field|Chowdhury|2015|p=295}}\n\nSince [[Ian Fleming]] permitted Eon to use only the name of his novel but not the actual plot,<ref name=Aldis-2020/> Fleming's name was moved for the first time from above the film's title to above \"James Bond 007\". His name reverted to the traditional location for ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', the last Eon Bond film based on a Fleming novel before 2006's ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. However, the credit style first used in ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' has been used on all Eon Bond films since ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', including ''Casino Royale''.\n\n===Writing===\nBroccoli commissioned a number of writers to work on the script, including [[Stirling Silliphant]], [[John Landis]], [[Ronald Hardy]], [[Anthony Burgess]],<ref name=\"Burgess2014\">{{cite book |last=Burgess |first=Anthony |title=You've Had Your Time |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AvZAgAAQBAJ |year=2014 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1-4735-1239-9 |page=313 |access-date=12 October 2018 |archive-date=9 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200609100824/https://books.google.com/books?id=9AvZAgAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Cary Bates]],{{sfn|Field|Chowdhury|2015|p=292}} and [[Derek Marlowe]].

Gilbert also decided to fix what he felt the previous Roger Moore films were doing wrong, which was writing the Bond character too much the way [[Sean Connery]] played him, and instead portray Bond closer to the books{{snd}}\"very English, very smooth, good sense of humour\". Broccoli asked Wood to create a villain with metal teeth, Jaws, inspired by a brace-wearing henchman named Horror in Fleming's novel.<ref name=inside/>\n\nBroccoli agreed to Wood's proposed changes, but before he could set to work there were more legal complications. In the years since ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965), [[Kevin McClory]] had set up two film companies and had been cleared to produce a rival Bond film after the imposed ten-year moratorium had expired. He was in development of a film project, with the working title ''Warhead'', in collaboration with [[Sean Connery]] and novelist [[Len Deighton]]. McClory had learned of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film ''Thunderball'', back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s.

He drove a prototype [[Lotus Esprit]] with all Lotus branding taped over, and parked it outside the Eon offices at Pinewood studios; on seeing the car, Eon asked Lotus to borrow both of the prototypes for filming. Initial filming of the car chase sequence resulted in disappointing action sequences.

It had two 10-inch [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]] wheels on each side, a [[Suzuki GT series#GT185|Suzuki 185]] engine, and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer-type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch.

To create the illusion of the car becoming a submarine, seven different models were used, one for each step of the transformation. One of the models was [[Wet Nellie|a fully mobile submarine]] equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon, whilst the first underwater shot of the car was a miniature model filmed in a test tank. Three full-size bodyshells were used to depict the actual car-to-submersible transition.

Broccoli, he gave permission only for the title ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' to be used. Since the screenplay for the film had nothing to do with Fleming's original novel, Eon Productions, for the first time, authorised a [[novelisation]] based upon the script. This would also be the first regular Bond novel published since ''[[Colonel Sun]]'' nearly a decade earlier. [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], who co-authored the screenplay, was commissioned to write the book titled ''James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me''.\n\nThe novelisation and the screenplay, although both written by Wood, are somewhat different. In the novelisation, SMERSH is still active and after James Bond. Their role begins during the pre-title. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for the whereabouts of the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts with a number of Bond stories, including the film ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (1987), in which General Leonid Pushkin remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH is said to have been put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the novelisation include Amasova and her lover Sergei Barsov as well as Colonel-General Nikitin, a character from Fleming's novel ''[[From Russia, with Love (novel)|From Russia, with Love]]'' who has since become the head of SMERSH. In the book, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips into the tank, as opposed to the film where Bond releases Jaws into the water.<ref>{{cite book | author = Wood, Christopher | year = 1977 | title = James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me | publisher = Glidrose Publications | isbn = 0-446-84544-2| quote =Now both hands were tearing at the magnet, and Jaws twisted furiously like a fish on the hook. As Bond watched in fascinated horror, a relentless triangle streaked up behind the stricken giant. A huge gray force launched itself through the wild water, and two rows of white teeth closed around the threshing flesh. }}</ref>\n\nThere are also a number of elements that are either underplayed for more plausibility (the Lotus does not have any gadgets on land, unlike the film version) or are expanded to give more background to the characters (Jaws has a full history, Nikitin is in lust with Amasova, Stromberg\u2019s name is Sigmond and is tall, bald and has a small fleshy growth on one finger - unlike the webbed fingered Karl Stromberg of the film).\nNeither the characters of Q or Miss Moneypenny appear in the novelisation.\nThe henchmen who falls off the roof in Cairo is killed when he lands on top of a piano, a death Wood reused in the script for his next Bond film, ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''.\n\n==Sale of props==\nThe [[Lotus Esprit]], also known as [[Wet Nellie]], capable of transforming from car to submarine in the film, was purchased for \u00a3616,000 at a [[London]] auction in October 2013 by [[Elon Musk]], who planned to rebuild the vehicle and attempt to make the fictional dual-purpose car be an actual dual-purpose car (underwater and on land).<ref name=tg20131018>{{cite news|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|title=Tesla founder Elon Musk buys James Bond's Lotus Esprit submarine car|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/tesla-elon-musk-james-bond-lotus-submarine-car|access-date=26 October 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 October 2013|archive-date=24 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024062814/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/18/tesla-elon-musk-james-bond-lotus-submarine-car|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* ''[[James Bond 007: Nightfire]]'', a 2002 video game featuring the'' Liparus'' and ''Atlantis'' settings from this film, which also includes a [[Aston Martin Vanquish|submarine-car]] not unlike the Lotus Esprit.\n* \"[[Our Man Bashir]]\", a 1995 episode of the television series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' was largely based on this film.\n* [[Outline of James Bond]]\n* [[Rinspeed sQuba]], a submersible car inspired by the film.<ref name=\"rinspeed sQuba\">{{cite web | author=Nidhi Goyal | url=http://www.industrytap.com/worlds-first-underwater-car-cruises-at-75-mph-on-land-1-9-mph-underwater/17549 | title=World's First Underwater Car Cruises at 75 MPH on Land and 1.9 MPH Underwater | publisher=Industry Tap | date=30 December 2013 | access-date=27 January 2014 | archive-date=2 February 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202100831/http://www.industrytap.com/worlds-first-underwater-car-cruises-at-75-mph-on-land-1-9-mph-underwater/17549 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Wet Nellie]] \u2013 a custom-built [[submarine]] created for the movie in the shape of a [[Lotus Esprit]] S1 sports car.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{Cite book|last1=Field|first1=Matthew|last2=Chowdhury|first2=Ajay|title=Some Kind of Hero: The Remarkable Story of the James Bond Films|year=2015|isbn=978-0-7509-6421-0|publisher=[[The History Press]]|oclc=930556527}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0076752|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|24269|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{Amg movie|46311|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{Mojo title|spywholovedme|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|spy_who_loved_me|The Spy Who Loved Me}}\n* {{AFI film|56112}}\n\n{{James Bond films}}\n{{Lewis Gilbert}}\n{{Stanley Kubrick}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spy Who Loved Me, The}}\n[[Category:The Spy Who Loved Me (film)| ]]\n[[Category:1970s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:1970s spy films]]\n[[Category:1977 films]]\n[[Category:British sequel films]]\n[[Category:Cold War spy films]]\n[[Category:Cold War submarine films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons]]\n[[Category:British films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lewis Gilbert]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Albert R.
