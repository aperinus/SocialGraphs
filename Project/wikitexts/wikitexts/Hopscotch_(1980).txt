Landau]], directed by [[Ronald Neame]], that stars [[Walter Matthau]], [[Glenda Jackson]], [[Sam Waterston]], [[Ned Beatty]], and [[Herbert Lom]]. The screenplay was written by [[Bryan Forbes]] and [[Brian Garfield]], based on Garfield's 1975 [[Hopscotch (Brian Garfield novel)|novel of the same name]].\n\nFormer [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] field officer Miles Kendig is intent on publishing an explosive memoir that will also expose the dirty tricks of Myerson, his obnoxious, incompetent, and profane former boss. Myerson and Kendig's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Joe Cutter are repeatedly foiled in their attempts to capture the former agent and stop the publication of his memoir. He cleverly stays one step ahead of his pursuers as the chase hopscotches around America and Western Europe.\n\nGarfield took the name of his book from the children\u2019s game, \u201cwherein a player has to retrieve \u2018an elusive object' while hopping on a sidewalk from space to space.

Upon Kendig's return to Washington, his boss, Myerson (Beatty), reassigns him to a desk job because Kendig did not arrest Yaskov (Lom), the head of the [[KGB]] in Europe. Kendig explains to Myerson that he knows how Yaskov thinks, and it would take time and resources to identify and learn about a new replacement. Kendig's good friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Joe Cutter (Waterston), is nevertheless assigned to take over his mentor's old job.\n\nInstead of accepting this situation, Kendig takes action. He shreds his personnel file and flies to [[Salzburg]] to visit former lover Isobel von Sch\u00f6nenberg (Jackson), whom he has not seen in a while. Yaskov, guessing what has happened, meets Kendig and invites him to defect to the KGB; when Kendig refuses, Yaskov asks sarcastically if Kendig will be retiring and writing his memoirs.\n\nOn the spot, Kendig decides to do exactly that: write and publish a memoir exposing the dirty tricks and general incompetence of Myerson's CIA. Isobel is horrified, saying that Myerson will send agents to kill him. She nevertheless helps by mailing copies of Kendig's first chapter to spy chiefs in the U.S., Soviet Union, China, France, Italy, and Great Britain. Myerson assigns Cutter to stop Kendig, and Yaskov, not wanting his own agency's follies exposed, also pursues his old adversary.\n\nKendig baits his pursuers by sending them explosive chapters and by periodically informing them of his location. Leaving Europe, he returns to the U.S., cheerfully renting Myerson's own unoccupied [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] family home, where he writes more chapters. After purposely leaking his address, Kendig maneuvers the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] (which has jurisdiction) into shooting up Myerson's home with both bullets and tear gas, to Myerson's great dismay.\n\nKendig flies to Bermuda by chartered seaplane, then on to [[London]] to present his publisher with the final chapter. Yaskov informs Cutter that one of his agents has spotted Kendig in London by chance. Kendig purchases a vintage biplane\u2014a [[Stampe et Vertongen|Stampe]] version of the [[de Havilland Tiger Moth|Tiger Moth]]\u2014and hires an engineer to custom-modify it for a specific task. Myerson meets Kendig's publisher, who rebuffs his threatening bluster and then tells them where Kendig's hotel room is. At the vacated room, all the pursuers read copies of the final chapter he has left for them.\n\nKendig later ambushes Cutter in his hotel room, ties him up, gags him, and informs Cutter that he will be flying across the [[English Channel]] from a small airfield near Beachy Head. Meanwhile, Isobel gives her CIA minders the slip, and crosses the Channel by hovercraft to rendezvous early the next morning with Kendig. While everyone converges on the airfield, Kendig suffers a flat tire on his way and is taken by the local police to their station. When a policeman recognizes him from a posted fugitive bulletin, Kendig escapes by short-circuiting an electrical socket and stealing a police car.\n\nKendig reaches the airfield, and the Americans and Yaskov arrive by helicopter soon after. Kendig's biplane takes off (by remote control) and is pursued by Myerson in the helicopter. Kendig's biplane evades Myerson's gunfire for a while, but the plane finally appears to be hit and suddenly explodes over the Channel, when in fact it was deliberately destroyed by Kendig with his remote control console. Myerson and his CIA team assume that Kendig is finally dead. Cutter, however, remarks wryly that he \"better stay dead\". Meanwhile, Kendig sneaks away from a deteriorating building on the edge of the airfield, using a barrel of spent oil to dispose of the remote control he had used to fly and destroy the biplane. He and Isobel set out for a few weeks stay in the south of France.\n\nMonths later, Kendig's explosive memoir (also titled ''Hopscotch'') has become an international bestseller. Disguised as a [[Sikh]], Kendig begins to chat in a British accent with a local bookstore clerk. He purchases a copy of his own book, much to Isobel's complete exasperation with his antics and \"ridiculous disguises\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Walter Matthau]] as Miles Kendig\n*[[Glenda Jackson]] as Isobel von Sch\u00f6nenberg\n*[[Sam Waterston]] as Joe Cutter\n*[[Ned Beatty]] as G.P.

Notable examples include the aria \"[[Non pi\u00f9 andrai]]\" from the opera [[The Marriage of Figaro]], the andante movement from [[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]], the first movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata No.11, K331 (best known for the third movement, the [[Rondo alla turca]]), the [[Serenade No. 9 (Mozart)|Posthorn Serenade, K320]] and a [[Rondo for Piano and Orchestra in D major (Mozart)|Rondo for piano and orchestra in D, K382]]. In the Hopscotch - Criterion Collection DVD special feature \"Introduction by Neame & Garfield\", director Neame stated that Matthau's agent made the suggestion that they put in some Mozart because this would greatly please Matthau. As they looked into this, they realized that it would enhance the movie if Kendig loved Mozart. Ian Fraser was the arranger and found many sections of Mozart that fit the movie, but they could not find anything to go with Kendig typing. They asked Matthau; he brought in some Mozart that went perfectly with it.\n\n[[Hermann Prey]]'s singing of \"Non pi\u00f9 andrai\" highlights the antics of the old biplane as Myerson is shooting at it. The song tells how the young Cherubino, going into the army, will no longer be a dainty favorite, just as 5-foot-7 Myerson is going to lose his power at the CIA. Also, the song describes bullets flying and even bombs exploding.\n\nThere is also the aria \"[[Largo al Factotum]]\" from the opera [[The Barber of Seville]] by [[Gioachino Rossini]]. Matthau sings this as he passes a border checkpoint. The words to the aria explain how everyone is looking for the barber, and he moves fast like lightning.\n\nKendig has the aria \"[[Un bel d\u00ec, vedremo]]\" (\"One fine day we'll see\") from [[Madame Butterfly]] by [[Giacomo Puccini]] playing loudly on the stereo as the FBI and CIA shoot up Myerson's wife's house. The operatic contrapunto adds a surreal air of ironic justice to the events as Madame Butterfly sings how she will hide from her husband.\n\nThe credits also list \"Once a Night\" written by [[Jackie English]] and [[Beverly Bremers]]. This is the blaring song playing at the bar \"The Other End\" where Matthau goes to arrange his flight from Georgia. \"Once a Night\" would peak at No. 94 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 43 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicvf.com/Jackie+English.art|title=Jackie English - Top Chart Singles|website=musicvf.com|accessdate=August 4, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to Neame in the special feature \"Introduction by Neame & Garfield\", the Jewish Matthau refused to film on location in Germany, as he had lost many relatives in [[the Holocaust]]. However, he wanted to have Neame cast his son David and later his stepdaughter Lucy Saroyan, so Matthau gave in. David Matthau played Ross, the CIA agent Kendig takes prisoner after leaving Myerson's house, and Saroyan the pilot who takes Kendig to Bermuda.\n\nAccording to Neame, he did not think they could get Glenda Jackson, but she and Matthau had previously worked together in the 1978 film ''[[House Calls (1978 film)|House Calls]]'', and she was delighted with the prospect of reteaming with him.\n\n===Filming===\n''Hopscotch'' was filmed in many locations in Europe and the United States, including [[London]], United Kingdom; [[Marseille]]s, France<!-- Marseiles, with an s, in English, Marseille in French. -->; [[Bermuda]]; [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]].; Savannah, Georgia; Atlanta, Georgia;  and [[Munich]], in then-[[West Germany]].\n\nLocations in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], included [[Mirabell Palace|The Mirabell Platz]]. The scenes set during [[Munich|Munich\u2019s]] [[Oktoberfest]] were filmed using eight cameras concealed in strategic locations at the [[Theresienwiese|Munich Fairgrounds]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/56438-HOPSCOTCH?sid=d51fbd14-6418-45ca-8428-9133929f2363&sr=10.472283&cp=1&pos=0|access-date=2020-06-21|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\n===Financing===\nIFI and the Landaus raised money from cinema chains, which later caused problems with distribution for the film. IFI wanted [[Goldcrest Films]] to invest, as they had on ''The Howling'' and ''Escape from New York'' but [[David Puttnam]] persuaded the Goldcrest board otherwise. The film earned $20 million, including $9 million in rentals. Avco-Embassy executive [[Jake Eberts]] claimed IFI did not make money on the film.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My indecision is final|first1=Jake|last1= Eberts |first2=Terry|last2=Illott|year=1990 |pages=60\u201361|publisher=Faber and Faber}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between novel and film==\nGarfield's original script reflected the dark tone of the novel. At one point, Warren Beatty and Jane Fonda were in line for the leads.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMatthau agreed to appear on condition that Garfield rework the script to play to his own gifts as an actor. Matthau and Neame participated in the rewrites, which continued throughout the film. The [[AFI Catalog of Feature Films|AFI catalog]] refers to a ''[[The Hollywood Reporter|Hollywood Reporter]]'' article describing two of Matthau's significant contributions: the ending, in which Kendig disguises himself as a [[Sikhs|Sikh]] in order to visit a bookshop, and the scene in a [[Salzburg]]  restaurant where Kendig and Isobel, apparently strangers, strike up a conversation about wine that reveals more and more about them and ends in a passionate kiss. The original scene relied on a great deal of exposition to bring the audience up to date. Neame said that Matthau contributed so much to the final film that he could have asked for credit, but that was never pursued.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe endings are very different. In the novel, Kendig fakes his own death using a body recovered from a Paris street and includes all copies of his manuscript, ensuring it will never be published. In the film, his escape airplane explodes in mid-air just as it heads over the English Channel and no body is recovered. His expos\u00e9 is published and is a great success. Both works include a knowing nod from Cutter indicating that he is sure that Kendig is alive but hopes that he will stay dead. The character of Isobel, Kendig's old flame, provides a romantic interest in the film. In the novel, his feelings for a hired pilot, prove to him that he will find a new life outside the world of spycraft.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic [[Vincent Canby]]  gave the film a rave review: \"a lark, a comic cloak-and-dagger adventure ... a stylish, lighter-than-air vehicle that moves from Munich to Salzburg to Washington to the Deep South to Europe and back without once losing its breath. It is beautifully played by Mr. Matthau and Miss Jackson and by a supporting cast ... directed by Ronald Neame and scored largely by Mozart. My only reservation is that Miss Jackson isn't on the screen enough\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|author-link=Vincent Canby|date=September 26, 1980|title='Hopscotch' Stars Jackson-Matthau Team|language=en-US|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/09/26/archives/hopscotch-stars-jacksonmatthau-team.html|access-date=2020-06-21|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of its release, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] described the film as \"a picaresque comedy disguised as a thriller\". \"A shaggy-dog thriller that never really thrills us very much, but leaves a nice feeling when it's over ... partly because of the way Walter Matthau fools around with dialogue ... and partly because the movie's shot at a measured, civilized, whimsical pace.

As the movie walks a fine line between serious drama and satirical comedy, and between topicality and escapism, it beguiles the viewer with its sophistication and complexity. The most surprising aspect of ''Hopscotch'', however, may not be how well it walks that tightrope, but that its makers accomplished this balancing act in an era that saw the spy movie genre reduced to tales of relentless despair\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Eder|first=Bruce|title=Hopscotch|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/215-hopscotch|access-date=2020-06-21|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film opened on 465 screens and grossed $2,552,864 in its opening weekend, debuting at number one at the US box office.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title='Hopscotch,' 'People' Lead Week's Pack of B.O.
