He receives his meals from a young thrall boy, who seems to sympathise with him. After dreaming of finding an arrowhead in a pool, One-Eye actually finds it when bathing. Using the arrowhead, he breaks free, kills the chieftain and his entourage and impales the chieftain's head on a [[nithing pole]]. As he sets out across the land, he realizes that the boy is following him. 'One-Eye' takes him in and has a vision of them travelling on a ship.\n\nThey reach a small group of [[Christians|Christian]] [[Norsemen]] who are persecuting the heathens of [[Scandinavian Scotland]]. The leader of the group asks the boy about the man's origins and he answers that One-Eye came from [[Helheim|Hel]]. 'One-Eye' and the boy agree to sail with them to the [[Holy Land]] on a [[Crusade]]. The expedition soon encounters thick fog and gets lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. After many days, with supplies dwindling, land is sighted.\n\nSailing up a river, they are attacked by ''[[Skr\u00e6ling]]s'' armed with stone arrowheads. The party realises they are nowhere near the Holy Land. Their leader, a Christian zealot, nevertheless advocates conquering the locals and claiming the land in the name of [[God in Christianity|God]]. 'One-Eye' has a vision of him building a [[cairn]]. Some of the group members angrily blame 'One-Eye' for their predicament and attack him; he kills them in self-defence. 'One-Eye' and the boy then leave and walk into the forest, followed by the group's second in command who has been stabbed by the leader for choosing to follow them. The leader's son then arrives to follow, as the leader stays behind to be killed by arrows. As the remainder of the group reaches the peak of a mountain, the son asks 'One-Eye' why he had to go through the horrible journey, but receives no answer. The leader's son decides to go back to his father, and the second in command is left on the mountain. Their eventual fate is unknown.\n\n'One-Eye' and the boy eventually reach the coastline and are met by over a dozen clay-covered warriors. 'One-Eye' regards them knowingly, having seen them in a vision. He silently bids the boy goodbye, then walks into the middle of the tribesmen. He drops his axe and his knife and closes his eye. One warrior fells him with one blow to the back of the head, and the others finish him off. 'One-Eye's' spirit walks into the estuary next to his cairn and disappears below the surface. On the beach, the remaining tribe members quietly withdraw back into the forest, leaving the boy looking out at the ocean. The sky darkens, becoming that of the misty Highlands of the beginning of the film, and 'One-Eye's' face appears in the clouds.\n[[File:Clanranald Trust for Scotland Walhalla Rising1.jpg|220px|thumb|Scene with Mads Mikkelsen and Maarten Stevenson]]\n\n==Cast==\nNicolas Winding Refn deliberately did not give formal names to the film's characters, save for One-Eye, although it is not the character's real name but a moniker given by The Boy.
