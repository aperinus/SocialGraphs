The film stars [[Jane Levy]], [[Dylan Minnette]], [[Daniel Zovatto]] and [[Stephen Lang]], and focuses on three friends who get trapped inside a blind man's house while breaking into it. The film was produced by [[Ghost House Pictures]] and [[Good Universe]] and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]].\n\nIn contrast to his previous work on ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'', director \u00c1lvarez decided the project would have less blood, an original storyline, more suspense, and no dependence on supernatural elements\u2014which he felt were overused. The project, originally titled ''A Man in the Dark'', was later announced in early 2014, with \u00c1lvarez directing, Sayagues writing, Raimi and Tapert producing, and Levy starring. [[Principal photography]]\u00a0began on June 29, 2015, and wrapped in July 2015 in [[Detroit]].\n\n''Don't Breathe'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 12, 2016, and was theatrically released on August 26, 2016, by [[Screen Gems]] and [[Stage 6 Films]]. The film grossed over $157 million and received largely positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, direction, screenplay, and tense atmosphere. [[Don't Breathe 2|A sequel]] was released on August 13, 2021, with Lang reprising his role.\n\n== Plot ==\nRocky, Alex, and Money are three Detroit delinquents who make a living by breaking into houses and stealing valuables. Rocky longs to move to California with her younger sister, Diddy, and escape from their abusive mother and her alcoholic boyfriend. To the trio's frustration, their [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] keeps undervaluing the items they bring. Money receives a tip from their fence that [[Gulf War]] veteran Norman Nordstrom has $300,000 in cash in his house in an abandoned Detroit neighborhood. The cash was reportedly a settlement after a wealthy young woman, Cindy Roberts, killed Norman's daughter in a car accident. The three spy on the house and learn that Norman is blind.\n\nAt night, the gang approach the house, drug Nordstrom's [[rottweiler]] dog, then break in. Money puts a [[sleeping gas]] bottle in Nordstrom's bedroom. Seeing a locked basement door, Money assumes the loot is hidden in there and shoots the lock. The noise wakes up Nordstrom, who overpowers Money, takes the gun, and kills him while Rocky silently watches. Rocky witnesses Nordstrom open a hidden safe to check his valuables. After he leaves, she opens the safe and takes the cash. However, Nordstrom finds Rocky and Alex's shoes and realizes there are more intruders, then returns to find the safe empty.\n\nRocky and Alex evade Nordstrom and enter the basement. There, they find a restrained and gagged pregnant woman who reveals herself to be Cindy Roberts. Rocky and Alex free her and attempt to open the storm cellar door. Nordstrom shoots at them, accidentally killing Cindy. Nordstrom breaks down and cries in distress over her body. He then shuts off the lights, plunging the basement into darkness. After a blind chase and struggle, Alex knocks out Nordstrom and they flee upstairs.\n\nAfter blocking the basement door, they encounter the dog, who has awakened, and flee into the bedroom. Rocky escapes the room through a ventilation duct. Alex falls out of a window onto a skylight and is knocked out. When Alex awakens, Nordstrom shoots out the skylight and corners him in the utility room, stabbing him with a pair of garden shears. The dog pursues Rocky through the vents before she is captured by Nordstrom.\n\nRocky wakes up restrained in the basement. Nordstrom reveals that Cindy was pregnant with a \"replacement\" for his daughter. He then prepares to artificially inseminate Rocky using a turkey baster, promising to let her go after she gives him a child. Alex, who survived by tricking Nordstrom into stabbing Money's corpse, saves Rocky and handcuffs Nordstrom.\n\nRocky and Alex try to leave through the front door. Nordstrom breaks free and shoots Alex dead. Rocky flees as the dog pursues her. She traps the dog in her car trunk but gets captured again by Nordstrom. After being dragged back inside his house, Rocky disorients him by setting off the alarm system, then hits him repeatedly in the head with a crowbar and pushes him into the basement. The gun fires into his side as he falls. Believing him dead, Rocky escapes before the police arrive.\n\nLater, Rocky and Diddy see a news report about the incident. Nordstrom, who is recovering in a hospital and under stable condition, is reported to have killed two intruders (Alex and Money) in self-defense. He does not mention Rocky, Cindy or the stolen cash. Rocky and Diddy board a train to Los Angeles.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jane Levy]] as Roxanne / \"Rocky\", a Detroit thief who wants to escape to California for a better life\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as Norman Nordstorm / \"The Blind Man\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/dont-breathe-interview-fede-alvarez/ |title=Don't Breathe Director Fede Alvarez's Advice To Future Filmmakers |website=[[Screen Rant]] |date=August 25, 2016 |access-date=2022-08-14 }}</ref> a veteran of the [[Gulf War]] who was blinded by shrapnel\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as Alex,<ref>{{cite web |author=Rebecca Ford |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/prisoners-actor-dylan-minnette-joins-797577 |title='Prisoners' Actor Dylan Minnette Joins Fede Alvarez's Horror Film (Exclusive) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2015-05-22 |access-date=2015-10-24}}</ref> a Detroit thief and Rocky's friend\n* [[Daniel Zovatto]] as Money,<ref name=\"deadline1\">{{cite magazine |last=Lincoln |first=Ross A. |url=https://deadline.com/2015/05/actor-daniel-zovatto-joins-cast-of-fede-alvarez-a-man-in-the-dark-1201419359/ |title='A Man In The Dark' Casting: Daniel Zovatto Joins Fede Alvaraz Movie |magazine=Deadline |date=2015-05-01 |access-date=2015-10-24}}</ref> a Detroit thief and Rocky's boyfriend\n* Franciska T\u00f6r\u0151csik as Cindy Roberts\n* Emma Bercovici as Diddy, Rocky's younger sister\n* Christian Zagia as Raul<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cooltivarte.com/portal/?s=Christian+Zagia |title=CHRISTIAN ZAGIA: EN LAS TABLAS |date=April 19, 2013 }}</ref>\n* Katia Bokor as Ginger, Rocky's abusive mother\n* Sergej Onopko as Trevor\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] noted that making the film was, in some ways, a reaction to his debut film ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'' (2013), specifically the criticisms that the film had too much blood, focused too much on shocking the audience, and was a remake.
