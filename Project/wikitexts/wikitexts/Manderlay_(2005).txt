It stars [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], who replaces [[Nicole Kidman]] in the role of Grace Mulligan. The film co-stars [[Willem Dafoe]], replacing [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]]. [[Lauren Bacall]], [[\u017deljko Ivanek]], [[Jeremy Davies]], and [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] return portraying different characters from those in ''[[Dogville]]''.\nOnly [[John Hurt]], [[Udo Kier]], and [[Jean-Marc Barr]] reprise their roles. The film was [[International co-production|internationally co-produced]] with seven different European countries.\n\nThe staging is very similar to ''Dogville'', which was shot on a sparsely dressed [[sound stage]]. As in the case of ''Dogville'', ''Manderlay''{{'}}s action is confined to a small geographic area, in this case a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]. The film is dedicated in memory of a French film producer, [[Humbert Balsan]] (1954-2005).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is told in eight straight chapters:\n# In which we happen upon Manderlay and meet the people there\n# \"The freed enterprise of Manderlay\"\n# \"The Old Lady's Garden\"\n# In which Grace means business\n# \"Shoulder to Shoulder\"\n# Hard times at Manderlay\n# \"Harvest\"\n# In which Grace settles with Manderlay and the film ends\n\nSet in 1933, the film takes up the story of Grace and her father after burning the town of Dogville at the end of the previous film. Grace and her father travel in convoy with a number of gunmen through rural [[Alabama]] where they stop briefly outside a plantation called Manderlay. As the gangsters converse, a black woman emerges from Manderlay's front gates complaining that someone is about to be whipped for stealing a bottle of wine.\n\nGrace enters the plantation and learns that within it, [[slavery]] persists, roughly 70 years after the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Grace is appalled and insists on staying at the plantation with a small contingent of gunmen and her father's lawyer, Joseph, in order to guarantee the slaves' safe transition to freedom. Shortly after Grace's father and the remaining gangsters depart, Mam, the master of the house, dies, but not before asking Grace to burn a notebook containing \"Mam's Law,\" an exhaustive code of conduct for the entire plantation and all its inhabitants, free and slave. She reads the descriptions of each variety of slave that can be encountered, which include:\n* Group 1: Proudy [[Nigger]]\n* Group 2: Talkin' Nigger\n* Group 3: Weepin' Nigger\n* Group 4: Hittin' Nigger\n* Group 5: Clownin' Nigger\n* Group 6: Losin' Nigger\n* Group 7: Pleasin' Nigger (also known as a [[chameleon]], a person of the kind who can transform himself into exactly the type the beholder would like to see)\n\nThe principal seven divisions are each populated by a single adult slave at Manderlay, who congregate daily and converse on a \"parade ground,\" with Roman numerals of the numbers 1 through 7 designating where each slave stands. \"Mam's Law\" contains further provisions against the use of cash by slaves, or the felling of trees on the property for timber.\n\nAll of this information disgusts Grace and inspires her to take charge of the plantation in order to punish the slave owners and prepare the slaves for life as free individuals. In order to guarantee that the former slaves will not continue to be exploited as [[sharecroppers]], Grace orders Joseph to draw up contracts for all Manderlay's inhabitants, institutionalizing a form of cooperative living in which the white family works as slaves and the blacks collectively own the plantation and its crops. Throughout this process, Grace lectures all those present about the notions of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and democracy, using rhetoric entirely in keeping with the ideology of [[racial equality]] which most contemporary Americans had yet to embrace.\n\nHowever, as the film progresses, Grace fails to embed these principles in Manderlay's community in a form she considers satisfactory. Furthermore, her suggestions for improving the conditions of the community backfire on several occasions, such as using the surrounding trees for timber, which leaves the crops vulnerable to dust storms. After a year of such tribulations, the community harvests its cotton and successfully sells it, marking the high point of Grace's involvement. Subsequently, she un-enthusiastically has sex with one of the ex-slaves who also steals and gambles away all of the cotton profits. Finally admitting her failure, Grace contacts her father and attempts to leave the plantation only to be stopped by the plantation's blacks. At this point it is revealed that \"Mam's Law\" was not conceived and enforced by Mam or any of the other whites, but instead by Wilhelm, the community's eldest member, as a means of maintaining the status quo after the abolition of slavery, protecting the blacks from a hostile outside world. As in many von Trier films, the [[Idealism|idealistic]] main character becomes frustrated by the reality he or she encounters.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Grace Margaret Mulligan\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Mr. Mulligan\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Wilhelm\n* [[Lauren Bacall]] as Mam\n* [[Jean-Marc Barr]] as Mr. Robinson\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Mr. Kirspe\n* [[Isaach de Bankol\u00e9]] as Timothy\n* [[Micha\u00ebl Abiteboul]] as Thomas\n* Geoffrey Bateman as Bertie\n* Virgile Bramly as Edward\n* Ruben Brinkman as \"Bingo\"\n* [[Do\u00f1a Croll]] as Venus\n* [[Jeremy Davies (actor)|Jeremy Davies]] as Niels\n* [[Llewella Gideon]] as Victoria\n* [[Mona Hammond]] as Old Wilma\n* [[Ginny Holder]] as Elizabeth\n* [[Emmanuel Idowu]] as Jim\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Dr. Hector\n* Teddy Kempner as Joseph\n* [[Rik Launspach]] as Stanley Mays\n* [[Suzette Llewellyn]] as Flora\n* Charles Maquignon as Bruno\n* [[Joseph Mydell]] as Mark\n* [[Javone Prince]] as Jack\n* [[Clive Rowe]] as Sammy\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Philomena\n* [[Nina Sosanya]] as Rose\n* [[John Hurt]] as The Narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2022}}\n[[Nicole Kidman]] and [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] did not return in the film, the former due to scheduling conflicts while the latter disapproves the film, which was subjected the film by Caan as [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American culture]] and [[slavery]].\n\nIn terror over her sex scene, [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] said she went through it in a hypnotic state. After the first take she excused herself and went to the bathroom to collect her thoughts. Then she just started to look at it as some sort of comedic scene. \"Just in my head. And interestingly enough, Lars kind of felt that. The scene wasn't written funny at all, but there are some really eccentric and absurd moments in that scene that people tend to chuckle at.\"<ref>{{cite web |title='Prude' Howard fills in for Kidman |work=www.deseret.com |url=https://www.deseret.com/2005/5/22/19893406/prude-howard-fills-in-for-kidman |access-date=9 February 2022 }}</ref>\n\n=== Donkey killing ===\nDuring production, a [[donkey]] was slaughtered for dramatic purposes.
