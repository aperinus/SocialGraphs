The screenplay was written by [[Charles Lederer]] (with uncredited input from [[Eric Ambler]], William L. Driscoll, [[Borden Chase]], [[John Gay (screenwriter)|John Gay]], and [[Ben Hecht]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056264/fullcredits|title=Mutiny on the Bounty (1962): Full Cast & Crew|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=March 29, 2011|archive-date=November 10, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110122337/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056264/fullcredits|url-status=live}}</ref> based on the novel ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (novel)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' by [[Charles Nordhoff]] and [[James Norman Hall]]. [[Bronis\u0142aw Kaper]] composed the score.\n\nThe film tells a fictionalized story of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|real-life mutiny]] led by [[Fletcher Christian]] against [[William Bligh]], captain of [[HMS Bounty|HMAV ''Bounty'']], in 1789. It is the second American film to be based on the novel, the first being ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' (1935), also produced by MGM.\n\n''Mutiny on the Bounty'' was the first motion picture filmed in the [[Ultra Panavision 70]] [[widescreen]] process. It was partly shot on location in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].  Panned by critics, the film was a [[box-office bomb|box office flop]], losing more than $6&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|USD|6|1962}} million in {{Inflation/year|USD}}).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 1787, the ''Bounty'' sets sail from Britain for [[Tahiti]] under the command of Captain William Bligh ([[Trevor Howard]]). His mission is to collect a shipload of [[breadfruit]] saplings and transport them to [[Jamaica]]. The government hopes the plants will thrive and provide a cheap source of food for the slaves.\n\nThe voyage gets off to a difficult start with the discovery that some cheese is missing. Seaman John Mills ([[Richard Harris]]) accuses Bligh, the true pilferer, and Bligh has Mills brutally flogged for showing contempt to his superior officer, to the disgust of his [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] second-in-command, First Lieutenant Fletcher Christian ([[Marlon Brando]]). The tone for the months to come is set by Bligh's ominous pronouncement: \"Cruelty with a purpose is not cruelty, it is efficiency.\" Aristocrat Christian is deeply offended by his ambitious captain.\n\nBligh tries to reach Tahiti sooner by attempting the shorter westbound route around [[Cape Horn]], a navigational nightmare. The strategy fails and the ''Bounty'' backtracks eastward, costing the mission much precious time. Singlemindedly, Bligh makes up the lost time by pushing the crew harder and cutting their rations.\n\nWhen the ''Bounty'' reaches her destination, the crew revels in the easygoing life of the tropical paradise \u2013 and in the free-love philosophies of the Tahitian women. Christian himself is smitten with Maimiti ([[Tarita Teriipaia]]), daughter of the Tahitian king. Bligh's agitation is further fueled by the fact that the dormancy period of the breadfruit means more months of delay until the plants can be potted. As departure day nears, three men, including seaman Mills, attempt to desert but are caught by Christian and clapped in irons by Bligh.\n\nOn the voyage to Jamaica, Bligh attempts to bring back twice the number of breadfruit plants to atone for his tardiness, and must reduce the water rations of the crew to water the extra plants. One member of the crew falls from the rigging to his death while attempting to retrieve the drinking ladle. Another assaults Bligh over conditions on the ship and is fatally [[keelhauled]]. Mills taunts Christian after each death, trying to egg him on to challenge Bligh. When a crewman becomes gravely ill from drinking seawater, Christian attempts to give him fresh water, in violation of the Captain's orders. Bligh strikes Christian when he ignores his second order to stop. In response, Christian strikes Bligh. Bligh informs Christian that he will hang for his actions when they reach port. With nothing left to lose, Christian takes command of the ship and sets Bligh and the loyalist members of the crew adrift in the [[longboat]] with navigational equipment, telling them to make for a local island. Bligh decides instead to cross much of the Pacific in order to reach British authorities sooner. He returns to Britain with remarkable speed.\n\nThe military court exonerates Bligh of any misdeeds and recommends an expedition to arrest the mutineers and put them on trial, but it also comes to the conclusion that the appointment of Bligh as captain of the ''Bounty'' was wrong. In the meantime, Christian sails back to Tahiti to pick up supplies and the girlfriends of the crew. Then they go on to remote [[Pitcairn Island]]\u2014which is marked incorrectly on the charts\u2014to hide from the wrath of the [[Royal Navy]]. However, once on Pitcairn, Christian decides that it is their duty to return to Britain and testify to Bligh's wrongdoing, and he asks his men to sail with him. To prevent this possibility, the men set the ship on fire and Christian is fatally burned while trying to save it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as 1st Lt.

No film resulted. In 1945 [[Casey Wilson]] wrote a script for ''Christian of the Bounty'', which was to star [[Clark Gable]] as [[Fletcher Christian]] and focus on Christian's life on [[Pitcairn Island]].<ref name=\"new\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/11/02/archives/two-studios-plan-a-bounty-mutiny-mgm-and-paramount-race-to-complete.html|title=TWO STUDIOS PLAN A BOUNTY 'MUTINY'; M-G-M and Paramount Race to Complete Productions of Films on Sea Adventure|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 2, 1959|access-date=July 12, 2018|page=39|archive-date=July 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712224843/https://www.nytimes.com/1959/11/02/archives/two-studios-plan-a-bounty-mutiny-mgm-and-paramount-race-to-complete.html|url-status=live}}</ref> This was never filmed.

[[Carol Reed]] was hired to direct. In order to take full advantage of Technicolor and the widescreen format (shooting in [[Ultra Panavision 70|MGM Camera 65]]), the production was to be filmed on location in [[Tahiti]], with cinematographer [[Robert Surtees (cinematographer)|Robert Surtees]].

Filming was difficult, in part because the script was being rewritten and Brando was reportedly ad-libbing much of his part. Costs were also high due to the remote location.<ref name=\"marlon\">{{cite news|title=TAHITI WAS PARADISE |date=December 17, 1961 |work=[[The Times of India]] |page=A6|id={{ProQuest|744310855}} }}</ref> Despite the ongoing changes to the script and the production's financial and logistical problems, Brando later wrote about how much he enjoyed the island and his interactions with its native people:{{blockquote|From the moment I saw it, reality surpassed even my fantasies about Tahiti, and I had some of the best times of my life making ''Mutiny on the Bounty''. The filming was done largely on a replica of H.M.S.

MGM then demanded that Reed finish the film within 100 days, but the director said he needed 139. The studio fired him. Brando claims in his memoirs that MGM fired Reed because he wanted to make Bligh the hero.<ref>''Brando'', p. 270.</ref>\n\n===Lewis Milestone===\nReed was replaced by Lewis Milestone, in what would be his last stint directing a theatrical film. \"Reed was used to making his own pictures\", said Milestone. \"He was not used to producer, studio and star interference. But those of us who have been around Hollywood are like alley cats. We know this style. We know how to survive.\"<ref name=\"cost\"/>\n\nMilestone later said \"I felt it would be an easy assignment because they'd been on it for months and there surely couldn't be much left to do.\"<ref name=\"Higham, p. 193.\">Higham, Charles; Greenberg, Joel (1971).

Regnery, p. 193; hereinafter cited \"Higham\".</ref> However, he says he found that they had only shot one seven-minute scene, where Trevor Howard issues instructions about obtaining [[breadfruit]].<ref name=\"cost\"/>\n\nFilming resumed in March 1961 at MGM studios. Milestone said that for his first two weeks on the film \"Brando behaved himself and I got a lot of stuff done\", such as the arrival of the ''Bounty'' at Tahiti. The director says he \"got on beautifully with\" the British actors. \"They were real human beings and I had a lot of fun.\"<ref name=\"Higham, p. 193.\"/>\n\nMilestone says \"the trouble started\" after the first two weeks. He summarised the cause: \"The producer made a number of promises to Marlon Brando which he couldn't keep. It was an impossible situation because, right or wrong, the man simply took charge of everything. You had the option of sitting and watching him or turning your back on him. Neither the producers nor I could do anything about it.\"<ref name=\"Higham, p. 193.\"/>\n\nThe unit returned to Tahiti in April 1961. Filming was plagued by bad weather and script problems. Richard Harris clashed with Brando, and Brando was frequently late to set and difficult while filming.<ref name=\"phil\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=How Richard Harris Told Off Brando|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date= 18 February 1962|page= A4}}</ref>\n\n\"Marlon did not have approval of the story\", said Milestone. \"But he did have approval of himself. If Brando did not like something, he would just stand in front of the camera and not act. He thought only of himself. At the same time, he was right in many things that he wanted. He is too cerebral to play the part of Mr. Christian the way Clark Gable played it.\"<ref name=\"cost\"/>\n\nMilestone said the script was constantly being rewritten by Charles Lederer on set, with input from Rosenberg, [[Sol Siegel]] and [[Joseph Vogel]], as well as Brando. Milestone said Lederer would often work on the script with Brando in the morning, and shooting would not start until the afternoon. Milestone said \"you had the option of shooting it, but since Marlon Brando was going to supervise it anyway, I waited until someone yelled 'camera' and went off to sit down somewhere and read the paper.\"<ref name=\"Higham, p. 193.\"/>\n\nThe film ended up costing $10&nbsp;million more than originally expected.<ref name=\"cost\">{{cite news|date=March 25, 1962|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/03/25/archives/hollywood-at-sea-bounty-director-blames-a-timorous-management-for.html|first=Murray|last=Schumach|title=HOLLYWOOD AT SEA; 'Bounty' Director Blames a Timorous Management for Tumultuous Saga|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 12, 2018|archive-date=July 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712221109/https://www.nytimes.com/1962/03/25/archives/hollywood-at-sea-bounty-director-blames-a-timorous-management-for.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Adding to the turmoil of the production's woes, a Tahitian was killed while filming a canoe sequence.\n\n\"I have been in this business a few days but I never saw anything like this\", said Milestone. \"It was like being in a hurricane on a rudderless ship without a captain. I thought when I took the job that it would be a nice trip.
