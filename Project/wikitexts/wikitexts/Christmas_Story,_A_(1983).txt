It stars [[Melinda Dillon]], [[Darren McGavin]], and [[Peter Billingsley]] and is a seasonal classic in North America.

The building was restored and reconfigured inside to match the soundstage interiors and is open to the public as [[A Christmas Story House]].]]\n\nThe film is presented in a series of [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]], with narration provided by the adult Ralphie Parker reminiscing on one particular Christmas when he was nine years old in [[Hammond, Indiana]]. Ralphie wanted only one thing that Christmas: a [[Daisy Outdoor Products#Red Ryder BB Gun|Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle]]. Ralphie's desire is rejected by his mother, his teacher Miss Shields, and even a Santa Claus at [[Higbee's]] department store, all giving him the same warning: \"You'll shoot your eye out\".\n\nOn Christmas morning, Ralphie receives some presents that he enjoys but is disappointed not to find the rifle among them. When it appears that all of the presents have been opened, Ralphie's father (\"The Old Man\") directs him to one last box hidden in the corner, which proves to contain the rifle. He eagerly hurries outside to try it out, attaching a target to a metal sign in the backyard; when he fires, the BB ricochets back and hits him in the face. Believing at first that he has indeed shot his eye out, he realizes that the BB only knocked his glasses off and begins searching for them in the snow, only to step on them by accident and break them. He lies to his mother that a falling icicle struck him in the face and broke his glasses, and she believes him and takes him to the bathroom to get cleaned up.\n\nThat night, Ralphie goes to sleep with the gun by his side as his adult self reflects that it was the best Christmas present he had ever received or would ever receive.\n\n===Other vignettes===\nInterspersed with the main story are several loosely related vignettes involving the Parkers:\n\n* The Old Man wins a \"major award\" in a contest \u2013 a table lamp in the shape of a woman's leg wearing a [[fishnet stocking]]. The Old Man is overjoyed but Mrs. Parker is not. \"The Battle of the Lamp\" develops, ending with Mrs. Parker \"accidentally\" destroying it, much to the Old Man's fury. Unable to fix the lamp, he defeatedly buries the remains in the backyard.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shepherd |first=Jean |title=In God We Trust All Others Pay Cash |year=1966 |type=Mass Market Paperback |publisher=Bantam Books |chapter=My Old Man And The Lascivious Special Award That Heralded the Birth Of Pop Art |page=63}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicklives.com/index.php?pg=272|title=flicklives.com|website=www.flicklives.com}}</ref>\n* The Old Man also fights a never-ending battle with the malfunctioning furnace in the Parker home. His frustrations cause him to swear quite often, including one profanity-laden rant (heard as [[gibberish]]) that the adult Ralphie says \"is still hanging in space over [[Lake Michigan]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Trivia \u2013 ''A Christmas Story'' House |publisher=Turner Entertainment Co. |url=http://www.achristmasstoryhouse.com/index.php/a-christmas-story-movie-facts/ |access-date=December 25, 2012}}</ref> His influence later reflects back upon Ralphie when The Old Man's car suddenly blows a tire, and Mrs. Parker suggests that Ralphie help his father change the tire. While holding the bolts in the tire's hubcap, The Old Man accidentally knocks them out of Ralphie's hands, causing Ralphie to utter profanity and have his mouth washed out with soap.\n* Still another source of frustration for The Old Man is the dogs that belong to the Bumpus family, the Parkers' [[hillbilly]] next-door neighbors. The Bumpuses own \"at least 785 smelly hound dogs\" that harass The Old Man whenever he comes home from work. On Christmas Day, the dogs ruin the family's dinner by romping through their kitchen and eating their turkey, forcing the family to go to a [[Chinese restaurant]] for Christmas dinner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefw.com/things-you-didnt-know-about-a-christmas-story/|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About ''A Christmas Story''|access-date=December 25, 2015|work=thefw.com|author=TheFW Staff}}</ref>\n* Ralphie and his friends Flick and Schwartz along with Randy are tormented by the neighborhood bullies Scut Farkus and Grover Dill.

Shepherd provides the film's narration from the perspective of an adult Ralphie, a narrative style later used in the [[comedy-drama]] television series ''[[The Wonder Years]]''. Shepherd, Brown, and Clark have cameo appearances in the film: Shepherd plays the man who directs Ralphie and Randy to the back of the Santa line at the department store; Brown \u2013 Shepherd's wife in real life \u2013 plays the woman in the Santa line with Shepherd; Clark plays Swede, the neighbor the Old Man talks to outside during the Leg Lamp scene.<ref name=\"vanityfair.com\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/11/how-a-christmas-story-became-an-american-tradition|title=How ''A Christmas Story'' Went from Low-Budget Fluke to an American Tradition|first=Sam|last=Kashner|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=November 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the DVD commentary, director Bob Clark mentions that [[Jack Nicholson]] was considered for the role of the Old Man; Clark expresses gratitude that he ended up with Darren McGavin instead, who later appeared in several other Clark films.

Clark initially wanted him for the role of Ralphie but decided he was \"too obvious\" a choice and auditioned many other young actors before realizing that Billingsley was the right choice after all.\n\nIan Petrella was cast immediately before filming began. Tedde Moore had previously appeared in Clark's film ''[[Murder by Decree]]'' and was the only onscreen character from ''A Christmas Story'' who was played by the same actor in the sequel, ''[[My Summer Story]]''.

Harding Elementary School and Cleveland Street (where Shepherd spent his childhood). Other local references include mention of a person \"swallowing a yo-yo\" in nearby [[Griffith, Indiana|Griffith]],<ref name=hammond/> the Old Man being one of the fiercest \"furnace fighters in Northern Indiana\" and that his obscenities were \"hanging in space over [[Lake Michigan]]\", a mention of the [[Indianapolis 500]], and the line to Santa Claus \"stretching all the way to [[Terre Haute]]\". The Old Man is also revealed to be a fan of the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] (whom he jokingly calls the \"Chicago Chipmunks\") and [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]], consistent with living in northwest Indiana. In commemoration of the setting, the City of Hammond holds an annual exhibit regarding the film in November and December, including a statue recreating the scene where Ralphie's friend Flick freezes his tongue to a flagpole.<ref>{{cite web |title=''A Christmas Story'' Comes Home |publisher=South Shore Convention and Visitors Association |url=https://www.southshorecva.com/achristmasstory/ |access-date=2020-10-15}}</ref>\n\nDirector [[Bob Clark]] reportedly sent [[location scouting|scouts]] to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland for exterior filming. Cleveland was chosen because of [[Higbee's]] Department Store in downtown Cleveland. (Since Higbee's was exclusive to northeast Ohio,<ref name=\"Higbee's\">{{cite web|title=Higbees |url=http://www.achristmasstoryhouse.com/higbees.shtml |work=A Christmas Story House|access-date=2006-11-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123162631/http://www.achristmasstoryhouse.com/higbees.shtml |archive-date=November 23, 2006}}</ref> the department store referred to in Shepherd's book and the film is most likely [[Goldblatt's]], located in downtown Hammond (with the Cam-Lan Chinese Restaurant three doors down on Sibley Ave). Until they connected with Higbee's, location scouts had been unsuccessful in finding a department store that was willing to be part of the film. Higbee's vice president Bruce Campbell agreed to take part in the project on the condition he is allowed to edit the script for cursing. Ultimately, Higbee's was the stage for three scenes in the film:\n* The opening scene in which Ralphie first spies the Red Ryder BB Gun in the store's [[Christmas window]] display. Higbee's was known for its elaborate, child-centered Christmas themes and decorations, with Santa as the centerpiece.\n* The parade scene, filmed just outside Higbee's on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] at 3 AM. The parade was filmed at night because during the daytime the 1960s Erieview Tower and Federal Building was visible from the Public Square, as was the [[BP Tower]], which was under construction at the time.\n* Ralphie and Randy's visit to see Santa, which was filmed inside Higbee's. The store kept the Santa slide that was made for the film and used it for several years after the film's release. Higbee's became [[Dillard's]] in 1992 and closed permanently in 2002.<ref name=\"Higbee's\"/>\n\nIn addition to the scenes involving Higbee's, the exterior shots (and select interior shots where Ralphie lived, including the opening of the leg lamp) of the house and neighborhood, were filmed in the [[Tremont, Cleveland|Tremont]] section of Cleveland's West Side. The house used as the Parker home in these scenes has been restored, reconfigured inside to match the soundstage interiors, and opened to the public as \"[[A Christmas Story House]]\". Appropriately, the fictional boyhood home of Ralphie Parker is on Cleveland Street, the name of the actual street where Shepherd grew up.\n\nSeveral other locations were used. The school scenes were shot at the Victoria School in [[St. Catharines|St. Catharines, Ontario]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Warren G.

Their film, ''Road Trip for Ralphie'', was shot over two years and includes footage of the filmmakers saving Miss Shields' blackboard from the garbage bin on the day the old Victoria School was gutted for renovation, discovering the antique fire truck that saved Flick, locating original costumes from the film, and tracking down the location of the film's Chop Suey Palace in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |title=Road Trip for Ralphie |url=http://www.roadtripforralphie.com |publisher=roadtripforralphie.com |access-date=December 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204115238/http://www.roadtripforralphie.com/ |archive-date=December 4, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Red Ryder BB Gun===\n{{main|Red Ryder BB Gun}}\nThe \"Red Ryder\" model BB Gun was manufactured in Plymouth, Michigan by Daisy, beginning in 1940; it was never manufactured in the exact configuration mentioned in the film.

The ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine that Ralphie hides the Red Ryder ad in, is the December 1937 cover with Shirley Temple and Santa. Ralphie's ''[[Little Orphan Annie (radio series)|Little Orphan Annie]]'' Secret Society Decoder Pin bears the date 1940 (and is the real-life decoder pin released to society members that year, though by that time [[Ovaltine]] had ceased its sponsorship and [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker]] was the primary sponsor of the series), the parade in front of Higbee's features characters from MGM's version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which was released in 1939, and [[World War II]], which the [[United States declaration of war on Japan|United States entered in December 1941]], is never mentioned.
