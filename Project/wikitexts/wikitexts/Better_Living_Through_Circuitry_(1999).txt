This is considered to be the first full-length documentary film that goes behind the [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] scene and uncovers the culture it has spawned. The film presented aspects of [[rave]] culture such as: empowerment through advances in musical electronics technology, the DIY (do-it-yourself) ethic, and the flowering of a new spirituality embracing transcendence through sound and rhythm. A cross-section of the techno subculture is represented. In the documentary, ravers, DJs and musicians speak for themselves about their music and ideals.
