It is one of several successful teen dramas written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] in the 1980s.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set against the strict social hierarchy of an American public [[high school]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Blue-collar mechanic and aspiring artist Keith Nelson is best friends with [[tomboy]] drummer Watts. Keith's father is obsessed with sending him to college for business, as he would be the first in their family to go.\n\nKeith is enamored with Amanda Jones, one of the most popular girls in school, and he spends much of his time drawing her. She is dating Hardy Jenns, a spoiled and selfish boy from a wealthy neighborhood. However, Amanda herself is not wealthy: she lives in the same working-class district as Watts and Keith, and she borrows her fashionable clothes from her friends. Hardy treats Amanda as his \"property\" while also fooling around with another girl. Watts is dismissive of Keith's crush, saying that he and Amanda are too different. Hearing that Amanda will be in detention for the foreseeable future, Keith gets himself in trouble to spend time with her. However, Amanda talks her way out of detention, and he is stuck with the school criminals, eventually making friends with troublemaker Duncan.\n\nWhen Amanda breaks up with Hardy, Keith asks her out. Mainly to spite Hardy, Amanda accepts. Meanwhile, seeing Keith with Amanda makes Watts realize that she loves him as more than just a friend. Watts pretends to like another boy to try and make Keith jealous, and she continues to discourage Keith from being with Amanda, to no avail.\n\nHardy plots trouble for Keith by inviting him and Amanda to a party after their date, where he plans to have Keith beaten up. Through his sister Laura, Keith finds out about the scheme and believes Amanda is a part of it. He decides to go to the party anyway and face Hardy.\n\nAmanda's wealthy and popular friends start to shun her for being with Keith, and he tries to plan the perfect date to prove he is worthy of Amanda. With Watts in tow, he uses his college money to buy a pair of diamond earrings. Watts tells him that Amanda will appreciate a good kisser, and she kisses Keith under the guise of teaching him how to do it. Still, Keith is oblivious to Watts' attraction to him. When Keith's father discovers the college fund has been emptied, he is livid, but Keith ultimately convinces his father to respect the right to make his own decisions.\n\nOn the night of the date, Keith picks up Amanda, with Watts serving as their chauffeur. They go to an expensive restaurant for dinner, however they initially argue. Then, Keith brings Amanda to an art museum and shows her a painting he did of her. He gives her the earrings, and they kiss while Watts watches them from a distance.\n\nFinally, they go to Hardy's party. Keith is about to get beaten by Hardy's friends when Duncan and the other school criminals arrive to help him. Hardy tries to talk his way out of the predicament, exposing himself as a coward in front of the party guests. Amused, Keith tells Hardy he is \"over,\" after which Amanda slaps Hardy.\n\nAfter they leave the party, Watts apologizes to Amanda. Watts then leaves them and starts to walk home in tears. Amanda suddenly realizes that Keith and Watts have feelings for each other. She gives the earrings back to Keith and urges him to go after Watts. Keith, realizing that he is in love with his best friend, bids Amanda goodbye. He catches up to Watts, and they kiss. He then gives the earrings to a delighted Watts, who admits that she wanted them. She puts them on and asks Keith how they look, and he replies, \"You look good wearing my future.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Keith Nelson\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Watts\n* [[Lea Thompson]] as Amanda Jones\n* [[Craig Sheffer]] as Hardy Jenns\n* [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]] as Cliff Nelson\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Duncan\n* [[Molly Hagan]] as Shayne\n* [[Maddie Corman]] as Laura Nelson\n* [[Jane Elliot]] as Carol Nelson\n* [[Candace Cameron Bure|Candace Cameron]] as Cindy Nelson\n* [[Chynna Phillips]] as Mia\n* [[Scott Coffey]] as Ray\n* [[Carmine Caridi]] as Museum Guard\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Gym Instructor\n\n==Production==\nDeutch and Hughes were not happy with the ending of their previous collaboration ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'' (1986); in the script and the original cut of the film Andy ([[Molly Ringwald]]) wound up with her best friend Duckie ([[Jon Cryer]]). Test audiences disliked that ending, however, so a new ending was shot where Andy wound up with Blane ([[Andrew McCarthy]]).<ref name=\"trivia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.somekindofwonderful.org/movie/trivia.html|title=Trivia|publisher=Some Kind of Wonderful}}</ref>\n\nWith ''Some Kind of Wonderful'', Hughes decided to re-tell the story, but with the genders of the main characters switched. Hughes named the three main protagonists\u2014Keith, Watts, and Amanda Jones\u2014as an inside-joke tribute to [[the Rolling Stones]] ([[Keith Richards]], [[Charlie Watts]], and the Stones' song \"Miss Amanda Jones\", respectively).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0G0BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA126|title=John Hughes: A Life In Film: The Genius Behind The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Home Alone|first=Kirk|last=Honeycutt|date=February 15, 2015|publisher=Race Point Publishing|isbn=9781627886239|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/73866/12-wonderful-facts-about-some-kind-wonderful|title=12 Wonderful Facts About Some Kind of Wonderful|date=January 17, 2016|website=mentalfloss.com}}</ref> Hughes wanted Ringwald to play the female lead role of Watts, but she declined in order to pursue more adult roles; she also thought the character of Amanda seemed too similar to the character she played in ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''.
