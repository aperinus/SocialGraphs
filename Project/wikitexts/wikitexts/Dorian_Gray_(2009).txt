The film stars [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]], [[Colin Firth]], [[Rebecca Hall]], [[Ben Chaplin]], [[Emilia Fox]], and [[Rachel Hurd-Wood]]. It tells the story of the title character, an attractive Englishman whose loveliness and spirit are captured in an enchanted painting that keeps him from aging. His portrait becomes further tainted with every sin he commits while he remains young and handsome.\n\n''Dorian Gray'' was released in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2009, by [[Momentum Pictures]],<ref name=Variety>{{cite news |url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117990207.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |author = Archie Thomas |title = Rebecca Hall joins ''Dorian Gray'' |work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date = 7 August 2008 |access-date = 12 September 2008}}</ref> having competed in the Official Fant\u00e0stic Competition at the 2009 [[Sitges Film Festival]].<ref name=Sitges>[http://sitgesfilmfestival.com/eng/noticies/?id=1002949 \"Line Up :: Official Fant\u00e0stic In Competition Selection\"].

Lord Henry's friend, society artist Basil Hallward, paints a [[portrait]] of Gray to capture his beauty. Gray makes a flippant pledge: he would [[Selling your soul|give anything to stay as he is in the picture\u2014even his soul]].\n\nGray falls in love with budding young actress, Sibyl Vane, and proposes marriage. Lord Henry tells Gray that having children is \"the beginning of the end\", and after the two men visit a [[Prostitution in England#19th century|brothel]], Gray leaves Sibyl. Heartbroken, the young woman commits [[suicide]] by drowning. Gray learns of her death from her brother, James (\"Jim\"), who reveals that Sybil was pregnant with Gray's child. Enraged, Jim tries to kill Gray before being carried off by the authorities. Gray's initial grief soon disappears as Lord Henry persuades him that all events are mere experiences and without consequence. His hedonistic lifestyle worsens, distancing him from a concerned Hallward.\n\nGray finds that Hallward's portrait of him has become warped and twisted, and realises that his off-hand pledge has come true; while the portrait ages, its owner's sins manifest as physical defects on the canvas. This results in Hallward's brutal murder after the artist reveals his secret. Gray dismembers and dumps Hallward's body in the [[River Thames]], but the remains are recovered and buried.\n\nGray decides to travel the world and invites Lord Henry, but he declines, citing his wife's pregnancy. After a 25-year absence, Gray stuns everyone at the welcoming party with his unchanged youthful appearance. He becomes close to Lord Henry's daughter, Emily, a member of the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|UK suffragette movement]], much to her father's disapproval.\n\nAlthough Gray appears interested in changing his ways for Emily, matters are complicated when he is confronted by Jim. Jim is killed by an oncoming train while pursuing Gray in the [[London Underground]]. As Gray makes arrangements to leave London with Emily, Lord Henry's suspicions are confirmed when a study of old photographs triggers a memory where Gray had suggested that he would exchange his soul in return for eternal youth and beauty.\n\nLord Henry discovers the concealed portrait and Basil's blood-stained scarf. Gray declares that he is the personification of the life Lord Henry had fantasised about. Gray attempts to strangle Lord Henry but Lord Henry knocks him aside and exposes the portrait. Horrified at the twisted sight on the canvas, Lord Henry sets it alight and locks the attic to ensure that Gray and the painting are destroyed. Gray confesses his love for Emily and turns his back as Lord Henry drags his daughter out of the burning mansion. Resolving to end his suffering, Gray impales the painting with a poker, causing his body to age rapidly before the attic is consumed by an explosion.\n\nA few months later, following a futile attempt to reconcile with Emily, Lord Henry, with his face partially burned, heads to his attic where he keeps the portrait of Gray as it was when Hallward painted it, grimly noting that nobody will look at it now. The portrait's eyes glow, implying that Gray's restless essence still resides within the painting, even after the destruction  of his physical self.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as [[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]]\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Lord Henry Wotton\n* [[Ben Chaplin]] as Basil Hallward (painter)\n* [[Rachel Hurd-Wood]] as Sibyl Vane\n* [[Johnny Harris (actor)|Johnny Harris]] as Jim Vane\n* [[Rebecca Hall]] as Emily Wotton\n* [[Emilia Fox]] as Lady Victoria Wotton\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Agatha\n* [[Maryam d'Abo]] as Gladys\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Lady Radley\n* [[Michael Culkin]] as Lord Radley\n}}\nSupporting parts are played by [[Pip Torrens]] as Victor, Gray's valet; [[Jo Woodcock]] as Lord and Lady Radley's daughter Celia; [[Max Irons]] as Lucius, a young man whom Gray assaults at a party for touching the key to the attic door; [[David Sterne]] as the theatre manager who first introduces Gray to Sibyl; and [[Douglas Henshall]] as Alan Campbell, an acquaintance of Gray's who is present when Jim Vane tries to strangle Gray.\n\n==Production==\nThe film began shooting in summer 2008 at [[Ealing Studios]] and locations across London<ref name=sa744655 /> and finished in October.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  The film received \u00a3500,000 of [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funding via the [[UK Film Council]]'s Premiere Fund.<ref name=sa744655>{{cite web |url = http://www.screenafrica.com/news/film/744655.htm |title = Remake of Oscar Wilde Classic |publisher = screenafrica.com |date = 9 September 2008 |access-date = 14 September 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080924001535/http://www.screenafrica.com/news/film/744655.htm |archive-date = 24 September 2008 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\nThe film received mixed reviews. {{As of|June 2020}}, the film holds an approval rating of 44% on film review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 39 reviews with an average rating of 5/10.
