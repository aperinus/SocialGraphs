The film is about a delinquent high school student who runs away from home, gets pregnant while hitchhiking, and becomes entangled in a criminal scheme to prove \"crime equals beauty\".\n\nThe film is dedicated to [[Manson Family]] member [[Charles \"Tex\" Watson]]. Waters' prison visits to Watson inspired the \"crime is beauty\" theme of the film and  in the film's opening credits, Waters includes a wooden toy helicopter that Watson made for him.\n\n==Plot==\nSpoiled delinquent high-school student Dawn Davenport goes berserk when her parents refuse to buy her the shoes she wants for Christmas because \"nice girls don't wear [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha]] heels\": she destroys presents, topples a Christmas tree on her mother, and flees the house. Dawn hitchhikes a ride with a lecherous man, Earl Peterson, who drives her to a dump where they have sex on a discarded mattress. Dawn gets pregnant, but Earl refuses to support her. She gives birth to a daughter, Taffy, whom she often beats and punishes severely. Dawn works various jobs and engages in criminal activities such as burglary and street prostitution with former high-school friends Chiclette and Concetta.\n\nDawn frequents the Lipstick Beauty Salon and marries Gater Nelson, her hair stylist and next-door neighbor. Donald and Donna Dasher, the owners of the beauty salon, recruit Dawn in a scheme to prove \"crime and beauty are the same\". They entice Dawn to commit crimes by promising her fame, supplying her with drugs and money, and photographing her crimes to stoke her vanity.\n\nGater's aunt, Ida Nelson, is distraught over her nephew's marriage because she wants him to date men instead of women. When the marriage fails, Dawn persuades the Dashers to fire Gater, who moves to Detroit to work in the auto industry.  Ida blames Dawn for driving Gater away and exacts revenge by [[acid attack|throwing acid in her face]], leaving Dawn hideously disfigured. The Dashers discourage Dawn from having corrective cosmetic surgery and use her as a grotesquely made-up model. After they kidnap Ida and imprison her in a large birdcage, they give Dawn an axe to chop off her hand as revenge for the acid attack.\n\nTaffy, now a teenager, is distressed by her mother's criminal lifestyle and persuades her to reveal the identity of her father. Taffy finds her father drunk, disheveled and living in squalor. She stabs him to death with a [[chef's knife]] after he tries to sexually assault her. Taffy returns home, falsely claims she was unable to locate her father, and announces she is joining the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement. Dawn warns her she will kill her if she does.\n\nDawn, now with bizarre hair, make-up and outfits provided by the Dashers, mounts a nightclub act. When Taffy appears backstage in religious attire, Dawn fulfills her threat and strangles her to death. Dawn brandishes a gun onstage during her nightclub act and begins firing into the crowd, wounding and killing several audience members. When police arrive to ostensibly subdue the crowd, they shoot several audience members themselves but allow the Dashers to leave when they claim to be upright citizens. Dawn flees into a forest, but is soon arrested by the police and put on trial for murder.\n\nAt the trial, the judge grants the Dashers immunity from prosecution for testifying against Dawn. The Dashers feign innocence and completely blame Dawn for the crimes she committed at their behest; they also pay Ida to lie on the witness stand. Although Dawn pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, the jury finds her guilty and sentences her to die in the [[electric chair]]. As a priest says a prayer and Dawn is strapped to the chair, she thanks her fans for her notoriety before being executed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Divine (performer)|Divine]] as Dawn Davenport / Earl Peterson\n* [[David Lochary]] as Donald Dasher\n* [[Mary Vivian Pearce]] as Donna Dasher\n* [[Mink Stole]] as Taffy Davenport\n* Hilary Taylor as Young Taffy\n* [[Edith Massey (actress)|Edith Massey]] as Ida Nelson\n* [[Cookie Mueller]] as Concetta\n* [[Susan Walsh (actress)|Susan Walsh]] as Chiclette Friar\n* Michael Potter as Gater Nelson\n* [[Ed Peranio]] as Wink\n* [[Paul Swift]] as Butterfly\n* [[George Figgs]] as Dribbles\n* [[Susan Lowe]] as Vikki\n* [[Channing Wilroy]] as Prosecutor\n* [[Elizabeth Coffey]] as Earnestine\n}}\n\n==Theme song==\nThe lyrics to the [[Theme song|title song]], sung by [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], were written by [[John Waters|Waters]] and set to the instrumental track of \"Black Velvet Soul\" by jazz musician Cookie Thomas. The lyrics foreshadow the ending of the film with Dawn being sent to the electric chair.\n\n==Production notes==\n* The unique [[production design]] is by [[Dreamlanders|Dreamlander]] [[Vincent Peranio]], who created Dawn's apartment in a condemned suite above a friend's store. \n* Waters explained in a 2015 interview<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3M-t64qkD8 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/c3M-t64qkD8| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=John Waters: on stage with the 'Pope of Trash'|last=BFI|date=September 28, 2015|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> that Dawn Davenport's look was based on the woman in the famous 1966 [[Diane Arbus]] photograph  of a young Brooklyn family on a Sunday outing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansuburbx.com/2013/06/diane-arbus-arbuss-box-of-ten-photographs.html|title=DIANE ARBUS: \"Arbus's Box of Ten Photographs\" (2003)|date=June 12, 2013}}</ref>\n* Divine chose to perform his own stunts, the most difficult of which involved doing flips on a trampoline during his nightclub act. Waters took Divine to a [[YMCA]], where he took lessons until the act was perfected to the point where he did the athletic stunt without his wig being dislodged. Divine also nailed a difficult outdoor stunt involving crossing a real river in drag in the sleet and rain. He could have been swept downstream, but made his mark on the other side with a smile on his face.\n* The birth scene was saved until the end of shooting, when [[Dreamlanders|Dreamlander]] Susan Lowe gave birth to a son and agreed to Waters' request that they film her son as Dawn's baby. The [[umbilical cord]] was fashioned out of [[Condom|prophylactics]] filled with [[liver]], while the baby (Ramsey McLean) was doused in fake blood. The scene greatly confused Lowe's mother-in-law, who was visiting from England to meet her grandchild for the first time.<ref name=\"FemaleTrouble DVD Special Ed\">{{cite video|people=John Waters|date=2004|title=FemaleTrouble DVD Special Ed.|format=DVD|publisher=New Line Cinema |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/female-trouble/}}</ref>\n* Although Dawn Davenport was [[Capital punishment|executed]] at the end of the film, [[Capital punishment in the United States|US capital punishment]] was suspended from 1972 to 1976 due to the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]''. [[Maryland]] did not formally reinstate capital punishment until July 1, 1975 (coincidentally, just 24 hours before John Waters had a \"special sneak preview\" of the film at a state prison where he did volunteer creative writing classes for inmates) and its constitutionality was not affirmed until 1976. Furthermore, [[asphyxiation]] in the [[gas chamber]] was the authorized method of execution, not [[Electric chair|electrocution]]. In the film, the jury pronounces Dawn's sentence, an act typically performed by a judge in actual court cases.\n* On the 2004 DVD Director's Special Comments, Waters states that the original working title of the film was \"''Rotten Mind, Rotten Face''\".<ref name=\"FemaleTrouble DVD Special Ed\"/> He changed it because he did not want to risk having hostile film critics using the headline \u201c\u2018Rotten Mind, Rotten Face\u2019 Rotten Movie\u201d\u2013\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has an 89% \"Fresh\" rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The consensus summarizes: \"Director John Waters' affection for camp brings texture to societal transgression in ''Female Trouble'', a brazenly subversive dive into celebrity and mayhem.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|female_trouble|Female Trouble}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Where do these people come from? Where do they go when the sun goes down? Isn't there a law or something?<br />\u2014 [[Rex Reed]]<ref name=\"FemaleTrouble DVD Special Ed\"/>}}\n\n==Alternate versions==\nThe initial [[16 mm film|16mm]] release of the film which was shown at colleges ran 92 minutes. However, when the film was blown up to [[35mm movie film|35mm]] and shown theatrically, it was cut to 89 minutes. This version was the only version seen in the United States for many years. However, a recent restoration was done of the original cut, which runs 97 minutes; it has played at this 97-minute length in Europe, however, since its initial release.\n\nThe 97-minute version was shown only in select theaters and was included in an out-of-print DVD set paired with ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (''Female Trouble'' is still available on DVD as a single disc and as part of a DVD [[box set]], ''Very Crudely Yours, John Waters''). This version also has a soundtrack remixed in stereo surround. The 97-minute version contains some additional scenes, including the chase through the woods, as well as an appearance by Sally Turner, the [[Elizabeth Taylor]] look-alike customer in the Lipstick Beauty Salon (Turner served as Divine's [[Body double|double]] in the junkyard sex scene between Dawn Davenport and Earl Peterson).\n\nThe film was shown in the 89-minute cut when re-released in 2002.\n\nThe 97-minute version is now available on DVD and includes an [[audio commentary]] by Waters.\n\n[[The Criterion Collection]] released a restored version of the film in [[4K resolution|4K]] on DVD and Blu-ray on June 26, 2018.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1974]]\n* [[List of Christmas films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Female Trouble}}\n* {{AFI film|55549}}\n* {{IMDb title|0072979}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=74743}}\n* {{amg movie|17058}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{YouTube|cqqRC8DX4KY|Official trailer}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/5767-female-trouble-spare-me-your-morals ''Female Trouble: Spare Me Your Morals''] an essay by [[Ed Halter]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{John Waters}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Female Trouble}}\n[[Category:1974 films]]\n[[Category:1970s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Waters]]\n[[Category:Bisexuality-related films]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films set in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1970s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Lesbian-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1974 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1974 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1974 drama films]]\n[[Category:Drag (clothing)-related films]]\n[[Category:Filicide in fiction]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
