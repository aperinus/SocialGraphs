The original music score is composed by [[Steve Dorff]].  The film generated a total domestic gross of $13,110,903. It received a \"two thumbs up\" rating from [[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Siskel and Ebert]].\n\nThe film is an open parody of the [[beach party film]]s made popular in the 1960s, especially those in which Avalon and Funicello had appeared. The plot is merely the means of connecting the various sight gags, homages and in-jokes.  All character names are taken from those earlier films.\n\nThe film's soundtrack included covers of several well-known beach tunes, along with new songs by such artists as [[Aimee Mann]] and [[Private Domain (band)|Private Domain]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nFrankie Avalon and Annette Funicello are a husband and wife living in [[Ohio]] \u2014 far from the surf and sand of their earlier lives together. Frankie is a stressed out car salesman and former \"Big Kahuna\" of the surf scene in [[California]] while Annette bottles her own sense of angst up in a bevy of shopping. Together they are raising a son, Bobby, who is in the throes of rebellion against his seemingly square folks.\n\nOne day, the family decides to take a vacation to [[Hawaii]]. Deciding to stop in California to visit their daughter Sandi ([[Lori Loughlin]]), Frankie and Annette are appalled to learn that she has been living with surfer Michael ([[Tommy Hinkley]]). The family misses their flight to Hawaii, and ultimately end up staying in California, much to the chagrin of Frankie. Frankie and Annette get caught up with the lives of their old friends and their old beach, and thus their last beach adventure begins.\n\nAlong the way, Frankie must work together with a new generation of younger surfers while nearly ruining his marriage by dallying with [[Connie Stevens]] \u2014 one of several pop-culture icons appearing in the film, including [[Fishbone]], [[Don Adams]], [[Bob Denver]], [[Alan Hale Jr.]], [[Edd Byrnes]], [[Jerry Mathers]], [[Tony Dow]], [[Barbara Billingsley]], [[Dick Dale]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[O. J. Simpson]], and [[Pee-wee Herman]]. In the end ''The Big Kahuna'' overcomes his own fears and proves that he is still the king of the surfers, as he takes back his title and saves the beach from a gang of beach punks led by Zed (Joe Holland).\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Frankie Avalon]] as Annette's Husband\n* [[Annette Funicello]] as Annette\n* [[Lori Loughlin]] as Sandi\n* [[Tommy Hinkley]] as Michael\n* Demian Slade as Bobby\n* [[Connie Stevens]] as Connie\n* Joe Holland as Zed\n* [[John Calvin (actor)|John Calvin]] as Troy\n* [[David Bowe (actor)|David Bowe]] as 'Mountain'\n* Laura Urstein as Robin\n* Linda Carol as Bridgette\n* [[Dick Dale]] as Himself\n* [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] as Himself\n* [[Fishbone]] as Themselves\n* [[Don Adams]] as The Harbormaster\n* [[Barbara Billingsley]] as Announcer\n* [[Edd Byrnes]] as Valet\n* [[Bob Denver]] as The Bartender\n* [[Tony Dow]] as Judge #1\n* [[Alan Hale Jr.]] as Bartender's Buddy\n* [[Jerry Mathers]] as Judge #2\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as [[Pee-wee Herman]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was the idea of Frankie Avalon and was in development for a number of years. He hired several screenwriters and shopped the screenplay around town. Paramount was attracted to the project but did not like the script. Because [[Orion Pictures]] owned the rights to the original AIP [[Beach party film|\"beach party movies\"]], Paramount wanted to make (in the words of one spokesperson) \"an entirely original screenplay not based on any prior beach movies. It parodies all beach movies.\"<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nWriter-director [[James Komack]] shared the same agent as Avalon; when he became attached Paramount agreed to finance. Komack stated:\n<blockquote>I met with [[Ned Tanen]] (Paramount's production chief) and we agreed it would be about a middle-age marital life crisis which, through a series of happy events, allows the couple to recapture their youth and renew the relationship. Eventually, they wanted a picture I couldn't deliver. They wanted to camp it up and I felt it wasn't necessary.<ref name=\"times\"/></blockquote>\nEventually Paramount hired [[Lyndall Hobbs]] to direct; she had never made a feature before but had directed numerous music videos. Various writers were hired, seventeen in all, including Jeff Buhia & Steve Zacharias, Robert Kaufman, David Obst and Bill Norton Jr. This cost an estimated $2 million in writer's fees.<ref name=\"times\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-05/entertainment/ca-2209_1_paramount|title=WRITE THE WILD SURF|author=Klady, Leonard|work=Los Angeles Times|date=5 July 1987|page=K21|access-date=18 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nFunicello called it her favourite filmmaking experience since ''[[Babes in Toyland (1961 movie)|Babes in Toyland]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=A dream is a wish your heart makes : my story|last1=Funicello|first1= Annette|last2= Bashe|first2= Patricia Romanowski|year=1994 |publisher=Hyperion|page=202}}</ref> However it was during the making of the movie she first started developing symptoms of MS.<ref>Funicello p 188-190</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 75% from 16 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/back_to_the_beach | title=Back to the Beach | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\nThe soundtrack for this film was released in 1987 on CBS Records (CK-40892).
