It is a [[remake]] of the [[RoboCop|1987 film of the same name]] and the fourth installment of the [[RoboCop (franchise)|''RoboCop'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Joel Kinnaman]] as the [[RoboCop (character)|title character]], with [[Gary Oldman]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Abbie Cornish]] and [[Jackie Earle Haley]] in supporting roles.\n\n[[Screen Gems]] first announced a remake in 2005, but it was halted one year later. [[Darren Aronofsky]] and [[David Self]] were originally assigned to direct and write the film, respectively, for a tentative 2010 release. The film was delayed numerous times, and Padilha signed on in 2011. In March 2012, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (successor company to [[Orion Pictures]] until September 11, 2014, the studio that released the original film) announced an August 2013 release, but that was then changed to February 2014. The principal characters were cast from March to July 2012. [[Principal photography]] began in September 2012 in [[Toronto]]<ref name=\"collider\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/robocop-new-armor-set-image/195784/ |title=ROBOCOP Remake Set Image Reveals New Armor |website=Collider |access-date=September 17, 2012 }}</ref> and [[Vancouver]] in Canada,<ref name=\"vancityfilming\">{{cite web|url=http://vancityfilming.com/robocop-reshoot-set-video-with-gary-oldman/|title=RoboCop: set video with Gary Oldman|publisher=Vancity Filming|access-date=May 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509231553/http://vancityfilming.com/robocop-reshoot-set-video-with-gary-oldman/|archive-date=May 9, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> with additional locations in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], in Canada, and [[Detroit]] in the United States.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on February 12, 2014. ''RoboCop'' received mixed reviews, with praise for some of the cast's performances, action, updates, style and political/media satire, but criticism for its lack of violence, social satire and humor compared to the original film, and grossed $242.6 million against its $100\u2013130 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- See [[WP:FILMPLOT]] for guidelines on film plots, which should be kept between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn [[2028]], multinational conglomerate OmniCorp revolutionizes warfare by introducing robotic [[Peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] capable of maintaining law and order. Led by CEO Raymond Sellars, the company moves to market its technology to domestic law enforcement. However, the passage of the Dreyfus Act, forbidding deployment of militarized drones in the United States, prevents this. Aware that most Americans oppose the use of military systems in their communities, Sellars asks Dr. Dennett Norton and his research team to come up with an alternative. The result is a proposal for a [[cyborg]] police officer. However, Norton informs Sellars that only someone stable enough to handle being a cyborg can be turned into one, and some candidates are rejected.\n\nA [[Detroit Police Department|Detroit]] police detective, [[RoboCop (character)|Alex Murphy]], is chosen after he is critically injured in a car bomb explosion arranged by crime boss Antoine Vallon as revenge for Murphy's investigation into his activities. Norton persuades Murphy's wife, Clara, to sign off on the procedure. Upon waking up and realizing the extent of his transformation, a frustrated Murphy escapes, but Norton shuts him down and brings him back to the lab. As Norton reveals to Murphy that the only remnants of his human body are most of his head (excluding parts of the brain), respiratory organs, heart, and right hand, a disgusted Murphy asks for [[euthanasia]]. Norton reminds Murphy about his wife's and son's patience, convincing him to live. During combat training with trainer Rick Mattox, Murphy proves unable to compete with the standard OmniCorp drones efficiently. Norton alters Murphy's programming to make him more efficient by letting drone programming take over his actions, making Murphy think they are his. This re-programming increases Murphy's efficiency dramatically, but leaves him less [[Empathy|empathetic]], due to his human nature being bypassed. That night, Murphy goes to his house to meet Clara and his son David to make sure they are okay, comforting David.\n\nShortly before he is publicly unveiled, the entire police database is uploaded to RoboCop's system, including the Alex Murphy crime scene, leading Murphy to have an [[emotional breakdown]], forcing Norton to suppress his emotions. During the ceremony, RoboCop identifies and apprehends a criminal in the crowd. He goes on to reduce crime in Detroit dramatically, simultaneously increasing public support for repealing the Dreyfus Act. Aware that Clara has begun to ask questions, Sellars orders Norton to keep her away from her husband.\n\nClara nevertheless manages to confront RoboCop, telling him of their son David's nightmares, social withdrawal, and unresponsive behavior. The experience drives Murphy to override his programming and access the previously sealed files on his attempted murder. From them, he learns his son had [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] after witnessing the explosion. Murphy pursues Vallon's gang to exact revenge. He takes heavy damage from their armor-piercing weapons but manages to kill Vallon and his men. Murphy returns to the station and joins with his old partner, Jack Lewis. They confront the two corrupt police officers who betrayed him to Vallon, shooting one and tasing the other. Learning that the [[Chief of police|Chief of Police]] was also involved, Murphy moves to arrest her but is remotely shut down by Mattox.\n\nWith the help of pro-OmniCorp talk show host Pat Novak, Sellars uses the incident to get the Dreyfus Act repealed. Clara goes to the press and fiercely demands to see her husband. Fearful of being exposed, Sellars orders Mattox to destroy RoboCop while being repaired and tricks Clara into thinking that Murphy died. Norton reaches him first and reveals the truth. RoboCop narrowly escapes from the building just as it undergoes a lockdown.\n\nMurphy returns and storms the building, fighting his way through the [[RoboCop (franchise)#ED-209|ED-209]] drones sent to stop him, while Lewis and his fellow police arrive to hold off the rest of OmniCorp's forces. Mattox subdues Murphy, preparing to finish him off, but is killed by Lewis. Murphy then makes his way to the roof where Sellars is waiting for a helicopter with Clara and David as hostages. Murphy's programming initially prevents him from arresting Sellars. However, he overcomes his programming long enough to kill Sellars when Sellars overconfidently taunts him.\n\nOmniCorp's parent company, [[Omni Consumer Products (RoboCop)|OCP]], shuts down the project. The [[President of the United States|President]] vetoes the repeal of the Dreyfus Act based on Norton's testimony, much to Novak's anger. Murphy's body is rebuilt in Norton's laboratory, and he waits for Clara and David, who are coming to visit him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Joel Kinnaman]] as [[Alexander James Murphy]], a young [[police detective]] who is injured in an explosion and transformed into the cyborg [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]] \n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Dr. Dennett Norton, Omni foundation chief scientist who creates RoboCop\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as Raymond Sellars, the [[CEO]] of OmniCorp\n* [[Abbie Cornish]] as Clara Murphy, Alex's wife\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as Rick Mattox, a drone controller and automated military tactician expert responsible for training RoboCop\n* [[Michael K.

Two further trailers were also released, one of which was uploaded to [[Yahoo!

I'm a fan of the original movie because it was ahead of its time both aesthetically and thematically.

So we already have the drones. Now we're going to have automated robots doing law enforcement and replacing soldiers in the battlefield. So we had a chance to make this movie and talk about this.\" Two main posters were released in late 2013, with one showing [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|CTBA]] complex in [[Madrid]].
