For his performance as Andrew Beckett, Hanks won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] at the [[66th Academy Awards]], while the song \"[[Streets of Philadelphia]]\" by [[Bruce Springsteen]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Nyswaner was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]], but lost to [[Jane Campion]] for ''[[The Piano]]''. It is notable for being one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to explicitly address [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[homophobia]], in addition to being one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to portray gay people in a positive light.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for films should be 400-700 words. -->\nAndrew Beckett is a senior [[Associate attorney|associate]] at the largest corporate law firm in Philadelphia: Wyant, Wheeler, Hellerman, Tetlow, and Brown. He conceals his homosexuality and his status as an [[AIDS]] patient from the other members of the firm. A partner in the firm notices a lesion on Beckett's forehead. Although Beckett attributes the lesion to a racquetball injury, it indicates [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], an AIDS-defining condition.\n\nShortly thereafter, Beckett stays home from work for several days to try to find a way to hide his lesions. While at home, he finishes the paperwork for a case he has been assigned and then brings it to his office, leaving instructions for his assistants to file the paperwork the following day, which marks the end of the [[statute of limitations]] for the case. Later that morning, he receives a call asking for the paperwork, as the paper copy cannot be found and there are no copies on the computer's hard drive. The paperwork is finally discovered in an alternative location and is filed with the court at the last possible moment. The following day, Beckett is dismissed by the firm's partners.\n\nBeckett believes that someone deliberately hid his paperwork to give the firm an excuse to fire him and that the dismissal is a result of his [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|diagnosis with AIDS]] as well as his sexuality. He asks ten attorneys to take his case, including African-American personal injury lawyer Joe Miller, whom Beckett previously opposed in an unrelated case. Miller appears to be worried that he could contract Beckett's illness. After declining to take the case, Miller immediately visits his doctor to find out if he could have contracted the disease. The doctor explains that the [[AIDS#Transmission|routes of HIV infection]] do not include casual contact.\n\nUnable to find a lawyer willing to represent him, Beckett is compelled to [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|act as his attorney]]. While researching a case at a law library, Miller sees Beckett at a nearby table. A librarian approaches Beckett and announces that he has found a case of AIDS discrimination for him. As others in the library begin to first stare uneasily, the librarian suggests Beckett go to a private room. Seeing the parallels in how he has faced [[Discrimination in the United States#Racism|discrimination due to his race]], Miller approaches Beckett, reviews the material he has gathered, and takes the case.\n\nAs the case goes before the court, the partners of the firm take the stand, each claiming that Beckett was incompetent and that he had deliberately tried to hide his condition. The defense repeatedly suggests that Beckett brought AIDS upon himself via gay sex, and is therefore not a victim. In the course of testimony, it is revealed that the partner who had noticed Beckett's lesion, Walter Kenton, had previously worked with a woman who had contracted AIDS [[AIDS#Body fluids|after a blood transfusion]] and so should have recognized the lesion as relating to AIDS.  According to Kenton, the woman was an innocent victim, unlike Beckett, and further testified that he did not recognize Beckett's lesions. To prove that the lesions would have been visible, Miller asks Beckett to unbutton his shirt while on the witness stand, revealing that his lesions are indeed visible and recognizable as such. Throughout the trial, Miller's homophobia slowly disappears as he and Beckett bond from working together.\n\nBeckett eventually collapses during the trial and is hospitalized. After this, another partner, Bob Seidman, who had also noticed Beckett's lesions, confesses that he suspected Beckett had AIDS but never told anyone and never allowed him to explain himself, which he regrets very much. During his hospitalization, the jury votes in Beckett's favor, awarding him back pay, damages for pain and suffering, and [[Punitive damages#United States|punitive damages]], totaling over $5 million. Miller visits the visibly failing Beckett in the hospital after the verdict and overcomes his fear enough to touch Beckett's face. After the family leaves the room, Beckett tells his partner Miguel Alvarez that he is \"ready.\" At the Miller home later that night, Miller and his wife are awakened by a phone call from Alvarez, who tells them that Beckett has died. A memorial is held at Beckett's family home following the funeral, where many mourners, including Miller and his family, view home movies of Beckett as a happy child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Andrew \"Andy\" Beckett\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Miller\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Charles Wheeler \n* [[Mary Steenburgen]] as Belinda Conine\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Miguel Alvarez\n* [[Joanne Woodward]] as Sarah Beckett\n* [[Robert W.

Family members asserted that 54 scenes in the movie were so similar to events in Bowers's life that some of them could only have come from their interviews.
