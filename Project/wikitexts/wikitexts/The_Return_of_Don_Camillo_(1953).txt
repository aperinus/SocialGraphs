It was the second of five films featuring Fernandel as the Italian priest [[Don Camillo]] and his struggles with Giuseppe 'Peppone' Bottazzi, the [[Communist]] [[Mayor]] of their rural town.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Don Camillo]] is exiled to a remote and bleak mountain parish by his bishop at the request of Peppone, the Communist mayor of a small Po Valley town named [[Brescello]]. But the mayor develops problems with the citizens of the town, who want Camillo back as parish priest. In addition, a flood threatens to destroy Brescello and its environs. So Peppone calls back the priest, and he tries to raise the money needed to prevent damage from the imminent flood. However, delays occur and the flood devastates the area. Don Camillo insists on remaining in the town as the townspeople flee to safety, but the film ends on a heart-warming note as the sun breaks out heralding the end of the flood.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fernandel]] as Don Camillo \n* [[Gino Cervi]] as Giuseppe 'Peppone' Bottazzi \n* [[\u00c9douard Delmont]] as Dr Spiletti \n* [[Paolo Stoppa]] as Marchetti  \n* [[Alexandre Rignault]] as Franceso 'Nero' Gallini  \n* [[Thomy Bourdelle]] as Cagnola  \n* [[Leda Gloria]] as Signora Bottazzi  \n* [[Charles Vissi\u00e8res]] as the Bishop  \n* [[Claudy Chapeland]] as Beppo Bottazzi \n* [[Tony Jacquot]] as Don Pietro  \n* [[Saro Urz\u00ec]] as Brusco the barber\n* [[Manuel Gary]]\n* [[Lia Di Leo]] as the schoolmistress \n* [[Marco Tulli]] as Lo Smilzo \n* [[Arturo Bragaglia]] as the roadworker (who gives Don Camillo a lift on his motorbike)   \n* [[Enzo Staiola]] as Mario Cagnola \n* [[Miranda Campa]] as Signora Spiletti\n\n==Reception==\nIt was the second most popular film of the year at the French box office in 1953.<ref>{{cite web|website=Box Office Story|title=1953 at the box office|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.boxofficestory.com/france-1948-c22733213&prev=search}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\n*''[[Don Camillo's Last Round]]'' (Italian: ''Don Camillo e l'onorevole Peppone''; French: ''La Grande Bagarre'')<ref>{{IMDb title|0048002|Don Camillo e l'on.
