It was distributed by [[Focus Features]], and it was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] on February 28, 2006, making it the last Focus Features film released on VHS format. ''The Ice Harvest'' grossed $10.2 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Christmas Eve]] in [[Wichita, Kansas]], mob lawyer Charlie Arglist and pornographer Vic Cavanaugh prepare to leave town after stealing $2 million from their boss, mobster Bill Guerrard. However, icy roads means their getaway is postponed. Vic holds the cash when they split up, biding their time until the roads clear.\n\nCharlie visits Sweet Cage, a local strip-club owned by Vic and run by Renata Crest, a woman whom Charlie has long lusted after. She quickly deduces he is hiding something. Charlie hints at the money, and she suggests they run away together. Taking advantage of the perceived situation, Renata asks Charlie to steal an incriminating photo of herself and a local politician from Vic.\n\nAfter talking to his friend Sidney, a bartender and bouncer at Sweet Cage, Charlie goes to another strip club owned by Vic, the Tease-O-Rama, and takes the photo from a safe. Before he can leave, Roy Gelles, one of Guerrard's enforcers, arrives looking for Charlie. Charlie hides in the men's restroom as Gelles enters. Roy reads aloud a limerick written in red [[Sharpie (marker)|sharpie]] on the wall above the urinal, \"As Wichita falls, so falls Wichita Falls\". After evading Gelles, Charlie goes to a local restaurant/bar, running into his friend Pete, who is married to Charlie's ex-wife Sarabeth. Pete is very drunk, and decides to tag along with Charlie for as long as it takes to pass out. Charlie calls Vic from a pay phone, seeing the same red Sharpie limerick above the phone. He frantically tells Vic that Gelles is in town, but Vic dismisses this, as Gelles has family in Wichita.\n\nCharlie returns to Sweet Cage and gives Renata the photo. She tells him that Vic had called to warn Charlie that Roy Gelles was indeed tailing them. Charlie takes Pete home only for Pete to vomit in Charlie's car and then pass out on the living room floor. Charlie then \"borrows\" a Mercedes Benz that Pete bought for Sarabeth, and goes to Vic's home. He finds Vic's wife next to their Christmas tree shot in the head. Vic arrives and reveals that he's locked Roy in a large trunk. They take Roy and Vic's wife in the Mercedes and drive to a local lake, while Roy continues yelling at them from the trunk, claiming that it was Vic who shot his wife. Vic gets annoyed and shoots the trunk, silencing him.\n\nAs Charlie and Vic get the trunk onto the lake dock, it's shot open from the inside by Gelles, with Vic being shot in the process. After Gelles gets out of the trunk a standoff ends with Roy dead and Vic falling into the frozen lake as the dock collapses. Charlie realizes that Vic was going to kill him, so he drags Vic's wife to the collapsed dock and slides her into the lake, knocking the pleading Vic underwater. When Charlie discovers the money isn't in Vic's bag, he runs back to the dock to save Vic, but he has already gone under in the freezing water, entwined with his dead wife.\n\nReturning to Sweet Cage, Charlie finds that Guerrard himself has come to town, and has tied up Renata. A struggle ensues, ending with Guerrard's death. Charlie and Renata go back to her place, where he finds the money hidden in her closet while Renata showers. Via flashbacks, it is revealed that Vic and Renata planned to run away together after killing Charlie. Charlie shoots her before she can cut his throat with a hidden straight razor.\n\nAs Charlie is driving out of town with the money, he sees Sidney on the side of the road with his kids in a motor home, and Charlie stops to offer assistance. Sidney says that he is out of gas, so Charlie lets him syphon some out of the \"borrowed\" Mercedes. As Sidney is trying to restart the RV, Charlie takes out a red Sharpie and writes \"As Wichita falls, so falls Wichita Falls\" on the back of the motor home, revealing it was Charlie who had been writing the limerick all over town. Sidney gets the motor home started, and after accidentally knocking Charlie down when the RV lurches backwards, he drives away.\n\nCharlie gets up and returns to the \"borrowed\" Mercedes. Pete wakes up in the back seat, and the duo drive away together for warmer weather.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Cusack]] as Charlie Arglist\n*[[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Vincent 'Vic' Cavanaugh\n*[[Connie Nielsen]] as Renata Crest \n*[[Randy Quaid]] as Bill Guerrard\n*[[Oliver Platt]] as Pete Van Heuten\n*[[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Roy Gelles\n*[[Ned Bellamy]] as Sidney\n*[[T.J.

Ramis almost had to close production for a day due to the weather, which would have spoiled his tradition of never losing a shooting day.\n\nFilming took place in the suburbs of [[Chicago]].<ref>[https://www.itsfilmedthere.com/2010/12/ice-harvest.html The Ice Harvest Filming Locations]</ref>\n\nThe DVD 'extras' consist of:\n\n* Alternate ending, number 1: has Charlie getting injured when Ned backs into him, then eventually walking away into an empty field.\n* Alternate ending, number 2: also has Charlie getting injured when Ned backs into him, but as he lays there, he recalls a day in Renata\u2019s bar with Vic, when Vic asks Renata if she ever performs nude for her customers, as Charlie is curious. Renata asks Charlie if that\u2019s what he wants, and he replies, \u2018Gosh, only if ''you'' want to.\u2019 She admonishes them to go home, but they talk a bit, and then Charlie pitches his \u2018idea\u2019 to Vic. Charlie is then back in the present, walking away into the empty field.\n* A short outtake performed by Thornton in his ''[[Sling Blade]]'' character 'Karl Childers' persona (voice), to the amusement and laughter of the assembled cast and crew.\n* A 17-minute featurette about the film, with author Phillips and screenwriters Russo and Benton.\n* A 13-minute featurette about the film, with the principal cast, director, and producers, about the character's motivations and personalities, Ramis\u2019s reasons for using Chicago (his home town) suburb locations to represent Wichita Falls, the film noir aspects of the picture, and cinematographer Kivilo\u2019s choice of colors used and captured on film.\n* A 6-minute featurette about the lake/dock scene \u2013 how it was constructed and filmed and what and how special effects were used, including using paraffin to represent ice.\n* Director\u2019s commentary.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Ice Harvest'' opened in 1,550 theaters in North America and grossed $3.7 million, averaging $2,413 per theater and ranking 10th at the box office. The film ultimately earned $9 million in the US and $1.1 million internationally for a total of $10.2 million.<ref name=mojo/>\n\nThe film has a rating of 47% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 134 reviews and an average rating of 5.50/10. The consensus states: \"''The Ice Harvest'' offers a couple of laughs, but considering the people involved, it should be a lot funnier.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ice_harvest/|title=The Ice Harvest|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 16, 2021}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 62 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ice-harvest|title=The Ice Harvest Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 16, 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[James Berardinelli]] of ''Reelviews'' gave the film 2 and a half stars out of four, saying, \"Despite its brevity, it seems padded, with all sorts of irrelevant scenes and dead-end subplots taking up time. [...] Next time, Ramis should work to his strengths, and film noir isn't one of them. The Ice Harvest will have melted away long before the turkey leftovers are polished off.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ice Harvest|work=Reelviews|authorlink=James Berardinelli|first=James|last=Berardinelli|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/i/ice_harvest.html}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and said: \"I liked the movie for the quirky way it pursues humor through the drifts of greed, lust, booze, betrayal and spectacularly complicated ways to die. I liked it for Charlie's essential kindness, as when he pauses during a getaway to help a friend who has run out of gas. And for the scene-stealing pathos of Oliver Platt's drunk, who like many drunks in the legal profession achieves a rhetorical grandiosity during the final approach to oblivion. And I liked especially the way Roy, the man in the trunk, keeps on thinking positively, even after Vic puts bullets through both ends of the trunk because he can't remember which end of the trunk Roy's head is at. Maybe it's in the middle.\"<ref>{{cite web|work=Rogerebert.com|title=The Ice Harvest|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-ice-harvest-2005|date=November 22, 2005|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Christmas films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.theiceharvest.com}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{Amg movie|305102|The Ice Harvest}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Mojo title|id=iceharvest|title=The Ice Harvest}}\n\n{{Harold Ramis}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ice Harvest, The}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2000s Christmas films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American Christmas films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Kansas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Focus Features films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Harold Ramis]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Kitay]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Benton]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
