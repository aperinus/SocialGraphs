Webber|Bernard \"Bernie\" Webber]], a crewman at [[Coast Guard Station Chatham]], Massachusetts, on [[Cape Cod]], has fallen in love with a local girl, Miriam Pentinen.  The two plan to marry on April 16, but in accordance with Coast Guard regulations, Bernie must seek permission from the station's commanding officer, [[Daniel Webster Cluff|Daniel Cluff]], although it is usually just a formality. On the day he is due to ask permission, February 18, 1952, the oil tanker {{SS|Pendleton}} shears in half off the Chatham coast after getting caught in a [[nor'easter]]. With the majority of the station's crew already underway with the rescue of the similarly damaged {{SS|Fort Mercer}}, Bernie is dispatched to pilot [[Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat CG 36500|motor lifeboat ''CG 36500'']] to rescue the crew of ''Pendleton''. Andrew Fitzgerald, Ervin Maske, and Richard P. Livesey volunteer to join Bernie on the rescue mission.\n\nMeanwhile, the ''Pendleton''{{'}}s engineer, Ray Sybert, as the surviving senior officer, organizes the surviving seamen to steer the sinking stern of the tanker onto a submerged [[reef]], where it can lodge until rescuers arrive. Miriam learns that Bernie is leading the rescue effort and believes it to be a suicide mission. Few people in Chatham trust Cluff, believing him to be incapable of doing his job because he is not from the area. Miriam drives to the station, demanding that Cluff call Bernie back. Cluff refuses, and brusquely orders Miriam out.\n\nBetween Chatham Harbor and the open sea lies a bar, a series of [[shoal]]s that are very dangerous even in good weather. Bernie must time bursts of his engine to ride each approaching wave before it breaks as he pilots ''CG 36500'' across the bar. Although he makes it over the bar, he loses his compass.\n\nBernie steers ''CG 36500'' to the stricken tanker. Although his boat's designated capacity is only 12 people, Bernie manages to rescue 32 crewmen. The stern of ''Pendleton'' begins sinking more rapidly during the rescue and goes down shortly after the last crewman comes aboard Bernie's boat.  Relying on his knowledge of the coast and prevailing winds in place of his compass, Bernie steers ''CG 36500'' toward home\u2014a task made more difficult as Chatham loses power. Miriam and the other townspeople drive their cars to the pier and turn on their headlights to guide Bernie in.\n\nThe end of the film shows photographs from the event that briefly document the aftermath of the rescue. Two months later, Bernie and Miriam marry; they stay together for 58 years until Bernie's death in 2009. Bernie Webber and his crew receive the [[Gold Lifesaving Medal]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chris Pine]] as [[Boatswain's mate (United States Coast Guard)|Boatswain's Mate]] [[Petty officer first class|First Class]] [[Bernard C.
