His neighborhood is terrorized by a local gang called ''The Golden Lords'', led by  Simon Caine ([[Roy Fegan]]) and allied with drug lord Anthony Byers ([[Frank Gorshin]]). One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green [[meteorite]]. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] named Marvin ([[Bill Cosby]]). Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries.\n\nJeff soon discovered that the meteorite had left him with spectacular superpowers such as flight, x-ray/laser vision, superhuman strength, speed, and hearing, invulnerability, healing powers, the ability to absorb a book's content by touch, super breath, telepathy with [[dog]]s (which he uses to communicate with his own dog Ellington), and [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]]. Confiding this to his parents Ted ([[Robert Guillaume]]) and Maxine ([[Marla Gibbs]]), they convince him to use his powers to help the community. His mother designs a costume and as the Meteor Man, he takes on the Golden Lords. He shuts down 15 crack houses, stops 11 robberies, brings peace between the police, the [[Crips]] ([[Cypress Hill]]), and the [[Bloods]] ([[Naughty by Nature]]) where they begin to work together to rebuild the community they destroyed, and plants a giant garden in the middle of the ghetto.\n\nThe Golden Lords learn Meteor Man's secret identity and his slowly diminishing powers. As the violence gets out of hand and the Golden Lords continue their attacks, the community members plan to make a deal with them, but Jeff instead teaches them about fighting for their beliefs. A now-powerless Jeff fights Simon and is beaten up. Simon points his gun at Jeff, but Jeff's neighbor Earnest Moses ([[James Earl Jones]]) throws a record at him, successfully knocking the gun out of Simon's hand. Suddenly, Marvin uses the meteor fragment to strip the Golden Lords of their guns. This enables the locals to stand up to the Golden Lords as they fight them alongside Marvin's dogs. Marvin accidentally drops the meteor and both Jeff and Simon grab the rock from both sides, gaining [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], and engage in a brawl.\n\nWhen Simon is about to throw a dumpster at Jeff, he hears Ellington barking, telling Jeff that he can win, and throws the dumpster at Ellington instead, seriously injuring him. This angers Jeff and he disappears and returns as Meteor Man. They continue with their brawl with Meteor Man winning and draining Simon of his powers by absorbing them. He then defeats the rest of the Golden Lords. The locals all gather around Ellington who is now lying on the street, whimpering in pain. Jeff uses his x-ray vision to see that Ellington's ribs are broken. Before Jeff can do anything, his powers fade away, again. But just then, Marvin comes over and uses the last of his powers from the meteor fragment to heal Ellington's injuries, thus saving Ellington's life. The locals all applaud.\n\nAnthony Byers and his gang then confront Meteor Man, but are out-numbered by the Bloods and the Crips who show up to protect Meteor Man. Anthony Byers and his gang are then arrested by the police after attempting to \"take a vacation to the [[Bahamas]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]] as Jefferson Reed/Meteor Man\n* [[Marla Gibbs]] as Maxine Reed, Jefferson's mother\n* [[Eddie Griffin]] as Michael Anderson, Jefferson's friend\n* [[Robert Guillaume]] as Ted Reed, Jefferson's father\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Earnest Moses, Jefferson's neighbor\n* [[Bill Cosby]] as Marvin, a mute [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]\n* [[Another Bad Creation]] as Jr. Lords, the children members of the Golden Lords\n* [[Stephanie E.
