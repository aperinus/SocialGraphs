B. Rogers]], written by Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow, and starring [[Heather Graham]] and [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] as two young lovers who come to believe that they are actually siblings.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial failure, grossing a little over $12 million on a $25 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nGilly Noble takes a stray cat named \"[[Ringo Starr|Ringo]]\" to the animal shelter where he works in [[Shelbyville, Indiana]]. Gilly gets his hair cut by a beautiful young aspiring hairdresser named Jo Wingfield. As Jo cuts Gilly's hair, she mentions that she recently lost a tail-less cat named Ringo, leading Gilly to tell her that Ringo is at the pound. The excitement causes Jo to accidentally cut off a part of Gilly's ear, and he is rushed to the hospital where the ear is reattached. To make up for the incident, Jo invites Gilly to her house for lunch the next day, where Gilly meets Jo's greedy, self-centered mother, Valdine, and invalid father, Walter.\n\nGilly and Jo date for six months before getting engaged, but suddenly a private detective, Vic Vetter, contacts Gilly to tell him that he's Valdine and Walter's son. After Gilly and Jo end their incestuous relationship, Gilly moves in with his new family, and Jo moves to [[Beaver, Oregon]] to start a new life. After being branded a \"sister-fucker\", Gilly loses his job at the animal shelter and is forced to take a job removing roadkill for the highway department.\n\nSixteen months later, a surprise comes to the Wingfield doorstep in the form of a young man named Leon Pitofsky, who claims to be Valdine and Walter's son and presents his birth certificate as proof. Valdine and Walter feel better for a few moments before angrily lashing out at Gilly and forcing him to leave. Valdine notifies the Beaver police that Gilly is a sex offender. Gilly runs for his life and decides to go to Oregon to inform Jo. On the way to Oregon, he befriends a pilot [[Prosthesis|with two prosthetic legs]] named Dig.\n\nMeanwhile, Jo becomes engaged to her ex-boyfriend Jack Mitchelson, a rich and powerful young man who secretly deals in [[marijuana]], controls over half the town by paying off numerous politicians, and cheats on Jo with his ex-girlfriend, a local cop named Gina. Valdine keeps pushing Jo to marry Jack in order to become involved with Jack's wealth, although Jo still loves Gilly. Valdine keeps Leon secluded and tells Jo that Leon is a figment of Gilly's imagination. Gilly tries to hide from the authorities, and Dig frequently aids him in his escape from Jack's henchmen.\n\nUltimately, Gilly is not able to stop Jo from marrying Jack, who still believes that Gilly is her brother. Police arrive at the marriage scene to inform the family that Gilly died in a car accident, which was actually an act of sabotage by Leon who has been arrested. Jo learns the truth and ends her marriage which causes Valdine to attack Leon and have a stroke. It's also revealed that Jack was behind Valdine and Walter being misidentified as Gilly's parents. But unknown to everyone, Gilly was not driving the car at the time of the accident when it was actually one of Jack's henchmen Streak. Gilly, who has just returned to working at the animal shelter, sees Jo and mistakenly believes that she wants to commit suicide. They are finally reunited on the roof of the same animal shelter that was a catalyst for their coming together.\n\nA few months later, Gilly and Jo are married, and Walter, Valdine, Leon, Dig, and many other people attend, with Walter on his feet and Valdine in a wheelchair after her stroke. Also, as a surprise wedding present, Vetter arrives and tells him that he has truly found his mother. In an ironic twist, Gilly's mother turns out to be [[Suzanne Somers]], whom Gilly used to fantasize about while masturbating.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Josephine \"Jo\" Wingfield\n* [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] as Gilbert \"Gilly\" Noble\n* [[Orlando Jones]] as Dig McCaffrey\n* [[Sally Field]] as Valdine Wingfield\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Walter Wingfield\n* [[John Rothman]] as Larry Falwell\n* [[Jack Plotnick]] as Leon Pitofsky\n* [[Eddie Cibrian]] as Jack Mitchelson\n* [[Mark Pellegrino]] as Jimmy Mitchelson\n* [[Henry Cho]] as Freddy\n* Brent Hinkley as Streak\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as Sheriff Merle Hobbs\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as Detective Vic Vetter\n* [[Ezra Buzzington]] as Stewart\n* [[Julie White]] as Ruthie Falwell\n* [[Courtney Peldon]] as Cher Falwell\n* Matthew Peters as Buddy Falwell\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Nurse Bautista\n* [[C.

Even then, it's best if they don't know what they've done wrong--if the joke's on them, and they don't get it. [...] \"Say It Isn't So,\" on the other hand, keeps a character embarrassed in scene after scene, until he becomes an...embarrassment. The movie doesn't understand that embarrassment comes in a sudden painful flush of realization; drag it out, and it's not embarrassment anymore, but public humiliation, which is a different condition, and not funny.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/say-it-isnt-so-2001|title=Say It Isn't So|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|date=March 23, 2001|access-date=October 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121092820/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/say-it-isnt-so-2001|archive-date=January 21, 2021|url-status=live|via=[[RogerEbert.com]]}} {{Rating|1|4}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Desson Howe]] noted that \"When the Farrelly Brothers made \"Dumb and Dumber,\" \"[[There's Something About Mary]]\" and \"[[Me, Myself & Irene]],\" the message was: Comedy doesn't get lower than this.
