WALL-E runs his hand through the [[Rings of Saturn]] in passing, and dislodges a tiny rock, which gains enough momentum to become a [[meteor]]. It crashes into and destroys one of the running lights (known as \"spires\") on the ''Axiom's'' hull.\n\nThe Autopilot (AUTO) is alerted by the ship's computer of the needed repair, and activates a SUPPLY-R robot, who in turn activates BURN-E. He is given his welding torch and an intact spire, [[Lockout-tagout|shuts down]] the broken spire, and travels via a special track onto the ship's hull to complete the repair. However, he is distracted by WALL-E's arrival, and inadvertently lets the spire float away into space. SUPPLY-R gives him a second one, but he accidentally cuts it in half when an exploding escape pod (which WALL-E was inside of) startles him.\n\nIrritated by this second failure, SUPPLY-R drops the third and final spare light on the floor, leaving BURN-E to pick it up. He successfully repairs the light, but before he can bring it online, he is accidentally locked out by WALL-E and EVE, who fly indoors after a dance in space around the ''Axiom'' and close the door behind them.\n\nBURN-E tries to find another way in, including through open garbage [[airlock]], but all attempts fail. Finally, he realizes he can use his welding torch to cut a new entrance in the hull of the ''Axiom'', and does so. However, he is flung back outside when the fight between the Captain and AUTO causes the ship to list violently to [[starboard]]. He catches hold of the spire, and is able to get back on his track as the ship turns upright again, but the Captain sends the ''Axiom'' into a [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperjump]], pinning BURN-E against the hull before he can reenter the ship.\n\nWhen the ''Axiom'' lands on Earth, BURN-E goes to find SUPPLY-R so he can hit the button to bring the spire back online, but she is gone. He hunts through the deserted ''Axiom'', and finds the humans and robots are all outside when he looks through the window of an escape pod. He accidentally jettisons the pod, and crashes to Earth; flinging the pod door open so hard that it flies into the air, he runs to SUPPLY-R and finally brings the spire back online, only to swoon when the door crashes into the spire and destroys it. The credits roll, to a recording of [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ode to Joy]]''.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], SUPPLY-R pats BURN-E on the head and attempts to comfort him with a monotone \"There, there\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Angus MacLane]] as BURN-E\n* Tessa Swigart as SUPPLY-R\n* [[Ben Burtt]] as WALL-E (uncredited)\n* [[Elissa Knight]] as EVE (uncredited)\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Captain B.
