It stars [[Bill Murray]], [[Andie MacDowell]], and [[Chris Elliott]]. Murray portrays Phil Connors, a cynical television weatherman covering the annual [[Groundhog Day]] event in [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]], who becomes trapped in a [[time loop]], forcing him to relive February{{nbsp}}2nd repeatedly. The film also stars [[Stephen Tobolowsky]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], [[Marita Geraghty]], [[Angela Paton]], [[Rick Ducommun]], [[Rick Overton]], and [[Robin Duke]].\n\nRubin conceived the outline of ''Groundhog Day'' in the early 1990s. He wrote it as a [[spec script]] to gain meetings with producers for other work. It eventually came to the attention of Ramis, who worked with Rubin to make his idea less dark in tone and more palatable to a general audience by enhancing the comedy. After being cast, Murray clashed with Ramis over the script; Murray wanted to focus on the philosophical elements, whereas Ramis had concentrated on the comic aspects. [[Principal photography]] took place from March to June{{nbsp}}1992 almost entirely in [[Woodstock, Illinois]]. Filming was difficult, in part because of bitterly cold weather, but also because of the ongoing conflict between Ramis and Murray.\n\n''Groundhog Day'' was considered a box-office success on its release, earning over $105{{nbsp}}million to become one of the highest-grossing films of 1993. It also received generally positive reviews. Reviewers were consistent in praise for the film's successful melding of highly sentimental and deeply cynical moments, and for the philosophical message beneath the comedy. It received multiple award nominations and won a [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. For all its success, the film marked the end of Ramis's and Murray's long collaborative partnership, which produced films like ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980) and ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984). The pair did not speak after filming until shortly before Ramis's death in 2014. The film was a showcase for Murray; previously seen only as a comic actor, his performance led to more serious lead roles in critically acclaimed films.\n\nIn the years since its release, the film has grown in esteem and is often considered to be among the greatest films of the 1990s and one of the greatest comedy movies ever. It also had a significant impact on popular culture; the term ''Groundhog Day'' became part of the English [[lexicon]], meaning a monotonous, unpleasant, and repetitive situation. The film has been analyzed as a religious allegory by Buddhists, Christians, and Jews. ''Groundhog Day'' is also credited with the mainstream acceptance of comedy films featuring fantasy genre elements. In 2006, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. ''Groundhog Day'' has been adapted into [[Groundhog Day (musical)|a 2016 musical]] and a 2019 video game sequel, ''Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son''.\n\n==Plot==\nOn February 1, television weatherman Phil Connors reassures his [[Pittsburgh]] viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss [[Western Pennsylvania]]. Alongside his producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry, Phil travels to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania|Punxsutawney]] for his annual coverage of the [[Groundhog Day]] festivities. He makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there, asserting that he will soon be leaving his station for a new job.\n\n[[File:Groundhog day movie 1992 location 2007-03-18 IMG 4313.JPG|thumb|left|A private home used for exteriors of the Cherry Street Inn, the fictional location in which Phil awakens every morning in the film.|alt=A white house with green roof. It is set back from a lawn and surrounded by bare trees]]\nOn February 2, Phil awakens in the Cherry Tree Inn to [[Sonny & Cher]]'s \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" playing on the clock radio. He gives a half-hearted report on the [[groundhog]] [[Punxsutawney Phil]] and the festivities. Contrary to his prediction, the blizzard strikes the area, preventing all travel out of Punxsutawney, and although he desperately searches for a way to leave, he is forced to spend the night in the town.\n\nThe next morning, Phil wakes once more to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio. Phil experiences the previous day's events repeating exactly and believes he is experiencing [[d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]]. He again unsuccessfully attempts to leave the town and retires to bed. When he awakes, it is again February 2. Phil gradually realizes that he is trapped in a [[time loop]] that no one else is aware of. He confides his situation to Rita, who directs him to a neurologist, who in turn directs him to a psychologist; neither can explain his experiences. Phil gets drunk with locals Gus and Ralph and then leads police on a high-speed car chase before being arrested and imprisoned. The next morning, Phil awakens in the Cherry Tree Inn.\n\nRealizing that there are no consequences for his actions, Phil begins spending loops indulging in binge eating, one-night stands, robbery, and other dangerous activities, using his increasing knowledge of the day's events and the town residents to manipulate circumstances to his advantage. Eventually, he focuses on seducing Rita, using the loops to learn more about her so that he can try to sleep with her. No matter what steps he takes, Rita rebuffs his advances, particularly when Phil tells her he loves her; Rita asserts that he does not even know her.\n\nPhil gradually becomes depressed and desperate for a way to escape the loop. He commits suicide in a variety of ways, even kidnapping Punxsutawney Phil and driving them both off a cliff. Each time, he reawakens on February{{nbsp}}2 to \"I Got You Babe\". He eventually tries to explain his situation to Rita again, using his detailed knowledge of the day to accurately predict events. Convinced, Rita spends the rest of that day's loop with Phil; she encourages him to think of the loops as a blessing instead of a curse. Lying on the bed together at night, Phil realizes that his feelings for Rita have become sincere. He wakes alone on February{{nbsp}}2. Phil decides to use his knowledge of the loop to change himself and others: he saves people from deadly accidents and misfortunes, and learns to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French. Regardless of his actions, he is unable to save a homeless old man from dying of natural causes.\n\nDuring one iteration of the loop, Phil reports on the Groundhog Day festivities with such eloquence that other news crews stop working to listen to his speech, amazing Rita. Phil continues his day helping the people of Punxsutawney. That night, Rita witnesses Phil's expert piano-playing skills as the adoring townsfolk regale her with stories of his good deeds. Impressed by his apparent overnight transformation, Rita successfully bids for him at a charity bachelor auction. Phil carves an ice sculpture in Rita's image and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue waking alone each morning forever, he wants her to know that he is finally happy because he loves her. They share a kiss and retire to Phil's room. Phil wakes the next morning to \"I Got You Babe\", but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter has changed; it is now February{{nbsp}}3rd. Phil tells Rita that he wants to live in Punxsutawney with her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = [[Bill Murray]] (left) in 2018, and [[Andie MacDowell]] in 2017\n| image1 = Bill Murray-8882.jpg\n| alt1 = A 2018 image of actor Bill Murray\n| image2 = Andie MacDowell Cannes 2017.jpg\n| alt2 = A 2017 image of actress Andie MacDowell in Cannes\n}}\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Rita Hanson\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Larry the cameraman\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Ned Ryerson\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Buster Green\n* [[Marita Geraghty]] as Nancy Taylor\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Mrs. Lancaster\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Gus\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Ralph\n* [[Robin Duke]] as Doris the waitress\n\nAs well as the main cast, ''Groundhog Day'' features [[Ken Hudson Campbell]] as the man in the hotel hallway, [[David Pasquesi]] as Phil's psychiatrist, and [[Richard Henzel]] and Rob Riley as the radio hosts waking Phil every morning.

He had moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter. While waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading [[Anne Rice]]'s book ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]'' (1985).<ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/><ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rubin began musing about vampiric immortality and what one would do with their time if it was limitless. He reasoned that vampires were like normal people who did not need to adhere to ordinary rules or moral boundaries.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> He questioned if and when immortality would become boring or pointless, and how a person would change over time, especially if they were incapable of substantial change.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He singled out men he deemed to be in [[arrested development]], who could not outlive their adolescence.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nHaving recently sold his first script for what would become the thriller film ''[[Hear No Evil (1993 film)|Hear No Evil]]'' (1993), his agent prompted him to develop a \"calling-card\" script that he could use to gain meetings with producers. Rubin began work on his idea of a man changing over eternal life but quickly realized that the idea was impractical because of the expense of depicting historical and future events. At this point, Rubin recalled a brief story concept he had written two years earlier that followed a man who would wake every morning to find it was the same day repeating. Rubin married the two ideas to create the outline for ''Groundhog Day''. By portraying eternity as a repeating cycle instead of a straight line through history, he eliminated the production cost of constantly changing settings.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He believed that the repetition also offered him more dramatic and comedic possibilities.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin opened a calendar and picked the next nearest holiday, February{{nbsp}}2, Groundhog Day. He saw it as a date with story potential because it was a recognized holiday without much widespread attention. Rubin believed that people were vaguely aware of the holiday, on which a groundhog predicts the coming of spring. Even so, he believed few people outside Pennsylvania were aware that the actual festival takes place in the small town of Punxsutawney, something he became aware of through a writing job for a local phone company.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> Setting the story in Punxsutawney provided a small area in which to trap Phil Connors, while reporting on the event gave the character a reason to visit. Rubin took the main character's name from Punxsutawney Phil.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He hoped the film could become a perennial holiday favorite like ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) and ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' (1965).<ref name=\"VultureRubin\"/><ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/>\n\nRubin spent eight weeks working on the story: seven making notes to define the rules and characters, and one writing the script.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> He struggled to establish a cause for the time loop, considering technological, magical, and celestial origins. He considered these methods interchangeable and felt the cause was unimportant and could detract from the story elements he wanted to focus on. Rubin said that the lack of explanation made Phil's situation more relatable, as \"none of us knows exactly how we got stuck here either.\"<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He chose to begin the story ''[[in medias res]]'', with Phil already caught in the time loop.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> The first scene included Phil waking to \"I Got You Babe,\" predicting the radio host banter and the actions of the hotel patrons, and attacking a pedestrian outside. Rubin thought this would intrigue an audience trying to understand how and why he is doing these things.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> He chose \"I Got You Babe\" because it used a lot of repeating lines and was about love, which he felt were thematically resonant aspects.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=34}} He likened his original script to the 1949 British [[black comedy]] film ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'', particularly the flippant way in which Phil's multiple suicides are shown.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/>\n\nRubin did not initially write the film as a broad comedy, considering it more whimsical. He found that the funnier elements were the easiest to think of; one of the earliest scenes he wrote was about Phil using his ever-increasing knowledge to seduce women.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Loops were also dedicated to Phil seeing how far he could get outside of Punxsutawney; inevitably, he was always returned to the town.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=65}} Even so, the script focused much more on Phil's loneliness. He breaks the loop only after realizing that there are other lonely people and that he can do good deeds to make them happier. Scenes in the finished film happened much earlier in Rubin's script, such as Phil driving over a cliff. The passage of time was also more distinct; Phil would track it by reading one page of a book per day, reaching his low point when he realizes he has run out of books. The original ending also featured a twist: Phil breaks his loop and then confesses his love to Rita. The perspective then becomes Rita's; she rejects Phil's advance because she is not ready for love and gets trapped in a loop of her own.<ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/>\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Harold Ramis Oct 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|Director and writer [[Harold Ramis]] in 2009]]\nRubin's agent used the script to arrange meetings with producers; although it did not sell, the meetings generated other work for him.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> In 1991, after his agent left the industry, Rubin distributed the ''Groundhog Day'' script in an effort to secure a new representative. It came to the attention of Richard Lovett at [[Creative Arts Agency]].<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/> Lovett said that he could not represent Rubin but passed the script to his own client, Harold Ramis.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nBy the early 1990s, Ramis had begun moving away from involvement in the anti-establishment and anti-institutional comedies, such as ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980) and ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' (1983), that had defined his earlier career.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/> While Ramis had successes in front of the camera and in creative roles like writing, his last directorial effort, ''[[Club Paradise]]'' (1986), had been a critical and commercial failure.<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/><ref name=\"JamaicaObserver\"/><ref name=\"AVClubParadise\"/> He wanted to direct an unusual project and was particularly interested in comedies about redemption and discovering one's purpose in life.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/> Rubin was aware of Ramis's previous work, having watched him in film and television.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/>\n\nRamis admitted that he did not laugh while reading Rubin's script. He was interested in the underlying spirituality and romance present, but thought it needed more humor.<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/> The pair discussed the core ideas in the script, raising parallels between it and the concepts of Buddhism and reincarnation.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> They also discussed whether it was ethical for [[Superman]]\u2014a superhuman being with the power to save the lives of countless people and prevent disasters\u2014to effectively waste time on adventures with his partner [[Lois Lane]].<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/>\n\nRubin's script became the subject of two offers: one arranged by Ramis through [[Columbia Pictures]] that would grant his project a higher budget, but at the cost of creative control, and a smaller independent studio that offered a lower budget of $3{{nbsp}}million, but would let Rubin retain his original concept. Rubin chose to go with Ramis's deal. As expected, the studio wanted changes.<ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nRubin admitted to becoming defensive about the studio's changes. He was concerned that they would remove what he saw as innovative plot points and turn it into a generic comedy film.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> Ramis supervised the rewrite,<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/> tasked with balancing Rubin's desire for originality and the studio's demand for a broad comedy.<ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/> The pair loosely used the [[K\u00fcbler-Ross model]] of the five stages of grief\u2014denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance\u2014as an outline.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=49}}<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/> Ramis imagined himself in Phil's situation and the things he would do and feel if in the same cycle of entrapment.<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/> The pair spent weeks revising the script.<ref name=\"VultureRubin\"/> Ramis suggested that Rubin's original ending, with Rita trapped in her own loop, be removed. He felt that audiences would dislike this as it offered no [[catharsis]].<ref name=\"new yorker\"/><ref name=\"Mentalfloss\"/> Similarly, he felt it was important to retain the story's darker elements, such as Phil's suicides, as these compensated for the necessary sentimental moments.<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/>\n\nRubin delivered a fresh draft on February 2, 1991.<ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/> He was contractually permitted to write another draft, but the studio had Ramis take over, bringing Rubin's involvement to an end.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|pp=16\u201317, 22}} Ramis took Rubin's new draft and began his solo rewrite.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/> He found the sentimentality and sincerity completely opposed to everything he had learned to do as a comedian, and deliberately tempered the sweeter moments with a cynical and grouchy tone.<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/> Ramis reorganized the script into a mainstream three-act narrative.<ref name=\"uproxx rift\"/> He emphasized Phil's smug attitude as a means of distancing himself from others, giving him a defined story arc as a classic comedic lead character deserving of his punishment.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/> Ramis liked Rubin's concept of starting with the loop in progress, but associate producer Whitney White suggested starting the film before the loop begins because she thought it would be more interesting for the audience to see Phil's initial reaction to his predicament.<ref name=\"TheWrapGypsy\"/>{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=16}}\n\nRamis also removed Rita's boyfriend, Max, and introduced (then removed) Phil's executive producer, Gil Hawley.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|pp=16\u201317}} This draft featured more scenes focused on Phil's sexual conquests{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=21}} and removed some content deemed more mean-spirited, like Phil asking Rita to be his \"love slave.\" The situation was reversed in the final version of the film, in which Rita buys Phil at the bachelor auction, claiming that she owns him.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|pp=16\u201317}} Phil's journeys outside Punxsutawney were excised, as Ramis did not want the audience becoming too focused on what the rules of the loop were and felt that keeping the story within the town made it more claustrophobic.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=66}} Phil's [[exposition (narrative)|expositional narration]] was removed as well.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/>{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=16}} Also excised were more scenes of Phil's later good deeds and the clever methods he used to prevent accidents while making the most efficient use of his time. For example, Phil puts a large rock in a road to stop a truck delivering fish on which a restaurant patron would have later choked.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=76}} Where Rubin's original script had been more sermonic and deprecating, Ramis made the tone more optimistic.<ref name=\"TheWrapGypsy\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/> Two versions of a scene with Phil and Rita in a diner from Rubin's original script (left) and Ramis's rewrite (right) exemplify the shift of emphasis toward both Phil's smugness and the romantic core of the film:<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/>\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Rubin's original script'''{{br}}\n'''PHIL''' (voice over) \"And me and Rita\u2014together\u2014was the most obvious thing in the world...\"<br />\n'''PHIL''' \"Have you ever felt like you were reliving the same day over and over again?\" <br />\n'''RITA''' \"Like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\" <br />\n'''PHIL''' \"More like\u2014d\u00e9j\u00e0, d\u00e9j\u00e0, d\u00e9j\u00e0, d\u00e9j\u00e0...\" <br />\n'''RITA''' \"So, you still think you've been here before?\" ''Phil nods.'' <br />\n'''RITA''' \"And how does this evening turn out?\" <br />\n'''PHIL''' \"I'll tell you what I do know.

Rubin returned the script with pages of honest and sometimes sarcastic notes. In response, Murray recommended fully rehiring Rubin to assist on the script.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=22}}\n\nThe studio refused to [[green-light|greenlight]] the project without making explicit why Phil becomes trapped.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"TheWrapGypsy\"/> Producer Trevor Albert described a Columbia executive saying, \"Why does the day repeat?...

When Ramis called to check on their progress, Murray asked Rubin to pretend he was not there.<ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/> The pair visited the 1992 Punxsutawney Groundhog Day festival to get a better understanding of the event, remaining discreet and not revealing the reason for their visit.<ref name=\"PhillyPunxVisit\"/><ref name=\"morning call\"/> They then spent weeks working together in New York City revising the script.<ref name=\"VultureRubin\"/>{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|pp=22\u201323}} Rubin found Murray's more laid-back approach to writing \"frustrating.\"{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=23}} They were still working on the script a month before filming began, bringing it back closer to Rubin's original.<ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/>\n\nRubin and Ramis then collaborated on an additional rewrite. The pair worked on individual sections and then edited each other. Ramis then spent a few days refining it into the screenplay.<ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/><ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> Rubin recommended that they not include any references to the 1990s or any specific period to allow it to remain timeless.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=23}}<ref name=\"TheGuardianDirectors\"/> Rubin has said that the final film largely resembles his script.<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/> He did regret the loss of a scene between Phil and a 14-year-old boy, in which the child behaves like Phil did at the start of the film, contrasting with Phil's character development by that point in the script.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=73}} A few scenes were written but not filmed, including Phil praying at a church, gambling, and a scene Murray personally vetoed, of Phil stripped naked to force an elderly man out of a swimming pool.<ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/><ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/> Although the script was complete, it continued to undergo changes during filming.<ref name=\"SeattleTimes\"/><ref name=\"NorthWestHerald\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Chris Elliott by Gage Skidmore (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A smiling man wearing glasses and a cap. |[[Chris Elliott]] (pictured in 2011) portrays Larry the cameraman]]\nFor the role of Phil Connors, [[Chevy Chase]], [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Michael Keaton]] were also considered.<ref name=\"DeadlinePrice\"/><ref name=\"Hollywoodreporterhanks\"/><ref name=\"BusiInsideKeaton\"/> Hanks was Ramis's first choice, but he rejected the offer, rationalizing that he was typecast portraying nice people, and the audience would be expecting his inevitable redemption, whereas Murray was \"such a miserable [son of a bitch] on- and off-screen\" that the outcome would be less predictable.

He spent much of the shoot in the background of the diner scene as they wanted all the actors in their places even if the camera was not focused on them.<ref name=\"AVClubShannon\"/> A live groundhog, given the name Scooter, was used to portray Punxsutawney Phil. Punxsutawney officials, upset that their town was not used for filming, refused to allow the real Punxsutawney Phil to appear in the film.<ref name=\"Mentalfloss\"/><ref name=\"PhillyBeast\"/> The groundhog itself was not specially bred for use on film and was trapped in the wild near Illinois a few weeks before filming.<ref name=\"morning call\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[File:Gobblers Knob - Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania (7086949891).jpg|thumb|left|The real Gobbler's Knob in [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]] (2012)]]\n\nThe production wanted to use a \"quintessential American town\" for location shooting, a place that did not look as if it was specific to any particular time period.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/> The Pennsylvania Film Commission provided [[location scouting]] tapes of Punxsutawney, but it became obvious that attempting to film in Punxsutawney would present difficulties, as the town had few ideal filming locations for the scripted scenes.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"morning call\"/> Punxsutawney was also too isolated from the necessary amenities. The rural town was nearly {{convert|80|mi}} from the nearest large city, Pittsburgh, and did not offer sufficient accommodation for the cast and crew.<ref name=\"morning call\"/><ref name=\"AboutPittsburgh\"/>\n\nAs a Chicago native, Ramis enjoyed filming in Illinois and knew the area could meet their needs.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"morning call\"/> These included being closer to a major metropolitan area with access to highways, a winter aesthetic, and the ability to complete the production as quickly as possible.<ref name=\"morning call\"/><ref name=\"AboutPittsburgh\"/> Ramis also wanted a [[main street]] like Punxsutawney's. Location scout Bob Hudgins thought that [[Mineral Point, Wisconsin]], could meet their requirements. During the scouting journey there, the team stopped in the city of [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]], which happened to have a [[town square]]. The filmmakers could see the benefits of a town square over a main street. Ramis asked for something similar but in closer proximity to Chicago.<ref name=\"WoodstockIndependent\"/>\n\nBy the time they arrived in [[Woodstock, Illinois]], over 60 towns had been scouted. Hudgins was aware of Woodstock\u2014a small town of approximately 25,000 people\u2014from his work on the 1987 comedy film ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]''. Though relatively remote, it offered the timeless quality the filmmakers sought. After Hudgins arranged for Ramis and Albert to view the town from the bell tower of the Woodstock Opera House, the decision was made to film in Woodstock.<ref name=\"morning call\"/><ref name=\"WoodstockIndependent\"/> The town even came with a large pothole for Phil to step in.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"WoodstockIndependent\"/>\n\nScouts initially found a forested preserve area outside of [[McHenry, Illinois]], to film scenes at Gobbler's Knob. The filmmakers later opted to position the site in the town square instead,<ref name=\"WoodstockIndependent\"/> recreating it to scale with detailed notes and videos,<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"morning call\"/><ref name=\"AboutPittsburgh\"/> which significantly increased the impact on the town. Thousands of extras were on-site across multiple takes. Several local businesses banded together to oppose the film's presence, concerned about the impact the production would have on both the town square and storefronts over an indeterminate amount of time. Hudgins said that he was proud that badges with the number \"23\" on them\u2014representing the 23 united businesses\u2014had to be amended to \"14\" as he won several over. The city council was also split on whether to let it proceed.<ref name=\"WoodstockIndependent\"/> Three of the business owners sued Columbia Pictures after filming concluded for lost profits during the production. One of these cases was settled out of court; the outcomes of the other two are unknown.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribunePremiere\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Groundhog day tip top bistro.jpg|thumb|Tip Top Bistro, established at the site of the fictional Tip Top Cafe in Woodstock]]\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 16, 1992 and concluded on June{{nbsp}}10, after 86 days.<ref name=\"TCM\"/> The budget was reported to be between $14.6{{nbsp}}million and $30{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"VarietyBudget\"/><ref name=\"morning call\"/><ref name=\"TheNumbers\"/> Filming took place mainly in Woodstock, as well as on sets in [[Cary, Illinois]], and [[Hollywood, California]].<ref name=\"morning call\"/><ref name=\"PennLive\"/>\n\nWeather conditions varied considerably during filming. Much of the shoot was conducted in conditions described as frigid and bitterly cold.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/> Murray estimated that it was often {{convert|20|F|C}}. The conditions persisted until the end of May. Murray said that being outside for up to 12 hours a day left his skin feeling raw and made him irritable.<ref name=\"morning call\"/> Toward the end of the shoot, as summer began, fake snow was used to replicate the winter setting, and the actors continued to wear their winter gear despite the rising heat.<ref name=\"AVClubShannon\"/> Ramis could not decide on the weather conditions for the background of Phil's and Ned's encounters, so he shot their nine scenes multiple times in differing conditions. He settled on a gloomy setting to indicate a loop coming to an end.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/> Weather conditions were a major factor in a two-week shoot for the car crash scene.<ref name=\"JournalStandard\"/>\n\nThe shoot was also mired in tensions between Ramis and Murray; Ramis was focused on making a romantic comedy, in direct contrast to Murray's desire for a more contemplative film.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> Murray was also in the middle of a divorce from Margaret Kelly.<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/> He was reportedly miserable throughout filming, demonstrated erratic behavior, threw tantrums, and often contradicted Ramis's decisions.<ref name=\"uproxx rift\"/><ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> Ramis said that Murray constantly showed up late to set, calling his behavior \"just irrationally mean and unavailable.\"<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> The two also disagreed about the script and other actors' performances.<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/> Shannon recounted how he believed he had upset Murray during an encounter. When Ramis heard about this, he made Murray publicly apologize to Shannon.<ref name=\"AVClubShannon\"/> Tobolowsky recounted how before their scene's first take, Murray walked into a bakery and bought all the pastries, which he threw to the gathered onlookers, using Tobolowsky to help carry the load.<ref name=\"NorthWestHerald\"/>\n\n[[File:Wdstckoperahouse1.JPG|thumb|left|The Woodstock Opera House served as both the exterior of Rita's hotel and the scene of one of Phil's suicides.]]\nThe script continued to change during filming. When Tobolowsky arrived for his first scene, he was handed a new script. He estimated that about a third of it was different from his original copy. For example, early in the film, Phil ends his first loop by breaking a pencil to see if it is repaired the following day. A more elaborate scene was filmed in which Phil spray-painted the walls of the room he wakes up in, destroyed objects, and gave himself a [[Mohawk hairstyle]]. The scene took three days to film and was costly; Ramis discarded it for something quieter, simpler, and less manic. The revised script also featured more of Phil's misadventures, and his suicide attempts were set closer to the end. These scenes were moved forward in favor of a long third act showing Phil embracing life.<ref name=\"SeattleTimes\"/><ref name=\"NorthWestHerald\"/>\n\nMurray endured physical discomfort for some scenes. To prepare for his step into the water-filled pothole, he wrapped his foot in cling wrap, neoprene, and two pairs of socks. As soon as the scene finished, he began an expletive-filled rant until the costume department dried his foot with hairdryers to avoid frostbite.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/> For another scene, Murray asked MacDowell to really slap him, and Ramis instructed the children Murray confronts in a snowball fight to throw hard.<ref name=\"TheWrap\"/><ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> During the scene in which Phil drives off with Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog bit Murray on the knuckle. Despite wearing gloves, the bite broke the skin. It bit him again in the same spot on a later take.<ref name=\"PhillyBeast\"/><ref name=\"Mentalfloss\"/>\n\nMurray was hesitant about shooting the final scene in which Phil awakens next to Rita, as how or whether Phil was dressed would affect the tone of the reveal that he had escaped the time loop. Ramis polled the crew, who were split between Phil wearing the same clothes as the previous night and different clothes that suggested the pair had been intimate.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/> A young female crew member served as the tiebreaker, ruling that they should be wearing the same clothes as \"anything else... will ruin the movie.\"<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/> As MacDowell's and Murray's characters venture outside the Cherry Tree Inn in the film's denouement, the scripted line \"Let's live here\" is tempered by a Murray ad{{nbsp}}lib, \"We'll rent to start.\"{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nMany locations in and around Woodstock were used in the production. The Woodstock Town Square features prominently. A bar in the former courthouse is used for a bar in Rita's hotel. The Woodstock Opera House served as the exteriors of Rita's hotel, and its tower is used for Phil's suicide leap.<ref name=\"PennLive\"/><ref name=\"LocationHub\"/> The Cherry Street Inn was a private residence; the interior was shot on a set.<ref name=\"PennLive\"/> Woodstock City Lanes was used for the bowling alley scene.<ref name=\"LocationHub\"/> The Tip Top Cafe, a setting for several scenes, was purpose-built for the film. Local demand later led to a real diner with a near-identical name at the same location.<ref name=\"LocationHub\"/><ref name=\"HuffPoCafe\"/> The bachelor auction where Phil demonstrates his personal transformation was filmed at the Woodstock Moose Lodge.<ref name=\"PennLive\"/><ref name=\"LocationHub\"/> The scene of Phil driving his car over a cliff was shot in Nimtz Quarry in [[Loves Park, Illinois]], about {{convert|34|mi}} from Woodstock. A rail system was used to propel two vehicles into the quarry on separate takes, to give Ramis a choice of shots; pyrotechnics were employed to make each explode.<ref name=\"JournalStandard\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n==Release==\n===Context===\n{{see also|1993 in film}}\n[[File:The Emoji Movie premiere at the Fox Theatre, Westwood Village 4.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[premiere]] of ''Groundhog Day'' took place on February{{nbsp}}4, 1993, at the [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village]] in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]].]]\n1993 was considered the year of the family film.<ref name=\"LAtimesYear1993\"/> This was seen as a response to criticism of Hollywood for overusing violence and sex in films, as well as a need for feel-good entertainment in a time of [[recession]].<ref name=\"LATimesFamily\"/><ref name=\"NYTFAmily\"/> As production costs rose, films pitched at both adults and children offered a greater chance being profitable both at the theater and in the ensuing [[home video]] [[Video rentals|rentals]]. By 1993, the three all-time highest-grossing films in North America were family-oriented: ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', and ''[[Home Alone]]''. Family films encouraged repeat business and offered more opportunities to sell merchandise.<ref name=\"LATimesFamily\"/><ref name=\"NYTFAmily\"/> Columbia Pictures chairman Mark Canton said that [[PG-Rating|PG-rated]] films were much more likely to make over $100{{nbsp}}million, compared to adult-oriented fare.

This increased its weekend total to $14.6{{nbsp}}million\u2014enhancing the theater average to $8,934. This made it the second-biggest opening for a film released in winter, behind ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' ($18{{nbsp}}million) released the year before. ''Groundhog Day'' finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of romantic drama ''[[Sommersby]]'' ($9.9{{nbsp}}million), and adventure comedy ''[[Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey]]'' ($8.1{{nbsp}}million), both in their second week of release.<ref name=\"BOMWeekendBrkDwn\"/><ref name=\"LATimesPresidents\"/><ref name=\"LATimesReleaseWKND\"/> Screenings of the film were approximately 80% sold out. 65% of audiences polled said they would \"definitely recommend\" it.<ref name=\"VarietyFigures\"/>\n\nThe film retained the number-one position in its second weekend with a further gross of $9.3{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"LATimesFeb23\"/> In its third weekend, it dropped to second place with $7.6{{nbsp}}million, behind the debuting crime thriller ''[[Falling Down]]'' ($8.7{{nbsp}}million).<ref name=\"BOMWeekendBrkDwn\"/><ref name=\"LATimesMar2\"/> ''Groundhog Day'' remained in the top 10 grossing films for a further four weeks, earning a total of $57.6{{nbsp}}million.

He said that ''Groundhog Day'' demonstrated Ramis's capable comedic timing, and offered a clever plot without pretension.<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\"/> Critics compared it to a combination of ''It's a Wonderful Life'' and the surreal science-fiction/horror television series ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' (1959).<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\"/><ref name=\"THRReview\"/> [[Roger Ebert]] compared it to the Murray-starring Christmas-comedy ''[[Scrooged]]'' (1988), featuring a similar transformation from selfish to selfless. He said that where that film offered a \"grim discontent,\" ''Groundhog Day'' offered optimism.<ref name=\"EbertReviewOrig\"/>\n\nCritics agreed that the film had an obvious moral, but disagreed on its presentation. [[Desson Thomson]] found the film initially intriguing but believed it deteriorated into a Hollywood-style morality tale.<ref name=\"WashingtonPostRevHowe\"/> In Turan's opinion, ''Groundhog Day'' started as a traditional Hollywood story, but was earnest enough to convert the audience by the end, and had a \"romantic innocence\" that prevented it becoming formulaic.<ref name=\"LATimesReview\"/> Hinson said that the moral core of the story was never presented in a way that insulted the viewer's intelligence or required they sacrifice their cynicism to accept it. He continued that Phil evolves into a better version of himself, but never stops being a jerk.<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\"/> According to [[Janet Maslin]], the film balanced sentimentality and nihilism.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' appreciated that the film endorsed small town morals and their positive effect on Phil.<ref name=\"THRReview\"/> The ''[[New Statesman]]'' argued that it appealed simultaneously to cynicism and optimism.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=11}}\n\nThe tone was described as inconsistent, and the film poorly paced, some scenes going on too long.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\"/> [[Owen Glieberman]] compared it unfavorably to another time-travel film, ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985), which he found more cleverly structured. He described some scenes as isolated comedy sketches rather than part of a larger narrative.<ref name=\"EWReview\"/> Thomson said that the repetition of scenes worked against the film, making it seem as if no progress was being made.<ref name=\"WashingtonPostRevHowe\"/> Hinson countered that minor alterations to the scenes kept them interesting as part of a \"brilliantly imaginative\" and \"complex\" script.<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\"/> Some reviewers said that the humor was often mild, eliciting small chuckles instead of outright hilarity,<ref name=\"EWReview\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> although Hinson found it to be \"wildly funny.\"<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\"/> ''The Hollywood Reporter'' wrote that it offered a range of comedy and satire, all tempered by the love story between Phil and Rita.<ref name=\"THRReview\"/> Critics highlighted the deeper story behind the comedy. Ebert called it a comedy on the surface but with an underlying thoughtfulness.<ref name=\"EbertReviewOrig\"/> Maslin said that her initial impression was of a lightweight fare, but it became \"strangely affecting.\"<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nMurray was consistently praised for his performance.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\"/><ref name=\"LATimesReview\"/><ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\"/><ref name=\"WashingtonPostRevHowe\"/> Critics were in agreement that his performance was essential to the film's success by making Phil's transformation believable.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/><ref name=\"RevSiskel\"/> [[Gene Siskel]] wrote that any other actor could not have prevented the film from becoming too \"saccharine.\"<ref name=\"RevSiskel\"/> Turan said that Murray's natural gruffness and comedic barbs prevented over-sentimentality. Turan also appreciated the endearing performance by Murray compared to his more abrasive, past performances.<ref name=\"LATimesReview\"/> Hinson said that Murray had never been funnier. He continued that Murray was a vital component in keeping the film's optimism from seeming dishonest or manufactured. Hinson liked that even after Phil's redemption, he retains a cynical edge.<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\"/> Glieberman believed that Murray's indifference retains the audience's attention, but added that while Murray was talented enough to play a redeemed person, it was not a good fit for him.<ref name=\"EWReview\"/> Ebert found Murray significantly funnier as a sarcastic antagonist than the friendly protagonist.<ref name=\"EbertReviewOrig\"/>\n\nCritics were enamored with MacDowell's performance. Siskel said that she lit up the screen when she was on.<ref name=\"RevSiskel\"/> Maslin called her a \"thorough delight,\" saying that MacDowell's performance offered a comforting, comedic presence.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/> Hinson said that the on-screen chemistry between MacDowell and Murray was \"otherworldly\" and that she was a perfect fit for comedy.<ref name=\"WashingtonPostReview\"/> Tobolowsky also received praise as a hilarious \"pest.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\"/><ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\nAt the [[1993 New York Film Critics Circle Awards]], the screenplay came runner up for Best Screenplay, tying with ''Schindler's List''.<ref name=\"NYTNYC\"/> The same year, it won Best Comedy Film at the [[British Comedy Awards]].<ref name=\"BCA\"/> In a then-unprecedented move, in late 1993, Columbia Pictures sent over 4,500 members of the [[Academy Awards]] voting committee a custom box containing videotapes of nine of their eligible films.

The case was never formally filed as the film's production company refused to support legal action.<ref name=\"VultureRubin\"/>{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=14}} Similarly, Leon Arden also attempted legal action, claiming the film was a copy of one he had unsuccessfully pitched to Columbia Pictures about a man repeating April&nbsp;15. The judge ruled against Arden.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=14}}\n\nMurray initially hated the finished ''Groundhog Day''.<ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> In a 1993 interview, he said that he wanted to focus on the comedy and the underlying theme of people repeating their lives out of fear of change. Ramis wanted to focus on the redeeming power of love. Even so, Murray agreed that Ramis had ultimately been right to do so.<ref name=\"PhillyBeast\"/> The film marked the end of Ramis and Murray's nearly 20-year long partnership that among other things, had created films like ''Caddyshack'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981), and ''Ghostbusters''. After filming concluded, Murray stopped speaking to Ramis. He never contacted Ramis, and refused to speak about him in interviews.<ref name=\"new yorker\"/> Ramis openly spoke about Murray, both criticizing him and discussing his dreams where the pair were once again friends.<ref name=\"uproxx rift\"/><ref name=\"ReadersDigest\"/> Some of their close acquaintances, including producer [[Michael Shamberg]], speculated that Murray had grown disillusioned with the assumption that his best work only came in collaboration with Ramis, or that Ramis was responsible for Murray's public persona.<ref name=\"new yorker\"/><ref name=\"uproxx rift\"/> Ramis said that he could make Murray as funny as possible, and in return, Murray's improvisational skills could save even the most lackluster of scripts.<ref name=\"uproxx rift\"/>\n\nMurray felt that ''Groundhog Day'' had given him an opportunity to showcase a different side of himself. He admitted that he was bothered by his perception that his previous films focused on jokes without offering a deeper subtext. Even so, he said that he had found solace in meeting the people entertained by his work.<ref name=\"PhillyBeast\"/> Ramis believed that Murray's dramatic turns in films like ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' (2003) revealed more about Murray than anything else. Speaking in 2009, Ramis said that he thought Murray had grown tired of being the manic, energetic person carrying a film, and wanted to explore his potential.<ref name=\"AVClubRamis\"/> Ramis reached out to Murray to cast him in his 2005 black comedy ''[[The Ice Harvest]]''. Murray's brother Brian declined on his behalf. When Ramis enquired further, Brian said that Murray never discussed Ramis. Except for a few brief exchanges at public events, the pair did not speak for nearly two decades.<ref name=\"new yorker\"/> They reunited only in the final few months of Ramis's life in 2014.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"VultureMemoir\"/> Rubin said that Murray and his brother now speak fondly of Ramis.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/>\n\nDespite the film's success, Rubin was not credited with writing any more films. Despite being in high demand, he retained his desire to tell original stories and refused to tell a traditional Hollywood narrative arc as he found defying the expected premise and structure to be the most interesting part. This was not acceptable to studios looking for him to simply put a Rubin-esque spin on a conventional story. Eventually, the offers stopped coming. He continued to write scripts, but none progressed. In a 2017 interview, Rubin admitted some regret that ''Groundhog Day'' remained his biggest success.<ref name=\"VultureRubin\"/>\n\n=== Home media and re-releases ===\n''Groundhog Day'' was released on [[VHS]] in early September 1993.

It included the same extras as the 15th-anniversary edition.<ref name=\"HomeMediaForbes\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\n===Time loop duration===\nThe duration of Phil's real-time entrapment in the time loop has been the subject of much discussion.<ref name=\"Hollywoodreporterhanks\"/><ref name=\"IFC\"/> Ramis once said that he believed the film took place over 10 years.<ref name=\"Hollywoodreporterhanks\"/> When a blogger estimated the actual length to be approximately nine years, Ramis disputed that estimate and his own. He replied that it takes at least 10 years to become good at an activity (such as Phil learning ice sculpting and to speak French) and \"allotting for the down-time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years.\"<ref name=\"Heeb\"/> A similar estimate suggests that it takes at least 10,000 hours of study (just over a year's worth of time) to become an expert in a field, and given the number of loops seen or mentioned on screen, and how long Phil could spend per day studying, that Phil spent approximately 12,400 days, or nearly 34 years, trapped in the loop.<ref name=\"IFC\"/> In Rubin's original concept draft, Phil himself estimates that he has been trapped for between 70 and 80 years, having used books to track the passage of time.<ref name=\"DOGRubin\"/>\n\nBorn to a Jewish family, Ramis had adopted a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] lifestyle from his second wife, embracing some of its precepts.<ref name=\"new yorker\"/><ref name=\"LionsRoad\"/><ref name=\"NationalReview\"/> He said that based on Buddhist doctrine, it takes approximately 10,000 years for a soul to evolve to the next level.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/> In 2005, Rubin said, \"it became this weird political issue because if you asked the studio, 'How long was the repetition?', they'd say, 'Two weeks'. But the point of the movie to me was that you had to feel you were enduring something that was going on for a long time.... For me it had to be\u2014I don't know. A hundred years. A lifetime.\"{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=19}} In his book ''Groundhog Day'', Ryan Gilbey thought the vagueness surrounding the length of the loop was one of the most remarkable elements of the film. Just as there is no justification for why or how Phil is caught in the loop, the length of time is only as long as it takes for Phil to become a better person.<ref name=\"TheGuardianDirectors\"/>\n\n===Thematic analysis===\n[[File:Plaosan Bodhisattva 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 9th-century [[bodhisattva]] bas-relief. The character of Phil Connors has been interpreted as a bodhisattva: someone who helps others reach [[nirvana]].]]\nThe film has been interpreted in many ways by different groups.<ref name=\"VultureRubin\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/> Rubin has said that he did not set out to write the film as a spiritual analogy. He simply wanted to tell a story about human life and periods in it where a person becomes trapped in a cycle no matter how much they want to escape.<ref name=\"TheWrapToblowsky\"/> He said it was not \"just about a man repeating the same day but a story about how to live. Whose life isn't a series of days? Who doesn't feel stuck from time to time?\"<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> In the bowling alley scene, Phil asks two Punxsutawney residents if they understand what it is like to be stuck in a place where nothing they do matters. He is referring to his own trapped situation, but the two men, though not trapped in their own loop, know exactly what he means.<ref name=\"NYTReview\"/>\n\nWhile Rubin and Ramis discussed several of the philosophical and spiritual aspects of the film, they \"never intended [it] to be anything more than a good, heartfelt, entertaining story.\"<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> Murray saw the original script as an interpretation of how people repeat the same day over and over because they are afraid of change.<ref name=\"PhillyBeast\"/> Rubin added that at the start of the loop, it is the worst day of Phil's life. By being forced to change who he is, to embrace the world around him, and each moment of his day, it becomes the best day of his life; the day he falls in love.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> In a 2017 interview, Murray said he believed ''Groundhog Day'' still resonated because it is about \"the idea that we just have to try again... it's such a beautiful, powerful idea.\"<ref name=\"RollingStoneMusical\"/>\n\nRubin has been contacted throughout the years by different experts providing their own interpretations.<ref name=\"IndependentThemes\"/> It has been seen as a Christian allegory with Punxsutawney Phil representing [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]],<ref name=\"IndependentThemes\"/> an example of the [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] concept of the [[eternal return]], the spirit of Judaism, and the essence of homeopathy.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/><ref name=\"VultureRubin\"/> It has also been interpreted as an adaptation of the Greek mythological figure [[Sisyphus]] who is also condemned to an eternal, daily punishment.<ref name=\"ConsequenceofSound\"/> Others have found significance in the numbers present in the film.<ref name=\"VultureRubin\"/> Ramis himself was fascinated by Rubin's original draft and its concepts of reincarnation.<ref name=\"TheWrapRubin\"/> The date of Groundhog Day also has implications. It is set between the end of winter\u2014characterized in the film as a period of satire and the end of things\u2014and spring\u2014a season represented by comedy and connected with themes of renewal and redemption.{{sfn|Glausser|2019|pp=3, 7}}\n\nBuddhist leaders commended the representation of the ideologies of regeneration. Phil can be interpreted as a [[bodhisattvas|bodhisattva]], someone who has reached the brink of [[Nirvana]] and returns to Earth to help others to do the same. In the Jewish faith, Phil's escape or reward can be seen as him being returned to Earth to perform moral deeds or ''[[mitzvah|mitzvot]]''\u2014the precepts and commandments of God. In Christianity, his journey can be interpreted as a form of resurrection or a means of securing a place in heaven. In [[Falun Gong]] religious philosophy, the film has been interpreted as a message that the spiritual self cannot evolve until it learns from past mistakes.<ref name=\"IndependentThemes\"/><ref name=\"TheWrapRubin\"/><ref name=\"NYTSpiritual\"/> In Catholicism, Phil's situation can be identified as a form of [[purgatory]], escaped only by embracing selflessness.<ref name=\"NationalReview\"/> MacDowell said \"Wouldn't it be great if we had that kind of experience and learn something from it? We go through life and are not always conscious of it... whatever religion you want to base yourself in, that's ultimately why we're here.\"<ref name=\"TheWrapRubin\"/> ''Groundhog Day'' can also be interpreted as a secular tale in which Phil is experiencing an existential crisis where primal indulgences are no longer satisfying, causing him to fall into a depression that he escapes by taking ownership of his own self-improvement; he then uses his improved persona to benevolently help others.{{sfn|Glausser|2019|p=16}}\n\nPhil initially compares himself to a god, declaring that as a weatherman, he makes the weather.<ref name=\"TheWrapRubin\"/> After several loops he comes to believe he is a god, asserting that omnipotence may be mistaken for having lived so long one simply knows everything.<ref name=\"NationalReview\"/> Using his knowledge he is able to manipulate events in his favor.<ref name=\"LionsRoad\"/> The repetition gives Phil an opportunity to escape from his own narcissistic self-confinement. Unwilling to change himself, the means to do so are forced upon him.<ref name=\"LionsRoad\"/> After constant rejection by Rita and his idea of love, Phil hits an emotional low and repeatedly commits suicide. At one point he suggests that he has killed himself enough times to no longer exist. It is at this point, Ramis suggests, that Phil becomes ready to change.<ref name=\"LionsRoad\"/><ref name=\"ConsequenceofSound\"/>\n\nIt is only when Phil stops using the loops to indulge his own desires and instead uses them to selflessly help others that he is freed.<ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/> In repeatedly failing to save the old homeless man, Phil is also forced to accept that he is not a god.<ref name=\"ThemesOldMan\"/> Similarly, regardless of how much knowledge he gains about Rita, and despite his accomplishments learned throughout the loops, he is unable to impress her enough to earn her love. He wins her over only once he stops trying to do so, when he demonstrates genuine care for helping others without fakery or self-interest, knowing that the day will likely reset and it will have all been for naught. Only then does Rita return his affections.<ref name=\"new yorker\"/><ref name=\"LATIMesRamis\"/><ref name=\"ConsequenceofSound\"/> The aspects of Rita that Phil mocked at the start of the film have become qualities he admires and respects, and in turn, Phil receives Rita's love not because he desires it, but because he has genuinely become the type of person that Rita could love.{{sfn|Racicot|2006|pp=194\u2013195}} This demonstrates the redeeming power of love, something Ramis wanted to emphasize.<ref name=\"PhillyBeast\"/><ref name=\"ConsequenceofSound\"/> For him, ''Groundhog Day'' represents having the strength and knowledge to make a change when faced with the opportunity to repeat previous mistakes.<ref name=\"LionsRoad\"/>\n\nRick Brookhiser argues that it is because Phil fully appreciates every facet of the day that he is rewarded by the day being taken from him. He said, \"loving life includes loving the fact that it goes.\"<ref name=\"NationalReview\"/> [[John Seamon]] said that where other films use memory as a means of reflection or escape, Phil effectively lives within his memories, repeating them indefinitely; he has no hope for a future because everything will reset. By remembering and appreciating new details, Phil is able to grow as a person and becomes the agent of his own change.{{sfn|Seamon|2015|pp=51\u201354}} Rubin said Phil will not return to his old ways after his experiences, but might suffer disappointment that no day will ever live up to his final, perfect February{{nbsp}}2, after which he essentially loses his superpowers.{{sfn|Gilbey|2004|p=81}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Prlaque of Movie(Groundhog day) Woodstock, IL.jpg|thumb|A floor-positioned plaque in [[Woodstock, Illinois]] commemorating the pothole Bill Murray's character steps in during ''Groundhog Day'']]\n''Groundhog Day'' is considered one of the most beloved comedy films ever made, an all-time classic, and a pop culture touchstone.<ref name=\"Varietyat25\"/><ref name=\"io9classic\"/><ref name=\"EONlineTerm\"/> In 2020, ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' described it as having a \"mythic, permanent pop cultural status reserved for few films.\"<ref name=\"PasteHit\"/> The film's success made Ramis a credible comedy director, opening up more creative opportunities for him.<ref name=\"VarietyRamis\"/><ref name=\"GuardianRamis\"/> Over the rest of the 1990s, he would direct 1996's ''[[Multiplicity (film)|Multiplicity]]'' (also starring MacDowell), 1999's ''[[Analyze This]]'', and 2000's ''[[Bedazzled (2000 film)|Bedazzled]]''.<ref name=\"new yorker\"/><ref name=\"GuardianRamis\"/> ''Groundhog Day'' also showcased Murray's capabilities as an actor, changing perceptions of him as a comedian to a broad-ranged actor and credible romantic lead.

Since the film's release, Woodstock has hosted its own Groundhog Day festivals.
