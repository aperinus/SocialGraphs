In his narration, Herzog explains that this film will not be a typical Antarctica film about \"fluffy penguins\" but will instead explore the dreams of the people and the landscape.\n\nArriving at [[McMurdo Station]], the two-man crew interview some maintenance and support workers and [[iceberg]] geologist Douglas MacAyeal. They travel to a nearby [[pinniped|seal]] camp supervised by zoologist Olav Oftedal, then join the film's composer/producer, research diver [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]], at a diving camp. The film then shows underwater footage shot by Kaiser. Cell biologist Samuel Bowser and zoologist Jan Pawlowski are interviewed, and after finishing their research, Kaiser and Bowser stage a rooftop guitar concert back at McMurdo.\n\nHerzog and Zeitlinger visit [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s nearby cabin, which has been preserved, unchanged, for almost a century. After some footage filmed at the [[South Pole]], Herzog interviews [[penguin]] scientist David Ainley. He asks Ainley about penguin sexuality and mental illness, and there is footage of a penguin marching away from the sea, going inland to its certain death.\n\nThe filmmakers visit the active volcano [[Mount Erebus]] and interview volcanologists. As Herzog speculates about alien scientists visiting a post-human Earth, there is a sequence shot in tunnels carved deep into the ice below South Pole station, where various trinkets and mementos, including a can of Russian caviar and a whole frozen [[sturgeon]], have been placed in carved-out shelves in the walls and preserved by the extreme cold and dry air. On the slope of Erebus, Herzog and Zeitlinger explore ice caves formed by [[fumarole|fumaroles]].\n\nContinuing the progression into the metaphysical, the filmmakers visit the launch of a giant [[helium balloon]] used in a [[neutrino detector|neutrino detection]] project ([[ANtarctic Impulse Transient Antenna|ANITA]]) and interview physicist Peter Gorham. The final word is given to a philosopher/maintenance worker at McMurdo, and the film ends with more footage from the fumarole ice caves and Kaiser's dives.\n\n==Production==\nHerzog was drawn to Antarctica after viewing underwater footage filmed there by [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]]. He became aware of the footage when he happened to notice Kaiser showing it to a friend while working on the music for Herzog's ''[[Grizzly Man]]''.<ref name=audiocommentary>Herzog, Kaiser, Zeitlinger, DVD audio commentary for ''Encounters at the End of the World''</ref> Kaiser, a musician and diver, first went to Antarctica as part of the [[National Science Foundation]]'s [[Antarctic Artists and Writers Program]] for his \"Slide Guitar Around the World\" project, and he returned on several scientific diving expeditions.<ref>\"Slide Guitar & Exorcism @ The South Pole\", featurette on DVD release of ''Encounters at the End of the World''</ref> Before ''Encounters at the End of the World'', Herzog made prominent use of Kaiser's footage in the [[fiction film]] ''[[The Wild Blue Yonder]]'' (2005).\n\nThe film was shot in Antarctica as part of the same NSF Antarctic Artists and Writers Program<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/treaty/opp07001/pdf/artist_write.pdf|title=Artists and Writers Program|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|date=July 18, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711195106/https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/antarct/treaty/opp07001/pdf/artist_write.pdf|archive-date=July 11, 2017|access-date=June 19, 2019}}</ref> that had first brought Kaiser to the continent. The entire film crew consisted of Herzog, who recorded all production sound, and cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger. The pair went to Antarctica without any opportunity to plan filming locations or interviews, and had just seven weeks to conceive the project and shoot their footage. The freewheeling nature of the time in Antarctica meant that Herzog often only met the interview subjects minutes before beginning to film them.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=July 7, 2011 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080707/PEOPLE/657811251 | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | title=Werner Herzog: 'Tell me about the iceberg, tell me about your dreams.' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711160919/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080707/PEOPLE/657811251 |archive-date=July 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFilming in Antarctica is usually overseen by the NSF's media office, which approves and supervises all film productions. Because of Herzog's grant from the Artists and Writers Program, however, he was allowed to film without any [[minder]]s or oversight from the NSF. This allowed him and Zeitlinger to film the \"seal-bagging\" footage, which is not typically deemed suitable for public release.<ref name=audiocommentary/>\n\nThe audio recordings of the seals featured in the film were produced by Douglas Quin, a sound expert and professor at the [[S.I.
