Its plot follows a nerdy college student who [[blackmail]]s a group of young men with his knowledge that they have cheated throughout college, and uses it to get closer to a young woman he is obsessed with.\n\n==Plot==\nBest friends Dave Goodman, Sam Schecter, and Jeff Davis have spent almost four years at Holden University scamming their way through college. During one exam scam in their final semester, Dave meets Angela Patton and asks her out while writing his phone number on her exam sheet. Ethan Dulles (who calls himself \"Cool Ethan\"), a nerdy student who is obsessed with Angela, observes Dave and grows jealous. Ethan takes her exam question sheet after Angela leaves and uses it to blackmail the guys into setting up a successful date with Angela for him. The guys set Ethan up in multiple situations in an attempt to convince Angela to like him, while Dave tells Sam during their work researching her that Angela is no more important to him as any other scam they have done.  Ethan fails to attract her after frequent confrontations based on his delusional behavior, immaturity and ignorance of social norms.\n\nWhile trying to convince Angela to go out with Ethan, Dave and Angela grow a mutual attraction to each other. After telling Ethan that he has failed to convince Angela to go out with him, Ethan reveals to Dave that he has been obsessing over Angela for quite some time. He reminds Dave that he still intends to get Dave and his friends expelled if they fail him.  Angela and Dave go on an impromptu date after a study session. Ethan finds out and follows and records them. Dave and Angela share a romantic swim and lovemaking session, which Ethan records. He shows the tape of Dave and Angela making love to Sam and Jeff to establish that Dave intends to keep Angela for himself.  Sam and Jeff, unhappy with Dave's dishonesty, hand over their research on Angela. Ethan shows the file to Angela, telling her that Dave and his friends were actively stalking her. Dave punches Ethan in the face, but Ethan thinks he won Angela.\n\nAfter a falling out with everyone, Dave returns to the dorm and admits to Sam and Jeff that he honestly cares for Angela.  After making amends, the guys sabotage Ethan's job interview with a law firm and, during the final exam, while Dave is telling the truth to Angela in front of the whole class about his entire dishonest college career of cheating, Jeff plants an answer key in Ethan's backpack while tipping off the teaching assistant proctoring the exam. The guys get expelled, but Dave and Angela get back together and Sam ends up in a relationship with Angela's roommate, Reanna Cass.  Jeff falsifies their diplomas from Holden University after Angela and Reanna graduate.  Ethan, miserable that he lost Angela forever and also expelled from college after it was revealed he was stalking her, continues to work his dead end restaurant job. The movie ends with him singing his love of Angela and his hatred for Dave.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as \"Cool\" Ethan Dulles\n* [[Devon Sawa]] as Dave Goodman\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Sam Schecter\n* [[Michael Maronna]] as Jeff Davis\n* [[Jaime King]] as Angela Patton\n* [[Laura Prepon]] as Reanna Cass\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Head T.A.
