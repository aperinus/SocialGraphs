It was screened in the UK on [[BBC Two]] from 11 May to 5 June 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://naturewatchuk.blogspot.com/2008/04/wild-china-coming-soon.html|title=Wild China: Coming Soon|publisher=NatureWatch blog|access-date=2008-04-19}}</ref> The English narration was provided by [[Bernard Hill]] and the series produced by Phil Chapman for the [[BBC]] and Gao Xiaoping for CCTV. The Chinese version was broadcast under the title '''''Beautiful China'''''. In Canada, it was broadcast on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] as part of the series ''[[The Nature of Things]]'' narrated by [[David Suzuki]]. ''Wild China'' was broadcast in Australia on [[ABC1]] and [[ABC HD (Australian TV channel)|ABC HD]] each Sunday at 7:30pm from 18 May 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/netw/200805/programs/ZY8391A001D18052008T193000.htm | title =ABC1 Programming Airdate: Wild China (episode one)| publisher=ABC Television Publicity | access-date=2 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe musical score to accompany the series was composed by Barnaby Taylor and was performed by Cheng Yu and the UK Chinese Ensemble.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukchinesemusic.com/Projects.html|title=Cheng Yu and the UK Chinese Ensemble|access-date=2008-01-05}}</ref>\n\nThe series was billed as the culmination of the BBC Natural History Unit's \"Continents\" programmes, a long-running strand of blue-chip wildlife documentaries which surveyed the natural history of each of the world's major land areas. It was preceded by ''[[Wild Caribbean]]'' in 2007, but with the broadcast of ''[[South Pacific (TV series)|South Pacific]]'' in 2009 the BBC signalled a continuation of the strand.\n\n== Production details ==\n\nThe [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] gave the BBC Natural History Unit team the opportunity to make the first comprehensive series on China's [[natural history]]. In the run up to the Games, the Chinese government was \"understandably keen to promote itself as a country worth visiting\" according to BBC producer Phil Chapman.<ref name=\"cbc\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/natureofthings/2008/wildchina/interview.html |title=Interview with Series Producer Phil Chapman |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=2008-06-23}}</ref> Permission for ''Wild China'' was granted in 2005, with the BBC working alongside local partners CTV, a [[Beijing]] production company closely allied to state broadcaster CCTV. The series marks the first time that CCTV has collaborated with a foreign broadcaster.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2006/10_october/wild_china.shtml |title=BBC Worldwide unveils Wild China |date=2006-10-12 |publisher=BBC Press Office}}</ref>\n\nWith wildlife filmmaking in its infancy in China, and a perception in the [[developed world]] of a country plagued by environmental problems, the producers hoped that the series would change attitudes in both the East and the West:\n\n{{quotation|\"We want the Chinese to feel proud of their countryside and wildlife, to care about it and to seek to ensure its survival. We also hope to redress the negative view of China's environment propagated in western media.\"| Series Producer Phil Chapman, writing in ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' magazine}}\n\nFilming for the series took place over 16 months, and involved half a million miles of travel on 57 separate filming trips to some of China's most inaccessible and spectacular locations. The production team shot over 500 hours of HD footage in 26 of [[Provinces of China|China's 30 provinces]].<ref>{{Cite news  |last=Stafford |first=Sophie  |title=Editor's letter: China's wild treasures revealed |newspaper=[[BBC Wildlife]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |date=May 2008  }}</ref>\n\nDespite being granted unprecedented access to many remote and protected areas, one of the main challenges faced by the filmmakers was finding wildlife. Although 15% of China's territory has some form of protection, this is not a guarantee of safety for wildlife, as reserves were often found to be under-equipped and under-staffed. In addition, they encountered a lack of local expertise and specialist knowledge, as few of China's [[zoologist]]s were [[naturalist]]s with an interest in observing wildlife. Producers even struggled to film the courting behaviour of one of the country's commonest creatures, the [[green puddle frog|rice-paddy frog]].<ref name=\"cbc\" /> Consequently, the team's attempts to find and film wildlife were not always successful.\n\nWith the support of local party officials, the producers found it easier to contact and film local people. They were particularly keen to record examples of traditional lifestyles which incorporate the natural world to give the series a cultural context. The episodes were divided by region to present the distinct cultural as well as ecological differences.\n\n== Filming techniques ==\n\nOver 80% of the series was based on traditional observational techniques in the wild.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/wildchina/techniques.shtml |title=Filming Wild China - Filming techniques |publisher=BBC Science & Nature website |access-date=2008-06-23}}</ref> These were conducted in some of China's most remote areas:\n\n* Apart from a handful of biologists, the ''Wild China'' team were the first to set foot in [[Tibet]]\u2019s remote [[Changthang|Chang Tang]] reserve for almost 100 years. After a five-day drive from [[Lhasa]], they were faced with the challenge of filming rutting [[chiru]] in temperatures of -30[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] at 5,000m above sea level. The sequence showing a duel between two rival males was successfully filmed after stalking the herds for seven days.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Chan |first=George |title=Episode 3: Tibet |newspaper=[[BBC Wildlife]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |date=May 2008 }}</ref> Field producer Jeff Boedeker trained with his team for a month in various stealth techniques. On one occasion the field team lay under a white tarp for 32 hours waiting for a shot that never came. They burned yak dung to stay warm and melt drinking water, and the crew was specifically selected for its sensibility to cultures, mental and physical aptitude for high stress scenarios, and techniques in nonfiction filmmaking.  \n* After two unsuccessful attempts to film wild [[giant panda]]s in the [[Qinling Mountains]], the producers switched to a different part of the region, the little-visited [[Changqing National Nature Reserve|Changqing Reserve]]. There they were able to track and film the creatures in winter, and also film courtship and mating activity, the first time such a complete sequence has been shot in the wild.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Maxwell |first=Gavin |title=Episode 5: Land of the Panda |newspaper=[[BBC Wildlife]] |volume=26 |issue=5 |date=May 2008 }}</ref>\n* Producer Kathryn Jeffs and cameraman Paul Stewart travelled to the remote [[Gaoligongshan]] mountains in western [[Yunnan]] and after a three-hour trek to a ridge overlooking the forest, managed to film a troop of [[stump-tailed macaque|bear macaques]] feeding on fruits in the canopy.

Hunting pressure has made the wild birds in Yunnan too wary to approach.\n* The slowed-down images of [[Euophrys omnisuperstes|jumping spider]]s on [[Everest]] could not be filmed in the wild due to the impracticality of transporting high-speed camera equipment to the remote location, so a closely related species was filmed in a studio set.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n{{Episode table |background=#E2CEBC | overall= |title= |airdate= |viewers= |country=UK |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |Title           = Heart of the Dragon\n |Aux4            = 2.55 million viewers (11% audience share)<ref name=\"BARB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-30?_s=4 |title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes |publisher=[[BARB]] |access-date=2009-10-19}} (data available for ''Wild China'' broadcast weeks by searching archive)</ref>\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|5|11|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Lijiang river, Guangxi, China.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Li River and the Hills of Guilin]]\n\nThe first programme in the series concentrates on South China, where the climate and terrain is ideal for [[rice]] cultivation. The terraced [[paddy field]]s of [[Yuanyang County, Yunnan|Yuanyang County]] plunge 2000 metres down steep hillsides to the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] valley, and are some of the oldest man-made structures in China. In a [[Miao people|Miao]] household in [[Guizhou]] province, the arrival of [[red-rumped swallow]]s signals the time for planting. Other creatures which benefit from the rice monoculture include [[little egret]]s and [[Chinese pond heron]]s. Of the hundreds of [[cave]]s beneath the [[limestone]] hills of this [[South China Karst]] region, few have been explored. At [[Zhongdong, Ziyun County|Zhongdong]], an entire community, including a school, lives in the shelter of a cave. [[Francois' langur]]s, a rare primate, use their rock-climbing skills to enter caves at night for protection. Other cave dwellers include [[Common swift|swift]]s and [[Rickett's big-footed bat|Rickett\u2019s mouse eared bats]], filmed for the first time catching fish in the dark. Freshwater creatures are an important resource for the people of South China. The [[Lijiang River|Li River]] [[cormorant fishing|cormorant fishermen]] now only practice their art for tourists, but at [[Caohai Lake]], [[dragonfly nymph]]s are a unique and valuable harvest. Some delicacies, such as freshwater [[turtle]]s, are vanishingly rare. [[Chinese alligator]]s only survive in [[Anhui]] province thanks to dedicated conservation efforts. A troop of [[Tibetan macaque|Huangshan macaques]] is shown retreating to the safety of the treetops when a venomous [[Chinese moccasin]] is spotted. After the autumn rice harvest, [[migratory bird]]s including [[tundra swan]]s and [[Siberian crane]]s gather at [[Poyang Lake]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = Heart of the Dragon| series = Wild China | credits = Produced and directed by Phil Chapman | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2008-05-11}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = E2CEBC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   =  2\n |Title           = Shangri-La\n |Aux4            = 2.57M viewers (10.6% audience share)<ref name=\"BARB\"/>\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|5|18|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:\u6885\u91cc\u96ea\u5c71.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kawagebo (6740m), the highest mountain in Yunnan, lies in the Hengduan range]]\n\nThis episode profiles the rich [[biodiversity]] of south-western [[Yunnan]] province. Forming the eastern boundary of the [[Himalaya]], the [[Hengduan Shan|Hengduan Mountains]] have buckled into a series of parallel ridges running north-south. The [[Nujiang River]] is one of a succession of deep [[gorge]]s that carve their way through the mountains. In summer, [[monsoon]] rainclouds from the [[Indian Ocean]] are funnelled up the valleys, creating a unique climate in which species from the [[tropics]] can flourish at a more northerly [[latitude]]. Yunnan\u2019s 18,000 plant species, of which 3,000 are found nowhere else, attracted Western [[botanist]]s and explorers such as [[Joseph Rock]]. In the snowbound forests surrounding the pilgrimage site of Kawakarpo (6740 m), rare [[Yunnan snub-nosed monkey]]s are filmed feeding on [[lichen]]. In the Gaoligong Mountains, tropical and alpine plants grow side by side. Birdlife filmed here includes [[sunbird]]s feeding on [[epiphytes]] and the courtship display of a [[Temminck's tragopan]]. The fruiting trees attract bear macaques and [[black giant squirrel]]s, whilst China\u2019s 250 remaining wild [[Asian elephant]]s forage below. A [[lesser bamboo bat]] colony is filmed at their roost inside a single stem; each bat is the size of a bumblebee. A giant [[Amorphophallus paeoniifolius|elephant yam]] flower is pollinated by [[carrion beetle]]s at night. [[Black crested gibbon]]s are filmed in the forests of Wuliangshan. The people of Yunnan include the [[Dai people|Dai]], [[Hani people|Hani]] and [[Jino]] tribes, each of whom regard the forests as sacred and harvest them sustainably, but modern times are bringing new threats such as rubber plantations and tourism.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Shangri-La | series = Wild China | credits = Produced and directed by Kathryn Jeffs | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2008-05-18}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = E2CEBC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Tibet\n |Aux4            = 2.88M viewers (12% audience share)<ref name=\"BARB\"/>\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|5|25|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Bird Island, Qinghai Lake.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A seabird colony on a Qinghai Lake island]]\n\nThe [[Tibetan Plateau]] is the subject of the third installment. It covers one quarter of China\u2019s land area, but just 2.5 million people live there, the majority [[Tibetan Buddhist]]s. Their religion mixes traditional [[Buddhism]] with older [[B\u00f6n|shamanic]] beliefs, and its teachings have instilled a respectful attitude to wildlife. Rare species such as [[black-necked crane]]s and [[Tibetan eared pheasant]]s can benefit directly from co-existence with people. [[Meltwater]]s from Tibet\u2019s 35,000 [[glacier]]s form large freshwater lakes including [[Lake Qinghai|Qinghai]] and [[Lake Manasarovar|Manasarovar]]. Nesting birds here include [[great crested grebe]]s and [[bar-headed geese]]. The plateau is a high altitude desert swept by freezing winds, but is also home to China\u2019s biggest concentration of large animals. [[Argali]] sheep are seen descending hillsides to their winter grazing sites. In the Changtang, [[Tibetan antelope|chiru]] are filmed congregating in the rutting season, and [[wild yak]]s are only found in the remotest areas. Predators include the elusive [[snow leopard]] and the [[Tibetan fox]], filmed profiting from a [[Tibetan bear]]'s attempts to hunt [[pika]]. A highly lucrative \"caterpillar fungus\" (''[[yatsa gunbu]]'') is harvested from the spring ground for use as a traditional remedy. Life even clings on in the most extreme environments; the slopes of Everest are home to a species of [[jumping spider]], whilst the unique [[hot spring snake]] survives at 4,500m by warming its body in [[thermal spring]]s. The [[Saga Dawa]] festival takes place at sacred [[Mount Kailash]] and draws pilgrims of many faiths. Tibet is a fragile [[ecosystem]]; its glaciers are melting, and this will have a profound effect on the future for billions of people who depend on waters flowing from the plateau.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Tibet | series = Wild China | credits = Produced and directed by Jeff Boedeker | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2008-05-25}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = E2CEBC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Beyond the Great Wall\n |Aux4            = 3.23M viewers (13.7% audience share)<ref name=\"BARB\"/>\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|6|01|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Panthera tigris altaica 28 - Buffalo Zoo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Siberian tigers inhabit the forests bordering the Amur River]]\n\nThe fourth episode looks at the lands north of China\u2019s [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. Here, [[nomad]]ic tribes from a variety of ethnic groups still roam, but their traditional ways of life are changing as people move to modern cities. In ancient [[Manchuria]], the last [[Hezhe]] fishermen still cast their nets beneath the thick ice of the frozen [[Amur River|Black Dragon River]]. The forests here support [[wild boar]], which forage for walnuts in winter, and the last remaining wild [[Siberian tiger]]s in China. [[Evenks|Ewenki]] [[reindeer]] herders came from [[Siberia]] hundreds of years ago: now, only 30 remain. Further west lie the rolling [[Mongolian steppe]] grasslands, and at Bayan Bulak, the livestock of [[Mongols|Mongolian]] horsemen share the pastures and wetlands with breeding [[demoiselle crane]]s and [[whooper swan]]s. Continuing westwards, the land becomes increasingly hot and dry, turning first to arid grasslands roamed by rare [[goitered gazelle]]s, and then to the [[Taklamakan Desert]], the world\u2019s largest shifting sand desert. Here stand ruined towns, a legacy of the [[Silk Road]], and many [[yardang]]s, sand-sculpted rock formations. Underground irrigation canals at the [[Turpan]] [[oasis]] enable grapes to be cultivated, and [[Meriones libycus|red-tailed gerbil]]s are quick to take advantage. [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] nomads spend the summer in the [[Tian Shan]] before descending to the [[Junggar Basin]], an arid land bordering the [[Gobi Desert]], to overwinter. Here their livestock shares the meagre pasture with the last [[Przewalski's horse|wild horse]]s on earth. A Kazakh demonstrates the 6000-year-old tradition of [[Eagle hunting|hunting with golden eagle]]s. The closing scenes show the [[Harbin Ice Festival]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = Beyond the Great Wall | series = Wild China | credits = Produced and directed by George Chan | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = E2CEBC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Land of the Panda\n |Aux4            = 3.19M viewers (13.3% audience share)<ref name=\"BARB\"/>\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|6|08|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Su Lin giant panda bear cub at the San Diego Zoo.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The film features courtship and mating of wild giant pandas]]\n\nThe fifth installment features central China, home to the [[Han Chinese]]. They are the largest ethnic group on Earth, and their language [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] the most widely spoken. The programme looks at how the relationship between people and wildlife has changed over time. Ancient Chinese beliefs placed great importance in the harmonious co-existence of man and nature. At the beginning of China\u2019s period of rapid economic growth, this ideal was largely forgotten. A number of political references contrast the more enlightened environmental policies of the current government with those under Chairman [[Mao Zedong]], which led to widespread degradation. The [[Chinese alligator]] and [[crested ibis]] are two species saved from extinction by direct intervention. Other animals have benefited from ancient spiritual beliefs and customs which live on, promoting respect and reverence for wildlife: the [[Siberian weasel|yellow weasel]]s and [[Mandarin duck]]s of [[Beijing]] are two such creatures. However, wildlife is still threatened by illegal [[poaching]] for food and [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional medicine]]. West of Beijing lie the fertile lands of the [[North China Plain]] and the [[Loess plateau]], source of the [[Yellow River]]. Increased demand for water has changed the river\u2019s flow, and soil erosion causes [[dust storm]]s which reach the capital. Further west, the Qinling Mountains are a refuge for some of China\u2019s rarest species including the [[takin]], [[golden snub-nosed monkey]] and [[giant panda]]. Giant panda courtship and mating is shown, filmed for the first time in the wild. In the colourful lakes of [[Jiuzhaigou Valley|Jiuzhaigou]], unique fish swim amongst forests preserved underwater.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Land of the Panda | series = Wild China | credits = Produced and directed by Gavin Maxwell | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2008-06-08}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = E2CEBC\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Tides of Change\n |Aux4            = 2.52M viewers (10% audience share)<ref name=\"BARB\"/>\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|6|15|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Platalea minor.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Rare black-faced spoonbills overwinter in Hong Kong]]\n\nThe final programme features China\u2019s 14,500&nbsp;km coastline, home to 700 million people. Despite decades of rapid urban development, it is still an important migration route for birds. Endangered [[red-crowned crane]]s depart their northern breeding grounds to overwinter at [[Yancheng Coastal Wetlands|Yancheng]] [[salt marsh]], the largest coastal [[wetland]] in China. Shedao Island is an important stopover on the migration route, but the resident [[Gloydius|Shedao Island pitviper]]s, stranded by [[sea level rise|rising sea levels]], lie in ambush in the branches. A snake strikes a [[songbird]], and another is filmed swallowing a [[kingfisher]]. All along the coast, traditional forms of cultivation allow wildlife and people to live side by side. Crops vary from [[seaweed]] and [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s in the north to [[prawn]]s further south, allowing birds such as [[whooper swan]]s and [[black-faced spoonbill]]s to prosper. [[Hakka people|Kejia]] [[Oolong|tea]]-growers and Hui'an women harvesting [[oyster]]s are also shown. China\u2019s rivers and seas are heavily [[water pollution|polluted]]. [[Sewage]] and [[fertiliser]] washed into the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai Gulf]] cause [[plankton]] blooms, attracting [[jellyfish]], which in China are a commercial catch. In the [[Yangtze]] [[estuary]], the migrations of creatures such as [[Yangtze sturgeon]] and [[mitten crab]]s are being impeded by upstream [[dam]]s. In the tropical [[South China Sea]], where [[coral reef]]s are under threat, [[whale shark]]s are rare visitors. Other rare creatures filmed include [[Pere David's deer]] and [[Chinese white dolphin]]s. On [[Hainan]] island, [[Rhesus macaque|macaque]]s are shown jumping into a hotel swimming pool, epitomising the uneasy coexistence of wildlife and people in China, and the challenge of continuing its traditional harmonious relationship with nature.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Tides of Change | series = Wild China | credits = Produced and directed by Charlotte Scott | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2008-06-15}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = E2CEBC\n}}\n}}\n\n== Merchandise ==\nA [[Blu-ray Disc]], DVD and book have been released to accompany the TV series:\n\n* The Blu-ray Disc (BBCBD0025), released on 5 August 2008, presents the series in full high-definition format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001ARYYTU|title=Wild China Blu-ray|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|access-date=2008-06-13}}</ref> The series is also included in the ''BBC High Definition Natural History Collection'' Blu-ray box sets for Regions [[Blu-ray#A|A]] and [[Blu-ray#B|B]] (BBCBD0056).\n* A [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]], 2-disc DVD set (BBCDVD2146) featuring all six full-length episodes was released on 9 June 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0010SFSYE|title=Wild China DVD|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|access-date=2008-06-13}}</ref> The [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] version of the DVD and Blu-ray was released by ABC DVD/[[Village Roadshow]] on 1 July 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shop.abc.net.au/browse/product.asp?productid=753528&SearchID=4997919&SearchRefineID=10003161 |title=ABC Shop: Wild China DVD |publisher=ABC Shop Online |access-date=2 October 2010}}</ref>\n* The accompanying paperback book, ''Wild China: The Hidden Wonders of the World's Most Enigmatic Land'' by series producer Phil Chapman, was published by [[BBC Books]] on 8 May 2008 ({{ISBN|1-846-07233-6}}).<ref>{{cite web|title=Wild China book|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|isbn=1846072336 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Japan: Earth's Enchanted Islands]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{BBC programme}}\n* {{Bbc.co.uk|sn/tvradio/programmes/wildchina|''Wild China''}}\n* {{IMDb title|id = 0884762|title=Wild China}}\n\n{{BBC Natural History Unit}}\n{{BBC Continents Series}}\n\n[[Category:National Geographic (American TV channel) original programming]]\n[[Category:BBC television documentaries]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about nature]]\n[[Category:BBC high definition shows]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:Television series about China]]"}]}}}}
