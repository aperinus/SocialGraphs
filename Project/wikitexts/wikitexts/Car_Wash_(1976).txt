Directed by [[Michael Schultz]] from a screenplay by [[Joel Schumacher]], the film stars [[Franklyn Ajaye]], [[Bill Duke]], [[George Carlin]], [[Irwin Corey]], [[Ivan Dixon]], [[Antonio Fargas]], [[Jack Kehoe]], [[Clarence Muse]], [[Lorraine Gary]], [[The Pointer Sisters]],  [[Richard Pryor]], and [[Garret Morris|Garrett Morris]]. Originally conceived as a musical, ''Car Wash'' is an episodic [[comedy]] about a day in the lives of a close-knit, multiracial group of employees at a [[Los Angeles, California]] [[car wash]] (filmed at a [[Westlake, Los Angeles|Westlake]] car wash at the corner of Rampart Boulevard and 6th Street) and their boss, Leon \"Mr. B\" Barrow ([[Sully Boyar]]).\n\n==Plot==\nOver a single Friday in July, the Dee-Luxe Car Wash hosts all manner of strange visitors, including a hysterical wealthy woman from [[Beverly Hills]] dealing with a carsick son. Money-hungry [[evangelism|evangelist]] \"Daddy Rich\", who preaches a pseudo-gospel of [[prosperity theology]], appears with his loyal (and singing) entourage, The Wilson Sisters. One main character is Abdullah Mohammed Akbar, formerly Duane, a tall Black revolutionary and recent convert to Islam who dismisses Daddy Rich's preaching when the quartet visit and collect donations from the employees. Among many other misadventures, the employees must deal with a man they believe is the notorious \"pop bottle bomber\" being sought that day by the police. It alarms employees, customers, and the owner of the car wash, Leon \"Mr. B\" Barrow, but the strange man's \"bomb\" turns out to be simply a urine sample he is taking to the hospital for a liver test.\n\nMr. B's son Irwin, a left-wing college student who smokes [[Cannabis (drug)|pot]] in the men's restroom and carries around a copy of ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao]]'', insists on spending a day with the \"working class\" employees, whom he considers \"brothers\" in the \"struggle\". As he prepares for work, he sets off motion sensors that give him the first \"human car wash\", which he good-naturedly accepts (though while pot-induced). A taxi driver searches fruitlessly for a prostitute named Marleen, who stiffed him for a fare earlier and has her own hopes shattered later on as a customer with whom she apparently has fallen in love has given her a false telephone number. Meanwhile, middle-aged ex-convict Lonnie, the foreman of the car wash, tries to mentor Abdullah while struggling to raise two young children and fend off his parole officer. Abdullah confronts the flamboyant homosexual Lindy and sharply criticizes his [[Transvestitism|cross-dressing]], to which Lindy coolly replies, \"Honey, I am more man than you'll ever be and more woman than you'll ever get.\"\n\nTheodore Chauncey \"T.C.\" Elcott, another young employee, is determined to win a radio call-in contest to win tickets for a rock concert and to convince his estranged girlfriend Mona, a waitress working in a diner across the street, to accompany him, eventually succeeding. Musicians Floyd and Lloyd, who have an audition for an agent when their shift ends, spend the entire movie rehearsing their jazz-blues dance moves in front of bewildered customers. Meanwhile, an employee named Justin clashes with his girlfriend, Loretta, who wants him to return to college, but he declines, feeling that a black man like him will not get anywhere in the world with any kind of education. His elderly grandfather, Snapper, works as the shoe shine man at the car wash and is a follower of Daddy Rich.\n\nOther employees include sly womanizer Geronimo, a thin, African-American with feathers in his hair; cowboy Scruggs, the gas pump operator; overweight, good-natured Hippo, who clearly hooks up with Marleen; a scheming Latino named Chuco; a Native American named Goody, who wears a hat with pig ears; scruffy middle-aged Charlie; con artist and bookie Sly, who later gets arrested right at the car wash for a series of unpaid parking tickets; and the uptight Earl, who sees himself as superior to his colleagues because he does not get wet; he would appear to think that he is the supervisor at the car wash.\n\nAmong everything, Mr. B constantly flirts with the young, busty cashier/receptionist Marsha to escape his troubled home life. Constantly tense, he worries about his car wash going out of business due to a competitor a few miles down the street. Lonnie, conversely, has numerous ideas on how to save the car wash, but everyone else, including the miserly Mr. B, ignores him. Later, Abdullah, after being fired by Mr. B for his unexplained absences from work for the past several weeks, appears in the office with a gun while Lonnie is closing up, intending to rob the business. Lonnie dissuades him, and the two commiserate at the status society has imposed on them: two proud men forced to work at a meaningless job for meager pay. The day ends melancholically as everyone goes their separate ways, knowing that they will be back tomorrow to do it all over again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Franklyn Ajaye]] as Theodore Chauncey \"T.C.\" Elcott\n* [[Sully Boyar]] as Leon \"Mr. B\" Barrow\n* Richard Brestoff as Irwin Barrow\n* [[Carmine Caridi]] as Foolish Father\n* [[George Carlin]] as Taxi Driver\n* [[Irwin Corey]] as \"The Mad Bomber\"\n* [[Ivan Dixon]] as Lonnie\n* [[Bill Duke]] as Duane / Abdullah\n* [[Antonio Fargas]] as Lindy\n* Michael Fennell as Calvin\n* [[Arthur French (actor)|Arthur French]] as Charlie\n* [[Lorraine Gary]] as Hysterical Lady\n* Darrow Igus as Floyd\n* [[Leonard Jackson (actor)|Leonard Jackson]] as Earl\n* [[DeWayne Jessie]] (a.k.a.

Their scenes were restored for the edited television version.\n\nThe film also featured the speaking voices of local L.A. disc jockeys Jay Butler, [[J. J. Jackson (media personality)|J. J. Jackson]], Rod McGrew, Sarina C.

B1.</ref>\n\nWhile it did well at the box-office, it still fell short of the high expectations Universal had, probably because of the declining market for black-oriented films at the time.\n\nSince the film's initial release, it has had a small but constant following as a [[cult film]], some notable disciples including [[Michael Bay]] and Sandford Bay.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The film won the Best Music Award and the Technical Grand Prize at the [[1977 Cannes Film Festival]] plus a [[nomination]] for the [[Palme d'Or]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2018/year/1977.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Car Wash |access-date=2009-05-10 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924030155/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2018/year/1977.html |archive-date=2011-09-24 }}</ref> In the same year it was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]], plus it won a [[Grammy]] for Best Album of Original Score written for a Motion Picture or Television Special.\n\nGay film historian [[Vito Russo]] cites the character Lindy, played by [[Antonio Fargas]], as being both funny and challenging through his gay militancy. Russo deems Lindy's response to the militant Abdullah as being potentially revolutionary had it not been placed strictly within a comedic context.<ref>Russo, pp. 228\u201429</ref> African American cultural critic Angela Nelson identifies Lindy as a \"sophisticated sissy.\"<ref>Means Coleman, p. 142</ref> The \"sophisticated sissy\" characterization is often used as an easy contrast to the \"appropriate\" masculine behaviour that heterosexual black male characters are expected to display.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Car Wash (soundtrack)}}\n''[[Car Wash (soundtrack)|Car Wash]]'', recorded by [[Rose Royce]], was a major success, yielding three Billboard R&B Top Ten singles: \"[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]\", \"I Wanna Get Next to You\", and \"I'm Going Down\". The title track, written and produced by [[Norman Whitfield]], was a #1 hit and was one of the biggest hit singles of the [[disco]] era.  Meanwhile, The Pointer Sisters' \"You Gotta Believe\"\u2014which the group performed during their cameo in the film\u2014was a Top Twenty R&B hit. The ''Car Wash'' soundtrack won a 1977 [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album]].<ref name=ALLMUSIC>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p137694/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic Biography]</ref>\n\n==Versions==\n''Car Wash'' had its network television premiere on ''[[The NBC Monday Movie|NBC Monday Night at the Movies]]'' in 1978. Along with the standard dubbing of strong language, many scenes that included the gay character Lindy (Fargas) were trimmed or deleted. To replace these shortened scenes, and therefore shortened film, a subplot of a diner owner ([[Danny DeVito]]) (scenes shot for the theatrical version but cut prior to release) were re-inserted. As of 2013, commercially available versions of the movie were of the original theatrical release, not the revised TV version.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Means Coleman, Robin R.
