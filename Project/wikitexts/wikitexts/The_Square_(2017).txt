The film stars [[Claes Bang]], [[Elisabeth Moss]], [[Dominic West]] and [[Terry Notary]].\n\nA [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish]] production with co-production support from [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[Cinema of France|France]] and [[Cinema of Denmark|Denmark]], it was shot in [[Gothenburg]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Berlin]]. The story was partly inspired by an installation \u00d6stlund and producer [[Kalle Boman]] had made. \u00d6stlund was also inspired by a notorious incident involving [[Oleg Kulik]] and cast Notary in a parody, drawing on Notary's experience imitating apes.\n\nThe film was entered into the [[2017 Cannes Film Festival]], where it received positive reviews and won the [[Palme d'Or]]. It was subsequently selected for the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival]]. It went on to win six [[30th European Film Awards|European Film Awards]], including [[European Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]]; two [[53rd Guldbagge Awards|Guldbagge Awards]], including [[Guldbagge Award for Best Director|Best Director]]; and other honours. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[90th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:\u0413\u041e\u0421\u0422 2.410-68. \u041a\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442, \u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a.svg|200px|thumb|''The Square'' is presented as a simple outline.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/arts-culture/2017/12/26/the-square-unsettling-portrait-of-modern-art-world |title='The Square': Unsettling portrait of modern art world |work=[[Daily Sabah]] |last=Haliloglu |first=Nagihan |date=25 December 2017 |access-date=25 March 2018 |publisher=Turkuvaz Media Group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325221753/https://www.dailysabah.com/arts-culture/2017/12/26/the-square-unsettling-portrait-of-modern-art-world |archive-date=25 March 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\n\nChristian is the [[curator]] of the X-Royal [[art museum]] in [[Stockholm]], formerly the [[Royal Palace, Stockholm|Royal Palace]]. He is interviewed by journalist Anne, struggling to explain museum parlance. Later, Christian is pulled into a confrontation at a pedestrian zone, after which he notices that his smartphone and wallet are missing, presumably stolen in a [[confidence trick]]. Christian is able to track the position of his phone on his computer, which he and his assistant Michael trace to a large apartment block.\n\nThey write a threatening anonymous letter demanding the return of the phone and wallet by depositing them at a nearby [[7-Eleven]]. Christian throws a copy of the letter in each apartment mailbox that night. Several days later, a package for him is deposited at the store, containing the phone and the completely untouched wallet.\n\nEuphoric after the success of his plan, Christian goes to a party where he meets Anne again, before ending up in her apartment. After the two have sex, Anne offers to throw away a used condom but he steadfastly refuses to hand it over to her. They argue over the situation, as she believes he does not trust her to dispose of the semen rather than take it. Several days later, Anne meets Christian in the museum and states she is looking for more than [[casual sex]]. She asks him if he feels the same, but Christian is evasive. When Anne later tries to call him, he does not pick up the phone.\n\nThe day after picking up the package, Christian is informed that a second one has arrived for him at the 7-Eleven. Suspicious, he sends Michael to pick it up. In the store, Michael is confronted by a young Arab boy who states that his parents believe that he is a thief because of the letter and demands that Christian apologizes to him and his family. Otherwise, the boy threatens to create \"chaos\" for him.\n\nLater, the boy visits Christian's home and confronts him, along with his two young daughters, on the staircase. Christian tries to send him away but the boy begins to knock on doors and screaming for help. In a fit of frustration, Christian pushes the boy down the stairs, though no one comes to his aid. Disturbed, Christian desperately searches the trash outside the house for a note which contains the boy's phone number. After finding it and unsuccessfully trying to call him, Christian records an apologetic video message.\n\nIn the midst of these troubles, Christian has to manage the promotion of a new exhibition centered on an art piece called ''The Square'' by Lola Arias,{{Notetag|Real-life Argentine artist [[Lola Arias]] was not involved in creating the film's titular work, and publicly denounced director Ruben \u00d6stlund for using her name without her consent.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/lola-arias-the-square-director-ruben-ostlund-stole-my-name/ |title=Lola Arias: 'The Square' director Ruben \u00d6stlund stole my name |work=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=15 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215130618/http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/lola-arias-the-square-director-ruben-ostlund-stole-my-name/ |archive-date=15 February 2018 |access-date=10 August 2018}}</ref> \u00d6stlund denied the allegation, saying that she had agreed to it and was misremembering their interaction.

Within it we all share equal rights and obligations.\"\n\nThe [[advertising agency]] commissioned by the museum to promote ''The Square'' states that they need to harness [[social media]] attention with something other than the uncontroversial and bland artist's statement. Advertising agency representatives consider a depiction of violence contradicting ''The Square''{{'}}s message, developing a promotional clip showing an impoverished white blond girl entering ''The Square'' and being killed in an explosion. The video is published on the museum's website and [[YouTube]] channel after a distracted Christian gives his approval without viewing it.\n\nThe clip goes [[viral video|viral]], quickly reaching 300,000 YouTube views, but receives an extremely hostile response from the media, religious leaders and the general public. The museum arranges a press conference, where Christian states he violated protocol and is stepping down as curator in mutual agreement with the board. Several journalists then attack him for stirring up cheap controversy with a tasteless clip, while others attack him for [[self-censorship]] because of his resignation.\n\nFeeling guilty about wronging the boy, Christian drives to the apartment block several days later and tries to find him and his family. Christian talks to a neighbour who states that he knew the boy but that his family has moved away. \n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{multiple image\n | align        = right\n | direction    = horizontal\n | footer       = [[Claes Bang]], [[Elisabeth Moss]] and [[Dominic West]] star.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieinsider.com/m14729/the-square |title=The Square |work=[[Movie Insider]] |access-date=13 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013222116/http://www.movieinsider.com/m14729/the-square |archive-date=13 October 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n | footer_align = left\n | width        = \n | image1       = Claes Bang 2015-09-10.jpg\n | width1       = 120\n | alt1         = \n | image2       = The Bleeder 02 (29763240336).jpg\n | width2       = 125\n | alt2         = \n | image3       = Pride 19 (15272157542).jpg\n | width3       = 125\n | alt3         = \n}}\nThe story for the film was conceived when director [[Ruben \u00d6stlund]] and producer [[Kalle Boman]] entered an installation into the Vandalorum Museum in [[V\u00e4rnamo]] in 2014.<ref name=\"Page\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/arts/cannes-2017-the-square-ruben-ostlund/ |title=Cannes 2017: 'The Square' skewers the dark side of the art world |last=Page |first=Thomas |work=CNN Style |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=24 May 2017 |access-date=28 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524123346/http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/arts/cannes-2017-the-square-ruben-ostlund/ |archive-date=24 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In their artists' statement, they wrote \"The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring.
