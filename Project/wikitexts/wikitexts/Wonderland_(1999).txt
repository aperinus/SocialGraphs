Meanwhile, Molly is pregnant but her husband Eddie has left his job without telling her.\n\nEileen and Bill, their parents, are virtually estranged since the departure of their eldest son Darren, who they have not heard from since he left home; having left, he is the only happy one in the family.<ref name=mitchell/> Eileen takes her unsaid frustrations out on the neighbour's barking dog, poisoning it when it prevents her from sleeping.\n\nFranklin is an over-sensitive man who frequents the coffee house where Nadia works. He is unable to summon the courage to talk to her, instead listening to music he thinks she would like alone in his bedroom. Nadia sleeps with one of her dates, the handsome Tim, but he is not really interested in her.<ref name=realists/> Molly and Eddie have a fight when she discovers he has left his job and he leaves. She goes into labour believing he has permanently left her, but he has really had an accident on his motorbike. Debbie's son, Jack, is mugged when his father Dan leaves him alone and Jack goes off on his own to watch fireworks. Darren finally calls to let his family know that he is fine and Franklin has enough courage to talk to Nadia. Molly and Eddie are reunited at hospital after the birth of their daughter, Alice, a name Eddie selected because of [[Alice in Wonderland]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Debbie\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Nadia\n* [[Molly Parker]] as Molly\n* [[Ian Hart]] as Dan\n* [[John Simm]] as Eddie\n* [[Stuart Townsend]] as Tim\n* [[Kika Markham]] as Eileen\n* [[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]] as Bill\n* [[Enzo Cilenti]] as Darren\n* [[Sarah-Jane Potts]] as Melanie\n* [[David Fahm]] as Franklyn\n* [[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]] as Donna\n* Peter Marfleet as Jack\n* [[Nathan Constance]] as Alex\n* Anton Saunders as Danny\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film's French writer, Laurence Coriat, was previously a psychology student.<ref name=\"realists\">{{cite news |last=Fuller |first=Graham |date=23 July 2000 |title=A New Generation of Realists Scrap The Kitchen Sink |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/23/movies/film-a-new-generation-of-realists-scrap-the-kitchen-sink.html |access-date=9 February 2011}}</ref> Winterbottom said that the script began in a similar way to ''[[Short Cuts]]'' and \"the connections between the stories were purely down to geography\" but was rewritten so that \"the story of one sister tells you something about the other two.\"<ref name=jeffries/> Cinematographer [[Sean Bobbitt]] had previously only worked on documentaries and news footage.<ref name=greatest/>\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=20%|quote=I was ... interested in exploring the emotional connections between people in a family who rarely meet, and in capturing the noise and excitement of London and the exhaustion of trying to keep your head above water in a place where you've got seven million people around you whose lives you don't know.|source=\u2014Winterbottom, 2000<ref name=realists/>}}\n\nThe film has both realist and impressionist elements.<ref name=unbearable/> [[Time lapse photography]] is used to give moments of accelerated motion as the characters are followed,<ref name=mitchell/><ref name=realists/> which Winterbottom said was inspired by Wong Kar-Wai's ''[[Chungking Express]]'' and gave an impressionistic feeling,<ref name=greatest/> \"a rush of poignant colours and noise\",<ref name=jeffries/> and other footage is filmed on grainy hand-held 16mm cameras, giving a realist \"[[fly-on-the-wall]]\" feeling.<ref name=realists/><ref name=greatest/> The sex scenes are realistic and awkward \u2013 the scene between Nadia and Tim features no music, which highlights the sounds of kissing and rustling.<ref name=greatest/> A small crew was used, with only natural lighting and no sound boom.
