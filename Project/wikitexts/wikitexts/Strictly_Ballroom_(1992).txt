The film is the first in his \"[[Red Curtain Trilogy]]\" of theatre-motif-related films; it was followed by 1996's ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' and 2001's ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]''<ref>http://www.screensoundjournal.org/issues/n4/06.%20SSJ%20n4%20Coyle.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>\n\n''Strictly Ballroom'' is based on a critically acclaimed stage play originally set up in 1984 by Luhrmann and fellow students during his studies at the [[National Institute of Dramatic Arts]] in [[Sydney]]. An expanded version of the play became a success at the Czechoslovakian Youth Drama Festival in Bratislava in 1986, and, in 1988, it had a successful season at Sydney's [[Wharf Theatre]], where it was seen by Australian music executive [[Ted Albert]] and his wife Antoinette. They both loved it, and, when Albert soon after set up the film production company M&A Productions with ex-[[Film Australia]] producer Tristram Miall, they offered Luhrmann their plan to [[film adaptation|transform his play into a film]].<ref name=Jane_Albert>{{cite book|first=Jane|last=Albert|title=House Of Hits: The Great Untold Story Of Australia's First Family Of Music|publisher=Hardie Grant Books|location=Richmond, Australia|date=2010|isbn= 978-1740668811|pages=316\u2013331}}</ref> He agreed on the condition that he would also get to direct it.<ref name=Musical>[http://www.strictlyballroomthemusical.com/about/timeline/ Strictly Ballroom The Musical: ''Timeline''] Linked 2014-07-10</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nScott Hastings, the frustrated son of a family of [[ballroom dance]]rs, has been training since the age of six. His mother Shirley teaches ballroom dancing, and his father Doug meekly handles maintenance chores at the dance studio, while secretly watching old footage of his bygone dance competitions as well as Scott's in a back room. Scott struggles to establish his personal style of dance to win the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Dancing Championship, but his innovative and flashy \"crowd-pleasing\" steps are not considered \"strictly ballroom\", and as such are denounced by Australian Dancing Federation head Barry Fife.\n\nScott and his dancing partner Liz Holt lose the Southern Districts Waratah Championships due to Scott dancing his own steps. Three days later, Liz leaves him to team up with Ken Railings, the recent Waratah Championships winner; his partner Pam Short has broken both her legs in a car accident (as just previously wished upon by Liz). With Scott now alone only three weeks until the championships, Shirley teams up with his coach Les Kendall, her co-instructor at the studio, to start desperately hunting for a new partner for him. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to both, Scott is approached by Fran, an overlooked \"beginner\" dancer at the studio. He eventually agrees to partner with her, intrigued by her willingness to dance \"his way\".\n\nThe pairing faces its first hurdle when Fife, attempting to prevent Scott from threatening the Dancesport status quo, arranges for his partnership with established Champion dancer Tina Sparkle. When Shirley and Les hear the news, they are overjoyed. Fran, happening upon them exclaiming over their happiness about Scott's new dance partner, misunderstands initially and believes they have discovered that she and Scott have become partners. When she realises the truth, she leaves, devastated. Scott pursues her and, although she is hurt, entices her to dance backstage with him, and her anger is forgotten. However, several onlookers witness their dance, including Shirley and Les, who then do everything possible to persuade both Scott and Fran that the best way forward for all concerned is for Scott to forget about Fran and sign on as Tina Sparkle's partner.\n\nFran, accused of damaging Scott's chances, reluctantly accedes and returns home crestfallen. Scott argues with his mother, telling her and all he won't be manipulated; essentially, he won't become Tina's partner. He follows Fran home, where her overprotective Spanish father, Rico, discovers and challenges him. To appease Rico, Scott proposes a [[Paso Doble]] for the assembled company. Rico and Fran's grandmother Ya Ya demonstrate the proper Paso Doble technique and offer to teach the couple, who spend the next week training with Fran's family. However, Fife intervenes, telling Scott that Doug ruined his own career by dancing his own steps, which he has regretted ever since. Unwilling to upset his parents further, Scott re-teams with Liz to attempt to win the Pan-Pacific.\n\nDuring the competition, Doug explains to Scott that Fife lied: Fife had convinced Shirley to dance with Les instead of Doug so that Fife could win the competition. It is also revealed that Fife is plotting to sabotage Scott in favor of audience favorite, Ken. Scott runs after Fran and persuades her to dance with him.\n\nIn the next round, Scott and Fran make a dramatic entrance and begin dancing, immediately riveting the audience. Fife tries to disqualify them, but Scott's friend Wayne Burns, having overheard Fife's treachery along with his partner Vanessa Cronin, disconnects the [[PA system]], allowing Scott and Fran to dance a Paso Doble routine that impresses the audience. Desperate, Fife tries to turn off the music, but Scott's younger sister Kylie and her partner Luke interfere until Fife's girlfriend Charm Leachman disconnects the sound system. Fife then disqualifies Scott and Fran, but Doug begins clapping out a beat to enable the pair to continue dancing. The audience claps along, as Scott and Fran resume dancing. Liz, having had a [[wikt:change of heart|change of heart]], turns on Fife and Leachman and restores the music, and Scott and Fran's spirited dancing brings down the house. Doug asks Shirley to dance with him and the whole audience joins them on the floor. As the performance finishes, Scott and Fran kiss, the competition forgotten.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Mercurio]] as Scott Hastings\n* [[Tara Morice]] as Fran\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as Barry Fife\n* [[Pat Thomson]] as Shirley Hastings, Scott's mother\n* [[Gia Carides]] as Liz Holt\n* [[Peter Whitford]] as Les Kendall, Scott's coach\n* [[Barry Otto]] as Doug Hastings, Scott's father and Shirley's husband\n* John Hannan as Ken Railings\n* [[Sonia Kruger]] as Tina Sparkle\n* [[Kris McQuade]] as Charm Leachman, Barry's girlfriend\n* Pip Mushin as Wayne Burns, Scott's best friend\n* Leonie Page as Vanessa Cronin, Wayne's partner and fianc\u00e9 and Liz's best friend\n* Antonio Vargas as Rico, Fran's father\n* Armonia Benedito as Ya Ya, Fran's grandmother\n* Jack Webster as Terry Best\n* Michael Burgess as Merv\n* [[Lauren Hewett]] as Kylie Hastings, Scott's sister\n* Steve Grace as Luke, Kylie's dance partner\n* Kerry Shrimpton as Pam Short\n\n==Production history==\nThe film version of ''Strictly Ballroom'' was developed from an original short play of the same name. It drew on Luhrmann's own life experience\u2014he had studied ballroom dancing as a child and his mother worked as a ballroom dance teacher in his teens<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fidler|first1=Richard|title=Conversations with Richard Fidler: Baz Luhrmann|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/02/11/3942283.htm|website=ABC Radio: Conversations with Richard Fidler|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Company|access-date=21 May 2015|ref=ConFidler|date=11 February 2014}}</ref> and inspired by the life of Keith Bain (who grew up in the same town as Luhrmann).<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Baz Luhrmann (Director/co-writer) |year=2002 |title=''Audio commentary from'' Strictly Ballroom |medium=DVD |publisher=Miramax}}</ref> While studying at NIDA in the early 1980s, Luhrmann and a group of fellow students devised a short comedy-drama set in the cutthroat world of competitive ballroom dancing.<ref name=Jane_Albert/> This original 1984 NIDA production was a critical success and, after graduating, Luhrmann was invited to re-stage the play for the Czechoslovakian Youth Drama Festival in [[Bratislava]] in 1986. He invited his school friend Craig Pearce to help him rewrite and expand the script. With its themes of artistic repression and underdogs battling against the odds, the play was a success at the festival, winning both the best director and best production awards.<ref name=Jane_Albert/>\n[[File:DarlingIslandJunction.jpg|thumb|right|''Strictly Ballroom'' film set used for Fran's family business and residence. (site since redeveloped, approx. to the [[Star City Casino]] complex, [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]])]]\nThis led Luhrmann to direct more theatre productions back in Australia, and in 1988, as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations, the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] invited him to establish an experimental theatre ensemble, Six Years Old, which took up a residency at [[The Wharf Theatre]] for that year.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Alongside Luhrmann and Pearce, the new company included one of the original NIDA collaborators, actor [[Catherine McClements]], plus production designer [[Catherine Martin (designer)|Catherine Martin]] (whom Luhrmann subsequently married), set dresser [[Bill Marron]] and costume designer [[Angus Strathie]], all of whom went on to collaborate with Luhrmann on his films. The group work-shopped the expanded version of play, which had a trial season at the [[World Expo 88|Brisbane Expo]] in 1988 before opening at the Wharf Studios on 24 September 1988.<ref name=Jane_Albert/>\n\nDuring its successful run at the Wharf, the play was seen by an influential Australian music executive. [[Ted Albert]] was a leading record producer and music publisher, best known in Australia as the discoverer and original producer of 1960s pop sensations [[The Easybeats]]. By the time he saw ''Strictly Ballroom'', Albert was the managing director of his family-owned music publishing company [[Albert Music]] (formerly J. Albert & Sons) and its subsidiary, the highly successful record label [[Albert Productions]], which scored a string of hits in the 1970s and 1980s with acts including [[John Paul Young]] and [[AC/DC]].\n\nAlbert's wife Antoinette (known as \"Popsy\") took him to see the play after seeing a newspaper ad; they loved the energy, colour and musicality of the play and Ted Albert immediately saw the potential to develop the play into a film using the musical resources available to him through Alberts' publishing and recording enterprises. Soon after, Ted set up the film production company M&A Productions with ex-[[Film Australia]] producer Tristram Miall; they tracked Luhrmann down through NIDA and approached him with the offer to transform his play into a movie.<ref name=Jane_Albert/> In its early stages, with the involvement of writer [[Andrew Bovell]], the script took a more serious tone, including a subplot set around the trade union at the [[BHP Steelworks|BHP steelworks]] in the industrial city of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. Luhrmann balked at the move towards naturalism and eventually, with Albert's agreement, the director brought in his old friend Craig Pearce, who was able to translate Luhrmann's theatrical vision into a workable screenplay.<ref name=Jane_Albert/>\n\nThe producers had difficulty in securing funding for the project, which mostly featured a cast of newcomers. The only \"bankable names\" in the cast were [[Barry Otto]] and screen veteran [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]], and although co-star Paul Mercurio was well known as a dancer through his work with the [[Sydney Dance Company]], ''Strictly Ballroom'' was his first acting role. With the original budget set at over [[AUD]] 5 million, government film funding bodies were reluctant to back such a left-field project with few major names in the credits. The script was then pared back and the subplot dropped, but when Miall approached the [[Film Finance Corporation]], he was told that they would not back such a high-budget film (in Australian terms) with a first-time director. He was told to replace Luhrmann, but he refused, promising to make further cuts. Miall and Albert then pared the budget down to AUD 3.3 million and the FFA then agreed to provide around 65%, on condition that the producers were able to raise the remaining AUD 1 million and secure a local distributor. They sent Luhrmann to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in hopes of finding an overseas distributor, but this came to nothing. After returning to Australia, Miall and Luhrmann had a fortuitous meeting with Andrew Pike, head of the [[Canberra]]-based independent distribution company Ronin Films. Intrigued by Luhrmann's colourful pitch which involved sketches, set miniatures and pieces of costume, Pike agreed to back a limited local release, although he later admitted that, had he seen only the script, he would probably have turned it down.<ref name=Jane_Albert/>\n\nAlthough the FFC funding was now in the pipeline, the production faced its most serious challenge when, on 11 November 1990, Ted Albert died suddenly from a heart attack (the film is dedicated to him). This threw the entire project into doubt, but Ted Albert's widow Popsy decided that it should go to completion in honour of her husband, so she took over as executive producer, with Miall as producer. With her blessing, Ted's family company Albert Music invested AUD 1 million, with the remaining AUD 300,000 sourced from private investors. Even after completion, the team were greeted with stiff resistance from exhibitors: Luhrmann recalled that one exhibitor walked out before the film had even finished, declaring that Luhrmann was ruined and that he would never work again.<ref name=Jane_Albert/>\n\nThe film was accepted for the Cannes Film Festival, but another tragedy struck just before its first screening\u2014actress Pat Thomson, who played Scott's mother, was diagnosed with cancer and she died in April 1992, only one month before its Cannes world premiere in May. ''Strictly Ballroom'' had its first public screening at midnight in the ''[[Un Certain Regard]]'' programme and proved to be an instant hit\u2014the cast and crew received a fifteen-minute standing ovation, which was repeated the following night; it became one of the major hits of the festival, winning the ''Prix De Jeunesse'' and triggering a bidding war among international distributors.<ref name=Jane_Albert/>\n\nIt was a huge success when released in Australia in August, and it swept the field at the 1992 AFI awards, gaining 13 nominations and winning in eight major categories. It was also a major success at the 1993 [[BAFTA]] awards, gaining eight nominations and winning three awards for 'Best Costume Design', 'Best Original Film Score' and 'Best Production Design'. Other major accolades included a 1994 [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Picture, 'Newcomer of the Year' at the 1993 [[London Critics Circle Film Awards]], the 'People's Choice' award at the 1992 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and 'Most Popular Film' at the 1992 [[Vancouver International Film Festival]].\n\n==Home video==\nThe film was released on DVD on 19 March 2002 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|first=Enrique|last=Rivero|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/Product_article.cfm?article_ID=2713|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604205945/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/Product_article.cfm?article_ID=2713|title=Director Luhrmann Is Busy On the DVD Front|website=hive4media.com|archive-date=4 June 2002|date=March 7, 2002|access-date=September 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Strictly Ballroom'' holds a rating of 89% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 46 reviews.
