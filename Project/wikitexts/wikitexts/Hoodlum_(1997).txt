The film concentrates on [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth \"Bumpy\" Johnson]] ([[Laurence Fishburne]]), [[Dutch Schultz]] ([[Tim Roth]]), and [[Lucky Luciano]] ([[Andy Garc\u00eda]]).<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0119311|title=Hoodlum}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1934, [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth \u201cBumpy\u201d Johnson]] ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) is released from [[Sing Sing]] and returns to [[Harlem]], where mobster [[Dutch Schultz]] ([[Tim Roth]]) asserts his control of the lucrative [[numbers game]]. Schultz begrudgingly reports to [[American Mafia|Mafia]] boss [[Lucky Luciano|Charles \u201cLucky\u201d Luciano]] ([[Andy Garcia]]), who pays bribes to special prosecutor [[Thomas E. Dewey]] ([[William Atherton]]) to protect his business.\n\nReuniting with his cousin \"Illinois\" Gordon ([[Chi McBride]]), Bumpy returns to the employ of Harlem crime boss [[Stephanie St. Clair|Madame Queen]] ([[Cicely Tyson]]), whose business is threatened by Schultz. Bumpy is introduced to Francine ([[Vanessa Williams]]), a friend of Illinois\u2019 girlfriend Mary ([[Loretta Devine]]). Schultz\u2019s meeting with the Queen ends in a standoff when he presents her with a rival\u2019s [[testicle]]s. Walking Francine home from a club, Bumpy charms her with his poetry.\n\nMadame Queen is attacked by Schultz\u2019s men, led by black enforcer Bub Hewlett ([[Clarence Williams III]]), but Bumpy and fellow mobster Whispers ([[Paul Benjamin]]) repel the assassins and rescue her. At a meeting of the [[The Commission (mafia)|Commission]], Schultz states his determination to take over Harlem. After robbing Schultz\u2019s operation with Illinois, Bumpy is chastised by Madame Queen for making his own decisions. Schultz then hires two hitmen, the Salke brothers, to kill Bumpy, and has his police contact, [[NYPD]] Captain Foley ([[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]]), arrange for Madame Queen's arrest. At a party, a 17-year-old named Tyrone asks Bumpy for a job, and Francine struggles to reconcile her feelings for Bumpy with his criminal ways.\n\nThe Salkes break into Bumpy\u2019s home, killing his guards, but Bumpy ambushes them and kills one while a terrified Francine shoots the other dead. Illinois is beaten and robbed by Foley and his officers, while Madame Queen is arrested for illegal gambling. Taking over her operation, Bumpy enlists Tyrone as a runner, and ignores the Queen\u2019s orders to avoid violence. By May 1935, he is locked in an all-out war with Schultz. His wealth and power grow, as does the body count, including Tyrone. Bumpy\u2019s attempt to comfort Tyrone\u2019s mother at his funeral is rejected.\n\nAt an [[ice cream parlor]] with Francine, Bumpy realizes his [[banana split]] has been poisoned. When the shop owner reveals that Bumpy\u2019s associate Vallie ordered him to hire the new teenage employee responsible, Bumpy forces the boy to eat the poisoned ice cream despite his attempts to apologize. Whispers then kills Vallie with a razor. Bumpy confronts Schultz at the [[Cotton Club]] with Vallie\u2019s severed finger, demanding he cease his Harlem operations, but Schultz refuses.\n\nDisguised as truck drivers, Bumpy and Illinois deliver a bomb to one of Schultz\u2019s illicit [[brewery|breweries]], narrowly escaping before the warehouse explodes. Illinois returns home to find Schultz had Mary killed in retaliation. Threatened by Dewey to end the bloodshed in Harlem, Luciano invites Bumpy and Schultz to a meeting, against both their wills.\n\nVisiting Madame Queen in prison, Bumpy is rebuked for inciting a gang war. Finding she can no longer accept who he is, Francine leaves him, and Illinois drunkenly confronts him over the innocent lives lost. Illinois is abducted and tortured by Foley, to Hewlett\u2019s disgust, but refuses to betray his cousin. At Luciano\u2019s meeting, Bumpy and Schultz refuse to settle their dispute. After finding Illinois\u2019 corpse left as a message, Bumpy slits Foley\u2019s throat while he's with a black prostitute, but spares Hewlett\u2019s life and offers him a partnership.\n\nBumpy accepts an alliance with Luciano, and Luciano\u2019s driver \u2013 on Bumpy\u2019s orders \u2013 informs Schultz that Bumpy will be meeting with Luciano\u2019s accountant. Schultz and his men burst in but find only the accountant, whom Schultz kills. At a restaurant, Schultz\u2019s long-suffering henchman Lulu ([[Ed O'Ross]]) shoots him in the bathroom, and Schultz calmly returns to his table before dying. Meeting Luciano outside for payment, Lulu is shot dead. With Dutch eliminated and the gang war settled, Dewey \u2013 having received an enormous bribe from Bumpy, delivered by Hewlett \u2013 warns Luciano to stay away from Harlem. Hewlett and Bumpy part ways, and Bumpy arrives at Illinois\u2019 funeral. After exchanging looks with Francine and Madame Queen, Bumpy walks out into the rain alone.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson]]\n* [[Tim Roth]] as [[Dutch Schultz|Arthur Flegenheimer / Dutch Schultz]]\n* [[Andy Garcia]] as [[Lucky Luciano|Charles 'Lucky' Luciano]]\n* [[Vanessa Williams]] as Francine Hughes\n* [[Cicely Tyson]] as [[Stephanie St. Clair|Stephanie 'Madam Queen' St. Clair]]\n* [[Chi McBride]] as Illinois Gordon\n* [[Clarence Williams III]] as 'Bub' Hewlett\n* [[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]] as Captain Jack Foley\n* [[William Atherton]] as [[Thomas E.
