B. Rogers|James B. Rogers]] and written by [[Adam Herz]] and [[David H. Steinberg]] from a story by Herz. A sequel to the 1999 comedy film ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', it is the second film in the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] and stars [[Jason Biggs]], [[Shannon Elizabeth]], [[Alyson Hannigan]], [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]], [[Natasha Lyonne]], [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]], [[Tara Reid]], [[Seann William Scott]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]], and [[Eugene Levy]]. The film follows the sexual exploits of five friends\u2013Jim, Kevin, Stifler, Oz, and Finch\u2013and their attempts to have the greatest summer party ever at a summer beach house in [[Michigan]].\n\n''American Pie 2'' was released in the United States on August 10, 2001, and grossed over $145 million in the US and $142 million overseas on a budget of $30 million, making it highest-grossing film in the franchise at just under $288 million worldwide. The film was followed by ''[[American Wedding]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nHome for the summer after [[college]], Jim Levenstein, Kevin Meyers, Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher, and Paul Finch attend Steve Stifler's party until the police shut it down. Kevin is inspired by his brother to rent a [[Lake Michigan]] beach house and throw a massive party to close out the summer. \n\nThe group obtains jobs painting houses in order to afford the rent. Jim receives a call from former love interest Nadia who informs him that she plans to visit him. To gain sexual experience, Jim seeks out his prom date, Michelle, who agrees to help him after he is mistaken for a [[intellectual disability|mentally disabled]] [[trombone]] prodigy and makes a fool of himself in front of a band camp concert audience.\n\nThe group hosts a small party where Kevin and his ex-girlfriend Vicky awkwardly lie to one another regarding the number of sexual partners they have had at college. Oz attempts to have [[phone sex]] with his girlfriend Heather while she is studying abroad in [[Spain]] but they are interrupted by Stifler.\n\nWhile painting a house, the group observes the two female occupants Stifler assumes are [[lesbians]] and he enters their home while they are away in order to find proof. Jim and Finch pursue him inside in an attempt to stop him when the women return home and find the trio inside. They tempt the boys with some [[quid pro quo]] sex acts. However, when Stifler exposes his genitals after the women request watching the boys give each other [[handjob]]s, Finch and Jim leave in disgust.\n\nJim visits Michelle again to obtain sexual tips and they are nearly caught by a camp director. Stifler brings the group pornography and Jim later accidentally mistakes [[super glue]] for lubricant and learns his penis will be \"unusable\" for a short period of time. Meanwhile, Finch has become involved in the art of [[Tantra]] and waits to use his new skills with Stifler's mom, who he mistakenly believes has arrived but is disappointed when he learns it is Stifler's younger brother.\n\nNadia unexpectedly arrives early, much to the dismay of Jim as his penis has not fully healed. He and Michelle pretend to be in a relationship. However, she realizes that she has fallen in love with him but stages a mock breakup the night of the party so that Jim is free to hook up with Nadia. As the party begins, Jim realizes that he loves Michelle. Jim interrupts her concert performance and they return to the party together. \n\nMeanwhile, Sherman is seduced by Nadia who is attracted to his [[geeky]] persona. Kevin is disappointed to learn Vicky has brought a date and storms off onto the beach. Oz is happy when Heather unexpectedly arrives early. Jim, Oz, and Finch speak to Kevin, who admits he is struggling to move on after high school; but they reassure and convince him to return to the party. The group returns, Kevin apologizes to Vicky, and they all enjoy an evening of partying together. The two \"lesbians\" arrive to the party and later have a [[threesome]] with Stifler.\n\nThe next day, the group prepares to leave when a car pulls up; Finch approaches and finds Stifler's mom inside. They drive off together and have sex again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Jim\n* [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] as Oz\n* [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]] as Kevin\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Stifler\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as Finch\n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as Michelle\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Jessica\n* [[Tara Reid]] as Vicky\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Heather\n* [[Shannon Elizabeth]] as Nadia\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Jim's Dad\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Chuck Sherman, \"The Sherminator\"\n* [[Molly Cheek]] as Jim's Mom\n* [[Denise Faye]] as Danielle\n* Lisa Arturo as Amber\n* [[John Cho]] as John\n* Justin Isfield as Justin\n* [[Eli Marienthal]] as Stifler's Brother\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Kevin's Brother\n* [[George Wyner]] as Camp Director\n* [[Steve Shenbaum]] as Counselor\n* [[Joelle Carter]] as Natalie\n* [[JoAnna Garcia]] as Christy\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] (''uncredited'') as Stifler's Mom\n* [[Adam Brody]] as High School Guy (unrated version only)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:American Pie 2 painters house west view.JPG|thumb|200px|View of [[Los Cerritos, Long Beach, California|Long Beach, California]] home where the five character friends worked to paint this house yellow while vacationing at a lake.]]\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on February 14 and wrapped on April 27, 2001.
