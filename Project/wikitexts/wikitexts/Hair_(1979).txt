Set against the backdrop of the [[hippie]] [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture of the Vietnam era]], the film focuses on a [[Vietnam War]] [[conscription|draftee]] who meets and befriends a \"tribe\" of [[hippie]]s while en route to the army induction center. The hippies and their leader introduce him to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and their environment of unorthodox relationships and [[draft evasion]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] (who was nominated for a [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film|C\u00e9sar Award]] for his work on the film) and adapted for the screen by [[Michael Weller]] (who would collaborate with Forman on a second picture, ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'', two years later). Cast members include [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]], [[Treat Williams]], [[Beverly D'Angelo]], [[Annie Golden]], [[Dorsey Wright]], [[Don Dacus]], [[Cheryl Barnes]] and [[Ronnie Dyson]]. Dance scenes were choreographed by [[Twyla Tharp]], and were performed by Tharp's dancers. The film was nominated for two [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]]: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], and [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor|New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture]] (for Williams).\n\n==Plot==\nClaude Hooper Bukowski of Oklahoma is sent off to New York City after being drafted into the Army (\"Age Of Aquarius\"). Before his draft board-appointment, Claude begins exploring New York, where he encounters a close-knit \"tribe\" of hippies led by George Berger. He observes the hippies panhandle from a trio of horseback riders including Short Hills, New Jersey [[debutante]] Sheila Franklin (\"Sodomy\") and later catches and mounts a runaway horse, which the hippies have rented, exhibiting his riding skills to Sheila (\"Donna\") before then returning the horse to Berger, who offers to show him around.\n\nThat evening, Claude gets stoned on marijuana with Berger and the tribe. He is then introduced to various race and class issues of the 1960s (\"Hashish\", \"Colored Spade\", \"Manchester\", \"I'm Black/Ain't Got No\"). The next morning, Berger finds a newspaper clipping which gives Sheila's address in Short Hills, New Jersey. The tribe members\u2014LaFayette \"Hud\" Johnson, Jeannie Ryan (who is pregnant), and \"Woof Dacshund\"\u2014crash a private dinner party to introduce Claude to Sheila, who secretly enjoys her rigid environment being disrupted (\"I Got Life\"). After Berger and company are arrested, Claude uses his last $50 to bail him out of jail\u2014where Woof resists having his hair cut (\"Hair\").\n\nWhen Sheila is unable to borrow any money from her father, Berger returns to his parents' home. His mother gives him enough cash to bail out his friends. They subsequently attend a peace rally in Central Park, where Claude drops [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]] for the first time (\"Initials\", \"Electric Blues/Old Fashioned Melody\", \"Be In\"). Just as Jeannie proposes marriage to Claude, in order to keep him out of the Army, Sheila shows up to apologize. Claude's \"trip\" reflects his inner conflict over which of three worlds he fits in with: his own native Oklahoman farm culture, Sheila's upper-class society, or the hippies' free-wheeling environment.\n\nAfter his acid trip, Claude falls out with Berger and the tribe members, ostensibly due to a [[practical joke]] they pull on Sheila (taking her clothes while she's skinny-dipping, which forces her to hail a taxi in just her panties), but also due to their philosophical differences over the war in Vietnam\u2014and over personal versus communal responsibility. After wandering the city (\"Where Do I Go?\"), Claude finally reports to the draft board (\u201cBlack Boys/White Boys\u201d), completes his enlistment, and is shipped off to Nevada for basic training.\n\nIt's now Winter in New York when Claude writes to Sheila from Nevada (\"Walking In Space\"), who subsequently shares the news with the others. Berger devises a scheme to visit Claude in Nevada. Meanwhile, Hud's fianc\u00e9e\u2014with whom he has a son, LaFayette Jr.\u2014wants to marry as they had apparently planned to earlier (\"Easy To Be Hard\"). The tribe members trick Sheila's brother Steve out of his car, then head west to visit Claude.\n\nArriving at the Army training center where Claude is stationed (\"Three-Five-Zero-Zero\", \"Good Morning Starshine\"), the hippies are turned away, ostensibly because the base is on alert, but also because the MP on duty loathes their appearance, proceeding to condescendingly caricaturize Berger's perceived vernacular. Sometime later, Sheila chats up army sergeant Fenton at a local bar, using sex to lure him to an isolated desert road and acquire his uniform. The hippies steal his car, and Berger cuts his hair and dons the uniform (symbolically becoming a responsible adult), then drives it onto the Army base. He finds Claude and offers to replace him for the next headcount so that Claude can meet Sheila and the others for a going-away picnic in the desert.\n\nUnfortunately, just after a disguised Claude slips away to the picnic, the base becomes fully activated with immediate ship-outs for Vietnam. Berger's ruse is never discovered; clearly horrified of potentially joining the war, he is herded onto the plane to be shipped out. Claude returns to the empty barracks and frantically pursues Berger's plane but is unable to reach it before it takes off for Southeast Asia (\"The Flesh Failures\").\n\nMonths later, Claude, Sheila, and the tribe gather around Berger's grave in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], whose grave marker shows that he was killed in Vietnam (\"Let the Sunshine In\").  The movie ends with what appears to be a full-scale peace-protest in Washington, D.C.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] as Claude Hooper Bukowski\n* [[Treat Williams]] as George Berger\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Sheila Franklin\n* [[Annie Golden]] as Jeannie Ryan\n* [[Dorsey Wright]] as LaFayette \"Hud\" Johnson\n* [[Don Dacus]] as Woof Daschund\n* [[Nell Carter]] as Central Park singer (\"Ain't Got No\" and \"White Boys\")\n* [[Cheryl Barnes]] as Hud's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Richard Bright (actor)|Richard Bright]] as Sergeant Fenton\n* [[Ellen Foley]] as Black Boys lead singer\n* [[Miles Chapin]] as Steve, Sheila\u2019s brother\n* [[Charlotte Rae]] as Lady in Pink\n* [[Laurie Beechman]] as Black Boys singer\n* [[Nicholas Ray]] as the General\n* [[Antonia Rey]] as Berger's Mother\n* George J.

Scenes were also shot at the [[Fort Irwin National Training Center]], in the [[Mojave Desert]] in northern [[San Bernardino County, California]], and in [[Barstow, California]]; as well as in [[Washington, D.C.]], at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], in the [[National Mall]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079261/locations?ref_=tt_dt_loc \"Hair (1979): Filming & Production,\"] IMDb.

The latter five songs, even though recorded for the film,  were eventually cut, as they slowed the film's pace.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} (These songs are included on the [[Hair: Original Soundtrack Recording|motion picture soundtrack album]].)\n*A few verses from the songs \"Manchester, England\" and a small portion of \"Walking in Space\" have been removed\n*While the songs \"Don't Put It Down\" and \"Somebody to Love\" are not sung by characters in the film, they are both used as background or instrumental music for scenes at the army base. The latter was a new song written by MacDermot for the film. \n*Several other differences from songs in the movie appear on the soundtrack, mainly in omitted verses and different orchestrations. One notable difference is that the Broadway version used only a jazz combo while the movie soundtrack use orchestrations that make ample use of full horn and string sections.<ref name=Allmusic>Ruhlmann, William.

It achieves its goals by rigorously obeying the rules of classic American musical comedy: dialogue, plot, song and dance blend seamlessly to create a juggernaut of excitement. Though every cut and camera angle in ''Hair'' appears to have been carefully conceived, the total effect is spontaneous. Like the best movie musicals of the '50s (''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'') and the '60s (''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''), ''Hair'' leaps from one number to the next.

They felt it failed to capture the essence of ''Hair'' in that hippies were portrayed as \"oddballs\" and \"some sort of aberration\" without any connection to the [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|peace movement]].<ref name=\"Horn117\">Horn, pp. 117\u201318</ref>  Ragni and Rado stated, \"Any resemblance between the 1979 film and the original Biltmore version, other than some of the songs, the names of the characters, and a common title, eludes us.\"<ref name=\"Horn117\" /> In their view, the screen version of ''Hair'' had not yet been produced.<ref name=\"Horn117\" />\n\n*In the musical, Claude is a member of a hippie \"tribe\" sharing a New York City apartment, leading a bohemian lifestyle, enjoying \"free love\", and rebelling against his parents and the draft, but he eventually goes to [[Vietnam]]. In the film, Claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from [[Oklahoma]], newly arrived in New York City to join the military. In New York, he gets caught up with the group of hippies while awaiting deployment to Army training camp. They introduce Claude to their [[psychedelia|psychedelically]] inspired style of living and eventually the tribe drive to Nevada to visit him at training camp.\n*In the musical, Sheila is an outspoken feminist leader of the Tribe who loves Berger as well as Claude. In the film, she is a high-society [[debutante]] who catches Claude's eye.\n*In the film, Berger is not only at the heart of the hippie Tribe but is assigned some of Claude's conflict involving whether or not to obey the draft.   A major plot change in the film involves a mistake that leads Berger to go to Vietnam in Claude's place, where he is killed.\n*The musical focuses on the U.S. [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|peace movement]], as well as the love relationships among the Tribe members, while the film focuses on the carefree antics of the hippies.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote|Hair (musical)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0079261}}\n* {{TCMDb title|17574}}\n* {{AllMovie title|21272}}\n* {{Mojo title|hair}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|hair}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [http://www.trailerfan.com/movie/hair-1979/trailer Trailer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717084743/http://www.trailerfan.com/movie/hair-1979/trailer |date=2011-07-17 }} from trailerfan.com\n\n{{Hair (musical)}}\n{{Milo\u0161 Forman}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Comedy|Film|United States|War}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hair}}\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1979 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s musical comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s war comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American rock musicals]]\n[[Category:American war comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Anti-war comedy films]]\n[[Category:Anti-war films about the Vietnam War]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on musicals]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Milo\u0161 Forman]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Hippie films]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
