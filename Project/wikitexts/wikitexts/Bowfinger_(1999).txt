The film depicts a down-and-out filmmaker in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] attempting to make a film on a small budget with a star who does not know that he is in the movie. It was written by [[Steve Martin]], who also stars alongside [[Eddie Murphy]] in two roles, and [[Heather Graham]] as an ambitious would-be starlet.\n\n''Bowfinger'' was released in the United States on August 13, 1999, to largely positive reviews, and grossed $98 million. The film is considered by many as one of Eddie Murphy's best and most underappreciated films.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/features/eddie-murphys-movies-2891545 | title=Eddie Murphy's 10 best films...

He has a script (\"''Chubby Rain''\") penned by an accountant, Afrim, and a camera operator, Dave, with access to studio-owned equipment. Bowfinger then lines up several actors who are hungry for work, along with a crowd of [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal Mexican immigrants]] for a camera crew; the only other thing he needs is access to a studio in order to distribute his masterwork.\n\nHe extracts a promise from a high-ranking [[Universal Pictures]] executive, Jerry Renfro, that Universal will distribute the film if it includes currently-hot action star Kit Ramsey. Ramsey\u2014a pompous, [[Neurosis|neurotic]], and [[paranoia|paranoid]] actor\u2014refuses, so Bowfinger constructs a plan to covertly film all of Ramsey's scenes without his knowledge. The actors, told that Ramsey is [[method acting]] and will not be interacting with them outside of their scenes, walk up to Ramsey in public and recite their lines while hidden cameras catch Ramsey's confused reactions.\n\nThe plan goes well at first: Ramsey (who is a member of an organization called MindHead) swallows the movie's [[alien invasion]] premise and believes he is genuinely being stalked by aliens, resulting in an exceptionally genuine and intense performance. However, the strain on his already-precarious mental state leads him to go into hiding in order to maintain his sanity, stalling the film's production.\n\nBowfinger resorts to hiring a Ramsey lookalike named Jiff. Jiff is unassuming, amiable and very naive. For a shot, Bowfinger persuades him to run across a busy freeway by assuring him the many cars racing by are all \"stunt drivers\". During a chat with the other cast members, Jiff reveals that he is Kit's twin brother, explaining the likeness. Using this new knowledge, Bowfinger tasks Jiff with finding out Kit's location and plans so they can ambush him and film the final scene.\n\nOnly one scene remains to be shot: the finale set at the [[Griffith Observatory]]. Though otherwise pleased with Kit's unscripted dialogue, Bowfinger considers his character's final line \"Gotcha, suckas!\" to be the key moment of the film. Bowfinger directs Daisy to guide Kit through the scene under the guise of showing him how to get rid of the \"aliens\". During the filming, Kit becomes terrified and struggles to deliver the final line. At this point, Kit's MindHead mentor, Terry Stricter, who has discovered evidence that Kit's \"aliens\" may not be just in his head, shows up at the observatory and shuts down production.\n\nBowfinger's camera crew show him [[B-roll]] footage of Kit Ramsey they were filming off-set, just in case they caught anything they could use. The footage shows Kit donning a paper bag over his head and [[indecent exposure|exposing himself]] to the [[Laker Girls|Laker Girl Cheerleading Squad]], something Terry Stricter previously dissuaded him from doing. Bowfinger blackmails Stricter and the MindHead leadership with the footage, threatening to release it and ruin Ramsey's career (which would impact MindHead's finances as Ramsey is a major donor). MindHead advises the star to finish the project. Bowfinger and the cast and crew finally get to attend the film's premiere, and are awed. Following the apparent success of the film, Bowfinger receives a [[FedEx]] envelope containing an offer to direct a [[martial arts film]] in [[Taiwan]] starring Jiff Ramsey. The film ends with an elaborate fight scene from the new movie, ''Fake Purse Ninjas'', featuring everyone who worked on ''Chubby Rain''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Bobby Bowfinger\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Kit Ramsey / Jiffrenson \"Jiff\" Ramsey\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Daisy\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Carol\n* [[Terence Stamp]] as Terry Stricter\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Jerry Renfro\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as Dave\n* [[Adam Alexi-Malle]] as Afrim\n* [[Kohl Sudduth]] as Slater\n* [[Barry Newman]] as Hal, Kit's agent\n* [[Alejandro Pati\u00f1o]] as Sanchez\n* Alfred De Contreas as Martinez\n* Ramiro Fabian as Hector\n* [[John Cho]] as Nightclub cleaner\n* [[Phill Lewis]] as Audition actor\n* [[Marisol Nichols]] as Young audition actress\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by [[Brian Grazer]]'s company [[Imagine Entertainment]], in conjunction with [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]].<ref>{{cite news | author =  Staff| title = Universal Names New Head of Production  | work =[[The New York Times]] | date =August 18, 1999  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/18/business/universal-names-new-head-of-production.html  | access-date =2007-12-18  }}</ref> The working title for the film was ''Bowfinger's Big Thing''.<ref>{{cite news | author =  Staff| title =Coming in 1999: The Wild Wild Phantom Menace  | agency=Associated Press  | date =January 6, 1999  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author =  Staff| title =What's on summer's movie screens | work =[[Deseret News]]  | date =May 7, 1999  }}</ref> Martin originally wrote the role of \"Kit Ramsey\" with an actor such as [[Keanu Reeves]] in mind, but Brian Grazer suggested Eddie Murphy instead and Martin approved.<ref>{{cite web |title=BOWFINGER (1999) |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/60915 |website=AFI Catalog }}</ref> The film was initially scheduled for a July 30, 1999 release, but in May 1999, Universal Studios pushed its release back to August 27, 1999.<ref name=\"hindes\">{{cite news | last =Hindes | first =Andrew  |  title =U's 'Bowfinger' pushed to August: Martin- Murphy starrer gets some breathing room  | work =[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  | date =May 26, 1999 | url =https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117502511 | access-date = 2007-12-18 }}</ref> Its final release date was August 13, 1999.<ref name=\"king\" /><ref>{{cite news | last =McNary | first =Dave  | title =Hollywood Sizzles: Box Office Heat Wave Breaking Summer Records  | work =[[Los Angeles Daily News]]  | date =June 24, 1999 }}</ref> The film's costs amounted to [[United States dollar|US$]]44 million.<ref name=\"mcnary\">{{cite news | last =McNary | first =Dave | title =How Big A 'Menace'?
