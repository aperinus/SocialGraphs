The trio thought they all had the same bizarre dream where they witnessed Katana and Bumblebee stealing diamonds. They gave chase, but then they all woke up. Turns out the events didn't only happen in their heads, and the three girls slowly started to understand they lost some time\u2014a whole day. Others remember their missing 24 hours. The girls all acted extremely out of character, doing things like uploading an embarrassing video of Harley Quinn without her permission and replacing the school's Amethyst with Principal Waller's car. Their activities get them expelled. That makes them realize not everything is as it seems and leads them on a chase towards the hidden mastermind behind the plot, Eclipso.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-08-08|title=Lego DC Super Hero Girls: Brain Drain - TV Review|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/lego-dc-super-hero-girls-brain-drain|access-date=2021-06-15|website=www.commonsensemedia.org|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of DC Super Hero Girls characters}}\n*[[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as [[Amanda Waller]]\n*[[Greg Cipes]] as [[Beast Boy]]\n*[[Romi Dames]] as [[Lena Luthor]]\n*[[John DiMaggio]] as [[Gorilla Grodd]] / [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]]\n*[[Teala Dunn]] as [[Bumblebee (DC Comics)|Bumblebee]]\n*Anais Fairweather as [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]\n*[[Grey Griffin]] as [[Wonder Woman]] / [[Lois Lane]]\n*[[Jennifer Hale]] as [[Mad Harriet]]\n*[[Josh Keaton]] as [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]\n*[[Tom Kenny]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]\n*[[Rachael MacFarlane]] as Artemiz\n*[[Mona Marshall]] as [[Eclipso]]\n*[[Meredith Salenger]] as [[Lashina]]\n*[[Ashlyn Selich]] as [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]\n*[[Stephanie Sheh]] as [[Katana (comics)|Katana]]\n*[[Tara Strong]] as [[Harley Quinn]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[DC Super Hero Girls]]\n*[[Lego DC Super Hero Girls]]\n*[[Lego DC Super Hero Girls: Super-Villain High]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|7158814}}\n\n{{DC Comics animated films}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n\n[[Category:2017 direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:2017 animated films]]\n[[Category:DC Super Hero Girls films]]\n[[Category:2017 computer-animated films]]\n[[Category:Films about sentient toys]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video animated films based on DC Comics]]\n[[Category:2010s superhero comedy films]]\n[[Category:2010s American animated films]]\n[[Category:2010s direct-to-video animated superhero films]]\n[[Category:Lego DC Comics films|Brain Drain]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros.
