Zanuck]], and starring [[Tyrone Power]], [[Linda Darnell]], and [[Basil Rathbone]]. The supporting cast features [[Eugene Pallette]], [[Gale Sondergaard]] and [[Robert Lowery (actor)|Robert Lowery]] (the second actor to portray [[Batman]] on film).\n\n''The Mark of Zorro'' was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. The film was named to the [[National Film Registry]] in 2009 by the [[Library of Congress]] for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\", and to be preserved for all time.<ref>{{Cite news | title = 2009 Selections to the National Film Registry Announced | newspaper = News Releases | publisher = The Library of Congress | date = December 30, 2009 | url = https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-250.html | access-date = April 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film is based on the novel ''[[The Curse of Capistrano]]'' by [[Johnston McCulley]], originally published in 1919 in five [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] installments in ''[[All-Story Weekly]]'',<ref>''All-Story Weekly'' vol. 100 #2 (August 9, 1919) \u2013 vol. 101 #2 (September 6, 1919)</ref> which introduced the masked hero [[Zorro]]; the story is set in [[Southern California]] during the early 19th century. After the enormous success of the [[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|silent 1920 film adaptation]], the story was republished under that name by [[Grosset & Dunlap]].\n\n==Plot==\nDon Diego Vega ([[Tyrone Power]]) is urgently called home by his father. To all outward appearances, he is the [[fop]]pish son of wealthy ranchero and former [[Alcalde]] Don Alejandro Vega ([[Montagu Love]]), having returned to [[Alta California]] after his military education in Spain.\n\nDon Diego is horrified at the way the common people are now mistreated by the corrupt Alcalde, Luis Quintero ([[J. Edward Bromberg]]), who had forced his father from the position of Alcalde. Don Diego adopts the guise of El Zorro (\"The Fox\"), a masked outlaw dressed entirely in black, who becomes the defender of the common people and a champion for justice against Quintero and his garrison of soldiers.\n\nIn the meantime he romances the Alcalde's beautiful and innocent niece, Lolita ([[Linda Darnell]]), whom he grows to love. As part of his plan, Don Diego simultaneously flirts with the Alcalde's wife Inez ([[Gale Sondergaard]]), filling her head with tales of [[Madrid]] fashion and culture and raising her desire to move there with her corrupt husband, Luis.\n\nIn both his guises Don Diego must always contend with the governor's ablest henchman, the malevolent and deadly Captain Esteban Pasquale ([[Basil Rathbone]]). He eventually dispatches the Captain during a fast-moving rapier duel-to-the-death, as the Alcalde looks on in astonishment. This action leads to a forced regime change with the help of the people of Los Angeles, the other landowners, and his father. This became Don Diego's long-range plan from the time he arrived back in California and saw just how bad things had become in Los Angeles during his absence.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Mark of Zorro (1940 title lobby card).jpg|right|thumb|350px|{{center|Lobby card}}]]\n* [[Tyrone Power]] as [[Zorro|Don Diego Vega/Zorro]]\n* [[Linda Darnell]] as Lolita Quintero\n* [[Basil Rathbone]] as Captain Esteban Pasquale\n* [[Gale Sondergaard]] as Inez Quintero\n* [[Eugene Pallette]] as Friar Felipe\n* [[J.

It reuses [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]'s original film score, along with new incidental music composed by [[Dominic Frontiere]].\n\nPortions of Newman\u2019s original music score were reused by composer [[Ian Fraser (composer)|Ian Fraser]] for the [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] swashbuckling comedy film ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981). The film's storyline is a tongue-in-cheek sequel to the original 1940 film.\n\n==1920 silent version==\n\n{{box quote|width=30em|bgcolor=cornsilk|fontsize=100%|salign=left|quote= \u201cPower was the most agile man with a sword I\u2019ve ever faced before a camera. Tyrone could have fenced [[Errol Flynn]] into a [[cocked hat]].\u201d \u2013 Basil Rathbone from his 1962 memoir ''In and Out of Character''.<ref>Wiener, 2004</ref>}}\n\n''The Mark of Zorro'' is a sound [[remake]] of the [[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|lavish 1920 smash hit]] [[silent film]] starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]] as Zorro and [[Noah Beery Sr.]] as Sergeant Gonzales. This film depiction includes Don Diego's mother, Isabella, but it omits Bernardo (Don Diego's mute servant). That 1920 [[feature film|feature]] introduced Zorro's iconic all-black costume, subsequently incorporated into [[Johnston McCulley]]'s later Zorro stories in his original fiction series upon which Fairbanks' film had been based. The 1920 film was the first in a popular array of swashbuckler action features starring the acrobatic Fairbanks, who had previously appeared mainly in comedies. Clips from the film were incorporated into ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' nine decades later.\n\nAcknowledging that director Mamoulian\u2019s 1940 version is a \u201ctongue-in-check\u201d remake of the Douglas Fairbanks' 1920 swashbuckler, film critic Todd Wiener observes:\n\n{{blockquote| \u201cCritics inevitably \u2013 and often unfavorably \u2013 compare the film to the earlier successful [silent] version, but Mamoulian\u2019s interpretation of the Zorro myth stands on its own merits. Tyrone Power\u2019s performance is especially spirited, displaying a range and wry sardonic charm not always evident in his other forays into this genre.<ref>Wiener, 2004</ref>}}\n\n==Batman connection==\nIn the [[DC Comics]] continuity it is established that ''The Mark of Zorro'' was the film that the eight-year-old [[Bruce Wayne]] had seen with his parents, [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], at a movie theater, only moments before they were killed in front of his eyes by an armed thug (later [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned to be [[Joe Chill]]). Zorro is often portrayed as Bruce's childhood hero and an influence on his [[Batman]] persona. There are discrepancies regarding which version Bruce saw: ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' claims it was the Tyrone Power version, whereas a story by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] claimed it to be the silent [[Douglas Fairbanks]] original. [[Bill Finger]] was himself inspired by Fairbanks' Zorro, including similarities in costumes, the \"Bat Cave\" and Zorro's cave, and unexpected secret identities, especially since the [[Batman]] character predates the Tyrone Power remake by a year. In ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (set in the [[DC Extended Universe|DCEU]] continuity), Bruce and his parents leave a screening of 1940's ''The Mark of Zorro'' the night of their murder.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ching |first=Albert |date=November 12, 2014 |title='Batman v Superman' Set Pic Sets Stage for Wayne Murders |url=https://www.cbr.com/batman-v-superman-set-pic-sets-stage-for-wayne-murders/ |access-date=October 16, 2022 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', a flashback of the fateful night establishes that for [[DC animated universe|DCAU]] continuity Bruce and his parents were attending ''The Mark of Zorro'' but does not indicate which version. In earlier episodes of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', the fictional character the [[Gray Ghost (DC animated universe)|Gray Ghost]], a pulp fiction hero inspired by [[The Shadow]], is the inspiration to young Bruce Wayne.\n\nIn [[Todd Phillips]]' 2019 film ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'', the Marquee above the theater young Bruce and his parents exit shows the 1981 films ''[[Blow Out]]'' and ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade|Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'' as playing.\n\n==Home media==\n''The Mark of Zorro'' has been released twice on DVD. The first was on October 7, 2003, and featured the film in its original black-and-white, as part of 20th Century Fox Studio Classics Collection. The second was released on October 18, 2005, as a [[Special Edition]], featuring both a newly restored black-and-white version and a [[Film colorization|colorized]] version, prepared by [[Legend Films]]. Both contain the short film \"Tyrone Power: The Last Idol\" as seen on ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' on the [[A&E Network]], with a commentary by film critic [[Richard Schickel]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Todd Weiner. 2004.''
