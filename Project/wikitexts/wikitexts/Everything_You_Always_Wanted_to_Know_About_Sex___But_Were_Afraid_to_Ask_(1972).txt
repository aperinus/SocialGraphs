It consists of a series of [[Sketch comedy|short sequences]] loosely inspired by [[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben]]'s 1969 [[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|book of the same name]].\n\nThe film was an early success for Woody Allen, grossing over $18 million in North America alone against a $2 million budget, making it the [[1972 in film|10th highest-grossing film of 1972]].\n\n==Film structure==\nThe credits at the start and close of the film are played over a backdrop of a large mass of white rabbits, to the tune of \"[[Let's Misbehave]]\" by [[Cole Porter]].\n\nThe film consists of seven vignettes, as follows:\n# ''Do Aphrodisiacs Work?''<br/>A court jester gives a [[Potion|love potion]] to the Queen but is foiled by her [[chastity belt]]. There are references to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' throughout.\n# ''What Is Sodomy?''<br/>Dr. Ross falls in love with the partner of an Armenian patient, a sheep.\n# ''Why Do Some Women Have Trouble Reaching an Orgasm?''<br/>Allen's homage to Italian film-making in general and ''[[Casanova 70]]'', [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], and [[Federico Fellini]] in particular, about Gina, a woman who can only reach orgasm in public.\n# ''Are Transvestites Homosexuals?''<br/>Sam Musgrave, a middle-aged married man, experiments with women's clothes.\n# ''What Are Sex Perverts?''<br>A parody of the television [[game show]] ''[[What's My Line?]]'' called ''What's My Perversion?'', filmed in [[Black-and-white|B&W]] [[kinescope]]-style and hosted by [[Jack Barry (game show host)|Jack Barry]].  The four panelists who attempt to guess the contestant's perversion are [[Regis Philbin]], [[Robert Q. Lewis]], [[Pamela Mason]], and Toni Holt.  After they fail to guess that the contestant's perversion is \"Likes to expose himself on subways,\" a second segment of the show is presented, in which a selected viewer (in this case a rabbi) gets to act out his [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and [[humiliation (BDSM)|humiliation]] fantasy while his wife [[Kosher foods#Permitted and forbidden animals|eats pork]].\n# ''Are the Findings of Doctors and Clinics Who Do Sexual Research and Experiments Accurate?''<br/>Victor, a sex researcher, and Helen Lacey, a journalist, visit a Dr. Bernardo, a researcher who formerly worked with [[Masters and Johnson]] but now has his own laboratory complete with a lab assistant named [[Igor (character)|Igor]].  After they see a series of bizarre sexual experiments underway at the lab and realize that Bernardo is [[mad scientist|insane]], they escape before Helen becomes the subject of another of his experiments.  The segment culminates with a scene in which the countryside is terrorized by a giant runaway breast created by the researcher.  The first part of this segment is a parody of [[Ed Wood]]'s '''[[Bride of the Monster]]''' (1955), and especially, '''[[The Unearthly]]''' (1957), which also stars John Carradine. The second part parodies many of the \"Giant\" monster movies of the nineteen fifties.\n# ''What Happens During Ejaculation?''<br/>The [[NASA]]-like mission control center in a man's brain is seen, as he gets involved in a sexual clinch with an [[New York University|NYU]] graduate (knowledge that she is a graduate of NYU assures coital success). As he achieves orgasm, the soldier-like, white-uniformed sperm are dispatched [[paratrooper]]-style into the great unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Victor / Fabrizio / The Fool / Sperm\n* [[John Carradine]] as Dr. Bernardo\n* [[Lou Jacobi]] as Sam Musgrave\n* [[Louise Lasser]] as Gina\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as The King\n* [[Tony Randall]] as The Operator\n* [[Lynn Redgrave]] as The Queen\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Sperm Switchboard Chief\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Dr. Ross\n* [[Jack Barry (game show host)|Jack Barry]] as Himself\n* [[Elaine Giftos]] as Mrs. Ross\n* Toni Holt as Herself\n* [[Robert Q.
