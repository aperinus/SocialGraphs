It is the first film in the series not to be directed by [[Gore Verbinski]], replaced by [[Rob Marshall]]. [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] again served as producer. In the film, which draws its plot loosely from the 1987 novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'' by [[Tim Powers]], the eccentric pirate  [[Captain Jack Sparrow]] ([[Johnny Depp]]) is forced into a shaky alliance with [[Angelica (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Angelica]] ([[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]]), a mysterious woman from his past, as they embark on a quest for the [[Fountain of Youth]], confronting the infamous pirate [[Blackbeard (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Blackbeard]] ([[Ian McShane]]) and outrunning Jack's old foe [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]] ([[Geoffrey Rush]]).\n\n''On Stranger Tides'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer Films]], and released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]. It was the first film in the series to be released in the [[Disney Digital 3-D]] and [[IMAX 3D]] formats. Writers [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] first learned of Powers' novel during the back-to-back production of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' (2006) and ''At World's End'', and considered it a good starting point for a new film in the series. Pre-production started after the end of the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]], with Depp collaborating with the writers on the story design. [[Principal photography]] lasted for 106 days between June and November 2010, with locations in Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and California. Filming employed [[3D film|3D]] cameras similar to those used in the production of the 2009 film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', and ten companies were involved with the film's [[visual effects]]. Following inflated production costs which ballooned the net budget to $379 million, the film currently ranks as the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]].\n\n''On Stranger Tides'' was released in the United States on May 20, 2011. It received mixed reviews from critics for its screenplay and lack of originality, but received praise for its performances, visual effects, and action scenes. The film broke many box office records and was the [[2011 in film#Highest-grossing films|third highest-grossing film of 2011]]. A fifth film, titled ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|Dead Men Tell No Tales]]'', was released in May 2017, and a sixth film is in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Word count: 947 as of 1 Nov 2020 --><!-- Per WP: FILM PLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --> \nIn mid-[[18th century]], a man is rescued from the ocean off the Spanish coast and brought to [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|King Ferdinand of Spain]], where he claims to be a crewmate of [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]], who disappeared 200 years ago searching for the [[Fountain of Youth]]. Seventeen years after the battle of [[Tia Dalma|Calypso]]'s maelstrom,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' (2007).}} after a failed attempt to rescue his first mate, [[Joshamee Gibbs]], from execution in London, [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] is brought before [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. The king asks Jack to guide an expedition to locate the Fountain of Youth, before King Ferdinand and the [[Spanish Navy]] locate it. Captain [[Hector Barbossa]], now a [[privateer]], and sporting a [[peg leg]], is captaining the expedition, though only requires [[Sao Feng]]\u2019s navigational charts, rather than Jack's.\n \nJack escapes, meeting his father, [[Captain Teague]], who tells Jack that the Fountain requires a ritual to use. Jack learns an impersonator is recruiting pirates for another expedition. The imposter is [[Angelica (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Angelica]], Jack's former lover, and daughter of the legendary [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Blackbeard|Blackbeard]]. Jack is shanghaied into service on board Blackbeard's ship, the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''. Blackbeard survived his historic death using [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] magic, due to a predestined, fatal encounter with Barbossa. He wields the Sword of Triton, which allows him to control his ship. Though Jack leads a [[mutiny]], Blackbeard subdues the crew into obedience. Amongst the crew is [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Philip Swift|Philip Swift]], a captured [[missionary]].\n \nBarbossa recruits Gibbs, who burns the charts, admitting he memorized every location. Jack is told by Angelica that two silver [[chalice]]s must be retrieved from Ponce de Le\u00f3n's flagship, the ''Santiago''. A [[mermaid]]\u2019s tear must be placed in one chalice, and both chalices must be drunk simultaneously to activate the Fountain's healing properties. The drinker who lacks the tear will die, their lifeforce is given to the other. Jack discovers Blackbeard's collection of captured, miniaturized ships, including the ''[[Black Pearl]]''.\n \nThe ''Revenge'' sails to Whitecap Bay to capture a mermaid, successfully netting [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Syrena|Syrena]], who they, at first, must carry in a glass container. When Syrena is dropped, her tail turns into legs. Philip, caring for her, (and seeing she cannot walk) offers to carry her. After reaching Whitecap Bay, Barbossa, Gibbs, and a few British sailors are forced to continue in rowboats after their ship and its crew is attacked by the mermaids.\n\nAngelica and Blackbeard send Jack to get the chalices, taking his magic compass as a bargaining chip. Jack meets Barbossa on the ''Santiago'' but finds the chalices have been taken by the Spanish. Retrieving the chalices, Barbossa explains Blackbeard attacked the ''Black Pearl'', leading to the loss of his leg via self-amputation. Syrena's tear is extracted by Blackbeard after Philip expresses love for her, leaving her to die of dehydration, and Philip is forced to go with the crew.\n \nJack returns, bargaining for the return of his compass in exchange for the chalices. When Blackbeard agrees, Jack sends Gibbs off on an errand. Blackbeard's crew locates the Fountain but is confronted by Barbossa and his men. The Spanish arrive, condemning the Fountain as an abomination against God, throwing the chalices into a deep pool. In the chaos, Philip frees Syrena, who retrieves the chalices, returning them to Jack. Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with his poisoned sword, steals the Sword of Triton, declares himself captain of the ''Revenge'', and returns to a life of piracy. The Spanish crush the Fountain before leaving deeming it to be too powerful for anyone to have.\n \nAngelica cuts her hand on the poisoned sword. Jack retrieves the remaining drops of water from the Fountain, adding Syrena's tear to one of the chalices. When Blackbeard asks Angelica to die for him, Jack tricks him into drinking the chalice lacking the tear. Angelica is healed, whilst Blackbeard dies. Syrena returns to an injured Philip, kisses him, and guides him underwater to an unknown fate.\n<!-- DO NOT ADD SPECULATION CONCERNING SYRENA'S REASONING FOR TAKING PHILIP UNDERWATER (SUCH AS TO SAVE HIM OR EAT HIM). THE REASON IS NEVER EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE FILM.--> \nJack maroons Angelica on a cay, unsure if he can trust her. Afterward, he reunites with Gibbs, who used Jack's compass to locate the ''Revenge'', retrieving the bottled ''Black Pearl''. In a [[post-credits scene]], a [[voodoo doll]] of Jack created by Blackbeard washes ashore onto Angelica's cay.\n<!-- PER WP: DO NOT ADD SPECULATION CONCERNING ANGELICA'S INTENTIONS TO USE THE VOODOO DOLL, AS WE DON'T KNOW IF IT STILL WORKS OR NOT.-->\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Pirates of the Caribbean cast members|List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters|l2=characters}}\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]]: Former captain of the ''[[Black Pearl]]''.\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as [[Angelica (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Angelica]]: Jack's former love interest, and daughter of Blackbeard.\n* [[Ian McShane]] as [[Blackbeard (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Blackbeard]]: Legendary pirate, and captain of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''.

was not much interested in 3D, but the director eventually considered it a film that could benefit from the format. \"You are on an adventure and with the 3D experience you are inside that

In February 2010, ''Sunset'' was sailed from Long Beach to a shipyard in Hawaii for the reforms, where a big concern was to make it imposing, with three stories, without sacrificing actual [[seakeeping]]. Given Blackbeard was meant to be the meanest pirate to appear in the series, the look for ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' was ominous, with sails dyed blood red, various elements on fire, and a decoration based on skulls and bones (drawing inspiration from the [[Sedlec Ossuary]] in Czech Republic).
