Starring [[Anne Hathaway]] and [[Hugh Dancy]], the film plays with the usual [[fairy tale]] genre.\n\nThe film is a [[International co-production|co-production]] between companies in [[Cinema of the United States|the United States]], [[Cinema of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the kingdom of Lamia, misguided [[fairy godmother]] Lucinda Perriweather bestows the \u201cgift\u201d of obedience on newborn Ella of Frell, causing her to instantly obey any command she is given. Some years later, on her deathbed, Ella's mother warns her daughter not to tell anyone about the gift, for fear that someone might use it to exploit Ella.\n\nYears later, Ella's father Sir Peter marries wealthy socialite, Dame Olga, who dislikes Ella and treats her poorly. Ella meets Prince \"Char\" Charmont, who invites her to his [[coronation]] ball. Jealous, Olga\u2019s daughters Hattie and Olive find out about Ella\u2019s obedience and use it to humiliate her. Ella resolves to find Lucinda to undo her gift. Mandy, the household fairy, lends Ella her boyfriend, Benny, whom she accidentally transformed into a magic book. Ella learns that Lucinda is in Giantville and leaves to find her.\n\nOn her journey, Ella rescues Slannen, an elf who wants to be a lawyer rather than be forced to be an entertainer. They are captured by [[ogre]]s but are rescued by Char. He joins them, intending to avenge the death of his father, and Ella opens his eyes to the cruelty of the laws [[Anthropocentrism#In fiction|oppressing elves and giants]] enacted by Char\u2019s paternal uncle, the [[Regent]] Sir Edgar.\n\nElla and Char begin to fall in love. Edgar learns of Ella's gift from her stepsisters. Knowing his nephew is in love with her, Edgar orders Ella to murder Char at midnight and to keep this plan secret. Edgar reveals that he murdered Char's father, and the prince\u2019s death will make Edgar king. Ella writes Char a letter, saying she must leave but cannot explain why. She has Slannen chain her to a tree, hoping to wait out Edgar's command, while Slannen recruits more elves and giants to protect Char.\n\nLucinda appears and Ella begs her to take back her gift. Offended, Lucinda insists that Ella remove the gift herself and unchains her. Forced back to the castle, Ella stumbles into the ball. Char whisks her away to a secret hall of mirrors, where he proposes. As Ella is about to stab Char, she sees her reflection and commands herself to no longer be obedient, permanently freeing herself from the gift. Char notices the dagger, and Edgar has Ella arrested before she can explain herself.\n\nBenny reveals Ella is in the dungeon, and Slannen sneaks into the castle along with a band of elves, giants, and ogres, and frees her. Benny shows that Edgar has poisoned Char's crown, intending to kill him at the coronation. Ella and the others crash the ceremony and a brawl ensues. In the scuffle, Mandy manages to turn Benny human again. As Char and Ella fight off the guards, she confesses her love for him and reveals Edgar's plot. Edgar's talking snake, Heston, almost [[snakebite|fatally bites]] Char, which Char takes as evidence of his uncle's guilt. Edgar attempts to proclaim himself king, but foolishly puts on the poisoned crown and collapses.\n\nSoon after, Char and Ella are married, with Areida as Ella's maid of honor. Char toasts to a new era of equality among all citizens of the kingdom. Edgar is revealed to still be alive, but disabled. The cast performs a final dance number of \"[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]\" before the newlyweds ride off on their honeymoon.<ref>{{Citation |title=Ella Enchanted (2004) - IMDb |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327679/ |language=en-US |access-date=2022-03-14}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Ella of Frell, a girl given the \"gift\" (or  curse) of obedience by the fairy Lucinda, which magically compels her to literally obey every command she is given, even if it is against her wishes.\n**Aimee Brigg as young Ella\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as Prince \"Char\" Charmont, son of the late king and heir to the throne.
