The film stars [[Adam Hann-Byrd]] as Fred Tate, a seven-year-old [[child prodigy]] who struggles to [[self-actualization|self-actualize]] in [[Social constructionism|social]] and psychological settings that largely fail to accommodate his [[intelligence]]. It also stars Foster,  [[Dianne Wiest]],  [[Harry Connick Jr.]],  [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Debi Mazar]] and [[P.J. Ochlan]].\n\n''Little Man Tate'' was released theatrically on October 18, 1991 by [[Orion Pictures]] to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Foster's direction, Frank's screenplay and the  performances of the cast. The film grossed $25 million domestically, on a  $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nDede Tate is a young working-class woman of average intelligence raising her seven-year-old son, Fred. Fred shows every indication of being a [[genius]]. Fred's reading and [[mathematics]] abilities are remarkable, and he plays the [[piano]] \"at competition level,\"  but his intellect has isolated him from his public school classmates.\n\nFred's abilities come to the attention of Jane Grierson, a former [[music prodigy]] and now a [[psychologist]] running a school for gifted children. She asks permission from Dede to admit Fred to the school, in order to develop his intellectual gifts in ways that a public school cannot. Dede is reluctant, preferring that Fred have a more normal upbringing, but when no friends come to Fred's seventh birthday party, Dede consents.\n\nFred joins other brilliant young people, and participates in Jane's  [[Odyssey of the Mind]] event for part of the spring. There he meets one of his heroes, who is one of Jane's prized pupils, the brilliant but slightly bizarre \"Mathemagician\" Damon Wells, a whiz at math who wears a black cape wherever he goes. After Fred unintentionally upstages Damon at one of the competitions at Odyssey of the Mind, Damon is upset with Fred. Damon however warms up to Fred when out horseback riding on Jane's ranch, and is Fred's first insight to a world outside academia. Damon tells him, \"it's not the size of a man's IQ that matters; it's how he uses it\". Jane attempts to become more nurturing, but is unable to relate to Fred as anything other than a case study.\n\nFred is later enrolled at a university, where he studies [[quantum physics]] while his mother, aunt and cousins travel to Florida for the summer. An adult student named Eddie accidentally hits Fred with a globe when goofing around. To make it up to Fred, Eddie takes him out for a ride on his moped and shows him things such as how to shoot pool; it is good for Fred to spend time with someone who is not a genius. However, when Fred walks into Eddie's room while Eddie is in bed with a coed, Fred runs out and Eddie chases after him. Eddie explains that he cannot be a babysitter for Fred; although he enjoys Fred's company, Fred needs to find friends closer to his own age. The return to isolation takes its toll on Fred, as he suffers from nightmares in which he is treated as a freak and an outsider.\n\nJane is asked to bring Fred onto a TV panel discussion show on the topic of gifted children. Fred attends but breaks down. He claims his mother is dead, and recites a childish poem (a word-for-word repetition of a poem by one of his former grade school classmates) before taking off his microphone and walking out of the studio.  Dede witnesses some of this as it is being broadcast, and flies back to New York.  Jane is unable to find Fred, but Dede discovers him back at their apartment, and embraces him.\n\nOne year later, Fred has adjusted to the pressures of being a child genius, particularly after an even younger student is admitted to Jane's school.  Dede hosts a well-attended birthday party for Fred, reconciling Fred's emotional development with his intellect.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Hann-Byrd]] as Fred Tate\n**Alex Lee as Fred Tate Age 2\n**Geoffrey C.

[[Orion Pictures]] was on the verge of [[bankruptcy]] at the time and was skeptical about Foster directing the film. They ultimately agreed after she offered to act in the film without payment. The film includes certain autobiographical elements from Foster's life.\n\nMost of the film was shot in [[Over-the-Rhine]] and [[downtown Cincinnati]].  Other locations include the [[Clifton, Cincinnati|Cincinnati neighborhood of Clifton]]; the Village of [[Indian Hill, Ohio|Indian Hill]]; the [[University of Cincinnati]]'s McMicken Hall; [[Miami University]]'s [[Alumni Hall (Miami University)|Alumni Hall]], [[Upham Hall (Miami University)|Upham Hall]], [[Hall Auditorium]] and the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] Fraternity House, in [[Oxford, Ohio]]; and both the [[Wexner Center]] and the [[Ohio Theatre (Columbus, Ohio)|Ohio Theater]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn its opening weekend in [[North America]], ''Little Man Tate'' was #6 at the box office, grossing $2.3 million.
