Almost immediately thereafter, Jeffrey meets Steve ([[Michael T. Weiss]]), a hunky, charming [[HIV]] positive man. He experiences an emotional conflict as he must face his fear in order to accept love, often breaking the [[fourth wall]] to do so. With the help of friends, interior decorator Sterling ([[Patrick Stewart]]) and his partner Darius ([[Bryan Batt]]), as well as a cast of cameos \u2013 including [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]] \u2013 he is able to overcome his fears and begin a relationship with Steve.<ref name=\"alexander2014\">{{cite web|first=Ryll |last=Alexander |year=2014|title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, ''Jeffrey'' |publisher=Gay Essential |accessdate=December 22, 2014 |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/films-to-watch-jeffrey/}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steven Weber]] as Jeffrey\n* [[Michael T.
