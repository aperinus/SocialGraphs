The film was mostly filmed in [[Malaysia]], and, though a work of fiction,  was inspired by real people and real events.\n\nBowman joins, albeit initially unintentionally, political rallies with university students protesting for [[democracy]], and travels with the student leader U Aung Ko throughout Burma. There, they see the brutality of the military dictatorship of the [[Burmese Way to Socialism|Ne Win Regime]] and attempt to escape to [[Thailand]].\n\nThe film was an official selection at the [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe film may have had an impact beyond movie screens, however. Only weeks into its European run, the Burmese military junta freed Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] (depicted in the film) after several years under strict house arrest.<ref name=\"James\">James, Caryn (25 August 1995) [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/25/movies/film-review-sad-tourist-trapped-in-burma.html \"Film Review: Sad Tourist Trapped In Burma\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306071302/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/25/movies/film-review-sad-tourist-trapped-in-burma.html |date=March 6, 2016 }} ''The New York Times''</ref> The celebrated democracy leader thanked the filmmakers in her first interview with the [[BBC]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Suu Kyi was re-arrested a few years later, but ''Beyond Rangoon'' had already helped raise world attention on a previously \"invisible\" tragedy: the massacres of 1988 and the cruelty of her country's military rulers.<ref>Bailie, Stuart (15 November 2010) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/stuartbailie/2010/11/the_rangoon_show.shtml \"The Rangoon Show\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220225043443/https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/stuartbailie/2010/11/the_rangoon_show.shtml |date=February 25, 2022 }} ''BBC News''</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAndy Bowman persuades her sister Laura to go on a trip to [[Burma]] after Laura's husband and son were murdered during a home invasion and Laura had gone into a deep depression. One night, unable to sleep because of nightmares, Laura leaves her hotel in [[Rangoon]] and gets caught up in an anti-government protest. She is very impressed by the bravery of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].\n\nWhen her tour group leaves the country, Laura cannot leave with them as her passport was stolen the previous night. While staying behind waiting for her new passport,  she meets U Aung Ko, who acts as an unofficial tour guide and drives an ancient [[Chevrolet|Chevy]]. He takes Laura out into the countryside to a Buddhist monastery. The car develops problems, but fortunately they are able to coast to the house of some of Ko's friends and former students. Laura learns that Ko used to be a college professor, who was banned from teaching because of his support for the anti-government activities led by his former student Min Han. She has a breakdown and tells Ko what happened to her family.\n\nThe next morning, they learn that the 8888 Uprising began the previous day. Ko takes Laura to a station to get a train back to Rangoon. She sneaks on board, but the soldiers start beating Ko, and when Min Han intervenes, Han is shot and killed. Laura gets Ko  into the car and they leave, pursued by the soldiers, but Ko is shot and wounded. They end up crashing into the [[Irrawaddy River]], but manage to get away from the soldiers. They get on a raft taking bamboo to Rangoon. Laura, who is a doctor, operates on Ko to remove the bullet.\n\nThe next day, the raft stops at a village. Laura goes to find drugs to treat Ko. She reluctantly accepts a pistol from one of the crew. At a clinic, Laura finds the drugs she needs, but has to shoot a soldier to keep from being raped. When they arrive in Rangoon, the city is in the throes of a full-scale revolt. When Laura attempts to get into the US embassy, the military tries to arrest her for helping Ko, but the student demonstrators rescue them. After they witness soldiers killing civilians, they get put on a truck heading for the border. Near the border, the group has to abandon their truck and make a run through the jungle. There they meet up with a group of [[Karen people|Karen]] rebels. Laura has a dream where her son Danny tells her she has to let him go. Ko urges Laura to do so, telling her, \"All things pass, Laura. They are shadows as we are shadows. Briefly walking the earth, and soon gone.\"\n\nThe next day, Laura and her group of refugees make a harrowing river crossing into [[Thailand]] under mortar fire and reach a refugee camp. Having found a new purpose in life, Laura begins helping at the camp's hospital.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Laura Bowman\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Andy Bowman\n* U Aung Ko as U Aung Ko\n* [[Johnny Cheah]] as Min Han\n* [[Adelle Lutz]] as [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]\n* [[Spalding Gray]] as Jeremy Watt\n* [[Tiara Jacquelina]] as San San, Hotel Desk Clerk\n* Kuswadinata as Colonel at Hotel\n* [[Victor Slezak]] as Mr. Scott\n* [[Jit Murad]] as Sein Htoo\n* Ye Myint as Zaw Win\n* Cho Cho Myint as Zabai\n* M.
