The screenplay by [[Horton Foote]] is based on [[Harper Lee]]'s [[1960 in literature|1960]] [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning [[To Kill a Mockingbird|novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Gregory Peck]] as [[Atticus Finch]] and [[Mary Badham]] as Scout. It marked the film debut of [[Robert Duvall]], [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]] and [[Alice Ghostley]].\n\nIt gained overwhelmingly positive reception from both the critics and the public; a box-office success, it earned more than six times its budget. The film won three [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Peck, and was nominated for eight, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\nIn 1995, the film was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2003, the [[American Film Institute]] named Atticus Finch the greatest movie hero of the 20th century. In 2007, the film ranked twenty-fifth on the AFI's [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10th anniversary]] list of the greatest American movies of all time. In 2020, the British Film Institute included it in their list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 15.<ref>{{Cite web |last=BFI Education |date=7 May 2020 |title=50 films to see by age 15 |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/lists/50-films-see-age-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220315204858/https://www.bfi.org.uk/lists/50-films-see-age-15 |archive-date=15 March 2022 |access-date=25 April 2022 |website=bfi.org.uk}}</ref> The film was restored and released on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[DVD-Video|DVD]] in 2012, as part of the 100th anniversary of [[Universal Pictures]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Universal Celebrates 100th Birthday With New Logo and 13 Film Restorations|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/universal-100th-birthday-logo-279955|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Tim|last=Appelo|date=2012-01-10|access-date=2012-12-10|archive-date=November 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102181858/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/universal-100th-birthday-logo-279955|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is narrated by the adult Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch. Young Scout and her pre-teen older brother Jem live in the fictional town of Maycomb, [[Alabama]], during the early 1930s. Despite the family's modest means, the children enjoy a happy childhood, cared for by their widowed father, [[Atticus Finch]], and the family's black housekeeper, Calpurnia. During the summer, Jem, Scout, and their friend Dill play games and often search for Arthur \"Boo\" Radley, an odd, reclusive neighbor who lives with his brother Nathan. The children have never seen Boo, who rarely leaves the house. On different occasions, Jem has found small objects left inside a tree knothole on the Radley property. These include a broken pocket watch, an old [[spelling bee]] medal, a pocket knife, and two carved soap dolls resembling Jem and Scout.\n\nAtticus, a lawyer, strongly believes all people deserve fair treatment, in turning the other cheek, and in defending what you believe. Many of Atticus' clients are poor farmers who pay for his legal services in trade, often leaving him fresh produce, firewood, and so on.<ref>{{cite web |author=Harper Lee |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/section2.rhtml |title=To Kill a Mockingbird: Chapters 2\u20133 |publisher=SparkNotes |access-date=2014-03-17 |archive-date=July 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729020206/http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/section2.rhtml |url-status=live }}</ref> Atticus' work as a lawyer often exposes Scout and Jem to the town's [[racism]], aggravated by poverty. As a result, the children mature more quickly.\n\nAtticus is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell. Atticus accepts the case, heightening tension in the town and causing Jem and Scout to experience schoolyard taunts. One evening before the trial, as Atticus sits in front of the local jail to safeguard Robinson, a lynch mob arrives. Scout, Jem, and Dill unexpectedly interrupt the confrontation. Scout, unaware of the mob's purpose, recognizes Mr. Cunningham and asks him to say hello to his son Walter, her classmate. Cunningham becomes embarrassed, and the mob disperses.\n\nAt the trial, it is alleged that Tom entered the Ewell property at Mayella's request to chop up a [[chifforobe]] and that Mayella showed signs of having been beaten around that time. One of Atticus' defensive arguments is that Tom's left arm is disabled due to a farming accident years ago, yet the supposed rapist would have had to mostly assault Mayella with his left hand before raping her. Atticus noted that Mayella's father, Bob Ewell, is left-handed, implying that he beat Mayella because he caught her seducing a young black man (Robinson). Atticus also states that Mayella was never examined by a doctor after the supposed assault. Taking the stand, Tom denies he attacked Mayella but states that she kissed him against his will. He testifies that he had previously assisted Mayella with various chores at her request because he \"felt sorry for her\" \u2013 words that incite a swift, negative reaction from the prosecutor.\n\nIn his closing argument, Atticus asks the all-white male jury to cast aside their prejudices and focus on Tom's obvious innocence. However, Tom is found guilty. As Atticus exits the courtroom, the black spectators in the balcony rise to show their respect and appreciation.\n\nWhen Atticus arrives home, Sheriff Tate informs him that Tom was killed during his transfer to prison, apparently while attempting to escape. Atticus, accompanied by Jem, goes to the Robinson home to relay news of Tom's death. Bob Ewell appears and spits in Atticus' face.\n\nAutumn arrives, and Scout and Jem attend an evening school pageant in which Scout portrays a ham. After the pageant, Scout is unable to find her dress and shoes, forcing her to walk home with Jem while wearing the large, hard-shelled costume. While cutting through the woods, Scout and Jem are attacked. Scout's cumbersome costume protects her but restricts her vision. The attacker knocks Jem unconscious but is himself attacked (and killed) by a second man unseen by Scout. Scout escapes her costume and sees the second man carrying Jem towards their house. Scout follows them and runs into the arms of a frantic Atticus. Still unconscious, Jem has his broken arm treated by Doc Reynolds.\n\nScout tells Sheriff Tate and her father what happened, then notices a strange man behind Jem's bedroom door. Atticus introduces Scout to Arthur Radley, whom she knows as Boo. It was Boo who rescued Jem and Scout, overpowering Bob Ewell and carrying Jem home. The sheriff reports that Ewell, apparently seeking revenge for Atticus humiliating him in court, is dead at the scene of the attack. Atticus mistakenly assumes Jem killed Ewell in self-defense, but Sheriff Tate realizes the truth \u2013 Boo killed Ewell defending the children. His official report will state that Ewell died falling on his knife. He refuses to drag the painfully shy, introverted Boo into the spotlight for his heroism, insisting it would be a sin. As Scout escorts Boo home, she draws a startlingly precocious analogy: comparing the unwelcome public attention that would have been heaped on Boo, with the killing of a mockingbird that does nothing but sing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of To Kill a Mockingbird characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as [[Atticus Finch]]\n* [[Mary Badham]] as Scout\n* [[Phillip Alford]] as Jem\n* [[John Megna]] as Charles Baker \"Dill\" Harris\n* [[Frank Overton]] as Sheriff Heck Tate\n* [[Rosemary Murphy]] as Miss Maudie Atkinson\n* [[Ruth White (actress)|Ruth White]] as Mrs. Dubose\n* [[Brock Peters]] as Tom Robinson\n* [[Estelle Evans]] as Calpurnia\n* [[Paul Fix]] as Judge John Taylor\n* [[Collin Wilcox (actress)|Collin Wilcox]] as Mayella Violet Ewell\n* [[James Anderson (American actor)|James Anderson]] as Robert E.

Harper Lee used her experiences as a child in Monroeville as the basis for the fictional town of Maycomb, so it seemed that would be the best place.

Their charming enactments of a father and his children in that close relationship, which can occur at only one brief period, are worth all the footage of the film. [[Rosemary Murphy]] as a neighbor, [[Brock Peters]] as the Negro on trial, and [[Frank Overton]] as a troubled sheriff are good as locality characters, too. [[James Anderson (American actor)|James Anderson]] and [[Collin Wilcox (actress)|Collin Wilcox]] as Southern bigots are almost caricatures. But those are minor shortcomings in a rewarding film.</blockquote>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' criticized the film for focusing less on black people, criticizing the film for having a [[White savior narrative in film|white savior narrative]]:<ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/to-kill-a-mockingbird-2001 |title=To Kill a Mockingbird |access-date=13 July 2014 |archive-date=July 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708192343/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/to-kill-a-mockingbird-2001 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It expresses the liberal pieties of a more innocent time, the early 1960s, and it goes very easy on the realities of small-town Alabama in the 1930s. One of the most dramatic scenes shows a lynch mob facing Atticus, who is all by himself on the jailhouse steps the night before Tom Robinson's trial. The mob is armed and prepared to break in and hang Robinson, but Scout bursts onto the scene, recognizes a poor farmer who has been befriended by her father, and shames him (and all the other men) into leaving. Her speech is a calculated strategic exercise, masked as the innocent words of a child; one shot of her eyes shows she realizes exactly what she's doing. Could a child turn away a lynch mob at that time, in that place? Isn't it nice to think so.</blockquote>\n\n[[Walt Disney]] requested that the film be privately screened in his house. At the film's conclusion, Disney sadly stated, \"That was one hell of a picture. That's the kind of film I wish I could make.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Gabler |first=Neal |author-link=Neal Gabler |year=2006 |title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of American Imagination |page=587 |publisher=[[Alfred A.
