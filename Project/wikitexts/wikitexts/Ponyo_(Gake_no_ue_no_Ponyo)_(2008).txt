The film stars Yuria Nara, Hiroki Doi, [[Tomoko Yamaguchi]], [[Kazushige Nagashima]], [[Y\u016bki Amami]], [[George Tokoro]], [[Rumi Hiiragi]], [[Akiko Yano]], [[Kazuko Yoshiyuki]] and [[Tomoko Naraoka]]. It is the eighth film Miyazaki directed for Studio Ghibli, and his tenth overall. The film tells the story of Ponyo, a [[goldfish]] who escapes from the ocean and is rescued by a five-year-old human boy, S\u014dsuke after she is washed ashore while trapped in a glass jar. As they bond with each other, the story deals with resolving Ponyo's desire to become a human girl, against the devastating circumstances brought about by her acquisition and use of magic.\n\nThe film was originally released in Japan on July 19, 2008 by distributor Toho. It was a major commercial success, grossing over $204 million worldwide and becoming the [[List of highest-grossing anime films|fifth-highest-grossing anime film of all time]]. It received critical acclaim for its uplifting themes, visual design, and simultaneous appeal towards young children and all audiences.\n\nAn English-language version of the film was released on August 14, 2009, releasing to 927 theatres across the U.S., the widest opening for a Studio Ghibli film across the U.S. It was produced by [[The Kennedy/Marshall Company]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nFujimoto, a once-human [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]], lives underwater with his daughter [[Brunhild]]e and her numerous smaller sisters. While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered [[submarine]], Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a [[jellyfish]]. After an encounter with a [[fishing trawler]], she becomes trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing town where she is rescued by five-year-old boy S\u014dsuke. While shattering the jar with a rock, S\u014dsuke cuts his finger. Brunhilde licks his blood, healing the wound almost instantly. S\u014dsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving S\u014dsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened.\n\nPonyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth name, declaring her desire to be a human named Ponyo. With magic, she forces herself to grow leg- and arm-like appendages and start changing into a human, a power granted to her by S\u014dsuke's human blood that she licked. Fujimoto forces her to change back into her true form and leaves to summon Ponyo's mother, Gran Mamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and inadvertently uses his magic to make herself human. The huge amount of magic that she releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in nature, resulting in a [[tsunami]]. Ponyo goes back to S\u014dsuke, who is amazed and overjoyed to see her. His mother, Lisa, allows her to stay at their house. Lisa leaves after the tsunami subsides to check up on the residents of the nursing home where she works, promising S\u014dsuke that she will return home as soon as possible.\n\nGran Mamare arrives at Fujimoto's submarine. S\u014dsuke's father, K\u014dichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the [[Guanyin|Goddess of Mercy]]. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and [[satellite]]s are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Gran Mamare declares that if S\u014dsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and that the [[balance of nature]] will be restored. Fujimoto, still worried, reminds her that if S\u014dsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.\n\nThe next day, S\u014dsuke and Ponyo find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two decide to find her. With Ponyo's magic, they make S\u014dsuke's [[pop pop boat]] bigger to traverse the waters, seeing marine life from the Late [[Devonian]] period and more people on boats. When they reach the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep, and the boat slowly reverts back to its original size. S\u014dsuke drags Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa's abandoned car. As they continue walking, Ponyo mysteriously reverts to her fish form. Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home are temporarily able to breathe water because of Gran Mamare. Ponyo and S\u014dsuke encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy on the imbalance of nature, begs him to give him back Ponyo. Despite their attempt to flee, they are captured and Fujimoto takes them down to the protected nursing home.\n\nS\u014dsuke reunites with Lisa and meets Gran Mamare, with whom Lisa has just had a long private conversation. Gran Mamare asks him if he can love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human; S\u014dsuke replies likewise. She then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers. Ponyo agrees, and she is encased in a bubble given to S\u014dsuke, who is instructed to kiss it to complete Ponyo's transformation, as the balance of nature is restored. The previously stranded ships head back to port. Fujimoto respects his daughter's choice, having decided he can trust S\u014dsuke. Ponyo then joyfully jumps high in the air and kisses S\u014dsuke, completing her transformation as a human.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character name\n!

His experience in Tomonoura established the kind of setting he wanted for his next film.{{sfn|Arakawa|2009|loc=35:50}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/entertainment/news/20080306-OHT1T00058.htm |script-title=ja:\u5bae\u5d0e\u99ff\u76e3\u7763\u6700\u65b0\u4f5c\u300c\u5d16\u306e\u4e0a\u306e\u30dd\u30cb\u30e7\u300d\u30a4\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u72ec\u5360\u5165\u624b |publisher=\u5831\u77e5\u65b0\u805e |language=ja |date=March 6, 2008 |access-date=September 18, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080804055052/http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/entertainment/news/20080306-OHT1T00058.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = August 4, 2008}}</ref> During his time there, he read the complete works of [[Natsume S\u014dseki]]. He took particular interest in ''[[The Gate (novel)|The Gate]]'', a book involving a character named S\u014dsuke who lived at the bottom of a cliff. This provided him more concrete ideas for characters and settings.{{sfn|Tsuchiya|2008|loc=13:40}} Initially, Miyazaki solely considered the concept of a film that would depict a stormy sea with \"waves higher than the house on a hillside\". He later created the character Ponyo, a name he thought of as an [[onomatopoeia]] of what \"soft, squishy softness\" feels like when touched.<ref name=\"AICN_interview_20090803\">{{cite web |last = Prokopy |first = Steve |title = Comic-Con '09: Capone Chats With The Mighty Hayao Miyazaki about his Latest, PONYO!! |work = [[Ain't It Cool News]] |date = August 3, 2009 |url = https://www.aintitcool.com/node/41918 |access-date = August 3, 2009}}</ref> Miyazaki recalled that as a nine-year-old he borrowed a copy of [[Hans Christian Andersen|Hans Christian Andersen's]] \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" from his neighbour, and that while he was reading it he had difficulty accepting its premise that its protagonist did not have a soul.{{sfn|Kanazawa|2008|loc=00:10}}\n\nWhen preparing pre-production materials, Miyazaki hit a creative block before visiting the [[Tate Britain]] art museum, where he found himself startled by an 1852 painting named ''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' and its attention to detail. He remarked, \"I thought, my work is shoddy compared to those artists. I was just astonished. At that point, it became clear to me. Our animation style could not go on as before.\"{{sfn|Arakawa|2009}} At the time [[Katsuya Kond\u014d]], Miyazaki's colleague, had been the animation director of ''[[Looking for a Home (film)|House Hunting]]'' (2006), a 12-minute short film made for screening at the [[Ghibli Museum]]. The short used solid and simple lines, and largely used hand-drawn animation. During the production of the short, Kond\u014d had discussed the possibility of producing a feature-length film like this. Kond\u014d accepted an offer to work on the next Studio Ghibli feature film soon after completing the short, identifying an opportunity to progress the ideas behind ''House Hunting'' with more consideration to story.{{sfn|Ghibli|2009|p=19}}\n\nProduction of ''Ponyo'' began in May 2006. Kond\u014d was given the role of animation supervisor, and worked closely with Miyazaki in outlining a set of goals that defined the direction of the project, including the use of [[traditional animation]] throughout production.{{sfn|Ghibli|2009|p=16}} Borrowing from Kond\u014d's experience in animating ''House Hunting'', ''Ponyo'' would use solid and simple lines; in isolating basic animation elements, the film would aim to demonstrate the advantages of hand drawn animation through the depiction of motion that cannot be reproduced in any other medium.{{sfn|Ghibli|2009|p=16}}{{sfn|Ghibli|2009|p=19}} An example of the simple style is when Miyazaki painted a picture of Ponyo riding on a flock of fish, called \"Ponyo is Here\", which was inspired by him listening to ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]'' while writing a letter to his staff about going with a more elemental style. This would later become a scene in the film.{{sfn|Arakawa|2009|loc=22:10-24:05; 25:12-27:59}} In normal productions, animating a sailing [[ship]] would usually involve drawing one cel and sliding it across the frame, which would fix it in a predefined perspective and direction. Miyazaki, however, wanted the ships that appeared in ''Ponyo'' to be drawn frame-by-frame.{{sfn|Ghibli|2009|p=23}} A few previous Studio Ghibli films used [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), the earliest being ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (1997).{{sfn|Tsuchiya|2008|loc=08:20}} For the production of ''Ponyo'' however, the computer graphics section at the studio was closed to prioritize hand-drawn animation.<ref name=\"awn\">{{cite web |last1=Desowitz |first1=Bill |title=Character Designer Katsuya Kondo Talks 'Ponyo' |url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/character-designer-katsuya-kondo-talks-ponyo |website=[[Animation World Network]] |access-date=27 April 2020 |date=August 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSome elements of the film were inspired by [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]''.<ref name=\"officialsite_keywords\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ghibli.jp/ponyo/press/keyword/ |script-title=ja:\u5d16\u306e\u4e0a\u306e\u30dd\u30cb\u30e7\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 \u30ad\u30fc\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9 |language=ja |publisher=Studio Ghibli |access-date=July 21, 2008}}</ref> Ponyo's birth name, Brunhilde, is a deliberate reference to the eldest of the nine legendary Valkyrie and Wagner's Br\u00fcnnhilde.
