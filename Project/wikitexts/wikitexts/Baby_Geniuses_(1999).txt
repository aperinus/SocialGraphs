The viseme shapes were sampled from syllables uttered by the babies on the set.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nThe film grossed over $36 million worldwide.<ref name=mojo/> In 2004, it was followed by a sequel, ''[[Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2]]'', which was a box office bomb, and received reviews even more critical than the first film, getting nominated for Worst Picture at the [[25th Golden Raspberry Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nTwo scientists, Dr. Elena Kinder and Dr. Heep use genius-baby studies to fund BabyCo's [[theme park]] \"Joyworld\". According to Dr. Kinder's research on toddlers/babies, babies are born possessing vast, universal knowledge and speak a secret yet impossible-to-translate baby pre-language called ''Babytalk''. However, at age 2\u20133, the knowledge and language are lost as the babies \"cross over\" by learning how to speak [[human languages]]. All babies raised in Dr. Kinder's underground research facility were adopted from the orphanages Babyco supports (as they serve to filter out which babies should be raised under the Kinder Method and which babies shouldn't be raised under the Kinder Method) and transformed into small geniuses through use of the Kinder Method, and then used in experiments to decipher this secret yet impossible-to-translate language used by the eight baby geniuses.\n\nOne mischievous toddler, Sylvester (the only one of her toddlers raised via the use of the superior version of the Kinder Method), nicknamed \"Sly\", makes repeated attempts to escape Dr. Kinder's research facility. One night, Sylvester goes into a diaper truck and succeeds. The next morning, he is surprised to run into his long-lost normal twin brother, Whit, in a Joyworld playground. Although Sylvester and Whit share a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] bond, each has no idea of the other's existence. The guards from Dr. Kinder's research facility capture Whit, mistaking him for Sylvester, and take him back to Dr. Kinder's research facility. Sylvester is taken home by Whit's adopted mother, Robin, who is Dr. Kinder's niece. Dr. Kinder and the seven other baby geniuses are shocked that Whit and Sylvester switched places at the mall, but Dr. Kinder becomes excited and begins to see this as an opportunity to do a cross-evaluation on the twins. However, when she comes to Dan Bobbin's place, she realizes that Dan can understand babies. After the attempts to retrieve Sylvester fail, Dr. Kinder decides to move the research facility to [[Liechtenstein]], and they have no choice but to make Whit the only normal baby to be raised in this research facility until they can find a possible way to get Sylvester back to her research facility.\n\nThe babies at Bobbin's place hypnotize Lenny, the bus driver, to drive to Dr. Kinder's research facility. Once at the research facility, Sylvester goes to the control room to set the robots from the theme park on the lab scientists. When the Bobbins return home, their natural daughter Carrie tells her father that the children are in Dr. Kinder's research facility. At the end of the fight, Dr. Kinder captures Whit and takes him to the helicopter pad on the roof. Robin and Dan chase them to the roof, where Dr. Kinder reveals that she and Robin are not related and that Robin was adopted at age 2. After Dr. Kinder is arrested by the police, Sylvester and Whit come together on the roof to cross over.\n\nDan and Robin adopt Sylvester. Dan is still curious about the secrets of life; but, as the twins have crossed over, they no longer know those secrets. Carrie, their sister, doesn't reveal anything (just giving her father a Sly smile) because adults are never meant to know their secrets.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Dr. Elena Kinder\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Dr. Heep\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Dan Bobbins (the biological father of Carrie and adoptive father of Whit & Sylvester)\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Robin Bobbins, Dan's wife (the biological mother of Carrie and adoptive mother of Whit & Sylvester)\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Lenny, who is a janitor and sitter for Dan and Robin.\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Margo, Dan and Robin's housekeeper.\n* [[Kyle Howard]] as Dickie/Ice Pick, a teenage guru of the group in Dan and Robin's family.\n* [[Kathleen Freeman]] as Lenny's Noisy Neighbor (uncredited)\n* [[Jim Hanks]] as Goon Ray \n* [[Sam McMurray]] as Goon Bob\n* [[Dan Monahan]] as Reporter\n* [[Leo, Gerry and Myles Fitzgerald]] as Sylvester & Whit<ref>{{cite news |last=Beck |first=Karen |title=The faces of our Baby Geniuses |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/107559114/the-faces-of-our-baby-geniuses-karen/|access-date=August 14, 2022 |work=Alberni Valley Times |date=February 6, 1998 |page=1}}</ref> (Voiced by [[Miko Hughes]])<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hill |first1=Veronica |title=Hughes provides voice of twins in 'Baby Geniuses' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/107552286/hughes-provides-voice-of-twins-in-baby/ |access-date=August 14, 2022 |work=Daily Press |date=January 30, 1998 |pages=21}}</ref>\n* Brianna and Brittany McConnell as Lexi (Voiced by Lexi Thomas)\n* Gabrielle and Megan Robbins as Carrie Bobbins (Voiced by Aaron Spann & [[Scarlett Pomers]])\n* Jacob and Zachary Handy as Ducy (Voiced by [[Seth Adkins]])\n* Griffen and Connor Legget as Basil (Voiced by [[Scotty Leavenworth]])\n* Amanda & Caitlin Fein as Teddie (Voiced by Ashli Adams)\n\n==Production==\nThe film's concept was conceived by producer [[Steven Paul]], who was inspired by a moment in his life when he saw two babies communicating together at a [[Barneys New York]]. David Saunders, the then-president of Sony's [[Triumph Films]], wasn't sure that the film could work until he saw the movie [[Babe (film)|Babe]], which had similar use of mouth morphing.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> The studio held auditions for babies in about six cities. Triplet actors Miles, Leo, and Gerry Fitzgerald were almost three when they were cast in the dual role of Wilt and Sly.

Leslie of [[Boxoffice Pro|Box Office Magazine]] gave the film 3 out of 5 stars.
