It stars [[Audrey Hepburn]] as a princess out to see Rome on her own and [[Gregory Peck]] as a reporter. Hepburn won an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance; the screenplay and costume design also won.\n\nThe script was written by [[John Dighton]] and [[Dalton Trumbo]], though with Trumbo on the [[Hollywood blacklist]], he did not receive a credit, and [[Ian McLellan Hunter]] [[front (identity)|fronted]] for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on [[DVD]] in 2003. On December 19, 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored. Blacklisted director [[Bernard Vorhaus]] worked on the film as an assistant director under a pseudonym.<ref name=kpcc>{{cite news|last=Cheryl Devall|first=Paige Osburn|title=Blacklisted writer gets credit restored after 60 years for Oscar-winning film|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/12/19/30417/blacklisted-writer-gets-credit-restored-oscar-winn/|access-date=December 20, 2011|newspaper=89.3 KPCC|date=December 19, 2011|archive-date=January 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112145432/http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/12/19/30417/blacklisted-writer-gets-credit-restored-oscar-winn/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=latimes-verrier>{{cite news|last=Verrier|first=Richard|title=Writers Guild restores screenplay credit to Trumbo for 'Roman Holiday'|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/12/writers-guild-restores-screenplay-credit-to-trumbo-for-roman-holiday.html|access-date=December 20, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 19, 2011|archive-date=January 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112164726/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/12/writers-guild-restores-screenplay-credit-to-trumbo-for-roman-holiday.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot at the [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] studios and [[location shooting|on location]] around [[Rome]] during the \"[[Hollywood on the Tiber]]\" era. The film was screened in the 14th [[Venice Film Festival]] within the official program.\n\nIn 1999, ''Roman Holiday'' was selected for preservation in the [[United States]] [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nAnn, a crown princess from an unnamed European nation on a state visit to Rome, becomes frustrated with her tightly scheduled life and secretly leaves her country's embassy. The delayed effect of a sedative makes her fall asleep on a bench, where Joe Bradley, an expatriate reporter for the \"American News Service\", finds her, without recognizing who she is. Thinking that she is intoxicated, Joe lets her spend the night in his apartment.\n\nThe next morning, Joe hurries off late to work and gives his editor, Mr. Hennessy, false details of his attendance at the princess's press conference. When Hennessy informs him that the event had been cancelled and shows him a news item about the princess's \"sudden illness\" with a picture of her in it, he realizes who is asleep in his apartment. Seeing an opportunity, Joe privately calls his photographer friend, Irving Radovich, to get him to secretly take pictures. Joe then tells Hennessy that he will get an exclusive wide-ranging interview with the princess and asks how much that would be worth. Hennessy offers to pay $5000, but bets Joe $500 that he will not be able to get it.\n[[File:Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck on Vespa in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Joe and Ann careen through Rome on a [[Vespa]] [[scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]]]\nJoe hurries home and, hiding the fact that he is a reporter, offers to show \"Anya\" around Rome. However, Ann declines Joe's offer and leaves. Enjoying her freedom, she explores an outdoor market, buys a pair of shoes, observes the people and daily life of Rome, and gets her long hair cut short. Joe follows and \"accidentally\" meets Ann on the [[Spanish Steps]]. This time, he convinces her to spend the day with him, taking her to a street caf\u00e9 where he meets up with Irving. When Anya tries to drive Joe on a [[Vespa]] through heavy Roman traffic they are all arrested, but Joe and Irving show their \"fake\" press passes and the group is set free. They visit the [[Bocca della Verit\u00e0|Mouth of Truth]], where Joe tricks Ann into thinking that his hand has been bitten off, and later tour the [[Colosseum]].\n\nThat night, at a dance on a boat that her barber had invited her to, government agents called in by the embassy spot Ann and try to forcibly take her away. Joe, Irving, and the barber rush in to save her from the abductors. Ann joins in the fight that breaks out. As police arrive and subdue the agents, Joe and Ann run away, but after Joe is ambushed and falls into the river, Ann jumps in to save him. They swim away from the dance and kiss as they sit shivering on the riverbank. Later at Joe's apartment, while drying their wet clothes, they share tender bittersweet moments. Regretfully bowing to her royal responsibilities, Ann asks Joe to drive her to a corner near the embassy, where they kiss again. She bids a tearful farewell and resumes her duties as a princess.\n\nJoe decides not to write the story, although he tells Irving he is free to sell his photographs. Joe and Irving then leave to attend the postponed press conference at the embassy, much to Princess Ann's surprise. Joe assures Ann (in words she, but not the other reporters, will understand) that he will print nothing about their day together. At the end of the interview, the princess unexpectedly asks to meet the journalists, speaking briefly with each. As she reaches Joe and Irving, Irving presents her with his photographs as a memento of Rome. She and Joe share a few innocuous words together, before she reluctantly departs. After the rest of the press leave, Joe stays for awhile, then walks away alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Joe Bradley\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Princess Ann\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Irving Radovich\n* [[Hartley Power]] as Hennessy, Joe's editor\n* [[Harcourt Williams]] as the Ambassador of Princess Ann's country\n* [[Margaret Rawlings]] as Countess Vereberg, Ann's principal [[lady-in-waiting]]\n* [[Tullio Carminati]] as General Provno\n* [[Paolo Carlini]] as Mario Delani\n* [[Claudio Ermelli]] as Giovanni\n* [[Paola Borboni]] as Charwoman\n* [[Laura Solari]] as Secretary\n* [[Alfredo Rizzo]] as Taxi Driver\n* [[Gorella Gori]] as Shoe Seller\n* [[Hans Hinrich]] as Dr. Bonnachoven\n}}\n\n==Casting==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width1    = 135\n| width2    = 135\n| footer    = [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]] star as Joe Bradley and Princess Ann\n| image1    = Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday trailer cropped.jpg\n| alt1      = Peck\n| image2    = Audrey Hepburn Roman Holiday cropped.jpg\n| alt2      = Hepburn\n}}\n\nWyler first offered the role to Hollywood favorite [[Cary Grant]].
