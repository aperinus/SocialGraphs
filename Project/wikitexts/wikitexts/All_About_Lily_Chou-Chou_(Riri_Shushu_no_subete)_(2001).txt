These features, which have led the film to be described as restless or \"explosive\",<ref name=\"O'Hehir\">{{Cite web|last=O'Hehir|first=Andrew|date=2002-07-24|title=\"All About Lily Chou-Chou\"|url=https://www.salon.com/2002/07/24/lily/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-26|website=Salon|language=en}}</ref> are viewed by critics as efforts to artistically evoke the emotional lives of disaffected Japanese youth.\n\nCritics mostly expressed positive views on ''All About Lily Chou-Chou''. While some found the story's ambiguity frustrating, the film's [[lyricism]] drew praise.<!-- Michael Atkinson and Scott Tobias, to be specific, praised its \"lyricism\".-->\n\n==Plot==\n''All About Lily Chou-Chou'' follows two boys, Y\u016bichi Hasumi and Sh\u016bsuke Hoshino from the start of junior middle school into the eighth grade. The film has a discontinuous storyline, starting midway through the story, just after the second term of junior high school begins, then flashes back to the first term and summer vacation, and then skips back to the present. \n\nFourteen year-old Yuichi Hasumi runs a fan site and message board for Lily Chou-Chou, his favourite singer. Posting under the alias \"Philia\", he befriends another user named \"Blue Cat\". A shy and socially-outcast teenager, Yuichi is viciously bullied by his older classmate Shusuke Hoshino and his gang, who beat him and force him to publicly masturbate. The film flashes back to the previous year, where Shusuke is introduced as the academically-gifted class president who meets Yuichi at the school's [[kendo]] club. The pair become close friends, and Shusuke invites Yuichi to stay over at his house, introducing him to Lily Chou-Chou's music. Yuichi is moved by her music, joining her cult following. Back at school, he develops a crush on his classmate, Kuno.\n\nOn summer vacation, Shusuke, Yuichi, and their friends decide to take a trip to [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]. Once there, Shusuke has a traumatic [[near-death experience]] and his personality changes from good-natured to dangerous and manipulative. Returning to school in September, he takes his place as class bully and shows his newfound power by ruining the lives of his classmates. An alternative voice, that of the character Sumika Kanzaki, attributes Shusuke's personality change to the collapse of his family's business and his parents' divorce.\n\nYuichi finds himself sucked into his now-tormentor's gang. He is ridiculed and coerced into doing Shusuke's dirty work, and finds solace only in the ethereal music of Lily Chou-Chou and chatting with his online friends on his fan website. Things become far worse for everyone when Yuichi is assigned to supervising Shiori Tsuda, whom Shusuke has blackmailed into [[enjo k\u014dsai]]. Kuno is raped by Shusuke's lackeys after unwittingly offending the school's girl gang. A guilt-ridden Yuichi lends Tsuda his copy of Lily Chou-Chou's album; she later dies by suicide. Yuichi, grieving, is talked out of suicide by Blue Cat in a series of online messages.\n\nYuichi heads to Tokyo to see a Lily Chou-Chou concert, where him and \"Blue Cat\" have also arranged to meet in person. Yuichi runs into Shusuke, who coercively throws away Yuichi's ticket. Yuichi watches the concert outside on a screen and realizes that Shusuke was Blue Cat. Yuichi stabs him in the middle of a crowd after the concert, killing him. \n\nAt home, Yuichi begins his life again, reconciling with his schoolteacher and dyeing his hair. He shares a moment with Kuno as she plays piano. The movie's final scene shows Yuichi, Shusuke, and Tsuda standing alone in a field, listening to the music of Lily Chou-Chou.\n\n== Production ==\n\nOn April 1, 2000, Shunji Iwai went live with his internet novel, in the form of a website called ''Lilyholic'', where he posted messages as several characters on the BBS. Readers of the novel were free to post alongside Iwai's characters and interact with each other, indeed this BBS is where some of the content from the movie comes from. After the main incident in the novel took place, posting was closed and the second phase of the novel started, about the lives of 14-year-olds. (The novel is available on [[CD-ROM]], but only in Japanese.)\n\nProduction on the film began in [[Ashikaga, Tochigi|Ashikaga]], [[Tochigi Prefecture]] on August 13, 2000, and ended on November 28, 2000. It premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 7, 2001, and opened in [[Japan]] on October 6, 2001.\n\nIwai was the first Japanese director to use the, at the time, completely new digital video camera, the [[Sony HDW-F900]] to shoot the film.\n\nIt is thought that Iwai was inspired to shoot in digital by his friend, the [[anime]] and live-action film director [[Hideaki Anno]], who shot his own digital film entitled ''[[Love & Pop]]'', in 1998. Anno later cast Iwai as the lead in his second live-action film, ''[[Shiki-Jitsu]]''. After the film's release a synopsis written from the point of view of the main character Y\u016bichi was published online to explain the film's events.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://apm.asianfilmmarket.org/eng/database/view_ppp_history.asp?order_year=2000&idx=40&no=6 |title=Asian Project Market |access-date=2014-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814041046/http://apm.asianfilmmarket.org/eng/database/view_ppp_history.asp?order_year=2000&idx=40&no=6 |archive-date=2014-08-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe soundtrack of ''Lily Chou-Chou'' was written and arranged by [[Takeshi Kobayashi]], with vocals by the singer [[Salyu]]. It features a number of songs that are sung by the fictional rock star Lily Chou-Chou in the film. The soundtrack also makes heavy use of the classical music of [[Claude Debussy]].\n\nIn 2010 [[Salyu]] and [[Takeshi Kobayashi]] released a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTlH-4tt9Vo|new song] under the YouTube name 'LilyChouChou2000', suggesting that the Lily Chou-Chou moniker was still alive.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Shugo Oshinari]] as '''Sh\u016bsuke Hoshino''' (\u661f\u91ce\u4fee\u4ecb ''Hoshino Sh\u016bsuke''), the best student in school who, after a trip to Okinawa, becomes a bully. Posts under the alias Blue Cat (\u9752\u732b ''Ao Neko'').\n*[[Hayato Ichihara]] as '''Y\u016bichi Hasumi''' (\u84ee\u898b\u96c4\u4e00 ''Hasumi Y\u016bichi''), Shusuke's former friend who becomes a reluctant member of his gang and will later on be bullied by Shusuke. Y\u016bichi is the leading character in the movie. He admins an online Lily Chou-Chou BBS under the alias Philia (\u30d5\u30a3\u30ea\u30a2 ''Firia'') and is a great fan of the singer.\n*[[Ayumi Ito]] as '''Y\u014dko Kuno''' (\u4e45\u91ce\u967d\u5b50 ''Kuno Y\u014dko''), a classmate of Y\u016bichi's. A brilliant pianist, she is the envy of a clique of powerful girls, and therefore is also bullied. She is raped by Shusuke's gang and cuts off her hair as a way of avoiding Shiori Tsuda's fate.\n*[[Y\u016b Aoi]] as '''Shiori Tsuda''' (\u6d25\u7530\u8a69\u7e54 ''Tsuda Shiori''), a classmate of Y\u016bichi who gets blackmailed into [[enjo k\u014dsai]] by Shusuke. Y\u016bichi befriends her later on, and introduces her to Lily's music. Near the end of the movie she takes her life.\n*[[Yuki Ito (actor)|Yuki Ito]] as '''Kamino''', one of the boys in the blue school uniforms at the train station when Yoko is introduced.\n*[[Izumi Inamori]] as '''Izumi Hoshino''' (\u661f\u91ce\u3044\u305a\u307f ''Hoshino Izumi''), Shusuke's mother. It is unknown if she is single. She loves her son very much and welcomes Y\u016bichi with open arms during a junior high sleepover at the Hoshino household. A classmate of Y\u016bichi suggests that this is done to ensure that Y\u016bichi will enjoy being Hoshino's friend.\n*[[Salyu]] as '''Lily Chou-Chou''', the enigmatic and ethereal singer that Y\u016bichi, Tsuda and others in the film are fans of. She is hardly seen in the film, except on a video screen near the story's end, but her music is heard throughout the movie. She is said by her fans to channel what is called \"the [[Luminiferous aether|Ether]]\", which is not unlike the invisible substance once thought by ancient philosophers to be the field that light travels through. This \"ether\" can be heard in the calm, melancholy songs she sings.\n*[[Takao Osawa]] as Takao Tabito\n*[[Miwako Ichikawa]] as Shimabukuro\n\n== Details ==\n*[[Quentin Tarantino]] used the song \"Kaifuku Suru Kizu (Wounds that heal)\" from the ''Lily Chou-Chou'' soundtrack in ''[[Kill Bill]]'', in the scene where the Bride views [[Hattori Hanz\u014d]]'s sword collection.\n*The idea of Lily Chou-Chou the rock star was inspired by [[Faye Wong]].\n*Extras at the concert scene were given an index card with extremely detailed information as to the thought process they should be going through during filming. There were hundreds of extras, partly made up of fans of the internet novel who had BBS meet ups during the day. Posters from the BBS are visible in the background of this scene and can be spotted by watching for clues from their posts.\n*[[Ayumi Ito]] spent weeks training on the piano in order to do all of her scenes without a double. She became so obsessed with [[Debussy]]'s \"[[Arabesques (Debussy)|Arabesque No. 1]]\" that she made it her cell phone ringtone.\n*Originally, in the internet novel, Y\u016bichi and Hoshino belong to the [[Track and field|track]] team, not the [[kendo]] team.\n*Debussy wrote his famous Children's Corner Suite (1909) for his beloved daughter whom he nicknamed Chouchou.\n*The movie's original runtime was 157 minutes, but the original print of the 157 minute version no longer exists because it was burned. The extra 11 minutes was composed of extra and intense footage of the rape scene, a scene with Y\u016bichi on the beach (similar to Hoshino's drowning scene) and an extended funeral scene.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n==Style==\nComparing it to ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959), Andrew O'Hehir dubbed ''All About Lily Chou-Chou'' \"sprawling and adventurous [...] [Iwai's] movie has a youthful restlessness, an almost compulsive daring\".<ref name=O'Hehir/> According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''<nowiki/>'s [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]], Iwai \"creates Yuichi\u2019s world as much through [[Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne|disembodied moments of sight and sound]] as through action\".<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|date=2020-03-17|title=All About Lily Chou-Chou|url=https://ew.com/article/2002/07/10/all-about-lily-chou-chou/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-23|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|language=en}}</ref> According to Kevin Thomas in ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the film contains \"sweeping juxtapositions of the beautiful and the terrible in both the aural and the visual\".

Lily herself never appears in the film, and O'Hehir interpreted her as a symbol for a tranquility that has disappeared from the rapidly changing Japan of the film's universe.<ref name=O'Hehir/> While Thomas agreed that the film supports the idea that traditional social structures prevent the rise of disaffected youth, he also wrote that the teens' brutality and allegiance to a sadistic leader strongly resembled the militarism of Japan during [[World War II]].<ref name=Thomas/>\n\nAtkinson argues that ''All About Lily Chou-Chou'' \"[mourns] the despoiling tragedies of pre-adulthood and the infuriating inadequacy of nostalgia.\"<ref name=Atkinson/> Tobias said the film ultimately laments how all the teens are bottling up anger.<ref name=Tobias/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has a 69% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (based on 39 reviews),<ref>{{Cite web|title=All About Lily Chou-Chou|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/all_about_lily_chou_chou|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-26|website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> and a 73/100 average on [[Metacritic]] (based on 18 reviews).<ref>{{Cite web|title=All About Lily Chou-Chou|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-about-lily-chou-chou|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-26|website=Metacritic}}</ref> Atkinson referred to ''All About Lily Chou-Chou'' as \"possibly the loveliest film ever shot on high-def video.\" He argued that the work overly lacks narrative cues, but still wrote that \"Iwai fashions pensive cyber-lyricism out of a new generation\u2019s instruments of introversion\".<ref name=Atkinson/> O'Hehir praised \"its wealth of ideas, its willingness to go anywhere and do anything [...] [Iwai's] lustrous images and the complexity of his portrayal of middle-class Japan in decline\". He described it as a \"puzzling, intermittently brilliant film\".<ref name=\"O'Hehir\" />\n\nIn ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Scott Tobias wrote, \"Iwai's arty self-consciousness takes some getting used to, but as the film slides inexorably toward a devastating third act, it seems to tighten its grasp on the sad, painful remove that governs its young characters' lives.\"<ref name=Tobias/> Kevin Thomas wrote a moderately positive review in ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', calling the work \"maddeningly hard to follow\" but also \"profoundly disturbing [...] Iwai\u2019s depiction of what life can be like for far too many teens comes across loud and clear.\"<ref name=Thomas/>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars, dismissing the visual style as \"tiresome and pretentious\". On the narrative he wrote, \"The elements are in place for a powerful story of alienated Japanese teenagers, but [Iwai] cannot bring himself to make the story accessible to ordinary audiences. [...] Some sequences are so incomprehensible they play as complete abstractions.\" Regarding the comparisons to ''The 400 Blows'', Ebert argued, \"[[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut|Truffaut]] broke with traditional styles in order to communicate better, not to avoid communicating at all.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=2002-11-29|title=All About Lily Chou-Chou movie review (2002) {{!}} Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/all-about-lily-chou-chou-2002|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-26|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en}}</ref> In 2020, James Marsh of ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' listed the film as one of the 25 best Japanese films since 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Marsh|first=James|date=2020-07-16|title=The 25 best Japanese movies of the 21st century|work=South China Morning Post|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment/article/3093136/25-best-japanese-movies-21st-century|access-date=2021-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n*2002 [[Berlin International Film Festival]] \u2013 Panorama ([[Shunji Iwai]])\n*2002 [[6th Shanghai International Film Festival]] \u2013 Best Music ([[Takeshi Kobayashi]]) and Special Jury Award (Shunji Iwai)\n\n==Box office totals==\n\n*'''Budget''': \u00a5150,000,000 (US$1,249,656)\n\nLocal:\n*'''Japan''': \u00a53,026,188,000 (US$25,211,298)\n*'''Opening Week Gross''': \u00a5514,775,000 (US$4,288,612)\n*'''Date Released''': October 6, 2001\n*'''In release''': 15.7 weeks\n\nInternational:\n*'''USA''': US$26,485 (\u00a53,179,328)\n\nRentals:\n*'''Japan''': \u00a5810,340,000 (US$6,750,436)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.lily-chou-chou.jp/world/index.html Official site]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0297721|title=All About Lily Chou-Chou}}\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.salyu.jp/ Salyu's official site]\n*[http://www.ilovelilychouchou.com Fan site 'I Love Lily Chou-Chou']\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/2001/dy002720.htm|title=\u30ea\u30ea\u30a3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e5\u30b7\u30e5\u306e\u3059\u3079\u3066 (''Rir\u012b Shushu no Subete'')|accessdate=2007-07-21|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070702150625/http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/2001/dy002720.htm| archivedate= 2 July 2007 | url-status= live}}\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/13/movies/13CHOU.html?ex=1228021200&en=1fc2cc48e7f3a1c4&ei=5070 \"An Unreal Star Unleashes Real Teenagers' Brutality\"] -(''[[The New York Times]]'' review)\n\n{{Shunji Iwai}}\n\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:Films about juvenile delinquency]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Shunji Iwai]]\n[[Category:Japanese coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
