Directed by [[Gregor Jordan]], the film's [[film adaptation|adapted screenplay]] was written by [[John Michael McDonagh]]. The film dramatises the life of [[Ned Kelly]], a legendary [[bushranger]] and [[outlaw]] who was active mostly in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the colony of his birth. In the film, Kelly, his brother [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan]], and two other associates\u2014[[Steve Hart]] and [[Joe Byrne]]\u2014form a gang of [[Irish Australians]] in response to Irish and English tensions that arose in 19th century Australia. [[Heath Ledger]] stars in the title role, with [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Naomi Watts]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $6 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter saving a young boy from drowning and being awarded a \"hero sash\" when he was himself a 10-year-old, [[Ned Kelly]] grows up in the British colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] where he was born. The son of a Catholic Irish settler, he lives with his widowed mother Ellen, his younger brother [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan]], and his two younger sisters Kate and Grace. Ned's best friend [[Joe Byrne|Joe]] and Dan's best friend [[Steve Hart|Steve]] are also often at the house. One day in 1871, when he is 17 years old, he sees a white [[mare]] grazing alone in the outback. He rides it into town to impress a local girl named Jane, only to be arrested and subsequently imprisoned for supposedly stealing the horse, even though it had actually been stolen by an acquaintance of his, Wild Wright.\n\nHe is released and comes home three years later, and starts helping his family with their small horse-breeding farm located near [[Beechworth]]. He takes vengeance on Wild Wright by beating him in a [[bare-knuckle boxing|prizefight]], and befriends Julia Cook, the beautiful wife of an English land owner who lives nearby. One night at a bar, a local [[constable]] named Fitzpatrick is abusively courting Kate. Ned intervenes and hostilities erupt with Fitzpatrick and his fellow officers. To get back at Ned, they take the Kellys' horses, but with the help of his brother and their friends, Ned steals them back. Some nights later, while Ned and Julia are consummating their blossoming passion in the Cooks' stables, Fitzpatrick shows up at the Kelly farm and asks to see Kate; when she once more rejects him, he tries to arrest Dan for horse stealing, invoking non-existent warrants for him and Ned. A fight ensues and Fitzpatrick is wounded, and falsely reports that it's Ned Kelly who shot him. In retaliation, the police arrest Ned's mother.\n\nNed asks Julia to testify he was with her the night Fitzpatrick was at the Kelly's farm, but she refuses, saying that she would be disgraced by the public acknowledgement of their affair and her husband would take her children away. Ned, Dan, Joe and Steve become outlaws on the run. They later meet a patrol in the [[bushland]] and kill three officers in a shoot-out, despite Ned's efforts to have nobody get hurt. During the following months the \"Kelly Gang\" avoids capture, living in the outback, often without food. On one occasion, Julia gives them shelter at her farm while her husband is away.\n\nA large bounty is placed on their heads, and a decree is passed that allows anybody to shoot them on sight without consequences. They rob two English banks and burn the mortgage documents with which the Crown is starving the [[Selection (Australian history)|selectors]]. They give the money from their robberies to poor families in need, and soon become acclaimed as folk heroes by the Victorian population as much as the media depict them as violent criminals. To solve a situation in danger of escalating into widespread revolt, the Colonial Government sends in stern [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] Francis Hare, who arrests many sympathizers including Joe's childhood friend [[Aaron Sherritt|Aaron]]. Being promised they won't harm Joe, but only the Kellys, Aaron agrees to work as an informant. During a quick visit back into Beechworth, Joe learns Aaron has been seen talking with cops, so the gang decide to feed him false information about their next heist, to test his loyalty. When they see a large group of constables heading to the bank Aaron was told about, they know Aaron betrayed them, and Joe kills him at his house.\n\nNed devises a plan to foil Superintendent Hare. The gang lures him in by taking over the town of [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]]. They gather everybody the townspeople, most of whom are friendly to their causes, at the Glenrowan Inn, to better protect them in the upcoming fight. In the meantime, they sabotage the railroad tracks leading into town, to derail the train on which Hare and his army of constables are travelling. They've also built metal helmets and plates of body armour to survive bullets. They count on the derailment to kill most of them constables, planning to then capture Hare and exchange him for Ned and Dan's mother. Unfortunately, an escaped hostage stops the train in time to avoid the incident. Hundreds of officers lay siege to the inn late at night. Determined to go out in a blaze of glory, the Kelly Gang emerge from the inn and begin shooting, protected by their armour, but are forced inside again. The police once again raid the inn, killing innocent civilians during the shoot-out. To buy the time needed for the townspeople to flee from the back, Ned exits and charges forward alone; he is ultimately shot in the arms and legs and falls out of sight. Near dawn, Joe is shot and dies inside the inn. Dan and Steve, down to their last bullets and knowing all is lost, commit suicide. Ned regains consciousness and even though gravely injured, continues to fire at the police. He is finally shot to the ground and taken down. Ned is loaded onto the train to be brought back and face justice; Hare asks if he may have his beloved green-and-gold sash, which he's still wearing 15 years after he saved the drowning child.\n\nIn the end, even with a petition of over 32,000 signatures strong asking for a pardon, Kelly is hanged at [[Old Melbourne Gaol]] on 11 November 1880.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as [[Ned Kelly]]\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as [[Joe Byrne]]\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Superintendent Francis Hare\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Julia Cook\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as [[Aaron Sherritt]]\n* [[Laurence Kinlan]] as [[Dan Kelly (bushranger)|Dan Kelly]]\n* Philip Barantini as [[Steve Hart]]\n* [[Kerry Condon]] as [[Kate Kelly (outlaw)|Kate Kelly]]\n* [[Kris McQuade]] as [[Ellen Kelly]]\n* [[Emily Browning]] as Grace Kelly\n* Erika Felton as young Ellen Kelly\n* Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick\n* [[Rachel Griffiths]] as Susan Scott\n* [[Geoff Morrell (actor)|Geoff Morrell]] as Robert Scott\n* [[Charles Tingwell]] as [[Graham Berry|Premier Graham Berry]]\n* Andrew Formosa as [[Park Ranger]]\n* [[Saskia Burmeister]] as Jane Jones\n* [[Talia Zucker]] as Sarah Wicks\n* [[Jonathan Hardy]] as The Great Orlando\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image|direction=horizontal|align=right|total_width=510|header=Filming locations in Australia\n| image1   = 2012-04-08 Ballarat.jpg\n| alt1     = \n| caption1 = [[Ballarat]] (Melbourne)\n\n| image2 = ClunesMainStreet.JPG\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Clunes, Victoria]]\n\n| image3 = Newport-workshops-west-block-assortment.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Newport Workshops]]\n}}\nPrincipal photography started on 29 April 2002, Most of the filming was done at the [[Little River Earth Sanctuary]], [[Mount Rothwell]], near [[Geelong]].
