According to Astaire, the change was made proactively by RKO.

Under the guidance of her domineering and much-married Aunt Hortense ([[Alice Brady]]), she consults incompetent and bumbling [[lawyer]] Egbert Fitzgerald ([[Edward Everett Horton]]), once a fianc\u00e9 of her aunt. He arranges for her to spend a night at a seaside hotel and to be caught in an adulterous relationship, for which purpose he hires a professional [[co-respondent]], Rodolfo Tonetti ([[Erik Rhodes (actor, born 1906)|Erik Rhodes]]). But Egbert forgets to arrange for private detectives to \"catch\" the couple.\n\nBy coincidence, Guy Holden ([[Fred Astaire]]), an American dancer and friend of Egbert's, who briefly met Mimi on his arrival in England, and who is now besotted with her, also arrives at the hotel, only to be mistaken by Mimi for the co-respondent she has been waiting for. While they are in Mimi's bedroom, Tonetti arrives, revealing the truth, and holds them \"prisoner\" to suit the plan. They contrive to escape and dance the night away.\n\nIn the morning, after several mistakes with the waiter, Cyril arrives at the door, so Guy hides in the next room, while Mimi and Tonetti give a show of being lovers. When Cyril does not believe them, Guy comes out and embraces Mimi in an attempt to convince him that ''he'' is her lover, but to no avail. It is an unwitting waiter ([[Eric Blore]]) who finally clears the whole thing up by revealing that Cyril ''himself'' is an adulterer, thus clearing the way for Mimi to get a divorce and marry Guy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Green, Stanley|year=1999|title=Hollywood Musicals Year by Year|edition=2nd|publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=0-634-00765-3|page=36}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Guy Holden\n* [[Ginger Rogers]] as Mimi\n* [[Alice Brady]] as Hortense\n* [[Edward Everett Horton]] as Egbert\n* [[Erik Rhodes (actor, born 1906)|Erik Rhodes]] as Tonetti\n* [[Eric Blore]] as The Waiter\n* [[William Austin (actor)|William Austin]] as Cyril Glossop\n* [[Charles Coleman (actor)|Charles Coleman]] as The Valet\n* [[Lillian Miles]] as Guest \n* [[Betty Grable]] as Guest\n}}\n\n==Songs==\n'''New songs introduced in the film'''\n* \"[[The Continental (song)|The Continental]]\" (w.
