It is the first installment in the [[Now You See Me (film series)|''Now You See Me'' series]]. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Isla Fisher]], [[Dave Franco]], [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]], [[Michael Caine]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. The plot follows an [[FBI]] agent and an [[Interpol]] detective who track and attempt to bring to justice a team of magicians who pull off bank heists and robberies during their performances and reward their audiences with the money.\n\nThe film premiered in [[New York City]] on May 21, 2013 before its official release in the United States on May 31, 2013, by [[Summit Entertainment]]. The film received mixed reviews with criticism being focused on the ending, but became a box office success, grossing $351.7 million worldwide against a budget of $75 million. The film won the [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite Thriller Movie and also received nominations for the [[Empire Award]] for [[Empire Award for Best Thriller|Best Thriller]] and the [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Thriller Film|Best Thriller Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Music|Best Music]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[Now You See Me 2]]'', was released on June 10, 2016.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Magic (illusion)|Magicians]] J. Daniel Atlas, Merritt McKinney, Henley Reeves, and Jack Wilder each receive a [[tarot card]] leading them to a [[New York City]] apartment, where they discover [[holography|hologram technology]] with instructions from an unknown benefactor. A year later, at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]], they perform as \"The Four Horsemen\" in a show funded by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler. Their final trick appears to transport an audience member inside the vault of the Cr\u00e9dit R\u00e9publicain bank in [[Paris]]. Stacks of [[euro]]s are drawn into the vault's air vents and showered on the Las Vegas crowd; the trick is shown to have actually happened as the Paris vault is found empty of its recent shipment of Euros.\n\n[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Dylan Rhodes and French [[Interpol]] agent Alma Dray seize and interrogate the Horsemen about the robbery but, having no evidence to hold them, have no choice but to release them. They turn to Thaddeus Bradley, a former magician turned magic [[debunker]]. Thirty years ago, Lionel Shrike, a magician exposed by Thaddeus, attempted to relaunch his career, but died inside a [[safe]] during a failed [[escapology|escape trick]]. Thaddeus demonstrates how the Horsemen used a mock vault under the Las Vegas stage, and explains that they stole the money ''before'' it arrived at the bank, replacing it with [[Nitrocellulose|flash paper]] which ignited when the vents were activated without creating any smoke or residue. He reveals that they manipulated the audience participant (who was ''intentionally'' selected beforehand) to attend the show, where he was hypnotised into helping to perform the final trick, also revealing that he was actually dropped into the vault below the stage.\n\nThaddeus and the FBI follow the Horsemen to their next show in [[New Orleans]], where the magicians transfer more than $140 million from Tressler's private accounts to certain members in the audience, composed of people whose insurance claims were denied by Tressler's company in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Rhodes attempts to capture the magicians, but members of the audience who were hypnotised to tackle him when he said a certain word allow the magicians to escape, and a vengeful Tressler hires Thaddeus to expose them for robbing him. Alma suspects the Horsemen are connected to \"the Eye\", a [[Freemason]]-like, elite group of magicians so skilled that many think they have access to real magic, who steal from the rich to give to the poor. Alma also suspects that there may be someone helping the Horsemen.\n\nDiscovering that the Horsemen replaced Dylan's cell phone with a [[covert listening device|bugged]] clone, allowing them to remain ahead of the investigation, the FBI track Dylan's ''real'' phone to the New York apartment, where three of the Horsemen escape while Jack stays back to destroy their documents. Pursued by the authorities, he loses control of his car in a fiery crash on the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. Unable to save Jack, Dylan recovers papers pointing to the Horsemen's next crime: stealing millions in cash from the Elkhorn Company's safe. The FBI find the safe missing (having being loaded on a truck under orders of one of the FBI agents, who was ''also'' hypnotised) and intercept it, only to discover that it contains nothing but balloon animals; it is revealed to be a decoy. They converge on the Horsemen's final show at [[5 Pointz]], where the magicians appear with a farewell message to the crowd. As they leap off the roof, Alma disrupts Dylan's attempt to shoot them; the Horseman disappear in a shower of counterfeit money.\n\nThe ''real'' money from the Elkhorn safe is found in Thaddeus' car and he is apprehended, presumed to be an accomplice with the Horsemen. Dylan visits him in jail, and Thaddeus deduces that the Horsemen duped the FBI into following the duplicate safe, allowing Jack, who faked his death using a decoy car and a cadaver stolen from a morgue, to break into the ''real'' safe (which was in fact ''never'' stolen but was actually ''hidden'' behind a giant mirror to trick the FBI into thinking that it ''was'' indeed missing) and frame Thaddeus with the stolen money. Thaddeus realizes that ''Dylan'' is the mastermind behind the Four Horsemen's plots, which proves Alma's suspicions correct. At the [[Central Park Carousel]], Daniel, Merritt, Henley, and Jack are welcomed by Dylan as the newest members of the Eye.\n\nMeeting Alma in [[Paris]] at the [[Pont des Arts]], Dylan reveals that ''he'' is Lionel Shrike's son. He is also the mastermind behind Horsemen tricks in order to seek retribution for his father's death: the Elkhorn Company's faulty safe led to the accident; Thaddeus Bradley who ruined his father's career; and the Cr\u00e9dit R\u00e9publicain and Tressler's insurance company failed to pay out his father's life insurance. Alma, having fallen in love with Dylan, agrees to keep his secret and they attach a [[love lock]] to the railing, throwing the key into the [[Seine]].\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the Horsemen drive to a deserted junkyard, and find a set of locked crates with the symbol of the Eye.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- DO NOT change the order of the cast.
