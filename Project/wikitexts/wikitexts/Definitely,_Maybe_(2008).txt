Set in New York City, the film is about a former political consultant who tries to help his ten-year-old daughter understand his impending divorce by telling her the story of his past romantic relationships and how he ended up marrying her mother. The film grossed $55 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nWill Hayes works at an [[advertising agency]] in [[New York City]] and is in the midst of a divorce from wife Sarah. After her first [[sex education]] class, his 10-year-old daughter Maya insists on hearing the story of how her parents met. Will gives in, but changes the names and some of the facts, leaving Maya to guess which of the women from his past is Sarah, her mother.\n\nIn 1992, Will graduates from the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] and leaves behind his college sweetheart, \"Emily Jones\", to work on the [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|Bill Clinton campaign]] in New York City. There, he meets \"April Hoffman\", a fellow campaign staffer, and delivers a package from Emily to her college friend, \"Summer Hartley\". The package is revealed to be Summer's diary, which Will reads, learning she had a brief affair with Emily. Summer is dating her professor, Hampton Roth, but spontaneously kisses Will.\n\nHe tells April his plan to propose to Emily, and rehearses his proposal; April replies, \"Definitely, maybe\". They go to her apartment where Will notices her many copies of ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. She explains that her father gave her a copy with a personal inscription shortly before he died, but the book was later lost. She has spent years searching secondhand bookstores to find it, and collects any copy with an inscription. April and Will kiss, but he abruptly leaves. The following day Emily arrives but when Will tries to propose, she confesses that she slept with his roommate, and urges him to move on and pursue his ambitions.\n\nAfter [[1992 United States presidential election|Clinton is elected]], Will opens a [[political consulting]] firm, and stays in close touch with April as she travels the world. He encounters Summer, now a journalist and single, and they begin a relationship. April returns from abroad, planning to tell Will that she loves him, but discovers he is planning to propose to Summer. Will learns that Summer has written an article that will ruin his candidate's campaign. He asks her not to publish it, but she refuses, and Will ends their relationship. The article derails the campaign, losing Will his political career and friends.\n\nYears later, April reaches out to Will, who has fallen into depression. She throws Will a birthday party, reuniting him with his old colleagues, but he quietly leaves the party early. Will then drunkenly confesses to April that he loves her, leading to an argument about the state of their lives. Passing a bookstore, he finds the inscribed copy of ''Jane Eyre'' April's father gave her. He goes to April's apartment to give her the book, but decides against it when he meets her boyfriend Kevin, who is living with her. Will runs into Summer who tells him she's pregnant and invites him to a party where he reunites with Emily, who has recently moved to New York City.\n\nIn the present, Maya deduces that \"Emily\" is her mother. Maya hopes her parents will reunite, but Will assures Maya that she is the story's happy ending, before finalizing his divorce.\n\nUnpacking in his new apartment, Will discovers April's book. He brings it to her, apologizing for waiting so long, but she asks him to leave. At Maya's urging, Will realizes he is miserable without April, whose name he didn't change in the story like he did to \"Emily\"/Sarah and to \"Summer\", whose real name is Natasha. Will and Maya go to April's apartment and he tries to explain his reasoning to her but she does not let them inside. Waiting in front of the door, Maya encourages Will to tell April the story, while April overhears the conversation through intercom. As Will and Maya walk away, April runs after them. Will explains that he kept the book as the only thing he had left of her. April invites them in to tell her the story, and she and Will kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as William \"Will\" Matthew Hayes\n* [[Isla Fisher]] as April Hoffman\n* [[Derek Luke]] as Russell T.
