The screenplay, written by [[Ol Parker]], is based on the 2004 novel ''These Foolish Things'' by novelist [[Deborah Moggach]], and features an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[Dev Patel]], [[Judi Dench]], [[Celia Imrie]], [[Bill Nighy]], [[Ronald Pickup]], [[Maggie Smith]], [[Tom Wilkinson]] and [[Penelope Wilton]], as a group of British [[pensioner]]s moving to a retirement hotel in India, run by the young and eager Sonny, played by Patel. The film was produced by [[Participant Media]] and Blueprint Pictures on a budget of $10 million.\n\nProducers [[Graham Broadbent]] and [[Peter Czernin]] first saw the potential for a film in Deborah Moggach's novel with the idea of exploring the lives of the elderly beyond what one would expect of their age group. With the assistance of screenwriter Ol Parker, they came up with a script in which they take the older characters completely out of their element and involve them in a [[romantic comedy]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on 10 October 2010 in India, and most of the filming took place in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]], including the cities of [[Jaipur]] and [[Udaipur]]. [[Ravla Khempur]], an equestrian hotel which was originally the palace of a tribal chieftain in the village of [[Khempur]], was chosen as the site for the film hotel.\n\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2012 and received positive reception from critics; ''The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'' opened to strong box-office earnings in the United Kingdom, and topped the box office after its second weekend on release. It became a [[Sleeper hit|surprise box-office hit]] following its international release, eventually grossing nearly $137 million worldwide.\n\nIt was ranked among the highest-grossing 2012 releases in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and as one of the highest-grossing speciality releases of the year. A sequel, ''[[The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]]'', began production in India in January 2014, and was released on 26 February 2015.\n\nThe film was adapted into a stageplay in 2022.<ref>https://marigoldshow.com/</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSeveral British retirees decide to move to [[Jaipur]], India, to stay in the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, advertised as an exotic [[retirement home]]. Evelyn Greenslade, a widowed housewife, must sell her house to pay off her husband's debts; Graham Dashwood, a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge who lived in Jaipur as a child, abruptly retires to return there; Jean and Douglas Ainslie hope to have an affordable retirement, after investing in their daughter's internet business; Muriel Donnelly, a former housekeeper, decides to have a cheaper hip operation in India; Madge Hardcastle, after several unsuccessful marriages, searches for new romance overseas; and Norman Cousins, an aging [[lothario]], attempts to relive his youth.\n\nAfter an eventful journey to Jaipur, the retirees discover the hotel is a dilapidated site, run by the energetic but inept manager, Sonny Kapoor. Sonny's mother moves into the hotel in the hope to convince her son to invest in a more secure job. Evelyn gets a job at a local [[call centre]], where Sonny's girlfriend Sunaina and her older brother Jay work. Graham takes long walks in search of familiar ground. While Jean hides in the hotel, overwhelmed by the cultural changes, Douglas explores the city. Muriel, at first xenophobic to Indians, comes to appreciate her doctor, and maid Anokhi. Madge joins the Viceroy Club, surprised to find Norman there, and helps him get into a relationship with a woman named Carol.\n\nGraham confides to Evelyn that he is [[Homosexuality|gay]], returning to Jaipur to find his long lost Indian lover Manoj, whom he had to leave due to a scandal involving the pair. He, Evelyn, and Douglas eventually find Manoj, who has been happily married for years, but is overjoyed to see Graham again. Graham passes away from an existing heart condition. After Graham's funeral, Evelyn breaks down in Douglas' arms, over her husband's death. Jean, increasingly pessimistic and envious, accuses Douglas of having an affair, only for Douglas to denounce their marriage. Jean then reveals their daughter's business has paid off, and they can return home.\n\nSonny and Sunaina have a falling out over a misunderstanding when Madge sleeps in Sonny's bedroom, further worsened when Mrs. Kapoor rejects Sunaina. Sonny becomes disheartened and decides to close the hotel. Evelyn encourages Sonny to express his love to Sunaina. Together, they race to the hotel, announcing to Mrs. Kapoor their intention to marry, regardless of her approval. Young Wasim, a hotel employee, reminds Mrs. Kapoor she and her late husband were in a similar situation when they wished to marry against their families' wishes. Moved, Mrs. Kapoor blesses Sonny's marriage.\n\nMuriel, investigating the hotel's accounts, convinces an investor to keep the hotel open, but she will act as a deputy manager to help Sonny. The residents agree to remain in the hotel, Carol moving in with Norman. Jean, realising her marriage is dead, encourages Douglas to return to stay in the hotel, whilst she returns to England. After a night of wandering, Douglas returns to the hotel, much to Evelyn's joy. The hotel flourishes thanks to Sonny and Muriel's partnership, with the residents staying to enjoy their retirement, Evelyn commenting with the moral, \"We get up in the morning, we do our best\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Judi Dench]] as Evelyn Greenslade, a recently widowed housewife who moves to India after paying off her husband's debts.\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Douglas Ainslie, Jean's laidback husband.\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Jean Ainslie, Douglas' pessimistic wife.\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Sir Graham Dashwood, a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge. \n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Muriel Donnelly, a former housekeeper who moves to India for a cheaper, quicker hip operation.\n* [[Dev Patel]] as Sonny Kapoor, manager of the hotel.\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Madge Hardcastle, a woman looking for a rich husband to marry.\n* [[Ronald Pickup]] as Norman Cousins, an aged [[lothario]].\n* [[Tina Desai]] as Sunaina, call centre worker, and Sonny's girlfriend.\n* [[Lillete Dubey]] as Mrs. Kapoor, widowed mother of Sonny.\n* [[Diana Hardcastle]] as Carol, an English-Indian woman and lifelong resident of Jaipur.\n* [[Sid Makkar]] as Jay, Sunaina's brother, and manager of a call centre.\n* [[Seema Azmi]] as Anokhi, a [[Dalit]] maid at the hotel who looks after Muriel.\n* [[Paul Bhattacharjee]] as Dr. Ghujarapartidar, one of Muriel's doctors.\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Manoj, an old friend and lover of Graham.\n* [[Neena Kulkarni]] as Gaurika, Manoj's wife.\n* [[Liza Tarbuck]] as head nurse Karen.\n* [[Denzil Smith]] as Mr Dhurana, the Viceroy Club Secretary\n* [[Honey Chhaya]] as Young Wasim, a hotel employee.\n* Bhuvnesh Shetty as Muriel's physiotherapist.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background and script===\n[[File:Deborah Moggach.jpg|thumb|right|Producers saw potential in Deborah Moggach's novel.]]\n\nProducers [[Graham Broadbent]] and Peter Czernin were the ones who first saw the potential for a film in [[Deborah Moggach]]'s novel. The concept of outsourcing retirement, \"taking our outsourcing of everyday tasks like banking and customer service one step further\", appealed to them, and they commissioned screenwriter [[Ol Parker]] to formulate this concept into a screenplay.<ref name=\"CinemaReview\">{{cite web|url=http://cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=7000|title=Exotic Marigold Hotel|work=Cinema Review|access-date=17 February 2014|archive-date=23 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223002149/http://cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=7000|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nParker wanted to take the older characters completely out of their element and involve them in a romantic comedy.

Producer Broadbent considers Dench's character to be central to the story, and that Evelyn is much like Dench herself, being \"the most wonderfully sympathetic person\". John Madden considers Maggie Smith's character Muriel to be \"instinctively xenophobic, never stepping out of her comfort zone in any way\".<ref name=\"CinemaReview2\">{{cite web |url=http://cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=7001|title=The Residents| work=Cinema Review |access-date=17 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe filmmakers determined early on that the role of Sonny was crucial to the outcome of the picture, and they selected Dev Patel, who at the time was still revelling in the success of ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''.
