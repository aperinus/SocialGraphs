It is based on [[John Grisham]]'s 1994 [[The Chamber (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Chris O'Donnell]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Lela Rochon]], [[Robert Prosky]], [[Raymond J. Barry]], and [[David Marshall Grant]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn April 1967, the office of Marvin Kramer, a [[Jewish]] [[Civil and political rights|civil rights lawyer]] in [[Indianola, Mississippi]], is bombed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]], killing Kramer's five-year-old twin sons and leading to the amputation of Kramer's legs and his later suicide. Klansman Sam Cayhall is tried for murder in the bombing, and is eventually convicted and [[capital punishment in the United States|sentenced to die]] in the [[gas chamber]] at the [[Mississippi State Penitentiary]].  \n\nTwenty-nine years later, Adam Hall, a young attorney at the [[Chicago]] [[law firm]] of Kravitz and Bane, seeks assignment to the firm's [[pro bono]] representation of Cayhall in the last weeks before his scheduled execution. Adam is Cayhall's grandson, his family having since moved away from [[Southern United States|the South]] and changed their name, haunted and shamed by Cayhall's actions. Adam is motivated to take the case in a search for some understanding of the dark secrets of his family, which prompted the suicide of Adam's father the year Sam was sentenced to death and whose body Adam found as a child.\n\nAdam is sent by the firm to [[Jackson, Mississippi]] to take over the case and there reconnects with his aunt Lee Bowen, an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] [[socialite]] who has managed to avoid public association with her infamous father, and who warns Adam about the dangers of dredging up the past. On [[death row]], Sam remains a brusque, bitter, unrepentant racist who brags about his participation in the Klan bombing campaign of which the Kramer bombing was a part, though he denies that any of the bombings were intended to kill. He taunts Adam for his youth, legal inexperience, anti-racism, and the suicide of his father, but he agrees to allow Adam to represent him, though he forbids Adam from seeking [[pardon|clemency]] from Mississippi Governor McAllister, who had prosecuted Sam in his last retrial and had campaigned on that prosecution in his election to Governor. Nevertheless, as he begins to argue the case, Adam is approached by the Governor through an aide, Nora Stark, who suggests that he might consider clemency if Sam provides information about unidentified co-conspirators to the bombing.\n\nAs Adam investigates, inconsistencies in the facts of the original case come to light, casting doubt on Sam's intent to kill and suggesting that he lacked the ability to make the bomb himself, and both Stark and the original [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who investigated the case indicate that the bombing may have been the result of a broader conspiracy involving the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]] and [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Councils]], which were active at the time of the bombing in opposition to civil rights. \n\nSam refuses to authorize Adam to seek access to the Sovereignty Commission's files, sealed by order of the [[Mississippi Legislature|state legislature]], fearing it would expose Sam's former associates in the Klan, as well allowing the Governor to obtain useful information on political enemies, which he indicates is the Governor's real reason for seeking Sam's cooperation in unsealing the files.\n\nAdam continues to work through the courts, filing and arguing motions for a [[stay of execution]], including on the grounds that Sam was [[insanity defense|legally insane and unable to tell right from wrong]], due to his indoctrination into the Ku Klux Klan. At the same time, Lee, faced with the unearthed ghosts of the family history and having lapsed back into full-blown alcoholism, reveals to Adam that in the early 1950s, as children, she and Adam's father had witnessed their father murder the family's African-American neighbor Joe Lincoln during a fight that had started because Adam's father, Eddie, had wrongly accused Lincoln's son of stealing a toy soldier. Eddie had blamed himself for the murder, as well as Lee, for failing to stop Sam, the guilt of which was a factor in Eddie's later suicide and Lee's alcoholism. Lee also reveals how their father had been indoctrinated into the Klan as a child, showing Adam a historic photograph of Sam as a young boy attending a Klan [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] which Adam uses in his arguments before the courts.\n\nAdam and Nora secretly gain access to the Sovereignty Commission's sealed files, which prove a wider conspiracy to the bombing, and also indicate the participation of an accomplice.  The former FBI agent resurfaces, and reveals to Adam that the FBI had identified the accomplice, Rollie Wedge, whom the FBI had never been able to prove responsible, but who has reunited with other Klan members to commemorate the bombing on the eve of the pending execution. \n\nAdam goes to a Klan reunion but is beaten by several members and threatened at gunpoint by Wedge. Adam's persistence, the revelation of how much Sam's hatred had destroyed his family, and his impending execution begin to affect Sam, and he softens, reconciling with Lee and expressing remorse for his actions and the effect they have had on his family. Sam forcefully rejects the Klan when Wedge visits him in prison to encourage him to remain silent, and it is revealed that Wedge was the one who had built the bomb and set it deliberately to detonate.  \n\nUltimately, Adam's motions for a stay are denied by the courts, including the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. Despite Sam's finally authorizing the release of relevant Sovereignty Commission files, the Governor refuses to grant clemency, betraying him and Adam, while nonetheless using the files as political leverage as Sam had predicted. Wedge, identified in the files, is finally arrested.  \n\nUltimately, Sam is executed in the gas chamber, though Adam remains a confidant and advocate for his grandfather up until his execution, and he and Lee embrace at the end, in the hope that maybe the ghosts of the past are gone.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Adam Hall \n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Sam Cayhall \n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Lee Cayhall Bowen \n* [[Robert Prosky]] as E.
