Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, who is accused of being a [[Russia]]n [[sleeper agent]] and goes on the run to try to clear her name.\n\nOriginally written with a male protagonist, with [[Tom Cruise]] initially secured for the lead, the script was ultimately rewritten by [[Brian Helgeland]] for Jolie. Filming took place on location in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[New York City]], and [[Albany, New York]], between March and June 2009, with reshoots in January 2010. Action scenes were primarily performed with practical stunts, [[computer-generated imagery]] being used mostly for creating digital environments.\n\nThe film had a panel at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] on July 22 and was released in North America on July 23, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on August 18, 2010. ''Salt'' grossed $294 million at the worldwide box office and received generally positive reviews, with praise for the action scenes and Jolie's performance, but drawing criticism on the writing, with reviewers finding the plot implausible and convoluted. The DVD and Blu-ray disc were released December 21, 2010, and featured two alternate cuts providing [[alternate ending|different endings]] for the film.\n\n''Salt'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound Mixing]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nEvelyn Salt is in prison in [[North Korea]], suspected of being a U.S. spy. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) arranges a prisoner exchange to stifle the publicity her boyfriend, [[Arachnology|arachnologist]] Mike Krause, is bringing to her case. Mike proposes marriage despite her admission that she is a CIA operative.\n\nTwo years later, Salt interrogates Russian defector Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov, with CIA colleague Ted Winter and CIA counterintelligence officer Darryl Peabody observing. Orlov claims that on \"Day X\", Russian sleeper agents known as \"KAs\" will destroy the [[United States of America]], and that Agent \"KA-12\" will assassinate [[President of Russia|Russian President]] Boris Matveyev at the impending funeral of the [[Vice President of the United States|American Vice President]]. He says KA-12's name is Evelyn Salt. Peabody orders Salt be detained, while Orlov kills two agents and escapes. Salt also escapes and tries to phone her husband Mike while traveling to her home and evading the chasing CIA and police. Mike has been kidnapped. Salt gathers supplies including weapons and a spider in a jar.\n\nSalt shoots Matveyev at the Vice President's funeral and surrenders to Peabody instead of taking the opportunity to kill him. Matveyev is pronounced dead. Salt escapes to a barge where Orlov is waiting with other sleeper agents. In [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] Salt recalls her childhood in the [[Soviet Union]], being trained with other children and assuming the identity of the real Evelyn Salt, an American girl who died with her parents in a car crash in the Soviet Union. Orlov tests Salt by reuniting her with Mike only to immediately have him killed in front of her. Her lack of reaction convinces Orlov and he says she and another KA will assassinate the American president Howard Lewis. Salt kills Orlov and the other agents and leaves to meet with the KA Shnaider in his cover as a [[Army of the Czech Republic|Czech]] [[NATO]] liaison officer. Disguised as Shnaider's male attache she accompanies him into the [[White House]], where Shnaider launches a suicide attack driving the President into a secure underground bunker, accompanied by Winter and other agents. Salt manages to enter the outer bunker before it is sealed.\n\nRussia mobilizes its nuclear arsenal in response to President Matveyev's assassination. U.S. President Lewis orders preparations for retaliation. Upon realizing Salt has entered the outer bunker, Winter kills everyone in the inner bunker except the President, revealing himself to be KA Nikolai Tarkovsky. Incapacitating the President, Tarkovsky begins targeting missiles at [[Mecca]] and [[Tehran]] to incite a billion Muslims against the United States. Salt professes admiration and nearly persuades him to let her join him in the inner bunker, when a broadcast reports that President Matveyev is alive, his vital signs having been merely suppressed by spider venom. Tarkovsky realises Salt is not on his side, and reveals that she is to be the [[Fall guy|patsy]] for the nuclear attacks. Salt breaks into the bunker and, after a fight, aborts the missile launch. Reinforcements arrive and Salt is arrested as Tarkovsky identifies himself as CIA.\n\nAs Salt is being led out in chains, Tarkovsky grabs a pair of scissors. As Salt is led past him she throws her chain around his neck and jumps over the railing, killing him. Alone with Peabody in a helicopter, Salt explains her actions to him, promising to hunt down the remaining KA agents if freed, pointing out that Matveyev is alive and that she hadn't shot Peabody earlier. Salt's fingerprints are found on the barge, convincing Peabody who allows her to jump from the helicopter into the [[Potomac River]].\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, \"The plot section describes the events of the original general release.

In a November 2002 interview, he discussed on which scripts he was working. He stated, \"I have several scripts \u2013 foremost of which is one called ''The Far-Reaching Philosophy of Edwin A. Salt'' \u2013 kind of a high-action spy thriller...\"<ref name=\"chud\"/> In another interview, Wimmer described the project as \"very much about me and my wife\".<ref name=\"10 questions\"/> The plot incorporated many elements from ''Equilibrium'', with an oppressive and [[paranoid]] political system of [[brainwashing]] that gets overthrown by one of its high-ranking members, who rebels due to an emotional transformation.<ref name=\"EquilibriumSaltSimilarity\"/> With the shortened title ''Edwin A. Salt'', the script was sold to [[Columbia Pictures]] in January 2007.<ref name=\"AllBusiness\"/> By July 2007, the script had attracted the attention of Tom Cruise.<ref name=\"Variety2007\"/>\n\n[[Terry George]] was the first director to join the project, and he also did some revisions to the script, but he soon left the project. [[Peter Berg]] was the next director to consider, but he, too, eventually dropped out for undisclosed reasons.<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"EW\" /> A year later, [[Phillip Noyce]] was confirmed to direct.<ref name=\"variety-noyce\"/> Noyce was attracted to ''Salt'' for its espionage themes, which are present in most of his filmography,<ref name=\"kcrw\"/> as well as the tension of a character who tries to prove his innocence, yet also does what he was previously accused of.<ref name=\"comm\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Liev Schreiber 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Schreiber was chosen for his \"hidden emotionality\" and his performance in ''[[Defiance (2008 film)|Defiance]]''.<ref name=\"comm\"/>|alt=Liev Schreiber'']]\nInitial discussions took place in 2008 between Tom Cruise and Noyce about Cruise playing Edwin A. Salt. These discussions were going on for more than a year between the pair and their representatives. Cruise decided he was unable to commit to the script because he feared that the character was too close to his ''[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]'' character [[Ethan Hunt]].<ref name=\"director interview\" /> Cruise decided to work on ''[[Knight and Day]]'', instead. The filmmakers tried to differentiate the character from Hunt, but eventually came to accept they were too similar and decided not to change the characteristics of Salt. Noyce said, \"But, you know, he had a valid point. It was kind of returning to an offshoot of a character that he'd already played. It's like playing the brother, or the cousin, of somebody that you played in another movie.\"<ref name=\"director interview\" />\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] executive [[Amy Pascal]] suggested [[Angelina Jolie]] to Noyce, who had often spoken to Jolie in the past about a desire to create a female [[spy film|spy franchise]].<ref name=\"director interview\" /> Pascal even invited Jolie for a [[Bond girl]] role, but the actress replied that she was more interested in playing [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] herself, instead.<ref name=notes/> Jolie was sent ''Salt''{{'}}s script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] went to visit Jolie at her home in [[France]] to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer [[Brian Helgeland]] helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.<ref name=\"director interview\" />\n\nOne of Jolie's requests was to rework the third act, which originally had Salt rescue his wife and son from a coalition of villains because she did not believe a mother would neglect her child in this kind of situation. Wimmer decided then to make Salt more crucial to the villain's schemes, and add a sequence where Salt breaks into \"a place harder than [[Fort Knox]]\" \u2013 after considering [[Camp David]], Wimmer settled on the White House.<ref name=comm/> When asked if the script written for Cruise was the same for Jolie, he said, \"I think that it's just been a continual process, obviously accelerating by changing the central character, but the ideas, the locomotive of ideas that drive the film, are the same. An undercover CIA operative is accused of being a Russian [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], and has to go on the run to defend himself. That's been the same since day one. The tone of the film has changed in this evolution. In the same way, I guess, as \u2013 you know \u2013 action thrillers have changed along the lines of the [[James Bond (film series)|Bond film]]s and the [[Bourne (film series)|Bourne film]]s\".<ref name=\"director interview\" /><ref name=\"variety-jolie\" />\n\nOn February 19, 2009, Liev Schreiber was reported to play the role of Ted Winter, Evelyn Salt's friend and colleague in the CIA.<ref name=\"Liev\" /> Three days later, Chiwetel Ejiofor was named as CIA Officer Peabody, who is in pursuit of Salt.<ref name=\"variety2\" /> Noyce said Ejiofor, whom he first saw in ''[[Dirty Pretty Things (film)|Dirty Pretty Things]]'', seemed to have the \"intelligence and disarming sort of obsessiveness\" that a [[counter-intelligence]] officer would need.<ref name=\"comm\"/> [[August Diehl]], who played Salt's husband Mike Krause, came after a recommendation from Jolie's partner [[Brad Pitt]], who had worked with Diehl in ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', and [[Daniel Olbrychski]] was chosen for Orlov because [[Andrei Konchalovsky]] told Noyce that such an evil Russian character could only be played by a Polish actor.<ref name=\"comm\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nOn a budget of $130 million,{{Explanatory footnote|The film cost about $130 million to produce, and Sony said the final cost after tax credits was less than $110 million.<ref name=\"budget\" />}} [[principal photography]] took place mostly on location in New York City and Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"budget\" /><ref name=\"first look\" /> from March to June 2009.<ref name=\"about\" /><ref name=\"filming\" /><ref name=\"access\" /> Noyce decided to avoid \"typical postcard views of Washington, D.C.\" to reflect \"the more day-to-day environment of massive federal buildings inhabited by the typical bureaucrat\".<ref name=notes/> The opening sequence in North Korea was shot at the [[Floyd Bennett Field]], with an extra who had experience with [[prisoner exchange]]s acting as a consultant. Salt's rendezvous with Orlov was shot on the ''Frying Pan'', a former lighthouse ship, now moored in the Hudson River, at 26th Street in New York. The outside of the KA training facility was the [[Makaryev Monastery]] in Russia,<ref name=\"comm\"/> while the interior was the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[List of cathedrals in New York|Cathedral of the Holy Virgin Protection]] in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], where the funeral was also shot.<ref name=\"notes\" /> Filming for a chase sequence took place on Water Street in [[Albany, New York]], near the [[Interstate 787]] ramp, between April and May.<ref name=\"wten\"/> Studio production took place at [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]].<ref name=\"Grumanstudios\"/><ref name=\"libn\"/> While the film was in postproduction, di Bonaventura became dissatisfied with some scenes.<ref name=nypost/> [[Steven Zaillian]] was brought for uncredited rewrites;<ref name=\"Variety2010\"/> reshoots, mostly of action scenes, were held in New York during January 2010.<ref name=\"nypost\"/> Filming also took place on 157th St and Riverside Drive in the upper Manhattan neighborhood of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. Some scenes were also filmed outside of Manhattan, including [[the Bronx]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]], and in [[Westchester County]].\n\nAfter Jolie had just given birth to twins,<ref name=ultimate/> she spent time training before filming to get fit to perform almost all of the stunts herself. Bonaventura said, \"She is so prepared and so ready and gung-ho, she'll do any stunt. We had her jumping out of helicopters, shooting, jumping off of all sorts of things and infiltrating places that are impossible to infiltrate\".<ref name=\"LAtimes1\"/> Salt's fighting style was described as a mixture of [[Muay Thai]], [[Shaolin Kung-Fu]], and [[Jeet Kune Do]], which was considered by the stunt team the most suitable for Jolie's physique, and [[Krav Maga]], for its rawness and aggressiveness. Noyce wanted to film the scene where Salt hangs from the edge of the building in a studio with [[chroma key]], but Jolie insisted on doing it herself in the actual location.<ref name=ultimate/> On May 29, 2009, filming was temporarily halted after Jolie suffered a minor head injury while filming an action scene. She was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure and released on the same day with no serious injuries, allowing filming to resume.<ref name=\"injury\"/> Salt's escape after being captured in St. Bartholomew's originally involved her jumping off a building into a window-cleaning machine, but budgetary constraints caused the scene to be changed into a car chase.<ref name=comm/>\n\nComputer-generated imagery (CGI) was used extensively throughout the film to create environments and elements, such as bullet holes and flames. More dangerous objects such as a [[taser]] or the handcuffs used to strangle Winter were also made from CGI. Five companies were responsible for [[visual effects]]. The two most involved were [[Rainmaker Digital Effects|CIS Vancouver]] and [[Framestore]]. CIS Vancouver recreated the White House since the crew did not have permission to shoot in the building, and made a digital elevator shaft for the scene where Salt goes down into the White House bunker. Framestore was responsible for the assassination attempt on the Russian president, which combined actual shots of St. Bartholomew's Church, a digital recreation of the church's interior, and scenes with actor Olek Krupa falling down a collapsing floor.<ref name=\"awn\"/><ref name=\"Grasmere\"/>\n\nFemale CIA officers were consulted about the creation of disguises, leading to the scene where Salt undergoes subtle changes to disguise herself as a Czech. The \"sweet and caring\" blonde Salt dyeing her hair black would represent the shift to Chenkov, the menacing Russian agent. For the scene where Salt disguises herself as a major, pictures of Angelina Jolie were treated on [[Adobe Photoshop]] to create a believable male version, with the resulting image being used by the make-up team as an inspiration for the [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetics]].<ref name=\"Spy Disguise\"/>\n\n===Versions===\nDirector Phillip Noyce has said that, due to the extensive usage of flashbacks, \"there was always going to be a mountain of alternative material that would not fit into the theatrical version\".<ref name=\"moviehole\" /> The film ended up having two extra versions, the director's cut, and the extended cut \u2013 which Noyce refers to in his [[audio commentary]] as the film's original cut \u2013 both included on the [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] disc deluxe editions.<ref name=\"igndvd\" />\n\nThe director's cut was described by Noyce as \"my own personal take on the material, free from the politics and restrictions of producers, studio, or censorship ratings\".<ref name=\"moviehole\" /> Four minutes of film were added, leading to a running time of 104 minutes.<ref name=\"igndvd\" /> More flashbacks were added, and the violence was amped up, for example, Mike being drowned rather than shot to death.<ref name=\"latimes2\" /> The ending is also different; in the bunker scene, Winter shoots the President instead of only knocking him unconscious,<ref name=\"comm\" /><ref name=\"moviehole\" /> and a media report during the final scene reports that the new US president had been orphaned on a family visit to Russia, implying he is also a sleeper agent.<ref name=\"PopWrap\" /> Noyce has described this ending as \"an ending yet just a beginning \u2013 and it's an ending that turns the whole story on its head.\"<ref name=\"latimes2\" />\n\nThe extended cut increases the running time by only one minute, but rewrites the plot by removing, rearranging, and adding scenes.<ref name=\"igndvd\" /> The ending has Salt escaping from CIA custody and going to Russia, where she kills Orlov \u2013 his death scene at the barge does not appear in this cut, along with the child-spy training facility getting blown up at the end of the cut.<ref name=\"PopWrap\" />\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Anchor|Music|Score}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Salt: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Film score\n| artist     = [[James Newton Howard]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2010|6|20}} ([[iTunes]])<br />{{Start date|2010|08|11}} ([[Compact Disc|CD]])\n| recorded   = 2010\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Contemporary classical music|Contemporary classical]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=59|s=10}}\n| label      = [[Madison Gate Records]]\n| producer   = James Newton Howard\n| prev_title = [[The Last Airbender (soundtrack)|The Last Airbender]]\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n'''''Salt: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' was released on July 20, 2010 on [[iTunes]]<ref name=\"soundtrack\"/> and on August 11, 2010 as an on-demand [[CD-R]] from [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]].

Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner cartoon]].\"<ref name=\"Chicago Sun-Times\" />\n\n[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine reviewer Richard Corliss praised the action scenes and Noyce's persistence in keeping a serious tone \u2013 \"he ignores the story's preposterous elements and lets the audience decide whether to laugh, shudder, or both\".<ref name=\"time\" /> [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'']]'s William Thomas praised Jolie's performance, remarking, \"when it comes to selling incredible, crazy, death-defying antics, Jolie has few peers in the action business\",<ref name=\"empire\"/> and ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s [[Karina Longworth]] considered that original star Tom Cruise would never express the protagonist's ambiguity as well as Jolie.<ref name=\"vv\" />\n\nAmong negative responses, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s David Denby said ''Salt'' \"is as impersonal an action thriller as we've seen in years\", finding the supporting cast underexplored \u2013 \"the tricky plot locks them into purely functional responses\".<ref name=\"NewYorkerReview\"/> Claudia Puig of the ''[[USA Today]]'' considered the film a \"by-the-book thriller\" with Jolie's performance as the only distinguishing feature.<ref name=puig/> Lawrence Toppman of ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'' described the film as absurd, overplotted, and incoherent, and said the villainous schemes \"would have been called off 20 years ago at the latest when the Soviet Union dissolved\".<ref name=\"CharlotteReview\"/> Steven Rea of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' described ''Salt'' as \"commendably swift and progressively inane\", saying the script was a \"sloppy concoction of story elements from '70s espionage classics\" that ended up not working right with its \"nonsensical setups and wildly illogical twists\".<ref name=\"PhillyReview\"/> [[James Berardinelli]] of Reelviews considered that, while the film was fast-paced and the action scenes competently shot, the plot was predictable and \"the spy aspects, which are, by far, the most intriguing elements of the movie, are shunted aside in favor of spectacular stunts and long chases\".<ref name=\"ReelReview\"/>\n\n===Awards===\n''Salt'' received one [[Academy Award]] nomination, for [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound Mixing]] ([[Jeffrey J.
