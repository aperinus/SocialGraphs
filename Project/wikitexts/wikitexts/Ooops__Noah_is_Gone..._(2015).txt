Noah Is Gone...''''' (also known as '''''All Creatures Big and Small''''' in the United States and '''''Two by Two''''' in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is a 2015 [[3D film|3D]] [[computer-animated]] [[Adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film]] directed by Toby Genkel and co-directed by Sean McCormack based on an idea by Ralph Christians about what happened to the creatures that missed [[Noah's Ark]].\n\nA [[sequel]], ''[[Ooops! 2: The Adventure Continues...]]'' (alternative title ''Two by Two: Overboard!''), was released on July 21, 2022.{{citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in the [[Genesis flood narrative]], Dave is a Nestrian, a brightly coloured [[aardvark]]-themed creature whose only skills seems to be making comfortable nests and secreting a foul-smelling cloud of blue gas whenever he gets emotional. Dave is constantly moving around searching for a place to stay, a real home, much to the despair of Finny, his son, who only wants to make friends. After hearing a rumor of a colossal wave that is said to cover the whole world, Dave packs up again and takes Finny to a giant gathering of animals where their only salvation awaits: a huge [[Noah's Ark|ark]], big enough to fit in all the animals of the world, and built by a very nice [[human]] named [[Noah]]. But the Lion who is the captain rejects the Nestrians due to Dave's eccentricities and blue smoke and is turned away as they are not on the Lion's list. The Lion manages all animal affairs on the ark and is the captain. \nWith the use of some creative thinking, some Nestrian craftsmanship, and the involuntary help of the carnivorous Grymps, Hazel and her daughter Leah, they manage to sneak on the ark after all.\n\nJust when the day seemed to have been saved, Dave and Hazel realize that Finny and Leah have disappeared. Their curiosity having gotten the better of them, they were on the scaffolding as the tidal wave hit the boat and it sailed away. The parents panic as the ark sails away, leaving their children stranded on the last bit of land not yet engulfed by the water.\n\nTheir desperate race against time begins. Leah, who is a born hunter and survivor is burdened with the clumsy and awkward Finny. Somehow, they manage to escape from the rising water, but a pair of greedy and gruesome [[megabat]]-themed creatures called Griffins. Eventually, they add two more odd creatures who were also rejected from the ark to their ranks they meet Obesey the [[Bowhead whale|whale]] and his parasite companion Stayput. Finding his footing, surrounded by his new group of friends, Finny starts to emerge as the brave hero that he really is.\n\nMeanwhile, their parents must get over their differences to work together, fight their way through [[gorilla]] guards and the egotistical Lion to take control of the ark and save their children.\n\nHaving had many adventures, the \"fearless four\" manage to fight the continuing attacks of two griffins who see Leah and Finny as their dinner. Eventually, the griffins and Obesey fall into the rising water along with Stayput. As the water reaches the top of the mountain where Leah and Finny are, the parents manage to take control of the ship and steer it to the mountaintop. Leah and Finny manage to climb on a piece of floating ice when the water engulfs the mountain.\n\nWhen the ark passes their little iceberg, it turns out to be hard to climb on. Finny first manages to climb on the ark, but he does not want to leave Leah behind and jumps back on the iceberg. Then Leah jumps on board of the ark and uses her sharp claws to hold on. Finny tries to get back on the ark too, but falls in the water, seemingly unconscious or dying. When Dave tries to save Finny from drowning in the water, the plot twist is revealed: Nestrians are really amphibious creatures, perfectly able to breathe and swim while submerged. This also explains why Dave was never feeling at home. As the griffins try to eat Leah, Obesey later appears and eats them.\n\nIn the final scenes, Dave and Finny swim alongside the ark, waving at Leah and Hazel. On the deck of the ark, the Lion Captain and his flamingo assistant discuss whether they should have told Dave and Finny in the beginning they were sea creatures.\n\nIn the credits, the Ark stops at the [[Mount Ararat]] and when all the animals leave the Ark, and the Dave and Finny discover Nestrians in the sea. It also includes Finny and Dave teaching Leah and Hazel how to swim and they with Stayput and Obesey while the griffins play cards near a stack of fish inside Obesey's stomach.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Callum Maloney]] as Finny Nestrian\n* [[Ava Connolly]] as Leah Grymp\n* [[Dermot Magennis]] as Dave Nestrian (Finny\u2019s dad), Mr Griffin and Prairie Dog\n* [[Tara Flynn]] as Hazel Grymp (Leah's mom)\n* [[Paul Tylak]] as Obesey and Stayput\n* [[Aileen Mythen]] as Mrs. Griffin, Flamingo, Mrs. Guard and Margaret\n* [[Alan Stanford]] as Lion\n* [[Patrick FitzSymones]] as Tanglefoot, Mr. Guard and Siberian Tiger\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box Office ===\nThe film has grossed {{CNY|10.8 million}} at the Chinese box office.<ref name=\"cbooo\">{{cite web|url= http://cbooo.cn/m/636667|title= \u8bfa\u4e9a\u65b9\u821f\u6f02\u6d41\u8bb0\uff082016\uff09|access-date= August 17, 2016|work= cbooo.cn|language= zh|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190426094640/http://cbooo.cn/m/636667|archive-date= April 26, 2019|url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe film has a 36% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 4.5/10, making the reception of the film on the website negative.
