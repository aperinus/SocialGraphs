It is a remake of the 1981 [[Arthur (1981 film)|film of the same name]] written and directed by [[Steve Gordon (director)|Steve Gordon]]. Its story follows Arthur, a wealthy and alcoholic philanderer who, after a drunken run in with the law, is forced by his mother to marry Susan, a suitable spouse, or else he will be stripped of his inheritance, but things suddenly become complicated once he meets and falls in love with a free-spirited woman named Naomi. It stars [[Russell Brand]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Jennifer Garner]], [[Greta Gerwig]], and [[Nick Nolte]].\n\nThe film was produced and distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and was released on April 8, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|title=April 2011 Movie Releases|url=https://www.moviefone.com/movies/2011/april/|access-date=2020-08-26|website=www.moviefone.com|language=en}}</ref> It grossed $12.2 million during its opening weekend and $48.1 million worldwide, against a budget of $40 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Arthur|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2638382593/|access-date=2020-08-26|website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> It received generally negative reviews and has {{a or an|{{RT data|score}}}} rating based on {{RT data|count}} votes on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Alcoholism|Boozy]] Arthur Bach and his chauffeur, Bitterman, dress up in [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] costumes for a formal dinner hosted by Arthur's mother, Vivienne. The dinner is intended to announce Arthur as the new chairman of her corporation, Bach Worldwide. Driving to the dinner in a [[Batmobile]], an intoxicated Arthur is chased by police, arrested and released the next day.\n\nVivienne forms a plan to have her shrewd assistant Susan Johnson marry Arthur to ensure stable leadership and help Arthur's reputation. Arthur initially refuses (citing that he and Susan have nothing in common for a loveless relationship), but is told that he will be cut off from his $950 million [[inheritance]] if he does not marry Susan. He reluctantly agrees, and eventually asks Susan's father, Burt Johnson, for permission to marry. Burt agrees, after forcing Arthur against a table saw and warning him not to embarrass Susan.\n\nIn the meantime Arthur has met and wooed Naomi Quinn, an illegal tour guide to whom he has become attracted because of her free-spirited nature. He arranges his wedding while sneaking around on dates with Naomi. Arthur's nanny, Lillian Hobson \u2013 who normally dislikes all of Arthur's choices in women \u2013 gets to know and likes Naomi. Arthur learns that Naomi would like to have her children's book about the [[Statue of Liberty]] published. He attempts to find employment and other options so that he will be able to keep seeing Naomi and not need the inheritance, but to no avail.\n\nHobson takes Arthur to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, where Arthur complains that it is depressing and makes him want to drink. He proclaims he is going to drink, unintentionally brags about his wealth, and turns to leave the meeting. Hobson stands up and takes the bullet, giving Arthur's humiliating introduction in his place. Arthur, touched, states that if only she would do his drinking for him as well, he would be set.\n\nArthur goes to see Naomi at her house and tells her the truth \u2013 that he is engaged to Susan. Naomi then tells him to leave. Back home, Arthur calls for Hobson, only for Bitterman to come and tell him that she is in bed with a headache. Later, Hobson goes to Naomi and asks her to give Arthur another chance, but she again falls ill and is taken to a hospital. Naomi calls Arthur to tell him what has happened. He comes to the hospital, meets Naomi and is about to make up with her, but Susan arrives and tells Naomi that Arthur has bought the company that is handling the publication of her book. Upset, Naomi leaves the hospital. Hobson comes home and Arthur takes care of her. The two begin to get along better. However, a few days later, Hobson dies in her sleep and Arthur reverts to alcohol to numb the pain of her death, losing Naomi, and being married to Susan.\n\nAt his wedding, Arthur gets drunk and finds Hobson's last letter to him in which she advises him to follow his heart. Arthur decides, during the vows, not to proceed with the marriage. Susan and her father become belligerent and begin punching him, which makes Vivienne realize that the ambitious and conniving Susan is only after her company. Vivienne stops the ruckus, but reminds Arthur of the agreed upon disinheritance if he pursues Naomi. Arthur strips nearly naked to emphasize that he wants no kind of dependency on his mother's money and runs to Naomi's apartment. He tells her that he just lost his mum (meaning Hobson, not Vivienne) but Naomi, still upset with him, says she can't replace Hobson and refuses any prospect of their getting back together.\n\nSix months later, Arthur is now sober. He has got back his inheritance because he is managing the company's charity, and his mother is proud of him for finally taking something seriously (possibly indicating his love for Naomi). He goes to a bookshop to buy Naomi's book \u2013 which she has dedicated to him \u2013 and sees an advertisement for a book-reading she will be giving at the [[New York Public Library]]. Arthur goes to the library and, this time, Naomi takes him back. The two leave the library and Bitterman drives them through New York in the Batmobile with the police following in pursuit.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Russell Brand]] as Arthur Bach \u2013 a childish man who is to marry Susan in order to get his $950 million inheritance, but ends up falling in love with Naomi.\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Lillian Hobson \u2013 Arthur's [[nanny]] who's like a mother to Arthur and has been looking after Arthur since he was a child due to Vivienne being too busy with the family business.\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Susan Johnson \u2013 the woman Arthur is supposed to marry in order to get his inheritance.\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Naomi Quinn \u2013 a free-spirited tour guide and Arthur's real love interest.
