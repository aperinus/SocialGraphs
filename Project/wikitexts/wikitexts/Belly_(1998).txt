After celebrating with the gang, Sincere returns home to his girlfriend Tionne ([[Tionne Watkins|Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins]]) and infant daughter Kenya.\n\nThe following morning, Tommy asks Sincere to help him sell a new form of [[heroin]]. Sincere, who has begun having second thoughts about his life of crime, reluctantly agrees. Tommy then visits Ox, a wealthy [[Jamaica]]n drug lord, who agrees to obtain the heroin on the condition that Tommy repay him with a favor at a later date.\n\nIn Mark's grandmother's basement, the gang convenes to discuss the nascent drug operation; one of Tommy's associates, Knowledge ([[Oliver \"Power\" Grant]]), will be involved in the operation. Knowledge tells Tommy over the phone that Black had been talking about robbing Sincere to get his larger share of the loot from the nightclub. Enraged, Tommy forces Black to strip naked in front of the others, firing warning shots with a handgun wildly into the floor to force him to strip naked or else the next shot would not be a warning shot.\n\nThe gang begins transporting heroin from Queens to [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], where they begin to overrun the local drug business. Big Head Rico ([[Tyrin Turner]]), an Omaha dealer, informs the police of their activities. The resulting raid at their stash-house ends with Mark's death and Knowledge's arrest. Knowledge angrily realizes that Tommy will not bail him out of jail, and calls Shameek, a.k.a. Father Sha ([[Method Man]]), to both infiltrate Rico's gang and kill Tommy. Shameek drinks shots that Rico spikes with some sort of powder and Shameek tells Rico that he was sent by Knowledge to look after Rico and his henchmen blowing his cover causing Rico to get up and inform his henchmen at a strip club, but is gunned down by Shameek when he tries to flee. Shameek is shot by the bartender and stumbles out of the club. He shoots at and evades the police.\n\nTommy travels to Jamaica and repays Ox by killing Sosa, the son of a local drug lord. Back home, Tommy's girlfriend Keisha ([[Taral Hicks]]) is arrested by police and later bailed out by Tionne. Tommy finds out about the raid and leaves town. Pelpa, a close friend of Sosa, finds out that Ox ordered the hit on Sosa. Pelpa sends a [[wikt:hit squad|hit squad]] to kill Ox in his home. Ox kills most of the hitmen before dying at the hands of a female assassin.\n\nSincere prepares to leave the drug trade and move his family to [[Africa]], planning to leave on [[New Year's Day]] 2000. Meanwhile, while laying low in Atlanta, Tommy instigates an argument between Wise and LaKid, two [[marijuana]] dealers, which ends with both men to drawing their guns and LaKid shooting Wise. After being arrested over the shooting, Tommy is coerced by a shadowy organization with unclear motives into [[assassination|assassinating]] a [[Muslims|Black Muslim]] leader, Rev. Saviour, ([[Benjamin Chavis]]) during a sermon on [[New Year's Eve]]. Tionne comes home and finds herself confronted by Shameek and his henchmen, who had already broken into the home in hopes of finding Sincere, but were unsuccessful, so they waited until someone came home and Tionne came home and Shameek and the henchmen attempt to interrogate and demand the whereabouts of Sincere and Tommy.\n\nWhile Sincere talks to a friend who is his barber ([[AZ (rapper)|AZ]]) outside a barbershop, Black shoots him in the leg as revenge for his earlier humiliation. Sincere and his barber kill Black and his accomplice in [[self-defense]] before fleeing the scene. On New Year's Eve, Tommy confronts Rev. Saviour before his scheduled speech and points his gun at him. Saviour convinces Tommy not to go through with his mission, even though this will put his life at risk.\n\nA tearful Tommy agrees, and the two men embrace. Shameek breaks into one of Tommy's homes, (but in this case the home is Tommy's main home) where Keisha is living, in the hopes of finding Tommy there. He interrogates and assaults Keisha, who manages to turn the tables and get a hold of Shameek's gun and shoots him in the face. Sincere, now in Africa with his family, reflects on recent events and is happy to start a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] \u2013 Tommy \"Buns\" Bundy\n*[[Nas]] \u2013 Sincere\n*[[Taral Hicks]] \u2013 Keisha\n*[[Tionne Watkins|Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins]] \u2013 Tionne\n*[[Method Man]] \u2013 Shameek aka Father Sha\n*[[Tyrin Turner]] \u2013 Big Head Rico\n*[[Hassan Johnson]] \u2013 Mark\n*[[Oliver \"Power\" Grant]] \u2013 Knowledge\n*[[Louie Rankin]] \u2013 Lennox aka Ox\n*Jay Black - Black\n*Stanley Drayton \u2013 Wise\n*James Parris \u2013 LaKid\n*[[Benjamin Chavis]] \u2013 Reverend Saviour\n*[[Sean Paul]] \u2013 Himself\n*[[Mr. Vegas]] - Himself\n*[[Vita (rapper)|Lavita \u201cVita\u201d Raynor]] \u2013 Kionna\n*[[Crucial Conflict]] - cameo appearance\n*[[Ghostface Killah]] \u2013 cameo appearance\n*[[AZ (rapper)|AZ]] \u2013 Born (Friend of Sincere)\n*[[Frank Vincent]] - Roger\n*Kurt Loder - Himself \n*Paula Ouch - Chiquita\n*William Burke - friend of Sincere\n\n==Production==\nWhile filming ''Belly'', the production was mired by frequent clashes between Williams and the producers, budget constraints, and cast members showing up drunk, high, or late.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web |url=http://king-mag.com/belly-oral-history/ |title=Belly Oral History |author=Malcolm, S. |work=King Magazine |date=August 13, 2008 |access-date=January 3, 2019}}</ref> Much of the $3 million budget was used up on the film's opening scene, which was filmed in the former [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]] nightclub in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"AV\">{{cite web |url=https://film.avclub.com/hype-williams-love-of-hip-hop-animates-the-hallucinato-1828368334 |title=Hype Williams' love of hip-hop animates the hallucinatory, underrated Belly |author=Purdom, Clayton |work=The A.V.
