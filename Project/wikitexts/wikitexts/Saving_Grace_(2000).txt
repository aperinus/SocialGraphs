The screenplay was written by Ferguson and Mark Crowdy. Set in [[Cornwall]], the film tells the story of a middle aged widow whose irresponsible husband left her in an enormous debt, forcing her to grow [[cannabis]] in her greenhouse along with her gardener Matthew to avoid losing her house. It was co-produced by [[Fine Line Features]], Homerun Productions, Portman Entertainment, Sky Pictures, and Wave Pictures and filmed in [[London]] and the villages of [[Boscastle]] and [[Port Isaac]] in [[Cornwall]]. Distributed by [[20th Century Fox]] in major territories, the film premiered at the 2000 [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it won Cole the [[Audience Award]] for World Cinema.<ref name=\"imdb\" />\n\nCritical reaction to ''Saving Grace'' was generally positive and it received favourable commercial notice for an [[independent film|independent]] [[British comedy]] [[film]], eventually grossing $26,330,482 worldwide, following its theatrical release in the United States.<ref name=\"tn\">{{cite web|title=''Saving Grace''|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCjyUWBIaFU&NR=1 |url-status=dead|access-date=2010-01-31}}</ref> The film received awards from the [[Norwegian International Film Festival]] and the [[Munich|Munich Film Festival]], also receiving a [[BAFTA Award]] nomination for Crowdy,<ref name=\"imdb\" /> and [[ALFS Award]], [[Golden Globe]] and [[Satellite Award]] nominations for Blethyn and her performance.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web |title= Awards for ''Saving Grace'' |work= IMDb.com |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0195234/awards |access-date= 2008-02-14 }}</ref> Following ''Saving Grace''{{'}}s release, two [[television film]] [[prequel]]s to the film were produced for [[Sky Cinema|Sky Movies]]: ''Doc Martin'' and ''Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie''. These were followed by the highly successful [[ITV Network|ITV]] spin off series called ''[[Doc Martin]]'', starring [[Martin Clunes]] in a rewritten role as Dr. Martin Ellingham, after appearing in the film as Bamford.\n\n==Plot==\nSoon after the funeral of her husband (who died 'suspiciously' \u2013 he 'jumped' out of a plane without a parachute), Cornish housewife Grace Trevethyn discovers that she has been left with his massive debts. Unless she can raise a large amount of money, she will lose both her home and all of her possessions. Her loyal gardener Matthew offers to continue working without pay if she were to care for his dying cannabis plants, so Grace agrees. The plants flourish under her care so, talking with Matthew she realises they could grow and produce lots of cannabis in a short time.\n\nWith no other options and a creditor calling her home, Grace agrees to transform her greenhouse for the project. Matthew's girlfriend Nicky disapproves of the plan, particularly as she has recently learned from the town doctor and friend Martin Bamford that she is pregnant. While the plants are growing Grace meets her dead husband's mistress, Honey, but sends her away after realizing that her husband was more sexual with Honey than with her. \nAs she's never tried it, Grace asks Matthew to hook her up. They sit on the edge of the sea and share a spliff.\n\nGrace eventually learns that Nicky is pregnant and decides to seek out a buyer on her own to protect Matthew. When this proves to be more difficult than she expected, she has Honey introduce her to a drug dealer, Vince, only for him to lack the capital to purchase such a large crop. He introduces her to French businessman Jacques Chevalier, who Grace manages to impress with her knowledge of fly fishing and French. After initial disruptions, Chevalier and Grace negotiate a deal for the cannabis, and Grace, Vince, and Dr Bamford (who, with Matthew, had followed Grace to London) head back home; Chevalier secretly instructs his bodyguard to take Vince and follow them to Grace's home.\n\nOnce home, Grace discovers that the [[Women's Institutes|Women's Institute]] is preparing to hold a luncheon in her garden, and that the creditors are coming to remove her furniture and possessions. Matthew reconciles with Nicky and to his joy, learns that she's pregnant. Together the two stall Vince and the bodyguard by telling the local Police Sergeant Alfred Mabely that they are poachers. Meanwhile some of the Women's Institute members consume cannabis in liquid form, thinking that it was actually tea.\n\nAs Grace and her friends try to dismantle the grow operation, chaos breaks loose as the police (called by Mabely on the purported poachers), Jacques's people, and the creditors all arrive at the house. Grace chooses to burn the cannabis so no one can have it. Unable to resist, Martin opens the doors to the greenhouse and sends out a cloud of cannabis smoke that envelops the crowd. Meanwhile in her home, Grace has discovered Jacques, who tells her that he only wanted his bodyguard to protect her, as he has fallen for her.\n\nSeveral months later the town's residents gather in the pub to watch a television special about Grace's seemingly overnight transition from an unknown widow to a millionaire after the success of her novel ''Joint Venture''.  The special also covers Grace's marriage to Chevalier, as well as the large riot at her house in which \"nobody could remember anything.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 175\n   | footer    = Top to bottom: [[Brenda Blethyn]] and [[Craig Ferguson]] star in the film as Grace Trevethyn and her gardener Matthew Stewart, respectively.\n   | image1    = Brenda Blethyn.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = \n   | image2    = Craig Ferguson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n   | alt2      = \n   | caption2  = \n}}\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Grace Trevethyn, a newly widowed middle-aged woman who is faced with the prospect of financial ruin and turns to growing cannabis under the tutelage of her gardener in order to save her family home.

After confronting her with the news, he decides to leave London and heads for Cornwall, which he remembers fondly from his youth. Shortly after he arrives, he gets involved in the mystery of the \"Jellymaker\" and, following the departure of the village's resident GP, decides to stay in Port Isaac and fill the gap himself.\n\nClunes' company tried selling a series on the same theme to [[ITV Network|ITV]] who liked it, but felt the character of Martin Bamford needed a stronger defining characteristic than just being a \"townie\" who is a little out of his depth in the country. ITV wanted the character to be more challenging, so the idea of the doctor being unusually ill-tempered was touted. Out of that idea a new series, also called ''[[Doc Martin]]'', was born. ''[[Doc Martin]]'' was created for ITV in 2004 by [[Dominic Minghella]]; in the ITV series, the main character's surname was changed from Bamford to Ellingham, a deliberate [[anagram]] of the Minghella family name.  The series became a huge success in the UK and internationally; the end titles state that the ''Doc Martin'' series' existence was \"Arising from the Film Saving Grace Created by Craig Ferguson & Mark Crowdy\".\n\n=== Musical adaptation ===\nIn January 2022, musician [[KT Tunstall]] revealed during an interview with BBC that she has written a stage musical adaptation of ''Saving Grace'' while in lockdown due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]''.''<ref>{{Cite web |date=18 January 2022 |title=KT Tunstall writes Saving Grace musical in lockdown |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-60037733 |access-date=16 March 2022 |website=[[BBC]]}}</ref> The following month, it was announced that the stage version has begun private readings, having been adapted by [[April De Angelis]] from Craig Ferguson and Mark Crowdy's screenplay, scored by Tunstall, produced by Barney Wragg, and directed by Laurence Connor.
