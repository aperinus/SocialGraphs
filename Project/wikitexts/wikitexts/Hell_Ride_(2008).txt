He has two faithful lieutenants, The Gent ([[Michael Madsen]]) and the young Comanche ([[Eric Balfour]]).\n\nIn 1976, Cherokee Kisum ([[Julia Jones]]), the girlfriend of Pistolero (then known as Johnny) is viciously murdered by The Deuce ([[David Carradine]]) and Billy Wings ([[Vinnie Jones]]), leaders of the arch-rival gang the Six-Six-Six'ers, as a message to the Victors. The Deuce later moves into large scale business efforts, leaving the biker life behind and the Sixers dry up as a gang.  Cherokee has also hidden away a small fortune from under-the-table drug deals she made behind the Deuce's back - another reason behind her murder.  The stash of money is intended for her young son, who disappears after her death.\n\nYears later, after The Deuce returns to the area to close up unfinished business and Billy Wings reforms the Sixers in Los Angeles, the rival gang infiltrates the Victors in an attempt to take over their territory. One member from 1976, St. Louie, is murdered in the same manner as Cherokee Kisum.  Bob the Bum, the Victors' treasurer, is similarly killed.  Pistolero then begins to make moves to eliminate the Sixers and finally gain his revenge. While loyal bikers are killed by the Sixers, the more treacherous and less faithful Victors try to influence The Gent, Comanche, and Goody Two-Shoes to switch sides - or kill them. Goody Two-Shoes is eventually killed after being located and chased down by Billy Wings.\n\nWith the aid of his beautiful & mysterious \"medicine woman\" Nada ([[Leonor Varela]]) and his old friend and ally Eddie Zero ([[Dennis Hopper]]), Pistolero and the remaining Victors try to locate and kill The Deuce, Billy Wings and the Sixers before they themselves are killed.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Larry Bishop]] as Johnny \"Pistolero\", The Victors M.C.\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as \"The Gent\", The Victors M.C. \n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Eddie \"Zero\" / Scratch, The Victors M.C.\n* [[Eric Balfour]] as Sonny \"Comanche\" Kisum / Bix, The Victors M.C.\n**Austin Galuppo as Young Sonny Kisum\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as Billy \"Wings\", The 666ers M.C.\n* [[Leonor Varela]] as Nada\n* [[Michael Beach]] as \"Goody Two-Shoes\", The Victors M.C.\n* [[Laura Cayouette]] as Dani\n* [[Julia Jones]] as \"Cherokee\" Kisum\n* [[Francesco Quinn]] as \"Machete\"\n* Cristos as \"Speed\"\n* [[Allison McAtee]] as \"The Swede\"\n* Cassandra Hepburn as Maria\n* [[David Carradine]] as \"The Deuce\", The 666ers M.C.\n* Pete Randall as Louie \"St. Louie\", The Victors M.C.\n* Dean Delray as \"Ape-Shit\", The Victors M.C.\n* Lee Alfred as \"Joint\", The Victors M.C.\n* [[David Grieco]] as \"Dr. Cement\", The Victors M.C.\n* [[Kanin Howell]] as \"Opium\"\n* Michael Macecsko as \"Shyster\"\n* Terry Fradet as \"Holy Smoke\"\n* Steve McCammon as Bob \"The Bum\"\n* Theresa Alexandria as Carmen\n* [[Andrea Fellers]] as \"Echo\"\n* Alyson Sullivan as Gigi\n* Tracy Phillips as Yvonne\n* [[Maja Mandzuka]] as Danka\n* Amber Hay as \"Flower\" (uncredited) \n* [[Claudia Salinas]] as Angelina (uncredited)\n* Natasha Yi as Jucinda (uncredited)\n* Diana Prince as Topless Waitress (uncredited)\n\n== Production notes ==\nLarry Bishop's character Pistolero is named after the original title for [[Robert Rodriguez]]\u2019s ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]].'' The dialogue spoken by the character Nada ([[Leonor Varela]]) is made up almost entirely of [[double entendre]]s and [[clich\u00e9]]s.\n\nBishop took extra duties on this film by not only starring in it, but also writing, directing and co-producing with producers Michael Steinberg and Shana Stein, and [[executive producer]] [[Quentin Tarantino]]. This film is Bishop's modern-day take on those [[Outlaw biker film|1960s motorcycle flicks]] he used to turn out for B-movie masters [[American International Pictures]]. It is the project Tarantino inspired Bishop to begin some five and a half years ago, when he told Bishop: \"It is your destiny to write, direct and star in a movie\". Tarantino also assured Bishop that he would help to produce his film.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Release ==\n''Hell Ride'' premiered at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name= \"sreview\" /><ref name= \"Grindhouse\">{{cite news |last=Silverman |first=Jason |url= https://www.wired.com/2008/01/grindhouse-part/ |title=Grindhouse, Part III, at Sundance |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=January 24, 2008 |access-date=August 15, 2021}}</ref> It had a brief theatrical run via [[Third Rail Releasing]] before being released to DVD worldwide.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0411475}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1192781-hell_ride}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111014044116/http://www.bikercinema.com/movies/hell-ride Hell Ride] at [https://web.archive.org/web/20111013150536/http://www.bikercinema.com/ Biker Cinema]\n* {{Allmovie title|391739}}\n* {{mojo title|hellride}}\n\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2008 action films]]\n[[Category:American action films]]\n[[Category:American nonlinear narrative films]]\n[[Category:Outlaw biker films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Dimension Films films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Larry Bishop]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
