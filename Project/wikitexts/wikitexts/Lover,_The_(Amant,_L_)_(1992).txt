Based on the semi-autobiographical [[The Lover (Duras novel)|1984 novel of the same name]] by [[Marguerite Duras]], the film details the illicit affair between a teenage French girl and a wealthy [[Chinese people|Chinese]] man in 1929 [[French Indochina]]. The protagonist is portrayed by actress [[Jane March]] and her lover is portrayed by actor [[Tony Leung Ka-fai]]. The film also features [[Jeanne Moreau]] as a narrator.\n\nDevelopment began in 1989, with principal photography commencing in 1991. The film made its theatrical debut on 22 January 1992 in France, on 19 June in the United Kingdom, and in the United States on 30 October of the same year. The film was nominated for the 1992 [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]] and won the [[Motion Picture Sound Editors]]' 1993 Golden Reel Award for \"Best Sound Editing&nbsp;\u2014 Foreign Feature\". It was nominated for seven [[C\u00e9sar Award]]s in France, winning the [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Original Music|Award for Best Original Music]]. The film was a box office success in France and received generally positive reviews in Europe, while reviews from American critics were more mixed.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe primary characters are known only as The Young Girl and The Chinese Man. The events take place in Vietnam. The daughter of a bitter, fearful, poverty-stricken French family, living in a rural area, the girl is a pretty waif who wears an old linen dress and a [[fedora]], and paints her lips bright red when out of her mother's sight. Her weak-willed, widowed mother is a schoolteacher to local children. There is a violent, opium-smoking older brother, and a timid younger brother. The girl is a loner but an excellent student, who dreams of being a writer.\n\nThe girl meets the Chinese Man when crossing the river on the ferry to return to the city after a school holiday. He is the son of a businessman whose fortune was made in real estate, and has recently returned from Paris after finishing his business studies. He has the look but lacks the self-assurance of the playboy he fancies himself to be, and he is mesmerized the first time he sees her standing by the rail on a crowded ferry crossing the [[Mekong River]]. After some awkward conversation, she accepts a lift to [[Saigon]] in his chauffeur-driven limousine. In voice-over at the beginning of the film she says she is 15, but she tells him she is 17; he is 32. During the drive he tremulously takes her hand; at the end, his hand is in her lap. The following day, he waits for her outside her boarding school and takes her to the room in the Chinese quarter that he uses for entertaining mistresses.\n\nThey realize that \"a future together is unthinkable\" because she is scheduled to return to Paris soon, and he is to make an arranged marriage with a Chinese heiress. Aware of the limited time they have together, they fall into a relationship in which they shed all responsibilities that come with commitment. Every day after school, the girl goes to his room.\n\nThe girl's family discovers the affair, and though at first furious, they condone it because the man is wealthy and can pay off some of their debts. Despite this added tension, the affair continues passionately. The man even goes so far as to beg his father for permission to be with her instead of entering into his arranged marriage, but his father would rather see him dead than with a white girl. Though devastated, the man marries his arranged bride, and the girl boards a ship days later to return to France.\n\nDecades later, she has become a successful writer. In the final scene, she tells us that the Chinese Man is visiting France and has telephoned her. He tells her that he has never stopped loving her, and never will.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jane March]] as The Young Girl\n* [[Tony Leung Ka-fai]] as The Chinese Man\n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Meininger as The Mother\n* [[Arnaud Giovaninetti]] as The Elder Brother\n* [[Melvil Poupaud]] as The Younger Brother\n* [[Lisa Faulkner]] as Helene Lagonelle\n* Xiem Mang as The Chinese Man's Father\n* Philippe Le Dem as The French Teacher\n* Ann Schaufuss as Anne-Marie Stretter\n* [[Jeanne Moreau]] as Narrator (voice)\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = The Lover: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type         = Film score\n| longtype     = ([[Music download|Digital download]])/Audio CD\n| artist       = [[Gabriel Yared]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = 10/13/92\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = \n| length       = 39:14\n| label        = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande Records]]\n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline     = Track listing\n| all_music    = [[Gabriel Yared]]\n| total_length = 39:14\n| title1       = A Kiss On The Window\n| length1      = 01:45\n| title2       = Blue Zoon\n| length2      = 02:46\n| title3       = One Day On The Mekong\n| length3      = 03:31\n| title4       = One Step Dance\n| length4      = 02:09\n| title5       = Promenade\n| length5      = 03:35\n| title6       = A Man From Cholon\n| length6      = 01:25\n| title7       = Helene\n| length7      = 02:37\n| title8       = Valse a L'Etage\n| length8      = 01:50\n| title9       = The Problems Of Life\n| length9      = 02:26\n| title10      = Foxtrot Dance\n| length10     = 02:27\n| title11      = The Lover \n| length11     = 03:11\n| title12      = Habanera \n| length12     = 01:48\n| title13      = The Barricades \n| length13     = 00:58\n| title14      = Nocturne\n| length14     = 03:51\n| title15      = La Marseillaise\n| length15     = 01:13 \n| title16      = The Departure\n| length16     = 03:42\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nDirector [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]] initially collaborated with [[Marguerite Duras]] on the adaptation of her book, but creative differences between the pair led to Annaud working with writer [[G\u00e9rard Brach]] instead.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |date=6 February 1992 |title=Jean-Jacques Annaud's 'The Lover' Gets Mixed Reviews |url=https://apnews.com/article/d6089d5c676c1f0aba44b13ca9dc58b7 |access-date=2022-04-13 |website=AP NEWS |language=en}}</ref> Annaud and Brach changed the age of \"The Girl\" from 15{{frac|1|2}} to 17 before deciding they would have her state in the beginning she is 15 while lying to her lover that she is 17, but tried to maintain the original structure and literary tone of the original novel.<ref name=\"New-York-Times\" /> As with the Duras novel, none of the characters use names and are referred to in the credits as \"The Girl\" and \"The Man\".<ref name=\"New-York-Times\" /> To find the actress who would play the girl, Annaud advertised in multiple cities in the United States and the United Kingdom and visited drama schools.
