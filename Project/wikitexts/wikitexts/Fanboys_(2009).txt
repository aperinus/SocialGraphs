Now a car salesman at his father's dealership, Bottler finds that his friends have not matured since high school, though they all still share a love of ''[[Star Wars]]''. The gang anticipates the latest film, ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]''. Linus proposes Bottler and he infiltrate [[Skywalker Ranch]] and steal a [[rough cut]] of the film, a childhood plan that Bottler dismisses.\n\nThe next day, Hutch and Windows meet Bottler at work and inform him that Linus is dying from cancer. The doctors estimate he has roughly four months to live; ''Episode I'' comes out in six. To make peace with his former best friend, Bottler decides to go through with their plan. On the way to meet Rogue Leader, Windows' online girlfriend, for information on getting into the Ranch, Hutch takes a detour to pick a fight with a [[Trekkie]], Admiral Seasholtz. When the boys' van breaks down, they stumble upon a gay biker bar. After refusing to pay for their drinks, they are forced to do a striptease. When this goes wrong, they are saved by a man named \"The Chief\", who fixes their van after they pass out from eating guacamole laced with [[peyote]]. He gives a bag of this to Linus as a parting gift.\n\nIn Texas, Windows is horrified to find Rogue Leader is a 10-year-old girl. Her uncle, [[Harry Knowles]], beats up Windows. After explaining their situation, Harry quizzes them to prove they are true fanboys, then gives them information on one of his contacts in [[Las Vegas]]. On their way there, they are arrested for fleeing from a police vehicle and for possession of peyote. Zoe arrives to bail them out and insists on accompanying them. Bottler is reluctant to continue when the judge relays an ultimatum from his father, but the others convince him of the importance of their quest. Once in Las Vegas, Hutch and Windows attempt to have sex with women while Bottler and Linus go to meet Harry's contact. They are shocked to find that his contact is [[William Shatner]]. As they leave, they are attacked by Seasholtz and his Trekkie friends, who were attending a ''[[Star Trek]]'' convention. Hutch and Windows flee an angry pimp after finding out that they were with [[Call girl|escort girls]], and Windows learns that Zoe is in love with him.\n\nThe group escapes their adversaries, but Linus is injured in the process. When taken to the hospital, a doctor says he must return home for the sake of his health. When the group feels the situation has become hopeless, Bottler inspires them to continue, reminding them how much ''Star Wars'' means to them. The group leaves the hospital and eventually arrive at Skywalker Ranch. Shortly after breaking into the ranch and marveling at the collection of original props and costumes, they are discovered by security guards and are caught after a brief chase. The Head of Security tells them of their impending doom when he receives a phone call from [[George Lucas]] himself. Lucas says he will drop all charges if they can prove to him that they are \"[[Fan (person)|fanboys]]\". The five are individually quizzed, including questions about the opposite sex that only Zoe can answer. After the Head of Security confirms they are fanboys, Lucas drops all charges. Being aware of Linus's illness, Lucas allows him to watch the film alone while his friends wait outside. After the film ends, Bottler joins his friends around a campfire and mends his friendship with Linus. Weeks later, Linus dies of his illness.\n\nBottler, Windows, and Zoe emerge from their tent while waiting in line for the premiere of ''Episode I''. Bottler has followed his and Linus's dream by becoming a comic book artist, Hutch has started his own [[Auto detailing|detailing business]], and Windows and Zoe are dating. Hutch arrives at the theater with beers he smuggled in, which they use to toast Linus's memory. Before the film starts, Bottler comments [[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace#Reception|\"What if the movie sucks?\"]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Windows\n* [[Dan Fogler]] as Harold \"Hutch\" Hutchinson\n* [[Sam Huntington]] as Eric Bottler\n* [[Chris Marquette]] as Linus\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Zoe\n* [[David Denman]] as Chaz\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Big Chuck\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as Judge Reinhold\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as The Chief\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as [[Harry Knowles]]\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Admiral Seasholtz / Alien / Roach\n* [[Isaac Kappy]] as Garfunkel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/05/15/thor-actor-isaac-kappy-dies-after-jumping-off-arizona-bridge/3687012002/|title='Thor' actor Isaac Kappy dies in Arizona at age 42|last=Khalaj|first=Gabriella|date=May 15, 2019|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=May 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThere are numerous [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] related to ''Star Wars'' and other science-fiction/cult-hit films including [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Jason Mewes]], [[Kevin Smith]], [[Jaime King]], [[Danny McBride]], [[Ray Park]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[Joe Lo Truglio]], [[Lou Taylor Pucci]], [[Will Forte]] and [[William Shatner]].
