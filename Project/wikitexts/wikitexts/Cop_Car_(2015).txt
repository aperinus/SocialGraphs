The film follows two young boys and [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]] who come across and hijack the abandoned [[police car]] of a corrupt sheriff. It premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]] and was released in the United States on August 7, 2015 by [[Focus Features|Focus World]]. The film received mainly positive reviews from critics but was commercially unsuccessful, earning $143,658 on a $5 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nCorrupt sheriff Kretzer removes his uniform's shirt and leaves his handgun in the back seat of his police car. He removes a body from his car's trunk, drags and drops it in a covered pit in the woods, and pours a bag of [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] on it. Meanwhile, two young runaways and  [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]], Travis and Harrison, come across Kretzer's cop car. Believing it to be abandoned, they hijack the vehicle and go on a [[Joyride (crime)|joyride]]. Upon finding his car gone, Kretzer calls his dispatcher Mary Allen to tell her that his radio is down so he should be contacted through phone. Meanwhile, the boys speed down the wrong lane, narrowly missing a woman driving in the oncoming lane.\n\nAt a trailer park, Kretzer steals a car, but, after avoiding arrest, he abandons it, replacing it with his own pickup truck when he arrives home. Allen informs him of a report of a stolen sheriff's car driven by two boys under age 10. He orders her to ignore the report and has her tell his deputies to switch their radios to a different channel, before he uses the regular channel to call the boys to no avail.\n\nTravis and Harrison are playing with Kretzer's weapons, but they hear thumping from the car's trunk and open it to see a bloodied man, restrained like the man Kretzer earlier disposed. He manages to convince the boys to free him after informing them about Kretzer being the \"bad guy.\" At home, Kretzer dumps bags of [[cocaine]] into his toilet and packs a bag of cash. He hears Harrison on his truck's radio and picks up the call, where Harrison claims to have kept the car safe and tells him their location.\n\nThe man from the trunk had betrayed the boys and forced Harrison at gunpoint to tell Kretzer their location so he can enact revenge. He and his brother, the dead body from earlier, were part of a drug deal with Kretzer gone wrong. Locking them in the car's backseat, he threatens the boys' families and warns them not to tell Kretzer where he is hiding before taking cover near a windmill. Kretzer arrives and sees the open front door of the cop car, and takes cover behind the car after sensing that something is amiss.\n\nThe woman whose car the boys almost hit earlier, Bev, shows up and walks towards the car, screaming at the boys. She sees Kretzer, who claims to be injured, and he asks her to look for his keys in the direction where he suspects the man is hiding. Bev spots the man from the trunk and gives away his location before she is shot and killed by the man, prompting a gunfight with him and Kretzer. Kretzer manages to kill the man but is severely wounded in the process.\n\nThe boys escape the car by shooting out the window, but Travis is hit by one of the ricochets from their escape attempt. Harrison takes the cop car and drives down to get help for Travis, but Kretzer recovers and follows them in his truck while taunting them through the radio. With night falling and not knowing how to turn on the vehicle's headlights, Harrison ignores Kretzer and continues to speed down the road. As Kretzer tries to run them off the road, Harrison sees a cow and avoids it, but Kretzer crashes into it. Harrison continues onward before finally seeing the town lights on the horizon. Allen attempts to contact Kretzer over the radio, which Harrison picks up as he speeds towards town.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Sheriff Kretzer\n* James Freedson-Jackson as Travis\n* Hays Wellford as Harrison\n* [[Camryn Manheim]] as Bev\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Man from the trunk\n* Sean Hartley as Motorcycle Cop\n* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as Dispatcher\n* Loi Nguyen as Waiter\n* Sit Lenh as Hostess\n* Chuck Kull as Officer #1\n* Thomas Coates as Officer #2\n* Kathleen Bentley as Trailer Park Lady\n* Justin Barr as Guy in Trailer Park\n* Adam Barr as Drunk at Intersection\n* Lily & Cooter Heber as Dogs\n* Bluebell as Herself\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 24, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/entertainment/2099355-155/sundance-red-carpet-photos-kevin-bacons|title=Sundance red carpet photos: Kevin Bacon's 'Cop Car' premieres in Park City at Midnight|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=August 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924122714/http://www.sltrib.com/entertainment/2099355-155/sundance-red-carpet-photos-kevin-bacons|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The film was released in theaters on August 7, 2015 by [[Focus Features|Focus World]], which acquired distribution rights to the film on January 28, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-focus-world-picks-up-767696|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=January 28, 2015|title=Sundance: Focus World Picks Up 'Cop Car' (Exclusive)|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/trailers/444325-the-trailer-for-cop-car-starring-kevin-bacon#/slide/1|title=The Trailer for Cop Car, Starring Kevin Bacon|website=ComingSoon.net|access-date=May 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''Cop Car'' received generally positive reviews from critics.
