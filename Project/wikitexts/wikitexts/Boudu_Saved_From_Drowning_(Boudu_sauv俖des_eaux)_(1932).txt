Renoir wrote the film's screenplay, from the 1919 play by [[Ren\u00e9 Fauchois]]. The film stars [[Michel Simon]] as Boudu.\n\n[[Pauline Kael]] called it, \"not only a lovely fable about a bourgeois attempt to reform an early hippie... but a photographic record of an earlier France.\"<ref>Kael, quoted in Richard Boston, ''Boudu'', BFI Film Classics p.41</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nBourgeois [[Paris]]ian and [[Latin Quarter]] bookseller Edouard Lestingois rescues a tramp, Boudu, from a suicidal plunge into the [[Seine|River Seine]], from the [[Pont des Arts]]. Boudu is brought into Lestingois's household. The family adopts the man and dedicates itself to reforming him into a proper middle class person. Boudu shows his gratitude by shaking the household to its foundations, challenging the hidebound manners of his hosts and seducing not only the housemaid but also raping Madame Lestingois herself. Gradually Boudu is tamed, shaved and given a haircut, and put in a suit. Then he wins a large sum of money on the lottery, and is guided into marrying the housemaid. Finally, however, at the wedding scene, Boudu capsizes a rowboat and floats away from the wedding party, and \"back to his old vagrancy, a free spirit once more.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Boston |title=Boudu Saved from Drowning |location=London |publisher=BFI (Film Classics series) |year=1994 |page=[https://archive.org/details/boudusavedfromdr00bost/page/10 10] |isbn=0-85170-467-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/boudusavedfromdr00bost/page/10 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michel Simon]] as [[Priapus|Priape]] Boudu\n* [[Charles Granval]] as Edouard Lestingois\n* [[Marcelle Hainia]] as Emma Lestingois\n* S\u00e9v\u00e9rine Lerczinska as Chloe Anne Marie, la bonne\n* [[Jean Gehret]] as Vigour\n* [[Max Dalban]] as Godin\n* [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] as L'etudiant\n* [[Jacques Becker]] as Poet on park bench\n\n==Notes==\nRenoir changed the ending of Ren\u00e9 Fauchois's play. The play ends with the marriage of Boudu and Anne-Marie, whereas in Renoir's film, Boudu escapes 'from holy padlock' and heads for ' a future of independent, vagrant liberty.' Initially angry, according to Renoir, Fauchois threatened to have his name removed from the credits, but later changed his mind, and (in ''Cin\u00e9ma'' 56, no.7, November 1955) said: \"I have just seen the film again and I admired it and am happy to say so. As a very free adaptation of my work, ''Boudu'' belongs to Renoir.\" (Fauchois's career started as an actor with the Sarah-Bernhardt company, and in 1925 when Michel Simon played Boudu on the stage Fauchois was Lestingois.) In narrative terms, another major change by Renoir from the play, consists in shifting the centre of attention from the character of Lestingois to that of Boudu.<ref>Boston, p. 25, 28</ref>\n\nMichel Simon was at various times, a boxer, a boxing instructor, a right-wing anarchist, a frequenter of prostitutes, pimps and petty crooks. He was extremely well read, a talented photographer, a hypochondriac, a misanthrope, owner of a vast collection of pornography and with a reputation for unorthodox sexual behaviour which he did not bother to deny. The writer Richard Boston has stated that, \"Whether or not he was a pleasant man, he was certainly a complex one, with a good deal of Boudu in him,\" and Renoir called Simon \"a genius of an actor...''Boudu'' was conceived primarily to make use of the genius of Michel Simon.\"<ref>Boston, p.36-37</ref>\n\nMichel Simon called Boudu a ''pique-assiette'', a sponger, while the writer [[Richard Boston]] rejected the idea that Boudu had much in common with the [[hippies]] of the late 1960s, as [[Pauline Kael]] had suggested. \"The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says that hippie is a hipster; a person usually exotically dressed; a [[beatnik]]. None of this sounds remotely like Boudu. Boudu doesn't reject conventional values: he never had them in the first place: you wouldn't catch him doing anything as pussy-footing as 'rejecting conventional values.' \" Rather, Boston argues, Boudu is what the French call a ''marginal''. Boudu is anarchic, chaotic, and finally, a fool. An [[archetype]], \"these agents of chaos act out our secret desires. If ''we'' see a big bum we might want to kick it: [[Charles Chaplin|Chaplin]] ''does'' kick it...[[Laurel and Hardy]], the [[Marx Brothers]], Boudu, and [[Monsieur Hulot|Hulot]] are the enemies of conformity, of what can be regulated. They are the awkward squad.\"<ref>Boston, p.46</ref>\n\n==Remake==\nThe film was remade for an American audience as ''[[Down and Out in Beverly Hills]]'' (1986), directed by [[Paul Mazursky]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/6789 |title=Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932) |publisher=[[AllMovie]] |access-date=18 June 2014 }}</ref> For another remake, ''[[Boudu]]'' (2005).
