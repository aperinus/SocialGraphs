It features an [[ensemble cast]], composed predominantly of British actors, many of whom had worked with Curtis in previous film and television projects. Mostly filmed on location in London, the screenplay delves into different aspects of love as shown through ten separate stories involving a wide variety of individuals, many of whom are shown to be interlinked as the tales progress. The story begins five weeks before Christmas and is played out in a weekly countdown until the holiday, followed by an [[epilogue]] that takes place one month later.\n\nAn international co-production between the United Kingdom, the United States and France,<ref name=bfi/> the film was released in the United States on 14 November 2003 and a week later in the United Kingdom, to generally mixed reviews. ''Love Actually'' was a box-office success, grossing $246 million worldwide on a budget of $40\u201345 million. It received a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]]. Frequently shown during the Christmas season, the film has proved more popular with audiences than critics, and it has been discussed as being arguably a modern-day Christmas staple.<ref>{{cite news |title=The best Christmas movies on Netflix UK |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/best-christmas-movies-netflix-uk/love-actually/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213102351/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/best-christmas-movies-netflix-uk/love-actually/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 December 2017 |access-date=24 February 2019 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref><ref name=\"Christmas\"/>\n\nA [[made-for-television]] [[short film]] sequel, ''[[Red Nose Day Actually]]'', aired in two different versions on [[BBC One]] and [[NBC]] in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nA voiceover ([[Hugh Grant]]) opens the film, commenting that whenever he gets gloomy about the state of the world he thinks of the arrivals gate at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]], about the pure uncomplicated love of friends and families welcoming their loved ones. He also points out that the messages from the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] victims were messages of love and not hate. The story then switches between the interconnecting 'love stories' of many people:\n\n===Billy Mack and Joe===\nWith his long-time manager Joe ([[Gregor Fisher]]), [[rock and roll]] legend Billy Mack ([[Bill Nighy]]) records a Christmas version of the [[The Troggs|Troggs]]' 1967 song \"[[Love Is All Around]]\", titling it \"Christmas Is All Around\". Although believing the record is terrible, Mack promotes the release in the hope it will become the [[Christmas number-one singles in the UK|Christmas number one single]], which it does. He foregoes a victory party hosted by [[Elton John]] to celebrate Christmas with Joe, getting drunk and watching [[pornography|porn]].\n\n===Juliet, Peter and Mark===\nJuliet ([[Keira Knightley]]) and Peter's ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]) wedding is videotaped by the [[best man]], Mark ([[Andrew Lincoln]]), where a surprise band plays the [[Beatles]]' \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" as they walk out of the church. Although the couple believe Mark dislikes Juliet, he is actually in love with her. When he evades her requests to see the video he shot at the wedding, she shows up at his flat. Juliet insists she wants them to be friends, but when she views the wedding video Mark recorded, she sees many extreme close-ups of herself and few of Peter's face. She realises Mark's true feelings towards her. After an uncomfortable silence, Mark blurts out that he acts cold out of \"self-preservation\".\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Juliet answers the doorbell to find Mark carrying a [[boombox]] playing a [[Silent Night|Christmas carol]] and large [[cue cards]]. While Peter is inside watching television, Mark tells a message of his love to Juliet through the cue cards. As he walks away down the street, Juliet runs after him, gives him a quick kiss and returns inside.\n\n===Jamie and Aur\u00e9lia===\nWriter Jamie ([[Colin Firth]]) is pushed by his girlfriend ([[Sienna Guillory]]) to attend Juliet and Peter's wedding alone, as she is ill. He returns before the reception to check on her, discovering she is having sex with his brother. Crushed, Jamie withdraws to his French cottage, where he meets Portuguese housekeeper Aur\u00e9lia ([[L\u00facia Moniz]]), who does not speak English. Despite not sharing a common language, they share a mutual attraction.\n\nJamie returns to England, realises he is in love with Aur\u00e9lia and begins learning Portuguese. He returns to France<!-- Please do not change to Portugal. Jamie leaves the Marseille airport before proceeding to Aurelia's home. He knows where it is as he dropped her off there several times. --> to find her and ends up walking through town with her father and sister, gathering additional people as they walk to her waitressing job. In basic, and often grammatically incorrect Portuguese, he declares his love for her and proposes. She says yes in broken English, showing she too had been studying English \"just in cases\", as the crowd erupts in applause.\n\n===Harry, Karen and Mia===\nHarry ([[Alan Rickman]]) is the managing director of a design agency. Mia ([[Heike Makatsch]]) is his secretary. Harry is happily married to Karen ([[Emma Thompson]]), a stay-at-home mother. They have two children, Bernard and Daisy. Mia behaves in an overtly sexual way with him at the office and asks him for a Christmas present. At the company Christmas party held at Mark's gallery, they dance closely.\n\nWhile Christmas shopping, Harry calls Mia and asks what she wants for Christmas. He is almost caught by his wife purchasing an expensive necklace with a gold heart pendant from the jewellery<!-- This is the way this word is spelled other than in the US so please do not change it --> department when the salesman Rufus ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) takes an inordinate amount of time to wrap it. Later, Karen finds the necklace in Harry's coat pocket and assumes it is for her. Opening a similarly shaped box on Christmas Eve, she is heartbroken to find it is a [[Joni Mitchell]] CD and realises he bought the necklace for someone else. She confronts Harry and asks what he would do if he were her. She feels he has made a mockery of their marriage and of her.\n\n===David and Natalie===\nDavid ([[Hugh Grant]]), who is Karen's brother, is also the recently elected [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. Natalie ([[Martine McCutcheon]]) is a new junior member of the household staff at [[10 Downing Street]]. During a meeting with the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]), they come across Natalie and the president makes some inappropriate comments to David about her. Later, David walks in on Natalie serving tea and biscuits to the President, and it appears that something untoward is happening. Natalie seems embarrassed, and the president has a sly grin on his face. At the following joint press conference, David is uncharacteristically assertive while taking a stand against the President's intimidation techniques.\n\nFeeling uncomfortable around Natalie, David has her moved to another position. However, he is spurred to action on Christmas Eve when he finds a [[Christmas card]] from her in his [[Red box (government)|red box]], declaring that she is his and only his. He finds her after a door-to-door search of her street. Her entire family is on their way to a multi-school [[Nativity play|Christmas play]] and he offers to drive them so he can talk to her. As Natalie sneaks him in to the school, he runs into his heartbroken sister, Karen, who believes he is there for his niece and nephew. As David and Natalie try to keep from being seen and watch from backstage, they finally kiss. Everyone sees them kissing as the curtain rises.\n\n===Daniel, Sam, Joanna and Carol===\nDaniel ([[Liam Neeson]]), Karen's close friend, mourns the recent death of his wife, Joanna, as he tries to care for his stepson Sam ([[Thomas Brodie-Sangster|Thomas Sangster]]). Sam has fallen for an American classmate, also named Joanna ([[Olivia Olson]]), and after talking with his stepfather, decides to learn the drums to accompany her in the big finale for their school's Christmas pageant at Karen and Harry's children's school. Sam feels he has missed his chance to impress her, but Daniel convinces him to try to tell Joanna how he feels at the airport before she returns to the US. Sam slips through airport security and catches up with her. She acknowledges him by name and kisses him on the cheek. Meanwhile, Daniel meets Carol ([[Claudia Schiffer]]), the mother of Sam's schoolmate, and there is a mutual spark.\n\n===Sarah, Karl and Michael===\nSarah ([[Laura Linney]]) first appears at Juliet and Peter's wedding, sitting next to her friend Jamie. An American working at Harry's graphic design company, she is in love with the creative director, Karl ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]). Prompted by Harry, they finally connect at the Christmas party and Karl drives her home. Michael, her [[mental disorder|mentally ill]] brother, telephones from a psychiatric hospital, aborting their [[wikt:Special:Search/tryst|tryst]]. On Christmas Eve they are both working late. Karl tries to find words but just wishes her a merry Christmas and leaves. In tears, Sarah calls Michael and visits him to give him a Christmas gift.\n\n===Colin, Tony and the American girls===\nUnsuccessfully attempting to woo various English women, including Mia and Nancy ([[Julia Davis]]), Juliet and Peter's wedding caterer, Colin Frissell ([[Kris Marshall]]) informs his friend Tony ([[Abdul Salis]]) that he plans to go to America, convinced that his [[Britishness]] will be an asset. Landing in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], Colin meets Stacey ([[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]]), Jeannie ([[January Jones]]) and Carol-Anne ([[Elisha Cuthbert]]), three stunningly attractive women who instantly fall for his [[Estuary English]] accent, inviting him to stay at their home, where they are joined by their room-mate Harriet ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]).\n\n===John and Judy===\nJohn ([[Martin Freeman]]) and Judy ([[Joanna Page]]) are professional [[Double (filmmaking)|body doubles]] for films. They meet doing the [[sex scene]]s for a film for which Tony is a production assistant. John tells Judy that \"It's lovely to find someone [he] can actually chat to.\" While they are perfectly comfortable being naked and simulating sex on-set, they are shy and tentative off-set. They carefully pursue a relationship, attending the Christmas pageant (involving David and Natalie, Harry and Karen's children, Daniel and Sam, etc.) at the local school with John's brother.\n\n===Rufus===\nRufus ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) is the jewellery<!-- This is the way this word is spelled other than in the US, so please do not change it --> salesman whose meticulous gift-wrapping nearly results in Karen seeing Harry buying a necklace for Mia. In another scene, his distraction of airport staff enables Sam to sneak past them to talk to Joanna. (In the director and cast commentary, it is revealed that Rufus was originally supposed to be a Christmas angel, but this was dropped from the final script.)\n\n===Epilogue===\nOne month later, all of the characters are seen at [[Heathrow Airport]]. Billy's Christmas single has spurred a comeback. Juliet, Peter and Mark meet Jamie and his bride, Aur\u00e9lia. Karen and the kids greet Harry, but Karen's stifled reaction suggests they are struggling to move past his indiscretion. Sam greets Joanna, who has returned from America, and Daniel is joined by his new girlfriend Carol and her son. Newlyweds John and Judy, heading off to their honeymoon, run into Tony, who is awaiting Colin's return from America. Colin returns with Harriet and her sister Carla ([[Denise Richards]]), who meets Tony for the first time but greets him with a hug and a kiss on the lips. Natalie welcomes David back from his flight in view of the press, showing their relationship is now public. These scenes dissolve into footage of actual arrivals at Heathrow, as the screen is divided into an increasing number of smaller segments which form the shape of a heart.\n\n===Story association===\n[[File:Love Actually (2003) Interconnections.svg|thumb|Interconnections between the ''Love Actually'' characters|300x300px]]\nAll the stories are linked in some way; while Billy Mack and his manager may not connect with any of the other characters physically, Billy appears frequently on characters' radios and TVs, his music video twice providing an important plot device for Sam's pursuit of Joanna, and they also cross paths with the other characters in the closing Heathrow scene. John and Judy work with Tony, who is best friends with Colin, who works for a catering company that services the office where Sarah, Karl, Mia and Harry work. Mia is friends with Mark, who runs the art gallery where the Christmas office party takes place. Mia also lives next door to Natalie. Mark is in love with Juliet and friends with Peter. The couple are friends with Jamie and Sarah. Harry is married to Karen, who is friends with Daniel and her brother is David, who works with Natalie. Harry and Karen's children (and thus David's niece and nephew), Natalie's siblings (and thus Mia's neighbours) and Carol's son are all schoolmates of Sam and Joanna. An additional plot that was dropped in editing concerned the children's headmistress ([[Anne Reid]]) and her dying lesbian partner ([[Frances de la Tour]]).<ref>{{cite magazine |title=See the same-sex romance that was deleted from 'Love Actually' |author=Oliver Gettell |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=24 November 2015 |access-date=20 December 2021 |url= https://ew.com/article/2015/11/24/love-actually-deleted-lesbian-subplot/}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as Harry\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Karen\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as David, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Juliet\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Jamie\n* [[Sienna Guillory]] as Jamie's girlfriend\n* [[L\u00facia Moniz]] as Aur\u00e9lia\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Daniel\n* [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster|Thomas Sangster]] as Sam\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Billy Mack\n* [[Gregor Fisher]] as Joe\n* [[Martine McCutcheon]] as Natalie\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as Peter\n* [[Andrew Lincoln]] as Mark\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Sarah\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Karl\n* Michael Fitzgerald as Michael\n* [[Kris Marshall]] as Colin\n* [[Abdul Salis]] as Tony\n* [[Heike Makatsch]] as Mia\n* [[Martin Freeman]] as John\n* [[Joanna Page]] as Judy\n* [[Olivia Olson]] as Joanna\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as the [[U.S. President]]\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Rufus\n* [[Claudia Schiffer]] as Carol\n* [[Nina Sosanya]] as Annie\n* [[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]] as Stacey\n* [[January Jones]] as Jeannie\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Carol-Anne\n* [[Shannon Elizabeth]] as Harriet\n* [[Denise Richards]] as Carla\n* [[Lulu Popplewell]] as Daisy\n* [[Marcus Brigstocke]] as Mikey\n* [[Julia Davis]] as Nancy\n* [[Ruby Turner]] as Jean\n* [[Adam Godley]] as Mr Trench\n* [[\u00c9lisabeth Margoni]] as Eleonore\n*[[Edward Hardwicke]] as\tSam's Grandfather\n*[[Caroline John]] as Sam's Grandmother\n* [[Meg Wynn Owen]] as Mary, PM's secretary\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Richard Curtis (26749114016).jpg|thumb|The film's director, [[Richard Curtis]]]]\nInitially, Curtis started writing with two distinct and separate films in mind, each featuring expanded versions of what would eventually become storylines in ''Love Actually'';
