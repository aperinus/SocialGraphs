The sequel to ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), it is the fifth film in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' film series and second chronological chapter of the \"[[Skywalker Saga]]\". The film stars [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Hayden Christensen]], [[Ian McDiarmid]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]], and [[Frank Oz]].\n\nThe story is set ten years after ''The Phantom Menace'', as thousands of [[planetary system]]s slowly [[Secession|secede]] from the [[Galactic Republic]] and join the newly-formed Confederacy of Independent Systems, led by former [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Count Dooku]]. With the galaxy on the brink of [[civil war]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] investigates a mysterious assassination attempt on Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], which leads him to uncover a [[Clone trooper|clone army]] in service of the Republic and the truth behind the Separatist movement. Meanwhile, his apprentice [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]] is assigned to protect Amidala and develops a secret relationship with her. Soon, the trio witness the onset of a new threat to the galaxy: the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]].\n\nDevelopment of ''Attack of the Clones'' began in March 2000, some months after the release of ''The Phantom Menace''. By June 2000, Lucas and Hales completed a draft of the script, and principal photography took place from June to September 2000. The film crew primarily shot at [[Fox Studios Australia]] in [[Sydney]], Australia, with additional footage filmed in Tunisia, Spain, and Italy. It was one of the first motion pictures shot completely on a [[digital cinematography|high-definition digital 24-frame system]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States on May 16, 2002. It received mixed reviews, with some critics hailing it as an improvement over its predecessor ''The Phantom Menace'' and others considering it the worst installment of the franchise. The film was praised for an increased emphasis on action, visual effects, musical score, costume design, and the performances of McGregor, McDiarmid, Lee, and Oz, but criticized for its screenplay, romantic scenes, pacing, long runtime and underdeveloped characters. It performed well at the box office, making over $645 million worldwide; however, it became the first ''Star Wars'' film to be outgrossed in its year of release, placing third domestically after ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' and [[2002 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing worldwide]] after the latter two films and ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2022/05/16/20-years-ago-matrix-spider-man-harry-potter-lord-of-the-rings-put-star-wars-attack-of-the-clones-on-the-defensive/?sh=37a80e4e7f64|title=20 Years Ago, 'Attack Of The Clones' Put 'Star Wars' On The Defensive|author=Scott Mendelson|work=[[Forbes]]|date=May 16, 2022|access-date=May 29, 2022}}</ref> ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) followed ''Attack of the Clones'', concluding the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nTen years after the battle at [[Naboo]],{{efn|As depicted in the 1999 film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]''.}} the [[Galactic Republic]] is threatened by a Separatist movement organized by former [[Jedi Master]] [[Count Dooku]]. Senator [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] comes to [[Coruscant]] to vote on a motion to create an army to assist the Jedi against the threat. Narrowly avoiding an assassination attempt upon her arrival, she is placed under the protection of Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his apprentice [[Anakin Skywalker]]. The pair thwart a second attempt on Padm\u00e9's life and subdue the assassin, [[Zam Wesell]], who is killed by her employer, a [[bounty hunter]], before she can reveal his identity. The Jedi Council instructs Obi-Wan to find the bounty hunter, while Anakin is tasked to protect Padm\u00e9 and escort her back to Naboo, where the two fall in love in spite of the Jedi Code that forbids attachments.\n\nObi-Wan's search leads him to the mysterious ocean planet of [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]], where he discovers an army of [[Clone trooper|clone]]s being produced for the Republic under the name of Sifo-Dyas, a deceased Jedi Master, with bounty hunter [[Jango Fett]] serving as their [[Genetics|genetic]] template. Obi-Wan deduces Jango to be the bounty hunter he is seeking, and after a brief battle, places a homing beacon on Jango's ship, ''[[Slave&nbsp;I]]''. He then follows Jango and his clone son, [[Boba Fett|Boba]], to the planet [[Geonosis]]. Meanwhile, Anakin is troubled by visions of his mother, [[Shmi]], in pain and decides to return to his homeworld of [[Tatooine]] with Padm\u00e9 to save her. [[Watto]] reveals that he sold Shmi to moisture farmer [[Cliegg Lars]], who then freed and married her. Cliegg tells Anakin that she was abducted by [[Tusken Raiders]] one month earlier and is likely dead. Determined to find his mother, Anakin ventures out and finds her at the Tusken campsite, barely alive. After she dies in his arms, an enraged Anakin massacres the entire tribe. He later confesses his actions to Padm\u00e9 and vows that he will find a way to prevent the deaths of those he loves.\n\nOn Geonosis, Obi-Wan discovers a Separatist gathering led by Count Dooku, who is developing a [[battle droid|droid]] army with Trade Federation Viceroy [[Nute Gunray]] and ordered the attempts on Padm\u00e9's life. Obi-Wan transmits his findings to the Jedi Council but is captured by Separatist droids. Dooku meets Obi-Wan in his cell and explains his role in the Confederacy of Independent Systems' formation, while implying that the [[Sith|Sith Lord]] [[Darth Sidious]] is in control of a large portion of the Galactic Senate. He then invites Obi-Wan to join him and stop Sidious. When Obi-Wan refuses, Dooku claims that Obi-Wan's late master and Dooku's former apprentice [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] would have, had he been alive. Meanwhile, Senate Representative [[Jar Jar Binks]] proposes a successful vote to grant [[emergency powers]] to [[Palpatine|Chancellor Palpatine]], allowing the clone army to be authorized.\n\nAnakin and Padm\u00e9 head to Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan, but Anakin loses his lightsaber and they are captured by Jango. In an arena, Dooku sentences the trio to death, but they are saved by a battalion of clone troopers led by [[Yoda]], [[Mace Windu]], and other Jedi; Windu beheads Jango during the ensuing battle. Obi-Wan and Anakin intercept Dooku, and they engage in a [[lightsaber]] duel. Dooku injures Obi-Wan and severs Anakin's right arm, but Yoda intercepts and defends them. Dooku uses [[the Force]] in an attempt to kill Anakin and Obi-Wan to distract Yoda and escapes to Coruscant, where he delivers the plans of [[Death Star|a super-weapon]] to Sidious. The Council is left disturbed by Dooku's claim of Sidious controlling the Senate. As the Jedi acknowledge the beginning of the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]],{{efn|As depicted in the 2008 television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''.}} Anakin is fitted with a robotic hand and marries Padm\u00e9 in a ceremony on Naboo, with [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] as witnesses.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 420\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = Left to right: [[Ewan McGregor]] (pictured in 2012), [[Natalie Portman]] (2015), and [[Hayden Christensen]] (2010)\n| image1 = Ewan McGregor Cannes 2012.jpg\n| alt1 = A photograph of Ewan McGregor\n| image2 = Natalie Portman Cannes 2015 5 (cropped).jpg\n| alt2 = A photograph of Natalie Portman\n| image3 = Hayden-cfda2010-0004(1) (cropped).jpg\n| alt3 = A photograph of Hayden Christensen\n}}<!-- Main cast (from billing block) listed in bullet points only.

In March 2000, just three months before the start of principal photography, Lucas finally completed his rough draft for ''Episode II''. Lucas continued to iterate on his rough draft, producing a proper first and second draft. For help with the third draft, which would later become the shooting script, Lucas brought on [[Jonathan Hales]], who had written several episodes of ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' for him, but had limited experience writing theatrical films. The final script was completed just one week before the start of principal photography.\n\nAs an in-joke, the film's [[working title]] was ''Jar Jar's Great Adventure'', a sarcastic reference to the negative fan response to the ''[[Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace|Episode I]]'' character.{{sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=531}}\n\nIn writing ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Lucas initially decided that [[Lando Calrissian]] was a clone and came from a planet of clones which caused the \"Clone Wars\" mentioned by Obi-Wan Kenobi in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'';{{sfn|Bouzereau|1997|p=196}}{{sfn|Kaminski|2007|p=158}} he later came up with an alternate concept of an army of clone shocktroopers from a remote planet which were used by the Republic as an army in the war that followed.{{sfn|Kaminski|2007|p=162}}\n\n===Filming===\n{{see also|List of Star Wars filming locations}}\n[[File:Sevilla Plaza de Espana 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.81|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a was the filming location for the Naboo palace.]]\nPrincipal photography occurred between June 26, 2000 and September 20, 2000 at [[Fox Studios Australia]] in [[Sydney]].

This spawned controversy over the benefits and disadvantages of [[digital cinematography]] that continues as more filmmakers \"convert\" to digital filmmaking while many filmmakers oppose it. In contrast to previous installments, for which scenes were shot in the Tunisian desert in temperatures up to 125&nbsp;\u00b0F (51&nbsp;\u00b0C), the camera would still run without complications. Lucas had stated that he wished to film ''The Phantom Menace'' on this format but Sony was unable to build the cameras quickly enough.<ref name=\"HereWeGo\">''Here We Go Again: The Digital Cinema Revolution Begins'' DVD Special Feature, [2002]</ref> In 2002, ''Attack of the Clones'' became the third film to be released that was shot entirely on a 24p digital camera (preceded by 2001's ''[[Jackpot (2001 film)|Jackpot]]'' and ''[[Vidocq (2001 film)|Vidocq]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0087768/ |title=Disney To Roll Out Pearl Harbor Again This Week |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |date=August 28, 2001|access-date=July 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410041932/http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0087768/|archive-date=April 10, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The cameras record in the [[16:9]] [[HDCAM]] format ([[1080p]]), although the image was cropped to a 2.40:1 [[widescreen]] ratio.

While Lucas had used other ways of producing motion-based storyboards in the past, after ''The Phantom Menace'' the decision was made to take advantage of the growing digital technology.<ref name = \"Previz\"/> The process began with [[Ben Burtt]]'s creation of what the department dubbed as \"videomatics\", so called because they were shot on a household videocamera. In these videomatics, production assistants and relatives of the department workers acted out scenes in front of [[chroma key|greenscreen]]. Using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), the previsualization department later filled in the green screen with rough background footage. Burtt then cut together this footage and sent it off to Lucas for changes and approval. The result was a rough example of what the final product was intended to be. The previsualization department then created a finer version of the videomatic by creating an [[animatic]], in which the videomatic actors, props, and sets were replaced by digital counterparts to give a more precise, but still rough, look at what would eventually be seen. The animatic was later brought on set and shown to the actors so that they could understand the concept of the scene they were filming in the midst of the large amount of bluescreen used. Unlike most of the action sequences, the Battle of Geonosis was not story-boarded or created through videomatics but was sent straight to animatics after the department received a small vague page on the sequence. The intent was to create a number of small events that would be edited together for pacing inside the finished film. The animatics department was given a free hand regarding events to be created within the animatic; Lucas only asked for good action shots that he could choose from and approve later.<ref name=\"Previz\">''State of the Art: The Previsualization of Episode II'' DVD Special Feature, [2002]</ref>\n\nIn addition to introducing the digital camera, ''Attack of the Clones'' emphasized \"digital doubles\" as computer-generated models that doubled for actors, in the same way that traditional stunt doubles did. It also furthered the authenticity of computer-generated characters by introducing a new, completely CGI-created version of the character [[Yoda]]. Rob Coleman and [[John Knoll]] prepared two tests featuring a CGI-animated Yoda using audio from ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. Yoda's appearance in ''Episode V'' also served as the reference point for the creation of the CGI Yoda; Lucas repeatedly stated to the animation department that \"the trick\" to the animation of the CGI Yoda was to make him like the puppet from which he was based, in order to maintain a flow of continuity. [[Frank Oz]] (voice and puppeteer for Yoda in the [[Original trilogy (Star Wars)|original trilogy]] and ''The Phantom Menace'') was consulted; his main piece of advice was that Yoda should look extremely old, sore, and frigid.<ref name=\"PuppetsPixels\">''From Puppets to Pixels: Digital Characters in Episode II'' DVD Special Feature, [2002]</ref> Coleman later explained the process of making the digital Yoda like the puppet version, by saying \"When Frank [Oz] would move the head, the ears would jiggle. If we hadn't put that in, it wouldn't look like Yoda.\"<ref>Cagle, Jess (April 29, 2002). \"Yoda Goes Digital-and Conquers Too\", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' Canadian Edition, page 48.</ref> Because of the acrobatics of the lightsaber fight between Count Dooku and Yoda, the then 78-year-old [[Christopher Lee]] relied on a stunt double to perform the most demanding scenes instead. Lee's face was superimposed onto the double's body in all shots other than close-ups, which he performed himself. Lucas often called the duel crucial to the animation department, as it had such potential to be humorous rather than dramatic.<ref name=\"PuppetsPixels\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack to the film was released on April 23, 2002 by [[Sony Classical Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starwarsthemusic.com/music/star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones |title=Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones |publisher=The Official Star Wars Music Website |access-date=July 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214142437/http://www.starwarsthemusic.com/music/star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones |archive-date=February 14, 2008}}</ref> The music was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]], and performed by the London Voices and [[London Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sonyclassical.com/music/89932/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202075936/http://www.sonyclassical.com/music/89932/ |archive-date=December 2, 2007 |title=Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones&nbsp;\u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |publisher=Sony Music Classical |access-date=July 1, 2008}}</ref> The soundtrack recreates \"[[The Imperial March]]\" from the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' for its first chronological appearance in ''Attack of the Clones'', even though a hint of it appeared in the previous movie in one of the final scenes.

In both films, an [[asteroid]] field is the backdrop of a major star battle in the middle of the film. Obi-Wan escapes Jango Fett by attaching his spacecraft to an asteroid in order to disappear from the enemy sensors; [[Han Solo]] uses a similar tactic by attaching the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' to a [[Star Destroyer]] in ''The Empire Strikes Back''.
