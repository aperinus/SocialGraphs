The film stars [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Raoul Bova]], [[Rosie Day]], [[Paz Vega]], and [[Claudia Cardinale]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in valleys of [[Tuscany]], Maggie returns to a town where she spent her youth, along with her daughter, when she comes across her ex Luca and his mother Carmen, who live in a villa nearby. Decades earlier, Luca and Maggie were wildly in love, but she left one day for America and cut off communication with Luca completely. Luca, who still harbours feelings for Maggie, tries to win her back.\n\nMeanwhile, Maggie's daughter Summer is desperate to get back to America and her selfish boyfriend Tyler (who wants her to take the rap for a recent drug charge, arguing that as she's a juvenile she'd receive a less serious sentence than him), and Luca's mother Carmen wants to unite and marry her 60s youth flame Marcellino, whom she had been recently exchanging love letters with. In the chaos that follows, Summer and Carmen steal Luca's car and race for [[Rome]], where Carmen and Marcellino have planned their secret wedding at a church. Summer, initially planning to leave for America via Rome airport, on seeing the honor and love of Carmen realizes that she is being used by Tyler, and surprisingly finds love in farm girl Ermenegilda. Maggie and Luca, racing behind the two, also bicker about their past, and rekindle their love as they head for Rome.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Maggie Falk, an American journalist revisiting Italy with her rebellious daughter\n* [[Raoul Bova]] as Luca, Maggie's former love interest from a visit decades earlier to Italy \n* [[Claudia Cardinale]] as Carmen, Luca's mother\n* [[Rosie Day]] as Summer Falk, Maggie's daughter \n* [[Paz Vega]] as Giulia Carni, a television reporter and Luca's one-time love interest\n* Marco Bonini as Inspector Moravia\n* Nadir Caselli as Valentina, Luca's daughter\n* [[Shel Shapiro]] as Marcellino, Carmen's pop group bandmate from the 60s\n* Rocio Mu\u00f1oz as Ermenegilda, Summer's newfound lesbian love interest\n\n== Production ==\nCasting announcements were made in October 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title=Sarah Jessica Parker to Star in Romantic Comedy 'All Roads Lead to Rome' |url=https://www.thewrap.com/sarah-jessica-parker-to-star-in-romantic-comedy-all-roads-lead-to-rome/|accessdate=November 9, 2015|work=thewrap.com|date=October 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Oct2014D>{{cite news|last1=Fleming |first1=Mike Jr.|title=Rosie Day Joins 'All Roads Lead To Rome'|url=https://deadline.com/2014/10/rosie-day-all-roads-lead-to-rome-853842/|accessdate=November 9, 2015|work=deadline.com|date=October 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Oct2014THR>{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Ariston|title=Sarah Jessica Parker Starts Shooting 'All Roads Lead to Rome'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sarah-jessica-parker-starts-shooting-742376|accessdate=November 9, 2015|work=hollywoodreporter.com|date=October 20, 2014}}</ref> Shel Shapiro, who plays Carmen's love interest from their 1960s pop band in the film, was actually a member of the 1960s Italian pop group [[The Rokes]].
