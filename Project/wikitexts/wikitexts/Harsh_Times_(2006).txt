Set in [[South Central Los Angeles]], the film stars [[Christian Bale]] and [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]. The film was distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and Bauer Martinez Entertainment. Ayer says that the film's characters are largely based on the people he knew when he lived in South Central Los Angeles.\n\n==Plot==\nJim Davis ([[Christian Bale]]) is a former [[75th Ranger Regiment|U.S. Army Ranger]] and [[Global War On Terror|GWOT]] veteran who suffers from [[posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]. Jim has a Mexican girlfriend, Marta ([[Tammy Trull]]), whom he is determined to marry and bring into the United States to start a life together. With this in mind, Jim returns to [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]].\n\nIn Los Angeles, Jim meets up with his best friend Mike Alonzo ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]). Mike's longtime girlfriend, Sylvia ([[Eva Longoria]]), a young attorney, is \"on the warpath\" over his failure to get a job (his previous job was [[outsourcing|outsourced]]) and she encourages Jim to help Mike hand out resumes.  After being denied a position in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] for failing the psychological profile, Jim gets drunk with Mike.\n\nThe two visit Jim's ex-girlfriend, but when her current boyfriend shows up, a fight ensues in which the boyfriend is backed up by a group of friends. Jim is able to get the upper hand and when Mike produces a gun, they subdue the men and rob them of their possessions, including [[marijuana]] and a [[handgun]] which they later decide to sell. Jim later leaves messages on Mike's answering machine with several different voices, pretending to be companies responding to his resume.\n\nThe next day, Jim goes to visit Mike and finds Sylvia in a good mood due to the fake callbacks. Jim and Mike go to a \"paisa\" bar to try to sell the gun, but leave after their potential buyer is killed. Mike is horrified, but Jim is strangely excited by witnessing death again.\n\nWhen Mike arrives back home drunk, Sylvia is upset, so Mike plays back the [[answering machine]], unaware that his friend didn't hang up early enough and his voice is heard on the tape. Sylvia is enraged and throws Mike out. He stays at Jim's place. Jim gets shortlisted for a position with the [[Department of Homeland Security]], but, after cheating to pass a [[urine test]], he fails a [[polygraph]] test due to a question about his drug use. The only hope left for him is a government agent working out of [[Colombia]], who appreciates Jim's ability to \"get things done\"; Jim eventually accepts the position but is warned that he must not marry a foreigner. Jim is told to report to [[FLETC]] in a few days. Meanwhile, Mike gets a job with a company managed by an old friend.\n\nMike goes to visit Sylvia and tells her that he has a job for real. She calms down and the two make love. Impatient, Jim goes inside and tells Sylvia that Mike is coming to Mexico with him for the weekend, as it is their last chance to hang out. Sylvia is angry and against the idea, but Mike decides to go with Jim and Toussant to Mexico.\n\nIn Mexico, the trio attend a big party where Marta reveals she is pregnant, and Jim responds violently, threatening to punch her in the stomach and shoot her in the head. Seeing this from afar, Mike urges Toussant and Jim to leave for home. After Jim drives home dangerously in a belligerent state, Toussant urges Jim to get help and will cut off all contact until he does so. Afterward, Jim reveals to Mike he is transporting 20 kilos of marijuana. When Mike protests, Jim pulls a gun on him, flashing back, before breaking down in tears, horrified at what he is becoming. Mike, filled with pity for his friend, agrees to accompany Jim to the deal. When they arrive, they realize one of the buyers was the same man they had earlier robbed.\n\nHostility ensues with both Jim and the other gang members pulling out guns, resulting in the other man's death. The other members of the buying party plead for their lives, but Jim kills them while suffering flashbacks. While Jim and Mike are escaping in the car, a man comes from the house and shoots at the car with an [[Armsel Striker]]; Jim is hit in the back and face and subsequently [[paralysis|paralyzed]].\n\nHe urges Mike to \"step up\" and shoot him, thus ending his suffering. After some hesitation, Mike and Jim say their goodbyes and Mike ends up killing Jim. The film ends with Mike returning to Sylvia. They embrace together as Mike breaks down crying.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Jim Davis\n* [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]] as Mike Alonzo\n* [[Eva Longoria]] as Sylvia Alonzo\n* [[Tammy Trull]] as Marta\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Darrell\n* Samantha Esteban as Letty\n* Tania Verafield as Patty\n* [[Noel Gugliemi]] as 'Flaco'\n* Chaka Forman as Toussant\n* Adriana Millan as Rita\n* C\u00e9sar Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez as 'Listo'\n* Geo Corvera as 'Wilo'\n* Blue Mesquita as Leo\n* [[Craig Ricci Shaynak]] as Agent Doug Gillespie\n* Michael Monks as Agent Hollenbreck\n* [[J.K.
