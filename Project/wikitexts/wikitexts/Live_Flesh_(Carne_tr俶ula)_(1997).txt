The film is loosely based on the 1986 book of the same name by British crime writer [[Ruth Rendell]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=February 2022}}\n[[Madrid]], Christmas 1970. The [[Spanish State]] has declared a [[state of emergency]] curtailing civil liberties. A young prostitute, Isabel Plaza Caballero, gives birth on a bus to a son she names V\u00edctor. Twenty years later, V\u00edctor Plaza shows up for a date with Elena, a junkie with whom he had sex a week earlier. Elena is waiting for her drug dealer to arrive and orders V\u00edctor to leave, eventually threatening him with a gun. Enraged, V\u00edctor wrestles the gun from her; in the process Elena gets knocked out, and the gun goes off. A neighbour hears the shot and calls the police.\n\nTwo cops respond to the report. The older cop, Sancho, is an unstable alcoholic who suspects his wife Clara of infidelity. The younger cop, David, is clean-cut and sober. Through the window they catch sight of V\u00edctor physically struggling with Elena. Sancho is ready to storm the apartment, while David wants to call for a back-up. When they enter, V\u00edctor holds Elena hostage at gunpoint. David tries to calm him down and get him to drop his gun, but Sancho sabotages his efforts by repeatedly threatening V\u00edctor. Finally, David puts his gun to Sancho's head and gets first Sancho and then V\u00edctor to put down their guns. David orders Elena to flee. Sancho then lunges for V\u00edctor, and as they wrestle for the gun it fires.\n\nTwo years later, V\u00edctor, in jail, watches a [[wheelchair basketball]] match. David, now partially paralyzed from the gunshot two years earlier, is a star player in the [[1992 Summer Paralympics]]. Elena, now his wife, cheers him on from the sidelines. V\u00edctor has made good use of his time in jail, taking a correspondence course in education, working out, and enriching his mind with a variety of subjects, including the Bible. Four years later, he is released. His mother has died, leaving him some money and a house in an area scheduled for demolition.\n\nV\u00edctor visits his mother's grave, where he encounters Elena at her father's burial service. Without identifying himself, he briefly offers her his condolences. Before leaving the cemetery he encounters Sancho's wife Clara, who has arrived too late for Elena's service. They leave together and she visits his apartment. They establish a tentative relationship.\n\nElena, now off drugs and operating an orphanage, tells David of her encounter with V\u00edctor. David stops by V\u00edctor's house and warns him not to go near his wife. V\u00edctor challenges him to prevent him from doing whatever he wants, but David punches him below the belt. David leaves, but he sees Clara arriving and watches from a distance. Clara, drawn by V\u00edctor's enthusiasm and good looks, agrees to teach him how to make love while pampering him with gifts and affection. She eventually falls in love with him.\n\nV\u00edctor is accepted as a volunteer by the orphanage, which accepts the qualifications he earned in prison and discovers he is very good with the children. Elena objects, but can offer no compelling argument against V\u00edctor.\n\nDavid continues to trail V\u00edctor and discovers that he works at his wife's orphanage. He confronts V\u00edctor again, and V\u00edctor denies responsibility for firing the shot that put him in a wheelchair. He demonstrates how Sancho made him squeeze the trigger because Sancho knew David was having an affair with Clara. Afterwards, David tells his wife what V\u00edctor said, admitting that he was having an affair with Clara. Elena is disgusted, but still plans to leave the orphanage to get away from V\u00edctor. V\u00edctor tells Elena that his original plan of revenge was to become the world's greatest lover, make love to Elena all night long, and then abandon her, but that he now loves her too much to do so.\n\nV\u00edctor tells Clara that they should stop seeing each other, and they break up. While V\u00edctor is working overnight at the orphanage, Elena arrives to remove her belongings and offers V\u00edctor a night of passion on condition he never contacts her again. Elena then tells David about this night of infidelity. She tells him she will remain his wife because he needs her more than V\u00edctor does. David is nevertheless intent on avenging himself against V\u00edctor.\n \nClara decides to leave Sancho. He confronts her and she shoots him. David arrives and helps Sancho clean his wound before showing him photographs he has been taking of V\u00edctor and Clara. Sancho and David drive to V\u00edctor's house, arriving just as Clara has finished writing V\u00edctor a farewell letter. Sancho and Clara hold each other at gunpoint and fire. Clara falls dead and Sancho is wounded. Sancho finally kills himself.\n\nIn a voiceover David reads a letter written to his wife from Miami, where he is spending Christmas with some friends, apologizing for the way everything turned out. At the orphanage, a pregnant Elena goes into labor and on the way to the hospital, she and V\u00edctor get stuck in heavy traffic. V\u00edctor is reminded of the circumstances of his own birth, and tells his unborn child that the Spanish people no longer live in fear as they did at the time of his birth.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as David\n* [[Francesca Neri]] as Elena\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Liberto Rabal|es}} as V\u00edctor Plaza\n* [[\u00c1ngela Molina|Angela Molina]] as Clara\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Sancho]] as Sancho\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Isabel Plaza Caballero\n* [[Pilar Bardem]] as Do\u00f1a Centro\n* [[\u00c1lex Angulo]] as bus driver\n* [[Mariola Fuentes]] as Clementina\n* Yael Be as Chica\n* Josep Molins as Josep\n* Maria Rosenfeldt as Ni\u00f1a\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nAlmod\u00f3var's twelfth film opened in Spain on 10 October 1997.
