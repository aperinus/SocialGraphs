It is the second film in the [[Men in Black (film series)|original trilogy]] and a sequel to ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'', which in turn is loosely based on the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[The Men in Black (comics)|The Men in Black]]'' by [[Lowell Cunningham]]. The film stars [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and [[Will Smith]] reprising their roles from the first film, with [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], [[Johnny Knoxville]], [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Tony Shalhoub]], and [[Rip Torn]] in supporting roles; the film also includes a cameo appearance by [[Michael Jackson]]. The film centers on Agent J trying to find and recruit Agent K back into the organization because only K knows how to deal with the latest threat to Earth's security, but restoring that knowledge requires restoring the memories J wiped from K's mind at the end of the previous film.\n\n''Men in Black II'' was released worldwide on July 3, 2002, by [[Columbia Pictures]], receiving mixed reviews from critics and grossing $441.8 million against a budget of $140 million. The film was followed by ''[[Men in Black 3]]'' in 2012, and a standalone sequel ''[[Men in Black: International]]'' in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nIn July 2002, [[Agent J]] has become a top agent but has developed a habit of [[Neuralyzer|neuralyzing]] partners he feels are emotionally unfit to cope with the work. When he is called to investigate the murder of an alien, Ben, at his pizzeria, waitress Laura Vasquez tells him that the murderers are Serleena, a [[shapeshifting]], worm-like Kylothian who has taken the form of a [[Victoria's Secret]] lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad and Charlie. Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MiB rules, does not neuralyze her to erase her memories.\n\nJ finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his former partner and mentor, [[Agent K]], who was neuralyzed upon retirement five years previously and remembers nothing of his MIB service. In [[Truro, Massachusetts]], where K is now the town's [[postmaster]], J convinces him of his past by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens.\n\nBack in New York City, Serleena, along with Scrad and Charlie, launches an attack on MIB headquarters before K's neuralyzation can be reversed, but Jack Jeebs has an illegal deneuralyzer in his basement. K eventually regains his memories but remembers that years before, he neuralyzed himself specifically to erase what he knew of the Light of Zartha and those memories have not returned. As a precaution, he left himself a series of clues.\n\nAt the pizzeria, they find a locker key. J and K fear for Laura's safety and hide her with the worms. The key opens a locker in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] where a society of tiny aliens, who worship K as their deity, guard their most sacred relics: K's wristwatch and video store membership card.\n\nAt the store, as J and K watch a fictionalized story of the Light of Zartha, K remembers the Zarthan Queen Lauranna long ago entrusted Men in Black with safeguarding the Light from her nemesis, Serleena, who followed Lauranna to [[Earth]] and killed her. After hiding the Light, a grief-stricken K neuralyzed himself, both to bury his sadness and to ensure that he would never reveal its hiding place. K still cannot remember where he hid it nor what the Light looks like. Thinking it might be Laura's bracelet, he only remembers that it must return to Zartha soon or both Earth and Zartha will be destroyed.\n\nAt the worms' apartment, they find that Laura has been captured by Serleena. With the worms, they counterattack MIB headquarters, freeing Laura and the other agents. Serleena attempts to retaliate by chasing them with a spaceship through New York but is eaten by Jeff, a gigantic worm alien living in the [[New York City Subway]].\n\nLaura's bracelet leads J and K to the roof of a skyscraper where a ship stands ready to transport the Light back to Zartha. K reveals that Laura is the daughter of Lauranna (and, it is implied, his daughter) and that she's also the Light. K convinces J and Laura that she must go to Zartha to save both her planet and Earth from destruction. Serleena, who has absorbed Jeff and taken his form, attempts to snatch the ship carrying Laura as it lifts off, but J and K blast her out of the sky. Since all of New York City has just witnessed this battle in the skies over the metropolis, K activates a giant neuralyzer in the torch of the [[Statue of Liberty]].\n\nBack at MIB headquarters, J finds the tiny locker-dwelling aliens now in his locker, moved there by K and Chief Zed in an attempt to give him some perspective. When J suggests showing the miniature creatures that their universe is bigger than a locker, K kicks a door open and reveals that the human universe is itself a locker within an immense alien train station.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as [[Agent K|Kevin Brown / Agent K]]: A decommissioned senior MIB agent and the only person who used to know how to stop the latest threat to Earth's safety.\n* [[Will Smith]] as [[Agent J|James Darrel Edwards III / Agent J]]: Still on active duty with the MIB, he is not satisfied with the partners assigned to him and keeps neuralizing them.\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Chief Zed: The head of the MIB.\n* [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] as [[Serleena]]: A shapeshifting alien who has come to Earth to find a vital power source used by her race's enemies.\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Scrad / Charlie: A humanoid alien (Scrad), with a second small head (Charlie) on a stalk protruding from his neck, who does Serleena's dirty work.\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Laura Vasquez: A young woman who turns out to be the long-lost alien princess from Zartha and the power source sought by Serleena.\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Jack Jeebs: An alien pawn shop owner who uses a home-built machine to \"de-neuralize\" K and restore his memory.\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Agent T: Partnered with J, who neuralizes him and throws him out of the MIB after an incident with Jeff.\n* [[Jack Kehler]] as Ben\n* [[David Cross]] as Newton\n* [[Colombe Jacobsen]] as Hailey\n* John Alexander as Jarra\n* [[Michael Jackson]] as Agent M ''(cameo)''\n* [[Martha Stewart]] as Herself ''(cameo)''\n* [[Peter Graves]] as Himself\n* Linda Kim as Princess Lauranna, an alien from Zartha and the secret mother of Laura.\n* Paige Brooks as 'Mysteries in History' Lauranna\n* [[Nick Cannon]] as MIB Autopsy Agent\n* [[Biz Markie]] as Alien Beatboxer\n* [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]] as Postal Sorting Alien\n* [[Martin Klebba]] as Family Child Alien\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Joey\n\n===Voices===\n* [[Tim Blaney]] as [[Frank the Pug]]\n* Brad Abrell as Worm Guy\n* [[Greg Ballora]] as Worm Guy\n* Thom Fountain as Worm Guy\n* Carl J.
