Pictures|Warner Bros.]] under their [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment|Family Entertainment]] imprint. The movie stars [[Kate Maberly]], [[Heydon Prowse]], [[Andrew Knott]], [[John Lynch (actor)|John Lynch]], and [[Maggie Smith]], was written by [[Caroline Thompson]] and based on the 1911 [[The Secret Garden|novel of the same name]] by [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]. The novel was previously adapted into two films: a [[The Secret Garden (1949 film)|1949 drama film]] and a [[The Secret Garden (1919 film)|1919 silent film]], which starred Lila Lee and Spottiswoode Aitken.\n\nSet in [[Yorkshire, England|Yorkshire]], England, Yorkshire's [[Allerton Castle]] was used for most of the exterior shots of Misselthwaite Manor, as well as interior shots. The film was a critical and commercial success. Maggie Smith was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2005, the [[British Film Institute]] included it in their list of the \"50 films you should see by the age of 14\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], synopses should be less than 700 words.-->\nIn 1901, recently orphaned 10-year-old  Mary Lennox is sent from her home in [[British Raj|British India]] to her uncle Lord Archibald Craven's mansion, Misselthwaite Manor, in [[Yorkshire]], England. She was unloved and neglected by her parents, who were killed in an earthquake in India. As a result, Mary is cold, self-centered and so repressed that she is unable to cry.\n\nHead housekeeper Mrs. Medlock informs Mary that her uncle, who spends most of his time away, will likely not see her. Mary hears strange sounds of crying in the house and discovers a hidden door in her room that leads to uninhabited areas, including her aunt's old room. There, she discovers a large key. Mrs. Medlock continuously sends Mary to play out on the grounds to keep her occupied whenever the crying starts in the house. Mary discovers her late Aunt Lilias' walled garden, which has been locked up since her death 10 years prior. She realizes that the key she found earlier unlocks the garden, but keeps it a secret. She befriends Dickon Sowerby, the younger brother of the manor's housemaid. Dickon is an outdoorsy boy who is good with animals. Mary and Dickon slowly clean up the secret garden, and Mary becomes happier. She also finally meets her uncle, who is sullen but kind.\n\nHidden away in the mansion is Lord Craven's son and Mary's cousin, Colin Craven, who has been treated like a sickly invalid his entire life. A spoiled, short-tempered boy, he has never left his room nor ever walked and is confined to his bed or a wheelchair. His father barely comes to see him in fear that Colin will die soon and he will lose his son. Mary eventually discovers Colin, learning that he was the source of the crying in the house. Although taken aback by his difficult nature, she puts her foot down and refuses to give in to his whims, showing him that he is not really sick. Encouraged by Mary, Colin goes outside for the first time and Mary and Dickon take him to the secret garden. \n\nThe three children grow close and spend their free time in the garden everyday, where Colin, with their help, learns to walk. The trio keep all of this a secret from the staff. Colin wants his father to be the first one to see him on his legs. Lord Craven has a dream of Lilias calling him home and returns. In the secret garden, he sees Colin walking for the first time, leaving him speechless with joy. \n\nMary bursts into tears for the first time in her life, certain that she is unwanted by her uncle and the garden will be locked up again as he had ordered it to be. Lord Craven reassures her that she is now part of the family. Promising never to lock it up again, he thanks her for bringing his family back to life. Dickon informs his sister and the rest of the manor staff of the good news. The staff watches in shock and joy as Lord Craven and the children come home together.\n\nThe film ends with a [[voiceover]] of Mary stating that \"If you look the right way, the whole world is a garden.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Kate Maberly]] as Mary Lennox\n*[[Heydon Prowse]] as Colin Craven, Lord Craven's son and Mary's cousin\n*[[Andrew Knott]] as Dickon Sowerby, Martha's younger brother\n*Laura Crossley as Martha Sowerby, Mrs. Medlock's servant and Dickon's older sister\n*[[John Lynch (actor)|John Lynch]] as Lord Archibald Craven\n*[[Maggie Smith]] as Mrs. Medlock, Lord Craven's servant and housekeeper\n*[[Ir\u00e8ne Jacob]] as Mrs. Lennox/Lilias Craven\n*Peter Moreton as Will\n*Colin Bruce as Major Lennox\n*[[Walter Sparrow]] as Ben Weatherstaff, the gardener\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Allerton Castle (geograph 3632989).jpg|thumb|Exterior of [[Allerton Castle]] in Yorkshire, northern England]]\nYorkshire's imposing [[Allerton Castle]] was used for most of the exterior shots of Misselthwaite Manor, and some of the interior was also used.<ref name=\"Guy\"/> [[Fountains Hall]] was also used for part of the exterior.<ref name=\"Guy\">McDonald, Guy (2004).
