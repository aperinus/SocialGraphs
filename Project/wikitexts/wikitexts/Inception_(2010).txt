Do not add any unnecessary details to the plot. Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. Word count as of May 30, 2022 is 609. -->\n\nCobb and Arthur are \"extractors\"; they perform [[Industrial espionage|corporate espionage]] using experimental dream-sharing technology to infiltrate their targets' [[Unconscious mind|subconscious]] and extract information. Their latest target, Saito, is impressed with Cobb's ability to [[false awakening|layer multiple dreams within each other]] and offers to hire Cobb for the supposedly impossible job of implanting an idea into a person's subconscious; performing \"inception\" on Robert, the son of Saito's competitor Maurice Fischer, with the idea to dissolve his father's company. Saito promises to clear Cobb's criminal status, allowing him to return home to his children.\n\nCobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: a forger named Eames, a chemist named Yusuf, and a college student named Ariadne. Ariadne is tasked with designing the dream's architecture, something Cobb himself cannot do for fear of being sabotaged by a projection of his late wife Mal. Maurice dies, and the team sedates Robert into a three-layer shared dream on a plane to America. Time on each layer runs slower than the layer above, with one member staying behind on each to perform a [[Non, je ne regrette rien#In popular culture|music-synchronized]] \"[[Hypnic jerk|kick]]\" to awaken dreamers on all three levels simultaneously.\n\nThe team abducts Robert in a city on the first level but is attacked by his subconscious projections. After Saito is wounded, Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally awaken dreamers, Yusuf's sedatives will instead send them into \"[[Limbo#Cultural references|Limbo]]\": a world of infinite subconscious. Eames impersonates Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, to introduce the idea of an alternate will to dissolve the company. Cobb tells Ariadne that he and Mal entered Limbo while experimenting with dream-sharing, experiencing fifty years in one night due to the time dilation with reality. Mal refused to return to reality, and Cobb instead performed inception on her to convince her. After waking up, Mal still believed she was dreaming. Attempting to \"wake up\", she committed suicide and framed Cobb to force him to do the same. Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children behind.\n\nYusuf drives the team around the first level as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that he has been kidnapped by Browning to stop the dissolution and that Cobb is a defensive projection, leading Robert yet another level deeper as part of a ruse to enter Robert's subconscious. In the third level, the team infiltrates an alpine fortress with a projection of Maurice inside, where the inception itself can be performed.  However, Yusuf performs his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, forcing Arthur and Eames to improvise a new set of kicks synchronized with them hitting the water by rigging an elevator and the fortress respectively with explosives. Mal then appears and kills Robert before he can be subjected to the inception and he and Saito are lost into Limbo, forcing Cobb and Ariadne to rescue them in time for Robert's inception and Eames's kick.\n\nCobb makes peace with Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Robert up with a kick. Revived into the third level, he discovers the planted idea: his dying father telling him to create something for himself. While Cobb searches for Saito in Limbo, the others ride the kicks back to reality. Cobb finds an aged Saito and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awaken on the plane, and Saito makes a phone call. Arriving at [[Los Angeles International Airport|L.A.]], Cobb passes the immigration checkpoint and his father-in-law accompanies him to his home. Cobb uses Mal's \"totem\" \u2013 a [[top]] that spins indefinitely in a dream \u2013 to test if he is indeed in the real world, but chooses not to observe the result and instead joins his children.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:InceptionCastPremiereJuly10.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|The cast at a premiere for the film in July 2010.

Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan expressed his ideal vision: \"Something glacial, with clear modernist architecture, but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs\".<ref name=\"trussell\" /> Franklin and his team ended up with \"something that looked like an iceberg version of [[Gotham City]] with water running through it.\"<ref name=\"trussell\" /> They created a basic model of a glacier and then designers created a program that added elements like roads, intersections and ravines until they had a complex, yet organic-looking, cityscape. For the Paris-folding sequence, Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then they created rough computer animations to give them an idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion. Later during principal photography, Nolan was able to direct DiCaprio and Page based on this rough computer animation that Franklin had created. ''Inception'' had nearly 500 visual effects shots (in comparison, ''[[Batman Begins]]'' had approximately 620), which is relatively few in comparison to contemporary effects-heavy films, which can have as many as 2,000 visual effects shots.<ref name=\"trussell\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Inception: Music from the Motion Picture}}\n\nThe score for ''Inception'' was written by [[Hans Zimmer]],<ref name=\"CinemaRewind\" /> who described his work as \"a very electronic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/inception-score-hans-zimmers-mikee-65200 |title=Hans Zimmer's 'Inception' Score Will Release On July 13th | website= ScreenRant.com |access-date=July 1, 2010 |date=June 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100625130549/http://screenrant.com/inception-score-hans-zimmers-mikee-65200/ |archive-date=June 25, 2010}}</ref> dense score\",<ref name=\"Cassidy\" /> filled with \"nostalgia and sadness\" to match Cobb's feelings throughout the film.<ref name=\"Martens\" /> The music was written simultaneously to filming,<ref name=\"Cassidy\">{{cite news |last=Cassidy |first=Kevin |title=Q&A: Composer Hans Zimmer |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 13, 2010 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/qampa-composer-hans-zimmer-25455 |access-date=July 14, 2010 |archive-date=November 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102202043/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/qampa-composer-hans-zimmer-25455 |url-status=live }}</ref> and features a guitar sound reminiscent of [[Ennio Morricone]], played by [[Johnny Marr]], former guitarist of [[the Smiths]].\n[[\u00c9dith Piaf]]'s \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" (\"No, I Regret Nothing\") appears throughout the film, used to accurately time the dreams, and Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score.<ref name=\"Martens\">{{cite news |last=Martens |first=Todd |title=Hans Zimmer and Johnny Marr talk about the sad romance of 'Inception' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 20, 2010 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/inception-christopher-nolan-the-smiths-johnny-marr-hans-zimmer-and-johnny-marr-on-the-sound-of-inception-its-about-sadness.html |access-date=July 20, 2010 |archive-date=July 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721234310/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/inception-christopher-nolan-the-smiths-johnny-marr-hans-zimmer-and-johnny-marr-on-the-sound-of-inception-its-about-sadness.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\nA [[Inception: Music from the Motion Picture|soundtrack album]] was released on July 11, 2010, by [[Reprise Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.inceptionscore.com/|title=Inception: Music from the Motion Picture official website|publisher=Warner Bros.| website= insceptionscore.com| access-date=July 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616131408/http://www.inceptionscore.com/|archive-date=June 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The majority of the score was also included in high resolution [[5.1 surround sound]] on the second disc of the two-disc Blu-ray release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Inception-Blu-ray/14492/#Review|title=Inception Blu-ray review from Blu-ray.com|access-date=August 8, 2012|archive-date=August 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815212509/http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Inception-Blu-ray/14492/#Review|url-status=live}}</ref> Hans Zimmer's music was nominated for an Academy Award in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] category in 2011, losing to [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Atticus Ross]] of ''[[The Social Network]]''.<ref name=oscars />\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Reality and dreams ===\n[[File:Impossible staircase.svg|right|thumb|[[Penrose stairs]] are incorporated into the film as an example of the [[impossible object]]s that can be created in [[lucid dream]] worlds.|alt=A staircase in a square format.

However, \"he did get many aspects right,\" she said, citing the scene in which a sleeping Cobb is shoved into a full bath, and in the dream world water gushes into the windows of the building, waking him up. \"That's very much how real stimuli get incorporated, and you very often wake up right after that intrusion.\"<ref name=\"Breznican\">{{Cite news|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|title=With ''Inception'', Chris Nolan's head games continue|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 15, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-15-inception15_CV_N.htm|access-date=July 15, 2010|archive-date=June 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629093837/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-15-inception15_CV_N.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nNolan himself said, \"I tried to work that idea of manipulation and management of a [[Lucid dream|conscious dream]] being a skill that these people have.

This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, on the part of the audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious.<ref name='Paul' /> At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding [[Infinity mirror|facing mirrors]] underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in ''la Croix'' asked \"Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?\"<ref>Dreyfus, St\u00e9phanie [http://www.la-croix.com/Culture-Loisirs/Culture/Actualite/Inception-allegorie-onirique-sur-l-illusion-cinematographique-_NG_-2010-07-20-554535 \"Inception\", all\u00e9gorie onirique sur l'illusion cin\u00e9matographique] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225212142/http://www.la-croix.com/Culture-Loisirs/Culture/Actualite/Inception-allegorie-onirique-sur-l-illusion-cinematographique-_NG_-2010-07-20-554535 |date=February 25, 2017 }} ''[[La Croix]]'', July 20, 2010.
