It follows the crew of the deteriorating starship ''Dark Star'', twenty years into their mission to destroy unstable planets that might threaten future colonization of other planets.\n\nBeginning as a [[University of Southern California]] student film produced from 1970 to 1972, it was gradually expanded to feature-length until it appeared at [[Filmex]] in 1974, and subsequently received a limited theatrical release in 1975. Its final budget is estimated at $60,000.<ref name=\"Variety1973\"/> While initially unsuccessful with audiences, it was relatively well-received by critics, and continued to be shown in theaters as late as 1980.<ref name=\"Ebert\"/> The [[home video]] revolution of the early 1980s helped the movie achieve \"[[Cult film|cult classic]]\" status; O'Bannon collaborated with home video distributor VCI in the production of releases on [[VHS]], [[LaserDisc]], [[DVD]], and eventually [[Blu-ray]].\n\n''Dark Star'' was Carpenter's feature [[directorial debut]]; he also scored the film. It was the feature debut for O'Bannon, who also served as editor, production designer, and visual effects supervisor, and appeared as Sergeant Pinback.<ref name=\"PM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/165516-building-the-perfect-star-beast-the-antecedents-of-alien/|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=November 21, 2012|title=Building the Perfect Star Beast: The Antecedents of 'Alien'|first=J.C.|last=Ma\u00e7ek III}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the mid-22nd century, mankind has begun to colonize interstellar space. Armed with artificially intelligent Thermostellar Triggering Devices, which can talk and reason, the scout ship ''Dark Star'' searches for \"unstable planets\" which might threaten future colonization.\n\nTwenty years into its mission, the ''Dark Star'' has aged and suffers frequent malfunctions. Commanding officer Powell has died in one such event, but remains aboard in [[cryogenic suspension]]. Lieutenant Doolittle, a former surfer from [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], has taken over as commander. The tedium of their work has driven the crew of Pinback, Boiler, and Talby \"around the bend\", so they have created distractions for themselves.\n\nPinback plays [[practical joke]]s, maintains a video diary, and has adopted a ship's mascot in the form of a mischievous \"[[beach ball]]\"-like alien who refuses to stay in a storage room. After it attempts to push him down an elevator shaft, he eventually kills it with a gun. He claims to really be [[William Froug|Bill Froug]] and says that the real Pinback has committed suicide.\n\nEn route to their next target in the [[Veil Nebula]],<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Dark Star\", short film script|first1=John|last1=Carpenter|first2=Dan|last2=O'Bannon |url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/dark-star_short.html|access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref> the ''Dark Star'' is hit by electromagnetic energy during a space storm, resulting in another on-board malfunction. Thermostellar Bomb #20 receives an erroneous order to deploy, but the ship's computer talks it back into the bomb bay. An accident with a laser then causes more mayhem, damaging the ship's computer. Bomb #20 deploys again, and this time the crew cannot convince it to stand down. Doolittle revives Powell, who advises him to teach the bomb [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Doolittle [[space walks]] out to have a philosophical conversation with the bomb. It agrees to disarm itself for the moment.\n\nPinback opens the airlock to admit Doolittle, but accidentally ejects Talby, who was in the airlock attempting to repair the laser. Doolittle leaves the ship to retrieve Talby, who is in a space suit but has no maneuvering device. The bomb, having learned [[Cartesian doubt]], trusts only itself. It is convinced that [[Solipsism|only it exists]], and that its sole purpose in life is to explode, and it does so. ''Dark Star'' is destroyed, along with Pinback and Boiler. Talby and Doolittle, at a distance from the ship, are thrown clear. The former drifts into the Phoenix Asteroids, a cluster with which he has long been fascinated. Doolittle, falling toward the unstable planet, finds an oblong hunk of debris, and surfs into the atmosphere, to die as a [[Meteoroid|falling star]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* Brian Narelle as Lieutenant Doolittle\n* [[Dan O'Bannon]] as Sergeant Pinback\n* Cal Kuniholm as Boiler\n* Andreijah \"Dre\" Pahich as Talby\n** [[John Carpenter]] as Talby (voice)<ref name=\"Cumbow2002\"/>\n* Joe Saunders as Commander Powell\n** John Carpenter as Commander Powell (voice)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/dark-star-soundtrack/ |title=Dark Star Soundtrack |website=The Official John Carpenter |publisher=John Carpenter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706163419/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/dark-star-soundtrack/ |archive-date=6 July 2016 |url-status=dead |quote=Commander Powell, Talby \u2013 John Carpenter}}</ref>\n* Barbara \"Cookie\" Knapp as Computer<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hefley |first=Robert M. |date=June 1977 |editor1-last=Zimmerman |editor1-first=Howard |title=The Starlog Science Fiction Address Guide \u2014 Motion Pictures |url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-006/006#page/n35/ |magazine=[[Starlog]] |location=New York |publisher=O'Quinn Studios |volume=1 |issue=6 |page=37 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n* Dan O'Bannon as Bomb #19 (credited as \"Alan Sheretz\")\n* Dan O'Bannon as Bomb #20 (credited as \"Adam Beckenbaugh\") \n* Miles Watkins as Mission Control \n* [[Nick Castle]] as Alien<ref name=\"Zinoman2011\"/>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Screenplay ===\n[[File:John Carpenter.JPG|thumb|upright|Director [[John Carpenter]] in 2011]]\nThe screenplay was written by Carpenter and O'Bannon while they were film students at the [[University of Southern California]].<ref name=\"Cumbow2002\"/> Initially titled ''The Electric Dutchman'', the original concept was Carpenter's, while O'Bannon \"flesh[ed] out many of the original ideas\" and contributed many of the funniest moments.<ref name=\"KaneO\u2019Regan2010\">{{cite book|last1=Kane|first1=Paul|last2=O\u2019Regan|first2=Marie|title=Voices in the Dark: Interviews with Horror Writers, Directors and Actors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eo12Xyraq9UC&pg=PA117|date=October 28, 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5672-7|pages=117\u2013}}</ref> According to O'Bannon, \"The ending was copped from [[Ray Bradbury]]'s story '[[The_Illustrated_Man#Kaleidoscope|Kaleidoscope]]'\", found in the short story collection ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' (1951).<ref name=Fleming1978>{{cite magazine |last1=Fleming |first1=John |date=December 1978 |editor1-last=Skinn |editor1-first=Dez |title=Dark Star Review |url=https://archive.org/stream/Starburst_Magazine_005_1978-12_Marvel-UK#page/n21/ |magazine=Starburst |location=London |publisher=Marvel UK |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=22\u201327 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> O'Bannon references one of his USC teachers, [[William Froug]], when Pinback says in a video diary entry, \"I should tell you my name is not really Sergeant Pinback, my name is Bill Frug.\"<ref name=\"Froug2005\">{{cite book|last=Froug|first=William|title=How I Escaped from Gilligan's Island: And Other Misadventures of a Hollywood Writer-Producer|url=https://archive.org/details/howiescapedfromg00frou_0|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-873-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howiescapedfromg00frou_0/page/258 258]\u2013259}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming, reshoots, and edits===\nThe film began as a 45-minute [[16mm film|16mm]] student project with a final budget of six thousand dollars.<ref name=\"Rausch2008\">{{cite book|last=Rausch|first=Andrew J.|title=Fifty Filmmakers: Conversations with Directors from Roger Avary to Steven Zaillian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHZyAQDhfsMC&pg=PA40|date=February 7, 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8409-6|pages=39\u201340}}</ref><ref name=\"Fischer1991\">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Dennis|title=Horror Film Directors, 1931-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TVNZAAAAMAAJ|date=January 1, 1991|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-89950-609-8|page=118|quote=The original short was 45 minutes long and cost only $6,000 to produce using the equipment at USC.}}</ref> Beginning with an initial budget of one thousand dollars from USC in late 1970,<ref name=\"Stevenson1980\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1980/01/28/people-start-running |title=People Start Running |last=Stevenson |first=James |date=January 28, 1980 |magazine=The New Yorker |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast |access-date=June 20, 2017 }}</ref> Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the first version of the film in early 1972.<ref name=\"Cumbow2002\"/> Carpenter had to dub his own voice over that of Pahich, who had a thick accent.<ref name=\"Fischer1991\"/>\n\nTo achieve feature film length, an additional fifty minutes were shot in 1973, with the support of Canadian distributor Jack Murphy (credited as \"Production Associate\").

He achieved this by [[Tracking shot|tracking]] the camera while leaving the shutter open. This is considered to be the first depiction in cinema history of a spaceship jumping into hyperspace. It is thought that O'Bannon was influenced by the striking \"star gate\" sequence created by [[Douglas Trumbull]] for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968).
