It originally was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on December 22, 2009, and later aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on May 23, 2010. The episode is a retelling and [[parody]] of the 1980 ''Star Wars'' film sequel ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', recasting characters from ''Family Guy'' into roles from the film.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Kirker Butler]] and directed by [[Dominic Polcino]]. It received high praise from critics for its accurate depiction of the original film, as well as its inclusion of many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 6.13 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[H. Jon Benjamin|Jon Benjamin]], [[John Bunnell]], [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]], [[Jackson Douglas]], [[Joe Flaherty]], James Greene, [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], George Rogan and [[James Woods]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.\n\n==Plot==\nAs the [[Griffin family]] is watching television, the power suddenly goes out again, leading [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] to retell the story of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''.\n\nAfter the \"[[Star Wars opening crawl|opening crawl]]\" an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] [[Star Destroyer]] deploys a series of [[droid (Star Wars)|probe droids]] in search of the [[Rebel Alliance]]. One of the probe droids (Joe) lands on the ice planet [[Hoth]], where the Rebels have set up a base. Rebel commander [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Chris Griffin|Chris]]) is patrolling when he is attacked by a large [[wampa]] ([[Cookie Monster]]) and taken back to its lair. At the base, [[Han Solo]] ([[Peter Griffin|Peter]]) announces his intention to leave the Rebellion to [[Princess Leia]] ([[Lois Griffin|Lois]]) and [[Carlist Rieekan]] ([[List of Family Guy characters#Dr. Hartman|Dr. Hartman]]), with Leia objecting to his decision, however she denies it when confronted, saying she would rather kiss [[George Takei]]. When he finds out that Luke has not yet returned, Han sets out on his \"[[Don Knotts|Dondon]]\" to find him. Luke escapes the wampa lair and has a vision of his late mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] ([[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]), who tells him to go to the [[Dagobah]] system to learn the ways of [[the Force]] from [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]], after offering him a bowl of [[Zima (drink)|Zima]] soup. Han quickly locates Luke, and the two are rescued soon after.\n\nSoon after, the Empire discovers the Rebel base, and [[Darth Vader]] ([[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]) orders an attack. The Imperial fleet exits [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] too early, giving the Rebels time to evacuate the base while Luke leads his squadron of [[List of Star Wars air, aquatic, and ground vehicles#Snowspeeder (T-47 Airspeeder)|snowspeeders]] to hold off the Empire's battalion of [[AT-AT|Imperial Walkers]]. [[Imperial stormtrooper]]s break into the base, forcing Han to escape in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' with Leia, [[C-3PO]] ([[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]]) and [[Chewbacca]] ([[Brian Griffin|Brian]]), while Luke escapes in his [[X-wing]] with [[R2-D2]] ([[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]]), stopping to see R2's niece's violin recital. The ''Millennium Falcon'' enters an [[asteroid belt|asteroid field]] and Han decides to dock inside a cave to repair the ship. They flee when they discover they have actually landed in the belly of a [[space slug]] ([[Meg Griffin|Meg]]). Meanwhile, Luke crash-lands in the swamps of Dagobah and finds Yoda ([[List of Family Guy characters#Carl|Carl]]) amid the foggy landscape. Yoda trains Luke, guiding him through a series of training exercises, including watching \"sweet-ass DVD releases\", and a training montage that parodies ''[[Rocky IV]]''.\n\nDarth Vader is ordered by the [[Palpatine|Emperor]] ([[Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]]) to capture Luke and turn him to the [[Dark side (Star Wars)|dark side of the Force]]. Vader recruits [[bounty hunters]] to track down and capture Luke's friends, intending to use them as bait to trap Luke, including [[Raggedy Andy]], whom he orders to leave. With the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'}}s hyperdrive broken, Han and company escape by hiding amongst a field of disposed trash, but are tracked by [[Boba Fett]] ([[Ernie the Giant Chicken]]), after hitting a \"space bum\" collecting some of the garbage. Luke has a premonition that his friends are in danger and leaves Dagobah to save them, although he has not finished his Jedi training. Yoda initially doesn't want him to go, but encourages it after Luke suggests Yoda fight Vader himself.\n\nHan and the others go to Cloud City on the planet [[Bespin]] to obtain help from Han's friend [[Lando Calrissian]] ([[Mort Goldman|Mort]]), \"the only black guy in the galaxy\", only to be turned over to Darth Vader. Han willingly reveals the location of Luke and the Rebel base but is tortured by being forced to listen to [[Paula Cole]]'s \"[[Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?]]\", as punishment for clogging a toilet on the 16th floor of Cloud City, which forced Vader to use the \"little pig people's\" bathroom. Han is used to test a [[carbon]] freezing chamber Vader intends to use on Luke to take him to the Emperor. Leia professes her love to Han, but Han tells her to \"fuck off\" and is then frozen in [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] for posterity. Lando later double-crosses the Empire, freeing Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO, motivating the guards with a pizza party. Despite R2-D2 having sex with the combination lock, and subsequently being discovered by her husband, to get the door open, they are too late to stop Boba Fett from flying off with Han. Luke arrives at Cloud City and, after being briefly interrupted by [[Ryan Seacrest]] on ''[[American Idol]]'', engages Vader in a [[lightsaber]] duel. Vader cuts off Luke's right hand. With Luke cornered and defenseless, Vader goads Luke to join the dark side, revealing that he is his father. Luke casts himself into an air shaft and, after discovering that a worker has shoved his severed hand down his pants, ends up hanging on an antenna beneath the city, calling out to Ben, Leia, and [[Tom Selleck]]. Leia senses Luke's call from within the ''Millennium Falcon'' and has him rescued. On board a [[Nebulon-B frigate]], Luke is fitted with an artificial hand, but told to practice masturbating with a hot dog first. Lando, dressed in Han's clothes, sets off with Chewbacca on the ''Millennium Falcon'' to rescue Han. Luke angrily protests the story's ambiguous ending, but then he receives a letter from [[Emmett Brown|Doc Brown]], a reference to the ending of ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]''.\n\nIn the Griffins' home, the power returns as Peter finishes his story, only to get into another argument with Chris over ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. Chris vows to not let Peter get his goat this time, but eventually storms off when Peter brings up ''[[Without a Paddle]]''.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|left|upright|thumb|alt=A man with black hair, and tan skin with a black shirt on, leans forward while laughing into a microphone.|''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] served as executive producer for the episode.]]\nThe episode was written by series regular Kirker Butler, before the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]], and before his leave from the series in order to become co-executive producer of the ''Family Guy'' spinoff series ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''. Butler wrote the first draft of the episode in four weeks, under the guidance of series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]. The episode was directed by [[Dominic Polcino]], who had previously directed \"[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]\". This was the last episode in the series to use hand-drawn [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]], before transitioning to computer-designed animatics.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, voice actor [[H. Jon Benjamin|Jon Benjamin]] reprised his role as Carl, who portrays [[Yoda]], and Sheriff [[John Bunnell]] made his second appearance in the series, the first being in the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth season]] episode \"[[Quagmire's Baby]]\". Actor [[James Woods]], in his third appearance in the series, as an exaggerated version of himself, guest starred. Actors [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]], [[Jackson Douglas]] and [[Joe Flaherty]], along with voice actors James Greene, [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] and George Rogan made appearances. Recurring guest voice actors [[Johnny Brennan]], Chris Cox, [[Ralph Garman]], [[Wally Wingert]], writers Kirker Butler, [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], [[Alec Sulkin]], John Viener,  writer and showrunner [[Mark Hentemann]], and producer [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]] also made minor appearances in the episode. Live-action clips of actor [[Dolph Lundgren]], actress [[Brigitte Nielsen]] and actor [[Michael Pataki]] from the film ''[[Rocky IV]]'', and actor [[Tom Selleck]] from the film ''[[Her Alibi]]'' were also used in multiple sequences throughout the episode.\n\nThe [[DVD]] release of \"Blue Harvest\" on January 15, 2008, contained an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] of a brief read through of bits from \"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\", as well as a teaser trailer for the episode as another easter egg.\n\nThe title of this episode is a reference to a specific line from the season five episode \"[[Barely Legal (Family Guy)|Barely Legal]]\", which was used in a cutaway relating to ''Star Wars''. The line is an inside joke relating to the [[Palpatine|Emperor]] \"figuring out the formula for great dialogue\" for ''Star Wars''. While the Emperor talks to a kneeling [[Darth Vader]], he says \"Something, something, something, dark side. Something, something, something, complete\". \"Barely Legal\" was written by [[Kirker Butler]], who also wrote this episode.\n\n==Cultural references==\n\nAs the episode opens with a shot of the [[Griffin family]], they are seen sitting in front of the television watching a parody of several [[Aaron Sorkin]] shows, including ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', entitled ''The Kitchen''.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{cite video |date= 2009-12-22 |title= Something, Something, Something, Dark Side Audio Commentary |medium= DVD |publisher= 20th Century Fox}}</ref> Once the scene ends, the power unexpectedly goes out, to which Stewie responds by asking \"What are we in, [[Iraq]]?\" Reminiscent of the previous ''Star Wars''-inspired episode, \"Blue Harvest\", Meg insists her father tell another story about ''Star Wars''.
