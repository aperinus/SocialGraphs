The film stars [[Joe Pesci]], [[Ralph Macchio]], [[Marisa Tomei]], [[Mitchell Whitfield]], [[Lane Smith]], [[Bruce McGill]], and [[Fred Gwynne]] (in his final film appearance). The film was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]] and released on March 13, 1992.\n\nTwo young [[New York (state)|New Yorkers]] traveling through rural [[Alabama]] are arrested and put on trial for a murder they did not commit, and a cousin, Vinny Gambini, a lawyer who had only recently passed the bar exam after five unsuccessful attempts, defends them. Much of the humor comes from the fish-out-of-water interaction between the brash [[Italians in New York City|Italian-American New Yorkers]] (Vinny and his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito) and the more reserved [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern townspeople]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=Joanna|title=My Cousin Vinny|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/v47k/my-cousin-vinny|website=Radio Times Limited|access-date=13 December 2018}}</ref> The principal location of filming was [[Monticello, Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=My Cousin Vinny Filming Locations|url=https://roadtripmemories.com/2015/01/11/my-cousin-vinny-filming-locations/|access-date=24 January 2021|website=Road Trip Memories}}</ref>\n\n''My Cousin Vinny'' was a critical and financial success, with Pesci, Gwynne, and Tomei praised for their performances. Tomei won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. Attorneys have also lauded the film for its accurate depiction of [[criminal procedure]] and trial strategy.\n\n==Plot==\nDriving through Alabama in their metallic mint-green 1964 [[Buick Skylark]] convertible, Bill Gambini and Stan Rothenstein, college students from New York who just got scholarships to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], shop at a Sac-O-Suds convenience store and accidentally shoplift a can of tuna. After they leave, the store clerk is robbed and killed, and Bill and Stan are arrested for the murder. Due to [[circumstantial evidence]] and a confession to the shoplifting that is misconstrued as one to the shooting, Bill is charged with [[first-degree murder]] and Stan as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]]. Bill's mother reminds him there is an attorney in the family: his cousin Vinny Gambini. Vinny travels to Alabama, accompanied by his fianc\u00e9e, Mona Lisa Vito. Although willing to take the case, Vinny is a [[personal injury lawyer]] from [[Brooklyn]], newly admitted to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] and with no trial experience.\n\nVinny manages to fool the trial judge, Chamberlain Haller, that he is experienced enough for the case.<ref>While meeting with Haller, Vinny claims to have successfully defended a suspect in the David Berkowitz murders, (referred to as \"the Son of Sam\" in the film). The judge was incredulous: \"The guy who took orders to kill from a dog?\"</ref> His ignorance of basic courtroom procedures and dress code, and his abrasive attitude, cause the judge to repeatedly hold him in [[Contempt of court|contempt]]. Much to his clients' consternation, Vinny does not [[Cross-examination|cross-examine]] any of the witnesses in the [[preliminary hearing]]. Except for lack of a murder weapon, it appears that the district attorney, Jim Trotter III, has a [[Prima facie|strong case]]. After Vinny's poor showing at the hearing, Stan fires him and uses the [[Public defender (United States)|public defender]], John Gibbons, and nearly convinces Bill to do the same. But in questioning the first witness, the public defender turns out to be extremely nervous, with a severe stutter, and his line of questioning actually assists the prosecution's case.\n\nDespite his missteps, Vinny makes up for his inexperience with an aggressive and perceptive questioning style. When he cross-examines the first witness, he uses his newfound knowledge of the cooking time of [[grits]] to force him to admit that his perception of time may have been inaccurate, meaning he cannot corroborate the prosecution's timeline, and Bill and Stan's faith is restored. Stan fires the public defender and rehires Vinny, who proceeds to discredit the next two witnesses by questioning their ability to make a positive identification due to obstructions in their sightline and impaired vision.\n\nOn the trial's third day, Trotter produces a surprise witness, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] analyst George Wilbur. Vinny immediately objects to the witness as Trotter failed to inform him properly ahead of time, but Haller overrules the objection. Wilbur testifies that the pattern and chemical analysis of the tire marks left at the crime scene are identical to the tires on Bill's Buick; in cross-examination Wilbur admits the tires on Bill's car are the most popular tires in America. Haller orders a lunch recess after Wilbur's testimony. Vinny asks for a full day's continuance to properly prepare for cross-examination, but Haller denies the request. With only the lunch recess to prepare and unable to come up with a strong line of questioning, Vinny lashes out at Lisa, but then realizes that one of her photos holds the key to the case: the flat and even tire marks going over the curb reveal that Bill's car could not have been used for the getaway.\n\nAfter requesting a records search from the local sheriff, Vinny drags an angry Lisa into court to testify as an expert witness, since she comes from a family of auto mechanics and has an encyclopedic knowledge of cars. During Vinny's questioning, Lisa testifies that only a car with an [[independent rear suspension]] and [[Limited-slip differential|Positraction]] could have made the tire marks, which rules out Bill's 1964 Buick Skylark. One model of car with these features is the similar-looking 1963 [[Pontiac Tempest]], and because both Buick and Pontiac are owned by [[General Motors|GM]], the Pontiac Tempest was also available in metallic mint-green. Vinny recalls Wilbur, who confirms this information, effectively discrediting his own testimony. He then recalls the local sheriff, who testifies that two men who fit Bill and Stan's descriptions were just arrested in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for driving a stolen metallic mint green Pontiac Tempest equipped with the same tires as Bill's car, and were in possession of a .357 magnum revolver which was the gun of the same [[caliber]] used to kill the clerk. After Vinny rests for the defense, Trotter dismisses all charges. The judge congratulates Vinny and, as they drive away, Vinny and Lisa bicker about their wedding plans.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Vinny Gambini\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as Bill Gambini\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Mona Lisa Vito\n* [[Mitchell Whitfield]] as Stan Rothenstein\n* [[Fred Gwynne]] as Judge Chamberlain Haller\n* [[Lane Smith]] as Jim Trotter III\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as John Gibbons\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Sheriff Dean Farley\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Sam Tipton\n* [[Paulene Myers]] as Constance Riley\n* [[Raynor Scheine]] as Ernie Crane\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as George Wilbur\n* [[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]] as J.T.\n* Michael Simpson as Neckbrace\n* Lou Walker as Grits Cook\n* Kenny Jones as Jimmy Willis\n}}\n\n==Development==\nScreenwriter [[Dale Launer]] came up with the idea for ''My Cousin Vinny'' as a college student, after hearing about a lawyer who had finally passed the bar after their 13th attempt. Launer thought it would be funny to have someone traveling through the Southern United States run into legal trouble and end up being represented by that type of lawyer.<ref name=\"rs oral\">{{cite magazine | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/my-cousin-vinny-oral-history-1302630/ | title = 'What Is a Yute?': An Oral History of 'My Cousin Vinny'|first=Andy|last=Greene|date=March 7, 2022|accessdate=March 20, 2022|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> Launer did not develop the concept until after he had written a few successful screenplays including ''[[Ruthless People]]'' and ''[[Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (film)|Dirty Rotten Scoundrels]]''. He was inspired by the comedy of [[Sam Kinison]], particularly his approach with hecklers, in developing Vinny, and he based the relationship between Vinny and his fianc\u00e9e on two dating friends who would argue frequently.<ref name=\"rs oral\"/> Launer also took a road trip through the south in which he got stuck in the mud and had repairs to fix his car, which became part of the script. He met an assistant district attorney who became the basis of the character of Jim Trotter, including casting [[Lane Smith]] for the role.<ref name=\"rs oral\"/> He spent several sessions with an attorney to review the process of legal trials, and learned from him that much of criminal court proceedings aren't taught in law school but come from practice, which worked well to serve for Vinny's character.<ref name=\"rs oral\"/>\n\nFor casting, the studio originally wanted [[Andrew Dice Clay]] for Vinny, but this did not work out. Other considerations included [[Danny DeVito]], [[Peter Falk]], [[Robert De Niro]], and [[Jim Belushi]], but save for De Niro, none of these were the Italian American they were looking for. They eventually went with [[Joe Pesci]], who had just finished ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'', was finishing filming in ''[[Goodfellas]]'', and was an ideal choice for the role.<ref name=\"rs oral\"/> For Mona Lisa, they had approached [[Lorraine Bracco]] and [[Carole Davis]], but both had passed. Director [[Jonathan Lynn]] auditioned several other actresses without luck, but found [[Marisa Tomei]] when he was invited to the set of ''[[Oscar (1991 film)|Oscar]]'' by [[John Landis]], where Tomei had a minor part. While Fox wanted an actress with more fame, they agreed to Tomei.<ref name=\"rs oral\"/> [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Will Smith]] were considered for the roles of Bill and Stan but, in both cases, there was concern related to the incarceration of a Jewish and Black person in the South, and [[Ralph Macchio]] and [[Mitchell Whitfield]] were hired instead.<ref name=\"rs oral\"/>\n\nExterior filming was done near the town of [[Greensboro, Georgia]], as to keep the film authentic to the South; the courthouse scenes were shot in a set in [[Covington, Georgia]], the same set used for ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]''.<ref name=\"rs oral\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''My Cousin Vinny'' was released in the United States on March 13, 1992.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nWith a budget of $11 million, ''My Cousin Vinny'' was more successful than anticipated, grossing $52,929,168 domestically and $11,159,384 internationally, bringing its overall worldwide total to $64,088,552.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office 'Player,' 'Vinny' Show Strength|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=12 May 1992|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-12/entertainment/ca-1669_1_weekend-box-office|access-date=27 October 2010|first=David J.|last=Fox}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 87%, based on 60 reviews.

Pendleton suffered from stuttering in his childhood before overcoming it; during filming he did not enjoy dredging up bad memories from his teenage years and, afterward, he was not pleased to be publicly associated with the character. In a 2022 interview, he said that he felt the role nearly ended his career, and, after receiving angry letters from stutterers, said he regretted agreeing to perform the role at all.
