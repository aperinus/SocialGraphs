Based on the 1898 novella ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' by the American novelist [[Henry James]], the screenplay was adapted by [[William Archibald (playwright)|William Archibald]] and [[Truman Capote]], who used Archibald's own [[The Innocents (play)|1950 stage play]]\u2014also titled ''The Innocents''\u2014as a primary source text. Its plot follows a governess who watches over two children and comes to fear that their large estate is haunted by ghosts and that the children are being [[spirit possession|possessed]].\n\nArchibald's original screenplay for ''The Innocents'' was based on the premise that the paranormal events depicted were legitimate. Displeased with Archibald's take on the material, director Jack Clayton appointed American writer Truman Capote to rework the script. Capote's rewrites incorporated psychological themes, resulting in a final work that suggests other alternatives to the plot. Filming took place partly on location at the Gothic mansion of [[Sheffield Park Garden|Sheffield Park]] in Sussex, with additional shoots occurring at [[Shepperton Studios]] in Surrey. Shot in [[CinemaScope]], ''The Innocents'' incorporated bold minimal lighting as well as [[deep focus]], employed by cinematographer [[Freddie Francis]] to achieve a distinctive\u2014and sometimes claustrophobic\u2014atmosphere. The film also pioneered the use of synthesised electronic sound created by [[Daphne Oram]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Hugh|title=Obituary: Daphne Oram|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 January 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/24/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries|access-date=6 November 2014}}</ref> Clayton was dissatisfied with the original score of the movie by French composer [[Georges Auric]] and requested some alteration. However, because Auric was not available due to health problems, Clayton turned to [[Lambert Williamson|W. Lambert Williamson]].\n\n''The Innocents'' received international distribution from the American film studio [[20th Century Fox]], and received its London premiere on 24 November 1961. It was released in the United States the following month on 15 December in Los Angeles and [[Christmas Day]] in New York City. The psychological underpinnings of the film's screenplay have resulted in it being the subject of numerous critical and scholarly essays, particularly in the area of [[film theory]]. Of the various film adaptations of James's work, ''The Innocents'' has received the most critical debate. It was selected by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as one of the 25 best [[horror film]]s ever made.<ref name=no11/>\n\n== Plot ==\nMiss Giddens applies for her first job as a governess. The wealthy bachelor uncle who interviews her is unconcerned with her lack of experience. He values his freedom to travel and socialise and unabashedly confesses that he has \"no room, mentally or emotionally\" for his niece and nephew. They were orphaned and left in his care as infants, and he keeps them at Bly, his large country estate. The previous governess, Mary Jessel, died suddenly less than a year ago. All he cares about is that Miss Giddens accept full responsibility for the children, never troubling him with whatever problems may arise.\n\nAt Bly, Miss Giddens is instantly taken with Flora, the niece. She also forges a friendship with Mrs. Grose, the kindly housekeeper. The boy, Miles, is away at boarding school, but soon returns to Bly after being expelled from school for being a \"bad influence\" on his peers. Mrs. Grose says she cannot imagine Miles misbehaving, and when Miss Giddens meets the boy herself, she too thinks his teachers must have exaggerated. He seems charming and mature \u2013 though perhaps too mature, with flirtatious flattery towards his governess.\n\nMiss Giddens soon grows disturbed by the children's occasional odd behaviours and secretiveness, and is bothered by disembodied voices and apparitions of a man and woman she witnesses in the house, whom Mrs. Grose identifies, from their descriptions, as Miss Jessel and Peter Quint, another deceased employee of the children's uncle. Mrs. Grose also reluctantly reveals that the two were in a relationship prior to their deaths. Miss Giddens concludes that the [[ghost]]s of Quint and Miss Jessel [[Spirit possession|possess the bodies]] of the children so they can physically continue their relationship. She is determined to rescue them from this possession.\n\nOne night, while left alone with Miles, Miss Giddens presses him to talk about the ghosts, and about why he was expelled from school. Initially, Miles is glib and evasive, but he eventually admits that he frightened the other boys with violence and vulgar language. Miss Giddens enjoins him to say who taught him this language and behaviour. Miles suddenly begins yelling obscene insults and laughing maniacally, and Quint's face appears in the window behind him, joining in the boy's laughter. Miles then runs outside; Miss Giddens follows, begging him to \"say his name.\" Quint appears on a hedge nearby, but Miles does not seem to see him. He finally shouts Quint's name, and Quint waves his hand. Miles grows still and falls to the ground. Miss Giddens cradles him and assures him that he is free. She then realises that Miles is dead. Sobbing, she leans over him and kisses him on the lips.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Deborah Kerr]] as Miss Giddens\n* [[Michael Redgrave]] as The Uncle\n* [[Peter Wyngarde]] as Peter Quint\n* [[Megs Jenkins]] as Mrs. Grose\n* [[Martin Stephens (actor)|Martin Stephens]] as Miles\n* [[Pamela Franklin]] as Flora\n* [[Clytie Jessop]] as Miss Mary Jessel\n* [[Isla Cameron]] as Anna\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\n''The Innocents'' has received attention from academics and  specialists in [[film theory]], beginning with the literary theorist [[Edmund Wilson]], who wrote extensively on the film's source novella, insisting that the supernatural phenomena were in fact the product of Miss Giddens' own [[sexual repression]].{{sfn|Slide|2013|p=103}} According to literary scholar [[Leonard Orr]], of the many adaptations of James's work, ''The Innocents'' has received the largest amount of critical attention.{{sfn|Orr|2009|p=86}}\n\nFilm scholar David J. Hogan reiterated the film's underlying themes of sexual repression becoming the focus of supernatural activity, and compared elements of the film to [[Robert Wise]]'s ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1963), based on ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'' by [[Shirley Jackson]].{{sfn|Hogan|2016|p=85}} Hogan also interprets the film's final scene as \"a perverse variation on the ''Sleeping Beauty'' story, as Kerr symbolically liberates the boy from a presumed possession with a kiss after he has fainted.\"{{sfn|Hogan|2016|pages=86\u20137}}\n\nIn the book ''Fifty Classic British Films, 1932-1982: A Pictorial Record'' (2013), film writer [[Anthony Slide]] noted: \"Through the use of shadows, oblique camera angles, and an atmospheric soundtrack, Jack Clayton not only captured the horror of James's story, but also its deeper sadness\u2014the children's isolation from the real world, the governess' problematic sexuality, and the curiously pitiful nature of the former governess, Miss Jessel.\"{{sfn|Slide|2013|p=103}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development ===\nThe original screenplay for ''The Innocents'' was adapted by playwright [[William Archibald (playwright)|William Archibald]] from his [[The Innocents (play)|1950 play of the same name]], which itself was based on Henry James's novella ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.{{sfn|Orr|2009|p=86}}{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|p=84}} In both his stage and screen adaptations, Archibald wrote under the assumption that the supernatural experiences of Miss Giddens were real, and that the ghosts she encountered were legitimate entities as opposed to figments of her imagination (a possibility left unresolved in James's original work).{{sfn|Orr|2009|p=86}} Archibald's interpretation of the source material was made clear in a denouement in the original draft of the script, which:\n\n{{blockquote|comprises a montage of images superimposed over [Miss Giddens's] reclining figure\u2014the cracked photograph of Quint, Quint on the tower, Flora's hand holding her pet tortoise, a musical box trilling \"O Willow Waly.\" The dream ends with Miss Giddens imagining how the children have been possessed by Miss Jessel...dancing in silhouette with Flora, Quint putting a possessive arm over Miles's shoulder, and Miss Giddens herself praying for deliverance to the sound of a chiming clock.{{sfn|Orr|2009|p=86}}}}\n\n[[File:Miles and Flora in The Innocents.png|thumb|right|upright=1.1|A key point of dispute between Clayton and screenwriter [[William Archibald (playwright)|William Archibald]] was whether the children (pictured) were conduits for malicious spirits, or the phenomena was the invention of the protagonist's mind]]\nDirector Jack Clayton envisioned a more ambiguous conclusion for the film: \"My original interest in the story was in the fact that one could tell it from a completely different point of view,\" he said. \"In other words\u2013evil was alive in the mind of the governess and in fact she more or less creates the situation. Now this was long before I read the notes on Henry James and found that somebody else also imagines that Henry James wrote it this way\u2014sort of almost [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] hallucinations the governess had.\"{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|p=92}}\n\nClayton was ultimately unhappy with Archibald's screenplay due to their conflicting interpretations of the material, and asked American writer [[Truman Capote]] (whom he had met while working on ''[[Beat the Devil (1953 film)|Beat the Devil]]''<ref name=cameron/>) to rework Archibald's script.<ref name=between/> At the time, Capote was in the middle of writing ''[[In Cold Blood]]''; however, because he was a fan of the James novella, he agreed, and took a three-week hiatus to rewrite the screenplay.{{sfn|Long|2008|p=79}} Capote introduced the Freudian symbolism that is prominently highlighted in the relationships and visual compositions of the film, with implications that the supernatural phenomena experienced by Miss Giddens is a result of her own sexual repression and paranoias rather than legitimate paranormal experiences.{{sfn|Vincendeau|2001|p=87}} Clayton later brought in writer [[John Mortimer]] to give the dialogue a \"Victorian\" polish.{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|p=91}} Clayton intended to maintain a sense of claustrophobia and, at the same time, open up the play, which took place entirely in the drawing room of the house. Clayton saw the house as one of the characters in the film and used it as such to highlight certain scenes.\n\nCultural critic [[Christopher Frayling]] attributes approximately 90% of the film's script as it appears on the screen to Capote (The final credits attribute the screenplay to Archibald and Capote, with Mortimer receiving credit for \"Additional Scenes and Dialogue\"). Frayling also notes a [[Southern Gothic]] feel present in Capote's script alterations \u2013 particularly with the governess's repressed erotic sensibility counterpointed by shots of lush and decaying plants and rapacious insect life. Director Clayton, though, chose to downplay this aspect in the finished film, to preserve the ambiguity between the ghost story and Freudian element.{{efn|This paragraph is derived from Christopher Frayling's commentary and the filmed introduction on the [[British Film Institute]] (Region 2) DVD released in 2006.}}\n\nAn unreliable narrator was originally intended to feature in the narrative and the film was to open with a funeral scene.{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|p=94}} There are stills of the scene that circulated at the time, but Clayton ultimately elected to open the film with darkness, a song sung by a little girl, and the image of Kerr's hands that are clasped in prayer, with her rosary between her fingers, as she murmurs and sobs.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Province]]|title=Brigitte takes to perfume|last=Kilgallen|first=Dorothy|author-link=Dorothy Kilgallen|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/32439836/the_province/|page=26|date=30 November 1961|location=Vancouver, British Columbia|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Gradually Kerr's face is highlighted. According to film scholar Frayling, the opening scene creates a sense of intimacy and, perhaps, trust that the governess should be trusted, but the use of darkness surrounding her suggests that it is possible that the story that follows could be nothing more than in her own mind \u2013 isolated and creating its own supernatural world.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite AV media|title=The Innocents|people=Frayling, Christopher|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|medium=Blu-ray [[audio commentary]]|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nDeborah Kerr was cast in the lead role of Miss Giddens at the counsel of the film's studio and distributor, [[20th Century Fox]], despite the fact that the governess character in James's original work was twenty years old (Kerr was forty at the time).{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|p=88}} On discussing the part with Clayton, Kerr recalled: \"I remember asking Jack what he wanted me to stress in playing the part, and he replied, \"You play it the way you feel, but don't forget the ambiguity!\" So I tried the very nervous tight-rope between sanity and insanity, and left the audience to exercise its intelligence.\"{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|p=88}} Kerr's role in the film is significant, as she appears onscreen in approximately 95 minutes of the film's 99 minute runtime.<ref name=cameron>{{cite news|work=[[New York Daily News]]|last=Cameron|first=Kate|location=New York City, New York|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/32440280/daily_news/|title=Kerr Stars in Ghost Tale|page=251|date=24 December 1961|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> She was paid [[United States dollar|US$]]400,000 for her work in the film.<ref>{{cite news|date=25 December 1961|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/32441334/the_philadelphia_inquirer/|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|last=Sylvester|first=Robert|page=19|title=Deborah Kerr...|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\nFor the roles of the children, Clayton cast eleven-year-old [[Pamela Franklin]] (in her film debut) as Flora,{{sfn|Cotter|2013|p=79}} and [[Martin Stephens (actor)|Martin Stephens]] as her brother, Miles; Stephens had featured in the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] horror film ''[[Village of the Damned (1960 film)|Village of the Damned]]'' (1960).<ref>{{cite book|title=Directory of World Cinema Britain: Directory of World Cinema Britain |editor=Mitchell, Neil|year=2015|volume=2|page=133|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn= 978-1-783-20397-0}}</ref> Australian-born actress [[Clytie Jessop]] was cast as the spectral Miss Jessel (also in her film debut),{{sfn|Cotter|2013|p=109}} while [[Peter Wyngarde]] was cast in the role of Quint, Miss Jessel's illicit lover.{{sfn|Slide|2013|p=103}} Though he receives top billing, [[Michael Redgrave]] appears only in the beginning of the film in a cameo role as the children's uncle.<ref name=tcm/>\n\nOn 19 September 2013, Wyngarde and Jessop were interviewed by [[Matthew Sweet (writer)|Matthew Sweet]] for a special episode of ''[[Night Waves]]'' dedicated to the film as part of the [[BBC Radio 3]] programme ''Sound of Cinema''.

During the interview, Wyngarde stated that [[Alec Guinness]] and [[Cary Grant]] had expressed a strong interest in playing the role of Peter Quint.

For the first 45 seconds of the film, the screen is black and singing is heard, and only after this do the credits appear. Clayton, who had previously made films associated with the [[British New Wave]], took on the project specifically to avoid being typecast as a New Wave director, and to work in a different genre.{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|pages=10, 59\u201360}}\n\nFilming of ''The Innocents'' took place primarily at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[Surrey]].<ref name=stafford>{{cite web|author=Stafford, Jeff|title=The Innocents|series=Classic Horror|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|url= https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/79253/the-innocents#film-details |access-date=27 October 2022}}</ref> Interior sequences were shot on sound stages at Shepperton, as well as the sequences which took place in the greenhouse veranda; a fa\u00e7ade for Bly house was also built by the art department on the studio lot.<ref name=between/> On-location exterior scenes were shot at the Gothic mansion of [[Sheffield Park Garden|Sheffield Park]] in East [[Sussex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/i/Innocents.php |title=Filming locations for The Innocents (1961), in East Sussex.|first=Tony|last=Reeves|access-date=27 October 2022|work=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations}}</ref> To ensure that his [[child actor]]s' performances remained uninhibited, Clayton withheld the full details of the story from Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin, who only received those parts of the script that lacked the surprising and mysterious adult elements of the film.<ref name=\"auto\"/> According to script supervisor Pamela Mann, star Deborah Kerr was specifically attuned to making sure the children \"had fun on set\".<ref name=between/> Writer Truman Capote was present during the first several weeks of filming, writing additional dialogue for Stephens and Franklin, and making minor script alterations.<ref name=between/>\n\n20th Century Fox insisted that ''The Innocents'' be shot in [[CinemaScope]], while Clayton wanted to shoot it in standard academy ratio,{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|p=82}} feeling that he would be unable to make use of the additional space on both sides of the frame.<ref name=bailey>{{cite AV media|title=Interview with John Bailey|people=Bailey, John|work=The Innocents|medium=Blu-ray interview|publisher=The Criterion Collection|year=2014}}</ref> Cinematographer [[Freddie Francis]] insisted that he could work with the CinemaScope [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], having shot ''[[Sons and Lovers (film)|Sons and Lovers]]'' (1960) for director [[Jack Cardiff]] in the format.

Francis used [[deep focus]] and narrowly aimed the lighting towards the centre of the screen.{{sfn|Landis|2011|p=110}} It was so bright on set in that area that actress Kerr arrived to the set wearing sunglasses one day.<ref name=auto/> Francis and Clayton framed the film in an unusually bold style, with characters prominent at the edge of the frame and their faces at the centre in profile in some sequences, which, again, created both a sense of intimacy and unease, based on the lack of balance in the image.<ref name=bailey/> For many of the interior night scenes, Francis painted the sides of the lenses with black paint to allow for a more intense, \"elegiac\" focus,<ref name=bailey/>{{sfn|Hogan|2016|p=87}} and used candles custom-made with four to five wicks twined together to produce more light.<ref name=between/>\n\nDuring principal photography, Clayton and editor [[Jim Clark (film editor)|Jim Clark]]\u2014whom he had hired on the recommendation of his colleague Jimmy Ware, editor of Clayton's first feature, ''Room At The Top''\u2014would meet each evening and view the footage shot that day, assembling daily [[rough cut]]s as they progressed; this allowed Clayton to make adjustments and shoot [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]]s along the way, giving him closer supervision during the filming process.<ref name=between/>\n\n===Post-production===\n====Editing====\n[[File:The_Innocents_cross-dissolve_screen_capture.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Editor Jim Clark manually crafted elaborate [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|cross dissolves]] in post-production, merging as many as four images in a single frame<ref name=between>{{cite AV media|title=Between Horror, Fear, and Beauty|year=2014|publisher=The Criterion Collection|people=[[Jim Clark (film editor)|Clark, Jim]]; [[Freddie Francis|Francis, Freddie]]; Mann, Pamela|medium=Blu-ray documentary}}</ref>]]\nIn his 2010 memoir ''Dream Repairman'', Jim Clark recalled his work as editor on ''The Innocents'' as \"a true collaboration\" and that he and Clayton became close friends and regular drinking partners during production, since both were single at the time, and lived near each other. He described ''The Innocents'' as \"a real pleasure to edit, since Jack had a very certain approach to his material, having worked out everything beforehand. He was a perfectionist who left nothing to chance, and was very precise in his approach to work.\"{{sfn|Clark|2010|p=78}}\n\nInspired by George Stevens' ''[[A Place in the Sun (1951 film)|A Place in the Sun]]'', Clark crafted numerous [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]] and superimpositions, which he also described as \"mini montages\", in which he edited the cross-fades between certain scenes to run four or five times longer than the standard \"mix\", and often blended in a third, near-subliminal image; film scholar Anthony Slide would later refer to the film's use of dissolves as \"obsessive\".{{sfn|Slide|2013|p=103}} Clark achieved this process by using blank film rolls as a template on which he would manually assign Clayton's film negatives with hand-marked reel numbers, slate numbers, and time stamps indicating the duration each image should remain within a single frame.<ref name=between/> Clayton explained in later interviews that he felt the dissolves entirely appropriate and in accordance with his vision of the film as \"mood-oriented\", adding: \"It gave me opportunities to explore this field, which I had never done before: to create in those multiple dissolves images which hang there, and have a meaning which applies both to the end of the last scene and the beginning of the next.\"{{sfn|Slide|2013|p=103}}\n\nClayton maintained close supervision over the editing of the film, specifically making sure that no single scene ran too long; because of the film's small cast, Clayton worried that \"if [the film] sags, we've got no other characters to go to\".{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|p=94}} According to Clark, Clayton went through \"a lot of anguish\" over the final scene, in which Miles dies in Miss Giddens' arms, and that the director was \"quite prone to agonizing over scenes if he was uncertain of them, and we would run them over and over again, hardly changing a frame, until he felt reconciled to the sequence.\" Clayton felt the climactic scene should be \"claustrophobic and played very close\u2014developing into violence and savagery\".{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|p=104}} Clark also revealed that, despite their previously harmonious working relationship, he unexpectedly fell out with Clayton just before the film was released, and felt that he had allowed himself to become too close to his director. Clark recalled that on the evening of the pre-release critics' screening, Clayton went into a rage because, through no fault of her own, his personal assistant Jeanie Sims was late in phoning him with the critics' reactions. When Sims called Clark to Clayton's office the next day, he discovered that Clayton had completely smashed a large plaster scale model of Bly House, and was refusing to speak to either of them. In spite of this rift, Clark and Clayton gradually repaired their friendship, and Clayton subsequently invited Clark to edit his next film, ''[[The Pumpkin Eater]]''.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Guardian|title=Jim Clark obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/13/jim-clark-obituary|author=Bergan, Ronald|date=13 March 2016|access-date=9 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Music and sound design====\nThe original score for ''The Innocents'' was composed by [[Georges Auric]], who had scored several films Clayton had been involved with in the past, such as ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' (1952) and ''[[The Bespoke Overcoat]]'' (1956).{{sfn|Sinyard|2000|p=92}} Clayton was dissatisfied with Auric's final score for ''The Innocents'', and requested he make alterations; however, Auric was unable to do so because of his ailing health, and re-orchestration was completed by W.
