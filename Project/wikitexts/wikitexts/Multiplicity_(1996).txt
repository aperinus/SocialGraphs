It was based on Chris Miller's short story 'Multiplicity', published in ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' magazine, Spring 1993.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} The film was co-produced and directed by [[Harold Ramis]]. The original music score was composed by [[George Fenton]].\n\nThe film was released July 17, 1996. It received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed a worldwide total of $21 million at the box office, significantly less than its $45 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nDoug Kinney works in construction in  [[Los Angeles]] and his job is constantly getting in the way of his family. Working on a new wing of a scientific facility, Doug meets Dr. Leeds, a friendly scientist who has successfully developed a method for [[human cloning|cloning humans]]. He is introduced to Dr. Leeds' clone as proof. Sympathetic to Doug's troubles, he clones him so the clone can take over for Doug at work, while the original tries to spend quality time with his family. The clone, called \"Two\" (although he calls himself \"Lance\"), has all of Doug's memories and knowledge, but personality-wise is an exaggeration of Doug's masculine side.\n\nDoug goes to great lengths to keep his clone a secret. While he and his wife Laura are at a restaurant for dinner, he sees Two on his own date (as he cannot be with Laura). Doug begins to worry about his clone being revealed.\n\nDespite the complications of having a clone, Lance is extremely busy at work so Doug has another made to help out at home. \"Three\", who calls himself \"Rico\", is an exaggeration of Doug's feminine side. He is extremely sensitive and thoughtful and loves to cook and take care of the house, much to Lance's chagrin.\n\nLance and Rico attempt to make another clone, \"Four\", who is later named Lenny. Unfortunately, since he is a clone-of-a-clone, his intelligence is considerably lower than that of his predecessors, and he refers to Doug as \"Steve\". (The analogy used refers to how [[generation loss|a copy of a copy may not be as 'sharp' as the original]]). This causes an annoyed Doug to decree that no more clones be created.\n\nDoug decides to take some time off, going on a sailing trip.  He doesn't want Laura to know, so he has his clones step in for him while he's away. Although he specifically instructs them that Laura is off limits, while he is gone each of the clones, in turn, run into Laura. Despite their best efforts to follow instructions, she persists and eventually has sex with all three of them, thinking they are Doug.\n\nThe next day, Lance has a [[common cold|cold]] and is unable to go to work, so he sends Rico. During an inspection on site, Rico's lack of knowledge about the current construction site annoys the inspector, which leads to Doug losing his job.\n\nAs time passes, Doug's wife becomes increasingly upset with her husband's erratic behavior and how he has no memories of discussions Laura unwittingly had with another clone. Thinking Doug is ignoring her, she reveals her feelings to Lenny, mentioning how Doug has never kept his promise to fix up the house. When she asks him what he wants, an inattentive Lenny replies, \"I want pizza\". Upset, she takes the children and moves back to her parents' home. When Doug returns, he learns that Laura and the kids have left. He also learns from the clones' confessions that he has lost his job and each one of them has had sex with Laura.\n\nWhile Doug tries to determine how to get Laura back, Lenny tells him that Laura said he never fixed the house. With the help of the clones, Doug remodels their home and wins back the love of his wife. He also tells her he is planning to start his own contracting business. Realizing Doug can take care of himself now, the three clones move away. As they are driving away and stopped at a stoplight, Laura sees the three clones in the car next to her. Believing that she is [[hallucination|hallucinating]], Laura tells her children that you can tell you really love someone when everyone you see reminds you of them.\n\nThe clones write to Doug that they have set up a successful [[pizzeria]] called \"Three Guys from Nowhere\" in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] and are masquerading as triplets. Lance becomes the businessman of the shop and serves customers, enjoying this opportunity to meet many women. Rico is the head [[chef]] and is \"cooking up a storm and having a ball\", and Lenny is the [[delivery boy]] as well as taking a second job as a [[paperboy (newspaper delivery)|paperboy]]. Unfortunately, Lenny confuses the two and is seen delivering pizzas by throwing a box onto a lawn as he rides his bike by.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as Doug Kinney\n** \"Two\"/Lance\n** \"Three\"/Rico\n** \"Four\"/Lenny\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Laura Kinney\n* Zack Duhame as Zack Kinney\n* Katie Schlossberg as Jennifer Kinney\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Dr. Leeds\n* [[Richard Masur]] as Del King\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Vic\n* [[Ann Cusack]] as Noreen\n* [[John de Lancie]] as Ted Gray\n* [[Judith Kahan]] as Franny\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Walt\n* [[Obba Babatund\u00e9]] as Paul\n* [[Julie Bowen]] as Robin\n* Dawn Maxey as Beth\n* Kari Coleman as Patti\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was released July 17 and ranked 7th at the box office that weekend. The film was not a success at the box office, earning a total of $21,075,014 less than half of its $45 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |title=Multiplicity |url= https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=multiplicity.htm |website= [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref> The [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] was blamed for the poor opening weekend, and ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' held on to the number one position. John Krier, head of Exhibitor Relations disagreed that the Olympics were to blame, instead saying competition from other films were the cause since total grosses were the same as the previous year.
