November 2006. {{ISSN|1541-4817}}</ref> A direct sequel to the first ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist (TV series)|Fullmetal Alchemist]]'' television series which loosely adapted from the original [[manga]] [[Fullmetal Alchemist|series of the same name]] by [[Hiromu Arakawa]] and published by [[Square Enix]], the film follows the story of alchemist [[Edward Elric]] as he attempts to return to his homeworld, having lived for two years in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], while his younger brother [[Alphonse Elric|Alphonse]] is also trying to reunite with him by any means necessary. Edward's search attracts the attention of the [[Thule Society]], which seeks to enter his homeworld, believing it to be [[Shambhala|Shamballa]], to obtain new weapons to help them in [[World War II]].\n\n''Conqueror of Shamballa'' premiered in Japan on July 23, 2005. A CD soundtrack has also been published featuring music from the film developed by [[Michiru Oshima]] and [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]]. In Japan, it has been edited in a standard DVD, as well as in a limited edition. It was later licensed in North America by [[Funimation]] that featured the film in cinemas for a short time, and also released it on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nMost of the staff from the first ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' [[anime]] started development on ''Conqueror of Shamballa'' shortly after the anime's ending. The original script had to be shortened to fit the film's length of 105 minutes. During its premiere in Japan, ''Conqueror of Shamballa'' remained as one of the most popular films in the year. Critical reaction to the film has commonly been positive, with reviews praising the film's story and animation used.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|Fullmetal Alchemist (TV series)#Plot{{!}}Plot of Fullmetal Alchemist}}\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nAfter [[Edward Elric]] recovers his arm and his brother [[Alphonse Elric|Alphonse]]'s body, Edward is dragged from his homeworld through the Gate of Alchemy\u2014the source of alchemical energy\u2014to a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] of [[Earth]] in 1923. The world is fundamentally governed by the laws of [[History of science|modern science]] instead of alchemy. When Edward arrives there, he discovers that he has been stripped of his alchemical powers and his newly restored arm and leg.\n\nTwo years later, in [[Munich]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], Edward researches [[rocket]]ry with his friend Alfons Heiderich, a young man who resembles Alphonse, in the hopes of returning to his world. Edward rescues a persecuted [[Romani people|Romani]] woman named Noah from being sold. Noah, who resembles Ed's friend [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Ros\u00e9 Thomas|Ros\u00e9]], is taken in by Edward to live with him and Alfons, and begins having visions concerning Edward's life in his world. The next day, Edward meets [[Fritz Lang]], a [[Jews|Jewish]] film director resembling [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#King Bradley|King Bradley]], who persuades Edward into helping him hunt down a dragon he has been seeking for inspiration for his next film. The dragon, which turns out to be homunculus [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Envy|Envy]], attacks Edward, but is then weakened and captured by members of the [[Thule Society]].\n\nThe Thule Society, led by [[Karl Haushofer]] and Dietlinde Eckhart, use Envy and Edward's kidnapped father [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Van Hohenheim|Hohenheim]] as catalysts to open a portal to Edward's world, believing it to be the utopia [[Shambhala|Shamballa]] after learning about it from Hohenheim. A number of armored soldiers are sent through the portal, only to emerge on the other side in the city of Liore as mutated zombie-like creatures. Alphonse, who is visiting Liore, fights off the armored soldiers and merges parts of his soul to three of their suits to aid him in combat. Meanwhile, Edward breaks into the Thule Society headquarters and accidentally reopens the portal, returning the dead armored soldiers to Earth and allowing Alphonse's armored form to briefly reunite with his brother before his soul returns to his body, increasing Edward's determination to return to his world.\n\nAlphonse is guided by the homunculus [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Wrath|Wrath]] to the underground city beneath Amestris' Central City to reopen the Gate of Alchemy. There, they are attacked by the homunculus [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Gluttony|Gluttony]], who fights and mortally wounds Wrath. At Wrath's insistence, Alphonse transmutes and sacrifices the two homunculi to use as material to open the Gate. Meanwhile, in Munich, the Thule Society persuades Noah into guiding them on how to correctly open the Gate based on what she had learned from reading Edward's mind. Edward learns from Lang that the Thule Society plans to use the weapons from his world to help [[Adolf Hitler]] in his [[Beer Hall Putsch|attempt to start a revolution]], and heads to stop them. Hohenheim and Envy are both transmuted at the same time that Alphonse transmutes Gluttony and Wrath. With the Gate opened, Eckhart leads a fleet into the other world, where she gains the ability to use alchemy. However, she begins to go mad with power and fear of her new surroundings and launches an attack on Central City. Alfons launches Edward in a rocket-powered plane to return him to his world before being gunned down.\n\nEdward appears in his world, reunited with Alphonse and their friend [[Winry Rockbell]], who fits Edward with new automail limbs. The Amestris military manages to stop most of Eckhart's soldiers with the help of [[Roy Mustang]]. Edward battles Eckhart before Alphonse transmutes parts of his soul to a group of armors, which attack her and force her to retreat. Upon reappearing in her own world, Eckhart is covered with shadow creatures from the Gate and killed by an officer out of alarm of her new, monstrous appearance. Understanding the danger posed by the connection between the two worlds, Edward returns to Earth to seal the Gate on the other side, knowing he will be trapped there forever. Instead of sealing the Gate on the other world's side as per Edward's request, however, Alphonse has Mustang seal the Gate and follows Edward to remain with his brother. Following Alfons' funeral, Edward and Alphonse leave Munich with Noah, intending to destroy the weapons meant to be used in Hitler's attack and make their new home a safer place. Back in Risembool, as Ros\u00e9's children play, Winry remembers the Elric brothers.\n\n==New characters==\n{{See also|List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters}}\n;{{Nihongo|Alfons Heiderich|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30b9\u30fb\u30cf\u30a4\u30c7\u30ea\u30d2|Arufonsu Haiderihi}}<ref name=\"Mullin 2006 p1\"/><!-- Quote: \"Aside from Alfons, who resembles Al, we got Noah, who looks like Rose, as well as Fritz Lang, who looks like King Bradley.\" -->\n:{{anime voices|[[Shun Oguri]]|[[Jason Liebrecht]]}}\n:A young German [[rocket]] scientist who Edward befriends some time after arriving in Munich. He is similar in name and appearance to Edward's brother, Alphonse. He is easygoing and enjoys listening to Edward's stories of his homeworld, and while he doubts whether or not they are true and is hurt by how distant Edward behaves, he is nonetheless supportive of his efforts. He suffers from a fatal [[respiratory disease|lung disease]] and hopes to make a difference for the world before he dies.

She is an ambitious young woman who desires to open the gate to Edward's world, believing it to be the utopia \"Shamballa\", so that she may harness the powers and weapons of that world and overthrow Hitler in contrast to her organization's goal to support the Nazi Party. Upon seizing leadership of the Thule Society and entering the other world, however, her lust for power and shallow understanding of alchemy cause her to gradually go mad with fear of her new surroundings and try to destroy Amestris' capital of Central City. When she is forced back into her world, she is covered with shadow creatures from the Gate of Truth and takes on a fearsome appearance, leading her to be shot to death by an officer resembling [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Maes Hughes|Maes Hughes]].\n\n;{{Nihongo|Noah|\u30ce\u30fc\u30a2|N\u014da}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Miy\u016b Sawai]]|[[Leah Clark]]}}\n:A young traveling [[Romani people|Romani]] girl who Edward saves from being sold to the Thule Society. On the surface, she is proud of her heritage and lifestyle, but is unable to bear being discriminated for it. She has the ability to read the minds of others, and becomes fascinated with Edward's world after witnessing his memories of it. Believing she wouldn't be discriminated in Edward's world, Noah assists the Thule Society in opening the Gate based on information from Edward's memories, but relents once Edward points out that his home is no utopia, and leaves Munich together with the Elric brothers. She is also similar in appearance to Rose, a character from the original anime.\n\nSeveral historic figures appear in supporting roles including [[Fritz Lang]] (physically based on King Bradley), [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Karl Haushofer]], and [[Adolf Hitler]]. The Earth counterparts of [[Maes Hughes]] and his wife Gracia appear in supporting roles, along with cameos from other characters.\n\n==Production==\nProduction of the film began shortly after the television series finishing its original broadcasting on Japanese channels, although pre-production started during the show's run in March 2004. The film's production was led by director [[Seiji Mizushima]], who also had directed the series as well. Mizushima allowed a camera crew and interviewers into the show's conference room at the Bones studios where he described how production went, as seen in a special feature on the DVD release of the film. The conference room was filled with every cut and drawing created for the show and movie, but it was eventually cleared out to make room for other projects.<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video | people=Mizushima, Seiji|date=2006|title=The Making of Fullmetal Alchemist: The Movie| medium=DVD|publisher=[[Funimation]]}}</ref>\n\nThe original draft of the film's [[Screenplay|script]] was written by Sho Aikawa at a hundred pages long, making the film over three hours long. Mizushima and others had to cut a third of the script's scenes out in order to make the film an appropriate length. Some scenes and characters were removed from the final cut, including a character named Steiner who could see auras, having a role similar to Noah's. A scene which was cut involved characters [[Roy Mustang]] and [[Winry Rockbell]] meeting in front of the late [[Maes Hughes]]' grave. By October 2004, the script was completed and the pre-check [[storyboard]]s were produced. The pre-check storyboards showed the movements of objects and characters in each shot along with the characters' lines. Production on the proper storyboards began in November of the same year, but the schedule in producing the film was immensely busy, so the directors of the film split the storyboards into six sections, one for each of the directors to create.<ref name=\"dvd\"/>\n\nThe opening and ending scenes were drawn by Mizushima; the scene involving the debut of the film's villain was drawn by Soichi Masui; the middle section of the film was drawn by Shingo Kaneko; Edward Elric's return to his homeworld was drawn by Masahiro Ando; action scenes were drawn by [[Shinji Aramaki]]; and the battle between Wrath and Gluttony was drawn by Yutaka Nakamura. Mizushima was repeatedly harassed by the head employees at [[Aniplex]] to speed up work on the storyboards. The artwork for the film was produced once Kaneko was finished and cel-animation was used to produce several characters or items in the film. Seven hundred of the film's animated frames had to be redone with only two weeks to the film's release.<ref name=\"dvd\"/>\n\nA trailer was produced for the film in December 2004 with [[Romi Park]], the voice actor for Edward Elric, narrating it. Three posters were produced for the film, two teaser posters and a third for the release of the film. A \"Fullmetal Festival\" was held on December 26, 2004 to celebrate the show and film. Most of the directors finished their assigned storyboards by February 2005 except Shingo Kaneko, who was taking longest due to the general slow process, but his storyboards were nevertheless impressive.<ref name=\"dvd\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe film score was composed by [[Michiru Oshima]]. [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]] gave two of their new songs for the film's opening and closing credits, \"[[Link (L'Arc-en-Ciel song)|Link]]\" and \"[[Awake (L'Arc-en-Ciel album)|LOST HEAVEN]]\", respectively. The film's orchestral music was performed by the Moscow Orchestra. \"KELAS [LET'S-DANCE],\" the song performed by the [[Romani people|Romani]] women while Edward and Heiderich hitch a ride, was composed by [[Ferenc Sn\u00e9tberger]] (who also played guitar for the song), with vocals by Tayo Awosusi. A soundtrack CD of the film, ''Fullmetal Alchemist The Movie Conqueror Of Shamballa OST'', which contained forty-six tracks, was released on July 20, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=SVWC-7270|title=Theatrical Feature Fullmetal Alchemist The Conqueror of Shambala - Original Soundtrack|publisher=CDJapan|access-date=April 6, 2008}}</ref> Single CDs of the songs \"Link\" and \"LOST HEAVEN\" have also been released by L'Arc-en-Ciel near the film's premier.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0009UVAEQ/|title=Link Single Maxi|language=ja|access-date=July 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0009IH16Y/|title=Awake|language=ja|access-date=July 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Release and distribution==\nThe film premiered in Japan on July 23, 2005.<ref name=\"box\"/> The Japanese DVD as well as the [[Universal Media Disc]] were released on January 25, 2006.<ref>{{cite web| title=\u5287\u5834\u7248 \u92fc\u306e\u932c\u91d1\u8853\u5e2b \u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d0\u30e9\u3092\u5f81\u304f\u8005 (UMD Video)|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B000C0XOR4/|language=ja|access-date=July 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=\u5287\u5834\u7248 \u92fc\u306e\u932c\u91d1\u8853\u5e2b \u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d0\u30e9\u3092\u5f81\u304f\u8005 (DVD)|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B000C0XOQU/|language=ja|access-date=July 2, 2009}}</ref> A limited edition including with a special box, English subtitles and a series of other extras was published on the same date.<ref>{{cite web| title=\u5287\u5834\u7248 \u92fc\u306e\u932c\u91d1\u8853\u5e2b\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d0\u30e9\u3092\u5f81\u304f\u8005 \u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u7523\u9650\u5b9a\u7248 \u30d7\u30ec\u30df\u30a2\u30e0DVD BOX|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0002U8NR0/|language=ja|access-date=July 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSome promotional activity was done before the film was already gone from theaters.
