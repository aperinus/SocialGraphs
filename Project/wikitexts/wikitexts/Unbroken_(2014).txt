It is based on the 2010 non-fiction book by [[Laura Hillenbrand]], ''[[Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption]]''. The film stars [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]] as [[United States at the Olympics|American Olympian]] and Army officer [[Louis Zamperini|Louis \"Louie\" Zamperini]] and [[Miyavi]] as [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) corporal [[Mutsuhiro Watanabe]]. Zamperini survived in a raft for 47 days after his bomber ditched in the ocean during the [[Second World War]], before being captured by the Japanese and being sent to a series of [[prisoner of war]] camps.\n\nFilming took place in Australia from October 2013 to February 2014. ''Unbroken'' had its [[film premiere|world premiere]] in [[Sydney]] on November 17, 2014, followed by a [[London]] premiere at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on November 26, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/angelina-jolie-dazzled-at-the-london-premiere-of-unbroken/|title=Angelina Jolie Dazzled at The London Premiere of Unbroken|last=Alvarez|first=Joe|date=November 26, 2014|work=IKON London Magazine|access-date=March 8, 2018}}</ref> The film was released in the United States on December 25, 2014. It received mixed reviews from critics, though praise was given to O'Connell's performance, Deakins' cinematography and sound and Jolie's direction. It was a financial success, grossing $163 million worldwide. The film was followed by a sequel, ''[[Unbroken: Path to Redemption]]'', in 2018.\n\n== Plot==\nDuring an April 1943 bombing mission against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-held island of [[Nauru]], [[Louis Zamperini|Louis \"Louie\" Zamperini]] is flying as a [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] of a [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[B-24 Liberator]] when his plane is damaged in combat and a number of the crew injured. The pilot brings the aircraft to a stop at the end of the runway despite an exploded tire.\n\nIn a flashback to his early youth as an Italian-American boy in [[Torrance, California]], Louie misbehaves by stealing, drinking liquor and smoking. He is often picked on by others for his Italian ethnicity. His brother Peter, seeing how fast Louie runs, trains him to be a runner. Louie becomes a disciplined distance runner, earning the nickname \"The Torrance Tornado\". Louie finishes 8th in the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] and sets a record in the final lap for the [[5000 metres|5,000-meter]] race.\n\nReturning to his 1943 combat service, Louie leaves with some of the surviving crew and several replacements on a search-and-rescue mission with an old plane. One engine fails and the aircraft ultimately crashes in the ocean. Louie survives alongside two others, Phil and Mac, floating on two inflatable rafts.\n\nOn their 27th day adrift, they attract the attention of a Japanese fighter plane, which strafes and damages the rafts but fortunately misses them. Mac dies six days later. On the 47th day, Japanese sailors find and capture Louie and Phil. Now [[Japanese war crimes#Forced labor|prisoners of war]], Louie and Phil are imprisoned on [[Kwajalein Atoll]]. The American airmen are interrogated for info on newer bombers and the [[Norden bombsight]]. Louie states they flew older models and draws a rendering of a [[Philco]] radio. They are dragged out to disrobe and kneel on planks, expecting to be executed. Instead, they are crudely washed and shipped to Japan. Upon arrival, they are sent to different POW camps.\n\nAt camp \u014cmori, in [[Tokyo]], Louis and his fellow POWs are the responsibility of Japanese corporal [[Mutsuhiro Watanabe]] who is especially hard on Louie, beating him often. Louie is given an opportunity to broadcast a message home saying he is alive after learning the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] classified him as [[Killed in action|KIA]]. As he refuses to broadcast another message full of anti-American propaganda, he is sent back to camp, where Watanabe has each prisoner punch him.\n\nAfter two years, Watanabe is promoted to Sergeant and leaves the camp. The camp is damaged when [[bombing of Tokyo|Tokyo was bombed]], so Louie and the others are moved to Naoetsu prison camp. Here, Watanabe is again in command but has now been promoted to Sergeant, so he supervises the prisoners at work loading coal barges. Louie pauses during work and is punished by Watanabe making him lift a large wooden beam and hold it over his head. He orders a guard to shoot him if he drops it, but Louie defiantly holds it up despite his exhaustion. This enrages Watanabe as Louie stares him straight in the eye, provoking him to beat him severely.\n\nAt the end of the war, Louie and the other POWs are liberated when [[American occupation of Japan|the Americans occupy Japan]] just as a bomber flies overhead and confirms that the war is over. Louie tries to find Watanabe in his quarters but sees he has already fled. He sits down, staring at a picture of Watanabe as a child alongside his father. He is returned home to America, where he kisses the ground on arriving home.\n\nAt the end of the film, there is a slideshow of the real Louie and the events in his life following the war: He married and had two children. Phil too survived and married. Mutsuhiro \"The Bird\" Watanabe went into hiding and evaded prosecution despite being on the top 40 most-wanted Japanese [[war crime|war criminals]] list by [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur]]. Louie lived out his promise to [[Religious conversion|convert]] to Christianity, to devote his life to [[God]] and to forgive his wartime captors, meeting with many of them. Many years later, however, Watanabe still refused to meet with Louie.\n\nLouie had an opportunity to relive his time as an Olympian when he ran a leg of the Olympic Torch relay for the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]], Japan. He was four days short of his 81st birthday, on a stretch not far from one of the POW camps where he was held. The closing titles reveal that Louie Zamperini died on July 2, 2014, at the age of 97.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]] as [[Louis Zamperini|Capt.

It comes off as bold, ambitious, yet intimate and sentimental all the same. It can be an elegant and harmonious exploration of human determination, drive and spirit.\" He also criticized numerous components, claiming that, \"In most cases though, the primary issue with the album is its lack of energy and vitality. There is many a time where the music seems to just sit in place, lacking major progression in character, motive or mindset.\" He awarded the score a final rating of 6 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entjunkie.blogspot.com/2014/12/unbroken-score-review.html|title='Unbroken' Score Review|last=Hofler|first=Callum|date=November 22, 2014|work=Entertainment Junkie|access-date=December 22, 2014}}</ref> Jorn Tillnes of Soundtrack Geek acclaimed the album, stating, \"This score is pretty great.
