It is the second installment in [[The Mighty Ducks (franchise)|''The Mighty Ducks'' trilogy]], and a sequel to the 1992 film ''[[The Mighty Ducks (film)|The Mighty Ducks]]'' produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Jordan Kerner|The Kerner Entertainment Company]] and Avnet\u2013Kerner Productions. It was succeeded by the final film of the series, ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]'', in 1996.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[Minor ice hockey|Pee-Wee hockey]] coach Gordon Bombay is a star in the minor leagues, expected to reach the [[National Hockey League]]. However, a career-ending knee injury brings him back to the Blukeville{{efn|A fictitious name for the fifth district created for the trilogy, just like how the Junior Goodwill Games, not to mention the Eden Hall Academy from ''[[D3: The Mighty Ducks]]'' (1996), were fictional.}} district of [[Minneapolis]]. Bombay is offered a chance to coach a team representing the United States in the Junior [[Goodwill Games]] in [[Los Angeles]]. He manages to reunite most of his former Ducks players, while the Hawks try to enact revenge for their humiliating loss two years earlier. Their plans are foiled by Fulton, who leaves them tied up in their underpants. Team USA consists of many of the old Ducks, in addition to five new players with special talents.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the lure of celebrity distracts Bombay, who begins to neglect the team for a luxurious lifestyle. The team wins easy victories over [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and Italy in the double-elimination tournament. Fulton Reed and Dean Portman gain recognition for their [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] skills, and are dubbed the \"Bash Brothers\". Backup goaltender Julie Gaffney asks Bombay for a chance to play, but is told to wait as goalie Greg Goldberg is on a hot streak.\n\nThe team suffers an embarrassing 12\u20131 defeat against Iceland, coached by ex-NHL player Wolf \"The Dentist\" Stansson. USA plays badly, and star center Adam Banks is slashed in the wrist. Frustrated, Bombay drives his players even harder, but they begin to suffer from complete exhaustion. Realizing the children are too tired to complete their school work or even stay awake in class, the team's tutor Michelle McKay intervenes, cancelling practice and confronting Bombay over his thoughtlessness. Once better rested, the players encounter a street hockey team who teaches them to play like \"the real Team USA\".\n\nBombay continues to suffer from the pressure until Jan, brother of Bombay's mentor Hans, visits and reminds him of his love for the game. In their match against Germany, Bombay fails to arrive on time, forcing Charlie to tell the referee Michelle is the team's assistant coach. The team struggles, entering the third period tied, until Bombay arrives and apologizes to the team for his behavior. Inspired by the true return of their coach, the players win the game with their signature \"Flying V\", and advance to the next round.\n\nThe renewed Bombay finally realizes Adam's wrist injury and benches him despite his complaints. To fill the open roster spot, Charlie recruits street hockey player Russ Tyler, whose unique \"knucklepuck\" \u2013 which rotates end over end rather than spinning around its centerline \u2013 secures USA's victory over Russia, advancing them to the championship game for a rematch against Iceland. Adam's injury is healed only to find Team USA with a full roster. Knowing the team needs Russ's knucklepuck and Adam's skill against Iceland, Charlie gives up his own spot, cementing his leadership as true team captain.\n\nIn the final game, the physically imposing Iceland initially dominates as the Ducks incur penalties: Ken picks a fight with an opposing player, the Bash Brothers fight the entire Iceland bench and Dwayne lassos an opposing player before he can check Connie. An annoyed Bombay observes, \"this isn't a hockey game, it's a circus.\"\n\nAfter a rousing locker room speech from Bombay and new Duck jerseys from Jan, the team emerges rejuvenated. The Ducks tie the game with goals from Connie, Banks, Luis, and finally Russ, who was targeted by Iceland but disguised himself as Goldberg to pull off a successful \"knucklepuck\". The game is forced to go to a five-shot [[Overtime (ice hockey)|shootout]]. With a 4\u20133 score in favor of the Ducks, Gunnar Stahl, the tournament's leading scorer, is Team Iceland's final shooter. Bombay replaces Goldberg with Julie, who has a faster glove. Gunnar fires a hard [[slapshot]], and Julie falls to the ice. The entire stadium waits in breathless anticipation as she opens her glove and drops the puck, revealing the game-winning save and the Ducks\u2019 triumph over Iceland to win the tournament.\n\nThe team returns to [[Minnesota]], and sing [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[We Are the Champions]]\" around a campfire.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Coach Gordon Bombay\n* [[Kathryn Erbe]] as Michelle McKay\n* [[Michael Tucker (actor)|Michael Tucker]] as Don Tibbles\n* [[Jan Rube\u0161]] as Jan\n* [[Carsten Norgaard]] as Coach Wolf \"The Dentist\" Stansson\n* [[Maria Ellingsen]] as Maria\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Charlie Conway, #96\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Fulton Reed, #44\n* [[Shaun Weiss]] as Greg Goldberg, #33\n* [[Brandon Adams (actor)|Brandon Adams]] as Jesse Hall, #9\n* [[Matt Doherty (actor)|Matt Doherty]] as Lester Averman, #4\n* [[Vincent Larusso]] as Adam Banks, #99\n* [[Garette Ratliff Henson]] as Guy Germaine, #00\n* [[Marguerite Moreau]] as Connie Moreau, #18\n* [[Colombe Jacobsen]] as Julie \"The Cat\" Gaffney, #6\n* [[Aaron Lohr]] as Dean Portman, #21\n* [[Ty O'Neal]] as Dwayne Robertson, #7\n* [[Kenan Thompson]] as Russ Tyler, #56\n* [[Mike Vitar]] as Luis Mendoza, #22\n* Justin Wong as Ken Wu, #16\n* [[Scott Whyte]] as Gunnar Stahl, #9 of Team Iceland\n* [[Vicellous Reon Shannon]] as James Tyler, Russ' Older Brother\n\n===Cameo appearances===\nThere are several cameo appearances in ''D2: The Mighty Ducks'' from famous athletes.\n\n* [[Kristi Yamaguchi]] as Champion Olympic Figure Skater\n* [[Greg Louganis]] as Champion Olympic Diver\n* [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] as Basketball Player\n* [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Chris Chelios]], [[Luc Robitaille]], [[Cam Neely]] as [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) Players\n* [[Bob Miller (sports announcer)|Bob Miller]] as Play-By-Play Announcer For The Championship Game vs. Iceland\n* [[Darren Pang]] as Color Commentator For The Championship Game vs. Iceland\n* [[Mike Emrick]] as Play-By-Play Commentator\n\n===Departures===\nMighty Duck players that were in the first film but not this one:\n* Tammy Duncan (Jane Plank; her figure skating skills were replaced with those of Ken Wu)\n* Tommy Duncan ([[Danny Tamberelli]])\n* Terry Hall ([[Jussie Smollett]], despite the continuation of the character's brother, Jesse)\n* Dave Karp ([[Aaron Schwartz (American actor)|Aaron Schwartz]])\n* Peter Mark ([[J.D.
