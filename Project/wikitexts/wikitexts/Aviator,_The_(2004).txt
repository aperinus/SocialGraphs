It stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Howard Hughes]], [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Katharine Hepburn]], and [[Kate Beckinsale]] as [[Ava Gardner]]. The supporting cast features [[Ian Holm]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Jude Law]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Kelli Garner]], [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Alan Alda]], and [[Edward Herrmann]].\n\nBased on the 1993 non-fiction book ''Howard Hughes: The Secret Life'' by [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]], the film depicts the life of Howard Hughes, an aviation pioneer and director of the film ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]''. The film portrays his life from 1927 to 1947 during which time Hughes became a successful film producer and an aviation magnate while simultaneously growing more unstable due to severe [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]] (OCD).\n\n''The Aviator'' was released in the United States on December 25, 2004 to positive reviews with critics praising DiCaprio\u2019s and Blanchett's performances and Scorsese\u2019s direction. It grossed $214 million on a budget of $110 million and received many [[List of accolades received by The Aviator (2004 film)|accolades]]. At the [[77th Academy Awards]], it was nominated for eleven awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for DiCaprio, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Alda, winning five: [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Blanchett. At the [[58th British Academy Film Awards]], it was nominated for fourteen awards, winning four: [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] for Blanchett, [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair|Best Makeup and Hair]]. At the [[62nd Golden Globe Awards]], it was nominated for six awards, winning three: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2014 Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor \u2014 Motion Picture Drama]] for DiCaprio and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[Howard Shore]]. In addition, DiCaprio was nominated for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role|Outstanding Male Actor in a Leading Role]] and Blanchett won [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Female Actor in a Supporting Role]] at the [[11th Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1913, [[Houston]], eight-year-old [[Howard Hughes]]' mother gives him a bath and teaches him how to spell \"quarantine\", warning him about the recent [[cholera]] outbreak. Fourteen years later, in 1927, he begins to direct his film ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'', and hires [[Noah Dietrich]] to manage the day-to-day operations of his business empire. \n\nAfter the release of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', the first partially talking film, Hughes becomes obsessed with shooting his film realistically, and decides to convert the movie to a sound film. Despite the film being a hit, Hughes remains unsatisfied with the end result and orders it to be recut after its Hollywood premiere. He becomes romantically involved with actress [[Katharine Hepburn]], who helps to ease the symptoms of his worsening [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]].\n\nIn 1935, Hughes test flies the [[Hughes H-1 Racer|H-1 Racer]], pushing it to a new speed record, despite having to crash-land into a beet field when the aircraft runs out of fuel. Three years later, he breaks the world record by flying around the world in four days. He subsequently purchases majority interest in [[Trans World Airlines|Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA)]]. \n\n[[Juan Trippe]], company rival and chairman of [[Pan Am]], gets his crony, Senator [[Ralph Owen Brewster]], to introduce the [[Airline deregulation|Community Airline Bill]], which would give Pan Am exclusivity on international air travel. Hepburn grows tired of Hughes' eccentricity and workaholism, and leaves him for fellow actor [[Spencer Tracy]]. Hughes quickly finds a new love interest with 15-year-old [[Faith Domergue]], and later actress [[Ava Gardner]]. However, he still has feelings for Hepburn, and bribes a reporter to keep reports about her and the married Tracy out of the press.\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Hughes contracts two projects with the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]], one for a [[Surveillance aircraft|spy aircraft]], and another for a [[Military transport aircraft|troop transport unit]] for use in [[World War II]]. \n\nIn 1947, with the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules|H-4 Hercules]] [[flying boat]] still in construction, Hughes finishes the [[Hughes XF-11|XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft]] and takes it for a test flight. However, one of the engines fails midflight, and he crashes in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], miraculously surviving the crash. The army cancels its order for the H-4 Hercules, although Hughes still continues the development with his own money. Dietrich informs Hughes that he must choose between funding the airlines or his flying boat. Hughes orders Dietrich to mortgage the TWA assets so he can continue the development.\n\nAs his OCD worsens, Hughes becomes increasingly paranoid, planting microphones and tapping Gardner's phone lines to keep track of her, until she kicks him out of her house. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] searches his home for incriminating evidence of [[war profiteering]], searching through his possessions. \n\nBrewster privately offers to drop the charges if Hughes sells TWA to Trippe, but Hughes refuses. Hughes' OCD symptoms become extreme, and he retreats into an isolated \"germ-free zone\" for three months. Trippe has Brewster summon him for a Senate investigation, certain that Hughes will not show up. Gardner visits him and personally grooms and dresses him in preparation for the hearing.\n\nAn invigorated Hughes defends himself against Brewster's charges and accuses the Senator of taking bribes from Trippe. He concludes by announcing that he has committed to completing the H-4 aircraft, and that he will leave the country if he cannot get it to fly. Brewster's bill is promptly defeated. \n\nAfter successfully flying the aircraft, Hughes speaks with Dietrich and his engineer, [[Glenn Odekirk]], about a new jetliner for TWA. However, he begins hallucinating men in germ-resistant suits, and has a [[panic attack]]. As Odekirk hides him in a restroom while Dietrich fetches a doctor, Hughes begins to have flashbacks of his childhood, his love for aviation and his ambition for success, compulsively repeating the phrase \"the way of the future\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Howard Hughes]]\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Katharine Hepburn]]\n* [[John C.

He co-wrote the script with [[Bo Goldman]] after a proposed collaboration with [[Paul Schrader]] fell through. Goldman wrote his own script, ''[[Melvin and Howard]]'', which depicted Hughes' possible relationship with [[Melvin Dummar]]. Beatty's thoughts regularly returned to the project over the years,<ref name=Spiel /> and in 1990 he approached [[Steven Spielberg]] to direct Goldman's script.<ref>{{cite book |author=Joseph McBride |title=Steven Spielberg: A Biography |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |date=1997 |location=New York City |pages=446 |isbn=0-571-19177-0| author-link = Joseph McBride (writer)}}</ref> Beatty's Hughes biopic was eventually released under the title ''[[Rules Don't Apply]]'' in 2016. [[Charles Evans, Jr.]] purchased the [[film rights]] of ''Howard Hughes: The Untold Story'' ({{ISBN|0-525-93785-4}}) in 1993. Evans secured financing from [[New Regency Productions]], but development stalled.<ref name=pilot>Hughes, p.144-147</ref>\n\n''The Aviator'' was a joint production between Warner Bros., which handled Latin American and Canadian distribution, and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], which released the film internationally under its [[Miramax Films]] banner in the United States and the United Kingdom. Disney previously developed a Hughes biopic with director [[Brian De Palma]] and actor [[Nicolas Cage]] between 1997 and 1998. Titled ''Mr. Hughes'', the film would have starred Cage in the dual roles of both Hughes and [[Clifford Irving]]. It was conceived when De Palma and Cage were working on ''[[Snake Eyes (1998 film)|Snake Eyes]]'' with writer [[David Koepp]].<ref name=Spiel>{{cite book |author=David Hughes |title=Tales From Development Hell |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |date=March 2004 |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/talesfromdevelop00davi/page/136 136\u2013140] |isbn=1-84023-691-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/talesfromdevelop00davi/page/136 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117479189 |title='Snake' trio tackles Hughes; LaPaglia in 'Sam' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=August 6, 1998 |access-date=January 3, 2009 | url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024115317/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117479189 |archive-date=October 24, 2012 }}</ref> [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] joined the competition in March 1998 when it purchased the film rights to ''Empire: The Life, Legend and Madness of Howard Hughes'' ({{ISBN|0-393000-257}}), written by [[Donald Barlett]] and [[James Steele (journalist)|James Steele]].

In the mid 1990s and early 2000s, director [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] was in talks to direct a film about the early life Hughes with [[Edward Norton]] as the eccentric young billionaire. Also, in the early 2000s, director [[Christopher Nolan]] was developing a film about Hughes based on the book ''Hughes: The Private Diaries, Memos and Letters'' by [[Richard Hack]]. The film was shelved when Scorsese was on board to direct ''The Aviator''. Nolan returned to his Howard Hughes project after completing ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''. This time, Nolan used the book ''Citizen Hughes: The Power, the Money and the Madness'' by [[Michael Drosnin]] as the source of his film. Nolan wrote the script and the script follows the darker and final years of Hughes's life. Nolan, once again, shelved the project when Warren Beatty was developing his [[Rules Don't Apply|long-awaited Hughes film]]. It was reported that Nolan's ''Hughes'' film was to star [[Jim Carrey]] as the reclusive, elderly billionaire.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2011/02/christopher-nolan-to-make-shelved-howard-hughes-biopic-after-the-dark-knight-rises-120327/ |title=Christopher Nolan To Make Shelved Howard Hughes Biopic After 'The Dark Knight Rises'? |first1=Kevin |last1=Jagernauth  |date=February 11, 2011 |access-date=October 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714170204/https://www.indiewire.com/2011/02/christopher-nolan-to-make-shelved-howard-hughes-biopic-after-the-dark-knight-rises-120327/|archive-date=July 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDisney restarted development on a new Howard Hughes biopic in June 1999, hiring [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]] to direct [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] playing the role of Howard Hughes, based on a script by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Chris Petrikin; Michael Fleming |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117503429 |title=Mouse, Mann and DiCaprio pact |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 24, 1999 |access-date=January 24, 2009 | url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024130220/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117503429 |archive-date=October 24, 2012 }}</ref> The studio put it in turnaround again following the disappointing box-office performance of Mann's critically acclaimed ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]''.

Scorsese and DiCaprio worked closely with Dr. Jeffrey M. Schwartz, MD of [[UCLA]], to portray the most accurate depiction of OCD. The filmmakers had to focus both on previous accounts of Hughes\u2019 behaviors as well as the time period, given that when Hughes was suffering from the disorder, there was no psychiatric definition for what ailed him. Instead of receiving proper treatment, Hughes was forced to hide his stigmatized compulsions; his disorder began to conflict with everyday functioning.\n\nDiCaprio dedicated hundreds of hours of work to portray Hughes' unique case of OCD on screen. Apart from doing his research on Hughes, DiCaprio met with people suffering from OCD. In particular, he focused on the way some individuals would compulsively and repeatedly wash their hands, later inspiring the scene in which his hand starts to bleed as he scrubs it in the bathroom. The character arc of Howard Hughes was a drastic one: from the height of his career to the appearance of his compulsions, and eventually, to him sitting naked in a screening room, refusing to leave, and later repeating the phrase \"the way of the future.\"<ref>Kinsey, Beck.

This was done, according to Scorsese, to emulate the look of early [[bipack color]] films, in particular the [[Multicolor]] process, which Hughes himself owned, emulating the available technology of the era. Similarly, many of the scenes depicting events occurring after 1935 are treated to emulate the saturated appearance of [[Technicolor#Three-strip Technicolor|three-strip]] [[Technicolor]]. Other scenes were stock footage [[Film colorization|colorized]] and incorporated into the film.

When Martin Scorsese began planning his aviation epic, a decision was made to film flying sequences with [[scale model]]s rather than [[computer-generated image|CGI]] special effects. The critical reaction to the CGI models in ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (2001) had been a crucial factor in Scorsese's decision to use full-scale static and scale models in this case. The building and filming of the flying models proved both cost-effective and timely.<ref name=\"MovieModels\">{{cite web |last=Cobb |first=Jerry |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/7025938 |title=Movie Models are the real stars of 'The Aviator' |work=NBC News |date=February 25, 2005 |access-date=March 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe primary scale models were the ''Spruce Goose'' and the XF-11; both flyable scale models were designed and fabricated over a period of several months by Aero Telemetry, an aerospace company that specializes in building unmanned air vehicles.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CNBC|first=Jerry Cobb Reporter|date=2005-02-25|title=Model airplanes are the real stars of 'The Aviator'|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7025938|access-date=2020-07-28|website=msnbc.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Model Aviation|url=http://library.modelaviation.com/ma/2005/7|access-date=2020-07-28|website=library.modelaviation.com}}</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|375|lb|kg|abbr=on}} ''Spruce Goose'' model had a wingspan of {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} while the {{convert|750|lb|kg|abbr=on}} XF-11 had a {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wingspan.

In addition to the aircraft, the homes that the XF-11 crashes into were fabricated at 1:4 scale to match the 1:4 scale XF-11. The model was rigged to be crashed and break up several times for different shots.\n\nThe Aero Telemetry team was given only three months to complete three models including the 450&nbsp;lb H-1 Racer, with an {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wingspan, that had to stand-in for the full-scale replica that was destroyed in a crash, shortly before principal photography began.<ref>Baker, Mark.
