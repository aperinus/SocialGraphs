It is a direct prequel to the [[The Thing (1982 film)|1982 film of the same name]] by [[John Carpenter]], which was an adaptation of the 1938 [[novella]] ''[[Who Goes There?]]'' by [[John W. Campbell]]. It tells the story of a team of scientists on a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Research stations in Antarctica|Antarctic research station]] who discover a [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] buried deep in the ice, realizing too late that it is still alive.\n\n''The Thing'' premiered on October 10, 2011 and was released on October 14, 2011. The film was a commercial flop, grossing $31.5 million against a $38 million budget, with mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\n\nIn the winter of 1982, an alien spacecraft and nearby alien body are discovered buried in Antarctic ice by members of Norwegian research station \"Thule\". American [[paleontologist]] Kate Lloyd is recruited by Dr. Sander Halvorson and assistant Adam Finch to investigate. They fly to Thule in a helicopter with pilots Sam Carter and Derek Jameson, and crewman Griggs. They meet station chief Edvard Wolner, along with his team of Juliette, Karl, Jonas, Henrik, Colin, Peder, Lars, and Lars' dog.\n\nThe body is excavated in a block of ice and returned to the Thule Station. During a party, Jameson sees the alien burst from the ice block. Searching for the alien, the team finds Lars' dog dead. The alien drags Henrik into itself, spattering blood on Olav. The group kills the alien with a flamethrower. An autopsy finds that the alien's cells were copying Henrik's. Olav falls ill.\n\nAs Carter, Jameson, and Griggs are taking off in the helicopter to take Olav to a medical facility, Griggs transforms into a monstrous creature and attacks Olav causing the helicopter to crash in the mountains. Kate discovers [[dental restoration|dental fillings]] in a bloodied shower and tells the team that the alien can assimilate and imitate its victims, and that it is now living among them. Edvard orders the team to drive to the closest base; however, Juliette and Kate want to prevent anyone from leaving. Juliette lures Kate into an abandoned room before transforming and attacking her. Kate escapes and the Juliette-Thing kills Karl. Lars kills the Juliette-Thing with a [[flamethrower]] and the team resolve to [[quarantine]] themselves until the threat is eliminated.\n\nThat night, Carter and Jameson stagger back from the crashed helicopter. Suspected to be alien, they are imprisoned in isolation. As the alien does not assimilate inorganic material, Kate proposes everyone be checked for dental fillings. The test implicates Sander, Edvard, Adam, and Colin, who have no fillings.\n\nLars is abducted while going to fetch Carter and Jameson for testing. Carter and Jameson break into the main building, shooting Peder dead and puncturing his flamethrower tank, causing an explosion knocking Edvard unconscious. When brought to the main room, Edvard violently transforms, infects Jonas and Jameson, and gruesomely assimilates Adam. Kate burns Jonas and Jameson before they can fully transform, then she and Carter pursue the Thing, which assimilates Sander.\n\nThe Sander-Thing drives off into the night in a [[snowcat]] pursued by Kate and Carter. The spacecraft suddenly activates, separating them. Kate falls into the ship and confronts the monstrous Sander. She kills him with a grenade which shuts down the ship's engines. Kate finds Carter and notices he is missing his earring. Carter indicates the wrong ear so Kate burns the Carter-Thing and moves to the second snowcat before driving away, presumably headed for the Russian station.\n\nThe next morning, Thule's helicopter and pilot Matias return. Matias views the ruined station and the husk of the Edvard-Adam-Thing with horror. Colin has committed suicide, and Lars demands at gunpoint that Matias show his teeth. Lars' dog, thought dead, emerges and runs away. Realizing that the dog is actually a Thing, Lars orders Matias to [[The Thing (1982 film)#Plot|give chase in the helicopter]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Kate Lloyd, an American vertebrate paleontologist graduate from [[Columbia University]]:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://slashfilm.com/2010/04/07/first-set-image-for-universals-prequel-to-the-thing/|title=First Set Image for Universal's Prequel to The Thing|last=Fischer|first=Russ|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=April 7, 2010|access-date=April 20, 2010}}</ref> In order to be different from [[Kurt Russell]] as the 1982 film's protagonist, [[R.J.
