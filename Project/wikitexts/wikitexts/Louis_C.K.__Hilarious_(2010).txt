He had done that routine in conversation on the October 1, 2008 episode of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', which had resulted in a viral frenzy after it was posted to [[YouTube]] and other media outlets; it was seen more than 7 million times before it was blocked by copyright claims from [[NBCUniversal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Everything's Amazing & Nobody's Happy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r1CZTLk-Gk|access-date=April 12, 2015|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> In reference to the appearance and internet attention, Eric Spitznagel praised his honesty in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', saying:\n\n<blockquote>Louis C.K. has slowly been evolving from a dependably funny stand-up to the comedy lovechild of [[Bill Hicks]] and [[George Carlin]]. [...] If you don't find yourself nodding along with C.K. in fierce agreement, and even occasionally pumping the air with a raised fist salute, you're either dead inside or a member of that \"crappiest generation\" C.K. was talking about. Somehow, Louis managed to do something even [[Barack Obama|Obama]] has had a difficult time pulling off lately: Finding the silver lining of our nation's ongoing economic collapse. In less than five minutes, C.K. made a convincing case that capitalism's death knell might not be such a bad thing after all. Sure, it could mean donkeys will become our primary source of transportation, but it could also lead to the triumphant return of rotary phones and manual credit card machines.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2009/03/louis-ck-starvation-can-be-character-building.html|title = Louis C.K.: 'Starvation Can Be Character Building'|access-date = 2009-03-02|last = Spitznagel|first = Eric|date = 2009-03-02|work = Vanity Fair|publisher = PlanetOut}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile on his tour, C.K. also landed a deal with [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] to shoot a pilot featuring a loosely autobiographical depiction of his life as a comedian living as a single dad in [[New York City]]. Soon after, the show was placed for an order of 13 episodes, requiring a new hour of material aside from the hour written for the ''Hilarious'' tour. He stated on the podcast ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'' that his 4th hour went into the show but was performed with the ''Hilarious'' material on the same tour.\n\n===Production===\nAt the end of the tour, C.K. filmed the material as his third one-hour special at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee during April 2009, with C.K. himself serving as director and editor.
