It was directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and stars [[Jane Russell]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]], with [[Charles Coburn]], [[Elliott Reid]], [[Tommy Noonan]], [[George Winslow]], [[Taylor Holmes]] and [[Norma Varden]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is filled with comedic situations and musical numbers, choreographed by [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]], while the music was written by [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Harold Adamson]], [[Jule Styne]] and [[Leo Robin]]. The songs by Styne and Robin are from the Broadway show, while the songs by Carmichael and Adamson were written especially for the film. Despite the film's title, Monroe was paid her usual contract salary of $500 a week, while Russell, the better known actress at the time, earned $200,000.\n\nWhile Russell's down-to-earth, sharp wit has been observed by most critics, it was Monroe's turn as the gold-digging Lorelei Lee for which the film is often remembered.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gentlemen_prefer_blondes/ |title=Gentlemen Prefer Blondes |publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2010-10-18}}</ref> Monroe's rendition of the song \"[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]\" and her [[Pink dress of Marilyn Monroe|pink dress]] are considered iconic, and the performance has inspired homages by [[Madonna]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Geri Halliwell]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Margot Robbie]], [[Anna Nicole Smith]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Rachel Bloom]], [[Miss Piggy]] and [[(G)I-dle]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Gentlemen Prefer Blondes Movie Trailer Screenshot (34).jpg|thumb|left|[[Marilyn Monroe]] as Lorelei Lee performing \"[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]\"]]\nLorelei Lee (Marilyn Monroe) and Dorothy Shaw (Jane Russell) are American showgirls  and best friends, although the two are very different. Lorelei thinks more of a man's financial wealth and likes men who can support her passion for diamonds, like her fianc\u00e9, Gus, who can provide all of her financial \"needs\". Dorothy prefers men who are good-looking and fit, and does not care about their wealth.\n\nLorelei plans to wed Gus in France, but the two are forbidden to travel together by Gus's strict father, Esmond Sr., who despises Lorelei. Lorelei decides to travel to France with or without Gus, and before she leaves he gives her a [[letter of credit]] to cover expenses upon her arrival, and promises to later meet her in France. However, he also warns her to behave, noting that his father will prohibit their marriage if rumors of misdeeds make their way to Esmond Sr. Unbeknownst to both of them, Esmond Sr. has hired a private detective, Ernie Malone, to spy on Lorelei.\n\nDuring the Atlantic crossing, Malone immediately falls in love with Dorothy, but Dorothy has already been drawn to the members of the (all-male) Olympic team. Lorelei meets the rich and foolish Sir Francis \"Piggy\" Beekman, the owner of a diamond mine, and is attracted by his wealth; although Piggy is married, Lorelei naively returns his geriatric flirtations, which annoys his wife, Lady Beekman.\n\nLorelei invites Piggy to the cabin she shares with Dorothy, whereupon he recounts his travels to Africa. While Piggy demonstrates how a python squeezes a goat by hugging Lorelei, Malone spies on them through the window and takes pictures of the two, but is caught by Dorothy as he walks away nonchalantly. She tells Lorelei, who fears for her reputation. They come up with a scheme to intoxicate Malone and then search him to recover the incriminating film while he is unconscious. They find the film in his pants, and Lorelei promptly prints and hides the negatives. Revealing her success to Piggy, she persuades him to give her Lady Beekman's tiara as a thank you gift. However, Malone reveals he had planted a recording device in Lorelei's cabin, and has heard her discussion with Piggy about the pictures and the tiara. Malone implies that Lorelei is a golddigger and, when Dorothy scolds him for his actions, admits that he himself is a liar. However, Dorothy reveals to Lorelei she is falling for Malone, after which Lorelei chastises her for choosing a poor man when she could easily have a rich one.\n\n[[Image:Gentlemen Prefer Blondes Movie Trailer Screenshot (19).jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Jane Russell]] as Dorothy Shaw]]\nThe ship arrives in France, and Lorelei and Dorothy spend time shopping. However, the pair discover that Lorelei's letter of credit has been cancelled and are then kicked out of their hotel due to the information Malone shared with Esmond Sr.  The duo are forced to find work as showgirls in Paris, headlining a lavish [[revue]].  When Gus shows up at their show, Lorelei rebuffs him, after which she performs ''Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend'', the musical number whose lyrics explain why and how women need to pursue men with money. Meanwhile, Lady Beekman has filed charges regarding her missing tiara, and Lorelei is arraigned for theft. Dorothy persuades Lorelei to return the tiara, but the pair discover it is missing from her jewelry box. Piggy tries to weasel out of his part in the affair when Malone catches him at the airport.\n\nDorothy stalls for time in court by pretending to be Lorelei, disguised in a blonde wig and mimicking her friend's breathy voice and mannerisms. When Malone appears in court and is about to unmask \"Lorelei\" as Dorothy, she reveals to Malone in covert language that she, Dorothy, loves him but would never forgive him if he were to do anything to hurt her best friend, Lorelei. Malone withdraws his comments, but then reveals Piggy has the tiara, exonerating Lorelei.\n\nBack at the nightclub, Lorelei impresses Esmond Sr. with a speech on the subject of paternal money, and also makes an argument that if Esmond Sr. had a daughter instead of a son, he would want the best for her, to which he agrees and consents to his son's marriage to Lorelei. The film closes with a double wedding for Lorelei and Dorothy, who marry Gus and Malone, respectively.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jane Russell]] as Dorothy Shaw\n* [[Marilyn Monroe]] as Lorelei Lee\n* [[Charles Coburn]] as Sir Francis \"Piggy\" Beekman\n* [[Elliott Reid]] as Ernie Malone\n* [[Tommy Noonan]] as Gus Esmond Jr.\n* [[George Winslow]] as Henry Spofford III\n* [[Marcel Dalio]] as the magistrate\n* [[Taylor Holmes]] as Mr. Esmond Sr.\n* [[Norma Varden]] as Lady Beekman\n* [[Howard Wendell]] as Watson\n* [[Steven Geray]] as the hotel manager\n* [[Henri Letondal]] as Grotier (uncredited)\n* [[Noel Neill]] as passenger (uncredited)\n* [[Jean Del Val]] as Ship's Captain (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAlthough Hawks is credited as the sole director of the film, Russell and assistant choreographer [[Gwen Verdon]] contend that Monroe's iconic musical number, \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\", was actually directed by choreographer Cole.

There is no back-stabbing, shit-talking, or degrading one another to come out on top or gain the affection of a man.
