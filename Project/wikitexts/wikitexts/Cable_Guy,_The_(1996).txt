Taking advice from his friend Rick, Steven bribes cable installer Ernie \"Chip\" Douglas into giving him free movie channels. Chip gets Steven to hang out with him the next day and makes him one of his \"preferred customers\". Chip takes Steven to the city's central [[satellite dish]], where he confides to Steven about being raised by television due to the frequent absences of his single mother. Chip soon proves to be intrusive as he crashes a basketball game between Steven and his friends and leaves multiple messages on Steven's answering machine. Following a knight's duel between Chip and Steven at [[Medieval Times]], Steven finds that Chip has secretly installed an expensive [[home theater system]] in his living room as a gift in return for Steven's friendship. Although Steven declines the gift, he agrees to host a party attended by Chip's other preferred customers before having the system returned. In the fervor of the party, Steven sleeps with a young guest, whom Chip reveals the next morning to have been a prostitute that he had hired specifically for Steven. Upon this revelation, Steven angrily ejects Chip from his apartment.\n\nTo make amends, Chip tracks down Robin, who is dating another man. A disguised Chip severely beats the man in a restaurant bathroom and tells him to stay away from Robin. He later upgrades Robin's cable, ostensibly as a gift from Steven. Robin decides to get back together with Steven as a result. However, when Chip informs Steven of his role in reuniting him with Robin, Steven politely ends his relationship with Chip. Devastated, Chip sets out on a series of vengeful acts. He gets Steven arrested for possession of stolen property and mocks him through a prison visitation window. After being released on [[bail]], Steven is further embarrassed when Chip attends dinner with his family and Robin. Following a sexualized version of the game ''[[Password (American game show)|Password]]'', Steven openly berates Chip and punches him. The next day, Steven is fired from his job when Chip transmits a privately recorded conversation, in which Steven insults his boss, onto the company's computers.\n\nRick investigates Chip at Steven's request and finds that Chip was fired from the cable company for [[stalking]] customers, and uses the names of various television characters as aliases such as Chip and Ernie Douglas from ''[[My Three Sons]]'' and Larry Tate from ''[[Bewitched]]''. Chip calls Steven that night, telling him he is paying Robin a visit. After visiting Robin's empty apartment, Steven tracks them down to the satellite dish, where Chip holds Robin hostage in a rainstorm. After a physical altercation and a chase, Steven is able to save Robin. As the police arrive, Chip apologizes to Steven for being a bad friend. Chip, proclaiming that he must \"kill the babysitter\" to prevent others from becoming like him, dives backward from the top of a ladder onto the satellite dish, knocking out the television signal to the entire city. Chip survives the fall with an injured back, and bids Steven farewell before being hauled away in a rescue helicopter. When one of the paramedics addresses him as \"buddy\", Chip asks the paramedic if he is truly his buddy, to which the paramedic replies \"Yeah, sure you are\", causing Chip to smile deviously, implying a repeat of Chip's stalking cycle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Ernie \"Chip\" Douglas/\"The Cable Guy\"\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Steven M.
