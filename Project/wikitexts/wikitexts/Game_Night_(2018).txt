It stars [[Jason Bateman]] and [[Rachel McAdams]], and follows a group of friends whose game night turns into a real-life mystery after one of them is kidnapped. The film's supporting cast includes [[Billy Magnussen]], [[Sharon Horgan]], [[Lamorne Morris]], [[Kylie Bunbury]], [[Jesse Plemons]], [[Michael C. Hall]], and [[Kyle Chandler]].\n\n[[Warner Bros. Pictures]] released the film on February 23, 2018. It was a commercial and critical success, grossing $117 million worldwide and receiving praise for its originality, humor, script and performances. Plemons was nominated for the [[Detroit Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nHusband and wife Max and Annie are avid gamers. They met at [[pub quiz|bar trivia]] and Max proposed during a game of [[charades]]. Their plans for a baby are complicated by Max's feelings of inadequacy when compared to his successful brother Brooks. They host a regular game night with their friend Ryan and married couple Kevin and Michelle, which they struggle to keep secret from their socially awkward police officer neighbor Gary, especially after he was crushed following his divorce from their other friend Debbie. \n\nBrooks arrives in Max\u2019s dream car (a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C3)|Corvette Stingray]]), humiliates him with a childhood story and offends Annie (who assumed Max was overthinking his issues with Brooks) by offering to host their next game night himself.\n\nWhen the guests, including Ryan's new date Sarah, arrive at Brooks' rental house, Brooks reveals that he has initiated an interactive role-playing mystery game, promising the winner his Corvette. An actor enters to begin the game but is knocked unconscious by two masked men who kidnap Brooks. Believing this is part of the game, the couples passively observe the fight and then split up to solve the mystery. Ryan and Sarah visit the role-playing company\u2019s office to offer a bribe for the final clue. Kevin and Michelle talk to the actor, leading them to realize Brooks\u2019 abduction was real.\n\nMeanwhile, Max and Annie track Brooks\u2019 phone to a bar and use a \u201cfake\u201d pistol Brooks dropped to hold his captors at gunpoint and free him but Max is shot in the arm after Annie plays with it. Realizing they\u2019re in actual danger, they flee as Brooks confesses that he is a [[black market]]eer: he procured a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]] for a criminal known as \"the Bulgarian\" but instead sold it to someone with the alias \"Marlon Freeman\". With his kidnappers in pursuit, Brooks jumps out of the car to allow Max and Annie to escape.\n\nThe couples regroup and, unable to go to the police, decide to recover the egg from Freeman to deliver to the Bulgarian. They show up at Gary's, distracting him with the pretense of a game night while Max uses his police computer to discover Freeman\u2019s real name, Donald Anderton, and his address. After Max accidentally bleeds all over Gary's dog and a shrine dedicated to Debbie, the group leaves and receives a phone call to meet the kidnappers in one hour.\n\nThey sneak into Anderton's mansion, where he is hosting an underground fight club. Searching for the egg, Michelle admits to Kevin that she once slept with a man she thought was [[Denzel Washington]] while they were on a break, but Kevin determines him to be a celebrity impersonator after seeing a picture of him, and Max tells Annie he may not be ready to have a child. Ryan spots the egg in an open safe, leading to a game of [[keep away]] with Anderton\u2019s guards. The group escapes with the egg but accidentally break it, revealing a list inside.\n\nThe group meets with Brooks and his captors, only to be captured themselves. Brooks reveals that he has always been jealous of Max\u2019s life, and intended for him to win the Corvette all along. They are saved by Gary, who is shot in the chest. Max and Annie comfort him by promising to invite him to every future game night, and he reveals that he faked the entire abduction \u2014 including hiring the kidnappers \u2014 to trick them into letting him rejoin game night.\n\nHe is, however, unaware of the list, which he recognizes as a [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witsec list]], and they are cornered by the real Bulgarian. Max offers the list in exchange for their lives, but a desperate Brooks swallows the list and is taken to the Bulgarian\u2019s plane. Max and Annie race to the airport in the Corvette and manage to stop the plane, subdue the Bulgarian and his henchman, and rescue Brooks; Max realizes he wants to be a father after all.\n\nThree months later, Brooks is under house arrest for his crimes, but has sold the list on the black market for $3 million (after tipping off the witnesses for $20,000 each). He hosts game night for the group, including Gary, and Annie reveals she is pregnant through a game of [[Pictionary]], while armed men arrive outside. In a mid-credits sequence, Gary looks over his plans to rejoin game night, while in a post-credits scene, his ex-wife Debbie meets Kenny, the Denzel Washington lookalike.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Max Davis, Annie's husband.\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Annie Davis, Max's wife.\n* [[Billy Magnussen]] as Ryan Huddle, one of Max and Annie's friends.\n* [[Sharon Horgan]] as Sarah Darcy, Ryan's co-worker and love interest.\n* [[Lamorne Morris]] as Kevin Sterling, Michelle's husband.\n* [[Kylie Bunbury]] as Michelle Sterling, Kevin's wife.\n* [[Jesse Plemons]] as Gary Kingsbury, Max and Annie's neighbor.\n* [[Chelsea Peretti]] as Glenda\n* [[Danny Huston]] as Donald Anderton\n* [[Michael C.
