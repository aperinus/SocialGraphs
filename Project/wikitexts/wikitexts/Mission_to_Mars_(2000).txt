Principal support actors were [[Tim Robbins]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Connie Nielsen]], [[Jerry O'Connell]], and [[Kim Delaney]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2020, the ''Mars I'' mission launches for planet [[Mars]], commanded by Luke Graham ([[Don Cheadle]]). Upon arrival, the team discovers a bright white formation in the [[Cydonia (region of Mars)|Cydonia region]], which they suspect is an [[extrusion]] from a subsurface [[geothermal]] column of water, useful to future [[Colonization of Mars|human colonization]]. After reporting this to the Earth-orbiting World Space Station, they go to investigate the formation and start hearing a low sound on their communications system. Radar initially reports that the formation is metal, but when they increase power to the radar, a large [[vortex]] appears and kills everyone except Luke. After the vortex subsides, the formation is revealed to be part of a large [[Face on Mars|humanoid face]].\n\nThe event creates an [[electromagnetic pulse]] the space station observes, after which it receives a distress message from Luke. Realizing Luke couldn't have left because the pulse would have damaged the computer system of the ERV (\"Earth Return Vehicle\"), they repurpose the ''Mars II'' mission into a rescue.\n\nMonths later, as ''Mars Rescue'', consisting of Commander Woody Blake ([[Tim Robbins]]), his wife Terri Fisher ([[Connie Nielsen]]), recent [[widower]] Jim McConnell ([[Gary Sinise]]), and technician Phil Ohlmyer ([[Jerry O'Connell]]), nears Mars orbit, they discover that all satellite imagery of the formation area is covered with [[white noise|static]]. [[Micrometeoroid]]s breach the ship, causing damage to the external fuel lines and resulting in the engines exploding. With the destroyed Mars II out of control,  crew are forced to abandon ship and travel in their spacesuits to the REMO (\"Resupply Module\") in a nearby orbit over Mars. Woody launches himself at the module and manages to attach a tether to it, but loses his grip and begins descending into the Martian atmosphere. Terri attempts to rescue Woody, but knowing she would run out of fuel before reaching him, Woody removes his helmet, killing himself to save her.\n\nThe survivors arrive on the Martian surface, and begin repairing the ERV. They find Luke living in a [[greenhouse]]; he shows them pictures of the face, and reveals that the pulses in the low sound they heard represented a 3D model of human-like [[DNA]], but missing a pair of chromosomes. Jim determines they must complete the sequence to pass a test, and they send a rover to broadcast the completed signal via radar. Following the transmission, an opening appears in the side of the structure. With a massive dust storm approaching Jim, Terri, and Luke head to the formation, while Phil stays to finish repairing the ERV. Phil is ordered to launch, with or without them, before the storm hits.\n\nThe three astronauts enter the opening, which seals behind them. A three-dimensional projection of the solar system depicts the planet Mars, covered with water, being struck by a large asteroid and rendered uninhabitable. A projection of a humanoid Martian lifeform reveals that the native Martians evacuated the planet in spaceships, one of which was sent to seed Earth with DNA, intending to create life that could one day land on Mars and be recognized as descendants. An invitation is offered for one of their group to follow the Martians to their new home. Jim accepts the invitation, bidding farewell to Terri and Luke, and is sealed inside a small capsule. Terri and Luke race back to the ERV and arrive just as Phil is about to take off. They barely escape the dust storm into space as Jim's capsule is launched from the crumbling formation and past them toward the Martians' home.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Jim McConnell\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Woody Blake\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Luke Graham\n* [[Connie Nielsen]] as Terri Fisher\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Phil Ohlmyer\n* [[Kim Delaney]] as Maggie McConnell\n* [[Peter Outerbridge]] as Sergei Kirov\n* [[Kavan Smith]] as Nicholas Willis\n* [[Jill Teed]] as Ren\u00e9e Cot\u00e9\n* [[Elise Neal]] as Debra Graham\n* [[Robert Bailey Jr.]] as Bobby Graham\n* Taylor Jones as Daniel Lederman\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Ray Beck\n* [[Bill Timoney]] as Computer (voice)\n\n==Filming==\nThe film was shot primarily on location in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]; [[Jordan]]; and the [[Canary Islands]].<ref name=\"YahooMov\" /> Extensive special effects surrounding certain aspects of the film such as the NASA spacecraft and Martian vortex, were created by a number of digital effects companies including [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]], Dream Quest Images, [[Tippett Studio]], CIS Hollywood, and Trans FX.<ref name=\"YahooMov\" /> Between visuals, miniatures, and animation, over 400 technicians were directly involved in the production aspects of the special effects.<ref name=\"YahooMov\" />\n\nAccording to the director in the 2015 [[De Palma (film)|documentary film]] about his career, De Palma was brought on board after the previous director walked away due to concerns over the lack of additional money for the budget.
