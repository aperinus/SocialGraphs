The plot centers around an obsessive fan who holds an author captive and forces him to rewrite the finale to his book series.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on November 30, 1990, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It received highly positive reviews and was a box office success. Bates' performance drew widespread praise from critics and won her the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] at the [[63rd Academy Awards]], making ''Misery'' the only film based on a Stephen King novel to win an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=151714 |title=The Best and Worst of Stephen King's Movies \u2013 MSN Movies News |publisher=Movies.msn.com |date=October 20, 2012 |access-date=January 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203055217/http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=151714 |archive-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref> King himself has stated that ''Misery'' is one of his top ten favorite film adaptations.<ref name=\"Stephen King Goes to the Movies\">Stephen King, ''Stephen King Goes to the Movies'', page 579 (Hodder & Stoughton, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-340-98030-9}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words. As of June 18, 2020, the word count for this plot summary is 664 words. -->\nFamed novelist Paul Sheldon is the author of a successful series of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[romance novel]]s featuring a character named Misery Chastain. Wanting to focus on more serious stories, he writes a manuscript for a new novel that he hopes will launch his post-''Misery'' career. While traveling from [[Silver Creek, Colorado]], to his home in [[New York City]], Paul is caught in a blizzard and gets into an accident, rendering him unconscious. A nurse named [[Annie Wilkes]] finds him and brings him to her remote home.\n\nPaul regains consciousness and finds himself bedridden with broken legs and a dislocated shoulder. Annie claims to be his \"number one fan\" and talks at length about him and his novels. She offers to look after him until the telephone lines are re-connected and the local roads re-open following the blizzard. Out of gratitude, Paul lets her read his new manuscript. She is angered by the profanity in his new work, disturbing him, but apologizes. When she reads the latest ''Misery'' novel and discovers that Misery dies at the end, she flies into a rage, revealing to Paul that nobody knows where he is and that she had never informed any kind of authority or his agent that she had rescued him, effectively holding him prisoner in her secluded home.\n\nAnnie forces Paul to burn the only copy of his new manuscript. When he is well enough to get out of bed, she forces him to begin writing a new novel titled ''Misery's Return'', in which he brings the character back to life. One day, when Annie is away, Paul begins stockpiling his painkillers. He tries poisoning Annie during dinner by spiking her wine with crushed painkillers but fails after she accidentally knocks over her glass. He later finds a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about Annie's past. Annie was tried for the deaths of several infants in the hospital where she worked, but the trial collapsed due to lack of evidence. Annie had quoted lines from his ''Misery'' novels during her trial. When Annie discovers that Paul has been sneaking out of his room, she breaks his ankles with a sledgehammer to prevent him from escaping again.\n\nThe local sheriff, Buster, is investigating Paul's disappearance. Clues lead him to pay Annie a visit but she fatally shoots him when he finds Paul drugged in the basement; she then attempts to kill Paul in a [[murder-suicide]], but Paul, concealing a can of lighter fluid in his pocket, convinces her to let him live long enough to finish the novel in order to \"give Misery back to the world.\"\n\nWhen the manuscript is done, Paul asks for a cigarette and champagne, to which Annie complies, but to her horror Paul uses the lighter to set the manuscript on fire, telling her, \"I learned it from you.\" Paul then strikes Annie with the typewriter after she tries futilely to save the manuscript, and they engage in a violent struggle, with Paul suffering a gunshot wound to the shoulder from her [[revolver]]. He trips her, causing her to strike her head on the typewriter, then crawls out of the room, but Annie attacks again. Paul grabs a metal [[doorstop]] and bashes Annie in the face, finally killing her.\n\nEighteen months later, Paul, now walking with a cane, meets his agent, Marcia, in a restaurant in New York City. The two discuss his first post-''Misery'' novel, and Marcia tells him about the positive early buzz. Paul replies that he wrote the novel for himself as a way to help deal with the horrors of his captivity. Marcia asks if he would consider a non-fiction book about his captivity, but Paul\u2014who suffers [[psychological trauma]] from the experience\u2014declines. Paul then sees Annie approaching him, only to realize that he is hallucinating. In actuality, the figure he sees is a waitress, who tells Paul that she is his number one fan, causing Paul to meekly reply, \"That's very sweet of you.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Caan]] as Paul Sheldon\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as [[Annie Wilkes]]\n* [[Richard Farnsworth]] as Sheriff Buster\n* [[Frances Sternhagen]] as Deputy Virginia\n* [[Lauren Bacall]] as Marcia Sindell\n* [[Graham Jarvis]] as Libby\n* Jerry Potter as Pete\n[[J.
