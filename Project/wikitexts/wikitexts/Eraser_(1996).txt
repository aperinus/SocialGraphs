It received mixed reviews from critics, but they praised Williams's and Schwarzenegger's performances, the action sequences and the visual effects.

After erasing mobster-turned-informant Johnny Casteleone and his wife, John is given a new assignment by his superior, Arthur Beller, to protect Lee Cullen, a senior executive at defense contractor Cyrez Corporation. Lee has alerted the [[FBI]] that her fellow Cyrez executives have secretly financed the creation of an advanced [[Railgun|electromagnetic rifle]], which they intend to sell on the black market to enrich themselves.\n\nAs part of an FBI sting operation, Lee downloads data from the weapon's development onto two discs: one for the FBI and one for herself. Cyrez Vice President William Donohue detects Lee's intrusion and summons her for a meeting. After finding Lee's hidden camera and threatening her with a [[revolver]], Donohue commits suicide. Lee delivers the disc but refuses John's offer to go into witness protection, believing the FBI was willing to sacrifice her to nail the conspirators. The FBI's disc is secretly replaced with a fake on the orders of [[Under Secretary of Defense]] Daniel Harper, the conspiracy's mastermind.\n\nThat night, Lee is ambushed in her own home by mercenaries sent by Cyrez CEO Eugene Morehart. John rescues Lee and erases her, setting her up in a new identity and keeping her location a secret even from WITSEC. John learns from his mentor, Marshal Robert DeGuerin, that several witnesses he had previously helped have been murdered due to a mole in WITSEC leaking information, and that the agency is now transferring all protected witnesses to new locations. Accompanied by Marshals Calderon, Schiff, and a new recruit named Monroe, John helps DeGuerin raid a remote cabin and rescue a female witness from a team of assassins, but DeGuerin then discreetly murders the witness as well when she overhears one of her captors reveal that he is the mole.\n\nFlying back to DC, DeGuerin drugs an increasingly suspicious John, who manages to warn Lee before losing consciousness. The warning call is traced to [[New York City]] and DeGuerin kills Monroe using John's gun, framing him as the mole. Revealing he, Calderon, and Schiff are corrupt, DeGuerin explains that they are the go-betweens for a wealthy buyer who plans to purchase the rifle, and John [[HALO jump|escapes]] from the plane to rescue Lee from the same mercenaries who tried to kill her once before. John and Lee flee through the [[Central Park Zoo]]; John releases several [[alligator]]s to trap and kill the mercenaries.\n\nDeGuerin has John and Lee branded as fugitives. With help from Johnny, they infiltrate Cyrez Corporation and use a mainframe backdoor in Donohue's terminal to decrypt Lee's second disc. The disc reveals that a huge shipment of EM rifles has been stashed at the docks in [[Baltimore]] and that the buyer is [[Russian Mafia]] boss Sergei Ivanovich Petrofsky, who plans to resell the weapons overseas to [[terrorism|terrorists]]. The company detects the intrusion, pinpoints their whereabouts, and remotely erases the disc; DeGuerin then kidnaps Lee and takes her to the docks as the shipment is being loaded onto Petrofsky's Russian-flagged freighter.\n\nJohnny contacts his mobster cousin, Tony Two-Toes, who controls the docks; angered that he's being cut out of the deal, he has his men assist John. They kill Petrofsky, his henchmen, Calderon, and Schiff. In a struggle atop a shipping container, DeGuerin tries to shoot Lee, but John comes to her aid and destroys the pulley system on the [[container crane]], dropping DeGuerin and the container to the ground and exposing the presence of the EM rifles. John secures the critically wounded DeGuerin, leaving him to be detained by Beller and the authorities and proving his and Lee's innocence. Weeks later, John brings Lee to a hearing for DeGuerin, Harper, and Morehart, who are indicted for treason. However, it quickly becomes clear that without solid evidence, all three men will likely be acquitted in court. Soon after, John fakes his and Lee's deaths in an explosion as they are leaving the courthouse. \n\nIn the back of their limousine, DeGuerin congratulates Harper thinking he planned the explosion to get rid of the only witnesses against them but is surprised when Harper replies that he thought DeGuerin planned it. The men are confused, then shocked as their limo stops at a railroad crossing and the driver \u2013 a disguised Johnny \u2013 locks the doors and exits the vehicle. John calls DeGuerin and tells him, \"You've just been erased\". Seconds later, a massive freight train plows through the limousine, killing all three men in a staged accident. Driving away, Johnny waves goodbye to John as he walks over to Lee in a waiting car. When Lee asks Kruger what happened he replies: \"They caught a train.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as U.S. Marshal John \"Eraser\" Kruger \n* [[Vanessa Williams]] as Lee Cullen\n* [[James Caan]] as U.S. Marshal Robert DeGuerin\n* [[James Coburn]] as U.S. Marshal WITSEC Chief Arthur Beller\n* [[Robert Pastorelli]] as Johnny Casteleone\n* [[James Cromwell]] as William Donohue, Vice President of International Division at Cyrez and Cullen's supervisor \n* [[Danny Nucci]] as WITSEC US Deputy Marshal Monroe\n* [[Andy Romano]] as [[Under Secretary of Defense]] Daniel Harper\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as Tony \"Two-Toes\"\n* [[Olek Krupa]] as Sergei Ivanovich Petrofsky\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as Eugene Morehart\n* [[Nick Chinlund]] as Calderon\n* [[Michael Papajohn]] as Schiff\t\n* [[K.

Speaking about this scene, director Russell says: \"These things are jigsaw puzzle pieces not only within shooting sequence but within each shot.  You had elements that were live action, elements that were miniature, sometimes computer-generated, and they're all married together in the final processing.\"<ref name=\"eraserprodnotes\" /> Some of the physical [[stunt]]s were performed by Schwarzenegger himself. For the \"aerial\" stunt Arnold was required to fall {{convert|65|feet}} in vertical descent and perform a back flip in mid-flight.  The shot took seven takes to get right.  In the final film, Kruger appears to drop along the length of the fuselage and past the flaming engine of the jet thanks to inventive camera angles and [[special effect]]s.\n\n===Post production===\nThe original name of the Cyrez corporations was \"Cyrex\".
