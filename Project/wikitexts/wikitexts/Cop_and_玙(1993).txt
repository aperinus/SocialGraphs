Golden II]], and [[Ray Sharkey]] in his final role.  Reynolds plays a veteran cop who reluctantly takes an eight-year-old boy (Golden) as his partner to solve a murder investigation.\n\n''Cop and a Half'' opened at #1 in the US and grossed $40.7 million worldwide against a $4 million budget. The film was followed by a lower budget, direct-to-DVD sequel, ''Cop and a Half: New Recruit'' (2017).\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=September 2015}}\nDevon Butler ([[Norman D. Golden II]]) is an eight-year-old boy who lives in [[Tampa]] with his grandmother and dreams of being a [[police officer|cop]]. He watches police TV shows, knows police procedures and plays cops and robbers with his friend Ray (Sammy Hernandez). One day, while snooping around in a warehouse, he witnesses a murder. He goes to the police, who want the information but he refuses to give it unless they make him a cop. They place him in the care of veteran Detective Nick McKenna ([[Burt Reynolds]]), who dislikes children and the two team up in a comic series of events to find the killer and take down a drug kingpin who ordered the hit.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Detective Nick McKenna<ref>{{cite news|title= Florida Son Burt Reynolds Comes Of Age|publisher= [[Orlando Sentinel]]|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-06-29/lifestyle/9206280509_1_burt-reynolds-reynolds-plays-reynolds-today|access-date=2011-01-11}}</ref>\n* [[Norman D.
