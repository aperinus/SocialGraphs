He fills his days by sometimes taking piano lessons in an effort to emulate his late wife, a classical concert pianist, and infrequently works on a new book. When he is asked to present a paper at an [[academic conference]] at [[New York University]], he is not enthusiastic to make the trip, given he is only the nominal co-author and has never even read the complete work. Charles, his department head, insists and Walter is forced to attend.\n\nWhen he arrives in his old apartment in [[Manhattan]], Walter is startled to find a young unmarried couple living there, having rented it from a swindler who claimed it was his. Tarek is an immigrant from Syria, a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]]-[[Syria]]n<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ukscreen.com/review/the-visitor/ |title=The Visitor \u2013 Review |first=Husam Sam |last=Asi |work=UKScreen |date=July 4, 2008 |access-date=February 2, 2015}}</ref> [[djembe]] player, and Zainab is a [[Senegal]]ese designer of ethnic jewelry. He later discovers both are [[illegal immigrants]]. Although they have no place to go, they hastily pack and leave, but Walter decides to let them stay. Over the next few days, a friendship slowly develops. Tarek teaches Walter to play the drum, and the two men join a group of others at a regular [[drum circle]] in [[Central Park]].\n\nOn the way home, Tarek is mistakenly charged with [[New York City Subway|subway]] [[turnstile]] jumping, arrested for \"failing\" to pay his fare (although he actually had), and taken to a [[Immigration detention#United States|detention center]] for illegal immigrants in [[Queens]]. In order to prevent Tarek's [[deportation]] from the United States, Walter hires an immigration lawyer. Feeling uncomfortable about remaining in the apartment with Walter, Zainab moves out to live with relatives in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]].\n\nTarek's mother, Mouna, unexpectedly arrives from her home in [[Michigan]] when she is unable to contact her son. Because she is also illegally in the States, she is also unable to visit him at the detention center. Hesitating, she accepts Walter's offer to stay in the apartment, and the two develop a friendship. Walter confesses his life is unfulfilling; he dislikes the single course he has taught for twenty years, and the book he is allegedly writing is nowhere near completion. It is revealed that Mouna's journalist husband died following a lengthy politically motivated imprisonment in Syria, and she is concerned about her son's future prospects if he is deported. The two begin to share a simple domestic existence, with Mouna preparing meals and Walter treating her to ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' when she mentions her love for the original cast recording Tarek sent her as a gift.\n\nWithout warning, Tarek is summarily deported back to Syria. Mouna, left with no one in the States, decides to follow him and to return to live there. On their final night, Mouna joins Walter for a comforting embrace in bed, blaming herself for all that has gone wrong. Walter sees her off at the airport the next day. Alone once again, Walter plays his drum on a subway platform, as Tarek once told him he himself would like to do some time.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Walter Vale: McCarthy had Jenkins in mind from the beginning because he has an \"amazing and wonderful everyman quality\" which helped create the character.  After two and a half years of writing he worked with Jenkins to finalize it.<ref name=\"CSinterview\" />\n* [[Haaz Sleiman]] as Tarek: Before this role Sleiman had never played the drums and had to practice three hours a day for a month and a half.  After watching a documentary on [[Fela Kuti]], Sleiman came up with the idea for Tarek to rehearse in his underwear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aroundphilly.com/aroundphillycom-interview-haaz-sleiman-philadelphia-movies-theatre/a-4811 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722081445/http://www.aroundphilly.com/aroundphillycom-interview-haaz-sleiman-philadelphia-movies-theatre/a-4811 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 22, 2012 |title=Aroundphilly.com Interview: Haaz Sleiman |author=Kramer, Gary |work=Aroundphilly.com |date=April 24, 2008 |access-date=January 8, 2010 }}</ref>\n* [[Danai Gurira]] as Zainab\n* [[Hiam Abbass]] as Mouna\n* [[Richard Kind]] as Jacob\n* [[Michael Cumpsty]] as Charles\n* [[Marian Seldes]] as Barbara\n\n==Production==\nThe story for the film started with the characters of Tarek and Walter.

It is possible to imagine a version of this story&nbsp;... that would be obvious and sentimental, an exercise in cultural condescension and liberal masochism. Indeed, it\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine it any other way. And yet, astonishingly enough, Mr. McCarthy has. Much as ''[[The Station Agent]]'' nimbly evaded the obstacles of cuteness and willful eccentricity it had strewn in its own path, so does ''The Visitor'', with impressive grace and understatement, resist potential triteness and phony uplift.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=A.
