Clara's mother, a vengeful witch, curses the next Wilhern daughter to be born with the snout of a pig; the curse may only be broken when \"one of her own kind\" learns to love her. For generations, only sons are born into the family, until Penelope Wilhern ([[Christina Ricci]]) is born. Ashamed of her daughter's pig face, Penelope's mother Jessica ([[Catherine O'Hara]]) claims Penelope died shortly after her birth and shuts her away in their mansion. Once Penelope turns 18, her parents begin attempting to find her a potential husband, interpreting the curse's counter as the love of a man of equal social status.\n\nFor the next seven years, all of Penelope's suitors flee in terror upon seeing her face, including Edward Humphrey Vanderman III ([[Simon Woods]]). Conspiring with tabloid reporter Lemon ([[Peter Dinklage]]) to photograph Penelope's face, Vanderman pays young blue blood Max Campion ([[James McAvoy]]) to pose as a new suitor for Penelope, hiding a camera in his jacket. After having conversations through a one-way mirror, Max and Penelope develop genuine feelings for each other; however, when Max sees her face, he is shocked (but not frightened) and accidentally triggers the camera. Regretful about his attempts to exploit Penelope, Max calls off his agreement with Lemon and Vanderman (though Jessica and matchmaker Wanda catch him doing so) and destroys the camera. Penelope tells Max that the curse will be broken if they marry, but he declines.\n\nTired of the match-making and inspired by Max's conversations about the outside world, Penelope flees home and journeys out into the city, selling photos of herself to Lemon while covering her nose with a scarf in public to keep anonymous. She is spotted by her parents and runs back to the bar she frequents before passing out, leading her friend Annie ([[Reese Witherspoon]]) to remove the scarf and reveal her as the elusive Penelope to the other guests. Penelope becomes an overnight celebrity, gaining adoring fans who are not disgusted by her face.\n\nMeanwhile, Edward\u2019s father, having seen the public's fondness for Penelope and embarrassed by his son's vocal cruelty toward her, coerces Edward into proposing to her. Lemon eventually discovers that the real Max Campion is imprisoned for armed robbery; the Campion they have been working with is actually a man named Johnny Martin. Lemon relays this to Jessica and Wanda, but Jessica chooses not to let Penelope know the truth. During her wedding, Penelope realizes that she does not want to marry simply to break the curse and that she likes herself the way she is. This breaks the curse, as Penelope has been loved by \"one of her own kind\" \u2013 herself \u2013 and her pig snout and ears disappear.\n\nYears later, Penelope becomes an elementary school horticulture teacher, and the public's interest in her dissipates. She eventually learns from Wanda the truth about Johnny. She reunites with Johnny, who is unaware that the curse was broken, at a Halloween party while wearing a mask. Johnny kisses Penelope, and she takes off her mask, revealing to him that she had the power to lift the curse all along.\n\nThe Wilhern butler, Jake, is revealed to be the witch who cast the original curse, and casts one final spell to render Jessica permanently [[Mutism|mute]] before quitting his position. While Johnny and Penelope are at a park, Lemon discreetly approaches the two and attempts to take a photo to prove that Penelope's curse has been lifted, but ultimately decides against it and lets go of his obsession with the Wilherns.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Penelope Wilhern, a girl who was born with the face of a pig\n** Andi Marie-Townsend portrays a younger Penelope Wilhern\n* [[James McAvoy]] as John \"Johnny\" Martin, a man who uses the alias of \"Max Campion\"\n** [[Nick Frost]] plays the real Max Campion, a man who was cut off from his family due to his gambling problems\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Jessica Wilhern, the mother of Penelope\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as Lemon, a tabloid reporter who plans to reveal Penelope's existence\n* [[Richard E.
