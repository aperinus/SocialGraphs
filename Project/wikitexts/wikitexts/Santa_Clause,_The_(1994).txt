The franchise will continue with a follow-up limited series ''[[The Santa Clauses]]'' (2022) on [[Disney+]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nSuccessful toy salesman Scott Calvin prepares to spend [[Christmas Eve]] with his son Charlie. Scott wants Charlie to maintain his belief in [[Santa Claus]], despite not believing himself. Scott's former wife, Laura, and her psychiatrist husband Dr. Neil Miller, both stopped believing in Santa at a young age and feel that Charlie needs to do so as well (after an older kid made Charlie upset by saying Santa isn't real).\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Scott burns the turkey so he and Charlie go to [[Denny's]] for dinner. That night, they are awakened by a noise on the roof. Scott startles a man wearing a [[Santa suit]] standing on the roof, who slips and falls to the ground. The dead man's body vanishes, leaving behind a red suit and business card that states: \"If something should happen to me, put on my suit. The reindeer will know what to do.\" Scott dons the suit and spends the rest of the night delivering gifts before the reindeer take them to the North Pole. Bernard the head elf explains that, by putting on the suit, Scott is subject to a legal technicality known as \"The Santa Clause\", and has accepted all of Santa's duties and responsibilities. Bernard gives Scott eleven months to get his affairs in order before reporting back to the North Pole on Thanksgiving. Confused and overwhelmed, Scott changes into the pajamas provided to him and falls asleep.\n\nAwakening in his own bed, Scott thinks it was all a dream until he realizes he is wearing the pajamas. When Charlie proudly tells his class that Scott is Santa, Laura, Neil, and the principal ask Scott to tell Charlie that it was a dream but Scott instead asks him to keep it to themselves. Over the course of the year, strange things begin to happen to Scott. The first thing to appear is a beard, which always re-grows, even immediately after shaving. He also develops a fondness for Christmas treats, primarily milk and cookies. The taste for these newfound treats cause Scott to gain an inordinate amount of weight seemingly overnight and he balloons to 192lbs, which at first he thinks he is just bloated. He also begins losing the coloring of his hair, turning it stark white. Scott's doctor says his weight gain is just fluctuation, even when Scott insists that gaining 45lbs in a week is not right and the changing of his hair color is because he is middle aged. His rapid weight gain results in his clothing not fitting and he results to wearing sweatpants. Scott's weight gain becomes evident to his coworkers when he orders dessert items which he says are \"sides\" and claims he was stung by a bee to try to hide his weight gain. During a meeting with his company, Scott disrupts the meeting to call out their idea of promoting a television advertisement of Santa riding a toy tank. Scott's boss Mr. Whittle takes him aside and asks him to get some help. He also begins to recount 'naughty' and 'nice' children by name after getting his \"list\" of children in the mail. After Laura and Neil witness children wanting to sit on Scott's lap at Charlie's soccer game they assume Scott is deliberately misleading Charlie and decide to have a judge suspend Scott's visitation rights which devastates him. At Thanksgiving, Scott goes to Laura and Neil's house to say goodbye to Charlie but Neil won't let him anywhere near Charlie. When Neil insists that Scott is not Santa, Charlie shows Scott a magical snow globe that Bernard had given him, finally convincing Scott that he really is Santa. When Laura and Neil allow Scott a minute to talk to Charlie alone, Bernard appears and transports him and Charlie to the North Pole. Thinking Scott has kidnapped Charlie, Laura and Neil call the police.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Scott sets out to deliver the gifts with Charlie in tow. Upon arriving at Laura and Neil's home, Scott is arrested. The elves send a team to break him out of jail. Scott convinces Laura and Neil that he is Santa, and asks Charlie to spend Christmas with them as they are his family too. Laura burns the court papers suspending Scott's visitation rights, and tells Scott he can visit anytime. Bernard appears and tells Charlie that any time he shakes his snow globe his father will appear. Before leaving, Scott gives Laura and Neil the two Christmas presents that they never got as children, which had caused their disbelief in Santa. Scott proves his identity to the police before heading off, and Neil apologizes to Charlie who forgives him.\n\nCharlie summons Scott back with the snow globe and Laura agrees to let Charlie go with Scott in the sleigh to finish delivering the presents.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Scott Calvin / [[Santa Claus]]\n* [[Eric Lloyd]] as Charlie Calvin \n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as Laura Miller  \n* [[Judge Reinhold]] as Dr. Neil Miller \n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Bernard The Head Elf \n* Paige Tamada as Judy The Elf \n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Mr. Whittle  \n* [[Larry Brandenburg]] as Detective Nunzio  \n* [[Jayne Eastwood]] as Judy the Waitress \n* [[Kenny Vadas]] as the E.L.F.S.
