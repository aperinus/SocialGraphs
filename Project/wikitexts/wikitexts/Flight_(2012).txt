Parkes]], [[Laurie MacDonald]], [[Steve Starkey]], Zemeckis and [[Jack Rapke]]. It stars [[Denzel Washington]] as William \"Whip\" Whitaker Sr., an alcoholic airline pilot who miraculously crash-lands his plane after a mechanical failure, saving nearly everyone on board. Immediately following the crash, he is hailed a hero but an investigation soon leads to questions that cast the captain in a different light. The film is loosely inspired by the plane crash of [[Alaska Airlines Flight 261]].\n\nIt received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise going to Zemeckis' direction and Washington's performance, Gatins' screenplay and themes. It was also a commercial success, grossing {{USD|161.8 million}} against its {{USD|31 million}} production budget. ''Flight'' was the first live-action film directed by Zemeckis since ''[[Cast Away]]'' and ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' in 2000, and his first R-rated film since ''[[Used Cars]]'' in 1980.\n\nThe film appeared on multiple critics' year-end top ten lists and received multiple accolades and nominations from various organizations, including two nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Washington) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (Gatins) at the [[85th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries should maintain a word count of 400-700 per WP:FILMPLOT -->\nAirline pilot Captain Whip Whitaker uses [[cocaine]] to stay alert after a sleepless night in his [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] hotel room. He pilots SouthJet Flight 227 to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], which experiences severe [[clear-air turbulence|turbulence]] at takeoff. Co-pilot Ken Evans takes over while Whip discreetly mixes [[vodka]] in his orange juice and takes a nap. He is jolted awake as the plane goes into a steep dive. Unable to regain control, Whip is forced to make a controlled crash landing in an open field, hitting his head and losing consciousness on impact.\n\nWhip awakens in an Atlanta hospital with moderate injuries and is greeted by his old friend Charlie Anderson, who represents the airline's pilots [[Trade union|union]]. He tells Whip that he managed to save 96 out of 102, losing two crew members and four passengers, but mentions his co-pilot is in a coma. Whip sneaks away for a cigarette and meets Nicole Maggen, a [[heroin]] addict recovering from a recent overdose in the same hospital. The next morning, his friend and drug dealer Harling Mays picks him up from the hospital.\n\nHaving retired to his late father's farm, Whip meets Charlie and attorney Hugh Lang, who explain that the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) performed a drug test while he was unconscious. Results showed that Whip was intoxicated during the flight. Hugh promises to get the toxicology report voided on technical grounds and succeeds. Whip visits and soon becomes intimate with Nicole but Whip's drinking habits clash with Nicole's attempts to stay drug-free. Later, he attends a funeral for Katerina, a flight attendant who died in the crash, and with whom Whip had spent the night before the incident. He sees a surviving crew member, Margaret, and asks her to tell the NTSB that he was sober.\n\nWhip pays a visit to his co-pilot Ken Evans after he awakens from his coma. Evans has likely lost much of his ability to walk and may never pilot an airplane again. Although upset, Evans has no intention of telling the NTSB that Whip was drinking. Nicole decides to separate from Whip after he fails to stay sober. Hounding him, the media catches Whip drunk after he spontaneously drives to the home of his ex-wife and son, both of whom resent him. He stays with Charlie until the NTSB hearing, vowing not to drink. The night before the hearing, Charlie and Hugh move Whip to a guarded hotel room with no alcohol. Although his minibar is empty, he finds the door to an adjacent room unlocked and raids the minibar there.\n\nCharlie discovers Whip the next morning, passed out and still drunk. Whip and Charlie call Harling to provide Whip with cocaine, hoping to get him alert enough to make it through the hearing. At the hearing, lead NTSB investigator Ellen Block explains that a damaged [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] assembly [[jackscrew]] was the primary cause of the crash. She commends Whip on his valor and skill, noting that no other pilot was able to land the plane in trial simulations of the crash. She then reveals that two empty vodka bottles were found in the plane's trash, despite beverages not being served to passengers, and that Whip's blood test was excluded for technical reasons. She then states the only other member of the crew to test positive for alcohol was Katerina. Whip pauses, unable to bring himself to blame Katerina for his actions. He collects himself and comes clean, admitting to being intoxicated the day of the crash; he also admits to currently being drunk. A tearful Whip finally admits to having a problem, coming to terms with his alcoholism. \n\nThirteen months later, an imprisoned Whip lecturing a support group of fellow inmates says he is glad to be sober and doesn't regret doing the right thing. Whip is seen looking at pictures of Nicole, family and friends on the wall of his cell, along with greeting cards congratulating him on his first anniversary of being sober. He is working to rebuild his relationship with his son, who visits to speak with him about a college application essay he's working on. It's about \"the most fascinating person that I've never met\". His son begins by asking, \"Who are you?\" As a plane flies overhead, Whip replies, \"That's a good question.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    = [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Kelly Reilly]] in Paris at the film's French premiere, January 2013.\n| width     =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Denzel Washington 2013.jpg\n| width1    = {{#expr: (200 * 750 / 1158) round 0}}\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Kelly Reilly 2013.jpg\n| width2    = {{#expr: (200 * 635 / 1050) round 0}}\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n\n}}\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Whip Whitaker\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Hugh Lang\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Nicole\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Charlie Anderson\n* [[John Goodman]] as Harling Mays\n* [[Melissa Leo]] as Ellen Block\n* [[Tamara Tunie]] as Margaret Thomason\n* [[Nadine Velazquez]] as Katerina Marquez\n* [[Brian Geraghty]] as Ken Evans\n* [[Peter Gerety]] as Avington Carr\n* [[Garcelle Beauvais]] as Deana Coleman\n*Boni Yanagisawa as Camelia Satou\n* Justin Martin as Will\n* [[James Badge Dale]] as Gaunt Young Man\n* [[Piers Morgan]] as Himself\n* [[E.

The airplane in ''Flight'', a two-engine [[T-tail]] jet airliner, appears to be from the same model family as was the plane involved in the Alaska Airlines 261 disaster, a variant of the [[MD-80]]. Many elements from the accident were used in the film, such as the cause of the accident, segments of the radio communication, and the inversion of the airplane.\n\n[[Scroggins Aviation]] Mockup & Effects was hired to supply three decommissioned MD-80 series aircraft that represented the plane in the film, with additional MD-80-series aircraft used for scenes in the cabin and cockpit.<ref>''Flight'' used a former American Airlines MD-82, N442AA, the main fuselage for the crash mock-up,  a more complete nose for filming, and a former Delta Air Lines MD-88, N901DL, and for on stage work, a former Continental Airlines MD-82, N16807. {{cite magazine\n | url = http://www.airlinerworld.com/view_issue.asp?ID=4829\n | title = 'Flight' the Movie\n | magazine = Airliner World Magazine\n | issue = April 2013\n}}</ref><ref name=N>{{cite web|url=http://scrogginsaviation.com/airliner-world-magazine-featured-april-2013-issue-2/ |title= Filming Hollywood's Flights of Fantasy, by Christine Negroni |date= January 7, 2013 |website=Airways|via=Airways Magazine}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Release===\n''Flight'' opened in 1,884 theaters across the US and Canada on November 2, 2012.
