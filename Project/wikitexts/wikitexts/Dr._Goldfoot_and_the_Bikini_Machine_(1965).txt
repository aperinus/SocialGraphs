It is a parody of the then-popular [[spy film]] trend (the title is a spoof of two [[James Bond]] films: the 1962 film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' and the 1964 hit ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''), made using actors from AIP's [[beach party]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] films.\n\nDespite its low production values, the film has achieved a certain [[cult film|cult status]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=600547%7C473995 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025120156/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=600547%7C473995 |archive-date=2016-10-25 |title=Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine}}</ref> for the appearance of horror legend Vincent Price and AIP's [[beach party film]] alumni, its [[in-joke]]s and over-the-top [[sexuality]], the [[claymation]] title sequence designed by [[Art Clokey]], and a title song performed by [[The Supremes]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Three Little Girls From Cool Are We|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Sep 27, 1965|page=C18}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was retitled ''Dr G. and the Bikini Machine'' in England due to a threatened lawsuit from Eon, holder of the rights to the James Bond movies.\n\nThe success of the film on its 1965 release led to a sequel, made the following year, entitled ''[[Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs]]''.<ref name=Villains>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=94\u201395}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nPrice plays the titular [[mad scientist]] who, with the questionable assistance of his resurrected flunky Igor, builds a gang of female [[robot]]s who are then dispatched to seduce and rob wealthy men.<ref name=Villains/> Avalon and Hickman play the bumbling heroes who attempt to thwart Goldfoot's scheme.

Frankie Avalon lifts her head, then looks at the camera and says, \"It can't be!\"  Pregnant with her first child at the time, Funicello was placed in the stocks in order to hide her stomach.\n* [[Harvey Lembeck]] also makes a cameo appearance as his Eric Von Zipper character, enchained along with his motorcycle in Goldfoot's lair. Lembeck also appeared as Goldfoot's assistant, Hugo, in the TV special ''[[The Wild Weird World of Dr. Goldfoot]]''.\n* Among the girls who play Goldfoot's robots are [[Deanna Lund]], three years before joining the cast of [[Irwin Allen]]'s science fiction series ''[[Land of the Giants]]''; [[China Lee]], a former [[Playboy Playmate|''Playboy'' Playmate]] married to [[Mort Sahl]]; Luree Holmes and Laura Nicholson, the daughters of [[James H. Nicholson]]; and [[Alberta Nelson]], who was also in all seven of AIP's Beach Party films as a member of Eric Von Zipper's motorcycle gang, The Rat Pack.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe original idea for this motion picture came from [[James H. Nicholson]], the President of [[American International Pictures]], who wanted to showcase the versatile talents of AIP contract player [[Susan Hart]]. Nicholson provided the story, and is credited as \"James Hartford.\" He hired Robert Kaufman to write the first draft. Director Norman Taurog hired Elwood Ullman to do a rewrite, and Taurog remained intimately involved with the content. Deke Heyward later claimed, without substantiation, that he completely rewrote Robert Kaufman's script.<ref name=\"weaver\">Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, John Brunas, \"[[Louis M. Heyward]]\" ''Science Fiction Stars and Horror Heroes: Interviews with Actors, Directors, Producers and Writers of the 1940s through 1960s'' McFarland (1991) pp.157\u2013158, 166</ref>\n\nThe original title was announced as ''Dr Goldfoot and the Sex Machine'', and the film was to be directed by [[William Asher]].<ref>{{cite news|title=MOVIE CALL SHEET: SPIEGEL TO FILM 'SWIMMER'|date=Mar 19, 1965|work=Los Angeles Times|page=D13}}</ref> Taurog shortly thereafter assumed the helm as director, and [[Dwayne Hickman]] joined the cast. Filming began in late summer 1965, with one of AIP's largest-ever budgets.<ref name=\"chris\"/> It was the first AIP movie to cost over a million dollars.<ref name=\"norman\"/>\n\n[[Vincent Price]] stated in a 1987 interview with [[David Del Valle]] that the original script was a [[camp (style)|camp]] [[Musical film|musical]], comparing it to ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''. Price stated, \"It could have been fun, but they cut all the music out\", though he is not clear whether the footage was actually shot or the idea was abandoned during production. According to [[Susan Hart]]:\n\n<blockquote>One of the best scenes I've seen on film was Vincent Price singing about the bikini machine \u2013 it was excellent. And I was told it was taken out because Sam Arkoff thought that Vincent Price looked too fey. But his character was fey! By taking that particular scene out, I believe they took the explanation and the meat out of that picture... It was a really unique explanatory scene and Vincent Price was beautiful in it, right on the money.<ref>Weaver, Tom. \"Susan Hart\", ''Double Feature Creature Attack: A Monster Merger of Two More Volumes of Classic Interviews'', McFarland, 2003. p.138</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Norman Taurog's biographer:\n\n<blockquote>The original plan had been to follow the AIP formula and have songs integrated throughout the film, but Norman brought in Elwood Ullman to do a rewrite ... and the final script read like a good-natured spoof on the [[James Bond]] films with no songs. This apparently disappointed Vincent Price, who had been looking forward to singing.<ref name=\"norman\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Shooting===\nThe film is notable for its scenic photography of San Francisco. The streetcar scene was filmed at the [[West Portal, San Francisco|West Portal]] tunnel. Filming went for over 30 days, taking place on location in San Francisco and on the backlots at the Producers Studio and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Studios. The day after the company returned from San Francisco, [[Watts Riots|rioting broke out in Watts in South Los Angeles]]. On August 30, the unit moved to MGM Studios Lot 2 to shoot on their \"New York Street\" set for a couple of days before returning to the Producers Studio.<ref name=\"norman\"/>\n\nThe climactic chase sequence was filmed in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. The stuntmen included Carey Loftin, Paul Stader, Troy Melton, Jerry Summers, Ronnie Ron-dell, Bob Harris, Louis Elias, David Sharpe, Harvey Parry, and Bill Hickman.<ref name=\"norman\">Michael A. Hoey, ''Elvis' Favorite Director: The Amazing 52-Film Career of Norman Taurog'', Bear Manor Media 2013</ref>\n\nWhen designing Goldfoot's lair, [[Daniel Haller]] re-used some of his designs from 1961's ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum (1961 film)|The Pit and the Pendulum]]''.  Stock footage of battleships from another AIP release, ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla|Godzilla vs. The Thing]]'' appears during the climax.\n\nSusan Hart's hair was done by [[Jon Peters]].<ref>pp. 138-139 Weaver</ref>\n\n===Accident===\nDuring filming in Los Angeles, the city was gripped by a heatwave. Sometimes temperatures on one of the sound stages reached over {{convert|100|F|C}} by mid-afternoon. On the afternoon of August 15, 1965, the company was returning from lunch when one of the electricians, Roy Hicks, passed out from the heat and fell to his death from a catwalk.<ref name=\"norman\"/>\n\n===Theme song===\nThe theme song was recorded by [[The Supremes]] as a single-sided unreleased [[promotional single]].<ref>Ribowsky, M.
