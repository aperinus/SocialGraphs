It is based on the novel by [[Cathleen Schine]]. The original music score was composed by [[Luis Enriquez Bacalov]]. The film takes place in the New England town of Loblolly-by-the-Sea and was filmed in Rockport, Massachusetts.\n\nThis was Kate Capshaw's final film before her retirement from acting in 2001.\n\n== Plot ==\nRecently divorced Helen MacFarquhar, a middle-aged bookseller, after sending her daughter off to summer camp, is ready to move on in her life. One morning, going through the mail, she discovers an anonymous blue love letter, without an envelope or a name. Having discovered this letter in ''her'' mail, in ''her'' bookstore, she naturally thinks it is for her. The only question is, from whom?\n\nAt first, she thinks it is from George Matthias, the local fireman, but decides it couldn't be him, after giving him subtle hints (\"Have you ever been 'on fire'?\"). Not having any idea who may be the writer of the love letter, she just puts it away in her purse, trying to forget about it.\n\nThen, Johnny, a college student working in Helen's bookstore for the summer, is invited to her house for dinner. At dinner she puts two wine glasses and a bottle next to her purse, with the letter in it. Helen accidentally knocks the letter out of the purse. While in the kitchen cooking, she tells Johnny to have some wine. Finding the letter, he mistakenly thinks it is for him from Helen, Later that night, he begins to \"peel an orange\", a line from the letter. Believing it's his hint, Helen rushes into the house and says goodnight, and Johnny leaves. In the next few weeks, Johnny and Helen meet and begin an affair, each thinking the other wrote the letter.\n\nHelen goes to the bookstore, bringing the letter with her, in her purse on the desk. Then, her manager, Janet Hall, arrives, but she decides not to tell her about the letter just yet. While she is upstairs working, George comes in with new smoke detectors for the store. Janet accepts them, but the desk collapses, along with Helen's purse, which contains the letter. In all the chaos, the letter is mixed in with the instruction manuals for the smoke detectors. George, before leaving, says \"Make sure you read the manuals first.\" Janet opens the manual, and the letter falls out. She reads it and thinks it is from George. Later that day, she rushes over to tell Helen about the letter. But Helen, not knowing how to say it, just takes it and says \"It's mine\". Janet, angry at Helen for not having faith in her happiness, quits.\n\nAs the story progresses, many others accidentally find the letter and mistakenly think it's meant for them. During the affair, Johnny uses his friend Jennifer's affections for him to make Helen jealous. However, she's disheartened to realize he was using her. An officer also finds the letter, thinking it was from a lady he admires; he takes it, presenting it to her on a date, but she thinks he wrote the letter to her.\n\nAs the affair goes on, Johnny's feelings deepen, and he becomes jealous of Helen's closeness with George. He continues to try to push for a real relationship; however, she is torn due to her feelings for George. When it comes to a boiling point, the pair realize that neither side wrote the love letter. Helen also realizes that George still loves her when she finds a message he left in a postcard.\n\nThey break up on amiable terms but, unfortunately, George hears the breakup and is left heartbroken and confused. Though his divorce is final, he feels he's lost Helen to Johnny. She isn't ready to let go of her feelings for George and asks if it really is over. He quietly replies \"They have bad timing\" and announces he's taking his daughters to New York.\n\nThough Helen wants him to stay, George seems determined to leave. The next day, she tells him she only recently saw the inside message he left her and declares she also wants to keep in contact. Hinting he still wants to continue their relationship, George smiles and says he'll send a \"postcard\".\n\nAmidst all the confusion, it is revealed that the letter was actually written by Helen's mother's lover, another woman, early in her life. Considering the conservative period and social stigma, the relationship could not be until now.\n\n== Main cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! Actor !!

[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' mentioned feeling particularly betrayed when seeing the film and realizing that the mysterious love letter that he had received was actually a copy of the one in the film. He tells this story on the May 6, 2005 episode of ''[[This American Life]]'', \"Not What I Meant\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisamericanlife.org/288/not-what-i-meant|title = Not What I Meant|date = 6 May 2005}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0166252|title=The Love Letter}}\n* {{Amg movie|179890|The Love Letter}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=1090771-love_letter|title=The Love Letter}}\n* {{Mojo title|loveletter}}\n\n{{Peter Chan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Love Letter, The}}\n[[Category:1990s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Chan]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on romance novels]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Luis Bacalov]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1999 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
