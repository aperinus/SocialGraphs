It was also written by [[Allan Loeb]] and Rock Reuben with music by [[Rupert Gregson-Williams]]. The film co-stars [[Henry Winkler]] and [[Salma Hayek]]. It was produced by [[Happy Madison Productions]]. The film was released in the United States on October 12, 2012 by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film's title is taken from the song \"[[Boom (P.O.D. song)|Boom]]\" by [[Christian metal|Christian]] [[nu metal|nu-metal]] band [[P.O.D.]]\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[Collegiate wrestling|collegiate wrestler]] Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sonypictures.com/movies/herecomestheboom|title=Here Comes the Boom \u2013 Sony Pictures Entertainment|website=www.sonypictures.com}}</ref> Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being [[Layoff|laid off]]. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the $48,000 necessary to keep the music program. He [[:wikt:moonlighting#Noun|moonlights]] as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko requests outside tutoring. When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko is a former MMA fighter. While watching the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives $10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA.\n\nScott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only $750 to the loser. Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out opponent \"Lucky\" Patrick Murray and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his goal. While Marty trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs. Scott then begins fighting in small MMA fights and gradually gains greater amounts of money for the school.\n\nScott has been pursuing the school nurse, Bella Flores, and they share moments flirting with each other, while also rekindling Scott's passion for teaching. He begins to engage the class and earns the respect of his students. Scott is within $6,000 of his goal when Mark tells him that Niko turned down a sanctioned UFC fight offered by [[Joe Rogan]], with the certainty of earning $10,000 for a loss. Scott confronts Niko, who apologizes and admits he turned it down because he was jealous as he was once asked to fight at the UFC but suffered a neck injury while training, ending his career. Scott and Niko accept the offer, and they travel to the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] for the fight. The night he arrives, Bella calls Scott to tell him that the school's vice principal Robert Elkins has been arrested for [[embezzling]] from the school, including Scott's winnings. All Scott's efforts have been in vain, and he decides he must win the fight and the $50,000.\n\nThe publicity of Scott's rise to fame has grown, and the school's band appears in the stands to play his theme song, \"[[Holly Holy]]\" by [[Neil Diamond]], thanks to Bella contacting Rogan. During the fight, Marty reminds the losing Scott that even if he does not win, he has inspired the students, which is their real purpose as teachers. Scott has no answer to his dangerous opponent Ken Dietrich, who is angered that his original opponent canceled and that he is stuck with a man that \"does not deserve\" to be fighting at the UFC. Scott struggles to survive the first two rounds, but after finding inspiration from the students, he manages to win in the third and final round of the fight, earning $50,000 and Dietrich's respect. Scott and Bella kiss through the chain link fence of the ring.\n\nIn the closing scene, the music program is saved, the school is operating on a normal budget thanks to Scott's donation and Niko and all of the students in Scott's citizenship class attend their American citizenship ceremony.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin James]] as Scott Voss\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Bella Flores\n* [[Henry Winkler]] as Marty Streb\n* [[Greg Germann]] as Duke Betcher\n* [[Joe Rogan]] as Himself\n* [[Gary Valentine]] as Eric Voss\n* [[Jake Zyrus]] as Malia De La Cruz\n* [[Bas Rutten]] as Niko\n* Nikki Tyler-Flynn as Mollie Streb\n* [[Reggie Lee (actor)|Reggie Lee]] as Mr. De La Cruz\n* [[Jason Miller (fighter)|Jason Miller]] as \"Lucky\" Patrick Murray\n* [[Mark Mu\u00f1oz]] as Romero\n* [[Melissa Peterman]] as Lauren Voss\n* Shelly Desai as Miguel\n* [[Bruce Buffer]] as Himself\n* [[Krzysztof Soszynski]] as Ken \"The Executioner\" Dietrich\n* [[Satoshi Ishii]] as Fairgrounds Fighter\n* [[Mark DellaGrotte]] as Himself\n* [[Herb Dean]] as Himself\n* [[Arianny Celeste]] as Penelope \"Pinche Punisher\" Lopez\n* Mookie Barker as Vice Principal Elkins\n* [[Mike Goldberg]] as Himself\n* [[Wanderlei Silva]] as Himself\n* [[Chael Sonnen]] as Arguing fighter\n* [[Jacob Duran|Jacob \"Stitch\" Duran]] as Himself\n* [[Melchor Menor]] as Sityodtong Gym Fighter\n* [[Lenny Clarke]] as Loud Dietrich Fan\n}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming began on March 28, 2011, in and around the [[Boston, Massachusetts]], area.<ref>{{cite web |date= 7 June 2011 |last= McNary |first= Dave |title= Melissa Peterman ready for 'Boom' |url= https://variety.com/2011/film/news/melissa-peterman-ready-for-boom-1118038188/ |website= Variety |quote= currently shooting in Boston }}</ref> Filming continued on through May 25, 2011, in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], where it wrapped shortly thereafter, by early June 2011.<ref>{{cite web |date= 10 February 2011 |title= Kevin James headed to Quincy, MA for 'Here Comes The Boom' |url= https://onlocationvacations.com/2011/02/10/kevin-james-headed-to-quincy-ma-for-here-comes-the-boom/ |website= On Location Vacations }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Actor Kevin James says old Quincy High had 'great look' for new film |url= http://www.mafilm.org/2012/10/10/actor-kevin-james-says-old-quincy-high-had-great-look-for-new-film/ |website= Massachusetts Film Office }}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n* \"[[Holly Holy]]\" \u2013 versions by [[Neil Diamond]] and [[Charice]] are heard in the film\n* \"[[Upside Down (A-Teens song)|Bouncing off the Ceiling (Upside Down)]]\" by [[A-Teens]]\n* \"[[Joker & the Thief]]\" by [[Wolfmother]]\n* \"Optimus Bellum Domitor\" by Sak, Williams and Welch\n* \"[[Boom (P.O.D. song)|Boom]]\" by [[P.O.D.]]\n* \"Spank\" by [[Jimmy \"Bo\" Horne]]\n* \"[[James Brown Is Dead]]\" by [[L.A.
