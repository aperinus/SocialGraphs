Animation]].\n\nThe film had its broadcast premiere on October 18, 2008 on [[Cartoon Network]]. It was broadcast again on December 20, 2020 on Cartoon Network's nighttime [[Adult Swim]] programming block through [[Toonami]], as a celebration for the then-upcoming release of ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAn unknown entity, named \"The Centre,\" tells its story about how it was born from the Earth itself and has witnessed the evolution of the dinosaurs, the meteor shower, and mankind's evolution. Due to man's capacity for war and violence, the Centre has concluded that they must be eradicated.\n\nAt the end of the [[Korean War]], [[United States Air Force]] pilot [[Hal Jordan]] and his wingman, [[Challengers of the Unknown|Kyle \"Ace\" Morgan]], are attacked by enemy pilots but survive. In Gotham, [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] \u2013 the last survivor of the Green Martian race \u2013 is teleported to Earth; unable to return, J'onn disguises himself. In Las Vegas, [[Iris West]] is on the telephone with her fianc\u00e9 [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] \u2013 also known as the Flash \u2013 at a casino when [[Captain Cold]] arrives to commit robbery; he races from Central City to confront Cold. Flash finds the five bombs hidden by Cold and captures him, before Cold is possessed by an entity.\n\nTwo years later J'onn (as John Jones) is now working as a detective with the Gotham City Police Department, investigating a [[doomsday cult]] that worships the \"[[Dinosaur Island#DC: The New Frontier|Centre]]\" and has kidnapped a child for a sacrificial ritual.  J'onn and his partner [[Slam Bradley]] join [[Batman]] in battling the cult, but a fire renders J'onn powerless. The cult leader is possessed by the entity, and warns of impending judgement. Hal is training under Col. [[Rick Flag]] at Ferris Aircraft for a U.S. government project to build a spacecraft for travel to Mars. Special agent [[King Faraday]] oversees the project.\n\nBatman suggests to J'onn that they work together in investigating the Centre-worshiping cult. After being attacked and nearly subdued by the US government, a disillusioned Flash announces his retirement. J'onn interrogates former Ferris employee Harry Leiter, apprehended for murder while under The Centre's influence, who tells them about the launch to Mars.  When Faraday arrives, J'onn briefly reads his mind and learns Leiter is telling the truth.  Seeing the contemptuous response to the Flash's announcement, J'onn gives his research to Batman and plans to return to Mars on the rocket. J'onn and Faraday fight on the launchpad; the rocket is damaged and malfunctions after leaving Earth's atmosphere. Hal wants to attempt a landing but Flag reveals weapons of mass destruction are on board, intended to destroy all life on Mars. Hal is ejected from the cockpit and saved by [[Superman]]; Flag detonates the rocket as J'onn is held prisoner.\n\nOn [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]], [[Wonder Woman]] is training with [[Mala (Amazon)|Mala]] when the Amazons are attacked by The Centre. As a result of Flag's rocket explosion, a fatally wounded [[Abin Sur]] crash-lands on Earth, gives his ring to Hal and tells him of The Centre, a monstrous creature that seeks the destruction of humans. Meanwhile, Superman and Batman review J'onn's research. Wonder Woman's invisible jet crashes at Cape Canaveral and she warns Superman that The Centre is coming. J'onn decides to help save Earth after his hope for humanity is renewed. The Centre, a massive flying island with an army of mutant dinosaurs to guard it, begins its attack on America.  The Flash, [[Green Arrow]], [[Adam Strange]], the [[Challengers of the Unknown]], and the [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawks]] join forces with the US forces to defend the Cape.  Superman reconnoiters the Centre but is seemingly killed. Moved by his efforts, the heroes plan a frontal assault to provide cover for Hal and Ace while they fly a bombing mission into the creature.  At the same time the Flash, equipped with [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]'s reduction ray, will crisscross the island, hoping to destabilize the island's atomic structure.\n\nThe aerial assault is nearly outmatched, and as a herd of dinosaurs ambush Faraday's ground forces, the Centre's psychic force briefly overwhelms J'onn. Faraday is captured by a dinosaur and both perish after Faraday sets off hand grenades. Hal and Ace shoot their way into The Centre's core but a hallucinogenic attack disorients them. Hal's ring relays instructions from the [[Guardians of the Universe]] on its use. Ace detonates his payload as Hal rescues him. The Flash races across the ocean, leaps onto The Centre's surface and covers it on foot, shrinking the island.  Hal envelops the island in green energy, towing it into space where it explodes. As the team celebrates their victory a glowing light emerges from the water and [[Aquaman]] emerges from a submarine carrying Superman.\n\nThe world celebrates the Centre's defeat with a ceremony. The film ends with a montage of various heroes and villains, including the birth of the [[Justice League]] set to the [[New Frontier|titular John F. Kennedy speech]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[David Boreanaz]] as [[Hal Jordan|Hal Jordan / Green Lantern]]\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz / John Jones / Martian Manhunter]]\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen / The Flash]]\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as [[Ace Morgan]]\n* [[Lucy Lawless]] as [[Wonder Woman|Diana Prince / Wonder Woman]]\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as [[Superman|Kal-El / Clark Kent / Superman]]\n* [[Lex Lang]] as [[Rick Flag]], [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry / Aquaman]] ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]] as [[King Faraday]]\n* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as [[Lois Lane]]\n* [[Brooke Shields]] as [[Carol Ferris]]\n* [[Joe Alaskey]] as [[Bugs Bunny]] (cameo)\n* [[Jeff Bennett]] as Sportscaster\n* [[Corey Burton]] as [[Abin Sur]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Townsend Coleman]] as [[Will Magnus|Dr. Magnus]]\n* [[Keith David]] as [[Dinosaur Island|The Centre]]\n* Sean Donnellan as Haley\n* [[Robin Atkin Downes]] as [[Guardians of the Universe|The Guardian]]\n* Shane Haboucha as [[Dick Grayson|Dick Grayson / Robin]]\n* [[David Hunt (actor)|David Hunt]] as Harry\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] as [[Iris West]]\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Crooner\n* [[Vanessa Marshall]] as [[Mala (Amazon)|Amazon Woman]]\n* [[Jim Meskimen]] as [[Slam Bradley]]\n* [[James Arnold Taylor]] as [[Captain Cold]]\n* [[John F.
