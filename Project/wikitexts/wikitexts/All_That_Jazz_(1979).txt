The screenplay, by [[Robert Alan Aurthur]] and Fosse, is a [[autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical]] [[fantasy]] based on aspects of Fosse's life and career as a dancer, choreographer and director. The film was inspired by Fosse's manic effort to edit his film ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'' while simultaneously staging the 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. It borrows its title from the [[Kander and Ebb]] tune \"[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]\" in that production.\n\nThe film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]]. At the [[52nd Academy Awards]] it was nominated for nine Oscars, winning four: [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\nIn 2001, ''All That Jazz'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1833/year/1980.html|title=ALL THAT JAZZ|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]|access-date=2009-05-25|archive-date=2011-08-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819052253/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1833/year/1980.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Names 25 More Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-01-184/national-film-registry-2001/2001-12-18/|access-date=2020-09-14|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=2020-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115163516/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-01-184/national-film-registry-2001/2001-12-18/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-14|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=2020-10-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201004011540/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJoe Gideon is a theater director and choreographer trying to balance staging his latest Broadway musical, ''NY/LA'', while editing a Hollywood film he has directed, ''The Stand-Up''. He is a workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes and a womanizer who constantly flirts and has [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with a stream of women. Each morning, to keep himself going, he plays a tape of [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and takes doses of [[Visine]], [[Alka-Seltzer]], and [[Dextroamphetamine|Dexedrine]], always finishing by looking at himself in the mirror and telling himself \"It's showtime, folks!\" Joe's ex-wife, Audrey Paris, is involved with the production of the show, but disapproves of his womanizing ways. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Katie Jagger and daughter Michelle keep him company. In his imagination, he flirts with an [[Death (personification)|angel of death]] named Angelique in a nightclub setting, chatting with her about his life.\n\nAs Joe continues to be dissatisfied with his editing job, repeatedly making minor changes to a single monologue, he takes his anger out on the dancers and in his choreography, putting on a highly sexualized number with topless women during one rehearsal and frustrating both Audrey and the show's penny-pinching backers. The only moment of joy in his life occurs when Katie and Michelle perform a Fosse-style number for Joe as an homage to the upcoming release of ''The Stand-Up'', moving him to tears. During a particularly stressful [[Read-through|table-read]] of ''NY/LA'', Joe experiences severe chest pains and is admitted to the hospital with severe [[Angina pectoris|angina]]. Joe brushes off his symptoms, and attempts to leave to go back to rehearsal, but he collapses in the doctor's office and is ordered to stay in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from his exhaustion. ''NY/LA'' is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, continuing to smoke and drink while having endless strings of women come through his room; as he does, his condition continues to deteriorate, despite Audrey and Katie both remaining by his side for support. A negative review for ''The Stand-Up'' \u2014 which has been released during Joe's time in the hospital \u2014 comes in despite the film's monetary success, and Gideon has a massive coronary event.\n\nAs Joe undergoes [[coronary artery bypass surgery]], the producers of ''NY/LA'' realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon's dying: the insurance proceeds would result in a profit of over half a million dollars. As Gideon goes on life support, he directs extravagant musical dream sequences in his own head starring his daughter, wife, and girlfriend, who all berate him for his behavior; he realizes he cannot avoid his own death, and has another heart attack. As the doctors try to save him, Joe runs away from his hospital bed behind their backs and explores the basement of the hospital and the autopsy ward before he allows himself to be taken back. He goes through the [[five stages of grief]] \u2014 anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance \u2014 featured in the stand-up routine he had been editing, and as he gets closer to death, his dream sequences become more and more hallucinatory. As the doctors try one more time to save him, Joe imagines a monumental [[variety show]] featuring everyone from his past where he takes center stage in an extensive musical number (\"Bye Bye Life\", a whimsical parody of [[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|\"Bye Bye Love]]\"). In his dying dream, Joe is able to thank his family and acquaintances as he cannot from his hospital bed, and his performance receives a massive standing ovation. Joe finally dreams of himself traveling down a hallway to meet Angelique at the end, but the film then abruptly cuts to his corpse being zipped up in a [[body bag]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Joe Gideon\n** [[Keith Gordon]] as Young Joe Gideon\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Angelique, The Angel of Death\n* [[Leland Palmer (actress)|Leland Palmer]] as Audrey Paris, Gideon's Ex-Wife\n* [[Ann Reinking]] as Katie Jagger, Gideon's Current Girlfriend\n* [[Cliff Gorman]] as Davis Newman, The \"Stand-Up\"\n* [[Ben Vereen]] as O'Connor Flood\n* Erzs\u00e9bet F\u00f6ldi as Michelle Gideon, Joe's Daughter\n* [[David Margulies]] as Larry Goldie\n* [[Michael Tolan]] as Dr. Ballinger\n* [[Max Wright]] as Joshua Penn\n* [[William LeMassena]] as Jonesy Hecht\n* [[Deborah Geffner]] as Victoria Porter\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Lucas Sergeant\n* [[Jules Fisher]] as Jules\n* [[Chris Chase]] as Leslie Perry, Film Critic\n* [[Anthony Holland (actor)|Anthony Holland]] as Paul\n* [[Sandahl Bergman]], Eileen Casey, Bruce Anthony Davis, Gary Flannery, [[Jennifer Nairn-Smith]], Danny Ruvolo, Leland Schwantes, John Sowinski, Candace Tovar, and Rima Vetter as Principal Dancers\n* [[Ben Masters]] as Dr. Garry\n* [[Phil Friedman]] as The Stage Manager\n* Robert Levine as Dr. Hyman\n* [[C.
