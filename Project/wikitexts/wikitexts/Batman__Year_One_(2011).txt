[[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] moves to Gotham City with his wife, Barbara Gordon, after a transfer from [[Chicago]]. Both are swiftly acquainted with the corruption and violent atmosphere of the city. Gordon tries to focus on purging corruption from the [[Gotham City Police Department]] after witnessing his partner, [[List of DC Comics characters: F#Arnold_John_Flass|Detective Arnold John Flass]], abuses his power as a cop. Unfortunately, several officers led by Flass beat him on the orders from his corrupt superior, [[Gillian B. Loeb|Commissioner Gillian Loeb]]. In revenge, Gordon tracks Flass down, beats him, and leaves him naked and handcuffed in the snow.\n\nBruce believes he is still unprepared to fight against crime despite having the skills he learned from abroad. He goes in disguise on a surveillance mission in Gotham's [[red-light district]], but is reluctantly drawn into a brawl with several prostitutes, [[Holly Robinson (fictional character)|Holly Robinson]] and [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]]. Two police officers shoot Bruce on sight and take him away in their patrol car. Bruce breaks free, flees from the scene and returns to [[Wayne Manor]] barely alive. He sits before [[Thomas Wayne|his father's]] bust, requesting guidance in his war against crime. A bat suddenly crashes through a window and settles on the bust, inspiring him to save Gotham as Batman. \n\nCrimes significantly decline after weeks of Bruce striking as Batman. He even goes after Flass, who is in the middle of accepting a bribe from Jefferson Skeevers, a drug dealer of [[Carmine Falcone|Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone]]. Batman interrupts a dinner party held at the mansion of Gotham's mayor and announces that everyone in the party shall be brought to justice for their crimes someday. Infuriated by Batman's threats, Loeb orders Gordon and GCPD [[Sarah Essen Gordon|Detective Sarah Essen]] to arrest him. The two cops later come across a runaway truck that nearly hits an old lady. Batman manages to save the lady's life while Gordon stops the truck. Batman then flees into an abandoned building where Loeb immediately orders a bomb dropped on. He also sends in a [[SWAT]] team led by a trigger-happy commander, Branden, to kill any survivors left in the building. Batman uses a signal device to attract a swarm of bats from the [[Batcave]] as his only route to escape. After witnessing Batman in action, Selina is inspired to don a costume of her own and begin a life of crime. \n\nGordon and Essen have a brief affair together and spend two months dating. She, however, chooses to leave Gotham upon learning he is going to be the father of Barbara's unborn child. Gordon is left alone to investigate Bruce's connection to Batman. He travels to Wayne Manor with Barbara to interrogate Bruce, who uses his playboy charms to divert suspicion. While leaving the manor, Gordon confesses his affair with Essen to Barbara. Skeevers gets bailed with the help of a hired lawyer, but is attacked by Batman shortly after who convinces him to testify against Flass. Skeevers is drugged with [[rat poison]] as an assassination attempt, so that he remains silent about the ties between the police force and the mafia, although Skeevers survives after all.\n\nBruce sneaks into Falcone's manor as Batman and overhears the private conversation between the Roman and his nephew, Johnny Viti. He predicts their intentions to target Gordon's family, so he disguises himself as a motorcyclist to help Gordon. Gordon leaves home on Loeb's orders, but becomes suspicious and turns back only to discover Viti and his men already holding his family hostage. Viti flees the scene with Gordon's infant son. Gordon chases after him on Bruce's motorcycle. The two men end up fighting on a bridge until the baby falls. Bruce catches up on time and leaps over the bridge's railing to save the baby while Viti dies from the fall. Gordon thanks Bruce for saving his infant son's life and lets him go. Flass supplies Assistant [[District Attorney]] [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] with the evidence and testimony needed to implicate Loeb, who resigns in disgrace. Gordon is promoted to captain and prepares to meet with Batman in order to investigate a potential plot orchestrated by a criminal calling himself the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|Lieutenant James Gordon]]\n* [[Ben McKenzie]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Eliza Dushku]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]\n* [[Jon Polito]] as [[Gillian B.
