Canaris considers it a meaningless exercise that will soon be forgotten by the [[F\u00fchrer]], but he knows this will not be the case with [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Canaris therefore orders staff officer [[Oberst]] Radl to begin the study, to avoid being discredited.\n\nRadl receives intelligence from an ''Abwehr'' sleeper agent in England, saying Churchill will stay in a [[Norfolk]] village near the coast. He begins to see potential in the operation, which he code-names 'Eagle'. Firstly, Radl recruits an agent, an [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|IRA]] man named Liam Devlin, who lectures at a Berlin university. Secondly, he selects Kurt Steiner, a highly decorated and experienced ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' officer, to lead the mission. However, while the [[Luftwaffe]] parachute troops are returning from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], Steiner unsuccessfully attempts to save the life of a Jewish girl who is trying to escape from the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] in [[occupied Poland]]. Steiner and his loyal men are court-martialled, and sent to a [[Strafbataillon|penal unit]] on German-occupied [[Alderney]], where their mission is to conduct near-suicidal [[human torpedo]] attacks against Allied shipping in the [[English Channel]].\n\nRadl is summoned to a private meeting with Himmler, without Canaris' knowledge. Himmler reveals he knows all about the operation, and gives Radl a letter, apparently signed by Hitler, to commence the operation. Radl flies to Alderney, where he recruits Steiner and his surviving men. Operation Eagle involves the German commandos dressing as [[1st Independent Parachute Brigade (Poland)|Polish paratroopers]] to infiltrate the village. They are to capture Churchill, with the help of Devlin, before making their escape by a captured [[motor torpedo boat]]. Once the operation is underway, Himmler retrieves the letter (signed by Hitler) that he had given to Radl, and destroys it.\n\nOn arrival in the English village, the German paratroopers take up positions under the guise of conducting friendly military exercises. However, the ruse is discovered when one of Steiner's men rescues a young girl from certain death beneath the village waterwheel. The soldier dies, and the wheel brings up his mangled corpse. The villagers see he is wearing a German uniform underneath his Polish one (Steiner had not wanted them executed as spies). Steiner's men round up the villagers and hold them captive in the village church, but the vicar's sister escapes and alerts a unit of nearby [[United States Army Rangers#World War II|United States Army Rangers]].\n\nColonel Pitts, the Rangers\u2019 inexperienced and rash commander, launches a poorly planned assault on the church, that results in heavy American casualties. Pitts is later killed by the village's sleeper ''Abwehr'' agent. It's left to Pitts' deputy commander to launch a second attack, this time successful. To delay the Americans, Steiner's men sacrifice themselves to give Devlin, Steiner and his wounded second-in-command time to escape the church through a hidden passage. A local girl, who has fallen for the charming Devlin, helps in the escape. At the waiting [[E-boat|S-boat]], Steiner orders his wounded second-in-command on board, but says he is staying behind to kill Churchill.\n\nOn Alderney, Radl receives news that the operation has failed. He realises that Himmler hadn't ever had Hitler's permission for the mission. Radl is arrested and summarily executed by an SS firing squad under the pretext that he \"exceeded his orders to the point of treason\".\n\nBack in England, Steiner succeeds in killing Churchill moments before being shot dead himself. It is then revealed that the victim was actually a [[Double (occupation)|body double]], and that the real Churchill was on his way to the [[Tehran Conference]]. The torpedo boat is aground, at dead low-tide, awaiting Steiner's return. Meanwhile Devlin, evading capture, leaves a love letter for the local girl, before slipping away.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, with roles as credited, plus Rauch from opening tombstone credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Colonel ([[Oberst]]) Kurt Steiner\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[Liam Devlin]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Colonel (Oberst) Max Radl\n* [[Jenny Agutter]] as Molly Prior\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as [[Heinrich Himmler]]\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as [[Admiral (Germany)|Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Canaris]]\n* [[Jean Marsh]] as Joanna Grey\n* [[Sven-Bertil Taube]] as Captain ([[Hauptmann]]) Hans Ritter von Neustadt\n* [[John Standing]] as Philip Verecker\n* [[Judy Geeson]] as Pamela Verecker\n* [[Treat Williams]] as [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Harry Clark\n* [[Larry Hagman]] as [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Clarence E.
