They are the best of friends, although Nisha is secretly in love with Rahul. Rahul announces his desire to direct a musical named ''Maya''. The members of the troupe, including Nisha, have their doubts about the title character, \"Maya\", who Rahul describes as a girl who believes in true love and waiting for her prince charming who will surely turn up and take her away. Meanwhile, Pooja is introduced, an amazing dancer, classically trained as well, and passionate about dancing. Having been orphaned at a young age, she has been raised by close friends of her parents.\n\nPooja and Rahul have a string of near-misses as they run into each other time and again. Each of these instances is marked by a tune playing in the background, that registers with Pooja. Doted upon by her foster family, Pooja is soon taken to [[Germany]] by her guardian's son Ajay, her childhood best friend who has been in London for months. Just as Ajay leaves to fly to [[London]], he proposes to Pooja. In a dilemma, she ends up accepting it. During rehearsals for the play, Nisha injures her leg and the doctor says she cannot dance for a few months. Rahul needs a new woman to play the lead role in the play. He comes across Pooja dancing one day and believes she is perfect for the role. He begs her to come to their rehearsals and she agrees. Rahul and Pooja become close friends. \n\nNisha soon returns from the hospital and is upset that she has been replaced. Upon learning that Rahul loves Pooja, she becomes very jealous of her. Knowing that Rahul does not reciprocate her love, she decides to leave for London. Throughout rehearsals, Rahul and Pooja find themselves falling for one another. When Rahul drops Pooja home one day, he starts whistling his tune, making Pooja realize that she has fallen for the man with the tune she so often heard. The next day, the two go to meet Pooja's old dance tutor, who Pooja addresses as Tai, who figures that the two are blatantly in love. At the wedding of two members of the dance troupe, Rahul and Pooja share an intimate moment but are unsure how to fully express their love.\n\nA few days before the premiere, Ajay arrives at the rehearsal hall to surprise Pooja while telling everyone that he is her fianc\u00e9. Rahul is heartbroken but tries not to show it. Nisha, who has returned, notices Rahul's devastation and explains how she too was devastated when he did not love her in return. Rahul edits the end of the play to reflect his heartbreak, in contrast to his usual style of always giving a happy ending. On the night of the premiere, as Rahul and Pooja's characters are about to break up on stage, Ajay plays a recorded tape Pooja was going to send him before his proposal where she described how she felt about Rahul. Ajay is indirectly telling Pooja that she and Rahul are meant to be together. Pooja now realizes she truly loves Rahul and the two confess their love on stage as the audience applauds them, giving the play a happy ending once again. Also, backstage, Ajay ends up asking Nisha whether she is already married or not (implying him getting interested in her).\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Shahrukh Khan]] as Rahul\n*[[Madhuri Dixit]] as Pooja\n*[[Karisma Kapoor]] as Nisha\n*[[Akshay Kumar]] as Ajay\n*[[Farida Jalal]] as Ajay's mother\n*[[Deven Verma]] as Ajay's father\n*[[Aruna Irani]] as Pooja's Tai\n*[[Suresh Menon]]\n*[[Rajesh Tandon]]\n*[[Shruti Ulfat]]\n\n== Production ==\n\n''Dil To Pagal Hai'' was the second of [[Yash Chopra|Chopra's]] 4 consecutive films to star [[Shah Rukh Khan]] in the lead role. It was the third film to feature [[Shah Rukh Khan]] opposite [[Madhuri Dixit]], after ''[[Anjaam]]'' (1994) and ''[[Koyla]]'' (1997). The film was originally titled ''Maine To Mohabbat Kar Li'' and ''Tevar'' before Yash Chopra finally settled on ''Dil To Pagal Hai'' as the title.\n\n[[Sridevi]] was initially offered to play the part of Pooja, but she refused it.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Singh|first=Shaista|date=20 June 2018|title=12 Iconic Films That Would Have Been Totally Different Had Sridevi Not Refused Them|url=https://in.bookmyshow.com/entertainment/movies/hindi/12-iconic-films-that-would-have-been-completely-different-had-sridevi-not-refused-them/|access-date=27 October 2020|website=BookMyShow|language=en-US}}</ref> The role then went to Dixit.

Chopra then offered it to [[Juhi Chawla]], as Chopra wanted the 2 leading actresses of that time to appear together on screen. But Chawla did not want to play second-fiddle to Dixit, especially after playing the leading-lady in Chopra's ''[[Darr]]'' (1993). [[Kajol]] and [[Raveena Tandon]] were next offered the role; however, Kajol deemed the role insubstantial, while Raveena Tandon was considering quitting her career at the time. The role was also offered to [[Urmila Matondkar]] who accepted, but left the film after a day of shooting. No leading-lady of that time was willing to take the risk of playing the second lead to Dixit. Chopra finally approached Kapoor with the film and she agreed to take up the challenge and was finally signed for the role.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03U-nfwxzz4 |title=FTF Karisma Kapoor 7-6-2000|work=itv india |access-date=2015-09-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317024512/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03U-nfwxzz4 |archive-date=17 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/tv/6-interesting-moments-of-Madhuri-Juhi-on-Koffee-With-Karan/photostory/30987463.cms | title=6 interesting moments of Madhuri-Juhi on Koffee With Karan | access-date=3 March 2014 | work=The Times of India | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302015400/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/tv/6-interesting-moments-of-Madhuri-Juhi-on-Koffee-With-Karan/photostory/30987463.cms | archive-date=2 March 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She felt that despite the short screen-time, a lot could be achieved with her role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.rediff.com/movies/1999/sep/28kari.htm|title = Rediff on the NeT, Movies: Karisma Kapoor interview}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to writing the story, Chopra co-produced the film along with M.
