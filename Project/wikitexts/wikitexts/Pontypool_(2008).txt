Helicopter reporter Ken Loney calls in with a report about a riot at the office of Dr. Jon Mendez that has resulted in numerous deaths. After Ken is unexpectedly cut off, the group tries to confirm his report, but their witnesses are disconnected before being put on the airwaves. After they are contacted by the [[BBC]] for [[Breaking news|breaking the story]], Ken calls back and says he has taken refuge in a grain silo. He describes the rioters as trying to eat one another or even themselves. When one of the rioters attacks the silo, Ken's call is interrupted by an audio transmission in French.\n\nLaurel-Ann translates the transmission, which is an instruction to remain indoors, not to use [[terms of endearment]], rhetorical discourse, or the English language and not to translate the message. Pontypool is declared to be under quarantine. Ken calls back again and gets his phone close enough to his attacker so that his murmurs of \"Help me\" in a baby-like voice are audible. A horde of people attack the radio station, and Grant, Sydney, and Laurel-Ann lock themselves inside. Meanwhile, Laurel-Ann begins repeating the word \"missing\" and imitates the sound of a tea kettle.\n\nDr. Mendez arrives at the radio station through a window and hides with Grant and Sydney in the soundproof booth. Ken calls in and, while on the air, succumbs to the virus. Laurel-Ann begins to slam her head against the sound booth's window and chews off her lower lip. Mendez hypothesizes that a virus has infected certain words in the English language; only certain words infect certain people who then find another infected person to kill themselves with. Sydney receives a call from her children, only to hear them becoming infected. Outside the booth, Laurel-Ann vomits a large amount of blood and falls down, dead. Mendez suspects this has happened since she failed to find a victim.\n\nThe horde then breaks into the radio station, attacking the sound booth. Sydney draws the mob outside with a looped recording of Grant's voice saying 'Sydney Briar is alive\". When he fears that he is about to succumb to the virus, Dr. Mendez begins to speak in Armenian upon realizing that the virus is exclusive to the English language, which prevents the virus from taking over. When the recording fails, the mob returns but Mendez lures them away, saving Sydney and Grant, who now lock themselves in the equipment room.\n\nWhile Grant tries to figure out how to reverse the symptom, Sydney begins to succumb to the word \"kill\". Grant convinces her that the word \"kill\" now means \"kiss\" and her symptoms subside. Hoping to stop the virus, the pair go on the air, spouting a series of self-contradicting and confusing phrases to help their infected listeners, ignoring warnings from the authorities who are trying to get them off the air. While an amplified voice from outside counts down from ten, Sydney joins Grant in the booth and they kiss. An explosion can be heard when the film cuts to black.\n\nOver the black, news reports of further outbreaks of the virus suggest that the quarantine failed, spread by the news itself and eventually reaching [[England]], the source of its targeted language. In a [[post-credits scene]], Sydney and Grant (now known as \"Lisa\" and \"Johnny Deadeyes\") survive the virus and continue speaking English by maintaining a system of improvisational roleplay as the screen shifts from black and white to color.\n\n===Alternative Ending (Radio Play)===\nWhilst the radio play version of the story changes a few features, such as the more visual elements being restyled for audio or removed all together; it also features an alternative ending. In this ending when Grant convinces Sydney that \"kill\" now means \"kiss\" she asks Grant to \"kiss\" her (in the film version she says \"kill\" leading to them kissing).\n\nSoon after when broadcasting his own obituaries of Laurel-Ann and Mendez (who Grant assumes will meet his demise eventually), he confirms the death of Sydney, implying that he \"kissed\" her at her request.\nGrant, now completely alone, realises that he has become infected through the word \"paper\". Resigned to his fate, he allows himself to be taken by the word, repeating it over and over again, before finally uttering one different word: \"trap\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as Grant Mazzy (Johnny Deadeyes)\n* Lisa Houle as Sydney Briar (Lisa)\n* [[Georgina Reilly]] as Laurel-Ann Drummond\n* [[Hrant Alianak]] as Dr. Mendez\n* [[Rick Roberts (actor)|Rick Roberts]] as Ken Loney\n* [[Boyd Banks]] as Jay (Osama)\n* [[Tony Burgess (author)|Tony Burgess]] as Tony (Lawrence)\n* Rachel Burns as Colin (Daud)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Pontypool'' is based on Tony Burgess' novel ''[[Pontypool Changes Everything]]''. Burgess adapted the material for the screen himself. According to McDonald, the writer hashed out a script in 48 hours. [[Orson Welles]]' infamous [[The War of the Worlds (radio)|radio broadcast of ''The War of the Worlds'']] inspired the approach that they decided to take.<ref name=\"STYD2\">{{cite web|title=McDonald Describes Pontypool\u2019s \"Infected|first=Ryan|last=Turek|date=August 26, 2008|website=ShockTillYouDrop.com|url=http://shocktillyoudrop.com/news/festivaloffearnews.php?id=7454|access-date=February 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316051142/http://shocktillyoudrop.com/news/festivaloffearnews.php?id=7454|archive-date=March 16, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It was simultaneously produced as a motion picture and a [[radio play]].<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/arts/2009/06/090617_pontypool_audio.shtml |title=Worldplay: Pontypool for World Drama |publisher=BBC World Service |date=June 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912142527/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/arts/2009/06/090617_pontypool_audio.shtml |archive-date=September 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nFilming took place in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], rather than in [[Pontypool, Ontario|Pontypool]] itself.\n\nAt ''Rue Morgue''{{'}}s 2008 Festival of Fear expo, director Bruce McDonald stressed the victims of the virus detailed in the film were not [[zombie]]s and called them \"conversationalists\". He described the stages of the disease:<blockquote>There are three stages to this virus. The first stage is you might begin to repeat a word. Something gets stuck. And usually it's words that are terms of endearment like sweetheart or honey. The second stage is your language becomes scrambled and you can't express yourself properly. The third stage you become so distraught at your condition that the only way out of the situation you feel, as an infected person, is to try and chew your way through the mouth of another person.<ref name=\"STYD\" /></blockquote>\n\nAccording to McDonald, the final scene of Grant and Sydney, now presented in a [[post-credits scene|kicker]], was originally placed before the credits. However, audiences in early screenings found the original ending to be too confusing, so the scene was moved behind the credits instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://twitchfilm.com/2009/03/from-pontypool-to-the-metaverse-in-90-minutes-a-conversation-with-bruce-mcd.html |title=From Pontypool to the Metaverse in 98 minutes: A Conversation with Bruce McDonald  |last1=Halfyard |first1=Kurt |date=6 March 2009 |publisher=[[Twitch Film]] |access-date=17 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]'' and ''ChiZine Publications'' held a special screening of ''Pontypool'' on 3 December 2009 at the Toronto Underground Cinema and following the screening, it featured a Q&A with Stephen McHattie, Lisa Houle, and Tony Burgess.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe film was released theatrically in Canada on March 6, 2009.
