It was directed by [[Ron Underwood]] and stars [[Bill Paxton]], [[Charlize Theron]], and creature suit actor John Alexander as the title character. In this version, the ape is much larger than in the original. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $50.6&nbsp;million in the United States against a production budget of $90&nbsp;million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nAs a child, Jill Young witnesses the death of her mother, [[Primatology|primatologist]] Ruth Young, and the mother of Joe, an infant [[mountain gorilla]], at the hands of [[poachers]] led by Andrei Strasser, who loses his right thumb and trigger finger to Joe, swearing revenge.\n\nTwelve years later, Jill has raised Joe, now grown to a height of {{convert|15|ft|m}} tall and weighing {{convert|2000|lb|kg}}. As a result, other gorillas will not accept him and they are both now living in relative peace until a wildlife refuge director, Gregg O'Hara, convinces Jill that they would be safer from poachers if they relocated to the United States.\n\nThe trio goes to [[Los Angeles]] and win the hearts of the refuge staff at the [[conservancy]], who put Jill in charge of Joe. Jill meets Strasser, who now runs a fraudulent animal preserve in [[Botswana]], while secretly selling animal organs on the black market, and is eager for revenge after seeing Joe featured on a news report. At first, Jill does not recognize him, since his right hand is concealed in his coat pocket. Strasser attempts to convince Jill that Joe would be better off in his wildlife refuge back in Africa. During a gala, Strasser's henchman Garth uses a poacher's [[noisemaker]] to scare Joe into a frenzy. Joe trashes the gala, with the intention of attacking Strasser, but is captured, and imprisoned in a concrete bunker.\n\nWhen Jill discovers that Joe may be euthanized, she accepts Strasser's offer. She and the refuge staff smuggle Joe out in a truck. Before their departure, Gregg, who has fallen in love with Jill, kisses her goodbye. Shortly after Jill leaves, the maintenance workers come in with the poacher's noisemaker that they found while cleaning up the gala, making Gregg realize Jill and Joe are in danger and he drives after them.\n\nOn the way to the airport, Jill notices the half-glove covering Strasser's missing fingers and recognizes him. She fights Strasser and Garth, then jumps from the truck onto [[Hollywood Boulevard]], leading to several automobile accidents. Joe sees her and tilts the truck over onto its side and flees, rampaging through the Hollywood city and being chased by helicopters, before arriving at the [[Santa Monica Pier]] carnival.\n\nGregg finds Jill, who tells him of Strasser's intentions and her history with him. They track Joe to the carnival where he is playfully wreaking havoc. Strasser, determined to prevent Jill from exposing him, arrives and attempts to shoot her. But Garth, appalled at Strasser's ruthlessness, turns against him and shoves the gun away from Jill, causing Strasser to misfire at a spotlight, which starts a fire that quickly spreads throughout the carnival. After knocking Garth unconscious, Strasser attempts to kill Jill in person, but Joe sneaks up behind them and throws the evil poacher onto a nearby power line.  Unable to grip the wire due to his missing fingers, Strasser falls onto a [[transformer]] below and is electrocuted to death, leaving only his prosthetic half-glove dangling from the cable.\n\nLater, Joe attempts to save a child, who he had earlier bonded with while en route to the conservancy, from atop the burning Ferris wheel, but the fire burns it down and Joe and the child fall to the ground, where Joe jumps off of the burning wheel, protecting the boy and knocking himself unconscious. Joe survives the fall and awakens, and Jill mentions that they need to raise money to open a reserve for him. The young boy named Jason donates some change to Jill after hearing this, prompting nearby civilians to contribute.\n\nJoe is returned to [[Uganda]] where Jill and Gregg open the \"Joe Young Reserve\". Finally free, Joe runs off into the jungle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Bill Paxton]] as Professor Gregory \"Gregg\" O'Hara, a [[zoology|zoologist]] who finds Joe in the wild and develops a relationship with Jill.\n*[[Charlize Theron]] as Jill Young, a young woman who is Joe's best friend and protecter after they were both orphaned by the same poacher.\n**[[Mika Boorem]] as Young Jill Young\n*John Alexander as Mighty Joe Young, a [[mountain gorilla]] who due to a rare form of gigantism is {{convert|15|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|2000|lb|kg}} and is the sacred guardian of the mountain.

To achieve those scenes, Alexander often acted on miniature sets surrounded by blue screen; visual-effects house DreamQuest Images then composited him into footage shot earlier. Joe as an infant was performed by [[Verne Troyer]]. For certain scenes, the filmmakers used three full-sized animatronics (one in quadruped, one sitting down, and one in a dead position) also created by Baker's crew. For the digital Joe, visual-effects houses DreamQuest Images and Industrial Light & Magic worked on different scenes, using the same model provided by Baker. Many of these performances were achieved by key-frame animation, but to portray the digital Joe running and jumping, motion-capture data from an infant [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] were used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Music==\nThe music for the film was composed and conducted by [[James Horner]].

After all the calculation behind \"Godzilla\" or \"Armageddon,\" it has a kind of innocence. It's not about a monster but about a very big, well-meaning gorilla that just wants to be left in peace.\" Despite giving the film positive reviews, he also pointed out that the romance scenes and villains were only average and by no means exceptional.<ref name=\"Mighty Joe Young Review (1998)\">{{cite web|title=Mighty Joe Young Review (1998)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mighty-joe-young-1998|publisher=Roger Ebert.com|access-date=February 8, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Common Sense Media]]'' gave the film 4 stars, finding that the \"environmentally-friendly\" film provides \"serious food for thought [and] plenty of comic relief\", as opposed to the 1949 [[RKO]] film.

Despite not being daring in style or story, ''Mighty Joe Young'' is nevertheless a charming and enjoyable adventure, and a rare remake that's better than the original.

McDonagh believed it would be too shallow for adult viewers and too serious for children, adding that \"Joe himself is an amazing creation, less personable, to be sure, than the original lovelorn King Kong, but a far more fully realized character than any of the flesh and blood humans by whom he's surrounded.\"<ref name=\"Mighty Joe Young Review\">{{cite web|title=Mighty Joe Young Review|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/mighty-joe-young/review/132908|publisher=TV Guide}}</ref> [[Paul Clinton]] of [[CNN]] gave it negative reviews, saying, \"Great scenery, cartoonish villains, huges leaps of suspended belief, and mouthwatering shots of Charlize Theron are in plentiful supply in ''Mighty Joe Young''.

If you're not familiar with L.A ... trust me ... couldn't happen.\" and \"The gorilla is pretty impressive and expressive, but overall it's much ado about -- not much.
