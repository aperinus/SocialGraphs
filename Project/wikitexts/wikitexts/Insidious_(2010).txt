It is the first installment in the [[Insidious (film series)|''Insidious'' franchise]], and the third in terms of the series' in-story chronology. The story centers on a couple whose son inexplicably enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for a variety of malevolent entities in an [[astral plane]].\n\n''Insidious'' had its world premiere on September 14, 2010, at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF) and received a [[Wide release|wide theatrical release]] on April 1, 2011, by [[FilmDistrict]]. The film is followed by a sequel, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2|Chapter 2]]'' (2013), and two prequels, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 3|Chapter 3]]'' (2015) and ''[[Insidious: The Last Key|The Last Key]]'' (2018).\n\n==Plot==\nMarried couple Josh and Renai Lambert, their sons Dalton and Foster, and infant daughter Cali, have recently moved in to a new home. One evening, Dalton sneaks away to explore the attic, when he encounters a frightening entity and falls from a step stool. The next day, he inexplicably slips into a [[coma]].\n\nAfter three months of treatment without result, Renai and Josh take Dalton home. The family starts to experience disturbing paranormal events. Renai begins hearing voices over the [[baby monitor]] when no one is in Cali's room, Foster says that Dalton walks around at night. They hear things at the door, so they lock it and set the alarm. Renai sees a frightening figure in Cali's room, and the security alarm goes off. Josh has visions and works late. The nurse visits to check on Dalton. Renai finds a bloody hand print on Dalton's bed. Josh returns home and has more visions. After Renai is attacked by the figure, the Lamberts decide to move, believing the house to be haunted.\n\nIn the new house, however, the supernatural activity continues. Renai sees a dancing young boy dressed in period clothing, then follows the child's laugh to a moving rocking horse. In Dalton's room, the boy torments Renai. Josh's mother Lorraine arrives and explains her scary dream: visions of the house and demon. She is then terrified when she sees a red-faced [[demon]] behind Josh. She calls [[psychic]] Elise Rainier and her [[paranormal investigator]]s Specs and Tucker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/insidious-4-lin-shaye-interview/|title = Insidious: Lin Shaye Talks the Last Key and Elise's Journey| website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date = 4 January 2018}}</ref> One of the investigators sees a vision of a woman while investigating. In Dalton's room, Elise sees the same red-faced demonic figure that Lorraine saw. She describes it to the other investigators who do not see it.\n\nElise explains that Dalton is not in a coma; he was born with the ability to [[astral travel]] and had been unknowingly doing so in his sleep, probably believing he was dreaming. This time he has travelled too far and has been captured in a purgatory realm called \"The Further\", a place inhabited by the tortured souls of the dead. Without his mental presence, his body is comatose, but spirits desire to use it so they can re-enter the physical world, some because they want to live again, some because they want to hurt others. Josh makes Elise leave.\n\nJosh sees the drawings of Dalton in his room, and they confirm the truth: Dalton has been dreaming and astral traveling. Josh cries.\n\nElise returns and performs a s\u00e9ance to communicate with Dalton. He warns them of the man with fire on his face. Elise screams and seems to faint. The demon possesses Dalton's body and attacks the group before being stopped by Elise. She explains that she's known Lorraine for decades, and had previously helped Josh when he was eight years old. It is revealed that Josh also possesses the ability to astral project, though he [[Memory inhibition|had suppressed his memory]] of it years ago. These were the visions they had seen throughout the movie. Elise had helped him protect himself from the parasitic spirit of an evil old woman that wanted to [[demonic possession|possess]] him. We see images of the woman moving slowly to him. The only way to rescue Dalton is for Josh to go into The Further and save him.\n\nElise puts Josh in a trance and he is able to project to their previous house. He fights off one spirit that has been tormenting them and enters the Demon's lair through a red door where he finds Dalton chained. He frees him, but they are chased and attacked by the demon while the spirits of the Further invade the real world and terrorize Renai, Elise, and the others. After escaping, Josh confronts the old woman that haunted him as a child, trying once and for all to overcome his fears. The old woman laughs and appears to retreat from him. When Josh and Dalton return to their bodies, the spirits have all disappeared from their home.\n\nThe family celebrates their victory, but Elise senses that something is amiss about Josh.  When she snaps a photo of him, Josh becomes enraged and strangles her to death. Renai is horrified when she discovers Elise's dead body and even more so when she sees the photo Elise took. The photo reveals that Josh is now the evil woman from his childhood; she possessed him when he confronted her in the Further.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Josh Lambert\n** Josh Feldman as young Josh\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as Renai Lambert\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Elise Rainier\n* [[Ty Simpkins]] as Dalton Lambert\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Lorraine Lambert\n* Brynn Bowie and Madison Bowie as Kali Lambert\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Steven \"Specs\"\n* [[Angus Sampson]] as Tucker\n* Andrew Astor as Foster Lambert\n* Heather Tocquigny as Nurse Kelly\n* Corbett Tuck as Nurse Adele\n* Ruben Pla as Dr. Sercarz\n* John Henry Binder as Father Martin\n* Christopher Marr Besina as Ghost\n* Marfren Cubar as Tree\n* [[Joseph Bishara]] as Lipstick-Face Demon\n* [[J.
