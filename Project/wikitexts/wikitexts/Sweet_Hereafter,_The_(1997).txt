It tells the story of a [[school bus]] accident in a small town that kills 14 children. A [[class action|class-action]] lawsuit ensues, proving divisive in the community and becoming tied with personal and family issues. It stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Ian Holm]], [[Sarah Polley]], [[Maury Chaykin]], [[Bruce Greenwood]], [[Tom McCamus]], [[Gabrielle Rose (actress)|Gabrielle Rose]], [[Arsin\u00e9e Khanjian]] and [[Alberta Watson]].\n\nThe film, inspired by the 1989 [[Alton, Texas bus crash|Alton, Texas, bus crash]], was filmed in [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]], incorporating a [[film score]] with [[medieval music]] influences and references to the story of the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]]. \n\nAlthough ''The Sweet Hereafter'' was not a box office success, it was critically acclaimed and won three awards, including the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]], at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]], along with seven [[18th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]]. It also received two [[70th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. [[Toronto International Film Festival]] critics named ''The Sweet Hereafter'' one of the [[Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time|top 10 Canadian films of all time]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the small town of Sam Dent, British Columbia, a school bus hits a patch of ice, runs through a barrier and crashes into a lake, killing 14 children. The grieving parents are approached by an out-of-town lawyer, Mitchell Stephens, who is haunted by his dysfunctional relationship with his drug-addicted daughter. Stephens persuades the reluctant parents and bus driver Dolores Driscoll to file a [[class action|class-action]] lawsuit against the town and bus company for damages, arguing that the accident is a result of negligence in constructing the barrier or the bus.\n\nThe case depends on coaching the few surviving witnesses to say the right things in court, particularly Nicole Burnell, a 15-year-old paralyzed from the waist down as a result of the accident. Before the accident, Nicole was an aspiring musician and was being sexually abused by her father, Sam.\n\nOne bereft parent, Billy Ansel, distrusts Stephens and pressures Sam to drop the case; Nicole overhears their argument. In the pretrial [[deposition (law)|deposition]], Nicole unexpectedly accuses the bus driver Dolores of speeding, halting the lawsuit. Stephens and Sam know she is lying but can do nothing. Two years later, Stephens sees Dolores working as a bus driver in a city.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Ian Holm]] as Mitchell Stephens\n** James D.
