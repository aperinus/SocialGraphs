The film stars [[Tom Hardy]] in the title role, the only character seen on screen, as he carries on a number of speakerphone conversations with characters voiced by [[Olivia Colman]], [[Ruth Wilson]], [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]], [[Ben Daniels]], [[Tom Holland]] and [[Bill Milner]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[70th Venice Film Festival]] on 2 September 2013. The film had a limited release in the United Kingdom beginning on 18 April 2014, and grossed $5 million worldwide. ''Locke'' received critical acclaim, particularly for Hardy's performance, which won him the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe evening before he must supervise a large [[concrete]] pour in [[Birmingham]] (the largest non-nuclear facility, non-military concrete pour in European history), construction foreman Ivan Locke learns that Bethan, a colleague from a job in [[Croydon]] with whom he had a [[one-night stand]] seven months before (which resulted in her becoming pregnant), has gone into premature labour. Despite his job responsibilities and although his wife and sons are eagerly awaiting his arrival home to watch an important football match, Locke decides to drive to [[London]] to be with Bethan during childbirth. Locke never forgave his father for abandoning him as a child, and he is determined not to make the same mistake, even though he has no relationship with, nor any particular feelings for, Bethan.\n\nOver the course of the one and a half-hour drive from Birmingham to London, Locke holds a total of 36 phone calls with: his boss Gareth; his backup colleague Donal; Katrina, wife of 15 years, to confess his infidelity; his sons, Eddie and Sean, who call him separately with updates on the match and (eventually) the worrisome breakdown of their mother; St Mary's maternity unit medical personnel, Sister Margaret then Halil Gullu, who are working with Bethan through some troubling complications; the [[County council#England|council head]], Cassidy, and local police authority, PC Davids, required for the road closures needed to allow the 225+ [[Concrete mixer#Trucks and trailers|concrete trucks]] to properly access the site; and with Bethan to reassure her during her labour. During these calls, he is fired from his job, banned from his house by his wife, and asked by his older son to please return home. He coaches his assistant Donal through preparing the pour despite some major setbacks, and has imaginary conversations with his dead father, whom he envisions (unseen onscreen) as a passenger in the car; he berates his father for abandoning Locke's family, and vows he will not repeat that mistake. When he is close to the hospital, Bethan calls to share the cooing of the baby, having had a successful birth.\n\n==Cast==\n===Starring===\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as Ivan Locke\n\n===Voices===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Olivia Colman]] as Bethan Maguire\n* [[Ruth Wilson]] as Katrina Locke\n* [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] as Donal\n* [[Ben Daniels]] as Gareth\n* [[Tom Holland]] as Eddie Locke\n* [[Bill Milner]] as Sean Locke\n* [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]] as Cassidy\n* [[Alice Lowe]] as Sister Margaret\n* [[Silas Carson]] as Halil Gullu\n* [[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]] as PC Davids\n* [[Kirsty Dillon]] as Gareth's wife\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAlmost the entire film takes place within a [[BMW X5]], which was pulled down the [[M6 motorway]] on a low flatbed trailer for most of the shoot.

It's a daring experiment brilliantly executed, with Tom Hardy giving one of the best performances of his career\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Olly|last=Richards|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=138485|title=Locke|work=Empire|access-date=26 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''How to Watch a Movie'' (2015), [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] singles out this film and says: \"No film I've seen in recent years is more eloquent on where we are now, and on how alone we feel. There is little left but to watch and listen.\"\n\nFor his performance, Hardy won the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Award]] from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|2692904}}\n* {{allmovie|582231|Locke}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|locke}}\n\n{{Steven Knight}}\n\n[[Category:2013 films]]\n[[Category:2010s drama road movies]]\n[[Category:A24 (company) films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:American drama road movies]]\n[[Category:British drama road movies]]\n[[Category:British pregnancy films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about mobile phones]]\n[[Category:Films set in Birmingham, West Midlands]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:IM Global films]]\n[[Category:American pregnancy films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Steven Knight]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Steven Knight]]\n[[Category:2013 drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s pregnancy films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]\n[[Category:2010s British films]]"}]}}}}
