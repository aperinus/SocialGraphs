The screenplay by [[John L. Balderston]] was adapted from a treatise written by [[Nina Wilcox Putnam]] and [[Richard Schayer]]. Released by [[Universal Studios]] as a part of the [[Universal Classic Monsters]] franchise, the film stars [[Boris Karloff]], [[Zita Johann]], [[David Manners]], [[Edward Van Sloan]] and [[Arthur Byron]].\n\nIn the film, Karloff stars as Imhotep, an ancient Egyptian [[Mummy (monster)|mummy]] who was killed for attempting to resurrect his dead lover, Ankh-esen-amun. After being discovered and accidentally brought to life by a team of archaeologists, he disguises himself as a modern Egyptian named Ardeth Bey and searches for Ankh-esen-amun, who he believes to have been reincarnated in the modern world.\n\nWhilst being less culturally impactful than its predecessors ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''The Mummy'' was still a moderate success, spawning [[The Mummy (franchise)|several sequels, spin-offs, remakes, and reimaginings]]. \n==Plot==\nIn 1921, an [[archaeology|archaeological]] expedition led by Sir Joseph Whemple finds the mummy of an [[ancient Egypt]]ian high priest named [[Imhotep (The Mummy)|Imhotep]]. An inspection of the mummy by Whemple's friend Dr. Muller reveals that the mummy's [[viscera]] were not removed, and from the signs of struggling Muller deduces that although Imhotep had been wrapped like a traditional mummy, he had been buried alive. Also buried with Imhotep is a casket with a [[Curse of the pharaohs|curse]] on it. Despite Muller's warning, Sir Joseph's assistant Ralph Norton opens it and finds an ancient life-giving [[Book of the Dead|scroll]], the \"Scroll of [[Thoth]]\". He translates the symbols and then reads the words aloud, causing Imhotep to rise from the dead. This snaps Norton's mind, and he laughs hysterically as Imhotep shuffles off with the scroll. Norton later dies, still laughing, in a straitjacket.\n\nTen years later, Imhotep has assimilated into modern society, taking the identity of an eccentric Egyptian historian named Ardeth Bey. He calls upon Sir Joseph's son Frank and Professor Pearson and shows them where to dig to find the tomb of the princess Ankh-esen-amun. After locating the tomb, the archaeologists present its treasures to the [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo Museum]], after which Bey disappears.\n\nBey soon encounters Helen Grosvenor, a half-Egyptian woman bearing a striking resemblance to the princess, who stays with Muller. Bey falls in love with her but so does Frank. After it is discovered that Bey is the mummy Imhotep, Muller urges Joseph to burn the Scroll of Thoth, but when Joseph tries to do so, Bey uses his magical powers to kill him and then hypnotizes a Nubian to be his slave and bring the Scroll to him. After the servant does so, he hypnotizes Helen to come to his place and there, reveals to her that his horrific death was punishment for [[sacrilege]], as he attempted to resurrect his forbidden lover, Princess Ankh-esen-amun.\n\nBelieving her to be the princess's [[reincarnation]], he attempts to make her his immortal bride by killing, mummifying, and resurrecting her. Frank and Muller come to her rescue but are immobilized by Bey's magical powers. However Helen is saved when she remembers her ancestral past life and prays to the goddess [[Isis (goddess)|Isis]] to come to her aid. The statue of Isis raises its arm and emits a flash that sets the Scroll of Thoth on fire. This breaks the spell that had given Imhotep his immortality, causing him to crumble to dust. At the urging of Dr. Muller, Frank calls Helen back to the world of the living while the Scroll continues to burn.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Boris Karloff The Mummy.jpg|right|thumb|Boris Karloff in a shot used throughout the film.]]\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as Ardeth Bey / [[Imhotep (The Mummy)|Imhotep]] / The Mummy (billed as '''KARLOFF''')\n* [[Zita Johann]] as Helen Grosvenor / Princess Ankh-esen-amun\n* [[David Manners]] as Frank Whemple\n* [[Arthur Byron]] as Sir Joseph Whemple\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]] as Dr. Muller\n* [[Bramwell Fletcher]] as Ralph Norton\n* [[Noble Johnson]] as The Nubian\n* Kathryn Byron as Frau Muller\n* [[Leonard Mudie]] as Professor Pearson\n* [[James Crane (actor)|James Crane]] as Pharaoh (misspelled as \"Pharoh\" in the credits) [[Amenhotep III|Amenophis]]\n* [[Henry Victor]] as The Saxon Warrior{{efn|Victor is listed in the credits but never appears in the film.

Thoth was the wisest of the Egyptian gods who, when Osiris died, helped Isis bring her love back from the dead.

The real [[Ankhesenamun]]'s body had not been discovered in the tomb of King Tut and her resting place was unknown. Her name, however, would not have been unknown to the general public.\n\nFilming began in September 1932 and was scheduled for three weeks.{{sfn|Robson|2012|page=12}} Karloff's first day was spent shooting the Mummy's awakening from his [[sarcophagus]].

Pierce began transforming Karloff at 11 a.m., applying [[cotton]], [[collodion]] and [[spirit gum]] to his face; [[clay]] to his hair; and wrapping him in [[linen]] bandages treated with acid and burnt in an oven, finishing the job at 7 p.m. Karloff finished his scenes at 2 a.m., and another two hours were spent removing the make-up. Karloff found the removal of gum from his face painful, and overall found the day \"the most trying ordeal I [had] ever endured\".<ref name=horror/> Although the images of Karloff wrapped in bandages are the most iconic taken from the film, Karloff appears on screen in this make-up only for the opening vignette; the rest of the film sees him wearing less elaborate make-up.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff: the expanded story of a haunting collaboration, with a complete filmography of their films together |last=Mank |first=Gregory W. |publisher=McFarland & Co., Publishers |year=2009 |isbn=9780786434800 |location=Jefferson, N.C. |pages=126\u2013128 |oclc=607553826}}</ref>\n\nA lengthy and detailed flashback sequence was longer than now exists.

In the first the mummy comes alive and a young archaeologist, going quite mad, laughs in a way that raises the hair on the scalp. In the second Im-Ho-Tep is embalmed alive, and that moment when the tape is drawn across the man's mouth and nose, leaving only his wild eyes staring out of the coffin, is one of decided horror. But most of ''The Mummy'' is costume melodrama for the children.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/01/07/archives/life-after-3700-years.html|title=Life After 3,700 Years|date=January 7, 1933|access-date=November 2, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe film was a success at the box-office in the United Kingdom <ref name=\"karloff\"/>\n\n[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an 88% score, based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10.

In one scene, Helen Grosvenor longs for the \"real\" ([[Ancient Egypt|Classical]]) Egypt, disparaging that she is in contemporary [[Islam in Egypt|Islamic Egypt]]. This is viewed by critic Caroline T. Schroeder as a slight against Islamic culture at the time.<ref>Schroeder, Carolyn T. ''Ancient Egyptian Religion on the Silver Screen: Modern Anxieties about Race, Ethnicity, and Religion''. University of Nebraska Omaha. Oct 2003. January 20, 2015.</ref> However, it is clear that Helen longs to be in Ancient Egypt (but does not know why) because she had been reincarnated, living in present day, but had originally lived in Ancient Egypt.\n\nAccording to Mark A. Hall, of the Perth Museum and Art Gallery, film portrayals of Egypt, especially in Egyptian archaeology, often deal with themes of appropriating and controlling the dangers of non-European cultures, or deal with the past if it relates to legend and superstition. Mummies, Hall says, are a common example of this. While he commended the archaeological wisdom espoused by Sir Joseph Whemple in the film, he writes that \"much more is learned from studying bits of broken pottery than from all the sensational finds\" and that archaeologists' job is to \"increase the sum of human knowledge of the past\", and mentions that the archaeological element was only used as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for the supernatural elements.<ref name=\"Hall, Mark A 2004\">Hall, Mark A. \"Romancing the stones: archaeology in popular cinema\". ''European Journal of Archaeology'' 7.2 (2004): p. 161.</ref> As a result, per Hall, what it and similar films offered was a \"depiction of archaeology as a colonial imposition by which cultural inheritance is appropriated\".<ref name=\"Hall, Mark A 2004\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Sequels===\n[[File:MummysTomb001Crop.png|thumb|286px|[[Lon Chaney Jr.]] appeared as [[Kharis|Kharis the Mummy]] in three follow-ups to the original film.]] \nUnlike other [[Universal Monsters]] films, ''The Mummy'' had no official sequels, but rather was reimagined in ''[[The Mummy's Hand]]'' (1940) and its sequels, ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1942), ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'' (1944), ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]'' (1944), and the studios' [[Comedy film|comedy]]\u2013[[Horror film|horror]] crossover film ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy]]'' (1955). These films focus on the titular character named [[Kharis]] (Klaris in the Abbott and Costello film). ''The Mummy's Hand'' recycled footage from the original film for use in the telling of Kharis' origins, where Karloff is clearly visible in several of these recycled scenes but was not credited. [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] played the Mummy in ''The Mummy's Tomb'', ''The Mummy's Ghost'', and ''The Mummy's Curse''.\n\n===Hammer Film Productions series===\nIn the late 1950s, British [[Hammer Film Productions]] took up the ''Mummy'' theme, beginning with ''[[The Mummy (1959 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1959), which, rather than being a [[remake]] of the 1932 Karloff film, is based on Universal's ''The Mummy's Hand'' (1940) and ''The Mummy's Tomb'' (1942). Hammer's follow-ups \u2014 ''[[The Curse of The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1964), ''[[The Mummy's Shroud]]'' (1966) and ''[[Blood from The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1971) \u2014 are unrelated to the first film or even to each other, apart from the appearance of ''The Scroll of Life'' in ''Curse of The Mummy's Tomb'' and ''Blood from The Mummy's Tomb''.\n\n===Remake series===\n{{Main|The Mummy (franchise) #Stephen Sommers series (1999\u20132008)}}\nThe much later Universal film ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1999) also suggests that it is a remake of the 1932 film, but has a different story line. In common with most postmodern remakes of classic horror and science-fiction films, it may be considered as such in that it is produced-distributed by the same studio, its titular character is again named Imhotep, resurrected by the Book of the Dead, and out to find the present-day embodiment of the soul of his beloved Anck-su-namun, and features an Egyptian named Ardeth Bay (in this case, a guard of the city and of Imhotep's tomb). This film spawned two sequels with ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'' (2008). ''The Mummy Returns'' also spawned a prequel spin-off of that sequel, ''[[The Scorpion King]]'' (2002), which in turn spawned a prequel, ''[[The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior]]'' (2008), and three sequels, ''[[The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption]]'' (2012), ''[[The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power]]'' (2015) and ''[[Scorpion King: Book of Souls]]'' (2018). Also, a short-lived animated series simply titled ''[[The Mummy (TV series)|The Mummy]]'' ran from 2001 to 2003.\n\n===Reboot===\nIn 2012, Universal announced a  reboot of the film, more in-line with the horror films, from the [[Universal Monsters]] film franchise.<ref>Kroll, Justin, Snieder, Jeff, [https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118052291 \"U sets 'Mummy' reboot with Spaihts\"], Variety.com, Published 2012-04-04, Retrieved May 4, 2012.</ref> The reboot was directed by [[Alex Kurtzman]].

[[Thoth]], the Egyptian god of knowledge, is said to be the inventor of hieroglyphs and the author of the ''Book of the Dead''. The film also makes reference to the Egyptian myth of the goddess [[Isis]] resurrecting [[Osiris]] after his murder by his brother [[Set (deity)|Set]].\n\nConspirators were caught in [[harem conspiracy|a plot]] to assassinate Pharaoh [[Ramesses III]] around 1151 B.C.E. [[Judicial Papyrus of Turin|Papyrus trial transcripts]] reveal that the conspirators were prescribed 'great punishments of death', and archaeological evidence led to the suggestion that at least one of them may have been buried alive. Although such punishment was not common practice, this discovery probably influenced the film's screenplay.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the ancient Egyptians believed in or considered the possibility of reanimated mummies. Mummification was a sacred process meant to prepare a dead body to carry the soul through the afterlife, not for being reincarnated and living again on Earth. While it is possible that some individuals were mummified by being buried alive, it is unlikely that ancient Egyptians would think resurrection was possible because they were very aware of the fact that all the necessary organs had been removed and the body would be of little use on Earth anymore.<ref name=\"ejas.revues.org\"/> Egyptologist [[Stuart Tyson Smith]] notes that 'the idea of mobile mummies was not entirely alien to ancient Egypt', citing [[Khaemweset#Khaemweset in Ancient Egyptian fiction|one of the Hellenistic-era stories of Setna Khaemwas]], which features both the animated mummy of Naneferkaptah and a fictional ''[[Book of Thoth]]'' and may have inspired screenwriter John Balderston.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Cite journal |last=Telotte |first=J.
