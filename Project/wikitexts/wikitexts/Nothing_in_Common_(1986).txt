It stars [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Jackie Gleason]] in what would be Gleason's final film role; he was suffering from cancer during the production and died less than a year after the film's release.\n\nWhile the film did make back over 2.5 times its budget, it was not considered a big financial success on initial release, though it became more popular as Hanks' fame grew. It is considered by some to be a pivotal role in Hanks' career because it marked his transition from less developed comedic roles to leads in more serious stories, and many critics also praised Gleason's performance.\n\n==Plot==\nDavid Basner, a shallow, self-serving [[yuppie]] recently promoted at his Chicago ad agency, returns to work from a vacation. His parents have separated after 36 years of marriage and he must care for his aging, bitter father, Max, and support his emotionally fragile mother, Lorraine. His father has just been fired after 35 years in the garment industry.\n\nAlthough his ex-girlfriend, Donna, is sympathetic, she tells him he needs to \"grow up\". David fears that if he tried to be less child-like, his advertising work could be adversely affected. He is developing a commercial for Colonial Airlines, owned by the rich and bullish Andrew Woolridge. A successful ad campaign would likely gain David a partnership in his company. David develops a relationship with Woolridge's daughter, Cheryl Ann Wayne. His father is well aware of his playboy nature, and is critical of his frivolous lifestyle.\n\nHis parents each begin to rely more on David. His mother needs help moving to a new apartment. His father needs to be driven to an eye doctor. David is awakened late one night when his mother's date ends badly, and she reveals that Max humiliated her sexually and was unfaithful. Confronting his father, he tells him, \"Tomorrow I'm shooting a commercial about a family who loves each other, who cares about each other. I'm fakin' it.\" David becomes distracted and his deteriorating relationship with Max affects his work. As a peace offering, David takes him to a nightclub to hear some of his favorite jazz music. He discovers that Max is severely diabetic but hasn't been following his diet.\n\nMax's toes require amputation. He and Lorraine discuss their life together, and she condemns him for his abuse. Privately, Max is overwhelmed by regret.\n\nWoolridge insists that David accompany him to New York to promote the new ad campaign, which would prevent him from being present for Max's surgery. David refuses and loses the account. His boss Charlie is sympathetic and assures him he will intercede with Woolridge, giving David time to be with his father.\n\nDavid brings Max home from the hospital, who tells him, \"You were the last person I thought would ever come through for me.\" When David returns to his job, he tries to show Max how important his work is.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as David Basner\n* [[Jackie Gleason]] as Max Basner\n* [[Eva Marie Saint]] as Lorraine Basner\n* [[Hector Elizondo]] as Charlie Gargas\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as Andrew Woolridge\n* [[Sela Ward]] as Cheryl Ann Wayne\n* [[Bess Armstrong]] as Donna Mildred Martin\n* [[Dan McGuire]] as The Caddie\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.
