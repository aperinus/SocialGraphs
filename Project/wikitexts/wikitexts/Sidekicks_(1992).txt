A loner, Barry has vivid [[daydream]]s about being [[Chuck Norris]]' sidekick, battling against Norris' movie enemies, who are often personified by Barry's everyday bullies such as Randy Cellini (John Buchanan). Noreen Chan ([[Julia Nickson-Soul]]), his favorite teacher, often plays the damsel in distress in these daydreams.\n\nBarry wants to learn martial arts, but is rejected by the arrogant dojo owner Kelly Stone ([[Joe Piscopo]]) for being too weak. Instead, he is taken on as a student by an old Chinese man called Mr. Lee ([[Makoto Iwamatsu|Mako]]), Noreen's sly uncle and the owner of a local Chinese restaurant, \"Frying Dragon\". Mr. Lee finds creative ways to teach Barry to defend himself from his bullies. Lee devises training methods that increase Barry's endurance, which helps his asthma. Lee also deduces Barry's hero worship of Norris, and from that at least some of Barry's daydreams. He creatively incorporates this into Barry's training, devising training scenarios that seem more dangerous than they are so that Barry will feel heroic for succeeding at them.\n\nLee enters himself, Barry, and Chan into a local team Karate tournament but is a bit stymied to learn that a team must have four members. Norris is attending the tournament as a guest and, at Lee's urging, Chan convinces Norris to join the team. Norris is both willing to help an ardent fan and has his own motivation for participating: he has encountered Stone on several occasions and wants to teach him \"a lesson in humility\". Barry is stunned to find himself working together with his hero.\n\nThe tournament involves four events: [[Breaking (martial arts)|Breaking]], Men's Weapons, Female Kata, and Freestyle fighting. Stone's team narrowly defeats Chan in the Female Kata, but Lee defeats Cellini, one of Stone's students, in Breaking. True to his word, Norris defeats Stone in Freestyle fighting, and Barry\u2014aided by a vivid daydream\u2014scores a victory in Men's Weapons. The result is a tie between Stone's team and Lee's team. In the tie-breaker, Lee is allowed to choose the participants, and chooses Barry and Cellini, saying Barry is the member of the team with \"something to prove\". Stone chooses the event, Breaking. Barry is dismayed to be confronting Cellini in the latter's best event, but Lee tilts the odds in Barry's favor by using a small amount of lighter fluid to set Barry's bricks on fire. Faced with a much more heroic-seeming task, Barry wins.\n\nAfter the tournament, Barry is seen talking to Norris, thanking him for his help. Norris vanishes, and it is implied that Barry has found the strength to live his life without the need for his daydreams. A young boy in a wheelchair finds Barry's Chuck Norris magazine and reacts with an excited \"Wow!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jonathan Brandis]] as Barry Gabrewski\n* [[Chuck Norris]] as Himself\n* [[Beau Bridges]] as Jerry Gabrewski\n* [[Makoto Iwamatsu|Mako]] as Mr. Lee\n* [[Joe Piscopo]] as Kelly Stone\n* [[Danica McKellar]] as Lauren\n* John Buchanan as Randy Cellini\n* [[Richard Moll]] as Mr. Horn\n* [[Julia Nickson-Soul]] as Ms. Noreen Chan\n* [[Gerrit Graham]] as Mr. Mapes\n* [[Eric Norris]] as Biker Punk\n{{div col end}}\nNOTE: Nickson-Soul's character-name is an inside reference to Chuck Norris's movie ''[[An Eye for an Eye (1981 film)|An Eye For an Eye]]'', in which Mako portrayed James Chan (the father of a murdered journalist, who teams up with Norris' character to hunt down her killers).\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\n* 810 Zola Rd., Houston, Texas.
