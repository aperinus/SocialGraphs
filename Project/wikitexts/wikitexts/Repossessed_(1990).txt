It was written and directed by [[Bob Logan (film director)|Bob Logan]]. The film features the original star of ''The Exorcist'', [[Linda Blair]], as well as [[Leslie Nielsen]] and [[Anthony Starke]]. Many gags parodied events in ''The Exorcist'', such as the green-vomit and head-spinning scenes, and real-life events such as the [[televangelism|televangelist]] scandals of the 1980s\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1973, Father Jebediah Mayii casts out the [[devil]] from the body of young Nancy Aglet. In 1990, Nancy's body is [[demonic possession|possessed]] once again, while watching ''The Ernest and Fanny Miracle Hour'', a [[prosperity gospel]] broadcast by two hucksters.\n\nAfter a visit to the hospital, and a visit from Father Luke Brophy, Brophy concludes that Nancy is indeed possessed. Mayii, however, refuses to perform the [[exorcism]], claiming he is too weak, and that both he and Nancy barely survived her previous exorcism. Brophy visits the Supreme Council for Exorcism Granting. Ernest and Fanny of ''The Ernest and Fanny Miracle Hour'' are also present. Ernest concludes that an exorcism is warranted, and convinces the council to televise Nancy's exorcism. They agree, believing it will convert millions, so Ernest presents ''Ernest and Fanny's Exorcism Tonight'' to the network.\n\nFeeling he may be needed, Mayii visits \"Bods-R-Us\", a gymnasium, to restore his physical strength. There, Brophy approaches him, informs him of the televised exorcism, and attempts once more to convince Mayii to conduct the exorcism. He refuses again.\n\nAfter a montage of attempts to free Nancy's body using phone donations, song, and insults, ''Ernest and Fanny's Exorcism Tonight'' is announced as having the largest audience in history. Upon hearing this, the devil, in Nancy's body, sets the studio on fire, causing the audience to flee. He reveals to Ernest and Fanny that he used them to get the largest audience, and turns them into a [[pantomime horse]].\n\nUsing the camera, the devil tries to claim the souls of the viewing audience, but is stopped by Brophy, who destroys the camera. The devil announces he knows another way to claim their souls, and runs away, heading for a satellite transmitter. He is pursued by religious figures from around the world, who have gathered at Brophy's command. Brophy teases the devil about his defeat by Mayii.\n\nBack in the studio, the devil uses the camera to lure Mayii to him for a rematch. The exorcism, with commentary by \"Mean Gene\" Okerlund and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura, is ineffective until the devil mentions that he hates [[rock 'n roll]]. Turning the TV studio into a live concert, the song \"[[Devil with a Blue Dress On]]\" is played to the devil by the various religious figures, including [[The Pope]] on guitars. The devil is tormented so that he is finally driven from Nancy's body.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Linda Blair]] as Nancy Aglet\n*[[Ned Beatty]] as Ernest Weller  \n*[[Leslie Nielsen]] as Father Jebedaiah Mayii  \n*[[Anthony Starke]] as Father Luke Brophy  \n*Lana Schwab as Fanny Ray Weller\n*Thom J.

The film was re-released on DVD on April 14, 2009 by [[Lionsgate|Lions Gate Entertainment]], in a collection of forgotten films called the \"Lost Collection\".  The corporation again released the film on DVD on January 4, 2011, in a \"4-Film Collection\" set along with ''[[My Best Friend Is a Vampire]]'', ''[[Slaughter High]]'' and ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night 3: Better Watch Out!]]''\n\n==Reception==\nOne review came from Mick Martin and Marsha Porter's ''DVD and Video Guide'', where they called it an \"uproarious parody\" and praising Nielsen's performance.<ref>Martin, Mick and Porter, Marsha (2003), p. 915.
