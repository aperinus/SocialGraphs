It is both a [[prequel]] and [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of [[The Mummy (franchise)|''The Mummy'' franchise]] and launched [[The Scorpion King (film series)|''The Scorpion King'' film series]]. The film marks Johnson's first lead role. It received mixed reviews and grossed $180 million worldwide against the production budget of $60 million.\n\nThe events of ''The Scorpion King'' take place 5,000 years before the events of ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' and ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'', revealing the origins of [[List of characters in The Mummy series#Mathayus (Scorpion King)|Mathayus]] and his rise to power as the legendary hero, the Scorpion King. The name is a reference to a historical king of the [[Naqada III|Protodynastic Period of Egypt]], [[Scorpion II|King Scorpion]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- On an edit on April 24, 2021, the amount of words in this section was reduced from 829 to 556 words.

[[List of characters in The Mummy series#Mathayus (Scorpion King)|Mathayus]], his half-brother Jesup, and their friend Rama, the only three true remaining [[Akkad (city)|Akkadians]], are hired by King Pheron of the free tribes to kill Memnon's sorcerer for twenty blood rubies. The Akkadians sneak into Memnon's camp only to grapple with the guards due to having been warned by King Pheron's son, Takmet having pledged his allegiance to Memnon and killed his father as proof of his betrayal, leaving Rama killed by an arrow shot and Jesup executed. Mathayus, in the middle of this, finds Memnon's sorcerer, Cassandra, who predicts battle outcomes for Memnon and has been his prisoner since she was a child. At the end of the conflict, Memnon buries Mathayus in the desert to be devoured by fire ants at dawn. Mathayus escapes with help from a horse thief, Arpid, and desires to finish his mission and avenge his brother.\n\nMathayus sneaks into Memnon's stronghold, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Gomorrah]], and enters Memnon's palace with help from a [[street urchin]]. Memnon's sympathetic court magician, Philos, directs Mathayus to the courtyard where Memnon is training. Mathayus tries to shoot Memnon from the watchtower, but instead saves the street urchin from having his hand cut off by Takmet under suspicion of theft and barely escapes Gomorrah, abducting Cassandra along the way. Memnon sends his right-hand man, Thorak, and a group of guards to kill Mathayus and retrieve Cassandra. Mathayus slays them all under the cover of a sandstorm and in a cave, helped by Cassandra saving Mathayus from a poisonous arrow shot via her magic.\n\nMathayus, Arpid, and Cassandra run into Philos, who escaped Gomorrah and has perfected an explosive powder. However, they are ambushed by the rebels, now under the rule of the [[Nubians|Nubian King]] Balthazar. Though Mathayus defeats Balthazar in a fight and earns his grudging respect and sanctuary, Cassandra informs Mathayus that she has a vision of Memnon and his army slaughtering the entire rebel camp. Furthermore, she explains that if Mathayus faces Memnon, he will likely die.\n\nThe next morning, Cassandra returns to Memnon in order to stall and possibly kill him. Mathayus, with help from Balthazar, Arpid, Philos, and the army of rebels, launches an all-out assault on Memnon's stronghold, facing Memnon personally before he can kill Cassandra. Balthazar takes on the full force of Memnon's forces alone and kills Takmet during the battle, thus, avenging King Pheron. The battle continues until Mathayus is shot by a guard, as predicted by Cassandra. As Memnon is about to claim victory, Cassandra kills the guard while Mathayus retrieves his bow and shoots an arrow at the exhausted Memnon, sending him off the edge of the roof and into a set of flames where he dies. Philos and Arpid use the explosive powder to destroy the palace's foundation stone, bringing down Memnon's forces. With the battle over, the remnants of Memnon's army bow before Mathayus, who by their law is proclaimed the Scorpion King.\n\nIn the aftermath, Mathayus and Balthazar share a good-natured farewell as the latter returns to his own kingdom. Cassandra tells Mathayus that she sees a period of peace and prosperity coming, but warns him that it will [[The Mummy Returns|not last forever]]. Undeterred, Mathayus decides that they will make their own destiny.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as [[List of characters in The Mummy series#Mathayus (Scorpion King)|Mathayus of Akkad / The Scorpion King]]\n* [[Steven Brand]] as Memnon\n* [[Kelly Hu]] as Cassandra / Sorceress\n* [[Grant Heslov]] as Arpid\n* [[Bernard Hill]] as Philos\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as Balthazar\n* [[Peter Facinelli]] as Takmet\n* [[Ralf Moeller]] as Thorak\n* [[Branscombe Richmond]] as Jesup\n* [[Roger Rees]] as King Pheron\n* [[Sherri Howard]] as Queen Isis\n* [[Conrad Roberts]] as Chieftain\n* [[Joseph Ruskin]] as Tribal Leader\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Scorpion King\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{start date|df=yes|2002|3|26}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n* [[Nu metal]]\n* [[alternative metal]]\n| length     = 1:00:41\n| label      = [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]\n| producer   = Various artists\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = The Scorpion King\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[I Stand Alone (Godsmack song)|I Stand Alone]]\n | single1date = 18 May 2002\n}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"stone1\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r580844|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Scorpion King [Soundtrack]|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n}}\nThe soundtrack to ''The Scorpion King'' was released on 26 March 2002, just before the film was released on 19 April.
