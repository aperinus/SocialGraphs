It is written by [[Steven Zaillian]], who based his screenplay on [[Oliver Sacks]]'s 1973 memoir ''[[Awakenings (book)|Awakenings]]''. It tells the story of neurologist Dr. Malcolm Sayer ([[Robin Williams]]), who is based on Sacks, who discovers the beneficial effects of the drug [[L-Dopa]] in 1969. He administers it to catatonic patients who survived the [[Encephalitis lethargica epidemic of 1918\u20131930|1917\u20131928 epidemic]] of [[encephalitis lethargica]]. Leonard Lowe ([[Robert de Niro]]) and the rest of the patients are awakened after decades and have to deal with a new life in a new time. [[Julie Kavner]], [[Ruth Nelson (actress)|Ruth Nelson]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], [[Penelope Ann Miller]], [[Peter Stormare]], and [[Max von Sydow]] also star.\n\n''Awakenings'' was produced by [[Walter Parkes]] and [[Lawrence Lasker]], who first encountered Sacks's book as undergraduates at [[Yale University|Yale]] and optioned it a few years later. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning $108.7 million on a $29 million budget, and was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]] borough of [[New York City]]. After working extensively with the [[catatonia|catatonic]] patients who survived the 1917\u20131928 epidemic of [[encephalitis lethargica]], Sayer discovers certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states; actions such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, being called by their name, and enjoying human touch, all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Patient Leonard Lowe seems to remain removed, but Sayer learns that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a [[Ouija]] board.\n\nAfter attending a lecture at a conference on the drug L-Dopa and its success for patients with [[Parkinson's disease]], Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results: Leonard completely \"awakens\" from his catatonic state. This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L-Dopa medication and gain \"awakenings\" to reality and the present.\n\nMeanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula, the daughter of another hospital patient. Leonard begins to chafe at the restrictions placed upon him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases. He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration. Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated, a number of [[Levodopa-induced dyskinesia|facial and body tics are starting to manifest]], which Leonard has difficulty controlling.\n\nAlthough Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients, they soon learn that it is a temporary result. As the first to \"awaken\", Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of \"awakening\". Leonard's tics grow more and more prominent, and he starts to shuffle more as he walks. All of the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them. He soon begins to have full body spasms and can hardly move. Leonard puts up well with the pain, and asks Sayer to film him, in hopes that he would someday contribute to research that may eventually help others. Leonard acknowledges what is happening to him and has a last lunch with Paula, where he tells her he cannot see her anymore. When he is about to leave, Paula dances with him. For this short period of time, his spasms disappear. Leonard and Sayer reconcile their differences, but Leonard returns to his catatonic state soon after. The other patients' fears are similarly realized as each eventually returns to catatonia, no matter how much their L-Dopa dosages are increased.\n\nSayer tells a group of grant donors to the hospital that although the \"awakening\" did not last, another kind{{spnd}}one of learning to appreciate and live life{{spnd}}took place. For example, he overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello to go out for coffee, many months after he had declined a similar invitation from her. The nurses now treat the catatonic patients with more respect and care, and Paula is shown visiting Leonard. The film ends with Sayer standing over Leonard behind a Ouija board, with his hands on Leonard's hands, which are on the planchette. \"Let's begin,\" Sayer says.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Dr. Malcolm Sayer\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Leonard Lowe\n* [[Julie Kavner]] as Eleanor Costello\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Dr. Kaufman\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Paula\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Dr. Peter Ingham\n* [[Vincent Pastore]] as Ward #5 Patient #6\n* [[Ruth Nelson (actress)|Ruth Nelson]] as Mrs. Lowe\n* [[Alice Drummond]] as Lucy\n* [[Judith Malina]] as Rose\n* [[George Martin (American actor)|George Martin]] as Frank\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Miriam\n* [[Mary Alice]] as Nurse Margaret\n* [[Richard Libertini]] as Sidney\n* [[Keith Diamond (actor)|Keith Diamond]] as Anthony\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as unsympathetic neuro-chemist lecturer\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Dr. Tyler\n* [[Dexter Gordon]] as Rolando\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as Orderly (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nOn September 15, 1989, [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] reported that those being considered for the role of Leonard Lowe's mother were [[Kaye Ballard]], [[Shelley Winters]], and [[Anne Jackson]];<ref>Smith, Liz (September 15, 1989).
