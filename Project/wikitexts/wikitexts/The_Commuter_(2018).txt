The film stars [[Liam Neeson]], [[Vera Farmiga]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Jonathan Banks]], and [[Sam Neill]]. It follows a man who is unwittingly recruited into a murder conspiracy after meeting a mysterious woman while on his daily train commute.\n\nThe film premiered in [[New York City]] on January 8, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on January 12, 2018, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], and on January 19, 2018 in the United Kingdom by [[StudioCanal UK|StudioCanal]]; it had a select [[IMAX]] release. The film grossed $119 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who called it similar to Neeson and Collet-Serra's previous film, ''[[Non-Stop (film)|Non-Stop]]'', but praised Neeson's performance and the genre thrills.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Word count should be 400-700 per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] -->\nMichael MacCauley, a former [[NYPD]] officer turned [[insurance agent]], takes the same daily train commute on the [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] from [[Tarrytown station|Tarrytown]] to [[Grand Central Terminal]]. He is abruptly laid off from his job, endangering his family's financial security. Waiting to reveal his [[layoff|dismissal]] to his wife and son, he instead confides in Murphy, his ex-partner still on the police force. On the train home, Michael meets a mysterious married woman, Joanna, who proposes a \"hypothetical\" situation: she asks him to locate \"Prynne,\" the alias of an unknown passenger whom Joanna claims has a stolen item. Joanna tells Michael that he will find $25,000 in the bathroom and be paid a further $75,000 when his task is done. Alluding to Michael being a former cop, she departs, and he finds the $25,000.\n\nMichael attempts to leave the train with the money, but he is stopped by a young teenager with an envelope containing his wife's wedding ring, which she tells him is a warning. Unable to reach his wife by phone, he discreetly approaches fellow commuter Walt, writing a note on his newspaper to contact the police. Michael leaves Murphy a voicemail describing the situation and receives a call from Joanna threatening him and his family. She tells him the train is rigged with hidden cameras and to look outside, where he sees Walt pushed in front of a moving bus and killed. Joanna points Michael to a [[GPS]] tracker in his jacket to plant on Prynne.\n\nMichael leads a conductor to announce he plans to search a woman's bag. A man immediately leaves the car, and Michael follows, but the man attacks him, and Michael plants the tracker on him. Murphy calls back and explains that Prynne is a key witness in the supposed suicide of city official Enrique Mendez, leading Michael to realize that Prynne will be killed and that Michael is being set up. In a deserted carriage, Michael discovers the body of the man he planted the tracker on and a badge revealing he was an [[FBI]] agent. Joanna calls, chastising Michael for marking the wrong person and warning that another passenger reported his suspicious activities to police, who stop the train to investigate. Michael hides with the corpse underneath the carriage but loses the $25,000.\n\nSabotaging the train's air conditioning, he forces the remaining passengers into the last carriage and realizes another passenger, Oliver, killed the FBI agent. Oliver reveals that he received the same instructions for $100,000 but with orders to kill Prynne once Michael identified him. They fight, and Michael throws Oliver out of a window, thereby killing him. \"Prynne\" is revealed to be a 16-year-old girl named Sofia, who is holding incriminating information on powerful people; the agent was escorting her to [[witness protection]] at the train's final stop. Sofia reveals that Enrique, her cousin, was murdered by police officers.\n\nJoanna calls to force Michael to kill Sofia for the sake of his family, but he refuses, and Joanna detonates explosives to derail the train and kill everyone aboard. Michael saves the passengers by unhooking the final carriage at a curve in the tracks, but a conductor, Sam, is killed. Michael instructs the passengers to block the carriage windows with wet newspapers before a massive police force arrives. Assuming that Michael is holding the train hostage, authorities send Murphy to negotiate with him. Entering the carriage, Murphy unknowingly reveals himself as the rogue cop who killed Enrique, and he and Michael fight hand-to-hand. Michael removes Murphy's electronic ID tag, which identifies him as a \"friendly\" to the police snipers' [[thermal vision]], resulting in Murphy being mistaken for Michael and shot dead.\n\nSofia tells the FBI what she knows, and Michael is exonerated by the other passengers while the FBI rescues his family. His former captain admits that Murphy and other corrupt officers had been under investigation and offers Michael his job back. Michael reveals that he kept the incriminating hard drive Sofia gave him. Some time later, Joanna is on a train back from [[Chicago]] when Michael confronts her, showing her his detective's badge and preparing to arrest her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Michael MacCauley\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Joanna\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Det.
