Set in 1995, Fitzpatrick, Pierce, Sevigny, Dawson, and other newcomers portray a group of teenagers in New York City. They are characterized as [[Hedonism|hedonists]], who engage in sexual acts and substance abuse, throughout the course of a single day.\n\nBen Detrick of the ''New York Times'' has described the film as \"''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' with skateboards, nitrous oxide and hip-hop...

It received an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#NC-17|NC-17]] rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], but was released without a rating. Critical response was mixed, and the film grossed $20.4 million on a $1.5 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nA boy named Telly and a 12-year-old girl are kissing on a bed. With no adults around, Telly, who is 17, persuades the girl, who is a virgin, to have sex with him. Afterwards, he meets with his best friend, Casper, and they talk about his sexual experience. Telly vocalizes his desire to keep having sex with virginal girls. The pair then enters a local store, where Casper shoplifts a 40 oz. bottle of [[malt liquor]] as Telly distracts the cashier. Looking for drugs, food, and a place to hang out, they head to their friend Paul's apartment, despite expressing their dislike of him on the way there. Once they arrive at Paul's house, they join the other boys in boasting about their sexual prowess, as well as their nonchalant attitudes to both unprotected sex and venereal diseases. While doing so, the boys smoke marijuana while watching a skating video. Casper inhales [[nitrous oxide]] out of balloons, which Telly considers dangerous.\n\nAcross the city, a group of girls, among them Ruby and Jennie, are talking about sex. Their attitudes evidently contradict that of the boys on many topics, particularly oral sex and the significance of the individuals to whom they lost their virginities. Ruby and Jennie mention that they were recently tested for [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]] at Ruby's request, though Jennie only got tested to keep Ruby company. Ruby's test is negative, though she has had multiple sexual encounters, many of them unprotected intercourse.\n\nJennie tests positive for [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]]. She tells the nurse that she has had sex only once, with Telly. Distraught over her results, Jennie spends the rest of the day trying to find Telly, to prevent him from passing the virus on to another girl. Meanwhile, Telly and Casper walk to Telly's house and steal money from Telly's mother, who is preoccupied with taking care of her new baby.\n\nThey go to [[Washington Square Park]] and purchase a dime bag of marijuana from a [[Rastafari]]an. They then meet up with a few friends to talk and smoke, one of whom gives a [[Blunt (cannabis)|blunt]]-rolling tutorial. During the hangout, Casper and many others taunt a gay couple passing through the park. On the side, Telly briefly talks to Misha, a girl who strongly dislikes Casper and calls him a jerk.\n\nAs Casper rides on a skateboard, he carelessly bumps into a man, who angrily threatens and pushes Casper. The man is struck in the back of the head with a skateboard by Casper's friend Harold, causing him to collapse. A number of other skaters join in, beating, stomping, and hitting the man with their skateboards until he is rendered unconscious by a final blow to the head by Casper.\n\nWhile discussing whether or not they killed the man at the park, Telly and some of the group pick up a 13-year-old girl named Darcy\u2014 the virginal younger sister of an acquaintance\u2014 with whom Telly wants to have sex. He successfully convinces her to accompany them to a public pool. The other girls engage in kissing and flirtation, but Darcy shows restraint. Afterward, the group goes to an unsupervised party at the house of another friend, named Steven.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennie makes her way to Washington Square Park where she speaks to Misha, who tells her about Telly's possible whereabouts at [[The Shelter (New York City)|\"N.A.S.A.\"]]. When Jennie arrives at the club, she runs into Fidget, a raver boy, who shoves a pill into her mouth, which he says is supposed to make \"[[Ketamine|Special K]] look weak\". The drug turns out to be a [[depressant]]. Once its effects set in, Jennie discovers that Telly is at the party at Steven's house.\n\nJennie arrives at the party only to learn she is too late, as she discovers Telly having sex with Darcy, thus exposing her to HIV. Emotionally drained and still under the influence, Jennie cries and passes out on a couch among the other sleeping partygoers. A drunk Casper then rapes Jennie unprotected as she sleeps, exposing himself to HIV. Another teen at the party was able to witness the assault. As daylight approaches, a voice-over by Telly explains how sex is the only worthwhile thing in his life. The next morning, a naked and confused Casper wakes up and says \"Jesus Christ, what happened?\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Leo Fitzpatrick]] as Telly\n* [[Justin Pierce]] as Casper\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Jennie\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Ruby\n* Yakira Peguero as Darcy\n* Atabey Rodriguez as Misha\n* [[Jon Abrahams]] as Steven\n* [[Harold Hunter]] as Harold\n* Sajan Bhagat as Paul\n* Hamilton Harris as Hamilton\n{{div col end}}\n\nAdditionally, Sarah Henderson portrays the first girl Telly is seen having sex with and Tony Morales and Walter Youngblood portray the gay couple.

Summer 1995. \"[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/rascals.html The Little Rascals].\" Retrieved 2009-10-29.</ref> The film is shot in a quasi-documentary style, although all of its scenes are scripted.\n\nIn ''Kids'', Clark cast New York City \"street\" kids with no previous acting experience, notably Leo Fitzpatrick (Telly) and Justin Pierce (Casper). Clark originally decided he wanted to cast Fitzpatrick in a film after watching him skateboard in New York, and cursing when he could not land certain tricks. Korine had met Chlo\u00eb Sevigny in New York before production began on ''Kids'', and initially cast her in a small role as one of the girls in the swimming pool. She then was given the leading role of Jennie when the actress hired to play Jennie, [[Mia Kirshner]], was fired. Sevigny and Korine went on to make  ''[[Gummo]]'' (1997) and ''[[Julien Donkey-Boy]]'' (1999) together. Korine makes a cameo in the club scene with Jennie, as the kid wearing Coke-bottle glasses and a [[Nuclear Assault]] shirt who gives her drugs, though the part is credited to his brother Avi.\n\nKorine reportedly wrote the film's screenplay in 1993, at the age of 19, and principal photography took place during the summer of 1994. Contrary to the perception of many viewers, the film, according to Korine, was almost entirely scripted, with the only exception being the scene with Casper on the couch at the end, which was improvised.<ref>Lyons, Tom. 1997-10-16. \"[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/southern.html Southern Culture on the Skids]\".

[[Harvey Weinstein]] of [[Miramax]], wary of parent [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s opinion of the risky screenplay, declined to involve Disney in funding the production of the film.
