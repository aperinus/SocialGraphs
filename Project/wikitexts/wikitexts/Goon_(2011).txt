The film concerns the exceedingly nice but somewhat dimwitted Doug Glatt (Scott), who unexpectedly finds personal and professional fulfillment after becoming the [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] for a minor league [[ice hockey]] team.\n\nDespite receiving largely positive reviews, the film was a [[box office bomb]], only earning $7 million against its $12 million budget. After premiering on [[Netflix]] it became an unexpected success, leading to an increase in [[DVD]] sales and [[Video on demand|VOD]] downloads, ultimately resulting in a sequel being [[greenlit]].<ref>[https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1699280/could-goon-3-happen-heres-what-seann-william-scott-says Could Goon 3 Happen?]</ref>\n\nThe sequel, ''[[Goon: Last of the Enforcers]]'', was released on March 17, 2017, with Baruchel serving as director.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jay-baruchel-direct-goon-sequel-795932|title=Jay Baruchel to Direct 'Goon' Sequel (Exclusive)}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDoug Glatt ([[Seann William Scott]]), is a polite, kind-hearted, but [[dim-witted]] [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] at a bar in [[Massachusetts]]. Doug feels ostracized from society, especially since his father and brother are both successful [[physicians]]. Doug attends a [[minor league]] hockey game with his best friend Pat ([[Jay Baruchel]]). Pat taunts the visiting team during a [[fighting in ice hockey|fight]] and one of their players climbs into the stands, calling him a faggot. Doug, whose brother is [[gay]], steps in and easily beats up the opposing player. Soon after, Doug gets a phone call from the coach of his hometown team, who offers him a job as an [[enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]].\n\nMeanwhile, veteran enforcer and Doug's idol Ross \"The Boss\" Rhea ([[Liev Schreiber]]) is demoted to the minors after serving a 20-game suspension for slashing an opponent in the head from behind. Three years prior, Rhea hit and [[Concussion|concussed]] the highly skilled prospect Xavier Laflamme ([[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Grondin]]), who has had trouble recovering from the incident due to his fear of being hit again. As a result, Laflamme is still stuck in the minors, playing for the [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] Highlanders. As Doug's reputation grows, eventually earning the nickname \"Doug the Thug,\" the Highlanders' coach Ronnie hires Doug to protect Laflamme and be his roommate.\n\nThe Highlanders experience success with Doug as their enforcer, and he quickly becomes popular among fans and teammates, much to the chagrin of his parents and Laflamme, who loses ice time and the [[Alternate captain|alternate-captaincy]] to Doug. Meanwhile, Doug becomes romantically involved with Eva ([[Alison Pill]]), a hockey fan with a penchant for sleeping with players.\n\nWith four games left on their schedule, the Highlanders need two wins to secure a playoff spot. On a road game in [[Quebec]], after an opposing player concusses Laflamme with a heavy hit, Doug savagely beats the player unconscious and is suspended for the next game against Rhea and the [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] Shamrocks. Doug encounters Rhea at a [[diner]], where Rhea dismisses Doug's belief that he is a hockey player, insisting that they are both \"goons\". Though Rhea acknowledges Doug's physical prowess and gives Doug his respect, Rhea warns him that if they ever meet on the ice, he will \"lay him the fuck out.\" The Highlanders, with Doug suspended and Laflamme hospitalized, lose to the Shamrocks. The aging captain of the Highlanders, an inexperienced fighter, challenges Ross to a fight, Ross offering a chance to back out but the player denies it, and Ross easily defeats him.\n\nDoug reaches out to Laflamme and promises him he will always protect him on the ice; the incident touches Laflamme, who reconsiders his animosity towards Doug. In their next game, the Highlanders lead 1\u20130 thanks to strong teamwork between Doug and Laflamme. In the final seconds, Doug blocks a slapshot with his face and his ankle is injured in the ensuing scramble. The Highlanders win, but need a win against Rhea and the Shamrocks in their last game for a playoff spot.\n\nEva breaks up with her boyfriend to be with Doug, asserting that Doug is who she's really in love with. Doug later allows her now-ex-boyfriend to beat him up, believing that he deserves it for coming between them.\n\nAfter two periods, the Shamrocks are beating the Highlanders 2\u20130. Rhea and Doug mutually agree to fight in the third period. Although Rhea manages to knock him down when Doug re-breaks his recently injured ankle, Doug refuses to back down and eventually emerges victorious, knocking Rhea's tooth out. Ross smiles at seeing his tooth, satisfied that he lost to someone he considered a worthy opponent. Eva and his teammates help a seriously injured Doug off the ice and Laflamme, inspired by Rhea's defeat, scores a [[hat-trick#Variations|natural hat trick]], giving the Highlanders a 3\u20132 lead. As the game enters its final minute, Eva comforts Doug in the locker room as he comments, \"I think I nailed him.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Doug \"The Thug\" Glatt\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Ross \"The Boss\" Rhea\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Eva\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Pat\n* [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Grondin]] as Xavier Laflamme\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Dr. Glatt\n* [[David Paetkau]] as Ira Glatt\n* [[Kim Coates]] as Coach Ronnie Hortense\n* [[Richard Clarkin]] as Gord Ogilvey\n* [[Jonathan Cherry]] as Goalie Marco \"Belchie\" Belchior\n* Ricky Mabe as John Stevenson\n* [[Georges Laraque]] as Huntington\n* [[Curt Keilback]] as Rod McCaudry\n* Larry Woo as Park Kim\n}}\n\n==Production notes==\n[[File:Doug_Smith_today.jpg|thumb|upright|The film is an adaptation of the autobiography of [[Doug Smith (author)|Doug Smith]]]]\nThe film is an adaptation of the book ''Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey'' by Adam Frattasio and [[Doug Smith (author)|Doug Smith]].
