[[Dane Cook]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Brad Garrett]], [[Teri Hatcher]], Danny Mann, and [[Cedric the Entertainer]] reprised their roles of the voices of Dusty Crophopper, Skipper, Chug, Dottie, Sparky, and Leadbottom, respectively. New cast members included [[Hal Holbrook]], [[Julie Bowen]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Regina King]], [[Wes Studi]], [[Patrick Warburton]], and [[Dale Dye]]. In this film, Dusty Crophopper is assigned to become a [[wildfire suppression|wildland firefighting]] plane, after he learns that his engine's gearbox is damaged.\n\n''Planes: Fire & Rescue'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles on July 15, 2014 and was theatrically released on July 18, 2014 in [[Disney Digital 3D]], [[RealD Cinema|RealD 3D]] and [[D-Box Technologies|D-BOX]] formats. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with many calling it an improvement over its predecessor, and grossed $147 million worldwide on a $50 million budget.<ref name=\"bom\" />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nSince winning the Wings Around the Globe Rally, Dusty Crophopper had a successful career as a racer. Unfortunately, his engine's [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] becomes damaged because Dusty routinely operates the engine beyond its design limits. With that particular model of gearbox now out of production and none available anywhere, Dusty's mechanic Dottie fits a warning light to his control panel to ensure that he doesn't damage his gearbox any further.\n\nUnable to race and faced with the possibility of returning to his old job as a crop duster, Dusty goes on a defiant flight and tests his limits. In doing so, Dusty exceeds his limits and makes a forced landing at Propwash Junction airport, causing a fire. The residents put out the fire with some difficulty, but the accident leads government inspector Ryker to condemn the airport for inadequate firefighting personnel. Aggrieved at his actions, Dusty offers to undergo training to be certified as a firefighter to meet the necessary regulations to reopen the airport.\n\nThe next day, Dusty travels to Piston Peak National Park, where he meets a fire and rescue crew under the command of a helicopter named Blade Ranger. The leader of an efficient unit, Blade is initially unimpressed by the small newcomer and Dusty's training proves to be a difficult challenge.\n\nMaru, the team's mechanic, replaces Dusty's original undercarriage with two pontoons fitted with retractable undercarriage wheels for his new role as a [[Single Engine Air Tanker|single engine air tanker]] firefighter. During training, Dusty learns that Blade was formerly an actor who played a police helicopter on the TV series ''[[CHiPs|CHoPs]]''. Later, Dusty is devastated by a call from his friends at Propwash Junction, telling him that they've failed to find a replacement gearbox, meaning that his racing career is over. \n\nLightning in a thunderstorm over a forest near Piston Peak starts several spot fires which unite into a serious forest fire. The team fights it and seems to have extinguished it; but later, during the grand reopening of the park's lodge, visiting [[VIP]]s fly too low and create air eddies that blow embers about. This creates a larger fire, forcing the need to evacuate the lodge.\n\nA depressed Dusty's education in the midst of the large fire falters, much to Blade's frustration. Things come to a head when Dusty makes a forced landing in a river while trying to reload his tanks against orders and is swept through the rapids with Blade trying to extract him. Eventually, the pair make it to land, and Dusty confesses his physical disability. Blade advises Dusty not to give up. They shelter in an abandoned mine while the fire passes. The situation is complicated because Blade was gravely burned from protecting Dusty in the fire and is grounded for repairs. While Blade is recovering, Dusty learns from Maru that Blade's co-star Nick \"Loopin' \" Lopez from ''CHoPs'' was killed during a stunt gone wrong on set that Blade was helpless to stop. Afterwards, he decided to become a firefighter to save lives for real.\n\nWhen the wildfire threatens the lodge, the national park's superintendent Cad Spinner selfishly diverts the entire water supply to the roof sprinklers to prevent the lodge from burning. This prevents the firefighters from making [[fire retardant]] for their firefighting duties. With only their pre-existing tank loads, the firefighters manage to help the evacuees escape the fire.\n\nDusty is alerted that two elderly campers named Harvey and Winnie that he met earlier are trapped on a burning bridge deep in the fire zone. He races to the scene and pushes his engine to the maximum to climb vertically up a waterfall to refill his water tanks to drop water to save the campers, as the only other surface water nearby is the river in Augerin Canyon, too shallow, twisty, and rocky for him to scoop from. Simultaneously, Blade shows up and assists Harvey and Winnie by hooking up Winnie, preventing her from falling. Dusty successfully drops water and extinguishes the bridge fire, allowing the campers to escape just before the bridge collapses; but his gearbox blows out, his engine stalls, and he crashes.\n\nUnconscious, Dusty is airlifted back to base where he [[Coma|wakes up five days later]] to find that park ranger Jammer is now in charge of the park, to much delight. Maru tells him that not only has his structure been fully repaired but he has built a superior, custom-refurbished gearbox for his engine that allows Dusty full performance once again. Impressed at Dusty's skill and heroism, Blade certifies him as a firefighter. Propwash Junction is reopened with Dusty assuming his duty as a firefighter, celebrated with an aerial show with his new colleagues from Piston Peak.\n\nDuring the [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Cad has been demoted and reassigned to park ranger duty in [[Death Valley]] National Park.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|\n* [[Dane Cook]] as Dusty Crophopper.<ref name=\"CSD232013Press\">{{cite news|title=D23 Expo: New Art From the Upcoming Disney, Pixar and Disneytoon Movies|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/d23exponews.php?id=107609|access-date=August 10, 2013|newspaper=ComingSoon.net|date=August 9, 2013}}</ref> He was inspired by the [[Air Tractor AT-502]], [[Cessna]], and the [[PZL-Mielec M-18 Dromader]].<ref name=\"SKStills\">{{cite news|title=Disney's \"Planes\" Hi-res Stills, Fun Facts and Activity Sheets|url=http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-planes-stills-fun-facts-activity-sheets-62551/|access-date=May 11, 2013|newspaper=Stitch Kingdom|date=May 9, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630145040/http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-planes-stills-fun-facts-activity-sheets-62551/|archive-date=June 30, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Skipper Riley, a [[Chance-Vought F4U Corsair]] and Dusty's mentor.\n* Danny Mann as Sparky, a [[forklift truck|forklift]].\n* [[Julie Bowen]] as Lil' Dipper, a [[Super Scooper]]<ref name=\"CSD232013Press\" /> based on the [[Grumman G-21 Goose]] and [[Bombardier 415|CL-415 SuperScooper]]<ref name=NYCAviation>{{cite web|title=PREVIEW: Disney Planes Franchise to Launch High-Flying Sequel|url=http://www.nycaviation.com/2014/05/commentary-disney-planes-sequel-reaches-higher-orbit/|website=NYC Aviation|access-date=July 28, 2014|date=May 13, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as Chug, a fuel truck.\n* [[Teri Hatcher]] as Dottie, a forklift.\n* [[Curtis Armstrong]] as Maru, a forklift mechanic at the Piston Peak Air Attack base<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-planes-2-fire-rescue-trailer-69040/ | title = WATCH: 'Planes 2: Fire & Rescue' Full Length Trailer | access-date = February 6, 2014 | date = February 5, 2014 | publisher = Stitch Kingdom | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222205038/http://www.stitchkingdom.com/disney-planes-2-fire-rescue-trailer-69040/ | archive-date = February 22, 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref name=DIMeetChars />\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Blade Ranger, a veteran fire-and-rescue helicopter.

I wanted to look at a different genre, in this case, an action-disaster film.\" Production on ''Planes: Fire & Rescue'' began six months after the start of the previous film. \"We've been working on this film for nearly four years.\" The filmmakers researched the world of air-attack teams and smokejumpers by working with the [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection]], and sent a crew to the [[United States Forest Service|US Forest Services']] annual training exercises for smokejumpers.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=AOPA Pilot|title=Dusty flies again|first=Jim|last=Moore|page=26|date=September 2014}}</ref> Gannaway explained \"We actually hooked cameras onto their helmets and had them drop out of the airplane so we could catch it on film.\" Nearly a year of research was done before the filmmakers started work on the story. The idea of Dusty becoming a fire and rescue plane was based on reality. Gannaway stated that during their research they discovered that in 1955 cropdusters were among the first planes to be used in aerial fire-fighting, \"There was a group of cropdusters who reworked their planes so they could drop water.\" Gannaway also noted that in the first film \"Dusty is doing things to his engine that should not be done to it\u2014he is stressing the engine out and causing severe damage. It's great that the first movie [[Teeing ground|teed this up]] without intending to. We just built on it, and the results were remarkable.\" Producer Ferrell Barron stated \"I think we've all experienced some kind of loss at some point in our lives\u2014an end of an era, a lost love, a failed career. We've all had to recalibrate. In ''Planes: Fire & Rescue'', Dusty can't go back to being a crop duster, he left that behind.
