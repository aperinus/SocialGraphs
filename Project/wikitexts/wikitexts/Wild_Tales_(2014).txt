The film, which is a co-production between Argentina and Spain, is composed of six standalone shorts with a common theme of [[catharsis]], violence and vengeance. The film has an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[Ricardo Dar\u00edn]], [[Oscar Mart\u00ednez (actor)|Oscar Mart\u00ednez]], [[Leonardo Sbaraglia]], [[\u00c9rica Rivas]], [[Rita Cortese]], [[Julieta Zylberberg]], and [[Dar\u00edo Grandinetti]]. Because of Szifron's desire to work with Dar\u00edn and Mart\u00ednez, these actors were allowed to choose the role they wanted.\n\nFour of the film's stories were partly based on Szifron's real-life experiences and were all planned either as thrillers or dramas. ''Wild Tales'' was co-produced by three Argentine studios, and [[Agust\u00edn Almod\u00f3var|Agust\u00edn]]'s and [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]]'s Spanish company [[El Deseo]]. The brothers joined Kramer & Sigman Films, [[Telefe|Telefe Productions]] and Corner Contenidos after seeing Szifron's previous film ''[[On Probation (2005 film)|On Probation]]'' (2005). ''Wild Tales'' was filmed in Argentina between April and May 2013, and cost US$3.3\u20134.5 million{{efn|name=budget}}\u201470% of which came from Argentina and 30% from Spain.\n\n''Wild Tales'' is based on Szifron's understanding of Western capitalist society as a cage, and depicts the moment at which some people become so frustrated by their surroundings they cannot behave in the socially expected manner. As such, he describes it as a film about the common human need for freedom against society's need to [[Repression (psychoanalysis)|psychologically repress]] humans' animalistic features. The director believed its theme of man versus a system which may have the cards stacked against them would have universal appeal because of global [[wealth inequality]].\n\nThe film received critical acclaim, particularly for being a good example of an engaging anthology film, for its cast (mainly Rivas), humor, cinematography, and music. It won many accolades, including eight of ten [[Platino Awards]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]], and the [[Goya Award for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film]]. It was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[87th Academy Awards]], and for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]]. ''Wild Tales'' is the most-seen Argentine film of all time{{efn|name=record}} and was a box-office record-holder in Argentina, grossing US$11.7\u201321.1 million there for a total of $30.6\u201344.1 million worldwide.{{efn|name=gross}}{{efn|name=g-ar}}\n\n==Plot==\n''Wild Tales'' is composed of six short segments; \"Pasternak\", \"Las ratas\" (\"The Rats\"), \"El m\u00e1s fuerte\" (\"The Strongest\"), \"Bombita\" (\"Little Bomb\"), \"La propuesta\" (\"The Proposal\"), and \"Hasta que la muerte nos separe\" (\"Till Death Do Us Part\"). In the American [[Language localisation|localisation]], the third and fifth sections had their names changed to \"Road to Hell\" and \"The Bill\".\n\n=== \"Pasternak\" ===\nTwo passengers on an airplane start a conversation and discover they both know a man named Gabriel Pasternak; the woman (Mar\u00eda Marull), his ex-girlfriend, had sex with his only friend and the man ([[Dar\u00edo Grandinetti]]), a music critic, savagely reviewed Pasternak's work. In fact, everyone on the flight is connected to Pasternak. A flight attendant reveals Pasternak is the plane's cabin chief and has locked himself inside the cockpit. Amid the panic, as Pasternak's former psychiatrist tries to reason with him, Pasternak crashes the airplane into his parents' house.\n\n=== \"Las ratas\" ===\nAt a highway restaurant, a waitress ([[Julieta Zylberberg]]) recognizes a [[loan shark]] (C\u00e9sar Bord\u00f3n) who had, years before, ruined her family and caused her father's untimely death. The cook ([[Rita Cortese]]) offers to mix [[rat poison]] into the man's food. The waitress refuses the offer but unbeknown to her, the cook adds the poison anyway. When the waitress finds out, she does not take the food away from the man. The loan shark's  teenage son arrives and begins to share his father's meal. Worried the boy might eat the poison, the waitress tries to remove the plate; she throws food in the man's face and he attacks her. The cook kills the loan shark with a chef's knife. In the last scene, the loan shark's son is getting medical treatment from a responding ambulance while the waitress sits next to him. The cook is arrested and is driven away in a police car.\n\n=== \"El m\u00e1s fuerte\" ===\nDiego ([[Leonardo Sbaraglia]]) is driving through a desert and tries to overtake a slower, older car that consistently blocks his path. When he finally passes, he insults the other driver, Mario (Walter Donado). Further up the road, Diego gets a flat tire while Mario catches up. Mario parks his car in front of Diego's, smashes Diego's windshield, and then defecates and urinates on it. When Mario is about to leave, Diego pushes him and his car into the river, and drives off. Fearing retribution, Diego returns to run down Mario but loses control and crashes into the river. Mario enters Diego's car and the men start to fight. Mario leaves Diego to be strangled by a seat belt; he then rips off a piece of his shirt, sets fire to it, and places it in the gas tank to incinerate the car but Diego prevents him from escaping. As the car explodes, the tow truck driver called by Diego arrives. The police later discover the two men's charred bodies holding onto each other and mistake them for lovers who died in a [[crime of passion]].\n\n=== \"Bombita\" ===\nSim\u00f3n Fischer ([[Ricardo Dar\u00edn]]), a demolition expert, picks up a cake for his daughter's birthday party and discovers his car has been towed. He goes to the towed-car lot and explains there were no signs of a no-parking zone. He grudgingly pays the towing fee and misses his daughter's party. The next day, when Sim\u00f3n is refused a refund for the fee at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]], he attacks a glass partition and is arrested. The story makes the news and Sim\u00f3n's employer fires him, and his wife ([[Nancy Dupl\u00e1a]]) seeks a divorce and sole custody of their daughter. After Fischer unsuccessfully applies for another job, he discovers his car has again been towed. He retrieves the car, packs it with explosives, and parks it in a tow zone. After it is towed again, he detonates the explosives, destroying the towing office with no casualties. Sim\u00f3n is imprisoned and becomes a local hero, earning the nickname \"Bombita\" (\"Little bomb\"), and calls on [[social media]] for his release. Sim\u00f3n's wife and daughter visit him in prison for his birthday, presenting him with a cake in the form of a tow truck.\n\n=== \"La propuesta\" ===\nA teenager, driving his wealthy father's car, arrives home after running into a pregnant woman and driving away thereby committing a felony [[hit and run|hit-and-run]]. On the local news, the woman and her child are reported dead, and her husband swears vengeance. The teenage driver's parents ([[Oscar Mart\u00ednez (actor)|Oscar Mart\u00ednez]] and Mar\u00eda Onetto) form a plan with his lawyer ([[Osmar N\u00fa\u00f1ez]]) to use the parent's groundskeeper Jos\u00e9 (Germ\u00e1n de Silva) as a scapegoat in exchange for half a million dollars. The local prosecutor (Diego Vel\u00e1zquez), however, sees through the scheme. The lawyer negotiates to include the prosecutor in the deal for more money, but the guilty son says he wants to confess to the crowd that has gathered outside the house. Frustrated, the father calls off the deal, telling his son to confess. The lawyer renegotiates, still blaming Jos\u00e9, but now for a lower price. As Jos\u00e9 is taken away by the police, the dead woman's husband repeatedly strikes him on the head with a hammer.\n\n=== \"Hasta que la muerte nos separe\" ===\nAt a Jewish wedding<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://forward.com/culture/200353/kafkaesque-wild-tales-is-jewish-film-from-argentin/ |title=Kafkaesque 'Wild Tales' Is Jewish Film from Argentina Inspired by Steven Spielberg |last=Goldmann |first=A.

Romina confronts Ariel as they dance in front of everyone, and in distress, Romina runs to the roof, where a kitchen worker comforts her. Ariel discovers Romina having sex with the worker; she tells Ariel she will sleep with every man who shows her interest, and will take everything Ariel owns if he tries to divorce her, or when he dies. The couple return to the party and continue the festivities. Romina pulls the woman with whom Ariel had sex onto the dance floor, spins her around, and slams her into a mirror. Romina orders the photographer to film Ariel and his mother weeping, declaring she will show the video at a future wedding. Ariel's mother attacks Romina but Ariel and Romina's father pull her off, and Romina collapses with emotion. Ariel approaches Romina and extends a hand. They dance, kiss, and begin to have sex as the guests leave.\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Almovar Goya 2017 cropped.jpg\n| width1 = 160\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Dami\u00e1n Szifron (cropped).jpg\n| width2 = 170\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Producer Pedro Almod\u00f3var (''left'') was interested to work with director-writer Dami\u00e1n Szifron since he saw Szifron's 2005 film ''[[On Probation (2005 film)|On Probation]]''.<ref name=Bathtub/>\n}}\n<!-- http://blogs.indiewire.com/sydneylevine/argentine-director-damian-szifron-on-wild-tales-and-our-animal-instincts-20150220 -->\n\nIn 2007, director Dami\u00e1n Szifron took a break from directing and producing television series and focused on writing.<ref name=\"Bathtub\" /> He worked on three major projects at the same time; a science-fiction film series, a western, and a love story; Szifron was writing short stories to \"let off steam\" and eventually realized they were related.<ref name=cannes>{{Cite web |url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/69-editions/retrospective/2014/actualites/articles/competition-wild-tales-a-waltz-in-six-movements |title=Competition \u2013 Wild Tales: a waltz in six movements |last=Pavan |first=Benoit |publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]] |date=17 May 2014 |access-date=13 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013073124/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/69-editions/retrospective/2014/actualites/articles/competition-wild-tales-a-waltz-in-six-movements |archive-date=13 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Carpetbagger\" /><ref name=\"Filmmaker\" /> There were initially twelve to fifteen tales, out of which he chose the \"wilder\" ones.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/60964.html |title=Press Conference \u2013 Dami\u00e1n Szifron: \"I think of myself as quite normal, I promise\" |last=Pavard |first=Charlotte |publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]] |date=17 May 2014 |access-date=13 March 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013073638/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/69-editions/retrospective/2014/actualites/articles/press-conference-damian-szifron-i-think-of-myself-as-quite-normal-i-promise |archive-date=13 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=sc>{{cite web | url=https://www.screendaily.com/features/argentina-damian-szifron-interview/5100052.article | title=Argentina: Damian Szifron interview | author=Kay, Jeremy | date=10 February 2016 | work=ScreenDaily | access-date=19 January 2022}}</ref> In a 2015 interview, Szifron explained that all the stories are based on real-life situations of people he has known or that Szifron went through himself.

For the albums, the tracks\u2014although a unity\u2014have their \"own identity\"; during a circus spectacle the different acts have value for different reasons but they are one whole.<ref
