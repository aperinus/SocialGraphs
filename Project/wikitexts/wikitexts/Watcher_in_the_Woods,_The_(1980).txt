Based on the [[A Watcher in the Woods|1976 novel]] by [[Florence Engel Randall]], the film tells the story of a teenage girl and her little sister who become encompassed in a supernatural mystery regarding a missing girl in the woods surrounding their new home in the English countryside.\n\nFilmed at [[Pinewood Studios]] and the surrounding areas in [[Buckinghamshire]], England, ''The Watcher in the Woods'' was one of several live-action films produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] in the 1980s, when the studio was targeting [[young adult fiction|young adult]] audiences. The film had its premiere at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York City on April 17, 1980, but was pulled from release after ten days, and future screenings were canceled by the studio because of an overwhelming negative response from critics and audiences. Several changes were made thereafter, including the excision of a pre-credits sequence, as well the filming of an entirely new ending, which was directed by [[Vincent McEveety]] without Hough's involvement. Disney re-released the revised cut of the film on October 9, 1981, and it grossed $5 million.\n\nThough critical response to the film was varied and included numerous unfavorable reviews, the film went on to garner a [[cult following]] in the years following its release.<ref name=bfi/> [[The Watcher in the Woods (2017 film)|Another adaptation of the novel]] was released for television in 2017 starring [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAmericans Helen and Paul Curtis and their daughters, Jan and Ellie, move into a manor in rural [[England]]. Mrs. Aylwood, the owner of the residence who now lives in the guest house next door, notices that Jan bears a striking resemblance to her daughter, Karen, who disappeared inside an abandoned chapel in the woods thirty years earlier.\n\nJan senses something unusual about the property almost immediately, and begins to see strange blue lights in the woods, triangles, and glowing objects. On one occasion, she sees the apparition of a blindfolded girl in a mirror in front of her. Shortly after the family settles in, Ellie goes to buy a puppy she inexplicably names \"Nerak\". After seeing the reflection of the name \"Nerak\" (Karen spelled backwards), Jan is told about the mystery of Mrs. Aylwood's missing daughter by Mike Fleming, the teenage son of a local woman, Mary.\n\nOne afternoon, Nerak runs into woods, and Ellie chases after him. Jan, realizing her sister has disappeared from the yard, goes into the woods to find her, eventually locating her at a pond. In the water, she sees a blue circle of light, and is blinded by a flash, causing her to fall in; she nearly drowns, but Mrs. Aylwood saves her. Mrs. Aylwood brings Jan and Ellie to her home, and recounts the night her daughter disappeared.\n\nLater, Mike discovers that his mother, Mary, was with Karen when she disappeared, but she evades his questions. Meanwhile, Jan attempts to get information from John Keller, a reclusive aristocrat who was also there that night, but he refuses to speak to her. On her way home, Jan cuts through the woods, where she encounters a local [[hermit]], Tom Colley, who tells Jan he was also present at Karen's disappearance. He claims that during a [[seance]]-like initiation ceremony on the night of a [[lunar eclipse]], Karen vanished when lightning struck the church bell tower.\n\nJan decides to recreate the ceremony during the upcoming [[solar eclipse]], hoping it will bring Karen back. She gathers Mary, Tom, and John at the abandoned chapel, and they attempt to repeat the ceremony. Meanwhile, Ellie, while watching the eclipse from the front yard, suddenly goes into a [[trance]]-like state, apparently possessed, and enters the woods. At the chapel, the ceremony is interrupted by a powerful wind that shatters the windows, and Ellie appears. In a voice that is not her own, she explains that an accidental switch took place thirty years ago, in which Karen traded places with an alien presence from an alternate dimension; thus, the Watcher has been haunting the woods since, while Karen has remained suspended in time.\n\nThe Watcher leaves Ellie's body, manifesting as a pillar of light, fueled by the \"circle of friendship\". It engulfs Jan and lifts her into the air, but Mike intercedes and pulls her away before the Watcher disappears. Simultaneously, the eclipse ends, and Karen, still the same age as when she disappeared, reappears &ndash; still blindfolded. She removes the blindfold just as Mrs. Aylwood enters the chapel.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Mrs. Aylwood\n* [[Carroll Baker]] as Helen Curtis\n* [[David McCallum]] as Paul Curtis\n* [[Lynn-Holly Johnson]] as Jan Curtis\n* [[Kyle Richards]] as Ellie Curtis\n* [[Ian Bannen]] as John Keller\n* [[Richard Pasco]] as Tom Colley\n* [[Frances Cuka]] as Mary Fleming\n* [[Benedict Taylor]] as Mike Fleming\n* [[Eleanor Summerfield]] as Mrs. Thayer\n* [[Georgina Hale]] as Young Mrs. Aylwood\n* [[Katharine Levy]] as Karen Aylwood\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n''The Watcher in the Woods'' is based on Florence Engel Randall's 1976 novel ''[[A Watcher in the Woods]]''.

In addition to the work of studio writers, a number of science fiction writers, including Robert Silverberg, Joe Haldeman, and the Niven/Pournelle team, all working separately, were brought in and paid for alternate endings, but apparently none of those were used.

After the screen tests were completed and viewed by the crew, Hough was concerned about Davis playing the younger character, and felt that the make-up and hair work had  \"maybe knocked about twenty years off of her age, but not forty\";<ref name=\"ABDVD\" /> Davis was 72 years old at the time. Upon viewing the tests, Hough cued for the crew to leave the screening room, and said, \"Bette, I don't think you've made it\".
