It is the sequel to ''[[Scary Movie 2]]'' and is the third film in the [[Scary Movie (film series)|''Scary Movie'' film series]], and the first to be directed by [[David Zucker]].\n\nThe film stars [[Anna Faris]] and [[Regina Hall]] reprising their roles as Cindy Campbell and Brenda Meeks, respectively. New cast members include [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Simon Rex]], [[Anthony Anderson]], [[Kevin Hart]], and [[Leslie Nielsen]]. It is the first film in the series to feature no involvement from the [[Wayans family]]. The characters of Shorty Meeks and Ray Wilkins, previously played by [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]] and [[Marlon Wayans]], do not appear, nor are they referenced.\n\nThe film's plot significantly parodies the films ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', ''[[Signs (2002 film)|Signs]]'', ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]].'' The film grossed $220.7 million worldwide. It is the last film in the series to be released by [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s subsidiary [[Miramax|Miramax Films]], under the brand [[Dimension Films]]. It was named the [[2004 Teen Choice Awards]] in the category of ''Choice Movie: Your Parents Didn't Want You to See''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000644/2004|title=Teen Choice Awards (2004)|website=[[IMDb]]|access-date=2016-10-11}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nKatie and Becca talk about what Katie believes is a sex tape, but Becca calls it a [[The Ring (2002 film)|cursed tape]]. After several odd occurrences, they both die. Meanwhile, in a farm outside Washington, D.C., widowed farmer Tom Logan and his brother George discover a [[crop circle]], saying \"Attack Here!\", after noticing the dogs' strange activity.\n\n[[Cindy Campbell]], now a reporter, announces the crop circles on the news. She picks up her paranormally endowed nephew Cody from school, where her best friend Brenda Meeks is his teacher. George picks up his niece Sue, who is in the same class. Cindy and George quickly become attracted to one another, and George invites her and Brenda to a rap-battle with his rapper friends Mahalik and CJ. George proves to be talented but is violently thrown out after he raises his unintentionally [[Ku Klux Klan|pointy white hood]].\n\nAfter watching the cursed videotape, Brenda asks Cindy to keep her company. After playing several pranks on Cindy, the girl from the cursed tape, Tabitha, fights with and kills Brenda. George receives a phone call about the death, and Tom meets with Sayaman, who apologizes for the accident involving himself and Tom's wife Annie.\n\nDuring Brenda's wake, George and Mahalik wreak havoc in an unsuccessful attempt to revive her, only to blow up her body and get kicked out of the house. Cindy finds the cursed tape in Brenda's room, watches it, and receives a phone call warning her of her death in seven days. She calls George, CJ and Mahalik for help. CJ says his Aunt Shaneequa might be able to help. Shaneequa, the Matrix [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]], and her husband Orpheus agree to watch the tape with her. Shaneequa discovers the hidden image of a lighthouse and gets in a fight with Tabitha's mother. Shaneequa tells Cindy to find the lighthouse to break the curse. When Cindy returns home, she finds Cody watched the tape.\n\nAt work, Cindy searches through pictures of lighthouses before finding the one from the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy warns everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter. Her boss interrupts her, and the anchor mechanically recites the wrong message. The Logans take it seriously since they encountered an alien disguised as [[Michael Jackson]], and President Baxter Harris personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy visits the lighthouse, where she encounters [[Architect (The Matrix)|The Architect]]. The loquacious old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistakenly returned it to [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] believing it was ''[[Pootie Tang]]'', unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.\n\nReturning home, Cindy discovers her station has been broadcasting the evil tape for hours, and there have been various sightings of aliens around the world. Worse, Cody is missing. Cindy tracks him to the Logan farm, where he has taken refuge with George. Tom orders everybody into the basement for safety, as he, George and Mahalik go outside to fight the extraterrestrials. The aliens arrive but reveal they are friendly and have come to stop Tabitha, since they accidentally watched the tape on a broadcast they had intercepted, again believing it was ''Pootie Tang''.\n\nIn the basement, Cindy recognizes the farm's cellar from the tape, and she finds the well where Tabitha drowned. Suddenly, Tabitha appears behind her. A short fight ensues, during which Tabitha takes Cody hostage. Cindy and George appeal to her, offering her a place in their family. Tabitha transforms into a little girl and claims her curse is broken, but changes back to her monstrous form and says she was \u201cjust screwing on them\u201d. As she advances on Cindy and the others, President Harris opens a door and accidentally knocks her into the well. The aliens leave in peace, and Cindy and George get married. Leaving for their honeymoon, they realize they left Cody behind. After Cindy avoids hitting Cody at an intersection, Cody breathes a sigh of relief and another car strikes him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anna Faris]] as [[Cindy Campbell]]\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Tom Logan\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Brenda Meeks\n* [[Simon Rex]] as George Logan\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as President Baxter Harris\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|Aunt Shaneequa/The Oracle]], based on The Oracle from ''[[The Matrix]]''\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Mahalik \n* [[Kevin Hart]] as CJ Iz\n* [[Camryn Manheim]] as Trooper Champlin\n* [[George Carlin]] as [[Architect (The Matrix)|The Architect]], based on the architect from ''[[The Matrix]]''\n* [[Eddie Griffin]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Orpheus]], based on Morpheus from ''[[The Matrix]]''\n* [[Pamela Anderson]] as Becca Kotler\n* [[Jenny McCarthy]] as Katie Embry\n* [[Drew Mikuska]] as Cody Campbell \n* [[Denise Richards]] as Annie Logan\n* [[D.

A \"3.5\" special DVD was also released, and contained several more deleted scenes than the original DVD, with an unrated version of the film.\n\nIn the alternate ending, Cindy is told Cody does not exist by her psychiatrist (played by [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]). After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand over at a different spot. Cody goes over there but is followed by [[Santa Claus]]. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into [[Hulk|The Hulk]]. President Harris tries to hulk out but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabitha's. She wins the battle by performing moves from ''The Matrix'' and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be [[M. Night Shyamalan]].\n\nOne of the scenes that appeared on the Extended DVD named ''Scary Movie 3.5'' was part of the unrated feature. After Pamela Anderson and Jenny McCarthy shut off the TV, the two compliment each other on their good looks. Anderson then asks if McCarthy wants her \"shaved pussy\", but this turns out to be a furless kitten.\n\nIn an extended scene, the person who runs Cody down at the end is shown to be Michael Jackson.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Scary Movie 3'' opened at the number one spot in the US, grossing $48.1 million in its opening weekend<ref name=mojo/> and $57.5 million for that week.
