To survive, he reads the obituaries and tries to convince the widows that the deceased purchased a painting shortly before dying.\n\nWhen Art tries this scam with mobster Gene, whose father just died, he tries to have his henchmen beat him up. Art barely escapes by hiding in Betty Kerner's Rolls Royce, Gene's estranged two-time ex-wife and wealthy heiress. \n\nBetty is excited to help the handsome stranger, and they end up making love. Impulsive, she wants to marry Art in two weeks, and the tabloids immediately unearth the story. Stuck between Betty who won't budge and Gene who still loves her, although Art isn't happy about it, he plays along.\n\nOne morning at Betty's, Art surprises her in the shower, naked. He sees it's not Betty, but her sister Liz, an art professor. He is attracted to her, but she is very cold and distant, seeing him as a gigolo. He invents a fake twin brother Bart (who wears glasses and has his hair down instead of in a ponytail), a painter who just returned from Italy. \n\nBart and Liz instantly hit it off while Gene still tries to romance Betty. They talk about everything, he plays with her dog and even invites her to Manny's studio, pretending it's his. When Liz's favorite painting in the studio turns out to actually be Art's (who gave it to Manny as an \"advance\" on what he owes him), he gives it to her.\n\nThanks to his imaginary twin brother, Art manages to romance both sisters. As the \"twin brothers\" can't be in the same place at the same time, it means a lot of running around, excuses and enlisting a very reluctant Gloria. One evening he needs to be on two simultaneous dates. \n\nAt the restaurant with Betty, he drugs her wine to shorten the date and puts a very sleepy Betty to bed. He then goes out with Liz (who chooses the same restaurant), also making love to her. The next morning, Art/Bart has to run back and forth between the sisters' bedrooms as he's supposed to be with them simultaneously.\n\nThe night before the wedding, Art spots Gene's two henchmen near his house and escapes with his dad's help. He tries to spend the night at Gloria's but Manny is there, he gives him the studio's keys to spend the night. There, Art is painting again but is interrupted by the henchmen who start beating him up. When Art proposes leaving town, Gene insists he go ahead with the wedding and threatens to break one bone for each tear Betty cries. \n\nAfter they leave, Liz arrives to the studio, thinking Bart got beat up. He tells her he is Art, that he fell in love when he saw her in the shower and tries to kiss her. She thinks Art is trying to make a pass at her, not realizing Bart is Art.\n\nOn the wedding day, Liz tells Bart his \"brother\" tried to kiss her, so the wedding should be called off. Bart needs to \"confront\" Art in a study alone, with Liz and Gene listening outside -and, unbeknownst to everyone, also by Betty through the phone. When Gene enters the study, he confronts Art alone, and again threatens him if he doesn't marry Betty. He insists that they want is irrelevant, and that the only thing that matters is Betty's happiness. \n\nDuring the wedding ceremony, Betty, shaken by Gene's selfless devotion, calls the wedding off. Falling into Gene's arms, she admits she loves him too, and they elope. In the general confusion, Liz sees her dog wanting to play with Art and realizes he and Bart are the same person. Bart then gives Liz a fake excuse to \"go back to Italy\" (which she of course doesn't buy), adding he's not worthy.\n\nMonths later, Art's gallery is now very successful (Gloria owns and manages it, and Art is the artist). At the inauguration of his work, he notices Liz, who has feelings for him but is unsure of who he really is. Art convinces her he is the one she had feelings for, and the movie ends with them happily walking down the street, hand in hand.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Art Dodge, \"Bart Dodge\"\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Betty Kerner\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Liz Kerner\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Gene\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Gloria\n* [[Eli Wallach]] as Sheldon Dodge\n* [[Gabino Diego]] as Mane\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Dr. Huffeyer\n* [[Allan Rich]] as Reverend Larrabee\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Sommelier\n* [[Phil Leeds]] as Lincoln Brigade\n* [[Sid Raymond]] as Lincoln Brigade\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received negative reviews from critics.
