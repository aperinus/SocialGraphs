He has with him a [[Torah]] scroll for the San Francisco [[synagogue]]. Belinski, an innocent, trusting, and inexperienced traveler, falls in with three [[con artist|con men]], the brothers Matt and Darryl Diggs and their partner Mr. Jones, who trick him into helping pay for a wagon and supplies to go west, then brutally rob him and leave him and most of his belongings scattered along a deserted road in Pennsylvania.\n\nStill determined to make it to San Francisco, Belinski, on foot and exhausted, comes upon a colony of [[Amish]] people.  From their simple black clothing he jumps to the conclusion that they are \"Landsmen\", fellow [[Chasidim|Chasidic]] Jews, until he notices the bible carried in the pocket of one of the men, at which point he faints dead away.  The local people are not fazed.  They take care of Belinski and collect enough money from their congregation to provide him a ticket on the westbound train. When he reaches the end of the line in Ohio, the rabbi manages to find work on the railroad until he saves up enough money to buy a horse and some supplies.\n\nOn his way west again, he is befriended and looked after by a stranger named Tommy Lillard, a bank robber with a soft heart who is moved by Belinski's helplessness and frank personality, despite the trouble it occasionally gives him. For instance, when Lillard robs a bank on a Thursday, he finds that Belinski (an [[Orthodox Jew]]) will not ride on the [[Shabbat]] even with a hanging [[posse (law enforcement)|posse]] on his trail. They still manage to get away, because the horses are rested from having been walked for a full day. They are fresh and able to ride all night, outdistancing their pursuers. The two also experience [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] customs and hospitality, disrupt a [[Trappist]] monastery's [[vow of silence]] with an innocent gesture of gratitude, and learn a little about each other's culture.\n\nWhile stopping in a small town not too far from San Francisco, Belinski encounters the Diggs brothers and Jones again. He gets into a fight with the three of them and, after taking a beating, is rescued by Lillard, who takes back what they had stolen from Belinski and more besides. Seeking revenge, the three bandits follow the pair and ambush them on a California beach where they have stopped to bathe. A firefight ensues; Tommy shoots Jones dead and grazes Matt Diggs, who flees the scene. Belinski experiences a crisis of faith when he is forced to kill Darryl Diggs in [[self-defense]] after Darryl wounded Tommy. Lillard restores his faith by an eloquent argument with simple language, reminding him that he still is what he is inside, despite what he had to do on the beach.\n\nWhen Matt Diggs, sole survivor of the ambushing trio, prepares to avenge his brother by killing Belinski, Lillard springs to his friend's defense. Belinski, regaining his composure, shows his wisdom and courage in front of the entire community by disarming and exiling Diggs from San Francisco. The film ends with Belinski marrying Rosalie Bender, the youngest daughter, with whom he had fallen in love at first sight, not the eldest daughter to whom he had been betrothed sight unseen by her father, with Lillard participating in the ceremony as his best friend.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Avram Belinski\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Tommy Lillard\n* [[Ramon Bieri]] as Mr. Jones\n* [[Val Bisoglio]] as Chief Gray Cloud\n* [[George DiCenzo|George Ralph DiCenzo]] as Darryl Diggs\n* [[Leo Fuchs]] as Chief Rabbi\n* [[Penny Peyser]] as Rosalie Bender\n* [[William Smith (actor)|William Smith]] as Matt Diggs\n* [[Jack Somack]] as Samuel Bender\n* Beege Barkette as Sarah Mindl Bender\n* [[Shay Duffin]] as O'Leary\n* Walter Janowitz as Old Amish Man\n* [[Frank De Vol]] as The Red Dog Piano Player\n* [[Joe Kapp]] as Paco Monterano\n* [[Clyde Kusatsu]] as Mr. Ping\n* Cliff Pellow as Mr. Daniels\n* Eda Reiss Merin as Mrs. Bender\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Brother Bruno\n* [[Ian Wolfe]] as Father Joseph\n* [[Martin Garner (actor)|Martin Garner]] as The Rabbi\n* [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] as Julius Rosensheine\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film was in development for seven years.

John J. Puccio of Movie Metropolis writes that Wayne was \"eager to take it on as a comic follow-up to ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' and ''[[Rooster Cogburn (film)|Rooster Cogburn]]''. Salary concerns nixed the idea, though, and it's questionable he would have finished the shooting, in any case, as he died shortly before ''The Frisco Kid'' opened.\"<ref name= \"JP\">{{cite web |url= http://moviemet.com/review/frisco-kid-dvd-review#.VLQdlE0o6cg |author= Puccio, John J. |date= February 13, 2006 |title= FRISCO KID - DVD review |publisher= Movie Metropolis |access-date= January 12, 2015}}</ref> (Another source says Wayne did not want to make the film due to \"vulgarity\" in the script.<ref>Taxi Driver Totaled on TV.-Big John's Big Bux\nMcCarthy, Todd.

[Aldrich's] professionalism serves the film well. It's very hard to fault on a technical level, and he brings a strong visual sense to bear on a number of sequences that raise them several notches above the TV flavor of the material. The dance sequence, when Avram and his unlikely companion, Tommy (Harrison Ford), are prisoners of a tribe of Indians, is a good case in point, as is the final shoot-out in the streets of San Francisco... Never a great movie, it's nonetheless a pleasant one \u2014 an old-fashioned entertainment that more than gets by on the unforced (albeit unlikely) chemistry of Wilder and Ford.\"<ref name= \"Hanke\">{{cite news |last= Hanke |first= Ken |title= ''The Frisco Kid'' |work= Mountain Xpress |location= Asheville, NC |date= June 15, 2005 |url= http://mountainx.com/movies/reviews/friscokid-php/ |access-date= January 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nPuccio of Movie Metropolis called the film \"humorous and touching\" and \"uplifting as well\": \"''The Frisco Kid'' is not a great film; it's not even a very good film by the best filmmaking standards; but it's such a sweet and gentle film, it's hard not to like... The film moseys along at a leisurely pace, and the director has a little difficulty finding the right comedic tone between dry, subtle farce and outright slapstick; yet it manages to find a soft spot in the heart for every scene, so maybe 'heartwarming' is what Aldrich had in mind, in which case he couldn't have done better.\"<ref name= \"JP\" />\n\nWilder's performance was widely praised. Ebert wrote, \"What's poignant about the film is that Wilder's performance is such a nice one. He's likable, plucky, versatile. He is, in fact, as good an actor here as he's ever been before, and at his own brand of complex vulnerability Gene Wilder has never been surpassed.\"<ref name= \"Ebert\" /> Hanke said, \"But the main interest in the film is probably Gene Wilder's performance, which is interesting simply because it's one of the few times that Wilder played a character that wasn't essentially Gene Wilder. And, lo and behold, he does a perfectly credible job of being someone else \u2014 or at least someone else who isn't Willy Wonka.\"<ref name= \"Hanke\" /> Film scholar Stuart Galbraith IV declares that Wilder gives \"one of his very best performances\" and calls his character \"incredibly endearing\": \"''The Frisco Kid'' is a real surprise, offering as it does one of Gene Wilder's best characterizations in a film that's alternately funny and sweetly touching, this despite Robert Aldrich's generally indelicate direction.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20598/frisco-kid-the/ |author= Galbraith, Stuart |date= March 13, 2006 |title= ''The Frisco Kid'' |publisher= DVD Talk |access-date= January 12, 2015}}</ref>  Puccio wrote, \"Nobody does nice like Gene Wilder...
