It is a British-French venture produced by [[StudioCanal]] and [[Working Title Films]], and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nStarring [[Rowan Atkinson]] in the title role, [[Natalie Imbruglia]], [[Ben Miller]] and [[John Malkovich]], it is the first installment of the [[Johnny English (franchise)|''Johnny English'' film series]] and serves as a parody and homage to the spy genre, mainly the [[James Bond]] film series, as well as Atkinson's [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] character. The character is also related to Atkinson's bumbling spy character from a series of adverts in the United Kingdom for [[Barclaycard]] in the 1990s.\n\nReleased theatrically in the United States on 18 July 2003, the film met with mixed reviews from critics but was commercially successful and grossed $160 million worldwide against a budget of $40 million.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\"/> The film was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on 11 April 2003 and topped the country's box office for the next three weekends, before being overtaken by ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20030411|title=Weekend box office 11th April 2003 - 13th April 2003|publisher=25thframe.co.uk|access-date=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20030418|title=Weekend box office 18th April 2003 - 20th April 2003|publisher=25thframe.co.uk|access-date=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20030425|title=Weekend box office 25th April 2003 - 27th April 2003|publisher=25thframe.co.uk|access-date=30 December 2016}}</ref> It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Johnny English Reborn]]'' (2011) and ''[[Johnny English Strikes Again]]'' (2018).\n\n== Plot ==\nKindhearted but clumsy [[MI7]] agent Johnny English dreams of becoming Agent One. After Agent One and the remaining agents are killed by English's unwitting incompetence, he is the lone surviving agent capable of finishing Agent One's mission.\n\nAssigned to thwart a plot to steal the newly restored [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] at an event hosted by French prison mogul Pascal Sauvage, English meets the mysterious Lorna Campbell at the jewels' unveiling at the [[Tower of London]]. The jewels are stolen during a sudden blackout. English accidentally knocks out the deputy head of security and fights an imaginary assailant to cover his mistakes; he gives a false description of the unseen suspect to MI7 head Pegasus.\n\nEnglish and his assistant Angus Bough follow a tunnel dug beneath the jewel's display case and confront German thieves Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, who escape in a hearse. Having pursued the wrong hearse, English gatecrashes a funeral.\n\nSauvage is revealed to be Klein and Vendetta's employer, and instructs the thieves to eliminate English. Pegasus does not believe English and Bough's  claims that Sauvage is involved. English and Bough are attacked by Vendetta, who escapes when English mistakenly attacks Bough. English again encounters Campbell and, having seen her at two crime scenes, his suspicions deepen when no record of her can be found.\n\nEnglish and Bough parachute into Sauvage's headquarters and learn that Sauvage, a descendant of [[Charles Edward Stuart]], plans to make himself king using an impostor [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. English observes that the fake Archbishop has a tattoo on his bottom saying ''Jesus is coming &mdash; look busy''. Campbell reveals herself to be an [[Interpol]] agent tracking Sauvage. English crashes a reception hosted by Sauvage and is removed from the case by Pegasus.\n\nSauvage scraps his plan to use the fake Archbishop and instead blackmails Queen [[Elizabeth II]] to abdicate and erase her [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] by threatening her [[Royal corgis|corgis]]. Campbell, now in charge of the assignment, convinces English to travel with her to Sauvage's French ch\u00e2teau and investigate behind Pegasus's back. English and Campbell learn Sauvage intends to transform mainland Britain into the world's biggest prison. English accidentally blows their cover; he steals an incriminating DVD but accidentally takes the wrong disc before the two agents are captured.\n\nBough rescues English and Campbell, and the three race to stop Sauvage's coronation. English exposes the Archbishop's bare bottom and discovers by the lack of the expected tattoo that he is genuine. Undeterred, English has Bough play the incriminating DVD, only to find it is bugged footage of himself lip-syncing to [[ABBA]]'s \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\" in his underclothes. Having snuck away, English swings back in on a wire to steal St Edward's Crown from the Archbishop. Sauvage attacks English, who drops the crown, falls from the wire, lands on the throne knocking Sauvage off, and is crowned himself. As king, English has Sauvage arrested before restoring Elizabeth to the throne, requesting only a knighthood as reward.\n\nAs Sauvage is awaiting trial for [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]] and execution, he requests that after he dies, his brain will be donated for schizophrenia research. English and Campbell drive to southern France but English accidentally [[Ejection seat|ejects]] Campbell from his car whilst attempting to kiss her. She lands in a swimming pool where Bough and a man matching the description of the imaginary assailant are on holiday.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Johnny English\n* [[Natalie Imbruglia]] as Lorna Campbell, an INTERPOL agent\n* [[Ben Miller]] as Angus Bough, English's partner in the field\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Pascal Sauvage, a French prison owner and descendant of [[James II of England|James II]]\n* [[Oliver Ford Davies]] as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Pegasus, the head of MI7\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Douglas McFerran]] as Carlos Vendetta, one of Sauvage's minions\n* Steve Nicolson as Dieter Klein, one of Sauvage's minions\n* [[Tasha de Vasconcelos]] as the Exotic Woman in English's daydream\n* [[Greg Wise]] as Agent One, MI7's top agent whose death English is unknowingly responsible for\n* [[Terence Harvey]] as the Funeral Officer at Agent One's funeral\n* [[Nina Young]] as Pegasus' Secretary\n* Rowland Davies as Sir Anthony Chevenix, Head of Royal Security\n* Philippa Fordham as the Snobby Woman, whom English harasses at the [[Tower of London]] ceremony\n* [[Prunella Scales]] as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]\n* Tim Berrington as Roger, an MI7 agent who helps discover the identity of the \"assailant\" at the Tower of London\n* Simon Bernstein as the Assailant, who English makes up to cover his error\n* Martin Lawton as the Hearse Driver at the funeral English mistakenly crashes\n* Neville Phillips as the Priest at the funeral English mistakenly crashes\n* Takuya Matsumoto as the Sushi Waiter\n* Peter Tenn as the Sushi Bar Customer\n* [[Sam Beazley]] as the Elderly Man at the Hospital\n* Kevin Moore as the Doctor\n* Faruk Pruti as the Truth Serum Guard\n* Marc Danbury as the Guard that holds Bough at gunpoint in Sauvage's office\n* Jack Raymond as the French Reception Waiter\n* [[Jenny Galloway]] as the [[Foreign Secretary]]\n* [[Chris Tarrant]] as the Radio Announcer at Sauvage's coronation\n* [[James Greene (Northern Irish actor)|James Greene]] as the Scottish Bishop at Sauvage's coronation\n* [[Clive Graham]] as the Welsh Bishop at Sauvage's coronation\n* [[Trevor McDonald]] as the Newsreader, who reveals Sauvage's fate\n\nAdditionally, the film's director [[Peter Howitt]] played a cameo in the film, as the man Bough threatens to play the DVD at Sauvage's coronation.\n\n== Production ==\nIn March 2000, before the release of ''[[Maybe Baby (film)|Maybe Baby]]'', Atkinson signed up to star as a spoof 007, with the news becoming official.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/02/news|title=Rowan Atkinson to star as spoof 007|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2000|access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002, ''Johnny English'' [[principal photography]] commenced.
