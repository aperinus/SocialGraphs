({{IPA-sw|h\u0251t\u0251ri|pron}}, [[Swahili language|Swahili]] for \"Danger!\") is a 1962 American [[Adventure film|adventure]] [[romantic comedy]] film starring [[John Wayne]] as the leader of a group of professional game catchers in Africa.<ref name=\"McCarthy572\">McCarthy, Todd. ''Howard Hawks: the grey fox of Hollywood'', New York, Grove Press, 1997, pg 572, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1598-0}}</ref>  Directed by [[Howard Hawks]], it was shot in [[Technicolor]] and filmed on location in northern [[Tanganyika (1961\u20131964)|Tanganyika]] (in what is now [[Tanzania]]). The film includes dramatic wildlife chases and the scenic backdrop of [[Mount Meru (Tanzania)|Mount Meru]], a dormant volcano.\n\nAt the [[35th Academy Awards]], [[Russell Harlan]] was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Color Cinematography]] for his work on ''Hatari!'', but the award went to [[Freddie Young]] for his work on [[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|''Lawrence of Arabia'']].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]] in the 1960s, the Momella Game Company captures animals for [[zoo]]s and [[circuses]] using off-road vehicles, lassos, and cages. The company consists of [[France|Frenchwoman]] Brandy de la Court, the unofficial \"boss\"; tough [[Irish-American]] Sean Mercer, who heads the capture expeditions; retired [[Germans|German]] [[race car]] driver Kurt M\u00fcller; [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Bullfighter]] Luis Francisco Garcia Lopez; [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[sharpshooter]] Little Wolf (aka \"The Indian\"); [[zoophobia|zoophobic]] former [[NYC]] [[Taxicab driver|cabbie]] \"Pockets\"; and several [[Tanzanian people|native]] staff.\n\nKurt and the Indian drive a herding [[jeep]] to force animals toward a larger [[pickup truck|capture truck]] driven by Pockets. An aggressive rhino gores the Indian's leg during a pursuit; the crew transports him to [[Arusha]] [[hospital]], where French [[marksman]] Charles \"Chips\" Maurey approaches them, wanting the Indian's job. Kurt, offended, punches him. Chips, the only one present with the Indian's blood type, agrees to undergo a [[blood transfusion|transfusion]] to save him; Sean then offers him a job.\n\nReturning to their [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]], the crew finds [[Italians|Italian]] [[photographer]] Anna-Maria \"Dallas\" D'Alessandro has arrived, though everyone was expecting a male photographer. Because she was sent by the [[Basel]] [[Basel zoo|zoo]], Momella's biggest client, Sean reluctantly allows her to accompany the crew on a [[giraffe]] capture. Despite many rookie mishaps, Dallas enjoys herself, and everyone except Sean votes to let her stay.\n\nThe next day, Chips arrives and has a sharpshooting contest with Kurt; afterwards, the two become friends. Dallas and Sean gradually are attracted to one another, though Sean resists, as his first fiancee abandoned him. Meanwhile, Brandy is courted by Kurt, Chips, and Pockets. The Indian is released from the hospital; still shaken, he makes Sean agree to not pursue any more rhinos until the end of the season.\n\nOn a multi-day trip, the crew passes through a village where a [[rogue elephant|rogue]] female [[African bush elephant|elephant]] has been killed by a [[game warden]]. They find her orphaned calf, and Dallas adopts it despite Sean's protests. Chaos ensues when the crew helps Dallas obtain [[goats]] to get milk for the calf; that night, Dallas apologizes to Sean, and coerces him into a kiss.\n\nAfter another orphaned elephant calf shows up at the compound, the local [[Arusha people|waArusha tribe]], impressed by how the elephants follow Dallas, adopt her into the tribe. They name her \"Mama Tembo\" (\"Mother of Elephants\"). A third elephant orphan later makes its way into the compound.\n\nThe crew capture a [[zebra]], an [[oryx]], a [[Grant's gazelle|gazelle]], a [[leopard]], and a [[cape buffalo|buffalo]]. Later, the herding car blows a tire and flips while pursuing a [[wildebeest]]; Kurt's shoulder is [[dislocated shoulder|dislocated]] and Chips' leg is badly [[sprain]]ed in the wreck. The same day, Pockets falls off a tall fence. He is unhurt, but Brandy shows the most concern for him out of the three, indicating whom she loves.\n\nPockets successfully launches a small rocket attached to a net to trap nearly 500 [[vervet monkey|vervet monkeys]] in a tree, surprising everyone, including himself. A rhino is the only order left to fulfill; the crew finds an angry bull rhino, and, although it escapes once, they safely capture it, much to The Indian's relief.\n\nThe season's work done, Dallas fears Sean will always see her as he saw his former fianc\u00e9e; she writes a farewell letter and flees. Sean, helped by the crew and the three baby elephants, tracks her to Arusha, where they reconcile. Sean and Dallas are married and prepare to spend their wedding night in Sean's room; however, the three elephants barge in and destroy the bed.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Wayne]] as Sean Mercer\n*[[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]] as Kurt M\u00fcller \n*[[Elsa Martinelli]] as Anna Maria \"Dallas\" D'Alessandro\n*[[Red Buttons]] as \"Pockets\"\n*[[G\u00e9rard Blain]] as Charles \"Chips\" Maurey \n*[[Bruce Cabot]] as Little Wolf (\"The Indian\")\n*[[Mich\u00e8le Girardon]] as Brandy de la Court \n*[[Valentin de Vargas]] as Luis Francisco Garcia Lopez\n*[[Eduard Franz]] as Dr. Sanderson\n*[[Cathy Lewis]] as the voice of \"Arusha Control\" on the radio (uncredited)\n*[[Queenie Leonard]] as Nurse (uncredited, scenes deleted)\n\n==Production==\nWhile ''Hatari!'' is bookended by the two attempts to capture a rhinoceros, it otherwise has a very loose script, and, like many other works by [[Howard Hawks]], is principally structured around the relationships among the characters. At the start of production all Hawks knew was that he wanted to make a movie about people who catch animals in Africa for zoos, which he saw as a dangerous profession that would allow for exciting scenes, the likes of which had never been seen on-screen before.<ref name=\"McCarthy572\"/> Much of the script was written by Hawks' favorite writer, [[Leigh Brackett]], after the production returned from Africa with footage of the characters catching various animals, and before and during studio takes in Hollywood.\n\nHawks increased his knowledge of animal-catching by studying the work of the famous [[South Africa]]n animal conservationist Dr. [[Ian Player]]. In 1952, South Africa was eliminating large wild animals to protect livestock, and only 300 white rhinos survived. Player then invented his famed rhino catching technique to relocate and save the [[white rhino]]s. His project was called \"Operation Rhino\", and it was recorded in the renowned documentary film of the same name.<ref name=\"Thomas McIntyre 2012, pg 70\">McIntyre, Thomas. \"Fifty Years of HATARI! \u2013 The Story of Most Expensive Safari In the World.\" ''Sports Afield'', May/June 2012, pg 70</ref><ref>McCarthy, pg 575</ref>\n\nAnother source of inspiration for Hawks was the famous animal photographer [[Ylla]], so he had Brackett add the character of Dallas to the script. Hawks said, \"We took that part of the story from a real character, a German girl. She was the best animal photographer in the world.\"<ref name=\"Thomas McIntyre 2012, pg 70\"/><ref>[[Joseph McBride (writer)]], ''Hawks on Hawks'' University of California Press, 1982, {{ISBN|978-0-520-04344-2}}, pg 143</ref><ref>[[Peter Bogdanovich]], ''The Cinema of Howard Hawks'', Museum of Modern Art-Doubleday, 1962</ref><ref>Scott Breivold, [[Peter Bogdanovich]] interviewer, ''Howard Hawks: interviews'', University Press of Mississippi, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-57806-832-6}}, pg. 38</ref><ref>McCarthy, pg 573</ref>\n\nHawks stated in interviews that he had originally planned to star both [[Clark Gable]], who had just played a rough-and-ready wild horse catcher (who did his own stunts) in [[The Misfits (1961 film)|''The Misfits'']], and Wayne in the film, until Gable's death ruled that out.\n\nMuch of the film revolves around scenes of the cast chasing animals in jeeps and trucks across the plains of [[East Africa]]. Ngorongoro farm, purchased by Hardy Kruger after the filming, served as the movie's setting. The animals pursued are all live, wild, and untrained. Capturing animals by chasing them down is banned today both due to concerns over strain upon all those involved in a chase (targeted and not) and the development of effective animal tranquilizers and powerful [[tranquilizer gun|dart guns]] to subdue those ultimately selected.\n\nAccording to director Howard Hawks, all of the animal captures in the film were performed by the actors themselves\u2014not by stuntmen or animal handlers (although a stand-in, Mildred Lucy \"Rusty\" Walkley, was used for some scenes involving Elsa Martinelli's character<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44555225 ''Australian Woman's Weekly'' December 5, 1962]</ref>). When Hawks interviewed de Vargas, he said production would be very dangerous, as there would be no double, and showed de Vargas a documentary.<ref>McCarthy, pg 577</ref> Government-licensed animal catcher Willy de Beer was hired by Hawks as a technical adviser, and he and his assistants worked with the actors on how to go about catching the animals.<ref>Stanley, Frank. \"Hatari.\" ''International Photographer: The Magazine of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences'', September 1961, Vol 33 No 9, pg 181</ref> During filming, the rhino really did escape and the actors had to recapture it, which Hawks included in the completed film for its realism.\n\nMuch of the audio in the capture sequences had to be re-dubbed due to John Wayne's cursing while wrestling with the animals, and Hawks said Wayne admitted being scared during some of the action scenes, particularly those in which he is sitting in the exposed \"catching seat\" as a truck hurtles over terrain full of hidden holes and obstacles. According to Hawks, Wayne \"had the feeling with every swerve that the car was going to overturn as he hung on for dear life, out in the open with only a seat belt for support, motor roaring, body jarring every which-way, animals kicking dirt and rocks and the thunder of hundreds of hooves increasing the din in his ears.\"<ref>McCarthy, pg 582</ref> On the other hand, one evening, while Buttons and Wayne were playing cards outside, a leopard came out of the bush towards them, but, when Buttons mentioned the approaching leopard, Wayne reportedly simply said, \"See what he wants.\"<ref>McIntyre, pg 73</ref>\n\nFilming in Africa was not only dangerous for the actors, however. De Vargas said de Beer was mauled by a loose baby leopard that sprang on him from a tree, and \"came back with his arm covered in bandages and throat completely wrapped, but he just shrugged it off.\"<ref>McCarthy, pg 579</ref>\n\nAs the animals frequently refused to make noise \"on cue\" (in particular, the baby elephants refused to trumpet inside populated areas), local Arusha game experts and zoo collectors were hired to do \"animal voice impersonations\" for the film.\n\nMich\u00e8le Girardon spoke no English when she was cast and, according to a July 1961 ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]'' magazine profile of the actress, she taught herself English while on the set.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=LIFE|date=21 July 1961|publisher=Time Inc|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ilQEAAAAMBAJ|page=80|access-date=January 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\nJohn Wayne wore a belt with the famed \"Red River D\" from his starring role in Hawkes' iconic [[Red River (movie)|Red River]] on its buckle, as he did in many of his movies. It can be clearly seen in the scene where Sean Mercer radios \"Arusha Control\" after The Indian is gored by the rhino at the start of the film, and again in the scene where Sonja (the cheetah) wanders into the bathroom while Dallas is bathing and introduces herself by licking Dallas and purring.\n\nThe memorable [[Henry Mancini]] tune \"[[Baby Elephant Walk]]\" was written for and first appeared in ''Hatari!''.<ref name=pc23>{{Pop Chronicles |23|4 |Henry Mancini}}</ref> Another memorable musical moment from the film is a duet of [[Stephen Foster]]'s \"[[Old Folks at Home]]\" (aka \"Swanee River\"), with Dallas on piano and Pockets on harmonica.\n\n==Reception==\n''Hatari!'' grossed $12,923,077 at the box office,<ref name=\"numbers\"/> $7&nbsp;million of which came from U.S. [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]].<ref>\"All-time top film grossers\", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 8 January 1964, pg 37.</ref> It was the [[1962 in film|7th highest-grossing film of 1962]].\n\n[[Jean-Luc Godard]] listed ''Hatari!'' as one of the best films of its year of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://letterboxd.com/thewizard/list/jean-luc-godard-cahiers-du-cinema-top-10s |title=Jean-Luc Godard, Cahiers du Cinema Top 10's, 1956-1965 |access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>\n\nThe film was recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2005: [[AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores]] \u2013 Nominated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/scores250.pdf |title= AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores Nominees |access-date=2016-08-06}}</ref>\n\n==Novelization==\nMichael Milner adapted Leigh Brackett's screenplay for the film into a paperback novel published by Pocket Books in 1962 as a tie-in to the movie. The cover of the novel features the movie poster of the rhino attacking the catching truck. The novel goes into more detail about some aspects of the animal-catching, particularly Pockets' rocket-net project, as well as about the pursuit of Brandy by Kurt, Chips, and Pockets. The book is a bit edgier than the film, but it is a fast read and faithful to the movie.
