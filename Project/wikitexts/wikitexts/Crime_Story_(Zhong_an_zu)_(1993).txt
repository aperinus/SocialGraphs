The film was released in Hong Kong on 24 June 1993.\n\nUnlike most Jackie Chan films, which feature a combination of [[Action film|action]] and [[comedy film|comedy]], ''Crime Story'' is mostly a serious film. The film is based on actual events surrounding the 1990 kidnapping of Chinese businessman [[Teddy Wang]].\n\n==Plot==\nInspector Eddie Chan of the [[Hong Kong Police Force#Crime Wing|Organised Crime and Triad Bureau]], who suffers from emotional stress after shooting several men in self-defense, is assigned to track down the kidnapped businessman Wong Yat-fei. The search takes him from Hong Kong to Taiwan, causing him to cross paths with some powerful mobsters. What complicates matters is that one of the kidnappers is operating within the police force, determined to stop Chan from succeeding. The relentlessly driven Chan finds himself fighting his personal demons at the same time he battles the seemingly unending wave of crime in the city.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jackie Chan]] as Inspector Eddie Chan\n*[[Kent Cheng]] as Detective Hung Ting-bong\n*[[Law Kar-ying]] as Wong Yat-fei\n*Puishan Au-yeung as Wong Yat-fei's wife\n*[[Blackie Ko]] as Captain Ko\n*[[Pan Lingling]] as Psychiatrist\n*[[Christine Ng]] as Lara\n*Chung Fat as Ng Kwok-wah\n*[[Ken Lo]] as Ng Kwok-yan\n*Wan Fat as Simon Ting\n*William Tuan as Superintendent Cheung\n*Wan Seung-lam as Yen Chi-sheng\n*[[Mars (actor)|Mars]] as bank robber (''uncredited'')\n*Chan Tat-kwong as bank robber (''uncredited'')\n*Johnny Cheung as Black Dog\n*Wong Chi-wai as Black Dragon (''uncredited'')\n*James Ha as kidnapper / Ting-bong's henchman\n*Yu Kwok-lok as kidnapper\n*Wong Yiu as kidnapper\n*Rocky Lai as Taiwanese gangster / restaurant owner\n*Jameson Lam as policeman at construction site\n*Leung Gam-san as data centre manager\n\n==Production==\nAccording to the book ''I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action'', written by Jackie Chan, Chan's legs were crushed after getting caught between two cars while filming the opening action scene.<ref name=\"I Am Jackie Chan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html|title=Jackie's Aches and Pains: It Only Hurts When I'm Not Laughing|author=Jackie Chan|author-link=Jackie Chan|publisher=[[Random House]]|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film is set and was filmed in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]] in 42 days from 9 July to 20 August 1992. The climactic scene, in which a building is decimated by explosions, was filmed in the deserted [[Kowloon Walled City]], which was scheduled for destruction at that time.\n\n[[Jet Li]] was originally considered to play the role of Inspector Eddie Chan. Eventually, Jackie Chan was interested in the role of Inspector Eddie Chan, and he got it.\n\n==Release==\n''Crime Story'' was released in Hong Kong on 24 June 1993.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=Crime Story |url=https://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=7699 |access-date=28 April 2022 |website=[[Hong Kong Movie Database]]}}</ref> In the Philippines, the film was released as ''Police Dragon'' by Moviestars Production on 19 January 1994.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grand Opening Today!|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=19940119&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|access-date=23 February 2021|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corp.|date=19 January 1994|page=21|quote=See How Hongkong And Taiwan Police Use The Latest Technology to Cruch [sic] One Of The Biggest Kidnap For Ransom Syndicates In History}}</ref>\n\nAfter the success of ''Rumble In The Bronx'', [[Miramax Films|Miramax]] wanted to release ''Crime Story'' next in theaters, until Jackie Chan advised against it, so Miramax released ''Police Story 3: Supercop'' (1992) instead.\nThe version was released on video and DVD on 18 July 2000 in the United States by Miramax was dubbed in English, although unlike most releases, it contained the original musical score.
