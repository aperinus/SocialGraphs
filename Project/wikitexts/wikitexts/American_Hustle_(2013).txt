She has improved his scams, posing as English aristocrat \"Lady Edith Greensly\". Irving loves Sydney, but is hesitant to leave his unstable and histrionic wife Rosalyn, fearing he will lose contact with his adopted son Danny. Rosalyn has also threatened to report Irving to the police if he leaves her. \n\n[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Richie DiMaso catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam, but offers to release them if Irving can line up four additional arrests. Richie believes Sydney is English, but has proof that her claim of aristocracy is fraudulent. She tells Irving she will manipulate Richie, distancing herself from Irving.\n\nIrving has a friend pretending to be a wealthy Arab sheikh looking for potential investments in America. An associate of Irving's suggests the sheikh do business with Mayor Carmine Polito of [[Camden, New Jersey]], who is trying to revitalize gambling in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], but has struggled to find investors. Carmine seems to have a genuine desire to help the area's economy and his constituents. \n\nRichie devises a plan to make Mayor Polito the target of a [[sting operation]], despite the objections of Irving and of Richie's boss, Stoddard Thorsen. Sydney helps Richie manipulate an FBI secretary into making an unauthorized wire transfer of $2 million. When Stoddard's boss, Anthony Amado, hears of the operation, he praises Richie's initiative, pressuring Stoddard to continue.\n\nCarmine leaves their meeting when Richie presses him to accept a cash bribe. Irving convinces him the sheikh is legitimate, expressing his dislike of Richie, and they become friends. Richie arranges for Carmine to meet the sheikh, and without consulting the others, has Mexican-American FBI agent Paco Hernandez play the sheikh, which displeases Irving. \n\nCarmine brings the sheikh to a casino party, explaining that mobsters are there, and that it is a necessary part of doing business. Irving is surprised to hear that [[American Mafia|Mafia]] boss Victor Tellegio, right-hand man to [[Meyer Lansky]], is present, and that he wants to meet the sheikh. Tellegio explains that the sheikh needs to become an American citizen, and that Carmine will need to expedite the process. Tellegio also requires a $10 million wire transfer to prove the sheikh's legitimacy.\n\nRichie confesses his strong attraction to Sydney, but becomes confused and aggressive when she drops her English accent and admits to being from [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]. Rosalyn starts an affair with mobster Pete Musane, whom she met at the party. She mentions her belief that Irving is working with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], causing Pete to threaten Irving, who promises to prove the sheikh's investment is real. \n\nIrving later confronts Rosalyn, who admits she told Pete and agrees to keep quiet, but wants a divorce. With Carmine's help, Richie and Irving videotape members of Congress receiving bribes. Richie assaults Stoddard in a fight over the money, and later convinces Amado that he needs the $10 million to get Tellegio, but gets only $2 million. A meeting is arranged at the offices of Tellegio's lawyer, Alfonse Simone, but Tellegio does not appear.\n\nIrving visits Carmine and admits to the scam, but says he has a plan to help him. He throws him out, and the loss of their friendship deeply upsets Irving. The federal agents inform Irving that their $2 million are missing, and that they have received an anonymous offer to return the money in exchange for Irving and Sydney's immunity and a reduced sentence for Carmine. \n\nIt is revealed that Alfonse Simone, with whom Richie had arranged the wire transfer, was a con man working with Irving and Sydney. Amado accepts the deal, and Stoddard removes Richie from the case, which ends his career. The Congressmen are prosecuted, and so is Carmine, who is sentenced to 18 months in prison. Irving and Sydney move in together and open a legitimate art gallery, while Rosalyn lives with Pete and shares custody of Danny with Irving.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Irving Rosenfeld (based on [[Mel Weinberg]])\n** Zachariah Supka as Young Irving Rosenfeld\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Sydney Prosser/Lady Edith Greensly (based on [[Evelyn Knight]])\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Richie DiMaso\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as Rosalyn Rosenfeld (based on Marie Weinberg)\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Mayor Carmine Polito (based on [[Angelo Errichetti]])\n* [[Louis C.K.]] as Stoddard Thorsen\n* [[Jack Huston]] as Pete Musane\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Paco Hernandez / Sheikh Abdullah\n* [[Elisabeth R\u00f6hm]] as Dolly Polito\n* Danny Corbo as Danny Rosenfeld\n* Sonny Corbo as Danny Rosenfeld\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Carl Elway\n* [[Alessandro Nivola]] as Anthony Amado\n* [[Paul Herman]] as Alfonse Simone\n* [[Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui]] as Irv's Sheik Plant\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Julius\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Brenda\n* [[Dawn Olivieri]] as Cosmo Girl\n* [[Erica McDermott]] as Carl Elway's Assistant\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Victor Tellegio (uncredited cameo)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1800241/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title = American Hustle (2013) - IMDb| website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{Anchor|Development|Pre-production}}\nThe film began as an [[Eric Warren Singer]] screenplay titled ''American Bullshit''.

The film does not attempt to directly document the events of Abscam. The names are changed, and the film begins with the on-screen message, \"Some of this actually happened\".<ref name=\"how much\">{{cite web|title=How Much of ''American Hustle'' Actually Happened?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/12/12/american_hustle_true_story_fact_and_fiction_in_christian_bale_jennifer_lawrence.html|first=Evan|last=Hughes|date=December 12, 2013|publisher=[[Slate.com]]}}</ref> Major departures from reality include:\n* In the film, Irving Rosenfeld begins a life of criminality when he smashes storefront windows as a child in order to provide more work for his father's glass-installation business. In real life, [[Mel Weinberg|Melvin Weinberg]] began working for his father only as an adult. He did smash windows at that point, and according to one article after Abscam was revealed, it was indeed done to shore up business for Weinberg's father.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mel Weinberg|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20078297,00.html|work=People|publisher=People|access-date=January 3, 2014|date=December 29, 1980}}</ref> A later report states that it was done at the behest of the local union, to punish businesses who used non-union glaziers.<ref name=\"the real story\" />\n* In the film, Camden Mayor Carmine Polito is shown as a selfless politician who gets involved in the scam only to provide jobs to his constituents; Irving feels so bad for Carmine that he engineers a reduced sentence for him. In reality, Camden mayor [[Angelo Errichetti]] had a reputation for committing crimes, despite being widely praised for caring about the people of Camden. During the Abscam operation, he offered to get the fake sheik into illegal businesses such as money counterfeiting and drug smuggling. Though Weinberg developed a fondness for Errichetti as a man who \"didn't beat around the bush\", he made no attempt to protect Errichetti from prosecution.<ref name=\"the real story\">{{cite news |title=The Real Story and Lesson of the Abscam Sting in 'American Hustle'|url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/17/the-real-story-and-lesson-of-the-abscam-sting-in-american-hustle.html |first=Jimmy |last=So |date=December 17, 2013 |website=[[The Daily Beast]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n* [[Evelyn Knight]], Weinberg's mistress on whom the character of Sydney Prosser is based, was involved in Weinberg's scams, though to a lesser extent than shown in the film; and she was not involved in Abscam.
