It was adapted by [[William Goldman]] from his 1974 [[Marathon Man (novel)|novel of the same title]] and stars [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Roy Scheider]], [[William Devane]] and [[Marthe Keller]]. In the film, \"Babe\" Levy, a graduate student (Hoffman), becomes embroiled in a plot by Nazi [[war criminal]] Christian Szell (Olivier) to retrieve stolen diamonds from a safe deposit box owned by Szell's dead brother. Babe becomes unwittingly involved due to his brother Doc's ([[Roy Scheider]]) dealings with Szell. It was a critical and box office success, with Olivier earning an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as Szell, the film's antagonist.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nThomas \"Babe\" Levy is a history Ph.D. student and an avid runner researching the same field as his father, H. V. Levy, who died by suicide after being investigated during the [[Joseph McCarthy]] era. Babe's brother, Henry \"Doc\" Levy, poses as an oil company executive, but is actually a government agent working for a secret agency headed by Commander Peter \"Janey\" Janeway. One of Doc's jobs is to serve as a diamond courier for the infamous [[Nazi war criminal]] Dr. Christian Szell, in return for the latter's assistance in tracking down other Nazi war criminals. Szell is known as ''der wei\u00dfe Engel'' (German for ''The White Angel'') due to his prominent mane of white hair. A wanted war criminal, Szell is ensconced in [[South America]] and is living off a large cache of diamonds which he had taken from Jews killed at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. The diamonds are kept inside a safe deposit box at a bank in New York City and are withdrawn as needed by his brother Klaus Szell. After Dr. Szell's brother Klaus is killed in a fit of road rage, Szell feels that he cannot trust anybody anymore and proceeds to try to have all of the diamond handlers and couriers murdered, including Doc himself.\n\nEscaping several murder attempts, Doc suspects that Szell will come to [[New York City]] to retrieve his valuable diamond collection. Doc comes to New York under the guise of a visit to Babe. Meanwhile, Babe and his new girlfriend, Elsa Opel, who claims to be from [[Switzerland]], are mugged by two men dressed in suits. When Doc takes Babe and Elsa to lunch, he tricks Elsa into revealing that she has been lying to Babe about her background. Though Doc suspects she may be connected to Szell, he tells Babe that she is seeking an American husband so that she can become a [[U.S. citizen]]. After Szell arrives in America, Doc confronts him, stating that he should not have involved Babe in these matters and that he himself is not to be trusted. Szell then takes Doc by surprise and stabs him with a blade concealed in his sleeve. Doc makes it back to Babe's apartment and dies.\n\nThe police interrogate Babe until government agents, led by Janeway, arrive. Janeway asks Babe what Doc told him before he died, and tells Babe that his brother was a U.S. government agent. Babe insists that his brother did not tell him anything, but Janeway is convinced Doc would not have struggled all the way to Babe's apartment without giving him vital information.\n\nBabe is later abducted from his apartment by the two men who mugged him in the park, and he is tortured by Szell using dentistry. During his torture, Babe is bombarded with questions, but he continues to deny any knowledge. Babe is then rescued by Janeway, who explains that Szell is in the U.S. to sell off his large cache of diamonds. Janeway presses Babe about Doc's dying words, but Babe still insists he knows nothing. Frustrated, Janeway reveals himself as a [[double agent]] and returns Babe to Szell. Still unable to extract anything from Babe, Szell drills into one of his healthy teeth. Babe eventually escapes, aided by his skills as a marathon runner.\n\nBabe phones Elsa, who agrees to meet him with a car. Arriving at her country home, Babe guesses that Elsa has set him up, forcing her to confess that the home was owned by Szell's deceased brother. Janeway and Szell's men arrive, but Babe takes Elsa hostage. Babe kills Szell's men as they attempt to shoot him. Janeway offers to let Babe kill Szell in revenge for Doc's death, if Janeway can have the diamonds. Babe agrees, but as he leaves, Elsa alerts him to Janeway's attempt to betray him and is fatally shot. Babe then shoots Janeway through the window, killing him.\n\nAttempting to determine the value of his diamonds, Szell visits an appraiser in the [[47th Street (Manhattan)#Diamond District|Diamond District]] in [[midtown Manhattan]]. A shop assistant who is a Holocaust survivor believes he recognizes Szell as a war criminal. After Szell hurriedly leaves the shop, an elderly Jewish woman also recognizes him. Trying to cross the street to get closer to Szell, the woman is hit by a taxi, causing a crowd to assemble and aid her. Amidst the confusion, the shop assistant appears again, directly confronting Szell, who slits the man's throat.\n\nSzell retrieves his diamonds but, as he attempts to leave, Babe forces him at gunpoint into a water-treatment facility two miles away in South Gate House, [[Central Park]]. Babe tells Szell that he can keep as many diamonds as he can swallow. Szell initially refuses, and Babe begins throwing the diamonds into the water. Szell relents and swallows one diamond, but then refuses to cooperate further. Szell releases the catch on his sleeve blade and tells Babe that both Babe's brother and father were weak, suggesting that Babe's father was some sort of spy like Doc, and that Szell had been involved with Babe's father's death. Babe throws the rest of the diamonds down the steps towards the water; Szell dives for them, but stumbles, and falls on his own knife blade, with his corpse falling over a railing and into the water. Babe heads out into Central Park, stopping to throw his gun into the reservoir.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Thomas Babington \"Babe\" Levy\n* [[Laurence Olivier]] as Dr. Christian Szell\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Agent Henry \"Doc\" Levy\n* [[William Devane]] as Commander Peter \"Janey\" Janeway\n* [[Marthe Keller]] as Elsa Opel\n* [[Fritz Weaver]] as Professor Biesenthal\n* [[Richard Bright (actor)|Richard Bright]] as Karl\n* [[Marc Lawrence]] as Erhardt\n* Allen Joseph as H.V.

Graphic insert shots from the torture scenes, which were filmed by Clark, were removed. Some photos, such as original lobby cards and stills, show Szell torturing Babe longer with dental instruments in the first torture scene and actual onscreen drilling of Babe's tooth in the second torture scene.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Bettencourt\n |first=Scott\n |title=Marathon Man\n |publisher=Film Score Monthly\n |url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/notes/marathon_man.html\n |access-date=11 July 2014\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020045516/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/NOTES/marathon_man.html\n |archive-date=20 October 2014\n |url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Stanley Kauffmann]] of [[The New Republic]] wrote-'While people said that the violence in Marathon Man was excessive, I was surprised: I had wriggled through that dental torture, but it hadn't seemed a pinnacle in a year during which I had seen two penises cut off and another penis nailed to a board\u2014in films from France and Japan'.<ref>{{cite book |title=Before My Eyes Film Criticism & Comment|last1=Kauffmann|first1=Stanley |publisher=Harper & Row Publishers |year=1979 |page=423}}</ref>\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nAn 8\u00bd-minute sequence was shot of Doc fighting with some men who kill a spy colleague of his. William Goldman speculated that the scene was cut because of its violence and called the cut \"grievous\" and to the detriment of the film.<ref name=bradey162>Bradey, John Joseph. ''The Craft of the Screenwriter: Interviews with Six Celebrated Screenwriters'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1981), p. 162.</ref> With the sequence missing, Doc's character seems to be less flawed than he really is.<ref name=bradey162 />\n\nIn the novel, Janeway and  Doc are homosexual lovers. This is handled subtly in the movie (when Doc arrives in Paris he calls Janeway on the phone and says \"Janie, I miss you. Get your ass over here (to the hotel room).\" In the book, their sexual relationship is not subtle at all and has Doc pining for Janeway at several points in the book.\n\nThe ending was rewritten by [[Robert Towne]]; it has been speculated that this was because Hoffman was unhappy with it.<ref name=bradey166>Bradey, p. 166.</ref> Goldman told an interviewer he thought the new, more famous ending was \"shit\" because it left out two important plot clarifications. The final confrontation between Babe and Szell, in particular, is changed: in the film, Babe \"spares\" Szell in a pump room, tries forcing him to swallow his diamonds and Szell then falls on his own retractable blade, dying. In the novel, Babe resolutely leads Szell to [[Central Park]] and shoots him multiple times, subsequently lecturing him. He then throws the diamonds away and is quietly led away by a policeman.<ref name=bradey166 />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Kerner, Aaron.
