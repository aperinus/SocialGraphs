Jackson]], [[Robert Carlyle]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Ricky Tomlinson]], [[Sean Pertwee]], [[Rhys Ifans]], [[Stephen Walters]] and [[Meat Loaf]]. The film follows the story of an American master chemist (Jackson) who heads to Britain to sell his formula for a powerful new drug. All does not go as planned and the chemist soon becomes entangled in a web of deceit.\n\nThe film premiered in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2001. It was released internationally under the name ''Formula 51'' in October 2002, where it grossed $14.4&nbsp;million, just over half of the budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Fifty first state ver2.jpg|thumb|220 px|Alternate poster and title for the film ''The Fifty First State'']]\nIn 1971, a policeman witnesses Elmo McElroy, a recent college graduate with a [[Academic degree|degree]], smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Due to his arrest and conviction, he is unable to find work as a [[Pharmacology|pharmacologist]]. In the present day, a drug lord called \"the Lizard\" calls a meeting of his colleagues, hoping to sell a new substance invented by Elmo. The meeting goes badly when Elmo, in a bid to escape from the Lizard's manipulation, blows up the building, killing everyone but the Lizard. Enraged, the Lizard contacts Dakota, a [[Contract killing|contract killer]], who previously killed the only witness in a case against the Lizard. Dakota initially refuses the hit, but accepts when the Lizard offers to clear her [[Problem gambling|gambling debts]] and give her a $250,000 bonus.\n\nFelix DeSouza, a local \"[[Fixer (person)|fixer]]\" in [[Liverpool]] has been sent by Leopold Durant, head of a local criminal organisation, to collect Elmo from [[Manchester Airport|Manchester airport]], in exchange for two tickets to a sold-out football match between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. On route to the airport Felix enters a pub full of Manchester United supporters and antagonises them before letting off a rocket flare inside; the United fans give chase but his friends rescue him in their car.\n\nElmo lands in Manchester, is collected by Felix and is taken to the meeting with Durant. At the meeting, Elmo pitches POS 51, a synthetic drug that can be produced with minimal facilities and is 51 times as potent as other drugs. A second opinion from Pudsey, Durant's [[chemist]], confirms Elmo's claims, and Durant gives him over a million dollars in bonds. Since it is $18&nbsp;million short of the agreed payment, Elmo refuses to sell.\n\nOn a roof across the street, Dakota is about to shoot Elmo in the head when the Lizard calls cancelling the hit; not wanting to kill Elmo until he has the formula. Instead of killing Elmo, she is to kill anyone who meets with him. She switches rifles to an automatic weapon and kills everyone but Elmo and Felix, who is shot in the buttocks. As Elmo and Felix leave the hotel, a gang of [[skinhead]]s who want the drug attack them. Elmo protects them with a golf club. Detective Virgil Kane and his partner Arthur arrive on the scene and give chase. They are soon lured into a game of [[Chicken (game)|chicken]] by Elmo, who escapes. Kane and Arthur return to the crime scene and Kane demands 50% of Durant's deal with McElroy. A miscommunication leads to Durant's death.\n\nFelix contacts a gun dealing club owner and drug distributor named Iki, promising him the formula for \u00a320&nbsp;million. As Elmo and Felix acquire the ingredients necessary for the drug's manufacture, all of which are [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter products]], the now-armed skinheads take them hostage. Elmo is content, as the skinheads claim they have a lab, though it turns out to be a broken-into animal testing facility. Elmo makes two batches of the drug; one blue and one red. He claims that the red pill is the stronger version, and after he takes one, the skinheads try it. While they are partying, waiting for the effect of the drug, in the next room Elmo spits out his red pill. He tells Felix it is a powerful [[laxative]]; Elmo and Felix leave after throwing rolls of toilet paper to the incapacitated skinheads.\n\nAt Iki's rave club, Elmo initiates his deal and delivers the drug to the waiting crowd. Kane and the police interrupt the deal and arrest Felix. When Dakota appears, she reveals that her real name is Dawn and that she and Felix were domestic partners. She abducts Elmo and leaves with him via the roof. Elmo overpowers her, suspending her over the edge of the roof. Having no choice, she strikes a deal with him and they escape Kane. Meanwhile, Kane blackmails Felix during a police [[interrogation]] and forces himself into the deal with Iki, which Felix sets up for him.\n\nFelix, Elmo and Dawn meet Iki in a private viewing box at the football match at [[Anfield]]. This time, the deal is interrupted by the Lizard, who shoots Iki dead and demands the formula to POS 51. The Lizard celebrates with a drink, as Elmo reveals that the drug is a [[placebo]] and POS stands for Power of Suggestion. Kane interrupts them as Elmo's cocktail, an explosive ingested by the Lizard, takes effect, killing the Lizard and showering everyone in blood. Kane is knocked [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] and arrested by Arthur, while the main three exit unscathed. Dawn and Felix happily settle down together, and Elmo purchases a castle once owned by the man who owned his ancestors.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Samuel L.

Jackson became a star.{{cn|reason=ref and timestamp needed|date=September 2022}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nScreenwriter [[Stel Pavlou]] came up with the idea for ''The 51st State'' in 1994 while studying at university in [[Liverpool]] and working in the kitchen's of The Brook Cafe at The Quiggins centre, loosely basing some of the characters on his friends. Pavlou described the idea of the film being based on Liverpool's history in the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] and transferring it to modern day in the form of the drug trade. Pavlou and his business partner Mark Aldridge showcased their idea at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in France which led to film development company [[Focus Films]] offering funding for development. Soon the film caught the eye of [[Samuel L. Jackson]], who eventually came on board as both a producer and star of the film.<ref>{{cite web |title=51st State (18) |url=http://www.viewbristol.co.uk/films/51st-state-film-review-2209.html |date=12 October 2001 |publisher=viewbristol.co.uk |access-date=3 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nOriginally Pavlou budgeted at around \u00a31&nbsp;million and intended to direct it himself. Due to difficulty getting funding Pavlou stepped aside and took a co-producer credit while the matter was being resolved. After five years ''The 51st State'' was finally budgeted at $28&nbsp;million, with financing coming from Canada and the UK via [[Alliance Atlantis]] and [[the Film Consortium]].<ref name=\"Production Notes\">{{cite web |title=Formula 51 Production Notes |url=http://www.cinema.com/articles/678/formula-51-production-notes.phtml |publisher=cinema.com |access-date=6 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nActor and film producer [[Samuel L. Jackson]] recommended Hong Kong director [[Ronny Yu]] to direct the film with belief that the film's overall style was suited to that of Yu's previous credits, such as his 1998 film ''[[Bride of Chucky]]''. With the roles of Elmo McElroy (Samuel L. Jackson) and Felix DeSouza ([[Robert Carlyle]]) both secured, producer Andras Hamori suggested [[Meat Loaf]] to play the antagonist. This was approved by director Yu, who called the idea a \"truly inspired piece of casting\".<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n\n====Locations====\nAlmost all of the film was shot on location in Liverpool<ref>[http://www.southportreporter.com/119/southportreporter119-6.shtml Southport Reporter]</ref> apart from the opening scene which was shot in Los Angeles, a driving scene which was filmed in [[Manchester]], and another scene which was filmed at [[Cholmondeley Castle]] in Cheshire.

Other famous Liverpool landmarks can be seen throughout the film in the background such as [[St George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]] and the [[Liver Building]].\n\nProduction designer Alan Macdonald used the film's production base in Boundary Street to build various sets for interior scenes, as well as a vast disused warehouse space in Blackstock Street.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on both [[VHS]] and DVD. The DVD version was released on 7 October 2002.
