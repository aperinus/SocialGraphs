It stars [[Cillian Murphy]] as a bicycle courier who awakens from a [[coma]] to discover the accidental release of a highly contagious, aggression-inducing [[virus]] has caused the [[Societal collapse|breakdown of society]]. [[Naomie Harris]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[Megan Burns]], and [[Brendan Gleeson]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nGarland took inspiration from [[George A. Romero]]'s [[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|''Night of the Living Dead'' film series]] and [[John Wyndham]]'s 1951 novel ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]'' for the film's post-apocalyptic story. Filming took place in various locations in the United Kingdom in 2001. The crew filmed for brief periods during early mornings and temporarily closed streets to capture recognisable and typically busy areas when they were deserted. [[John Murphy (composer)|John Murphy]] composed [[28 Days Later: The Soundtrack Album|an original soundtrack]] for the film, with other instrumental songs by [[Brian Eno]], [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] and other artists also being featured.\n\n''28 Days Later'' was released  on 1 November 2002 to critical acclaim and financial success. Grossing more than $82.7 million worldwide on its modest budget of $8 million, it became one of the most profitable horror films of 2002. Reviewers praised Boyle's direction, the cast's performances, Garland's screenplay, the atmosphere and soundtrack. Despite Boyle not considering it a [[zombie film]], ''28 Days Later'' is credited with reinvigorating the zombie genre of horror film and influencing a revival in the decade after its release, with its fast-running infected and character-driven drama.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /><ref name=\"Bloody-Disgusting\" /> Since its release, it has been featured in several \"best-of\" film lists and maintained a following, particularly amid the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in the 2020s.\n\nThe film was followed by 2007 sequel ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'', a 2007 [[graphic novel]] titled ''[[28 Days Later: The Aftermath]]'', which expands on the timeline of the outbreak, and a 2009 to 2011 comic book series titled ''[[28 Days Later (comics)|28 Days Later]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nA highly contagious, aggression-inducing [[virus]] called \"Rage\" is unleashed in Great Britain after an infected [[chimpanzee]] is freed from a laboratory in [[Cambridge]] by a group of [[Animal rights activism|animal liberation activists]]. It spreads rapidly and becomes an [[epidemic]], resulting in [[societal collapse]]. 28 days after the initial outbreak, [[bicycle courier]] Jim awakens from a [[coma]] in [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London, which has been deserted with signs of catastrophe. Jim is attacked by infected humans, but rescued by survivors Selena and Mark. At Jim's request, the group travels to his parents' house in [[Deptford]], where he learns that they committed suicide. That night, Mark gets a cut on his arm which is hit with infected blood during an attack, prompting Selena to kill him before he turns.\n\nJim and Selena encounter [[Hackney carriage|cab driver]] Frank and his daughter Hannah at [[Balfron Tower]], from whom they learn of a military broadcast offering protection at a blockade in [[Manchester]]. With supplies dwindling, Frank asks Jim and Selena to accompany him and Hannah to the blockade, which they accept. The group travels to Manchester in Frank's cab, but upon arriving, they find the blockade deserted. As the group struggles to plot their next move, Frank is infected when a drop of blood falls into his eye. The soldiers arrive shortly afterwards and kill Frank.\n\nThe remaining survivors are brought to a fortified mansion under the command of Major Henry West. However, the safety promised by the soldiers turns out to be ruse when West reveals to Jim that the broadcast was intended to lure female survivors into [[sexual slavery]] to repopulate the world. The soldiers attempt to kill Jim after he refuses to be complicit with their plan, but Jim escapes. After luring West away from the mansion, Jim releases Private Mailer, an infected soldier kept chained for observations, resulting in the deaths of West's men. Jim, Selena, and Hannah attempt to leave in Frank's cab, but West had snuck into the back seat and shoots Jim. Hannah retaliates by putting the cab in reverse, allowing Mailer to pull West through the rear window and kill him, while the three survivors drive off.\n\nAnother 28 days later, Jim recovers at a remote cottage in [[Cumbria]], where the infected are shown dying of starvation. As a [[Finland|Finnish]] fighter jet flies overhead, Jim, Selena, and Hannah unfurl a huge cloth banner spelling the word \"HELLO\". The three survivors optimistically watch the jet as the pilot spots them.\n\n===Alternate endings===\nThe DVD extras include three alternative endings, all of which conclude with Jim dying. One of these was filmed, which involved Jim dying of his gunshot wounds.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |date=2021-06-12 |title=The Original Ending Of 28 Days Later Was Far More Haunting |url=https://screenrant.com/28-days-later-movie-alternate-ending-darker/ |access-date=2022-03-27 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> In another, the outbreak is revealed to be a dream.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fish |first=Tom |date=2021-06-09 |title=30 movies with alternate endings |url=https://www.newsweek.com/movies-alternate-endings-1597525 |access-date=2022-03-27 |website=Newsweek |language=en}}</ref> The third, a more radical departure, was presented only in [[storyboard]]s; instead of Frank being killed by soldiers after being infected, the other survivors tie him up and discover a research laboratory at the blockade, where Jim undergoes a [[blood transfusion]] in order to save Frank.<ref name=\":1\" /> The U.S. cinematic release included one of the alternative endings after the film's credits in response to intense online debates over whether or not it was a more appropriate conclusion than the official ending.<ref>{{cite web |access-date=2 February 2008 |publisher=[[BBC]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3153077.stm |title=Plotting alternative film endings |date=15 August 2003}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of 28 Days Later characters}}{{Multiple image\n| image1            = Cillian Murphy-2014.jpg\n| caption1          = [[Cillian Murphy]]\n| image2            = Naomie Harris 2, 2012.jpg\n| caption2          = [[Naomie Harris]]\n| image3            = Brendan Gleeson.jpg\n| total_width       = 400\n| caption3          = [[Brendan Gleeson]]\n}}\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Jim\n* [[Naomie Harris]] as Selena\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Frank\n* [[Megan Burns]] as Hannah\n* [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Major Henry West\n* [[Noah Huntley]] as Mark\n* [[Stuart McQuarrie]] as Sergeant Farrell\n* [[Ricci Harnett]] as Corporal Mitchell\n* [[Leo Bill]] as Private Jones\n* [[Luke Mably]] as Private Clifton\n* Junior Laniyan as Private Bell\n*[[Ray Panthaki]] as Private Bedford\n* Sanjay Rambaruth as Private Davis\n* Marvin Campbell as Private Mailer\n\nAdditionally, Alex Palmer, Bindu De Stoppani, and [[Jukka Hiltunen]] portray the animal liberation activists, while [[David Schneider (actor)|David Schneider]] portrays a scientist at the laboratory. Christopher Dunne and Emma Hitching appear as Jim's parents. [[Toby Sedgwick]] plays an infected priest encountered by Jim.\n\nOn the DVD commentary, Boyle explains that with the aim of preserving the [[suspension of disbelief]], relatively unknown actors were cast in the film. Cillian Murphy had starred primarily in small independent films, while Naomie Harris had acted on British television as a child, and Megan Burns had only one previous film credit. However, Christopher Eccleston and Brendan Gleeson were well-known [[character actor]]s.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nEarly influences on Garland included the [[George Romero]] films ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968) and ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978), which he loved as a child but said that he had largely forgotten about the zombie genre until he played the video game ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' (1996), which reminded him how much he loved zombies after \"having not really encountered zombies for quite a while\".<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/zaki-hasan/interview-director-alex-g_b_7038618.html|title=INTERVIEW: Director Alex Garland on Ex Machina|work=HuffPost|first1=Zaki|last1=Hasan|date=10 April 2015|access-date=21 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn the [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], Boyle and Garland frequently call it a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] and [[horror film]], commenting on scenes that were quotation of [[George A. Romero]]'s [[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|''Dead'' trilogy]]. During the initial marketing of the film, Boyle tried to distance the film from such labels. Boyle identified [[John Wyndham (writer)|John Wyndham]]'s ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]'' as Garland's original inspiration for the story.<ref name=\"Guardian2\">{{cite news |author=Kermode, Mark |date=6 May 2007 |title=A capital place for panic attacks |work=Guardian News and Media Limited |location=London |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2073292,00.html |url-status=live |access-date=12 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513170940/http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0%2C%2C2073292%2C00.html |archive-date=13 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nFive months after the film was released in Europe, video game publisher [[NovaLogic]] hosted a [[graffiti]] competition in a cross-promotion with the game ''[[Devastation (video game)|Devastation]]''. The connection was mainly due to the similar theme of a devastated world. The prizes consisted of signed screenplays and posters along with DVDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novalogic.com/press.asp?ID=74 |title=DEVASTATION GONE GOLD |date=April 14, 2003 |access-date=October 1, 2022 |website=[[NovaLogic]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:London, United Kingdom (Unsplash mfbEp8lS1hA).jpg|thumb|250x250px|Busy areas of [[Central London]], including [[Westminster Bridge]], had to be filmed early in the morning or while the crew briefly closed streets for the film's opening sequence.]] The film features scenes set in normally bustling parts of [[London]] such as [[Westminster Bridge]], [[Piccadilly Circus]], [[Horse Guards Parade]] and [[Oxford Street]]. To depict these locations as desolate, the film crew closed off sections of street for minutes at a time, usually in early morning before sunrise on Sundays and would have typically around 45 minutes after dawn, to shoot the locations devoid of traffic and members of the public\u2014to minimise disruption. Portions of the film were shot on a [[Canon XL1S|Canon XL1]] [[digital video]] (DV) camera.<ref>{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Bankston |url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/july03/sub/index.html |title=Anthony Dod Mantle, DFF injects the apocalyptic 28 Days Later with a strain of digital video |work=TheASC.com |date=1 July 2003 |access-date=1 May 2007}}</ref> DV cameras are much smaller and more manoeuvrable than traditional film cameras, which would have been impractical on such brief shoots. The scenes of the [[M1 motorway]] devoid of traffic were also filmed within very limited time periods. A mobile police roadblock slowed traffic sufficiently, to leave a long section of carriageway empty while the scene was filmed. The section of the motorway depicted in the film is near [[Milton Keynes]], Buckinghamshire, around 150 miles southeast of Manchester.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nigel|first=Freestone|title=The Ultimate British Roads and Motorways Quiz Book: 200 Questions on Road and Motorway History|publisher=Andrews UK|year=2013}}</ref> For the London scene where Jim walks by the overturned double-decker bus, the film crew placed the bus on its side and removed it when the shot was finished, all within 20 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=28 Days Later : About The Shoot|url=https://www.cinema.com/articles/1468/28-days-later-about-the-shoot.phtml|access-date=22 March 2021|website=cinema.com}}</ref> Much of the filming took place prior to the [[September 11th attacks]] and in the audio commentary, Boyle notes the parallel between the \"missing persons\" flyers seen at the beginning of the film and similar flyers posted in New York City in the wake of the attacks.
