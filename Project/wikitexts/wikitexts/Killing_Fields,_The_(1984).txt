It was directed by [[Roland Joff\u00e9]] and produced by [[David Puttnam]] for his company [[Goldcrest Films]]. [[Sam Waterston]] stars as Schanberg, [[Haing S. Ngor]] as Pran, [[Julian Sands]] as [[Jon Swain]], and [[John Malkovich]] as [[Al Rockoff]]. The adaptation for the screen was written by [[Bruce Robinson]]; the [[The Killing Fields (album)|musical score]] was written by [[Mike Oldfield]] and orchestrated by [[David Bedford]].\n\nThe film was a success at the box office and an instant hit with critics. At the [[57th Academy Awards]] it received seven [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]; it won three, most notably [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Haing S. Ngor]], who had no previous acting experience, as well as [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]]. At the [[38th British Academy Film Awards]], it won eight [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTAs]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] for Ngor.\n\nIn 1999 the [[British Film Institute]] voted ''The Killing Fields'' the [[BFI Top 100 British films|100th greatest British film of the 20th century]]. In 2016 British film magazine ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' ranked it number 86 in their list of the 100 best British films.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 100 best British films|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/100britishfilms/|website=Empireonline.com|date=29 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. The current summary is 695 words. -->\nIn 1973 [[Phnom Penh]], the [[Khmer National Armed Forces|Cambodian national army]] wages a [[Cambodian Civil War|civil war]] with the communist [[Khmer Rouge]] group. [[Dith Pran]], a Cambodian journalist and interpreter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', awaits the arrival of reporter [[Sydney Schanberg]] at the city's airport, but leaves suddenly. Schanberg takes a cab to his hotel where he meets up with photographer [[Al Rockoff]]. Pran meets Schanberg later and tells him that an [[B-52 Stratofortress|American B-52]] has allegedly bombed [[Neak Leung]]. After Schanberg and Pran go to the town and confirm the allegation, they are arrested when they try to photograph the execution of two Khmer Rouge operatives. They are eventually released and Schanberg is furious when the international press corps arrives with the U.S. Army.\n\nTwo years later, in 1975, the Phnom Penh [[Operation Eagle Pull|embassies are evacuated]] in anticipation of the Khmer Rouge's arrival. Schanberg secures evacuation for Pran's family, but Pran insists on staying behind to help Schanberg. The Khmer Rouge move into the capital, ostensibly in peace. During a parade through the city, Schanberg and Rockoff are met by a detachment of the Khmer Rouge, who immediately arrest them. The group is taken to a back alley where prisoners are being held and executed. Pran, unharmed because he is a Cambodian civilian, negotiates to spare his friends' lives, and the group retreats to the French embassy. The Khmer Rouge orders all Cambodian citizens in the embassy to be handed over, to which the fearful ambassador complies. Knowing that Pran will be imprisoned or killed, Rockoff and fellow photographer [[Jon Swain]] try to forge a British passport for Pran, but the deception fails when Pran's image on the passport photo disappears, as they lack adequate [[photographic fixer]]. Pran is turned over to the Khmer Rouge and forced to live under their totalitarian regime.\n\nSeveral months after returning to [[New York City]], Schanberg launches a personal campaign to locate Pran; he writes letters to several charities and maintains close contact with Pran's family in San Francisco. In Cambodia, Pran has become a forced labourer under the Khmer Rouge's \"[[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]]\" policy, a return to the agrarian ways of the past. Pran is also forced to attend [[Propaganda|propagandist]] classes where many undergo [[Political indoctrination|re-education]]. As [[intellectual]]s are [[Forced disappearance|made to disappear]], Pran feigns simple-mindedness. Eventually, he tries to escape and stumbles upon one of the [[Pol Pot]] regime's [[Killing Fields]] before he is recaptured. In 1976, Schanberg is awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his coverage of the Cambodian conflict, and he tells the audience that half the recognition for the award belongs to Pran. Rockoff confronts Schanberg and harshly accuses him of not doing enough to locate Pran and for using his friend to win the award. Although Schanberg initially defends his efforts, he ultimately admits that Pran stayed because of what Schanberg wanted.\n\nPran is assigned to the leader of a different prison compound, a man named Phat, and charged mostly with tending to Phat's young son. Pran continues to behave as an uneducated peasant, despite several attempts by Phat to catch him in his deception. Phat begins to trust Pran and asks him to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed. During the Khmer Rouge's [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|border war with Vietnam]], Pran discovers that Phat's son has American money and a map leading to safety. When Phat tries to stop the younger Khmer Rouge officers from killing several of his comrades, he is ignominiously shot. In the confusion, Pran escapes with four other prisoners and they begin a long trek through the jungle with Phat's son. The group later splits and three of them head in a different direction; Pran continues following the map with the fourth man. However, Pran's companion activates a hidden [[land mine]] while holding the boy. As Pran pleads with the man to give him the boy, the mine goes off, killing the pair. Pran continues through the jungle alone until he eventually finds a [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] refugee camp near the border of [[Thailand]]. In the United States, Schanberg learns that Pran is alive and safe, and reunites with Pran at the Red Cross camp. Pran assures Schanberg of his forgiveness as the two embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Sam Waterston]] as [[Sydney Schanberg]]\n* [[Haing S.

He gave me Bruce Robinson's script, which was enormous, but it was so full of passion and energy I couldn't put it down. I'd heard about Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge, but didn't know much until I read it. I wrote to David saying that whoever made the film would have to be careful because it wasn't just a war story: it was about human connection, how friendships are born and what they do to us. I didn't hear from him for six months, then we bumped into one another and he said he'd interviewed most of the directors in the world \u2013 including some very big names who would make the studios happy \u2013 but no one had really understood it. \"You're the only man who has,\" he said.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/10/how-we-made-the-killing-fields-roland-joffe-julian-sands|title=Roland Joffe and Julian Sands: how we made The Killing Fields|first=Ryan|last=Gilbey|date=10 November 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=27 January 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the same interview actor [[Julian Sands]] said:\n\n<blockquote>Roland's audition process was extraordinary. I was 24 and I've never come across anything as rigorous since. He was looking to put together a troupe of actors without much film experience, because he wanted the freshness of everything to resonate with us. He would gather lots of us in his office to improvise scenes. After about a month, he had a group he found interesting. John Malkovich, Sam Waterston and Haing S. Ngor weren't subject to that, but their meetings with him were still pretty intense. A lot was made of the fact that Haing hadn't acted before, but John put it differently: he said Haing had been acting his whole life \u2013 you had to be a pretty good actor to survive the Khmer Rouge.<ref name=\"auto\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Box office==\n[[Goldcrest Films]] invested \u00a38,419,000 in the film and received \u00a310,664,000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My indecision is final|first1=Jake|last1= Eberts |first2=Terry|last2=Illott|year=1990 |publisher=Faber and Faber|page=656}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''The Killing Fields'' holds a 93% rating at the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 40 reviews, with the consensus; \"Artfully composed, powerfully acted, and fueled by a powerful blend of anger and empathy, ''The Killing Fields'' is a career-defining triumph for director Roland Joff\u00e9 and a masterpiece of cinema.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/killing_fields|title=The Killing Fields|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=21 August 2021}}</ref> Critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'': \"The film is a masterful achievement on all the technical levels\u2014it does an especially good job of convincing us with its Asian locations\u2014but the best moments are the human ones, the conversations, the exchanges of trust, the waiting around, the sudden fear, the quick bursts of violence, the desperation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19840101/REVIEWS/401010352/|title=The Killing Fields Movie Review (1984) \u2013 Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|access-date=27 January 2018}}{{Dead link|date=December 2021}}</ref> [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] of the [[National Review]] wrote- \"For all its flaws The Killing Fields is an important, indeed necessary, film\".<ref>{{cite book |title=John Simon on Film: Criticism 1982\u20132001|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=Applause Books |year=2005 |page=75}}</ref>\n\nThe film has been criticized by some who lived through the actual events.
