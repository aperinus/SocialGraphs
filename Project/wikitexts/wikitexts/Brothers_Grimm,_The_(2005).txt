The film stars [[Matt Damon]], [[Heath Ledger]] and [[Lena Headey]] in an exaggerated and fictitious portrait of the [[Brothers Grimm]] as traveling [[Confidence trick|con-artists]] in French-occupied Germany, during the early 19th century. The brothers eventually encounter a genuine [[fairy tale]] curse which requires courage instead of their usual bogus [[exorcism]]s. Supporting characters are played by [[Peter Stormare]], [[Jonathan Pryce]] and [[Monica Bellucci]].\n\nIn February 2001, [[Ehren Kruger]] sold his [[spec script]] to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). With Gilliam's hiring as director, the script was rewritten by Gilliam and [[Tony Grisoni]] but the [[Writers Guild of America]] refused to credit them for their work. MGM eventually dropped out as distributor but decided to co-finance ''The Brothers Grimm'' with [[Dimension Films]] and [[Summit Entertainment]], while Dimension took over distribution duties.\n\nThe film was shot in the [[Czech Republic]]. Gilliam often had feuds with brothers [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]], which caused the original theatrical release date to be delayed nearly ten months. ''The Brothers Grimm'' was finally released on 26 August 2005 with mixed reviews and grossed $105.3 million at the worldwide box office.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nWill and Jake Grimm are traveling [[confidence trick|con artists]] who use Jake's knowledge of folklore to fool people into paying them to kill monsters in [[Great French War|French-occupied]] Germany during the early 19th century. In [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]] they \"kill\" a witch's ghost, after tricking the village. Italian torturer Cavaldi captures the two and takes them to the French General Delatombe. Delatombe forces them to solve a mystery: the girls of the small village of Marbaden are going missing and the villagers are convinced that supernatural forces are responsible. The Brothers are charged with finding out who is responsible, under the assumption that it is the work of con artists like themselves. They soon discover that it is the work of a real supernatural force, a 500-year-old, [[Thuringia]]n Queen stealing young girls to restore her beauty.\n\nLong ago, King [[Childeric I]] came to the forest to build a city while his Queen experiments with [[black magic]] stolen from the pagan locals to gain eternal life. The [[Bubonic plague]] comes and she builds a high tower to avoid it, while her husband and everyone below her perishes. She did not understand the Plague was carried by wind and soon rotted away as she decayed over the years. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty to go along with it. Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more. She needs to drink the blood of twelve young women to regain her beauty; ten have already been reported missing.\n\nThe queen is working an enchantment to regain her beauty with the aid of her [[werewolf]] huntsman with a magic axe, crow familiars and various creatures in the forest. The Brothers Grimm, with the help of Angelika, a knowing huntress from the village and sister to two of the missing girls and Cavaldi discover her tower in the woods. After another girl goes missing and all his men are killed by the forest, Cavaldi takes the Grimms and Angelika back to Delatombe. Because they have failed, Cavaldi may kill both of the Grimms but after convincing Delatombe that the magic in the forest is caused by German rebels, he sends them back, while Cavaldi stays behind with Angelika in the village. Jake gets into the tower but another girl named Sasha is captured, despite Angelika and Cavaldi's efforts to save her.\n\nIn the tower, Jake notices twelve crypts in which the victims must lay. When Sasha's body comes up from a well, the werewolf takes her to a tomb. After rescuing Sasha and taking the wolfman's magic axe, the Grimms return to the village. The magic axe is the only thing of which the trees in the forest are afraid. Delatombe captures the Brothers and believes them to be frauds. French soldiers begin burning down the forest and Cavaldi represses his sympathy for the brothers but they are eventually saved by Angelika. The werewolf is revealed to be Angelika's father, who is under the Queen's command by a spell. Angelika is drowned by her father, becoming the twelfth victim. The Brothers reach the tower while the Queen breathes an ice wind which puts out the forest fire. Delatombe notices that the Grimms have escaped and goes after them with Cavaldi. When Cavaldi refuses to kill the Grimms, Delatombe shoots him but is impaled by Will.\n\nThe [[climax (narrative)|climax]] ensues with The Mirror Queen's death, caused by Jake shattering the enchanting mirror in the tower. The werewolf transforms into Angelika's father (the woodsman) and destroys the rest of the mirror by jumping out of the window with it and Will, who was trying to destroy the werewolf at all costs. Outside, Cavaldi seems to have survived, having donned the Grimm's faux-magic armor while the tower falls apart, with Jake surviving by using the Queen's mattresses. Jake awakens Angelika with a kiss of true love at Cavaldi's urging, which in turn resurrects the other eleven girls and Will. With the menace gone and their daughters returned to them, the villagers of Marbaden celebrate and give their heart-felt thanks to the Brothers Grimm. Cavaldi stays in the village and joins the villagers for the feast. The Grimms decide to pursue a new profession, presumably writing fairy tales.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Wilhelm Grimm|Will Grimm]].

So start being alone!\" An Interview with Terry Gilliam''], Senses of Cinema, no. 53, 2009. Retrieved 25 April 2010</ref> With regards to the Weinsteins also producing [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002), Gilliam stated: \"Marty [Scorsese] said almost the exact same quote I said, without us knowing it: 'They took the joy out of filmmaking.'\"<ref name=\"sensesofcinema.com\" />\n\n=== Visual effects ===\n[[Post-production]] was severely delayed when Gilliam disagreed with the Weinsteins over the [[final cut privilege]]. In the meantime, the conflict lasted so long that Gilliam had enough time to shoot another feature film, ''[[Tideland (film)|Tideland]]''. To create the visual effects, Gilliam awarded the shots to Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio he founded in the late-1970s with [[visual effects supervisor]] Kent Houston. However, two months into filming, Houston said that Peerless \"ran into a number of major issues with ''The Brothers Grimm'' and with the Weinstein Brothers\". He continued that \"the main problem was the fact that the number of effects shots had dramatically increased, mainly because of issues that arose during shooting with the physical effects.\"<ref name=soft/> Meanwhile, the Queen's chamber inside the tower was actually built by the Art Department as 2 sets. One set was resplendent and new while the other was old and decrepit. The sets were joined to each other by the central mirror, a piece of transparent glass giving the illusion that a single set was reflected and used to create the effect.\n\nThere were originally to be about 500 effect shots, but it increased to 800. The post-production conflict between Gilliam and the Weinsteins also gave enough time for Peerless to work on another film, ''[[The Legend of Zorro]]''. Four different creatures were required for [[computer animation]]: a Wolfman, a mud creature, the Mirror Queen, and a living tree. John Paul Docherty, who headed the digital visual effects unit, studied the animation of the computer-generated [[Morlock]]s in ''[[The Time Machine (2002 film)|The Time Machine]]'' for the Wolfman. Docherty depicted the Morlocks \"as a nice mix between human and animal behaviors\".<ref name=\"soft\" /> The death of The Mirror Queen was the most complex effect of the film. In the sequence, the Queen turns into hundreds of shards of glass and shatters. With [[Rendering (computer graphics)|computerized rendering]], this could not happen, as the 3D volume of the body suddenly turns into 2D pieces of glass. The problem was eventually solved due to sudden advances that occurred with [[Softimage XSI]] software.<ref name=soft>{{cite news | last =Bielik| first=Alain| url =https://www.awn.com/vfxworld/brothers-grimm-gilliam-fairy-tale | title = The Brothers Grimm: A Gilliam Fairy Tale | publisher=[[Animation World Network]] | date = 25 August 2005 | access-date = 25 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe original theatrical release date was due in November 2004 before being changed many times; the dates had been moved to February 2005,<ref name=Nov/> 29 July,<ref>{{cite news | author = Gabriel Snyder | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117917393 | title = Studios play summer shuffle. . .again | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 3 February 2005 | access-date = 8 December 2008}}</ref> 23 November,<ref name=Nov>{{cite news | author = Dana Harris; Gabriel Snyder | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117909533 | title = Miramax pushing pause button | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 24 August 2004 | access-date = 8 December 2008}}</ref> and finally 26 August.
