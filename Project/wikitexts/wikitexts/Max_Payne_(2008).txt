It was written by Beau Thorne and directed by [[John Moore (director)|John Moore]]. The film stars [[Mark Wahlberg]] in the [[title role]] as [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]], [[Mila Kunis]] as [[Mona Sax]], [[Ludacris]] as Jim Bravura, and [[Beau Bridges]] as B.B. Hensley. The film revolves around [[revenge]], centering on the titular character, a New York police detective, as he journeys through New York City's criminal underworld while trying to learn the truth behind the murder of his wife and child.\n\nFilming took place between March and May 2008.  Extensive [[visual effects]] were used in many scenes throughout the film. ''Max Payne'' was released on October 16, 2008 in [[Australia]], one day prior to the [[United States]] release date. The film received generally negative reviews, and grossed $85 million against a production budget of $35 million.\n\n==Plot==\nMax Payne is a detective assigned to the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] [[Cold case (criminology)|Cold Case]] Unit. He lost his wife Michelle and infant daughter Rose in a horrific murder; since that day, Max has been consumed by the desire to find his family's killer. He comes under suspicion from the NYPD when Natasha, an acquaintance of one of Max's informants, is brutally murdered and Max's wallet (which she had stolen) is found at the crime scene. Max's former partner, Alex Balder is slain in his home after informing Max of a possible connection between Natasha's death and his family's murder. Max is framed as a murderer, and Lt. Bravura of Internal Affairs is tasked with bringing him in.\n\nMax and Mona Sax, a freelance assassin and Natasha's sister, visit Natasha's tattoo parlor, where the [[tattoo artist]] reveals the meaning behind Natasha's tattoo: it represents the wings of a [[Valkyrie]], which, in [[Norse mythology]], are creatures that decide the fate of warriors in battle. Max goes to secretly take some of Michelle's belongings out of storage and finds that documents from when she worked at the Aesir Corporation, a major pharmaceutical manufacturer, have gone missing. Max interrogates Michelle's former supervisor, Jason Colvin in his office at Aesir and learns that Michelle was involved with the development of Valkyr, a drug that the company produced under military contract in an attempt to create super-soldiers. Unfortunately, only a few subjects showed positive results; the rest saw hallucinations and eventually went insane, forcing Aesir to terminate the project and cover up their involvement. Jason agrees to testify against his employers, as long as Max can protect him. Max agrees, but then SWAT officers (Aesir contractors in disguise) raid the office, killing Jason and attracting Bravura's attention.\n\nAfter an intense gunfight, Max escapes with the evidence and shows Mona a video explaining the Valkyr project and featuring Jack Lupino, a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] who was one of Aesir's successful test subjects. Lupino explains in the video that while taking the drug, he feels invincible, and suffers none of the side effects. Max confronts Lupino, now a powerful gangster involved with the trafficking of Valkyr as a [[designer drug]], at his warehouse hideout, and the two men fight until Lupino gains the upper hand. Max's defeat appears certain until B.B. - Aesir's head of security and a father figure to Max - arrives and shoots Lupino dead. He then has Max knocked out and brought to the city docks.\n\nB.B. explains that he has been secretly selling Valkyr for personal profit and admits to killing Michelle after she found incriminating evidence that could have exposed him. He tries to drown Max in a faked suicide, but Max breaks free and dives into the icy river. He almost drowns, but hears the voice of his wife telling him it is not yet time for him to die. He swims to shore and, to prevent [[hypothermia]], consumes vials of Valkyr stuffed in his pockets by B.B., which causes him to see intense hallucinations but also makes him nigh-invincible. Max follows B.B. back to the Aesir Cooperation's headquarters. Assisted by Mona, he shoots his way through the building's security, eventually confronting and killing B.B. on the building's [[helipad]]. His vengeance complete, he falls to his knees, ready to die. He sees a vision of his wife and child smiling at him, and suddenly comes to, as the sun cuts through the clouds and a SWAT team surrounds him.\n\nA post-credits scene shows Max and Mona in a bar. Mona shows Max a newspaper with Aesir CEO Nicole Horne's picture on the front.  Max and Mona then look at one another with understanding and renewed purpose.\n\n==Cast==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|The minute I played the game I saw Mark.

Soho FX then blended the thousands of shots into the other footage during post production.<ref name=vfxworld/>\n\nA contest was held between visual effects teams to see who could create the best drug induced hallucinations. A reel was shot from actual set locations, it also included footage in front of a green screen with a stand in for Wahlberg.  The reel was then sent to ten different teams where Canadian company Spin created the best demo reel. To win Spin changed the falling snow into burning embers over a matte New York skyline painting.  During the climactic hallucination scene, the entire room was to be torn apart from the ceiling down around Max. A camera on a track circled Max and Spin later \"recreated the ceiling in CG, so it could break away and reveal the Valkyrie world above.\"<ref name=vfxworld/>\n\nMoore gave the approval on Valkyrie designed by illustrators Chris Roswarne and Rob McCallum. As a point of reference and to limit the use of CG a Valkyrie suit and make up were worn by performer Mako Hindy.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> Moore \"wanted the Valkyries to have a slow motion quality to them, almost as if they were underwater.\"<ref name=vfxworld/> During the 15 weeks of [[post-production]] the Valkyries were further developed by Spin to support this.
