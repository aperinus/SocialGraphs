''Boyz n the Hood'' follows Tre Styles (Gooding Jr.), who is sent to live with his father Furious Styles (Fishburne) in [[South Central Los Angeles]], surrounded by the neighborhood's booming gang culture. The film's title is a [[double entendre]]: a play on the term [[Coming of age|boyhood]] and a reference to the 1987 [[Eazy-E]] [[Boyz-n-the-Hood|rap song of the same name]], written by Ice Cube.\n\nSingleton initially developed the film as a requirement for application to film school in 1986 and sold the script to [[Columbia Pictures]] upon graduation in 1990. During writing, he drew inspiration from his own life and from the lives of people he knew and insisted he direct the project. Principal photography began in September 1990 and was filmed on location from October to November 1990. The film is notable for featuring breakout roles for Ice Cube, Gooding Jr., Chestnut, and Long.\n\n''Boyz n the Hood'' premiered in Los Angeles on July 2, 1991 and was theatrically released in the United States ten days later. The film became a critical and commercial success, praised for its emotional weight, acting, and writing. It grossed $57.5 million in North America and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] at the [[64th Academy Awards]], making Singleton [[List of Academy Award records|the youngest person]] and the first African American to be nominated for Best Director.\n\nThe film was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/133/year/1991.html |title=Boyz n the Hood |access-date=August 9, 2009|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]}}</ref> In 2002, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |publisher=[[National Film Preservation Board]]|access-date=July 17, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Adds 25 Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-02-176/librarian-of-congress-adds-25-films-to-national-film-registry/2002-12-17/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1984, ten-year-old Tre Styles lives with his single mother, Reva Devereaux, in [[Inglewood, California]]. After Tre gets into a fight at school, his teacher calls Reva and says that although Tre is intelligent, he is immature and lacks respect. Frightened about Tre's future, Reva sends him to live in the [[Crenshaw, Los Angeles|Crenshaw]] neighborhood of [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] with his father, Furious Styles, from whom she hopes Tre will learn life lessons. In Crenshaw, Tre reunites with his childhood friends Darrin \"Doughboy\" Baker, Doughboy's half-brother Ricky, and their friend Chris. That night, Tre hears Furious shooting at a burglar. Furious calls the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], and two officers arrive an hour later. The white officer is civil, while the black one treats Furious with contempt. The next day, Tre and Furious arrive home and see Doughboy and Chris being arrested for stealing.\n\nSeven years later, a welcome home party is held for Doughboy, now a [[Crips]] member, following his release from prison. Also at the party are Chris, now in a wheelchair from a gunshot wound, \"Dookie\", and \"Monster\". Ricky, now a star [[running back]] at [[Crenshaw High School]], lives with his mother Brenda, girlfriend Shanice, and their toddler son. Meanwhile, Tre has grown into a responsible teenager who hopes to attend college with his girlfriend, Brandi. Their relationship is troubled over Tre's desire to have sex, while Brandi wants to wait until marriage.\n\nLater, during a street racing gathering, Ricky is provoked by Ferris, a [[Bloods]] member. In defense of Ricky, Doughboy brandishes his .45 ACP handgun, leading to an argument between the gangs. After they leave, Tre and Ricky are pulled over by an LAPD patrol; the lead officer, Coffey, is the same officer who responded to the burglary seven years earlier. Coffey holds his gun at Tre's throat, threatening him. Distraught, Tre goes to Brandi's house, where he has a breakdown. After she comforts him, they have sex for the first time.\n\nThe next afternoon, Ricky has a fight with Doughboy, with Brenda taking Ricky's side and berating Doughboy. Afterward, Brenda asks Ricky to run an errand and Tre accompanies him to a nearby drugstore. After they depart, a mailman delivers a letter with Ricky's [[SAT]] results. After leaving the store, Ricky and Tre see Ferris and the Bloods driving around the neighborhood and cut through back alleys to avoid them before splitting up. As they walk in separate directions, the Bloods drive close to Ricky and one of them fatally guns him down. Doughboy, who realized Tre and Ricky were in trouble when he saw the car circling the block, is distraught over Ricky's death and helps Tre carry Ricky's corpse home. Devastated emotionally, Brenda and Shanice blame Doughboy, who unsuccessfully tries to comfort them. Later, Brenda sobs over Ricky's test results, discovering he scored 710, enough to qualify for the [[University of Southern California|USC]] scholarship.\n\nAngered and distraught, the remaining boys vow vengeance on the Bloods. Furious finds Tre preparing to take his gun but convinces him to abandon his plans for revenge. However, Brandi and Furious catch Tre sneaking out to join Doughboy. Later that night, as the gang drives around the city, Tre asks to be let out of the car and returns home, realizing that his father was right. Doughboy finds the Bloods at a fast-food restaurant, and Monster shoots at them through the parking lot, killing one and wounding the other two. Doughboy gets out of his car and kills Ferris and the other wounded gang member, avenging Ricky's death. Later from that evening, after coming home, Furious confronts Tre about avenging Ricky's death as they walk into their bedrooms with no words exchanged.\n\nThe next morning, Doughboy visits Tre, understanding Tre's reasons for abandoning the gang. Doughboy knows he will face retaliation for killing Ferris, and accepts the consequences of his crime-ridden life. He questions why American media \"don't know, don't show, or don't care about what's going on in the hood.\" He says that he has no brothers left after Ricky's death, but is embraced by Tre, who says Doughboy \"still got one brother left.\" Doughboy then walks away, pouring out his liquor.\n\nThe epilogue text reveals that Ricky was buried the next day, Doughboy was murdered two weeks later, and Tre later goes to college with Brandi in [[Atlanta]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Jason \"Tre\" Styles III (age 17)\n** Desi Arnez Hines II as Tre (age 10)\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Reva Devereaux\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Jason \"Furious\" Styles Jr.\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Darrin \"Doughboy\" Baker (age 17)\n** Baha Jackson as Doughboy (age 10)\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Ricky Baker (age 17)\n** Donovan McCrary as Ricky (age 10)\n* [[Nia Long]] as Brandi (age 17)\n** Nicole Brown as Brandi (age 10)\n* [[Tyra Ferrell]] as Brenda Baker\n* Redge Green as Chris \"Little Chris\" (age 17)\n** Kenneth A.
