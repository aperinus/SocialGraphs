The plot follows Barden University's all-girl [[a cappella]] group, the Barden Bellas, as they compete against another a cappella group from their college to win Nationals.

It is the first film in the [[Pitch Perfect (franchise)|film series]] and was followed by two sequels, ''[[Pitch Perfect 2]]'' (2015) and ''[[Pitch Perfect 3]]'' (2017).\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the 2011 [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella|ICCA]] Finals at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], Barden University's all-female [[a cappella]] group, the Barden Bellas, lose to their all-male rival group, the Barden Treblemakers, due to junior member Aubrey Posen's vomiting onstage in the middle of her solo. Four months later, aspiring [[DJ]] Beca Mitchell is a freshman at Barden University at the insistence of her father, a professor at the university, despite having no desire to attend college, instead spending her time making [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] mixes of songs. She gets an internship at the school radio station, where she gets to know fellow freshman Jesse Swanson.\n\nAt the university's activities fair, Beca is invited to join the Bellas by seniors and current co-leaders Aubrey and Chloe Beale, but she declines. Later, Chloe hears Beca singing in the shower, convincing her to audition. Although late for the audition, Chloe allows her to perform for them anyway. She auditions with a rendition of \"[[Cups (song)|Cups (When I'm Gone)]]\", getting her into the Bellas along with the tough Cynthia Rose Adams, the flirtatious Stacie Conrad, the unusually quiet Lilly Onakuramara, the bubbly Jessica Smith, the alto Ashley Jones, the comedic Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart, and the meek Denise. Meanwhile, Jesse joins the Treblemakers.\n\nThe Bellas participate in the 2012 ICCA Regionals, where, at Aubrey's insistence, they perform the same medley that helped the Bellas advance to the Finals the previous year. In spite of their stale setlist, the group manages to place second, sending them to the Semi-Finals. After the competition, the Bellas try to break up a fight between the Treblemakers and the Tonehangers, a male alumni a cappella group. Beca and Fat Amy accidentally smash a window with the Treblemakers' trophy, alerting police who then arrest Beca. Jesse contacts her dad to bail her out, causing a rift in her relationship with both. Aubrey insists on performing the same medley a third time, despite Beca urging them to be more daring. In the midst of their performance, Beca, hoping to reinvigorate the disinterested crowd, inserts an impromptu layering of \"[[Bulletproof (La Roux song)|Bulletproof]]\" into the set.\n\nAubrey angrily berates Beca for this and accuses her of hooking up with Jesse, a rule breach punishable by ejection from the Bellas. Jesse overhears and attempts to deny it, leading Beca to snap at them both and quit the Bellas. Despite the judges and crowd enjoying Beca's improvisation, the Bellas do not advance to the Finals due to their third-place ranking behind the Treblemakers and the Footnotes. However, Jesse's roommate Benji Applebaum finds out that Footnotes leader Timothy is a high school student and reports it, disqualifying the Footnotes and allowing the Bellas to advance to the Finals. After spring break, Beca tries to reconcile with Jesse, but he rejects her, accusing her of pushing away everyone who cares about her.\n\nDuring the Bellas' rehearsal, Chloe stands up against Aubrey, sparking a fight over the [[pitch pipe]]. Beca then returns, apologizes to the Bellas for changing the set without Aubrey's permission during the Semi-Finals, and asks to be given a second chance. After all of the Bellas have a heart-to-heart conversation, Beca rejoins the group, and Aubrey relinquishes her half of the leadership to Beca. Chloe discovers that after her spring break node removal surgery, she is able to sing bass notes. Meanwhile, Treblemakers leader Bumper Allen leaves the group after being offered a job as a back-up singer for [[John Mayer]]. With Bumper gone, Jesse persuades the Trebles to let Benji join the group in Bumper's place, a position Benji was denied earlier in spite of his impressive audition.\n\nAt the Finals, the Bellas perform a modern piece arranged by Beca, which includes \"[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]\", featured in ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', one of Jesse's favorite movies. This acts as a more effective apology, and after the performance, she and Jesse kiss. Chloe's new ability to hit bass notes contributes to a fuller, more dynamic sound in the Bellas performance. The Bellas narrowly defeat the Treblemakers and win the national championship. Six months later, auditions for new members take place.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Beca Mitchell, an introverted and rebellious freshman who joins the Bellas to appease her professor father.\n* [[Skylar Astin]] as Jesse Swanson, an outgoing Barden freshman who hopes to become a film score composer.\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart, a confident, comical singer from Tasmania.\n* [[Adam DeVine]] as Bumper Allen, the egotistical leader of the Treblemakers\n* [[Anna Camp]] as Aubrey Posen, the uptight and traditionalist co-leader of the Bellas. \n* [[Brittany Snow]] as Chloe Beale, the friendlier and more civil co-leader of the Bellas.\n* [[Alexis Knapp]] as Stacie Conrad, a highly sexually driven singer and dancer.\n* [[Ester Dean]] as Cynthia Rose Adams, a tough [[Soul music|soul singer]].<!-- DO NOT add inappropriate information about her race, sexuality or gambling problem -->\n* [[Hana Mae Lee]] as Lilly Onakuramara, a strange soft-spoken student and talented [[Beatboxing|beatboxer]]. \n* [[Ben Platt]] as Benji Applebaum, Jesse's roommate, an [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]] who dreams of being a Treble.\n* [[Utkarsh Ambudkar]] as Donald, Bumper's right-hand man, a lead vocalist, beatboxer, and rapper\n* Michael Viruet as Unicycle, a beatboxer.\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as John Smith, a commentator for the ICCAs.\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Gail Abernathy-McKadden, a commentator for the ICCAs.\n\n[[Kelley Jakle|Kelley Alice Jakle]], Wanetah Walmsley, [[Shelley Regner]], Caroline Fourmy, and Nicole Lovince play Barden Bellas members Jessica, a bubbly and [[Absent-mindedness|absent-minded]] [[soprano]], Denise, an unobtrusive [[alto]], Ashley, an alto and beatboxer, Mary-Elise, a short-lived member of the Bellas, and Kori, another short-lived member of the Bellas.\n\n[[David Del Rio]] appears as Kolio, and Steven Bailey, Michael Anaya, Greg Gorenc, Brian Silver, and Wesley Lagarde appear as five unnamed members of the Treblemakers.

Rapkin, senior editor at [[GQ|'' GQ'' magazine]], spent a season covering competitive collegiate a cappella. He followed the [[Tufts University]] [[Beelzebubs]] (the inspiration for the Treblemakers), the [[University of Oregon]] Divisi (the loose inspiration for the Bellas), and the [[University of Virginia]] [[Hullabahoos]], who have a cameo in the film. Rapkin's book mainly covers the singing, groupies, partying and rivalries. Two members of the a cappella community, [[Deke Sharon]], who founded the [[International Championship of College A Cappella]], and Ed Boyer, both in Rapkin's book, were brought on board to arrange songs, produce vocals and act as on-site music directors, where they ran a month-long \"a cappella boot camp\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=11128|title=PITCH PERFECT \u2013 Production Notes|publisher=Cinema Review|year=2013|access-date=June 14, 2013|archive-date=April 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420132810/http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=11128|url-status=dead}}</ref> The film was shot throughout campus and inside buildings at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].<ref name=\"lsureveille1\">{{cite web|url=http://admin.collegepublisher.com/preview/mobile/2.3471/2.4054/1.2664456|archive-url=https://archive.today/2014.02.07-141508/http://admin.collegepublisher.com/preview/mobile/2.3471/2.4054/1.2664456|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 7, 2014|title='Pitch Perfect' finds ideal shooting locations on campus|publisher=Lsureveille.com|date=November 3, 2011|access-date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Banks]] is a co-producer and a co-star in the film.<ref name=\"lsureveille1\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe casting department included Justin Coulter, Rich Delia, Allison Estrin, and Michael Roth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981677/fullcredits#cast|title=Pitch Percect (2012); full cast and crew|publisher=Internet Movie Database|access-date=June 14, 2013|archive-date=January 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118163338/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981677/fullcredits#cast|url-status=live}}</ref> Producer [[Elizabeth Banks]] appears throughout the film alongside [[John Michael Higgins]] as commentators for the competitions.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stransky|first=Tanner|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/11/28/elizabeth-banks-pitch-perfect-hunger-games-interview|title=Elizabeth Banks talks 'Hunger Games' and new film 'Pitch Perfect'|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 28, 2011|access-date=January 10, 2012|archive-date=January 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119150500/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/11/28/elizabeth-banks-pitch-perfect-hunger-games-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Paul Brooks]] stated \"First and foremost, we were looking for actors who had comedic instincts and thought we'd get lucky with terrific actors who happened to be funny and can actually dance and maybe sing.

Anna was our first choice for the role of Beca.\"<ref name=\"Production Notes\" />\n\nWhen casting the character of Jesse, [[Max Handelman]] said \"We were looking for a young [[John Cusack]]-type guy. We needed to find someone who was kind of awkward but not a geek, but not so cool that you're not rooting for him.\" [[Skylar Astin]] was chosen for the role. Of Astin's audition, Banks said the chemistry between Skylar and Anna when they read together prior to shooting was \"clear and they were able to riff off each other.\"<ref name=\"Production Notes\" />\n\nRebel Wilson was recognized for her performance in the comedy film ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'' upon auditioning for the role of Fat Amy, which she won instantly. Moore recalled Wilson singing [[Lady Gaga]]'s \"[[The Edge of Glory]]\" while beating \"on her chest with her fists.\" He said, \"I didn't even hear the end of the song because I was laughing so hard. There's this beautiful openness to the way Rebel approaches everything, and that's what works great for the character. She's fearless.\"<ref name=\"Production Notes\" /> [[Adam DeVine]] was personally chosen by Banks and Handelman for the role of Bumper after they saw him on the television series ''[[Workaholics]].'' Banks confessed that she and her husband are \"big ''Workaholics'' fans,\" and after watching one night during the film's casting, they saw DeVine and \"immediately thought\" he would be a good choice for Bumper. He initially declined because he was not a singer. DeVine eventually surprised Banks and Handelman with his vocal skills.<ref name=\"Production Notes\" /> [[Anna Camp]] was chosen for the role of Aubrey. Producer [[Max Handelman]] said, \"Elizabeth and I were huge fans of Anna's from ''True Blood.'' Aubrey is set up as the antagonist for Beca, and Beca's already a bit hard-edged, so it was so important to find an actress who could play Aubrey as someone who could marshal the crazy but also was sympathetic.\"<ref name=\"Production Notes\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released on October 5, 2012, in the United States.\nIn Australia, it was released on December 6, 2012.\n\n===Home media===\n''Pitch Perfect'' was released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], and Blu-ray/DVD combo pack on December 18, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://videoeta.com/movie/138513 |title=Pitch Perfect (2012) DVD and Blu-ray |publisher=VideoETA |access-date=2014-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144228/http://videoeta.com/movie/138513 |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  A 4K UHD Blu-Ray release followed on March 20, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultrahd.highdefdigest.com/56085/pitchperfectultrahdbluray.html|title=Pitch Perfect - 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Ultra HD Review {{!}} High Def Digest|website=ultrahd.highdefdigest.com|access-date=2018-05-04|archive-date=May 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504225631/https://ultrahd.highdefdigest.com/56085/pitchperfectultrahdbluray.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Rebel Wilson.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rebel Wilson was praised for her performance.<ref name=\"Ebert\" />]]\n\n===Box office===\n{{Anchor|Release}}\n''Pitch Perfect'' grossed $65 million in North America and $50.3 million in other territories for a total gross of $115.4 million since release, against a $17 million budget.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo.com\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pitchperfect.htm |title= Pitch Perfect (2012) |publisher= [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= February 18, 2020 |archive-date= October 14, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191014140902/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pitchperfect.htm |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nThe film opened in [[limited release]] in the United States and Canada on September 28, 2012, and [[wide release]] in the United States and Canada on October 5, 2012.
