It was produced by [[Walden Media]] and released by [[20th Century Fox]]. It stars [[AnnaSophia Robb]] (in her debut film role), [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Cicely Tyson]], [[Luke Benward]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Courtney Jines]], B.J. Hopper, Nick Price, [[Elle Fanning]], [[Harland Williams]], and [[John McConnell (actor)|John McConnell]]. It premiered at the USA Film Festival on January 26, 2005 and was theatrically released on February 18, 2005. It received mixed reviews from critics and earned $33.5 million against a production budget of $14 million. It was released on DVD and VHS on August 9, 2005, by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nTen-year-old India Opal Buloni has just moved to the fictional small town of Naomi, Florida with her father who is a [[preacher]].\n\nWhile at [[Winn-Dixie]], Opal encounters a scruffy [[Berger Picard]] that is wreaking havoc. She (not wanting the manager to send him to the pound) claims that he is her dog and names him \"Winn-Dixie\". He becomes friends with everyone he encounters, and so Opal makes some new friends in the process. She also rekindles her relationship with her father and learns ten things about her mother, Benjean-Megan, who abandoned them when she was three. She describes the preacher as a turtle, always sticking his head into his shell, and never wanting to come out into the real world. This is most likely because of how sad he is about her mother, whom he is still in love with.\n\nOne of the people Opal meets is Miss Franny Block, a kind and somewhat eccentric elder librarian, who tells her many great stories, including one involving a bear. She also meets Gloria Dump, a blind African American recovering alcoholic with a \"mistake tree\" with beer bottles hanging from it in her backyard. She tells Opal that the bottles represent the ghosts of all the things she has done wrong.\n\nOne day, fed up with Winn-Dixie, the landlord of the Bulonis' trailer park, Mr. Alfred, demands they get rid of him. The preacher calls the pound, but Opal begs to keep him. Unable to see her upset, he asks the pound to return Winn-Dixie, claiming he is not the same dog he called about. The preacher is able to convince Mr. Alfred to allow them three months' time to find Winn-Dixie a new home. However, it is later revealed that, like a lot of the characters, Mr. Alfred is dealing with [[Clinical depression|difficult feelings]] which are impacting how he interacts with the Buloni's, and Winn-Dixie.\n\nOpal gets a job at Gertrude's Pets and befriends Otis, a shy ex-convict with a passion for music. She also meets a young girl named Sweetie Pie Thomas, who is eager to get a dog like Winn-Dixie. With enough new friends, Opal and Gloria decide to host a party, inviting all of Opal's new friends. Opal also takes a risk by inviting Mr. Alfred to the party as well, which he, after hesitating, begrudgingly accepts. During the party, a severe thunderstorm strikes, and Winn-Dixie, being pathologically afraid of them, runs away. While Opal looks for him, her father wants to give up and she blames him for the loss of her mother and Winn-Dixie running away. He explains that he tried very hard to look for her mother. He then admits that it was his fault that she left him, and he believes that she is never coming back. However, he is grateful that she left Opal with him. Later they go back to a party and Otis starts to play a song on his guitar. Winn-Dixie is heard outside howling along to it. Everyone, while singing, lets him in and welcomes him back.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[AnnaSophia Robb]] as India Opal Buloni<ref name=\"NYT2005\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/18/arts/movies/film-in-review-because-of-winndixie.html |url-access=subscription |title=Film in Review; 'Because of Winn-Dixie' |date=2005-02-18 |access-date=2022-05-11 |website=[[New York Times]] |last=Gates |first=Anita |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210507004751/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/18/arts/movies/film-in-review-because-of-winndixie.html |archive-date=2021-05-07 |url-status=live |language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Mr. Buloni \"The Preacher\"\n* [[Cicely Tyson]] as Gloria Dump<ref name=\"NYT2005\" />\n* [[Luke Benward]] as Steven \"Stevie\" Dewberry\n* [[Dave Matthews]] as Otis\n* [[Eva Marie Saint]] as Ms. Franny Block\n* [[Courtney Jines]] as Amanda Wilkinson\n* B.J.

It was shot on location in [[Napoleonville, Louisiana]], with some shooting in [[Gibson, Louisiana]]. To make sure both dogs got on well with AnnaSophia Robb, who played Opal, she was brought in early to get acquainted with them and give them treats. By the time shooting started, they considered her a \"safe\" area. {{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Winn-Dixie was played by multiple Picardy Shepherds, a rare breed from France. The DVD extra \"Diamond in the Ruff\" shows the two principal dogs named Scott and Lyco, but producer Trevor Albert mentions in the DVD feature commentary that, in all, four dogs were used. In the featurette \"Meet Winn-Dixie\" AnnaSophia Robb mentions that the stunt dog named Tasha jumped over the flour. The film's mouse was played by a rat. The choice was made carefully because while mice would have been preferable, rats are much easier to train.\n\nDirector Wayne Wang wanted to use Picardy Shepherds because he thought they looked similar to the depiction of Winn-Dixie on the book cover and would appear familiar to its readers. Dogs were brought from France when none were available in the U.S. The film, like the book, is set in Naomi, Florida, even though it was filmed in Louisiana. Consequently, the police car and uniform emblems depict Florida rather than Louisiana. The bunny that Otis hands Opal (at around 56 mins) is a Netherland Dwarf. They only get to be between 6 and 8 inches long.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* \"Opal's Blues\" \u2013 [[The Be Good Tanyas]]\n* \"Won't Give In\" \u2013 [[The Finn Brothers]]\n* \"[[Splish Splash (song)|Splish Splash]]\" \u2013 [[Adam Schlesinger]] and [[James Iha]]\n* \"Sunflower\" \u2013 [[Alice Peacock]]\n* \"[[The Clapping Song]]\" \u2013 [[Shirley Ellis]]\n* String Quartet #17 (\"Hunt\")\n* \"Butterfly\" \u2013 [[Dave Matthews]]\n* \"[[Sunrise (Norah Jones song)|Sunrise]]\" \u2013 [[Norah Jones]]\n* \"Cabaret\" \u2013 [[Emmylou Harris]]\n* \"I've Gotta See You Smile\" - [[Leigh Nash]]\n* \"Glory Glory\" \u2013 [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Cicely Tyson]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Courtney Jines]], Nick Price, [[Luke Benward]], [[Elle Fanning]], and B.J.
