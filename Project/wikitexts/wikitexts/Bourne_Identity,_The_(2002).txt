It was directed and co-produced by [[Doug Liman]] and written by [[Tony Gilroy]] and [[William Blake Herron]]. It stars [[Matt Damon]] as [[Jason Bourne]], a man suffering from [[psychogenic amnesia]] attempting to discover his identity amidst a clandestine conspiracy within the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. It also features [[Franka Potente]], [[Chris Cooper]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Walton Goggins]], and [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]]. The first installment in the [[Bourne (film series)|''Bourne'' film series]], it was followed by ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'' (2004), ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007), ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'' (2012), and ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'' (2016).\n\nAlthough Robert Ludlum died in 2001, he is credited as an [[executive producer]] alongside [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]]. [[Universal Pictures]] released the film to theatres in the United States on June 14, 2002. The film opened to critical and commercial success, grossing $214 million on a $60 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Italian fishermen rescue an American man adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds and find he has no memory of his identity, but demonstrates advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. They find a [[laser projector]] under the man's hip that gives the number of a [[safe deposit box]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]], and the man decides to go investigate. He goes to the bank to investigate the deposit box where he finds various currencies, passports and IDs, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and starts using the name on the American passport, [[Jason Bourne]]. After Bourne's departure, a bank employee contacts Operation Treadstone, a CIA [[black operation|black ops]] program. Treadstone's head, Conklin, issues alerts to police to capture Bourne and assigns three agents to kill him: Castel, Manheim, and the Professor.\n\n[[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Deputy Director]] Abbott contacts Conklin about a failed assassination attempt against exiled African dictator Wombosi, and Conklin promises that he will deal with the agent who failed. Bourne tries evading the Swiss police by using his U.S. passport to enter the American consulate, but is pursued by [[Marine guards]]. He escapes before offering $20,000 to Marie Kreutz, a 26-year-old German woman whom he saw at the consulate, to drive him to an address in Paris. Upon reaching the address, they enter an apartment where Bourne contacts a hotel through the phone. He inquires about the names on his passports there, learning that a \"John Michael Kane\" was registered but died two weeks prior in a car crash. Castel ambushes Bourne and Marie in the apartment, but Bourne gets the upper hand. Instead of allowing himself to be interrogated, Castel throws himself from a window to his death.\n\nWhile searching through Castel's belongings, Marie finds wanted posters of Bourne and herself, and agrees to help him. After the two evade police in Marie's car, they spend the night in a Paris hotel. Meanwhile, Wombosi obsesses over the attempt on his life. Conklin, having anticipated this, planted a body to pose as John Michael Kane in a morgue to appear as the assailant, but Wombosi remains unconvinced and threatens to report the CIA\u2019s actions to the media. The Professor then assassinates Wombosi on Conklin's orders. Bourne, posing as Kane, learns about the failed assassination attempt on Wombosi's yacht, and that the assassin was shot twice in the back during the escape, ultimately realizing that he was responsible for the attempt. Bourne and Marie take refuge at the French countryside home of Marie's friend Eamon and his children.\n\nUnder pressure from Abbott to handle the matter, Conklin tracks Bourne's location and sends the Professor to kill him. The Professor is mortally wounded by Bourne, and reveals their shared connection to Treadstone before dying. Bourne sends Marie, Eamon, and the children away for their protection, then contacts Conklin via the Professor's phone, and they agree to meet alone in Paris. When Bourne sees Conklin is not alone, he abandons their meeting, but manages to place a tracking device on Conklin's car, leading Bourne to Treadstone's safe house in Paris. Bourne breaks in and holds Conklin and logistics technician Nicky Parsons at gunpoint. Conklin reveals to Bourne his association with Treadstone and presses him to remember his past. Bourne recalls his attempt to assassinate Wombosi through successive flashbacks.\n\nUnder orders from Treadstone, Bourne infiltrated Wombosi's yacht as Kane and managed to get close enough to assassinate him. However, Bourne was unable to find the nerve to kill Wombosi while his children were present, and instead fled, being shot during his escape. Bourne announces he is resigning from Treadstone and warns Conklin not to follow him. As agents descend on the safe house, Bourne fights his way through. When Conklin leaves the safe house, he encounters Manheim, who kills him under Abbott's orders. Abbott then shuts down Treadstone. Abbott reports to an oversight committee that Treadstone is \"decommissioned\" before discussion turns to a new project codenamed \"[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|Blackbriar]]\". Some time later, Bourne finds Marie renting out scooters to tourists on [[Mykonos]], and the two reunite.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Matt Damon at Incirlik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Damon in 2001]]\n<!--Starring roles are listed with bullet points here-->\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Jason Bourne]] / David Webb\n* [[Franka Potente]] as Marie Kreutz\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Alexander Conklin\n* [[Clive Owen]] as The Professor\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Ward Abbott\n* [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] as Nykwana Wombosi\n* [[Gabriel Mann]] as Danny Zorn\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Nicolette \"Nicky\" Parsons\n* [[Orso Maria Guerrini]] as Giancarlo\n* [[Tim Dutton]] as Eamon\n* Nicky Naude as Castel\n* Russell Levy as Manheim\n* [[Vincent Franklin]] as Rawlins\n\n[[Walton Goggins]], [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]], and [[Brian Huskey]] appear as Treadstone research technicians.

Near the end of production of Liman's previous film ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]'', Liman decided to develop a film adaptation of the novel. After more than two years of securing rights to the book from [[Warner Bros.]] and a further year of screenplay development with screenwriter Tony Gilroy, the film went through two years of production.<ref name=\"DVD.com\">'The Bourne Identity' DVD Commentary Featuring Doug Liman (2003).</ref> [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] acquired the film rights to Ludlum's books in the hopes of starting a new film franchise.<ref name=Pitt>{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/pitt-giving-books-look-for-par-u-1117779297/|title=Pitt giving books look for Par & U|date=March 9, 2000|work=Variety|access-date = May 25, 2015}}</ref> [[William Blake Herron]] was brought in to rewrite the script in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|title=Lopez after 'Angel'; Kumble surfs the Web|url=https://variety.com/1999/voices/columns/lopez-after-angel-kumble-surfs-the-web-1117503410/|work=Variety|date=June 24, 1999|access-date=May 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOf particular inspiration were Liman's father Arthur Liman's memoirs regarding his involvement in the investigation of the [[Iran\u2013Contra affair]]. Many aspects of the Alexander Conklin character were based on his father's recollections of [[Oliver North]]. Liman admitted that he jettisoned much of the content of the novel beyond the central premise, in order to modernize the material and to conform it to his own beliefs regarding [[United States foreign policy]]. However, Liman was careful not to cram his political views down \"the audience's throat\". There were initial concerns regarding the film's possible obsolescence and overall reception in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], but these concerns proved groundless.<ref name=\"DVD.com\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLiman approached a wide range of actors for the role of Bourne, including [[Brad Pitt]],<ref name=Pitt/> who turned it down to star in ''[[Spy Game]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/inside-moves-187-1117822077/|title=Inside Moves|work=Variety|date=May 25, 2000|access-date=May 25, 2015}}</ref> as well as [[Russell Crowe]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]], before he eventually cast Damon.

With stunt choreographer Nick Powell, he underwent three months of extensive training in stunt work, the use of weapons, [[boxing]], and the Filipino martial art  [[Arnis|eskrima]]. He eventually performed a significant number of the film's stunts himself, including hand-to-hand combat and climbing the safe house walls near the film's conclusion.<ref name=\"DVDDocumentary\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began October 31, 2000. From the onset of filming, difficulties with the studio slowed the film's development and caused a rift between the director and Universal Pictures, as executives were unhappy with the film's pacing, emphasis on small scale action sequences, and the general relationship between themselves and Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement.<ref name=\"Wall\">{{cite web |last=King |first=Tom |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |title=Bourne to be Wild |url=http://www.murphsplace.com/owen/articles/journal2.html |access-date=March 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015074908/http://www.murphsplace.com/owen/articles/journal2.html |archive-date=October 15, 2012 }}</ref> A number of reshoots and rewrites late in development, plus scheduling problems, delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; screenwriter [[Tony Gilroy]] faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming.<ref name=\"Wall\" /> A particular point of contention with regard to the original Gilroy script were the scenes set in the farmhouse near the film's conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon fought to keep the scenes in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though the scenes were low key, they were integral to the audience's understanding of the Bourne character and the film's central themes. The farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product.<ref name=\"Wall\" />\n\nOther issues included the studio's desire to substitute [[Montreal]] or [[Prague]] for Paris in order to lower costs, Liman's insistence on the use of a French-speaking film crew, and poor test audience reactions to the film's Paris finale. The latter required a late return to location in order to shoot a new, more action-oriented conclusion to the Paris story arc.<ref name=\"Reel\">{{cite web|last=Wells |first=Jeffrey |work=Reel.com |title=Bourne on His Back |url=http://www.reel.com/reel.asp?node=movienews/confidential&pageid=20643 |access-date=March 12, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217061326/http://www.reel.com/reel.asp?node=movienews%2Fconfidential&pageid=20643 |archive-date=February 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition to Paris, filming took place in Prague, [[Imperia (city)|Imperia]], [[Rome]], [[Mykonos]], and [[Z\u00fcrich]]; several scenes set in Z\u00fcrich were also filmed in Prague.<ref name=\"DVD.com\" /> Damon described the production as a struggle, citing the early conflicts that he and Liman had with the studio, but denied that it was an overtly difficult process, stating, \"When I hear people saying that the production was a nightmare it's like, a 'nightmare'?

Many times he operated the camera himself in order to create what he believed was a more intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.<ref name=\"DVDDocumentary\">'The Birth of the Bourne Identity' DVD Making of Documentary (2003).</ref>\n\nThe acclaimed car chase sequence was filmed primarily by the [[second unit]] under [[second unit director|director]] [[Alexander Witt]]. The unit shot in various locations around Paris while Liman was filming the main story arc elsewhere in the city. The finished footage was eventually edited together to create the illusion of a coherent journey. Liman confessed that \"anyone who really knows Paris will find it illogical\", since few of the locations used in the car chase actually connect to each other.<ref name=\"Reel\" /> Liman took only a few of the shots himself; his most notable chase sequence shots were those of Matt Damon and Franka Potente while inside the car.<ref name=\"DVD.com\" />\n\nThe embassy scenes were filmed in 2001 with real U.S. [[Marine Security Guard]]s playing the roles of embassy guards.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.beaufort.marines.mil/CommStrat/News/News-View/Article/523815/personnel-officer-hits-the-silver-screen/ | title=Personnel Officer hits the Silver Screen }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a {{RT data|score}} approval rating based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average score of {{RT data|average}} and a consensus: \"Expertly blending genre formula with bursts of unexpected wit, ''The Bourne Identity'' is an action thriller that delivers{{emdash}}and then some.\" On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-bourne-identity |title=The Bourne Identity Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=April 19, 2019}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com|title=Find CinemaScore|format=Type \"Bourne\" in the search box|publisher=[[CinemaScore]]|access-date= July 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]] ''gave the film three out of four stars and praised it for its ability to absorb the viewer in its \"spycraft\" and \"Damon's ability to be focused and sincere\" concluding that the film was \"unnecessary, but not unskilled\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=The Bourne Identity |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-bourne-identity-2002 |access-date=June 14, 2022}}</ref> Walter Chaw of ''Film Freak Central'' praised the film for its pacing and action sequences, describing them as \"kinetic, fair, and intelligent, every payoff packaged with a moment's contemplation crucial to the creation of tension\" and that the movie could be understood as a clever subversion of the genre.<ref>{{cite web |last=Chaw |first=Walter |work=FilmFreakCentral.com |title=The Bourne Identity Review |url=http://filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/bourneidentity.htm |access-date=March 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306133449/http://filmfreakcentral.net/dvdreviews/bourneidentity.htm |archive-date=March 6, 2012 }}</ref> Charles Taylor of ''Salon.com'' acclaimed the film as \"entertaining, handsome and gripping, ''The Bourne Identity'' is something of an anomaly among big-budget summer blockbusters: a thriller with some brains and feeling behind it, more attuned to story and character than to spectacle\" and praised Liman for giving the film a \"tough mindedness\" that never gives way into \"cynicism or hopelessness\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Charles |work=Salon.com |title=The Bourne Identity Review |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2002/06/14/bourne/index.html?pn=1 |access-date=March 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929144128/http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2002/06/14/bourne/index.html?pn=1 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nEd Gonzalez of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' also noted Doug Liman's \"restrained approach to the material\" as well as Matt Damon and Franka Potente's strong chemistry, but ultimately concluded the film was \"smart, but not smart enough\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Gonzalez |first=Ed |work=SlantMagazine.com |title=The Bourne Identity Review |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=62 |access-date=March 8, 2007}}</ref> J.
