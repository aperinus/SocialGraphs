The film's plot revolves around two shop employees who compete for the affection of their newest co-worker. The film was shot primarily at the [[Costco]] store in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2006/01/02/daily9.html | title =  \"Employee of the Month\" to film in Nm | first = NMBW | last = staff | date = 2006-01-05 | access-date = 2013-12-09 | work=Albuquerque Business First}}</ref> The film was released on October 6, 2006 and grossed $38 million.\n\n==Plot==\nFor years, Zack Bradley has been working at the local \"[[warehouse club|Super Club]]\" as a box boy. He lives with his grandmother and spends his free time with co-workers Lon Neilson, Iqbal Raji, and Russell Porpis-Gunders.\n\nDespite his [[slacker]]-like ways, Zack is kind-hearted, popular and supportive. His rival co-worker, Vince Downey, earns [[Employee of the month (program)|Employee of the Month]] for the 17th time in a row. He is egotistical and rude towards his co-workers, including his box boy Jorge Mecico, whom he berates constantly.\n\nWhen new cashier Amy Renfro is hired, Zack and Vince fall for her and compete for her affection. Zack learns from Russell that she slept with the Employee of the Month at her last job, so he decides to win the title. Amy has dinner with Vince, but is repulsed when he puts the move on her. Oblivious to how Amy feels, he thinks it went well, and continues pursuing her. Zack steps up his act and begins going to work on time and working harder, giving Vince competition for the title. He also goes on a date with Amy, which takes place entirely inside Super Club.\n\nWithin a few days, with Vince still winning the daily star, Zack realizes getting Employee of the Month is not so easy. With Iqbal's encouragement, Zack finds his groove and, to Vince's horror, wins the star the next day. A war of attrition begins, as Vince tries everything he can to derail Zack's string of stars, even breaking into his house one night to reset the clocks; the sabotage causes him to arrive a minute late the following day, but with Iqbal's help, Zack's attendance card indicates he arrived on time, causing the plan to fail.\n\nZack takes Iqbal's shift on the day of a softball game against rival chain Maxi-Mart. However, he leaves to play in the game and Iqbal is fired. Frustrated at Zack's new attitude, his friends tell him he is turning into Vince and feel his attempt at getting the title is a result of trying to have sex with Amy. She overhears and is disgusted at Zack for his true intentions, prompting her to compare him to her last boyfriend, also an Employee of the Month with whom she indeed had sex but could not stand his attitude, which was why she requested a transfer.\n\nAt month's end, Zack and Vince are tied. On the day of the tie-breaking competition, Zack quits, gets Iqbal his job back and tells him he took responsibility for what happened, making a heartfelt apology to Lon, Iqbal, and Russell. Zack tells them he plans to win the competition, not for recognition or to make an impression, but for pride.\n\nWhen the store manager is about to announce Zack's resignation, Zack, Lon, Iqbal, and Russell show up saying Zack never filed the resignation papers. (Russell bribed the [[human resources]] manager with a [[Butterfinger]].) Zack tries to reconcile with Amy, giving a heartfelt apology and telling her that no matter what, he is a better man thanks to her. Despite Vince's protests, the competition for the fastest checkout, is held. The Employee of the Month Award will be granted to whoever finishes the task first.\n\nVince beats Zack by seconds but, during the award ceremony, Semi, the security guard, brings a surveillance video of the competition that shows Vince throwing store products behind his back and onto the conveyor belt without [[Barcode reader|scanning]] them. The store's assistant manager gets the receipts for the scanned items in the competition, and Vince's is not only way shorter in length, but the total cost is also less than it should be. Semi adds that videos show that Vince has been failing to ring up items all year, which has cost the store thousands of dollars. Vince is fired and Zack ends up winning the competition, as well as rekindling his relationship with Amy.\n\nSix weeks after being fired from Super Club, Vince is on probation, working at Maxi-Mart. Jorge's now treats Vince the same as he was treated by him. However, while they are both sitting in Jorge's new car, when Vince asks for a ride to the bus stop, Jorge agrees. He drives Vince to the bus stop, but he deliberately drives outside the range of Vince's court ordered [[ankle monitor]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dane Cook]] as Zack Bradley\n* [[Jessica Simpson]] as Amy Renfro\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Vince Downey\n* [[Tim Bagley]] as Glen Garry\n* [[Andy Dick]] as Lon Neilson\n* [[Brian George]] as Iqbal Raji\n* [[Harland Williams]] as Russell Porpis-Gunders\n* [[Efren Ramirez]] as Jorge Mecico\n* [[Sean Whalen]] as Dirk Dittman\n* [[Marcello Thedford]] as Semi\n* [[Danny Woodburn]] as Glen Ross\n* Barbara Dodd as Granny\n\n==Release==\nThe film became the #1 requested film on [[AOL]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/6691/untitledsk2.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-11-01 |archive-date=2007-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310210955/http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/6691/untitledsk2.jpg |url-status=dead }}</ref> The film opened to $11.4 million opening weekend at #4 just behind ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]''.
