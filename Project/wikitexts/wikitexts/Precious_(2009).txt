''Precious'' won the People's Choice Award at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September.

''Precious'' received widespread critical acclaim; the performances of Sidibe and Mo'Nique, the story, and its message were highly praised. The film was a box office success, earning over $63 million on a $10 million budget.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\" />\n\n''Precious'' received six nominations at the [[82nd Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Daniels, and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Sidibe. Mo'Nique won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], while Geoffrey Fletcher won for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], becoming the first African-American to win a screenplay award at the Oscars.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1987, 16-year-old Claireece \"Precious\" Jones lives in [[New York City]]'s [[Harlem]] neighborhood with her unemployed mother, Mary, who has long subjected her to physical and verbal abuse. Precious has also been [[rape]]d by her now-absent father, Carl, resulting in two pregnancies. The family resides in a [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] [[tenement]] and survives on [[American welfare state|welfare]]. Precious's first child, a daughter named \"Mongo\" (short for [[Mongoloid]]), has [[Down syndrome]] and is being cared for by Precious's grandmother. However, Mary forces the family to pretend that Mongo lives with her and Precious so she can receive extra money from the government. When Precious's second pregnancy is discovered, her junior high principal arranges for her to attend an [[alternative school]], where she hopes Precious can change her life's direction. Precious finds a way out of her traumatic daily life by escaping into daydreams in which she is loved and appreciated.\n\nInspired by her new teacher, Blu Rain, Precious learns to read and write. She meets sporadically with social worker Ms. Weiss, who learns about the sexual assault in the household when Precious reveals who fathered her children. While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets and develops a crush on John McFadden, a nursing assistant who shows her kindness. When Precious returns home, Mary asks to hold Abdul; however, when Precious's back is turned, Mary purposely drops Abdul, who cries upon impact. Mary attacks Precious, angrily declaring Precious's revelation about the abuse has resulted in termination of welfare payments. Precious fights back and runs away with Abdul, and Mary deliberately tries to drop her television set on them; Precious eventually breaks into her school classroom for shelter. When Ms. Rain discovers them the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for Precious and Abdul to live, but they end up staying with Ms. Rain and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Ms. Rain takes Precious and Abdul to find assistance. Precious is able to continue her schooling while raising Abdul in a [[halfway house]].\n\nMary soon returns to inform Precious of her father's death from [[AIDS]]. Precious later learns that she is [[HIV-positive]], though Abdul is not. Feeling dejected, she steals her case file from Ms. Weiss's office. As she shares the details of her file with her fellow students, she begins to hope for the future. Later, Precious meets with her mother, who brings Mongo to Ms. Weiss's office. Ms. Weiss confronts Mary about her and Carl's abuse of Precious, going back to when Precious was a toddler. Mary tearfully confesses that she always hated Precious for \"stealing her man\" by \"letting him\" abuse her and for eventually \"making him leave.\" Precious tells Mary that she finally sees her for who she really is and severs ties with her, leaving with both Mongo and Abdul. Mary begs Ms. Weiss to retrieve her daughter and grandchildren, but Ms. Weiss silently rejects her and walks away, leaving a distraught Mary alone and broken.\n\nPlanning to complete a [[General Educational Development|GED]] test to receive a high-school diploma equivalency, followed by college, Precious walks into the city with her children, ready to start a new life with a brighter future.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gabourey Sidibe]] as Claireece \"Precious\" Jones.

Stevens noted that, while the film is about improvement and self-actualization, \"it wields an awfully large cudgel\", in contrast to Scott's view of balance: \"unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail)\". Perhaps sharing Mathews's view regarding the daunting challenge of adapting the harsh story of ''Push'', Stevens observed that \"Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice to the kind of protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, black, overweight single mother from the inner city.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2234728/ |title=Sorry I didn't like Precious |date=November 6, 2009 |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|slate.com]] |access-date=February 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n''Precious'' also received some negative responses from critics.
