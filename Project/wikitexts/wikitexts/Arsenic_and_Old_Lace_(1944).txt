It was based on [[Joseph Kesselring]]'s 1941 play [[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|of the same name]]. The script [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] was written by [[Julius J. Epstein]] and [[Philip G. Epstein]].<ref>McGilligan 1986, p. 170.</ref> The contract with the play\u2019s producers stipulated that the film would not be released until the Broadway run ended. The original planned release date was September 30, 1942. The play was a tremendous hit, running for three and a half years, so the film was not released until 1944.\n\nThe lead role of Mortimer Brewster was originally intended for [[Bob Hope]], but he could not be released from his contract with [[Paramount Pictures]]. Capra had also approached [[Jack Benny]] and [[Richard Travis (actor)|Richard Travis]] before learning that Grant would accept the role. On the Broadway stage, [[Boris Karloff]] played Jonathan Brewster, who is said to \"look like Boris Karloff\". According to TCM, Karloff, who gave permission for the use of his name in the film, remained in the play to appease the producers, who were afraid of what stripping the play of all its primary cast would do to ticket sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/577/arsenic-and-old-lace#notes|title=Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) - Notes - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2022-10-03}}</ref> [[Raymond Massey]] took Karloff\u2019s place on screen.<ref>Atkinson, Brooks.

Several illustrious forebears' portraits line the walls of the ancestral home.\n\n[[File:Jean Adair Josephine Hull Cary Grant Arsenic and Old Lace 1944.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jean Adair, Josephine Hull and Cary Grant in ''Arsenic and Old Lace'']]\n\nMortimer Brewster, a writer who has repeatedly denounced marriage as \"an old-fashioned superstition\", falls in love with Elaine Harper, his neighbor and the minister's daughter. On [[Halloween]] day, Mortimer and Elaine get married. Elaine goes to her father's house to tell her father and pack for the honeymoon and Mortimer returns to Abby and Martha, the aunts who raised him in the old family home. Mortimer's brother, Teddy, who believes he is [[Theodore Roosevelt]], resides with them. Each time Teddy goes upstairs, he yells \"Charge!\" and runs up the stairs, imitating Roosevelt's famous 1898 [[Battle of San Juan Hill|charge up San Juan Hill]].\n\nSearching for the notes for his next book, Mortimer finds a corpse hidden in the [[window seat (type of sofa)|window seat]]. He assumes in horror that Teddy's delusions have led him to murder. Abby and Martha cheerfully explain that they are responsible, that as serial murderers, they minister to lonely old bachelors by ending their \"suffering\". They post a \"Room for Rent\" sign to attract a victim, then serve a glass of [[elderberry wine]] spiked with [[arsenic]], [[strychnine]], and [[cyanide#Poison use|cyanide]] while getting acquainted with them. The bodies are buried in the basement by Teddy, who believes they are [[yellow fever]] victims who perished in the building of the [[Panama Canal]].\n\nWhile Mortimer digests this information, his brother Jonathan arrives with his alcoholic accomplice, [[plastic surgeon]] Dr. Herman Einstein. Jonathan is also a serial murderer trying to escape from the police and dispose of his latest victim, Mr. Spinalzo. Jonathan's face, altered by Einstein while drunk, resembles [[Boris Karloff]]'s [[Frankenstein monster]] makeup.{{refn| The [[self-reference|self-referential]] joke highlights Karloff's portrayal of the character in the Broadway production.<ref name=\"Nixon\"/>|group=Note}} Jonathan learns his aunts' secret and proposes to bury his victim in the cellar. Abby and Martha object vehemently because their victims were \"nice\" gentlemen while Jonathan's victim is a stranger and a \"foreigner\". Jonathan also declares his intention to kill Mortimer.\n\nElaine is impatient to leave on their honeymoon but is concerned about Mortimer's increasingly odd behavior as he frantically attempts to control the situation. He tries unsuccessfully to alert the bumbling police to Jonathan's presence. To draw attention away from his aunts and deprive them of their willing but uncomprehending accomplice, Mortimer tries to file paperwork to have Teddy legally committed to a mental asylum. Worrying that the genetic predisposition for mental illness resides within him, Mortimer explains to Elaine that he can't remain married to her.\n\nEventually Jonathan is arrested, Einstein flees after signing Teddy's commitment papers, Teddy is safely consigned to an institution, and his aunts insist upon joining him. Upon hearing that Mortimer signed the commitment papers as next of kin, Abby and Martha are concerned they may be null and void; they inform Mortimer that he is not a Brewster after all: his mother was the family cook and his father was a chef on a steamship. Relieved, he lustily kisses Elaine and whisks her off to their honeymoon.\n\n==Reviews==\nThe contemporary critical reviews were uniformly positive.

Gunter argues that the deep theme of both the play and film is America's difficulty in coming to grips with both the positive and negative consequences of the liberty it professes to uphold, and which the Brewsters demand. Although their house is the nicest in the street, there are 12 bodies in the basement. That inconsistency is a metaphor for America's struggle to reconcile the violence of much of its past with the pervasive myths about its role as a beacon of freedom.<ref>Gunter [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLD--w2GHrkC&pg=PA45 2012, pp. 49\u201351.]</ref>\n\nFrom the movie 'George Washington Slept Here': To recreate the country home that was central to the film's plot, the house in Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) which was actually shot in 1941 for a later theatrical release, was used. To ensure it looked the part of a dilapidated home, Warner Bros. crews knocked out bannisters, rafters and floors on the set.[7]\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Mortimer Brewster\n* [[Priscilla Lane]] as Elaine Brewster\n* [[Josephine Hull]] as Aunt Abby Brewster\n* [[Jean Adair]] as Aunt Martha Brewster\n* [[Raymond Massey]] as Jonathan Brewster\n* [[Peter Lorre]] as Dr. Herman Einstein\n* [[John Alexander (actor)|John Alexander]] as \"Teddy Roosevelt\" Brewster\n* [[Jack Carson]] as Officer Patrick O'Hara\n* [[John Ridgely]] as Officer Sanders\n* [[Edward McNamara]] as Police Sgt.
