The film follows Donny Berger (Sandler), a middle-aged alcoholic who once enjoyed celebrity status for being at the center of a teacher-student [[statutory rape]] case, as he tries to rekindle his relationship with his adult son, Todd Peterson/Han Solo Berger (Samberg), born as the result of that illicit relationship, in hopes that their televised reunion will earn him enough money to avoid going to prison for [[tax evasion]].\n\nThe film was released on June 15, 2012, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It received negative reviews from critics and grossed $57 million against a $57\u201370 million budget, becoming a [[box-office bomb]]. It is often considered to be [[List of films considered the worst#That's My Boy (2012)|one of the worst film ever made]].{{Cn|reason=not properly supported by article, see Talk page|date=November 2022}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- On an edit on April 30, 2021, this plot section was reduced from 731 to 412 words.

However, in detention, Mary seduces Donny and they begin a sexual relationship. Their relationship is discovered during an auditorium speech. Subsequently, Mary is sentenced to 30 years in prison for [[statutory rape]], but the scandal makes Donny famous. Mary is also revealed to be [[pregnant]], and custody of their unborn son is given to Donny's abusive father. When Donny turns 18, he will take full custody.\n\nIn the present, Donny is an alcoholic and broke slacker who owes $43,000 to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) in back taxes. To avoid going to jail, he places a $20 bet on an 8000:1 runner in an upcoming race, but decides to make a backup plan should the runner lose. Meanwhile, he has also been estranged from his now 28-year-old son for the past 10 years. To avoid contact with his parents and others discovering the family connection, their son changed his name from Han Solo Berger to Todd Peterson and tells others that his parents died in an explosion. Now a successful businessman, Todd has recently arrived at the [[Cape Cod]] house of his boss, Steve Spirou, where he is to marry his fianc\u00e9e, Jamie.\n\nRandall Morgan, a [[television producer]] who worked with Donny during his time as a celebrity, offers him $50,000 if he can organize a reunion with Todd and Mary. Informed of his son's upcoming wedding in a newspaper, Donny arrives at Cape Cod. Todd, who did not expect the visit, pretends Donny is an old friend, and his father's popularity with the guests annoys him. He initially refuses to see his mother, but after Donny convinces Jamie's family to have the wedding rehearsal away from churches and Todd's friends to have the bachelor party at a strip club, Todd reconciles with him and agrees to the prison meeting. However, as a television crew arrives to film in the middle of Todd and Mary's encounter, Todd leaves in disgust without signing a release form.\n\nDonny then finds out Jamie is having affairs with Steve and her brother, Chad, which she hides by giving Todd a cover story and [[hush money|paying]] Donny $50,000 to not tell anyone. However, Donny feels guilty for withholding the truth, and he disrupts the wedding to reveal his bloodline relation to Todd and Jamie's [[infidelity]] and [[incest]]. Todd breaks up with her, accepts Donny as his father, quits his job, and reclaims his birth name, Han Solo. Han later begins dating strip worker Brie and offers Donny the money, but Donny declines, insisting on taking responsibility for his actions. While preparing to go to prison to rekindle his relationship with Mary after his sentence is over, the bet he placed on the marathon wins him $160,000, satisfying the IRS.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Donny Berger, Todd's father\n** Justin Weaver as young Donny Berger\n* [[Andy Samberg]] as Han Solo Berger/Todd Peterson, Donny and Mary's son\n* [[Leighton Meester]] as Jamie, Todd's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Vanilla Ice]] as himself, Donny's best friend\n* [[James Caan]] as Father McNally\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Chad, Jamie's younger brother\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Gerald, Jamie and Chad's father\n* [[Meagen Fay]] as Helen, Jamie and Chad's mother\n* [[Tony Orlando]] as Steve Spirou, Todd's boss\n* [[Will Forte]] as Phil\n* [[Rachel Dratch]] as Phil's wife\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Kenny\n* [[Peggy Stewart (actress)|Peggy Stewart]] as Grandma Delores, Steve's mother\n* [[Luenell]] as Champale, a stripper and Brie's mother\n* [[Ciara]] as Brie, a bartender and Donny's friend, Todd's secondary love interest\n* [[Ana Gasteyer]] as Mrs. Ravensdale\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Mary McGarricle (present day), Donny's middle school teacher/lover and Todd's mother\n** [[Eva Amurri|Eva Amurri Martino]] as Mary McGarricle\n* [[Todd Bridges]] as Himself\n* [[Dan Patrick (sportscaster)|Dan Patrick]] as Randall Morgan\n* [[Rex Ryan]] as Jim Nance\n* [[Jackie Sandler]] as Masseuse\n* [[Erin Andrews]] as Randall Morgan's receptionist\n* [[Peter Dante]] as Dante Spirou, Steve's son\n* [[Alan Thicke]] as TV version Donny's dad\n* [[Ian Ziering]] as TV version Donny\n* [[Colin Quinn]] as Strip club DJ\n* [[Baron Davis]] as Gym coach\n* [[Dennis Dugan]] as School janitor\n* [[Koji Kataoka]] as Butler\n* [[Nancy Yee]] as Maid\n}}\n\nCredits adapted from ''[[TV Guide]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/thats-my-boy/cast/2000150828/|title=That's My Boy - Full Cast & Crew|access-date=March 29, 2021|magazine=TV Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally titled ''I Hate You, Dad'', and then changed to ''Donny's Boy'' before the producers finally settled on ''That's My Boy''.<ref name=\"title change\">{{cite web|url=http://www.movieswithbutter.com/blogs/adam-sandlers-upcoming-comedy-donnys-boy-changed-thats-my-boy-207648|last=Ngo|first=Binh|title=Adam Sandler's Upcoming Comedy 'Donny's Boy' Changed to 'That's My Boy'|work=Movies with Butter|access-date=February 28, 2012|date=February 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Eisenberg|first=Eric|title=Adam Sandler Comedy I Hate You, Dad Retitled Donny's Boy, First Image Arrives Online|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Adam-Sandler-Comedy-I-Hate-You-Dad-Retitled-Donny-Boy-First-Image-Arrives-Online-28877.html|work=Cinema Blend|access-date=January 19, 2012|date= January 16, 2011}}</ref> Filming began on May 2, 2011, and ended on July 15, 2011.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}\n\nFilming took place in [[Massachusetts]], with studio filming at [[Columbia Studios|Columbia Pictures]] in [[Culver City, California]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2012/03/01/adam-sandler-and-andy-samberg-local-movie-gets-new-name-and-nsfw-trailer/TBVsv4vF0oXlBleJP8UqEL/story.html|title=Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg's local movie gets a new name and a NSFW trailer|first1=Mark|last1=Shanahan|first2=Meredith|last2=Goldstein|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 2, 2012|access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''That's My Boy'' opened on June 15, 2012, grossing $13,453,714 in its opening weekend, ranking #4 behind the second weekends of ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' and ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'', and the opening of ''[[Rock of Ages (2012 film)|Rock of Ages]]''.\n\nThe film grossed $36.9 million in the US and $57.7 million worldwide, failing to recoup its $57\u201370 million budget, making it a [[box-office bomb|financial failure]].<ref name=\"numbers\" /><ref name=\"mojo\">{{mojo title|ihateyoudad|That's My Boy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Christopher|title='That's My Boy' Box Office: Adam Sandler Comedy Bombs, Tom Cruise's 'Rock Of Ages' Disappoints|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/16/thats-my-boy-rock-of-ages-box-office-bombs_n_1602470.html?ref=topbar|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=June 17, 2012|date=June 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''That's My Boy'' has an approval rating of 20% based on 115 reviews and an average rating of 3.80/10.
