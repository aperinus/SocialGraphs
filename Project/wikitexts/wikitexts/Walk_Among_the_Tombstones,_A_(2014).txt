It stars [[Liam Neeson]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[David Harbour]], and [[Boyd Holbrook]]. The film was released on September 19, 2014. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $62 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nEight years previously, Detective [[Matthew Scudder|Matthew \"Matt\" Scudder]], in a car with his partner, is urged to get help and is told he is not a reliable backup. Scudder then enters a bar and gets coffee with shots. Two armed men come in and kill the bartender. Scudder shoots one, pursues and kills the second assailant, and the getaway driver.\n\nIn New York of 1999, a drug addict named Peter Kristo approaches a retired Scudder, asking him to help his brother Kenny, a drug trafficker. Kenny tells Scudder that his wife was kidnapped and her kidnappers demanded a ransom. After he delivered the ransom as instructed, the kidnappers directed him to a car containing her dismembered body. Kenny asks Scudder to help him find his wife\u2019s killers. Scudder ultimately agrees to help him.\n\nScudder researches similar killings at a public library. He reads about victims Marie Gotteskind and Leila Andresen. He meets TJ, a homeless streetwise youth. TJ helps with the research.\n\nBased on an article, Scudder goes to a cemetery and speaks with a groundskeeper, Jonas Loogan, upset that Scudder reminds him of finding trash bags with body parts of the dismembered Leila in the cemetery pond.\n\nScudder talks to Leila's fianc\u00e9, Reuben, who saw two men drag her into a van driven by a third. Across the street, Scudder sees Loogan exiting an apartment building. He goes up into the rooftop and finds a shed, where Loogan is living. He sees polaroid photos of Reuben and Leila having sex. Loogan arrives and admits that he helped kidnap Leila. He had conspired to take Leila away from Reuben, who is a drug dealer, and help her stop using drugs. Instead, the other two tortured and killed her. He tells Scudder that he should be scared of the other two men because \u201cthey\u2019re not human.\u201d He feeds his pigeons, gives Scudder one name, \"Ray,\" and then he jumps off the roof to his death.\n\nThe two kidnappers, Ray and Albert, surveil the home of Yuri Landau, another drug trafficker. After realizing Landau's wife is bedridden, they prepare to leave for a new target. However, they see his 14-year-old daughter, Lucia, and Ray decides to kidnap her.\n\nScudder eventually learns that the victim Marie Gotteskind was a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent and  determines that whoever murdered her also has her files, which they have been using to target drug dealers and traffickers. Meanwhile, Scudder grows closer to TJ, encouraging the boy to study and avoid a life of crime. He finds him in a hospital one day after a street gang beat down and learns that TJ has [[sickle cell anemia]]. Scudder gives him a phone so that TJ can reach him if he needs anything. During a conversation with TJ, Scudder explains why he retired. During the shootout in 1991, he was intoxicated. One of his stray bullets \"took a bad hop\" and hit a 7-year-old girl in the eye, instantly killing her. Even though he received a commendation, he quit his job as a cop and he gave up alcohol.\n\nKenny brings Scudder to Yuri Landau's home, where the kidnappers call and arrange to exchange ransom for Lucia at a cemetery. They demand $1 million, and in exchange, Scudder demand that they bring Lucia alive and well. Kenny offers to lend Yuri $600,000 and Yuri will supply $210,000 of counterfeit money. Scudder, Kenny, Landau, Peter, and TJ drive to the cemetery. Scudder orders TJ to stay in the car. After a stand off, Lucia, alive but with two fingers cut down to the bone, is returned to her father. Albert inspects the money and discovers some were counterfeit. A shootout ensues. Peter is killed, and Scudder wounds Ray. Albert and Ray escape in their van, with TJ hiding in the back.\n\nAfter Albert and Ray arrive at their place, TJ sneaks out of the van. He tells Scudder their address. Albert betrays the wounded Ray by strangling him to death with a metal wire while in the basement. Scudder and Kenny find TJ outside the house and they all silently enter the house finding Albert calmly eating his dinner. Albert surrenders and Scudder cuffs him. Kenny wants to kill him but Scudder talks him down, seeing how TJ is in the room and is watching everything. Scudder reminds Kenny that there is enough evidence to put Albert behind bars for the rest of his life. Kenny reluctantly agrees. Scudder leaves Kenny alone with Albert while he puts TJ in a taxi to his apartment. Kenny knocks Albert unconscious with a bottle. He goes into the basement where he finds Ray\u2019s body and tools used for dismembering bodies. While Kenny is downstairs, Albert wakes up.\n\nScudder goes back inside the house and finds Albert gone. He goes down the basement and sees Kenny's dead body on the stairs (implying that Albert killed Kenny). Albert suddenly tries to strangle him from behind with a metal wire. After a table-turning fight, Scudder overpowers and tasers Albert. He eventually kills him with a gunshot to the head. A while later, police arrive at the crime scene with Scudder observing from afar.\n\nScudder returns home to find TJ sleeping on the couch and spots a drawing that TJ made of himself as a superhero, with a sickle on his costume representing his sickle cell anemia.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Matthew Scudder]]\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Kenny Kristo\n* [[Boyd Holbrook]] as Peter Kristo\n* [[\u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson]] as Jonas Loogan\n* [[Astro (rapper)|Brian \"Astro\" Bradley]] as TJ\n* [[Mark Consuelos]] as Reuben Quintana\n* [[David Harbour]] as Ray\n* [[Adam David Thompson]] as Albert\n* [[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]] as Yuri Landau\n* [[Laura Birn]] as Leila Andresen\n* [[Razane Jammal]] as Carrie Kristo\n* [[Leon Addison Brown]] as Stover\n* [[Danielle Rose Russell]] as Lucia\n* [[Marielle Heller]] as Marie Gotteskind\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Development==\nA [[film adaptation]] of [[Lawrence Block|Block]]\u2019s novel had been in development for several years with a script from [[Scott Frank]].
