Based on [[C.D. Payne]]'s [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] novel of [[Youth in Revolt|the same name]], the film stars [[Michael Cera]] and [[Portia Doubleday]], with [[Justin Long]], [[Ray Liotta]], and [[Steve Buscemi]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film follows shy and lonely teenager Nick (Cera) desperate to lose his virginity. While on a trailer park holiday with his mother and her boyfriend, he meets an attractive girl (Doubleday) and is immediately smitten. When the two are separated Nick must learn how to rebel in order to be with the girl he loves.\n\n==Plot==\nShy teenager Nick Twisp lives with his mother, Estelle, and her boyfriend, Jerry, in [[Oakland, California]]. After selling a faulty car to a group of sailors, Jerry takes Estelle and Nick to a trailer park in [[Clearlake, California|Clearlake]] where Nick meets Sheeni Saunders, a young woman his age, interested in [[French culture]] and sharing Nick's musical taste. Despite her boyfriend, Trent Preston, they become romantically involved. Nick gets a dog for her named Albert (after [[Albert Camus]]), but Albert rips up the family's property and Sheeni's parents ban it from the house.\n\nBefore Nick returns to Oakland, Sheeni promises to arrange a job in [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]] for Nick's father, George, while Nick agrees to get his mother to kick him out so he can return to Sheeni. In Oakland, Nick creates an [[alter-ego]] named Fran\u00e7ois Dillinger, a suave, rebellious troublemaker. Immediately after, Jerry dies of a heart attack.\n\nUnder Fran\u00e7ois' influence, Nick mouths off to his mom and her new boyfriend, police officer Lance Wescott. Nick takes Jerry's [[Lincoln Continental|Lincoln]], and crashes into a restaurant, starting a fire. Lance agrees to lie and report the car stolen in return for living with his father. In Ukiah, Nick phones Sheeni and tells her he blew up \"half of Berkeley\" to return. Her mother overhears this and ships her to a French boarding school in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], forbidding Nick ever to see her again.\n\nNick befriends Vijay Joshi, and they take Vijay's grandmother's car to visit Sheeni. They sneak into Sheeni's room, Nick meets Bernice in the bathroom, and he claims Trent said terrible things about her. Later, Bernice brings the matron to the room and the boys flee. On the way home, the car dies and Nick calls Mr. Ferguson, his father's idealist neighbor, to pick them up; telling Ferguson that Vijay is an illegal immigrant whom Nick is trying to \"free from persecution\".\n\nWhen he returns home, Nick meets Sheeni's older brother, Paul, who tells him that she will be returning home at Thanksgiving and invites him. Nick sends Bernice letters asking her to slip sedatives into Sheeni's drinks to make her sleep in class, getting Sheeni expelled. Nick finds Lacey, George's 25-year-old girlfriend, Paul, and Ferguson, in his living room, high on mushrooms, and Nick joins them. When George finds them he punches Ferguson, and Paul punches George. Lacey leaves the house to live with Paul. On Thanksgiving Day, Nick receives a call from his mother explaining Lance left and will not cover for him anymore. Then, at Sheeni's, Trent unexpectedly arrives and tells them about Nick's letters to Bernice; Sheeni is horrified and Nick leaves.\n\nNick steals his father's car to escape the police, then removes his clothes and drives the car into a shallow lake in front of the police station. He gets a wig and dress to impersonate one of Sheeni's \"friends\". He fools Mr. and Mrs. Saunders, going up to Sheeni's room. Upstairs, Nick tells Sheeni that he understands what loneliness is like, and that everything he has done (burning down Berkeley, destroying his parents' cars and having her sedated) was all so that they wouldn't have to be alone anymore. Sheeni forgives Nick, and they have sex, finally achieving Nick's dream of losing his virginity. Trent barges in, telling them he's brought the police. Nick and Trent fight until the police comes to arrest Nick.  Nick asks Sheeni to wait for him; she reassures him that he will only be in juvenile detention for three months.\n\nThe animated closing credits show Nick in jail with Fran\u00e7ois helping him. When Nick is released, Sheeni shows up in a car and they drive away into the sky towards the Paris skyline, as various characters appear to make amends and give them their blessing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Cera]] as Nick Twisp/Fran\u00e7ois Dillinger\n* [[Portia Doubleday]] as Sheeni Saunders\n* [[Jean Smart]] as Estelle Twisp\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Jerry\n* [[Erik Knudsen]] as Lefty\n* [[Adhir Kalyan]] as Vijay Joshi\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as George Twisp\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mr. Ferguson\n* [[Ari Graynor]] as Lacey\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Lance Wescott\n* [[Justin Long]] as Paul Saunders\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Taggarty\n* Jade Fusco as Bernice Lynch\n* [[M.
