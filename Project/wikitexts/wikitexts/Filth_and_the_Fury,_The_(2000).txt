It follows the story of [[punk rock]] pioneers the [[Sex Pistols]] from their humble beginnings in London's Shepherd's Bush to their fall at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. It is considered a continuation of Temple's first documentary centered on the band, titled ''[[The Great Rock and Roll Swindle]],'' but acts as an opportunity for the surviving members of the group to tell their side of the story.\n\n==Description==\n''The Filth and the Fury'' is the second movie [[Julien Temple]] made about [[The Sex Pistols]]. His first effort was ''[[The Great Rock and Roll Swindle]]'', which was released in British cinemas on 15 May 1980. This earlier effort was heavily criticised for being too skewed towards the Pistols' manager [[Malcolm McLaren]]'s version of events about the band.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} ''The Filth and the Fury'' tells the story from the viewpoint of the band members themselves (albeit in silhouette during their contemporary interviews).\n\nThe title of the film is a reference to a headline that appeared in the British tabloid newspaper ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' on 2 December 1976 after [[Sex Pistols#EMI and the Bill Grundy incident|an interview]] on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''Today'' presented by [[Bill Grundy]]. The title of ''The Daily Mirror'' article was itself inspired by [[William Faulkner]]'s novel ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' which was in turn taken from a line in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Macbeth]].\n\nTemple's documentary narrates the rise, decline and fall of the Sex Pistols from their humble beginnings in London's [[Shepherd's Bush]] to their disintegration at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in [[San Francisco]]. Temple puts the band into historical context with Britain's social situation in the 1970s through archival footage from the period.  This film was seen in some ways as an opportunity for the Pistols to tell their perspective of the story mostly through interviews with the surviving members of the group, footage shot during the era, and outtakes from ''The Great Rock and Roll Swindle''.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack to the film was released in 2002. The two-disc set contains songs by the Sex Pistols as well as music from other artists that was used in the film.\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n;Disc one\n#\"God Save the Queen (Symphony)\"\n#\"[[Shang-a-Lang (song)|Shang-a-Lang]]\" \u2013 [[Bay City Rollers]]\n#\"[[Pictures of Lily]]\" \u2013 [[The Who]]\n#\"[[Virginia Plain]]\" \u2013 [[Roxy Music]]\n#\"[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]\" \u2013 [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]]\n#\"Skinhead Moonstomp\" \u2013 [[Symarip]]\n#\"Glass of Champagne\" \u2013 [[Sailor (band)|Sailor]]\n#\"Through My Eyes\" \u2013 [[The Creation (band)|The Creation]]\n#\"[[The Jean Genie]]\" \u2013 [[David Bowie]]\n#\"[[I'm Eighteen]]\" \u2013 [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]]\n#\"Submission\"\n#\"Don't Gimme No Lip Child\"\n#\"What'cha Gonna Do About It\"\n#\"[[Roadrunner (Jonathan Richman song)|Road Runner]]\"\n#\"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\"\n#\"Seventeen\"\n\n;Disc two\n#\"[[Anarchy in the UK]]\"\n#\"[[Pretty Vacant]]\"\n#\"Did You No Wrong\"\n#\"Liar\"\n#\"EMI\"\n#\"No Feelings\"\n#\"I Wanna Be Me\"\n#\"Way Over (In Dub)\" \u2013 [[Tapper Zukie]]\n#\"Looking for a Kiss\" \u2013 [[New York Dolls]]\n#\"[[Holidays in the Sun (song)|Holidays in the Sun]]\"\n#\"[[No Fun (The Stooges song)|No Fun]]\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Sid and Nancy]]''\n* ''[[The Great Rock and Roll Swindle]]''\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0236216|title=The Filth and the Fury}}\n* {{rotten tomatoes|filth_and_the_fury}}\n* [https://archive.today/20130105045140/http://www.themightyorgan.com/features_filth.html The Sex Pistols on Film]\n* [http://www.classictrailers.co.uk/grundy.html Video of Bill Grundy's interview] with the [[Sex Pistols]]\n* [http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/ Sex Pistols fansite]\n\n{{Sex Pistols|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Julien Temple}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''The Filth and the Fury''\n|list =\n{{Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary}}\n{{Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Filth and the Fury, The}}\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:British documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about punk music and musicians]]\n[[Category:Film4 Productions films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Julien Temple]]\n[[Category:Sex Pistols video albums]]\n[[Category:Sex Pistols compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2000 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Sex Pistols soundtracks]]\n[[Category:2000 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:2000 soundtrack albums]]\n[[Category:Film soundtracks]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
