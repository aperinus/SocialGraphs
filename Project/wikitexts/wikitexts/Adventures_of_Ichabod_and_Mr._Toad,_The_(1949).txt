The [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|11th animated film in the Disney Animation canon]], it consists of two segments: the first based on the 1908 children's novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' by British author [[Kenneth Grahame]], and the second based on the 1820 short story \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\" by American author [[Washington Irving]].\n\nThe film is the last of the studio's package film era of the 1940s, following ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'' (1942), ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1944), ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' (1946), ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'' (1947), and ''[[Melody Time]]'' (1948). Disney would not produce another package film until ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' in March 1977.\n\nBeginning in 1955, the two portions of the film were separated, and televised as part of the ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series#Walt Disney's Disneyland (1954\u20131958)|Disneyland]]'' television series. They were later marketed and sold separately on home video.\n\n''The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad'' is the only Disney film to star [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Bing Crosby]].\n\n== Segments ==\nAs the film's animated segments are based on literary works, they are both introduced in live-action scenes set in a library as a [[Frame story|framing device]]. The first segment is introduced and narrated by [[Basil Rathbone]], and the second segment is introduced and narrated by [[Bing Crosby]]. [[Decca Records]] issued an album called ''[[Ichabod \u2013 The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' featuring Bing Crosby in 1949 to tie in with the release of the film.\n\n=== ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' ===\nThis segment is based on the novel by [[Kenneth Grahame]]. The story is set in and around [[London]], England, [[United Kingdom]] between June 10, 1907 and January 1, 1908. The protagonist [[Mr. Toad|J. Thaddeus Toad, Esq.]] is introduced as an \"incurable adventurer\" who \"never counted the cost\". As the story's \"one disturbing element\", although he is the wealthy proprietor of the Toad Hall estate, Toad's adventures and \"positive [[mania]] for fads\" have brought him to the brink of bankruptcy. As a last resort, Toad's friend Angus MacBadger volunteers as Toad's [[bookkeeping|bookkeeper]] to help Toad keep his estate which is a source of pride in the community.\n\nOne summer day, MacBadger asks Toad's best friends Ratty (a [[European water vole|water rat]]) and Moley (a [[European mole|mole]]) to persuade Toad to give up his latest mania of recklessly driving about the countryside in a horse and gypsy cart, which could accumulate a great deal of financial liability in damaged property. Ratty and Moley confront Toad, but are unable to change his mind. Toad then sees a [[Brass Era car|motor car]] for the first time and becomes entranced by the new machine, having been taken over by \"motor-mania\".\n\nTo cure Toad's new mania, Ratty and Moley put Toad under house arrest. However, Toad escapes and is later arrested and charged with [[Motor vehicle theft|car theft]]. At his trial, Toad [[Litigant in person|represents himself]] and calls his horse Cyril Proudbottom as his first witness. Cyril testifies that the car which Toad was accused of stealing had already been stolen by a gang of weasels. Toad had entered a [[tavern]] where the car was parked and offered to buy the car from the weasels. However, since Toad had no money, he instead offered to trade Toad Hall for the car. The prosecutor and judge show disbelief toward the statement, so Toad then calls the bartender Mr. Winkie as a witness to the agreement; however, when told by Toad to explain what actually happened, Mr. Winkie claims instead that Toad had tried to sell him the stolen car. Toad is found guilty on the spot and sentenced to 20 years in the [[Tower of London]]. As the months passed by, Toad's friends make every effort to appeal his case, but to no avail.\n\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], Cyril visits Toad in disguise as his [[grandmother]] and helps him escape by giving him a [[disguise]] of his own. Toad quickly runs to a railway station and hijacks a [[steam locomotive]] and drives out of the station heading toward the river bank without getting caught by the police on another train, coming to Ratty and Moley's house. Just then, MacBadger vists Ratty and Moley to tell them that he discovered that Mr. Winkie is the leader of the weasel gang, and that Toad had indeed traded his estate for the stolen car; Mr. Winkie himself is in possession of the deed. Knowing that the deed bearing Toad and Mr. Winkie's signature would prove Toad's innocence, the four friends sneak into Toad Hall and take the document after a grueling chase around the estate.\n\nThe film then ends on [[New Year's Day]] with Toad exonerated and regaining his house while it is implied that Mr. Winkie and the weasels have been arrested and imprisoned.  As MacBadger, Ratty, and Moley celebrate the New Year with a toast to Toad, who they believe has completely reformed, Toad and Cyril recklessly fly past on a 1903 [[Wright Flyer]]; Toad has not truly reformed and has developed a mania for [[airplane]]s.\n\n=== ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' ===\nThe second segment is based on the original story by [[Washington Irving]]. Although the film introduces the story as ''Ichabod Crane'', later individual releases retained the story's original title. (As a short story, \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" was originally published in ''[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.|The Sketch Book]]'' with other stories, not as a single volume as pictured in the film.)\n\nIn October 1790, [[Ichabod Crane]], a lanky, [[superstitious]] yet charming [[dandy]] arrives in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], a small village outside [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] that is renowned for its ghostly hauntings, to be the town's new schoolmaster. Despite his odd behavior, appearance, and [[effeminate]] mannerisms, Ichabod soon wins the hearts of the village's women and forms good friendships with his students. Brom Bones, the roguish town hero, does his best to pull pranks to Ichabod. However, he is very good at ignoring these taunts and continues to interact with the townspeople. One day, Ichabod meets and falls in love with Katrina van Tassel, the beautiful daughter of the wealthy Baltus van Tassel and Brom's unofficial fiancee. Despite being obsessed with Katrina's beauty, Ichabod mainly desires to take her family's money for himself. Brom, who has never been challenged like this, proceeds to compete with the schoolmaster, but Ichabod wins Katrina over at every opportunity. Unbeknownst to both men, Katrina is only using Ichabod to make Brom jealous and force him to try harder for her affections.\n\nThe two love rivals are invited to the van Tassel [[Halloween]] party. Brom attempts to get Ichabod to dance with a plump woman instead of Katrina, and later attempts to have him fall through a cellar door, but both attempts backfire. While both men dine, Brom catches Ichabod accidentally knocking the salt shaker over and nervously tossing salt over his shoulder. Discovering that Ichabod's weakness is [[superstition]], he decides to sing the tale of the legendary [[Headless Horseman]]. The horseman supposedly travels the woods on Halloween each year, searching for a living head to replace the one which he has lost, and the only way to escape the ghost is to cross a covered bridge. Everyone else, including Katrina, finds the song amusing, while Ichabod on the other hand starts to fear for his life.\n\nRiding home from the party, Ichabod becomes frightened of every sound and sight which he hears in the dark woods. While traveling through the [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow|old cemetery]], Ichabod believes he hears the sound of a horse galloping toward him, but discovers the sound is being made by nearby [[typha|cattails]] bumping on a log. He and his horse begin to laugh \u2013 however, their laughter is cut short by the appearance of the [[Headless Horseman]], wielding a sword and riding on the back of a black horse. After being chased through the dark forest, Ichabod, remembering Brom's advice, rides across the covered bridge to stop the ghost's pursuit. The horseman stops and throws his flaming head, revealed to be a [[jack-o'-lantern]], right at Ichabod's face.\n\nThe next morning, Ichabod's hat is found at the bridge next to the shattered jack-o-lantern, but Ichabod himself is nowhere to be found. Sometime later, Brom takes Katrina as his wife. Rumors begin to spread that Ichabod is still alive, married to a wealthy [[widow]] in a distant county with children who all look like him. However, the superstitious people of Sleepy Hollow insist that he has been \"spirited away\" by the Headless Horseman.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n===''The Wind in the Willows''===\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Eric Blore]] as J.

Bodrero and Grant felt that ''The Wind in the Willows'', with its anthropomorphized animals, could only be produced using animation. To persuade Disney to approve the film, Bodrero and Grant prepared a [[Leica reel]], which combined storyboard stills with rough dialogue performed by members of the animation staff. Disney was skeptical, however, and felt it would be \"awful corny\",<ref name=\"michaelbarrier.com\">{{cite interview|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/Bodrero/Bodrero_interview.html|title=James Bodero Interview|interviewer=Milton Gray|website=michaelbarrier.com|access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> but acquired the rights in April that year.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=283}} The film was intended to be a single narrative feature film with the title of the same name.\n\nAfter some delays due to story rewrites, [[James Algar]] was appointed to direct the film. By April 1941, work on ''The Wind in the Willows'' had begun as animators and writers had come off from ''[[Bambi]]'', which was nearly complete.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=280}} When the [[Disney animators' strike]] was finished in October 1941, [[Joseph Rosenberg]] of the [[Bank of America]] issued an ultimatum in which he would permit an absolute loan limit of $3.5 million, and in return, he ordered the studio to restrict itself to producing animation shorts and to finish features already in production\u2014''[[Dumbo]]'', ''Bambi'', and ''The Wind in the Willows''\u2014but no other feature film would begin work until they had been released and earned back their costs. In response, the studio's feature film production, including early versions of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', were heavily scaled back while ''The Wind in the Willows'' was kept in production as animation work had already begun.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=376}} However, after reviewing the animation footage, Disney decided to shelve the project deciding that \"the quality was too far below the standard necessary to be successful on the market.\"{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=309}}\n\n''The Wind in the Willows'' resumed production in 1946. Following his military service in [[World War II]], animator [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] was assigned to direct additional footage for ''Wind in the Willows'' alongside James Algar in hopes of salvaging the project. Under Disney's strict orders, the film was shortened down to a length of 25 minutes.<ref>{{cite interview|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/ThomasJohnston1987/ThomasJohnston1987.html|title=Interviews: Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston (1987)|interviewer=Michael Barrier|website=michaelbarrier.com|date=November 21, 2014|access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> However, the project was shelved again following layoffs in August 1946.{{sfn|Barrier|2008|p=199}} Meanwhile, in December 1946, Disney started production on a new animated feature film, an adaptation of [[Washington Irving]]'s \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\", which was to be co-directed by [[Jack Kinney]] and [[Clyde Geronimi]].<ref>{{cite interview|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/Geronimi/Geronimi.html|title=Interviews: Gerry Geronimi|interviewer=Michael Barrier|website=michaelbarrier.com|date=March 16, 2015|access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAround this same time, there were plans developed to combine ''The Wind in the Willows'' with ''The Legend of Happy Valley'' and ''[[The Gremlins]]'', an original story developed by author [[Roald Dahl]], into a package film titled ''Three Fabulous Characters''. When ''The Gremlins'' failed to materialize, the title was changed to ''Two Fabulous Characters''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/11/17/archives/disney-announces-two-new-projects-melody-time-to-be-released-in.html |title=Disney Announces Two New Projects |work=The New York Times |page=27 |date=November 17, 1947 |access-date=January 30, 2022 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> Then, ''The Legend of Happy Valley'' was cut from the project in favor of pairing it with ''Bongo'' in which the two shorts were incorporated under the title ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'', which was eventually released in 1947.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Story Behind Fun and Fancy Free|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k58ee1JfIM |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/5k58ee1JfIM|archive-date=2021-12-12|url-status=live|year=1997|type=Documentary film|format=VHS|via=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Walt Disney Home Video}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In late 1947, Disney decided to pair ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' with ''The Wind in the Willows'' into a singular package film as neither part was long enough to be a feature film.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=394}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=458}} The new film was later given its final title ''The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad''.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=518}} In March 1948, it was reported that [[Bing Crosby]] had signed on to provide narration for the ''Sleepy Hollow'' segment, while [[Basil Rathbone]] signed on to providing the narration for ''The Wind in the Willows'' segment.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brady |first=Thomas F. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1948/03/01/archives/crosby-and-disney-close-movie-deal-actor-will-record-narration-sing.html |title=Crosby and Disney Close Deal |work=The New York Times |page=17 |date=March 1, 1948 |access-date=January 30, 2022 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Songs==\n\n===''The Wind in the Willows''===\n\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing     = \n| all_lyrics      = [[Larry Morey]] & [[Ray Gilbert]]\n| all_music       = [[Frank Churchill]] & [[Charles Wolcott]]\n| extra_column    = Performer(s)\n\n| title1          = The Merrily Song\n| extra1          = [[Eric Blore]] & [[J.

When first released on home video, the segments retained their names from the ''Disneyland'' series (''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' and ''The Wind in the Willows'', respectively), having taken their names from the original stories.\n\nSome of the scenes were cut when the segments were split up for home video release. For example:\n\n* '''''The Wind in the Willows'''''\n** Part of the introduction was cut because of the new music added.\n** The scene where Angus MacBadger confronts the angry townspeople who are suing Toad.\n** The newspaper scene regarding Toad's disgrace was shortened by removing the newspaper articles of his friends' attempts to reopen his case.\n** When Toad realizes he is underwater after unknowingly jumping into a river to elude the police pursuing him, there is a brief full-body scene of Toad frantically trying to pull out the ball-and-chain he is shackled to out of the floor of the river.\n* '''''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'''''\n** The only thing that was cut was the introduction in the bookcases.\n\n=== Home media ===\n''The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad'' received its first complete home video release in the UK in 1991 and in the US in 1992, when it was released by [[Walt Disney Home Video]] on VHS and [[LaserDisc]]. A subsequent complete release on VHS followed in 1999 as the last title in the ''Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection'' line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/masterpiece/shelves/icbdtoad/index.html|title=The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991008160450/http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/masterpiece/shelves/icbdtoad/index.html|website=[[Go.com|Disney.go.com]]|archive-date=October 8, 1999|access-date=January 29, 2022|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2000, it appeared on DVD for the first time as part of the ''Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection'' line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID10001170.asp|title=Walt Disney Home Video Debuts the \"Gold Classic Collection\"|website=The Laughing Place|access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 1963 theatrical version of ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' was released on VHS in 1982, 1990, and 1994.
