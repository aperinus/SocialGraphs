The screenplay by [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]], inspired by [[David Pinner]]'s 1967 novel ''[[Ritual (1967 novel)|Ritual]]'', centres on the visit of Police Sergeant Neil Howie to the isolated [[Scotland|Scottish]] island of Summerisle in search of a missing girl. Howie, a devout Christian, is appalled to find that the inhabitants of the island have abandoned [[Christianity]] and now practise a form of [[Ancient Celtic religion|Celtic paganism]].<ref name=\"Grdn\"/> [[Paul Giovanni]] composed the film score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bac941d|title=The Wicker Man (1973)}}</ref><ref name=\"The Wicker Man 1973\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/95785/The-Wicker-Man/full-credits.html|title=The Wicker Man 1973|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|access-date=11 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n''The Wicker Man'' is well-regarded by critics. Film magazine ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' described it as \"The ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of horror movies\", and in 2004, ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine named ''The Wicker Man'' the sixth greatest British film of all time. It also won the 1978 [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]]. The final scene was No. 45 on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]'s ''[[100 Scariest Movie Moments]]'', and during the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] it was included as part of a sequence that celebrated British cinema.

In 2006, a poorly-received<ref>''The Wicker Man'' (2006) has a [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_wicker_man_2006/ 15% rating] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].</ref> [[The Wicker Man (2006 film)|American remake]] was released, from which Hardy and others involved with the original have dissociated themselves. In 2011, a [[Spiritual successor|spiritual sequel]] directed by Hardy, ''[[The Wicker Tree]]'', was released and featured Lee in a cameo appearance. In 2013, the original U.S. theatrical version of ''The Wicker Man'' was digitally restored and released.\n\n==Plot==\nPolice Sergeant Neil Howie journeys by [[seaplane]] to the remote [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] island Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison, about whom he has received an anonymous letter. Howie, a devout [[Christianity|Christian]], is disturbed to find the Islanders paying homage to the [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Celts|Celtic]] gods of their ancestors. They copulate openly in the fields, include children as part of the [[May Day#United Kingdom|May Day celebrations]], teach children of the phallic association of the [[maypole]], and place toads in their mouths to cure sore throats. The islanders appear to be trying to thwart his investigation by claiming that Rowan never existed.\n\nWhile staying at the [[Green Man]] Inn, Howie notices a series of photographs celebrating the annual harvest, each featuring a young girl as the [[May Queen]]. The photograph of the most recent celebration is missing; the landlord tells him it was broken. At the local school, Howie asks the students about Rowan but all deny her existence. He checks the school register and finds Rowan's name. He questions the schoolteacher, who directs him to Rowan's grave.\n\nHowie meets the island's leader, Lord Summerisle, grandson of a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Agronomy|agronomist]], to get permission for an exhumation. Summerisle explains that his grandfather developed strains of fruit trees that would prosper in [[Climate of Scotland|Scotland's climate]] and encouraged the belief that the old gods would use the new strains to bring prosperity to the island among the pagan population. Due to the bountiful harvests, the island's other inhabitants gradually embraced [[paganism]].\n\nExhuming the grave, Howie finds that the coffin contains only the [[Carrion|carcass]] of a hare. He also finds the missing harvest photograph, showing Rowan standing amidst empty boxes; the harvest had failed. His research reveals that a human sacrifice is offered to the gods in the event of crop failure. He concludes that Rowan is alive and will soon be sacrificed to ensure a successful harvest. Seeking assistance from the mainland, Howie returns to his seaplane to discover it no longer functions and its radio is damaged; he cannot leave or call for help. Later that day during the May Day celebration, Howie subdues the innkeeper and steals his costume and mask (that of [[Punch and Judy|Punch]], the fool) to infiltrate the parade. Rowan is eventually revealed. Howie sets her free and flees with her into a cave. Exiting it, they are intercepted by the islanders, to whom Rowan happily returns.\n\nSummerisle tells Howie that Rowan was never the intended sacrifice: Howie is. He fits their gods' four requirements: he came of his own free will, has \"the power of a king\" (by representing the Law), is a virgin, and is a \"fool\". Howie warns Summerisle and the islanders that the crops are failing due to the unsuitability of the climate and that the villagers will turn on Summerisle and sacrifice him next summer when the next harvest fails again but his pleas are ignored. The villagers force Howie inside a giant [[wicker man]] statue along with various animals, set it ablaze and surround it, singing the [[Middle English]] folk song \"[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]\". Inside the wicker man, Howie recites [[Psalm 23]], and prays to God before cursing the islanders as he and the animals burn to death. The head of the wicker man collapses in flames, revealing the setting sun.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Edward Woodward]] as Sgt.

Lee wanted to break free of this image and take on more interesting acting roles. The idea for ''The Wicker Man'' film began in 1971 when Lee met with screenwriter [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]], and they agreed to work together.<ref>[https://www.steve-p.org/wm/ THE VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE WICKER MAN]</ref> Film director [[Robin Hardy (film director)|Robin Hardy]] and [[British Lion Films|British Lion]] head [[Peter Snell (producer)|Peter Snell]] became involved in the project.

Pinner originally wrote ''Ritual'' as a film treatment for director [[Michael Winner]], who had [[John Hurt]] in mind as a possible star.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wicker-man.com/trivia.php|title=Wicker Man Trivia|publisher=Wicker-Man.com|access-date=11 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210205628/http://www.wicker-man.com/trivia.php|archive-date=10 February 2012}}</ref> Winner eventually declined the project, so Pinner's agent persuaded him to write ''Ritual'' as a novel instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://b-music-collective.blogspot.com/2011/12/david-pinner-interview-cult-of-david.html|title=David Pinner Interview - The Cult of David Pinner|author=Orphan, David|publisher=B-Music Collective|date=1 December 2011|access-date=11 April 2012}}</ref> Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner \u00a315,000 for the rights to the novel, and Shaffer set to work on the screenplay.

He specifically wanted a film with a minimum of violence and gore. He was tired of seeing horror films that relied almost entirely on viscera to be scary. The focus of the film was crystallised when he \"finally hit upon the abstract concept of sacrifice.\" The image of the wicker man, which gave the filmmakers their title, was taken from the description of the practice of human sacrifice by the Gauls in [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|''Commentaries on the Gallic War'']]: \"Others have figures of vast size, the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames.\"<ref>{{cite book |last = Caesar |first = Julius |year = 1910 |title = Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic war : literally translated, with explanatory notes |publisher = Hinds & Noble |location = New York City |url = https://archive.org/details/caesarscommentar00caes/page/149/mode/2up |pages = Book VI, Chapter XVI, page 149 |quote = Others have figures of vast size, the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill with living men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames.}}</ref> For Shaffer, this was \"the most alarming and imposing image that I had ever seen.\"<ref>Lori Anderson [http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/film/lori-anderson-worship-at-the-feet-of-the-wicker-man-1-3104662 \"Worship at the feet of The Wicker Man\"], ''The Scotsman'', 21 Septemberv 2013</ref> The idea of a confrontation between a modern Christian and a remote, pagan community continued to intrigue Shaffer, who performed painstaking research on paganism.

Indeed, according to Seamus Flannery in a subsequent documentary, director Robin Hardy surprised the cast by suddenly announcing midway through filming that they were making a \"[[Musical film|musical]]\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nComposed, arranged, and recorded by [[Paul Giovanni]], and performed by [[Magnet (band)|Magnet]] (in some versions of the film credited as \"Lodestone\"), the soundtrack contains 13 folk songs performed by characters in the film. Included are traditional songs, original compositions by Giovanni, and even a nursery rhyme, \"[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep (nursery rhyme)|Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]\".\n\n\"[[Willow's Song]]\" has been covered or sampled by various rock music bands. It was first covered by the English musical project known as [[Nature and Organisation]] on their 1994 release ''Beauty Reaps the Blood of Solitude''. It was covered by [[Sneaker Pimps]] as \"How Do\", and is included on their 1996 release ''Becoming X''. \"How Do\" can be heard in the movie ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005); the song is incorrectly credited in the end titles as being composed by Sneaker Pimps. Additionally, the band has covered \"Gently Johnny\" as \"Johnny\"; it is featured as a B-side on their single \"Roll On\" (1996). It also was covered by [[Faith and the Muse]] on their 2003 album ''[[The Burning Season (album)|The Burning Season]]'', and [[The Mock Turtles]] on their album ''[[Turtle Soup]]''.\n\nThe songs on the soundtrack were composed or arranged by Giovanni under the direction of Hardy and Shaffer, whose research into the oral folk tradition in England and Scotland was based largely on the work of [[Cecil Sharp]], a 'founding father' of the folk-revival movement of the early 20th century. Using Sharp's collections as a template, Shaffer noted to Giovanni which scenes were to have music, and in some cases provided lyrics which would be appropriate to spring pagan festivals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bartholomew|first=David|date=1977|title=The Wicker Man|url=http://www.wicker-man.com/articles/cinefantastique_TWM_article_1977.pdf|journal=Cinefantastique|volume=6 |issue=3|pages=22|via=Wayback Machine|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314113156/http://www.wicker-man.com/articles/cinefantastique_TWM_article_1977.pdf|archive-date=14 March 2012}}</ref> Other songs on the soundtrack come from a later folk tradition; for example, \"Corn Riggs\", by Scotland's national bard, Robert Burns, accompanies Howie's arrival on Summerisle.

Corman recommended an additional 13&nbsp;minutes be cut from the film. (Corman did not acquire US release rights, and eventually [[Warner Bros.]] test-marketed the film in drive-ins.) In Britain, the film was ordered reduced to roughly 87&nbsp;minutes, with some narrative restructuring, and released as the [[B-movie|\"B\" picture]] on a double bill with ''[[Don't Look Now]]''. According to Lee, the cuts adversely affected the film's [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].\n\n===First restoration===\nDuring the mid-1970s, Hardy made inquiries about the film, hoping to restore it to his original vision. Along with Lee and Shaffer, Hardy searched for his original cut, or raw footage. Both of these appeared to have been lost. Director [[Alex Cox]] said in his ''[[Moviedrome]]'' introduction in 1988 that the negative had \"ended up in the pylons that support the [[M4 motorway (Great Britain)|M4 motorway]].\"<ref name=\"alexcox\">{{cite web |last=Cox |first=Alex |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8IGJjukTzc  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/K8IGJjukTzc| archive-date=11 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=Moviedrome \u2013 Wicker Man \u2013 Alex Cox intro |work=YouTube |access-date=20 February 2009}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Hardy recalled that a copy of the film made prior to Deeley's cuts was sent to Corman, who, it turned out, still had a copy, possibly the only existing print of Hardy's original cut. The US rights had been sold by Warner Bros. to a small firm called Abraxas, managed by film buff Stirling Smith and critic John Alan Simon. Stirling agreed to an American release of a reconstruction by Hardy. Hardy restored the narrative structure, some of the erotic elements which had been excised, and a very brief pre-title segment of Howie on the mainland (appearing at a church with his fianc\u00e9e). A 96-minute restored version was released in January 1979,<ref name=\"stevephilips\">{{cite web | title=The various versions of ''The Wicker Man'' | last=Philips |first=Steve |work=Steve's Web Page |year=2002 |url=http://steve-p.org/wm/ |access-date=11 December 2006}}</ref> again to critical acclaim.\n\n===US VHS versions===\nThe original 99-minute version was available in the US on VHS home video from Media Home Entertainment (and later Magnum) during the 1980s and 1990s.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=September 2017}} This video includes additional early scenes set inside Howie's police station which Hardy had left out of the 1979 restoration. In 2001 a remaster of the 88 minute cut was released on VHS, labeled as the \"Theatrical Version.\"\n\n===Director's cut===\nIn 2001, the film's new world rights owners, [[Canal+ Group|Canal+]], tried to release the full-length film. Corman's copy had been lost but a [[telecine]] transfer to 1-inch videotape existed. Missing elements were combined with film elements from the previous versions (in particular, additional scenes of Howie on the mainland were restored, showing him to be the object of gossip at his police station, establishing his devout religiosity). The extended DVD cut was released by Canal+ ([[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] handling US DVD distribution) in this 99-minute hybrid, considered the longest and closest version to Hardy's original 100-odd minute version.<ref name=\"stevephilips\" /> A two-disc limited edition set was sold with the shortened theatrical release, the new extended version and a documentary, ''The Wicker Man Enigma''.<ref name=\"wickermanenigma\">{{IMDb title|id=0307667 |title=The Wicker Man Enigma |description=2001 documentary on the film's production and releases. }}</ref> In 2005, ''Inside The Wicker Man'' author Allan Brown revealed he had discovered stills taken on the set showing sequences from the script that had never been seen; it had never been certain that the scenes had been filmed. They include scenes where Howie closes a mainland pub open after hours, encounters a prostitute, has a massage from Willow McGregor and sees a brutal confrontation between Oak and a villager in The Green Man, which were featured in a revised edition of ''Inside The Wicker Man''. Anchor Bay released a limited edition wooden box of ''The Wicker Man''. Fifty thousand two-disc sets were made, of which twenty were signed by Lee and Woodward, Shaffer, Snell and Hardy. In June 2007, Lee discussed the lost original cut, \"I still believe it exists somewhere, in [[film can|cans]] with no name. I still believe that. But nobody's ever seen it since, so we couldn't re-cut it, re-edit it, which was what I wanted to do. It would have been ten times as good\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M39giPEjE6Y |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/M39giPEjE6Y| archive-date=11 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=Christopher Lee talks about The Wicker Man|author=Lee, Christopher|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=21 March 2002|access-date=9 April 2012|author-link=Christopher Lee}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===''The Final Cut''===\nEuropean distributors of the film StudioCanal began a Facebook campaign in 2013 to find missing material, which culminated in the discovery of a 92-minute 35mm print at the Harvard Film Archive.
