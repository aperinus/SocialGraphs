Van Damme plays a [[French Foreign Legionnaire]]. When his brother is seriously injured, he returns to Los Angeles to enter the underground fighting circuit to raise money for his brother's family.\n\nThe film's cast and crew included Michel Qissi who appeared in earlier Van Damme films:  Tong Po, the villain in ''[[Kickboxer (film)|Kickboxer]]'' and Parades, a Kumite entrant in ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]''. Sheldon Lettich helped write ''Bloodsport'', and ''[[Double Impact]]''. ''Lionheart'' grossed $24.3 million on a $6 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nLyon Gaultier is in the [[French Foreign Legion]] stationed in [[Djibouti]], East Africa. After his brother, who lives in [[Los Angeles]], is set on fire during a drug deal gone bad, Lyon receives a letter from his sister-in-law H\u00e9l\u00e8ne begging him to come see his dying brother, who has been calling his name in agony. Lyon escapes the Legion in a daring breakout and sets off across the desert, until he reaches a dockyard on the coast, where he finds work aboard a [[tramp steamer]] headed for the [[United States]]. Lyon's Legion Commander, anticipating his destination, sends two of his own men to Los Angeles to bring Lyon back to meet [[court-martial]].\n\nArriving in [[New York City]] with no money to cross the country to Los Angeles, Lyon is attracted to an illegal street fight being run by a tramp named Joshua Eldridge. He volunteers for the next fight and easily defeats his opponent. Impressed, Joshua takes Lyon to meet Cynthia Caldera, an unscrupulous organizer of underground fights for the rich elite. Cynthia agrees to sponsor Lyon, dubbing him \"Lionheart\" and setting him up in a no-holds-barred fight against Sonny, a fighter known for heavily taunting his opponents. Lyon defeats Sonny easily, then leaves with Joshua to find a phone booth to call H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, fending off an attack by a local street gang of punks. Joshua calls in a favor from Cynthia, who gets them both across the States to Los Angeles.\n\nBy the time Lyon reaches the hospital, his brother has died. Though his murderers were apprehended, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was left penniless, with a stack of unpaid medical bills and little daughter Nicole to look after. Lyon and Joshua track down H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's address, but as Lyon tries to speak to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, she angrily rejects his offers for much needed financial help, admonishing Lyon for deserting his brother and unjustly blaming him for her late husband's involvement in the drug business.\n\nLyon decides to help H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Nicole without their knowledge. Through Cynthia, he joins the local street fighting circuit and has the profits delivered to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in the form of checks, with Joshua claiming that her husband subscribed to [[life insurance]] prior to his death. Lyon defeats a number of high-profile fighters, including a dirty-fighting Scotsman, a wrestler in a [[Squash (sport)|squash]] court, and a martial artist in a shallow swimming pool. Seeing as Lyon is not keeping his winnings and spurns her advances, Cynthia grows suspicious of Lyon and jealous towards H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and puts her assistant Russell on Lyon's trail. Similarly, the two Legionnaires sent after Lyon stake out H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's apartment and eventually try to capture Lyon: he is saved by Russell but suffers a broken rib. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who has witnessed the attack, learns the truth about the nonexistent insurance policy, whereupon she finally acknowledges Lyon as Nicole's uncle.\n\nCynthia arranges for Lyon to fight with Attila, an undefeated combatant whose style includes giving his opponents the illusion of a fighting chance, only to permanently disable them with callous finishing moves. Cynthia agrees to hand Lyon over to the Legionnaires after the fight. In order to skew the odds, she shows potential betters an altered tape of Attila which makes him look like a poor fighter, while she bets her entire fortune on Attila. Realizing Lyon is hurt, Joshua unsuccessfully tries to talk him out of the fight.\n\nAs the fight proceeds, Attila recognizes Lyon's rib wound and takes full advantage of it. When Attila appears to have won after repeatedly knocking down his opponent, Joshua begs Lyon to give up the fight and offers to split the winnings from his own bet against Lyon. This angers Lyon, who summons his remaining strength to defeat Attila with a series of kicks, knee blows and brutal punches. Lyon pummels Attila senseless but spares him, leaving Cynthia with a big debt and his family cared for with his own winning stake. The Legionaires capture Lyon, but with remorse listening to his niece's cry at the farewell to Lyon, they release him a couple of blocks away and wish him luck with his new life in America. The film ends with Lyon reunited with his family and Joshua.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Lyon \"Lionheart\" Gaultier \n* [[Harrison Page]] as Joshua Eldridge\n* [[Deborah Rennard]] as Cynthia Caldera\n* [[Lisa Pelikan]] as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Gaultier\n* [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Nicole Gaultier\n* Ash Adams as Francois Gaultier\n* [[Brian Thompson]] as Russell\n* George McDaniel as Adjutant\n* Voyo Goric as Sergeant Hartog\n* [[Michel Qissi]] as Moustafa\n* Stefanos Miltsakis as Jeep Driver\n* [[Billy Blanks]] as African Legionnaire\n* [[Tony Halme]] as Security Guard\n* [[Clement von Franckenstein]] as English Investor \n* [[Abdel Qissi]] as Attila\n* Magic Schwarz as Raquetball Fighter\n* Paco Christian Prieto as Pool Fighter\n* Stuart F.

They had become friends and Van Damme was impressed with a short film Lettich made, ''Firebase'', and agreed for Lettich to direct.<ref>[http://asianmoviepulse.com/2012/11/q-a-with-sheldon-lettich-by-marco-a-s-freitas-guest-post/ ''Q & A with Sheldon Lettich By Marco A. S. Freitas (Guest Post)'']</ref> The director later recalled\n\n<blockquote>''Lionheart'' was a defining film for Van Damme because I did not shy away from giving him considerable amounts of dialogue and character development throughout the film. I trusted him to pull this off, whereas before nobody else believed he could do much more than just deliver some fancy kicks and simple one-liners. Lionheart was the first movie to demonstrate that Van Damme was more than just a flash-in-the-pan \"Karate Guy\" who would never rise above simplistic low-budget karate movies.<ref name=\"sheldon\">[http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/02/05/badass-interview-talking-jean-claude-van-damme-with-lionheart-director-shel Evan Sathoff, \"Badass interview: Talking Jean-Claude van Damme with LIONHEART director, Sheldon Lettich\", 5 Feb 2015] accessed 20 June 2015</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the film, Van Damme's rear is exposed in one scene. While we were filming the scene in Lionheart where he takes a shower in Cynthia's apartment, he asked me if he might casually \"drop his towel\" and show off his butt for a brief moment. My reply was \"Sure, if you're willing, why not? We can always use a different take later if we decide it's not a good idea.\" So we did one take where he casually lets the towel drop away, and then we later decided to go ahead and put that shot in the movie. Well, that became a very memorable moment for the ladies in the audience, and for the gay guys as well. Showing off his butt (clothed or unclothed) almost became a signature trademark of his after that.<ref name=\"sheldon\"/>\n\n==Release==\n===Alternate versions===\nLike \"Kickboxer\", in addition to the various titles this film sports, there are also many varying versions and edits of the complete film. It seems that the most complete and uncut version is the R18+ version of \"Wrong Bet\" that was available in a special double VHS boxset with the original and uncut R18+ version of \"Kickboxer\". This was only available in Australia and New Zealand and was distributed by Palace Films and The Movie Group in the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s. Every other version of the film, including the more widely known \"Lionheart\", is an edited and shorter version. The violence is toned down, certain scenes were re-edited and shortened and random lines were cut. The closest version available is the original Australian release of \"Wrong Bet\" on DVD. However, even this version is yet another shorter edit.\n\n== Reception ==\n===Box office===\n''Lionheart'' performed well at the box office, debuting in 3rd position in the US with sales of about $7 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Home Alone in 9th Week as No. 1 Film : Movies: 'Godfather Part III' takes dramatic slide from second to sixth place in its third week out.

They're particularly fond of Lyon's motor-mouthed, self-appointed \"manager,\" Joshua. Van Damme's female fans seem especially enamored of this film because it was the first (and possibly the best) to showcase JCVD's softer, more compassionate side. In Lionheart he's not fighting for revenge or to \"honor his Sensei,\" or any of the usual motivations that are typical for these sorts of movies; he's fighting for his family. He's getting himself bruised and bloodied in these brutal street fights so that his little niece can get a new bicycle.<ref name=\"sheldon\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe critical reception for the film was negative.<ref>{{cite news |title=Karate-Themed 'Lionheart' Is a Swift Kick in the Teeth |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=1991-01-11 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-11/entertainment/ca-8116_1_van-damme |access-date=2010-08-23 |first=Michael |last=Wilmington |archive-date=2012-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026075246/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-11/entertainment/ca-8116_1_van-damme |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Lionheart |publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= 1991-01-18 |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312993,00.html |access-date= 2010-12-01 |archive-date= 2009-12-21 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091221103233/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312993,00.html |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Lionheart|work= Washington Post|date=1991-01-14 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/lionheartrharrington_a0aaff.htm |access-date=2021-01-01}}</ref> On the review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds an approval rating of 35% based on 17 reviews.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web |title= Lionheart |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lionheart_1990 |access-date=June 18, 2022 }}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=[[CinemaScore]] }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0100029|Lionheart}}\n* {{Mojo title|lionheart}}\n\n{{Sheldon Lettich}}\n{{Jean-Claude Van Damme}}\n\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990s action films]]\n[[Category:1991 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:American action films]]\n[[Category:American martial arts films]]\n[[Category:American boxing films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sheldon Lettich]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jean-Claude Van Damme]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Scott (composer)]]\n[[Category:1990 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Martial arts tournament films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
