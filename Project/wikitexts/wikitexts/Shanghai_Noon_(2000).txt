The first in the ''[[Shanghai (film series)|Shanghai]]'' film series and marking the [[directorial debut]] of [[Tom Dey]], ''Shanghai Noon'' was written by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]]. The film received positive reviews and was a commercial success.\n\nThe film, set in Nevada and other parts of the [[American West]] in the 19th century, is a juxtaposition of a Western with a [[kung fu]] action film with extended [[martial arts]] sequences, as reflected by its title, which is a wordplay on the iconic western ''[[High Noon]]''. It also has elements of comedy and the \"[[Buddy cop film]]\" genre, featuring two vastly different heroes (a Chinese Imperial Guard and an American Western outlaw) who team up to stop a crime. It is reminiscent of the iconic drama film of the genre from which it is largely inspired: ''[[Red Sun]]'', with [[Charles Bronson]] (Wanted Cowboy) and [[Toshiro Mifune]] (Imperial Samura\u00ef), but in the comedy register.{{Original research inline|date=October 2021}}\n\nIt was partially filmed in the Canadian [[Badlands]], near [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]], Canada, near [[Exshaw]], Alberta, and also near [[Cochrane, Alberta]].\n\nA sequel, ''[[Shanghai Knights]]'', was released in 2003, with [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] as director.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1881, Chon Wang \u2013 a [[homophone]] for [[John Wayne]] \u2013 is a Chinese [[Imperial Guards Brigade|Imperial Guard]] in the [[Forbidden City]]. After Princess Pei-Pei, aided by her foreign tutor, runs away to the United States, the [[Guangxu Emperor|Emperor of China]] sends three of his guards and the Royal Interpreter to retrieve her. Having failed to stop her escape, Wang insists on joining the mission. The Royal Interpreter, Wang's uncle, allows him to accompany the party, and the Captain of the Imperial Guards hopes the \"foreign devils\" will get rid of Wang. The party arrives in [[Nevada]], where outlaw Roy O'Bannon and his gang hijack their train. Wallace, a new member of Roy's gang, kills Wang's uncle, and Wang, a skilled martial artist, fights off the gang before uncoupling the train cars and escaping on the engine. Wallace takes over the gang, leaving Roy buried up to his chin in the desert. Meanwhile, Pei-Pei, tricked into believing she was freely escaping her arranged marriage in China, learns she has been kidnapped by an agent of Lo Fong, a traitor who fled the Forbidden City.\n\nWang finds Roy and demands to know the direction to [[Carson City]]. Roy tells him the city is on the other side of a mountain, and Wang leaves two chopsticks in Roy's mouth to dig himself out. Reaching the other side of the mountain, Wang saves a [[Sioux]] boy from the [[Crow Nation|Crow]] tribe and half-consciously marries the Sioux chief's daughter, Falling Leaves, during the wild celebrations. Wang finds a small town and encounters Roy in a tavern, inciting a barroom brawl. The two are sent to jail, and share each other's stories. Tempted by mention of the gold ransom, Roy offers to help Wang find the princess. After Falling Leaves helps them escape, Roy trains Wang in the ways of the cowboy, assisted by Falling Leaves.\n \nIn Carson City, Roy discovers that both he and Wang are wanted by Lo Fong's ally [[United States Marshals Service|Marshal]] Nathan Van Cleef, narrowly escaping capture. They reach Roy\u2019s \"hideout\u201d (a [[bordello]]), and bond with each other while recuperating there. They are arrested by Van Cleef after a drunken encounter with Wang, and discover that Lo Fong is behind the princess\u2019 abduction. As they are about to be hanged, Wang frees himself, Falling Leaves shoots Roy loose, and they escape. Wang, upset at overhearing Roy tell a prostitute he is not Wang's friend, rides off alone. He finds Pei-Pei in Lo Fong's labor camp, but she wishes to stay and help the enslaved Chinese laborers. Lo Fong discovers Wang and attacks him, but Roy appears, saving Wang.\n\nThe next day, the Imperial Guards bring gold to the Carson City Mission church to ransom Pei-Pei from Lo Fong, but the exchange is complicated by the appearance of Wang and Roy. Wang tells his fellow guards he will not allow them to take the princess against her wishes. As the guards and Lo Fong fight, Van Cleef arrives and engages Roy in a gunfight. Roy survives unscathed, and shoots Van Cleef through his sheriff's star, killing him. Wang fights the Imperial Guards as Lo Fong chases Pei-Pei through the rafters of the church, but Wang convinces his guards to let him go to Pei-Pei\u2019s aid instead. Wang and Lo Fong reach the bell tower, and Pei-Pei is wounded. Wang dismantles the bell, causing the ropes to strangle Lo Fong to death. The Imperial Guards agree to let Pei-Pei remain in Nevada, and reward Wang and Roy with the ransom gold.\n\nWallace and his gang arrive at the church, and demand that Roy and Wang come out and fight, but find themselves surrounded by the Sioux. At a Chinese cultural celebration, Roy shares a passionate kiss with Falling Leaves while Pei-Pei embraces Wang. Wang and Roy, who reveals his real name to be [[Wyatt Earp]], become sheriffs and ride off after a new band of train robbers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Chon Wang\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as [[Wyatt Earp|Roy O'Bannon / Wyatt Earp]]\n* [[Lucy Liu]] as Princess Pei-Pei \n* Brandon Merrill as Indian Wife / Falling Leaves{{efn|Merrill's character is never referred to by name in the film, and is listed in the credits as \"Indian Wife\".
