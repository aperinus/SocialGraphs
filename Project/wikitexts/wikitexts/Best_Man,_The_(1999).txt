Lee]]. It was produced by [[40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks]], with Lee's cousin, [[Spike Lee]], serving as producer. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Taye Diggs]] and [[Nia Long]], with the debut of [[Regina Hall]].\n\nA Christmas-themed [[sequel]], ''[[The Best Man Holiday]]'', was released on November 15, 2013 with a reunited cast.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Chicago]], Harper Stewart is an up-and-coming author whose debut novel, ''Unfinished Business'', has been selected by [[Oprah's Book Club]]. Harper's devoted girlfriend Robyn is frustrated by his unwillingness to commit to her.\n\nHarper travels to [[New York City]] to spend the weekend with old friends from college, before they all attend the wedding of Lance Sullivan, a [[running back]] for the [[New York Giants]], and Mia Morgan. Serving as best man, Harper reunites with his friends Julian \"Murch\" Murchison and Jordan Armstrong, who has passed an advance copy of ''Unfinished Business'' around their inner circle of friends \u2013 upon whom the book is based.\n\nNone of the friends approve of Murch's domineering girlfriend Shelby, and Harper chastises Quentin Spivey for being unable to settle down in a job. The weekend reveals that Quentin has always been a free spirit, Lance has renounced his womanizing behavior, Harper is unsure about remaining a bachelor, and Murch has never been able to keep a secret. Flashbacks to their college days reveal that Lance met Mia through Harper, who almost slept with Jordan. Quentin antagonizes Lance about Mia, whom Lance believes has never been with another man. Learning Lance has a copy of his book, Harper worries he will discover that Harper and Mia had a [[one-night stand]] in college.\n\nConfronting Harper about their mutual attraction, Jordan admits she wants to have sex with him that night, before Robyn arrives for the wedding the next day, and they share a kiss. Lance confronts Harper in the bathroom, but merely thanks him for his friendship; they are interrupted before Harper can come clean. As the groomsmen depart for the bachelor party, Jordan invites Harper to meet her later, and Murch finally stands up to Shelby.\n\nAt the party, Harper steals Lance's copy of ''Unfinished Business'', to the disgust of Quentin, who has deduced Harper's secret. As the party gets increasingly drunk, Murch falls for one of the strippers, Candy, and Harper calls Jordan, accepting her invitation. Finding the book in Harper's coat, Lance reads it and finds out the truth, realizing that Mia slept with Harper in college to get back at Lance for his numerous infidelities. Enraged, Lance attacks Harper for his betrayal and almost throws him off the balcony, but Quentin talks him down, and Lance calls off the wedding.\n\nA badly beaten Harper arrives at Jordan's apartment. He blames her for circulating the book, but Jordan berates him for airing his own dirty laundry and leading her on. The next day, Harper meets Robyn at the airport. She notices his injuries, and Harper confesses. Disappointed, Robyn prepares to leave, but Harper declares how much he needs her, and she reluctantly agrees to help him save the wedding.\n\nArriving at the church with Candy, Murch breaks up with Shelby. Lance arrives, and his friends try desperately to stop him before he can tell his parents the wedding is off. Harper \u2013 who has never agreed with Lance's religious devotion \u2013 halts him by asking him to pray. While Robyn and Jordan tend to Mia, who is oblivious to the previous night's events, Harper manages to reason with Lance after much difficulty and assures him of his and Mia's love. After forcing Harper to pray with him, a tearful Lance proceeds with the wedding.\n\nHarper gives a heartfelt speech praising Mia and Lance's love that visibly moves the couple, earning Lance's forgiveness. Shelby pushes a bridesmaid out of the way to seize the bouquet, while Quentin catches the garter. Jordan finds closure with Harper, telling him Robyn is the woman for him. On the dance floor, Harper thanks Robyn for her help and, in front of the entire wedding party asks her to marry him; she says yes. The film ends as everyone dances the [[electric slide]] to the song \"[[Candy (Cameo song)|Candy]]\" by [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]].\n\nIn a [[post credits scene|post-credit scene]], Shelby and Quentin wake up in bed together, to their shock and disgust.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Taye Diggs]] as Harper Stewart\n* [[Nia Long]] as Jordan Armstrong\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Lance Sullivan\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Julian \"Murch\" Murchison\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Quentin Spivey\n* [[Sanaa Lathan]] as Robyn\n* [[Melissa De Sousa]] as Shelby\n* [[Monica Calhoun]] as Mia Morgan\n* [[Jim Moody (actor)|Jim Moody]] as Uncle Skeeter\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Candace \"Candy\" Sparks \n* [[Jarrod Bunch]] as Wayne\n* [[Victoria Dillard]] as Anita\n* [[Malcolm D.

The website [[AllMovie]] gave the film 3/5 stars, with reviewer Jason Clark stating that the film has \"occasional moments of ripe humor, but it fails to say anything new about troubled weddings or the  experience of being an upwardly mobile African-American looking for love.\"<ref name=allmovie/> The film has earned a B+ average from users at the [[Yahoo!
