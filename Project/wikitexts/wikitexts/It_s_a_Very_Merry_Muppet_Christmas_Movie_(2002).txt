Thatcher]] and written by [[Tom Martin (writer)|Tom Martin]] and [[Jim Lewis (writer)|Jim Lewis]]. The film premiered November 29, 2002 on [[NBC]] and the first film to be made for television for [[The Muppets (franchise)|''The Muppets'' franchise]].\n\nIt stars [[Steve Whitmire]], [[Dave Goelz]], [[Bill Barretta]], [[Eric Jacobson]], [[David Arquette|Dave Arquette]], [[Joan Cusack]], [[Matthew Lillard]], [[William H. Macy]], and [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. The plot centers on [[Kermit the Frog]] who, after losing all hope for saving the Muppet Theatre, is assisted by an angel who shows him a world in which he was never born. The film is a homage to [[Frank Capra]]'s 1946 film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', which has a similar plot.\n\nThis was the first Muppets production without the involvement of veteran Muppet performer [[Frank Oz]]. Instead, [[Eric Jacobson]] performed Oz's characters [[Fozzie Bear]], [[Miss Piggy]], and [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]], marking his feature film debut as those characters. The film is also one of the few Muppets-related productions that are currently not owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], and along with [[Sam and Friends]] are owned by [[NBCUniversal]].\n\nThis is also the final Muppets material from The Jim Henson Company, as The Muppets were in their final years of ownership by Henson before being sold to Disney in 2004.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the holiday season, the Muppet Theater is going through financial hardship, and the Muppets are seeking [[Kermit the Frog]] for guidance. Kermit eventually feels he is not useful to anyone and an [[angel]] named Daniel ([[David Arquette]]) brings this up with his Boss ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) as they review what has gone on with Kermit in the past hours.\n\nHours earlier, Kermit prepares a Christmas show with his fellow Muppets with Bobo the Bear playing [[Santa Claus]]. Kermit is approached by Rachel Bitterman ([[Joan Cusack]]), a banker/real estate agent who says she will foreclose the Muppet Theater if Kermit does not pay her. [[Pepe the King Prawn]] leaves the Muppets because he has fallen in love with Bitterman. While trying to raise money to pay Bitterman, Kermit tries to find a celebrity to participate in his Christmas play to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, after learning from Pepe that the deadline is midnight, Bitterman changes it to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Pepe overhears this and warns Kermit about the deadline change. Upon learning this, Kermit sends Fozzie to deliver the money to Bitterman. Fozzie confronts a crazed nature-show host (spoofing [[Steve Irwin]]), and a gang of Whos after being dyed green at a Christmas tree lot and mistaken for the [[Grinch]] by some angry Whos. Fozzie goes through the steam baths and ends up back to normal where he throws off the Whos. When Fozzie eventually makes it to the bank and Bitterman's office, he goes through a gigantic web of burning lasers leading to Bitterman's office several times before finally discovering that he is too late and that he has grabbed the wrong bag containing clothes for the Salvation Army following his incident at the Christmas tree lot.\n\nAfter witnessing these events, the Boss allows Daniel to help Kermit. When Daniel arrives, and after Kermit wishes he has never been born, he ends up showing Kermit what would have happened if he had not existed. In the world without Kermit, Bitterman has turned the park near the Muppet Theater into a shopping mall called Bitterman Plaza, the Muppet Theater itself has become a nightclub called Club Dot owned by Bitterman, Doc Hopper's French-Fried Frog Legs (first seen in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'') has become a famous fast-food restaurant, and all of Kermit's friends have fallen into various detrimental situations.\n\nKermit has Daniel restore him back to his reality and returns to the Muppet Theater. However, Bitterman arrives to shut the theater down and fights with Miss Piggy. Pepe arrives where he breaks up the fight and announces he has made the Muppet Theater into a historical [[landmark]], foiling Bitterman's plan. Embittered and defeated, Bitterman storms out of the Muppet Theater.\n\nOutside, the Muppets sing \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Arquette]] as Daniel, an angel who appears to Kermit at Christmas\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Rachel Bitterman, a spoiled, rich young banker/real estate developer\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Luc Fromage, a foppish French choreographer\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as The Boss, the Creator of the Universe\n* [[William H.

The exception was Nelson's character Lew Zealand, who was performed by [[Bill Barretta]]. [[Sam Eagle]], a character originally performed by [[Frank Oz]], was voiced in the film by [[Kevin Clash]], while [[John Kennedy (puppeteer)|John Kennedy]] provided the on set puppetry.\n\n[[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], performed in the film by [[Brian Henson]], makes his first major appearance since the death of his initial performer, [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]. Hunt's character [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Janice|Janice]] was also performed by Henson and has a speaking role for the first time since Hunt's death.\n\nThe film contains an original song, \"Everyone Matters\", performed by Kermit and Gonzo as part of the world in which he had never been born, and then reprised at the end. The film also makes reference to the classic Muppet song \"[[Rainbow Connection]]\", featuring a statue of Kermit in a park, erected in dedication \"for the lovers, the dreamers and you\".\n\nThe movie was filmed prior to the [[September 11 attacks]]; one scene, set in a version of 2003 where Kermit was never born, shows the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|Twin Towers]] visible in the background. Years after the film's release, this detail gained viral attention, inspiring jokes that Kermit was responsible for 9/11.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/kermit-did-911-meme |title = Why 'Kermit Did 9/11' is the Conspiracy Theory That Won't Croak}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kermit-did-911 |title = Kermit Did 9/11 {{!}} Know Your Meme}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Film|Christianity}}\n* {{IMDb title|0329737}}\n\n{{Muppet films}}\n{{Kirk Thatcher}}\n\n[[Category:2002 television films]]\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:American Christmas films]]\n[[Category:Christmas television films]]\n[[Category:The Jim Henson Company films]]\n[[Category:NBC network original films]]\n[[Category:American children's films]]\n[[Category:Films about wish fulfillment]]\n[[Category:The Muppets films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Television sequel films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kirk Thatcher]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Watters]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
