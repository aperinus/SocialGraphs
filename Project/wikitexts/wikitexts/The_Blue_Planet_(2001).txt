It premiered on 12 September 2001 in the United Kingdom. It is narrated by [[David Attenborough]].\n\nDescribed as \"the first ever comprehensive series on the natural history of the world's oceans\",<ref>From DVD cover</ref> each of the eight 50-minute episodes examines a different aspect of [[marine life]]. The [[underwater photography]] included creatures and behaviour that had previously never been filmed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008044n |title=''The Blue Planet'' homepage |website=[[BBC Online]] |access-date=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe series won a number of [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] and [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA TV awards]] for its music and cinematography.<ref name=\"IMDb\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0296310/awards |title=Awards for the Blue Planet (2001)|publisher=[[IMDb]] |access-date=31 March 2009}}</ref> The executive producer was [[Alastair Fothergill]] and the music was composed by [[George Fenton]]. Attenborough narrated this series before presenting the next in his 'Life' series of programmes, ''[[The Life of Mammals]]'' (2002), and the same production team created ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'' (2006).\n\nA sequel series, ''[[Blue Planet II]]'' was aired on [[BBC One]] in 2017.\n\n== Background ==\nThe series took almost five years to make, involving nearly 200 filming locations. The fact that most of the [[ocean]] environment remains a mystery presented the production team with many challenges. Besides witnessing some animal behaviours for the first time, the crew also observed some that were new to science. The producers were helped by marine scientists all over the world with state-of-the-art equipment.\n\n[[Blue whale]]s \u2013 whose migration routes were previously unknown \u2013 were located by air, after some of the animals had been given temporary radio tags. The camera team spent three years on standby, using a [[ultralight aviation|microlight]] to land on the water nearby when they finally caught up with the creatures in the [[Gulf of California]]. The open ocean proved more difficult and over 400 days were spent in often unsuccessful filming trips. After six weeks, the crew chanced upon a [[Shoaling and schooling|school]] of [[spinner dolphin]]s, which in turn led them to a shoal of [[tuna]]. Off [[Mexico]], the behaviour of a flock of [[frigatebird]]s guided the cameramen to a group of [[sailfish]] and [[marlin]]: the fastest inhabitants of the sea. Near the coast of [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] in [[South Africa]], the team spent two seasons attempting to film the annual [[sardine run]], a huge congregation of predators such as [[shark]]s and [[dolphin]]s, that assembles to feast on the [[Fish migration|migrating fish]] by corralling them into \"bait balls\". Meanwhile, in [[Monterey Bay]], [[orca]] were documented attacking [[gray whale]]s and killing a calf. Filming in the deep ocean required the use of special [[submersible]]s. One of them enabled the crew to dive over a mile into the San Diego trench, where the carcass of a 40-ton gray whale had been placed to attract a large variety of scavengers.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Martha Holmes (broadcaster)|Holmes, Martha]] |title=Making Waves |medium=[[DVD]] |publisher = [[BBC]] |location=United Kingdom |date=2007}}</ref>\n\nWhen first transmitted on [[BBC One]], over 12 million people watched the series and it regularly achieved an audience share of over 30%.\n\nIn 2018 a newly-discovered species of [[phytoplankton]] (''[[Syracosphaera azureaplaneta]]'') was named by scientists in honour of the programme, and in recognition of David Attenborough's contribution to promoting wider understanding and awareness of the oceanic environment.<ref>{{cite web|title=New ocean plankton species named after BBC's Blue Planet series|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0418/170418-Syracosphaera-azureaplaneta|website=ucl.ac.uk|publisher=University College London|access-date=17 April 2018|date=17 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=Young>{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Jeremy R.|last2=Bown|first2=Paul R.|last3=Cros|first3=Lluisa|last4=Hagino|first4=Kyoko|last5=Jordan|first5=Richard W.|title=''Syracosphaera azureaplaneta'' sp. nov. and revision of ''Syracosphaera corolla'' Lecal, 1966|journal=Journal of Nannoplankton Research|date=2018|volume=38|issue=1}}</ref>\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{quotation|\"Our planet is a blue planet: over seventy percent of it is covered by the sea.

Near a [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] [[seamount]], there is a large concentration of marine animals because when the current makes contact with the submerged rock, it forces upwards [[plankton]] and other organisms. This in turn attracts other fish to the area that are higher up the food chain, like tuna, and those that are higher still, such as [[silky shark]]s. Off South Africa, a similar situation occurs every June when [[sardine]]s migrate and are pursued by a caravan of various predators. The [[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]] waters are the roughest, and storms also churn up nutrients to the surface. These feeding grounds have led to the world's largest [[albatross]] breeding colony, on [[Steeple Jason Island]], west of the [[Falkland Islands|Falklands]]. [[Phytoplankton]] forms the basis of all sea life, and every night some 1,000 million tonnes of creatures ascend from the deep to search for food. [[Lunar phase]]s can also have a bearing on events and the mass arrival of [[ridley sea turtle]]s on a [[Costa Rica]]n beach is shown. [[Herring]] initiate the most productive food chain, providing sustenance for [[humpback whale]]s, and [[Steller's sea lion|Steller's]] and [[California sea lion]]s. In addition, their eggs are nutrition for many, both above and in the sea. Along the coast of California, a migrating [[gray whale]] and her calf are targeted by a pod of [[orca]]s, who hunt down and kill the calf. Meanwhile, another gray whale carcass has sunk to the bottom of the deep sea. Hagfish, a [[sleeper shark]], and other scavengers arrive to feast on the carcass, a valuable food source in the depths, where sustenance is almost always scarce. A year and a half later the carcass is stripped to the bone.\n\n[[File:Silky sharks swimming in groups.png|thumb|[[Silky shark]]s swimming in groups]]\n\nThis episode won an [[Emmy Award]] for \"Outstanding Cinematography for Non-Fiction Programming\".

Over 60% of the sea is more than a mile deep and it forms the planet's most mysterious habitat. A [[sperm whale]] descends 1,000 metres to look for food and is followed, with the [[Johnson Sealink]] submersible. On the way down, a number of unusual creatures are witnessed, such as transparent [[squid]] and [[jellyfish|jellies]], whose [[photophore]]s give pulsating displays of colour. In such dark places, both being able to see (or sense movement) and the means of quick concealment are equally desirable. To that end, some use [[bioluminescence]] as a means of detecting food or evading predators. A descent to the very bottom of the ocean \u2013 some 4,000 metres \u2013 reveals life even at such cold temperatures, much of it new to science. It is dominated by [[echinoderm]]s that sweep the sea bed; however, there are occasional large hunters, such as [[chimaera]]. In addition, [[Bluntnose sixgill shark|sixgill shark]]s can grow up to eight metres in length and have remained unchanged for 150 million years. They are described as \"living fossils\" and relatively little is known about them. The remains of a gray whale are filmed being consumed by hagfish, a sleeper shark, probably a [[Greenland shark|Greenland sleeper]] or a [[Pacific sleeper shark|Pacific sleeper]] and the submersible involved in filming this is [[DSV Alvin]], which is the same submersible that [[Robert Ballard]] used in 1986 to explore the [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck of the ''Titanic'']], as acrylic sphere submersibles cannot reach that depth. As the [[continental shelf|continental slope]] flattens out, it joins the [[abyssal plain]], which can form huge trenches. At seven miles, the deepest is the [[Mariana trench]], and fish have been found there right down to the very bottom. Attenborough remarks that more is known about the surface of the [[moon]]. Species captured on film for the first time include the [[Grimpoteuthis|Dumbo octopus]] and the [[Caulophryne polynema|hairy anglerfish]].\n \n[[File:Screenshot of comb jellies (sp.

Such waters contain the swiftest and most powerful of ocean hunters. A feeding frenzy is shown, as [[striped marlin]], tuna and a [[sei whale]] (later identified as a [[Bryde's whale]]) pick off a shoal of sardines until all within it have been consumed. [[Manta ray]]s also gather to eat the eggs of spawning [[Acanthuridae|surgeonfish]]. Accumulations of plankton correspond to ocean 'boundaries' and consequently, schools of fish seek them out. This in turn attracts predators, and a [[sailfish]] is filmed on the attack. The only escape for smaller fish is to put as much distance between them and their pursuers as possible. [[Southern bluefin tuna|Bluefin tuna]] are able to heat their bodies and so can hunt in colder conditions than the others of their species. Off the coast of [[New Zealand]], an undersea [[volcano]] has formed an island and the nearby currents sweep many kinds of creatures to it, again creating huge feeding grounds. Another Pacific seamount is surrounded by [[hammerhead shark]]s, but not to seek food: they are there to allow other fish to clean them of [[parasitism|parasite]]s. However, others that are on the lookout for prey arrive in vast numbers. A large pod of [[common dolphin]]s is too big to feed all at once and so splits up into smaller expeditions. One of these ends up near the [[Azores]] with a shoal of [[mackerel]] in its sights, but they have to compete for their quarry with an attendant flock of [[shearwater]]s and a group of adult [[yellowfin tuna]].\n |LineColor       = 2998FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Frozen Seas\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|10|04|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00818zy|title=BBC One - The Blue Planet, Frozen Seas}}</ref>\n |Viewers         = 12.10\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Polarbearcup-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Polar bear]]]]\n [[File:The leopard seal is the Antarctic's top predator. It is most effective underwater, and emperor penguins propel themselves at speed through its territory..png|thumb|left|[[Leopard seal]]]]\n \nThis episode compares oceanic life in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]]. The winter in these regions brings temperatures of minus 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and frozen seas that create the biggest challenge. However, there are [[polynya]]s in the Arctic, which are free of ice owing to the pressure of currents on either side, and such places do provide refuge for some species, like the [[walrus]] and the [[bowhead whale]]. A pod of [[Beluga (whale)|belugas]] is shown: their movements are limited to a single hole in the ice \u2013 therefore putting them at risk of attack from [[polar bear]]s. Everything changes with the arrival of summer, when melting ice brings a variety of migratory visitors. At the other end of the planet, in the Antarctic, winter is even more harsh, but [[emperor penguin]]s and [[Weddell seal]]s stay throughout. Under the sea ice, [[krill]] shrink in size and revert to their juvenile form in order to save energy. [[Chinstrap penguin]]s overwinter to the north, beyond the ice, but return during the spring to breed. Having managed to get ashore, they have to walk a great distance to find a nest site, and the most favoured is [[Zavodovski Island]], an active volcano whose warmth keeps ice from forming. Further south, as the sea ice breaks up, humpback and [[minke whale]]s appear, their target the abundant krill. The [[leopard seal]] is the Antarctic's top predator. It is most effective underwater, and emperor penguins propel themselves at speed through its territory. Nonetheless, it almost invariably makes a kill.\n\n |LineColor       = 2998FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Seasonal Seas\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|10|10|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074mlf|title=BBC One - The Blue Planet, Seasonal Seas}}</ref>\n |Viewers         = 9.75\n |ShortSummary    = The fifth instalment surveys the effects of the [[season]]s on the world's temperate seas \u2013 the most productive on Earth. [[Sable Island]] near [[Nova Scotia]] boasts the largest colony of [[grey seal]]s, which breed there when the weather is at its worst. The pups remain marooned for weeks until the spring, when they are strong enough to swim. Spring also heralds the bloom of phytoplankton: it provides food for [[copepod]]s, and they in turn are prey to jellyfish, which assemble in vast, million-strong swarms. On the [[California]]n coast, [[Kelp|giant kelp]] also flourishes and by summer, grows at the rate of a metre a day. It provides a sanctuary for shoals of fish and [[sea otter]]s, the latter anchoring themselves to the [[seaweed]] when resting and keeping its grazers in check by eating them. Late summer in [[Alaska]] sees [[Salmon|Pacific salmon]] heading inshore to breed. However, the level of their favoured river is too low and they are forced to wait in the open sea, where they fall prey to a [[salmon shark]]. The early autumn near [[Vancouver Island]], and the temperature drops slowly. There, the last of the year's baby herring become the focus for a feeding frenzy by diving [[auk]]s and [[guillemot|murre]]s, and marauding [[Sebastidae|rockfish]]. [[Pacific white-sided dolphin]]s also inhabit these waters and, when not hunting nocturnally, socialise during the day. As winter arrives in the north, adult herring seek shelter but are hunted by orca, which club the fish with their tails to subdue them by creating waves of pressure.\n |LineColor       = 2998FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Coral Seas\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|10|17|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074mmc|title=BBC One - The Blue Planet, Coral Seas}}</ref>\n |Viewers         = 9.80\n |ShortSummary    = [[Coral reef]]s, which are so crowded that they play host to a perpetual battle for space, even among the [[coral]] itself. It starts life as a larva that becomes a [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]. Having multiplied, it hardens into a [[limestone]] skeleton and grows to form a reef. As the community flourishes, animals develop relationships with one another and such a place can feature a huge variety of ocean life. Although corals feed nocturnally on plankton, sunlight is vital because even though they are animals, each contains millions of single-celled [[algae]]. This in turn is the favoured sustenance of the [[Green humphead parrotfish|humphead parrotfish]], whose jaws are so powerful that it erodes much of the reef into fine sand. Algae also grows on the top of the reef and a battle for grazing rights between shoals of [[Acanthurus leucosternon|powder blue]] and [[Acanthurus triostegus|convict tang]]s is shown, the former being initially overwhelmed by the latter's weight of numbers before regaining the upper hand. The night-time hunting of a [[Batoidea|marbled ray]] alerts other predators and a group of [[whitetip reef shark]]s moves in, from which few are safe. Several breeding strategies are examined, including the acrobatic habits of brown surgeonfish and the colourful courtship of the [[cuttlefish|flamboyant cuttlefish]]. Humpback whales are visitors to the reef and males establish their seniority by the loudness and strength of their [[Whale song|song]]. Being fixed to the seabed, corals must synchronise their reproduction with lunar phases and the rising spring temperatures.\n |LineColor       = 2998FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Tidal Seas\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|10|24|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008535y|title=BBC One - The Blue Planet, Tidal Seas}}</ref>\n |Viewers         = 10.35\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Tidal bore.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tidal bore]] at [[Fundy Bay]]]]\nThe penultimate episode deals with marine life that is structured around the rising and falling [[tide]]s. These are caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting [[moon]], but in some locations, this can also combine with the power of the sun to create a [[tidal bore]]. The world's largest tides are to be found in the [[Bay of Fundy]] in Nova Scotia and therefore it is a rich feeding ground. A school of [[Fin whale|finback whale]]s is closely shadowed by a flock of [[Cory's shearwater]]s. However, they only have a limited time to feed before low tide, when they must retreat and other creatures appear. Elsewhere, some of the latter include [[sand bubbler crab]]s, [[bear]]s (which feed on [[shellfish]]) and a [[Neogastropoda|snail]] species that can 'surf', and some [[sand lance]]s being preyed on by [[Spiny dogfish|dogfish sharks]]. The extreme spring tides allow opportunists to forage further, and [[raccoon]]s are shown tackling a [[Grapsus grapsus|red rock crab]]. Some larger fish that hunt on the seabed, such as [[nurse shark]]s and [[stingray]]s, are forced to sit and wait until there is sufficient water in which to swim. A [[Pleuroploca gigantea|giant horse conch]] is shown devouring a [[tulip snail]], and [[hermit crab]]s battle over its vacant shell. The varying water levels are no obstacle to [[tarpon]]: they can breathe air. This enables them to inhabit stagnant areas and hunt in them. The autumn [[equinox]] combines with a [[hurricane]] off the [[Bahamas]] to create a much higher tide than is usual, flooding large parts of the coast. When the sea recedes, it leaves behind [[salt]]: food for [[brine shrimp]]s and the perfect habitat in which [[flamingo]]s can breed.\n |LineColor       = 2998FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Coasts\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|10|31|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074mn1|title=BBC One - The Blue Planet, Coasts}}</ref>\n |Viewers         = 9.97\n |ShortSummary    = The final episode examines the world's coastal environments, \"the most dynamic of all ocean habitats\". The perils of living in such places are highlighted by [[marine iguana]]s on the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], whose diet of seaweed is quickly grabbed between crashing breakers. Many shores provide sites in which to breed or lay eggs. Apart from [[bird]]s, [[turtle]]s are among other major species to do so, and the mass emergence of [[Flatback turtle|flatback]]s on [[Crab Island (Queensland)|Crab Island]] in Australia is reduced by predatory [[heron]]s, [[pelican]]s and other hunters. Each year, four million seabirds, comprising fourteen species, return to the island of Talan in eastern Russia to nest. By ensuring that all their chicks eventually leave at the same time, they lessen the impact of predators. The rough seas of the [[Southern Ocean]] play host to [[Southern rockhopper penguin|penguin]]s, and a group of them is shown being pursued by an aggressive bull [[South American sea lion|sea lion]]. The planet's coldest seas are in Antarctica, and on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] each spring, thousands of [[southern elephant seal]]s arrive to breed. A pair of males is shown fighting a bloody battle to control a harem of females, and Attenborough states that these fights, which are rarely fatal, can go on for 20 minutes or longer. In [[Patagonia]], the social nature of sea lions is shown as they establish colonies, each of them several hundred strong. While in some respects it is an ideal location for the growing young, high tide brings danger for the colony as a pod of [[orca]]s habitually goes on the attack. After intentionally grounding themselves to catch their prey, the orcas return to the sea with their quarries to 'play' with them, before ultimately consuming their kills.\n |LineColor       = 2998FF\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = Specials\n |Title           = Deep Trouble\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|10|28|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00cxrcz|title=BBC Two - The Blue Planet, Deep Trouble}}</ref>\n |Viewers         = \n |ShortSummary    = Scientists believe many species that are eaten every day are now seriously threatened.
