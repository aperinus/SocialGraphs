It is the 22nd [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]] and was first released on a [[Double feature|double bill]] with ''[[Escape from the Dark|The Littlest Horse Thieves]]'' on March 11, 1977.\n\nIts characters have spawned a [[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|franchise of various sequels and television programs]], clothing, books, toys, and an [[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (attraction)|attraction of the same name]] at [[Disneyland]],  [[Walt Disney World]], and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] in addition to [[Pooh's Hunny Hunt]] in [[Tokyo Disneyland]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film's content is derived from three previously released animated featurettes Disney produced based upon the [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] books by [[A. A. Milne]]: ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree]]'' (1966), ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]'' (1968), and ''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'' (1974). Extra material was used to link the three featurettes together to allow the stories to merge into each other.\n\nA fourth, shorter scene was added to bring the film to a close, originally made during the production of ''Blustery Day'' (based on the presence of [[Jon Walmsley]] as Christopher Robin). The sequence was based on the final chapter of ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]]'', where Christopher Robin must leave the Hundred Acre Wood behind as he is starting [[school]]. In it, Christopher Robin and Pooh discuss what they liked doing together and the boy asks his bear to promise to remember him and to keep some of the memories of their time together alive. Pooh agrees to do so, and the film closes with The Narrator saying that wherever Christopher Robin goes, Pooh will always be waiting for him whenever he returns.\n\n==Later featurette==\nSix years after the release of ''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'', Disney commissioned a fourth featurette based on the stories. ''[[Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore]]'' premiered in theaters on March 11, 1983, but was not originally connected to the preceding films in any manner. It has since been added to home video releases of ''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.''\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Sterling Holloway]] as [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie the Pooh]]\n* [[Bruce Reitherman]], [[Jon Walmsley]] and Timothy Turner as [[Christopher Robin]]\n* [[John Fiedler]] as [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]]\n* [[Ralph Wright]] as [[Eeyore]]\n* [[Clint Howard]] and Dori Whitaker as [[Roo]]\n* [[Barbara Luddy]] as [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]]\n* [[Paul Winchell]] as [[Tigger]]\n* [[Junius Matthews]] as [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]]\n* [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as [[Owl (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Owl]]\n* [[Howard Morris]] as [[Gopher (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Gopher]]\n* [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]] as The Narrator\n\n==Production==\n''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' was the last film in the Disney canon in which [[Walt Disney]] had personal involvement, since one of the shorts (''Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree'') was released during his lifetime and he was involved in the production of ''Blustery Day''. It was always Walt Disney's intention to create a feature film, but he decided to make shorts instead \u2014 after production had begun \u2014 to familiarize U.S. audiences with the characters. All three shorts, as well as future feature films, boast classic songs by the [[Sherman Brothers]] including \"[[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Winnie the Pooh]]\" and \"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\".\n\nThe character Gopher, which does not appear in the Milne stories, was created because Disney wanted an all-American character that could appeal to the children, and also add an element of comedy.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZJCW4GE_Fk&t=649s The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh: The Story Behind The Masterpiece]</ref>\n\nFor the character [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]], hand gestures and other movements were used by the animators to create expressiveness, since he (and Pooh) had the appearance of dolls or stuffed animals with relatively simple button eyes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life |last=Thomas |first=Frank |author2=Ollie Johnston  |year=1981 |publisher=Abbeville Press |isbn=0-89659-232-4 |pages=448 }}</ref> The scene where Rabbit deals with Pooh's rump being part of the \"decor of his home\" was not in the original book, but was reportedly contemplated by Disney when he first read the book.<ref>{{cite book |title=Walt Disney: Conversations |last=Davidson |first=Bill |author2=Kathy Merlock Jackson  |year=2006 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=1-57806-712-X |pages=128 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Reception===\n''The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' holds a unanimous critic approval rating of {{RT data|score}} on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average of {{RT data|average}}.

In 1996, it was re-released on VHS as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection series and included video footage of the making which was shown before the movie starts (as did the first UK VHS release in 1997). It was released on DVD for the first time in 2002 as a 25th Anniversary Edition, with digitally restored picture and sound. The individual shorts had also been released on their own on VHS in the 1990s.\n\nThe 25th-anniversary edition DVD includes, among other bonus features: \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: The Story Behind the Masterpiece\", which documents the history of the books and their initial film adaptations; the short ''[[Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore]]'' (1983); and interviews with animators [[Ollie Johnston]], [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], and [[Burny Mattinson]], as well as the [[Sherman Brothers]], [[Paul Winchell]], and others.
