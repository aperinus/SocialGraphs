Colbert co-produced the film alongside [[executive producer]] [[David Letterman]]. The film grossed $2.3 million.\n\n==Plot==\n46-year-old former high school dropout and self-described \"junkie whore\" Jerri Blank is released from prison and returns to her childhood home. She discovers her mother has died, her father, Guy, has remarried to the hateful Sara Blank, and she has an arrogant half-brother Derrick. To make matters worse, her father is in a \"stress-induced coma\". Taking the suggestion of the family doctor literally, Jerri decides to pick her life back up where she left it, beginning her high school all over again as a freshman at Flatpoint High.\n\nJerri joins Chuck Noblet's [[science fair]] team, the [[Fig newton|Fig Neutrons]], along with her new friends, Megawatti Sucarnaputri (a spoof on [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]]) and Tammi Littlenut. Noblet is not pleased to learn that Principal Onyx Blackman has hired a [[List of sports idioms#R|ringer]] for their team, Roger Beekman, to ensure that Flatpoint wins, and so Noblet creates a second team. As she struggles to fit in and make her teammates proud, Jerri discovers that though the faces may have changed, the hassles of high school are just the same.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Amy Sedaris]] as Geraldine Antonia \"Jerri\" Blank\n* [[Stephen Colbert]] as Chuck Noblet\n* [[Paul Dinello]] as Geoffrey Jellineck\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Guy Blank\n* [[Joseph Cross (actor)|Joseph Cross]] as Derrick Blank\n* [[Deborah Rush]] as Sara Blank\n* [[Maria Thayer]] as Tamela \"Tammi\" Littlenut\n* [[Carlo Alban]] as [[Megawati Sukarnoputri|Megawatti Sukarnoputri]]\n* [[Greg Hollimon|Gregory Hollimon]] as Principal Onyx Blackman\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Alice\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Roger Beekman\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Peggy Callas\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Henry\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Carlo Honklin\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Brason\n* [[Dolores Dwyer|Delores Duffy]] as Iris Puffybush\n* [[Kristen Johnston]] as Coach Divers\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Stew\n* [[Ian Holm]] as Dr. Putney\n* [[David Rakoff]] as Boswell\n* [[Elisabeth Harnois]] as Monica\n* [[Alexis Dziena]] as Melissa\n* [[Tom Guiry|Thomas Guiry]] as P John\n* Evelyn McGee as Clair Noblet\n* [[Jonah Bobo]] (''uncredited'') as Seamus Noblet\n* [[Ryan Donowho]] (''uncredited'') as Stanley\n* [[Christopher Larkin (actor)|Christopher Larkin]] (''uncredited'') as Kim\n* [[Todd Oldham]] (''uncredited'') as Mr. Oldham\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nSedaris admitted in an interview that they never intended on making a film after the series was cancelled, explaining, \"[[Paul Dinello|Paul]], [[Stephen Colbert|Steve]], and I were working on our book ''Wigfield'' ... We kept coming up with funny Jerri Blank stuff to say, so it would go into a file, and by the end of the book, Paul opened the file and there was all this Blank stuff, and he said, 'Oh, it would be so funny to write a movie.' That's really how it happened.\"<ref>Gillette, Amelie. [http://www.avclub.com/content/node/49863 \"The Onion A.V. Club Interview: Amy Sedaris\"], ''AVClub.com'' June 28, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n* Orlando Pabotoy looked too old to reprise his series role as Orlando Pinatubo. His character was then replaced by the similar Megawatti Sukarnoputri.\n* [[Larc Spies]] did not return for the role of Derrick because, according to Sedaris, \"he looks like a [[longshoreman]] now.\" Several other characters were recast because the original actors looked too old to believably play high schoolers. The only original student to return was Thayer as redhead Tammi Littlenut.\n* [[Roberto Gari]] did not reprise the role of Guy, who was instead portrayed by Hedaya, who portrayed Guy's character differently than Gari; on the television show, a 'healthy' Guy is frozen in humorous, almost statuesque states, whereas in the film, Hedaya's Guy is simply unconscious.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in two venues on June 28, 2006, earning $43,141 in its debut and ranking #42 in the North American box office and fifth among the week's new releases.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2006&wknd=26&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for June 30-July 2, 2006 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=July 5, 2006 | accessdate=December 11, 2016}}</ref> Its widest number of theaters being 109, the film ended its run on September 21, 2006, having grossed $2,072,645 domestically and $181,479 overseas for a worldwide total of $2,254,124.<ref name=mojo>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=strangerswithcandy.htm | title=''Strangers with Candy'' (2006) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=September 21, 2006 | accessdate=December 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n{{As of|June 2022}}, ''Strangers with Candy'' holds a 51% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 103 reviews, with an [[Weighted mean|average rating]] of 5.90/10.
