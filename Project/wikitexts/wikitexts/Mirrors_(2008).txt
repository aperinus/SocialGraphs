The film was first titled ''Into the Mirror'', but the name was later changed to ''Mirrors''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790686/releaseinfo#akas|title=Mirrors (2008) - Release Info - IMDb|website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref> Filming began on May 1, 2007, and it was released in American theaters on August 15, 2008.\n\nThe film was originally scripted as a straightforward remake of the 2003 [[South Korea]]n horror film ''[[Into the Mirror]]'' which is rated 15 by [[Korea Media Rating Board|KMRB]]. However, once Aja was brought on board and read the script, he was dissatisfied with the particulars of the original film's story. He decided to retain the original film's basic idea involving [[mirror]]s, and to incorporate a few of its scenes, but otherwise crafted a new story and script for his version of the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/29/28129.php|title=Movieweb: EDIT BAY VISIT: We Look Deep Into Alexandre Aja's Mirrors|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816012745/http://www.movieweb.com/news/29/28129.php|archive-date=2008-08-16}}</ref> A sequel titled ''[[Mirrors 2]]'' was released in 2010.\n\n== Plot ==\nA security guard runs through a subway station until he enters a room he cannot escape and starts begging his reflection in a mirror for his life. His reflection uses a shard to slice into its own throat; the wound reflects upon the real security guard's body, killing him.\n\nBen Carson, a suspended police detective, begins his first day as a night security guard at the Mayflower, a luxury department store gutted by a fire and shuttered five years prior. The building still contains numerous mirrors from the store.\n\nOn Ben's first night of patrol, he finds a mirror that appears covered with handprints, but only on the reflected side of the glass. He sees an open door in the reflection while it is actually closed. Over time, Ben begins to see more intense visions, which he initially shrugs off as hallucinations. He soon finds the wallet of Gary Lewis, the previous night guard (from the beginning of the film) who supposedly killed himself. Inside is a note that says \"Esseker\". After noticing the absence of blood on the mirror shard in Gary\u2019s crime photos, Ben is convinced that the mirrors make people do things to themselves that they are not actually doing.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben's sister, Angie, is killed by her reflection as it grips its jaw and slowly pulls its mouth apart, causing her to bleed profusely. Ben is distraught when he finds her body. In anger, he attempts to destroy the mirrors at the Mayflower, but they are impervious to damage. He demands to know what the mirrors want, and cracks appear on one of the mirrors, spelling out the word \"ESSEKER\".\n\nBen enters the flooded basement of the Mayflower and finds a small sign stating \"Psychiatric Studies\" and \"St. Matthew's Hospital\" underneath. He moves to the site of the leak and begins pulling at the tiles and brick of the wall and finds a room with a chair surrounded by mirrors beyond it, a [[Psychomanteum]]. Realizing that the Mayflower was built on the site of an earlier hospital,\nBen asks his police friend Larry Byrne to help him locate the patient-employee manifest for the hospital. Larry finds the name Anna Esseker, a patient of the psychiatric hospital. She was twelve years old at the time and died in a [[mass suicide]].\n\nBen looks through Anna's file and finds an Authorization and Consent form that negated her Death Certificate, stating that she had been discharged from the hospital two days before the suicide and is led to believe that Anna is still alive. Meanwhile, Ben's wife Amy discovers her son Michael's reflection acting differently from the real Michael. In a panic, she calls Ben, who immediately returns home. Together they cover every reflective surface in the house with green paint.\n\nBen locates Anna Esseker's childhood home, and discovers that as a child she was violent and uncontrollable, and diagnosed with severe [[schizophrenia]]. She was taken in by a doctor, Dr. Kane from St. Matthew's Hospital, who believed that she had a rare personality disorder. His treatment was to confine Anna to a chair surrounded by mirrors, believing this would cure her disorder by forcing her to confront her own reflection. Ben is told by Anna's brother Robert that when she returned, apparently cured, strange things started to happen with the mirrors in their home. As a result, her family sent her to a [[convent]], Saint Augustine's Monastery, where mirrors are forbidden.\n\nBen visits the convent and finds Anna alive and well, who explains that she was actually possessed by a [[demon]], which was drawn from her and became trapped in the mirrors. She explains that it collects the souls of those it kills and if she were to return, it would make it possible for the demon to be brought back into the mortal world. She refuses to go back.\n\nMeanwhile, Amy discovers that Mikey is missing at home, and a thin reflective layer of water is completely covering the floor. After putting her daughter Daisy in a safe closet, she finds Michael using a knife to scrape the paint from the mirrors. Amy tries to stop him, but he escapes, obviously [[Demonic possession|possessed]].\n\nHaving threatened her at gunpoint, Ben returns with Anna to the Mayflower and straps her into the chair in the Psychomanteum. Back at Ben's house Michael is suddenly pulled through the water on the floor by his reflection and begins to drown. At the Psychomanteum the lights begin to flicker and the building begins to shake as the demons in the mirrors are released. They repossess Anna and all the mirrors in the Mayflower explode. Simultaneously, Michael is released from the demon's grip and Amy is able to pull him to safety. The repossessed Anna then attacks Ben. He manages to kill her by igniting a nearby gas line, setting off a huge explosion. The old building starts to collapse violently, and Ben is trapped under the ceiling while trying to escape.\n\nBen pulls himself out of the rubble and stumbles out of the building. Policemen and firemen are everywhere in the street, and a body is seen being taken in a bag by paramedics, but nobody notices Ben. He looks at the older security guard's name tag and sees it is written backward, realizing everything is in reverse (like in a mirror). He comes upon a mirrored surface in the city and fails to see his own reflection as he reaches out to touch it. He realizes that he died in the rubble and is trapped in the mirror world: his hand appears as a handprint on the glass surface in the living world.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Ben Carson\n* [[Paula Patton]] as Amy Carson\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Angela \"Angie\"  Carson\n* [[Cameron Boyce]] as Michael \"Mikey\" Carson\n* Arika Gluck as Daisy Carson\n* [[Mary Beth Peil]] as Anna Esseker\n* [[John Shrapnel]] as Lorenzo Sapelli\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Det.
