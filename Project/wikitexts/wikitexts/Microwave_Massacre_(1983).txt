While his friends Roosevelt and Phillip dine on simple [[Bologna sausage|bologna]]-and-[[cheese]] sandwiches for lunch, Donald is saddled with crab sandwiches and other cooking atrocities. To his horror, he discovers his wife has bought an unusually large [[General Electric|Major Electric]] [[microwave oven]], which makes the meals worse in half the time.\n\nAfter coming home drunk one night and getting into an argument with May, Donald loses his temper and [[Club (weapon)|bludgeon]]s her to death with a large [[pepper grinder]]. He wakes up the next day with a bad hangover, no memory of the night before, and a growling stomach. He discovers May's corpse in the microwave and after the initial wave of horror passes, he starts to take it in stride, telling his co-workers that he and May separated. After work, he then cuts up May's body and stores it in foil wrap in the refrigerator. A [[running gag]] involving May's head retaining some sort of sentience is introduced during this scene.\n\nLooking for a midnight snack one night, Donald unintentionally [[cannibalism|takes a few bites]] of May's hand, and (again) after the initial wave of horror passes, he realizes it's the best thing he's ever eaten. He even brings some to work with him and shares it with Phillip and Roosevelt, who concur. He soon starts picking up hookers and using them for meat in his recipes.\n\nWhile cooking one night, Donald has a mild [[heart attack]] and goes to his doctor, who tells him of a [[pacemaker]] that was put some years earlier in when he had some excess weight, but says he is fine overall. May's equally shrewish sister Evelyn shows up, having not heard from her sister in some time. She finds her severed head in the garage refrigerator, and is gagged with bread and thrown, tied up, in Donald's closet.\n\nDonald's lunches continue to be a hit with his friends, and he decides to cater an outing to a wrestling match with a new recipe he calls \"Peking [[female|chick]].\" When Roosevelt and Phillip show up to pick up Donald, they discover him dead on the kitchen floor of a heart attack, and some partly cooked body parts in the microwave. They leave in horror and disgust, realizing what Donald had been serving them.\n\nSome time later, the house is up for sale and movers are taking the furniture out. A repairman (director Wayne Berwick, in an uncredited cameo) examines the microwave and discovers a problem with the wires, commenting that it would be bad for someone with a pacemaker. We then zoom into the fridge, which opens to reveal May's head. Her eyes glow orange as the film ends.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Jackie Vernon (comedian)|Jackie Vernon]] as Donald\n*Loren Schein as Roosevelt\n*Al Troup as Philip\n*Marla Simon as Knothole Girl\n*Claire Ginsberg as May\n*Lou Ann Webber as Dee Dee Dee\n*Anna Marlowe as Chick\n*Cindy Gant as Susie Grubb\n*Sarah Alt as Evelyn\n*Karen Marshall as Neighbor\n*Phil De Carlo as Sam\n*Aaron Koslow as Salesman\n*Ed Thomas as Dr. Von Der Fool\n*[[John Harmon (actor)|John Harmon]] as Dr. Gestalp\n*[[Robert A.
