It stars the voices of [[Stephen Garlick]], [[Lisa Maxwell (actress)|Lisa Maxwell]], [[Billie Whitelaw]], [[Percy Edwards]], and [[Barry Dennen]]. The film was produced by [[ITC Entertainment]] and [[The Jim Henson Company]] and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. The plot revolves around [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Jen|Jen]] and [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Kira|Kira]], two [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Gelflings|Gelflings]] on a quest to restore balance to the world of [[Fantasy world|Thra]] and overthrow the evil, ruling [[Skeksis]] by restoring a powerful broken Crystal.\n\nIt was marketed as a family film, but was notably darker than the creators' previous material. The [[animatronics]] used in the film were considered groundbreaking for its time, with most creatures, like the Gelflings, requiring around four puppeteers to achieve full manipulation. The primary [[concept artist]] was fantasy illustrator [[Brian Froud]], famous for his distinctive [[fairy]] and [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] designs. Froud also collaborated with Henson for his next project, the 1986 film ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]''.\n\n''The Dark Crystal'' was produced by [[Gary Kurtz]], while the screenplay was written by [[David Odell]], with whom Henson previously worked as a staff writer for ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. The [[film score]] was composed by [[Trevor Jones (composer)|Trevor Jones]]. The film initially received mixed reviews from mainstream critics; while being criticized for its darker, more dramatic tone in contrast to Henson's previous works, it was praised for its narrative, aesthetic, and characters. Over the years, it has been re-evaluated by critics and has garnered a [[cult film|cult following]].<ref name=Cult/>\n\nAn [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[prequel]] television series, ''[[The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance]]'', premiered on [[Netflix]] in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nA thousand years ago on the planet Thra, two new races appeared when a Shard was shattered from the Crystal of Truth: the cruel [[Skeksis]], who use continued corruption of the Crystal to extend their lives, and the gentle [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#The urRu/Mystics|urRu]], more commonly known as Mystics, who make their home in the Valley of Stones to await their destiny. The leader of the Mystics, the Master UrSu, raises a young [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Gelflings|Gelfling]] named [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Jen|Jen]] whose clan were slaughtered by the Skeksis. As the Great Conjunction of Thra's three suns draws near, a dying UrSu instructs Jen to fulfil a prophecy to heal the Crystal by first retrieving the Shard from [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Aughra|Aughra]]. If Jen fails to complete his quest before the three suns meet, the Skeksis will rule forever. As UrSu passes, the Skeksis' Emperor, skekSo, also dies, leaving the position for the leader vacant. The Chamberlain, skekSil, and the Garthim Master, skekUng, challenge each other in a \"Trial by Stone\" for succession, resulting in skekUng defeating skekSil. SkekSil is stripped of his robes and banished, while skekUng is proclaimed the new emperor. When the Skeksis learn of Jen's existence, they send their army of giant crab-like [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Garthim|Garthim]] to capture him, with the cunning skekSil following.\n\nJen meets Aughra and enters her [[orrery]], which she uses to predict the heavens, and she explains about the Conjunction before having Jen select the correct Shard. Before Aughra can explain Jen's mission, the Garthim arrive and destroy the orrery, taking Aughra prisoner as Jen flees. Hearing the call of the Crystal, the Mystics leave their valley to return to the Castle of the Crystal. On his journey through a forest swamp, Jen meets [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Kira|Kira]], another surviving Gelfling. The two learn more about each other when they accidentally \"dreamfast\", sharing each other's memories. They stay for a night with the [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Podlings|Podlings]] who raised Kira, only for them and Kira's pet [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Fizzgig|Fizzgig]] to flee when the Garthim raid the village. They are nearly caught, but skekSil intervenes, keeping the Garthim from pursuing them.\n\nJen and Kira discover a ruined Gelfling civilization with ancient writing describing the prophecy: \"When single shines the triple sun, what was sundered and undone shall be whole, the two made one by Gelfling hand or else by none.\" They are interrupted by skekSil, who reveals the prophecy was the reason for the Gelfling genocide while trying to trick them into coming with him to the castle. But the Gelflings run off and reach the castle on [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Landstriders|Landstriders]], intercepting the Garthim that attacked Kira's village. While trying to free the captured Podlings, Kira, Jen, and Fizzgig descend to the Castle's dry moat (revealing Kira has wings) and use the catacombs to gain access. But they are intercepted by skekSil, who attempts to drag them to the other Skeksis when they refuse him further. Jen stabs skekSil's hand with the Shard in defiance (which leads to his Mystic counterpart, urSol, to receive a similar wound on his), and skekSil, in a fit of rage, buries Jen in a cave-in and takes Kira. SkekSil is reinstated as Chamberlain and gives Kira to the Scientist, skekTek, to be drained of her life essence for the Skeksis to drink and regain their youth. Aughra, imprisoned in the Scientist's laboratory, tells Kira to call the captive animals for help; they break free in response and free Kira while causing skekTek to fall down the crystal shaft to his death. At that moment, his Mystic counterpart, urTih, vanishes in a burst of flame. Aughra frees herself soon after Kira leaves and before Jen arrives.\n\nThe three suns begin to align as the Gelflings reunite at the Crystal Chamber and the Skeksis gather for the ritual that will grant them immortality. When they are discovered and the Garthim attack, Jen leaps onto the Crystal but drops the Shard. Kira takes it after Fizzgig is thrown down the shaft by skekUng, but is saved by Aughra shortly after. Kira throws the Shard back to Jen and is fatally stabbed by the Ritual-Master, skekZok. The heartbroken Jen plunges the Shard into the Dark Crystal, fulfilling the prophecy. The Garthim disintegrate and the Podling slaves regain their essence while the dark stone covering the Castle crumbles away to reveal a crystalline structure. The urRu arrive and use the Crystal to merge themselves and the Skeksis into the beings they once were: the angelic [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#urSkeks|urSkeks]]. Ungim the urSkeks' leader explains to Jen they had mistakenly shattered the Crystal 1,000 years ago, splitting them into two races and decimating Thra, and that Jen's courage and Kira's sacrifice have restored them. The urSkeks revive Kira in gratitude and then ascend to a higher level of existence, leaving the Crystal of Truth to Jen and Kira on the now-rejuvenated Thra.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|Characters and races of The Dark Crystal}}\n'''Main'''\n* [[Stephen Garlick]] as [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Jen|Jen]], a [[Characters and races of The Dark Crystal#Gelflings|Gelfling]] raised by the [[Characters and races of the Dark Crystal#The urRu/Mystics|urRu]] and entrusted to restore the Dark Crystal.

The original plot involved a malevolent race called the Reptus group, which took power in a coup against the peaceful Eunaze, led by Malcolm the Wise. The last survivor of the Eunaze was Malcolm's son Brian, who was adopted by the Bada, Mithra's mystical wizards.<ref name=\"mithra\">Jim Henson, ''The Mithra Treatment'' [DVD special Feature]. ''The Dark Cyrstal: Collector's Edition'', Dir. Jim Henson & Frank Oz. 1982. Colombia Tristar Home Entertainment, 2003. DVD.</ref>\n\nThis draft contained elements in the final product, including the three races, the two funerals, the quest, a female secondary character, the Crystal, and the reunification of the two races during the Great Conjunction. \"Mithra\" was later abbreviated to \"Thra\", due to similarities the original name had with an ancient [[Mithra|Persian deity]].<ref name=\"odell2012\"/> The character Kira was also at that point called Dee.<ref name=\"froud2003\"/>\n\nMost of the philosophical undertones of the film were inspired from [[Jane Roberts]]'s \"[[Seth Material]]\". Henson kept multiple copies of the book ''Seth Speaks'', and insisted that Froud and screenwriter [[David Odell]] read it prior to collaborating for the film. Odell later wrote that Aughra's line \"He could be anywhere then,\" upon being told by Jen that his Master was dead, could not have been written without having first read Roberts' material.<ref name=\"odell2012\"/>\n\nThe Bada were renamed \"Ooo-urrrs\", which Henson would pronounce \"very slowly and with a deep resonant voice.\" Odell simplified the spelling to urRu, though they were ultimately named Mystics in the theatrical cut. The word \"Skeksis\" was initially meant to be the plural, with \"Skesis\" being singular, though this was dropped early in the filming process. Originally, Henson wanted the Skeksis to speak their own [[constructed language]], with the dialogue [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]] in English.<ref name=\"odell2012\"/>\n\nAccounts differ as to who constructed the language, and on what it was based. [[Gary Kurtz]] stated that the Skeksis language was conceived by author [[Alan Garner]], who based it on [[Ancient Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]],<ref name=\"kurtz\">Hutchinson, David. \"[https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-066/066#page/n17/mode/2up Producing the world of The Dark Crystal: A new direction for the man behind \u2018Star Wars\" and \"Empire\" Gary Kurtz]\". ''Starlog: The Magazine of the Future''. 66 (January 1983):19-20.</ref> while Odell stated it was he who created it, and that it was formed from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Root word|root]]s. This idea was dropped after [[test screening]] audiences found the captions too distracting, but the original effect can be observed in selected scenes on the various DVD releases.<ref name=\"odell2012\"/> The language of the Podlings was based on [[Serbo-Croatian]], with Kurtz noting that audience members fluent in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and other [[Slavic languages]] could understand individual words, but not whole sentences.<ref name=\"kurtz\"/>\n[[File:Gordale Beck flowing down Gordale Scar - geograph.org.uk - 872118.jpg|thumb|[[Gordale Scar]], one of the locations used in filming]]\nThe film was shot at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] from April\u2013September 1981, and exterior scenes were shot in the [[Scottish Highlands]]; [[Gordale Scar]], [[North Yorkshire]], England; and [[Twycross]], [[Leicestershire]], England. Once filming was completed, the film's release was delayed after [[Lew Grade]] sold [[ITC Entertainment]] to [[Robert Holmes \u00e0 Court]], who was skeptical of the film's potential, due to the bad reactions at the preview and the need to re-voice the film's soundtrack. The film was afforded minimal advertisement and release until Henson bought it from Holmes \u00e0 Court and funded its release with his own money.<ref name=\"odell2012\"/>\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Skeksis on Display.jpg|thumb|The original Skeksis costume skekUng on display at the Center for Puppetry Arts in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].]]\n[[Brian Froud]] was chosen as concept artist after Henson saw one of his paintings in the book ''Once upon a time''.<ref name=\"froud2003\"/> The characters in the film are elaborate puppets, and none are based on humans or any other specific [[Earth]] creature. Before its release, ''The Dark Crystal'' was billed as the first live-action film without any human beings on screen, and \"a showcase for cutting-edge animatronics\".{{sfn|Wright|2005}}\n\nThe hands and facial features of the groundbreaking animatronic puppets in the film were controlled with relatively primitive rods and cables, although radio control later took over many of the subtler movements.{{sfn|Rickitt|2000|p=225}} Human performers inside the puppets supplied basic movement for the larger creatures, which in some cases was dangerous or exhausting; for example, the Garthim costumes were so heavy (approx. 70 pounds) that the performers had to be hung up on a rack every few minutes to rest while still inside the costumes.{{sfn|Bacon|1997|p=24}} [[Switzerland|Swiss]] mime Jean-Pierre Amiel led a team of dancers, acrobats and others in performing the Mystics,<ref name=\"world\">Making-of.

Another performer would operate the Skeksis' right arm. A team of four technicians operated the Skeksis' hand and face animatronics. The Skeksis performers compensated for their lack of vision by having a monitor tied to their chests.<ref name=\"shard\">Making-of. ''Reflections of the Dark Crystal: Shard of Illusion''. Dir.

DVD.</ref> The Chamberlain Skeksis, in particular, was built with 21 electronic components.\n\n[[File:UrRu.jpg|thumb|left|Mystic puppet, [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of American History]].]]\nIn designing the Mystics, Froud portrayed them as being more connected to the natural world than their Skeksis counterparts. Henson intended to convey the idea that they were purged of all materialistic urges, yet were incapable of acting in the real world. Froud also incorporated geometric symbolism throughout the film in order to hint at the implied unity of the two races.<ref name=\"light\"/> The Mystics were the hardest creatures to perform, as the actors had to walk on their haunches with their right arm extended forward, with the full weight of the head on it. Henson stated that he could hold a position in a Mystic costume for only 5\u201310 seconds.<ref name=\"world\"/>\n\nThe Gelflings were designed and sculpted by [[Wendy Froud|Wendy Midener]]. They were difficult to perform, as they were meant to be the most human creatures in the film, and thus their movements, particularly their gait, had to be as realistic as possible. During scenes when the Gelflings' legs were off-camera, the performers walked on their knees in order to make the character's movements more lifelike.<ref name=\"shard\"/> According to Odell, the character Jen was Henson's way of projecting himself into the film.<ref name=\"light\"/> Jen was originally meant to be blue, in homage to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity [[Rama]], but this idea was scrapped early on.<ref name=\"mcara2013\"/>\n\nAughra was originally envisioned as a \"busy, curious little creature\" called Habeetabat, though the name was rejected by Froud, who found the name too similar to Habitat, a retailer he despised. The character was re-envisioned as a seer or prophetess, and renamed Aughra. In selecting a voice actor for Aughra, Henson was inspired by [[Zero Mostel]]'s performance as a \"kind of insane bird trying to overcome Tourettes syndrome\" on ''[[Watership Down (film)|Watership Down]]''. Although the character was originally voiced by Oz, Henson wanted a female voice, and subsequently selected [[Billie Whitelaw]].<ref name=\"odell2012\"/>\n\nThe character Fizzgig was invented by Oz, who wanted a character who served the same function as the Muppet poodle Foo-Foo, feeling that, like [[Miss Piggy]], the character Kira needed an outlet for her caring, nurturing side.<ref name=\"odell2012\"/> The character's design was meant to convey the idea of a \"boyfriend-repellant\", to contrast the popular idea that it is easier to form a bond with a member of the opposite sex with the assistance of a cute dog.<ref name=\"light\"/>\n\nThe Podlings were envisioned as people in complete harmony with their natural surroundings, thus Froud based their design on that of potatoes.<ref name=\"world\"/> Their village was modeled on the Henson family home.<ref name=\"light\"/>\n\nIn designing the Garthim, Froud took inspiration from the discarded carapaces of his and Henson's lobster dinners.<ref name=\"froud2003\"/><ref name=\"light\"/> The Garthim were first designed three years into the making of the film, and were made largely of fiberglass.

C. H. Smith]]. Henson took a keen interest in the novelization, as he considered it a legitimate part of the film's world rather than just an advertisement. He originally asked [[Alan Garner]] to write it, but Garner declined on account of prior engagements. Henson and Smith met several times over meals to discuss the progress of the manuscript. According to Smith, their only major disagreement had arisen over his dislike of the Podlings, which he considered \"boring\". He included a scene in which a Garthim carrying a sackful of Podlings fell down a cliff and crushed them. Henson considered this scene to be an element of \"gratuitous cruelty\" that did not fit well into the scope of the story. In order to assist Smith in his visualizing the world of ''The Dark Crystal'', Henson invited him to visit Elstree Studios during filming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsoundz.co.uk/2012/08/07/labyrinth-the-25th-anniversary-podcast/#.UhTs-D91jIU|title=Jim Henson's Labyrinth \u2013 The 25th Anniversary Podcast with ACH Smith and Sam Downie \u2013 Sam Downie|website=Dsoundz.co.uk|access-date=October 30, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021211/http://dsoundz.co.uk/2012/08/07/labyrinth-the-25th-anniversary-podcast/#.UhTs-D91jIU|url-status=dead}}</ref> In June 2014, [[Archaia Entertainment]] reprinted the novelization, with included extras such as some of Brian Froud's illustrations and Jim Henson's notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaw.com/Profile/Jim-Hensons-Dark-Crystal-HC-Novel___451278|title=Jim Hensons Dark Crystal HC Novel @TFAW.com|website=Things From Another World|access-date=October 30, 2017|archive-date=December 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207235632/http://www.tfaw.com/Profile/Jim-Hensons-Dark-Crystal-HC-Novel___451278|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Future==\n===Cancelled sequel===\nDuring the development phase of ''The Dark Crystal'', director Jim Henson and writer David Odell discussed ideas for a possible sequel.
