It stars Luke Edwards, [[Timothy Busfield]], and [[Dennis Farina]]. The film is director [[Andrew Scheinman]]'s first and only feature film directorial project.\n\n==Plot==\nBilly Heywood, the 12-year-old son of widowed Jenny, is a [[Little League Baseball]] player. Billy's paternal grandfather, Thomas Heywood, owns the [[Minnesota Twins]].\n\nWhen Thomas dies, Billy learns that he is now the owner of the Twins. Thomas' will specifies that the team executives are to help Billy until he is old enough to run the team by himself.\n\nBilly quickly runs afoul of the team [[Manager (baseball)|manager]], George O'Farrell. Billy believes O'Farrell is too hard on the players, while O'Farrell despises the idea of working for a kid. After O'Farrell repeatedly insults Billy,  Billy fires him.\n\nWith no other managers willing to work for a kid, and with his grade-school summer break starting in two days, the baseball-savvy Billy decides to name himself the new manager. He reaches out to the Commissioner of Baseball, who approves after consulting with Jenny.\n\nThe players are very skeptical, but Billy promises that if he does not improve the team's last-place position in the standings within a few weeks, he will resign. The team quickly moves up to division race contention. Unfortunately, not all is going smoothly for Billy, as his friend and star first baseman Lou Collins takes a romantic interest in Jenny.\n\nBilly picks up bad habits on the road, and is even [[Ejection (sports)|ejected]] from a game and given a one-game \"suspension\" by his mother for swearing at an [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] because of a call he didn't like. He is troubled when he must release his personal favorite Twins player, Jerry Johnson, who is in the twilight of his career; Billy's awkward handling of the situation ends up making Jerry feel even worse.\n\nThe pressures of managing the team wear Billy down and consume his free time. Billy's friends do not like how his managerial responsibilities are keeping him away from being with them. Even when he's physically present (as opposed to on the road with the team), he is typically distracted by team business.\n\nAfter Jenny spends her birthday with Lou rather than Billy, Billy uses Lou's minor batting-slump as an excuse to bench him, sending the Twins into a losing skid. Billy later tells his mom that he's tired of being a \"grown-up\" and decides to quit as manager after the end of the season, even reinstating Lou to starter on first base.\n\nWith four games left in the season, the Twins trail the [[Seattle Mariners]] by four games in the [[Major League Baseball Wild Card Game|wild card]] race. The Twins win their last four while the Mariners lose four straight, forcing a [[One-game playoff]] at the Twins' [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] to determine who advances to the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]].\n\nThe two teams trade three-run home runs during the course of the game, and [[extra innings]] are required. The Mariners eventually take the lead. Down to their final out, and Lou about to go up to bat, he tells Billy that he has asked Jenny to marry him, and that her reply was \"Ask Billy\". With a runner on base, Billy says if Lou hits the game-winning homer he will give his blessing, but quickly relents and gives Lou his consent whether or not he hits a homer. Facing [[Randy Johnson]], Lou hits a long fly ball to center field, but [[Ken Griffey Jr.]] makes a leaping catch at the wall to rob Lou of a homer and end the game.\n\nWith their season over, Billy tells the players he is officially stepping down as manager, with pitching coach Mac MacNally taking his place, as well as bringing back Jerry Johnson to be the third base coach and new hitting instructor. The players object to losing Billy, but he reminds the team that he will still be present as the owner, and says that he might come back as manager if junior high doesn't work out. When being informed that none of the fans have left, Billy, along with the rest of the team, returns to the field to receive a standing ovation.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* Luke Edwards as Billy Heywood (manager - #20)\n* [[Timothy Busfield]] as Lou Collins (first base - #4)\n* [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]] as Mac Macnally (pitching coach - #56)\n* [[Ashley Crow]] as Jenny Heywood\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Arthur Goslin (general manager)\n* Billy L.
