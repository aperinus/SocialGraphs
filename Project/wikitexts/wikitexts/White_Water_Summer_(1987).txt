That is, until his parents introduce him to Vic, a charming wilderness survival guide. Vic convinces them that six weeks off the grid is exactly what Alan needs to become a man.\n\nAlan reluctantly joins Vic and three other teens \u2013 Chris, Mitch and George \u2013 for a trek into the great outdoors. However, he is taunted by Chris and George and learns that Vic is deadly serious about his job. On their first night, Alan carves his initials into a tree. After Vic finds out, he calls the others to vote on his punishment. They take away his knife.\n\nIn another incident, Vic asks Alan to be his bowman while white water rafting. Alan is unprepared and loses an oar. Later, Vic asks the boys to cross a dangerous rope bridge. Alan crosses it with the others but leaves their tent poles behind. Upon realizing this, Vic sends him back to collect them alone. Despite his best efforts, Alan fails to cross the bridge. Embarrassed, he returns and explains that he could not find them, but Vic catches him in his lie; he watched him the entire way and even retrieved the poles.\n\nThe tension between Alan and Vic escalates when the group goes fishing on an island. Instead of following Vic's lead and catching them with his bare hands, Alan invents a fish trap. Furious, Vic tosses the fish he caught and forces him to clean the others\u2019 fish. Alan refuses and Vic leaves with the group, stranding him on the island until the fish are cleaned. Alan stays on the island for the night and refuses to complete the task.\n\nThe next morning, the others retrieve him. When they return, they find that Vic has disappeared. The boys fight with each other about what to do and take cover after a storm hits. Vic suddenly returns the next morning and praises their survival skills.\n\nAlthough everyone has grown weary of Vic, they follow him on their next group activity of climbing Devil's Tooth \u2013 a treacherous peak. When they reach a gap, Vic creates a pendulum for the boys to swing across. Alan is last to go but is the only one who does not make the jump. Despite the others\u2019 protests, Vic leaves Alan dangling and instructs him to figure his own way out of it.\n\nChris challenges Vic's leadership and Vic retaliates by holding him over the edge of a cliff. Left to his own devices, Alan creates enough momentum to swing across. He confronts Vic and a foot chase ensues. Furious, Chris throws rocks at Vic and hits him with an oar, sending him over the edge of a ravine. With Vic having broken his leg in the fall, Alan creates a pulley and the group hoist him out of the ravine.\n\nAs the group's new leader, Alan instructs the others to follow the river to the ranger station. With Vic stable but losing blood, Alan sits him in a canoe and they raft down a wild river. Alan skillfully navigates the rapids but the canoe capsizes after plunging down a small waterfall. Alan brings Vic to the riverbank. The two share a moment of camaraderie and, soon enough, a rescue helicopter arrives.\n\nYears later, Alan monologues to the audience reflecting on the time he spent with Vic that summer.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Vic\n* [[Sean Astin]] as Alan Block\n* [[Charles Siebert]] as Jerry Block\n* [[Caroline McWilliams]] as Virginia Block\n* [[Jonathan Ward (actor)|Jonathan Ward]] as Mitch\n* [[Matt Adler]] as Chris\n* [[K.C.
