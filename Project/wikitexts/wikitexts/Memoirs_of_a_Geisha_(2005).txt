It stars [[Zhang Ziyi]] in the lead role, with [[Ken Watanabe]], [[Gong Li]], [[Michelle Yeoh]], [[Youki Kudoh]], [[Suzuka Ohgo]], and [[Samantha Futerman]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Steven Spielberg]] (through production companies [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures]]) and [[Douglas Wick]] (through Red Wagon Entertainment). Production was split between southern and northern [[California]] and a number of locations in [[Kyoto]], including the [[Kiyomizu-dera|Kiyomizu temple]] and the [[Fushimi Inari-taisha|Fushimi Inari shrine]]. It was released in the United States on December 9, 2005, by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[DreamWorks Pictures]], with the latter receiving studio credit only.\n\nThe film was released to polarized reviews from critics worldwide and was moderately successful at the box office. It was also nominated for and won numerous awards, including nominations for six [[Academy Awards]], and eventually won three: [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. The acting, visuals, sets, costumes, and the musical score (composed by Spielberg's long time collaborator [[John Williams]]) were praised, but the film was criticized for casting some non-Japanese actresses as Japanese women and for its [[style over substance]] approach. The Japanese release of the film was titled ''Sayuri'', the titular character's geisha name.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1929, Chiyo Sakamoto and her older sister Satsu are sold off by their poor father and taken to [[Gion]], [[Kyoto]]. Chiyo is taken in by Kayoko Nitta, known as \"Mother\", the proprietress of a local {{transliteration|ja|[[okiya]]}}; Satsu, deemed too unattractive, is sent to a brothel instead. Chiyo also meets \"Granny\" and \"Auntie\", the other women who run the house; Pumpkin, another young girl; and the {{transliteration|ja|okiya}}'s resident geisha, Hatsumomo.\n\nPumpkin and Chiyo soon begin their education to become future geisha. Hatsumomo, seeing Chiyo as a potential rival, immediately treats her with abuse. Hoping Chiyo will run away, Hatsumomo tells her where she can find Satsu in the [[y\u016bkaku|red light district]]. They make plans to run away the following night. When Chiyo tries to escape via the rooftops, she falls and is injured. As a result, Mother stops investing in Chiyo's geisha training and instead makes her a menial servant to pay off her debts. Satsu flees Kyoto and Chiyo never sees her again.\n\nOne day, while crying on a riverbank, Chiyo encounters Chairman Ken Iwamura. He buys her a shaved ice dessert and gives her his handkerchief and some money to cheer her up. Touched by his kindness, Chiyo resolves to become a geisha so that she might become a part of the Chairman's life.\n\nSeveral years later, Pumpkin debuts as a {{transliteration|ja|[[maiko]]}} under Hatsumomo's tutelage. Shortly afterwards, Chiyo is taken under the wing of Mameha, one of the district's most prominent geisha, who persuades Mother to reinvest in Chiyo's geisha training, promising to pay her twice over after her debut. Chiyo becomes a {{transliteration|ja|maiko}} and receives the name Sayuri. At a [[sumo]] match, Sayuri is reintroduced to the Chairman, but attracts the attention of his gruff business partner Toshikazu Nobu.\n\nThanks to Mameha's efforts, and in spite of Hatsumomo's scheming, Sayuri rises in popularity; attracting the attention of many men; including Dr. Crab, and the Baron, Mameha's own {{transliteration|ja|[[Geisha#Danna partnership|danna]]}}. In a bidding war for Sayuri's [[mizuage|deflowering ceremony]], as part of her becoming a full geisha, the winning bid is a record-breaking amount from Dr. Crab. Mother immediately names Sayuri as her adopted daughter and the heiress to the {{transliteration|ja|okiya}}, crushing Pumpkin and enraging Hatsumomo.\n\nUpon returning home from the ceremony, Sayuri finds a drunken Hatsumomo in her room, where the latter has found the Chairman's handkerchief. This leads to a fight between the two, in which Hatsumomo eventually starts a fire in the {{transliteration|ja|okiya}}. Though the building is saved, Hatsumomo is banished from Gion.\n\nSayuri's successful career is cut short by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The Chairman relocates her to safety of the countryside, where she works for a kimono maker. After the war ends, Nobu asks Sayuri to help him impress an American Colonel who could approve funding for their business. Sayuri reunites with Mameha, who reluctantly agrees to help Sayuri impress the Colonel, as well as Pumpkin, who is now working as an escort.\n\nSayuri travels with Nobu, the Chairman, Mameha, Pumpkin, and the American soldiers to the [[Amami Islands]]. The Colonel propositions Sayuri, but she rejects him. Nobu confronts Sayuri after seeing this and confesses his desire to become her {{transliteration|ja|danna}}. Sayuri devises a plan to have Nobu catch her being intimate with the Colonel so that he will lose interest, and enlists Pumpkin's help to do so. However, Pumpkin brings the Chairman instead. When confronted, Pumpkin declares it her revenge for Sayuri being adopted by Mother instead of her. Disheartened, Sayuri decides to give up on her pursuit for the Chairman.\n\nAfter returning to Gion, Sayuri is summoned to a nearby tea-house. Expecting Nobu, Sayuri is instead surprised to see the Chairman. The Chairman confesses his feelings for her, that he always knew of her identity but refused to interfere with Nobu's feelings out of respect, and that he himself arranged for Mameha to become her mentor. Sayuri is finally able to confess her love to the Chairman and they share a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Zhang Ziyi|Ziyi Zhang]] as Chiyo Sakamoto/Sayuri Nitta\n** [[Suzuka Ohgo]] as young Chiyo\n** [[Shizuko Hoshi]] as older Chiyo (voice-over narrator)\n* [[Ken Watanabe]] as Chairman Ken Iwamura\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]] as Mameha\n* [[Gong Li]] as Hatsumomo\n* [[K\u014dji Yakusho]] as Nobu\n* [[Kaori Momoi]] as Kayoko \"Mother\" Nitta\n* [[Youki Kudoh]] as Pumpkin\n** [[Zoe Weizenbaum]] as young Pumpkin\n* [[Samantha Futerman]] as Satsu Sakamoto\n* [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] as Mr. Sakamoto\n* [[Elizabeth Sung]] as Mrs. Sakamoto\n* Kotoko Kawamura as Grandmother Nitta \n* [[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]] as Auntie\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as the Baron\n* [[Kenneth Tsang]] as the General\n* [[Eugenia Yuan]] as Korin\n* [[Karl Yune]] as Koichi\n* [[Ted Levine]] as Col.

The following year, Steven Spielberg planned to make ''Memoirs of a Geisha'' as the follow-up to ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', bringing in his company DreamWorks. Spielberg's DreamWorks partner [[David Geffen]] attempted to persuade him not to take the project, feeling it was \"not good enough for him\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/mar/21/awardsandprizes.stevenspielberg|title=Inside the dream factory|first=Stephen J.|last=Dubner|date=March 21, 1999|work=the Guardian}}</ref> Prior to Spielberg's involvement, the film was planned to be shot in Japan in the Japanese language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/mia/part2.htm|title=Washingtonpost.com: Made In America|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> By 2002, with Spielberg having postponed production for ''[[A.I.

This brought a third company into ''Memoirs of a Geisha'', as Marshall was still signed to release his next film through ''Chicago'' distributors [[Miramax]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/news/geisha-s-elusive-charms-1117895703/|title='Geisha's' elusive charms|first=Gabriel|last=Snyder|date=November 16, 2003|work=Variety}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/markets-festivals/inside-move-marshall-to-serve-geisha-1117887872/|title=Inside Move: Marshall to serve 'Geisha'|first=Michael|last=Fleming|date=June 13, 2003|work=Variety}}</ref>\n\nThe three leading non-Japanese actresses, including Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li, and Michelle Yeoh, were put through \"geisha boot camp\" before production commenced, during which they were trained in traditional geisha practices of [[Japanese music]], [[Japanese dance|dance]], and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]].

It was decided that contemporary Japan looked too modern for a story set in pre- and post-war Japan, meaning that many scenes were filmed on cost-effective soundstages or on location in the United States, primarily California. The majority of the film was shot on a large set built on a ranch in [[Thousand Oaks]], California.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-mar-06-et-cinematography6-story.html|title=The rest of the best|date=March 6, 2006|via=LA Times}}</ref> Most interior scenes were filmed in [[Culver City]], California at the [[Sony Pictures Studios]] lot. Other locations in California included San Francisco, [[Moss Beach, California|Moss Beach]], [[Descanso Gardens]] in [[La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, California|La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], Yamashiro's Restaurant in Hollywood, the Japanese Gardens at the [[Huntington Library|Huntington Library and Gardens]] in [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], [[Hakone Gardens]] in [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], and [[Downtown Los Angeles]] at the Belasco Theater on Hill Street. Towards the end of production, some scenes were shot in Kyoto, including the Fushimi Inari-Taisha, the head [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] of [[Inari \u014ckami|Inari]], located in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.\n\n===Post-production===\nOne of the tasks faced by sound editors in post-production was improving the English pronunciation of the cast, which in part involved piecing together different dialogue clips from other segments of the film to form missing syllables in the actors' speech, as some only spoke partially [[phonetic]] English when performing. The achievement of the sound editors earned the film an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Achievement in Sound Editing.\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\nThe film debuted on [[DVD]], in both Widescreen and Fullscreen versions, on March 28, 2006. The release was a 2-Disc set, with a second disc dedicated to special features. The film was consequently released on the [[Blu-ray]] format on September 25, 2007. The Blu-ray received positive reviews, for the video and audio quality and for porting over every single extra from the 2-Disc DVD release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/dvd/Memoirs-of-a-Geisha-DVD/14894/|title = Memoirs of a Geisha DVD (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Memoirs-of-a-Geisha-Blu-ray/500/|title=Memoirs of a Geisha Blu-ray}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn the Western hemisphere, the film received mixed reviews.

All three were already prominent actresses in Chinese cinema. The film's producers defended the position, stating that the main priorities in casting the three main roles were \"acting ability and star power\".
