Inspired by the 1965 film ''[[The Big Job (film)|The Big Job]]'', the film stars [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Dave Chappelle]], [[Peter Greene]], [[Nicole Ari Parker]] and [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]. Lawrence plays Miles, a jewel thief who tries to retrieve a diamond he left at a police station, whereupon he disguises himself as a detective and gets paired with a real policeman to investigate burglaries. The film was shot on location in [[California]]. The prime shooting spot was [[Sony Pictures]] Studios, which is located in [[Culver City, California]].\n\n''Blue Streak'' was released theatrically by [[Columbia Pictures]] on September 9, 1999 and opened as the number one movie in [[North America]]. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it went on to gross nearly $120 million at the worldwide box office against a $36 million budget.<ref name=\"Mojo\" /> The film's [[Blue Streak (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] album, featuring a number of popular urban/hip-hop artists, was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]].\n\n==Plot==\nJewel thief Miles Logan participates in a $17 million [[diamond]] heist in [[Los Angeles]], along with his crew of accomplices, his right hand and best friend Eddie, his getaway driver Tully and Deacon, the newly acquired member of the group, he turns on them, killing Eddie by shooting him off of a tall building and causing him to fall onto a police car, before attempting to take the stone from Miles. As the police arrive, Miles hides the diamond in the ducts of a building under construction; as Deacon flees, Miles is arrested.\n\nUpon his release from prison two years later, Miles attempts to reunite with his girlfriend, who breaks it off for lying about being a criminal, prompting him to retrieve the diamond. Finding the building where he hid the diamond is now an [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] police station, he goes inside, discovering the diamond is hidden in the ducts of what is now the Robbery/Homicide detective bureau, which requires a key card to access.\n\nMiles returns disguised as a pizza deliveryman, steals an access card and visits his forger Uncle Lou. The fake badge and transfer papers allow Miles to enter the station, posing as newly-transferred police detective Malone. While trying to access the ducts, he inadvertently foils a prisoner escape and is teamed up with newly-appointed Detective Carlson.\n\nWhat is supposed to be a quick in and out mission to retrieve the diamond ends up turning into a prolonged endeavor as Miles gets sent out on calls.  His knowledge on criminal activity and ability to foil crimes makes him quite popular among his \"peers,\u201d even getting promoted to detective in charge of the Robbery/Homicide division. He and Carlson are first sent on a burglary call, where Miles quickly solves it as fraud perpetrated by the owner. On the ride back, they stumble upon an armed robbery being committed by Tulley. Miles intervenes, arresting him before he's shot, but Tulley demands $50,000 to keep quiet about who Miles really is. He makes another attempt to locate the diamond, but is interrupted by Carlson, who has discovered Miles is not who he claims to be. Convincing Carlson that he is from [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]], Miles tries to get back to searching for the diamond, but they are sent out on another call. While out, they capture a truckload of [[heroin]]. Afterwards, Miles finds the diamond in the evidence locker and finally has it, but accidentally drops it into the load of heroin they seized. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] demands the heroin for testing.\n\nA panicked Miles suggests the FBI and his cops unit use the heroin as bait in a [[Sting operation|sting]]. He arranges to be with the heroin in the delivery truck, but is soon joined by Tulley (whom he had set free from holding) and Deacon; during the drug deal, Deacon exposes Miles as a cop to the drug runners. While Miles and Tulley attempt to distract them, the police and FBI raid the deal. Deacon escapes with the diamond in an armored truck and the police and FBI follow as he approaches the border to [[Mexico]]. The police and FBI are forced to halt their pursuit at the border, but Miles steals a patrol car and chases Deacon. Miles forces him to wreck the truck and offers him a deal: Deacon gives Miles the diamond and allows him to arrest him in exchange for Miles taking him back to the US and cutting him back in on the diamond. He agrees, and Miles immediately double-crosses him by handcuffing him to the wrecked truck for the [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federales]] and begins to walk back to the border. Deacon draws a gun to shoot him but Miles turns and shoots him dead, avenging the death of Eddie.\n\nMiles walks back to the border where both the FBI and police demand explanations; he tells them he is an undercover Mexican officer and has to report back to his fellow Federales. A  few inches over the border, Carlson and Hardcastle stop him, revealing they know who he really is, but do not arrest him as they are grateful for all of his help and see him as a friend. They also say the FBI can't reach him over international borders, as he is a few inches over the border. After they share a bittersweet goodbye, Miles heads off to Mexico with the diamond.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Miles Logan/Detective Malone\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Detective Carlson\n* [[Dave Chappelle]] as Tulley\n* [[Peter Greene]] as Deacon\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as Detective Hardcastle\n* [[Graham Beckel]] as Lieutenant Rizzo\n* [[Robert Miranda (actor)|Robert Miranda]] as Detective Glenfiddish\n* [[Aleksander Krupa|Olek Krupa]] as Jean LaFleur\n* [[Saverio Guerra]] as Benny\n* [[Richard C.
