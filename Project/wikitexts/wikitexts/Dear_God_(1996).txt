He is sentenced by the judge to find a full-time job by the end of the week and keep it for at least a year, or be sent to jail.\n\nTom finds work at the post office sorting mail in the [[dead letter office]]. Surrounded by quirky coworkers, Tom finds out what happens to letters addressed to the [[Easter Bunny]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[God]], and out of curiosity reads one of the letters sent to God.\n\nWhile reading the letter, sent by a needy single mother, Tom accidentally drops his paycheck; it is mailed back to her. When Tom comes to retrieve his paycheck, he sees the good it has done and leaves, not knowing that Rebecca, a burnt-out workaholic lawyer coworker doing pro-bono work, has seen him doing so.\n\nBelieving Tom sent the money on purpose, Rebecca rallies the rest of the dead letter office workers to continue what Tom has started. Tom, becoming the unwilling leader of the group, starts answering more and more letters sent to the post office asking God for help. Hilarity ensues as the group answers more prayers, enriching people's lives, while Tom tries to find love with Gloria, a coffee bar waitress, and keep out of jail.\n\nAfter the loan shark trashes Tom's apartment, things are replaced by 'God' or rather his coworkers. Webster, Junior's 'heavy', stops by to let him know that he was hit by a bus, so is off the hook for the loan.\n\nMiraculously others begin to step up, replacing Christmas presents stolen from the Salvation Army, the Santa Monica homeless had canned goods delivered to them as requested, and 5,000 in cash comes in. Tom, believing it's a trap, suggests they lay low for awhile.\n\nThe postmaster general announces on a news report that it is a federal offense for postal workers to open mail not addressed to them. The postal police show up to arrest Idris Abraham, as he took responsibility for giving a homeless man a trumpet.\n\nTom confesses, saying it was all him on TV. Rebecca, acting as his defense attourney, calls the other postal workers from the department. As she's making her closing statements Herman, fellow postal worker who sees she's losing, calls in postal carriers from throughout LA. They fill the streets around the courthouse demanding Tom be released.\n\nThe judges declares him not guilty, only holding him to complete the 12 months of work sentenced to him in the previous hearing.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main cast===\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Tom Turner\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Judge (lower court)\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Rebecca Frazen\n* [[Maria Pitillo]] as Gloria McKinney\n* [[Tim Conway]] as Herman Dooly\n* [[Anna Maria Horsford]] as Lucille Barnett\n* [[Hector Elizondo]] as Vladek Vidov\n* [[Jon Seda]] as Handsome\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as Idris Abraham\n* [[John Pinette]] as Junior\n* [[Coolio]] as Gerard\n* [[Toby Huss]] as Doubting Thomas Minister\n* [[Jack Klugman]] as Jemi\n* [[Rue McClanahan]] as Mom Turner\n* [[Stephanie Niznik]] as Emanda Maine\n* [[Israel Juarbe]] as Ernesto on Scaffold\n}}\n\n===Uncredited cameos===\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Garry Marshall]] as Preston Sweeney, Postmaster\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] as Himself\n* [[Tony Danza]] as Himself\n* [[Christopher Darden]] as Himself\n* [[Cassandra Peterson]] as Herself\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Dear God'' received generally negative reviews from critics. [[Siskel & Ebert]] gave the film two thumbs down upon its release.<ref>[http://www.obkb.com/dcljr/serevtxt.html#nov96 Siskel/Ebert reviews 1991-96<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] gave the film one star and explained, \"At least after seeing this movie, I understand where the title came from &ndash; starting about thirty minutes into this interminable, unfunny feature, I began looking at my watch every few minutes and thinking, 'Dear God, is this ever going to end?' A sickeningly bad pastiche of much better pictures &ndash; ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'', and (believe it or not) ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' all leap to mind &ndash; ''Dear God is'' the worst excuse for a holiday film since [[Nora Ephron]]'s hideous ''[[Mixed Nuts]]''.\"<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/dear_god.html Review: Dear God<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs of December 2020, film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] had given the film a 12% positive rating, based on reviews from 34 critics. The consensus summarizes: \"''Dear God'' never had a prayer, with Greg Kinnear's angelic charisma weighted down by a screenplay bereft of wit but heavy on schmaltz.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dear_god/ |title = Dear God (1996) |access-date = 1 December 2020 |publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|title=Dear God|id=0116059}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|136680|Dear God}}\n* {{Mojo title|id=deargod|title=Dear God}}\n*''[https://famousclowns.org/movie-clowns/tim-conway-movies/dear-god/} Dear God]'' at Famous Clowns\n\n{{Garry Marshall}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Garry Marshall]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Rysher Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films about con artists]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Postal Service]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
