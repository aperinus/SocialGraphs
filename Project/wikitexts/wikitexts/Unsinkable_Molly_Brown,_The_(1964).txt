The screenplay by [[Helen Deutsch]] is based on the [[libretto|book]] of the 1960 musical ''[[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]'' by Richard Morris. The song score was composed by [[Meredith Willson]]. The plot is a fictionalized account of the life of [[Margaret Brown]], who survived the 1912 sinking of the {{RMS|Titanic}}. Debbie Reynolds was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her portrayal of Brown.\n\n==Plot==\nRescued from the [[Colorado River]] as an infant and raised by Seamus Tobin, tomboy [[Margaret Brown|Molly Tobin]] is determined to find a wealthy man to marry. She journeys to [[Leadville, Colorado]] and is hired as a saloon singer by Christmas Morgan. After miner Johnny Brown renovates his cabin, the two wed, and he sells his claim in a silver mine for $300,000.\n\nThe Browns and Seamus move into a [[Denver]] mansion, and Molly sets out to improve her [[social status]] by trying to ingratiate herself with the city's elite, all of whom snub her and her [[nouveau riche]] ways. She and Johnny go to [[Europe]], where they are embraced by royalty, and the couple return to Denver with their new friends. Molly's plan to introduce them to the people who formerly rejected her is derailed by Johnny's rough-and-tumble friends, whose unexpected and boisterous arrival ruins the gala party Molly is hosting.\n\nMolly decides to return to Europe, leaving Johnny behind. She initially falls for the charms of Prince Louis de Lani\u00e8re, but eventually decides she prefers to live with Johnny in Leadville. For the first time in her life, she realizes that someone else's feelings and priorities need to be considered. Setting sail for home aboard the ''[[RMS Titanic]]'', she becomes a heroine when the ship sinks and she helps rescue many of her fellow passengers. When her deed makes international headlines, Molly is welcomed home by Johnny and the people of Denver.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Debbie Reynolds]] as [[Margaret Brown|Molly Brown]]\n* [[Harve Presnell]] as Johnny Brown\n* [[Ed Begley]] as Seamus Tobin\n* [[Jack Kruschen]] as Christmas Morgan\n* [[Hermione Baddeley]] as Buttercup Grogan\n* Vassili Lambrinos as Prince Louis de Lani\u00e8re\n* [[Martita Hunt]] as Grand Duchess Elise Lupovinova\n* [[Harvey Lembeck]] as Polak\n* [[Maria Karnilova]] as Daphne\n* [[Audrey Christie]] as Gladys McGraw\n\n==Production==\n[[Harve Presnell]] was the sole member of the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] cast who was invited to reprise his stage role in the film. Although [[Tammy Grimes]] had originated the title role and had won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical for her performance, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] executives wanted [[Shirley MacLaine]] for the film. After she signed, producer [[Hal Wallis]] claimed she was under contract to him, and MacLaine was forced to withdraw from the project. After this, many people wanted [[Judy Garland]]. Garland was reported to be the star of the film in 1961. When [[Debbie Reynolds]] was cast instead, MacLaine publicly accused her of agreeing to accept a lower salary in order to land the role, and director Charles Walters, who preferred MacLaine, tried to persuade Reynolds to turn down the part.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=2411&category=Articles ''The Unsinkable Molly Brown'' at Turner Classic Movies]</ref>\n\nExteriors were filmed in the [[Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park]] in western Colorado. Some brief black-and-white footage from the 1953 movie [[Titanic (1953 film)|''Titanic'']], portraying the ill-fated ocean liner's collision with an iceberg and sinking, was interspersed with scenes of Molly Brown aboard the ship and later in a lifeboat.\n\nOnly five of the 17 musical numbers from the stage musical were used in the film, and Meredith Willson wrote \"He's My Friend\" to extend the song score.<ref>Green, Stanley, and Schmidt, Elaine, ''Hollywood Musicals Year By Year''. Hal Leonard Corporation 1999. {{ISBN|0-634-00765-3}}, p. 229</ref> [[Peter Gennaro]], who had choreographed the original Broadway production, staged the musical sequences.\n\nDuring production, MGM was putting all its resources into its forthcoming ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965), and at least $1&nbsp;million was cut from the budget of ''Molly Brown''. Running out of money to complete the film, director [[Charles Walters]] proposed cutting the rousing dance number \"He's My Friend\". To save the number, cast and crew ultimately decided to film it in one rigorous day using multiple cameras to reduce shooting time.<ref name =\"Unsinkable256\">{{cite book  | last = Reynolds  | first = Debbie  | title = Unsinkable: A Memoir | year = 2013  | publisher = HarperCollins Publishers   | isbn = 978-0-06-221365-5  | page=256 }}</ref>\n\nThe film grossed $11,070,559 at the domestic box office.<ref name=\"numbers\">[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1964/00261.php Box Office Information for ''The Unsinkable Molly Brown''] The Numbers.

Weiler of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"big, brassy, bold and freewheeling\" but added, \"The tones are ringing, but often hollow. Molly is a colorful character all right, and the screen, which is as wide as can be, is filled with vivid colors that help project the fact that this is merely a satisfying musical comedy and not an inspired subject.\" He continued, \"This is not to say that Meredith Willson's score is not tuneful and lilting but to this listener it is good, sweet corn that is more palatable than memorable. Mr. Gennaro, on the other hand, has devised dances that more than complement Mr. Willson's music. They may seem to be improvised but they have the true marks of professionalism in their carefully plotted verve, bounce and exuberance.\" He concluded, \"''The Unsinkable Molly Brown'', in the person of Miss Reynolds, and the other principals, often mistakes vigor for art. But Metro's lavish and attractive production numbers make up for this basic superficiality. For all of its shallowness, ''Molly'' is a cheerful and entertaining addition to the local screen scene.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Weiler |first=A.H. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/17/archives/screen-exploits-of-the-unsinkable-molly-browndebbie-reynolds-stars.html |title=Screen: Exploits of 'The Unsinkable Molly Brown':Debbie Reynolds Stars in M-G-M Musical |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 17, 1964 |access-date=September 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201007183752/https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/17/archives/screen-exploits-of-the-unsinkable-molly-browndebbie-reynolds-stars.html |archive-date=October 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed, \"In essence, it's a pretty shallow story since the title character, when you get right down to it, is obsessed with a very superficial, egotistical problem beneath her generous, razzmatazz facade. On top of that, Willson's score is rather undistinguished. Debbie Reynolds thrusts herself into the role with an enormous amount of verve and vigor. At times her approach to the character seems more athletic than artful. Harve Presnell ... makes a generally auspicious screen debut as the patient Johnny. His fine, booming voice and physical stature make him a valuable commodity for Hollywood.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117796039.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Film reviews: The Unsinkable Molly Brown|date=May 27, 1964|page=6}}</ref>\n\n[[Channel 4]] called it an \"amiable comedy with a handful of good tunes\" that \"lacks the satirical bite which its story may suggest. Sometimes the director seems to feel more at ease with the [[melodrama]]tic moments than the comedy ones.\"<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=109761&section=review Channel 4 review]</ref>\n\n''[[Time Out London]]'' noted, \"As ebulliently energetic as ever, Reynolds makes the brash social climbing both funny and touching, but the film itself gets trapped in two minds between satire and sentimentality. The score ... though pleasant, is rather thinly spread; but the sets are a delight in the best traditions of the MGM musical, and Walters does a wonderfully graceful job of direction\".<ref>[https://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/81074/the-unsinkable-molly-brown.html ''Time Out London'' review]</ref>\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' rated the film three out of four stars and commented, \"A rambunctious and spirited effort from Reynolds ... saves this otherwise weakly scripted, familiar musical from the long list of forgotten pictures.\"<ref name=TVG />\n\n===Box office===\nThe film set an opening week record at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City, grossing $222,000 and became the number one film in the US that week.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=National Boxoffice Survey|date=July 22, 1964|page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=How Weather Bops B'way But 'Molly' Record 1st Week's $222,000, 'Seduced' New High 25G; 'Shot' Boffo $38,000|date=July 22, 1964|page=37}}</ref> It went on to be the highest grossing film at the theater, with a 10-week gross of $2&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=New Pix Boost B'way;'Topkapi' Giant 77G; 'Molly' New Music Hall Record of $2,000,000; 'Invasion' Fast 35G|date=September 23, 1964|page=18}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
