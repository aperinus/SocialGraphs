He eventually partners with his friend Stan to form a DJ duo called Cheers around the same time as two of his other friends [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo|Guy-Man]] and [[Thomas Bangalter|Thomas]] form the DJ duo [[Daft Punk]].  He is hoping to become a writer, but he gradually abandons his thesis as his DJing career takes off. In 2001, he and his friend Cyril are invited to New York to DJ at [[MoMA PS1]], but Cyril refuses to go, having finally decided to commit to the graphic novel he had wanted to write. Paul's time in New York is a success, but upon his return he learns that Cyril committed [[suicide]] shortly after completing the work.\n\nFor a while, Paul is a successful DJ, but by 2006 his spending begins to catch up with him as his audience shrinks. He turns to his mother to keep him financially afloat. As his life begins to crumble, he runs into an old girlfriend, Louise. He hopes they can reconnect romantically, but she informs him that she had had an [[abortion]] after becoming pregnant with their child. Paul has a [[nervous breakdown]] and confesses to his mother that he is [[cocaine addiction|addicted]] to [[cocaine]] and is deeply in debt.\n\nBy 2013, Paul has managed to rehabilitate his life and works for a vacuum repair company by day, while attending a creative writing workshop by night. At one of the workshop sessions, he talks to a young girl who asks him what he does. When he tells her he is a former DJ who specialized in garage music, she admits that the only techno she listens to is [[Daft Punk]]. Later, Paul goes to a club where he sees Guy-Man and Thomas again.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* F\u00e9lix de Givry as Paul\n* [[Pauline \u00c9tienne]] as Louise\n* [[Vincent Macaigne]] as Arnaud\n* Hugo Conzelmann as Stan\n* [[Zita Hanrot]] as Ana\u00efs\n* Roman Kolinka as Cyril\n* Ugo Bienvenu as Quentin\n* Paul Spera as Guillaume\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Julia \n* Laurent Cazanave as Nico\n* [[Vincent Lacoste]] as [[Thomas Bangalter|Thomas]]\n* Arnaud Azoulay as [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo|Guy-Man]]\n* Sigrid Bouaziz as Anne-Claire\n* [[Golshifteh Farahani]] as Yasmin\n* [[Laura Smet]] as Margot\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as Larry \n* Claire Tran as Midori\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Sven Hansen-L\u00f8ve and F\u00e9lix de Givry 4.jpg|thumb|right|Sven Hansen-L\u00f8ve (left) served as the inspiration for Paul, played by F\u00e9lix de Givry (right).]]\n\nThe film is loosely based on [[Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve]]'s brother Sven's life. In addition to being the inspiration behind the film he also co-wrote the script.\n\nThe film took three years to be produced in part because obtaining the rights to the music was so expensive. Hansen-L\u00f8ve went through two different producers over the course of the pre-production process and was only able to obtain the necessary rights to license the music after [[Daft Punk]] agreed to license their music for the lowest possible fee causing other musicians to join them.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kinos-Goodin|first1=Jesse|title=TIFF 2014: Daft Punk's surprising role in French house music movie Eden|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2014/9/TIFF-2014-Daft-Punks-surprising-role-in-French-house-music-movie-Eden|accessdate=25 September 2014|date=Sep 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFilming began in November 2013 and was completed on 31 January 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mia Hansen-Love Helming Dance World Saga 'Eden' Starring Brady Corbet and Greta Gerwig|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/mia-hansen-love-helming-dance-world-saga-eden-starring-brady-corbet-and-greta-gerwig-20130904|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=Indiewire|date=4 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006132106/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/mia-hansen-love-helming-dance-world-saga-eden-starring-brady-corbet-and-greta-gerwig-20130904|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Kinology Embarks On Mia Hansen-Love's 'Eden'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/kinology-embarks-on-mia-hansen-loves-eden-1201060827/|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Eden'' received generally positive reviews from critics.
