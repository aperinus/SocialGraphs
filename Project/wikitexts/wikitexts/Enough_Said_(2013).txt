It was filmed in Los Angeles on a budget of $8 million. Gandolfini died after the film was completed but before it was released; Holofcener dedicated the film to him.\n\n''Enough Said'' premiered at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released on Gandolfini\u2019s birthday, September 18, 2013, ranking as the fifth best-reviewed wide release of the year, according to [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The film was praised for Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini's performances, as well as Holofcener's screenplay and received several major award nominations, including for a [[Golden Globe]] for Louis-Dreyfus (her first nomination for a film role), a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], two [[Independent Spirit Awards]] and four [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nEva, a massage therapist and the divorced mother of a teenage girl, attends a party in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] with her friends, married couple Will and Sarah. There she meets a poet, Marianne, and Will introduces Eva to one of his friends, Albert. After the party, Albert asks Will for Eva's number and, although hesitant since she is not physically attracted to him, Eva agrees to go on a date with Albert, which goes well. Marianne contacts Eva for a massage, and after taking an immediate liking to one another they become friends.\n\nEva finds herself growing fonder of Albert and they have lunch with his teenage daughter, Tess, who, like Eva's daughter Ellen, is graduating from high school and moving away to attend college. A few days later, Eva goes to her massage appointment with Marianne and realizes that Albert is Marianne's ex-husband after Marianne tells a story about how he manages to pick out onions when scooping salsa \u2014 the same story Albert had told Eva, but about guacamole. Tess then arrives at the house and Eva's suspicions are confirmed. Marianne tries to introduce Eva to Tess, but Eva hides behind a tree to avoid the meeting. Eva continues seeing Albert, keeping her friendship with Marianne a secret; likewise, she does not tell Marianne that she is seeing him.\n\nEva encourages Marianne to voice her complaints about Albert so she can identify potential problems in her relationship with him. At the encouragement of Eva, Sarah and Will invite her and Albert to a dinner party, which ends badly after Eva nitpicks over Albert's faults, which upsets him. At another appointment with Marianne, Eva is exposed when Albert arrives to drop Tess off. He is angry that Eva kept her friendship with Marianne a secret, and breaks up with her.\n\nEva and her ex-husband take Ellen to the airport for her flight to college. A few months later, on Thanksgiving Day, Eva drives by Albert's home and stops in front of the house on her way to pick up Ellen from the airport. He sees her and she awkwardly waves. He eventually comes outside, to Eva's surprise, and sits with her on the porch while they begin to renew their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Eva\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Albert\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Marianne\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Sarah\n* [[Ben Falcone]] as Will\n* [[Toby Huss]] as Peter\n* [[Anjelah Johnson]] as Cathy\n* [[Michaela Watkins]] as Hilary\n* [[Eve Hewson]] as Tess\n* [[Amy Landecker]] as Debbie\n* [[Christopher Nicholas Smith]] as Hal\n* [[Kathleen Rose Perkins]] as Fran\n* Tracey Fairaway as Ellen\n* Phillip Brock as Jason\n* [[Tavi Gevinson]] as Chloe\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Julia Louis-Dreyfus VF 2012 Shankbone 3.jpg|thumb|right|Julia Louis-Dreyfus was cast after approaching writer/director Nicole Holofcener about a role.]]\n''Enough Said'' was the fifth film written and directed by Nicole Holofcener.<ref name=variety>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/directors-on-their-teams-nicole-holofcener-on-enough-said-1200977374/|last=Gray|first=Tim|title=Directors on Their Teams: Nicole Holofcener on 'Enough Said'|date=December 19, 2013|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> After the release of her fourth film, ''[[Please Give]]'' (2010), she was approached by Matthew Greenfield and Claudia Lewis from [[Fox Searchlight]], who offered to produce Holofcener's next project on the condition that it was more mainstream than her previous films.<ref name=screen>{{cite news|url=http://www.screendaily.com/nicole-holofcener-enough-said/5065203.article|title=Nicole Holofcener, Enough Said|work=[[Screen International]]|date=January 10, 2014|first=Wendy|last=Mitchell|access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> She wrote three drafts of the screenplay over six months.<ref name=variety/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/interview-with-nicole-holofcener-writer-and-director-of-enough-said|title=Interview with Nicole Holofcener \u2013 Writer and Director of Enough Said|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|first=Melissa|last=Silverstein|date=September 20, 2013|access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> The premise was partly inspired by Holofcener's own life as a divorced mother of two teenagers and her \"feelings and fears about what [her] life will be like when [her] kids go away\".<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10382463/Nicole-Holofcener-interview-Gandolfini-was-perfect-belly-and-all.html|title=Nicole Holofcener interview: 'Gandolfini was perfect \u2013 belly and all'|date=October 19, 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Tim|last=Robey|access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref><ref name=times>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/30/entertainment/la-et-mn-sneaks-enough-said-20130901|title=Nicole Holofcener offers telling look at her own life in 'Enough Said'|date=August 30, 2013|first=Nicole|last=Sperling|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> While writing the film, she said, \"I was having thoughts about my ex-husband and my new boyfriend and thinking about being married and how I'm trying to have a relationship that's happier the second time.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/enough-said-director-james-gandolfini-would-have-laughed-about-an-oscar/|title='Enough Said' Director Talks Oscars, James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Chemistry: 'It Was Pretty Instantaneous'|publisher=[[TheWrap]]|first=Brent|last=Lang|date=September 20, 2013|access-date=February 20, 2015}}</ref> Small details of the plot were also drawn from her life;
