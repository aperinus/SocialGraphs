Prominent placement in the film is given to Miller's courtship and marriage to Helen Burger ([[June Allyson]]), and various cameos by actual musicians who were colleagues of Miller.\n\nSeveral turning points in Miller's career are depicted with varying degrees of accuracy, including: the success of an early jazz band arrangement; his departure from the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] pit and sideman work to front a band of his own; the failure of his first band on the road; and the subsequent re-forming of his successful big band and the establishment of the \"Miller Sound\" as typified by \"[[Moonlight Serenade (song)|Moonlight Serenade]]\". Also depicted is Miller's international success touring his band in support of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in World War II.\n\nThere are several [[anachronism]]s in the picture. When the military band led by Miller is playing in front of [[Henry H. Arnold|General \"Hap\" Arnold]], a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bomber is in the background. The marching troops are [[Desegregation#Militias and US Army|desegregated]], which did not occur until 1948. Scenes ostensibly shot in England are clearly staged in the U.S., as witness the presence of [[RCA]] Type 44 [[microphone]]s during a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] broadcast. In reality, the BBC could not afford them and commissioned [[BBC-Marconi Type A microphone|its own, cheaper version]].\n\nIn addition, several key plot points are either highly fictionalized from actual events or were invented for the film:\n* Miller is shown as disliking the tune \"[[Little Brown Jug (song)|Little Brown Jug]]\" and only performing it in 1944 as a \"special arrangement\" for his wife. The song was actually first performed and recorded in 1939,<ref name=\"Moonlight Serenade\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Flower\n| year= 1972\n| title= Moonlight Serenade\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Arlington House\n| location= New Rochelle, New York\n| page= 58\n| isbn= 0-87000-161-2}}</ref> became one of his most popular early hits, and was performed numerous times by both the civilian and AAF Orchestras. The 1939 recording went on to sell over a million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbandlibrary.com/recordsales.html|last=Popa|first=Christopher|title=Record Sales|publisher=Big Band Library}}</ref>\n* Miller was, in fact, dressed down for performing jazz marches and told by a superior officer that [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]]'s marches served the military well in World War I. However, in the film, his character apologizes sheepishly and is only rescued by another officer whose children are fans. Miller's biographer [[George T. Simon]] states that his actual response was \"Are you still flying the same planes you flew in the last war?\",<ref name=\"Glenn Miller and His Orchestra\">{{cite book\n| first= George T.\n| last= Simon\n| author-link= George T.
