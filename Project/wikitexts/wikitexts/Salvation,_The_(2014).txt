The film stars [[Mads Mikkelsen]], [[Eva Green]], [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]], [[Jonathan Pryce]], [[Eric Cantona]], [[Mikael Persbrandt]], [[Douglas Henshall]] and [[Michael Raymond-James]].\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the [[Second Schleswig War]] of 1864, Jon and his brother Peter emigrate to the United States from Denmark and settle somewhere between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Seven years later, in 1871, Jon's wife, Marie and his 10-year-old son, Kresten, arrive. After they all meet, Jon and his family board a stagecoach bound for their small residence while Peter stays behind. Their coach is also boarded by recently released criminals, Paul and Lester. Following a tense struggle, the criminals throw Jon out of the moving coach after which they rape and kill Jon's wife. They also kill his son and the stagecoach driver and guard.\n\nWith great effort, Jon catches up to the coach to find his family murdered. Enraged, he kills the two convicts. Unbeknownst to Jon, Paul is the brother of Henry Delarue, a notorious gang leader and land baron. Upon hearing the news, Delarue kills three innocent citizens of Black Creek, the town that reports the deaths to him. He also forces the townspeople to cooperate and find his brother's killer. Delarue was once an Army Colonel who fought [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. At one point, he is stated to have once been a good man before he became twisted by war.\n\nAfter burying his wife and son, Jon decides to leave the town with Peter and sells his land to Keane, Black Creek's mayor and undertaker. Before they can leave, Jon and Peter are captured by the town Sheriff and minister, Mallick. As Jon sits in his cell, Mallick tells him that his death will buy the town more time while he tries to inform higher authorities of Delarue's actions. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Delarue is working with the Standard Atlantic Oil Company and, with the help of Mayor Keane, had been acquiring Black Creek and its surrounding land, which is rich with untapped crude oil. Unknown to Mallick, the company managed to intercept his message for help and prevent it from reaching the authorities. Delarue's now widowed sister-in-law Madelaine, who is mute, acts as his accountant and suffers sexual and physical abuse from him.\n\nThe next morning, Jon is escorted to Delarue's base, an abandoned town, and is tied to a post and left in the sun. In Black Creek, Peter breaks out of jail and kills several of Delarue's henchmen. He cuts Jon free, and the pair ride off while being pursued by Delarue and his remaining men. Realizing Jon is too weak to carry on, Peter conceals him and leads the gang away, and is eventually caught and killed. Taking advantage of Delarue's absence, Madelaine steals his cash and boards a train. However, the train is intercepted, and she is captured. Delarue tells his men to kill Madelaine after they are done raping her.\n\nJon roams the countryside, looking for water and shelter. He stumbles across a small residence belonging to Mrs. Whistler, whose husband was killed by Delarue. Jon takes shelter in her house to recover from his wounds while Mrs. Whistler and her children flee. After returning to town, he confronts and kills Mayor Keane for his deception. At the general store, he arms himself and reluctantly accepts the help of Voichek, the young storekeeper whose grandmother was killed by Delarue.\n\nJon uses diversions and guerrilla tactics to kill Delarue's henchmen one at a time. Voichek is killed and inadvertently sets fire to the hotel where Madelaine is being held, enabling her to escape. Delarue finds and wounds Jon. Just as he is about to kill Jon, Madelaine shoots Delarue twice, and Jon finishes him with a shot to the head. Sheriff Mallick and his deputies arrive at the scene and thank Jon. When they try to arrest Madelaine, Jon orders them to leave and states that he will be taking her with him. The pair leave together, and the film then reveals that the land is ultimately taken over by the oil company.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as Jon, the Danish settler and the heart of the story\n* [[Eva Green]] as Madelaine, Delarue's mute, widowed sister-in-law\n* [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] as Delarue, a former Yankee Colonel in the civil war, and [[Native Americans in the United States|native American]] killer and now the gang leader and land baron.\n* [[Eric Cantona]] as The Corsican, Delarue's enforcer\n* [[Mikael Persbrandt]] as Peter, Jon's brother\n* [[Douglas Henshall]] as Sheriff Mallick\n* [[Michael Raymond-James]] as Paul\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Mayor Keane\n* [[Alex Arnold (actor)|Alex Arnold]] as Voichek\n* [[Nanna \u00d8land Fabricius]] as Marie, Jon's wife<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Salvation (2014) UK release date, trailer and movie details |url=https://www.tuppencemagazine.co.uk/the-salvation-2014/ |access-date=15 June 2014 |journal=Tuppence Magazine |date=26 May 2014 |last=Harris |first=Gerard}}</ref>\n* Toke Lars Bjarke as Kresten, Jon and Marie's son\n* [[Sean Cameron Michael]] as Lester\n* Carl Nel as Stagecoach Whip\n* Sivan Raphaely as Mrs. Delgado\n* Grant Swanby as Joe No Legs\n* Robert Hobbs as Silvertooth\n* Adam Neill as Mr. Bradley\n* [[Langley Kirkwood]] as Man with Beard\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] began on 8 April 2013 in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Eva Green, Jeffrey Dean Morgan & More Join Mads Mikkelsen In ''The Salvation'' |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/04/eva-green-jeffrey-dean-morgan-more-join-mads-mikkelsen-in-the-salvation |access-date=24 July 2013 |journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=22 April 2013 |last=Tartaglione |first=Nancy |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=First Look At Mads Mikkelsen In Western 'The Salvation'; Eva Green, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Jonathan Pryce & More Join Cast |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2013/04/first-look-at-mads-mikkelsen-in-western-the-salvation-eva-green-jeffrey-dean-morgan-jonathan-pryce-more-join-cast-99106/ |access-date=24 July 2013 |journal=[[IndieWire]] |date=22 April 2013 |last=Jagernauth |first=Kevin |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Salvation'' has a rating of 72% rating based on 78 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.
