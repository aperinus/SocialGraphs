The film was produced by [[Robert L. Lippert]] and directed by [[Ubaldo Ragona]] and [[Sidney Salkow]], and stars [[Vincent Price]] and [[Franca Bettoia]]. The screenplay was written in part by Matheson, but he was dissatisfied with the result and chose to be credited as \"Logan Swanson\". William Leicester, Furio M. Monetti, and Ubaldo Ragona finished the script.\n\n''The Last Man on Earth'' was filmed in [[Rome]], with scenes being completed at [[EUR, Rome|Esposizione Universale Roma]].

They would kill Morgan if they could, but they are weak and unintelligent. Every day Morgan carries out the same routine: he wakes up, marks another day on the calendar, gathers his weapons, and then goes hunting for [[vampire]]s, killing as many as he can and then burning the bodies to prevent them from coming back. At night, he locks himself inside his house.\n\nA [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequence explains that, in December 1965, Morgan's wife Virginia and daughter Kathy had succumbed to the plague before it was widely known by the public that the dead would return to life. Instead of taking his wife to the same public burn pit used to dispose of his daughter's corpse, Morgan buried her without the knowledge of the authorities. When his wife returned to his home and attacked him, Morgan became aware of the need to kill the plague victims with a wooden stake. Morgan hypothesizes that he is [[Immunity (medical)|immune]] to the [[bacteria]] from a bite by an infected [[vampire bat]] when he was stationed in [[Panama]], which may have introduced a diluted form of the plague into his blood.\n\nOne day, a dog appears in the neighborhood. Desperate for companionship, Morgan chases after the dog but does not catch it. Sometime later the dog appears, wounded, at Morgan's doorstep. He takes the dog into his home and treats its wounds, looking forward to having company for the first time in three years. He quickly discovers, however, that it, too, has become infected with the plague. Morgan starts burying the dog which is now impaled with a wooden stake. He sinks further into depression and loneliness.\n\nAfter burying the dog, Morgan spots a woman in the distance. The woman, Ruth, is terrified of Morgan at first sight and runs from him. Morgan convinces her to return to his home, but he is suspicious of her true nature. Ruth becomes ill when Morgan waves garlic in her face, who claims that she has a weak stomach. Morgan's suspicion that Ruth is infected is confirmed when he discovers her attempting to inject herself with a combination of blood and [[vaccine]] that holds the disease at bay. Ruth initially draws a gun on Morgan but ultimately surrenders it to him. She tells him that she is part of a group of people like her{{snd}}infected, but under treatment{{snd}}and was sent to spy on Morgan. The vaccine allows the people to function normally with the drug in the bloodstream, but once it wears off, the infection takes over the body again. Ruth explains that her people are planning to rebuild society as they destroy the remaining humans, and that many of the vampires Morgan killed were still alive. Ruth desperately urges Morgan to flee, but he inexplicably refuses.\n\nWhile Ruth is asleep, Morgan transfuses his own blood into her. She is immediately cured, and Morgan sees hope that, together, they can cure the rest of her people. Moments later, however, Ruth's people attack. Morgan takes the gun and flees his home while the attackers kill the vampires gathered around Morgan's home. Ruth's people spot Morgan and chase him. He exchanges gunfire with them and picks up [[tear gas]] grenades from a police station armory along the way. While the tear gas delays his pursuers somewhat, Morgan is wounded by gunfire and retreats into a church. As he stands at the [[altar]], one of his pursuers finally impales him with a thrown spear. In his final moments, Morgan denounces his pursuers as \"freaks\" and, as Ruth cradles him, declares that he is the last true man on Earth. As Ruth walks away from Morgan's body, she notices a baby crying and tries to assure the child that everyone is safe now.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- cast and order per opening credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Dr. Robert Morgan\n* [[Franca Bettoia]] as Ruth Collins\n* [[Emma Danieli]] as Virginia Morgan\n* [[Giacomo Rossi Stuart|Giacomo Rossi-Stuart]] as Ben Cortman\n* [[Umberto Raho]] (billed as Umberto Rau) as Dr. Mercer\n* Christi Courtland as Kathy Morgan\n* Tony Corvi as the governor\n* Hector Ribotta as the TV reporter\n}}\n\nNote that [[Carolyn De Fonseca]], uncredited, dubbed for Franca Bettoia's voice in the [[English language|English]] release of the film.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nProducer [[Anthony Hinds]] purchased the rights to Matheson's novel for [[Hammer Film Productions]].

In the late 1950s, [[Charles Marquis Warren]] and Robert Stabler optioned a novel by science fiction writer [[George R. Stewart]] called ''[[Earth Abides]]''. [[Harry Spalding]], who worked for Lippert, said the release of ''[[The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1959 film)|The World, the Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1959) killed off plans for that project.
