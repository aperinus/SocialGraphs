Thanks!-->\nTen years ago, Skipper, Rico, and Kowalski are [[penguin]] chick brothers in [[Antarctica]]. Upon seeing a runaway egg roll away from their colony, the trio rescue the egg from [[leopard seal]]s and are set adrift on an [[iceberg]]. When the egg hatches, the trio adopt the baby penguin as their brother, Private.\n\nIn the present, the penguins leave [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted|Circus Zaragoza]] to celebrate Private's tenth birthday by breaking into [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]] to get a snack called Cheesy Dibbles from a vending machine, while Private desires to be recognized as an official member of the team, but is ignored. The penguins are subsequently kidnapped and taken to a [[submarine]], where they are confronted by an [[octopus]] named Dave, who explains that he once lived in the [[Central Park Zoo]] as a star attraction until the penguins upstaged him with their cuteness. After being repeatedly upstaged by more penguins and passed between zoos and aquariums as an unwanted animal, a bitter Dave disguised himself as a human scientist Dr. Octavius Brine to enact his revenge. Rico swallows a vial of Dave\u2019s bioweapon - the Medusa Serum - and his [[snow globe]] collection before the penguins escape.\n\nFleeing through [[Venice]], Italy, while being pursued by Dave's henchmen, the penguins are rescued by the North Wind, an inter-species intelligence agency consisting of Classified, the [[wolf]] leader; [[polar bear]] weapons specialist Corporal; [[harp seal]] demolitionist Short Fuse; and [[snowy owl]] intelligence officer Eva. After Rico shows the North Wind the serum, Dave hacks into the North Wind\u2019s computers to reveal he has more of it and more penguins start vanishing from exhibits all over the world. Upon deeming the penguins a liability to the mission, Classified darts and puts them on a plane bound for [[Madagascar]].\n\nThe penguins escape the plane and, using Dave's snowglobes, deduce that the [[Shanghai, China|Shanghai]] Zoo is Dave's next target. Skipper's team forms a plan to stop Dave and Private reluctantly agrees to be the bait. The other penguins manage to trap Dave with a dinosaur skeleton after creating a water leak in the aquarium, just as the North Wind shows up. However, Dave escapes through a drain and captures Private and the rest of the Shanghai penguins, prompting Skipper, Rico, and Kowalski to hijack the North Wind's jet to pursue him, but it is blown up after the North Wind attempts to interfere. At Dave\u2019s lair, Private learns that Dave is planning to use the Medusa Serum to turn penguins into mindless and disfigured monsters, so that the public will hate and exterminate them.\n\nUpon reaching Dave\u2019s hideout, the penguins and the North Wind clash over their different plans to infiltrate the submarine, before Skipper finally admits the North Wind to be more qualified and relents. The penguins distract the octopus guards while the North Wind sneak inside, but both teams are captured. Dave tests the Medusa Serum on Private, but he escapes with a paper clip he swallowed earlier at the last second, causing Dave and the rest of the penguins to believe he has been vaporized. Private frees the North Wind from torture devices and tries to convince them to help save the penguins, but they refuse, causing him to storm off on his own.\n\nDave uses the Medusa Serum to transform all the penguins, and, as Dr. Brine, unleashes them on [[New York City]]. In the chaos, Private obtains Dave's ray, chases down Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico and restores them to sanity. As the penguins and the North Wind battle Dave and his henchmen, Private inserts himself into Dave\u2019s ray using the power of his cuteness in order to restore the other penguins to normal, though leaving himself mutated and Dave shrunk and trapped inside one of his snow globes, which a little girl plays with. For his heroism, Private finally earns his place as a qualified member of the team and Classified congratulates the penguins and apologizes for misjudging them. As a reward, Classified gives the penguins jetpacks, which they use to fly back to Circus Zaragoza.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the penguins use Mort\u2019s cuteness to restore Private to normal. Mort is apparently unaffected by the ray at first, before quickly swallowing King Julien whole, to the latter's amusement.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:John Malkovich & Benedict Cumberbatch, Penguins of Madagascar, SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Malkovich]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] talking at the ''Penguins of Madagascar'' panel at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper, the leader of the [[penguin]]s.<ref name=USATPeek>{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Sneak Peek: 'Penguins of Madagascar'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/08/penguins-of-madagascar-first-look/9727597/|access-date=June 9, 2014|work=USA Today|date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski, the brains of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private, the rookie of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Rico,<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: 'Penguins of Madagascar'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-penguins-of-madagascar-1201353894/|access-date=November 12, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> the loose cannon of the penguins.
