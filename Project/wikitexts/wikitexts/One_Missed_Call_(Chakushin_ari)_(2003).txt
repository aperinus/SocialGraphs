The film is based on the novel ''Chakushin Ari'' by [[Yasushi Akimoto]]. The plot revolves around Yumi Nakamura, a young psychology student whose friend Yoko gets a strange voice message on her cell phone. The message is dated two days in the future and Yoko can hear herself screaming in it. After Yoko mysteriously dies, her death sets off a chain of events which leads Yumi to discover that this phenomenon has been occurring throughout Japan long before Yoko received an alarming call from her future self. When Yumi receives a call with the date and time of her death, she struggles to save herself and learn the truth behind the calls.\n\nThe film received a critically panned [[One Missed Call (2008 film)|English-language adaptation in 2008]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile out at a pub with friends, Yoko Okazaki misses a call on her cellphone, but the caller ID says it's from herself. She and her friend Yumi Nakamura listen to Yoko's voice message, dated two days into the future, where she says it's starting to rain, followed by a horrendous scream. Two days later, Yumi receives a call from Yoko and realizes that Yoko is on the same routine as the voicemail. Yoko screams as she is violently thrown off an overpass onto a speeding train; her severed hand is seen dialing a number. Although authorities assume suicide, her schoolmates recall similar deaths that were preceded by voicemails. Yoko's boyfriend Kenji Kawai tells Yumi he got a voicemail from himself dated two days after. Kenji dies and a red [[Gobstopper|jawbreaker candy]] falls out of his mouth as his phone dials another number by itself.\n\nYumi meets Hiroshi Yamashita, a detective who has been investigating the curse that also claimed his sister Ritsuko. Yamashita shares that the next victim is called one minute after the previous death, and that the victims have red jawbreakers in their mouths. Their investigation leads them to a hospital which has since changed its building and number. Yumi recognizes a sound she heard before Kenji's death: a spritz from an [[asthma inhaler]]. They trace the autopsy records to a girl named Mimiko Mizunuma who had died from an asthma attack, with her mother Marie going missing. Ritsuko's journal shows that whenever Mimiko had an attack, her sister Nanako would suffer some injury at the same time. They suspect [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]], where a parent purposely makes a child sick so she can take care of her and be praised for it. Yumi's friend Natsumi also becomes a victim and dies. Yumi gets the cursed voicemail and reveals to Yamashita that her mother abused her as a child.\n\nAt an orphanage, Yamashita meets Nanako, who is unable to talk, but has a teddy bear that plays the same song as the ringtone. At the abandoned hospital, Yumi is haunted by the spirit of Mimiko. Her cell messages her that she will die in one minute. Yamashita finds an arm clutching an active cellphone, and stops its call. After the minute elapses, Yamashita uncovers a crate holding Marie's body. It comes to life and Yumi sees her own abusive mother in Marie. She tearfully embraces her, apologizing for leaving, and Marie's body returns to a corpse.\n\nYumi goes home and Yamashita visits Nanako at the orphanage. The Mizunuma videotape that Yamashita found reveals that Marie did not abuse her children; instead, Mimiko abused her sister. The tape shows her cutting Nanako, then suffering an asthma attack. Marie found out the truth and rushed Nanako to the hospital, leaving Mimiko to die. Nanako tells Yamashita that she would get a candy from Mimiko if she stayed silent. Yumi is haunted by Mimiko in her home, playing out the same events her voicemail showed. When Yamashita arrives, he finds Yumi normal, but is stabbed by her when they embrace, and sees Yumi appearing as Mimiko in the mirror. After a dream where he helps the dying Mimiko with an inhaler, he wakes in a hospital where a possessed Yumi feeds him a candy with her mouth and smiles, revealing that Mimiko has found \"a new Nanako\" in Yamashita to care for.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Character||Japanese actor||English voice actor\n|-\n|Yumi Nakamura\n|[[Ko Shibasaki]]\n|[[Kate Higgins|Kate Davis]]\n|-\n|Hiroshi Yamashita\n|[[Shinichi Tsutsumi]]\n|[[Liam O'Brien]]\n|-\n|Natsumi Konishi\n|[[Kazue Fukiishi]]\n|[[Jennifer Sekiguchi]]\n|-\n|Ichiro Fujieda\n|[[Yutaka Matsushige]]\n|[[Kim Strauss]]\n|-\n|Oka\n|Goro Kishitani\n|[[Joe Cappelletti|Joey Capps]]\n|-\n|Detective Yusaku Motomiya\n|[[Renji Ishibashi]]\n|[[Michael McConnohie]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Release==\n''One Missed Call'' premiered at the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]] on November 3, 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |title=\u4e09\u6c60\u76e3\u7763\u3001\u6700\u521d\u3067\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u30db\u30e9\u30fc\u6620\u753b!?\u300c\u7740\u4fe1\u30a2\u30ea\u300d\u8a18\u8005\u4f1a\u898b : \u6620\u753b\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9 |url=https://eiga.com/news/20031104/13/ |access-date=2022-04-15 |website=\u6620\u753b.com |language=ja}}</ref> Its English title was listed as '''''You've Got a Call''''' at the festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.tiff-jp.net/ja/archives?no=16|title = Tiff History \u6771\u4eac\u56fd\u969b\u6620\u753b\u796d\u306e\u8f1d\u304b\u3057\u304d\u8ecc\u8de1\u3092\u305f\u3069\u308b}}</ref> It was later released theatrically in Japan on January 17, 2004, where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=430}} In the Philippines, it was released by Buena Vista International on December 8, 2004.<ref>{{cite news|title=Opens Today!|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zqZjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aSUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1847%2C4534287|access-date=15 September 2022|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|publisher=The Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc.|date=8 December 2004|page=A31|quote=Death Cannot Be Put On Hold......}}</ref> It was released by [[Media Blasters]] in the United States with English subtitles on April 22, 2005.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=430}}\n\nIn February 2020, [[Arrow Films]] released ''One Missed Call'' on [[Blu-ray]] in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/home-video/3595960/arrow-video-announces-first-ever-blu-ray-release-one-missed-call-trilogy/|last=Squires|first=John|title=Arrow Video Announces First Ever Blu-ray Release of the 'One Missed Call' Trilogy|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2019-11-29|accessdate=2021-07-10}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a score of 44%, with an average rating of 5.23 out of 10, based on 27 reviews from critics.
