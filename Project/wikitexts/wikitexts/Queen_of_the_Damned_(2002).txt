A [[stand-alone sequel]] to ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994), the film stars [[Stuart Townsend]], [[Aaliyah]] in her final film role, [[Marguerite Moreau]], [[Vincent P\u00e9rez]] and [[Lena Olin]]. Townsend  and [[Matthew Newton]] replaced [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Antonio Banderas]] in the roles [[Lestat de Lioncourt|Lestat]] and [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]] respectively.\n\nThe film is dedicated to Aaliyah, who [[Death of Aaliyah|died in a plane crash]] on August 25, 2001, after she had shot all her scenes. Released on February 22, 2002, in North America and on April 4, 2002, in Australia, it received generally negative reviews from critics and did not perform well at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nThe vampire [[Lestat de Lioncourt|Lestat]] is awakened from decades of slumber by the sound of a [[hard rock]] band, and proceeds to take over as their lead singer. Achieving international success, Lestat, having revealed the existence of vampires, taunts the others of his kind during an interview for promoting his first and only live concert.\n\n[[Jesse Reeves]], a researcher for the paranormal studies group [[Talamasca]], is intrigued by Lestat's lyrics after hearing one of his songs play on TV and tells the rest of the group her theory that he really is a vampire. Her mentor, [[David Talbot (The Vampire Chronicles)|David Talbot]], takes her aside and tells her they know what he is and that a vampire called Marius made him. David also shows her Lestat's journal that he recovered and gives it to Jesse for her to read on the condition that she promises not to pursue Lestat. In the journal, Lestat recalls how he was turned into a vampire by Marius and how he awoke [[Akasha (The Vampire Chronicles)|Akasha]], the first vampire, with his music. Unsatisfied with what she read, Jesse tracks Lestat down to a London vampire club called The Admiral's Arms, where he saves her from three vampires and confronts her about Marius.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Lestat is visited by Marius, who warns him that the other vampires will not tolerate his flamboyant public profile. Marius also reveals that Lestat's new music has awakened Akasha and begs him to cancel his concert, which he refuses. Meanwhile, Akasha, who is searching for Lestat, arrives at The Admiral's Arms. After the vampires reveal their plan to kill Lestat at his concert, Akasha torches the club and kills all the vampires inside. Jesse arrives at Los Angeles and gives Lestat his journal back. She then asks him to show her what being a vampire is like. Lestat scoffs at the idea, but Jesse convinces him to spend his last moments before the concert with her. The two spend some time together and Jesse later asks Lestat to turn her, telling him she wants to be with him and that she wants to know everything he does. Lestat angrily refuses, and shows her what it's like for a vampire to feed aggressively on a human. He comes back to her asking her if this is truly what she wants, she recoils in fear from him, he scoffs at her agreeing and then leaves.\n\nWhile performing at his concert in [[Death Valley]], a group of vampires attack Lestat. With Marius' help, they both fend off most of the vampires until Akasha bursts through the stage and takes Lestat with her. Akasha brings Lestat to her new home, where the two vampires have [[sexual intercourse]], during which time Lestat becomes spellbound by Akasha and is forced to obey her, and Akasha proclaims Lestat her new king. After the concert, Jesse is taken to the home of her aunt, [[Maharet]], who later reveals herself to be one of the Ancient Vampires. Knowing Akasha's plan to take over the world, the Ancient Vampires discuss their plans to destroy the Queen by drinking from her and draining her of her blood. However, they believe that whoever drinks the Queen's last drop will not survive.\n\nEmpowered by Akasha's blood, Lestat and the Queen confront the Ancient Vampires. When they refuse to join her, Akasha then commands Lestat to kill Jesse, as The Queen sees her both as an enemy, due to being Maharet's descendant, and as food, with Akasha making an example out of her for those who dare disobey her command. Lestat ostensibly obeys, but after drinking Jesse's blood, comes to his senses and is released from Akasha's power. He angrily requests for his \"crown\" and Akasha openly gives him her arm to feed on. Lestat then turns on her and begins to drain Akasha's blood. With the help of the Ancients, Akasha's power diminishes. Maharet is the last to drink Akasha's blood, killing Akasha. Lestat goes to Jesse and, cradling her in his arms, gives her his blood as Maharet turns into a marble statue and \"sleeps\", becoming the new Queen of the Damned.\n\nLestat and Jesse, who is now a vampire, visit David and return Lestat's journal. When asked by David what it is like, Jesse offers to turn him into a vampire to which he replies he's too old for immortality. Jesse then bids David goodbye and goes to embrace him. David shows fear and rejects the embrace, sensing his hesitation Jesse looks hurt but nods in understanding. She leaves with Lestat. \nA few moments later, David is greeted by Marius.\n\nThe film closes with Lestat and Jesse walking hand in hand, among mortals, into the night.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aaliyah]] as [[Akasha (The Vampire Chronicles)|Akasha]]\n* [[Stuart Townsend]] as [[Lestat de Lioncourt|Lestat]]\n** Matthew Lassall as Lestat's Violinist Double\n* [[Marguerite Moreau]] as [[Jesse Reeves|Jesse]]\n** Rachael Tanner as Young Jesse\n* [[Paul McGann]] as [[David Talbot (The Vampire Chronicles)|David Talbot]]\n* [[Lena Olin]] as [[Maharet]]\n* [[Christian Manon]] as [[Mael (The Vampire Chronicles)|Mael]]\n* [[Claudia Black]] as [[Pandora (The Vampire Chronicles)|Pandora]]\n* [[Vincent Perez]] as [[List_of_The_Vampire_Chronicles_characters#Marius_de_Romanus|Marius]]\n* [[Bruce Spence]] as [[Khayman]]\n* [[Matthew Newton]] as [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]]\n* [[Pia Miranda]] as Jesse's Roommate\n\n[[Jonathan Davis]] played a Scalper and also provided the uncredited singing voice for Lestat.

It was also decided to focus on Lestat as the primary character, and the back story of Akasha and the [[Maharet and Mekare|Story of the Twins]] were omitted, despite these being virtually central to the plot of the novel.<ref>Debra Campbell: [http://queenofthedamned.warnerbros.com/cmp/faq.html A chat with the producer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112035709/http://queenofthedamned.warnerbros.com/cmp/faq.html |date=November 12, 2006 }}, queenofthedamned.co.uk</ref>\n\nDispleased with the lack of progress, and more particularly with the studio's lack of consultation with her over the script development, author Anne Rice wrote a critical reply to a fan's question about the film in 1998:<ref>[https://www.sffchronicles.com/threads/13748/ Coming Attractions: Queen of the Damned], Corona Productions.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|The key factor is that the entire vampire contract terminates in the year 2000.

They simply weren't interested. It was very painful for me, as I had been talking to a new director they'd hired and we were both excited about the idea.\n\nI felt snubbed and hurt and have not bothered to approach them since. The young director is supposed to be developing THE QUEEN OF THE DAMNED which I think is a bad idea, and basically a doomed project.\n\nIn spite of their showing no interest in me as the screen writer, they have not been able to find one themselves for this bizarre idea of THE QUEEN OF THE DAMNED. I'm not too surprised. I think any respectable script writer would be crazy to tackle that novel without having fully developed the background story of Lestat. Anyway, that is where it is.}}\n\nDuring 1999, the script was developed by TV screenwriter [[Scott Abbott (screenwriter)|Scott Abbott]] and Australian writer/director [[Michael Petroni]].
