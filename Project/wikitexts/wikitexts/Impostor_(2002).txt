Dick]]. The film starred [[Gary Sinise]], [[Madeleine Stowe]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], and [[Mekhi Phifer]] and was directed by [[Gary Fleder]].<ref name=\"Impostor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/431383/Impostor/full-credits.html|title=Impostor|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|access-date=October 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in 2079. Forty-five years earlier, Earth was attacked by a hostile and implacable alien civilization from [[Alpha Centauri]]. Force field domes are put in place to protect cities, and a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[World government|global]] [[Military dictatorship|military government]] is established to effect the war and the survival of humans. The Centaurians have never been physically seen.\n\nThe film follows Spencer Olham ([[Gary Sinise]]), a designer of top-secret government weapons. One day while on his way to work, he is arrested by Major Hathaway ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]) of the Earth Security Administration (ESA), being identified as a [[Replicant#Replicants in popular culture|replicant]] created by the aliens. The ESA intercepted an alien transmission which cryptanalysts decoded as programming Olham's target to be the Chancellor, whom he was scheduled to meet. Such replicants are perfect biological copies of existing humans, complete with transplanted memories, and do not know they are replicants. Each has a powerful \"U-bomb\" in their chest in the exact design of a human heart, which can only be detected by dissection or a high-tech medical scan, since it only arms itself and detonates when it gets in close proximity to its target. Detection via the special scan works by comparing against a previous scan, if there was one.\n\nMajor Hathaway begins interrogating Olham. As Hathaway is about to drill out Olham's chest to find the bomb, Olham breaks loose and escapes, accidentally killing his friend Nelson ([[Tony Shalhoub]]) in the process. With the help of underground stalker Cale ([[Mekhi Phifer]]), Olham avoids capture and sneaks into the hospital where his wife Maya ([[Madeleine Stowe]]) is an administrator to get the high-tech scan redone and prove he's not a replicant. But the scan is interrupted by security forces before it can deliver the answer.\n\nThat evening, after fleeing from the city, Olham and Maya are eventually captured by Hathaway's troops in a forest near an alien crash site, close to the spot where they spent a romantic weekend just a week or so before Olham's arrest. Inside the ship they discover the corpse of the real Maya, and Hathaway shoots and kills the replicant before she can detonate. Hathaway thinks he has killed the true impostor, but as his men move debris away from the Centauri ship, the real Spencer Olham's body is revealed. At that moment, Olham realizes aloud that both Maya and himself really are alien replicants, and the secondary trigger (his awareness of what he truly is) detonates his U-bomb, destroying himself, Hathaway, his troops, and everything else in a wide area in a fiery nuclear explosion.\n\nIn the final scene, the news announces that Hathaway and the Olhams were killed in an alien enemy attack, implying that the government covered up or are unaware of the truth. Cale wonders if he ever really knew Olham's true identity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Spencer Olham\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Maya Olham\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Major D.H.

The other shorts were to be adaptations of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s story \"[[The Last Question]]\" by [[Bryan Singer]] and [[Donald A. Wollheim]]'s story \"Mimic\" by [[Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)|Matthew Robbins]]. \"Mimic\" had already been adapted into a [[Mimic (film)|film of the same name]], but with a different script.\n\nThe short was originally written by [[Scott Rosenberg]], with revisions by [[Mark Protosevich]] and Caroline Case. When it was decided to expand the short into a feature-length film, additional scenes were written by Richard Jeffries, [[Ehren Kruger]], and [[David Twohy]].\n\nBurn areas in [[Running Springs, California]], were used to create the spacecraft crash site. Sets were constructed in [[Angeles National Forest]] and in numerous areas around [[Los Angeles]]. Most of the interiors were built on stage in Manhattan Beach, including a two-story hospital and 3-story pharmacy, and a commuter transport station with articulated commuter \"bugs\". Other filming locations included the [[Coachella Valley]].<ref name=Filming>{{cite web |title=Coachella Valley Feature Film Production 1920\u20132011 |url=http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939 |work=Filming in Palm Springs |access-date=October 1, 2012 |author=Palm Springs Visitors Center |location=Palm Springs, CA |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001025937/http://visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939 |archive-date=October 1, 2012 }} [http://visitpalmsprings.com/stream/126941?mode=Download Download]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ([[Portable Document Format|Downloadable PDF file]])</ref>\n\nThe movie was made on an estimated $40 million budget.<ref name=\"the-numbers\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n{{Anchor|Critics}}\n''Impostor'' received negative reviews from critics.
