Produced by [[Outerbanks Entertainment]] and distributed by [[Dimension Films]], it is the fourth installment in the [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' film series]]. The film stars [[Neve Campbell]], [[David Arquette]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Emma Roberts]], [[Hayden Panettiere]], [[Anthony Anderson]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Adam Brody]], [[Rory Culkin]], [[Marielle Jaffe]], [[Erik Knudsen]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Marley Shelton]], [[Nico Tortorella]], and [[Roger L. Jackson]]. The film takes place on the fifteenth anniversary of the original [[Scream (1996 film)|Woodsboro murders]] and involves [[Sidney Prescott]] returning to the town after ten years, where [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]] once again begins killing students from Woodsboro High. Like its predecessors, ''Scream 4'' combines the violence of the slasher genre with elements of [[black comedy]] and \"[[whodunit]]\" mystery to satirize the [[clich\u00e9s]] of film [[remakes]]. The film also provides commentary on the extensive usage of [[social media]] and the obsession with [[Internet celebrity|internet fame]].\n\nThe series was originally intended to be a [[trilogy]], concluding with ''[[Scream 3]]'' in 2000. However, in June 2008, [[The Weinstein Company]] announced a third sequel was in development, with Craven confirmed to direct in March 2010. In September 2009, Arquette, Campbell, and Cox were announced to be returning, after which the casting process lasted between April and September 2010. [[Principal photography]] began in June 2010 and ended in September that same year, taking place in and around [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Scenes set in and around Woodsboro High School were actually filmed at Woodworth Middle School in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. During production, [[Ehren Kruger]], who previously wrote the screenplay for ''Scream 3'', was hired for script rewrites. Reshoots were filmed in early 2011, following test screenings.\n\n''Scream 4'' premiered at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] in Los Angeles on April 11, 2011, and was released in the United States on April 15, 2011, by [[Dimension Films]]. The film received praise for the performances, direction and humor, while it was criticized for its lack of scares and reliance on clich\u00e9d formulas. However, many considered it to be an improvement over its predecessor, and it has enjoyed several positive reappraisals since, particularly for its prescient examination of the impact of social media.<ref>{{Cite web |title=I've Been Wrong About Scream 4 for 10 Years |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/ive-been-wrong-about-scream-4-for-10-years-1846635465 |access-date=May 8, 2021 |website=io9 |language=en-us |archive-date=April 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210430175342/https://io9.gizmodo.com/ive-been-wrong-about-scream-4-for-10-years-1846635465 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=February 4, 2020 |title=Scream 3 Is the Best Worst Sequel of Any Horror Franchise |url=https://consequence.net/2020/02/scream-3-best-worst-sequel/ |access-date=May 8, 2021 |website=Consequence |language=en-US |archive-date=May 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508065313/https://consequence.net/2020/02/scream-3-best-worst-sequel/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3660168/bet-didnt-see-coming-scream-4-may-best-film-franchise/ |title=Bet You Didn\u2019t See That Coming: Why 'Scream 4' May Be the Best Film in the Franchise - Bloody Disgusting |access-date=April 15, 2021 |archive-date=April 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210415040001/https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3660168/bet-didnt-see-coming-scream-4-may-best-film-franchise/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It grossed $97{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a budget of $40{{nbsp}}million, becoming the lowest-grossing film in the ''Scream'' franchise.\n\n''Scream 4'' was the final film to be directed by Craven before his death in 2015. It was followed by ''[[Scream (TV series)|Scream]]'', an [[anthology series|anthology]] television series, which was developed for [[MTV]] without the involvement of the main cast or crew of the films, although Roger L.

[[Sidney Prescott]], now age 32, returns to Woodsboro the next day to promote her book with her publicist, [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Rebecca Walters|Rebecca Walters]]. After evidence is found in her rental car, Sidney becomes a suspect in the murders and must stay in town until they are solved.\n\nSidney's cousin, [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Jill Roberts|Jill Roberts]], who is coping with the infidelity of her ex-boyfriend, [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Trevor Sheldon|Trevor Sheldon]], gets a threatening phone call from Ghostface, as does her friend  [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Olivia Morris|Olivia Morris]]. Jill and Olivia, alongside their friend [[Kirby Reed]], are questioned about their calls by [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]], now the town's sheriff, while his deputies{{Snd}}[[List of Scream (film series) characters#Deputy Judy Hicks|Judy Hicks]], [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Deputy Anthony Perkins|Anthony Perkins]] and [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Deputy Hoss|Hoss]] assist him in the case. [[Gale Weathers]], Dewey's wife, is struggling with [[writer's block]] and decides to investigate the murders against her husband's wishes. Sidney stays over with Jill and her mother, Sidney's aunt [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Kate Roberts|Kate]]. That night, Olivia is killed by Ghostface as Jill and Kirby watch in horror from across the street. Sidney herself is then confronted by Ghostface, and they fight until Ghostface is forced to flee when Perkins and Hoss arrive. \n\nAt the hospital, Sidney fires Rebecca after learning of her desire to exploit the murders to increase book sales, and Rebecca is subsequently murdered by Ghostface at a parking garage. Gale enlists the help of two high school movie fanatics, [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Charlie Walker|Charlie Walker]] and [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Robbie Mercer|Robbie Mercer]]. Charlie theorizes that the killer is following the rules of horror remakes, and Gale and Sidney conclude that the killer will likely strike at the \"Stabathon\", a screening party held in a barn where teenagers gather to watch all movies in the ''Stab'' franchise. Gale sneaks into the party to investigate, but Ghostface attacks her, stabbing her in the shoulder. Hoss and Perkins, who were assigned to guard Jill's house, are also murdered. Sidney discovers from another taunting call from Ghostface that Jill has left for Kirby's, before Ghostface attacks them and kills Kate. \n\nJill, Kirby, Charlie, Robbie, and Trevor are at an after party at Kirby's house when Ghostface strikes, killing a drunken Robbie. Sidney arrives to leave with Jill, but they are both chased by Ghostface. As Sidney calls Dewey and tries to find Jill, Kirby frees Charlie, who was bound and gagged, but he immediately stabs her, revealing himself as Ghostface, before leaving her to bleed out.{{efn|[[Scream (2022 film)|The sequel]] reveals that Kirby survived the attack.}} Sidney is confronted by Charlie and stabbed by a second Ghostface, who reveals herself as Jill. She admits to masterminding the murders out of jealousy from the fame that Sidney received for surviving the original murders, and desires to achieve fame as a \"survivor\" of the murders and framing Trevor as Ghostface. Jill kills Trevor and betrays Charlie, stabbing him to death to pin him as Trevor's accomplice so she can be the sole survivor. She then stabs Sidney and mutilates herself to frame Trevor further.\n\nDewey and the police arrive as Sidney and Jill are taken to the hospital. After discovering that Sidney has survived, an enraged Jill goes to her hospital room and makes a final attempt to kill her. Dewey, Gale, and Judy intervene, having been clued in by the fact that Jill somehow knew exactly where Gale was stabbed. Jill subdues Dewey and Hicks and holds Gale at gunpoint, but Sidney incapacitates her with a [[defibrillator]] while denouncing her motive, and ultimately kills Jill by shooting her in the heart. Dewey calls in all police units, as reporters outside erroneously name Jill as the \"sole surviving hero\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Further|topic=individual characters|List of Scream (film series) characters}}\n{{Further|topic=cast members|List of Scream (film series) cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Neve Campbell]] as [[Sidney Prescott]], a self-help author and main target of Ghostface\n* [[David Arquette]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]], the town sheriff and Gale's husband\n* [[Courteney Cox]] as [[Gale Weathers]], a former reporter and Dewey's wife\n* [[Emma Roberts]] as Jill Roberts, Sidney's teenage cousin\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as [[Kirby Reed]], Jill's best friend\n* [[Marley Shelton]] as Judy Hicks, the town's deputy sheriff and Sidney's former classmate\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Anthony Perkins, a deputy\n* [[Adam Brody]] as Ross Hoss, a deputy\n* [[Rory Culkin]] as Charlie Walker, Robbie's best friend\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] as Kate Roberts, Jill's mother and Sidney's maternal aunt\n* [[Alison Brie]] as Rebecca Walters, Sidney's publicist\n* [[Marielle Jaffe]] as Olivia Morris, Jill and Kirby's friend\n* [[Nico Tortorella]] as Trevor Sheldon, Jill's ex-boyfriend\n* [[Erik Knudsen]] as Robbie Mercer, Charlie's best friend\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Rachel (character in the in-universe film ''Stab 7'')\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Chloe (character in the in-universe film ''Stab 7'')\n* [[Lucy Hale]] as Sherrie (character in the in-universe film ''Stab 6'')\n* [[Shenae Grimes]] as Trudie (character in the in-universe film ''Stab 6'')\n* [[Aimee Teegarden]] as Jenny Randall, a fan of the ''Stab'' movies and a girl Trevor had an affair with\n* [[Britt Robertson]] as Marnie Cooper, Jenny's friend who does not like the ''Stab'' movies\n* John Lepard as Mr. Baker, Jill's English teacher\n* Mark Aaron Buerkle as Dr. Orth, Sidney's radiologist\n* [[Roger L.

Wes Craven refers to a ten-year time jump when the film was originally assumed to occur in 2010.}} but that there had been numerous sequels to the [[Story within a story|film-within-a-film]] ''Stab''. He also commented on the status of Sidney Prescott, \"She's done her best to move on from the events that occurred in the previous films, even releasing a successful book\". Craven said that endless sequels, the modern spew of remakes, film studios, and directors are the butts of parodies in the film. The main characters have to figure out where the horror genre is in current days to figure out the modern events happening to and around them.<ref name=\"EW\" /> Williamson expressed his desire to tell a story in which the audience would really care about the characters, like with Sidney Prescott, who survived the first three films, and focus on them rather than the next kill, in comparison to other horror films like those of the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]].<ref name=\"WilliamsonShockTilYouDrop\" />\n\nIn an early draft of the script, Gale and Dewey had a baby, but this was changed after it was decided bringing a baby into the film would make shooting \"impossible\". In another early form of the script, the opening scene had Sidney start fighting with Ghostface and be left for dead. There would have been a two-year gap in the story while she recovered; however, Bob Weinstein feared it would slow the pace of the story and bringing in young characters would work out best.<ref name=\"EWScripChanges\" />\n\nThere were numerous other differences between the original script and the version that eventually reached the screen. For instance, the opening sequences were changed around, as can be seen in the alternative versions and deleted scenes on the DVD. Also, the Stabathon and the sequences involving Gale being attacked there did not appear in the original script. Another major difference was the ending. The hospital finale scenes were added on later in the writing process. The original script ended at the house, with Jill being loaded into the ambulance and speaking to Dewey, then agreeing to give the photographers one photo under the pretense that they would then leave her alone (though she really wanted them to take her photograph). Just then, a paramedic from inside the house shouts that they have a woman alive, not specified but assumed to be either Sidney or Kirby. The film would have ended on this cliffhanger, presumably setting Jill up as an antagonist/anti-heroine in the next film. There were rumors that Sidney would then possibly be suffering from amnesia in the next film, unable to recall that Jill was the killer. There were also rumors that Williamson was upset that this ending was changed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2011/04/17/scream-4-plot-twists/ |title=''Scream 4'': What plot twists didn't make it to the final film? -- EXCLUSIVE |website=EW.com |access-date=January 26, 2020 |archive-date=November 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101003934/https://ew.com/article/2011/04/17/scream-4-plot-twists/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/104784312/REAL-Scream-4-Screenplay |title=\"REAL\" Scream 4 Screenplay &#124; Leisure |website=Scribd |access-date=January 26, 2020 |archive-date=November 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101151201/https://www.scribd.com/document/104784312/REAL-Scream-4-Screenplay |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''[[Scream 3]]'' writer [[Ehren Kruger]] was brought in during production to do re-writes.

Craven instantly loved the building as well as the name and decided to use both in the film. He also hired the owner's chef to prepare the food and pastry for a scene in the film. The scenes were shot the first week of July.<ref name=\"freep2\" /> After the test screening in January, Craven and Weinstein did not think two scenes played well for the audience. Aimee Teegarden and Alison Brie returned to Detroit in late January and early February 2011 for four days of additional shooting. The scenes involved Teegarden's character, who is stalked at her home, and Brie's character, who is attacked in a parking garage.<ref name=\"EWPreviewpg35\" /><ref name=\"Northville\" /><ref name=\"EWnewscenes\" />\n\nThe film also extensively used [[computer-generated imagery]] for the first time in the franchise. For example, instead of using a \"collapsing knife\", the knife's blade was added during post-production with CGI effects.<ref name=\"ABCScreamPg3\" /> Anderson's death scene in which he is stabbed in the forehead and walks a few feet while talking before finally falling to his death, was not in the script but was inspired by a \"real-life medical emergency\" Craven had seen in a documentary about a person being stabbed through their head and walked into an emergency room. He thought it was \"extraordinary if somebody was stabbed in the head and still be alive for a while\".
