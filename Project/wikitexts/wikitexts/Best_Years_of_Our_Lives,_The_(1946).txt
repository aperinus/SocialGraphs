They travel together and arrive in their [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] hometown of Boone City.\n\nBefore the war, Fred had a menial job at a drug store as their [[soda jerk]] and lived with his parents in the poorer part of town. Before becoming an officer in the Army Air Corps, he married his girlfriend Marie after a brief engagement and shipped out shortly thereafter.\n\nAl worked as a high level officer at the local bank and lived in an upscale apartment with his wife Millie and their two children, Peggy and Rob.\n\nHomer was a high school student living with his middle-class parents and younger sister. A star athlete at school, Homer also had been dating his next-door neighbor, Wilma, and they commit to marrying upon his return.\n\nEach man faces challenges integrating back into civilian life. Having lost both hands, Homer is the man most obviously damaged by the war, but each man suffers from mental injuries, Homer included. Homer has become quite functional in the use of his [[prosthesis#Hooks|mechanical hooks]], but he cannot bring himself to believe that Wilma will still want to marry him. Al, tired and jaded from the war, is asked to return to the bank and gets a large promotion which he feels obligated to take. The highly decorated and accomplished Fred suffers from [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] by night, and despite his Captain\u2019s rank in the military, cannot find a civilian job because of his lack of experience at anything other than dropping bombs and is forced to return to the drug store to work behind the counter. The one bright spot for Fred is Al's daughter Peggy, whom he met when they first returned to town after a long night drinking binge. Peggy feels sympathy for Fred and gives him her room as he passes out that night.\n\nFred and Peggy are attracted to each other, and when she stops by his work to check on him he asks her to meet him for lunch. Afterwards, he walks her to her car, and though he knows it is wrong, kisses her. Fred's relationship with Peggy puts him at odds with Al, who, despite his affection for Fred, does not want his daughter to be involved with a married man. Peggy on the other hand, after meeting Marie by arranging a double date, is determined to \"break the marriage apart\" thinking that Fred deserves better than the tawdry Marie.\n\nHomer continues to avoid his fianc\u00e9, Wilma, and much to the family's anguish doesn't seem to want to continue the relationship. Each night Homer's father helps him remove the prosthetic arms and places him in bed. Homer appears lost and despite being as independent as he can, he still requires others to help him with day-to-day activities. Wilma confronts Homer who explodes in a rage and breaks a window when he cannot manage to open the door, scaring his younger sister and her friends.\n\nAl continues to struggle with re-entry into normal life. Widely respected by the bank's senior management for his past business acumen, Al finds himself aligning himself with veterans looking for loans - sometimes with little or no collateral which becomes an issue for the bank.  His behavior is made worse by his [[Binge drinking|excessive drinking]] and he continues to seek solace away from his family obligations with the other veterans.\n\nAll three characters' individual stories come to a head. One night, when Homer visits the drugstore for an ice cream sundae, another customer strikes up a conversation with him. The topic turns sour when the customer alludes to the latest news that the country is now at odds with the Soviet Union and Chinese governments, saying, \"You lost your arms fighting the wrong enemy.\" Homer becomes angry; Fred comes to his aid and punches the disrespectful patron in the face. After being fired, Fred advises Homer to confess his true feelings to Wilma.\n\nAl, under the influence of drinking, begins to go off the rails at a company dinner and barely finishes his speech without embarrassment as Millie comes to the rescue.\n\nWilma catches Homer before his bedtime routine. Homer is determined to avoid the topic of their relationship, but Wilma announces that her parents want to send her to live with relatives with the primary purpose of leaving town and moving on from Homer. Homer initially agrees with the decision, but as Wilma presses him for his true feelings he agrees to show her his disabilities and what the future would entail. At a tender moment, Wilma buttons his shirt and kisses him goodnight, leaving a teary-eyed Homer in bed.\n\nMeanwhile, Fred's wife, Marie, frustrated with his lack of financial success and missing her past nightlife, tells Fred she is getting a divorce. Heartbroken and seeing no future in Boone City, Fred decides to pack up and catch the next plane out. After he bids farewell to his father and step-mother, his father reads a letter of commendation from [[Jimmy Doolittle|General Doolittle]] describing Fred's heroics. While waiting at the airport Fred walks into an [[aircraft boneyard]], where he climbs into one of the decommissioned [[B-17]] bombers. Sitting in the bombardier's seat, his mind returns to the war, and another bombing run over Germany. He is roused out of his stressful memories by a work crew foreman, who informs him that the planes are being demolished for use in the growing pre-fab housing industry. Fred asks him if they need any help in the budding business, and is hired.\n\nThe finale shows everyone at Homer and Wilma's home wedding. Fred and Peggy have a polite reunion but as the vows are spoken between the newlyweds, they cannot help but look at each other. Peggy begins to weep and after the ceremony, Fred walks to her and they embrace while no one is looking. He expresses his love with the caveat that things may be a little rough financially but he is committed to the new job. Peggy is completely enthralled and smiles.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Entire credited cast, per closing credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as Milly Stephenson\n* [[Fredric March]] as Technical Sergeant Al Stephenson\n* [[Dana Andrews]] as Captain Fred Derry\n* [[Teresa Wright]] as Peggy Stephenson\n* [[Virginia Mayo]] as Marie Derry\n* [[Cathy O'Donnell]] as Wilma Cameron\n* [[Hoagy Carmichael]] as Butch Engle, Homer's uncle\n* [[Harold Russell]] as Petty Officer 2nd Class Homer Parrish\n* [[Gladys George]] as Hortense Derry\n* [[Roman Bohnen]] as Pat Derry\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Mr. Milton\n* [[Minna Gombell]] as Mrs. Parrish\n* [[Walter Baldwin]] as Mr. Parrish\n* [[Steve Cochran]] as Cliff\n* [[Dorothy Adams]] as Mrs. Cameron\n* [[Don Beddoe]] as Mr. Cameron\n* Marlene Aames as Luella Parrish\n* [[Charles Halton]] as Prew\n* [[Ray Teal]] as Mr. Mollett\n* [[Howland Chamberlain]] as Thorpe\n* Dean White as Novak\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Bullard\n* [[Michael Hall (actor)|Michael Hall]] as Rob Stephenson\n* Victor Cutler as Woody Merrill\n}}\n\nCasting brought together established stars as well as character actors and relative unknowns.
