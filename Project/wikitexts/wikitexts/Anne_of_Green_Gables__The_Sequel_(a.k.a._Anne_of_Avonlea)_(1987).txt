Her best friend Diana Barry has become engaged. Marilla's eyesight has also improved, opening an opportunity for Anne to follow her ambitions, which have been on hold since giving up the Avery Scholarship.<ref name=\"Making\"/>\n\nAnne's misadventures in Avonlea continue. Unbeknownst to her, Diana submitted \"Averil's Atonement\" into a contest to introduce the new Rollings Reliable baking powder to the public, and it wins first prize. Anne is grateful to her friend for trying to boost her spirits, but finds the widespread recognition humiliating. She later sees her jersey cow Dolly in Rachel Lynde's field, which she had promised would never happen again. After unsuccessfully trying to get Dolly back to her field, Anne sells the cow to [[Gilbert Blythe]] and his father. She laments about her \"[[Jonah]] day\" to Marilla, who offers encouragement and plum puffs, only to discover she actually sold Rachel's cow instead of her own. When she and Marilla pay a visit to the Lyndes to explain her mistake, Rachel's ailing husband Thomas passes away, which Rachel fears will force her to sell her farm and leave Avonlea.<ref name=\"Making\"/>\n\nAt a [[clambake]] for Diana's engagement, Gilbert proposes to Anne, but she rejects his offer, convinced that their marriage would be unhappy and unsuccessful. She later runs into Morgan Harris, a traveling businessman whom she had previously met at the beach and who shows interest in her. At Diana's wedding, she sees Gilbert with a young woman named Christine Stuart. Gilbert insists they are just friends, and offers to wait for Anne, but she affirms she will never marry. Back at Green Gables, Marilla reveals that Rachel will be moving in with her. Anne decides to accept a job offer from her former teacher Miss Stacey as an English literature teacher at Kingsport Ladies' College in [[New Brunswick]].<ref name=\"Making\"/>\n\nAnne initially finds her job difficult. Kingsport is dominated by the wealthy and conceited Pringle family, who resent that she received the position over one of their own. The students in her class, led by Jen Pringle, delight in causing trouble to make Anne look like a bad teacher. Anne must also endure the cold and sarcastic principal of Kingsport Ladies' College, Katherine Brooke. She grows close to Emmeline Harris, a motherless student who also happens to be Morgan's daughter. After Anne and Emmeline get on Katherine Brooke's bad side, Morgan withdraws both his daughter and his financial support from K.L.C. He sends Emmeline to live with her stern grandmother Margaret Harris and repressed aunt Pauline at their mansion, Maplehurst. Anne convinces Mrs. Harris to let her tutor Emmeline at home, and let Pauline attend a friend's wedding anniversary overnight. Meanwhile, Anne and Miss Stacey organize a play to raise money for the school, with Jen Pringle playing the lead role of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. When Jen calls off sick on the day of the show, Anne convinces Morgan to let Emmeline star in the play, which they have been rehearsing during tutoring sessions. The show is a success and Anne finally wins the Pringles' support. After returning from a trip to [[Boston]], she runs into Gilbert and finds out that he is engaged to Christine Stuart. Inspired by his suggestion, she publishes a series of short stories entitled ''Avonlea Vignettes''. During a hospital benefit ball, Morgan asks her to marry him, which she declines.<ref name=\"Making\"/>\n\nAfter Mrs. Harris dies, Pauline accepts a marriage proposal and Morgan decides to sell Maplehurst and return to Boston with Emmeline. Anne resigns from K.L.C. and persuades Katherine to come back to Avonlea with her for the summer holidays. Upon arriving at Green Gables and meeting Diana's new baby, Anne discovers that Gilbert has fallen ill with [[scarlet fever]], which he contracted at medical school in Halifax. Finally realizing her true feelings for Gilbert, Anne rushes to his bedside, where he tells her that he has called off his engagement to Christine because Anne is the only one for him. After recovering, he proposes once more, and Anne accepts him with a kiss.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pacheco |first1=Adriana |title=Our Favourite Anne and Gilbert Moments - A Timeline of Their Relationship |url=https://www.anneofgreengables.com/blog-posts/our-favourite-anne-and-gilbert-moments-a-timeline-of-their-relationship |website=Anne of Green Gables |publisher=GazeboTV |access-date=3 November 2020 |ref=6}}</ref><ref name=\"Making\"/>\n\n==Timeline of events (1902\u20131903)==\n*Late spring 1902 \u2013 Anne, now 18, finishes teaching at Avonlea school.\n*Summer 1902 \u2013 Diana marries Fred, Anne takes  a teaching position at Kingsport Ladies College.\n*September 1902 \u2013 Anne begins teaching at Kingsport Ladies College.\n*November 26, 1902 \u2013 Production date of Anne's play at Kingsport Ladies College.\n*Summer 1903 \u2013 Katherine Brooke spends summer break with Anne at Green Gables.

It was inspired by a series of short stories and two novels by [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]].  Many of the actors in the ''Anne of Green Gables'' movies also appear in storylines crossing over into the long-running [[Emmy award]]-winning series, including [[Patricia Hamilton]] as Rachel Lynde, [[Colleen Dewhurst]] as Marilla Cuthbert until her death in 1991, and [[Marilyn Lightstone]] as Muriel Stacy. [[Jonathan Crombie]] returned as Gilbert Blythe in a one-time guest appearance in the finale episode of season three, which dealt with Marilla's death. Other actors from the first two ''Anne'' films portrayed different characters in ''Road to Avonlea'', including [[Rosemary Dunsmore]], who played Katherine Brooke in this film but returned as \"Abigail MacEwan\" in the television series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Dunsmore%2C%20Rosemary | title=Dunsmore, Rosemary | publisher=Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia | date=March 30, 2009 | accessdate=October 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/rosemary-dunsmore|title=The Canadian Encyclopedia|chapter=Rosemary Dunsmore|date=July 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story]]'' was released in 2000. Many cast members from the first two movies returned, including Megan Follows, Jonathan Crombie, and Schuyler Grant. Taking place in the midst of [[World War I]], the movie follows Anne (now in her 20s) as she embarks on a new journey, taking her from her home in Prince Edward Island to New York City, London, and into war-ravaged Europe.  This film is an original story not based on any of Montgomery's novels, nor does it align with the chronology of the books. Montgomery's ''[[Rilla of Ingleside]]'', which also takes place during the first World War, focuses on Anne's teenage daughter and depicts Anne and Gilbert as a middle-aged couple who witness the effects of the war from the home front while their adult sons fight in Europe.\n\n''[[Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning]]'' was released in fall 2008 (the 100th anniversary of the original novel), serving as a prequel to the previous films, and is not based on the books. Set near the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, the story follows a middle-aged Anne ([[Barbara Hershey]]) looking back on her life before arriving at Green Gables. [[Hannah Endicott-Douglas]] played the role of young Anne.\n\n==Production==\nWhen [[Kevin Sullivan (producer)|Kevin Sullivan]] was commissioned by [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] to create a sequel he started by combining many different elements of Montgomery's three later books: ''Anne of Avonlea'' (1909), ''Anne of the Island'' (1915), and ''Anne of Windy Poplars'' (1936) into a cohesive screen story. Sullivan invented his own plotline relying on several of Montgomery's episodic storylines spread across the three sequels, He also looked at numerous other nineteenth century female authors for inspiration in fleshing out the screen story.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe film succeeded in re-popularizing [[Megan Follows]] and [[Colleen Dewhurst]] in their original roles. Sullivan also cast [[British people|British]] veteran actress and Oscar winner, [[Wendy Hiller]], in the role of the impossible Mrs. Harris whom Sullivan created based on a composite of several matriarchs found in the series of novels.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn Canada, the film became the highest rated drama to air on network television in Canadian broadcasting history. This Sequel became known as ''Anne of Green Gables - The Sequel'' when shown around the world, and as ''Anne of Avonlea - the Continuing Story of Anne of Green Gables '' when it premiered on The Disney Channel.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel (1987 Television Miniseries) |url=https://lmmonline.org/anne-of-green-gables-the-sequel-1987/ |website=L.M.
