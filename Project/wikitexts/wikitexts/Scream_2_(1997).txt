It stars [[Neve Campbell]], [[David Arquette]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Jamie Kennedy]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], [[Jerry O'Connell]], [[Elise Neal]], [[Timothy Olyphant]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] and [[Liev Schreiber]]. The film was released on December 12, 1997, less than a year after the [[Scream (1996 film)|first]], by [[Dimension Films]], as the second installment in the [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' film series]]. It was followed by three sequels, ''[[Scream 3]]'' (2000), ''[[Scream 4]]'' (2011), and ''[[Scream (2022 film)|Scream]]'' (2022). ''Scream 2'' takes place two years after the [[Scream (1996 film)|first film]] and again follows the character of [[Sidney Prescott]] (Campbell), and other survivors of the Woodsboro massacre, at the fictional Windsor College in [[Ohio]], where they are targeted by a [[Copycat crime|copycat]] killer using the guise of [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]]. Like its predecessor, ''Scream 2'' combines the violence of the slasher genre with elements of comedy, satire and \"[[whodunit]]\" mystery while satirizing the [[clich\u00e9]] of film [[sequel]]s.\n\nWilliamson provided a five-page outline for a sequel to ''Scream'' when auctioning his original script, hoping to entice bidders with the potential of buying a franchise. Following a successful [[test screening]] of ''Scream'' and the film's financial and critical success, Dimension moved forward with the sequel while ''Scream'' was still in theaters, with the principal cast all returning to star, Craven to direct and Beltrami to provide music.\n\nThe film suffered controversy following its significant issues with plot information [[Internet leak|leaking]] onto the [[Internet]], revealing the identity of the killers. Combined with the film's rushed schedule, the script was rewritten often; pages were sometimes completed on the day of filming. Despite these issues, ''Scream 2'' earned $172.4{{nbsp}}million at the box office, only $683,362 less than ''Scream'', and received positive reviews from critics, with some arguing that it surpassed the original in quality.\n\nBeltrami received positive critical reception for his score for evolving the musical themes of the characters created in ''Scream'', although some critics claimed that the most memorable pieces from the film were created by composers [[Danny Elfman]] and [[Hans Zimmer]]. Elfman's contribution had been specially written for the film, but Zimmer's score for ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' was controversially used in the film, replacing Beltrami's own work. The film's soundtrack achieved moderate sales success, reaching number 50 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo Windsor College seniors, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens, attend a sneak preview of ''Stab'', a [[film within a film|film]] based on the [[Scream (1996 film)|events of the Woodsboro massacre]]. Briefly exiting the theater to use the bathroom, Phil is killed by the masked killer now known as [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]]. Ghostface sits beside Maureen in Phil's place and stabs her, leading her to climb up on stage in a cry for help, which the audience mistakes for a publicity stunt until she falls dead.\n\nThe news media, including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where [[Sidney Prescott]] studies alongside her best friend Hallie McDaniel, her new boyfriend Derek Feldman, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy Meeks and Derek's best friend Mickey Altieri. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive: police officer Dewey Riley to offer Sidney protection, and reporter [[Gale Weathers]] to cover the case. Gale and her new camera man, Joel Jones, unsuccessfully try to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the rape and murder of Sidney's mother, Maureen Prescott.\n\nThat evening, Sidney and Hallie attend a party at a [[sorority house]]. At another nearby sorority house, Ghostface murders student Cici Cooper. After the partygoers leave, Ghostface enters the house and attacks Sidney. Ghostface injures Derek but flees when the police arrive. Later, after realizing that Cici's real name is Casey, Gale theorizes that the new Ghostface is targeting students with the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims. Randy theorizes that the killer is likely someone Sidney knows and is basing the killings on a movie sequel. Soon after, Ghostface calls Gale, Dewey, and Randy while they're sitting together in daylight on the college campus green. Gale and Dewey tell Randy to keep him on the line while they go around confronting everyone else in the surrounding area who is on a cell phone. Ghostface ambushes Randy, pulling him into Joel's media van, where he is murdered. Joel, scared he will be targeted next, skips town. As night falls on the campus, Dewey and Gale go to a building to review tapes of footage shot by Joel, hoping to spot the killer in the vicinity of the previous crime scenes, but the killer attacks them, stabbing Dewey. Two officers drive Sidney and Hallie to a safe house, but Ghostface intercepts the car and murders them. In the ensuing struggle, Ghostface is knocked unconscious, but recovers and kills Hallie.\n\nDrawn to music playing in the campus theatre, seeking safety, Sidney finds Derek in the auditorium tied to a cross from an earlier fraternity [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|hazing]] ritual. Ghostface arrives, revealing himself to be Mickey, and shoots Derek, killing him. Mickey intends to kill Sidney and allow himself to be arrested so he can blame violence in movies for the murders at his trial. Local reporter Debbie Salt is then revealed to be his accomplice, whom Sidney recognizes as Mrs. Loomis. Mrs. Loomis betrays Mickey and shoots him, reflexively shooting and injuring Gale before he collapses. Mrs. Loomis reveals that she is seeking revenge against Sidney for killing her son, Billy, but Sidney points out the hypocrisy of her motive, considering that Mrs. Loomis abandoned her own son in the past, which caused him to turn into a serial killer. The pair fight until Cotton intervenes. Mrs. Loomis attempts to manipulate Cotton into murdering Sidney, but he chooses to shoot Mrs. Loomis in exchange for an interview with Sidney and [[Diane Sawyer]]. Mickey suddenly resurfaces, but he is then promptly and viciously gunned down and killed by Gale and Sidney. Sidney then shoots Mrs. Loomis in the head to ensure she is dead.\n\nWhen the police arrive, Dewey is revealed to still be alive and Gale climbs into the ambulance with him rather than taking the opportunity to report to the returned Joel, indicating that she cares more for Dewey than for the notoriety she always sought. Sidney instructs the press to direct questions to Cotton, rewarding him with the fame he has been chasing while removing the attention from herself.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Further|topic=individual characters|List of Scream (film series) characters}}\n{{Further|topic=cast members|List of Scream (film series) cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Neve Campbell]] as [[Sidney Prescott]]\n* [[David Arquette]] as [[Dewey Riley]]\n* [[Courteney Cox]] as [[Gale Weathers]]\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Cici Cooper|Cici Cooper]]\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as [[Randy Meeks]]\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Debbie Salt|Debbie Salt]]\n* [[Elise Neal]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Hallie|Hallie]]\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Derek|Derek]]\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Mickey|Mickey Altieri]]\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Maureen Evans|Maureen Evans]]\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as [[Cotton Weary]]\n* [[Lewis Arquette]] as Louis Hartley\n* [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Gus Gold|Gus Gold]]\n* [[Duane Martin]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Joel|Joel]]\n* [[Rebecca Gayheart]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Lois|Lois]]\n* [[Portia de Rossi]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Murphy|Murphy]]\n* [[Omar Epps]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Phil Stevens|Phil Stevens]]\n* [[Marisol Nichols]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Dawnie|Dawnie]]\n* [[Nancy O'Dell]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Reporter|reporter]]\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Film Class Guy|film class guy #1]]\n* [[Tori Spelling]] as herself and [[Sidney Prescott]] (character in the in-universe film ''Stab'')\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as himself as [[Billy Loomis]] (character in the in-universe film ''Stab'')\n* [[Heather Graham]] as herself as [[Casey Becker]] (character in the in-universe film ''Stab'')\n* [[Roger L.

Following the release of ''Scream'', Williamson would confirm that he had considered a sequel concept where the character of Sidney Prescott would now be attending college and a [[copycat crime|copycat]] [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]] killer would start a new series of murders. [[Dimension Films]] agreed to pursue the sequel in March 1997, by which point Williamson already had forty-two pages of the plot developed<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Marc|date=January 1998|title=Super-Secret Scream 2|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_169_1998_Alien_Resurrection_HQS_c2c|journal=[[Fangoria]]|issue=169|pages=20\u201325, 82}}</ref> which involved four different killers, [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Derek Feldman|Derek]], [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Hallie|Hallie]], [[Cotton Weary]], and [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Debbie Salt|Mrs. Loomis]], who is the mother of one of the previous film's killers.<ref name=\"imsdb2\"/> By July 1997, filming began on ''Scream 2'' but after Williamson transferred his script to the production it was [[Internet leak|leaked]] onto the [[Internet]] in full, revealing the identity of the killers and a large amount of the involved plot.<ref name=\"scriptleak2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Scream_2_rewritten_after_script_leak/6845335|title=Scream 2 rewritten after script leak|date=April 30, 2010|access-date=March 15, 2011|archive-date=December 6, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121206011700/http://www.hollywood.com/news/Scream_2_rewritten_after_script_leak/6845335|url-status=live}}</ref> This resulted in the production continuing to film with only a partial script while Williamson conducted extensive rewrites, changing much of the film's finale, the identities of the film's killers and drastically altering the roles of other characters such as [[Randy Meeks]] and [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Joel|Joel]].<ref name=\"scriptleak2\"/>\n\nTo avoid another such incident and prevent sensitive plot details being revealed through other means, the actors were not given the last pages of the script until weeks before shooting and the pages that revealed the killer's identity were only provided on the day the scene was shot to the actors involved.<ref name=\":0\" /> The short production schedule on ''Scream 2'' and his work on other projects meant that Williamson's final script used for the film was detailed in some areas but lacking in others, with Wes Craven forced to write and develop certain scenes as they were being filmed.<ref name=\"fangoria171\"/>\n\nThe incident was the first in which a film was significantly affected by an Internet leak.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 31, 2018 |title=Local Man Makes National News with 'Scream Comes Home' Event |url=https://explorevenango.com/clarion-man-makes-national-news-with-scream-comes-home-event/ |access-date=October 13, 2021 |website=exploreVenango.com |archive-date=October 28, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028140359/https://explorevenango.com/clarion-man-makes-national-news-with-scream-comes-home-event/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2017, Williamson claimed the leaked script was a \"dummy draft\" that was crafted specifically to avoid leaked details.<ref name=\"dreadcentral\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/261779/exclusive-scream-2s-jerry-oconnell-kevin-williamson-talk-leaked-scripts-different-killers/ |title=Exclusive: Scream 2's Jerry O'Connell and Kevin Williamson Talk Leaked Scripts and Different Killers! |last=Mullins |first=Travis |date=December 12, 2017 |website=[[Dread Central]] |access-date=December 15, 2017 |archive-date=December 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213012304/https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/261779/exclusive-scream-2s-jerry-oconnell-kevin-williamson-talk-leaked-scripts-different-killers/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Williamson claimed there were three dummy endings written.\n\n{{blockquote|\"They were worried the killer's identity would be leaked, so we wrote several endings.

Jackson]] also returned to voice the character of [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]].\n\nHaving finalized the returning principal cast from ''Scream'', the production approached their casting for ''Scream 2'' in a similar manner, seeking established and popular actors, largely sourcing from TV shows of the time. In interviews, the production staff of the film remarked that they found approaching and securing the talent they wanted significantly easier than it had been for ''Scream'', considering the financial and critical success of the film but also believing the prior involvement of [[Drew Barrymore]] had lent the horror genre an element of credibility which made serious actors eager to become involved.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNew cast included [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[sorority]] sister and film fan [[Casey \"Cici\" Cooper|Cici Cooper]], [[Elise Neal]] as Sidney's friend and roommate [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Hallie|Hallie]], [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Sidney's boyfriend [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Derek Feldman|Derek]], [[Timothy Olyphant]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Mickey|Mickey]] and [[Laurie Metcalf]] as local reporter [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Debbie Salt|Debbie Salt]], later revealed as Mrs. Loomis, mother of [[Billy Loomis]] from ''Scream''.

Gellar in particular was in-between filming of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV Series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and had only recently finished work on another Williamson-penned film, ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997). Despite the hectic scheduling, Gellar admitted in an interview that she agreed to perform in ''Scream 2'' without having read the script because of the success of ''Scream''.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\"/> Metcalf had only just finished her nine-year run on the popular sitcom ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' when she began work on ''Scream 2'' and Craven was praising of her ability to portray the deranged Mrs. Loomis.<ref name=\"scream2dvdcommentary\"/> To obtain the role of Derek, O'Connell and other candidates had to audition by performing a scene from the film where the character sings \"[[I Think I Love You]]\".<ref name=\"scream2dvdcommentary\"/> Olyphant's involvement as Mickey was his first leading role in a feature film. Despite scheduling difficulties, Craven took their desire to participate in the film despite their workload as a compliment to the film's quality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe cast was rounded out by [[Lewis Arquette]], father of David Arquette, as a local Sheriff in charge of investigating the new murders, [[Duane Martin]] as Gale's [[cameraman]] [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Joel|Joel]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] and [[Omar Epps]] as [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens|Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens]], patrons of the fictional \"Stab\" film who become the film's opening victims, and [[Portia de Rossi]] and [[Rebecca Gayheart]] as sorority sisters Murphy and Lois. Gayheart had auditioned for the role of [[Tatum Riley]] in ''Scream'' and auditioned multiple times for ''Scream 2'' for the roles of Cici Cooper, Hallie and Maureen Evans before obtaining her eventual role.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\"/> Minor roles were filled by Chris Doyle and Philip Pavel as Officer Richards and Officer Andrews, assigned to protect Sidney, veteran actor [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as Sidney's drama teacher, [[Joshua Jackson]] as an unnamed film student, and [[Nancy O'Dell]] as an unnamed reporter who would reprise the role in future installments of the series. [[Tori Spelling]], [[Luke Wilson]] and [[Heather Graham]] played themselves as characters in the \"Stab\" films; credited as Stab Sidney, Stab Billy and Stab [[Casey Becker|Casey]] respectively. Spelling was cast based on a sarcastic remark by Campbell's character in ''Scream'' that she would be played by Spelling in a movie based on her life. Craven remarked that she was a \"good sport\" about the joke and happy to take part.<ref name=\"scream2dvdcommentary\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] for ''Scream 2'' took place over a nine-week period beginning in mid-June 1997<ref>{{cite web |author=Yahoo Movies |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/cash-dash-8-sequels-hollywood-rushed-into-theaters-92151582377.html |title=Sequel Opportunity: 8 of the Fastest Follow-Ups in Film History |publisher=Yahoo.com |date=July 18, 2014 |access-date=January 23, 2019 |archive-date=January 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123223439/https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/cash-dash-8-sequels-hollywood-rushed-into-theaters-92151582377.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and on a budget of $24{{nbsp}}million. [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and [[Los Angeles]] were used to represent the state of [[Ohio]], where the fictional Windsor College is situated in ''Scream 2'', with filming taking place largely in Los Angeles and over four weeks in Atlanta. The opening scene featuring the premiere of the fictional \"Stab\" film was filmed over three days in the Vista theater on Sunset Drive, Hollywood, the exterior represented by the Rialto theater in [[South Pasadena, California]].<ref name=\"scream2filmlocations\"/> Due to the large number of extras present in the scene, full details of what occurred were leaked onto the Internet shortly after filming completed which Craven cited as the production's first experience of a major plot leak.<ref name=\"scream2dvdcommentary\"/> The [[sorority]] homes used by the character [[Casey \"Cici\" Cooper|Cici Cooper]] and a nearby party were also filmed in Pasadena, east of Los Angeles.<ref name=\"scream2filmlocations\"/> The fictional ''Stab'' film was filmed in [[Malibu, California]].<ref name=\"scream2filmlocations\"/> [[Agnes Scott College]], just outside Atlanta,<ref name=\"AtlantaMagazine\"/> and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in Los Angeles were used to represent the fictional Windsor College which appears in the film.<ref name=\"scream2dvdcommentary\"/>\n\nFollowing a script leak early into filming, security around the production was significantly increased, with a focus on closed [[Set construction|filmset]]s and strict restrictions on what personnel could be present during filming and have access to the script, with all present required to sign [[non-disclosure agreements]]. The script itself was reprinted on specialty paper to prevent [[photocopying]] and was often destroyed after use.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\"/>\n\n=== Post-production ===\nCraven had difficulties passing ''Scream'' through the film-rating body [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA]] to receive an R-rating to help the film remain commercially viable,<ref name=\"GuardianNC17\"/> sending eight different cuts and requiring the direct intervention of Dimension Films founder [[Bob Weinstein]] to eventually get the necessary rating to release the film without significant cuts.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\"/>\n\nEager to avoid the same experience on ''Scream 2'', Craven attempted to manipulate the MPAA by sending them a version of the film that had been edited to focus on and enhance the gore and violence present beyond what they actually wanted in the film, including reusing a clip of [[Omar Epps]]' [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens|character Phil Stevens]] being stabbed in the ear three times, instead of only once as seen in the final film, and an extended scene of [[Randy Meeks]]' death that showed his throat being slashed. Craven's reasoning was that the parts of the film they wished to keep would be more acceptable when viewed with the enhanced violence and so the MPAA would force them to remove the footage they already did not want to keep while passing the content they did want. However, the MPAA granted ''Scream 2'' an R-rating for the more violent cut as they believed the underlying message of the film was significant enough to warrant the violence.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\"/>\n\n=== Music ===\n[[Marco Beltrami]] returned to helm the [[film score|score]] for ''Scream 2'', though there would be a late inclusion by [[Danny Elfman]] in the form of the choral track \"Cassandra Aria\" which plays during a scene where Campbell's character performs in a [[Play (theatre)|play]] and again in the film's finale as \"Cassandra Aria Reprise\". Excerpts from the score of the 1996 film ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' by [[Hans Zimmer]] appeared in the film, in particular guitar work by [[Duane Eddy]], for the character Dewey, replacing the tracks that had been developed for the character from the original ''Scream'' score. Beltrami would explain in an interview that the Zimmer piece was used as a [[Studio recording#The process|placeholder]] for Beltrami's incomplete score during a [[test screening]]. The test audience reaction to it influenced the studio to keep the Zimmer piece, reducing \"Dewey's Theme\", which Beltrami had composed to fill its place, to minor use during more serious scenes involving the character.<ref name=\"scream2dvdcommentary\"/><ref name=\"bsospiritbeltrami\"/> In 1998 [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] released a 30-minute album with music from ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2'', and in 2016 ''Scream 2: The Deluxe Edition'' was released including the Elfman material and the complete Beltrami score.\n\n=== Trivia ===\n[[Matthew Lillard]] has an uncredited [[cameo appearance]] at a sorority party, after previously portraying [[Stu Macher]] in ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' (1996).<ref>{{cite video|people=[[Wes Craven|Craven, Wes]] (Director), [[Marianne Maddalena]] (Producer) and [[Patrick Lussier]] (Editor)|date=December 7, 1997|title=Scream 2: Commentary (time \u2013 37:20)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120082|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Dimension Films]]|location=United States|access-date=August 15, 2011|archive-date=January 31, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220131045247/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120082|url-status=live}}</ref> He revealed in a 2009 interview that Stu was originally intended to be revealed as the killer in ''[[Scream 3]]'', having survived his apparent death in ''Scream'' (1996), [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] making his ''Scream 2'' character also Stu;<ref>{{cite web |first=Bob |last=Bendick |url=http://www.bobbendickpodcast.com/BBP/download_shows/Entries/2010/1/9_Matthew_Lillard.html|title=Matthew Lillard and I do the talk talk|publisher=Acme Comedy|work=bobbendickpodcast.com|date=November 30, 2009|access-date=March 15, 2011|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708074954/http://www.bobbendickpodcast.com/BBP/download_shows/Entries/2010/1/9_Matthew_Lillard.html|archive-date=July 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Vanessa|last1=Ragland|first2=Cole|last2=Stratton|url=http://www.popmyculturepodcast.com/?p=1318|title=PMC 13: Matthew Lillard (Relevant information - 26 minutes in)|publisher=Pop My Culture|work=popmyculturepodcast.com|date=July 2010|access-date=April 24, 2011|archive-date=August 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814031048/http://www.popmyculturepodcast.com/?p=1318|url-status=live}}</ref> however, this plot was abandoned and the script was rewritten without Stu.\n\nAn [[alternate ending]] was planned to reveal a third Ghostface killer to be watching Sidney from her university roof, but the idea was scrapped.<ref>{{Cite video|people=Rico, Diana|title=E!

The album spent ten weeks on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], rising as high as #50,<ref name=\"scream2Billboard\"/> performing significantly better than the ''Scream'' original soundtrack which never charted.<ref name=\"Scream1SoundtrackBillboard\"/> Music guide AllMusic however scored the album lower than its predecessor. AllMusic's Stephen Erlewine was highly critical of the album, believing the content was an attempt to compensate for the previous film's lack of a hit soundtrack, but the attempt had failed, creating an \"uneven\" album of songs not \"good enough to make [the artists'] own albums\", awarding it only 2 stars out of 5.<ref name=\"scream2soundtrack2\"/>  Only one song featured in the film did not appear on the album, the original work, \"Take Away the Fear\", written and performed by Craven's own daughter Jessica Craven and Mike Mancini, which plays on a TV during an early scene in a sorority house involving [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]. On February 4, 1998 ''Scream 2: Music from the Dimension Motion Picture'' was certified [[RIAA certification#Records|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], signifying that the album achieved sales in excess of 500,000 units.<ref name=\"scream2albumRIAA\"/>\n{{Track listing\n|collapsed=no\n|headline=''Scream 2: Music from the Dimension Motion Picture''\n|extra_column=Artist\n|total_length=1:02:09\n|title1=Scream\n|writer1=[[Master P]]\n|extra1=Master P, [[Silkk The Shocker]]\n|length1=3:30\n|title2=Suburban Life\n|writer2=[[Kottonmouth Kings]] and AK Brothers\n|extra2=Kottonmouth Kings\n|length2=3:34\n|title3 = Rivers\n|writer3 = [[Sugar Ray]] and [[McG]]\n|extra3 = Sugar Ray\n|length3 = 2:50\n|title4 = She's Always in My Hair\n|writer4 = [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]\n|extra4 = [[D'Angelo]]\n|length4 = 6:19\n|title5 = Help Myself\n|writer5 = [[David J Matthews]]\n|extra5 = [[Dave Matthews Band]]\n|length5 = 4:31\n|title6 = She Said\n|writer6 = [[Ed Roland]]\n|extra6 = [[Collective Soul]]\n|length6 = 4:51\n|title7 = [[In the Right Place|Right Place, Wrong Time]]\n|writer7 = [[Dr. John|Malcolm \"Mac\" Rebennack aka Dr. John]]\n|extra7 = [[The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]]\n|length7 = 3:16\n|title8 = Dear Lover\n|writer8 = [[Dave Grohl]], [[Pat Smear]] and [[Nate Mendel]]\n|extra8 = [[Foo Fighters]]\n|length8 = 4:33\n|title9 = Eyes of Sand\n|writer9 =  [[Emerson Hart]] and [[Tonic (band)|Tonic]]\n|extra9 = Tonic\n|length9 = 4:16\n|title10 = The Swing\n|writer10 = [[Art Alexakis]] and [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]]\n|extra10 = [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]]\n|length10 = 2:59\n|title11 = [[I Think I Love You]]\n|writer11 = [[Tony Romeo]]\n|extra11 = [[Less Than Jake]]\n|length11 = 2:03\n|title12 = [[Your Lucky Day in Hell]]\n|writer12 = [[Mark Oliver Everett|E]] and Mark Goldenberg\n|extra12 = [[Eels (band)|Eels]]\n|length12 = 4:26\n|title13 = [[Red Right Hand]] ([[DJ Spooky]] Mix)\n|writer13 = [[Mick Harvey]], [[Nick Cave]], and [[Thomas Wydler]]\n|extra13 = [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]\n|length13 = 8:23\n|title14 = One More Chance\n|writer14 = Kelly and T Smoov\n|extra14 = Kelly\n|length14 = 4:14\n|title15 = The Race\n|writer15 = [[David Arquette]], Gabe Cowan, and Sammy Music\n|extra15 = Ear2000\n|length15=2:03}}\n\n=== Score ===\nThe ''Scream 2'' original score was, as in ''Scream'', developed by Marco Beltrami and was released on July 14, 1998, by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on a CD which also contained tracks from the score of ''Scream'' entitled \"Scream/Scream 2\".<ref name=\"scream2score2\"/>  The commercially released score for both films was found to be lacking many pieces heard in either film, consisting of only nine tracks \u2013 \"Stage Fright Requiem\", \"Love Turns Sour\", \"Cici Creepies\", \"Deputy for a Friend\", \"Hollow Parting\", \"Dewpoint/Stabbed\", \"Hairtrigger Lunatic\", \"Sundown Search\" and \"It's Over, Sid\" \u2013 with a runtime of only 17 minutes, compared to nearly 90 minutes of score developed for the film and the more common 30\u201345 minutes of music found in other original scores.<ref name=\"scream2score2\"/>  The release was also found to be missing the track \"Cassandra Aria\" by [[Danny Elfman]], described by soundtrack-review site [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]] as \"a frenzied, choral-enhanced three minutes\".<ref name=\"scream1score\" />  The length of the released score was considered disappointing with some reviews considering the track omissions the result of the high fees required to be paid to composers in order to release their music commercially.<ref name=\"scream2score2\" />\n\nThe influence of several other famous composers could be heard in the score including [[Hans Zimmer]], [[Elliot Goldenthal]], [[Ennio Morricone]] and [[Christopher Young]]. In particular excerpts of the Hans Zimmer's score to ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'', particularly the tracks \"Brothers\" and \"Secure\", featuring guitar work by [[Duane Eddy]], would become a component of the theme tune of the character Dewey Riley. Filmtracks was complimentary to the score, appreciating Beltrami's evolution of his work in ''Scream'' but remarked that the most memorable music of the film would be from other composers, Elfman's contribution \"Cassandra Aria\" and the samples from Zimmer's score, finding the replacement of Beltrami's work for the Dewey character with Zimmer's work \"effective\". Ultimately, the album was called unsatisfying without Elfman's piece but better than the score for the first movie and it was awarded 3 stars out of 5.<ref name=\"scream1score\"/> The music guide AllMusic was more complimentary of Beltrami's contribution, saying the score \"perfectly captured the post-modern, hip scare-ride of the Scream movies\", and awarded it 3 stars out of 5.<ref name=\"scream2soundtrack2\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of films featuring fictional films]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"scream2albumRIAA\">{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database|title=RIAA's Gold and Platinum program|work=RIAA|publisher=RIAA.com|access-date=May 7, 2011|archive-date=January 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103185214/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"fangoria162\">{{cite journal|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|date=May 1997|title=Scream and Scream Again|journal=Fangoria|issue=162|pages=66\u201368|publisher=Starlog Group Inc.}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"scream2gross\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=scream2.htm|title=Scream 2 (1997)|work=Box Office Mojo|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc|access-date=November 10, 2019|archive-date=August 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823003738/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=scream2.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"imsdb2\">{{cite web|author=Kevin Williamson|publisher=Internet Movie Script Database|url=https://imsdb.com/scripts/Scream-2.html|title=Scream 2 screenplay by Kevin Williamson|year=1997|access-date=March 15, 2011|archive-date=April 18, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418045844/https://imsdb.com/scripts/Scream-2.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\">{{Cite video| people = Diana Rico| title = E!
