The film follows a battle between two wizards of opposing powers, one representing the forces of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and the other representing the forces of technology.\n\nThe film is notable for being the first [[fantasy film]] by Bakshi, a filmmaker who was previously known only for \"urban films\" such as ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'', ''[[Heavy Traffic]]'' and ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]''. The film grossed {{US$}}9 million theatrically with a $2 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[Earth]] has been devastated by a [[nuclear war]]. It takes 2 million years for the [[radioactive cloud]]s to allow sunlight in. The humans who survived the [[apocalypse]] have been transformed into mutants, while humanity's true ancestors &nbsp;\u2013 [[Fairy|fairies]], [[Elf|elves]] and [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] \u2013 resurface and live in the idyllic land of Montagar.\n\nWhile her people celebrate 3,000 years of peace, Delia, queen of the fairies, falls into a trance and gives birth to twin wizards: the kindhearted Avatar and his evil, mutated brother Blackwolf. After Delia's death years later, Blackwolf attempts to usurp her leadership, but Avatar defeats him in a magical duel. Blackwolf leaves Montagar, vowing to return and \"make this a planet where mutants rule\".\n\nThree thousand years later, Blackwolf leads the dark land of Scortch, where he and his army of mutants and other evil creatures ([[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[troll]]s, [[dragon]]s, etc.), salvage and restore ancient technology. He tries to attack Montagar twice, but is foiled when his mutant warriors become bored or sidetracked in the midst of battle. Blackwolf then discovers an old [[projector]] and reels of [[Nazi propaganda]] footage from [[World War II]], using his magic to enhance it for [[psychological warfare]]: inspiring his own soldiers while horrifying enemy troops into submission.\n\n[[File:Wizards cast.jpg|left|thumb|Peace, Avatar, Weehawk and Elinore]]\nMeanwhile, in Montagar, Avatar trains the president's daughter, Elinore, to become a full-fledged fairy. Suddenly, the president is assassinated by Necron 99, a robot sent by Blackwolf to kill all believers in magic. Avatar subdues the robot and reconditions it for nonviolence, changing its name to Peace \"in the hopes that he will bring it\". Avatar learns from the robot that the \"dream machine\"&nbsp;\u2013 the projector&nbsp;\u2013 is Blackwolf's secret weapon. Avatar, Elinore, Peace, and the elf warrior Weehawk set out to destroy the projector and save the world from another [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn a forest inhabited by fairies, the group is accosted by their leader, Sean. Weehawk realizes that Peace is missing, when an unseen assassin kills Sean and kidnaps Elinore. Avatar and Weehawk begin to search for Elinore in the forbidden Fairy Sanctuary, but Weehawk falls into a chasm and insists that Avatar leave him and find the girl. Avatar locates her, captured by fairies and small human-like creatures, just as she is about to be killed. Avatar attempts to explain that they did not kill Sean, but the fairies do not believe him and shoot him with an arrow. Wounded in the shoulder, Avatar refuses to fight back, which impresses the fairy king. Instead of executing them, he merely [[teleportation|teleports]] Avatar and Elinore to a snowy mountaintop. Avatar and Elinore resume their journey, but they soon realize that they are wandering in circles. Peace and Weehawk (whom Peace saved from a vicious monster in the chasm) find Avatar and Elinore. Together, they find their way out of the mountains. Soon, Avatar and the others encounter the encamped army of an elf General who is preparing to attack Scortch the following day, but Blackwolf launches a sneak attack that night.\n\nElinore and Peace are attacked by one of Blackwolf's demons which Avatar quickly dispatches. When one of Blackwolf's battle tanks arrives to destroy the camp, Elinore unexpectedly kills Peace and climbs into the tank as it drives off.\n\nThe next day, Avatar and Weehawk enter Scortch by ship and make for Blackwolf's castle, while the General leads his elf warriors in a bloody battle to distract Blackwolf's forces. The pair split up, Weehawk tracking Elinore while Avatar goes after Blackwolf. Weehawk nearly kills Elinore, but she explains that Blackwolf had taken control of her mind after she touched Peace. Blackwolf declares his magic superior to Avatar's and demands his surrender. Avatar admits that he has not practiced magic for some time, but offers to show Blackwolf a trick that their mother taught him; Avatar then pulls a pistol from his sleeve and shoots Blackwolf dead. Weehawk destroys the projector, leaving the mutants leaderless and helpless as the General's army defeats them. With Montagar's safety secured, Weehawk returns home as its new ruler, while Avatar and Elinore decide to start their own kingdom elsewhere.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]] as Avatar, an old but powerful wizard.\n* [[Jesse Welles]] as Elinore, a fiery fairy and Avatar's love interest.\n* [[Richard Romanus]] as Weehawk, an elf warrior.\n* [[David Proval]] as Necron 99/Peace, Blackwolf's former minion. He is renamed Peace by Avatar.\n* [[Steve Gravers]] as Blackwolf, Avatar's evil twin brother and main antagonist of the film.\n* James Connell as President, the leader and Elinore\u2019s father.\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as Sean, son of the king of the mountain fairies and captain of the guards.
