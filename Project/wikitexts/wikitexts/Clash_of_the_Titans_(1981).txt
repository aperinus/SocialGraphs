When the god [[Zeus]] impregnates her, Acrisius banishes his daughter and Zeus' newborn son [[Perseus]] to sea in a wooden chest. In retribution, Zeus kills Acrisius and orders [[Poseidon]] to release the last of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], a gigantic [[sea monster]] called the [[Kraken]], to destroy Argos. Dana\u00eb and Perseus safely float to the island of [[Serifos|Seriphos]], where Perseus grows to adulthood.\n\nCalibos, the spoiled and rebellious son of the sea goddess [[Thetis]], is betrothed to Princess [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], daughter of Queen [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Aethiopia)|Cassiopeia]] of [[Jaffa|Joppa]]; but for committing several atrocities against Zeus, including destroying Zeus's sacred flying horses (except for [[Pegasus]]), Zeus transforms Calibos into a deformed, monstrous, [[satyr]]-like creature.\n\nIn revenge, Thetis transports an adult Perseus from Seriphos to an abandoned amphitheater in Joppa, where he befriends a soldier, Thallo, and an elderly poet named Ammon and learns that Andromeda is under a curse and cannot marry unless her suitor, under threat of execution if he fails, successfully answers a riddle concocted by Calibos. Zeus sends Perseus a god-crafted helmet from [[Athena]] which makes its wearer invisible, a magical sword from [[Aphrodite]], and a shield from [[Hera]]. Perseus, wearing the helmet, captures Pegasus and follows Calibos's giant vulture carrying off Andromeda's spirit during her sleep to learn the next riddle. Perseus is discovered and nearly killed by Calibos, but manages to sever Calibos's left hand, losing his helmet in the process.\n[[File:Medusa-ClashofTitans.jpg|220px|thumb|left|The [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]]]]\nThe next morning, Perseus presents himself as the next husband to be and correctly answers the riddle \u2014 that answer being the ring given to Calibos by his mother which is still attached to the amputated hand of Calibos \u2014 winning Andromeda's hand in marriage. Finding that Thetis cannot act against Perseus, Calibos instead demands that she take vengeance on Joppa. At the wedding in Thetis' temple, Queen Cassiopeia declares Andromeda's beauty greater than that of Thetis herself, whereupon an earthquake shakes the temple, causing the head of the statue of Thetis to break off and crash to the floor.\n\nThetis, using the statue's head to speak through, demands Andromeda be sacrificed to the Kraken on pain of Joppa's destruction. Perseus seeks a way to defeat the Kraken, but Pegasus is captured by Calibos and his men. Zeus commands Athena to give Perseus her [[Owl of Athena|owl]] Bubo, but Athena refuses to part with Bubo, so instead orders [[Hephaestus]] to build a golden, mechanical replica of him, who leads Perseus, Andromeda, Ammon, Thallo and some soldiers to the [[Graeae|Stygian Witches]]. By taking their magic eye, Perseus forces them to reveal that the only way to defeat the Kraken is by using the head of the gorgon [[Medusa]], whose gaze can turn any living thing into stone, and who lives on an island in the [[Styx|River Styx]] at the edge of the [[Underworld]]. The next day, the group continues on their journey without Andromeda and Ammon, who return to Joppa.\n[[File:Titans Kraken.jpg|220px|thumb|right|The [[Kraken]] comes to claim [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]].]]\nOn the [[Gorgon]]'s island, most of Perseus' men are killed. Perseus fights and kills Medusa's guardian, a two-headed dog named Dioskilos. Perseus then enters the Gorgon's lair, where he uses the reflective underside of his shield to deceive Medusa, decapitate her, and collect her head; but the shield is dissolved by her caustic blood. As Perseus and his party set to return, Calibos enters their camp and punctures the cloak carrying Medusa's head, causing her blood to spill and produce three giant scorpions. Calibos and the scorpions attack and kill Perseus's remaining escorts, including Thallo, whose death Perseus mourns. Perseus overcomes the scorpions and thereafter kills Calibos.\n\nWeakened by his struggle, Perseus sends Bubo to rescue Pegasus from Calibos's henchmen and reaches the amphitheater in Joppa, where he collapses from exhaustion. Andromeda is shackled to the sacrificial rock outside Joppa, and the Kraken is summoned. Bubo distracts the beast until Perseus, whose strength was secretly restored by Zeus, appears on Pegasus. In the subsequent battle, Perseus petrifies the Kraken with Medusa's head, causing it to crumble to pieces. He then tosses the head into the sea, frees Andromeda, and marries her.\n\nThe gods predict that Perseus and Andromeda will live happily, rule wisely, and produce children, and Zeus forbids the other gods to pursue vengeance against them. The [[constellation]]s of [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]], [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]] and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] are created in their honor.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Harry Hamlin]] as [[Perseus]]\n* [[Judi Bowker]] as [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as Ammon\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Thetis]]\n* [[Si\u00e2n Phillips]] as [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Aethiopia)|Cassiopeia]]\n* [[Claire Bloom]] as [[Hera]]\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as [[Aphrodite]]\n* [[Laurence Olivier]] as [[Zeus]]\n* [[Pat Roach]] as [[Hephaestus]]\n* [[Susan Fleetwood]] as [[Athena]]\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Thallo\n* [[Jack Gwillim]] as [[Poseidon]]\n* [[Neil McCarthy (actor)|Neil McCarthy]] as Calibos\n* Vida Taylor as [[Dana\u00eb]]\n* [[Donald Houston]] as [[Acrisius]]\n* [[Flora Robson]], [[Anna Manahan]] and [[Freda Jackson]] as the [[Graeae|Stygian Witches]]\n\n==Production==\nThe film was the idea of writer [[Beverley Cross]].<ref>Ray Harryhausen Talks About His Cinematic Magic.

The draft script included scenes that the BBFC considered would be unacceptable under those certificates, including the Kraken tearing Pegasus to pieces and Andromeda appearing naked during the climax of the film. Changes to the script and, on submission, some cuts to Perseus's final battle with Calibos were made and the film secured the \"A\" certificate: \"Those aged 5 and older admitted, but not recommended for children under 14 years of age\".<ref name=\"BBFC\">[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/_featured/2012/03/from-the-archive-we-look-back-at-clash-of-the-titans/ From the Archive\u2026.we look back at ''Clash of the Titans'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}, BBFC, retrieved 2012-03-13</ref>\n\n[[Ray Harryhausen]] used [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]] to create the various creatures in the film, including Calibos, his vulture, [[Pegasus]], Bubo the mechanical [[Owl of Athena|owl]], Dioskilos, [[Medusa]], the scorpions and the [[Kraken]]. Harryhausen was also co-producer of the film, and retired from film-making shortly after it was released. Despite Bubo's similarities to the [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]] [[R2-D2]] of the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', Harryhausen claimed Bubo was created before ''Star Wars'' was released.<ref>[[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Tony Dalton]], ''Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life'', page 270 (London: [[Aurum Press]] Ltd, 2003) {{ISBN|1-85410-940-5}}.</ref> The BBFC, reviewing the film for certification in 1981, said Harryhausen's effects were well done and would give entertainment to audiences of all ages, but might appear a little \"old hat\" to those familiar with ''Star Wars'' and ''Superman''.<ref name=\"BBFC\"/>\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] were initially set to distribute the film having made most of Harryhausen and producer [[Charles H. Schneer]]'s films, but after a change of guard at the studio, they dropped the project during pre-production, saying it was too expensive. Schneer took it to Orion Pictures who insisted on [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] playing the lead but the producer refused as the role involved too much dialogue. He then tried [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] who agreed to finance. \"They loved the material, they loved the picture, and they were wonderful to us,\" said Schneer. \"As I put the film together and the castings came up, they approved the additional castings and added that expense to the budget.\"<ref name=\"steve\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|first=Steve|last=Swires|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-152/page/n70/mode/1up/search/%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+?q=%22first+men+in+the+moon%22+harryhausen$|date=March 1990|title=Merchant of the Magicks Part Three|page=71}}</ref>\n\nSchneer deliberately sought better known actors to play the Gods to improve the film's chances at the box office. \"If we had played this picture with no recognised actors it might be assumed to be what it isn't.

Claire Bloom said she only agreed to make it \"because I was told Olivier was doing it and it only lasts a week.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nMGM overruled Schneer's choice of [[John Gielgud]] to portray the playwright Ammon, and asked for [[Burgess Meredith]] to be cast instead. \"I saw the sense in that,\" said Schneer. \"They preferred an American actor. They didn't want the public to think it was totally an English picture.\"<ref name=\"steve\"/>\n\nSchneer picked Desmond Davis to direct in part because Davis had made several BBC Shakespeare films and he wanted someone with experience dealing with Shakespearean actors.<ref name=\"steve\"/>\n\nStars [[Harry Hamlin]] and [[Ursula Andress]] were romantically involved at the time of production. Their son, Dimitri, was born in 1980 after filming was completed, and their relationship ended in 1983.\n\n[[Jack Gwillim]], who appeared as [[Poseidon]], had earlier played the role of King [[Ae\u00ebtes]] in the original ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' in 1963.\n\nThe film's screenwriter, [[Beverley Cross]], was married to [[Maggie Smith]], who played Thetis, until his death in 1998.
