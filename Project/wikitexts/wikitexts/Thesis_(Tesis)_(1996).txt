Her commuter train is evacuated after a man commits suicide by jumping in front of the train. While being led out of the station, \u00c1ngela moves toward the tracks in an attempt to see the man's remains. At her school, \u00c1ngela asks her thesis director, Professor Figueroa, to help her find the most violent films in the school's library, and seeks out a fellow student, Chema, who is known for collecting violent and [[Pornographic film|pornographic videos]]. While \u00c1ngela watches a violent film with Chema, Figueroa finds a tape hidden in the school's audiovisual archives. The next day, \u00c1ngela finds Figueroa dead of an apparent [[asthma]] attack in the screening room and retrieves the tape. A younger professor, Castro, takes over the supervision of \u00c1ngela's thesis project. At Chema's house, \u00c1ngela discovers the stolen tape is a [[snuff film]] in which a woman is tortured, killed, and [[disembowelment|disemboweled]]. Chema recognizes the victim is a student from their university named Vanessa, who went missing two years previously. He is able to determine that the killer used a specific model of [[Sony]] camera with a [[digital zoom]] feature, and that the film was shot in someone's garage.\n\nAt the library, \u00c1ngela sees a handsome young man named Bosco using the type of camera Chema identified. When she leaves, he pursues and catches up to her. Bosco notices that \u00c1ngela has newspaper clippings about Vanessa's disappearance and states that he has information about the case. \u00c1ngela pretends she is filming a report about the disappearance and asks to interview Bosco about it. In the interview, Bosco insists that Vanessa must have run away with a boyfriend because she sent a note to her family saying that she was in love. \u00c1ngela is willing to accept Bosco's innocence, but Chema tells her that he is a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]]. Once home, \u00c1ngela realizes that Bosco is inside the house waiting for her. Although she is initially frightened, Bosco charms her family and they invite him to stay for dinner. Once alone, Bosco attempts to seduce \u00c1ngela but she resists his advances. At the school, Chema asks a security guard to see the security tape of the video library on the night of Figueroa's death. That night, \u00c1ngela has a dream that Bosco threatens her with a knife, performs [[oral sex]] on her while videotaping it, and then stabs her.\n\nCastro questions \u00c1ngela about Figueroa's death, showing her a security footage of her discovering the body and taking the videotape. As \u00c1ngela is about to admit why she took the tape, Chema calls and tells her to leave Castro's office immediately, saying that he is involved in the snuff film. Castro fails to catch \u00c1ngela as she flees his office. Bosco's girlfriend, Yolanda, confronts \u00c1ngela and explains that she, Vanessa, Bosco, and Chema, who was once a friend of Bosco, had gone to a series of director's workshops with Castro two years previously. Yolanda states that she left when they made Vanessa take off her clothes for a short film, that Chema was obsessed with snuff films, and that she believes he killed Vanessa after the workshop ended. Later, Chema admits to \u00c1ngela that he knew Bosco, but claims he also left the workshop when things got out of hand. At night, Chema shows \u00c1ngela a hidden tunnel he has discovered in the school's video library. In a room off the tunnel, they find shelves of video tapes like the one of Vanessa, indicating that many other women may have been murdered in other snuff films. Suddenly the door to the tunnel closes and they are locked inside. Fearing they will be killed, Chema and \u00c1ngela walk further into the tunnel with only matches to light their way. They find an editing room where they fall asleep in each other's arms.\n\nWhen \u00c1ngela wakes, the lights have come back on and Chema is gone. She walks through a doorway and is [[chloroform]]ed. She awakens tied to a chair facing Castro, who is videotaping her. Castro tells that he only edited the snuff videos, but that he has to kill her and that her death will be painless and much quicker than Vanessa's. As he aims a gun at \u00c1ngela's head, Chema appears and wrestles with him. The gun goes off, killing Castro. \u00c1ngela and Chema escape. Once at her house, \u00c1ngela's father tells her that her sister, Sena, is at a party with Bosco. Terrified, \u00c1ngela hurries to the party. Once there, Sena refuses to leave with \u00c1ngela, insisting that Bosco is in love with her. In order to persuade her sister to leave, \u00c1ngela approaches Bosco and passionately kisses him. The next day, \u00c1ngela tells Chema they need to go to the police. Although initially reluctant, Chema agrees but takes a shower before leaving. While he is in the bathroom, \u00c1ngela finds a Sony zoom camera among Chema's belongings, which contains a tape showing \u00c1ngela from outside her bedroom window. Convinced that Chema has been [[stalking]] her, \u00c1ngela flees. She goes back home to advise Sena to remain safe, then takes a [[taxi]] to Bosco's house. She is followed by a figure in a black rain coat.\n\nAt Bosco's house, he and \u00c1ngela talk about their relationship. Suddenly, the lights go out and Bosco goes downstairs to check on the power. When \u00c1ngela follows him, she finds him lying on the floor; Chema has followed her to the house and knocked out Bosco. However, Bosco revives and in the struggle that ensues, beats Chema to the ground. While Bosco fetches rope to tie up Chema, he tells \u00c1ngela to look in Bosco's garage. \u00c1ngela does so and recognizes the room from the snuff film of Vanessa. Bosco ties up \u00c1ngela and explains how he intends to torture and kill her. However, she cuts her bonds with a knife, slashes Bosco, grabs his gun, and shoots him dead. \u00c1ngela visits a recovering Chema in the [[hospital]]. On the television in his room, an announcer states that the bodies of six women were found at Bosco's home. \u00c1ngela gives Chema a book inscribed with an invitation to have coffee with her and tells him she is going to abandon her thesis. As they leave, the announcer states that footage from a snuff film will be shown on air.\n\n== Cast ==\nMain cast:<ref>{{Cite web |title=TESIS (1995) |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7eccd4ae |access-date=2022-06-04 |website=BFI |language=en}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Actor\n!Character\n|-\n|[[Ana Torrent]]\n|\u00c1ngela M\u00e1rquez\n|-\n|[[Fele Mart\u00ednez]]\n|Chema\n|-\n|[[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]]\n|Bosco Herranz\n|-\n|[[Xabier Elorriaga]]\n|Professor Jorge Castro\n|-\n|[[Miguel Picazo]]\n|Professor Figueroa\n|-\n|Nieves Herranz\n|Sena M\u00e1rquez\n|-\n|Rosa Campillo\n|Yolanda\n|-\n|Paco Hernandez\n|\u00c1ngela's Father\n|-\n|Rosa Avila\n|\u00c1ngela's Mother\n|-\n|Olga Margallo\n|Vanessa Romero\n|-\n|Teresa Castanedo\n|News Broadcaster\n|}\n\n== Critical response ==\nAs a film made by a film student about film students, much of ''Tesis'' is [[Metacinema|metafilmic]] and comments on the Spanish film industry, Hollywood influence and the voyeuristic nature of the horror and [[Snuff film|snuff]] genres. Following the aesthetic of the American horror genre, Angela operates as the \"[[Final girl|Final Girl]]\",  or resourceful female protagonist that defies stereotypical feminine traits.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url = http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&context=languages_fac|title = Tesis|date = |website = |publisher = |last = Lev|first = Leora}}</ref> Although ''Tesis'' fits the suspenseful mold of a Hollywood horror flick rather than its symbol-rich European counterpart, according to European film critic Marguerite la Caze, ''Tesis'' has a thesis: \"human beings, no matter how well-meaning, are attracted to violence and death in all its forms\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Kinoeye {{!}} Spanish horror: Alejandro Amenabar's Tesis|url = http://www.kinoeye.org/03/05/lacaze05.php|website = www.kinoeye.org|access-date = 2015-07-18}}</ref>\n\n''Tesis'' has generated much critical analysis due to its study of the fascination of violence. Film critic Leora Lev discusses Angela's ethical rejection and simultaneous attraction to violent images as this film's primary conversation. Lev states that Angela's psychosexual conflict with both the snuff film and the murderer, Bosco, is emblematic of the culture that consumes violent films and reality television series.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn the film-critics aggregator  [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Thesis'' has a critical rating of 83% based on 12 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/thesis | title= Thesis| publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | access-date= 2021-06-15 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0117883}}\n*{{Amg movie|136126}}\n*[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/the-metaphysics-of-violence/tesis/ \u201cSnuffing\u201d Hollywood: Transmedia Horror in Tesis], movie analysis at Senses of Cinema\n* [http://www.clubcultura.com/clubcine/clubcineastas/amenabar/tesis.htm Tesis], at Club Cultura\n\n{{Goya Award for Best Film}}\n{{Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar}}\n{{Mateo Gil}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Madrid]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Madrid]]\n[[Category:Madrid in fiction]]\n[[Category:1990s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:Spanish detective films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar]]\n[[Category:Best Film Goya Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films about snuff films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Mateo Gil]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish films]]"}]}}}}
