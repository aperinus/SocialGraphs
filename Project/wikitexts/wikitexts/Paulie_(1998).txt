Mohr performs both the voice of Paulie and the on-screen supporting role of Benny, a character who has a lot of dialogue with him. It received mixed to positive reviews and was a box office disappointment, grossing $26.9 million domestically against a $23 million budget. However, in the years after its release, ''Paulie'' would find a larger audience on home media sales.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is a [[picaresque novel|picaresque]] tale about a [[Blue-crowned Parakeet|blue-crowned conure]] who humans can understand named Paulie (voice of [[Jay Mohr]]), and his long quest to return to his owner. Misha Vilyenkov ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), a Russian [[Emigration|immigrant]] and former teacher of literature, lives in America and works as a janitor at an institute. He encounters Paulie there and is shocked to see him speaking as clearly as a human. Subsequently, he doesn't speak a word when Misha brings others to witness him.\n\nMisha entices Paulie to tell him his story by offering him pieces of [[mango]]. He starts by telling about his original owner, a little girl named Marie ([[Hallie Eisenberg]]) who [[stuttering|stutters]]. The story transitions to a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scene in which he is a baby. As Marie works on speech therapy, he begins to speak too, beginning with understanding the meaning of words and progressing to the construction of complex sentences. Marie's father, Warren ([[Matt Craven]]), a soldier, returns home from [[Vietnam]] and decides that Paulie is not helping her. His resentment of the close bond between them, and their shared progress in speech development, is evident. It becomes obvious that Warren wants Marie to forget Paulie, when he brings her a cat, which Paulie does not get along with. Once again, Warren accuses him for Marie's speaking problems and believes she has imagined his ability to speak to humans. Eventually, after a dramatic event in which she falls off the roof in an attempt to teach Paulie to fly, Warren convinces her mother, Lila ([[Laura Harrington]]), to send him away, which devastates Marie.\n\nPaulie is passed from one owner to another, eventually ending up in a pawn shop, owned by Artie ([[Buddy Hackett]]) where he spends his time insulting the customers. One day, a shady customer named Benny ([[Jay Mohr]]) shows interest in purchasing him, thinking he could profit from his ability to talk to humans. Before he can act, however, a widowed artist named Ivy ([[Gena Rowlands]]) purchases him with the intent of reforming his rude personality. She befriends him and agrees to help him find Marie, who has moved to [[Los Angeles]]. They begin traveling using her [[mobile home]], but when she loses her sight in the middle of their trip, Paulie decides to stay and take care of her. After she dies, Paulie, having finally learned to fly, continues his journey.\n\nIn East Los Angeles, Paulie joins a group of performing [[conure]]s owned by migrant musician Ignacio ([[Cheech Marin]]), temporarily forgetting about Marie as he develops feelings for a female conure named Lupe. At one of his performances, Benny, having also moved to Los Angeles, recognizes him and attempts to purchase him from Ignacio. When Ignacio refuses his offer, Benny makes a phony police call at one of his performances. As the police show up, Benny kidnaps Paulie amidst all the chaos and Ignacio is arrested and presumably deported. Under Benny's influence, Paulie begins a life of crime. In a botched jewel theft, he flies down through the chimney of a house, where he is trapped inside, and then abandoned.\n\nPaulie is then brought to the institute, his current home, where Dr. Reingold ([[Bruce Davison]]), the head of the institute, his employees and fellow scientists are stunned by his ability to speak to humans. They subject him to testing, and Reingold promises that he will be reunited with Marie when they are done. When he discovers that he has been lied to\u2014that Marie has been found but the institute has instead decided to keep him as their property\u2014he refuses to cooperate with any more tests, humiliating Reingold in front of his scientific peers by acting like an ordinary parrot and then insulting him. As a result, his wings are clipped, and he is eventually imprisoned in the basement when he starts pecking the researchers.\n\nMoved by Paulie's story, Misha decides to give up his menial job to release him and take him to Marie. After escaping from the institute, freeing the encaged animals, and taking a bus to her address, they find her, now a full grown, beautiful young woman ([[Trini Alvarado]]) unrecognizable to Paulie. After a moment of confusion, Paulie and Marie are happily reunited as she sings his favorite song and he remembers her. The film ends with the trio happily entering her house.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jay Mohr]] as the voice of Paulie, a [[blue-crowned parakeet]]\n** Mohr also plays Benny, a small-time thief\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Misha, a recent US immigrant from [[Russia]]\n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Ivy, a widowed artist\n* [[Hallie Eisenberg]] as Marie Alweather, a young girl who [[Stuttering|stutters]]\n** [[Trini Alvarado]] as Adult Marie\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Ignacio, a musician\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Dr. Reingold, a biological research [[scientist]]\n* [[Buddy Hackett]] as Artie, owner of a pawn shop\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Warren Alweather, Marie's father\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Virgil, a janitor at the institute\n* [[Tia Texada]] as Ruby and the voice of Lupe, a [[jandaya parakeet]]\n* [[Laura Harrington]] as Lila Alweather, Marie's mother\n* [[Jerry Winsett]] as Mr. Tauper\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=December 2014}}\nDirected by John Roberts and written by Laurie Craig, the film's production budget was $23 million.<ref name=\"boxoffice\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=December 2014}}\nThe film scored a 62% approval rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 37 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paulie/|title=Paulie|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 2015|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=30 October 2022}}</ref> It was distributed in 24 countries and 10 different languages between 1998 and 1999.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Box office receipts grossed $5,369,800 on the opening weekend, and $26,875,268 total.<ref>{{cite news|title= Angels Stays Aloft in Top Spot|work= Los Angeles Times|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/21/entertainment/ca-41370|accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref> It was released in 1,812 North American theaters.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=paulie.htm|title=PAULIE|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2009-04-11 }}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2021}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Award\n!Category\n!Result\n|-\n| [[ALMA Award|ALMA]] Award\n| Outstanding Actor in a Feature Film - Cheech Marin\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| ALMA Award\n| Outstanding Actress in a Feature Film - Trini Alvarado\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[BAFTA]] Children's Award\n| Best Children's Feature Film\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Bronze Gryphon\n| Early Screens - John Roberts\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Young Artist Award]]\n| Best family feature - Comedy\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Young Artist Award\n| Best performance in a feature film - Young Actress aged ten or under - Hallie Kate Eisenberg\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Young Artist Award\n| Best performance by a young actress in a comedy film - Hallie Kate Eisenberg\n| {{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0125454|title=Paulie}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=paulie}}\n* {{mojo title|paulie}}\n* [http://www.petstation.com/paulie.html A bird's review of the movie]\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1990s adventure films]]\n[[Category:1990s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:American children's adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Fictional parrots]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Films about birds]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1978]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1998]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Mutual Film Company films]]\n[[Category:Talking animals in fiction]]\n[[Category:1998 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
