It is directed by [[Takuya Igarashi]] and written by Kafka Asagiri and [[Y\u014dji Enokido]]. It is based on the [[manga]] ''[[Bungo Stray Dogs]]'' written by Asagiri and illustrated by Sango Harukawa. Taking place after events of the second season of the [[anime]] television series, a group of detectives learn of a string of apparent suicide cases that have been happening to people with supernatural powers. [[Atsushi Nakajima (Bungo Stray Dogs)|Atsushi Nakajima]] and his friends thus go to confront the culprit of this case, a man named Tatsuhiko Shibusawa. Returning voice actors include [[Kensho Ono]], [[Kish\u014d Taniyama]], [[Mamoru Miyano]], [[Y\u016bto Uemura]], and [[Akira Ishida]].\n\nThe film was conceived by Asagiri, who wished to continue the story after the television series had concluded in late 2016. The team aimed to create a deep storyline loosely based on the real [[Tatsuhiko Shibusawa]] while balancing the impact of the role of the film's characters, most notably Atsushi and [[List of Bungo Stray Dogs characters#Ch\u016bya Nakahara|Ch\u016bya Nakahara]]. [[Granrodeo]], [[Screen Mode]] and [[Luck Life]] provided the film's theme songs. A two-volume manga adaptation of the film was released in Japan, and two [[light novel]]s were also written to promote the film.\n\nThe film earned a total of {{currency|550|JPY}}&nbsp;million ({{US$|{{To USD|550|JPN|year=2018}}&nbsp;million}}) at the Japanese box office, while winning multiple awards from the magazine ''[[Newtype]]'', most notably the \"Theatrical Film Award\". Critical reception to the film was generally positive for the handling of the character's roles and the visuals, though many felt that newcomers to the series would have difficulty understanding the story.\n\n==Plot==\n6 years ago, the most violent struggle in Yokohama was \"The Dragon Head Conflict\", which involved many organizations and resulted in 88&nbsp;deaths. The night before its conclusion, when [[Osamu Dazai (Bungo Stray Dogs)|Osamu Dazai]] was still in Port Mafia, he and [[List of Bungo Stray Dogs characters#Ch\u016bya Nakahara|Ch\u016bya Nakahara]] discovered a man named Tatsuhiko Shibusawa. In the present, the Armed Detective Agency is called upon to investigate the apparent suicide cases of hundreds of supernatural ability-users around the globe, which occurred when a mysterious fog passed over their countries. The Special Operations Division deduce that this incident is tied to Shibusawa, now a self-proclaimed \"collector\". The night before the Agency is to commence operations, [[Atsushi Nakajima (Bungo Stray Dogs)|Atsushi Nakajima]] has an unsettling dream of his past in an orphanage, where an out-of-place door painted with a white tiger is engulfed in fog. He is awakened by his roommate [[List of Bungo Stray Dogs characters#Ky\u014dka Izumi|Ky\u014dka Izumi]], who also dreamed of fog.  The two soon realise that Yokohama has been engulfed in the mysterious fog, and everyone but the various ability-users have disappeared from the city.\n\nKy\u014dka and Atsushi meet with their superior [[List of Bungo Stray Dogs characters#Doppo Kunikida|Doppo Kunikida]], who reveals that the deaths of ability-users were due to their abilities turning on them. Shibusawa is revealed to have created the fog to draw out Yokohama's gifted, turning their abilities into jewels for his collection while powering the fog. He has allied himself with Dazai and [[List of Bungo Stray Dogs characters#Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. Ky\u014dka and Atsushi make contact with government agent [[List of Bungo Stray Dogs characters#Ango Sakaguchi|Ango Sakaguchi]], who had located the Agency's other ability-users, all of whom are fighting their own abilities. As Kunikida leaves to fight Doppo Poet, the duo encounter mafia member [[List of Bungo Stray Dogs characters#Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa|Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa]], who is fighting his ability, Rash\u014dmon. While each of them duel their own abilities, Atsushi deduces that subduing the ability involves destroying an embedded jewel in them, and defeats his white tiger. Ky\u014dka faces her fear of merging with Demon Snow to become a killing machine, and resolves to save people with her ability. Akutagawa is forced to think outside the box when combatting his ability. Atsushi is unable to use his ability, so Ky\u014dka and Akutagawa decide to journey to Shibusawa's base alone.\n\nFyodor finds two jewels: one which can summon all gifted within sight, and another which can crystallise abilities after their users have died. Dazai, who was secretly working against Shibusawa, nullifies them, depriving the fog of its power source. However, having anticipated this, Shibusawa stabs Dazai with a poisoned knife, intending to steal his ability and transform Dazai into the core of the \"dragon\"&nbsp;\u2013 the chaos of all special abilities&nbsp;\u2013 to destroy Yokohama. As the dragon is summoned, it wreaks havoc. A gifted agency in London called Order of the Clock Tower dispatches a fire gifted to Yokohama in order to destroy the city with the dragon to prevent it from spreading. However, Ango contacts Chuya, who releases Corruption and successfully destroys the dragon and revives Dazai.\n\nFyodor slits Shibusawa's throat, allowing him to regain his lost memories, just as Atsushi looks within himself and resolves to open the white door within the fog. Atsushi remembers that when he was a child, he was tortured by Shibusawa to draw out his ability&nbsp;\u2013 the \"tiger\" and the antithesis of all special abilities. However, the torture backfired and Atsushi lost control of his ability from that point onwards, turning into a tiger and killing Shibusawa in the past. Despite this trauma, Atsushi accepts his actions and powers and recovers his tiger persona. Atsushi rushes to Shibusawa's base, his power having returned as the latter revives, stronger than ever, to battle Atsushi, Ky\u014dka and Akutagawa. Together, these three permanently defeat Shibusawa. Fyodor remains in the shadows, stating he has yet to accomplish his objective.\n\n==Production==\n\nThe film was initially intended to be an [[original video animation]], planned when the [[Bungo Stray Dogs (season 2)|second season]] of the TV series ended in 2016. [[Kadokawa Dwango]] was willing to make a film. A compilation film was suggested but creator Kafka Asagiri was willing to write a new script because he felt the fans deserved something better. The staff looked forward to the challenging dialogues and sought visuals which would captivate the fans. Some of the staff went to a campsite which posed difficulty in emailing Asagiri for confirmation. The main focus of the plot was on the characters Atsushi, Kyoka, and Akutagawa. [[Akira Ishida]], who played Fyodor, enjoyed how the character was explored with a larger role in the feature.<ref name=\"staff\">{{cite magazine|title=Spoon 2DI|publisher=Kadokawa|date=May 2018}}</ref> Atsushi's actor, [[Y\u016bto Uemura]], was surprised by the quality of the film's visuals, believing [[Bones (studio)|Bones]] had improved their work from the television series, while joking about how his character often repeated the name of his partner, Kyoka Izumi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/comic/news/272086|title=\u6620\u753b\u300c\u6587\u30b9\u30c8\u300d\u4e0a\u6751\u7950\u7fd4\u8a9e\u308b\u898b\u3069\u3053\u308d\u306f\u300c\u6566\u306e\u3044\u308d\u3093\u306a\u300e\u93e1\u82b1\u3061\u3083\u3093\u300f\u304c\u805e\u3051\u308b\u300d|publisher=Natalie|access-date=July 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710225732/https://natalie.mu/comic/news/272086|archive-date=July 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Uemura added that he felt honored to continue in the role due to its importance and impact on his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2106828/full/|title=\u4e0a\u6751\u7950\u7fd4&\u8af8\u661f\u3059\u307f\u308c\u3001\u300e\u6587\u8c6a\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30c3\u30b0\u30b9\u300f\u306e\u63a8\u3057\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u544a\u767d|publisher=Oricon|access-date=July 16, 2019}}</ref> The film's antagonist, Tatsuhiko Shibusawa, is loosely based on [[Tatsuhiko Shibusawa|the writer with the same name]]. His clothing and hair were made to give him a mysterious atmosphere. Production staff met with Sumiko Shibusawa, the wife of the real Shibusawa, for her approval of the artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://manga.tokyo/news/bungo-stray-dogs-dead-apple-introduces-new-character-tatsuhiko-shibusawa/|title=Bungo Stray Dogs Dead Apple Introduces New Character: Tatsuhiko Shibusawa|date=October 4, 2017 |publisher=Manga.Tokyo|access-date=July 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716023433/https://manga.tokyo/news/bungo-stray-dogs-dead-apple-introduces-new-character-tatsuhiko-shibusawa/|archive-date=July 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Bones staff went to a campsite retreat to work on the details of the production. They hoped to create a film with a high rewatch value, and intended to overwhelm the audience with the use of complex dialogue. They used the [[Apple (symbolism)|apple motif]] common in many fairy tales, myths and historical literature.<ref name=\"staff\"/> Asagiri conceived the idea of the story, starting with Dazai's death and how he would be revived across the story, though he wondered what the cause of death should be have been. Another idea for Dazai's characterization in the film was related to how he had previously treated the other characters.<ref>{{cite book|page=104|title=Dead Apple Official Guidebook: Mist Records|year=2018|isbn=978-4041066959|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten}}</ref> Original ideas that were not seen in the final product involved Sakanosuke Oda's legacy, with the late mafia member saving Atsushi through his ability to see the future. Atsushi's characterization and dynamic with Kyoka were altered in order to generate a bigger impact for the film's climax; Asagiri stated that this character arc helped to further progress the storyline. Nevertheless, while Atsushi becomes stronger across the film, Asagiri stated that the idea behind his character stayed true to his original persona of being a weak and relatable person. Shibusawa's action would have also generated a bigger impact in the original script, with the power of the supernatural mist he created changing the form of Yokohama.<ref name=\"guidebook\">{{cite book|pages=104\u2013105|title=Dead Apple Official Guidebook: Mist Records|year=2018|isbn=978-4041066959|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten}}</ref> The actions from Fyodor Dostoevsky confused director [[Takuya Igarashi]] due to the way Asagiri made the interactions with Dazai and Tatsuhiko Shibusawa, later noting that the film was quite different from other films due to its focus on mysteries such as how Dazai tried to stop Shibusawa by allying with him. Due to the impact of Chuya Nakahara's actions when confronting Dazai, Asagiri had to balance the script so that the trio of Atsushi, Kyoka and Akutagawa also have an important role.
