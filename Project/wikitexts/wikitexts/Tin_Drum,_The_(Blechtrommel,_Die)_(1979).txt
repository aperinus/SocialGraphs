It stars [[Mario Adorf]], [[Angela Winkler]], [[Daniel Olbrychski]], [[Katharina Thalbach]], [[Charles Aznavour]], and [[David Bennent]] in the lead role of Oskar Matzerath, a young boy who willfully arrests his own physical development and remains in the body of a child even as he enters adulthood.\n\nA [[Black comedy|darkly comic]] war drama with [[magical realist]] elements, the film follows Oskar, a precocious child living in [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]], who wields seemingly [[preternatural]] abilities. He lives in contempt of the adults around him and witnesses firsthand their potential for cruelty, first via the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] and then the subsequent [[World War II|war]]. The title refers to Oskar's toy drum, which he loudly plays whenever he is displeased or upset. The German-language film was a co-production of West German, French, and Yugoslavian companies.\n\nThe film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]] and was a major financial hit in West Germany, where it won the [[German Film Award for Best Fiction Film]]. It was received more controversially internationally, targeted by censorship campaigns in [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. Despite the notoriety, the film won [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[52nd Academy Awards|1980 Academy Awards]]. In 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' placed the film on its ''Best 1000 Movies Ever'' list.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film centres on Oskar Matzerath, a boy born and raised in the [[Free City of Danzig]] prior to and during [[World War II]], who recalls the story's events as an [[unreliable narrator]]. Oskar is the son of a half-Polish [[Kashubians|Kashubian]] woman, Agnes Bronski, who is married to a German chef named Alfred Matzerath but secretly carrying on an affair with Jan, a [[Polish Post Office (Danzig)|Polish Post Office]] worker and her cousin. The two men are great friends, but Alfred is blissfully unaware of his wife's infidelity. Oskar's parentage is uncertain; though he himself believes he is Jan's son.\n\nFlashbacks reveal his mother's conception by his grandfather Joseph Kolaizcek, a petty criminal in rural [[Kashubia]] (located in modern-day Poland). He hides underneath the skirts of a young woman named Anna Bronski. He has sex with her and she tries to hide her emotions, as the troops pass close by. She later gives birth to their daughter, who is Oskar's mother. Joseph evades the authorities for a year, but when they find him again, he either drowns or escapes to America and becomes a millionaire.\n\nIn 1927, on Oskar's third birthday, he is given a tin drum. Reflecting on the foolish antics of his drunken parents and friends, he resolves to stop growing and throws himself down the cellar stairs. From that day on, he does not grow at all. Oskar discovers that he can shatter glass with his voice, an ability he often uses whenever he is upset. Oskar's drumming also causes the members of a [[Nazi]] rally to start dancing. During a visit to the circus, Oskar befriends Bebra, a performing dwarf who chose to stop growing at age 10.\n\nWhen Alfred, Agnes, Jan and Oskar are on an outing to the beach, they see an eel-picker collecting eels from a horse's head used as bait. The sight makes Agnes vomit repeatedly. Alfred buys some of the eels and prepares them for dinner that night. When he insists that Agnes eat them, she becomes distraught and retreats to the bedroom. Jan enters and comforts her, all within earshot of Oskar who is hiding in the closet. She calmly returns to the dinner table and eats the eels. Over the next few days, she binges on fish. Anna Bronski helps reveal that Agnes is worried her pregnancy is due to her relations with Jan. In anger, Agnes vows that the child will never be born. She dies shortly thereafter, seemingly from the accumulated stress.\n\nAt the funeral, Oskar encounters Sigismund Markus, the kindly Jewish toy seller who supplies him with replacement drums, and who was also in love with Agnes. Markus is ordered by two of the mourners to leave because he is Jewish; Nazism is on the rise, and the Jewish and Polish residents of [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] are under increasing pressure. Markus later commits suicide after [[Kristallnacht|his shop is vandalized and a synagogue is burned down]] by [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] men.\n\nOn 1 September 1939, Oskar and Jan go looking for Kobyella, who can repair his drum. Jan slips into the Polish Post Office, despite a Nazi cordon, and participates in [[Defence of the Polish Post Office in Danzig|an armed standoff]] against the Nazis. During the ensuing battle, Kobyella is fatally shot and Jan is wounded. They play [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] until Kobyella dies and the Germans capture the building. Oskar is taken home, while Jan is arrested and later executed.\n\nAlfred hires sixteen-year-old Maria to work in his shop. Oskar seduces Maria, but later discovers Alfred having sex with her. Oskar bursts into the room, makes Alfred ejaculate inside her (when he was expected to pull out, to avoid getting her pregnant), causing Maria to become angry at Alfred when he blames Oskar for the inadvertent insemination.\n\nWhile rinsing her vagina in an attempt to remove the deposited semen, she and Oskar fight, and he hits her in the groin. She later gives birth to a son, who Oskar is convinced is his. Oskar also has a brief sexual relationship with Lina Greff, the wife of the local grocer and scoutmaster. It is implied that Lina was sexually frustrated as her husband preferred to spend more time with the [[Hitler Youth]] boys. Lina's husband later commits suicide (or is executed) after an official from the Nazi regime catches him 'playing' with those boys.\n\nDuring World War II, Oskar meets Bebra and Roswitha, another dwarf performer in Bebra's successful troupe. Oskar decides to join them, using his glass-shattering voice as part of the act. Oskar and Roswitha have an affair, but she is killed by artillery fire during the [[Allied invasion of Normandy]] while on tour.\n\nOskar returns home. Much of the city has been destroyed and the Russians are fast approaching. Oskar gives Maria's three-year-old son Kurt a tin drum like his own. The Russians break into the cellar where the family is hiding. Some of them gang-rape Lina. Alfred is killed by a soldier after swallowing and choking violently on his Nazi party pin. Later Matzerath's shop goes to Mariusz Fajngold, a Jewish survivor of [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] who also takes care of Alfred's funeral.\n\nDuring Alfred's burial, Oskar decides to grow up, and throws his drum into the grave. As he does, Kurt throws a stone at his head and he falls into the grave. Afterward, an attendee announces Oskar is growing again. The family, apart from Anna Bronski, [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|leave for the West]].\n\n== Cast ==\n\n<!-- - Main cast (11) per opening credits order - -->\n{{castlist|\n\n* [[David Bennent]] as Oskar Matzerath\n* [[Mario Adorf]] as Alfred Matzerath\n* [[Angela Winkler]] as Agnes Matzerath\n* [[Daniel Olbrychski]] as Jan Bronski\n* [[Katharina Thalbach]] as Maria Matzerath\n* [[Tina Engel]] as Anna Koljaiczek\n** [[Berta Drews]] as older Anna\n* [[Heinz Bennent]] as Greff\n* [[Ernst Jacobi]] as L\u00f6bsack\n* [[Andr\u00e9a Ferr\u00e9ol]] as Lina Greff\n* [[Charles Aznavour]] as Sigismund Markus\n* [[Fritz Hakl]] as Bebra\n* Mariella Oliveri as Roswina\n* Roland Teubner as Joseph Koljaiczek\n* Tadeusz Kunikowski as Uncle Vinzenz\n* [[Ilse Pag\u00e9]] as Gretchen Scheffler\n* Werner Rehm as Scheffler\n* Wigand Witting as Herbert Truczinski\n* [[K\u00e4te Jaenicke]] as Mother Truczinski\n* [[Helmut Brasch]] as Old Heilandt\n* [[Marek Walczewski]] as Schugger-Leo\n* [[Wojciech Pszoniak]] as Herr Mariusz Fajngold\n* [[Otto Sander]] as Meyn\n* Henning Schl\u00fcter as Dr. Hollatz\n* [[Zygmunt H\u00fcbner]] as Dr. Michon\n* [[Mieczys\u0142aw Czechowicz]] as Kobyella\n* [[G\u00fcnter Meisner]] as Herr Schrader\n* [[Stanis\u0142aw Michalski]] as Gendarme\n* [[Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]] as [[Rasputin]]\n* [[Beata Po\u017aniak]] as Woman in Street}}\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe film was mostly shot in West Germany including at the [[Spandau Studios]], with some street scenes, particularly ones concerning the landmarks of Danzig, shot on-location in [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland. The Polish communist authorities gave the crew little time in the country, since the novel itself had been banned in [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. While filming in Poland, a production assistant was arrested by the authorities when trying to buy eels from fishing boats for the beach scene, accused of attempting to sabotage the national industries.<ref>DVD commentary by Volker Schl\u00f6rndorff [concerns entire section]</ref> The scenes with the Polish Post Office were shot in [[Zagreb]], Croatia as were several generic street scenes. The scenes in France were shot on-set.\n\nSchl\u00f6ndorff was authorised{{clarify|date=June 2015}} by Grass himself during much of the preproduction and the writing of the script. David Bennent was chosen as the role of Oskar when Schl\u00f6ndorff was discussing with a doctor the possibility of a child whose growth stops at an early age, and the doctor brought up the case of the son of the actor [[Heinz Bennent]], whom Schl\u00f6ndorff was friends with. During the filming several difficulties arose: there was a supposed love affair between [[Daniel Olbrychski]] and [[Angela Winkler]], and a romantic rivalry between [[Fritz Hakl]], who played Bebra, and the fianc\u00e9 of [[Mariella Oliveri]], who played Roswitha.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n[[File:Blechtrommel (Tin Drum) showing, Lux-Harmonie=Heidelberg 1979.JPG|thumb|250px|''The Tin Drum'' cinema showing, Heidelberg 1979]]\n''The Tin Drum'' was one of the most financially successful German films of the 1970s, taking 25 million marks at the German box office.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> New World Pictures paid $400,000 for the U.S. rights<ref name=\"roger\">Roger Corman & Jim Jerome, ''How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime'', Muller, 1990 p 191</ref> and the film became the highest-grossing German film in the United States, with a gross of $4 million, beating the record set the year earlier by  [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Maria Braun]]''.<ref name=nat/>\n\nThe film presently holds a score of 84% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 25 reviews, with an average grade of 7.5/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_tin_drum/ |title=The Tin Drum |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=June 23, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film two stars (out of four), writing \"I must confess that the symbolism of the drum failed to involve me\":\n{{blockquote|And here we are at the central problem of the movie: Should I, as a member of the audience, decide to take the drum as, say, a child's toy protest against the marching cadences of the German armies?
