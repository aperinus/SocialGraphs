Its original cut performed poorly with test audiences, leading to the film undergoing a series of reshoots and edits. The finished film was distributed by [[Dimension Films]], who would go on to distribute the rest of the series until 2018's ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]''. It was released on September 29, 1995, grossing $15.1 million at the domestic box office on a budget of $5 million, and was panned by critics upon release. Donald Pleasence died on February 2, 1995, nearly eight months before the film was released. The film was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAfter the film's home media release, the original [[workprint]] of the film, which featured 45 minutes of alternative footage and a different ending, was discovered by [[Fan (person)|fans]] of the series. This version, dubbed the ''Producer's Cut'', developed a [[cult following]], with [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] [[DVD]] copies sold on [[eBay]] and [[online petition]]s targeting for an official release of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.joblo.com/arrow/reviews.php?id=407|work=Arrow in the Head|title=Halloween 6, The Producer's Cut|access-date=September 1, 2011|archive-date=December 18, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218144143/http://www.joblo.com/arrow/reviews.php?id=407|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2014, the ''Producer's Cut'' was officially released on [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/home-video/3303965/full-specs-halloween-complete-collection/|work=Bloody Disgusting|title=Full Specs For 'Halloween: The Complete Collection'!!|access-date= July 9, 2016|date=2014-07-21}}</ref>\n\n''Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers'' was followed by ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' in 1998, which does not contain any references to Jamie Lloyd storyline of the prior three films (although they were featured in the original script and comic book tie-ins published by [[Chaos! Comics]]), instead serving as a direct sequel to ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981).\n\n==Plot==\nOn October 31, 1989, [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] and his niece [[Jamie Lloyd]] are abducted from the Haddonfield Police Station by the Man in Black. Six years later, on October 30, 1995, a now fifteen-year-old Jamie gives birth to a child, and the Man in Black, revealed to be the leader of a [[Druid]]-like [[cult]], takes the child away. Later, Nurse Mary, a midwife, helps Jamie escape with her child, but Michael kills her. Jamie and her child flee in a stolen pick-up truck, with Michael in pursuit.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]] has retired and moved to a cabin on the outskirts of Haddonfield, where he lives as a hermit. He is visited by his friend Dr. Terence Wynn, the chief administrator of Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where Michael had been incarcerated as a boy; Wynn asks Loomis to return to Smith's Grove. They overhear Jamie's plea for help on a local radio station when she makes a call to Loomis, only to be ignored by the radio D.J. Barry Simms. Michael catches up with Jamie, and she crashes the truck into an old barn. He kills Jamie but finds that her child is not in the truck.\n\nIn Haddonfield, Tommy Doyle, whom [[Laurie Strode]] babysat in 1978, now lives in a [[boarding house]] run by an elderly woman named Mrs. Blankenship. Tommy is a reclusive individual who has become obsessed with finding the truth behind Michael's motives. The dysfunctional family living in the Myers house across the street are relatives of the Strode family: Kara Strode, her six-year-old son Danny, her teenage brother Tim, caring mother Debra, and abusive father, John. Danny is being tormented by the Man in Black who is grooming him to follow Michael's footsteps, leading him to almost use a knife on John during a heated argument between him and Kara during breakfast, the latter being slapped by her father.\n\nTommy finds Jamie's baby at the bus station, takes him to the hospital. There he runs into Loomis and tells him about the Strode family living in the Myers house. Tommy takes the baby back to his house where he names it Steven. Loomis goes to the Strode house and alerts Debra on Michael. While Debra starts to pack up belongings to leave, Michael shows up and kills her. Tommy runs into Danny on the street who is coming home from school and takes him home. Kara returns calling for Debra but is unable to find her. She comes across Tommy with Danny in Danny's room. Tommy takes them to the boarding house, where he reveals to Kara that he believes Michael has been inflicted with ''[[Thorn (letter)|Thorn]]'', an ancient Druid curse that causes him to kill his bloodline on Halloween night and believes that Jamie's baby will be Michael's final sacrifice.\n\nLater that night, Tommy meets Loomis at a Halloween party at a community college that Kara, Tim, and Tim's girlfriend Beth attend with a DJ, Barry Simms, as a special guest. Meanwhile, Mrs. Blankenship reveals to Kara that she was babysitting Michael the night he killed his sister and that Danny hears the same voice telling him to kill as Michael did, indicating the curse will pass on to Danny if Steven is killed. Shortly after, Michael kills John, Tim, Beth, and Barry Simms. Kara follows Danny back to the Strode house after he is summoned by the Man in Black. There she sees Michael and fights him off, then escapes with Danny back to boarding house where Tommy and Loomis are waiting. To their shock, the cult has arrived there with Mrs. Blankenship as an ally and the Man in Black is revealed to be Dr. Wynn. The cult drugs Loomis and Tommy and takes Kara, Danny, and Steven to Smith's Grove. Kara is locked in a maximum-security ward while the boys are kept in an operating room.\n\nTommy and Loomis awaken and go to Smith's  Grove. There Loomis confronts Wynn, who reveals that the Smith's Grove staff have been working with the Thorn cult to study the power of Thorn and learn how to control it. It is implied that Steven is the successful result of [[in vitro fertilization]] experiments to clone Michael's pure evil. Wynn wants Loomis to join in on his conspiracy, as he was the first to see the evil inside Michael. Loomis refuses and is knocked out by a doctor. Meanwhile, Tommy frees Kara as Michael pursues them through the sanitarium. They find Wynn and his team, who are about to perform a medical procedure on Danny and Steven. Michael suddenly appears and turns against Wynn and the doctors, killing them all.\n\nTommy and Kara rescue the kids, and Michael chases them into a laboratory, where Kara notices [[fetus]]es from Wynn's failed experiments. Tommy injects Michael with corrosives and beats him unconscious with a lead pipe. Tommy, Kara, and the children leave Smith's Grove while Loomis stays behind to take care of business. Inside, Michael's mask lies alone on the lab floor, and Loomis screams in the background, leaving their fates unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n{{Main|List of Halloween (franchise) characters|l1 = List of ''Halloween'' characters}}\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]]\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as [[List of Halloween (franchise) characters#Tommy Doyle|Tommy Doyle]] (credited as Paul Stephen Rudd)\n* [[Marianne Hagan]] as Kara Strode\n* [[Mitchell Ryan|Mitch Ryan]] as [[Dr. Terence Wynn]]\n* Devin Gardner as Danny Strode\n* [[J.

He claims that this was supposed to be more obvious, with flashbacks to the original film, but the development of the film resulted in many of those scenes being lost. Farrands says that he brought Tommy back as a way of bridging the gap between the sequels and the first film. His intent was for Tommy to be the successor to Dr. Loomis, to act as a \"voice of sanity...a kind of modern [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]], the fearless Michael hunter!\", a role he believed was missing from ''H20'' and ''[[Halloween: Resurrection|Resurrection]]''.<ref name=\"Farrands\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_Dan.htm|title=Daniel Farrands interview|publisher=Icons of Fright|year=2005|access-date=2008-06-01}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Kara's fate varied in various script drafts. In the first draft, Kara is murdered by her son Danny in the Haddonfield Bus Depot, while the near final draft had the film ending with Tommy and Kara driving away. The film as released ends with Kara and Tommy driving off with the children, Danny and Stephen.\n\nFarrands describes Michael as a \"[[Paraphilia|sexual deviant]]\". According to him, the way Michael follows girls around and watches them contains a subtext of [[Sexual repression|repressed sexuality]]. Farrands theorizes that, as a child, Michael became fixated on the murder of his sister Judith, and for his own twisted reasons felt the need to repeat that action over and over again, finding a sister-like figure in Laurie who excited him sexually. He also believes that by making Laurie Michael's literal sister, the sequels took away from the simplicity and relatability of the original ''Halloween''. Nevertheless, when writing ''Curse'', Farrands was tasked with creating a mythology for Michael which defined his motives and why he could not be killed. He says, \"He can't just be a man anymore, he's gone beyond that. He's mythical. He's supernatural. So, I took it from that standpoint that there's something else driving him. A force that goes beyond that five senses that has infected this boy's soul and now is driving him.\" As the script developed and more people became involved, Farrands admits that the film went too far in explaining Michael Myers and that he himself was not completely satisfied with the finished product.<ref name=\"Farrands\"/>\n\n====Allusions and references====\nFarrands, a long-time fan of the series, sought to incorporate various references and [[allusion]]s to the previous ''Halloween'' films, particularly the original, to play with the \"''Halloween'' mythology.\"{{sfn|Farrands|Howarth|2014|loc=event occurs at 49:30}} These range from situational allusions, such as Tommy Doyle living across the street from the Strode house (a play on the events in the original ''Halloween'', which take place between the Wallace and Doyle residences, which are across the street from one another){{sfn|Farrands|Howarth|2014|loc=event occurs at 49:25}} to minor references, such as the naming of an address from ''Halloween II'' (1981), and the character of Mrs. Blankenship, a name referred to in passing in ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' (1982).{{sfn|Farrands|Howarth|2014|loc=event occurs at 43:10}} Other references outside the narrative diegeses of the series include the names of characters, such as John and Debra Strode (referencing John Carpenter and [[Debra Hill]]),{{sfn|Farrands|Howarth|2014|loc=event occurs at 41:18}} as well as the naming of Danny Strode, a character Farrands has said was modeled after [[Danny Torrance]] in ''[[The Shining (1980 film)|The Shining]]'' (1980).\n\nFarrands also referenced Carpenter's ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980) with the line referring to a \"stomach pounder\" (a protein milkshake Tim drinks early in the film),{{sfn|Farrands|Howarth|2014|loc=event occurs at 41:35}} and Beth's murder scene was modeled after a scene from [[Fred Walton (director)|Fred Walton]]'s ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' (1979) (Farrands wrote the scene upon hearing that Walton had been attached to direct the project, though Walton would eventually drop out of the production).{{sfn|Farrands|Howarth|2014|loc=event occurs at 1:09:27}} Additionally, extended scenes of Kara walking on the college campus and en route to her home were intended to allude to scenes featuring Laurie Strode in the first film,{{sfn|Farrands|Howarth|2014|loc=event occurs at 37:10}} while Danny dropping his [[pumpkin]] while walking home alludes to a scene in the first film in which a group of bullies force Tommy to drop his pumpkin outside the elementary school.{{sfn|Farrands|Howarth|2014|loc=event occurs at 48:28}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Donald Pleasence Allan Warren edit.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Donald Pleasence]] reprised his role as Dr. Loomis, in what would be one of his final film appearances.]]\n[[File:Paul Rudd (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|right|The adult Tommy Doyle was portrayed by [[Paul Rudd|Paul Stephen Rudd]], in what would be one of his first film appearances.]]\n[[Donald Pleasence]] returned to play [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Loomis]], in what would be one of his final film performances; according to Farrands, Pleasence was fond of the script.{{sfn|Farrands|Howarth|2014|loc=event occurs at 14:09}} [[Danielle Harris]], who was seventeen at the time, contacted producer Paul Freeman about reprising her role as [[Jamie Lloyd]], and went so far as completing paperwork to become [[Emancipation of minors|legally emancipated]] in order to shoot the film.<ref name=harris>{{cite AV media|title=Jamie's Story|work=Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers: The Producer's Cut|medium=Blu-ray documentary short|publisher=Scream Factory|year=2014|people=Harris, Danielle}}</ref> She was officially cast in the role,{{sfn|Farrands|Howarth|2014|loc=event occurs at 2:38}} but Dimension Films could not come to an agreement over her salary; Harris alleges that Dimension offered her a [[Pay scale|scaled]] $1,000 to shoot the part over the course of a week, which was less than the amount of money she had paid for her emancipation.<ref name=harris/> Farrands and Freeman both had wanted Harris for the part, but at that point \"had their hands tied.\"<ref name=harris/>\n\nAccording to Harris, the head of the casting department refused to negotiate her salary, stating that she was a \"scale character who dies in the first twenty minutes.\"<ref name=harris/> This ultimately led to her dropping out of the project.<ref name=\"halloween25\">{{cite video\n  | people = [[Danielle Harris|Harris, Danielle]]; [[Marianne Hagan|Hagan, Marianne]]\n  | title = Halloween: 25 Years Of Terror \n  | medium = Documentary\n  | section = ''Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers''\n  | publisher = Anchor Bay Entertainment\n  | year = 2006 }}</ref> \"People automatically assume I wanted some crazy amount of money, or something,\" Harris commented in 2014, \"[but] it's not like I [was] demanding of anything, really ...

Wynn conducts a ceremony in which Michael will kill Steven as a final sacrifice of innocent blood, after which the curse will pass on to Danny with Kara as his first sacrifice. Kara realizes that Steven is a product of [[incest]] between Jamie and Michael,<ref name=pc/> and uses this to try to convince Michael not to kill the baby. Tommy holds Wynn hostage, forcing the cult to free Kara, and they run with the children through the sanitarium until they reach a locked gate.  Tommy uses the power of the ancient [[rune]]s to stop Michael in his tracks, and Loomis helps the group escape. Later, after telling the others he has unfinished business, Loomis walks back into the sanitarium to find Michael lying on the floor of the main hallway. Upon removing the mask, Loomis finds Dr. Wynn, with whom Michael switched clothes and then escaped. Wynn dies, but not before saying \"It's your game now, Dr Loomis\", and passing on the Thorn symbol, which appears on Loomis' wrist; realizing that he himself is now to act as the leader of the cult, Loomis screams in both despair and disgust (this is heard as [[ambient noise]] in the final frame of the theatrical cut).\n\nAnother substantial difference in ''The Producer's Cut'' is the death of Jamie Lloyd: she does not die at the beginning of the film, but survives being stabbed by Michael in the barn. She remains in a [[coma]] and is taken to the hospital, where Loomis and Wynn visit her. Midway through the film, a \"Gothic\" [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] occurs, which reveals in fragmented detail the conception of Jamie's child among the cult. After the sequence, an unseen person, later revealed to be Wynn, shoots the unconscious Jamie in the head with a silenced pistol.<ref>[[#CITEREFArmstrong2003|Farrands & Howarth 2014]] (0:55:09)</ref> Additionally, John's death scene in ''The Producer's Cut'' was shorter; in the theatrical cut, an additional shot (completed during the reshoots) was incorporated of his head graphically exploding from an electrical power surge.<ref>[[#CITEREFArmstrong2003|Farrands & Howarth 2014]] (1:05:09)</ref> Other various transitional shots throughout ''The Producer's Cut'' version were extracted or truncated in the theatrical cut.<ref name=pc/>\n\n''The Producer's Cut'' remained officially unreleased for nearly 20 years.
