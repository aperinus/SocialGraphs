The film tells the story of a deranged German surgeon who kidnaps three tourists and joins them surgically, mouth to [[human anus|anus]], forming a \"human [[centipede]]\". It stars [[Dieter Laser]] as Josef Heiter, the creator of the centipede; and [[Ashley C. Williams]], [[Ashlynn Yennie]], and [[Akihiro Kitamura]] as his victims.\n\nAccording to Six, the concept arose from a joke he had made with friends about punishing a [[child sexual abuse|child molester]] by stitching his mouth to the anus of a \"fat truck driver\". Another source of inspiration was [[Nazi human experimentation|Nazi medical experiments]] performed during [[World War II]], such as those performed by [[Josef Mengele]] at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. When approaching investors to fund the project, Six did not mention the premise of the film for fear of putting off potential backers; financiers did not discover the full nature of the film until completion.\n\nThe film held its premiere at the [[London FrightFest Film Festival]] on 30 August 2009. It received a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States on 30 April 2010. Despite a mixed critical reception, the film won several accolades at international [[film festival]]s. Two sequels that were also written and directed by Six\u2014''[[The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)|Full Sequence]]'' and ''[[The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)|Final Sequence]]''\u2014were released in 2011 and 2015, respectively. The entire trilogy was combined into a single film in 2016, titled ''Complete Sequence'', which Six described as a \"movie centipede\" due to each ''Sequence'' leading into its successor while simultaneously working as a separate standalone film.\n\n== Plot ==\nLindsay and Jenny, a couple of American tourists from [[New York City|New York]] visiting Germany for a trip, are drugged with [[Rohypnol]] and kidnapped by a [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]], [[psychopathic]] [[surgeon]] Dr. Josef Heiter when they seek help at his house after they get a flat tire on their way to a night club. The women awaken in a makeshift medical ward. They witness Heiter kill a kidnapped truck driver (from the beginning scene) after Heiter informs him he is \"not a match\". Heiter secures a captive, Japanese tourist Katsuro. The doctor explains that he is a world-renowned expert at separating [[Siamese twins]], but dreams of making new creatures by sewing humans together. He describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-[[anus]], so that they share a single [[Digestion|digestive system]]. Heiter also explained his experiences with his prior experiment, the 3Dog, in which he conjoined his three [[Rottweiler]]s into a \u201cSiamese triplet.\u201d Following the unsatisfactory results when all three of his conjoined dogs expired after the operation, Heiter then decided to move on to using human subjects for the current experiment based on the 3Dog experiment, hoping to achieve better results.\n\nAfter Lindsay tries to escape and fails, Heiter explains to her how one of his dogs attempted to escape the surgery like she did, and decides to make her the middle part of the [[centipede]], the most painful position, as punishment. Heiter performs the surgery, placing Katsuro at the lead, Lindsay at the middle and Jenny at the rear; he removes both the upper and lower front teeth and lips of Lindsay and Jenny, and mutilates the buttocks of Katsuro and Lindsay to provide access to the [[rectum]]s; a U-shaped section of skin from jawline to cheek is removed from both Lindsay and Jenny, to which he [[Graft (surgery)|grafts]] the skin from the buttocks of Lindsay and Katsuro respectively. He severs the [[ligaments]] of his victims' knees to prevent leg extension, forcing his victims to crawl. Each victim in the centipede is half-naked, where Katsuro and Lindsay are provided bottoms covered in bandages for healing purposes while Jenny is provided with underwear. All three segments' knees are bandaged for healing and for them to be able to crawl. Lindsay is joined with a strip of bandage to the buttocks of Katsuro and Jenny is joined with a strip of bandage to the buttocks of Lindsay, joining their mouths to the anus of the person in front of them.\n\nOnce the operation is complete, Heiter is delighted and thrilled with his creation and takes the centipede to his living room to wake each segment of the centipede up, takes photos of each of them, and even passes a mirror around for the segments of the centipede to marvel at their new form. Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet by caging the centipede in a [[Dog-kennel|dog kennel]], letting Katsuro eat [[dog food]] at dinner, and often belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a [[Crop (implement)|crop]] when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro defecates after apologizing to the girls, Lindsay is forced to [[Coprophagia|swallow his excrement]] while the doctor watches in delight and desperation. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of a caged Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak, but in Japanese) and by the constant moaning of the women. When the centipede attempts to escape while Heiter is swimming, all three segments of the centipede are beaten with the crop. Heiter is displeased with the realization that Lindsay is [[constipated]]. He proposes that he will use [[Laxative|laxatives]] on Lindsay, so that she will [[Explosive Diarrhea|explosively defecate]] into Jenny's mouth, and thus be forced to eat the feces of her best friend. However, before he can do this, he discovers that Jenny is dying from [[sepsis]] during a checkup (suggesting that Lindsay may have already defecated into her mouth off-camera, which led to infection).\n\nWhen a couple of detectives, named Kranz and Voller, visit the house to investigate the disappearance of the three tourists, Heiter comes up with an idea to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four-segment centipede. He offers the detectives water spiked with Rohypnol in hopes of knocking the detectives unconscious. After being given the drugged water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a [[search warrant]] for his home.\n\nWhen the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then takes his own life by slitting his throat with a glass shard.\n\nUpon returning to Heiter's home, the detectives forcefully conduct separate searches as Heiter, injured, hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the ward along with Heiter's victims. Voller begins to feel ill from the earlier drugging, and Heiter stabs him with the [[scalpel]] pulled from his foot during Katsuro's attack. Upon finding Voller dead, Kranz is shot by Heiter with Voller's sidearm. Kranz responds by fatally shooting Heiter in the head before succumbing to his wounds. Back in the house, Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies. Lindsay sobs as she is left alone in the house, trapped between her deceased fellow captives. Her fate is left unknown. The film ends with the sounds of her sobbing while the camera pans to the roof of the house.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:10.1.10HumanCentipedeByLuigiNovi cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Stars [[Ashlynn Yennie]], [[Ashley C.
