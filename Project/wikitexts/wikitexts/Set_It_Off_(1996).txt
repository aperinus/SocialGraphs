Additionally, the singles \"Set It Off\", \"[[Don't Let Go (Love)]]\", \"[[Days of Our Livez]]\", \"[[Angel (Aretha Franklin song)|Angel]]\", \"[[Come On (Billy Lawrence song)|Come On]]\", \"[[Let It Go (Ray J song)|Let It Go]]\" and \"[[Missing You (Brandy, Gladys Knight, Tamia, and Chaka Khan song)|Missing You]]\" each charted.\n\n== Plot ==\nFrancesca \"Frankie\" Sutton (Fox) is a [[Los Angeles]] bank teller who is fired after a robbery, because she recognized one of the robbers, although she did not personally know him. Frankie goes to work at Luther's Janitorial Services with her three best friends, Lida \"Stony\" Newsom (Pinkett), Cleopatra \"Cleo\" Sims (Latifah), and Tisean \"T.T.\" Williams (Elise). The owner, Luther, treats them with disrespect and pays them paltry wages.\n\nTired of working a low-paying job, Cleo explains that they should rob a bank themselves. Frankie agrees, but Stony and T.T. are reluctant. However, after Stony's younger brother is gunned down by the police in a case of mistaken identity and T.T.'s son is taken away from her by [[Social services|Child Protective Services]], they too now have the motivation to join the robbery.\n\nWhile casing a bank with T.T., Stony meets bank manager Keith Weston, whom she starts dating. The four women embark on a series of successful bank robberies, due to Frankie's inside knowledge of bank protocol with money and security. An investigation by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective Strode ensues. Strode suspects that Cleo (because of her prior convictions), Frankie (because of her inadvertent connection to the earlier robbery and subsequent firing) and Stony (because of her brother's death) are involved. But his superior refuses to allow him to bring them in for questioning because he doesn't feel the evidence is sufficient.\n\nConcerned with the safety of their money, the four women stash the money in an air vent at one of their work sites. However, when Cleo, Frankie, and T.T. show up for work one day and find a new boss in charge, they quickly realize that Luther has discovered the money and fled with it. While Stony attends a banking event with Keith, the three women track Luther to a motel, where he is sleeping with a prostitute.\n\nThe women demand the return of their money, but Luther refuses to give it up and pulls a gun on Cleo, forcing T.T. to shoot him dead in self-defense. Stony is disappointed with Frankie and T.T. about the missing money and Luther's death. Frankie and Cleo persuade T.T. and Stony that they need to rob another bank and leave town the next day.\n\nThe women decide to rob the Downtown Federal bank, where Keith works. Concerned for Keith's safety and not wanting him to know she's a bank robber, Stony calls Keith and tells him to meet her at a cafe, far from the bank's location. The four women quickly execute the robbery, but Cleo demands that T.T. grab more money, which gives Strode enough time to arrive.\n\nStrode and his partner try to talk them into surrendering. As T.T. and Stony begin to put down their weapons, a bank security guard shoots T.T. A shootout ensues as Stony shoots the guard, and an enraged Cleo opens fire on the detectives. The women eventually drive away, though T.T. succumbs to her wounds and dies in Stony's arms. The three remaining women attempt to outrun the police in vain. Cleo tells Stony and Frankie that they have to split up and to take her share of the money with them.\n\nThe police find Cleo who proceeds to lead them on a high speed chase until she is cornered. She drives through a police barricade, which causes the police to shoot at her car and blow out her tires. Refusing to surrender, she leaps from her car firing her gun, and is killed by the police. Frankie is found a short time later, and Strode attempts to get Frankie to surrender. After defiantly sticking a gun in Strode's face and reminding him of how he got her fired to begin with, Frankie attempts to run, but one of the officers shoots her in the back, killing her. Stony, who managed to blend in with a tourist group heading to Mexico, tearfully watches this from a passing charter bus. Strode sees her from a distance but lets her go, realizing the part he played in driving the women to crime.\n\nIn Mexico, Stony mourns the losses of her friends and brother, and cuts off her hair. She then calls Keith to assure him that she is alright and thanks him before smiling. After hanging up, she is seen driving through the mountains with her share of the money from the last robbery beside her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] as Lida \"Stony\" Newsome\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Cleopatra \"Cleo\" Sims\n* [[Vivica A.

Gary Gray's film ''Set It Off'' is one of the most poignantly impassioned,\" and that \"[i]f this messy roller coaster of a film often seems to be going in several directions at once, it never for a second loses empathy\" for the female robbers.<ref name=\"Holden\">{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=Set It Off (1996): Just Trying to Get Even While They Get Rich|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 6, 1996|access-date=October 9, 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F02E3D81338F935A35752C1A960958260}}</ref>\n\n[[James Berardinelli]] said that if ''Set It Off'' owes any debt to films, those films are ''Thelma & Louise'' and ''[[Dead Presidents]]'', rather than ''Waiting to Exhale.'' He stated that \"[t]here's a freshness and energy in the way director F. Gary Gray attacks this familiar material that keeps ''Set It Off'' entertaining, even during its weakest moments\" and that \"[t]he concept of four black action heroines makes for a welcome change in a genre that is dominated by: (a) rugged white males with a perpetual five o'clock shadow, (b) rugged white males who speak English with an accent, and (c) rugged white males with the acting ability of a fence post.\" Berardinelli added that although \"[t]he film doesn't get off to a promising start\" and \"[t]he first half-hour, which details the various characters' motives for becoming involved in a bank robbery, is unevenly scripted,\" and that some aspects of the plot are contrived, \"[o]nce the setup is complete, however, things shift into high gear. The remainder of the film, which includes several high-adrenaline action sequences and some slower, more dramatic moments, is smoothly-crafted. There are occasional missteps, such as an out-of-place ''Godfather'' parody, but, in general, ''Set It Off'' manages to rise above these.\"<ref name=\"Berardinelli\">{{cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James|title=Set It Off|publisher=reelviews.net|date=1996|access-date=October 9, 2014|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/set_it.html}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Set It Off: Music From the New Line Cinema Motion Picture\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = September 24, 1996\n| recorded   = December 1995&ndash;July 1996\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n| length     = 61:23\n| label      = [[East West Records]]\n| producer   = Various artists\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Set It Off: Music From the New Line Cinema Motion Picture\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Missing You (Brandy, Gladys Knight, Tamia, and Chaka Khan song)|Missing You]]\n | single1date = August 6, 1996\n | single2     = [[Don't Let Go (Love)]]\n | single2date = October 22, 1996\n | single3     = [[Days of Our Livez]]\n | single3date = September 24, 1996\n | single4     = [[Let It Go (Ray J song)|Let It Go]]\n | single4date = January 7, 1997\n}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}} [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r241055|pure_url=yes}} link]\n| noprose = yes\n}}\nThe soundtrack was released on September 24, 1996, by [[East West Records]] and featured production from several of hip hop and R&B's top producers, such as [[Organized Noize]], [[DJ U-Neek]] and [[DJ Rectangle]].
