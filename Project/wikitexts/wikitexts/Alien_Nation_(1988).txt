O'Bannon]] and directed by [[Graham Baker (director)|Graham Baker]]. The ensemble cast features [[James Caan]], [[Mandy Patinkin]], and [[Terence Stamp]]. Its initial popularity inaugurated the beginning of the ''[[Alien Nation]]'' media franchise. The film depicts the assimilation of the \"Newcomers\", an alien race settling in [[Los Angeles]], much to the initial dismay of the local population. The plot integrates the [[neo-noir]] and [[buddy cop film]] genres with a science fiction theme, centering on the relationship between a veteran police investigator (Caan) and an extraterrestrial (Patinkin), the first Newcomer detective. The duo probe a criminal underworld while attempting to solve a homicide.\n\nThe film was a co-production between American Entertainment Partners and [[20th Century Fox]], which distributed it theatrically. ''Alien Nation'' explores murder, [[discrimination]] and [[science fiction]].\n\n''Alien Nation'' was released in the United States on October 7, 1988, and grossed over $32 million worldwide, becoming a moderate financial success. The film was met with mixed critical reviews before its theatrical release, although it has since gained a [[cult film|cult following]]. The motion picture spawned a short-lived [[Alien Nation (TV series)|television series]], [[Alien Nation (TV series)#Television movies|five television films]], a set of [[Alien Nation (comics)|comic books]], as well as a number of [[Alien Nation (novel series)|novels]], all in an attempt to continue the character development surrounding its fictional alien culture.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1991\u2014three years after a spaceship landed in the [[Mojave Desert]] bearing 300,000 enslaved alien Newcomers, who now live in [[Los Angeles]]\u2014police detective Matthew Sykes loses his partner in a shootout while trying to stop two Newcomer criminals from murdering another Newcomer. Sykes's superior, Captain Warner, informs his squad that they will have to work with the newly promoted Newcomer detective Sam Francisco.  Sykes volunteers to work with Francisco to investigate the [[homicide]] of a Newcomer named Warren Hubley, hoping he will also find opportunities to investigate his partner's death (which he is officially forbidden to do).\n\nWhile at a crime lab, Francisco detects an abnormality on the body of one of the Newcomer criminals who was killed in the robbery. This leads Sykes and Francisco to a nightclub to question a Newcomer named Joshua Strader, but Strader is murdered by a criminal ring led by Newcomer businessman William Harcourt and his henchman Rudyard Kipling.\n\nHarcourt is in the advanced stages of launching a scheme to exploit the Newcomers by mass-producing a drug called Jabroka, which was used to pacify Newcomers when they were slaves, but has no effect on humans. The abnormality noticed by Francisco on the body of the Newcomer criminal turns out to be a visual sign of the drug's influence. The Newcomers Hubley, Porter, and Strader were involved in the planning phases of the operation, but were later murdered due to Harcourt's desire to exclude them from any future financial rewards. Ultimately, Sykes and Francisco track down Harcourt, who is negotiating a timetable for the release of Jabroka. The detectives are led on a car chase with Harcourt and Kipling through the streets of downtown Los Angeles. Following a head-on collision where both parties are injured, Harcourt attempts an escape on foot. Sykes pursues and corners Harcourt onto a desolate drawbridge. Harcourt then purposely overdoses on a sample of Jabroka.\n\nHarcourt is presumed dead, but later mutates into a significantly larger, more muscular, and more violent Newcomer. The duo pursue Harcourt, catching up with him near a fishing pier. Sykes later ends up in a physical confrontation with Harcourt in the open sea. Harcourt's body disintegrates due to direct contact with salt water, which is hazardous to Newcomer physiology. Francisco commandeers a police helicopter and rescues Sykes from the water. Sykes and Francisco, now friends, attend Sykes's daughter's wedding together.  Sykes asks Francisco to forgive him for all the stupid things he will do and say in the years to come, and Francisco reassures Sykes it'll be all right, after all Sykes is only human.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[James Caan]] as Matthew Sykes\n* [[Mandy Patinkin]] as Sam Francisco (\"George\")\n* [[Terence Stamp]] as William Harcourt\n* [[Kevyn Major Howard]] as (Rudyard) Kipling\n* [[Leslie Bevis]] as Cassandra\n* [[Peter Jason]] as Fedorchuk\n* [[George Jenesky]] as Quint\n* [[Jeff Kober]] as Joshua Strader\n* [[Roger Aaron Brown]] as Bill Tuggle\n* Tony Simotes as Wiltey\n* Michael David Simms as Human Dealer\n* Ed Krieger as Alien Dealer\n* [[Tony Perez (actor)|Tony Perez]] as Alterez\n* [[Brian Thompson]] as Trent Porter\n* [[Francis X.

O'Bannon]]'s original screenplay for ''Alien Nation'' was submitted as a [[Spec script|spec\u2013script]] to producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]]. The agency representing the storyline asked the production staff to view it as quickly as possible due to it also being submitted to other film studios. Both Hurd and her director of development Ellen Collett had the same initial response, seeing the script as a real page-turner. According to Hurd, what really interested her about the film's story was the whole approach to the immigrant setting and the extrapolation of that to a science fiction setting. The genre of science fiction, in regards to representing aliens, tends to usually be in the form of one or two beings as shown on network series like ''[[Star Trek]]''. Typically, large numbers of stand-ins were not common in film since ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' twenty years earlier. Working with co-producer Richard Kobritz, Hurd secured funding from Fox Studios and began casting an experienced makeup team for the creation of the alien society.<ref name=\"Planetful\">Magid, Ron (November 1988). [http://www.cinefex.com/backissues/issue36.html A Planetful of Aliens] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325192438/http://www.cinefex.com/backissues/issue36.html|date=March 25, 2010}}. ''[[Cinefex]]''. pp. 4\u201317. Riverside, California. Retrieved March 14, 2010.</ref>\n\nLater, Hurd contacted cinematographer [[Adam Greenberg (cinematographer)|Adam Greenberg]] at his home in Israel to work on the production. Caught by surprise, Greenberg recalled, \"I was vacationing on the Dead Sea in a kibbutz (it was 125 degrees) and I got a call from Gale. That was the last thing to expect there.\"<ref name=\"Nation\" />\n\nThough mostly an action movie, ''Alien Nation'' was somewhat of a throwback to other similar genre films such as ''Planet of the Apes''  and ''[[Silent Running]]''. The alien ''Newcomers'' are relegated to a second-class status. Like other minorities, they live in their own neighborhoods, frequent their own clubs, and develop their own underground. Following the murder of a policeman, a human must partner up with an alien to solve the murder. Their uneasy alliance creates a social mistrust, dealing with issues such as prejudice and racism. By the end of the saga, the two completely different humanoids have combined their talents and overcome their social barriers to complete their task.<ref name=\"Planetful\" />\n\n===Makeup===\n{{quote box  |align=right |width=30em |bgcolor=#c6dbf7\n|quote =We wanted the aliens to be more like a different ethnic race than like lizard people, ... We didn't want our audiences thinking, 'Gee, look how different these aliens are.' Rather, after about five minutes we wanted the audience to accept them as different from us, but not ''so'' different that no one is buying the storyline. We wanted the aliens to be characters\u2013not creatures.\n|source = \u2014Gale Anne Hurd<ref name=\"Planetful\" />\n}}\n\nAlthough several makeup effects companies were considered, 20th Century Fox chose [[Stan Winston|Stan Winston Studios]]. Winston was not directly involved in the pre-production, but left the task to his top artists\u2013Alec Gillis, [[Shane Mahan]], John Rosengrant, Tom Woodruff, and Shannon Shea. Producer Gale Anne Hurd commented on creating the foundation for the makeup setting saying, \"The primary problem was how to sell an alien race that was humanoid without making it look like people in rubber suits\u2014and how to make it affordable. We knew there was going to be a lot of makeup application time and removal time\u2014that was a given.\" Artist Gillis recalled his involvement in the project saying, \"We were involved in everything from designing and sculpting the aliens to supervising a crew of about thirty people. We sculpted the main characters, supervised the molding and production of their appliances and oversaw the sculpting of the secondary and background characters.\" During the design phase, the producers supported the subtlety of the makeup and trying to make the aliens look as human as possible.\n\nA preliminary design sketch for the aliens as described by Mahan, was that \"the males were going to have spines on top of their heads\u2013kind of like a rooster's comb\u2013and when they got angry, these spines would raise up. That would've required a mechanical headpiece, and Graham Baker thought it was a little too extreme so we went with smooth heads instead.\" Coming close to a final design for the headpiece makeup, Woodruff explained how the masks had \"heavier brows and a heavier skin texture that looked more leathery, and there were more pronounced lumps on the backs of their heads. After we went into production on these masks, Graham Baker decided that he wanted the aliens to look even more subtle, so we streamlined the design once we started doing the principal characters.\"\n\nMike Spatola was head of the painting crew for the mask design. Hairless by design, the coordinators felt the masks should have spotted marks where hair would be present on humans. Each alien headpiece had to be custom painted with a spotting pattern to match every backup secondary piece used for individual characters. Each of the actors who played aliens also had their hands painted in a spot pattern, as an original plan of supplying them with appliances for hand pieces was discarded.<ref name=\"Planetful\" />\n\n[[File:DHorizonmakeup.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|left|[[Alien Nation (1989 TV series)|''Alien Nation'' television series]] actors [[Eric Pierpoint]] and [[Michele Scarabelli]] wearing applied headpiece makeup in 1994; similar in scope to the ones utilized in the film.]]\n\nAfter the generic alien concept was finalized, each of the effects coordinators worked with a specific actor. Mahan chose to work with Mandy Patinkin, as well as Francisco's son. Rosengrant worked with Leslie Bevis who played Cassandra. Woodruff worked on Terence Stamp who played the part of Harcourt.<ref name=\"Planetful\" /> In trying to emphasize the uniqueness of the  characters, Mahan commented, \"We wanted the audience to be able to recognize the actors immediately. They were all so good, it would have been a shame to cover them up completely.\"<ref name=\"Planetful\" /> Other effects coordinators like Gillis remarked, \"The actor who played Trent Porter, for example\u2013Brian Thompson\u2013was a really rugged guy, so he came off looking like a really tough character. On the other hand, Kevyn Major Howard\u2013who played Harcourt's murderous henchman\u2013had very delicate, boyish kind of features, so we used that quality to create a creepy juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"Planetful\" /> While effects coordinators were struggling to finish the final design and full-scale production of the alien prosthetics, Hurd chose makeup artist [[Zoltan Elek]] to supervise the overall application.<ref name=\"Planetful\" /> Elek had previously worked on the film ''[[Mask (1985 film)|Mask]]'' and the character ''[[Max Headroom (character)|Max Headroom]]''.<ref name=\"Planetful\" /> Elek insisted that the alien coloration be much more closer to human skin tones rather than the originally chosen yellowish pigment. Elek recalled his disagreement with Winston as Stan felt, \"...{{nbsp}}the aliens should be a totally different color than the humans, with a lot of yellows, blues and grays. To me, that scheme was too monstrous\u2013in fact, we ended up using it on the Harcourt monster at the climax.\"<ref name=\"Planetful\" /> Another creative aspect of the makeup was the gradation between the principal and background masks. The crew of ''Alien Nation'' sought to avoid the same mistakes made in ''Planet of the Apes'' twenty years earlier. As explained by Gillis, \"We had what we referred to as 'A-B-C-D' makeups, ... The 'A' makeups were those custom designed for the principal actors, while the 'B' makeups were mix-and-match where we would recombine pieces from other actors to create a new character. Our 'D' masks\u2013the ones furthest from camera\u2013were overhead slip latex masks ''incapable'' of changing expression. The 'C' masks, however, were made of foam latex and could be glued down to get some expression from the characters in the middleground.\"<ref name=\"Planetful\" /> Application of the Newcomer makeup known as ''\"spuds\"'' or ''\"potatoheads\"'' on set, required four hours; a task which Patinkin described as being \"a pain in the ass.\"<ref name=\"Sam\" /> Masks were manufactured in a production line to meet the enormous demand for the film. Mahan mused, \"We would pull the pieces out of the oven, fix them up, paint them and have them ready for pickup that afternoon to be taken to the set. The pieces were barely cold when Zoltan and his crew applied them.\"<ref name=\"Planetful\" />\n\nFor the final dramatic scene involving Harcourt's demise, the rigged effects were handled in two stages. The first stage involved a dissolving head and body, while the second stage incorporated a flesh-less arm thrusting out of seawater. Rosengrant noted, \"While the dissolving makeup had to look extreme, it also had to appear realistic within the limits of the alien anatomy Winston's crew had designed. We wanted to avoid the amorphous 'blob-of-blood' look you see in so many of these slasher and monster pictures. We wanted to be able to see Harcourt's bone structure rather than just the glob hanging off of it.\" For the visual appearance he added, \"Of course, we did use [[Methyl cellulose|methocel slime]] to make it wet and nasty-looking, but the basic understructure was rooted in anatomy.\" For Harcourt's facial disintegration, the coordinators came up with a foam rubber base makeup superimposed with a layer of gelatin appliances. Elek explained, the crew \"dug out chunks from the foam rubber pieces, filled the holes with Bromo Seltzer, then laid the gelatin appliances over the whole thing and colored them so you could not see the holes below. Once the stuntman, the camera and everyone else was in position, we took a large syringe filled with hot water and injected it into each of the Bromo Seltzer pockets as the camera started rolling. As the Bromo Seltzer started to fizzle, the hot water began eating its way through the gelatin skin and his face appeared to bubble and melt.\" In the end, Mahan remarked, \"We figured that going from something like the alien queen in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' to these straight prosthetic makeups would be simple, but it was really a lot of work.\"<ref name=\"Planetful\" />\n\n===Set design and filming===\n[[File:ANationTypog.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|right|Tenctonese typography resembling a rhythmic heartbeat pattern.]]\n\nNumerous interior and exterior locations used to suit the needs of the story were filmed in [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref name=\"Los\">Turner, George (September 1988).

The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters.<ref name=\"Los\" /> Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew \"came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them,{{nbsp}}...\" while also mentioning how they \"brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with.\"<ref name=\"Los\" /> The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs.<ref name=\"Los\" /> Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down, the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties.<ref name=\"Los\" /> Collis recalled how the alien language resembled \"a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph.

The film took some of its concept from the TV series ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]'', with science fiction elements integrated in the plot.<ref name=\"Planetful\" /> During production, the film had a working title called, ''Outer Heat'', which essentially was an amalgam of ''In the Heat of the Night'' and a 1960s science fiction TV series, ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''.<ref name=\"Planetful\" /> Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a ''\"space epic\"'' but more of an action film.<ref name=\"Los\" /> He admitted, \"We did build a spaceship, but it's a simple thing that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society.

The Encounters Club was one of those places.\" Greenberg used [[Arri]]flex cameras and [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] lenses along with [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] stock. Commenting on film grain he said, \"I figured out from tests that it is better for me to use Fuji. Once film is blown up to 70mm the grain will stand out more and Fuji has smaller grain than [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]]. I can control the contrast with light, but I have to live with the grain.\" Making use of multiple cameras, Greenberg noted, \"Photographically, of course, one camera is best. But as a movie maker, and because I want the film to be a success, I realize that the photography is not the most important thing. The whole movie is most important. So in pre-production, I was the one pushing the director to always shoot with two or three cameras.\"<ref name=\"Nation\" />\n\nLighting challenges were abound for Greenberg as most of the film took place at night. One of the simplest techniques for lighting employed by Greenberg was using a car's headlights to dramatically produce a scene of terror. Greenberg explained, \"We had a scene on Zuma Beach where the bad guys are dragging somebody into the ocean. I wanted to have a very hard, but very natural, and strong look. So, I used the car headlights. It was nice because everything behind the villains fell into darkness. It had a surrealistic look.\" Greenberg also remarked how he had a close working relationship with DeLuxe lab in getting the correct color for the extensive night shooting in the film by bluntly saying, \"In a movie like this I wanted the blacks to be very black, so I worked closely with DeLuxe lab{{nbsp}}...\" He felt the daily challenges of night shooting visibly enhanced the appeal of ''Alien Nation'' by figuratively mentioning, \"as a cameraman, you can create a lot more at night. Sometimes you have to feel your way. You also have true control at night. If a light is on it is because you turned it on.\"<ref name=\"Nation\" />\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Alien Nation: Music Inspired by the Film\n| type       = film\n| artist     = [[Jerry Goldsmith]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 2005\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 46:43\n| label      = Var\u00e8se Sarabande\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe score for the film was originally composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], but later rejected in favor of music composed by Curt Sobel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/112031/Curt-Sobel/filmography |title=Curt Sobel Filmography |access-date=March 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102065310/http://movies.nytimes.com/person/112031/Curt-Sobel/filmography |archive-date=November 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> Goldsmith's score was however used for the film's theatrical trailer.<ref name=\"Varese\" /> Musical artists [[Smokey Robinson]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Mick Jagger]] and [[David Bowie]] among others, contributed songs which appear in the film.<ref name=\"movies.yahoo.com\"/> The audio soundtrack in [[Compact Disc]] format composed by Sobel was never officially released, but a limited edition of the original score initially composed by Goldsmith featuring 18 tracks, was released in 2005.

The Newcomers have no surprises.\" Regarding the fictional alien culture, he expressed disappointment saying \"a feeble attempt is made to invest the Newcomers with interest, by having them get drunk on sour milk instead of booze, and depriving them of any sense of humor.\" However, on a slightly complimentary note, Ebert mentioned \"the makeup took trouble, the photography looks good, the cast and technical credits are top-drawer.\" But overall, he summed it up by declaring \"''Alien Nation'' feels like a movie made by people who have seen a lot of movies, but don't think the audience has.\"<ref name=\"ebert\"/> In agreement with Ebert over the originality of the buddy cop genre with the aliens inserted in as just a new rendition, Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, \"''Alien Nation'' wants to be ''In the Heat of the Night'' as science fiction, but it's neither morally instructive nor prophetic. It proves a lumbering marriage of action and sci-fi that alienates both audiences. It's too dull for one and too dumb for the other.\" Kempley did find the first half hour to be suspenseful, though: \"...{{nbsp}}well paced, brawny and intense, looks like it was made by another director.
