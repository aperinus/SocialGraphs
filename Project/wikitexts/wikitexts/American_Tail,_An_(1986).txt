It tells the story of Fievel Mousekewitz and his family as they emigrate from Russia to the United States for freedom. However, he gets lost and must find a way to reunite with them.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on November 21, 1986, by [[Universal Pictures]], four months after Disney's ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' was released. It received mixed-to-positive reviews and was a box office hit, making it the highest-grossing non-[[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated film at the time. Its success, along with that of fellow Bluth film ''[[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]'' and Disney's ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (both 1988), and Bluth's departure from their partnership, prompted executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] to establish his own animation studio, [[Amblimation]], in London, England.\n\nThe film spawned a [[An American Tail (franchise)|franchise]] that included a sequel, ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'' (1991); a [[CBS]] TV series based on the movie, ''[[Fievel's American Tails]]'', premiered in 1992, and two additional [[direct-to-video]] sequels set between the first two films, ''[[An American Tail: The Treasure of Manhattan Island]]'' (1998) and ''[[An American Tail: The Mystery of the Night Monster]]'' (1999).\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\n\nIn [[Shostka]], [[Russian empire|Russia]], in the winter of [[1885]], the Mousekewitzes, a [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] family of mice who live with a human family named Moskowitz, are having a celebration of [[Hanukkah]] where Papa gives his hat to his 7-year-old son, Fievel, and tells him about the United States, a country in which he believes there are no cats. The celebration is interrupted when a battery of [[Cossack]]s ride through the village square in an [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|anti-Jewish]] arson attack and their cats attack the village mice. Because of this, the Moskowitz home, along with that of the Mousekewitzes, is destroyed, while Fievel has a narrow escape from the cats. They flee the village in search of a better life.\n\nIn [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], the Mousekewitzes board a [[tramp steamer]] setting sail for [[New York City]]. All the mice aboard are ecstatic at the process of going to America believing that there are \"no cats\" there. During a thunderstorm on their journey, Fievel suddenly finds himself separated from his family and washed overboard. Thinking that he has died, they proceed to the city as planned, though they become depressed at his loss.\n\nHowever, Fievel floats to New York City in a bottle and, after a pep talk from a French pigeon named Henri, embarks on a quest to find his family. He is waylaid by [[Confidence trick|conman]] Warren T. Rat, who gains his trust and then sells him to a [[sweatshop]]. He escapes with Tony Toponi, a street-smart Italian mouse, and they join up with Bridget, an Irish mouse trying to rouse her fellow mice to fight the cats. When a gang of them called the [[Mott Street]] Maulers attacks a mouse marketplace, the immigrant mice learn that the tales of a cat-free country are not true.\n\nBridget takes Fievel and Tony to see Honest John, an alcoholic (but reliable) politician who knows the city's voting mice. However, he can't help Fievel search for his family, as they have not yet registered to vote. Meanwhile, his older sister, Tanya, tells her gloomy parents that she has a feeling he is still alive, but they tell her to let go of these feelings as it doesn't seem possible that Fievel could still be alive.\n\nLed by the rich and powerful Gussie Mausheimer, the mice hold a rally to decide what to do about the cats. Warren is extorting them all for protection that he never provides. No one knows what to do about it, until Fievel whispers a plan to Gussie. Although his family also attends, they stand well in the back of the audience and they are unable to recognize Fievel onstage with her.\n\nThe mice take over an abandoned museum on the [[Chelsea Piers]] and begin constructing their plan. On the day of launch, Fievel gets lost and stumbles upon Warren's lair. He discovers that he is actually a cat in disguise, and the leader of the Maulers. They capture and imprison Fievel, but his guard is a reluctant member of the gang, a goofy, soft-hearted long-haired orange vegetarian tabby cat called Tiger, who befriends and frees him.\n\nFievel races back to the pier with the cats chasing after him and exposes Warren as a cat when Gussie orders the mice to release the secret weapon. A huge mechanical mouse, inspired by the bedtime tales Papa told Fievel of the \"Giant Mouse of [[Minsk]]\", chases Warren and his gang down the pier and into the water. A tramp steamer bound for [[Hong Kong]] picks them up on its anchor and carries them away. However, a pile of leaking [[kerosene]] cans has caused a torch lying on the ground to ignite the pier, and the mice are forced to flee when the human [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] arrives to extinguish it.\n\nDuring the fire, Fievel is once again separated from his family and ends up at an orphanage. Papa and Tanya overhear Bridget and Tony calling out to Fievel, but Papa is sure that there is another \"Fievel\" somewhere, until Mama finds his hat.\n\nJoined by Gussie, Tiger allows them to ride him in a final effort to find Fievel and they are successful. Papa returns Fievel's hat, commenting that it now fits him and he has grown up into a mouse. Henri ends the journey by taking everyone to see his newly completed project\u2014the [[Statue of Liberty]], which appears to smile and wink at Fievel and Tanya, and the Mouskewitzes' new life in the United States begins.\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Phillip Glasser]] as Fievel Mousekewitz. While \"Fievel\" is a generally accepted spelling of his name, the opening credits spell it as \"Feivel\", the more common transliteration<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Feivel |title=Feivel \u2013 Name Meaning, What does Feivel mean? |publisher=Think Baby Names |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=feivel |title=Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Feivel |publisher=Behind the Name |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref> of the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] name (\u05e4\u05bf\u05f2\u05b7\u05f0\u05dc ''Fayvl'') (Cf. [[Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz]] and [[Philip Berg|Feivel Gruberger]]). The main protagonist, he is the seven-year old only son of Papa and Mama Mousekewitz. A high-spirited, daring yet na\u00efve Russian-Jewish mouse, Fievel becomes a frightened child when he is separated from his family. The strength and the encouragement from his new American friends from Henri to Tony and Bridget give him the fortitude to reach his goal in reuniting with his family while starting a new life in America. Fievel was the same name of Steven Spielberg's grandfather, whose stories as an immigrant influenced the movie (the ending credits spell his name as \"Fievel\"). However, many English-speaking writers have come to adopt the spelling ''Fievel'', especially for this character; it was this spelling that was used on the film's poster, in promotional materials and tie-in merchandise, and in the title of the sequel ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]''. His last name is a play on the Jewish-Russian last name \"Moskowitz\", the name of the human occupants of the house his family is living under in the beginning of the film. \n* [[John Finnegan (actor)|John Finnegan]] as Warren T. Rat, a small [[Havana Brown]] who disguises himself as a rat. Leader of the Mott Street Maulers, an all-cat gang which terrorizes the mice of New York City. Conniving and a schemer, he misleads the gullible Fievel at one point. Later on, he gets his comeuppance when Fievel discovers and later exposes him as a cat to the Mouse community. He is accompanied everywhere by his accountant Digit, a small English-accented [[cockroach]].\n* Amy Green as Tanya Mousekewitz (singing voice provided by Betsy Cathcart), Fievel's 8-year-old older sister, whom he mutually adores. Optimistic and cheerful, less daring but more obedient than her brother, she alone believes (correctly) that he survived being washed overboard en route to the United States. She is given the American name \"Tillie\" at the immigration point at [[Castle Garden]].\n* [[Nehemiah Persoff]] as Papa Mousekewitz, the head of the Mousekewitz family who plays the violin and tells stories to his children.\n* [[Erica Yohn]] as Mama Mousekewitz, Fievel's mother. Countering Papa's dreamy idealism, she is a level-headed pragmatist, besides being stricter with their offspring than he is. She also has a fear of flying.\n* [[Pat Musick]] as Tony Toponi, a streetwise teenage mouse of Italian descent. His \"tough guy\" attitude suits his New York surroundings. The name \"Toponi\" is a play on \"topo\", the Italian word for \"mouse\". He hits it off with Fievel, acting as a surrogate big brother to the younger mouse, whom he calls \"Philly\". In a subplot, He falls in love with Bridget.  \n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Tiger, the most physically imposing member of the Mott Street Maulers, whom he serves as an enforcer, and often as the brunt of their cruel jokes. This bushy-tailed, orange long-haired [[tabby]] stands 3 feet tall on his rear legs. Although not especially intelligent, Tiger is very friendly, and his warm nature endears him to mice and birds. He is mostly vegetarian, aside from the occasional bit of fish. He enjoys card games like [[poker]] and [[gin rummy]], despite being terrible at them. Tiger's voice also helps him stand out; he sings bass and baritone, from D2 or E2 to F4 or G4.\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Henri le Pigeon, a [[pigeon]] of French descent, who oversees construction of the [[Statue of Liberty]].\n* Cathianne Blore as Bridget, an attractive, elegant Irish-born mouse and Tony's significant other. Her parents were slain and devoured by the Mott Street Maulers, making her an advocate in speaking out against the cats. Kind, passionate yet soft-spoken, she acts as a surrogate big sister to Fievel.\n* [[Neil Ross]] as Honest John, a local Irish-born mouse politician who knows every voting mouse in New York City. An ambulance-chasing drunkard, he takes advantage of voters' concerns to increase his political prestige. John is a caricature of the 19th-century [[Tammany Hall]] politicians.\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Gussie Mausheimer, a German-born mouse considered to be the richest in New York City, who rallies the mice into fighting back against the cats.\n* [[Will Ryan]] as Digit, Warren's British cockroach accountant who has a fondness for counting money, but is plagued by frequent electrical charges in his antennae whenever he gets nervous or excited.\n* [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as Moe, a fat rat who runs the local sweatshop. Fievel is sold to him by Warren.\n* [[Dan Kuenster]] as Jake, Warren's burly [[aide-de-camp]]. Among the Mott Street Maulers, he alone enjoys listening to his leader's violin music. Jake catches Fievel after a chase through the sewers. After Tiger takes pity on Fievel and sets him free, Jake and his fellow Maulers pursue the young mouse to the [[Chelsea Piers|Chelsea Pier]], only to face the \"Giant Mouse of Minsk\".\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Steven Spielberg by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] in 2017]]\nProduction began in December 1984 as a collaboration between Spielberg, Bluth, and Universal, based on a concept by David Kirschner. Originally, the idea was conceived as a television special, but Spielberg felt it had potential as a feature film.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|pp=84\u201385}} Spielberg had asked Bluth to \"make me something pretty like you did in ''[[The Secret of NIMH|NIMH]]''...make it beautiful\". In a 1985 interview, he described his role in the production as \"first in the area of story, inventing incidents for the script, and now consists of looking, every three weeks to a month, at the storyboards that Bluth sends me and making my comments\". Bluth later commented that \"Steven has not dominated the creative growth of ''Tail'' at all. There is an equal share of both of us in the picture\". Nevertheless, this was Spielberg's first animated feature, and it took some time for him to learn that adding a two-minute scene would take dozens of people months of work. In 1985 he stated: \"At this point, I'm enlightened, but I still can't believe it's so complicated\".{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=91}} It was Universal Pictures' first animated feature film since ''[[Pinocchio in Outer Space]]'' in 1965 and the first animated film that they co-produced.\n\n=== Writing ===\nOriginally, the concept consisted of an all-animal world, like Disney's ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', but Bluth suggested featuring an animal world existing as a hidden society from the human world, like his own ''NIMH'' and Disney's ''[[The Rescuers]]''. After viewing ''The Rescuers'', Spielberg agreed. Emmy Award-winning writers Judy Freudberg and Tony Geiss (known for their work on ''[[Sesame Street]]'') were brought in to expand the script. When the initial script was complete, it was extremely long and was heavily edited before its final release. Bluth felt uncomfortable with the main character's name, thinking \"Fievel\" was too foreign-sounding, and he felt audiences wouldn't remember it.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=92}} Spielberg disagreed. The character was named after his maternal grandfather, Philip Posner, whose Yiddish name was Fievel. The scene in which he presses up against a window to look into a classroom filled with American \"school mice\" is based on a story Spielberg remembered about his grandfather, who told him that Jews were only able to listen to lessons through open windows while sitting outside in the snow.<ref>{{cite book |last=McBride |first=Joseph |title=[[Steven Spielberg]]: A Biography |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=1997 |pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Spielberg eventually won out, though something of a compromise was reached by having Tony refer to Fievel as \"Filly\".{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=92}} Spielberg also had some material cut that he felt was too intense for children, including a scene Bluth was developing revolving around wave monsters while the family was at sea.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=95}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nBluth described the process of voice casting as \"sometimes you can select a 'name' voice [i.e., a well-known actor] because it fits the essence of the character so well. Other times, you need to seek an obscure voice, close your eyes, and just listen to it. If it has the highs and lows in the deliverance of lines and it captures the focus of the character, it allows the animators to get a true fix on the action.\"{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=93}} \n* Glasser (Fievel) was discovered by accident when Bluth and his crew overheard him auditioning for an [[Oscar Mayer]] commercial.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=93}} \n* Green (Tanya Mousekewitz) was a young actress who had done some previous television series work and several commercials.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=93}} \n* Persoff, a respected actor in many films, was chosen to play the part of Papa Mousekewitz mostly because he had a similar role as [[Barbra Streisand]]'s father in ''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]''.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=93}} \n* Yohn (Mama Mousekewitz) has appeared in many features, but her work as a Russian [[Names of the Romani people|gypsy]] on a TV show attracted the attention of Bluth and John Pomeroy.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=93}} \n* Finnegan won the role of Warren T. Rat by reciting excerpts of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' in the voice of a [[Brooklyn]] taxi driver. This idea inspired the writers to make Warren a pretentious illiterate who continually misquoted Shakespeare.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=93}} \n* Musick (Tony Toponi) is one of a small number of women in animation chosen to voice a male character. She based his voice on a friend she knew from grade school.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=93}} \n* DeLuise (Tiger) had worked previously with Bluth in ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'', and DeLuise even added material to the script at various points. During the song \"A Duo\", he suggested they stop the music where the lyrics mention \"back scratch\" and have Fievel actually scratch Tiger's back.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=93}} \n* Henri was originally to be voiced by comedian [[Sid Caesar]], and was conceived as scraggly and worn, but later Plummer was cast for the part and Henri was drawn with a more dignified look. Bluth felt Henri was an essential character to act as a voice for the statue \"welcoming\" Fievel to the new world.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=92}}\n* Kahn was chosen to play the part of Gussie Mausheimer with the hopes that she would use a voice similar to the one she used as a character in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=92}}\n\nWill Ryan (Digit), Neil Ross (Honest John), Cathianne Blore (Bridget), and Hal Smith (Moe) are all voice actors well known in the animation industry.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=93}}\n\n=== Design ===\nIn designing the look of the film and its characters, Bluth worked with Amblin Entertainment and the [[Sears]] marketing department (Sears had a major marketing push on the main character). He decided to make a stylistic shift from the more angular \"modern style\" of animation of the time to a style similar to Disney animation from the 1940s, where the characters have a more soft and cuddly feel. This proved successful, and at release many critics praised the \"old fashioned style\" of the film's look and feel.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=92}} This was during a period when the market for nostalgia was particularly strong among baby boomers,<ref>{{cite book |author=Grimes, William |title=[[The New York Times]]: The Times of The Eighties. The Culture, Politics and Personalities that Shaped the Decade (from a November 29, 1989 article in ''The New York Times'' \"The Past Is Now The Latest Craze\" by Randall Rothenberg) |publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal |year=2013 |page=184 |isbn=978-1579129330}}</ref> who at this time were seeking products for their young children, and only three years before the beginning of the [[Disney Renaissance]] for the studio Bluth once worked for.\n\n=== Animation ===\nBluth preferred to storyboard an entire picture, but it soon proved to be an enormous task. Larry Leker was brought in to assist, turning Bluth's rough sketches into final storyboard panels. Bluth commented that he would then \"send them over to [Spielberg]. Often I brought them over myself, so that I could explain them. Steven would get very excited by what he saw, and we'd edit the boards right there...adding more drawings, or trimming some back\". A large crew of animators was pulled together from around the world, utilizing cel painters in Ireland. Discussion arose about moving the entire production to Ireland, but Spielberg balked at the idea of a story called ''An American Tail'' being produced overseas.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nAt this time, Bluth and his crew discovered that using a [[Xerography|video printer]] greatly increased their productivity. They could videotape an action, then print out small black and white thermal images from the tape for reference for both human and animal characters, a shorthand method similar to the [[Rotoscope|rotoscoping]] technique (called in fact [[xerography]]) used since the earliest days of animation, in which sequences are shot in live action and traced onto animation cels. They also utilized the process of building models and photographing them, particularly the ship at sea, and the \"Giant Mouse of Minsk\",{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=93}} a technique also used in many Disney films.\n\n=== Production difficulties ===\nDuring production, Amblin and Universal expected to view the dailies and approve all major work on the film, and various outside parties also requested changes here and there. The production buckled under the excessive oversight, and Bluth felt that he was losing freedom of control over the production process. As the release deadline approached, pressure grew among the crew and numerous problems arose, ranging from slower-than-expected cel painting in Ireland to low footage output by some animators. Also, the songwriters had written the score much later than originally desired. Suddenly scenes had to be dropped to save time and money and new, shorter scenes had to be created to help pick up the story points lost in the process, sometimes making the story line look jumbled. Notable cuts include the Mousekewitzes' journey across Europe, a scene in which they first meet Tiger and he gets stuck up in a tree, an upbeat song that Fievel was planned to sing while imprisoned in the sweatshop, and a scene that gave greater explanation of the changing of names at [[Ellis Island]]. Cuts are also responsible for baby Yasha's apparent disappearance after the boat trip.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=94}}\n\nThe film was also plagued by union difficulties. Bluth had agreed to accept $6.5&nbsp;million to get it produced (which later grew to $9&nbsp;million), at a time when Disney was spending around $12&nbsp;million per film. He knew it would be difficult, but felt it was worth the sacrifice to work with Spielberg on a major project. With the agreement of his employees, salaries were frozen for a year and half. Unlike the former Bluth studios, the new Sullivan Bluth studios were non-union, and when many workers attempted to withdraw from the union, it sparked a battle between Bluth and the union that continued through most of production. It was mostly this struggle that later compelled Bluth to relocate to Ireland, which he felt offered a more supportive atmosphere.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=97}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=\"There is no way you could put a score like this in any other kind of film. It would only work in animation or if I wrote a ballet. I loved doing it.\"|source=\u2014[[James Horner]]{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=95}}}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = An American Tail: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = November 21, 1986<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/American-Tail-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000002PF9/ |title=James Horner \u2013 An American Tail: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack |website=Amazon.com |access-date=October 20, 2015}}</ref> <br /> February 11, 2019 (expansion)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theseconddisc.com/2019/02/soundtrack-watch-intrada-american-tail-la-la-land-zimmer-legrand/ |title=Soundtrack Watch: Intrada Expands 'An American Tail,' La-La Land Releases Scores by Zimmer and Legrand |website=The Second Disc |date=February 19, 2019}}</ref>\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length       = 49:04 (original release)<br />78:28 (2019 expansion)\n| label        = [[MCA Records]] (1986)<br />[[Geffen Records]] (2013)<br />[[Intrada Records]] (2019)\n| producer     = [[James Horner]]\n| chronology   = [[Don Bluth]] Music of Films\n| prev_title   = [[The Secret of NIMH]]\n| prev_year    = 1982\n| next_title   = [[The Land Before Time (film)|The Land Before Time]]\n| next_year    = 1988\n| misc         = {{Singles\n | name        = An American Tail: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Somewhere Out There (James Horner song)|Somewhere Out There]]\n | single1date = 1986\n}}\n}}\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}} [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000192797|pure_url=yes}}]\n|rev2 = [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]]\n|rev2score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.filmtracks.com/titles/american_tail.html |publisher=Filmtracks |access-date=October 20, 2015 |title=Filmtracks: An American Tail (James Horner)}}</ref>}}\n\nSpielberg's original vision for the film was as a musical. It is said he wanted a \"[[Heigh-Ho]]\" of his own (referring to the popular song from Disney's ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'').{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=94}} [[Jerry Goldsmith]] who had worked on ''The Secret of NIMH'' with Bluth was initially supposed to work on the score, but had to drop out of the film due to a busy schedule. After he completed ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', [[James Horner]] composed the score for the film, which was recorded in England and performed by [[The London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|Choir of King's College]]. Two excerpts of period music also appear in the film: ''[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]'' by [[John Philip Sousa]] and ''Poor Wand'ring One'' from the 1880 comic opera ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. There is also a musical reference to the 1947 song ''[[Galway Bay (song)|Galway Bay]]'' popularized by [[Bing Crosby]]. Initially Bluth and his team were disappointed with the first score recording, but once edited, they found the music worked quite well.
