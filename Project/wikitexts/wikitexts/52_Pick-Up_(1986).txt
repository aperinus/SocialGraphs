One day, Harry is confronted by three hooded blackmailers who demand $105,000 per year for a videotape of him and his mistress, a young stripper named Cini. Because of his wife's political aspirations he cannot go to the police; however, guilt eventually drives him to confess, and she kicks him out of their bedroom. \n \nHarry's stubborn inclination is to not surrender to the threats, and when his lawyer advises him that the blackmailers will never leave him alone, he refuses to pay. The trio kidnap Harry and force him to watch a video of Cini being murdered with a gun stolen from his house. They demand $105,000 a year for the rest of Harry's life in exchange for their silence. Harry, however, vows to get revenge.\n\nUsing deduction and his business contacts, Harry tracks down and confronts Alan Raimy, the leader of the blackmailers and an amateur adult filmmaker. Knowing he has a background in accounting, Harry shows Raimy his financial records, which indicate that the majority of his wealth is tied up and he can't afford $105,000. Raimy agrees to accept Harry's offer of $52,000 instead, at least as a first payment. However, Raimy also breaks into Harry's house posing as an insurance salesman and subtly threatens Barbara.\n\nThrough Doreen, a stripper who was friends with Cini, Harry learns the names of the other blackmailers: the sociopathic Bobby Shy and the cowardly Leo. He first makes Raimy suspicious by suggesting Leo gave up his name; Bobby, realizing the truth, violently interrogates Doreen but believes her when she says she didn't give him away. That night he breaks into the Mitchell house and tries to kill Harry, but Harry and Barbara overpower him. Harry realizes Raimy kept the revised deal to himself and tells Bobby as much before letting him go.\n\nLeo, cracking under the pressure, confesses everything to Harry, saying he never wanted to hurt Cini and that both her body and the videotape have been disposed of. He also warns him that Raimy and Bobby will kill him and Barbara after the payment is made, since he knows who they are. Bobby later confronts Leo, who is planning to leave town, and kills him. Meanwhile, Raimy kidnaps Barbara and sedates her with drugs, to ensure Harry delivers the $52,000. He lures Bobby and Doreen to a warehouse and kills both of them before going to meet Harry.\n\nHarry exchanges the money for Barbara, telling Raimy that if anything happens to them, his lawyer will send Raimy's fingerprints (from the financial records) to the police. Raimy had previously expressed interest in Harry\u2019s sports car, so Harry offers it as a getaway vehicle. When Raimy turns the ignition key the doors lock, trapping him inside; the car then explodes in a ball of fire.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roy Scheider]] as Harry Mitchell\n* [[Ann-Margret]] as Barbara Mitchell\n* [[Vanity (singer)|Vanity]] as Doreen\n* [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] as Alan Raimy\n* [[Clarence Williams III]] as Bobby Shy\n* [[Lonny Chapman]] as Jim O'Boyle\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Cynthia \u201cCini\u201d Frazier\n* [[Robert Trebor]] as Leo Franks\n* [[Doug McClure]] as Mark Arveson\n* [[Tom Byron]] as Party Goer  \n* [[Randy West (actor)|Randy West]] as Party Goer\n* [[Ron Jeremy|Ron Jeremy Hyatt]] as Party Goer\n* [[Amber Lynn]] as Party Goer  \n* [[Sharon Mitchell]] as Party Goer\n* [[Jamie Gillis]] as Party Goer\n\n== Production ==\nTomorrow Entertainment first acquired the rights to Elmore Leonard's novel ''52 Pick-Up'' in 1972 and planned to begin filming an adaptation on January 1, 1973. However, the film was placed in turnaround and eventually acquired by [[The Cannon Group, Inc.]] in 1974, whose co-chairmen [[Menahem Golan]] and [[Yoram Globus]] changed the setting from [[Detroit]] to [[Tel Aviv]] and the identity of the blackmail victims to the family of the U.S. Ambassador to Israel. This version of the film, ''[[The Ambassador (1984 American film)|The Ambassador]]'', was released in 1984. After John Frankenheimer read the book, he obtained permission from Golan and Globus to direct a more faithful adaptation. Filming was originally going to begin on April 9, 1986, in [[Pittsburgh]], which was meant to stand in for the novel's original setting of Detroit. However, the filming and setting was moved to Los Angeles in order to save budgetary costs. The Mitchells' home was filmed in [[Hancock Park, Los Angeles|Hancock Park]], while other scenes were filmed in [[Vine Street]] and [[Santa Monica Boulevard]].<ref name=\"afi\" />\n\n==Release==\n''52 Pick-Up'' opened in New York and Los Angeles on November 7, 1986.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web|url=http://afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=57319|publisher=American Film Institute|access-date=July 12, 2016|title=52 Pick-Up|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003182054/http://afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=57319|archive-date=October 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The film was distributed by the Cannon Group.<ref name=\"afi\" /> It debuted poorly at the box office.<ref>{{cite web |last=Friendly |first=David T.  |date=November 13, 1986 |title=Reagans on 'Soul Man': Thumbs Up - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-13/entertainment/ca-25214_1_soul-man |access-date=2012-08-23}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nPatrick Goldstein, writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', described the film as \"a dull, plodding thriller that finds Mitchell in a deadly war with a trio of crazed blackmailers.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Movie Review: '52 Pickup': Film Noir Idea Gone Gray|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-07/entertainment/ca-15561_1_film-noir|newspaper=LA Times|date=7 November 1986|last=Goldstein|first=Patrick}}</ref> On the other hand, [[Roger Ebert]], writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', claimed it \"provides us with the best, most reprehensible villain of the year and uses his vile charm as the starting point for a surprisingly good film. ...
