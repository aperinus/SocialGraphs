The film is about unlikely fraternal twin brothers ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Danny DeVito]]) who were separated at birth. The core of the film is the contrast between the [[Know-how|streetwise]] Vincent (DeVito) and the intelligent but naive Julius (Schwarzenegger).\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing $216 million worldwide.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> Instead of taking their usual salaries for the film, Schwarzenegger, DeVito and Reitman agreed with the studio to take 40% of the film's box office returns; this resulted in them receiving the biggest paychecks of their film careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://nerdist.nerdistind.libsynpro.com/arnold-schwarzenegger |title= Schwarzenegger Interview \u2013 Interview/Podcast (starting at 42 min)|publisher=nerdist.com |access-date=2014-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nJulius and Vincent Benedict are twin brothers, the result of a secret experiment carried out at a genetics laboratory to combine the [[DNA]] of six fathers to produce the perfect child. To the surprise of the scientists, the embryo split and the twins were born. The mother, Mary Ann Benedict, was told that Julius died at birth, and not told about Vincent at all.\n\nVincent was placed in an orphanage run by nuns in [[Los Angeles]] and believed his mother abandoned him. With no one but himself to rely on, Vincent seduced a nun, escaped from the [[orphanage]], and later became an indebted, small time criminal. Julius was raised on a [[Oceania|South Pacific]] island by Professor Werner, one of the scientists from the experiment, who put him through intense physical training and extensive study. Both believed Mary Ann died during childbirth.\n\nEach twin was unaware of the other's existence. On Julius' 35th birthday, Werner finally tells Julius about Vincent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/t/twins-script-transcript-schwarzenegger.html |title=Twins Script \u2013 Dialogue Transcript |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |access-date=2013-05-20}}</ref> With Werner's blessing, Julius proceeds to Los Angeles to find his brother. Julius eventually tracks Vincent down in jail, where he is being held for unpaid parking tickets and driving with an expired license.\n\nJulius bails Vincent out, but Vincent does not believe his story and abandons him in a parking lot. Julius pursues Vincent to his workplace and finds him being beaten up by Morris Klane, one of three loan shark brothers that Vincent owes $20,000. Julius subdues Morris, earning Vincent's trust and respect. He later meets Vincent's girlfriend Linda Mason and enters a romantic relationship with her twin sister Marnie.\n\nOver dinner, Vincent shows Julius a document he stole from the orphanage that shows their mother is still alive, but believing that she abandoned him at birth, Vincent shows no interest in finding her. Believing that their mother may have also been lied to, Julius tracks one of their six fathers to the address on the document. The father directs Julius to Dr. Mitchell Traven, Werner's colleague, in [[New Mexico]].\n\nVincent steals a late model Cadillac from a parking garage run by his buddy (to sell to a chop shop) and finds a prototype fuel injector in the trunk that was to be delivered to industrialist Beetroot McKinley in Houston, in return for $5 million. Vincent decides to pose as the delivery man, Mr. Webster, and deliver the fuel injector himself so he can collect the money and pay off his debts. He reluctantly allows Julius, Linda and Marnie to accompany him to New Mexico to find Traven, while Webster begins pursuing Vincent. In the process, he encounters the Klane brothers and shoots them in the legs as a warning to keep away from Vincent.\n\nIn New Mexico, Traven reveals the truth to the twins, pointing out that Julius resulted from the best genes, and spitefully denouncing Vincent as having come from the \"useless\" genetic material, leaving Vincent distraught. After Julius threatens him, Traven directs them to Santa Fe, where their mother lives in an art colony. Julius convinces Vincent to regain his spirits and they continue their journey.\n\nOn the way to Santa Fe, the twins are accosted by the Klane brothers, but they fight them off for the last time. At the art colony in Santa Fe, a gardener informs Julius and Vincent that their mother has died. They leave, unaware that the gardener was in fact Mary Ann, who did not believe their story, having been told she only had one son who died at birth.\n\nAbandoning Julius and the girls in New Mexico, Vincent heads to Houston alone to deliver the prototype to Beetroot. Julius chases after Vincent, sensing his whereabouts thanks to [[twin telepathy]], and finds him seconds after the exchange with Beetroot. Webster appears and kills Beetroot and his bodyguard, demanding the money from Vincent. Julius intercepts Webster, allowing Vincent to escape, but Vincent returns and agrees to give Webster the money to save Julius. Webster decides to kill them anyway for seeing his face, but Vincent, at Julius' subtle prompting, kills him by dropping a heavy chain onto him and burying him.\n\nJulius and Vincent return both the prototype and $4 million (with Vincent skimming $1 million) and use a $50,000 reward to pay off Vincent's debts and start a consulting firm. Their publicity reaches the art colony, and Mary Ann learns that her sons are alive. She violently confronts Traven for concealing the truth and then tracks Julius and Vincent down to their workplace, where they share a warm reunion.\n\nSometime later, Julius and Vincent marry Marnie and Linda. Both marriages produce twin children, and the couples are last seen meeting their mother and Professor Werner on an outing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Julius Benedict, Vincent's older fraternal twin brother.\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Vincent Benedict, Julius' younger fraternal twin brother.\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Marnie Mason, Linda's sister and Julius' girlfriend.\n* [[Chloe Webb]] as Linda Mason, Marnie's sister and Vincent's girlfriend.\n* [[Bonnie Bartlett]] as Mary Ann Benedict, the twins' biological mother.\n** [[Heather Graham]] as young Mary Ann (''uncredited'')\n* [[David Caruso]] as Al Greco, a friend of Vincent's.\n* [[Trey Wilson]] as Beetroot McKinley\n* [[Marshall Bell]] as Mr. Webster\n* [[Tony Jay]] as Professor Werner, one of the scientists from the experiment that created Julius and Vincent who raised Julius.\n* [[Hugh O'Brian]] as Granger, one of the twins' six fathers.\n* [[Nehemiah Persoff]] as Dr. Mitchell Traven, one of the scientists from the experiment that created Julius and Vincent.\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Burt Klane, Bob and Morris' brother.\n* [[Tom McCleister]] as Bob Klane, Burt and Morris' brother.\n* David Efron as Morris Klane, Burt and Bob's brother.\n* [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]] as Sam Klane, Burt, Bob, and Morris' cousin and Dave's brother or cousin.\n* Gus Rethwisch as Dave Klane, Burt, Bob, and Morris' cousin and Sam's brother or cousin.\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Tony\n* [[Robert Harper (actor)|Robert Harper]] as Gilbert Larsen\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe original music score was composed by [[Georges Delerue]] and [[Randy Edelman]]. Edelman has scored three more films for the director (''[[Ghostbusters II]]''; ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]''; and ''[[Six Days, Seven Nights]]'') whereas this was Delerue's only work for him.\n\nNotably, this was Arnold Schwarzenegger's first time starring in a major comedy. Because the studio viewed this as a significant risk compared with having Schwarzenegger make another profitable action film, Schwarzenegger voluntarily took no salary in exchange for a share of the film's profits. Co-star Danny DeVito and director Ivan Reitman made similar deals. When the film was a major financial success \u2013 box office of $216M against an $18M production budget \u2013 the three together earned a significant share of the overall profits. In a 2016 interview with Graham Bensinger in which Schwarzenegger recounted this story, Schwarzenegger stated that the decision to \"invest in myself\" by trying comedy and forgoing the salary in exchange for a share of the film's profits was one of the best decisions of his entire life.<ref>In Depth \u2013 Graham Bensinger.
