The plot centers on an encounter between on-the-run embezzler [[Marion Crane]] (Leigh) and shy motel proprietor [[Norman Bates]] (Perkins) and its aftermath, in which a private investigator (Balsam), Marion's lover Sam Loomis (Gavin), and her sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] (Miles) investigate her disappearance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/24944/Psycho/full-synopsis.html|title=Psycho (1960) - Full Synopsis|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=June 16, 2018|archive-date=June 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616053629/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/24944/Psycho/full-synopsis.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Psycho'' was seen as a departure from Hitchcock's previous film ''[[North by Northwest]]'', as it was filmed on a lower budget in black-and-white by the crew of his television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. The film was initially considered controversial and received mixed reviews, but audience interest and outstanding [[box office|box-office]] returns prompted a major critical re-evaluation. ''Psycho'' was nominated for four [[33rd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Leigh and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Hitchcock.\n\n''Psycho'' is now considered one of Hitchcock's best films,<ref>''Psycho'' is the top listed Hitchcock film in ''The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time'' by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and the highest Hitchcock film on [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]].</ref> and is arguably his most famous work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/psycho-turns-60-hitchcocks-famous-fright-film-broke-all-the-rules-140175|title=Psycho turns 60 \u2013 Hitchcock's famous fright film broke all the rules|website=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|date=June 15, 2020|access-date=January 22, 2021|archive-date=December 17, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201217142643/http://theconversation.com/psycho-turns-60-hitchcocks-famous-fright-film-broke-all-the-rules-140175|url-status=live}}</ref> It has been praised as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars due to its slick direction, tense atmosphere, impressive camerawork, a memorable score and iconic performances.

Marion returns to work, steals a cash payment of $40,000 entrusted to her for deposit, and sets off to drive to Sam's home in Fairvale, California. Marion hurriedly trades her car en route, arousing suspicion from both the car dealer and a [[California Highway Patrol]] officer.\n\nMarion stops for the night at the Bates Motel, located off the main highway, and hides the stolen money inside a newspaper. Proprietor [[Norman Bates]] descends from a large house overlooking the motel, registers Marion under an assumed name, and invites her to dine with him. After Norman returns to his house, Marion overhears Norman arguing with his mother about Marion's presence. Norman returns with a light meal and apologizes for his mother's outbursts. Norman discusses his hobby as a taxidermist, his mother's \"illness\", and how people have a \"private trap\" they want to escape. Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning and return the stolen money. As Marion showers, a shadowy figure in a dress appears and stabs her to death. Soon afterward, Norman cleans up the murder scene, putting Marion's body, belongings, and the hidden cash in her car, and sinks it in a [[swamp]].\n\nMarion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] arrives in Fairvale a week later, tells Sam about the theft, and demands to know her whereabouts. He denies knowing anything about her disappearance. A private investigator named Arbogast approaches them, saying that he has been hired to retrieve the money. Arbogast stops at the Bates Motel and questions Norman, whose nervous behavior and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. He examines the [[guest register]] and discovers from her handwriting that Marion spent a night in the motel. When Arbogast learns that Marion had spoken to Norman's mother, Arbogast asks to speak to her, but Norman refuses it. Arbogast updates Sam and Lila about his search and promises to meet them within an hour at Sam's home. After he enters the Bates home to search for Norman's mother, the shadowy figure emerges from the bedroom and stabs him to death.\n\nSam visits the motel with Lila when they hear nothing from Arbogast, worried something went wrong. He sees a figure in the house whom he assumes is Norman's mother. Lila and Sam alert the local sheriff, who tells them Norman's mother died in a murder\u2013suicide ten years earlier. The sheriff suggests Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that something happened to Arbogast, Lila and Sam drive to the motel. Sam distracts Norman in the office while Lila sneaks into the house. Suspicious, Norman becomes agitated and knocks Sam unconscious. As he goes to the house, Lila hides in the fruit cellar, where she discovers the mother's [[Mummy|mummified]] body. She screams, and Norman, wearing women's clothes and a wig, enters the cellar and tries to stab her. Sam appears and subdues him.\n\nAt the police station, a psychiatrist explains that  Norman killed his mother and her lover ten years earlier out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, Norman mummified his mother's corpse and began treating it as if she was still alive. He recreated his mother as an [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]], as jealous and possessive towards Norman as he felt about his mother. When Norman is attracted to a woman, \"Mother\" takes over. He had killed two other missing young women before Marion and Arbogast. The psychiatrist concludes that \"Mother\" has now submerged Norman's personality. Norman sits in a jail cell and hears his mother saying the murders were all his doing. Marion's car is retrieved from the swamp.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Anthony Perkins Psycho Promotional Still.jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Perkins]]' performance as [[Norman Bates]] won him considerable critical praise.]]\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Vera Miles]] as [[Lila Crane]]\n* [[John Gavin]] as Sam Loomis\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Private Investigator Arbogast\n* [[John McIntire]] as Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers\n* [[Simon Oakland]] as Dr. Richmond\n* [[Frank Albertson]] as Tom Cassidy\n* [[Pat Hitchcock]] as Caroline\n* [[Vaughn Taylor (actor)|Vaughn Taylor]] as George Lowery\n* [[Lurene Tuttle]] as Mrs. Chambers\n* [[John Anderson (actor)|John Anderson]] as California Charlie\n* [[Mort Mills]] as highway patrol officer\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as [[Marion Crane]]\n\n[[Virginia Gregg]], [[Paul Jasmin]], and [[Jeanette Nolan]] make uncredited appearances as the voice of [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma \"Mother\" Bates]].

Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their sound stages were booked, but the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered that he personally would finance the project and film it at [[Universal-International]] using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would distribute. In lieu of his usual $250,000 director's fee, he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative. This combined offer was accepted, and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of naysaying from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===Screenplay===\n[[File:Universal Studios Hollywood 2012 44.jpg|thumb|right|Replaying a scene at the Hollywood [[Studio Tour]]]]\n[[James P.

Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|pp=24\u201326}} Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between [[Gorman, California|Gorman]] and [[Fresno]], California for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix.

The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and zooms in and out, proved difficult for Leigh because the water splashing in her eyes made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well because he had to manually focus while moving the camera.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|p=73}} Retakes were required for the opening scene because Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|p=55}} Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|p=59}} Lastly, the scene in which \"Mother\" is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane) hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be difficult. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were effected to his satisfaction.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nAccording to Hitchcock, a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were done by assistant director Hilton A. Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass's drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the [[dailies]] of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were \"no good\" because they did not portray \"an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs\".<ref name=\"Truffaut\">{{Harvnb|Truffaut|Scott|1967|p=273}}</ref> Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic, owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist. A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chairlike device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n[[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo]] is a signature occurrence in most of his films.

Many are close-ups, including extreme close-ups, except for medium shots in the shower directly before and directly after the murder. The combination of the close shots with their short duration makes the sequence feel more subjective than if the images were presented alone or in a wider angle, an example of the technique Hitchcock described as \"transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience\".<ref>Hitchcock, cited in {{Harvnb|Schickel|Capra|2001|pp=293, 308}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Psycho (1960 film) shower scene.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A silhouetted figure brandishes a knife towards the camera|The shadowy figure from the shower scene]]\nTo capture the straight-on shot of the shower head, the camera had to be equipped with a long lens.

Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref name=\"Krohn\" /> Krohn also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a [[Mitchell Camera|BNC Mitchell]], the other a handheld French ''[[Eclair (camera)|\u00c9clair]]'' camera which [[Orson Welles]] had used in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a [[Moviola]] on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor [[George Tomasini]] worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass's storyboards.<ref name=\"Krohn\" />\n\nAccording to [[Donald Spoto]] in ''The Dark Side of Genius'' and to Stephen Rebello in ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho'', Hitchcock's wife and trusted collaborator, [[Alma Reville]], spotted a blooper in one of the last edits of ''Psycho'' before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink.

Later, when the MPAA switched to a voluntary letter ratings system in 1968, ''Psycho'' was one of a number of high-profile motion pictures to be retro-rated with an \"M\" (Suggested for mature audiences: Parental discretion advised). This remained the only rating the film would receive for 16 years, and according to the guidelines of the time \"M\" was the equivalent of a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|\"PG\" rating]].<ref name=\"Rate_2\">{{cite web|title=MPAA Ratings System|url=http://www.hometheaterinfo.com/mpaa.htm|access-date=November 8, 2010|publisher=Home Theater Info|archive-date=October 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031065048/http://hometheaterinfo.com/mpaa.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Rate_3\">{{cite magazine|author=Beth Pinsker|date=November 25, 1994|title=The Ratings: A Look Back|url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,304598,00.html|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=March 19, 2013|archive-date=June 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624160700/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304598,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1984, amidst a controversy surrounding the levels of violence depicted in \"PG\"-rated films in the VCR era, the film was re-classified to its current rating of \"R\".<ref name=\"Rate_2\" /><ref name=\"Rate_3\" />\n\n===Re-release===\nThe film had another successful theatrical reissue in 1969.\n\nThe film was re-released to cinemas on September 20 and 23, 2015, as part of the \"TCM Presents\" series by [[Turner Classic Movies]] and Fathom Events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/psycho-grease-rerelease-tcm-presents-1201515588/|title='Psycho', 'Grease' Returning to Cinemas in 'TCM Presents' Series|work=Variety|last=Kelley|first=Seth|date=June 9, 2015|access-date=September 6, 2015|archive-date=August 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823041744/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/psycho-grease-rerelease-tcm-presents-1201515588/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\n[[CBS]] purchased the television rights for $450,000.

The film is instead ironic as it presents \"clarity and fulfillment\" of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters \"struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories\" and ultimately fail.<ref name=\"brill200\u2013201\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> Lesley Brill writes: \"The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness\". The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=223}}</ref> Marion is like [[Persephone]] of [[Greek mythology]], who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain with Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone's flowers, but they are only \"reflected in mirrors, as images of images\u2014twice removed from reality\". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion's lifeless eye, \"like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption\".<ref name=\"brill234\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=224}}</ref>\n\nMarion is deprived of \"the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family\", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among ''Psycho''{{'}}s secondary characters a lack of \"familial warmth and stability\", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an \"increasingly connubial\" relationship, a development that Marion is denied.<ref name=\"brill228\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=228}}</ref> Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has \"an infantile and divided personality\" and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are \"frozen in time\" and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put\nhis mother \"someplace\" and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains: {{\" '}}Someplace' for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=229}}</ref>\n\nLight and darkness feature prominently in ''Psycho''. The first shot after the [[intertitle]] is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness.<ref name=\"brill225\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=225}}</ref> Bright lights are also \"the ironic equivalent of darkness\" in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, \"the glaring white\" of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.<ref name=\"brill225\u2013256\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=225\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n===Motifs===\nThe film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the  end. More subtly, [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlighting]] turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|pp=90\u201393}}\n\nMirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.{{sfn|Nickens|Leigh|1996|pp=90\u201393}}\n\nThere are a number of references to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman comments that Marion eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, \"stuffing birds\", ''bird'' being British slang for a desirable woman.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Material Image: Art And the Real in Film |last= Peucker |first=Brigitte |year=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-5431-6 |page=167}}</ref> Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original \"stuffed bird\", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=161}}\n\n===Psychoanalytic interpretation===\n''Psycho'' has been called \"the first [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] thriller\".<ref name=\"Kaganski\">{{Harvnb|Kaganski|1997}}</ref> The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. French film critic Serge Kaganski wrote: \"The shower scene is both feared and desired. Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists because Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene\".<ref name=\"Kaganski\"/>\n\nIn his documentary ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'', [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] remarks that Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]]: the top floor would be the [[superego]], where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]], where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and the basement would be Bates' [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]]. \u017di\u017eek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.<ref>{{cite video |people= [[Sophie Fiennes|Fiennes, Sophie]] (director); [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek|\u017di\u017eek, Slavoj]] (writer/narrator) |date = 2006|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828154|title = The Pervert's Guide to Cinema|medium= documentary |publisher=Amoeba Film}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960.<ref name=\"Psychof\">[http://www.filmsite.org/psyc.html Psycho (1960)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527175653/http://www.filmsite.org/psyc.html |date=May 27, 2007}}.
