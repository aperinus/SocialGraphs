It is a [[satire]] on [[Russian literature]] starring Allen and [[Diane Keaton]] as Boris and Sonja, Russians living during the [[Napoleonic Era]] who engage in mock-serious philosophical debates. Allen considered it the funniest film he had made up until that point.<ref name=\"tcmart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17640/Love-and-Death/articles.html|title=Love and Death (1975)|last=Stafford|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]]|quote=... he was able to pay homage to some of his favorite films: a battlefield hawker who sells [[blini]]s to the troops recalls [[Harpo Marx]] in ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933), a dueling scene appears modeled on a Bob Hope routine in ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (1946 film)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' (1946), the climax is a direct nod to Ingmar Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957) and the ''[[Scythian Suite]]'' by Stravinsky is used as background music in one scene, just as it was in Sergei Eisenstein's ''[[Alexander Nevsky]]'' (1938). Famous dialogue from the novels of Tolstoy like ''[[War and Peace]]'' and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' is also parodied along with in-jokes about the poetry of [[T.S. Eliot]].|access-date=2013-08-23|archive-date=2019-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731040302/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17640/Love-and-Death/articles.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWhen [[Napoleon]] ([[James Tolkan]]) [[War of the Fifth Coalition|invades Austria]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Boris Grushenko ([[Woody Allen]]), a coward and [[pacifist]] scholar, is forced to enlist in the Russian army. Desperate and disappointed after hearing the news that Sonja ([[Diane Keaton]]), his cousin twice removed, is to wed a herring merchant, he inadvertently becomes a war hero. Boris returns and marries the recently widowed Sonja, who does not want to marry him, but promises him that she will, in order to make him happy for one night, when she thinks that he is about to be killed in a duel. To her surprise and disappointment, he survives the duel. Their marriage is filled with philosophical debates but no money. Their life together is interrupted when Napoleon [[French invasion of Russia|invades the Russian Empire]]. Boris wants to flee but his wife, angered that the invasion will interfere with their plans to start a family that year, conceives a plot to [[Assassination|assassinate]] Napoleon at his headquarters in Moscow. Boris and Sonja debate the matter with some degree of philosophical [[doublespeak]], and Boris reluctantly goes along with it. They fail to kill Napoleon and Sonja escapes arrest while Boris is executed, despite being told by a vision that he will be pardoned. Boris' ghost bids goodbye to Sonja and the audience before dancing away with [[Death (personification)|Death]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Boris Grushenko\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Sonja\n* [[James Tolkan]] as [[Napoleon]]\n* [[Harold Gould]] as Anton lvanovich Lebedokov\n* [[Olga Georges-Picot]] as Countess Alexandrovna \n* [[Beth Porter]] as Anna\n* [[Zvee Scooler]] as Father\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as Natasha\n* [[F\u00e9odor Atkine]] as Mikhail Grushenko\n* [[Despo Diamantidou]] as Boris' mother\n* [[Yves Barsacq]] as Rimsky\n* [[Yves Brainville]] as Andre\n* [[Brian Coburn (actor)|Brian Coburn]] as Dimitri\n* [[Tony Jay]] as Vladimir Maximovitch\n* [[Howard Vernon]] as Gen.

Consequently, he swore never to shoot a film outside the United States again. However, starting in 1996 with ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'', Allen did in fact shoot a number of films abroad.<ref name=tcmart />\n\n==Style==\nComing between Allen's ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973) and ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), ''Love and Death'' is in many respects an artistic transition between the two.<ref name=tcmart/> Allen pays tribute to the humor of [[The Marx Brothers]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]] throughout the film.\n\nThe dialogue and scenarios [[parody]] Russian novels, particularly those by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], such as ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', ''[[The Gambler (novella)|The Gambler]]'', ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'' and ''[[War and Peace]]''.<ref name=tcmart/> This includes a dialogue between Boris and his father in which each line alludes to, or is composed entirely of, Dostoyevsky titles.\n\nThe use of [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]] on the soundtrack adds to the Russian flavor of the film. Prokofiev's \"[[Troika (dance)|Troika]]\" from the ''[[Lieutenant Kij\u00e9 (Prokofiev)#Suite|Lieutenant Kij\u00e9 Suite]]'' is featured prominently, for the film's opening and [[closing credits]] and in selected scenes in the film when a \"bouncy\" theme is required. The battle scene is accompanied with music from Prokofiev's [[Alexander Nevsky (Prokofiev)#Alexander Nevsky, cantata, Op. 78 (1939)|''Alexander Nevsky'' cantata]]. Boris is marched to his execution to the \"March\" from Prokofiev's ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]''.<ref name=tcmart/>\n\nSome of the humor is straightforward; other jokes rely on the viewer's awareness of classic literature or contemporary European cinema. For example, the final shot of Keaton is a reference to [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''.<ref name=tcmart/> The sequence with the stone lions is a parody of [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'', while the Russian battle against Napoleon's army heavily parodies the same film's \"Odessa steps\" sequence.<ref name=tcmart/> Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' is parodied several times, including during the climax.<ref name=tcmart/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film grossed over $20 million in North America,<ref>[https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=loveanddeath.htm \"Love and Death\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515212804/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=loveanddeath.htm |date=2019-05-15 }} on Box Office Mojo</ref> making it the [[1975 in film|18th highest grossing picture of 1975]] in North America (theatrical rentals were $5 million).<ref>\"All-time Film Rental Champs\", ''Variety'', 7 January 1976 p 48</ref>\n\nAt [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 21 out of 21 critics&mdash;including three of the site's \"top critics\"&mdash;consider the film \"fresh\", with [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|a 100% rating]] and a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 8.13/10.
