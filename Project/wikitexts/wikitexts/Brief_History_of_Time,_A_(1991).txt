The music is by frequent Morris collaborator [[Philip Glass]].\n\n==Production==\nThis film project originated with executive producer Gordon Freedman, who brought the project to [[ITV Anglia|Anglia Television]] as a co-producer. After acquiring the property, Freedman met with director [[Steven Spielberg]] for advice on how to make the project into an important documentary film. Spielberg suggested Errol Morris as director. Morris had studied the history and philosophy of science at Princeton and later Berkeley, so was familiar with many of the topics in Hawking's book. Freedman's production company partnered with Anglia Television and Tokyo Broadcasting. [[David Hickman (producer)|David Hickman]], of Anglia, became the film's producer.\n\nMorris only had a few days of access to film and interview Hawking. Because of Hawking's [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]], a disease that progressively affects nerve cells within the spine and brain,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Association |first1=ALS |title=About ALS |url=http://www.alsa.org/about-als/ |website=ALSA |publisher=The ALS Association |access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref> Morris filmed various static shots of Hawking, his wheelchair, and the tools he used to communicate, such as his battery-powered computer-based communication system with an electronic voicebox (which was sponsored and provided by Intel Corporation<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hawking |first1=Stephen |title=The Computer |url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-computer.html |website=Hawking}}</ref>), to later edit together for the video component of Hawking's interview segments in the film.\n\nAlthough Hawking had an aversion to featuring his personal life in the film, Morris saw ''A Brief History of Time'' as being as much a biography as a science text, and much of his directing and editing work was dedicated to finding ways to depict ideas from [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] and then connect those ideas with details from the life of Hawking. He employed stylized interview sequences, graphic illustrations, and music written by [[Philip Glass]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tobias |first1=Scott |title=A Brief History Of Time |url=https://thedissolve.com/reviews/645-a-brief-history-of-time/ |website=The Dissolve |publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc. |access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref> Morris also included clips from Disney's ''[[The Black Hole (1979 film)|The Black Hole]]'' (1979).\n\nInstead of Morris traveling around and filming the various interview subjects in their native surroundings, all of the interviews for this film were shot on specially built sets on a sound stage in England.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Resha |first1=David |title=The Cinema of Errol Morris |date=2010 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Nwv6BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA82|page=88 |isbn=9780819575357 |access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref> Morris said he was \"very moved by Hawking as a man\", calling him \"immensely likable, perverse, funny...and yes, he's a genius.\"[1] He remembers that Hawking had posters of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in his office, and one of them fell down while they were filming. \"A fallen woman\", Hawking's speech synthesizer intoned. Hawking's mother, Isobel, is the first person we hear from in the movie, and near the end she describes her son as \"a seeker\" for truth. After the movie premiered, Hawking told Morris, \"Thank you for making my mother a star.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Butler |first=Isaac |date=March 16, 2018 |title=Errol Morris on Stephen Hawking and his movie A Brief History of Time |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/03/errol-morris-on-stephen-hawking-and-his-movie-a-brief-history-of-time.html}}</ref>\n\n== List of interviewees ==\n(in order of appearance)\n\nIsobel Hawking, Hawking's mother\n\nJanet Humphrey, Hawking's aunt\n\nMary Hawking, Hawking's sister\n\nBasil King, neighbor of the Hawkings\n\nDerek Powney, classmate of Hawking at Oxford\n\nNorman Dix, classmate of Hawking at Oxford\n\nRobert Berman, tutor of Hawking at Oxford\n\nGordon Berry, classmate of Hawking at Oxford\n\n[[Roger Penrose]], mathematical physicist who worked with Hawking on [[Penrose\u2013Hawking singularity theorems|Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems]]\n\n[[Dennis W.
