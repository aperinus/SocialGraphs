It stars [[Adrienne Barbeau]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]], [[Janet Leigh]] and [[Hal Holbrook]]. It tells the story of a strange, glowing fog that sweeps over a small coastal town in California, bringing with it the [[vengeful ghosts]] of [[sailor|mariner]]s who were killed in a shipwreck there 100 years before.\n\n''The Fog'' was not well received by critics upon release but was a hit at the box office, making over $21 million domestically on a $1.1 million budget. Since release, it has received more positive retrospective reviews and has become a [[cult film|cult classic]]. A [[The Fog (2005 film)|remake]] of the film, released in [[The Fog (2005 film)|2005]], was also universally panned by critics, but performed well at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTE: AS PER WP: FILM PLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS.

One of the stories is about a local ship that had crashed against the rocks, causing all of its crew to drown, after mistaking a campfire for a lighthouse.  Paranormal activity then begins around the town starting at midnight, which results in the town priest, Father Malone, discovering his grandfather's diary at the church after a piece of masonry falls from the wall. The journal reveals that in 1880, the six founders of Antonio Bay (including Malone's grandfather) deliberately sank a [[clipper ship]] named the ''Elizabeth Dane'', so that its wealthy, [[leprosy]]-afflicted owner Blake would not establish a leper colony nearby. The conspirators used some of the gold plundered from the ship to found the town.\n\nMeanwhile, three fishermen are out at sea when a strange, glowing fog envelops their trawler. The fog brings with it the ''Elizabeth Dane'', carrying the vengeful [[revenants]] of Blake and his crew, who kill the fishermen. Meanwhile, town resident Nick Castle is driving his truck home and picks up a young hitchhiker named Elizabeth Solley. As they drive towards town, all the truck's windows inexplicably shatter.\n\nThe following morning, local radio DJ Stevie Wayne is given a piece of driftwood by her son Andy; it is inscribed with the word \"DANE\", and Andy says he found it on the beach. Intrigued, Stevie takes it with her to the [[lighthouse]] where she broadcasts her radio show. She sets the wood down next to a tape player that is playing, but the wood inexplicably begins to seep water, causing the tape player to [[short circuit#Damage|short circuit]]. A mysterious man's voice emerges from the tape player swearing revenge, and the words \"6 must die\" appear on the wood before it bursts into flame. Stevie quickly extinguishes the fire, but she then sees that the wood once again reads \"DANE\" and the tape player begins working normally again.\n\nAfter locating the missing trawler, Nick and Elizabeth find the corpse of one of the fishermen, Dick Baxter, with his eyes gouged out. The other two are missing, one of whom is the husband of Kathy Williams, who is overseeing the town's centennial celebrations.  While Elizabeth is alone in the [[autopsy]] room, Baxter's corpse rises from the autopsy table and approaches her, before collapsing. As Elizabeth screams, Nick and coroner Dr. Phibes rush into the room where they see the once-again lifeless corpse has carved the number 3 on the floor. That evening, as the town's celebrations begin, local weatherman Dan calls Stevie at the radio station to tell her that another fog bank has appeared and is moving towards town. As they are talking, the fog gathers outside the weather station and Dan hears a knock at the door. He answers it and is killed by the revenants as Stevie listens in horror. As Stevie proceeds with her radio show, the fog starts moving inland, disrupting the town's telephone and power lines. Using a backup [[electric generator|generator]], Stevie begs her listeners to go to her house and save her son when she sees the fog closing in from her lighthouse vantage point. As the fog envelops Stevie's house, the revenants kill her son's babysitter, Mrs. Kobritz. They then pursue Andy, but Nick and Elizabeth arrive and rescue him.\n\nStevie advises everyone to head to the town's church through her broadcast. Once inside, Nick, Elizabeth, Andy, Kathy, her assistant Sandy and Father Malone take refuge in a back room as the fog arrives outside. Inside the room, they locate a gold cross in the wall cavity which is made from the rest of the stolen gold. As the revenants begin their attack, Malone takes the gold cross out into the chapel. Knowing that they have returned to take six lives in lieu of the six original conspirators who led them to their deaths, Malone offers the gold and himself to Blake to spare the others. At the lighthouse, more revenants attack Stevie, trapping her on the roof. Inside the church, Blake seizes the gold cross, which begins to glow. Nick pulls Malone away from the cross seconds before it disappears in a blinding flash of light along with Blake and his crew. The revenants at the lighthouse also disappear, and the fog vanishes. Stevie gets down from the roof and makes it back to safety.\n\nAfter Elizabeth, Nick, Andy, Kathy and Sandy leave the church, Malone contemplates why he was spared by Blake and asks \"Why not six?\" given that there have been only five deaths. However, moments later, the fog reappears inside the church along with the revenants and Blake decapitates Malone as the screen cuts to black.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Adrienne Barbeau]] as Stevie Wayne\n* [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Castle\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Elizabeth Solley\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as Father Patrick Malone\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as Kathy Williams\n* [[Nancy Kyes|Nancy Loomis]] as Sandy Fadel\n* Ty Mitchell as Andrew \"Andy\" Wayne\n* [[Charles Cyphers]] as Dan O'Bannon/Dan the Weather Man\n* James Canning as Dick Baxter\n* [[John Houseman]] as Mr. Machen\n* John F.

He has also said that he was inspired by a visit to [[Stonehenge]] with his co-writer/producer (and then-girlfriend), Debra Hill. While in England promoting ''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'', Carpenter and Hill visited the site in the late afternoon one day and saw an eerie fog in the distance.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Fog |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/feb/26/philipfrench4 |access-date=June 30, 2022 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> In the DVD audio commentary for the film, Carpenter noted that the story of the deliberate wreckage of a ship and its subsequent plundering was based on an actual event (the wrecking of the Frolic<ref>{{cite web |title=The Frolic |url=http://www.lookoutranch.com/Frolic.htm |website=Lookout Ranch |access-date=9 October 2022}}</ref>) that took place in the 19th century near [[Goleta, California]]<ref name=Boulenger/>{{rp|116}} (this event was portrayed more directly in the 1975 [[Tom Laughlin]] film, ''[[The Master Gunfighter]]''). The premise also bears strong resemblances to [[Massimo Pupillo]]'s 1965 ''[[Terror-Creatures from the Grave]]'' as well as the [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] poem ''The Wreck of the Palatine'' which appeared in ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in 1867, about [[Palatine Light|the wreck of the ship ''Princess Augusta'' in 1738]], at [[Block Island]], within [[Rhode Island]].\n\n''The Fog'' was part of a two-picture deal with AVCO-Embassy, along with ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), and was shot on a reported budget of $1 million.<ref name=Boulenger/>{{rp|115}} Although this was essentially a low-budget independent film, Carpenter chose to shoot in the [[anamorphic]] 2.35:1 format, preventing it from looking like a low-budget horror film. Filming took place from April to May 1979 at Raleigh Studios in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood, California]] (interior scenes) and on location at [[Point Reyes, California]]; [[Bolinas, California]]; [[Inverness, California]]; and the Episcopal Church of the Ascension in [[Sierra Madre, California]].\n\nAfter viewing a rough cut of the film, Carpenter was dissatisfied with the results. Recalling the experience, Carpenter commented \"It was terrible. I had a movie that didn't work, and I knew it in my heart\".<ref name=Boulenger/>{{rp|118}} Carpenter subsequently added the prologue with Mr. Machen ([[John Houseman]]) telling ghost stories to fascinated children by a campfire (Houseman played a similar role in the opening of the 1981 film ''[[Ghost Story (1981 film)|Ghost Story]]''). Carpenter added several other new scenes and re-shot others in order to make the film more comprehensible, more frightening, and gorier. Carpenter and Debra Hill have said the necessity of a re-shoot became especially clear to them after they realized that ''The Fog'' would have to compete with horror films that had high gore content.<ref name=2002SpEd/> Approximately one-third of the finished film is the newer footage, increasing the film's budget slightly to $1.1 million.<ref name=2002SpEd/>\n\n===Casting===\nCast as the female lead was [[Adrienne Barbeau]], Carpenter's wife, who had appeared in Carpenter's TV movie ''[[Someone's Watching Me!]]'' in 1978.

A further undisclosed amount was spent on 600 prints of the film, 540 of which were distributed to American cinemas.
