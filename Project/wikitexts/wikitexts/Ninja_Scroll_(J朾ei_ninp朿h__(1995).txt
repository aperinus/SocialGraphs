The film was a co-production between [[JVC]], [[Toho]] and [[Movic]], with [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] serving as the animation studio. ''Ninja Scroll'' was theatrically released in Japan on June 5, 1993, and received an English-[[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] release produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and released in Western countries through [[Manga Entertainment]] in 1995.<ref name=\"Cast\">{{cite web|title=Ninja Scroll (movie)|url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/488/ninja-scroll/|access-date=February 27, 2017|work=Crystalacids}}</ref>\n\nThe film takes place in [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185\u20131868)|feudal Japan]] and follows Kibagami Jubei, a [[mercenary]] swordsman who battles the Eight Devils of Kimon, a team of ninjas with supernatural powers who are intent on overthrowing the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. During his quest, he is aided by Dakuan, an elderly but crafty government spy, and Kagero, a [[K\u014dga-ry\u016b|K\u014dga]] [[kunoichi]] whose body is infused with poisonous toxins.\n\nPraised for its animation and action scenes, ''Ninja Scroll'' is regarded by many as one of the most influential anime films ever made. Alongside ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', it was responsible for increasing the popularity of adult-oriented anime outside of Japan. The film has been cited by [[The Wachowskis]] as an influence on the ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|Matrix]]'' franchise, and resulted in Kawajiri later contributing to two segments of the anthology film ''[[The Animatrix]]''.<ref name=\"Matrix Interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.matrixfans.net/the-animatrix/world-record/interview-with-writer-yoshiaki-kawajiri/#sthash.RK0Yh4FF.dpbs|work=MatrixFans.net|access-date=March 3, 2017|title=Interview with Writer Yoshiaki Kawajiri}}</ref>\n\nA televised [[stand-alone sequel]], ''[[Ninja Scroll: The Series]]'', was aired in Japan in 2003.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn [[Edo period]]-[[Japan]], the {{Nihongo|Yamashiro clan|\u5c71\u57ce\u85e9|Yamashiro-han}} mines gold in secret, and sends a shipment to the [[House of Toyotomi|Toyotomi]] {{Nihongo|Shogun of the Dark|\u95c7\u516c\u65b9|Yami Kub\u014d}} as payment for his protection. The Shogun of the Dark intends to use the gold to buy advanced Spanish weaponry and overthrow the current government, the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]]. The ship runs aground onto {{Nihongo|Mochizuki territory|\u671b\u6708\u85e9|Mochizuki-han}} in a storm, and the {{Nihongo|Eight Devils of Kimon|\u9b3c\u9580\u516b\u4eba\u8846|Kimon Hachininsh\u016b}}, a ninja team with supernatural powers in the employ of the Yamashiro, kill the people of the nearby {{Nihongo|Shimoda Village|\u4e0b\u7530\u6751|Shimoda-mura}} to keep the gold shipment a secret.\n\nWhile investigating the deaths, a Mochizuki K\u014dga ninja team is massacred by the Devils. The sole survivor, the [[kunoichi]] {{Nihongo|Kagero|\u967d\u708e|Kager\u014d}}, is captured by a Devil, {{Nihongo|Tessai|\u9244\u658e|Tessai}}, who attempts to rape her. She is rescued by {{Nihongo|Kibagami Jubei|\u7259\u795e \u7363\u5175\u885b|Kibagami J\u016bb\u0113}}, a [[mercenary]] ex-Yamashiro ninja, who fights and eventually kills Tessai. {{Nihongo|Dakuan|\u6fc1\u5eb5|Dakuan}}, a Tokugawa spy, [[blackmail]]s Jubei into helping him kill the remaining Devils. To ensure his compliance, Dakuan stabs Jubei with a poisoned [[shuriken]], and promises to give him an antidote once the mission is complete. Jubei learns from Dakuan that the leader of the Devils is {{Nihongo|Himuro Gemma|\u6c37\u5ba4 \u5f26\u99ac|Himuro Genma}}, the former Yamashiro ninja leader, who had ordered his team's members to kill each other to cover up the location of the goldmine five years earlier. Jubei, who had been forced to kill his comrades to survive, decapitated Gemma in revenge; Gemma survived due to his [[immortality]].\nJubei is attacked by another Devil, {{Nihongo|Benisato|\u7d05\u91cc|Benisato}}, but he is saved by Kagero; before she can be questioned, Benisato is killed from afar by {{Nihongo|Yurimaru|\u767e\u5408\u4e38|Yurimaru}}, Gemma's right-hand man, for failing her mission. Kagero agrees to work alongside Jubei and Dakuan, who informs Jubei that her body is infused with such deadly toxins that anyone who kisses or sleeps with her dies, which was why Jubei could kill Tessai.\n\nThe trio arrive in Shimoda, where they discover that the villagers died due to their water supply being poisoned, making it appear that they were killed by a plague. Jubei and Kagero fend off attacks from three of the Devils \u2013 {{Nihongo|Mushizo|\u87f2\u8535|Mushiz\u014d}}, {{Nihongo|Zakuro|\u77f3\u69b4|Zakuro}}, and {{Nihongo|Utsutsu Mujuro|\u73fe \u5922\u5341\u90ce|Utsutsu Muj\u016br\u014d}}; Jubei succeeds in killing Mushizo and Utsutsu. After finding the beached ship, Kagero deduces that the gold has been taken to Kashima Harbor, where it will be transported to the Shogun of the Dark in another ship.\n\nJubei, Kagero, and Dakuan arrive at Kashima, which has been evacuated due to the townspeople's fear of the plague. While Jubei battles another Devil, {{Nihongo|Shijima|\u30b7\u30b8\u30de|Shijima}}, Kagero sends a message to {{Nihongo|Sakaki Hyobu|\u698a \u5175\u90e8|Sakaki Hy\u014dbu}}, the Mochizuki chamberlain, to bring his army to the harbour. She also learns from Dakuan that Jubei's poisoning will only be cured if he copulates with her \u2013 the poisons in her body will counteract his. Kagero is captured by Shijima, and Jubei kills him, rescuing her once more. Kagero asks Jubei to sleep with her to cure himself. He decides against it, and upon the arrival of the Shogun of the Dark's envoy in a ship, he leaves to prevent the gold reaching its destination.\n\nKagero arrives to meet Sakaki, but he stabs her, revealing himself to be Gemma in disguise. Enraged, Jubei fights through waves of ninjas, but is nearly killed by Yurimaru. A gunpowder-rigged rat, left as a trap by Zakuro for Yurimaru for rejecting her advances, kills him, allowing Jubei to escape. He finds Kagero; mortally wounded, she admits her love for him and they kiss, curing Jubei's poisoning. Before dying, Kagero gives Jubei her headband.\n\nJubei and Dakuan board the departing ship. On board, Gemma reveals his true intentions \u2013 to use the gold to raise a ninja army to terrorize Japan rather than serve as an ally to the Toyotomi \u2013 to a masked samurai who serves as the Shogun of the Dark's envoy, and proceeds to kill him. During an altercation with Zakuro, Jubei and Dakuan set the ship ablaze. As Jubei and Gemma engage in a brutal fight, the gold becomes molten and engulfs Gemma, who sinks to the bottom of the sea. Afterwards, Dakuan thanks Jubei, and expresses admiration for his and Kagero's humanity. Jubei resumes his vagabond lifestyle, with Kagero's headband tied around his sword's hilt.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Role\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Japanese<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title=Ninja Scroll|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Ninja-Scroll/|access-date=2021-12-19|website=Behind The Voice Actors|language=en-US}}</ref>\n!English<ref name=\":1\"/>\n|-\n!<small>[[Animaze]]/[[Manga Entertainment]]</small>\n|-\n!'''Kibagami Jubei'''\n|[[K\u014dichi Yamadera]]\n|Dean Wein\n|-\n!'''Kagero'''\n|[[Emi Shinohara]]\n|[[Wendee Lee]]\n|-\n!'''Dakuan'''\n|[[Takeshi Aono]]\n|Steve Apostolina\n|-\n!'''Masked samurai'''\n|[[Osamu Saka]]\n|[[Michael Forest]]\n|-\n!'''Himuro Gemma'''\n|[[Daisuke G\u014dri]]\n|[[Richard Epcar]]\n|-\n!'''Doujin'''\n|[[Ichir\u014d Nagai]]\n|[[Doug Stone (voice actor)|Doug Stone]]\n|-\n!'''Tessai'''\n|[[Ry\u016bzabur\u014d \u014ctomo]]\n|[[Kevin Seymour]]\n|-\n!'''Shijima'''\n|Akimasa \u014cmori\n|Kevin Seymour\n|-\n!'''Benisato'''\n|[[Gara Takashima]]\n|Marbry Steward\n|-\n!'''Hanza'''\n|[[Katsuji Mori]]\n|[[Kirk Thornton]]\n|-\n!'''Genpachi'''\n|[[Y\u016bsaku Yara]]\n|Doug Stone\n|-\n!'''Utsutsu Mujuro'''\n|[[Norio Wakamoto]]\n|Kirk Thornton\n|-\n!'''Yurimaru'''\n|[[Toshihiko Seki]]\n|[[Richard Cansino]]\n|-\n!'''Zakuro'''\n|[[Masako Katsuki]]\n|Riva Spier\n|-\n!'''Mushizo'''\n|[[Reiz\u014d Nomoto]]\n|[[Milt Jamin]]\n|-\n!'''Shinkuro'''\n|[[Jun'ichi Sugawara]]\n|Milt Jamin\n|- \n!
