The film is based on [[Stephen King]]'s [[Thinner (novel)|1984 novel of the same name]] (which he wrote under the pseudonym [[Richard Bachman]]) and stars [[Robert John Burke]], [[Joe Mantegna]], [[Lucinda Jenney]], [[Michael Constantine]], [[Kari Wuhrer]], and [[Bethany Joy Lenz]].\n\n==Plot==\nBilly Halleck is an [[Obesity|obese]] [[upper class]] lawyer who lives with his wife Heidi and their daughter Linda in [[Connecticut]]. Billy recently defended an underworld [[American Mafia|Mafia]] boss named Richie \"The Hammer\" Ginelli in court and is now celebrating his acquittal on a murder charge. Heidi, trying to persuade him to forget about his obsession with food, tries to give Billy oral sex as he is driving. Distracted, Billy accidentally runs over an elderly [[Romani people|Romani woman]] named Suzanne Lempke, killing her. He is acquitted in the proceedings by his friend Judge Cary Rossington. The local police chief Duncan Hopley also obstructs the case by committing [[perjury]] for Billy.\n\nOutraged by the injustice, Suzanne's father, Tadzu Lempke, places a curse on Billy on the steps of the courthouse by touching his face and uttering \"Thinner\". Soon afterward, Billy begins to lose weight rapidly despite not exercising or sticking to his diet. Heidi, fearing the weight loss may be due to cancer, calls Dr. Mike Houston, with whom Billy begins to suspect his wife is having an affair. Billy learns that Rossington and Hopley have also been cursed; Rossington has been metamorphosed into a lizard-like being, while Hopley develops purulent ulcers on his face and hands. Both Rossington and Hopley commit suicide. Billy tracks down the Romani camp and tries to reason with Tadzu; Tadzu threatens to make the curse worse if he doesn\u2019t leave. Gina, Tadzu's great-granddaughter, uses her slingshot to shoot a large ball bearing which goes through Billy's hand, infuriating him into vowing revenge against Tadzu and the other Romani people who live there.\n\nBilly enlists Ginelli to attack the Romani camp and persuade Tadzu to lift the curse. Chanting a spell, Tadzu mixes Billy's blood into a strawberry pie. Tadzu states that if someone else eats the pie, the curse will kill them quickly and Billy will be spared. He urges Billy to eat the pie himself and [[die with dignity]] but Billy refuses. Billy arrives home and gives Heidi the strawberry pie. She delightedly eats a piece. The next morning, Billy finds her desiccated corpse next to him. He is gleeful to be free of the curse and of what he believes is his disloyal wife. However, when he goes downstairs, he discovers that his daughter has eaten some of the pie for breakfast. Wracked with guilt, he prepares to eat the rest of the pie. However, he is interrupted by Mike at the door. Mike grows uncomfortable and struggles to explain his unannounced presence, seemingly confirming Billy's suspicions of an affair between Mike and Heidi. Billy invites Mike in for a piece of the pie and closes the door with a smirk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Robert John Burke]] as Billy Halleck\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Richie 'The Hammer' Ginelli\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Heidi Halleck\n* [[Michael Constantine]] as Tadzu Lempke\n* [[Kari Wuhrer]] as Gina Lempke Romani\n* [[Bethany Joy Lenz]] as Linda Halleck\n* [[Daniel von Bargen]] as Chief Duncan Hopley\n* John Horton as Judge Cary Rossington\n* Howard Erskine as Judge Phillips\n* Terence Kava as Gabe Romani\n* [[Irma St. Paule]] as Suzanne Lempke\n* [[Elizabeth Franz]] as Leda Rossington\n* [[Stephen King]] as Dr. Jonathan Bangor\n* [[Sam Freed]] as Dr. Mike Houston\n* Antonette Schwartzberg as Mama Ginelli\n* Sean Hewitt as Dr. Fander\n* Josh Holland as Frank Spurton\n* [[Peter Maloney (actor)|Peter Maloney]] as Biff Quigley\n* Ed Wheeler as Detective Deevers\n* Kenneth Londoner as Andrew Richards\n* [[Robert Fitch]] as 'Flash' Enders\n* [[Patrick Farrelly]] as Henry Halliwell\n* [[Walter Bobbie]] as Kirk Penschley\n* Jeff Ware as Max Duggenfield\n* Time Winters as Prosecutor\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2021}}\nIn order to depict Billy Halleck as overweight, makeup effects artist [[Greg Cannom]] created a number of [[fatsuit]]s for actor Robert John Burke to wear, along with [[Prosthetic makeup|latex pieces]] to make his face appear fatter.<ref name=\"Von Doviak 2014\">{{cite book|last=Von Doviak|first=Scott|date=2014|title=Stephen King Films FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the King of Horror on Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNCGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA184|publisher=[[Applause Theatre & Cinema Books]]|page=184|isbn=978-1480355514}}</ref> Cannom also designed a full-body suit with [[silicone]] breast implants, which Burke wore during a scene in which Billy is shown taking a shower.<ref name=\"Von Doviak 2014\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Thinner''  received mostly negative reviews from critics.
