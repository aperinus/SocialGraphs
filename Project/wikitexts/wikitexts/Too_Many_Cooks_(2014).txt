After its original airing, the piece became a [[viral video]] online and was repeated each night at midnight Eastern Time during the week of November 11, 2014.\n\n==Premise==\nThe video begins as a parody of [[opening credits]] sequences of 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s American [[Sitcom|situation comedies]], then television [[Crime film|crime dramas]], [[Soap opera#The primetime serial|prime time soap operas]], [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning cartoons]], superhero live-action series, [[slasher film]]s, and [[Science fiction on television|science fiction television shows]], with each of them gradually bleeding into the next. Particular focus is put on a [[Slasher film|slasher]] film villain (played by [[William Tokarsky]]), who is hidden in the background of several early shots but eventually starts killing the other characters with a [[machete]]. The opening credits sequence ends after about ten minutes and transitions into the \"episode\", with all the characters from the opening standing in the one house; the short ends roughly ten seconds later, cutting to closing credits before a full line of dialogue (\"Honey, I'm ho-\") can be spoken.<ref name=\"RS2\">{{cite news |work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/videos/watch-adult-swims-too-many-cooks-20141107 |title=Watch Adult Swim's Demented, Surreal Sitcom Parody 'Too Many Cooks' |first=Ryan |last=Reed |date=November 7, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Development and production==\nAccording to Kelly, he conveyed the concept of the short to his ''[[Squidbillies]]'' writer-producer friend Jim Fortier, who in turn described it to Adult Swim executive [[Mike Lazzo]], who loved the idea.
