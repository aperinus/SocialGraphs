It received generally positive reviews from critics, even though many considered it a disappointment after Blomkamp's first film ''[[District 9]]'', and was a modest box office success. ''Elysium'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on December 17, 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2154, [[Earth]] is overpopulated and polluted.  Most of the citizens live in [[poverty]] while the rich live on an orbiting space station named Elysium. A hacker named Spider runs flights to Elysium to smuggle people in to use their Med-Bays, devices that can heal any disease or condition. After Elysium's Defense Secretary Delacourt is reprimanded for shooting down several of Spider's spacecraft, she offers Armadyne Corp CEO John Carlyle defense contracts for life in exchange for a program that will allow Delacourt to conduct a [[coup]] and install herself as president. Carlyle writes the program and stores it inside his brain.  \n\nMax Da Costa is working for Armadyne Corp as a [[laborer]] when he is accidentally exposed to a lethal dose of [[radiation]].  He is given medication and told he has five days to live.  Max and his friend Julio approach Spider and make a deal: a ride to Elysium in exchange for stealing information for Spider. Spider provides Max with a powered exoskeleton for his mission.\n\nMax and Julio shoot down Carlyle's shuttle to Elysium and extract the program from his brain. Delacourt sends a black ops team led by Agent Kruger to retrieve it. Kruger kills Julio but an injured Max escapes with the data.\n\nMax seeks help from his childhood friend and nurse Frey, who patches him up.  Max goes to Spider, who realizes what the data in Max's head is worth.  Delacourt locks down all flights up to Elysium, leaving Spider unable to take Max. After Kruger kidnaps Frey and her daughter, Max approaches him and offers him the data in exchange for the use of a Med-Bay.  Kruger accepts and the lockdown is lifted so they can travel to Elysium.  During the flight, Kruger and Max fight over the data and a grenade explodes in Kruger's face. The ship crashes and Max is arrested and taken to Delacourt, who orders a team to extract the data.  Max escapes and heads to the armory to save Frey, who has been turned over to Kruger's men. Kruger is revived by a Med-Bay and confronted by Delacourt, whom he fatally wounds. He orders his men to start killing the politicians on the torus while he hunts down Max.\n\nSpider lands on Elysium and finds Max. He makes a deal with Max to have his men protect Frey and get her daughter to a Med-Bay in exchange for the data.  They make their way to the computer core, where they are confronted by Kruger.  Max and Kruger engage in a brutal fight that ends with Max detonating a grenade that kills Kruger.  Spider and Max connect to the computer and Spider realizes that the data will kill Max if he downloads it. Max says his goodbyes to Frey and initiates the download, killing himself but allowing Frey to heal her daughter. The police arrive but are unable to arrest Spider as everyone on Earth is now considered a citizen of Elysium. Medical shuttles loaded with Med-Bays are dispatched to Earth to begin healing everyone that needs help.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Max Da Costa, a former criminal now on probation.

It reunites Blomkamp with some of his ''District 9'' crew, such as editor [[Julian Clarke]], production designer Philip Ivey, [[cinematographer]] [[Trent Opaloch]], and actor [[Sharlto Copley]], playing one of the film's antagonists.
