It stars [[Cher]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Kristen Bell]], [[Cam Gigandet]], [[Stanley Tucci]], [[Julianne Hough]], [[Alan Cumming]], and [[Peter Gallagher]], and features cameos from [[Dianna Agron]], and [[James Brolin]]. The film tells the story of Ali (Aguilera), an aspiring singer who leaves her small hometown for Los Angeles, where she becomes a dancer at a struggling [[burlesque]] lounge owned by Tess (Cher). After a performance is sabotaged by her rival, Nikki (Bell), Ali sings the song herself, impressing Tess and leading to her becoming the main attraction of the lounge. ''Burlesque'' marks Aguilera's first leading role, as well as Cher's first musical performance on screen.\n\n''Burlesque'' was released in the United States on November 24, 2010 by [[Screen Gems]]. Its [[jazz]]-inspired [[Burlesque (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] was released ahead of the film's release on November 19, 2010 by [[RCA Records]] and Screen Gems. Aguilera and Cher both contributed to the album. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast's performance and the soundtrack but criticized the cliche writing. Despite its mixed reception, the film did well at the box office, grossing $90.5 million worldwide and earning an additional $42 million in domestic video sales.The film earned a nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] at the [[66th Golden Globe Awards]], where Cher's performance of \"[[You Haven't Seen the Last of Me]]\", written by [[Diane Warren]] won the for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. The soundtrack received a nomination at the [[54th Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media|Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media]].\n\n==Plot==\nAlice \"Ali\" Marilyn Rose ([[Christina Aguilera]]) is a young waitress from [[Iowa]] who dreams of becoming a professional dancer following her mother's death during childhood.\n\nAfter her selfish boss refuses salary, Ali steals from him and moves to [[Los Angeles]]. There Ali attends multiple auditions with little success. One night, Ali comes across a [[American burlesque|burlesque]] club where Tess Scali ([[Cher]]), the club's owner, and an entourage of dancers perform an opening number. Ali also meets songwriter Jack Miller ([[Cam Gigandet]]) at the club's bar. Jack refers her to Tess for an audition but she is told to come back another time and ushered out by her assistant Sean ([[Stanley Tucci]]). Upon seeing the waitress shortage, Ali picks up a tray and begins serving. As a result, she manages to get a job as a waitress at the club.\n\nWhen Georgia ([[Julianne Hough]]), one of the leading dancers, becomes pregnant, auditions are held in search of a replacement to fill her role. Ali performs a difficult dance routine and eventually persuades Tess to hire her. This, however, infuriates Nikki ([[Kristen Bell]]), a lead performer struggling with alcoholism.\n\nAli replaces Nikki one night to host a performance after the latter is too intoxicated to perform. In a fit of rage, Nikki sabotages the performance by turning off the music that the dancers usually lip sync to until Ali impresses everyone with her singing skills. Her performance is an instant success to which Tess casts her in an upcoming show. Despite the club's growing popularity, Tess struggles with a bank loan indicted to her owning the rights of the building.\n\nOne night after the club closes, Tess grows increasingly worried about her financiallity before a drunken Nikki shows up, accusing Tess of rejecting their long friendship. In defense of Ali, Tess questions Nikki's gratitude for the help she has received during her binges. In retaliation, a furious Nikki quits after she reveals to have slept with Tess' ex-husband Vince ([[Peter Gallagher]]). Tess then angrily smashes the passenger side window on Nikki's convertible with a crowbar after she leaves.\n\nMeanwhile, Ali and Jack become romantically attracted. However, Jack is already engaged to Natalie ([[Dianna Agron]]), an actress working in [[New York City]]. Sean encourages Jack to end the engagement, as Ali is a better person than his shallow fianc\u00e9e. Marcus ([[Eric Dane]]), a wealthy clubgoer, becomes infatuated with Ali, who begins spending time with him, making Jack jealous. At Georgia's wedding, Jack appears to call off his engagement and becomes drunk. That night, Ali and Jack sleep together, beginning an affair. In the morning, Natalie unexpectedly returns from New York and finds the two in bed together. Natalie angrily insists she and Jack never broke up though the latter denies this but asks Ali to leave. Feeling heartbroken and betrayed, Ali runs to Sean for support, also learning that Sean is gay. Marcus calls Ali, and Sean prompts her to go out with him.\n\nAli learns that Marcus is interested in the \"[[air rights]]\" above the club; he hopes to build a skyscraper on the property. Distraught, Ali breaks off her relationship with Marcus. She later tells Tess about his plan, and they inform the owner ([[James Brolin]]) of new million-dollar condos being sold across the street. Fearing the obstruction of his prospective purchasers' view, he buys the air rights to the club's property from Tess. She then uses the money to buy out Vince's share, pay off the bank, and redecorate the club in her own vision. Later, a sobered Nikki admits that she lied about sleeping with Vince out of anger, and Tess rehires her.\n\nAli rekindles her relationship with Jack after he tells her about breaking up with Natalie, as she cared more about her job than her relationship with him. Having earned Nikki's respect, Ali performs \"Show Me How You Burlesque\", a song written by Jack, with all of the dancers on stage, delighting the crowd.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300\n| image1 = Christina Aguilera at the premiere of Burlesque (2010).jpg\n| image2 = Cher at the premiere of Burlesque.jpg\n| image3 = Stanley Tucci 2017 Berlinale.jpg\n| image4 = Kristen Bell Frozen premiere 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Clockwise, from the top left: [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Cher]], [[Kristen Bell]], and [[Stanley Tucci]].\n}}\n\n{{Div col}}\n\n* [[Christina Aguilera]] as Alice Marilyn \"Ali\" Rose<ref>{{cite web |first=Sal |last=Morgan |url=http://www.novafm.com.au/Audio_Behind-the-scenes-of-Christina-Aguilera-s-Burlesque-movie_96541 |title=Behind the scenes of Christina Aguilera's Burlesque movie |publisher=Novafm.com |date=March 5, 2010 |access-date=March 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309114847/http://www.novafm.com.au/Audio_Behind-the-scenes-of-Christina-Aguilera-s-Burlesque-movie_96541 |archive-date=March 9, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] as Tess Scali\n* [[Cam Gigandet]] as John \"Jack\" Miller<!-- Where did the surname Miller come from? --><ref name=\"EDBT\" />\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Nikki<ref>{{cite web|first=Borys |last=Kit |title=Kristen Bell cast in 'Burlesque' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i731d7f0f9e7e4ab1d4d354dbf4f72b4d |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=October 8, 2009 |access-date=October 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009230815/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i731d7f0f9e7e4ab1d4d354dbf4f72b4d |archive-date=October 9, 2009}}</ref>\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Sean<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Fleming |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118009080.html |title=Stanley Tucci goes 'Burlesque' |work=Variety |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=September 23, 2009 |access-date=September 26, 2009}}</ref>\n* [[Eric Dane]] as Marcus Gerber<ref name=\"EDBT\" />\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Alexis<ref>{{cite news |first=Justin |last=Kroll |title=Alan Cumming |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118010801.html |work=Variety |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=October 21, 2009 |access-date=October 23, 2009}}</ref>\n* [[Julianne Hough]] as Georgia<ref>{{cite web |first=Joyce |last=Eng |title=Julianne Hough Grooves On With New Projects |url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Julianne-Hough-Grooves-1013110.aspx |work=[[TV Guide]] |date=December 14, 2009 |access-date=January 5, 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as Vincent \"Vince\" Scali<ref>{{cite web |first=Philip |last=Potempa |title=Peter Gallagher/ Hershey Felder ideal duo for Drury Lane Water Tower stage |url=http://nwitimes.com/entertainment/columnists/offbeat/article_2b49ed85-96b4-50fc-a896-695656f00886.html |publisher=[[The Times of Northwest Indiana]] |date=December 16, 2009 |access-date=January 5, 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Dianna Agron]] as Natalie\n* [[Glynn Turman]] as Harold Saint\n* [[David Walton (actor)|David Walton]] as Mark the DJ\n* [[Terrence J]] as Dave\n* Chelsea Traille as Coco\n* [[Tyne Stecklein]] as Jesse\n* [[Paula Van Oppen]] as Anna\n* [[Michael Landes]] as Greg\n* [[Tanee McCall]] as Scarlett\n* [[Blair Redford]] as James / Bumper Band Member\n* [[James Brolin]] as Mr. Anderson\n* [[Stephen Lee (actor)|Stephen Lee]] as Dwight\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nSteven Antin's sister [[Robin Antin|Robin]] was a member of the modern burlesque troupe [[the Pussycat Dolls]].<ref name=\"anniversary\">{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/movies/bendelacreme-jinkx-monsoon-happiest-season/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20201124110840/https://ew.com/movies/bendelacreme-jinkx-monsoon-happiest-season/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-11-24|title=Cher, Christina Aguilera sing justice for Burlesque, 10 years later|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|first=Joey|last=Nolfi|date=November 23, 2020|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref> Circa 2002, the group performed at [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|the Roxy Theatre]], West Hollywood, with multiple artists\u2014among them Christina Aguilera\u2014and Steven Antin directed some of these shows.<ref name=\"anniversary\"/> The first outline of the screenplay was written by Antin and Clint Culpepper, the [[Screen Gems|Screen Gems']] president.
