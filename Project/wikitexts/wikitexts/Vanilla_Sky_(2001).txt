Wearing a prosthetic mask, David tells his life story to court psychologist Dr. Curtis McCabe.\n\nIn flashbacks, David leaves the duties of the publisher to his father's trusted associates while [[Playboy lifestyle|living as a playboy]] in Manhattan. He is introduced to Sofia Serrano by his best friend, Brian Shelby, during a party. David and Sofia spend the night together at Sofia's apartment and fall in love, unaware that David's current lover, Julie Gianni, has followed them there. As David leaves, Julie offers him a ride, and soon reveals her jealousy of Sofia. She purposely crashes the car, killing herself and disfiguring David.\n\nDoctors cannot repair David's face using plastic surgery, forcing him to wear a prosthetic mask, but the mental and physical scarring from the accident causes him to become withdrawn and depressed. Brian convinces David to join him and Sofia at a club. They leave him in the street outside the club after he becomes drunk and insults them.\n\nThe next morning, Sofia returns and apologizes to David. She takes him home, the two form a relationship and he slowly begins to recover. Doctors find a way to repair David's face despite their prior prognosis. Later, he is plagued by bizarre experiences, such as brief flashbacks of his disfigurement and an encounter with a mysterious man at a bar who informs him that David is omnipotent, demonstrated by the entire bar falling silent at David's command. One day, while at Sofia's, David awakens to find himself in bed with Julie, whose face has replaced Sofia's in their photographs. In shock, he suffocates Julie. David is arrested and imprisoned and his facial disfigurement is mysteriously restored.\n\nDr. McCabe conducts several more interviews, which serve to help David to recall the name \"Life Extension\". Seeing a company with that name nearby, McCabe arranges to take David there under guard. Rebecca, a company representative, explains how Life Extension uses [[cryonic]] suspension to save those with terminal illnesses until a cure can be found, keeping them in a [[lucid dream]] state to otherwise exercise their mind. David realizes that he is in cryonic suspension and the world he inhabits is his own lucid dream, which has become a nightmare. He escapes McCabe and the guards while calling for \"tech support\", and rushes for the building's lobby, which is suddenly empty. An elevator opens, revealing the strange man from the bar.\n\nAs the elevator climbs to the top of an impossibly tall building, the man explains that he is Tech Support and that David has been in suspension for 150 years. Unable to face the twin traumas of the loss of his love, Sofia, and his facial injuries, he had opted for Life Extension to be woken when technology could repair his face, and left the publishing company in the hands of his father's associates. As part of the program, David had chosen to experience a lucid dream, in which his life would resume the morning after Sofia left him. However, a glitch in the software had caused other elements of his subconscious to distort his dream.\n\nThey emerge on the rooftop, high above the clouds. Tech Support tells David that while they have corrected the flaw, he now has a choice of either being returned to the dream or being restored to life, requiring a literal [[leap of faith]] off the roof that will wake him from his sleep. David chooses the latter, despite McCabe warning him against it. Before jumping, David envisions Brian and Sofia to say his goodbyes. He leaps from the edge of the building, and his life flashes before him.\n\nDavid snaps awake as a female voice invites him to open his eyes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as David Aames\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Sofia Serrano\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Julianna \"Julie\" Gianni\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Dr. Curtis McCabe\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Brian Shelby\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Edmund Ventura\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Thomas Tipp\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Rebecca Dearborn\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Aaron\n* [[Shalom Harlow]] as Colleen\n* [[Oona Hart]] as Lynette\n* [[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]] as Emma\n* [[Johnny Galecki]] as Peter Brown\n* [[Alicia Witt]] as Libby\n* [[Ken Leung]] as art editor\n* [[Conan O'Brien]] as himself\n* [[Tommy Lee]] as frozen vintage car man\n* [[Laura Fraser]] as The Future\n* [[Steven Spielberg]] as guest at David's party (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=In the days after completing ''[[Almost Famous]]'', the opportunity to keep our film-making team together was too attractive to pass up.

He meets McCabe in the restroom who tries to convince him that this is all a hoax and a con and that his case is going to trial. David tells him that he's only in his imagination. Much like in the theatrical cut, the Beach Boys' \"Good Vibrations\" plays, but this version makes it clear that David hears the music and that he chose it; meanwhile McCabe tries to convince him there is no music.\n\nAt this point, David dashes out of the restroom for the elevator the way he does in the theatrical cut, but the scene in the lobby is expanded: David shoots the police officer who is firing at him and is then surrounded by a SWAT team whom McCabe tries to talk down, but the SWAT team fires at both of them. They black out and wake up in the emptied lobby where McCabe continues to applaud what he believes is a performance while David gets into the elevator with Ventura, who tells him what happened at the end of his real life.\n\nOnce they reach the roof, McCabe reenters again and his pleas to David not to believe Ventura become more and more desperate until he collapses onto the ground in despair. David's interaction with Sofia is extended as he tells her he loves her but \"can't settle for a dream\". He then jumps off the building, screaming \"I want to wake up!\" as images from his life flash before his eyes. He wakes up in bed and a voice tells him \"Open your eyes.
