It is not lethal, but infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, resulting in people acting out their darkest impulses, which may include murder. Nevil Reed commits the first known case of murder driven by ID-7, but he was not deemed liable due to the virus' influence. Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting (TSC), found the loophole that won Reed's case, earning him a corner office. Derek began his job full of optimism, but quickly lost his moral compass climbing the corporate ladder, even neglecting his family.\n\nOne morning, Derek goes into work and meets with a desperate client - Melanie Cross - who needs more time on a loan. Derek thinks he cannot help and calls security on her. After discovering that a bungled legal case for massive company Vandacorp has been pinned on him by his superior Kara Powell (\"The Siren\", as she has the ear of company head John Towers), Derek confronts her. They plead their cases to Towers, who orders Derek fired. [[Human resource management|Human resource]] chief Lester \"The Reaper\" McGill offers a hefty [[severance package]] in return for Derek claiming responsibility. Derek, afraid of being disbarred and sued, rejects this, so security begins escorting Derek out.\n\nJust then, the building is put under quarantine as the ID-7 virus has been detected in the ventilation system. A neutralizing agent was released into the building, with an estimated eight hours for the virus to be obliterated. However, everyone in the building is infected in the meantime, resulting in chaos, violence and sex.\n\nDerek attempts to take the elevator upstairs to protest to Towers and the board of directors for his job back. Towers instead sends Derek to the basement to be beaten up by Towers' enforcer, Colton \"The Bull\" Snyder. Derek's friend Ewan arrives to help, but he is accidentally killed by the Bull, infuriating Derek further.\n\nDerek is locked up along with Melanie, who had resisted security. They quarrel but eventually decide to work together. Derek calls Vandacorp, ensuring his innocence in the mishandled case, and costing TSC a payment from Vandacorp. Realizing they will not be liable for their actions, Derek and Melanie grab weapons, intending to hold the people on the top floor responsible for their respective bad situations, but they require the Reaper and Kara's key cards to get there. Derek takes out two security guards sent to attack them.\n\nEn route to the Reaper, Derek incapacitates two more guards. The Reaper attacks them; Melanie kills him with a power saw. Derek and Melanie use his card to get up to Kara's office. They duel and brutalize five of Kara's coworkers. Kara offers her card for her safety, but her long-suffering assistant Meg has already destroyed it, having been offered a promotion to do it to protect those upstairs. Meg cuts out the Siren's tongue and kills her. Towers taunts Derek by urinating on Ewan's corpse. Melanie comforts Derek and they have sex.\n\nNeeding another method to get upstairs, Derek and Melanie convince the company's one IT worker to hack Irene Smythe's computer, getting her to come down. They offer Smythe's files in exchange for her card and a reversal of her original denial of Melanie's loan extension. Smythe refuses, stating that contracts signed during this period can be invalidated citing the virus. Melanie destroys Smythe's files. The Bull attacks Derek but is killed with a screwdriver. Smythe offers Derek top floor access in exchange for revenge on Melanie. Derek accepts, but sabotages Melanie's restraints. Melanie escapes and kills Smythe with a hammer.\n\nOn the top floor, Towers offers Derek a full partnership, but Derek refuses. Derek fends off Towers' assistants and battles Towers. TSC's board give him permission to kill Towers, so Derek punches him off the building to his death just as the quarantine is lifted.\n\nDerek accepts the board's offer of Towers' job. He extends Melanie's loan, then promptly quits the company, and is later seen painting with Melanie. He advises the audience to take control of their own lives before it's too late, accompanied by a shot of Towers hitting the ground.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steven Yeun]] as Derek Cho<ref name=\"casting1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/mayhem-1056841|title='Mayhem': Film Review|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=DeFore|first=John|date=November 9, 2017|access-date=April 13, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Samara Weaving]] as Melanie Cross<ref name=\"casting1\" />\n* [[Steven Brand]] as John \"The Boss\" Towers <ref name=\"casting1\" />\n* [[Caroline Chikezie]] as Kara \"The Siren\" Powell <ref name=\"casting1\" />\n* [[Kerry Fox]] as Irene Smythe<ref name=\"casting1\" />\n* [[Dallas Roberts]] as Lester \"The Reaper\" McGill <ref name=\"casting1\" />\n* [[Mark Frost (actor)|Mark Frost]] as Ewan Niles\n* Claire Dellamar as Meg\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Eriksen]] as Colton \"The Bull\" Snyder\n* Nikola Kent as Oswald\n* Lucy Chappell as Jenny\n* Olja Hrustic as CDC Official\n* Bojan Peric as Miles\n* Annamaria Serda as Brenda\n* Jovana Prosenik as Dena\n\n==Production==\nMayhem was filmed in Belgrade, Serbia in March, 2016 over 25 days.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/walking-dead-steven-yeun-mayhem-1201731806/|title='Walking Dead' Actor Steven Yeun to Star in Action Movie 'Mayhem'|last=Kroll|first=Justin|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 16, 2016|access-date=April 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Unleashing Mayhem: Director Joe Lynch Talks Corporate Horror, and the Joys of Shooting Outside of Hollywood Confines |url=https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/interviews/mayhem-joe-lynch-interview/ |website=MovieMaker Magazine |date=11 November 2017 |accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref> Joe Lynch explained in an interview the decision came down to cost, saying \"we had to find a place that would give us the most amount of days to shoot.
