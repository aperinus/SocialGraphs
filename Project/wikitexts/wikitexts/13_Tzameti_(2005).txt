''13 Tzameti'' is the feature-length directorial debut for Babluani. It also marks the acting debut of his younger brother Georges, who plays the film's protagonist S\u00e9bastien. The music was composed by East (Arnaud Taillefer) from the French band [[Troublemakers (French band)|Troublemakers]].\n\nThe film tells the story of a destitute immigrant worker who steals an envelope containing instructions for a mysterious job that could pay out a fortune. Following the instructions, the young man unwittingly becomes trapped in a dark and dangerous situation.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows 22-year-old S\u00e9bastien, a [[Georgians|Georgian]] immigrant living in France and working construction jobs to support his poor family. S\u00e9bastien works on the home of Godon, a feeble morphine addict who is under police surveillance. After Godon dies of an overdose, his widow informs S\u00e9bastien that she is unable to pay him. S\u00e9bastien then overhears the widow talking with one of Godon's friends, describing a mysterious \"job\" that Godon had lined up before his death. The destitute S\u00e9bastien steals an envelope containing the instructions for the job. The police begin following S\u00e9bastien as he uses the train ticket contained in the envelope.\n\nThe police lose track of S\u00e9bastien as he follows the instructions and is brought to a secluded house in a forest. At the house, a deadly gambling event is being organized by a powerful criminal. Though S\u00e9bastien's contacts immediately recognize that he is not Godon and has no idea what he is getting into, they force him to participate in the game. Thirteen men identified by number must undergo a series of [[Russian roulette]] games, arranging themselves into a circle and pointing their revolver at the man in front of them. Spectators place bets on who will survive. S\u00e9bastien, as #13, survives the first round and fires his gun only after threatened with death. On the second round, in which two bullets are placed in each gun, S\u00e9bastien survives only because the man behind him is killed before he could fire. On the third round, with three bullets in each gun, Sebastien survives along with three other men.\n\nThough he believes that he is finished, S\u00e9bastien is selected for the final \"duel\" game against #6, a cruel man who is managed by his own brother. S\u00e9bastien wins the duel and survives the game. He collects \u20ac850,000 out of the winnings his handlers have made from him, then flees the house. Fearing for his life, he sends the money home in a parcel before the police catch up with him. He tells the detective that he was turned away from the game and received no money, but gives the license plate number of a particularly unpleasant gambler in attendance. The police release him, but the brother of #6 spots him as he boards a train. The brother shoots S\u00e9bastien and steals his empty satchel. S\u00e9bastien collapses into a seat as the train begins to move.\n\n== Cast ==\n* George Babluani as S\u00e9bastien \n* [[Aur\u00e9lien Recoing]] as Jacky\n* [[Pascal Bongard]] as Le ma\u00eetre de c\u00e9r\u00e9monie\n* [[Fred Ulysse]] as Alain\n* {{Interlanguage link|Nicolas Pignon|fr}} as Le parrain\n* {{Interlanguage link|Vania Vilers|fr}} as Mr. Schlondorff\n* Philippe Passon as Jean Fran\u00e7ois Godon\n* Olga Legrand as Mme Godon\n* [[Augustin Legrand]] as Jos\u00e9\n* [[Jo Prestia]] as Pierre Bl\u00e9reau\n* [[Joseph Malerba]] as The accountant\n\n==Reception==\n{{As of|2020|06}}, the film holds an 84% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 67 reviews with an average rating of 7.04 out of 10.
