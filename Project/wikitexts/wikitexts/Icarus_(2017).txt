Rodchenkov creates a plan for Fogel to take banned performance-enhancing drugs in a way that will evade detection from drug-testing, helping Fogel's experiment to prove that the current way athletes are tested for drugs is insufficient. As Fogel continues his training, he and Rodchenkov become friends, and Rodchenkov eventually reveals that Russia has a [[Doping in Russia|state-sponsored Olympic doping program]] that he oversees.\n\nWhen allegations emerge in the international media over the possible existence of such a program, Fogel realizes that Rodchenkov is in danger of being \"[[List of journalists killed in Russia|silenced]]\" by the Russian government and has him flown to Los Angeles for his protection. Using Rodchenkov's knowledge of the doping program, they speak to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as the ''[[New York Times]]'', alleging that Russia has conspired to cheat in the Olympics for decades, and he was hired to ramp up the operation after the Russian team's embarrassing performance in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/sports/russia-doping-sochi-olympics-2014.html|title=Russian Insider Says State-Run Doping Fueled Olympic Gold |first1=Rebecca R.|last1=Ruiz|first2=Michael|last2=Schwirtz |date=May 12, 2016 |website=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn camera, Rodchenkov testifies that at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi, with the help of the [[Federal Security Service]], he and his team switched steroid-tainted urine of the [[Russia at the Olympics|Russian national team]] with clean samples, evading positive detection. He provides spreadsheets, discs, e-mails, and more incriminating evidence of Russian involvement, forcing the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] and the [[International Olympic Committee]] to investigate. After [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA's]] [[McLaren Report|independent investigation]] confirms Rodchenkov's claims, U.S. Law Enforcement places him in protective custody.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/10/wada-mclaren-russia-doping|title=Wada says database confirms McLaren report on Russia doping|first1=Sean|last1=Ingle|date=Nov 10, 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Rodchenkov's lawyer, [[James \"Jim\" Walden|Jim Walden]], appears briefly in the film describing the threats to Rodchenkov's life and the suspicious deaths of two of Rodchenkov's associates.<ref name=NetflixMC/><ref name=SundanceProject/>\n\nThe film ends stating that the Russian government continues to deny it had any involvement with the program and that Rodchenkov remains in protective custody.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10.
