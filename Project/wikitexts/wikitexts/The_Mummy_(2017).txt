In Iraq, [[U.S. Army]] Sergeant Nick Morton and Corporal Chris Vail discover the tomb of Princess Ahmanet, who in ancient times attempted to summon the deity [[Set (deity)|Set]]. She was then caught and [[mummy|mummified]] alive by Egyptian priests. They and archaeologist Jenny Halsey fly Ahmanet's [[sarcophagus]] to Britain, unknowingly bringing Ahmanet back to life.\n\nDuring the flight, Chris is possessed by Ahmanet through a spider that bit him and attacks the others, only to be killed by Nick. A large flock of crows attacks the plane, causing it to crash, killing the crew except for Jenny, who escapes with a parachute Nick gives her.\n\nNick returns to life in a morgue. Chris' ghost appears and tells him he has been cursed by Ahmanet who seeks to use him as a vessel for Set. Ahmanet's [[Mummy (undead)|mummy]] escapes from the sarcophagus and begins feeding on people to regenerate her body, turning them into zombies. She recovers the Dagger of Set and attempts to stab Nick, before realizing that the ruby is not attached to it. She and her army chase after Nick and Jenny until soldiers appear and subdue her.\n\nThe soldiers\u2019 leader, [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Henry Jekyll]], explains that Jenny is an agent of Prodigium, a [[secret society]] dedicated to hunting supernatural threats. Nick and Jenny discover that Jekyll intends to allow Set to possess Nick's body completely, believing that this will render Set vulnerable.\n\nJekyll transforms into [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Eddie Hyde]]. Nick stops him with a serum that Jekyll invented for this purpose, allowing Nick and Jenny to escape.  During the fight, an Easter egg is shown when one of the books that Nick throws at Mr. Hyde is shown to be the Book of the Dead from the previous film \u201cthe mummy.\u201c  Ahmanet finds them, regains the dagger, summons many crusader zombies, and creates a large sandstorm in London. The crusader zombies kill the Prodigium soldiers and Ahmanet recovers the ruby, combining it with the dagger in order to free Set.\n\nGuided by Chris' ghost, Nick and Jenny flee into the [[London Underground]], where Ahmanet's zombies attack them. Ahmanet captures Jenny and drowns her. When Nick is brought to Ahmanet, he sees Jenny's body, and the zombies turn to dust. Nick is injured when he tries to attack Ahmanet and lets her embrace him as a ruse to steal the dagger and shatter the ruby. He strikes the pommel of the dagger against the floor, cracking the ruby, but Ahmanet reminds him that the dagger could grant him the power to reverse death. Instead of destroying the gem, he stabs himself and his body is possessed by Set. Set goes to Ahmanet as he begins to take over, but as he looks at Jenny's dead body, Nick regains control after remembering both her and Jekyll's words, and uses Set's powers to extract Ahmanet's life-force, killing her. Struggling against Set, Nick also resurrects Jenny. Knowing that Prodigium are coming for him, he says goodbye to Jenny and vanishes.\n\nAs Ahmanet is sealed back in her tomb, Jenny and Jekyll wonder whether Nick, now fused with Set, will use his powers for good. Nick returns to the desert and resurrects Chris. The two go on an adventure to Egypt, hoping to find a cure to remove the curse, while being pictured riding horseback in the desert towards the [[Pyramids of Giza]] and creating an incoming sandstorm.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Alex Kurtzman, Sofia Boutella, Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe (34435877860).jpg|thumb|right|Director [[Alex Kurtzman]] with the film's main actors.

The former is a [[Metroidvania]] featuring a stand-alone story, which takes place concurrently with the events of the film and follows Prodigium soldiers under the command of Dr. Jekyll who fight the forces of Princess [[Ahmanet]], while the latter is a choose-your-own adventure game set after the events of the film, establishing the original [[Universal Monsters]] films as existing in its [[Canon
