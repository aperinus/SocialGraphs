The plot concerns an elderly couple (played by [[Victor Moore]] and [[Beulah Bondi]]) who are forced to separate when they lose their house and none of their five children will take both parents.\n\nThe film was written by [[Vi\u00f1a Delmar]], from a play by Helen and Noah Leary, which was in turn based on the novel ''The Years Are So Long'' by [[advice columnist]] [[Josephine Lawrence]]. McCarey viewed the film as his best, and it has been praised by later critics. In 2010, it was released selected for preservation by the United States [[Library of Congress]]'s [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nBarkley \"Bark\" ([[Victor Moore]]) and Lucy Cooper ([[Beulah Bondi]]) are an elderly couple who lose their home to [[foreclosure]], as Barkley has been unable to find employment because of his age. They summon four of their five children\u2014the fifth lives thousands of miles away in California\u2014to break the news and decide where they will live until they can get back on their feet. Only one of the children, Nell ([[Minna Gombell]]), has enough space for both, but she asks for three months to talk her husband into the idea. In the meantime, the temporary solution is for the parents to split up and each live with a different child.\n\nThe two burdened families soon come to find their parents' presence bothersome. Nell's efforts to talk her husband into helping are half-hearted and achieve no success, and she reneges on her promise to eventually take them. While Barkley continues looking for work to allow him and his wife to live independently again, he has little or no prospect of success. When Lucy continues to speak optimistically of the day that he will find work, her teenage granddaughter bluntly advises her to \"face facts\" that it will never happen because of his age. Lucy's sad reply is to say that \"facing facts\" is easy for a carefree 17-year-old girl, but that at Lucy's age, the only fun left is \"pretending that there ain't any facts to face ... so would you mind if I just kind of went on pretending?\"\n\nWith no end in sight to the uncomfortable living situations, both host families look for a way to get the parent they are hosting out of their house. When Barkley catches a cold, his daughter Cora ([[Elisabeth Risdon]]) seizes upon it as a pretext to assert that his health demands a milder climate, thus necessitating that he move to California to live with his daughter Addie.\n\nMeanwhile, son George ([[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]]) and his wife Anita ([[Fay Bainter]]) begin planning to move Lucy into a retirement home. Lucy accidentally finds out about their plans, but rather than force George into the awkward position of breaking the news to her, she goes to him first and claims that she wants to move into the home. Meanwhile, Barkley resigns himself to his fate of having to move thousands of miles away, though he too is entirely aware of his daughter's true motivation.\n\nOn the day Barkley is to depart by train, he and Lucy make plans to go out and spend one last afternoon together before having a farewell dinner with the four children. They have a fantastic time strolling around the city and reminiscing about their happy years together, even visiting the same hotel in which they had stayed on their honeymoon 50 years prior. Their day is made so pleasant partly because of the kindness of people they encounter, who, although strangers, seem to find them a charming couple, to genuinely enjoy their company, and to treat them with deference and respect\u2014in stark contrast to the treatment the two are receiving from their children.\n\nEventually Barkley and Lucy decide to continue their wonderful day by skipping the farewell dinner and dining at the hotel instead; when Barkley informs their daughter with a blunt phone call, it prompts introspection among the four children. Son Robert (Ray Meyer) suggests that each of the children has always known that collectively they are \"probably the most good-for-nothing bunch of kids that were ever raised, but it didn't bother us much until we found out that Pop knew it too.\" George notes that it is now so late in the evening that they won't even have time to meet their parents at the train station to send off their father. He says that he deliberately let the time pass until it was too late because he figured their parents would prefer to be alone. Nell objects that if they don't go to the station, their parents \"will think we're terrible,\" to which George matter-of-factly replies, \"Aren't we?\"\n\nAt the train station, Lucy and Barkley say their farewells to one another. On the surface, their conversation echoes Lucy's comments to her granddaughter about preferring to pretend, rather than facing facts. Barkley tells Lucy that he will find a job in California and quickly send for her; Lucy replies that she is sure he will do so.\n\nThey then offer each other a truly final goodbye, saying that they are doing so \"just in case\" they do not see each other again because \"anything could happen.\" Each makes a heartfelt statement reaffirming their lifelong love, in what seems an unspoken acknowledgment that it is almost certainly their final moment together. Barkley boards the train, and Lucy and he acknowledge each other and wave through the closed window as the train pulls away. A somber Lucy turns from the scene.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--in order of final film credits-->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Victor Moore]] as Barkley \"Pa\" Cooper\n* [[Beulah Bondi]] as Lucy \"Ma\" Cooper\n* [[Fay Bainter]] as Anita Cooper, George's wife\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as George Cooper, Barkley's and Lucy's son\n* [[Porter Hall]] as Harvey Chase, Nellie's husband\n* [[Barbara Read]] as Rhoda Cooper, George's and Anita's daughter\n* [[Maurice Moscovitch]] as Max Rubens, the Jewish shopkeeper and Barkley's friend\n* [[Elisabeth Risdon]] as Cora Payne, Barkley's and Lucy's daughter\n* [[Minna Gombell]] as Nellie Chase, Barkley's and Lucy's daughter\n* Ray Meyer as Robert Cooper, Barkley's and Lucy's son\n* Ralph Remley as Bill Payne, Cora's husband\n* [[Louise Beavers]] as Mamie, maid of George and Anita\n* [[Louis Jean Heydt]] as Barkley's doctor\n* [[Gene Morgan]] as Carlton Gorman, bandleader at the hotel\n* [[Dell Henderson]] as Ed Weldon, auto salesman (uncredited)\n* Louise Seidel as Hat Check Girl at the hotel (uncredited)\t\n* [[Paul Stanton (actor)|Paul Stanton]] as Mr. Horton, hotel manager (uncredited)\n* [[Ellen Drew]] as Usherette (uncredited)\t\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Victor Moore]] and [[Beulah Bondi]], who played \"Pa\" and \"Ma\", respectively, were both relatively young actors who wore [[make-up]] to appear older.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite AV media |title=Tomorrow, Yesterday, and Today |date=2010 |last=Bogdanovich |first=Peter |type=DVD |language=en |publisher=The Criterion Collection}}</ref>{{Rp|page=6:30}}\n\n==Reception==\nWriting for ''[[Night and Day (magazine)|Night and Day]]'' in 1937, [[Graham Greene]] gave the film a neutral review, summarizing it as \"a depressing picture about an old couple\".
