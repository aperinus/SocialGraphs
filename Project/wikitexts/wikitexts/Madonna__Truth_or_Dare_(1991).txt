Madonna approached Keshishian to do an [[HBO]] special on the tour after watching his [[Harvard University|Harvard]] senior project. Initially planned to be a traditional [[concert film]], Keshishian was so impressed with the backstage life that he persuaded Madonna to do a full film focusing on that. Madonna funded the project and served as executive producer. The film was edited to be in black-and-white, in order to emulate [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]], while the performance scenes were edited to be in color.\n\nIt was screened out of competition at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]] and was given a [[Limited theatrical release|limited release]] on May 10, 1991; two weeks later, it had its worldwide release. It opened to positive reviews, although certain scenes, such as one where Madonna visits her mother's grave, were criticized. Madonna was nominated for a [[Razzie Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. With a worldwide gross of $29 million, it was the highest-grossing documentary of all time, until ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' surpassed it in 2002. ''Truth or Dare'' has been noted as a groundbreaking film for its casual portrayal of [[homosexuality]], and was compared to the documentary ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]]'' (1990). It has also had an impact on [[reality television]] and [[celebrity culture]], inspiring parodies and other music-related documentaries.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe film begins on August 6, 1990, the day after the final show of the Blond Ambition World Tour in Nice, France. Madonna reminisces in her hotel room about the tour and how its completion would affect her later.\n\nIn a flashback to April 1990, the tour is about to kick off in Japan. Madonna did not realize that it was [[rainy season]]. Because of this, she and the dancers switch their tour costumes for warmer attire. In a voice-over, Madonna confesses that the only thing keeping her from \"slashing my wrists\" is the thought of returning to North America and performing the show as it is meant to be. In the United States, she meets the families of her dancers. Oliver Crumes, one of the dancers, sees his father for the first time in several years. In [[Los Angeles]], sound problems arise; despite reassurances, Madonna focuses on the technical problems and yells at her manager [[Freddy DeMann]] for allowing so many people from the music industry in the front rows. After the show, she meets with several celebrities; [[Kevin Costner]] offends her by calling the show \"neat\" and she pretends to gag after he leaves.<ref name=\"guily2\">{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=149}}</ref>\n\nOn the final [[Toronto]] show, the crew receives a visit from the local police who threaten to arrest Madonna for \"lewd and indecent display\", specifically the [[masturbation]] scene during the performance \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\"; she refuses to change the show. DeMann believes the threat of arrest will only make Madonna go further.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=51}}</ref> According to a news report, Toronto police decide not to arrest her, claiming that no threats were made.<ref name=\"EssaysWP\">{{cite web |last1=Harrington |first1=Richard |title=Essay |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1990/06/03/essay/832120d0-f6e5-472f-881b-aabb39f7d791/ |work=The Washington Post |access-date=September 15, 2019|date=June 3, 1990}}</ref> The next stop is Madonna's hometown of [[Detroit]].  In a voice-over, she expresses the difficulty she has going back home. At the end of \"[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]\", Madonna calls her father Tony on stage and sings \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\". Backstage, Tony and his wife Joan compliment the show, though Tony expresses his displeasure at some of the more \"burlesque\" aspects. Madonna and Christopher wait for their older brother Martin to show up while they discuss his substance abuse problems. Later, she reunites with her \"childhood idol\" Moira McFarland-Messana, who gives her a painting she made entitled \"Madonna and Child\", and asks her to be the godmother to her unborn child. Before leaving Detroit, Madonna visits her mother's grave for the first time since she was a little girl, as \"Promise to Try\" plays in the background. She lies down beside the grave as Christopher watches from afar.\n\nAs the tour continues, Madonna's throat problems worsen while [[Warren Beatty]] becomes more fed up with the cameras. During a throat examination in Madonna's hotel room, Beatty chastises her for the documentary, telling her the atmosphere is driving everyone insane. Madonna ignores him, and when she declines to have the rest of her examination done off camera, he starts laughing, saying, \"She doesn't want to live off-camera, much less talk... What point is there of existing off-camera?\". Due to her throat problems, she cancels some of her shows. In [[New York City|New York]], her doctor instructs her not to talk and she finds herself isolated in her apartment with only her assistant Melissa Crowe. Madonna is upset at losing contact with the dancers.\n\nThe third and final leg of the tour kicks off in [[Europe]] with everyone in better spirits. As the tour nears Italy, the [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] attempts to have it banned, forcing Madonna to cancel one of two shows in [[Rome]]. [[Sandra Bernhard]] appears to cheer up Madonna. Madonna tells Sandra that she's interested in meeting [[Antonio Banderas]]. When [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var|Almod\u00f3var]] throws a party in [[Madrid]], Madonna spends a week thinking up ways to seduce Banderas, but it turns out that he's married. While Madonna works in her hotel room, voice-overs from her family, friends, and co-workers describe the star. Though she is happier now than she was on her [[Who's That Girl Tour|last tour]], Sandra does not think that she takes enough time to enjoy her successes. Others describe her in unflattering terms. As the tour winds down, the group plays a game of [[Truth or Dare?]] and Madonna is dared to perform [[fellatio]] on a glass bottle. She's then asked who has been the  \"love of your life for your whole life?\", to which she replies without hesitation, \"[[Sean Penn|Sean]]. Sean\". She then invites her dancers and backup singers, one by one, to join her in bed, where she imparts \"words of wisdom\" to each. While the show's closing act, \"[[Keep It Together (Madonna song)|Keep It Together]]\", plays, a montage of Madonna saying good-bye to her dancers is shown. The film ends with a clip of Madonna telling director [[Alek Keshishian]] to go away and, \"Cut it, Alek! Cut it, Goddamnit!\"\n\n==Tour==\n{{main|Blond Ambition World Tour}}\n\n[[File:ExpressYourselfUnderGround (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Madonna, dressed in a bone colored corset with black pants, stretches out her left arm.
