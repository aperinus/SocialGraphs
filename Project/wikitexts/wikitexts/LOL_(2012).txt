When they return to school, after the summer, Lol discovers that Chad has cheated on her, so they break up.\n\nLol and Kyle realize they have feelings for each other and pursue a relationship. This is difficult as Chad is his best friend, and Lol's nemesis, Ashley, is a flirt, especially with Kyle. His and Chad's band, No Shampoo, wants to compete in the battle of the bands, but Kyle's father does not support his passion for music and feels that it interferes with his schoolwork. Chad's jealousy towards Lol and Kyle's new relationship further complicates things.\n\nLol's mother, Anne, is a divorc\u00e9e who frequently has sex with her ex-husband, Allen, until she discovers he has also been sleeping with another woman. Anne also begins to feel she and Lol are growing further apart. Lol throws a party and is caught by Anne who threatens to not allow her to go on her class trip to Paris. She is already grounded for the party.\n\nThings finally start to change when Anne meets police officer James and they begin to date. He offers her advice on how to reconnect with Lol, which she takes up. After a presentation at school, Lol looks for Kyle in the bathroom and overhears two people having sex in the stall. She assumes it is Kyle and Ashley after seeing a purse similar to Ashley's peeking out from under the stall. It was actually Emily and Wen hooking up, but Emily does not tell Lol because she is embarrassed she hooked up with him. Afterwards, Lol confronts Ashley, who does not deny it because she likes Kyle and wants to get in between Lol and Kyle's relationship.\n\nA huge argument ensues between Kyle and Lol, where Lol accuses Kyle of cheating, and they break up. When Kyle's father discovers Kyle has lied about his grades and smoked pot, he grounds him and destroys his guitar. After the break-up, Lol is determined to make Kyle jealous, and tries to do so by making out with her childhood friend Jeremy. Meanwhile, she and her mom reconnect, and Anne allows Lol to go on the class trip to Paris.\n\nWhile on the Paris trip, Emily finally admits to Lol it was actually her and Wen in the bathroom, not Ashley and Kyle. After this realization, Lol and Kyle reconcile and Lol spends the night with Kyle and they have sex for the first time.\n\nWhen they all return home, Chad and Kyle rekindle their friendship and he gives his blessing to Kyle and Lol. Lol sticks up for Ashley when Chad insults her, resulting in them become friends. Meanwhile, Anne finds Lol's diary and discovers that Lol has slept with Kyle and smoked pot. Confronting Lol, they have a huge falling-out, and Lol moves in with her father.\n\nEventually, Lol and Anne reconcile and Lol moves back in with her mother. Kyle's band wins the battle of the bands and his father finally begins to support his musical aspirations. Kyle and Lol stay together. Ashley and Chad begin to date and Emily and Wen are together as she is no longer embarrassed to be with him. The film ends with Anne and Lol laughing out loud while cuddling.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Miley Cyrus]] as Lola \"Lol\" Williams\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Anne Williams\n* [[Ashley Hinshaw]] as Emily\n* [[Ashley Greene]] as Ashley\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as James\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as Allen Williams\n* [[Marlo Thomas]] as Gran Williams\n* [[Douglas Booth]] as Kyle Ross\n* [[George Finn]] as Chad\n* [[Lina Esco]] as Janice\n* Tanz Watson as Lloyd\n* [[Adam Sevani]] as Wen\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Emily's mother\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Kathy\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Roman\n* [[Austin Nichols]] as Mr. Ross\n* [[Jean-Luc Bilodeau]] as Jeremy\n* [[Brady Tutton]] as Jackson\n* Terdman as Concert Groupie\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] began on July 16, 2010, in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=LOL filming in Dearborn, MI today|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2010/07/16/lol-filming-in-dearborn-mi-today/|work=On Location Vacations|access-date=December 27, 2013|author=Christine|date=July 16, 2010}}</ref> ''LOL'' was primarily filmed at [[Grosse Pointe South High School]] in the city of [[Grosse Pointe]], a suburb northeast of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Monaghan|first=John|title=OMG!
