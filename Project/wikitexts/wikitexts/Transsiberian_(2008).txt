It stars [[Woody Harrelson]] and [[Emily Mortimer]] as an American couple whose journey on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] leads them to a trail of deception and murder. [[Kate Mara]], [[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]], [[Thomas Kretschmann]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nAfter premiering at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]] in January, the film received a limited release in the United States on July 18, 2008. It received positive reviews, with praise for its story and atmosphere, and grossed $5.9 million at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nAn American couple, Roy and Jessie, take the train from [[Beijing]] to [[Moscow]] on their return home from a Christian mission in [[China]]. Roy befriends their cabin mates, a Spanish man, Carlos, and his Seattle-born girlfriend, Abby. Jessie does not share her husband's warmth but Carlos shows Jessie his souvenir [[matryoshka doll]]s.\n\nWhen Roy misses the train in [[Irkutsk]] while sightseeing, Jessie is alone with Carlos and Abby. She gets off the train at [[Ilansky (town)|Ilanskaya]] to wait for Roy. Carlos and Abby get off too, claiming she would be unsafe alone. In a restaurant, Jessie sees a doll nearly identical to those of Carlos. Abby is upset when she mentions this and goes to bed. Jessie begs Carlos not to involve Abby in his activities.\n\nThe next morning, Carlos comes to Jessie's room, tells her his shower is broken and asks to use hers. Jessie receives a summons from reception and leaves Carlos in her room. At reception, she receives a call confirming that Roy will join her, and Carlos convinces her to go on a trip into the wilderness, where they find a ruined church.\n\nJessie, an amateur photographer, starts taking pictures. When Carlos makes advances, she first refuses but then surrenders. They begin kissing, but she changes her mind and asks him to stop. He continues, becomes aggressive and chases her. She becomes terrified and kills him with a fence post. She returns to the station and rejoins Roy on the train.\n\nIlya Grinko, a narcotics officer whom Roy befriended, is their new cabin mate. Jessie finds Carlos' dolls in her suitcase and realizes that he hid them when he was in her room. Talking to Grinko, Jessie realizes that Carlos was smuggling heroin, and unsuccessfully tries to get rid of the dolls. She panics when Grinko becomes suspicious. When she returns to her cabin to find Roy examining the dolls, she breaks down and explains their origins, though without telling Roy about Carlos' death. They give Grinko the dolls, who seems satisfied they were uninvolved.\n\nThe next morning, they awake to discover that most of the carriages have departed, with the passengers; only Grinko and his partner Kolzak Yushenkov remain. They stop the train in the middle of nowhere and take Jessie and Roy to an abandoned military bunker, where Abby is being tortured. Grinko is bribed by a Russian drug lord and explains that Carlos stole [[heroin]] and money from the drug lord who wants both. Grinko tells Jessie that Abby is not the \"good girl\" Jessie thought: she recruited Carlos, was responsible for another\u2019s death and is trying to cheat the drug lord. Jessie disbelieves Grinko because Carlos told her Abby was innocent. Abby has been tortured by Grinko, and continues to be tortured in the presence of Jessie and Roy.\n\nJessie and Roy escape and return to the train, where they find the conductor, who works for Grinko. Roy kills him. They escape with the train because Roy, a railway enthusiast, knows how to operate it. The train slows down and Grinko and Kolzak re-board the train. When they question Jessie again about Carlos' whereabouts, holding her and Roy at gunpoint, Jessie admits she killed Carlos. Kolzak does not believe her, but at that moment, the train collides with a troop-carrying train. With the army on the way, Grinko shoots Kolzak to maintain his cover. The couple are arrested, while Grinko escapes.\n\nIn Moscow, U.S. officials visit Jessie and Roy. Through a photograph Jessie took of Grinko and his associates, the officials believe they can shut down the drug operation. They reveal Carlos' criminal history and believe Abby just got mixed up with the wrong crowd. When signing statements, Jessie does not confess she killed Carlos, although Roy may have heard her admit to this. Touring Moscow, Jessie insists on talking to Abby in the hospital.\n\nThe final scene shows Abby finding Carlos' body. She takes a fortune in stolen money from his jacket.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Transsiberian-Pressekonferenz 0974.jpg|thumb|Thomas Kretschmann, Brad Anderson, Eduardo Noriega, Ben Kingsley, and Julio Fern\u00e1ndez at press conference for the film at Berlinale 2008.]]\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Roy\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Jessie\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Grinko\n* [[Kate Mara]] as Abby\n* [[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]] as Carlos\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Kolzak\n* [[\u00c9tienne Chicot]] as French passenger.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in Lithuania.
