Crumb]] and his family (including his two brothers) and his outlook on life. Directed by [[Terry Zwigoff]] and produced by [[Lynn O'Donnell]], it won widespread acclaim. It was released in the USA on April 28, 1995, having been screened at film festivals (and winning the Documentary Prize at [[The Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]]) that year. Jeffery M. Anderson (later critic for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'') placed the film on his list of the ten greatest films of all time, labeling it \"the greatest documentary ever made.\"<ref>Anderson, Jeffrey M.

He begins a speech at an art school by mentioning the three things he is probably best known for (those being the \"[[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']]\" strip from 1968, the ''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]'' (1968) album cover, and [[Fritz the Cat]]), before spending much of the rest of the film detailing his distaste for modern American [[consumerist culture]] and his darkly cynical perspective on life. He is seen sketching his surroundings at caf\u00e9s and on sidewalks, attending an exhibition of his work, and interacting with friends and family.\n\nViewers learn about Robert's career through interviews with his contemporaries [[Don Donahue]], [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[Bill Griffith]], and [[Trina Robbins]], as well as critics [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] and [[Deirdre English]], who also discuss the controversy surrounding many of Robert's depictions of women and African-Americans. Robert's ex-wife Dana and ex-girlfriends [[Kathy Goodell]] and [[Dian Hanson]] provide additional insights into his personality. Much information about Robert's childhood is derived from scenes of him in conversation with his mother Beatrice, older brother [[Charles Crumb|Charles]], and younger brother [[Maxon Crumb|Maxon]] (Robert's two sisters declined to be interviewed for the film). Charles, whom Robert acknowledges as his main artistic influence, no longer draws, has never lived on his own, and takes prescription [[psychiatric medications]] to help stabilize his mental state (he committed suicide before the film was released<ref name=EW>{{cite web|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|title=A new documentary focuses on Robert Crumb -- ''Crumb'' highlights the cartoonist's dysfunctional family|author=Lovece, Frank|date=June 2, 1995|author-link=Frank Lovece|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1995/06/02/new-documentary-focuses-robert-crumb}}</ref>). [[Maxon Crumb|Maxon]], who has a [[seizure disorder]] he says is triggered by feelings of [[sexual arousal]], lives an [[ascetic]] life in a dilapidated hotel, meditating, begging on the street, and occasionally drawing or painting. All three brothers mention the authoritarian behavior of their father and talk about the comic books Charles made them make when they were children.\n\nRobert is shown drawing with Sophie and Jesse, his son with Dana, with whom Robert has become reacquainted after abandoning his family to move to [[San Francisco]] when the boy was young. He invites Jesse to visit him in France, but his main concern regarding the move is about how his records will fare. After the moving men cart off his collection, Robert is distracted from his worries just long enough to take a phone call and reject an offer to make an [[animated film]] based on his character [[Mr. Natural (character)|Mr. Natural]].\n\n==Production==\nRobert Crumb initially did not want to make the film, but eventually agreed. There was a rumor, accidentally created by [[Roger Ebert]], that Terry Zwigoff, who was friends with Crumb, made Crumb cooperate by threatening to shoot himself. Ebert later clarified this in an [[audio commentary]] he did with Zwigoff in 2006 and a review he wrote in 2005, where he said: \"That never happened, but it may be true that Zwigoff\u2019s life was saved because he did make the film.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">Ebert, Roger (November 20, 2005).

In the commentary Zwigoff did with Ebert, he says that Lynch did not respond to a request for funds until after the film was already finished, but they agreed to include Lynch's name in the advertising and credits to attract more viewers.\n\n==Reception==\n''Crumb'' was met with wide acclaim from critics, earning a 95% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 43 reviews, with an average score of 8.4/10.
