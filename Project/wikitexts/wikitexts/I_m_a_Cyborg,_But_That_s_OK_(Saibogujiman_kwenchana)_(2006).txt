Young-goon, a young woman working in a factory constructing radios and who believes herself to be a cyborg, is institutionalized after [[Self-harm|cutting her wrist]] and connecting it with a power cord to a wall outlet in an attempt to \"recharge\" herself, an act that is interpreted as a [[suicide attempt]]. Her delusion is characterized by refusing to eat (she instead licks batteries and attempts to administer electric shocks to herself), conversing almost solely with machines and electrical appliances, and obsessively listening to her [[vacuum tube|tube]] [[radio]] at night for instruction on how to become a better cyborg. Her apathetic mother is interviewed by the institute's head doctor, to determine the roots of Young-goon's psychosis; despite claiming ignorance of her daughter's delusion (it is later learnt she knew but was too busy to make her seek help), she reveals that Young-goon's mentally ill grandmother had previously been institutionalized for delusions of being a mouse, a trauma that sparks Young-goon's own lapses from reality. As a result, she frequently fantasizes of finding her grandmother and seeking revenge on the \"men in white\" who took her away.\n\nIl-soon, a young male patient hospitalized for [[anti-social behavior]] and [[kleptomania]] (stemming from [[schizophrenia]]) becomes fascinated with Young-goon; he is described as having \"no sympathy\" for his fellow man, believes he can \"steal\" other people's souls/attributes, and frequently wears handmade rabbit masks. He fears that he will eventually \"shrink into a dot\" and is seen compulsively brushing his teeth when nervous or upset. His habit of covertly taking the traits of his fellow inmates makes him the frequent target of scorn, but he only takes the traits willingly and returns them to their owners after he is done.\n\nWhen Young-goon persuades Il-soon to take away her \"sympathy\" in order for her to be able to kill the men in white, she has a hallucination of going on a rampage, killing the doctors and orderlies of the hospital. When she is given shock treatment owing to her refusal to eat, she believes that she has been recharged. In reality, her physical condition begins to deteriorate rapidly, and the doctors begin force-feeding her to keep her alive. Il-soon, now wracked with sympathy for Young-goon, hatches an elaborate plan to get her to eat, convincing her that he can install a food-to-electrical-energy conversion unit, calling it a rice-megatron, in her back. After eating her first meal at the hospital, and confiding her secrets to the head doctor, Young-goon ponders the meaning of a recurring dream in which her grandmother explains to her the purpose of her existence. Interpreting the lip-read message as that she is in fact a \"nuke bomb\" that requires a bolt of lightning to detonate, she goes out into a horrendous storm with Il-soon, intending to use her radio's antenna as a lightning rod.\n\nIn the middle of the storm, the wind blows their tent away, prompting them to hastily protect their food supplies. Il-soon, hearing Young-goon's complaints about the opened wine collecting rain, plugs it with his little finger. Unknown to Young-goon, it is shown Il-soon placed the missing cork atop the makeshift lightning rod, protecting her from lightning. Sitting together as the sun rises, the duo soon embrace under a rainbow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]] as Park Il-soon\n* [[Im Soo-jung]] as Cha Young-goon\n* [[Choi Hee-jin]] as Dr. Choi Seul-gi\n* [[Lee Yong-nyeo]] as Young-goon's mother\n* [[Yoo Ho-jeong]] as Il-soon's mother\n* [[Lee Ji-hyun (actress, born 1972)|Lee Ji-hyun]] as Young-goon's aunt\n* [[Kim Byeong-ok]] as Judge\n\n==Development==\n''I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK'' is the first Korean film to use the Viper FilmStream Camera.<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932738/|title=I'm a Cyborg, but That's OK|last=Elley|first=Derek|date=9 February 2007|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=30 April 2013|archive-url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jMxWQTjxhAkJ:www.variety.com/review/VE1117932738/|archive-date=1 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK'' received generally positive reviews.

He characterized the movie as \"part ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest]]'', part ''[[Amelie]]''\" and praised it for \"pure cinematic exuberance, quirky humor, [and] exceedingly likeable characters\". Tarun hypothesized that ''Cyborg'''s relatively poor box office performance was due to its [[genre-busting]]: \"The film has a slower pace than the director\u2019s previous works and it strikes a strange hybrid tone where it is far too cute to be like his dark revenge flicks, but it\u2019s a bit too dark and odd to be a cute romantic date film.
