It stars [[Doris Day]] and [[Rock Hudson]] and is their second time working together. The supporting cast includes [[Tony Randall]], [[Edie Adams]], [[Ann B. Davis]], and [[Donna Douglas]].\n\nDay, Hudson and Randall appeared in three movies together, the others being ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959) and ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]'' (1964).\n\nThe story is similar to that of ''Pillow Talk'' in that it includes mistaken identity as a key plot device. Although not as well known as ''Pillow Talk'', the script by [[Stanley Shapiro]] and [[Paul Henning]] earned an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a New York advertising agency, Jerry Webster, a [[Madison Avenue]] ad executive, has achieved success not through hard work or intelligence but by wining and dining his clients, even setting them up on dates with attractive girls.\n\nJerry's equal and sworn enemy at a rival agency is Carol Templeton. Although she has never met him, Carol is disgusted by Jerry's unethical tactics and reports him to the [[Ad Council]]. Jerry avoids trouble with his usual aplomb, sending a comely chorus girl, Rebel Davis, to seduce the council members.\n\nIn exchange for her cooperation, Jerry promised Rebel a spot in commercials, so he goes ahead and arranges shoots of some featuring her for \"VIP\", a nonexistent product. He has no intention of allowing them to be shown, but the perplexed company president, Pete Ramsey, orders them broadcast on television.\n\nThis means Jerry must come up with a product quickly. So, he bribes a chemist, Dr. Linus Tyler, to create one. When Carol mistakes Jerry for Tyler, he pretends to be the chemist, so that in her attempt to steal the account from Jerry, she is actually wining, dining, golfing, and frolicking at the beach with him as Tyler.\n\nCarol ultimately learns the truth. Appalled, she once more reports him to the Ad Council, this time for promoting a product that does not exist. Jerry, however, arrives at the hearing with VIP, a mint-flavored candy Dr. Tyler has just created. He provides many free samples to everyone there, including Carol.\n\nVIP turns out to be [[Drunkenness|intoxicating]], each piece having the same effect as a triple [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]]. Its extreme effects lead to a [[one-night stand]] between Carol (who has a low tolerance for alcohol) and her bitter rival, Jerry, in a motel in Maryland, complete with a marriage license.\n\nCarol has the marriage annulled. Representatives from the liquor industry visit Jerry, saying he will be paid well to pull VIP off the market and destroy the formula. Jerry convinces them to give Carol's firm 25% of its $60 million (${{Inflation|US|60|1961|r=-2|fmt=c}} million today) annual advertising expenditures, then burns the formula. He leaves New York to work in his company's San Francisco branch\u2014only to be called back nine months later to remarry Carol in a hospital maternity ward, just before she gives birth to their child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rock Hudson]] as Jerry Webster \n* [[Doris Day]] as Carol Templeton\n* [[Tony Randall]] as Peter 'Pete' Ramsey \n* [[Edie Adams]] as Rebel Davis \n* [[Jack Oakie]] as J.

The author was renowned crime and western novelist [[Marvin Albert|Marvin H. Albert]], who also made something of a cottage industry out of movie tie-ins. He seems to have been the most prolific screenplay novelizer of the late '50s through mid '60s, and, during that time, the preeminent specialist at light comedy.\n\n==Notes==\n* Jack Oakie's final film\n* The original ending had Carol and Jerry getting drunk on VIP and checking into a hotel. Doris Day insisted the concluding events be rewritten, having Carol and Jerry get married in their drunken state before going to bed.\n* Remade into [[Zoom (2016 Kannada film)]]\n*Remade into the 1984 film \u201cwahda bi whada\u201d starring Adel Imam and Mervat Ameen.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"one of the brightest, most delightful satiric comedies since '[[It Happened One Night]].'\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=February 9, 1962 |title=Screen: 'Lover Come Back' Opens at Music Hall |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=21 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' declared, \"This is a funny, most-of-the-time engaging, smartly produced show.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 13, 1961 |title=Lover Come Back |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 }}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' gave the film a rating of \"GOOD\", adding: \"It's lots of fun most of the time even though the theme of boy fights girl, boy falls in love with girl and vice versa has been done quite often and in similar detail before.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 2, 1961 |title='Lover Come Back' with Rock Hudson, Doris Day, Tony Randall |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |page=191 }}</ref> Philip K.

After it, the sex comedy is transformed into slushy romance ...
