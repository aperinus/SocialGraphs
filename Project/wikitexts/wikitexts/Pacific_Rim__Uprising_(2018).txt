DeKnight]] (in his [[List of directorial debuts|feature-film directorial]] and writing debut), and written by DeKnight, [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]], Kira Snyder and [[T.S. Nowlin]]. It is the sequel to the 2013 film ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' and the second film in the ''Pacific Rim'' franchise, with [[Guillermo del Toro]], the director of the original, serving as a producer. [[Legendary Pictures]] produced the film alongside Double Dare You Productions. The sequel stars [[John Boyega]] (also making his producer debut), as well as [[Scott Eastwood]], [[Cailee Spaeny]] (in her film debut), [[Jing Tian]], [[Adria Arjona]] and [[Zhang Jin (actor)|Zhang Jin]], with [[Rinko Kikuchi]], [[Charlie Day]], and [[Burn Gorman]] returning from the original film. The film takes place in 2035, ten years after the events of the original film. The story follows Jake Pentecost, who is given one last chance to live up to his father's legacy after [[Kaiju]], giant sea monsters, are unleashed back into the world and aim to destroy it.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in November 2016 in [[Australia]]. The film's world premiere was held at [[Vue West End]] on March 15, 2018, and was released in the United States on March 23, 2018, by [[Universal Pictures]] (unlike its predecessor, which was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]), in 2D, [[RealD 3D]], [[IMAX]] 3D, and IMAX formats. With a gross of $290 million worldwide, the film was a box office disappointment.<ref name=opening/> It also received mixed reviews; many critics considered it inferior to del Toro's film and criticized the scope, pacing, story, as well as the absent characters from the previous film and the underdeveloped new characters, though others praised the visual effects and performances of Boyega, Eastwood and Spaeny.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/pacific-rim-uprising-film-review-john-boyega-sequel-a8266091.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220524/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/pacific-rim-uprising-film-review-john-boyega-sequel-a8266091.html |archive-date=May 24, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=''Pacific Rim Uprising'' review round up: Here's what the critics are saying|first=Jacob |last=Stolworthy|work=[[The Independent]]|date=March 21, 2018|access-date=March 21, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/pacific-rim-uprising-box-office-beating-black-panther-1202734775/|title=Box Office: 'Pacific Rim Uprising' to Unseat 'Black Panther' With Modest $23 Million|last=McNary|first=Dave|author-link=Dave McNary|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=March 30, 2018|access-date=March 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 2035, ten years after the Battle of the Breach, in which the interdimensional portal created by the Precursors (through which they sent marauding Kaiju) was closed,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' (2013)}} former Jaeger pilot Jake Pentecost\u2014son of Stacker Pentecost\u2014makes a living by stealing and selling Jaeger parts on the [[black market]] in [[Santa Monica, California]]. After he tracks part of a disabled Jaeger's power core to the secret workshop of fifteen-year-old Jaeger enthusiast Amara Namani, both are apprehended by the Pan-Pacific Defense Corps (PPDC) following an altercation between Amara's originally made small, single-pilot Jaeger ''Scrapper'' and the law enforcement Jaeger ''November Ajax''. Jake's adoptive sister and PPDC Secretary General Mako Mori persuades him to return to PPDC as an instructor to avoid prison, with Amara as his recruit.\n\nArriving at the China Shatterdome, Jake starts training Jaeger program cadets with his estranged former co-pilot Nathan \"Nate\" Lambert. Nate and Mako explain that the Jaeger program is threatened by the Shao Corporation's new drone program, which offers to mass-produce Jaeger drones developed by Liwen Shao and Dr. Newton 'Newt' Geiszler. Mako is due to deliver a final assessment to determine the approval of the drones at a PPDC council meeting in Sydney, but is killed by a rogue Jaeger, ''Obsidian Fury,'' during an altercation with the latter and ''Gipsy Avenger,'' Jake and Nate's Jaeger, before she can. Her death prompts the PPDC council to authorize and deploy the drones immediately. ''Obsidian'' escapes into the ocean before backup Jaegers can apprehend it.\n\nMoments before her death, Mako had transmitted the location of a defunct Jaeger production facility in Siberia. Jake and Nate travel there in ''Gipsy Avenger'', but ''Obsidian Fury'' destroys the complex and engages them in battle. Although ''Obsidian Fury'' initially has the upper hand, ''Gipsy Avenger'' outsmarts and is able to overpower the Jaeger. Upon destroying its reactor, they find that ''Obsidian Fury'' was controlled not by humans, but by a Kaiju's secondary brain, which testing shows was grown on Earth.\n\nWhen the drones reach their respective locations, their piloting operations are hijacked by cloned Kaiju brains secretly mounted onboard. The Kaiju-Jaeger hybrids simultaneously attack all Pacific Rim Shatterdomes, inflicting heavy casualties and incapacitating almost all Jaegers. Newt and Dr. Hermann Gottlieb try to disable the drones, but the latter discovers that the former is behind the attack when he commands the Kaiju-Jaeger hybrids to open multiple breaches across the Pacific Rim. Newt's mind has been possessed by the Precursors\u2014who forged a link when he and Hermann drifted with Kaiju brains{{efn|name=Timeline}}\u2014and reveals that he created ''Obsidian Fury'' and orchestrated Mako's assassination to ensure the Precursors' plan would proceed. Although Liwen is able to destroy the drones, closing the breaches (and killing various Kaijus in the process), three creatures, Hakuja, Shrikethorn, and Raijin had already emerged and reached [[Tokyo]]. The team realizes that the Precursors' true goal is to detonate [[Mount Fuji]] with the Kaijus' blood which will cause every volcano lining the [[Ring of Fire]] to erupt. The amount of volcanic matter it releases into the [[atmosphere]] will then wipe out all life on Earth, simultaneously [[terraforming]] the planet for Precursor [[colonization]].\n\nThe cadets are mobilized while Hermann and Liwen repair the PPDC's four salvageable Jaegers; Hermann develops Kaiju-blood-powered rockets, which launch the team to Tokyo. Although the Jaegers, including ''Gipsy Avenger'', initially repel the three Kaiju, Newt merges them into a \"Mega-Kaiju\" using robotic parasites from one of Liwen's factories. Three of the four Jaegers are destroyed, critically damaged, or rendered inoperable, leaving ''Gipsy Avenger'' as the only one remaining. Jake and Amara, replacing the injured Nate, pilot it against the Mega-Kaiju, with Liwen remote piloting ''Scrapper'' and aiding them by locating a rocket and welding it to ''Gipsy'', which sends the Jaeger (with ''Scrapper'' holding on) into the atmosphere and free-falling back to Earth, colliding into the Mega-Kaiju and killing it at the last second; Jake and Amara survive by transferring to ''Scrapper''. Furious at the Mega-Kaiju's death, Newt attempts to initiate a secondary plan but is knocked out and captured by Nate.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Jake speaks to an incarcerated Newt, who warns that the Precursors will return. Jake vows that next time, humanity will turn the tables and take the fight to the Precursors, to defeat them once and for all.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast credited in closing tombstones - using order, spelling and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[John Boyega]] as Jake Pentecost, the son of Stacker Pentecost, the adoptive younger brother of Mako, and Nate and Amara's partner.<ref name=\"BoyegaCast\" /><ref name=\"Kikuchi-and-Urban\">{{cite web|url=http://omegaunderground.com/2017/01/09/rinko-kikuchi-and-karl-urban-are-in-pacific-rim-uprising-character-names-revealed/|title=Rinko Kikuchi and Karl Urban Are In 'Pacific Rim Uprising';
