B. Bernstein]] is a big-time [[sports agent]] who, along with his partner [[Ash Vasudevan]], recently formed their own company. Unfortunately, all of J. B.'s clients have retired, and he is unable to reel in star football player Popo Vanuatu. Desperate to find new clients, J. B. realizes India, with over one billion people, has real potential for untapped baseball talent. He approaches investor Mr. Chang with his proposal\u2014a talent contest staged in India called \"Million Dollar Arm.\" Contestants score points by demonstrating they can pitch a baseball with speed and accuracy. Along with the prize money, two winners will be flown to the U.S. and receive coaching to become legitimate baseball prospects within two years. Chang commits to providing the funding, on the condition the prospects are ready within only one year. With no alternative, J. B. reluctantly assures Chang the winners will be ready for a major-league try-out within one year.\n\nJ. B. approaches veteran [[baseball]] [[Pitch (baseball)|pitching]] coach [[Tom House]] who explains that [[cricket]], the main sport played in India, and baseball have very different motions for [[Bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and pitching, and getting a good recruit ready for a try-out in one year is extremely unlikely, if not impossible. J. B. points how House has nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking up the challenge, and House agrees.\n\nWhile Ash and Theresa, their assistant, hold down the fort in Los Angeles, J. B. flies to India. Despite support from Vivek, his guide in India, J. B. is bewildered by the traffic, the overcrowding, and the lax way Indians conduct business. He is joined by the curmudgeonly Ray Poitevint, a longtime major league scout, and hires Amit Rohan as his interpreter. After lengthy try-outs in numerous cities, two youngsters emerge as the winners \u2014 [[Rinku Singh (wrestler)|Rinku Singh]] and [[Dinesh Patel]], and they are flown to the U.S. to begin their baseball training. The pair, who grew up in poverty in India and do not speak or understand English, are instantly overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of America, although Rinku immediately develops a liking for [[pizza]]. Things soon come to a crunch when they are detained by hotel security for messing with elevator emergency controls, inadvertently getting themselves stuck and setting off the fire alarm. J. B. is subsequently forced to invite them to stay at his home. For their baseball training, J. B. dumps the pair by House and his staff while he runs off to close more deals. In being treated so, the pair feels like social outcasts. J. B.'s tenant Brenda Fenwick is the only person who genuinely seems interested in their well-being.\n\nWhen J. B. takes the boys and Amit to a party thrown by Popo, whom J. B. hopes to sign, things get worse when Amit gets drunk after accidentally drinking a [[margarita]] mistaking it for punch while Rinku becomes sick from [[overeating]] and as a result, both [[vomit]] on J. B.'s [[windshield]], forcing an enraged J. B. to drive them home, and forfeit the deal with Popo, who signed with someone else. Brenda calms him down and makes him realize he is treating the two boys like a business deal. The next day, J. B., no longer able to afford the payments on his [[Porsche]], trades it in for a [[Dodge Caravan]] and joins the boys for their prayers. Ignoring J. B.'s pleas of the two boys' lack of readiness, Chang insists his terms be fulfilled and the boys demonstrate their baseball skills one year from the time they arrived in the US. [[ESPN]], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', and local media are joined by numerous major-league scouts to watch the boys pitch. The try-out is a complete disaster, as the pair is both very nervous and pitch without speed or control, failing to impress anyone. Chang is happy with Million Dollar arm success, but the two boys are done.\n\nBrenda convinces J. B. that the boys be given another try-out. Chang refused to go along with it, and no scouts are interested in wasting their time on another fiasco. All hope is lost until Ray arranges for J. B. to meet the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] head scout who was away in [[Puerto Rico]] for the first try-out, and agrees to come. Chang changes his mind and sees the second try-out of Singh and Patel. This time, J. B. insists the boys relax and have fun. The scouts are quickly impressed as the pair consistently deliver 90+&nbsp;mph [[fastballs]] thrown accurately, and both are offered a contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, plus synopsis mentions and exact roles, such as \u201cJB\u201d vs J.

Using original footage they had shot, they created a nine-minute trailer as a presentation piece for a projected movie about the two players. In December 2008, the Mandts began a collaboration with producers [[Mark Ciardi]], Gordon Gray and [[Joe Roth]]. In early 2009, the screen rights to Singh and Patel's life story were purchased by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] for development at [[Columbia Pictures]], which hired [[Mitch Glazer]] to write a screenplay.<ref name=deadline2010>{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|title=Sony Sparks To 'Million Dollar Arm' Pitch|url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/04/sony-sparks-to-million-dollar-arm-pitch/|access-date=June 16, 2013|website=Deadline Hollywood |date=April 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe project was eventually put in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] and in 2010, producers Roth and Ciardi set the film up at [[Walt Disney Pictures]].
