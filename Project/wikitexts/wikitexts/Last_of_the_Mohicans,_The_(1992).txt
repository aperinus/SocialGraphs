It was directed by [[Michael Mann]] and was based on the 1826 novel [[The Last of the Mohicans|''The Last of the Mohicans: A Narrative of 1757'']] by [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and the [[The Last of the Mohicans (1936 film)|1936 film adaptation]], owing more to the film than the novel. The film stars [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] and [[Madeleine Stowe]], with [[Jodhi May]], [[Russell Means]], [[Wes Studi]], [[Eric Schweig]], and [[Steven Waddington]] in supporting roles.\n\n[[The Last of the Mohicans (album)|The soundtrack]] features music by [[Trevor Jones (composer)|Trevor Jones]] and [[Randy Edelman]], and the song \"I Will Find You\" by [[Clannad]]. The main theme of the film is taken from the tune \"The Gael\" by [[Scotland|Scottish]] singer-songwriter [[Dougie MacLean]].\n\nReleased in the United States on September 25, 1992, ''The Last of the Mohicans'' was met with positive reviews and commercial success during its box-office run. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Sound]], the only Oscar won so far by a film directed by Mann. Day-Lewis received his second nomination for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]] for his performance.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1757, [[British Army]] Major Duncan Heyward arrives in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]], during the [[French and Indian War]]. He is assigned to Colonel [[George Monro (British Army officer)|Edmund Munro]], the commander of [[Fort William Henry]] in the [[Adirondack Mountains]]. Heyward is tasked with escorting Munro's two daughters, Cora and Alice, to their father. Before they leave, Heyward asks Cora to marry him, but she asks for more time before giving her answer.\n\nA [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] named [[Magua]] is tasked with guiding Heyward, the two women, and a troop of British soldiers to the fort, but he is actually a [[Wyandot people|Huron]] who leads them into an ambush that kills most of the soldiers. [[Mohican]] [[Chingachgook]], his son [[Uncas]], and his white, adopted son \"[[Natty Bumppo|Hawkeye]]\" arrive and kill all of the Hurons except Magua, who escapes. The trio agrees to take the women and Heyward to the fort. During the trek, they find another massacre at a farm, but do not stop to bury the victims so as not to alert the Hurons to their presence. Cora and Hawkeye are attracted to each other, as are Uncas and Alice.\n\nThey find the fort [[Siege of Fort William Henry|under siege]] by the French and their Huron allies, but manage to sneak in. Colonel Munro is surprised to see his daughters, as he had sent a letter warning them to stay away, but it was never delivered by Magua. Heyward becomes jealous of Hawkeye when Cora tells Heyward she will not accept his marriage proposal. A militiaman sets out at night to try to reach General Webb at Fort Edward for reinforcements, with Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas providing covering fire from the fort.\n\nAfter Munro refuses to honor an agreement made by Webb that the militiamen could leave to protect their homesteads if they were threatened, Hawkeye helps them sneak away. He is arrested for [[sedition]] and sentenced to hang. However, when he learns that Webb will send no soldiers, Munro is forced to accept French General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]]'s terms of surrender: the British can leave the fort honorably with their arms. Magua is furious because he bears a personal grudge against Munro.\n\nOnce Munro, his soldiers and civilians leave the fort, Huron warriors attack and [[Massacre at Fort William Henry|massacre them]]. Munro is captured alive, but mortally wounded, and Magua personally promises him that he'll kill his daughters, then cuts out his heart. Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachgook fight their way out, taking Cora, Alice, Heyward, and a few British soldiers. They hide in a cave behind a waterfall, but Magua finds them. Before Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachgook escape by leaping from the waterfall, Hawkeye tells Cora to stay alive and swears that he will find her.\n\nMagua takes his three prisoners to a Huron settlement. While he is addressing a [[sachem]], Hawkeye walks in unarmed as a [[parley]] to plead for their lives. The sachem rules that Heyward is to be returned to the British, Alice be given to Magua for the wrongs done to him by Munro, and Cora be [[Execution by burning|burned alive]]. Although Hawkeye is told he may leave in peace for his bravery, he offers to take Cora's place. Heyward, who is acting as interpreter, instead tells the Hurons to take his life for Cora's. After Hawkeye leaves the village with Cora he shoots Heyward, who is being burned alive, as a final act of mercy.\n\nChingachgook, Uncas, and Hawkeye then pursue Magua's party to rescue Alice. Uncas races ahead and kills several of the Hurons in combat, but is killed in a duel by Magua and thrown off the cliff's edge. Devastated to see Uncas\u2019 demise, Alice refuses to remain with Magua and commits suicide by jumping off the same cliff. Enraged, Hawkeye and Chingachgook catch up to the Hurons and slay many of them. Hawkeye then holds the rest at gunpoint, allowing Chingachgook to fight and kill Magua, avenging Uncas\u2019 death. Afterward, Chingachgook prays to the [[Great Spirit]] to receive Uncas, proclaiming himself \"the last of the Mohicans.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as [[Natty Bumppo|Nathaniel \"Hawkeye\" Poe]]\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Cora Munro\n* [[Russell Means]] as [[Chingachgook]]\n* [[Eric Schweig]] as Uncas\n* [[Jodhi May]] as Alice Munro\n* [[Steven Waddington]] as Major Duncan Heyward\n* [[Wes Studi]] as [[Magua]]\n* [[Maurice Ro\u00ebves]] as Colonel [[George Monro (British Army officer)|Edmund Munro]]\n* [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]] as General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]]\n* [[Edward Blatchford]] as Jack Winthrop\n* [[Terry Kinney]] as John Cameron\n* [[Tracey Ellis]] as Alexandra Cameron\n* Justin M.
