The film stars [[Michael Angarano]], [[Danielle Panabaker]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Kelly Preston]] and [[Kurt Russell]]. It also features [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Jim Rash]], [[Steven Strait]], [[Lynda Carter]], [[Dave Foley]] and [[Kevin McDonald]]. It tells the story of Will Stronghold, the son of two superheroes who is enrolled in an airborne high school for teenage superheroes where his powers kick in; he must deal with a growing distance from his old friends, a threat from a mysterious supervillain and get the girl of his dreams.\n\nThe film was theatrically released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]] on July 29, 2005, and grossed $86.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $35 million.<ref name=BOMSkyHigh>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=skyhigh.htm|title=Sky High (2005) |website= [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=20 July 2022}}</ref> While it did receive generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, in the years since its release, its reputation has improved considerably, to the point of being regarded by some as a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school freshman Will Stronghold is the son of world-renowned superheroes Steve \"The Commander\" and Josie \"Jetstream\" Stronghold but has no superpowers of his own. Upon arriving at Sky High, an airborne high school for future superheroes, freshmen with stronger powers are assigned to \"Hero\" courses; while Will, his longtime best friend Layla Williams, who can control plants, and others with weaker powers are assigned as socially outcast \"Sidekicks\". The school nurse tells Will that a child of two superheroes may never gain powers. Will and Layla begin taking the Sidekick curriculum, where they befriend the other sidekicks. One evening, Will confesses to Steve that he has no powers, but Josie eventually convinces her husband not to worry.\n\nOne day at lunch, Will accidentally runs afoul of the [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] Warren Peace, whose supervillain father Steve incarcerated. After a brawl, Warren threatens Will's friends, and Will's paternal super strength awakens. Will is moved to the Hero curriculum and is partnered with technopath Gwen in a \"mad science\" class. As they grow closer, Will spends less time with the sidekicks. He asks Layla to meet for dinner to make up for lost time but forgets this when Gwen unexpectedly visits his house and invites Steve and Josie to be guests of honor at the homecoming dance. Will walks Gwen home, where she gets him to ask her to homecoming. Warren finds Layla stood up and encourages her to ask Will to homecoming, but upon learning the next day that Will is going with Gwen, Layla and Warren plan to go together to make Will jealous.\n\nGwen tricks Will into hosting a party at his house. Will takes her to his parents' Secret Sanctum, and while they kiss, one of Steve and Josie's battle mementos, Royal Pain's Pacifier, is stolen. Layla enters the party, but Gwen lies by saying that Will wants nothing to do with her. Will breaks up with Gwen upon learning about the girls' exchange and refuses to go to homecoming, but he soon discovers one of his parents' old yearbooks has a photo of a girl named Sue Tenny holding the Pacifier. Seeing a resemblance between her and Gwen and realizing that the Pacifier is gone, Will deduces that Gwen is Royal Pain's daughter. During the \"Hero of the Year\" award presentation for Steve and Josie, Gwen unveils herself as Royal Pain and uses the Pacifier to turn almost everyone into babies. Layla, Warren, and the sidekicks escape, and they reunite with Will, who apologizes for his behavior and kisses Layla. As Will goes to face Gwen, the sidekicks defeat her henchmen, and Layla learns that Gwen sabotaged the school's anti-gravity generator.\n\nGwen informs Will that she is Sue Tenny, who was turned into a baby when the Pacifier backfired during her first battle with Steve and Josie and now intends to raise the de-aged superheroes as villains. She and Will fight until she throws him off the school, but he survives when his maternal flight power awakens. Will defeats Gwen, but the school starts falling. Will tries to slow the school's descent as sidekick Magenta uses her guinea pig shapeshifting powers to access and repair the generator. The Pacifier is reconfigured to restore its targets' normal ages, and Steve and Josie give their award to the sidekicks, declaring them full-fledged heroes. The party resumes in celebration, and Will and Layla kiss in midair. Will narrates what happened to the villains, how bus driver Ron Wilson got his own superpowers, and that, in the end, \"my girlfriend became my archenemy, my archenemy became my best friend, and my best friend became my girlfriend\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as William \"Will\" Theodore Stronghold, a freshman at Sky High, whose parents are two famous superheroes \u2014 Commander and Jetstream \u2014 as well as Maxville's top real estate agents in their secret identities.
