Written by [[Robert Mark Kamen]], [[Mark Miller (actor)|Mark Miller]], and Harvey Weitzman, it is about a young soldier returning home from [[World War II]] who is looking to settle down and start a family with the woman he impulsively married just before enlisting. After learning she is not what he imagined her to be, he heads north alone to [[Sacramento]] in search of work. Along the way he meets a beautiful young woman who is heading home from college to her family vineyard to help with the grape harvest. When he learns she is pregnant and was abandoned by her boyfriend, he offers to stand in as her husband so she can face her Old World domineering father. During his stay at the vineyard, they fall in love and face the angry rejection of her father together. \n\nThe film is based on the 1942 Italian film ''[[Four Steps in the Clouds]]'', written by Piero Tellini, Cesare Zavattini, and Vittorio de Benedetti. ''A Walk in the Clouds'' was released in theaters on August 11, 1995, by [[Twentieth Century Fox]] and grossed $91 million against a $20 million budget. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1945, after [[World War II]], [[United States Army]] [[Sergeant|Sgt.]] Paul Sutton returns to [[San Francisco]] to reunite with his wife, Betty, whom he married, following a whirlwind courtship, the day before he departed for the [[Pacific War|Pacific]]. The war has left him with emotional scars, and he experiences [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s on a regular basis.\n\nPaul's reunion with Betty is strained, especially after he discovers that, although he has written her \u201calmost every day,\u201d she stopped reading his letters after the first few, and keeps the hundreds of unopened envelopes in a footlocker. He is determined to make a go of the marriage, however, and hopes to establish a new career for himself. She insists he continue to sell chocolates door-to-door, and he sets off to [[Sacramento]]. En route, he meets fellow train passenger Victoria Aragon, a [[graduate student]] whose [[Mexican-American]] family owns a [[vineyard]] in the [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]]. When Victoria is accosted by two men on their bus to Sacramento, Paul intervenes and ends up beating up the men in self-defense. After all three men are kicked off the bus as a result, Paul finds a crying Victoria alone, further down the road. When he learns she is pregnant by her professor, Paul offers to introduce himself to her very traditionalist family as her husband.\n\nVictoria's father, Alberto, is infuriated, not only that she married a man below her social standing, but without his permission as well. Paul's initial plan to quietly slip away and continue on his journey, leaving her family to believe he abandoned her, is derailed when her grandfather, Don Pedro, encourages him to stay and help with the harvest. During the harvest, Paul (an orphan) grows closer to the family and learns the joys that come with their tradition, roots, and way of life. He and Victoria try to ignore their growing attraction and feelings for each other, but with little success. After a couple of days together, she finds the courage to ultimately come clean and reveal the truth to her family, further angering her father.\n\nPaul\u2019s honor prompts him to attempt to salvage his marriage and return home, but when he does he discovers Betty is involved with another man. She has applied for an [[annulment]], to which he happily agrees, and he returns to the Aragon estate to ask Victoria to marry him.\n\nWhen Paul returns, an argument with an angry and drunk Alberto leads to a disastrous fire which destroys the vineyard. However, Paul remembers one plant that may still have its roots intact, races off to retrieve it, and carries it to the family. The disaster, as well as Paul's bravery and dedication during it, has led to Alberto realizing his errors, and accepting Paul as one of his own, saying the roots of the plant are now officially Paul\u2019s \u201croots.\u201d  Victoria and Paul seal their fate in the presence of the entire Aragon family, and all set out to replant and rebuild with the help of their newest member.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Sgt.

Conversely, Reeves's performance in the film earned him a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nomination for Worst Actor (also for ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|JM]]''), but lost to [[Pauly Shore]] for ''[[Jury Duty (film)|Jury Duty]]''.\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn recent interviews Debra Messing claimed she was tricked into signing a nudity [[waiver]] after being assured by the producers that no nudity scenes would be required because it was going to be a PG-13 movie, they couldn't show them anyway, nothing was going to happen and the director just had a big ego. She only learned on set that for the international release version those scenes nevertheless would be filmed. Asking the director about what angles would be shot since she wanted to be prepared, he told her that as an actress she had no right to ask about his shots and it was her job to get naked. Debra described this experience as sexual harassment which she only realized afterward since she thought it was part of the business at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HUTTt6ENBiU&t=2980s |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/HUTTt6ENBiU |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Comedy Actresses Roundtable |date=3 July 2018 |access-date=18 July 2020 }}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0114887|A Walk in the Clouds}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|94990|A Walk in the Clouds}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|walk_in_the_clouds|A Walk in the Clouds}}\n\n{{Alfonso Arau}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walk in the Clouds, A}}\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American remakes of Italian films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about interclass romance]]\n[[Category:Films about veterans]]\n[[Category:Films about wine]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Maurice Jarre]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alfonso Arau]]\n[[Category:Films set in California]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Mark Kamen]]\n[[Category:Mexican-American films]]"}]}}}}
