It is the sequel to ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the eighth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Alan Taylor (director)|Alan Taylor]] from a screenplay by [[Christopher Yost]] and the writing team of [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]]. It stars [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] alongside [[Natalie Portman]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[Ray Stevenson]], [[Zachary Levi]], [[Tadanobu Asano]], [[Jaimie Alexander]], and [[Rene Russo]]. In the film, Thor and [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] (Hiddleston) team up to save the [[Nine Realms (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nine Realms]] from the [[Dark Elves (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dark Elves]].\n\nDevelopment of a sequel to ''Thor'' began in April 2011 when producer [[Kevin Feige]] announced plans for it to follow the MCU crossover film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012). In July, ''Thor'' director [[Kenneth Branagh]] withdrew from the sequel. [[Brian Kirk]] and [[Patty Jenkins]] were considered to replace him as director before Taylor was hired in January 2012. The supporting cast filled out in August 2012, with the hiring of Eccleston and Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the film's villains. Filming took place from September to December 2012 primarily in [[Surrey]], England, as well as in [[Iceland]] and London. Taylor wanted the film to be more grounded than ''Thor'', inspired by his work on ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. He hired [[Carter Burwell]] to compose the score, but Marvel replaced Burwell with [[Brian Tyler]].\n\n''Thor: The Dark World'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on October 22, 2013, and was released in the United States on November 8, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $644&nbsp;million worldwide and becoming the [[2013 in film#Highest-grossing films|tenth highest-grossing film of 2013]]. It received praise for the performances of Hemsworth and Hiddleston, visual effects, and action sequences, but was criticized for its generic villain and lack of depth. Retrospectively, Taylor has expressed dissatisfaction with the film, stating that Marvel substantially altered it from his original vision during [[post-production]]. A sequel directed by [[Taika Waititi]], ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', was released in 2017, while a fourth film, ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'', was released in 2022.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS!-->\nEons ago, [[Bor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bor]], father of [[Odin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Odin]], clashes with the [[Dark Elves (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dark Elf]] [[Malekith (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Malekith]], who seeks to unleash a weapon known as the [[Reality Stone|Aether]] on the nine realms. After conquering Malekith's forces, including enhanced warriors called the Kursed, on their home world of [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Svartalfheim|Svartalfheim]], Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column.

Separating from the group, Foster is teleported to another world, where, beyond Heimdall's near all-seeing vision, she absorbs the Aether. [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] alerts Thor, leading him to Earth. When Thor finds Foster, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Foster but that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.\n\nMalekith, awakened by the Aether's release, attacks Asgard. During the battle, Malekith and Algrim search for Foster, sensing that she contains the Aether. Thor's mother [[Frigga (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Frigga]] is fatally stabbed protecting Foster, and Malekith and Algrim are forced to flee without Foster. Despite Odin's orders not to leave Asgard, Thor reluctantly enlists the help of Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim, where they will use Foster to lure and confront Malekith, away from Asgard. In return, Thor promises Loki vengeance on Malekith for killing their mother. With Volstagg and Sif stalling Asgardian soldiers and Fandral assisting their escape, Thor, Loki, and Foster head to Svartalfheim.\n\nThere, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Foster, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is impaled while killing Algrim. Thor, cradling Loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. Afterward, Thor and Foster discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite in London with Lewis and Foster's mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]]\u2014who was briefly institutionalized due to the mental trauma he suffered during Loki's attack on Earth. They learn that Malekith plans to restore the Dark Elves to dominance by unleashing the Aether at the center of the Convergence in [[Greenwich]]. Thor battles Malekith through various portals and across multiple worlds until one portal separates them, leaving Malekith unopposed on Earth. Thor returns in time to help his mortal comrades use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is crushed by his own damaged ship.\n\nThor returns to Asgard, where he declines Odin's offer to take the throne and tells him of Loki's sacrifice. As he leaves, Odin transforms into Loki, who is alive and impersonating Odin.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Volstagg and Sif visit the [[Collector (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Collector]] and entrust the Aether to his care, commenting that with the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]] already in Asgard, having two [[Infinity Stones]] so close together would be unwise. As they leave, the Collector states his desire to acquire the other five Stones. In a [[post-credits scene]], Foster and Thor reunite on Earth, while somewhere in London, a frost monster from [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Jotunheim|Jotunheim]]\u2014accidentally transported to Earth during the final battle\u2014continues to run amok.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Thor-The Dark World cast.jpg|150|675|The cast of ''Thor: The Dark World'' at the world premiere in London.

Thor might have some explaining to do in this one. And with Loki, we get down to the major bones of our conflict with everything that's come from ''Thor'' to ''Avengers'' to now.\"<ref name=\"Hemsworth2\" /> Hemsworth added, \"Thor's journey I think picks more so up from where we left the first one\u2014About to take on the throne... and now coming to the realization of what responsibility comes with that. Also, Alan [Taylor] keeps talking about the dark side of that responsibility, and the secrets of being king or becoming sort of very political about what people need to know and what they want to know.\"<ref name=\"Hemsworth3\" /> Hemsworth especially enjoyed the role of Thor in this film as he was able to, \"... break him down and find his human qualities and his vulnerable side.\"<ref name=\"TheMovieNetwork\"/>\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]]: <br />An [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and Thor's love interest<ref name=\"Portman\" /> who is brought from Earth to Asgard by Thor after she is infected with a mysterious energy.<ref name=\"Portman2\" /> Producer [[Kevin Feige]] said, \"[W]hile Thor was a fish out of water on Earth in the first two films (''Thor'' and ''The Avengers''), this time Jane is very much a fish out of water in Asgard.\"<ref name=\"USAToday\" /> Portman added, \"It was a whole different adventure this time. Because Jane is the fish out of water. I didn't want to make it like ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure|Bill & Ted]]'', or like a [[valley girl]] dumped into Shakespeareland.\"<ref name=\"Portman3\" /> Portman also said the film finds Jane at a different place in her life, \"Jane has moved, so she's now in London, not in Santa Fe anymore. Obviously she has gone through missing Thor and also being upset at him because he didn't come knock on her door when he was on her planet. She's definitely been getting over that and trying to move on.\"<ref name=\"production notes\" /> Hemsworth's wife [[Elsa Pataky]] stood in for Portman during the post-credits kissing scene due to a scheduling conflict.<ref name=\"USWeekly\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]: <br />Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the deity of the [[Loki|same name]], who forms an uneasy alliance with Thor against the Dark Elves.<ref name=\"Hiddleston\" /><ref name=\"USAToday2\" /><ref name=\"LATimes5\" /> On where he wished to take the character in the film, Hiddleston said, \"I'd like to take [Loki] to his absolute rock bottom. I'd like to see him yield, essentially, to his darkest instincts. Then, having hit rock bottom, maybe come back up. I think the fascination for me about playing Loki is that, in the history of the mythology and the comic books and the Scandinavian myths, is he's constantly dancing on this fault line of the dark side and redemption.\"<ref name=\"Hiddleston2\" /> Hiddleston recalled, \"When I met Alan [Taylor], he asked me how I thought I could do Loki again without repeating myself and I remembered talking with Kevin Feige when we were on the ''Avengers'' promotional tour. I said, 'OK, you've seen Thor and Loki be antagonistic for two films now. It would be amazing to see them fight side by side. I've been the bad guy now twice, so I can't be again, or otherwise I shouldn't be in the film. So we have to find a new role for me to play.\"<ref name=\"TotalFilm\" />\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Odin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Odin]]: <br />The king of Asgard, father of Thor, and adoptive father of Loki, based on the deity of the [[Odin|same name]],<ref name=\"Hopkins\" /> who disapproves of Jane Foster being in Asgard.<ref name=\"Portman2\" /><ref name=\"USAToday\" /> Regarding Thor's relationship with his father, Hemsworth said, \"[T]he conflict between Thor and Odin was so great in the first one... so, certainly they disagree as I think they always will at times but there's a far greater respect from each other. So it becomes, I guess, a more mature conversation, but there's more at stake this time, too. It's not sort of just their individual egos, the whole universe is at stake.\"<ref name=\"Hemsworth3\" /> As to his approach Hopkins said, \"I just play Odin like a human being, with maybe a little more dimension. I grow a beard, look hopefully impressive and keep it as real as possible.\"<ref name=\"production notes\" />\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />Foster's mentor and colleague.<ref name=\"Skarsg\u00e5rd\" /> Skarsg\u00e5rd said, the film finds Selvig in a \"disrupted mode\" explaining, \"Having a god in your head for a while creates some psychological problems\", referring to the character's ordeal following ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"Empire2\" />\n* [[Idris Elba]] as [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]]: <br />The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian sentry of the [[Bifr\u00f6st|Bifr\u00f6st Bridge]], based on the mythological deity of the [[Heimdall|same name]].<ref name=\"Elba\" /> Elba said he has a larger role in the sequel, \"In the new film we're going to get to know Heimdall the Asgardian a bit better, and we're going to get to know Asgard a bit better. I can't say too much, but the expansion of Thor in his world is going to be huge. My part was very small and functional in the first film\".<ref name=\"Elba2\" />\n* [[Christopher Eccleston]] as [[Malekith (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Malekith]]: <br />The ruler of the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark-Elves|Dark Elves]] of [[Svart\u00e1lfar|Svartalfheim]].<ref name=\"Eccleston\" /> About Malekith's motivation, Eccleston said, \"There is a kind of tragic quality to his quest. Because he's lost his wife, he's lost his children. He's lost everything. And he returns for revenge. And the agent for his revenge is the Aether. If he gets hold of that, he is omnipotent.\"<ref name=\"Empire3\" /> Eccleston continued, \"What I thought about a great deal was revenge\u2014there's huge amounts of revenge. One quote is: 'When you seek revenge, be sure to dig two graves.' I did a film called ''[[Revengers Tragedy]]'' where I played a guy called Vindici\u2014from the word 'vindictive'\u2014and he is the distillation of revenge. So, in a way, that was what I had to think of: how revenge can make you absolutely monomaniacal\u2014though you're still trying to make it recognizably motive-led. It's just the personification of movie evil.\"<ref name=\"TotalFilm\" /> However Taylor stated that many scenes involving Malekith's backstory had to be cut from the film to make it more efficient.<ref name=\"CraveOnline\" /> Eccleston revealed that he speaks an invented language for the film explaining, \"The Elvish language is definitely based on European languages. I think there\u2019s probably some [[Finnish language|Finnish]] in there. It does have its logic and its rhythms. It also has many syllables and it's very difficult to do while remaining naturalistic. It's been a particular challenge for us but hopefully it gives the film some complexity and variety.\"<ref name=\"production notes\" /> Eccleston also said the role required six hours of make-up and 45 minutes in wardrobe.<ref name=\"Empire3\" />\n* [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]] as [[Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe: A\u2013L#Algrim|Algrim / Kurse]]: <br />A Dark Elf and Malekith's trusted and loyal lieutenant who is transformed into a monstrous creature in order to destroy Thor.<ref name=\"Akinnuoye-Agbaje1\" /><ref name=\"StitchKingdom2\" /> Akinnuoye-Agbaje described Kurse as \"an amalgamation of a bull and a lava-like creature. He has very animalistic tendencies but with this insatiable and unstoppable power. As an actor, that's one of the hardest things to embody. You have to realize you are probably the most powerful thing you could imagine. And you have to be that. You can't pretend, so that when you face Thor, it's real.\"<ref name=\"Akinnuoye-Agbaje2\" /> Akinnuoye-Agbaje stated the role required three hours of make-up a day and had to put on heavy duty prosthetics explaining, \"The outfit weighed about 40 pounds. I'm sure there will be a certain amount of CGI but a good 80% was me in that suit.\"<ref name=\"Akinnuoye-Agbaje2\" /> About the character Akinnuoye-Agbaje said, \"I suppose Algrim and Kurse would be the quintessential baddies, but in reality they are what I perceive as the scorn and the victims of the story. They are the elves who have basically lost their planet and their race to another race, the Asgardians. Here is a man/alien who places a noble objective beyond his own life and I think there is something extremely inspiring about that because he looks at the bigger picture and sees himself as a means to that end.\" Akinnuoye-Agbaje added, \"I worked with director Alan Taylor in trying to maintain Algrim's humanity all the way throughout Kurse's transformation, so that even when you see Kurse the beast, you can still relate to him as being Algrim inside. And symbolically we did that by keeping the same piercing blue eyes throughout.\"<ref name=\"production notes\" />\n* [[Kat Dennings]] as [[Darcy Lewis]]: <br />A [[political science]] major who is [[internship|interning]] for Foster.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom2\" /><ref name=\"Dennings3\" /> Her role in the film was expanded from the [[comic relief]] sidekick role she played in the first ''Thor'' film.<ref name=\"Dennings\" /> Dennings said her character is \"really bad at real science in this first movie. In the second movie, she's more interested, but she still doesn't know anything about it. She loves Jane, she really wants Jane and Thor to be together. It's almost like her own little soap opera that she watches.\"<ref name=\"Dennings3\" />\n* [[Ray Stevenson]] as [[Volstagg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Volstagg]]: <br />A member of the [[Warriors Three]], a group of three Asgardian adventurers who are among Thor's closest comrades, known for both his hearty appetite and wide girth.<ref name=\"Stevenson\" /> About the character Stevenson said, \"He's got a heart the size of a planet that he wears on his sleeve, so he's like a big kid.\"<ref name=\"production notes\" /> Regarding Volstagg's role in this film, Stevenson said, \"Volstagg is struggling, he has a brood, [the Warriors Three] are fighting for hearth and home as much as for the idea of Asgard itself. That's where he has trouble.\" Explaining, \"He's all too aware of how potentially threatening this new enemy is on both the home front and the battlefield.\"<ref name=\"Stevenson2\" />\n* [[Zachary Levi]] as [[Fandral (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Fandral]]: <br />A member of the Warriors Three, characterized as an irrepressible [[swashbuckler]] and romantic.<ref name=\"Levi2\" /> Levi replaced [[Josh Dallas|Joshua Dallas]] in the role due to Dallas's commitment on ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''. Levi had been up for the role in the first film, but bowed out due to his commitment on ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]''.<ref name=\"Levi\" /> Levi compared the character to Flynn Rider, the character he played in the animated feature, ''[[Tangled]]'', \"Fandral is a little similar to Rider in some ways... He's like this [[Lothario]]. He's like [[Errol Flynn]]. He loves ladies, as do I\".<ref name=\"Levi3\" /> Regarding the dynamic of the Warriors Three, Levi said, \"The Warriors Three are here to support Thor. We are his confidants, his best friends. We've all grown up together in a lot of ways and fought many a battle together, escaped death. To me it's the way best friends ought to be\u2014they're there when you need to talk and they're there if you don't want to talk, and they're there if you need to escape from your father's place in a flying skiff!\"<ref name=\"production notes\" />\n* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as [[Hogun (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hogun]]: A member of the Warriors Three, native of [[Vanaheim]],<ref name=\"Empire2\" /> primarily identified by his grim demeanor.<ref name=\"LATimes2\" />\n* [[Jaimie Alexander]] as [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]]: <br />An Asgardian warrior, Thor's childhood friend and Foster's romantic rival, based on the deity of the [[Sif|same name]].<ref name=\"USAToday\" /><ref name=\"Alexander\" /> Alexander said there is more character development for Sif and the film explores the Sif-Thor relationship.<ref name=\"Alexander3\" /> Alexander elaborated, \"I really tried to bring a little bit more vulnerability in this film. Sif is very much in love with Thor and very much cares about his well-being. So she kicks a lot of butt in this movie but she also opens her heart a lot.\"<ref name=\"production notes\" /> Alexander suffered a severe back injury while on the set. About the injury, she said, \"It was raining, it was dark outside, it was like 5 in the morning\u2014and I went down a metal staircase and slipped and slipped a [[Intervertebral disc|disc]] in my [[Thoracic vertebrae|thoracic spine]] and chipped 11 of my vertebrae.

[[Kenneth Branagh]] sent me a nice note, because he understood, he's an actor. You move on, what are you going to do? But I think they're going to need a good mom in the next film. Loki needs his mom. I have a lot of compassion for [Loki].

We wanted the realms to feel grounded, like a real place, while at the same time respecting the magical 'planet of the Gods' feeling and theme.\" ''Thor: The Dark World'' was Morgenthau's first time shooting a feature film digitally. For the film, Morgenthau chose the [[Arri Alexa|Arri Alexa Plus]], although he tested with the [[Sony F65]] but found the Alexa to be more pleasing. In addition to the Alexa, [[Red Epic]] and [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]] cameras were used for [[second unit]] filming. With the Alexa, Morgenthau used [[Panavision]] [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] lenses. Morgenthau said, \"The lenses brought some of the magic and mystery of photochemical back to digital, that big-movie look.\" Morgenthau also stated that ''Thor: The Dark World'' was easily the most technically complex project that he has worked but said, \"It's all the same concept and the same principles as in a smaller film.

Taylor explained that it was all a part of the \"Marvel process\" saying, \"We're doing full scenes, scenes that were not in the movie before. We're adding scenes, creating scenes, writing scenes for the first time. The one [involving Loki] was a fun connective scene... We realised how well Loki was working in the movie, and we wanted to do more with him. So it was that kind of thing, it was like, 'Oh, we could do this, we could jam this in here' because he's such a wonderful guy to watch do his stuff.\"<ref name=\"Collider2\" /> Also in August, [[IMAX Corporation]] and Marvel Entertainment announced that the film would be digitally re-mastered into the [[IMAX 3D]] format and released into IMAX 3D theaters internationally beginning October 30, 2013.<ref name=\"Deadline4\" />\n\nTaylor said ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]'' writer/director [[Joss Whedon]] rewrote several scenes in the film explaining, \"Joss came in to save our lives a couple of times.

The sequence consisted mostly of computer graphics with live-action shots interwoven throughout. The use of CG allowed for greater freedom of movement by the characters as the live-action costumes were too constrictive.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nTaylor wanted Asgard in this film to have a more natural look than its predecessor. To achieve this, crews filmed the coast of Norway with an Arri Alexa camera for three days in a helicopter, capturing six hours of footage. Double Negative then embedded their CG rendering of Asgard on shots of the natural landscape. Double Negative visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, \"The benefit of that is that you have some real-world terrain to work with \u2013 so you have buildings that have to convey natural features. Then from there we went in there populating the terrain with different buildings.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> For scenes taking place on Svartalfheim, production filmed in Iceland with Double Negative adding ruins, mountains, Dark Elf ships, and skies.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nFor the shot of the levitating truck, which was used in the film to demonstrate the strange phenomena brought on by the coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse.

Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, \"We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we wanted to do was to make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight.
