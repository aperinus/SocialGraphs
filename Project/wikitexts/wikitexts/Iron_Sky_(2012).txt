''Iron Sky'' is one of the [[List of most expensive Finnish films|most expensive Finnish films]].\n\n''Iron Sky'' comes from the creators of ''[[Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning]]'' and was produced by Tero Kaukomaa of [[Blind Spot Pictures]] and Energia Productions, co-produced by New Holland Pictures and 27 Films, and co-financed by numerous [[Crowdfunding|individual supporters]]; [[Samuli Torssonen]] was responsible for the computer-generated imagery. It was theatrically released throughout Europe in April 2012.<ref name=\"ironsky1\"/> A [[director's cut]] of the film with 20 additional minutes was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 11 March 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=20417|title=Iron Sky (2012) Blu-ray comparison|work=DVDCompare|access-date=19 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nA video-game adaptation titled ''[[Iron Sky: Invasion]]'' was released in October 2012.\n\nA sequel, titled ''[[Iron Sky: The Coming Race]]'', was [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] through [[Indiegogo]] and released in January 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/iron-sky-the-coming-race--2#home |title=''Iron Sky: The Coming Race'' |publisher=[[Indiegogo]] |access-date=2017-05-09}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 2018, an American crewed mission lands on the [[Moon]]. The lander carries two astronauts, one of them an [[African-American]] male model, James Washington, specifically chosen to aid the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] in her re-election (various \"Black to the Moon\" word-play posters are seen in the film, extolling the new Moon landing).\n\nUpon landing on the [[far side of the Moon]], they encounter the descendants of Nazis who escaped to the Moon in 1945 (self-styled the \"[[Fourth Reich]]\" in dialogue). Washington is taken captive after the other astronaut is killed. Nazi scientist Doktor Richter examines Washington and obtains his [[smartphone]], which he later recognizes as having more computing power than the 1940s-style computers of the Fourth Reich, enabling its use as a control unit to complete their giant space battleship ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]''.\n\nWhen Richter strives to demonstrate his [[Wunderwaffe]] to the current [[F\u00fchrer]], Wolfgang Kortzfleisch, the phone's battery is quickly exhausted. Nazi commander Klaus Adler, chosen for genetic reasons to mate with Earth specialist Renate Richter (Doktor Richter's daughter), embarks in a [[flying saucer]] to collect more such computers on Earth. He takes with him Washington, who has been \"[[Aryan race|Aryanized]]\" by Doktor Richter using an \"[[albinism|albinizing]]\" drug.\n\nUpon landing in [[New York City]], they discover that Renate has stowed away with them. They abandon Washington after he connects them with the President's campaign adviser, Vivian Wagner. Adler and Renate energize the President's re-election campaign using [[Nazi propaganda|Nazi-style rhetoric]]. Renate is unaware of Adler's ambition to replace Kortzfleisch and rule the world. After three months, Kortzfleisch lands on Earth and confronts Adler, but is killed by Adler and Vivian. Adler declares himself the new F\u00fchrer before returning to orbit in Kortzfleisch's flying saucer, deserting Vivian but taking her [[tablet computer]].\n\nConcurrently, Renate is persuaded by the homeless Washington that Adler intends global genocide. Shortly afterwards, the Moon Nazis launch a mass attack on the Earth with a fleet of giant [[Zeppelin]]-like spacecraft called Siegfrieds which tow asteroids as missiles and launch countless flying saucers at [[New York City]], where they destroy the [[Statue of Liberty]] and blitz the city. The [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] engage the flying saucers with some success.\n\nThe [[United Nations]] assembles to discuss the Moon Nazi threat. The President appoints Vivian as commander of the secretly [[Militarisation of space|militarised]] spacecraft USS ''George W. Bush'', which carries nuclear and [[Directed-energy weapon|directed-energy]] weapons, only to discover that most of the other nations (except Finland) have also secretly armed their spacecraft. They dispatch them against the Nazi fleet and wipe out the Siegfrieds.\n\nAdler arrives in Kortzfleisch's flying saucer with the tablet computer to activate the ''G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung''. Renate and Washington travel in Adler's flying saucer to the ''G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung'', where Washington goes to disable the engines while Renate seeks out Adler. Meanwhile, the international space fleet damage the Nazis' Moon base and approach the ''G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung'' which dwarfs them all. Commanding the ''G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung'', Adler destroys parts of the Moon to expose Earth to his line-of-fire. During the battle, Washington disconnects Vivian's tablet from the control panel of the ''G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung'', while Renate kills Adler before he can fire at Earth. Renate and Washington separately escape as the ''G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung'' crashes into the Moon.\n\nThe U.S. president congratulates Vivian from the UN session; whereupon Vivian discloses the presence of large tanks of [[helium-3]] on the Moon, of which the President immediately assumes sole claim on grounds that its possession ensures a millennium-long supply of energy. This enrages the other UN members, who engage in a brawl, while the international fleet turn on each other.\n\nAt the damaged Moon base, Renate reunites with Washington, who has reverted his pigmentation back to normal. They kiss before a confused group of Nazi survivors, whom Renate assures, \"have a lotta work cut out for [them]\". The final moments of the film show the Earth apparently during an [[World War III|international nuclear war]]. At the very end of the credits, the planet [[Mars]] is revealed with an [[artificial satellite]] in orbit.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Dietze]] as Renate Richter\n* [[G\u00f6tz Otto]] as Klaus Adler\n* Christopher Kirby as James Washington\n* [[Tilo Pr\u00fcckner]] as Doktor Richter\n* [[Udo Kier]] as  Wolfgang Kortzfleisch\n* [[Peta Sergeant]] as Vivian Wagner\n* [[Stephanie Paul]] as the [[President of the United States]] (a parody of [[Sarah Palin]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Die finnische Filmparodie \"Iron Sky\" erz\u00e4hlt von durchgeknallten Nazis auf dem Mond|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=2 April 2012}}</ref>)\n* Michael Cullen as Secretary of Defense\n\n==Production==\nProduction began in early 2006, and the production team took their [[Trailer (promotion)|teaser trailer]] of the film to the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]], seeking co-financiers.<ref>[http://www.nordiskfilmogtvfond.com/news_story.php?cid=860&sid=10&ptid=4 Nordisk Film & TV Fond], 5 September 2008, \"Finland's Iron Sky Falls on Cannes\".
