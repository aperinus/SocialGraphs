Welsh himself wrote the screenplay, and appears as a minor character in the film.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film dramatises three stories from the book:\n\n* \"The Granton Star Cause\": A comedy, in which Boab ([[Stephen McCole]]) is having a rotten day. His parents throw him out so they can indulge in [[sado-masochism]] and he is sacked from his job, dumped by his girlfriend, and dropped from his [[football (soccer)|football]] team. It has elements of [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''. One of the characters is a pitiless, profane God who transforms him into a fly as punishment for wasting his life. Named after an Edinburgh housing district, \"The Granton Star Cause\" was filmed on location in [[Muirhouse]] and [[Pilton, Edinburgh|Pilton]], including Ferry Road Drive.\n* \"A Soft Touch\": [[Kevin McKidd]] plays Johnny, a man who is [[cuckold]]ed by Larry (Garry McCormack), the ruthless upstairs neighbour who steals his electricity and his wife ([[Michelle Gomez]]). Filmed on location in [[Niddrie, Edinburgh|Niddrie]].\n* \"The Acid House\": An [[LSD|acid]] trip and a bolt of [[lightning]] result in amiable schemie Coco Brice ([[Ewen Bremner]]) exchanging bodies with the baby of a [[middle class|middle-class]] couple ([[Martin Clunes]] and [[Jemma Redgrave]]).\n\nAll three sections are independent, but are linked by setting and the reappearance of incidental characters, in particular [[Maurice Ro\u00ebves]] who appears variously as an inebriated wedding guest, a figure in a dream, and a pub patron. All three of his parts symbolise a human manifestation of God.\n\nThe film offended elements of the UK tabloid press with a depiction of a cynical, jaded, foul-mouthed God. In some English-speaking countries such as Canada and the United States it has been screened with subtitles because of the [[Scots language|Scots]] vernacular and heavy [[Edinburgh]] accents.\n\n==Cast==\n;\"The Granton Star Cause\"\n*[[Maurice Ro\u00ebves]] \u2013 [[God in Christianity|God]]\n*[[Stephen McCole]] \u2013 Boab\n*[[Garry Sweeney]] \u2013 Kev\n*[[Jenny McCrindle]] \u2013 Evelyn\n*[[Simon Weir]] \u2013 Tambo\n*[[Iain Andrew]] \u2013 Grant\n*[[Irvine Welsh]] \u2013 Parkie\n*[[Pat Stanton]] \u2013 Barman\n*[[Alex Howden]] \u2013 Boab Snr\n*[[Annie Louise Ross]] \u2013 Doreen (as Ann Louise Ross)\n*[[Dennis O'Connor (actor)|Dennis O'Connor]] \u2013 PC Cochrane\n*[[John Gardner (actor)|John Gardner]] \u2013 Sgt.
