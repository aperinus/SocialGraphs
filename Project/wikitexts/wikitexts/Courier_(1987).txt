At the same time his parents get divorced. His ironic and careless attitude to his new miserable job covers the deep confusion of his soul. By pure accident he meets a girl named Katya, daughter of a [[Nomenklatura|famous professor]]. She is bored with her perfect family and ordinary prosperity, and they start dating. But her sudden interest gradually fades away because she doesn't have enough strength for deliberate protest and Ivan, truthfully, is not particularly interested in her. Soon she returns to her old environment, and he stays face-to-face with his [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|near future]].\n\n==Cast==\n* {{Interlanguage link|Fyodor Dunayevsky|ru|\u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0414\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}} \u2013 Ivan, courier\n* [[Anastasiya Nemolyaeva]] \u2013 Katya\n* [[Oleg Basilashvili]] \u2013 Semyon Petrovich, Katya's father\n* [[Inna Churikova]] \u2013 Lydia Alekseevna, Ivan's mother\n* [[Aleksandr Pankratov-Chyorny]] \u2013 Stepan Afanasyevich, editor-in-chief\n* [[Svetlana Nikolaevna Kryuchkova|Svetlana Kryuchkova]] \u2013 Zinaida Pavlovna, secretary\n* [[Vladimir Menshov]] \u2013 Oleg Nikolaevich, guest at Katya's birthday\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|91364|Courier}}\n* Watch [http://cinema.mosfilm.ru/films/film/1980-1989/kurier/ ''Courier''] online at official [[Mosfilm]] site (with English subtitles)\n{{Karen Shakhnazarov}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Courier}}\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1986 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Russian comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1986]]\n[[Category:Films set in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow Oblast]]\n[[Category:1980s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Karen Shakhnazarov]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Eduard Artemyev]]\n[[Category:1986 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1986 drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet teen films]]\n\n\n{{1980s-USSR-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
