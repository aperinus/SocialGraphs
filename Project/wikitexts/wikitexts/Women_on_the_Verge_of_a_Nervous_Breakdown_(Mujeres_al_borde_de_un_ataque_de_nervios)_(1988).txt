The film brought Almod\u00f3var to widespread international attention: it was nominated for the [[61st Academy Awards|1988]] [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]],<ref name=\"Oscars1989\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1989 |title=The 61st Academy Awards (1989) Nominees and Winners |access-date=20 August 2015 |work=oscars.org}}</ref> and won five [[Goya Awards]] including Best Film and Best Actress in a Leading Role for Maura. It debuted at the [[45th Venice International Film Festival|45th International Venice Film Festival]] and was released on 11 November 1988.\n\n== Title ==\nThe actual Spanish title refers to an ''{{lang|es|[[ataque de nervios]]}}'' (attack of the nerves), which is not actually well translated as \"[[nervous breakdown]]\" (''{{lang|es|crisis nerviosa}}''). ''{{lang|es|Ataques de nervios}}'' are [[Culture-bound syndrome|culture-bound]] psychological phenomena during which the individual, most often female, displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions, bodily gestures, occasional falling to the ground, and fainting, often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event. Historically, this condition has been associated with [[hysteria]] and more recently in the scientific literature with [[post-traumatic stress]] and [[panic attack]]s.<ref>Schechter DS, Marshall RD, Salman E, Goetz D, Davies SO, Liebowitz MR (2000).

They are [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|voice actors who dub]] foreign films, notably ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Sterling Hayden]]. Iv\u00e1n's sweet-talking voice is the same one he uses in his work. About to leave on a trip, he has asked Pepa to pack his things in a suitcase he will pick up later.\n\nPepa returns home to find her answering machine filled with frantic messages from her friend, Candela; she rips out the phone and throws it out the window onto the balcony. Candela arrives; before she can explain her situation, Carlos (Iv\u00e1n's son with Luc\u00eda, his previous lover) arrives with his snobbish fianc\u00e9e Marisa. They are apartment-hunting, and have chosen Pepa's penthouse to tour. Carlos and Pepa figure out each other's relationship to Iv\u00e1n; Pepa wants to know where Iv\u00e1n is, but Carlos does not know. Candela tries to kill herself by jumping off the balcony.\n\nA bored Marisa decides to drink [[gazpacho]] from the fridge, unaware that it has been spiked with sleeping pills. Candela explains that she had an affair with an Arab who later visited her with some friends. Unbeknownst to her, they are a [[Shiite]] terrorist cell. When the terrorists leave, Candela flees to Pepa's place; she fears that the police are after her. Pepa goes to see a lawyer whom Carlos has recommended.\n\nThe lawyer, Paulina, behaves strangely, and has tickets to [[Stockholm]]. Candela tells Carlos that the Shiites plan to hijack a flight to Stockholm that evening and divert it to [[Beirut]], where they have a friend who was arrested. Carlos fixes the phone, calls the police, hangs up before (he believes) they can trace the call, and kisses Candela. Pepa returns; Luc\u00eda calls and says that she is coming over to confront her about Iv\u00e1n. Carlos says that Luc\u00eda has recently been released from a mental hospital. Pepa, tired of Iv\u00e1n, throws his suitcase out (barely missing him); he leaves Pepa a message.\n\nPepa returns to her apartment and hears Carlos playing [[Lola Beltr\u00e1n]]'s \"Soy Infeliz\". She throws the [[Gramophone record|record]] out the window, and it hits Paulina. Pepa hears Iv\u00e1n's message, rips out the phone and throws the answering machine out of the window. Luc\u00eda arrives with the telephone repairman and the police, who traced Carlos' call. Candela panics, but Carlos serves the spiked gazpacho. The policemen and repairman are knocked out, and Carlos and Candela fall asleep on the sofa; Luc\u00eda aims a policeman's gun at Pepa, who figures out that Iv\u00e1n is going to Stockholm with Paulina and their flight is the one the terrorists are planning to hijack. Luc\u00eda says that she faked being sane when she heard Iv\u00e1n's voice dubbed on a foreign film. She throws the gazpacho in Pepa's face, and rushes to the airport to kill Iv\u00e1n.\n\nPepa chases her in a cab with her neighbour, Ana. At the airport, Luc\u00eda sees Iv\u00e1n and Paulina at security and aims her gun at them. Pepa thwarts the murder attempt by rolling a luggage cart at Luc\u00eda, before fainting. Iv\u00e1n rushes to Pepa's aid and apologises for the way he has been treating her, offering to talk things out with her. Pepa, however, declares it is now too late and leaves. She returns to her home, which is a mess. Pepa sits on her balcony, where Marisa has just awakened. The women chat, sharing a moment of tranquility, and Pepa finally reveals what she wanted to tell Iv\u00e1n: she is pregnant.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Carmen Maura]] as Pepa Marcos\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Carlos\n* [[Julieta Serrano]] as Luc\u00eda\n* [[Mar\u00eda Barranco]] as Candela\n* [[Rossy de Palma]] as Marisa\n* [[Kiti M\u00e1nver]] as Paulina Morales\n* [[Guillermo Montesinos]] as Taxi driver\n* [[Chus Lampreave]] as Portera [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Testiga de Jehov\u00e1]]\n* [[Loles Le\u00f3n]] as The secretary\n* [[Fernando Guill\u00e9n (actor)|Fernando Guill\u00e9n]] as Iv\u00e1n\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{as of |July 2022}} review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 91% of 33 professional critics gave the film a positive review.<ref>{{cite web | title=Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown | website=Rotten Tomatoes | date=10 August 2020 | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/women_on_the_verge_of_a_nervous_breakdown | access-date=29 March 2022}}</ref> Based on 12 critics, it holds an 85/100 rating on [[Metacritic]], signifying \"universal acclaim\".<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/women-on-the-verge-of-a-nervous-breakdown ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown''] ''Metacritic''.
