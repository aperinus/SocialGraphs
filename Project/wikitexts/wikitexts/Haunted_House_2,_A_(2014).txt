Kisha starts making a fuss and fights Malcolm, then breathes into Ray's face. He passes out at the wheel and collides with a truck. Somehow, everybody is okay, but Malcolm and Ray leave an unconscious Kisha in the backseat and run away.\n\nA year later, Malcolm moves in with his girlfriend Megan, an insecure woman with two kids, her bratty and promiscuous teenage daughter Becky and effeminate son Wyatt, who has a stereotypically black imaginary friend named Tony. The family moves into a new home with their dog, Shiloh Jr. After the movers hang a safe next to the lawn, an invisible force unties the rope tied to a support beam, causing the safe to fall on the dog and crush him. Malcolm dramatically  cries all the way to when they bury the dog.\n\nMegan then puts a creepy looking doll named Abigail on a chair by their bed. Malcolm messes around with it until he starts having sex with it. Malcolm carries his camera around to record everything he sees. He meets the neighbor, Miguel, who jumps at every chance he gets to call Malcolm racist whenever he comments on something related to a Mexican stereotype, though all of it is in jest. Weird things start happening again. Malcolm records himself having sex with Megan and notices the Abigail doll turning its head. He also finds old videotapes with a demonic being in it trying to kill a family of three, but it fails every time.\n\nAdditionally, Becky finds an old box and develops an attachment to it, and Wyatt continues to hang out with his imaginary friend. Malcolm seeks help from a paranormal psychologist named Professor Wilde. He deduces that Malcolm must have had a previous encounter with a demonic force. Malcolm thinks it has to do with Kisha. Wilde then proceeds to cook meth with some prostitutes, but then gets arrested by the police. Malcolm finds himself being terrorized and taunted by Abigail, as he is getting sent crude photos from her to his phone. She also ends up burning his clothes. Later, Malcolm sees a box moving in the dark and begins to attack it in every possible way he can. Megan and the kids run downstairs and tell Malcolm that what was in the box was supposed to be a surprise for him to make up for Shiloh Jr. Malcolm reaches into the box and pulls out a horribly mangled dog. He then takes a shotgun and blows its head off to put it out of its misery.\n\nAmong other weird scenarios that plague the family is Becky opening her box and having a whole swarm of moths fly out. Malcolm fixes this by installing bug zappers to attract the moths to their doom. He also notices the demon, which Professor Wilde says is named Aghoul, taunting him in the videos. Although he tries to explain the weirdness to Megan and the kids, they don't believe him. To make matters worse, Malcolm comes home the next day to discover Kisha talking to Megan, looking very much not possessed. She has told Megan that Malcolm left her in a ditch to die, and she leaves after flashing him some scary black demon eyes. Later, Malcolm sees Abigail wrote \"Miss me?\" in red crayon all over the walls. He tries getting rid of her by burying her, sending her to Taiwan, chopping her up and barbecuing her, but she comes back each time.\n\nMalcolm resorts to seeking help from the insane Father Doug Williams. He finds the crazy priest in a church, shanking another priest for absurd reasons. When Malcolm asks for his help, Doug only makes weird comments about the Kardashians coming after him and other men. Malcolm leaves when he thinks he sees demons surrounding a church, but they're really just church women who make comments about Malcolm being with a white woman. Miguel comes over and offers a chicken to be used as a blood sacrifice, but the chicken becomes hysterical and fights back. Malcolm ends up wrestling the chicken all across the kitchen, ending with him throwing the chicken up into the ceiling fan where it is decapitated. He and Miguel fry the remains and eat it with waffles.\n\nAs a last resort, Malcolm goes to find Ned and Noreen Swanson, a sort of racist and sexually frustrated paranormal investigative husband and wife duo. He brings them to his house, where they determine that the demonic presence has attracted the family to it, explaining Becky's need for the box, Wyatt's imaginary friend, and Malcolm's sexual attraction to Abigail. They take hits from a bong mask and go downstairs to find Becky fully possessed. She flails around and gets thrown everywhere. Malcolm calls upon Doug to come by, but he has a mental breakdown along with the ghost possessing him and ends up shooting himself in the head. Becky runs upstairs and Malcolm chases after her. After some reluctance, he gets the demon to transfer itself to himself by having Becky regurgitate red goo. Everybody runs upstairs to find Malcolm possessed. He too pukes up the goo back into Becky's box. The Swansons take the possessed items, including Abigail so Ned can have sex with her. Everything seems okay until the next night when Malcolm and Megan are watching TV and Kisha shows up behind them. She twists Megan's neck around, killing her and sending Malcolm running away.\n\nRay and his boys come to Malcolm's house to find Megan dead, along with Becky upstairs, impaled in her bed, and Wyatt is missing. They find Malcolm lying on the floor in the basement, still alive as he chose to hide rather than try to leave. After a bit of panicked rambling, Kisha comes downstairs, leaving all the men to scream in fear.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Malcolm Johnson<ref name=\"comingsoon1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=103752 |title=A Haunted House 2 Trailer, News, Videos, and Reviews |website=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=2013-08-26}}</ref>\n* [[Jaime Pressly]] as Megan<ref name=\"comingsoon1\"/>\n* [[Essence Atkins]] as Kisha Davis<ref name=\"comingsoon1\"/>\n* [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Aghoul<ref name=\"comingsoon1\"/>\n* [[Affion Crockett]] as Ray-Ray, Malcolm's gangster cousin<ref name=\"comingsoon1\"/>\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Father Doug Williams<ref name=\"comingsoon1\"/>\n* [[Gabriel Iglesias]] as Miguel Jos\u00e9 Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez Smith <ref name=\"comingsoon1\"/>\n* [[Ashley Rickards]] as Becky<ref name=\"comingsoon1\"/>\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Noreen\n* [[Hayes MacArthur]] as Ned\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Professor Wilde\n* [[Steele Stebbins]] as Wyatt \n* Kurt Carley as Dr. Rousch\n* [[Tom Virtue]] as Father Callahan\n* [[Kym Whitley]] as Church Lady\n* Gregg Wayans as Officer Jackson\n* Mikal Kartvedt as Police Officer\n* [[Mark Henry]] as Tough Voice Guy\n* Iva La'Shawn as 1st Grade Teacher\n* Taylor John Smith as Joey\n* Kirsty Hill as Hot Coed\n* [[Mari Possa]] as Hot Coed\n}}\n\n==Production==\nOn April 8, 2013, it was confirmed that Wayans, [[Open Road Films]], and [[IM Global|IM Global Octane]] would produce a [[sequel]] due to the financial success of the first film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Open Road Films Plans A Haunted House 2|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=102583|work=[[ComingSoon.net]]|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|date=2013-04-08|accessdate=2013-04-10}}</ref> On May 3, 2013, it was confirmed that ''A Haunted House 2'' would be released on March 28, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=103753 |title=Open Road Films Sets A Haunted House 2 Release Date |website=ComingSoon.net |date=2013-05-03 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}</ref> On August 24, 2013, it was announced that [[Jaime Pressly]], [[Ashley Rickards]] and [[Gabriel Iglesias]] had joined the cast of the film.<ref name=\"comingsoon2\"/> [[Principal photography]] and production began on August 26, 2013, and ended on September 29, 2013.<ref name=\"comingsoon2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=108154 |title=Jaime Pressly, Two Others Enter Wayans' A Haunted House 2 |website=ComingSoon.net |date= August 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MarlonWayans/status/384409766111350784 |title=Twitter / MarlonWayans: Soooo tired.
