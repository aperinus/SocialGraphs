The film stars [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Carla Gugino]], [[Alexandra Daddario]], [[Ioan Gruffudd]], [[Archie Panjabi]], and [[Paul Giamatti]]. Its plot centers on a massive earthquake caused by the [[San Andreas Fault]] devastating the [[West Coast of the United States]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] of the film started on April 22, 2014, in [[Queensland]], Australia, and wrapped up on July 28 in San Francisco. The film was released worldwide in 2D and 3D on May 29, 2015 and received mixed reviews from critics, praising the visual effects and Johnson and Gugino's performances but criticizing the plot and characters. It grossed $474&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n[[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] [[Seismology|seismologist]] Dr. Lawrence Hayes and his colleague Dr. Kim Park are at [[Hoover Dam]] testing a new earthquake prediction model when a nearby and previously unknown [[fault (geology)|fault]] ruptures, triggering a [[Seismic magnitude scales|7.1 magnitude]] earthquake that collapses the dam; Park sacrifices himself to save a young girl. Hayes discovers that the entire [[San Andreas Fault]] is shifting and will soon cause a series of major earthquakes, potentially destroying cities along the fault line. He begins racing to warn the population of [[California]] along with his students Alexi and Phoebe and reporter Serena Johnson.\n\nWhen a 9.1 magnitude earthquake devastates [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]], Ray Gaines, a [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] helicopter-rescue pilot going through a divorce from his wife Emma, finds himself rescuing her from a skyscraper in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, their daughter Blake has been visiting San Francisco with Emma's new boyfriend Daniel when an earthquake strikes the city. Rubble from the collapsing parking garage pins her in Daniel's car. Panicking, Daniel leaves Blake in an act of cowardice. Ben Taylor, a British engineer seeking employment at Daniel's firm, and his younger brother Ollie rescue Blake and they reach [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], successfully calling her parents for help.\n\nRay and Emma attempt to reach San Francisco in Ray's helicopter until it suffers a gearbox failure, forcing them to make an emergency landing at a [[shopping mall]] in [[Bakersfield]]. Amid the chaos of looting, Ray steals a truck to continue the journey. The pair encounter a couple broken down on the side of the road, shortly before the San Andreas Fault, which has torn a large fissure through the highway and extends for the perceivable length of the fault in either direction. Ray and Emma exchange the truck for an airplane the couple owns. As Blake, Ben, and Ollie attempt to reach [[Nob Hill, San Francisco|Nob Hill]] to signal the pair after finding their previous meeting point at [[Coit Tower]] engulfed in flames, Ray and Emma are forced to parachute into [[Oracle Park|AT&T Park]] just before a 9.6 magnitude quake hits, becoming the largest recorded earthquake in history.\n\nAs the quake subsides, having destroyed much of the city, Ray and Emma commandeer a boat to reach the group, only to realize a [[tsunami]] is approaching [[San Francisco Bay]]. Alongside a handful of other survivors in small boats, the two manage to cross the wave before it crests, barely avoiding a [[container ship]] caught up in the wave. The ship bisects the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]'s center span in half, killing everyone on the bridge, including Daniel, who is crushed to death by a falling [[shipping container]]. The tsunami proceeds to strike the ruined city, capsizing a cruise ship in the process, and killing thousands more. Blake, Ben, and Ollie enter the Gate, a building whose construction Daniel had been overseeing, but are still caught by the wave. As the building begins to collapse, trapping Blake underwater, Ray dives in, rescues her, and begins performing [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]]. Emma crashes the boat through a window and drives the five of them out of the collapsing building as Ray resuscitates Blake.\n\nThe survivors regroup at a relief camp on the other side of the bay, where the reconciled Ray and Emma talk about their future. On the remains of the Golden Gate Bridge an [[American flag]] unfolds, giving hope that the city will recover and rebuild, as rescue vehicles descend on the radically altered landscape of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], which has now extended from [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] to [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], turning the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] into an island.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Ray Gaines, a Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-rescue pilot\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Emma Gaines, Ray's estranged wife\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Blake Gaines, Ray and Emma's daughter\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as Daniel Riddick, Emma's boyfriend and owner of a civil engineering firm\n* [[Archie Panjabi]] as Serena Johnson, a news reporter\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Dr. Lawrence Hayes, a Caltech seismologist\n* [[Hugo Johnstone-Burt]] as Ben Taylor, Ollie's older brother, an English engineer and Blake's love interest\n* [[Art Parkinson]] as Ollie Taylor, Ben's younger brother\n* [[Will Yun Lee]] as Dr. Kim Park, a Caltech seismologist, and Lawrence's research partner and closest friend\n* [[Kylie Minogue]] as Susan Riddick, Daniel's sister\n\n\nAdditionally, [[Alec Utgoff]] portrays Alexi, Lawrence's student, [[Todd Williams (actor)|Todd Williams]] portrays Marcus Crowlings, a fellow Los Angeles Fire Department member, [[Marissa Neitling]] portrays Phoebe, Lawrence's student, [[Matt Gerald]] portrays Harrison Rhodes, a fellow Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-rescue pilot, [[Colton Haynes]] portrays Joby O'Leary, a fellow Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-rescue pilot, and [[Arabella Morton]] portrays Mallory Gaines, Ray and Emma's other daughter and Blake's sister, who drowned in a rafting accident.
