This is the first (and so far only) production made by both [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[TriStar Pictures]]. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $13 million at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the [[Santa Monica neighborhoods#Ocean Park Neighborhood|Dogtown area]] of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]]/[[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]] in the mid\u20131970s, surfers [[Tony Alva]], [[Stacy Peralta]], and [[Jay Adams]] enjoy the life of skating and surfing the pier with board designer [[Skip Engblom]] and the other locals. One day, Skip is given [[polyurethane]] wheels for the skateboards in his shop, Zephyr Surf Shop. Teenager Sid, a friend of the boys who works in the same shop, invites Tony, Jay, Stacy, and the other locals to test the new wheels. They are all amazed as the polyurethane wheels allow the skateboards to make the same carves on flat ground as surfboards on the waves. After witnessing what skaters could now do with the wheels, Skip decides to add to his already famous surf team a skate team, the [[Z-Boys]]. The team proves to be a success; winning many contests, Stacy, Jay, and Tony gain popularity from locals across Venice.\n\nA period of hot weather reduces the surf at the pier and the official declaration of a drought means swimming pools cannot be filled with water. Taking advantage of this the Z-Boys start sneaking into local backyard pools to skate in, ignoring Skip's practice sessions, which angers him. After winning many major contests, the Z-Boys become more and more famous, appearing in various magazines. Stacy, Jay, and Tony start getting noticed by major skating companies looking to take the boys from Skip. One night, Skip throws a party at his shop to celebrate the success of the team. A company owner, Topper Burks, enters the party and convinces Tony that Skip is holding him back and that it's time to make him famous worldwide. Tony accepts his offer and leaves the team. Jay leaves the team as well, looking to make more money to help his mom pay the rent on their apartment. Despite Skip's desperate offers to keep him on the team, Stacy is the last to leave, as he begins getting offers to skate as well as to appear on T.V. Sad and angry, Skip decides to shut down the Zephyr Skate Team.\n\nThe three boys become major celebrities. Tony and Stacy now skate for money rather than the passion that Jay continues to skate for. They become rivals and compete against each other in various contests. Stacy appears on the original ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' show while Tony starts creating his own commercials to manufacture his popular boards and merchandise. Jay is offered $10,000 to appear in a commercial sponsoring the toy, [[Slinky]]. However, he refuses, as he has become a much harder person than before. Soon, things start going out of control; at a major skating championship that they all take part in, Tony gets into a fight with another skater in the middle of the stadium and gets violently knocked out, hospitalizing him and temporarily halting his career. Jay leaves the company he had endorsed when they sacrifice quality for cheap materials. Stacy ends up winning the competition.\n\nBack in Venice, the pier that the Z-Boys use to surf around burns down, which affects them all. Jay shaves his hair and becomes a gang member. Skip, still selling surfboards in his shop, finally decides to settle down and continues his passion for sanding and creating surfboards, as well as solving his financial troubles by selling his shop and is seen singing \"[[Maggie May (Rod Stewart song)|Maggie May]]\". Sid's long-time equilibrium problem turns out to be caused by a [[brain tumor]], and he undergoes surgery. Though Stacy, Tony, and Jay have all gone their separate ways, they all show up at the same time to visit Sid. Stacy reveals that he is leaving his company to start his own. Sid's father empties their pool for them to skate in. Stacy, Tony, and Jay skate the pool and bring Sid into the fun on his wheelchair, referencing all the good times they had before they became a skate team.\n\nClosing cards reveal that Tony Alva went on to become skateboarding's first world champion and runs Alva Skates (stating that he still sneaks into backyard pools); Stacy Peralta started [[Powell Peralta]], a modern popular skating company that included a 14-year-old [[Tony Hawk]] as part of its Bones Brigade team; and Jay, too, achieved the only kind of success at skating and surfing he really cared about, becoming known as the \"spark that started the flame\" Original Seed, he was arrested on drug-related charges but was later released on parole and continues to skate and charge big waves in Hawaii; Sid later died of brain cancer shortly after the DOGBOWL sessions.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main cast===\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as [[Jay Adams]]\n* [[John Robinson (American actor)|John Robinson]] as [[Stacy Peralta]]\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as [[Tony Alva]]\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as [[Skip Engblom]]\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as Sid\n* [[Nikki Reed]] as Kathy Alva\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Philaine\n* [[William Mapother]] as Donnie\n* [[Vincent Laresca]] as Chino\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Billy Z\n* [[Mitch Hedberg]] as [[Frank Nasworthy]] \n* Stephanie Limb as [[Peggy Oki]]\n* Mike Ogas as Bob Biniak\n* [[Don Nguyen]] as [[Shogo Kubo]]\n* [[Melonie Diaz]] as Blanca\n* [[Eddie Cahill]] as Larry Gordon\n* [[Laura Ramsey]] as Gabrielle\n* Steve Badillo as [[Ty Page]]\n* [[Pablo Schreiber]] as [[Craig Stecyk]]\n* [[America Ferrera]] as Thunder Monkey\n* [[Sofia Vergara]] as Amelia\n* [[Chelsea Hobbs]] as Caroline\n* [[Ned Bellamy]] as Peter Darling\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Drake Landon\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Cameos===\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Topper Burks\n* [[Allen Sarlo]] as Himself\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as Nudie\n* [[Jay Adams]] as House party guest\n* [[Tony Alva]] as Oregon man at party\n* [[Stacy Peralta]] as TV director\n* [[Skip Engblom]] as Seattle race starter\n* [[Tony Hawk]] as Astronaut\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Jay Adams' manager\n* [[Joel McHale]] as TV reporter\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] as Tranny<!-- Yes, that's the actual character name. --><ref>{{Cite AV media |title=Lords of Dogtown |date=2005 |type=film |time=1:46:55}}</ref>\n* [[Bai Ling]] as Punky photographer\n* [[Lance Mountain]] as UK policeman\n* [[Craig Stecyk]] as Seattle race photographer{{div col end}}\n\n==Development==\nBoth [[David Fincher]] and [[Fred Durst]] were slated to direct the film, but [[Catherine Hardwicke]] eventually landed the job, and Fincher stayed on as executive producer.<ref name=mtvnews>Mancini, Rob (January 24, 2003).

Joe Donnelly, who knew Engblom, was impressed by Ledger's attention to detail, saying, \"He's almost eerie in how precisely he nailed not only the mannerisms, cadence and physical presence of Skip... but also how he raises Skip's spirit, which is the heart and soul and most what's really great in a not-altogether-great film.\"<ref name=davies/>\n\nLuke Davies of ''[[The Monthly]]'' concedes how flamboyant the character is, but says the film is saved by Ledger's emotional depth: \"The performance constantly sails close to hammy \u2013 Engblom was, by all accounts, a flamboyant character \u2013 but is pulled back, the wildness offset by a surprising depth of sadness.
