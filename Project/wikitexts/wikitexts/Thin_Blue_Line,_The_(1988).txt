Morris became interested in the case while doing research for a film about Dr. [[James Grigson]], a psychiatrist known in Texas as \"Dr. Death\" for testifying with \"100 percent certainty\" of a defendant's [[recidivism]] in many trials, including that of Randall Adams. The film centered around the \"inconsistencies, incongruities and loose ends\" of the case, and through his investigation, not only comes to a different conclusion, actually obtained an admission of Adams' innocence by the original suspect of the case, David Harris. The \"[[thin blue line]]\" in the title \"refers to what Mr. Morris feels is an ironic, mythical image of a protective policeman on the other side of anarchy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/ref/college/coll02film3.html?pagewanted=print|title=Film Dissects Murder and Justice - New York Times|last=October 23|first=ALVIN KLEIN Originally Published|last2=1988|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe film won many awards, but was a controversial film among documentary film critics, who felt the use of reenactment had no place in the documentary format.

Grigson does not appear once in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film presents a series of interviews about the investigation of the shooting of Dallas police officer Robert Wood and a re-enactment of the crime based on the testimony and recollections of Adams, Harris (the actual murderer), the judge presiding over the case (Donald J. Metcalfe), and several witnesses (including Emily Miller and R. L. Miller), as well as detectives (including Gus Rose, Jackie Johnson, and Marshall Touchton). Two attorneys (Edith James and Dennis White) who represented Adams at the trial where he was convicted also appear; they suggest that Adams was charged with the crime despite the evidence against Harris because Harris was a juvenile at the time, whereas Adams, as an adult, could be [[Death penalty|sentenced to death]] under Texas law. The prosecutor (Douglas D. Mulder) does not appear in the film.\n\nThe film's title comes from prosecutor Doug Mulder's phrase during his [[closing argument]] that the police are the \"[[The Thin Blue Line (emblem)|thin blue line]]\" separating society from \"[[anarchy]]\". This is a re-working of a line from [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem \"[[Tommy (Kipling poem)|Tommy]]\" in which he describes British soldiers (nicknamed \"[[Tommy Atkins]]\") as the \"thin red line\", from the color of their uniforms and their formation.\n\n== Style ==\nThe film makes use of dramatic re-enactments, a composed score, and interview testimony that takes the place of a narrator.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Resha, David.|title=The cinema of Errol Morris|date=April 8, 2015|isbn=978-0-8195-7535-7|location=Middletown, Connecticut|oclc=904598386}}</ref>\n\nMorris is often credited with re-purposing ''film noir'' aesthetic to the documentary format.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite book|last=Ferncase, Richard K.|title=Outsider features : American independent films of the 1980s|date=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-02936-3|location=Westport, Conn.|oclc=667291123}}</ref> Film scholar Charles Musser has credited Morris for using 'fiction film' techniques in ''The Thin Blue Line.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3500-the-thin-blue-line-a-radical-classic|title=The Thin Blue Line: A Radical Classic|last=Musser|first=Charles|website=The Criterion Collection|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Morris himself has claimed all of his films are brazenly \"anti-v\u00e9rit\u00e9\" in style.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=http://povmagazine.com/articles/view/errol-morris-speaks-out|title=Errol Morris Speaks Out! \u2013 Point of View Magazine|last=Toronto|first=Point of View Magazine \u2022 392-401 Richmond Street West \u2022|last2=email|first2=ON \u2022 M5V 3A8 \u2022 Canada \u2022639-0653 \u2022 Send us an|website=povmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nThe film's re-enactment scenes were built carefully from witnesses' statements.<ref name=\"Play-It-Again2\">{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Errol|url=http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/play-it-again-sam-re-enactments-part-one/index.html|title=Play It Again, Sam (Re-enactments, Part One)|date=April 3, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2008-03-11|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407180427/http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/play-it-again-sam-re-enactments-part-one/index.html|archive-date=April 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Morris is commonly credited with the invention of re-enactment scenes in documentary format, though this is untrue.<ref name=\":02\" /> Although the film recreates several versions of the shooting, it does not recreate one in which David Harris shoots the officer, the interpretation which it argues is true.\n\n== Production ==\nPrior to working on this film, Morris worked for several years as a private detective.<ref name=\":14\"/> Once fascinated by the Adams/Harris case, he applied those skills to his research on the film.\n\nHarris was later tried, convicted, and executed for committing the unrelated murder of Mark Walker Mays on September 1, 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/harris916.htm|title=David Ray Harris|website=clarkprosecutor.org|publisher=Office of the Clark County (Indiana) Prosecuting Attorney|access-date=2017-10-20}}</ref> On the weekend of that murder, Morris had an interview scheduled with Harris.

It was first used in ''[[Fast, Cheap & Out of Control]]'' (1997), and places Morris behind a curtain staring into one camera, which feeds into a teleprompter-like device on the camera in front of the interviewee, which causes the interviewee to look at and talk to the image of Morris, and, therefore, the camera directly, rather than to a person sitting off to one side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/content/eyecontact/interrotron.html|title=Errol Morris: Eye Contact|website=Errolmorris.com|access-date=November 16, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe final scene, in which Morris and Harris are only heard, while shots of a tape recorder appear from various angles, was not originally planned.

Miramax, the film's distributor, had originally picked it up for its unconventional look, and used marketing hooks to make the film \"transition from the arthouse to the multiplex\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schatz|first1=Thomas|title=Hollywood (Critical Concepts in Media and Cultural Studies)|page=382}}</ref> [[Harvey Weinstein]], the former head of Miramax, declared: \"Never has Miramax had a movie where a man's life hangs in the balance\". The poster for the film gave it the feel of a [[whodunit]], with the tagline: \"A [[softcore pornography|softcore]] movie, [[James Grigson|Dr. Death]], a chocolate milkshake, a nosy blonde and ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]''. Solving this mystery is going to be murder.\"\n\nWeinstein even sent a note to Errol Morris pushing him to promote the film better during interviews. The note read, in part, \"Heard your [[NPR]] interview and you were boring,\" and recommended the director sell the movie as a highly thrilling and emotional experience similar to watching thrillers or horror movies and that he adopt the usage of shorter and clearer sentences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/01/youre-boring.html|title=Letters of Note: You're boring|website=Lettersofnote.com|access-date=November 16, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''The Thin Blue Line'' grossed $1,209,846 in the US and Canada.<ref name=\"Mojo\"/> On its opening weekend, in only one theatre, it took in $17,814.<ref name=\"Mojo\"/> Although the film is the 95th highest grossing documentary film released since 1982,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=documentary.htm |title=Documentary Movies at the Box Office |publisher=Box Office Mojo |access-date=2011-07-30}}</ref> Morris says he lost money on the production.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.truthinjustice.org/adams.htm |title=Adams v.

The matter was settled out of court after Adams was granted sole use of anything written or made on the subject of his life.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0717FB39590C758CDDA10894D1484D81 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716192720/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0717FB39590C758CDDA10894D1484D81 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 16, 2012 |title=Freed Inmate Settles Suit With Producer Over Rights to Story |publisher=[[Dallas Morning News]] |date=Aug 6, 1989 |access-date=2008-03-11 }}</ref> Adams himself said of the matter: \"Mr. Morris felt he had the exclusive rights to my life story.

And he felt as though I had stolen something from him. Maybe I had, maybe I just don't understand what it's like to be in prison for that long, for a crime you hadn't committed. In a certain sense, the whole crazy deal with the release was fueled by my relationship with his attorney. And it's a long, complicated story, but I guess when people are involved, there's always a mess somewhere.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wpr.org/news/errol%20morris%20iv.cfm |title=An Interview with Errol Morris |publisher=[[Wisconsin Public Radio]] |date=July 2, 2004 |first=Brian |last=Bull |access-date=2008-03-11}}</ref>\n\nDespite being wrongly imprisoned for twelve years, Adams received no payment from the state of Texas. Had Adams been found to be wrongly convicted under today's law in Texas, he would get $80,000 for each year of incarceration. However, since Adams was released because his case was dismissed, and not because he was pardoned, he received no payment from the state after his release for his wrongful conviction.<ref name=\"DougMartin\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/us/26adams.html?_r=0 |title=Randall Adams, 61, Dies - Freed With Help of Film |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 25, 2011 |first=Douglas |last=Martin |access-date=2012-12-27}}</ref> Adams later worked as an anti-[[death penalty]] [[Activism|activist]].

Conversely, ''The Thin Blue Line'' suggests Adams' innocence by clouding a previously established history.<ref>Williams, Linda. \"Mirrors without Memories: Truth, History, and the New Documentary.\" Film Quarterly 46.3 (Spring, 1993): 9-21. JSTOR. Web. 26 Nov. 2010.</ref>\n\n''[[Stanford Law Review]]'' author Richard Sherwin believes ''The Thin Blue Line'' actually presents two plots. He says Morris presents one plot through the construction and ordering of the non-linear story, revealing an easy-to-follow narrative implicating Harris instead of Adams, not unlike the story that implicated Adams in the first place, because it presents an easy-to-believe retelling of history. The other plot, Sherwin says, is an example of \"postmodern skepticism\". Within this notion Sherwin notes sociologist [[Jean Baudrillard]]'s interpretation of the postmodern media landscape as \"flattening\" meaning as well as the impossibility of the existence of \"truth, authority, and history\".\n\nSherwin criticizes ''The Thin Blue Line'' for failing to resolve what he calls an \"acausal\" plot, referring to certain details about the case that were presented but remain unanswered, such as where Adams actually was the night of the crime (Adams himself answers this question by stating that he was watching TV in his motel room and fell asleep, but this is left without conclusive explanation, with Adams' brother, who was in the motel room at the time, not appearing in the movie to corroborate the explanation). Instead, the end of the film abandons the \"acausal\" plot by returning to the easy-to-believe narrative, that which paints Harris as the perpetrator. Sherwin argues that for the film to succeed as an affirmative postmodern work, it must contextualize the past events within a present narrative. He argues that it should take on the challenge, through the clouding of history, of resisting the lure of a narrative and fulfilling \"their sworn duty to convict only in the absence of reasonable doubt.\"<ref>Sherwin, Richard K. \"Law Frames: Historical Truth and Narrative Necessity in a Criminal Case.\" Stanford Law Review 47.1 (Nov., 1994): 39-83. JSTOR. Web. 23 Nov. 2010.</ref>\n\nIn an interview at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], Morris denied being postmodern in any way, and quipped: <blockquote>\"I am no post-modernist. I live in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. And one of the nice things about Cambridge, Massachusetts is that \"[[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]]\" isn't in the phone book.\n\nTo me, there's a physical world out there, pure and simple. There's a world where things actually happen. In ''The Thin Blue Line,'' it was of all-consuming importance to figure out who was driving that car; who pulled the gun out from underneath the seat, who shot the cop. Questions like these are not up for grabs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.errolmorris.com/content/interview/moma1999.html|title=Errol Morris: Interview|website=Errolmorris.com|access-date=November 16, 2021}}</ref> </blockquote>In a video interview for the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', Morris reiterates his view of an inherent value in truth, acknowledging that our view of history will always be flawed, but that truth should still be sought.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHNf4No5WtY|title=Recovering Reality: A Conversation with Errol Morris|access-date=November 16, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Thin Blue Lie]]'', a television film about police brutality in Philadelphia under the mayorship of [[Frank Rizzo]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Ren\u00e9e R.
