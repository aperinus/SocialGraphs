Directed by [[Robert Wise]] for [[RKO Pictures]], the feature was the first film noir production by Wise, whose later films in the [[genre]] include ''[[The Set-Up (1949 film)|The Set-Up]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Captive City (1952 film)|The Captive City]]'' (1952).<ref name=\"AFI\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nSan Francisco socialite Helen Brent has established residence in [[Reno, Nevada]] in order to get a divorce decree and is lodging in a boarding house, owned by the feisty Mrs. Kraft. Helen meets Laury Palmer, a fellow boarder and Mrs. Kraft's best friend, who confides that she is going on a date with Danny, to incite jealousy in her new beau, Sam Wilde.\n\nSam sees them together that evening. Later, he enters Mrs. Kraft's house, and confronts Danny. Sam bludgeons him to death, and then kills Laury, because she was a witness.\n\nHelen discovers the bodies and flees to [[San Francisco]], but does not contact the police. Sam also leaves for San Francisco that night; they meet each other at the train station and begin to travel together. Helen is attracted to his self-assurance. Back in Reno, Mrs. Kraft hires a private detective, Albert Arnett, to find Laury's killer.\n\nSeveral days later, Sam arrives unexpectedly at the mansion where Helen is living. It is owned by Georgia Staples, Helen's wealthy foster sister and the heir to her father's newspaper. Georgia finds Sam attractive. Sam tells Marty Waterman, his long-time roommate and [[enabler]], that he is going to marry Georgia for her newspaper money and the opportunity for higher social standing. Helen is distraught at their wedding.\n\nSam and Helen spar. Helen contradicts herself, telling Sam she loves her sister but she hates her for her money, then Sam kisses her. Martin has traveled to San Francisco for the wedding, and detective Arnett has tailed him there. After he interrogates the staff, Helen artfully reveals information about Sam's activities.\n\nGeorgia and Sam fight over Sam's demand to run the newspaper. He wants to run the paper so he can \"be on top,\" so that he can make and break people. He says Helen understands this because \"your roots are down here were mine are,\" and that they are soulmates.\n\nRegarding Georgia, Sam says she means no more to him than Fred Grover (her wealthy fianc\u00e9) does to her. Helen replies that without Fred, she is afraid of what she might become. Fred represents good and safety, while Sam represents strength and excitement and depravity. She is not alienated by these characteristics, in fact she becomes excited upon recalling the gruesome death scene back in Reno, and they passionately kiss.\n\nSam overhears a call to Helen from Reno, which leads him to believe she is against him. Helen meets with Arnett, and she bribes him to ignore Sam's role in the Reno murders.  Her motives are confused: she willfully provided information about Sam to Arnett, but now she wants to protect him.\n\nMrs. Kraft travels to San Francisco to meet with Arnett, so Martin meets with her also. Martin leads her to the dunes on the outskirts of town, and while Martin prepares to stab her, Sam shows up and kills him out of jealousy (he had seen Martin coming out of Helen's room).\n\nThe police interrogate the household about Martin's murder, and Helen reluctantly provides an alibi for Sam. Helen meets with Mrs. Kraft, who now knows that Sam killed Laury, and threatens her with a slow and painful death if she goes to the police.\n\nFred breaks up with Helen, and she panics. He feels that she doesn't have a heart anymore. She admits she's partially an \"iceberg of a woman\" and rotten as described, but that Fred can help her, that without him she \"doesn't stand a chance.\"\n\nWhen Helen declines to pay Arnett, he points out that the police will soon arrive for Sam, but she says it can't be too soon to get him out of the house. Helen reveals Sam's murders to Georgia, but she can't believe it. She realizes Helen didn't turn Sam in until she had lost Fred's money. Georgia cuts off Helen permanently.\n\nTo demonstrate that Sam doesn't really love Georgia, Helen embraces Sam, so Georgia throws them both out. Helen points out to Sam that Georgia must be eliminated for them to be happy. The police arrive, and Georgia reveals that it was Helen who called them, so Sam shoots Helen, then the police kill Sam.  Helen ultimately dies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}<!--Required for proper section/page formatting--> \n* [[Claire Trevor]] as Helen Brent\n* [[Lawrence Tierney]] as Sam Wilde\n* [[Walter Slezak]] as Albert Arnett\n* [[Phillip Terry]] as Fred Grover\n* [[Audrey Long]] as Georgia Staples\n* [[Elisha Cook Jr.]] as Marty Waterman\n* [[Isabel Jewell]] as Laury Palmer\n* [[Esther Howard]] as Mrs. Kraft\n* [[Tony Barrett]] as Danny\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nPre-production on the film began in early February 1945, more than two years before its release.

This female subjectivity enables a more nuanced view of the [[femme fatale]], a central motif in film noir, rather than what is usually shown. For example, the archetypical femme fatale's sexuality is merely a tool used to manipulate men for material gain. But in this film, Helen is a more complicated figure. She is drawn to Sam's brutality, although she is also interested in Fred's money. Instead of leading the male protagonist into darkness and ruin, it is she who is compromised by Sam. Moreover, her transgressions are a cause of anxiety for her. Her atypical concern over her dark turn results in contradictory behavior, like turning Sam, her lover, over to the police.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lindpor |first1=S |title=Female Subjectivity, Sexuality, and the Femme Fatale in Born to Kill |journal=Quarterly Review of Film and Video |date=March 2016 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=322\u201331 |doi=10.1080/10509208.2016.1144026 |s2cid=193103456 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10509208.2016.1144026?journalCode=gqrf20 |access-date=23 January 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Reception in 1947==\n[[Image:Tierney and Cook in Born to Kill.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Sam ([[Lawrence Tierney]]) attacking Marty ([[Elisha Cook, Jr.]]) in a jealous rage]]\n\nAt the time of its release in 1947, RKO's production was panned by [[Bosley Crowther]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', who called it \"a smeary tabloid fable\" and \"an hour and a half of ostentatious vice.\" His review concluded: \"Surely, discriminating people are not likely to be attracted to this film.

The end of the case, however, did not erase the additional negative attention that the trial had focused on ''Born to Kill'' and on RKO Pictures itself. In acquitting Lang in April 1949, Judge John A. Sbarbaro recommended the enactment of several new laws to help prevent such ghastly crimes by children, two of those recommendations being to restrict the content of comic books and \"to censor movies to the extent of holding theater managers liable for exhibiting 'harmful pictures'\".<ref>\"LANG ACQUITTED BY JUDGE IN 2D MURDER TRIAL: State Plans New Move to Confine Him\", ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', April 27, 1949. p. 7.</ref>\n\n==More recent assessments of the film==\nSome film critics have come to find ''Born to Kill'' something of a harmless guilty pleasure. In his 2003 reference work ''Film Noir Guide: 745 Films of the Classic Era, 1940-1959'', Michael Keaney describes ''Born to Kill'' as compelling despite its \"hard-to-swallow plot\".<ref name=\"Keaney\">Kearney, Michael. ''Film Noir Guide: 745 Films of the Classic Era, 1940-1959''. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, Inc., 2003, pp. 63-64.</ref> \"This one is all Tierney\", Keaney states. \"He's outstanding as one of the most violently disturbed psychos in all of film noir, giving even [[Robert Ryan]] in ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' a run for his money.\"<ref name=\"Keaney\"/>\n\nReviewing the film in 2006 for ''[[Slant Magazine]]'', critic Fernando F. Croce focuses on the production's director rather than on Tierney:{{blockquote|The usually meek Robert Wise trades his chameleonic tastefulness for full-on, jazzy misanthropy in this nasty melodrama ... Wise swims in the genre's amorality, scoring a kitchen brawl to big-band radio tunes, terrorizing a soused matron at a nocturnal beach skirmish, and leaving the last word to Walter Slezak's jovially corrupt detective.<ref>Croce, Fernando F. (2006) [https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/b-noir/ \"Born to Kill (Robert Wise, 1947)\" (review)] ''Slant Magazine''. Last accessed: January 19, 2019.</ref>}}\n\nIn 2009, writing for ''Film Monthly'', Robert Weston also focused his attention on Wise's directorial work: {{blockquote|This was the first and the nastiest of the noirs directed by Robert Wise ... Wise came to the genre with a background in the [[Val Lewton]] horror team and the expressionistic films of [[Orson Welles]], so he was the right tool for the job when it came to film noir ... As the title suggests, ''Born to Kill'' is a film about the grimmest corners of the human condition, the wicked place where sex, corruption and violence join hands and rumba round in darkness.<ref>Weston, Robert (October 2, 2001) [http://www.filmmonthly.com/film_noir/born_to_kill.html \"Born to Kill (1947)\" (review)]  ''Film Monthly''.
