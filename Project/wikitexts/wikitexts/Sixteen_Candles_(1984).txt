Written and directed by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], it was the first in a string of films Hughes would direct centering on teenage life. The film was a box office success, earning $23.6 million against a $6.5 million budget, and launched Ringwald to fame.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Plot summaries for films are usually between the required limit of 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[suburban]] [[Chicago]], [[High school#United States|high school]] [[sophomore]] Samantha \"Sam\" Baker is hopeful her 16th birthday is the beginning of a great new year, but is shocked when her family forgets the occasion because her older, beautiful, self-absorbed sister Ginny is getting married the next day.\n\nAt school, Sam fills out a friend's sex quiz where she reveals her crush on [[Senior (education)|senior]] Jake Ryan. Meanwhile, Jake, having noticed Sam's looks at him, asks his friend Rock about her. Rock dismisses her as an immature child, but Jake says he is frustrated by his girlfriend Caroline's partying ways. On the [[school bus|bus]] ride home, Sam fends off repeated flirtations from [[geek]]y [[freshman]] Ted.\n\nAt home, Sam's day gets worse when she discovers she must sleep on the sofa because her grandparents and a [[Student exchange program|foreign exchange]] student named [[Long Duk Dong]] are all staying at the house for the wedding. She is further upset when her grandparents also do not remember her birthday and have Dong go with her to a dance at school that night.\n\nAt the dance, Sam pines for Jake while Dong has attracted the powerful and strong [[Jock (stereotype)|jock]], Marlene. Ted, in an effort to impress his friends Bryce and Wease, dances with Sam, who runs off in tears. In an effort to salvage his reputation with all the geeks, Ted bets Bryce and Wease a dozen [[floppy disk]]s that he will get physical with Sam before the dance ends. As proof, Bryce and Wease demand Sam's underwear.  Jake asks Ted about Sam, having seen them dancing.\n\nTed apologizes to Sam, who opens up about her family forgetting her birthday and her crush on Jake. Ted tells her that Jake asked about her and Sam is shocked and asks what Ted thinks she should do. Despite his genuine interest in Sam, Ted encourages her to talk to Jake, and she agrees. Before she leaves, he gets her underwear to win his bet and he, Bryce, and Wease charge the other freshmen boys a dollar to see it. Meanwhile, Sam tries to approach Jake, but loses her nerve and runs off.  Jake and Caroline leave the dance, leaving Sam thinking Jake does not like her.\n\nAt Jake's house, Caroline and her friends have started a wild party.  Jake, angry with Caroline, retreats to his bedroom and tries calling Sam, but instead is yelled at by her grandparents for waking them up, and tell him that Sam isn't interested.  After the party, Jake is furious at the damage left behind. He finds Ted trapped under a glass coffee table after having knocked over the beer can pyramid the night before. Ted tells him Sam is interested in him and Jake confesses that he has lost interest in Caroline. He takes Sam's underwear from Ted and, in exchange, lets Ted take a drunken Caroline home in his father's [[Rolls-Royce Corniche|Rolls Royce]]. To further impress the geeks, Ted stops at Bryce and Wease's house to get Wease to take a picture of him with Caroline in the expensive car, but the finished picture only reveals the top of Ted's head.\n\nSam's father apologizes for forgetting her birthday, and tells her that if Jake does not see what a wonderful person she is, then he is not worth Sam's time. She lies on the couch thinking of Jake, not knowing that he is also thinking of her.\n\nThe next morning, Sam's mother apologizes to her for forgetting her birthday, and everyone heads to the church for the wedding. Jake arrives at Sam's house, where a hungover Dong miscommunicates that Sam is at church getting married. Jake finds Caroline and Ted making out in the back of his dad's banged-up car, and they break up. Jake then surprises Sam at the church after the wedding and invites her back to his house.\n\nThat night, Jake gives Sam her underwear, and a birthday cake with 16 candles on it. He tells her to make a wish and she tells him her wish already came true. They kiss as the film fades to black.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Samantha \"Sam\" Baker\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Ted \"Farmer Ted\" Farmer / The Geek\n* [[Michael Schoeffling]] as Jake Ryan\n* [[Haviland Morris]] as Caroline Mulford\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as [[Long Duk Dong]]\n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Mr. Jim Baker\n* [[Carlin Glynn]] as Mrs. Brenda Baker\n* [[Blanche Baker]] as Ginny Baker\n* [[Justin Henry]] as Mike Baker\n* [[Edward Andrews]] as Grandpa Howard Baker\n* [[Billie Bird]] as Grandma Dorothy Baker\n* [[Carole Cook]] as Grandma Helen\n* [[Max Showalter]] as Grandpa Fred\n* [[Liane Curtis]] as Randy\n* [[John Cusack]] as Bryce\n* Darren Harris as Cliff \"Wease\"\n* Deborah Pollack as Marlene \"Lumberjack\"\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Geek Girl\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Reverend\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Robin\n* [[John Kapelos]] as Rudy Ryszczyk\n* [[Zelda Rubinstein]] as Organist\n\n==Production==\n[[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] had asked his agent for headshots of young actresses, and among those he received were those of [[Robin Wright]], Molly Ringwald and [[Ally Sheedy]]. Sheedy had auditioned for the role of Sam, but was dropped because Hughes thought Ringwald was more fitting for the role. He called her a year later to give her a role in ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''.
