Richardson also served as executive producer. The film is based on ''[[Timecop (comics)|Timecop]]'', a story created by Richardson, written by Verheiden, and drawn by [[Ron Randall]], which appeared in the [[anthology comic]] ''[[Dark Horse Comics]]'', published by ''Dark Horse Comics''.  It is the first installment in the [[Timecop (franchise)|''Timecop'' franchise]].\n\nThe film stars [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Max Walker, a police officer in 1994 and later a [[United States|U.S.]] [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] agent in 2004, when [[time travel]] has been made possible. It also stars [[Ron Silver]] as a corrupt politician and [[Mia Sara]] as Melissa Walker, the agent's wife. The story follows Walker's life as he fights time-travel crime and investigates the politician's plans.\n\n''Timecop'' remains Van Damme's highest-grossing film as a lead actor (his second to break the $100&nbsp;million barrier worldwide), having become a [[cult classic]] with fans. Although met with mixed reviews, it is generally regarded by critics as one of Van Damme's best films.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1863 [[Gainesville, Georgia]], a time traveller with modern laserdot-equipped machine-pistols slaughters [[Confederate States Army]] soldiers and steals their shipment of gold.\n\nIn 1994, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] sends George Spota to the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Appropriations Committee]] for approval on a secret project: the establishment of the Time Enforcement Commission (TEC) to police the new threat of time travel. Spota convinces them that changes to history are already manifesting, evidenced by arms trafficking shipments paid for in stolen Confederate [[gold bar|bullion]]. Senator Aaron McComb volunteers to chair the oversight committee and Eugene Matuzak is nominated as the TEC's first commissioner. [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|DC Metro Police officer]] Max Walker considers accepting a position with the TEC. Leaving home, he and his wife Melissa are attacked by unknown assailants. Walker is left for dead as the house explodes, killing Melissa.\n\nTen years later, Walker is a veteran TEC agent, and is sent back to October 1929 to prevent his former partner Lyle Atwood profiting from the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]]. Atwood admits to working for Senator McComb, who is abusing his oversight of time travel technology to raise funds for his upcoming presidential campaign. Fearing McComb will erase him from history, Atwood jumps to his death, but Walker catches him mid-leap and returns them to 2004. Refusing to testify, Atwood is sentenced to death and returned to 1929 to complete his fatal fall. Walker and Matuzak agree McComb is a criminal, but need solid evidence.\n\nSurviving an ambush by McComb\u2019s henchmen, Walker is assigned a new partner, TEC rookie Sarah Fielding. They are sent back to 1994 to investigate McComb, and witness a disagreement with his business partner Jack Parker over manufacturing a new computer chip. They are interrupted by McComb from 2004, who advises his younger self that the chip will become highly profitable. The older McComb warns his younger self that they must not touch because the same matter cannot occupy the same space, then kills Parker. Fielding turns on Walker, revealing she works for McComb. After a shootout with McComb's henchmen, Fielding is wounded and Walker escapes back to 2004.\n\nArriving in an altered future where McComb is a wealthy presidential frontrunner and has shut down the TEC, Walker appeals to Matuzak, who has no knowledge of the changes to history. They realize that the original time machine prototype was never dismantled and that McComb has access, allowing him to neutralize the TEC. Matuzak sends Walker back to the past to restore history, and is shot by agents of the now-corrupt TEC.\n\nBack in 1994, Walker finds Fielding in the hospital. She agrees to testify against McComb, but is murdered in her room. At the hospital, Walker finds a record of a recent visit by Melissa, discovering she was pregnant. Realizing she will be killed that night, he finds her and reveals himself to be from the future, and she agrees to make sure his younger self stays home.\n\nThat night, the younger Walker is attacked just as before by McComb's men, but is unknowingly aided by his older self. McComb from 2004 takes Melissa hostage and confronts the older Walker with the bomb that will blow up the house, knowing he will die in the ensuing explosion but satisfied his younger self will become president with Walker gone. However, Walker reveals he has lured the younger McComb to the house; he pushes them together, and the two McCombs merge into a writhing, screaming mass before disappearing from existence. The older Walker escapes with Melissa as the bomb explodes, leaving her beside his unconscious younger self and returning to the future.\n\nBack in 2004, Walker finds the future changed once again: Matuzak and Fielding are alive with the TEC at full strength, while Senator McComb disappeared in 1994. Walker returns home to find Melissa alive and waiting for him, now with their young son.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Agent Max Walker\n* [[Mia Sara]] as Melissa Walker\n* [[Ron Silver]] as Senator Aaron McComb\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Commander Eugene Matuzak\n* [[Gloria Reuben]] as Agent Sarah Fielding\n* [[Scott Bellis]] as Ricky\n* Jason Schombing as Agent Lyle Atwood\n* [[Scott Lawrence]] as George Spota\n* [[Kenneth Welsh]] as Senator Utley\n* [[Brad Loree]] as Reyes\n* [[Kevin McNulty (actor)|Kevin McNulty]] as Jack Parker\n* [[Gabrielle Rose (actress)|Gabrielle Rose]] as Judge Marshall\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as Stranger\n* Steven Lambert as Lansing\n* Richard Faraci as Cole\n* [[Veena Sood]] as Nurse\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Mike Richardson]] wrote a three-part story titled \"Time Cop: A Man Out of Time\" that was included in the launch of the [[Dark Horse Comics]] [[anthology series]] in 1992.<ref name=\"CBR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/adaptations-more-famous-than-original-comics/|title=15 Adaptations More Famous Than The Original Comics |last=Cohen|first=Jason|work=[[CBR.com]]|date=2017-04-20|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> Richardson developed the story, while the comic was written by [[Mark Verheiden]] and drawn by [[Ron Randall]]. The comic told a story of Max Walker, a Time Enforcement Commission agent whose wife is implied to be dead (though the circumstances of this are unknown). Max pursues an illegal time traveler robbing a South African diamond mine in the 1930s. After capturing the robber and returning to present time, Walker realizes the timeline has been damaged because the criminal's robotic bodyguard remained in the past and was still active. Walker returns to the 1930s and defeats the robot with the help of a local whom he rewards with a diamond. Returning home, the timeline is largely restored but readers see the local became a political leader who helped end Apartheid.\n\nRichardson and Verheiden then teamed up to write the screenplay for the movie adaptation.<ref name=\"CBR\"/>\n\n{{Blockquote|text=It wasn\u2019t at all planned from the beginning that I would make two films with Jean-Claude Van Damme back-to-back. I was approached to do ''Timecop'', and I loved the auspices. (Producer) Larry Gordon was involved with it; Moshe Diamant was a terrific producer; Sam Raimi was involved... It was a really clever story, and I thought it was a chance to make the best movie Van Damme ever made. I said yes and we made it, and it was clear that it was going to be a hit because it previewed through the roof every time. It\u2019s still his biggest hit. So Universal and Moshe Diamant wanted to team us again as soon as possible, so they put Sudden Death together. There was never any question that we would just do Timecop 2.
