Starring Campbell and [[Embeth Davidtz]], it is the third installment in the ''[[Evil Dead]]'' franchise, and a sequel to ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', and follows [[Ash Williams]] (Campbell) as he is trapped in the [[Middle Ages]] and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.\n\nThe film was produced as part of a production deal with [[Universal Pictures]] after the financial success of ''[[Darkman]]''. Filming took place in California in 1991. The makeup and creature effects for the film were handled by two different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] and his company [[Alterian, Inc.]], were responsible for the makeup effects for Ash and Sheila, while Kurtzman, Nicotero & Berger EFX Group was credited for the remaining special makeup effects characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bookofthedead.ws/website/army_of_darkness_credits.html |title=Book Of The Dead - The Definitive Evil Dead Website |publisher=Bookofthedead.ws |access-date=November 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112070105/http://bookofthedead.ws/website/army_of_darkness_credits.html |archive-date=November 12, 2016 |url-status = live|df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Tom Sullivan (special effects artist)|Tom Sullivan]], who had previously worked on ''[[Within the Woods]]'', ''[[The Evil Dead]]'', and ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', also contributed to the visual effects.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Uram|first=Sue|date=August 1992|title=Evil Effects: Tom Sullivan, Gore Auteur|url=|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|publisher=|volume=23|issue=1|page=50|issn=0145-6032}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://love-it-loud.co.uk/interview-with-tom-sullivan-the-evil-dead/|title=Interview with Tom Sullivan (The Evil Dead)|website=Love-It-Loud|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219012020/http://love-it-loud.co.uk/interview-with-tom-sullivan-the-evil-dead/|archive-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Army of Darkness'' premiered at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] on October 9, 1992, and was released in the United States on February 19, 1993. It grossed $21.5 million total over its $11 million budget, and received positive reviews, though notably less than the first two films. Since its video release, it has acquired a [[Cult film|cult following]], along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to ''The Evil Dead'' sales agent and ''Evil Dead II'' executive producer [[Irvin Shapiro]], who died before the film's production in 1989.\n\n== Plot ==\nHaving been accidentally transported to the [[Middle Ages]],{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' (1987).}} [[Ash Williams]] is captured by [[King Arthur|Lord Arthur]]'s men, who suspect him of being a spy for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his [[shotgun]] and [[chainsaw]] are confiscated, and he is taken to Arthur's castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding that Henry and his men be set free and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.\n\nAccording to the Wise Man, the only way that Ash can return to his time is through the magical ''[[Necronomicon#In popular culture|Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (Book of the Dead)]].'' Ash then starts his search for the ''Necronomicon''. As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, and he crashes into a mirror. Small reflections of Ash in the mirror shards come to life, with one becoming a life-sized copy of him, after which Ash kills and buries it.\n\nWhen he arrives at the ''Necronomicon''{{'}}s location, he finds three books instead of one, and has to determine which one is real. Realizing at the last moment that he has forgotten the last word of the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely{{snd}} \"[[Klaatu barada nikto]]\"{{snd}} he tries to mumble and cough his way through the pronunciation. He grabs the book and begins rushing back. Meanwhile, unknown to Ash, his ruse has failed and his body's copy rises from the dead, uniting other Deadites into the Army of Darkness.\n\nUpon his return, Ash demands to be returned to his own time. However, Sheila is abducted by a flying Deadite and later transformed into one. Ash becomes determined to lead the outnumbered humans against the Army, and the people reluctantly agree. Using knowledge from textbooks in his 1973 [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the soldiers to victory over the Deadites and their captain, saves Sheila, and brings peace between Arthur and Henry. Using a passage from the ''Necronomicon'', the Wise Man tells him how to return to the present by giving him a potion after reciting the same phrase as earlier.\n\nBack in the present, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at the S-Mart department store. As he talks to a female co-worker who is interested in his story, a surviving Deadite, present because Ash once again forgot the last word, attacks the customers. Ash kills it using a [[Winchester rifle]] and exclaims, \"Hail to the king, baby\", before passionately kissing the female co-worker.\n\n===Original ending===\nFor the film's original ending, using a passage from the ''Necronomicon'', the Wise Man tells Ash to swallow six drops of the potion to return to the present; unfortunately, due to a distraction by falling rocks, Ash miscalculates the amount of potion needed to be able to correctly return to his own time, swallowing seven instead of six. As a result, he wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed, and he screams in dismay at having overslept. Universal Pictures objected to this climax, feeling that it was too negative and depressing in tone, and so a more positive and optimistic ending was filmed and ultimately incorporated into the theatrical cut.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=159}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/canceled-movie-twists-saved/|title=10 Canceled Twists That Would've Saved Movies (And 10 That Would've Hurt Them)|author=Leon Miller|date=July 30, 2018|work=ScreenRant|access-date=August 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823105451/https://screenrant.com/canceled-movie-twists-saved/|archive-date=August 23, 2018|url-status = live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lukethompson/2018/08/21/bruce-campbell-ash-vs-evil-dead-3-sam-raimi-rob-tapert-lucy-lawless-starz/|title=Bruce Campbell Talks 'Ash Vs.

''Evil Dead II'', according to [[Bruce Campbell]], \"was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made\".{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=143}} Promotional drawings were created and published in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot. The working title for the project was ''Medieval Dead'', before it was later known as ''Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness''.{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=107}} The title \"Army of Darkness\" came from an idea by [[Irvin Shapiro]], during the production of ''Evil Dead II''.<ref>Sam Raimi. DVD audio commentary, 3:12.</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nInitially, Raimi invited [[Scott Spiegel]] to co-write ''Army of Darkness'' because he had done a good job on ''Evil Dead II'', but he was busy on rewrites for the [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[The Rookie (1990 film)|The Rookie]]''.{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=140}} After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called ''Easy Wheels'', Sam and his brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] decided to co-write the film together.{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=142}} They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of ''Darkman''.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=152}} After filming ''Darkman'', they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan \"has a good sense of character\" and that he brought more comedy into the script.{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=142}} Campbell remembers, \"We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting\".{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=143}} Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=145}}\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=152}} ''Darkman'' was also a financial success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so ''Army of Darkness'' became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget.{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=144}} However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer [[Robert Tapert]] to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=152}} Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from [[Victor Fleming]]'s film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in ''Army of Darkness''.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=153}} A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the ''Joan of Arc'' storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=153}}\n\n[[Traci Lords]] was among the actresses auditioning for the film, saying in 2001, \"I didn't get the part but I clicked with Bruce [Campbell],\" with whom she would later work as a guest star in the TV series ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://scifi.com/transcripts/2001/tracilords.html | title=Traci Lords |publisher= (chat transcript), [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] | date = January 25, 2001 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030729085136/http://scifi.com/transcripts/2001/tracilords.html | archive-date=July 29, 2003}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place between soundstage and on-location work. ''Army of Darkness'' was filmed in [[Bronson Canyon]] and [[Vasquez Rocks|Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park]]. The interior shots were filmed on an [[Front projection|Introvision]] stage in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. Raimi's use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the [[stop-motion animation]] work of [[Ray Harryhausen]].{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=153}} Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional [[rear projection]] that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=153}} According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was \"the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character\".<ref name=\"Robley\">{{cite news | last = Robley | first = Les Paul | title = Mobilizing ''Army of Darkness'' via \"Go-Animation\" |work=[[American Cinematographer]] |page = 74 | date = March 1993 }}</ref>\n\nShooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days.{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=147}} It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near [[Acton, California|Acton]], California, on the edge of the [[Mojave Desert]], the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=155}} Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene.{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=151}} Money problems forced cinematographer [[Bill Pope]] to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=156}}\n\nIt was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=157}} Mesa remembers, \"Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes\".{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=157}} Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live-action skeleton puppets that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=157}}\n\nDuring the filming of a scene in which Campbell flipped a stuntman down a set of stairs, the lower part of his face contacted with a piece of armor, which resulted in him bleeding.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=211\u2013212}} Campbell was brought to a local [[emergency room]] to have the wound mended by a [[plastic surgeon]], who, upon seeing the number of artificial cuts and slashes on Campbell's face, asked, \"Which one is it?\"{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=211\u2013212}} In order to maintain the continuity of the injuries and dirt on Ash's face, the on-set makeup specialist utilized a plastic template that fit over Campbell's face.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=211\u2013212}}\n\nThe filmmakers initially intended to reshoot the shot from ''Evil Dead II'' in which Ash and the Oldsmobile fall from the sky onto the ground of medieval England, with Campbell later stating that the reason they sought to reshoot it rather than reusing the footage from the previous film was due to \"a rights issue\".{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=212\u2013213}} Campbell was intended to jump from a ladder onto the ground, and the Oldsmobile dropped from its suspension on an aircraft cable attached to a crane on a nearby access road.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=213}} However, the support legs under the crane gave out, causing the car to prematurely crash to the ground and the crane to fall off a cliff into a gravel pit.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=213}} Campbell noted that, \"Ironically, after all the hassle, we wound up using the footage from 1986.\"{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=213}}\n\n===Post-production===\nWhile [[Dino De Laurentiis]] gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=159}} Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=159}} In this ending, the potion Ash is given causes him to oversleep, and when he wakes up he is in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic wasteland. A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with [[Bridget Fonda]].{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=159}} Raimi recalls, \"Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero\".{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=156}}\n\nRaimi needed $3 million to finish his film, but Universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with De Laurentiis over the rights to the [[Hannibal Lecter]] character which Universal needed so that they could film a [[Hannibal (2001 film)|sequel]] to ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.{{sfn|Muir|2004|p=162}} The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for ''Army of Darkness''' was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.\n\nFor the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of the [[Frank Frazetta]]-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film.{{sfn|Warren|2000|p=158}} Raimi ran into further troubles when the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being killed early on in the film.
