The film came from Saulnier's desire to direct a thriller set in a [[green room]].\n\nPrincipal photography took place during October 2014 in [[Portland, Oregon]].

After their gig is cancelled, a radio host arranges a new show in a rural area outside [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] through his cousin, Daniel. Arriving at the venue, they realize it's a [[neo-Nazi skinhead]] bar and they're opening for an [[National Socialist black metal|NSBM]] band, Cowcatcher. They go ahead with the show anyway. During their set, Pat notes two young women, Emily and Amber, looking disturbed and being shepherded out of sight.\n\nAs the band is about to leave, Pat returns to the bar's [[green room]] to retrieve Sam's cellphone, where he stumbles upon Amber and the members of Cowcatcher standing over the body of Emily, who's been stabbed to death by Werm. Pat calls the police as he flees, but is caught, and bar employees Gabe and Big Justin capture the rest of the band and confine them in the green room with Amber. Gabe pays one young skinhead to stab another to create a cover story for the police who respond to Pat's call. He consults with the bar's owner, skinhead leader Darcy, who decides all witnesses need to be eliminated. He arranges for Cowcatcher to be gifted poisoned heroin, while more skinheads assemble at the bar, waiting until nightfall to kill the band and Amber.\n\nThe band overpowers Big Justin and holds him hostage, taking his pistol and a [[boxcutter]] from his pocket. They negotiate through the door with Darcy, who asks them to surrender the pistol. Pat agrees, on the condition that they keep the bullets, but when he opens the door, the men attempt to force their way in while slashing at his arm. They manage to close the door, however Pat loses the gun and is seriously injured. Big Justin attempts to break free, leading Reece to choke him unconscious. Amber slashes Big Justin's stomach open with the boxcutter.\n\nThe band tears up the floorboards and discovers a drug lab under the bar, but the only exit is locked from the outside. Arming themselves with improvised weapons, they attempt to fight their way out. Neo-Nazi Clark unleashes a [[fighting dog]] which kills Tiger. Amber and Pat drive the dog away with microphone feedback. Reece escapes through a window, only to be stabbed to death by Alan. Pat, Amber, and Sam retreat to the green room.\n\nDaniel arrives and Darcy sends him in to kill the remaining survivors, claiming they murdered Emily, his girlfriend. However, he instead talks to them, and Amber explains that Werm murdered Emily after discovering she and Daniel were planning to leave the skinhead life. Daniel agrees to help them escape, but as they venture back out into the bar, he is shot dead by the bartender. Pat kills the bartender and the group takes his shotgun, only to find themselves confronted by the full skinhead force. Sam mortally wounds Clark's dog with the shotgun before it kills her, and Amber is shot as she and Pat once again retreat to the green room.\n\nWith the sun rising soon, Darcy has most of the skinheads disperse, taking Clark and Alan with him to stage the band's deaths to make it look as if they were killed while trespassing on his property. Gabe prepares to clean up the bar, while Jonathan and Kyle are dispatched with the dog to finish off Pat and Amber, who formulate a plan for a last stand. They again use microphone feedback to scare off the dog before Pat lures Jonathan into the drug lab. As Kyle stands watch in the green room, Amber emerges from under the cushions of the couch and ambushes him, cutting his throat with the boxcutter. Pat and Jonathan fight, and Amber sneaks up and shoots Jonathan in the head. Gabe enters the green room to find his companions dead, and surrenders to Pat and Amber.\n\nHolding Gabe at gunpoint, they trek through the woods. As they near Darcy's house, Pat and Amber decide to go after him, while Gabe goes to a nearby farm to call the authorities. Pat and Amber kill Clark and Alan before confronting Darcy. Fleeing, Darcy pulls a revolver but is shot dead. Their ammunition gone, Pat and Amber sit on the side of the road. They are at first shocked to see Clark's dog, expecting it to attack. They see it mournfully lay near Clark's body. They leave the dog be, not seeing it as a threat. Energy spent, they wait for the police.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as Pat, the bassist of the Ain't Rights\n* [[Imogen Poots]] as Amber, Emily's friend \n* [[Alia Shawkat]] as Sam, the guitarist of the Ain't Rights\n* [[Joe Cole (actor)|Joe Cole]] as Reece, the drummer of the Ain't Rights\n* [[Callum Turner]] as Tiger, the singer of the Ain't Rights\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as Darcy Banker, the leader of the skinheads \n* [[Macon Blair]] as Gabe, a skinhead and club employee\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as Daniel, a skinhead and Tad's cousin in a relationship with Emily \n* Kai Lennox as Clark, a skinhead and [[Dog fighting|dogfight]] breeder\n* [[Eric Edelstein]] as Big Justin, a skinhead bouncer\n* [[David W.
