Online at Latimes.com, retrieved 16 May 2015.</ref>\n}}\n'''''The Bear''''' is a 1988 French [[adventure film|adventure]] [[children's film|family film]] directed by [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]] and released by [[TriStar Pictures]]. Adapted from the novel ''[[The Grizzly King]]'' (1916) by American author [[James Oliver Curwood]], the screenplay was written by [[G\u00e9rard Brach]]. Set in [[British Columbia, Canada]], the film tells the story of an orphaned [[grizzly bear]] cub who befriends a large adult male [[Kodiak bear]] as two trophy hunters pursue them through the wild.\n\nSeveral of the themes explored in the story include orphanhood, peril and protection, and mercy toward and on the behalf of a reformed hunter. Annaud and Brach began planning the story and production in 1981, although filming did not begin until six years later, due to the director's commitment to another project. ''The Bear'' was filmed almost entirely in the Italian and Austrian areas of the [[Dolomites]], with live animals\u2014including [[Bart the Bear]], a trained {{convert|2.74|m|ft|adj=on}} tall Kodiak bear\u2014present on location. Notable for its almost complete lack of dialogue and its minimal score, the film was nominated for and won numerous international film awards.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=October 2022}}\n{{long plot|date=October 2022}}\nIn 1885, in the mountainous wilds of British Columbia, Canada, a male [[grizzly bear]] cub and his mother are digging and searching for honey to eat when the mother is suddenly crushed to death and buried by a rockslide, leaving the cub orphaned. Forced to fend for himself, the cub struggles to find food and shelter.\n\nElsewhere in the mountains, a male [[Kodiak bear]] roams free in the forest, but is\u00a0unknowingly being pursued and hunted by two trophy hunters, Tom and Bill. Tom attempts to shoot the Kodiak in order to claim the animal as a trophy, but his gunshot only grazes the bear's shoulder and the wounded animal flees. Shortly after, Tom and Bill hear crashing noises and the sounds of their tied up horses. The men discover two of their three horses missing and claw marks from the Kodiak on the trees. Bill finds one horse that was killed and mutilated by the bear while Tom finds the other one frightened and mortally wounded from being attacked by the beast. While attempting to control the horse, Tom is lifted by the animal's reigns and sprains his leg. Bill makes a promise to hunt and kill the bear for revenge.\n\nThe cub later comes across the Kodiak, and, noticing his wound, attempts to help him, but the Kodiak warns the cub away, emphasizing he doesn't need support. The cub persists and approaches him again, managing to soothe his wound by licking it. A friendship forms between the two bears as the Kodiak adopts the cub as his foster son, teaching him how to catch [[salmon]] and hunt animals such as [[mule deer]] for food. That evening, the cub suffers from nightmares where he relives the tragic death of his mother. While journeying through the mountains, the Kodiak and the cub come across a lone female grizzly who the Kodiak becomes infatuated with, whereupon the two bears perform a [[courtship display|mating ritual]], with the Kodiak impressing the female by showing off his strength before [[mating]] with her afterwards in a private area of the forest.\n\nDetermined to find and track down the Kodiak, the two hunters are joined by a third man and his pack of vicious [[Beauceron]]s, in addition to Tom's [[Airedale Terrier]]. Both bears, sensing danger, attempt to escape by climbing up a cliff in the mountains for safety as the dog pack follow them in pursuit. While the cub hides in a cave, the Kodiak ferociously fights off the pack in order to protect the cub. Despite suffering grievous wounds from the dogs, the Kodiak manages to kill some of them before giving up and escaping over a pass with the remaining pack members chasing after him, leaving the cub behind. The hunters arrive to find the bodies of some of their dogs, including Tom's (whom Bill sorrowfully shoots dead), killed from their violent fight with the Kodiak. The men spot the lone cub and capture him, taking him back to their camp where he is tethered to a tree and tormented by the men and their remaining dogs. That night, the hunters plot how to massacre the Kodiak, though unbeknownst to them, they are being watched over and stalked by the bear.\n\nThe next day, the hunters split up, with Tom manning a spot high on a cliff near a waterfall. He leaves his post to wash up in a small waterfall in the hills. His gun out of reach, Tom suddenly finds himself confronted by the Kodiak, who aggressively bellows at the sight of him. Faced with certain death, Tom cowers and expects to be mauled. Upon seeing that Tom is at his mercy, the Kodiak refuses to kill him and leaves. Tom, amazed by the bear's act of mercy, attempts to scare him off more quickly by shooting his gun in the air. When Bill joins him, Tom lies that the bear is dead. When Bill catches sight of the Kodiak ascending a [[scree]], he raises his rifle to shoot, only to be intercepted by Tom, who insists they let the animal go free instead. The three hunters return to their camp empty-handed, where they release the cub and then ride off into the wilderness.\n\nAlone again, the cub is soon stalked and attacked by a [[cougar]], who chases the cub until it corners him near a stream. The cub, despite getting injured by the cougar's attacks, desperately growls for help. However, the cougar, upon seeing the sight of the Kodiak behind the cub, suddenly stops and flees after the Kodiak viciously roars at it for harming the cub, saving his life in the process. The cub, surprised that the Kodiak saved his life, happily reunites with him and runs to his side, where his foster father comforts him and licks away the cub's wounds that he suffered from being attacked by the cougar. As winter approaches, the two bears find shelter in a cave for [[hibernation]], where they peacefully fall asleep together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bart the Bear]] as The Kodiak Bear\n* Youk the Bear as The Bear Cub\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Tom\n* [[Jack Wallace (actor)|Jack Wallace]] as Bill\n* Andre Lacombe as The dog hunter\n\n== Production ==\n=== Sources ===\n[[File:Grizzly King title page.png|thumb|left|Frontispiece of [[James Oliver Curwood]]'s ''[[The Grizzly King]]'' (1916)]]\nAmerican author [[James Oliver Curwood]]'s novella ''[[The Grizzly King]]'' was published in 1916. The story was based on several trips he took to British Columbia, and the young hunter, called Jim in the book, is based on Curwood himself.{{sfn|Eldridge|1993|p=7}} However, many of its plot elements\u2014mainly dealing with the friendship between the bear cub and the adult male grizzly\u2014were fabricated. Curwood's biographer, Judith A. Eldridge, believes that the incident in which the hunter is spared by a bear is based on truth, a fact that was later related to Jean-Jacques Annaud. He stated during an interview that he \"was given a letter from Curwood's granddaughter revealing that what happened in the story happened to him. He was hunting bear, as he had done often, and lost his rifle down a cliff. Suddenly, a huge bear confronted him and menaced him, but for reasons Curwood could never know, spared his life.\"{{sfn|Mahar|1989|p=E01}} Shortly after the book's publication, Curwood\u2014once an adamant hunter\u2014became a supporter of wildlife conservation.{{sfn|Eldridge|1993|pp=7-8}}\n\nBrach and Annaud decided to set the film in the late 19th century to create a perception of true wilderness, especially for the human characters.{{sfn|Thompson|1989|p=2}} In addition, while both the bears and the two hunters are named in the script, only Tom is named in the film. The bear cub is referred to in the script as Youk, and the adult male grizzly is known as Kaar. Tch\u00e9ky Karyo's character is said to have been called Tom and Jack Wallace's is Bill. These names differ from Curwood's novel; for example, the cub is known as Muskwa in the novel, and his adult companion is called Thor.\n\n=== Development ===\nAfter the commercial success of Jean-Jacques Annaud's previous films, including the Academy Award-winning ''[[Black and White in Color]]'' (1976) and ''[[Quest for Fire (film)|Quest for Fire]]'' (1981), producer [[Claude Berri]] offered to produce Annaud's next project, no matter the cost.{{sfn|Benabent-Loiseau|Annaud|1989|p=7}} The French filmmaker had first considered the idea of making a film that included mammal communication through behavior, rather than language, while working on ''Quest for Fire''. He became particularly interested in making an animal \"the star of a psychological drama\", so he \"decided to do an entertaining, commercial adventure and psychological film\" that would have an animal hero.{{sfn|Nichols|2003|p=23}} He discussed this idea with his longtime collaborator, screenwriter Gerard Brach, who within a few days sent Annaud a copy of ''The Grizzly King'', to which the filmmaker quickly agreed.{{sfn|Benabent-Loiseau|Annaud|1989|p=8}}\n\nAlthough Brach began writing the screenplay in late 1981, Annaud took on another project, that of directing a [[The Name of the Rose (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Umberto Eco]]'s book ''[[The Name of the Rose]]''. Between preparing for and filming his next film, Annaud traveled and visited zoos in order to research animal behavior. In an interview he later gave with the [[American Humane Association]], Annaud stated: \"Each time I was fascinated with the tigers, to a point that I thought to do a movie called ''The Tiger'' instead of ''The Bear''. In those days I felt that the bear, because they're so often vertical, would give me a better identification, or would provide more instant identification from the viewers.\"<ref>Milosevic, Yvonne. \"[http://www.yvonnemilosevic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/AHA_Jean_Jacques_Annaud.pdf Film & TV Unit Profiles: Jean-Jacques Annaud]\".

Several additional scenes were also filmed in a [[Limburg Zoo|Belgian Zoo]] in early 1988.{{sfn|L\u00fcdi|L\u00fcdi|Schreiber|2000|p=72}} The crew consisted of 200 individuals. Husband and wife team Tony and Heidi L\u00fcdi served as the film's production designer and art director, respectively, alongside set decorator [[Bernhard Henrich]]. In their book, ''Movie Worlds: Production Design in Film'', the L\u00fcdis state that as the film's production designers, they \"were constantly faced with the question 'What did you have to do?' To which we answered 'We turned the Alps into British Columbia.'\"{{sfn|L\u00fcdi|L\u00fcdi|Schreiber|2000|p=72}} Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot noted that \"the only thing Jean-Jacques was unable to control\" while filming in the Bavarian Alps \"was the weather: he did not manage to have the clouds take part in pre-production meetings.\"{{sfn|Baron|1989|p=E1}}\n\nWhile [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronic]] bears were used for several of the fighting scenes, live animals&mdash;including bears, dogs, horses, and honey bees&mdash;were used on location for filming.{{sfn|Nichols|2003|p=26}} A trained, {{convert|2.74|m|ft|adj=on}} tall [[Kodiak bear]] named [[Bart the Bear|Bart]] played the adult male grizzly, while a young female bear named Douce (\"Sweetness\" in English) took on the role of the cub, with several alternates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdWnbgDeUos|title=The Bear / L'ours (making of)|work=YouTube|date=2021-06-24|access-date=2022-08-15}}</ref> Three trainers worked with Bart (including his owner Doug Seus), eleven with the cubs, three with the dogs, and three with the horses.{{sfn|Nichols|2003|p=26}} One day during production, Bart injured Annaud while the two posed for photographers; Annaud's wounds, which included claw-marks on his backside, had to be drained with a [[Shunt (medical)|shunt]] for two months.{{sfn|Schickel|1989|p=97}} In addition to the real bears, there were animatronic bears which were used in specific scenes that were made by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]].\n\n== Themes ==\nWith its intersecting storylines of animals and humans, ''The Bear'' includes a variety of thematic elements. These themes include [[orphan]]hood, peril and protection, and mercy toward and on the behalf of a reformed hunter.\n\nFilm critic Derek Bous\u00e9 has made the connection between ''The Bear'' and Disney's model of wildlife films, comparing not only the sympathetic characters but also the filmatic structure, to the animated ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942) and the live-action ''[[Perri (film)|Perri]]'' (1957).{{sfn|Bous\u00e9|1990|p=31}} In his 2000 book ''Wildlife Films'', Bous\u00e9 makes a stronger correlation between Annaud's film and Disney's ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), in that both young animals lost their mothers at an early age, creating an unfortunate situation that allows the rest of the plot to develop (although, Dumbo's mother was merely imprisoned for a while, and was re-united with her son at the film's end).{{sfn|Bous\u00e9|2000|p=138}} ''Dumbo'' and ''The Bear'' also share a similarly purposed dream sequence, brought on by alcohol in the former and [[Amanita muscaria|hallucinogenic mushrooms]] in the latter.{{sfn|Bous\u00e9|1990|p=31}}\n\nThe theme of the reformed hunter is a direct reference to the original novel and its author. James Oliver Curwood, himself a past hunter and trapper, considered ''The Grizzly King'' to be a \"confession of one who for years hunted and killed before he learned that the wild offered a more thrilling sport than slaughter\".{{sfn|Curwood|1916|p=vii}} During its American release, the film used one of Curwood's famous quotes as a tagline&mdash;\"The greatest thrill is not to kill but to let live\"&mdash;and the film was endorsed by both the American Humane Association and the [[World Wildlife Fund]].{{sfn|Wilson|1992|p=154}}\n\n== Release ==\n''The Bear'' was released on 19 October 1988 in France, and 27 October 1989 in the United States. An official tie-in to the movie ''The Odyssey of 'The Bear': The Making of the Film by Jean-Jacques Annaud,'' a translation from the French edition, followed in November. In addition, Curwood's original novel&mdash;out of print in the US for fifty years&mdash;was republished by [[Newmarket Press]], and a children's book titled ''The Bear Storybook'' was published by [[St. Martin's Press]].<ref>McDowell, Edwin.

It is about life in the wild, and it does an impressive job of seeming to show wild bears in their natural habitat\" and that scenes from the film, especially those \"of horseplay and genuine struggles &ndash; gradually build up our sense of the personalities of these animals\".<ref>Ebert, Roger.

In his review for the ''St. Petersburg Times'', Hal Lipper called the dream sequences \"existential flights of fancy are accompanied by psychedelic images that seem better suited for '60s 'happenings.'\"{{sfn|Lipper|1989|p=13}} In addition, one scene in which the male grizzly mates with a female bear while the cub looks on was criticized as being unfriendly for children viewers.<ref name=\"Maslin\"/> David Denby of ''New York Magazine'' stated as much in his review of the film, noting \"I would like to be able to recommend ''The Bear'' as a movie that parents and children could see together, but I'm afraid there's a scene in the middle that would have to be...
