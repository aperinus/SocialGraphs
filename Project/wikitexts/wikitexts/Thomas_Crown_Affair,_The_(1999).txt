It stars [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Denis Leary]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[United Artists]] and [[Irish DreamTime]] and was released on August 6, 1999. It grossed $14.6 million during its opening weekend and $124.3 million worldwide, against a budget of $48 million.<ref name=\"bom\" /> It received generally positive reviews from critics.<ref name=\"tomatoes\" /><ref name=\"metacritic\" />\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Claude Monet, Saint-Georges majeur au cr\u00e9puscule.jpg|thumbnail|''[[San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk]]'' (1908), the [[Claude Monet]] painting stolen in the film]]Thieves infiltrate the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] inside an actual [[Trojan horse]], preparing to steal an entire gallery of paintings, but are apprehended. In the confusion, billionaire Thomas Crown \u2013 the crime's secret mastermind \u2013 steals [[Claude Monet|Monet's]] painting of ''[[San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk]]''. NYPD Detective Michael McCann heads the investigation into the theft of the $100 million artwork, with the unwelcome assistance of insurance investigator Catherine Banning.\n\nCrown lends a [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]] to fill the Monet's space in the museum and falls under Banning's suspicion. She persuades McCann to begin surveillance of Crown, deducing that the wealthy playboy is motivated not by money but the sheer thrill of the crime. Banning accepts Crown's invitation to dinner. Before the date, Crown's therapist correctly speculates that he has found \"a worthy adversary\" in Banning.\n\nAt dinner, Banning has a copy of Crown's keys made; she and her team search his home and discover the Monet, which is revealed to be a taunting [[forgery|imitation]], painted over a copy of ''Poker Sympathy'' from the ''[[Dogs Playing Poker]]'' series. Banning confronts Crown and the two give in to their mutual attraction, spending a passionate night together.\n \nBanning and Crown continue their [[cat-and-mouse game]] and their trysts, despite McCann's surveillance. Accompanying Crown on a trip to [[Martinique]], Banning realizes he is preparing to run, and rejects his offer to join him when the time comes. McCann presents Banning with photographs of Crown with another woman, Anna, complicating her feelings toward the case and her prime suspect. Banning and McCann discover that the fake Monet is in fact an expert forgery that could only have been painted by someone with access to the original; they visit the likeliest forger, Heinrich Knutzhorn, in prison, to no avail, although his attitude suggests to them that he recognizes the work.\n\nLater, Banning finds Crown packing his belongings with Anna. He promises Banning his interest lies with her alone, stating that Anna works for him but he would be compromising her to define the nature of their association. Crown offers to return the Monet by putting it back on the wall of the museum, and gives Banning a time and place to meet him when he's finished. Tearfully, Banning leaves and informs McCann.\n\nThe following day, the police stake out the museum, waiting to arrest Crown. Banning learns that the fake Monet was painted by Anna; the imprisoned forger is her father, a partner of Crown, who became her guardian. Crown arrives and advertises his position in the lobby.  The police realize that he expected Banning to turn him in, and that Crown has set up another plot.  Before he can be apprehended, Crown quickly blends into the crowd, aided by lookalikes in bowler hats a la [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte|Magritte's]] ''[[The Son of Man]]''. Evading police, Crown sets off the museum's fire sprinklers. His donated Pissarro, hanging in the Monet's place, is washed clean by the sprinklers to reveal the real Monet.\n\nCrown's plan is made clear; upon stealing the Monet, Crown had Anna forge the Pissarro over it, and \"returned\" it to the museum. However, Crown has now vanished with another painting. Banning however, considers the case closed as this painting is not covered by her employer. McCann has since stopped caring whether or not they catch Crown, and bids Banning farewell, and she races to meet Crown, but finds only the missing painting. Devastated, she has the painting sent to McCann, and boards a plane back to London. Taking her seat, she finds Crown sitting behind her and the two are passionately reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Thomas Crown, a billionaire and Catherine's lover.\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Catherine Banning, an insurance investigator and Thomas' lover.\n* [[Denis Leary]] as Detective Michael McCann, a police detective.\n* [[Fritz Weaver]] as John Reynolds\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as Detective Paretti, a police detective.\n* [[Ben Gazzara]] as Andrew Wallace\n* [[Mark Margolis]] as Heinrich Knutzhorn\n* [[Esther Ca\u00f1adas]] as Anna Tyrol Knutzhorn\n* [[James Saito]] as Paul Cheng\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Michael Lombard]] as Bobby McKinley\n* [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] as Accountant on phone (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvparty.com/70hitchhikers2.html |title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Simon Jones |publisher=Tvparty.com |access-date=2015-11-02}}</ref>\n* [[Cynthia Darlow]] as Daria\n\nDunaway played the Catherine Banning role in [[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|the 1968 original]].<ref name=\"latimes\" /> However, the character's name was Vicki Anderson.\n\n==Production==\nAt first, director [[John McTiernan]] was unavailable for the project. Pierce Brosnan and his fellow producers considered several directors (including [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], [[Andrew Davis (director)|Andrew Davis]], [[Roger Donaldson]]) before returning to their original choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pbfiles.t35.com/tca/articles1.html#productionnotes|title=Brosnan uses his Bond clout to remake Thomas Crown Affair|access-date=2007-02-24|publisher=EON Magazine|last=Bond|first=Jeff|date=August 1999|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313110641/http://pbfiles.t35.com/tca/articles1.html#productionnotes|archive-date=2007-03-13}}</ref> McTiernan then received the script and added his own ideas to the production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pbfiles.t35.com/tca/articles1.html#productionnotes|title=Interview with John McTiernan, Director, 'The Thomas Crown Affair'|access-date=2007-02-24|publisher=Adobe Premiere World|last=Cercel|first=Elif|date=1999-08-09|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313110641/http://pbfiles.t35.com/tca/articles1.html#productionnotes|archive-date=2007-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Script amendments===\nAfter McTiernan signed on to the project, he changed the theme of the central heist and a number of key scenes. McTiernan felt that contemporary audiences would be less forgiving of Thomas Crown if he staged two armed bank robberies for fun as McQueen did in the original, rather than if he staged an unarmed art heist. He wrote the heist based on the [[Trojan horse]] theme and on a technical failure of thermal cameras. McTiernan also deemed a polo match that was used in the original and had been rewritten into the new script to be [[clich\u00e9d]], and he wanted a scene that conveyed more action and excitement, not just wealth. He substituted a [[catamaran]] race, in which Brosnan performed his own stunts.\n\n===References to 1968 film===\nThere are a number of echo references to the original 1968 version of the film. The most obvious is the casting of [[Faye Dunaway]] as Crown's psychiatrist; Dunaway portrayed insurance investigator Vicki Anderson in the original. In the remake, \"[[The Windmills of Your Mind]]\" plays during the ballroom scene, as background music in a couple of other scenes, and during the credits at the end; the song [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|earned an Oscar]] for the original film. Both films share a nearly identical scene with Crown playing high-stakes golf, and in both films Crown pilots a glider for recreation.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in several parts of New York City, including [[Central Park]]. The corporate headquarters of [[Lucent|Lucent Technologies]] stood in for Crown's suite of offices. Due to the impossibility of filming scenes at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (the producers' request was \"respectfully declined\"),<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite web|url=http://pbfiles.t35.com/tca/articles1.html#productionnotes|title=Art of the Con|publisher=Pbfiles.t35.com|access-date=2007-02-24|last=Pacheo|first=Patrick|date=1999-08-01|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313110641/http://pbfiles.t35.com/tca/articles1.html#productionnotes|archive-date=2007-03-13}}</ref> the production crew made their own museum on a soundstage.

The two glider aero-tow shots were taken from film shot at different airports with different tow planes. The initial takeoff was photographed at the Harris Hill Soaring Center located at the [[National Soaring Museum]] in Elmira, NY. The glider pilot was [[Thomas L. Knauff]], a world record holder,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://records.fai.org/pilot.asp?from=gliding&id=75|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020821040109/http://records.fai.org/pilot.asp?from=gliding&id=75|url-status=dead|archive-date=2002-08-21|title=Thomas Knauff|publisher=Records.fai.org|access-date=2007-02-24}}</ref> and a member of the US [[Soaring Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soaringmuseum.org/halloffame/halloffamebios.html#K|title=Hall of Fame biographies|publisher=Soaringmuseum.org|access-date=2007-02-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008075343/http://www.soaringmuseum.org/halloffame/halloffamebios.html#K|archive-date=2006-10-08}}</ref>\n\nA number of McTiernan's vehicles then appear in the next sequence, as well as his farm. The tractor in the background after the glider lands belongs to McTiernan, while the dark green Shelby Mustang that Crown drives on [[Martinique]] was originally intended to be used for [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s character in 1993's ''[[Last Action Hero]],'' and was retrieved from the director's garage for this film. The six-wheeled Jeep was built specifically for the film. The house used as Crown's Caribbean getaway is owned by one of the 30 original families who settled in [[Martinique]] in the 17th century. The scenes around it, like the beach, are a montage of various other parts of Martinique, including St Pierre and the Lamentin airport.\n\n===Paintings===\nThe paintings, copies of which were supplied by \"Troubetzkoy Paintings\" in New York, appearing in the film are:\n\n* ''[[San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk (Monet)|San Giorgio Maggiore at Twilight]]'' by [[Claude Monet]], owned by the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Art Gallery]] in [[Cardiff, Wales]].\n* ''[[Haystacks (Monet)#1890-1891 series|Wheatstacks]]'' by Claude Monet, owned by the [[Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n* ''Noon: Rest From Work (After Millet)'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]] \u2013 The painting Crown admires and calls \"his haystacks,\" the original is owned by [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]], France.\n* ''The Artist's Garden at Eragny'' by [[Camille Pissarro]].\n* ''[[The Son of Man]]'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]] \u2013 The painting that is seen several times in the film depicting a man in a suit with a [[Bowler hat]] and an apple covering his face.\n* ''Banks of the Seine at Argenteuil'' by [[\u00c9douard Manet]] \u2013 The second painting to go missing, given to, and later returned by, Catherine.

It features a variety of jazz arrangements which harken back to the original film's version. In addition, the film ends with a reprise of the [[Academy Award]]-winning song \"[[The Windmills of Your Mind|Windmills of Your Mind]]\" sung by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. Throughout the film, [[Nina Simone]]'s recording of \"[[Sinnerman]]\" (from the album ''[[Pastel Blues]]'', 1965) is used in segments. Mostly the non-vocal parts are used (hand-clapping and piano riffs), but in the final scenes, where Crown returns to the scene of the crime, Simone sings \"''Oh sinnerman, where are you gonna run to?''\"\n\n===Track listing===\n# \"Windmills of Your Mind\"&nbsp;\u2013 [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]\n# \"[[Sinnerman]]\" \u2013 [[Nina Simone]]\n# \"Everything (...Is Never Quite Enough)\" \u2013 [[Wasis Diop]]\n# \"Caban La Ka Kratchie\" \u2013 Georges Fordant\n# \"Black & White X 5\" \u2013 Bill Conti\n# \"Never Change\" \u2013 Bill Conti\n# \"Meet Ms. Banning\" \u2013 Bill Conti\n# \"Goodnight/Breaking & Entering\" \u2013 Bill Conti\n# \"Glider Pt. 1\" \u2013 Bill Conti\n# \"Glider Pt. 2\" \u2013 Bill Conti\n# \"Cocktails\" \u2013 Bill Conti\n# \"Quick Exit\" \u2013 Bill Conti\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''The Thomas Crown Affair'' premiered on July 27, 1999, and was theatrically released in the United States on  August 6, 1999, by [[United Artists]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].\n\n===Home media===\n''The Thomas Crown Affair'' was released on DVD in the [[LaserDisc]] format on January 4, 2000, in the United States by [[MGM Home Entertainment]].
