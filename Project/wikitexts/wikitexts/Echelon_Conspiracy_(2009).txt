First they encourage him to miss his flight which crashes soon after takeoff. Then the messages direct him to buy a certain stock, which increases by 313%. Next, the messages direct him to a hotel/casino in [[Prague]] to gamble. He first wins one-hundred thousand euro on a [[slot machine]] and bets the entire amount on a hand of [[blackjack]], which he wins. Max then has an altercation with a beautiful woman ([[Tamara Feldman]]) and her jealous boyfriend in the hotel corridor, where he is knocked-out, and his mysterious phone is apparently scanned. Max wakes up with the smiling woman, Kamila, and asks her out for a drink.\n\nTo further his new-found career in gambling, Max enlists the aid of a Russian cabbie/apparent e-gadget enthusiast, Yuri (Sergey Gubanov), who outfits him with a text-to-voice earpiece to wirelessly receive his anonymous and lucrative text messages. He then hits the 3 million euro jackpot on a slot machine but runs away when [[casino security]] led by John Reed ([[Edward Burns]]) attempts to detain him. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Dave Grant ([[Ving Rhames]]) interrupts the chase and handcuffs Max to interrogate him about the phone. Frightened, Max is unable to provide any information.\n\nAt this point, Agent Grant contacts Raymond Burke ([[Martin Sheen]]) of the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], apparently monitoring Max because of messages from an omniscient communication [[Mass surveillance|surveillance]] computer system known as [[Echelon (signals intelligence)|Echelon]]. These messages have been responsible for the deaths of several Americans, most recently a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] IT specialist. Burke recently lost a battle to pass a bill in [[United States Congress|Congress]] to allow Echelon to be upgraded by being uploaded into personal computers worldwide. Burke eventually decides that Max knows too much and must be eliminated; however, Reed and the beautiful woman from the hotel \u2013 now revealed as Reed's associate \u2013 come to Max's aid and spirit him away to [[Moscow]]. There, Max reconnects with the techie Yuri to get his help in discovering who is sending the messages. Yuri believes that the messages are coming directly from the computer itself, and that the system has somehow become self-aware and autonomous. Max and Reed don't agree but flee when more armed men arrive at Yuri's apartment. A car chase through Moscow ensues.\n\nThe chase ends with Reed outmaneuvering and blowing-up the pursuing cars led by Agent Grant, escaping injury; nevertheless, Max inflicts some payback for their previous encounter. Grant, who now receives threatening texts, asks Max to help to stop Echelon. Max receives another text, instructing him to return to [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where he first worked as a computer security engineer. Max, Grant, and Reed all fly home on a military aircraft.\n\nAfter arrival, the group finds a sealed-up bunker-like structure with a cache of servers and a high-end computer system that Max helped install years earlier and is revealed to belong to another victim of Echelon's messages - the same person whose credit card was used to send Max the phone. Max starts up the bunker's computer and is instructed via text to fire up the servers to connect them to the network for Echelon to download itself into the bunker's computers and to begin a countdown to replicate itself across the world wide network. Agent Grant calls Burke at the NSA to inform him; nonetheless, Burke wants the Echelon in the global network in the interests of US national security. Meanwhile, Max fails to stop Echelon's replication countdown, until he takes the idea of using the computer self-learning ability (also in 1968 Star Trek episode ''[[The Ultimate Computer]]'' and in 1983 [[WarGames]]). Max asks the computer about its primary purpose, and it replies that it aims to defend the US as defined by the Constitution. Max asks the computer to search for threats to the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]]. A lot of articles appear concerned about the recent attempts to secure Congressional approval to upgrade Echelon, underlined as a grave threat to personal freedoms. When the download is complete, Echelon shuts itself down, \"learning\" that it itself is the threat to both the US and the world due to the potential of misusage by those that control it.\n\nIn the end, Agent Grant and Reed send Max and Kamila to [[Paris]] while Burke is subpoenaed to appear before the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] for his decision that endangering the US itself. In the final scene, back in [[Moscow]], the techie Yuri is unveiled as a Captain in the Russian [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Security Service]]. He is commended for his actions and says they will soon start it again, but they have helped the Americans to make the right decision for the time being; \"I want to believe so.\" he cryptically adds, turning off his mobile phone.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shane West]] as Max Petterson\n* [[Edward Burns]] as John Reed\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as FBI Agent Dave Grant\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Raymond Burke\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Mueller\n* [[Tamara Feldman]] as Kamila\n* Sergey Gubanov as Yuri Malinin\n* [[Gosha Kutsenko]] as Russian General\n* [[Steven Elder]] as Charles\n* Sranje Trenovic as Blackjack Dealer\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Echelon Conspiracy'' holds an approval rating of 8% based on 13 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/echelon_conspiracy|title=Echelon Conspiracy|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=July 15, 2021}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], it has a weighted average score of 26 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/echelon-conspiracy|title=Echelon Conspiracy|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=July 15, 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Joe Leydon]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film \"plays an awful lot like a direct-to-vid knockoff of last year's ''[[Eagle Eye]]''\" and \"ups the ante with additional pilfering from ''[[WarGames]]''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2009/film/reviews/echelon-conspiracy-1200474311/|title=Echelon Conspiracy|last=Leydon|first=Joe|date=March 2, 2009|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 15, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring surveillance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.echelonconspiracy.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|774694|Echelon Conspiracy}}\n* {{AllMovie movie|477483}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{mojo title|echelonconspiracy|Echelon Conspiracy}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090201065144/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/awards_festivals/cannes/reviews/article_display.jsp?JSESSIONID=JSgGLdpJs2sMsh9QkS02fw1XxbbHvdzsRP2SMGtz6Rg3Q8Cklrnt!-228458968&&rid=11095 \"Film Review: The Gift\"] by Duane Byrge at ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (May 16, 2008)\n\n{{Greg Marcks}}\n\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2009 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2009 independent films]]\n[[Category:2000s chase films]]\n[[Category:2000s mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about artificial intelligence]]\n[[Category:Films about assassinations]]\n[[Category:Films about computing]]\n[[Category:Films about security and surveillance]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Greg Marcks]]\n[[Category:Films set in Bangkok]]\n[[Category:Films set in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films set in Prague]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Bangkok]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Prague]]\n[[Category:Techno-thriller films]]\n[[Category:Dark Castle Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
