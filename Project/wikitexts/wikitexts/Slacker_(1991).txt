For example, in a self-interview in the ''Austin Chronicle'', Linklater stated: \u201cSlackers might look like the left-behinds of society, but they are actually one step ahead, rejecting most of society and the social hierarchy before it rejects them. The dictionary defines slackers as people who evade duties and responsibilities. A more modern notion would be people who are ultimately being responsible to themselves and not wasting their time in a realm of activity that has nothing to do with who they are or what they might be ultimately striving for.\u201d<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Andrew|last=Kopkind|title=Slacking Toward Bethlehem|journal=[[Grand Street (magazine)|Grand Street]]|issue=44|date=1992|pages=176\u2013178}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, ''Slacker'' was widely considered an accurate depiction of [[Generation X]] because the film's young adult characters are more interested in quasi-intellectual pastimes and socializing than career advancement. Linklater\u2014who is a member of the [[Baby boomer|\"Baby Boom\"]] generation\u2014has long since eschewed the role of generational spokesperson. Moreover, ''Slacker'' includes members of various generations, and many of its themes are universal rather than generation-specific.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Lesley|last=Speed|title=The Possibilities of Roads Not Taken|journal=[[Journal of Popular Film & Television]]|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|location=London, England|volume=35|issue=3|date=Fall 2007|page=103|doi=10.3200/JPFT.35.3.98-106|s2cid=191613990}}</ref>\n\n==''Slacker 2011''==\nIn 2011, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of ''Slacker'''s release, Daniel Metz and Lars Nilsen of the [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema]] chain developed a remake of the film, titled ''Slacker 2011'', which is an [[anthology film]] in which each segment of the original film is remade as a segment written and directed by a different filmmaker or filmmaking team.<ref name=\"20 years on\">{{cite web |title=20 Years On, It's D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu for 'Slacker' and Austin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/us/03ttkelly.html |first=Christopher |last=Kelly |work=The New York Times |date=July 3, 2011}}</ref> Altogether 26 directors were involved in the film, including [[Bradley Beesley]], [[Bob Byington]], [[Michael Dolan]], [[Jay Duplass]], [[Geoff Marslett]], [[PJ Raval]], [[Bob Ray]], [[Duane Graves]], [[Ben Steinbauer]] and [[David Zellner]].<ref>{{cite web |title=23 Austin Filmmakers to Remake Richard Linklater's SLACKER in Honor of Film's 20th Anniversary |url=https://collider.com/slacker-2011-remake/ |first=Matt |last=Goldberg |work=Collider |date=May 3, 2011}}</ref> Some segments are word-for-word remakes, while others are only loosely based on their source material.<ref name=\"20 years on\" /> The film was produced by Alamo Drafthouse and the [[Austin Film Society]].<ref name=\"20 years on\" /> Linklater was not involved in the project, although he approved of the idea, saying, \"It would be against the slacker ethic to not give one\u2019s blessing to someone else's weird inspiration.\"<ref name=\"20 years on\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[1991 in film]]\n* [[Low-budget film]]\n* [[Hyperlink cinema]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0102943}}\n*{{AllMovie title|id=45083|title=Slacker}}\n* {{tcmdb title|90433}}\n* {{mojo title|slacker}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|slacker}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/338-slacker-slacking-off ''Slacker: Slacking Off''], an essay by [[John Pierson (filmmaker)|John Pierson]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n* [http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2011-01-21/slack-to-the-future/ Slack to the Future], a 20th anniversary conversation between the ''Austin Chronicle''<nowiki/>'s Marc Savlov, Richard Linklater and John Pierson\n\n{{Richard Linklater}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slacker}}\n[[Category:1990 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Linklater]]\n[[Category:Films about anarchism]]\n[[Category:Films about social issues]]\n[[Category:Films set in Austin, Texas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Austin, Texas]]\n[[Category:Camcorder films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:1990 independent films]]\n[[Category:American nonlinear narrative films]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in 16 mm film]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
