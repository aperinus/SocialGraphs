Costello's methodical [[modus operandi]] involves creating airtight [[alibi]]s, including ones provided by his lover, Jane. After carrying out a contract killing on a nightclub owner, Jef is seen leaving the scene by the club's piano player Val\u00e9rie and several witnesses, but their testimonies are contradictory. After rounding up numerous suspects, including Jef, the police superintendent firmly believes Costello is the culprit.\n\nCostello loses a police tail and goes to collect his fee from an intermediary sent by his employers. When the man shoots and wounds Costello, Jef realizes that the police investigation has compromised him with his employers. After treating his wound, Costello returns to the nightclub and meets Val\u00e9rie, who takes him to her home. Though he is grateful, he wonders why she lied to the police when she clearly saw him after the murder. Meanwhile, police officers [[electronic surveillance|bug]] his room, agitating the bird in its cage. Upon returning, Costello notices some loose feathers scattered around the cage and the bird acting strangely. Suspecting an intrusion, he searches his room, finds the bug and deactivates it.\n\nThe police search Jane's apartment and offer her a deal: withdraw her dubious alibi for Costello and they will leave her alone. She rejects the offer. Back in his apartment, Costello is ambushed by the intermediary, who pays him off and offers him another contract. Costello overpowers him and forces him to disclose the identity of his boss, Olivier Rey.\n\nSeveral undercover officers attempt to tail Costello in the [[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tro]] but he loses them. He visits Jane and assures her that everything will work out, then drives to Rey's home, which turns out to be where Val\u00e9rie also lives. Costello kills Rey and returns to the nightclub, this time making no attempt to conceal his presence. He checks his hat but leaves his hat-check ticket on the counter and puts on white gloves, which he wears during his kills, in full view of everyone. He approaches the stage where Val\u00e9rie plays piano. She quietly advises him to leave but he pulls out his gun and aims it at her. As she asks Costello why he is doing this, he responds that he is being paid for the job. Three policemen reveal themselves and shoot Costello dead. When the superintendent inspects Costello's gun, he finds it empty.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alain Delon]] as Jef Costello\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]] as the Superintendent\n* [[Nathalie Delon]] as Jane Lagrange\n* [[Caty Rosier]] as Val\u00e9rie, the pianist a/k/a Cathy \n* Jacques Leroy as the man in the passageway\n* [[Michel Boisrond]] as Wiener\n* [[Robert Favart]] as the bartender\n* Jean-Pierre Posier as Olivier Rey\n* [[Catherine Jourdan]] as the hatcheck girl\n* Roger Fradet, Carlo Nell and Robert Rondo as police inspectors\n\n== Production ==\nMeville wrote the film for Delon.<ref>A Samurai in Paris Nogueira, Rui; TRUCHAUD, FRANCOIS. Sight and Sound; London Vol. 37, Iss. 3,  (Summer 1968): 118.</ref> This was the first film for Delon's wife, Nathalie. He filed for divorce after the film wrapped, but they terminated their divorce proceedings a few days later. The couple divorced in June 1968 and their divorce became official in February 1969. Nathalie was granted custody of their son, Anthony.<ref>''Orlando Evening Star''. Feb. 14, 1969</ref> [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]], who played the police inspector, was a comedian cast against type. Melville's private film studio, Studio Jenner, was destroyed by fire while ''Le Samoura\u00ef'' was shooting early in July 1967. Melville, who termed the blaze \"suspicious\", moved the production to another studio.<ref>I\"Fire Razes Melville's Studio Jenner in Paris.\"\n''Variety''.

The scene was changed after Melville angrily discovered that Delon had a smiling death scene in another of his films. Production stills of the smiling death exist.\n\n== Release and reception ==\n''Le Samourai'' was released on 25 October 1967. It received positive reviews with praise for Melville's screenwriting and direction, Delon's performance and atmosphere. It holds a 100% rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 31 reviews from critics, and a rating average of 8.4/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"''Le Samoura\u00ef'' makes the most of its spare aesthetic, using stylish \u2013 and influential \u2013 direction, solid performances, and thick atmosphere to weave an absorbing story.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/le_samourai/ |title= Le Samoura\u00ef |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=30 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nWriting of the Delons' performances in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', Bertrand Guyard notes husband and wife are both nearly silent but \"their gazes, fraught with meaning, are enough to thrill the camera\" with the director drawing from their portrayals \"a mythical couple in the seventh art.\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-01-21 |title=Nathalie Delon, \u00e9ternelle complice du Samoura\u00ef |url=https://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/nathalie-delon-eternelle-complice-du-samourai-20210121 |access-date=2022-03-21 |website=LEFIGARO |language=fr}}</ref>\n\nThe film was ranked No. 39 in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/100-greatest-world-cinema-films/default.asp?film=39 |title=The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema \u2013 39.

The inspiration, or homage, is confirmed by the similarity in the character names.
