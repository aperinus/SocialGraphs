The film tells the story of Gelsomina, a simple-minded young woman ([[Giulietta Masina]]) bought from her mother by Zampan\u00f2 ([[Anthony Quinn]]), a brutish strongman who takes her with him on the road.\n\nFellini described ''La Strada'' as \"a complete catalogue of my entire mythological world, a dangerous representation of my identity that was undertaken with no precedent whatsoever.\"<ref>Kezich (2009), 56.</ref> As a result, the film demanded more time and effort than any of his other works, before or later.<ref>Baxter, 105.</ref> The development process was long and tortuous; there were problems during production, including insecure financial backing, problematic casting, and numerous delays. Finally, just before the production completed shooting, Fellini suffered a nervous breakdown that required medical treatment so he could complete principal photography. Initial critical reaction was harsh, and the film's screening at the [[Venice Film Festival]] was the occasion of a bitter controversy that escalated into a public brawl between Fellini's supporters and detractors.\n\nSubsequently, however, ''La Strada'' has become \"one of the most influential films ever made,\" according to the American Film Institute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/silver/films/preview/archive/AFIPreview_21.pdf |title=AFIPreview21.indd |access-date=28 September 2018}}</ref> It won the inaugural [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1957.<ref>Kezich (2006), 406.</ref><ref name=\"Oscars1957\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1957 |title=The 29th Academy Awards (1957) Nominees and Winners |access-date=24 October 2011|work=oscars.org}}</ref> It was placed fourth in the 1992 [[British Film Institute]] directors' list of cinema's top 10 films.<ref>[http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1992.html The ''Sight & Sound'' Top Ten Poll: 1992] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008052127/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1992.html |date=8 October 2014 }} Retrieved 15 June 2012</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nGelsomina, an apparently somewhat simple-minded, dreamy young woman, learns that her sister Rosa has died after going on the road with the [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] Zampan\u00f2. Now the man has returned a year later to ask her mother if Gelsomina will take Rosa's place. The impoverished mother, with other mouths to feed, accepts 10,000 [[Italian lira|lire]], and her daughter tearfully departs the same day.\n\nZampan\u00f2 makes his living as an itinerant street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly across his chest, then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina's na\u00efve and antic nature emerges, with Zampan\u00f2's brutish methods presenting a callous [[Foil (literature)|foil]]. He teaches her to play the [[snare drum]] and [[trumpet]], dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he intimidates her, forces himself upon her, and treats her cruelly at times; but she develops a tenderness for him that is betrayed when he goes off with another woman one evening, leaving Gelsomina abandoned in the street. Yet here, as throughout the film, even in her wretchedness, she manages to find beauty and wonder, aided by some local children.\n\nFinally, she rebels and leaves, making her way into town. There she watches the act of another street entertainer, Il Matto (\"The Fool\"), a talented [[Tightrope walking|high wire]] artist and clown. When Zampan\u00f2 finds her there, he forcibly takes her back. They join a ragtag travelling circus where Il Matto already works. Il Matto teases the strongman at every opportunity, though he cannot explain what motivates him to do so. After Il Matto drenches Zampan\u00f2 with a pail of water, Zampan\u00f2 chases after his tormentor with his knife drawn. As a result, he is briefly jailed, and both men are fired from the travelling circus.\n\nBefore Zampan\u00f2's release from prison, Il Matto proposes that there are alternatives to Gelsomina's servitude, and imparts his philosophy that everything and everyone has a purpose \u2013 even a pebble, even she. A nun suggests that Gelsomina's purpose in life is comparable to her own. But when Gelsomina offers Zampan\u00f2 marriage, he brushes her off.\n\nOn an empty stretch of road, Zampan\u00f2 comes upon Il Matto fixing a flat tire. As Gelsomina watches in horror, the two men begin to fight; it ends after the strongman punches the clown on the head several times, causing the fool to hit his head on the corner of his car's roof.  As Zampan\u00f2 walks back to his motorcycle with a warning for the man to watch his mouth in the future, Il Matto complains that his watch is broken, then stumbles into a field, collapses, and dies. Zampan\u00f2 hides the body and pushes the car off the road, where it bursts into flames.\n\nThe killing breaks Gelsomina's spirit and she becomes apathetic, constantly repeating, \"The Fool is hurt.\" Zampan\u00f2 makes a few small attempts to console her, but in vain. Fearful he will no longer be able to earn a living with Gelsomina, Zampan\u00f2 abandons her while she sleeps, leaving some clothes, money, and his trumpet.\n\nSome years later, he overhears a woman singing the very tune Gelsomina often played. He learns that the woman's father had found Gelsomina on the beach and kindly taken her in. However, she had wasted away and died. Zampan\u00f2 gets drunk, gets in a fight with the locals, and wanders to the beach, where he breaks down in tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Giulietta Masina]] as Gelsomina\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as Zampan\u00f2\n* [[Richard Basehart]] as Il Matto, the fool\n* [[Aldo Silvani]] as Il Signor Giraffa, the circus owner\n* Marcella Rovere as La Vedova, the widow\n* Livia Venturini as La Suorina, the nun\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Masina.jpg|thumbnail|right|Giulietta Masina as Gelsomina.<br />\"Masina's character is perfectly suited to her round clown's face and wide, innocent eyes; in one way or another, in ''[[Juliet of the Spirits]],'' ''[[Ginger and Fred]]'' and most of her other films, she was always playing Gelsomina.\" -- [[Roger Ebert]], ''Chicago Sun-Times''<ref name=\"roger ebert\">{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=La Strada|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/la-strada-1994|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|access-date=6 October 2013}}</ref>  ]]\nFellini's creative process for ''La Strada'' began with vague feelings, \"a kind of tone,\" he said, \"that lurked, which made me melancholy and gave me a diffused sense of guilt, like a shadow hanging over me.

A pig castrator lived there who was known as a womanizer: according to Fellini, \"This man took all the girls in town to bed with him; once he left a poor idiot girl pregnant and everyone said the baby was the devil's child.\"<ref>Fellini, ''Fellini on Fellini'', 11.</ref> In 1992, Fellini told Canadian director [[Damian Pettigrew]] that he had conceived the film at the same time as co-scenarist [[Tullio Pinelli]] in a kind of \"orgiastic [[synchronicity]]\":\n{{blockquote|I was directing ''[[I vitelloni]]'', and Tullio had gone to see his family in Turin.

When he returned to Rome, he told me what he'd seen and his desire to narrate their hard lives on the road. 'It would make the ideal scenario for your next film,' he said. It was the same story I'd imagined but with a crucial difference: mine focused on a little traveling circus with a slow-witted young woman named Gelsomina. So we merged my flea-bitten circus characters with his smoky campfire mountain vagabonds. We named Zampan\u00f2 after the owners of two small circuses in Rome: Zamperla and Saltano.<ref>Fellini and Pettigrew, 89-90.</ref>}}\nFellini wrote the script with collaborators [[Ennio Flaiano]] and Tullio Pinelli and brought it first to [[Luigi Rovere]], Fellini's producer for ''[[The White Sheik]]'' (1952). When Rovere read the script for ''La Strada'', he began to weep, raising Fellini's hopes, only to have them dashed when the producer announced that the screenplay was like great literature, but that \"as a film this wouldn't make a lira.

When asked why by the surprised Basehart, who had never before played the part of a clown, Fellini responded: \"Because, if you did what you did in ''[[Fourteen Hours]]'' you can do anything.\" A great success in Italy, the 1951 Hollywood drama starred Basehart as a would-be suicide on a hotel balcony.<ref>Baxter, 109.</ref> Basehart, too, had been greatly impressed by ''I Vitelloni'', and agreed to take the role for much less than his usual salary, in part because he was very attracted by Fellini's personality, saying: \"It was his zest for living, and his humor.\"<ref>Alpert, 91.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in [[Bagnoregio]], [[Province of Viterbo|Viterbo]], [[Lazio]], and [[Ovindoli]], [[Province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila]], [[Abruzzo]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wiegand|first=Chris|title=Federico Fellini: The Complete Films|year=2003|publisher=Taschen|location=Koln|isbn=978-3-8365-3470-3|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5ypTi3n0X0C}}</ref><ref>IMDb, ''La Strada'' filming locations.</ref> On Sundays, Fellini and Basehart drove around the countryside, scouting locations and looking for places to eat, sometimes trying as many as six restaurants and venturing as far away as [[Rimini]] before Fellini found the desired ambiance and menu.<ref>Alpert, 94.</ref>\n\nProduction started in October 1953, but had to be halted within weeks when Masina dislocated her ankle during the convent scene with Quinn.<ref>Alpert, 91-92.</ref> With shooting suspended, De Laurentiis saw an opportunity to replace Masina, whom he had never wanted for the part and who had not yet been signed to a contract.<ref name=\"Kezich 2006, 149\">Kezich (2006), 149.</ref> This changed as soon as executives at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] viewed the [[Dailies|rushes]] of the scene and lauded Masina's performance, resulting in De Laurentiis announcing that he had her on an exclusive and ordering her to sign a hastily prepared contract, at approximately a third of Quinn's salary.<ref name=\"Kezich 2006, 149\"/>\n\nThe delay caused the entire production schedule to be revised, and cinematographer Carlo Carlini, who had a prior commitment, had to be replaced by [[Otello Martelli]], a long-time favorite of Fellini's.<ref name=\"Alpert, 93\"/> When filming resumed in February 1954, it was winter.

The plan often required the actor to get up at 3:30&nbsp;am to capture the \"bleak early light\" that Fellini insisted on, and then leave at 10:30 to drive to Rome in his Zampan\u00f2 outfit so he could be on the set in time to transform into [[Attila the Hun]] for afternoon shooting.<ref name=\"Alpert, 92\">Alpert, 92.</ref> Quinn recalled: \"This schedule accounted for the haggard look I had in both films, a look that was perfect for Zampan\u00f2 but scarcely OK for Attila the Hun.\"<ref name=\"Baxter, 111\">Baxter, 111.</ref>\n\nDespite an extremely tight budget, production supervisor Luigi Giacosi was able to rent a small circus run by a man named Savitri, a strongman and fire-eater who coached Quinn on circus jargon and the technical aspects of chain-breaking.<ref name=\"Kezich 2009, 60\"/> Giacosi also secured the services of the Zamperla Circus, which supplied a number of stuntmen who could play themselves,<ref name=\"Kezich 2009, 60\"/> including Basehart's [[Stunt double|double]], a high-wire artist who refused to perform when firemen arrived with a safety net.<ref name=\"Kezich 2006, 150\">Kezich (2006), 150.</ref>\n\n[[File:La-strada-trailer-screenshot.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from 1956 trailer. <br>Circus owner Savitri provided the old car that Fellini destroyed in the scene following Zampan\u00f2's killing of Il Matto.<ref name=\"Kezich 2006, 150\"/>]]\n\nFunding shortages required Giacosi to improvise in response to Fellini's demands. When filming continued into spring, Giacosi was able to re-create the wintry scenes by piling thirty bags of plaster onto all the bedsheets he could find to simulate a snowscape.<ref name=\"Kezich 2006, 150\"/> When a crowd scene was required, Giacosi convinced the local priest to move up 8 April celebration of the town's patron saint by a few days, thus securing the presence of some 4,000 unpaid extras.<ref name=\"Kezich 2006, 150\"/> To guarantee that the crowd did not dissipate as the hours passed, Fellini instructed assistant director Rossi to shout, \"Get the rooms ready for [[Tot\u00f2]] and [[Sophia Loren]],\" two of the most popular Italian entertainers of the period, so nobody left.<ref>Baxter, 109-110.</ref>\n\nFellini was a notorious perfectionist,<ref>{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Peter B.|title=Federico Fellini, Film Visionary, Is Dead at 73|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0120.html|access-date=3 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 November 1993}}</ref> and this could be trying for his cast. At an [[American Film Institute]] student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over selecting a box in which Zampan\u00f2 carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: \"As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico\".<ref name=\"Alpert, 92\"/> Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive a phone call from Fellini late that night informing him that they would have to re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: \"You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in the morning we do it again.\"<ref name=\"Alpert, 93\"/> As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a \"spiky, untidy look,\" then \"flicked talc into her face to give it the pallor of a [[kabuki]] performer.\" He made her wear a World War I surplus cloak that was so frayed its collar cut into her neck.<ref>Baxter, 107.</ref> She complained: \"You're so nice and sweet to the others in the cast. Why are you so hard on me?\"<ref name=\"Alpert, 92\"/>\n\nUnder Fellini's agreement with his producers, budget overruns had to come out of his own pocket, cutting into any profit potential.<ref name=\"Alpert, 93\"/> Fellini recounted that when it became clear there was insufficient funding to finish the picture, Ponti and De Laurentiis took him to lunch to assure him that they would not hold him to it: \"Let's pretend [the funding agreements] were a joke. Buy us a coffee and we'll forget about them.\"<ref name=\"Alpert, 93\"/> According to Quinn, however, Fellini was able to obtain this indulgence only by agreeing to film some [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pickup shots]] for ''Attila'' that Francisci, the director of record, had neglected to complete.<ref name=\"Baxter, 111\"/>\n\nWhile shooting the final scenes on the wharf of [[Fiumicino]], Fellini suffered a severe bout of clinical depression, a condition that he and his associates tried to keep secret.<ref>Fava & Vigano, 33.</ref> He was able to complete the filming only upon receiving treatment by a prominent Freudian psychoanalyst.<ref>Kezich (2009), 61.</ref>\n\n===Sound===\nAs was the common practice for Italian films at the time, shooting was done without sound; dialogue was added later along with music and sound effects.<ref name=\"van order\">{{cite book|last=Van Order|first=M.

For instance, a line of fifteen words equals an enumeration of up to thirty.  The actor merely counts till thirty: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. etc.\"<ref>Betti, 185.</ref> Biographer [[John Baxter (author)|John Baxter]] has commented on the usefulness of such a system:  \"It helps pinpoint an instant in the speech where he [Fellini] wants a different reaction. 'Go back to 27,' he'll tell an actor, 'but this time, smile.'\"<ref>110.</ref>  Since he didn't need to worry about noise while shooting a scene, Fellini kept up a running commentary during filming, a practice that scandalized more traditional filmmakers, like [[Elia Kazan]]:  \"He talked through each take, in fact yelled at the actors. 'No, there, stop, turn, look at her, ''look'' at her.  See how sad she is, see her tears?  Oh, the poor wretch!  You want to comfort her? Don't turn away; go to her.
