The film, produced by [[Ray Stark]], centers on an odd trio of characters: a struggling actor who has sublet a [[Manhattan]] apartment from a friend, the current occupant (his friend's ex-girlfriend, who has just been abandoned), and her precocious young daughter.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss won the [[50th Academy Awards|1977]] [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance as Elliot Garfield. At the time, he became the youngest man to win an Oscar for Best Actor. Both Mason and Cummings were nominated for Oscars.\n\nThe film became the first romantic comedy to earn $100 million in box-office grosses.\n\n==Plot==\nDancer and divorcee Paula McFadden ([[Marsha Mason]]) and her ten-year-old daughter Lucy ([[Quinn Cummings]]) live in a Manhattan apartment with her married boyfriend, Tony DeForrest. Coming home from shopping, Paula finds Tony gone as he'd suddenly deserted her to travel to Italy for a film role. Prior to his departure (and unbeknownst to Paula), Tony sublet the apartment to Elliot Garfield ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]), a neurotic but sweet aspiring actor from [[Chicago]], who shows up in the middle of the night expecting to move in. Paula, who is demanding, cynical, and neurotic, makes it clear from the start that she doesn't like Elliot, but reluctantly lets him move in. They argue about boundaries, with Elliot agreeing to allow Paula and Lucy to stay.\n\nPaula is struggling to get back into shape so she can resume her career as a dancer. Meanwhile, Elliot has landed the title role in an [[off-off-Broadway]] production of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', but the director, Mark ([[Paul Benedict]]), wants him to play the character as an exaggerated homosexual stereotype\u2014in Mark's words, \"the queen who wanted to be king.\" Reluctantly, Elliot agrees to the non-traditional portrayal, despite knowing that it may mean the end of his acting career. Theater critics from numerous [[New York City]] television stations and newspapers attend opening night and savage the show, paying special attention to trashing Elliot's performance. The play quickly closes, much to his relief.\n\nDespite their frequent clashes and Paula's lack of gratitude for Elliot's help, the two fall in love and sleep together. Lucy, despite liking Elliot, grows cautious and sees the affair as a repeat of what happened with Tony. Elliot convinces Paula that he won't be a repeat of their experience with Tony; later he picks up Lucy from school and takes her on a carriage ride, during which the youngster admits she likes Elliot. In response, Elliot explains how much he cares for Lucy and Paula and that he wouldn't do anything to hurt them.\n\nElliot lands a job at an [[improvisational theatre]], and is soon seen by a well-known film director. He is offered an opportunity for a film role that he cannot turn down, but the job is in Seattle and Elliot will be gone for four weeks. Paula is scared that Elliot is leaving her, never to return, like all the other men in her life. Later, Elliot calls Paula from the [[Telephone booth|phone booth]] across the street to say his flight was delayed, and at the last minute, he invites Paula to go with him while he is filming, suggesting Lucy stay with Paula's friend Donna until they return. Paula declines but is encouraged by Elliot's invitation. Before hanging up, Elliot asks Paula to restring his prized guitar (which he deliberately left at the apartment), and she realizes this proves he really does love her and will indeed return.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Elliot Garfield\n* [[Marsha Mason]] as Paula McFadden\n* [[Quinn Cummings]] as Lucy McFadden\n* [[Paul Benedict]] as Mark Bodine\n* [[Barbara Rhoades]] as Donna Douglas\n* [[Theresa Merritt]] as Mrs. Crosby\n* Michael Shawn as Ronnie Burns\n* [[Patricia Pearcy]] as Rhonda Fontana\n* [[Nicol Williamson]] as Oliver Fry (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nThe film began as a screenplay called ''Bogart Slept Here'' (essentially the story of what happened to [[Dustin Hoffman]] after he became a star) that was to star [[Robert De Niro]] and Mason for [[Warner Bros.]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=25887 |title=Spotlight - The Goodbye Girl |publisher=tcm.com |author=Sarah Heiman |access-date=March 16, 2008}}</ref> It would have been the film De Niro made immediately after ''[[Taxi Driver]]''. [[Mike Nichols]] was hired to direct.<ref name=\"gog\" />\n\nSimon recalled the original idea for the film:\n\n<blockquote>The basic idea of the story was that Marsha, an ex-dancer, was married to a very promising but struggling off-Broadway actor who gets discovered in a small play and is whisked out to Hollywood, where he reluctantly moves with his family. He feels very out of place there...and they have trouble adjusting, especially after his first film makes him an international star...and it creates chaos in their marriage. The story was coming out a little darker than I had imagined, but I envisioned the character of the wife as a very good role for Marsha.<ref name=\"gog\" /></blockquote>\n\nFilming began on ''Bogart Slept Here'' but it became apparent that De Niro wasn't right for the role. Simon recalled: \"...it was clear that any of the humor I had written was going to get lost. It's not that De Niro is not funny, but his humor comes mostly from his nuances, a bemused expression on his face or the way he would look at a character, smile and then look up at the ceiling.\" Nichols insisted on recasting De Niro. Soon after, Nichols left the project.<ref name=\"gog\" />\n\nDreyfuss was brought in to audition with Mason. At the end of the reading, Simon decided the chemistry was there, but the script needed work. He rewrote the screenplay in six weeks.\n\n<blockquote>[The screenplay] had to be funnier, more romantic, the way Marsha and I first imagined the picture would be. What I wanted to do was a prequel. In other words, instead of an off-Broadway actor, married with a child, why don't I start from the beginning? I'd start when they first meet. Not liking each other at first and then falling in love.<ref name=\"gog\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe film's exteriors were filmed in New York City and the interiors were shot on sets in [[Los Angeles]]. Warner Bros. was less than enthused about Simon's script and considered selling the project to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], but the studio ultimately decided to partner with MGM on the film instead.<ref name=\"gog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/14932/The-Goodbye-Girl/articles.html|title=Articles on ''The Goodbye Girl''|website=tcm.com}}</ref> With the 1996 acquisition of [[Turner Entertainment Company]], which owned the pre-May 1986 MGM film library by [[Time Warner]], Warner Bros. now owns the rights and distribution of the film.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe title song, \"[[The Goodbye Girl (song)|Goodbye Girl]]\", was written and performed by [[David Gates]] in 1978, and was a top 20 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart that same year, peaking at #15.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a mostly favorable review, awarding three stars out of four.
