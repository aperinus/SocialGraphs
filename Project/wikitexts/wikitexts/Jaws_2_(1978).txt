The first director for the film, [[John D.

See WP:FILMPLOT for guidelines on film plots. -->\nWhile a new hotel opens on Amity Island, a {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} [[great white shark]] kills two scuba divers photographing the wreckage of the ''Orca'' before heading into Amity waters. Their camera, which took pictures during the attack, is recovered the next day. The shark then kills a female water skier. The driver of the boat attempts self-defense by using a gas tank and [[flare gun]], but the boat explodes, killing her and severely burning the right side of the shark's face.\n\nA [[killer whale]] carcass is found on the beach. Police Chief Martin Brody believes that a shark is responsible. Brody explains his concerns to Mayor Larry Vaughn, who expresses doubts that the town has another shark problem. Brody then finds floating debris from the destroyed speedboat and the boat driver's burnt remains. Brody calls Matt Hooper for assistance, but he is in Antarctica on a research expedition. Brody prohibits his 17-year-old son Mike from boating out of concern for his safety and instead lands him a job on the beach as a show of community service.\n\nThe following day, Brody watches a beach from an observation tower and causes a panic after mistaking a school of bluefish for a shark, and shooting at it. However, his fears are confirmed when photos from the diver's camera are processed, and one of them shows a close-up of the shark. When he presents it to the Amity Town Council, they refuse to believe it is a shark, and vote Brody out as police chief.\n\nThe next morning, Mike disobeys his father's orders by going sailing with his friends, taking his 10-year-old younger brother Sean with him. Marge, another teen, takes Sean with her, and they head out on six separate boats, going past a team of divers led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after submerging, Andrews encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an [[embolism]]. Soon after, the shark hits the boat of teenage couple Eddie Marchand and Tina Wilcox, who have strayed from the others. Eddie falls into the water and is mauled to death.\n\nBrody and his wife Ellen witness Tom's evacuation by ambulance and hear that the other divers suspect something scared him. Deputy Jeff Hendricks, who has taken over as Brody's replacement, tells them that Mike went sailing with his friends, so Brody and Ellen commandeer the police boat, aided by a reluctant Hendricks, to rescue them. They come across Tina's boat and find her hiding in the [[bow (ship)|bow]]; she confirms the shark's presence. Brody hails a passing boat to take Hendricks, Ellen, and Tina to shore, where the truth is revealed, while he goes searching for the kids.\n \nMeanwhile, the shark attacks the group, striking one of their boats and causing most of them to capsize or crash into each other. Mike is knocked unconscious and falls in the water. The only pair whose boat is still seaworthy retrieve Mike and leave the others to take him ashore and get help; Sean and the others remain adrift upon the wreckage of tangled boats. A [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore, but the shark latches onto the chopper's pontoons, capsizing it and drowning the pilot. The shark knocks Sean into the water, and Marge is eaten while saving him.\n\nBrody finds Mike, who informs him of the situation before Brody sends him to safety. Brody finds the others at Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station that supplies power to Amity. The cheering and jumping that greet him attract the shark, which attacks again, causing Brody to maroon the police boat. He tries pulling them in with a winch but instead hooks an underwater power cable. The shark hits the boat wreckage, sending most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to the edge of Cable Junction; Jackie Peters, Mike's love interest, and Sean remain on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody taps the power cable with an oar to lure the shark toward him. The shark bites the cable and is electrocuted. Brody retrieves Sean and Jackie and they join the others on Cable Junction to await rescue.\n<!-- Plot summaries should be set between 400-700 words.

Zanuck]] realized that someone else would produce the film if they did not, and preferred to be in charge of the project themselves.<ref name=\"kach74\"/>\n\nIn October 1975, [[Steven Spielberg]] told the [[San Francisco Film Festival]] that \"making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick\" and that he did not even respond to the producers when they asked him to direct ''Jaws 2''. He claimed that the planned plot was to involve the sons of Quint and Brody hunting a new shark.<ref name=\"Ref_\">{{harvnb|Baxter|1997|p=145}}</ref> Brown said that Spielberg did not want to direct the sequel because he felt that he had done the \"definitive shark movie\".<ref name=\"makingof\"/><ref name=\"Prigg\u00e98\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=8}}</ref> The director later added that his decision was influenced by the problems the ''Jaws'' production faced \u2013 \"I would have done the sequel if I hadn't had such a horrible time at sea on the first film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/06/08/steven-spielberg-jaws-interview/|title=Steven Spielberg talks about 'Jaws' \u2013 the greatest summer movie ever made|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|date=2011-06-08|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=2012-01-02}}</ref>\n\nDespite Spielberg's rejection, the studio went ahead with plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month pre-production process. [[Howard Sackler]], who had contributed to the first film's script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a [[prequel]] based on the sinking of the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']], the story relayed by [[Quint (Jaws character)|Quint]] in the first film. Although Universal president [[Sidney Sheinberg]] thought Sackler's [[Film treatment|treatment]] for the film was intriguing, he rejected the idea.<ref name=\"Ref_a\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=24\u20135}}</ref> On Sackler's recommendation, theatre and film director [[John D. Hancock]] was chosen to helm the picture.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=27}}</ref>\n\nHancock began filming in June 1977. However, after nearly a month of filming, Universal and MCA executives disliked the dark, subtle tone that the film was taking and wanted a more lighthearted and action oriented story. Additionally, Hancock ran into trouble with Sheinberg, who suggested to Hancock and Tristan that his (Sheinberg's) wife, actress [[Lorraine Gary]] (Ellen Brody), \"should go out on a boat and help to rescue the kids.\" When told of the idea, Zanuck replied, \"Over my dead body.\" The next draft of the film's screenplay was turned in with Gary not going out to sea. Hancock says that this, and his later firing of another actress who turned out to be a Universal executive's girlfriend, contributed to his own dismissal from the film.<ref name=\"luke\">{{harvnb|Ford|2004|p=191}}</ref>\n\nHancock began to feel the pressure of directing his first epic adventure film \"with only three film credits, and all small-scale dramas\".<ref name=\"Ref_c\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=66}}</ref> The producers were unhappy with his material, and on a Saturday evening in June 1977, after a meeting with the producers and Universal executives, the director was fired. He and his wife left for [[Rome]] and production was shut down for a few weeks. The couple had been involved in the film for eighteen months.<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=70}}</ref> Hancock blamed his departure on the mechanical shark, telling a newspaper that it still could not swim or bite after a year and a half: \"You get a couple of shots, and [the shark] breaks.\"<ref name=\"kach78\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=78}}</ref> Echoing the first film's production, [[Carl Gottlieb]] was enlisted to further revise the script, adding humor and reducing some of the violence.<ref name=\"Ref_e\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=36\u20137}}</ref> Gottlieb wrote on location at [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]].<ref name=\"Gottlieb221\">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2010|p=221}}</ref> It cost the producers more money to hire Gottlieb to do the rewrite than it would have if they had hired him in the first place.<ref name=\"Ref_e\"/>\n\nAt this point, Spielberg considered returning to direct the sequel. Over the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial weekend]] in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's ''Indianapolis'' speech. Because of his contract for ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', however, Spielberg would not be able to work on the film for a further year and the producers could not wait for him to be free.<ref name=\"Ref_f\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=73}}</ref> Production designer [[Joe Alves]] (who would direct ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'') and [[Verna Fields]] (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it.<ref name=\"makingof\"/><ref name=\"Ref_g\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=74}}</ref> The request was declined by the [[Directors Guild of America]],<ref name=\"Ref_h\">{{harvnb|Rosenfield|1982|p=1}}</ref> partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'', had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to [[Jeannot Szwarc]], best known for the film ''[[Bug (1975 film)|Bug]]'' and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series ''[[Night Gallery]]''.<ref name=\"Ref_i\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=75\u20136}}</ref> Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated water skier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by [[Jeffrey Kramer]], who had been missing from the earlier script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.<ref name=\"Ref_j\">''Jaws 2: A Portrait by Actor Keith Gordon'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref>\n\nThree sharks were built for the film. The first was the \"platform shark\", also referred to as the \"luxurious shark\". Special mechanical effects supervisor [[Robert Mattey]] and [[Roy Arbogast]] used the same body mould used for the shark in the first film.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> The sharks from the original film had rotted behind sheds on the lower lot of Universal Studios in the intervening years, and the only pieces that were salvageable were the chromoly tube frames. Mattey's design was much more complicated and ambitious than the first film. The same (male) body was used, but a brand new head was made by sculptor Chris Mueller which made use of an all-new mouth mechanism, one which incorporated jowls to disguise the pinching of the cheeks that had proven to be a problem with the shark in the original film. The sharks for ''Jaws 2'' were known as ''Bruce Two'' (the sharks for the original film had been nicknamed \"Bruce\", after Steven Spielberg's lawyer), but on set they were referred to as \"Fidel\" and \"Harold\", the latter after David Brown's Beverly Hills lawyer.<ref name=\"kach77\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=77}}</ref>  The other shark props used were a fin and a full shark, both of which could be pulled by boats. \"Cable Junction\", the island shown in the film's climax, was actually a floating barge covered with fiber-glass rocks. This was created in order to enable the shark platform to be positioned to it as close as possible (a real island would have hindered this due to the upward slope of the seabed making the shark platform visible). Like the first film, footage of real sharks filmed by Australian divers [[Ron Taylor (diver)|Ron]] and [[Valerie Taylor (diver)|Valerie Taylor]] was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using the mechanical sharks.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nAlthough the first film was commended for leaving the shark to the imagination until two thirds of the way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because the dramatic \"first image of it coming out of the water\" in the first film could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented that there was no way that they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nLike the first film, shooting on water proved challenging. Scheider said that they were \"always contending with tides, surf and winds ... jellyfish, sharks, waterspouts and hurricane warnings.\"<ref name=\"kach77\"/> After spending hours anchoring the sailboats, the wind would change as they were ready to shoot, blowing the sails in the wrong direction. The saltwater's corrosive effect damaged some equipment, including the metal parts in the sharks.<ref name=\"kach77\"/>\n\n[[Susan Ford]], daughter of U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]], was hired to shoot publicity photographs.<ref name=\"kach76\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=76}}</ref> Many of these photos appeared in Ray Loynd's ''Jaws 2 Log'', which documented the film's production, similar to the ''Jaws Log'', a  book written by Carl Gottlieb covering production of the first film.\n\n===Location===\n[[Martha's Vineyard]] was again used as the location for the town scenes and [[Emerald Coast]] was included on this film.<ref>{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Betty Archer |title=GB teens helped keep 'Jaws 2' water scenes moving |url=https://news.gulfbreezenews.com/articles/gb-teens-helped-keep-jaws-2-water-scenes-moving/ |date=August 21, 2008 |access-date=January 17, 2018 |newspaper=Gulf Breeze News}}</ref> Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders welcomed the money that the company was bringing.<ref name=\"Ref_k\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|pp=60\u20132}}</ref> Shortly after the production arrived in June 1977, local newspaper the ''Grapevine'' wrote:\n\n{{blockquote|The ''Jaws'' people are back among us, more efficient, more organized and more moneyed.

Some people, however, were less pleased by the film crew's presence and refused to cooperate. Only one drugstore allowed its windows to be boarded up for the moody look that Hancock wanted. \"Universal Go Home\" T-shirts began appearing on the streets in mid-June 1977.<ref name=\"Ref_m\">{{harvnb|Loynd|1978|p=64}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Navarre Beach Florida sand.jpg|thumb|right|The majority of filming was at [[Navarre Beach, Florida|Navarre Beach]] in [[Florida]]]]\nWhen Szwarc took over, the majority of the film was shot at [[Navarre Beach, Florida|Navarre Beach]] in [[Florida]], because of the warm weather and the water's depth being appropriate for the shark platform. The company was at this location from August 1 until December 22, 1977.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> The production \"was a boost to the local economy because local boaters, extras and stand-ins or doubles were hired. Universal brought in actors, directors, producers and their wives, camera and crew people who needed housing, food and clothing for the movie. Services were needed for laundry, dry-cleaning and recreation.\" Navarre's Holiday Inn \"Holidome\" was used as the film's headquarters, with the ground floor converted into production offices, and some of the Gulf-front suites remodeled for David Brown and Roy Scheider. Universal rented 100 of the hotel's 200 rooms, spending $1 million.

In 1977, he had quit the role of Michael Vronsky in ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' two weeks before the start of filming because of \"creative differences\".<ref name=\"kach73\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=73}}</ref> Scheider was contracted to Universal at the time for a three-picture deal, but the studio offered to forgive his failure to fulfill his contractual obligation if he agreed to appear in ''Jaws 2''.

On one occasion, Scheider complained (in front of extras) that Szwarc was wasting time with technical issues and the extras while ignoring the principal actors. A meeting was called with the two, David Brown and Verna Fields, in which Scheider and Szwarc were encouraged to settle their differences.

Williams says that it was assumed by everyone that \"the music would come back also and be part of the cast ... it would require new music, certainly, but the signature music of ''Jaws'' should be used as well\". He compares this to \"the great tradition\" for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as ''[[Roy Rogers]]'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger (serial)|The Lone Ranger]]''. In addition to the familiar themes, Szwarc says Williams also composed a \"youthful counterpoint to the shark that is always around when the kids are sailing or going out to sea. It was very inventive\".<ref name=\"musicdvd\">''The Music of Jaws 2'', ''Jaws 2'' DVD, Written, directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau</ref>\n\nSzwarc said that the sequel's music should be \"more complex because it was a more complex film\". Williams says that this score is broader, allowing him to make more use of the orchestra, and use longer notes, and \"fill the space\" created by the director. Williams used a larger ensemble than for the first film, and \"the orchestral palette may have been broader or had longer notes\". Delays in shooting meant that Williams was forced to start working on the score before the film was completed. Szwarc discussed the film with the composer, showing him edited sequences and storyboards. The director praises Williams in being able to work under such difficult conditions.<ref name=\"musicdvd\"/> Critic Mike Beek suggests these time constraints enabled Williams \"to create themes based on ideas and suggestions, rather than a locked down print.\"<ref name=\"Beek\"/>\n\nCritics have praised Williams' score, comparing it favorably to the original. Williams \"uses a few basic elements of the original\u2014the obligatory shark motif, for one\u2014and takes the music off in some new and interesting directions.\" The score is \"more disturbing in places\" than the original, and \"Williams {{sic|fash|ion}} some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music.\" Because ''Jaws 2'' \"isn't a film that requires subtlety ...
