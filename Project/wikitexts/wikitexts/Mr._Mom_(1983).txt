It stars [[Michael Keaton]] (in his first lead role), [[Teri Garr]], [[Martin Mull]], [[Ann Jillian]], and [[Christopher Lloyd]]. It tells the story of a [[furlough]]ed [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] automotive engineer who becomes a [[stay-at-home dad]] and takes care of three young children, as his wife returns to a career in the advertising industry as an executive at a large agency.\n\n==Plot==\nJack Butler lives with his wife, Caroline, and their children Alex, Kenny, and Megan, in a [[Detroit]] [[suburb]]. During the [[early 1980s recession|early-1980s recession]], Jack and his friends Larry and Stan lose their engineering jobs at the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Caroline, having been a housewife for years, uses her college education and experience working in [[advertising]] to re-enter the workforce, leaving Jack to deal with the new and bewildering responsibilities of a stay-at-home dad.\n\nJack discovers childcare and house maintenance involve a complex juggling act, and his initial struggles in daily errands gain the attention and company of other neighborhood housewives. Eventually, he hits his stride and although somewhat distracted by the flirtatious Joan (a neighbor and friend of Caroline's), he begins to feel confined by suburban domestic life. Simultaneously, he feels threatened by Caroline's responsibilities and work-life as a fast-climbing ad executive.\n\nMeanwhile, Caroline contends with challenges in the workforce: her maternal and housekeeping instincts jeopardize her position as a sophisticated executive, and her boss Ron Richardson is intent on having his way with her. During a pitch to a hard-to-please client, Caroline's insight as a budget-conscious housewife proves invaluable. The client's president wants her to fly to [[Los Angeles]] to help shoot a commercial.\n\nIn the meantime, Jack's former employer invites him to interview for his old job, but his former supervisor Jinx betrayed his reputation. Jack lectures them on dirty practices and storms out.\n\nRon tries to convince Caroline to leave Jack and marry him while Joan continues to try and seduce Jack. After a commercial shoot in Los Angeles, Caroline relaxes in her hotel bathtub. Ron sneaks into her room with champagne. Back home, Jack tries calling her so the kids can talk to her, but Ron answers. He hangs up, leading Jack to think his wife is having an affair. Caroline fends off Ron and quits her job.\n\nThe next day dawns with repair people in the home to fix a broken television and [[Pest control|spray for bugs]]. Caroline arrives home unexpectedly, and she and Jack talk over their misunderstandings, reuniting as a stronger couple. Ron stops by begging Caroline to come back to work as the client thinks only she can properly handle their account. However, Caroline says she intends to get a better job and has missed her family. Though she finally agrees to stay with the agency after Ron agrees to offer her the chance to work from home 2 days a week and reduce her workload in order for her to have the chance to spend more time with her family. Jinx also comes begging for Jack to return to work. Jack punches Jinx in the face for being rude to Jack's son and says he won't come back to work unless Larry and Stan do also. Jinx accepts the conditions.\n\nOn the newly repaired TV, the national commercial Caroline helped produce is being broadcast.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per opening tombstone credits, roles and order per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as Jack Butler, a Detroit automotive engineer who becomes a stay-at-home dad after losing his job.\n* [[Teri Garr]] as Caroline Butler, the wife of Jack who gets a job at an advertising company.\n* [[Frederick Koehler]] as Alex Butler, the son of Jack and Caroline.\n* [[Taliesin Jaffe]] as Kenny Butler, the younger son of Jack and Caroline.\n* Courtney & Brittany White as Megan Butler, the baby daughter of Jack and Caroline.\n* [[Martin Mull]] as Ron Richardson, the head of an advertising company that Caroline works at.\n* [[Ann Jillian]] as Joan, a friend of Caroline who lives in her neighborhood.\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as \"Jinx\" Latham, the supervisor of Jack at the Ford Motor Company.\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Larry, Jack's co-worker at the Ford Motor Company who loses his job.\n* [[Graham Jarvis]] as Humphries\n* [[Carolyn Seymour]] as Eve\n* [[Miriam Flynn]] as Annette\n<!--The rest according to the end credits.-->\n* Tom Leopold as Stan, Jack's co-worker at the Ford Motor Company who loses his job.\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as Executive #1\n* [[Derek McGrath]] as Executive #2\n* Ken Olfson as Executive #3\n* Frank Birney as Executive #4\n* Hilary Beane as Executive #5\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Check-Out Lady\n* [[Patti Deutsch]] as Deli Girl\n\n== Production ==\nWhile working at [[Motown Productions]], story editor and struggling producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner|Lauren Shuler]] read an article in ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and kept in touch with him. One day, Hughes told Shuler about a disastrous experience he had looking after his two children in the absence of his wife, which Shuler found hilarious. After Hughes asked if that could make a good movie, she replied that \"it sure sounds funny to me\". Hughes wrote the film and flew to Los Angeles to rewrite the script with Shuler. As Hughes had a TV deal with [[Aaron Spelling]], he brought him in as an executive producer. Studio executives at [[Universal Studios]], unhappy that Hughes worked in Chicago and not Los Angeles, fired him, bringing in a group of TV writers to remake his script.<ref name=\"mogul\"/>\n\n[[Ron Howard]] was offered the opportunity to direct the film but turned it down to do ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cormier|first=Roger|date=2016-03-16|title=15 Surprising Facts About Splash|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/76738/15-surprising-facts-about-splash|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-13|website=Mental Floss|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAt this point, the studio decided to turn the project into a feature film instead of a television movie.
