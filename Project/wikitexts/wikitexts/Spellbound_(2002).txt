The film follows eight competitors in the [[72nd Scripps National Spelling Bee|1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee]].

As they appear from left to right on the DVD's cover:\n\n=== Neil Kadakia ===\nNeil (as speller # 139) missed \"[[wiktionary: hellebore|hellebore]]\" as \"helebore\" in the bee to get ninth place.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13893-2004Jun3.html] The proctor of the Washington Informer regional spelling bee featured in the film is [[Mac McGarry]]\n\n=== April DeGideo ===\nApril DeGideo, who lives in [[Ambler, Pennsylvania|Ambler]], [[Pennsylvania]], participated in the 1998 and 1999 bees, in the latter of which she placed third, representing the ''Times Herald'' of [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], Pennsylvania. April graduated in 2007 from [[New York University]] with a degree in Journalism. She then went on to get a second degree in creative writing and later went on to publish two books. ''The study guide'', and ''Where to start''.\n\n=== Harry Altman ===\nMany critics who reviewed ''Spellbound'' singled out Altman (speller # 8) as its most interesting \"character\". [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that he \"has so many eccentricities that he'd be comic relief in a teenage comedy... He screws his face up into so many shapes while trying to spell a word that it's a wonder the letters can find their way to the surface.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/spellbound-2003|title=Spellbound|author=Roger Ebert|date=16 May 2003}}</ref> He spelled \"[[wiktionary: cephalalgia|cephalalgia]]\" and \"[[wiktionary: odyssey|odyssey]]\" over the course of the bee. In a prolonged clip, Altman was eliminated in the fourth round, on the word \"[[wiktionary: banns|banns]]\", which he spelled \"bands\". He later appeared in the 2001 Bee, but was again eliminated in the fourth round. Altman went to the [[Bergen County Academies|Academy for Engineering and Design Technology]] in [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]], [[New Jersey]]. In autumn 2005, he enrolled in the [[University of Chicago]].

Nupur won the bee against David Lewandowski, a speller from Indiana who misspelled \"[[opsimath]].\"  She turned down an MTV reality show that would have followed her college years.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/05/nupur-lala-reflects-on-winning-national-spelling-bee-89296.html | title=Nupur Lala reflects on winning National Spelling Bee | date=May 27, 2013 | access-date=June 17, 2015}}</ref>   In 2003, she entered [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]] to study brain and cognitive sciences and pre-medical studies and graduated in 2007 with a degree in Brain, Behavior and Cognitive Science.<ref>http://web.mit.edu/gabrieli-lab/People/technical-assistant.html Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Gabrieli Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory website</ref>  In the fall of 2014 she entered the College of Medicine at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. She also appeared in the 2020 documentary ''[[Spelling the Dream]]''.\n\n=== Ted Brigham ===\nTed Brigham was speller # 1. He represented the ''Rolla Daily Record'' of [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]], [[Missouri]]. One of the more notable stories from his experience is the congratulations posted by students on the marquee in front of his high school in which \"champ\" was misspelled (presumably as an ironic joke) as \"chapm\". Ted misspelled \"[[wiktionary: distractible|distractible]]\" in the second round, becoming the first of the eight spellers eliminated. Ted attended medical school in Kansas City, Missouri until his death in December 2007. His family chose not to disclose the circumstances of his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/KansasCity/DeathNotices.asp?Page=LifeStory&PersonID=99091039|title=Theodore Earl Brigham Obituary: View Theodore Brigham's Obituary by Kansas City Star|work=Kansas City Star}}</ref>\n\n=== Other notable spellers ===\n* '''George Thampy''' was speller # 245 in the bee and was mentioned several times within the film. He misspelled \"kirtle\" as \"curtle\" for third place, tying with April DeGideo. Thampy eventually won the 2000 national bee.\n* '''David Lewandowski''' finished second place in the spelling bee, spelling \"opsimath\" as \"opsomath\". After David's mistake, Nupur spelled \"logorrhea\" to win the competition.\n* '''Allyson Lieberman''' was originally slated to be featured as one of the spellers in the documentary, but her clips were ultimately left out of the film; the scene involving her can be found in the special features of the DVD. The youngest contestant in the entire 1998 bee, she misspelled \"purblind\".\n* '''Frances Taschuk''' and '''Ann Foley''' are shown in the final set of scenes prior to the last round of the spelling bee. Frances misspells \"acoelous\" and Ann \"quinquevir\".\n* '''Vinay Krupadev''' is in a scene involving Harry's mother feeling \"sorry for the boy from Texas who got 'yenta'\". She was referring to Vinay, who is actually from Marietta, Ohio, and his pronunciation of \"yenta,\" shown in the film. He eventually spelled it \"yente\".\n* '''Jess Altman''' was mentioned in a scene by Harry Altman for being a terrific speller and that he was disappointed she didn't make the Nationals.\n* '''Sonia Nagala''' won the North Dakota bee with the word \"butyraceous\", but was eliminated in the second round of the Nationals.  She completed her MBA at Harvard Business School in 2018.\n* [[Frank Neuhauser]], winner of the first National Spelling Bee, held in 1925, also appears in the film.<ref name=wp>{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|title=Frank Neuhauser, winner of first national spelling bee, dies at 97 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/frank-neuhauser-winner-of-first-national-spelling-bee-dies-at-97/2011/03/21/AB9J9BAB_story.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=2011-03-21 |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Critics|Critical response}}\n''Spellbound'' opened to positive reviews from critics.
