The film covers Jacqueline's meteoric rise to fame, her alleged affair with Hilary's husband [[Christopher Finzi]], and her struggle with [[multiple sclerosis]] starting in her late 20s ultimately leading to her death at the young age of 42.\n\nThe screenplay by [[Frank Cottrell-Boyce]] claimed in the end credits to have been based on the 1997 [[memoir]] ''[[A Genius in the Family (book)|A Genius in the Family]]'' by Piers and Hilary du Pr\u00e9 (later republished under the title ''Hilary and Jackie'').<ref>{{cite book | last1=Du Pr\u00e9 | first1=Piers  | last2=Du Pr\u00e9 |first2=Hilary | title=A Genius in the Family: An Intimate Memoir of Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 | location=London | publisher=Heinemann | year=1997 | isbn=0-434-00344-1}}</ref> However, that memoir had not yet been published when ''Hilary and Jackie'' was being filmed. Cottrell-Boyce stated, \"Hilary was working on the book at the same time as I was working on the film ... it was at a very early stage when we were doing the script\".<ref>'Inside Film' programme, handed out at early showings of the film</ref> The film was instead based on conversations with Hilary and Piers; unlike the book it does not claim to be the true story, and contains some fictionalised incidents.\n\nThe film attracted controversy and criticism for allegedly distorting details in Jacqueline's life, and several personal friends of Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 publicly condemned the film. Hilary du Pr\u00e9 publicly defended her version of the story.<ref name=\"truth-1999\">{{cite news |last=Du Pr\u00e9 |first=Hilary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,323814,00.html |title=The truth about our wonderful sister Jackie|access-date=20 April 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=21 January 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"defends-1999\">{{cite news |title=Du Pr\u00e9 sister defends film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jan/21/stephenmoss.stephenmoss1|access-date=20 April 2018 |last=Moss |first=Stephen |work=The Guardian |date=21 January 1999}}</ref>\n\n''Hilary and Jackie'' generally received critical acclaim, and both Griffiths and Watson were nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1960s London, sisters [[Hilary du Pr\u00e9|Hilary]] and [[Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9|Jacqueline \"Jackie\" du Pr\u00e9]] both pursue musical professions after being instructed throughout their childhoods in music by their mother; the [[flute]] for Hilary, and the [[cello]] for Jackie. Though Jackie rebelled against practising as a child, she became a [[virtuoso]] in early adulthood, quickly rising to international prominence.\n\nWhile Jackie tours throughout Europe, Hilary remains in London with her parents and brother, Piers, and struggles in her musical studies at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. She becomes acquainted with a gregarious fellow student, [[Christopher Finzi|Christopher \"Kiffer\" Finzi]], son of composer [[Gerald Finzi]], and the two begin a romantic relationship. Hilary begins playing in a community orchestra, where she garners local fame. Jackie returns home from touring in [[Moscow]], and pleads with Hilary to share a [[Flat (housing)|flat]] with her. Instead, Hilary marries Kiffer, and the two relocate to a farmhouse in the country to start a family. Meanwhile, Jackie begins dating pianist and conductor [[Daniel Barenboim]], with whom she bonds over their mutual love of music. Her eventual conversion to [[Judaism]] and subsequent marriage to Daniel garners significant publicity.\n\nLater, Jackie arrives unannounced at Hilary and Kiffer's home, inexplicably forgoing scheduled engagements she has in [[Los Angeles]]. She confides to Hilary that she wants to have sex with Kiffer, and makes attempts to seduce him. The next day, Hilary finds Jackie stripped naked in the woods in the midst of an emotional breakdown. Daniel arrives and attempts to console her, but she is indifferent to him. Jackie remains at Hilary's home, and Hilary consents to Jackie having a sexual encounter with Kiffer, hoping it will help her work through her nervous breakdown. This, however, ultimately drives a rift between the sisters as the affair becomes emotionally suffused. Jackie leaves and resumes touring, but yearns for a different life.\n\nFrom Jackie's perspective, Hilary chose a life with Kiffer over their relationship. While Jackie found solace in her marriage to Daniel, she began to notice a subtle yet progressive deterioration of her [[motor control|motor skill]]s and [[Eye-hand coordination|hand-eye coordination]]. It had in fact been unspoken anxieties over her health that led to her previous visit to Hilary's.\n\nDuring a live performance, Jackie finds herself unable to stand, and has to be carried offstage by Daniel. She is diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]], and Hilary goes to visit her in hospital. Jackie remains optimistic about her diagnosis, but the disease progresses rapidly, leaving her unable to position her fingers or use a [[Bow (music)|bow]]. Daniel continues to conduct around the world, and Jackie finds he is having an affair. As her disease progresses, she becomes [[paralysis|paralysed]] before becoming [[deafness|deaf]] and mute. One night, Hilary goes to visit Jackie{{en dash}}who is in the throes of [[tremor]]s{{en dash}}and recounts a cherished childhood memory of the two playing on the beach. Shortly after, Hilary hears news of Jackie's death on the radio. The film ends with Jackie's spirit standing on the beach where she used to play as a child, watching herself and her sister frolicking on the sand as little girls.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Rachel Griffiths]] as [[Hilary du Pr\u00e9]]\n** [[Keeley Flanders]] as Young Hilary\n* [[Emily Watson]] as [[Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9]]\n** Auriol Evans as Young Jackie\n* [[James Frain]] as [[Daniel Barenboim]]\n* [[David Morrissey]] as [[Christopher Finzi]]\n* [[Charles Dance]] as Derek du Pr\u00e9\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as [[Iris du Pr\u00e9|Iris Greep du Pr\u00e9]], Hilary and Jackie's mother\n* [[Rupert Penry-Jones]] as Piers du Pr\u00e9\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as [[William Pleeth]]\n* [[Nyree Dawn Porter]] as [[Margot Fonteyn]]\n* [[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as Professor Bentley\n* Helen Rowe as Instrumentalist\n}}\n\n==Production==\nScenes were filmed in the [[Liverpool Blue Coat School|Blue Coat School]], the [[County Sessions House, Liverpool|County Sessions House]], [[George's Dock]], [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool|St. George's Hall]], and the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in Liverpool.

The film woefully fails to convey Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9's wonderful joy in making music and her unique ability to bring that joy to her audience.
