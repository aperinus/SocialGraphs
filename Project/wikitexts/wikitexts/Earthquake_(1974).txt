The plot concerns the struggle for survival after a catastrophic [[earthquake]] destroys most of the city of [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]].\n\nDirected by Robson with a [[screenplay]] by George Fox and [[Mario Puzo]], the film starred a large cast of well-known actors, including Heston, Gardner, [[George Kennedy]], [[Lorne Greene]], [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]], [[Richard Roundtree]], [[Marjoe Gortner]], [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]], [[Lloyd Nolan]], [[Victoria Principal]], and (under an alias) [[Walter Matthau]]. It is notable for the use of an innovative [[sound effect]] called [[Sensurround]], which created the sense of actually experiencing an earthquake in theatres.\n\n==Plot==\nOn his way to work, former football star Stewart Graff, having just fought with his wife Remy, visits Denise Marshall, an actress who is the widow of one of his friends. He drops off an autographed football for her son Corry.\n\nA mild earthquake jolts the [[Greater Los Angeles|Los Angeles metro area]]. At the California Seismological Institute (CSI), Walter Russell has calculated that Los Angeles will suffer a major earthquake within the next few days. Scientists at the CSI debate whether to go public with their prediction of a major quake. Fearful their funding will be jeopardized, they decide only to alert the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and [[Los Angeles Police Department|police]] so that they can be ready to mobilize.\n\nWhen Rosa Amici realizes she does not have enough money to pay for her groceries, store manager Jody Joad says she can pay the difference next time. Joad learns that his Guard unit is being called up, so he heads home to change. His housemates harass and tease him for having posters of male bodybuilders on his wall.\n\nThe tremor cancels Denise's film shoot, so she goes to Stewart's office. The pair go back to Denise's house for sex. He promises to come back later that night. Returning to work, his boss and father-in-law, Sam Royce, offers Stewart the company presidency. Stewart calls Denise, breaks off their plans, and then goes to Sam's office to accept his offer. He is stunned to find Remy there, assumes she convinced Sam to offer the promotion to save their marriage, and he storms off. As Remy follows him out of the building, an earthquake measuring 9.9 on the [[Richter Scale]] strikes, destroying much of Los Angeles.\n\nSam and many others are trapped on the upper floors of their building. Sam rigs a fire hose to a chair and lowers his staff down one at a time. Before he can descend, Sam suffers a heart attack, and Stewart climbs up to rescue him.\n\nCorry has been caught on a bridge, entangled with high voltage electric cables. Denise finds him unconscious and climbs down to save him. Unable to climb back out, she hails a passing truck, driven by Miles Quade and Sal Amici. After saving Denise and her son, LAPD Sgt. Lou Slade commandeers the truck to use as an ambulance.\n\nRosa is arrested for [[looting]] by a National Guard unit led by Jody. He orders her to stay inside a secluded store for safety. Another group of troops arrives with Jody's housemates, who are being detained for looting. Jody executes them for all the ridicule he has endured from them.\n\t\n[[File:Lake Hollywood Reservoir by clinton steeds.jpg|thumb|left|The simulated collapse of [[Mulholland Dam]] \u2013 and the subsequent deluge \u2013 forms the film's climax.]]\nStewart escorts his co-workers to the Wilson Plaza shopping center, now a [[triage]] center. While Stewart searches for Denise and Corry, Sam is taken to Dr. Jim Vance, but he does not survive.\n\nStewart drives Sgt. Lou around, searching for survivors when they come across Jody and his unit. As Jody threatens to fire on them, Rosa emerges from the store, screaming for help. Stewart drives away but stops out of sight. Lou sneaks back and gets the jump on Jody, shooting him in self-defense and rescuing Rosa.\n\nThey return to Wilson Plaza, which an aftershock has destroyed. When they realize that there are survivors trapped in an underground garage, Stewart and Lou crawl into a sewer and drill through to the garage using a [[jackhammer]]. Stewart is overjoyed to find Denise alive and, as he hugs her, he sees Remy standing just behind her.\n\nThe Mulholland Dam finally gives way, flooding the sewers. Lou and Denise make it up a ladder to safety, but as Remy climbs out, she is knocked off into the flooded sewer. Stewart looks up at Denise, but he cannot abandon Remy. Both of them, along with many others, are swept away, leaving Denise in shock and grief.\n\nDr. Vance tells Lou that Los Angeles \"used to be a hell of a town,\" as the remaining survivors take in the devastated cityscape.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as Stewart Graff\n* [[Ava Gardner]] as Remy Royce-Graff\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Lou Slade\n* [[Lorne Greene]] as Sam Royce\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]] as Denise Marshall\n* [[Richard Roundtree]] as Miles Quade\n* [[Marjoe Gortner]] as Jody Joad\n* [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]] as Dr. Willis Stockle\n* [[Lloyd Nolan]] as Dr. James Vance\n* [[Victoria Principal]] as Rosa Amici\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Drunk<ref name=\"Crist1974\" />\n* [[Monica Lewis]] as Barbara\n* [[Gabriel Dell]] as Sal Amici\n* [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz, Jr.]] as Emilio Chavez\n* [[Lloyd Gough]] as Bill Cameron\n* [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] as Mayor Lewis\n* [[Kip Niven]] as Walter Russell\n* [[Scott Hylands]] as Max\n* Tiger Williams as Corry Marshall\n* [[Donald Moffat]] as Dr. Harvey Johnson\n* [[Jesse Vint]] as Buck\n* [[Alan Vint]] as Ralph\n* Michael Richardson as Hank\n* John Elerick as Carl Leeds\n* [[John S.

Inspiration came in the form of the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|San Fernando earthquake]] of February 1971.<ref name=\"Davis2014\" /> Director [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]] and Lang were intrigued by the idea of creating a disaster on film that would not be confined to an airliner, but rather take place over a large area. Producer Bernard Donnenfeld helped produce the film, but was uncredited.<ref name=\"Worsley\" />\n\nBudgeted at US$7,000,000, ''Earthquake'' found itself in a race against the clock with the bigger-budgeted disaster film, ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'', which was being produced by [[Irwin Allen]] and financed, for the first time, by two studios ([[20th Century Fox]] and [[Warner Bros.]]).\n\n===Development===\nLang scored a coup when he was able to sign screenwriter [[Mario Puzo]] to write the first draft during the summer of 1972. Puzo, fresh from the success of his novel and film, ''[[The Godfather]]'', delivered the draft script in August. However, Puzo's detailed and expansive script necessitated a larger production budget, as the action and multiple story arcs were spread over a vast geographical area in Los Angeles. Universal was faced with either cutting the script or increasing the projected budget. Puzo's involvement with ''Earthquake'' was short-lived, as [[Paramount Pictures]] was anxious to begin development with the followup to ''The Godfather'', ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' in early-1973. Because Puzo's services contractually were obligated to the sequel, he was unable to continue any further work on ''Earthquake''.\n\nThe ''Earthquake'' script sat at Universal Studios for a short period, but was brought back to life by the huge success of the [[20th Century Fox]] hit ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'', released in December 1972. Fueled by that film's enormous box-office receipts, Universal Studios put pre-production on ''Earthquake'' back into high gear, hiring writer George Fox to continue work with Puzo's first draft. Fox was principally a magazine writer and never had written a screenplay, so director Mark Robson worked with him to narrow the scope of the script to fit into the budgetary constraints. After 11 drafts, ''Earthquake'' went before the cameras in February 1974.<ref name=\"Worsley\" />\n\n===Casting===\nWhile ''The Towering Inferno'' featured a larger \"all star\" cast,{{efn|Universal had approached [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] and [[Paul Newman]], to star in ''Earthquake'', but they had already been signed for ''The Towering Inferno''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}}} Universal was able to land [[Charlton Heston]] in the lead role.  Rounding out the top billing were [[Ava Gardner]] (who co-starred with Heston in 1963's ''[[55 Days at Peking]]''), [[George Kennedy]], [[Lorne Greene]], and [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]].  [[Richard Roundtree]] (riding a wave of success from the ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' film series) was brought in after filming had already started, filling the part of an [[Evel Knievel]]-like motorcycle stuntman.  Former evangelical [[Marjoe Gortner]] was hired as the antagonist, Jody. Relative unknown [[Victoria Principal]] was hired to play the sister of Roundtree's business partner, Sal, played by veteran actor [[Gabriel Dell]].\n\n[[Walter Matthau]] was cast in a cameo role, for which he was credited as \"Walter Matuschanskayasky\".  Executive Producer Jennings Lang, who had worked with Matthau on the previous year's ''[[Charley Varrick]]'' was able to convince him to appear in the role (originally to be filled by veteran actor [[Harry Morgan]]).  The unpaid cameo - and his credited name - were part of the deal. {{efn|Matthau himself invented the name \"Matuschanskayasky\" as well as the fiction that it was his birth name.<ref name=\"snopes\" />}}\n\n===Set design===\nProduction necessitated the complete re-dressing of the entire Universal Studios \"New York Street\" backlot in order to simulate the catastrophic earthquake of the title. Along with a clever use of miniatures of actual buildings, [[matte painting]]s, and full-scale sets (some of which were placed on rollers for a shaking effect), ''Earthquake'' used a new technique developed especially for the film: a \"shaker mount\" camera system that mimicked the effects of an earthquake by moving the entire camera body several inches side to side.<ref name=\"Turnock2014\" /> This camera mount was used for most exterior scenes or other instances where shooting on location.\n\n===Stunts===\nExtensive use of highly trained [[stunt man|stunt artists]] for the most dangerous scenes involving high falls, dodging falling debris, and flood sequences, set a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] record for the most stunt artists involved in any film production up until that time: 141.<ref name=\"Casper2011\" /> Major stunt sequences in the film required careful [[choreography]] between the stunt artists and behind-the-scenes stunt technicians who were responsible for triggering full-scale effects, such as falling debris. Timing was critical, since some rigged effects involved dropping six [[ton]] chunks of reinforced concrete in order to flatten cars, with stunt performers only a few feet away. In other scenarios, some stunt artists were required to fall sixty feet onto large air bags from the rafters of Universal's largest stage (Stage 12) \u2013 for which they were paid the sum of $500.<ref name=\"aolBTS\" /> While every precaution was taken to prevent injuries, several did occur during filming. One stunt person suffered a concussion during the flood sequence (the accident was used in the film), and several stunt artists were injured during the elevator crash scene, since the set was designed to collapse upon them.\n\n===Sound effects===\nUniversal Studios and Jennings Lang wanted ''Earthquake'' to be an \"event film\", something that would draw audiences into the theatre multiple times. After several ideas were tossed about (which included bouncing [[styrofoam]] faux \"debris\" over audience members' heads), Universal's sound department came up with a process called \"[[Sensurround]]\" \u2013 a series of large speakers  made by [[Cerwin-Vega]] powered by [[BGW Systems|BGW]] amplifiers, that would pump in sub-audible \"infra bass\" sound waves at 120 [[decibel]]s (equivalent to a jet airplane at takeoff), giving the viewer the sensation of an earthquake. The process was tested in several theatres around the United States prior to the film's release, yielding various results. A famous example is [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood, California]], where the \"Sensurround\" cracked the plaster in the ceiling. The same theatre premiered ''Earthquake'' three months later &ndash; with a newly installed net over the audience to catch any falling debris &ndash; to tremendous success.<ref name=\"imdb.trivia\" />\n\nThe \"Sensurround\" process proved to be a large audience draw, but not without generating a fair share of controversy. When the film premiered in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], the head of the building and safety department demanded the system be turned down, as he was afraid it would cause structural damage. In [[Billings, Montana]], a knick-knack shop next door to a theatre using the system lost part of its inventory when items from several shelves were thrown to the floor when the system was cued during the quake scenes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nSensurround was used again for the films ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' (1976), ''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'' (1977), and ''[[Saga of a Star World|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (1979).<ref name=\"mtsu\" />\n\nThe 2006 Universal Studios Home Entertainment DVD release features the original \"Sensurround\" 3.1 audio track, duplicating the original theatrical \"Sensurround\" track (but oddly in mono directed to the front 3 speakers rather than the original stereo mix), but no actual 'rumble' generator was used, and only the two control tones that activated the generator can be heard. In addition, the film's original soundtrack was remixed in [[Surround Sound]] 5.1 which was simply a tag as once again only the control tones feature on the track.\n\n===Music===\nJohn Williams' music for ''Earthquake'' was the second of his trio of scores for large-scale disaster films, having previously scored ''The Poseidon Adventure'' and following with ''The Towering Inferno''.<ref name=\"imdb_williams\" />  Williams scored both ''Earthquake'' and ''The Towering Inferno'' in the summer of 1974, both scores showing similarities to one another (notably ''Earthquake's'' theme and ''The Towering Inferno's'' love theme sharing the same eight-note melody). The music of the song \"[[C'est si Bon]]\" by [[Henri Betti]] is played on the guitar in the middle of the film. \n\nOn December 10, 2019, La-La Land Records released a fully remastered and expanded version of Williams' music, as part of the ''Disaster Movie Soundtrack Collection'', which includes the remastered expansions of Williams's music for this film, as well as ''The Towering Inferno'' and ''The Poseidon Adventure''.\n\n===Pretests and re-edits===\nAfter an October 2, 1974 test screening in [[Joplin, Missouri]], Universal opted to cut 30 minutes from the film, notably from the pre-quake sequences, at the cost of some of the dramatic flow. This included a narration sequence about the San Andreas fault and an impending catastrophic earthquake that would occur in either Los Angeles or San Francisco. This scene was filmed and was set to be shown before the opening title credits (although it was removed at the last minute, it was eventually included as the opening sequence of the NBC television edit for the September, 1976 broadcast premiere). Also excised were lengthy scenes of Remy (Gardner) and Stewart (Heston) arguing at the beginning of the film. After Remy's fake suicide, Dr. Vance ([[Lloyd Nolan]]) arrives at the Graff home and begins to talk with Stewart (an old friend). Dr. Vance inadvertently informs Stewart that Remy had an abortion two years prior (he was told it was a miscarriage). Remy appears, and they fight because Stewart wanted the baby and Remy did not. Stewart storms off. This explains why Stewart resents Remy so much. (In the final cut of the film, they just seem angry at one another.) There was more of Slade's leaving the police station, and footage of Rosa's leaving the market was shot as well. She was filmed waiting for a bus and being offered a lift from a man on a motorcycle (this footage eventually was used in the film's television cut). Just before the earthquake, Stewart and Remy had a final fight (in front of Stewart's car) that was deleted as well. During the earthquake, there was a scene of a nearby lumberyard's falling apart, and this was removed from the final cut.\n\nOther scenes were shot to wrap up many characters' stories after the earthquake, but were deleted from the final print:  Walt Russell and Dr. Stockle \u2013 whose fates are undetermined after the quake in the theatrical release \u2013 were shown alive in the seismology laboratory post-quake. They were shown finding the earthquake's magnitude to be 9.9 on the Richter scale. The film's final scene originally had Denise's asking Lou Slade if Stewart had survived; upon hearing of his death, she walks over to Corry who has regained consciousness.\n\n===The elevator scene===\nA scene involving an [[elevator]] loaded with passengers plummeting 25 floors to the ground during the earthquake is one of the film's more notorious sequences, mainly for how its conclusion was depicted.  As originally scripted, the occupants were pressed to the ceiling of the elevator as it fell down the shaft, and then dropped to the floor when the elevator crashes to the bottom. To film this, an elevator set was built suspended several feet over the stage floor, allowing for the dropping of the set (with the stunt people inside).  The scene was filmed several times, with several stunt people involved. Copious amounts of [[stage blood]] were rigged to spray the stunt people inside the elevator set with blood when the set came crashing to the ground. After several tries over two separate filming days weeks apart (the break in filming was an attempt to perfect the mechanical effects involved), and with unsatisfactory results, the decision was made to edit the scene with an \"animated blood\" effect to be added in post production. The [[optical effect]] was superimposed over a still frame of part of the unusable footage, resulting in the \"cartoonish\" nature of the shot. The television version removed the animated blood sequence.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Reception ==\nReleased in the United States on November 15, 1974, ''Earthquake'' ranked third among the high-grossing film of the year; ''The Towering Inferno'' was the highest.<ref name=\"Cook2002\" />\n\n===Box office===\n''Earthquake'' grossed $1,306,271 in its opening weekend from 62 theatres in 51 cities.<ref name=\"variety\" /> It eventually grossed $79.7 million domestically ($439.2 million, adjusted for inflation in 2021 dollars) being one of the highest-grossing films of the time.<ref name=\"bomojo_list\" /><ref name=\"Wallechinsky\" /><ref name=\"bomojo\" /> The film earned {{JPY|3 billion}} ({{US$|10 million|long=no}}) overseas in Japan,<ref>{{cite journal |title='Disasters' Most Successful |journal=Japan Report |date=February 1, 1976 |volume=22 |issue=3 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8PjAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA23-PP6 |publisher=Japan Information Center, Consulate General of Japan}}</ref> bringing its worldwide gross to {{US$|{{#expr:79.7+10}} million|long=no}}.\n\n===Critical response===\nAt its release, critics generally acknowledged the special effects in ''Earthquake'' while discounting other aspects. Without either panning or praising the film, [[Nora Sayre]] of the ''New York Times'' wrote that it was an improvement on ''Airport '75'' and observed, \"The impulse to shout advice to the screen\u2014get out! go away! don't enter that building\u2014is quite powerful, so this does rank as a participatory movie.\"<ref name=\"NYTreview\" /> [[Judith Crist]] wrote in ''New York Magazine'' that \"the nonsense is bearable for the spectacle.

But with an earthquake, the final solution is out of one's hands, anyone's hands - even [[Allstate]]'s. If the tremors don't stop, then everybody'll die; if they do, then only a few people will die. End of story.\"<ref name=\"siskel\" /> [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that the Sensurround vibrations \"succeed very nicely in making themselves felt as well as heard and they set up an anxiety which makes watching 'Earthquake' a very ambivalent experience for anyone who, so to speak, has been there before.\"<ref name=\"champlin\" /> Gary Arnold of ''The Washington Post'' wrote \"Thanks to Sensurround, 'Earthquake' figures to be the gimmick hit of 1974. Without the gimmick, it would be difficult to distinguish this perfunctory, mediocre piece of storytelling from Universal's other disaster vehicle, ''[[Airport 1975]].''\"<ref name=\"arnold\" />\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 47% from 30 reviews with an average score of 4.90 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"The destruction of Los Angeles is always a welcome sight, but ''Earthquake'' offers little besides big actors slumming through crumbling sets.\"<ref name=\"RottenTom\" /> Metacritic, who uses a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighed average]], has assigned the film a score of 56/100 based on 6 critic reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"meta\" />  [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a \"BOMB\" rating, stating \"[the] title tells the story in hackneyed disaster epic ... Marjoe as a sex deviate and Gardner as Lorne Greene's daughter tie for film's top casting honors.\"<ref name=\"Maltin\" /> Gardner was only 8 years younger than Lorne Greene.\n\n===Accolades===\n''Earthquake'' was nominated for four Academy Awards. including [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] (Art Direction: [[Alexander Golitzen]] and [[E.

Editing and re-recorded dialogue helped integrate this expansion into the original film.  An entirely new storyline shot specifically for the television version was that of a young married couple ([[Debralee Scott]] and [[Sam Chew Jr.|Sam Chew]]) flying to Los Angeles on an airplane. The husband seeks a job with the Royce Construction company of the film (in fact, hoping to work with Charlton Heston's character, Stewart Graff), while his wife has the eerily accurate ability to see the future with [[tarot cards]].  Their airliner attempts to land at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] as the titular earthquake hits, and the airliner makes a [[touch-and-go landing]] on a runway that is breaking up, diverting to [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]]. Throughout the remainder of the television version, the film cuts back to the couple as they discuss their future together, and the husband's wish to return to Los Angeles and help rebuild the city.\n\nThe \"Sensurround\" audio of the original film was simulcast in FM stereo in the Los Angeles and New York markets. This theoretically allowed the home viewer (with the properly equipped sound system) to experience a similar effect as in the theater.\n\n==Theme park attractions==\n{{Main|Earthquake: The Big One}}\n''Earthquake'' inspired the attractions ''Earthquake: The Big One'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]] and [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Hollywood]].\n\nThe Hollywood attraction opened in March 1989 as part of the [[Studio Tour]] tram ride.  The tram enters a sound stage, the interior designed to look like a San Francisco underground [[BART]] station, whereupon a two-and-a-half-minute simulation of an 8.3 earthquake takes place, featuring a gas truck falling into the station, a runaway train and a flood.<ref name=\"Gennawey\" />{{efn|The San Francisco and BART setting was owed to the reputed setting of the ''Earthquake'' sequel that never materialized.<ref name=\"Gennawey\" />}}\n\nThe Florida attraction opened in June 1990. It began with an introductory film on the making of ''Earthquake'' with Charlton Heston appearing to explain the special effects, followed by a live demonstration based on the film with audience participation.  The attraction culminated in a simulated 8.3 earthquake aboard an underground train at [[Embarcadero Station]] in San Francisco.<ref name=\"Miller2008\" />{{Dead link|date=October 2016}} In the fall of 2002, the pre-show was changed to a more generic \"magic of making movies\" theme, with slight modifications which included mentioning special effects used in other films besides ''Earthquake''. The Florida attraction officially closed on November 5, 2007, and reopened several months later as \"[[Disaster!|Disaster!: A Major Motion Picture Ride...Starring You!]].\"<ref name=\"Gennawey\" />\n\n==Stock footage==\nMany scenes from the film, especially those featuring the destruction of Los Angeles, have appeared in other productions, often those of Universal Studios itself. Some examples include:\n\n* ''[[Damnation Alley (film)|Damnation Alley]]'': In this 1977 film, the earth shifts from its axis after a full-scale nuclear war.  Flood scenes from the dam burst in ''Earthquake'' are used to help depict the earth returning to its correct axis.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n* ''[[Quantum Leap]]'': The episode \"[[Quantum Leap (season 2)#ep11|Disco Inferno]]\" has [[Sam Beckett]] leaped in as a film stuntman. One of his jobs is on the set of ''Earthquake'', where he is the character seen hanging from a piece of debris whom Sam Royce ([[Lorne Greene]]'s character) attempts to save, but Beckett loses his grip and falls.{{clarify|reason=Which scenes from the movie appear in the episode?|date=February 2015}}\n* ''[[Galactica 1980]]'': In the episode \"[[Galactica Discovers Earth]]\", in a \"computer simulation\" of a devastating [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] attack on Los Angeles, which was in turn shown in the [[Tom Petty]] music video for the song \"[[You Got Lucky]]\".{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n* ''[[V (The Final Battle)|V: The Final Battle]]'': Footage from the sequence featuring the collapse of the Hollywood dam was reused during the destruction of the Visitors water pumping station.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n* [[Barenaked Ladies]] music video for \"[[Another Postcard]]\": Parts of the film, namely when the big earthquake struck, were used.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n* ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'': In the first-season episode \"Earthquakes Happen\", several building collapse scenes, the collapsing freeway overpass scene, the collapsing Spanish bells, the sliding and falling stilt houses, and the collapsing high tension wires and parts of the wooden foot bridge scenes were reused with slightly zoomed or slightly reoriented focus to minimize association with ''Earthquake''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n* ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (1983) has a scene where [[Tony Montana]] is going to buy cocaine from some drug dealers, and the TV set in the motel room shows the scene in this film where the graduate assistant is explaining his earthquake theory to the director of the Seismology Institute.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\nThe purported magnitude of the earthquake in the film (9.9 on the [[Richter Scale]]) would make it the largest ever recorded, eclipsing the record set by the actual [[1960_Valdivia_earthquake|Chilean Earthquake of 1960]] (9.5 on the Richter Scale).  However, such huge earthquakes can only be generated by \"megathrust\" faults or asteroid strikes.  The numerous faults in California, particularly the San Andreas (the fault implied to have generated the titular earthquake in the film), are the \"strike-slip\" type, which historically have rarely produced tremors higher than 8.3 on the Richter Scale in recorded history.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1974]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1=30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"bomojo\">{{cite
