The plot follows four teenagers who encounter Leatherface and his murderous family in backwoods Texas on the night of their [[prom]]. It is the fourth installment in the [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' series]], and also features [[cameo appearance|cameo]] appearances from [[Marilyn Burns]], [[Paul A. Partain]], and [[John Dugan (actor)|John Dugan]], all stars of the original film. Marilyn Burns, who portrays \"Patient on Gurney\", is credited as \"Anonymous\" in the film.\n\nWriter-director Kim Henkel had previously co-written the original ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) with [[Tobe Hooper]]; the events of the previous two sequel films are addressed in ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s opening prologue as \"two minor, yet apparently related incidents\" which happened after the events of the original film. ''Next Generation'' was shot on location in rural areas outside of [[Austin, Texas]].\n\nThe film received a limited release in the United States and Japan in 1995 under its original title ''The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre'', but was not distributed any more widely at the time. Two years later, after Zellweger and McConaughey had both become major [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] stars, the film was re-cut and released on August 29, 1997 under the new title ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation'', but was a critical and financial failure. Though a full soundtrack was never released, a companion single featured in the film performed by star Robert Jacks and [[Debbie Harry]] from [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] was released on compact disc in 1997.\n\nThe next entry in the series was a [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|remake]] of the original film, ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', produced by [[Michael Bay]] with original creators [[Kim Henkel]] and [[Tobe Hooper]] as co-producers. Following this was a [[prequel]] to remake, subtitled ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning|The Beginning]]''. Another entry, ''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'' was released in 2013 as a direct sequel to the original 1974 film. There would be one more installment to the original series, a \"prequel\" of its own, titled ''[[Leatherface (2017 film)|Leatherface]]'' that was released in 2017. The latest installment in the original series is ''[[Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022 film)|Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (released in 2022), which takes place in the same continuity as the original four films.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-02-18 |title=David Blue Garcia Interview: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 |url=https://screenrant.com/texas-chainsaw-massacre-2022-david-blue-garcia-interview/ |access-date=2022-05-13 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn May 22, 1994,{{efn|In the 1997 cut, the date has been changed to May 22, 1996.}} four teenagers\u2014Barry, Heather, Jenny, and Sean\u2014attend their [[Prom|school\u2019s prom]]. When Heather discovers Barry cheating on her with another girl, she storms out of the dance, followed closely by Barry, who tries to explain himself as they drive away in his car. Their argument is interrupted by Jenny and Sean, who are hiding in the backseat, smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Heather takes a detour off the freeway, and while distracted, collides with another motorist, who passes out in the ensuing confusion. Jenny, Heather, and Barry leave Sean to look after the unconscious motorist, while they search for help.\n\nThey stop at an office trailer, where they meet Darla, an [[Insurance|insurance agent]], who promises to call her boyfriend, a tow truck driver named Vilmer. They leave the office and begin heading back towards the wreck, only for Heather and Barry to become separated from Jenny in the darkness. Vilmer soon shows up at the scene of the wreck, killing the motorist, before chasing Sean in his truck and backing over him repeatedly.\n\nMeanwhile, Heather and Barry become separated from Jenny and discover an old farmhouse in the woods. As Barry looks around, Heather is attacked by [[Leatherface]] on the porch swing and subsequently forced into a [[Refrigerator|meat locker]]. One of Vilmer and Leatherface\u2019s family members, W. E., finds Barry and holds him at gunpoint before forcing him inside. Barry tricks W. E. and locks him out but while using the bathroom, Barry discovers a [[Cadaver|corpse]] in the bathtub. He is then killed by Leatherface with a sledgehammer. After killing Barry, Leatherface impales Heather on a meat hook.\n\nJenny returns to the scene of the wreck, where she is met by Vilmer, who offers her a ride. She accepts, only for Vilmer to threaten her, before showing her the bodies of Sean and the motorist. Jenny jumps out of the truck and runs into the woods. She is soon attacked by Leatherface, resulting in a lengthy chase through the farmhouse, where she finds several preserved corpses in an upstairs bedroom.\n\nAfter leaping through an upstairs window, Jenny manages to flee the property. She seeks refuge from Darla, who reveals herself to be in league with the killers when W. E. shows up and beats her with a cattle prod. The two put her in Darla\u2019s trunk and she leaves to pick up some pizzas for dinner. After being tormented by Vilmer, Jenny momentarily escapes, attempting to drive off in Darla\u2019s car. She is stopped by Vilmer, who knocks her unconscious. She soon awakens at a dinner table, surrounded by the family, who reveal they are employed by a [[secret society]] to terrorize people that may cross their path. A man named Rothman shows up, reprimanding Vilmer for his methods, before revealing an array of scars and piercings on his [[torso]] and licking Jenny\u2019s face. Rothman leaves and Vilmer terrorizes his family and Jenny, killing Heather by crushing her [[skull]] under his cybernetic leg, and knocking W. E. unconscious with a hammer.\n\nVilmer and Leatherface prepare to kill Jenny, who breaks free and, using the control to Vilmer\u2019s leg, escapes. Jenny reaches a dirt road, where she is rescued by an elderly couple in an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]]. However, Leatherface and Vilmer run them off the road, resulting in the RV falling on its side. Jenny emerges from the vehicle unscathed and continues running, with Leatherface and Vilmer in hot pursuit. A plane swoops down on Vilmer, killing him when one of the wheels grazes his skull. Leatherface screams in anguish, while Jenny looks on. A [[limousine]] pulls up and Jenny jumps in the backseat, where she is met by Rothman, who apologizes, explaining her experience was supposed to be [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and Vilmer had to be stopped. He offers to take her to a police station or a hospital, dropping her off at a hospital, where she speaks to an officer. [[Sally Hardesty]], being pushed by on a gurney, meets Jenny\u2019s gaze. Back on the dirt road as the sun sets Leatherface continues to flail his chainsaw in despair.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Jenny\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Vilmer\n* Robert Jacks as [[Leatherface]] \n* Tonie Perensky as Darla\n* [[Lisa Marie Newmyer]] as Heather\n* Joe Stevens as Walter Edward\n* John Harrison as Sean\n* Tyler Cone as Barry \n* James Gale as Rothman\n* [[Debra Marshall]] as Cop in Bud's Pizza\n* [[John Dugan (actor)|John Dugan]] as Cop at Hospital\n* [[Paul A.

The family, no longer backwater cannibals, dines on pizza instead of the fresh meat of their victims. The dinner sequence, originally one of the most effective and horrifying scenes ever committed to film, goes so far off the rails it climaxes with Jenny turning the tables on her captors and scolding Leatherface into sitting down and shutting up. The ineffectiveness of it all of this is intentional, and we know this because a man in a limo pulls up and openly acknowledges it.\"<ref name=yandell/>}}\n\n===Cross-dressing of Leatherface===\nAnother element noted by both critics and film scholars is the film's overt references to [[cross-dressing]] in the Leatherface character, which was briefly explored in the original film but implemented to a greater extent. Robert Wilonsky of the ''[[Houston Press]]'' commented on the film's treatment of the character, writing that the film \"turns Leatherface (here played by Robbie Jacks, an Austin songwriter who used to host a smacked-up radio show with [[Butthole Surfers|Butthole Surfer]] [[Gibby Haynes]]) into a cross-dressing nancy boy who screams more than he saws.\"<ref name=wilonsky/> According to Henkel, he wrote the character as one who assumes the persona of the person whose face he wears: \"The confused sexuality of the Leatherface character is complex and horrifying at the same time,\" he said in a 1996 interview.{{sfn|Huberman|1996|loc=event occurs at 25:41}} Film scholar Scott Von Doviak also took note of this, likening Leatherface's presentation in the film to that of a \"tortured drag queen.\"{{sfn|Von Doviak|2012|p=174}}\n\n===Director's Cut===\nThe original cut of the film by director Kim Henkel is approximately 7 minutes longer than the final released version. The original edit of the film has some slightly longer shots of violence and character reactions but the most significant omission in the theatrically released version was the deletion of Jenny's backstory at the beginning of the film. In the original cut, the relationship between Jenny and her stepfather (played by David Laurence) is shown to be fraught, with elements of domestic abuse and molestation shown as she is subjected to his violent outbursts. This later helps to explain why Jenny is not particularly phased when being tortured by Leatherface's family and how she has the strength to fight back against Vilmer when he touches her.\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=May 2022}}\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n |align = right\n | width1 = 146\n | image1 = Matthew McConaughey 2011.jpg\n | width2 = 137\n | image2 = Judy 01 (48816507828).jpg\n | footer = The film marked the first major screen roles of Texas-born actors [[Matthew McConaughey]] and [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]]\n}}\n\n===Development===\nIn developing the film, Robert Kuhn stated: {{blockquote|I wanted to go back to the original, and [Kim] did, too. We agreed on that right off. And the first major thing was getting him to write the script. I raised the money to get it written, and for us to start trying to put this thing together. Then we went out to the American Film Market in LA and talked to a bunch of people about financing. At that point I'd raised some money, but not nearly enough to make the film, and we looked at the possibilities of making a deal with a distributor. But I knew there wasn't any hope of us making one we could live with. There never is. Kim would say, 'Hey, so-and-so is interested, and it might be a deal we can live with.' So we'd talk to 'em and I'd ask three or four hard questions, and I'd just kind of look over at Kim and he'd say 'Yeah.' Then I'd go back and start trying to raise some more money. I just started going to everybody I knew and I got it in bits and pieces, wherever I could.<ref name=\"fang\" />}}\n\nIn a 1996-released documentary on the making of the film, Henkel stated that he wrote the characters as exaggerated \"cartoonish\" caricatures of quintessential American youth.{{sfn|Huberman|1996|loc=event occurs at 9:04}} Henkel cited the murder cases of serial killers [[Ed Gein]] and [[Elmer Wayne Henley]] as influences on his involvement in both ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation'' and the original ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre''.{{sfn|Huberman|1996|loc=event occurs at 17:00}} Henkel also deliberately wrote themes of female empowerment into the script, specifically in the Jenny character: \"It's her story. It's about her transformation, her refusal to shut up, to be silenced, to be victimized. And by extension her refusal to be oppressed. Even by culture... Bringing Jenny into a world in which the culture was grotesquely exaggerated was a way of bringing her to see her own world more clearly \u2013 that is to say, my intent was to present a nightmarish version of Jenny's world in the form of the Chainsaw family in order to enlarge her view of her own world.\"<ref name=squires/>\n\n===Filming===\nThe movie was filmed on location at an abandoned farmhouse in [[Pflugerville, Texas]], and nearby [[Bastrop, Texas|Bastrop]].<ref name=\"fang\">{{Cite journal|journal=[[Fangoria]]|title=Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Cuts Deep|date=September 1994|author=Wooley, John|issue=136}}</ref> The majority of the cast and crew were locals from Austin, aside from James Gale, a stage actor from Houston.<ref name=\"fang\" /> Most of the filming took place at night, and was described by makeup artist J.M.

So, you know, makeup was in the front seats and there was a table in the middle for hair, and there was a tiny little curtain by the bathroom.
