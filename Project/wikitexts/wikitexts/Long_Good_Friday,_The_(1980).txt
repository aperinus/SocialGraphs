Set in [[London]], the storyline weaves together events and concerns of the late 1970s, including mid-level [[political corruption|political]] and [[police corruption]], and [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] fund-raising. The supporting cast features [[Eddie Constantine]], [[Dave King (actor)|Dave King]], [[Bryan Marshall]], [[Derek Thompson (actor)|Derek Thompson]], [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]] in his film debut. \n\nThe film was completed in 1979,<ref name=\"BFI\">Mark Duguid [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/480130/index.html \"''Long Good Friday, The'' (1979)\"], BFI Screenonline</ref> but because of release delays, it is generally credited as an \u201880s film. It received positive reviews from critics, and Bob Hoskins was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]] and won a [[Evening Standard British Film Awards|Evening Standard Film Award]] for his performance as gangster Harold Shand. It was voted at number 21 in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of the \"[[BFI Top 100 British films]]\" list, and provided Hoskins with his breakthrough film role. In 2016, British film magazine ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' ranked ''The Long Good Friday'' number 19 in their list of \"The 100 best British films\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|title=The 100 best British films | url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/100britishfilms/|agency=Empire|date=29 November 2017}}</ref> \n\n==Plot==\nA man delivers money to an unknown recipient in [[Belfast]], in the process taking some of the cash for himself. As the recipients are counting the money in a country farm house they are attacked by uniformed gunmen. Soon afterwards Phil, the driver for the delivery, is [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and killed. Later the delivery man, Colin, is murdered at a London swimming pool.\n\nHarold Shand, a [[London]] gangster, is aspiring to become a legitimate businessman and is trying to form a partnership with Charlie, an [[American Mafia|American mafioso]], with a plan to redevelop [[London Docklands]], in association with local construction boss [[Councillor]] Harris. Shand's world is suddenly destabilised by a series of bomb attacks on his property and murders of his associates, including his old friend Colin. He and his henchmen try to uncover his attackers' identities by threatening corrupt police officers, informers, and other criminals, whilst simultaneously trying not to worry their visitors, fearing the Americans will abandon him if they think he's not in full control. Shand's girlfriend, Victoria, tells the Mafia representatives he is under attack from an unknown enemy, but assures them Shand is working to quickly resolve the crisis. She starts to suspect Shand's right hand man, Jeff, knows more about who is behind the attacks than he claims.\n\nAfter some investigation, Shand confronts Jeff, who confesses that under pressure from Councillor Harris he sent Colin and Phil to Belfast to deliver money to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) on behalf of Harris. He explains that three of the IRA's top men were killed on the same night, after the money was delivered. Shand realises the IRA have come to the conclusion that he sold them out to the security forces and pocketed the missing cash for himself, and are targeting his organisation in revenge. Vowing to destroy the terrorist organisation in London, Shand loses his temper and kills Jeff in a frenzy.\n\nAfter confronting Harris, Shand sets up a meeting with the IRA's London leadership at a [[stock car]] racetrack. He ostensibly offers them \u00a360,000 in return for a ceasefire but [[double cross (betrayal)|double cross]]es them and has them and Harris shot as they are counting the cash. Believing his enemies are dead and the problem solved, Shand travels to the [[Savoy Hotel]] to triumphantly inform Charlie and his assistant Tony, only to find the Americans preparing to leave, having been spooked by the carnage. In response to their derisory comments about the UK, Shand berates them for their arrogance and dismisses them as cowards.\n\nLeaving the hotel, Shand steps into his chauffeur-driven car only to find it has been commandeered by IRA assassins. He sees Victoria being also kidnapped in another car. As the car speeds to an unknown destination, Shand contemplates the inevitability of his fate.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as Harold Shand\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Victoria\n* [[Dave King (actor)|Dave King]] as Parky\n* [[Bryan Marshall]] as Councillor Harris\n* [[Derek Thompson (actor)|Derek Thompson]] as Jeff\n* [[Eddie Constantine]] as Charlie\n* [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]] as Colin\n* [[P.

Euston did not make the film, but Hanson bought the rights from Euston for his own company Calendar Films.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> Although Hanson designed the film for the cinema and all contracts were negotiated under a film, not a TV agreement, the production was eventually financed by Black Lion, a subsidiary of [[Lew Grade]]'s [[ITC Entertainment]] for transmission via Grade's [[Associated Television|ATV]] on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] Network.<ref name=\"ScreenInt\"/> The film was commissioned by [[Charles Denton (television and film producer)|Charles Denton]], at the time both Programme Controller of ATV and Managing Director of Black Lion.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> After Grade saw the finished film, he allegedly objected to what he saw as the glorification of the IRA.<ref name=\"BFI\"/>\n\nThe film was scheduled to be televised with heavy cuts on 24 March 1981.<ref name=\"ScreenInt\"/> Because of the planned cuts, in late 1980, Hanson attempted to buy the film back from ITC to prevent ITV screening the film.

In 1981, it was reported at that Hoskins was suing both Black Lion and Calendar Films to prevent their planned release of a US TV version in which Hoskins' voice would be dubbed by [[English Midlands]] actor [[David Daker]].<ref name=\"ScreenInt\" /> Ultimately, Hoskins' voice was not dubbed.\n\n''The Long Good Friday'' was the film debut of [[Pierce Brosnan]], then 25-years old.
