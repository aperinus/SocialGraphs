It was praised for its visuals, screenplay, themes, music, and voice acting; some film critics consider ''Frozen'' to be Disney's best animated film since the [[Disney Renaissance|studio's renaissance era]]. ''Frozen'' received two awards at the [[86th Academy Awards]], and [[List of accolades received by Frozen (2013 film)|numerous other accolades]].\n\nDuring its theatrical run, the film was a significant commercial success, earning $1.280 billion in worldwide box office revenue, overtaking ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' to become the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film of all time]], and carried its position until it was overtaken by [[The Lion King (2019 film)|the remake of ''The Lion King'']] in 2019.

After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna but alters her memories so that she forgets about Elsa's magic. Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that she must learn to control her powers and that fear will be her greatest enemy. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle, closing the castle gates to their subjects. To protect her sister from her increasingly unpredictable powers, Elsa ceases all contact with Anna, creating a rift between them. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents are killed at sea during a storm.\n\nFollowing her 21st birthday, Elsa is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is afraid that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Among them are the scheming Duke of Weselton and the handsome [[Hans (Frozen)|Prince Hans]] of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls in love at first sight. Elsa's [[coronation]] takes place without incident, but she remains distant from Anna. Anna and Hans develop a romantic connection during the coronation festivities, and he impulsively proposes to her, but Elsa objects when they seek her blessing. Hurt and confused, Anna protests, begging Elsa to explain her fear and isolation. The emotional strain causes Elsa to accidentally unleash her powers before the court. Branded a monster by the Duke, Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she finally acknowledges her powers, building an ice palace to live a hermit life. In the process, her magic unintentionally engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.\n\nAnna ventures out to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command. She gets lost, collecting supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop. She meets an iceman named [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] and his [[reindeer]], [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]], convincing them to take her to the mountains. An attack by wolves leads to Kristoff's sleigh being destroyed. Forced to continuing the journey on foot, Anna and Kristoff meet [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a talking snowman unknowingly created by Elsa, who offers to guide them to her. When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle without her, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.\n\nReaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa. When Anna reveals what has become of Arendelle, a horrified Elsa confesses she does not know how to undo her magic. Her fear causes her powers to manifest themselves once more, and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart, seriously injuring her. In desperation to keep Anna safe, Elsa creates a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff and Olaf away. Realizing the effects of Elsa's spell on Anna, Kristoff takes her to the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless \"an act of true love\" reverses the spell.\n\nKristoff and Olaf race Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace; defeating Marshmallow (who falls into a chasm) and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals his dastardly plot to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks a heartbroken Anna in a room to die and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her, but not before they were married. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell. Anna is freed by Olaf, and they venture into the [[blizzard]] outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf has revealed is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down and abruptly stop the storm. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who thaws out, her heroism constituting \"an act of true love\".\n\nRealizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives a small flurry cloud to Olaf to experience warm. Hans is arrested and exiled from the kingdom for his treason and attempted assassination, while the Duke's trade links with Arendelle are cut off. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh and the two kiss. The sisters are reunited, and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Marshmallow, having survived the fall, finds Elsa's discarded crown and places it on top of its head.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n<!--Do not add voice actors without reliable sources or they will be removed -->\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2/3|total_width=320\n| image1 = Kristen Bell Frozen premiere 2013 (cropped).jpg|width1=2466|height1=2952\n| image2 = Idina Menzel Defense.gov Crop.png|width2=633|height2=829\n| image3 = Jonathan Groff at Outfest 2013.jpg|width3=2072|height3=2745\n| image4 = 41st Annie Awards, Josh Gad (crop).jpg|width4=3005|height4=4039\n| footer = Top row (L\u2013R): [[Kristen Bell]], [[Idina Menzel]]<br />Bottom row (L\u2013R): [[Jonathan Groff]], [[Josh Gad]]\n}}\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], the 18-year-old{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=13}} Princess of Arendelle and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=\"Geeks\">{{cite news |last=Nachman |first=Brett |title=Disney In Depth: The Future Of Disney Animation (Frozen, Paperman, & Wreck-It Ralph)&nbsp;\u2013 A Recap Of D23's Destination D Event |url=http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/08/16/disney-in-depth-the-future-of-disney-animation-frozen-paperman-wreck-it-ralph-a-recap-of-d23s-destination-d-event/ |access-date=August 17, 2012 |newspaper=Geeks of Doom |date=August 16, 2012}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=Geeks of doom is a hobby site and the author of the sourced article is a journalism student.

For us the breakthrough came when we tried to give really human qualities to the Snow Queen. When we decided to make the Snow Queen Elsa and our protagonist Anna sisters, that gave a way to relate to the characters in a way that conveyed what each was going through and that would relate for today's audiences. This film has a lot of complicated characters and complicated relationships in it. There are times when Elsa does villainous things but because you understand where it comes from, from this desire to defend herself, you can always relate to her. 'Inspired by' means exactly that. There is snow and there is ice and there is a Queen, but other than that, we depart from it quite a bit. We do try to bring scope and the scale that you would expect but do it in a way that we can understand the characters and relate to them.\"\n|source=\u2013&nbsp;Producer [[Peter Del Vecho]], on the difficulties adapting ''The Snow Queen''<ref name=\"Connelly\">{{cite web |last=Connelly |first=Brendon |title=Inside The Research, Design, And Animation Of Walt Disney's Frozen With Producer Peter Del Vecho |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/09/25/inside-the-research-design-and-animation-of-walt-disneys-frozen-with-producer-peter-del-vecho/ |work=Bleeding Cool |access-date=October 22, 2013 |date=September 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013234112/http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/09/25/inside-the-research-design-and-animation-of-walt-disneys-frozen-with-producer-peter-del-vecho/ |archive-date=October 13, 2013 }}</ref>\n|width=40%|align=left}}\n\nIn the late 1990s,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Mark|title=Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee interview: on making Frozen|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/frozen/28495/chris-buck-and-jennifer-lee-interview-on-making-frozen|date=December 6, 2013|work=Den of Geek!|publisher=Dennis Publishing|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref> Walt Disney Feature Animation started developing a new adaptation of ''The Snow Queen'' after the tremendous success of their recent films during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era (1989\u20131999), but the project was scrapped completely in late 2002, when [[Glen Keane]] reportedly quit the project<ref name=\"sf\">{{cite news |last=Fischer |first=Russ |title=Disney's \"Frozen\", Formerly \"The Snow Queen\", Will Be CG Rather Than Hand-Drawn |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/disneys-frozen-the-snow-queen-cg-handdrawn/ |access-date=January 12, 2012 |newspaper=Slash Film |date=January 11, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/2013.01.05-043849/http://www.slashfilm.com/disneys-frozen-the-snow-queen-cg-handdrawn/ |archive-date=January 5, 2013 }}</ref> and went on to work on another project which became ''[[Tangled]]'' (2010).

From a design perspective, since I was stressing the horizontal and vertical aspects, and what the fjords provide, it was perfect. We encased the sibling story in scale.\" [[Ted D. McCord|Ted D.

We found the perfect match in [[Takako Matsu]] and [[Sayaka Kanda]], and they really added a whole new dimension to the storytelling.\"<ref name=\"wsjapr17\" />\n\nWhen asked about the success of ''Frozen'', director Chris Buck stated: \"We never expected anything like this. We just hoped to make a movie that did as well as ''Tangled''! I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it, but there's no way we could have predicted this.\"<ref name=\"buckapr8\" /> He cited a number of reasons for the film's popularity: \"There are characters that people relate to; the songs are so strong and memorable. We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen[nifer Lee] and I like to do&nbsp;\u2013 we essentially create two imperfect princesses.\"<ref name=\"buckapr8\" /> As ''Frozen'' approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: \"It's just a remarkable thing.
