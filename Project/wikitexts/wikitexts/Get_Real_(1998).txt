The plot centres the coming of age of a gay teen while growing up in rural Britain during the [[Cool Britannia]] era of the late 1990s. The film was shot and set in and around [[Basingstoke]], England. ''Get Real'' has since become a cult classic among fans of queer cinema.\n\n==Plot==\nSteven Carter ([[Ben Silverstone]]) is a 16-year-old middle-class schoolboy who is intelligent and good-looking, but un-athletic and introverted. Bullied at school and misunderstood at home, his only confidante is his neighbor and best friend, Linda (Charlotte Brittain). Keeping his sexual orientation hidden from everyone else, he [[Cruising for sex|cruises]] in public toilets. He is surprised to find the school jock, John Dixon (Brad Gorton) also cruising, but John denies that he is gay.\n\nAt a school dance, Steven gains a friend after he comforts Jessica (Stacy Hart), following her argument with her boyfriend, Kevin (Tim Harris), who is also his bully. When he returns home, John follows him and confides about his own sexual orientation. They start a relationship.\n\nWord around the school spreads about someone being gay, and John fears that Steven has been telling people. In order to maintain his status, John beats up Steven in front of his friends. Steven announces in front of assembly that he is gay, and looks to John for support, who ignores him. John apologizes for beating him up and says he loves him, but as he is too afraid to [[coming out|come out]], Steven breaks up with him, wishing him happiness.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Silverstone]] as Steven Carter\n* Brad Gorton as John Dixon\n* Charlotte Brittain as Linda\n* [[Jacquetta May]] as Steven's Mother\n* David Lumsden as Steven's Father\n* [[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]] as English Teacher\n* Martin Milman as Headmaster\n* Stacy Hart as Jessica\n* Kate McEnery as Wendy\n* Patrick Nielsen as Mark\n* Tim Harris as Kevin Grainger\n* James D.
