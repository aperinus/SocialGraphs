The screenplay was loosely based on the contemporary [[Whit Masterson]] novel ''[[Badge of Evil]]'' (1956). The cast included [[Charlton Heston]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Joseph Calleia]], [[Akim Tamiroff]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]].\n\n[[Universal Pictures|Universal-International]] commissioned the film adaptation of the novel in April 1956. [[Albert Zugsmith]] was selected as producer, who then hired television writer [[Paul Monash]] to write the script. [[Charlton Heston]] was brought onboard to star in January 1957 and suggested that [[Orson Welles]] direct the project. Welles was hired to direct and star, as well as re-write the script. Filming started the next month and [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in April. During the film's post-production, creative differences between Welles and Universal executives arose and Welles was forced off the film. Subsequently, Universal-International revised the film's editing style to be more conventional and ordered re-shoots to be made in November 1957. In response to the new version, Welles wrote a 58-page memo in which he elaborately outlined his creative vision for the film and asked that his version be restored.\n\nInitially dismissed by film critics, ''Touch of Evil'' found popularity among European audiences and won top awards at the 1958 Brussels World Film Festival.

On his honeymoon with his American wife Susie, Mexican special prosecutor Miguel Vargas takes an interest in the investigation. Local authorities arrive on the scene, followed by 30-year police captain Hank Quinlan and his longtime assistant, Pete Menzies. Quinlan and Menzies implicate Sanchez, a young Mexican secretly married to the victim's daughter, Marcia, as the prime suspect. During the interrogation at Sanchez's apartment, Menzies locates two sticks of [[dynamite]] in the same shoebox that Vargas had found empty only a few minutes earlier. Vargas accuses Quinlan of planting evidence, and begins to suspect that he may have been doing so for years to help win convictions. Quinlan dismisses Vargas's claim, saying he is just biased in favor of fellow Mexicans.\n\nThe stress of these accusations, along with pressure from \"Uncle\" Joe Grandi, the brother of a man Vargas has been investigating, to strike a deal to discredit Vargas, causes Quinlan\u2014who has been sober for 12 years\u2014to relapse. With assistance from the District Attorney's Assistant Al Schwartz, Vargas studies the public records on Quinlan's cases, revealing his findings to Gould and Adair. Quinlan arrives in time to overhear the discussion and angrily threatens to resign.\n\n[[File:Touch of Evil-Janet Leigh&Charlton Heston2.JPG|thumb|Janet Leigh and Charlton Heston]]\n\nMeanwhile, Vargas sends his wife to a remote motel to remove her from the Grandis' unwanted attention. Unknown to him, the hotel is owned by Grandi. Grandi's family members terrorize Susie. Vargas becomes concerned when his attempts to telephone his wife at the motel are blocked. Per their agreement, Grandi arranges for Susie to appear unconscious from a drug overdose in a downtown motel, set up for Quinlan to \"discover\" her. Instead, Quinlan strangles Grandi there and leaves his corpse with Susie. When she wakes up, she screams for help but instead is arrested on suspicion of murder.\n\n[[File:Touch-of-Evil-Orson-Welles.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Orson Welles as Hank Quinlan]]\n\nVargas confronts Menzies about Quinlan's history of \"discovering\" incriminating evidence  in his cases. He goes to Susie's motel but cannot find her, discovering both that the motel is owned by Grandi and that his handgun has been stolen. He rushes back to town and enters a bar, where he confronts the gang members who attacked his wife. When they refuse to answer his questions, Vargas attacks them but is overwhelmed.\n\nSchwartz informs Vargas that Susie has been arrested for murder. At the lockup, Menzies reveals to Vargas that he discovered Quinlan's cane at the murder scene, implicating him. Menzies agrees to wear a [[Covert listening device|wire]] for Vargas. Quinlan is at ex-lover Tana's brothel across the border. A loud [[player piano]] prevents recording, so Menzies lures Quinlan out. While they walk Vargas trails them, recording their conversation.\n\nQuinlan confesses to Menzies that he planted evidence on suspects, but just the \"guilty\" ones. Quinlan hears an echo from Vargas' tracking device and suspects Menzies of betrayal. Quinlan demands that Vargas show himself and then shoots Menzies. Just as Quinlan is prepared to shoot the unarmed Vargas, claiming he'll plead self-defense, Menzies shoots Quinlan, then expires. Schwartz arrives at the scene and tells Vargas that Sanchez had confessed to the crime, vindicating Quinlan. Vargas is reunited with Susie. Tana arrives and rues Quinlan's death.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|* [[Charlton Heston]] as Ramon Miguel Vargas\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as Susan Vargas\n* [[Orson Welles]] as Police Captain Hank Quinlan\n* [[Joseph Calleia]] as Sgt.

According to Zugsmith, the two had creative differences,<ref name=\"Zurgsmith\" /> and Curtiss was replaced with [[Virgil Vogel]].{{sfn|Brady|1989|page=503}} During June 1957, Welles flew out to New York to appear on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''. In his absence, studio executives had scheduled a screening of the rough cut. Informed of this by Vogel, Welles was angered, resulting in Universal post-production head Ernest Nims cancelling the screening. At this point, Vogel agreed to step down, and Nims appointed [[Aaron Stell]], another Universal staff editor, to finish the film. When Welles returned to Hollywood, Nims instructed him to stay out of the editing room and let Stell work alone.{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pages=426\u2013427}} Having been locked out, Welles went to [[Mexico City]] in late June 1957 to begin shooting his next film, ''[[Don Quixote (unfinished film)|Don Quixote]]''.{{sfn|Bogdanovich|Welles|1998|page=422}}\n\nOn his own, Stell constantly changed the editing sequence, providing different interpretations of multiple scenes in which he altered the continuity. Throughout the editing process, Stell was never satisfied, and at the end of his tenure, he stated he had grown \"ill, depressed and unhappy with the studio's impatience.\"{{sfn|Garis|2004|pages=150\u2013151}} In July 1957, Stell's cut was screened to the executives, most of whom were left unimpressed.{{sfn|Callow|2015|page=261}} According to Nims, Welles \"had really messed up those first five reels...He was making those quick cuts\u2014in the middle of a scene you cut to another scene, and then come back and finish the scene, and then cut to the last half of the other scene.\"{{sfn|Leaming|1985|page=428}}\n\nHoping to make the continuity editing more conventional, Muhl appointed Nims to re-edit the film. A month later, Nims's cut was shown to Welles, who remained diplomatic but was astonished at the newly altered cut. Welles wrote a memorandum as a critique to Nim's revisions, and shortly after, he left for [[Louisiana]] to appear in [[Martin Ritt]]'s ''[[The Long, Hot Summer]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Leaming|1985|pages=428\u2013429}} By November 1957, Universal removed about fifteen minutes from the film, and hired [[Harry Keller]] to film some expository scenes intended to make the plot easier to follow.{{sfn|Thomson|1996|page=346}}\n\nOut of loyalty to Welles, Heston and Leigh initially refused to film the re-shoots.{{sfn|Leaming|1985|page=430}}{{sfn|Leigh|1984|page=218}} A week later, Heston's agents informed him that he was contractually obligated to film re-shoots if necessary.{{sfn|Heston|1979|pages=[https://archive.org/details/actorslifecharlt00alpe/page/34/mode/2up 34\u201335]}} For the re-shoots, [[Clifford Stine]] had replaced Metty as the film's cinematographer while new dialogue had been written by Franklin Coen, a staff scriptwriter for Universal. Several new scenes were filmed including four scenes between Vargas and his wife, a love scene in the car, and a scene where Menzies explains about Quinlan's leg. Another scene was shot in which Quinlan's car meets Vargas's en route to the motel, in which an uncredited actor doubles for Welles.{{sfn|Brady|1989|pages=507\u2013508}} On November 19, re-shoots under Keller were completed. Heston further reflected in his journal: \"I have done worse work in the movies than this day's retakes, but I don't remember feeling worse...I was able to talk them out of one change I felt was a mistake.\"{{sfn|Heston|1979|pages=[https://archive.org/details/actorslifecharlt00alpe/page/34/mode/2up 34\u201335]}}\n\nOn December 5, 1957, having been screened a new cut, Welles presented a 58-page memorandum addressed to Muhl, detailing what he thought needed to be done to make the film work.{{sfn|Callow|2015|page=270}} In response, Muhl stated his changes would be implemented, but also requested that Welles attend a dubbing session.
