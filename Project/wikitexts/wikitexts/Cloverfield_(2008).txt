J. Abrams]], and written by [[Drew Goddard]]. It stars [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Jessica Lucas]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Michael Stahl-David]], [[Mike Vogel]] and [[Odette Yustman]].<!--- per poster billing block, matches closing tombstone stand-alone credits ---> The plot follows six young [[New York City]] residents fleeing from [[Clover (creature)|a massive monster]] and various other smaller creatures that attack the city during a farewell party.\n\nDevelopment began when producer [[J. J. Abrams]] started conceptualizing a new monster and enlisted [[Neville Page]] to design the creature, called [[Clover (creature)|Clover]]. In February 2007, the project was secretly [[greenlit]] by [[Paramount Pictures]] and produced by Abrams's [[Bad Robot Productions]]. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Los Angeles]] and New York City in 2007. The project had several working titles, including ''Slusho'', ''Cheese'', and ''Greyshot''. As part of a [[viral marketing]] campaign, a teaser trailer was released ahead of screenings of ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' (2007) without a title. The final title was revealed in a second teaser trailer attached to screenings of ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' (2007). With limited pre-release details, it garnered online speculation, including forums and websites dedicated to uncovering hidden information about the film. Several tie-ins, including a [[prequel]] [[manga]] series, were released as part of the marketing campaign.\n\n''Cloverfield'' was released on January 18, 2008, and received positive reviews from critics, who praised Reeves's direction and the [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] style narrative. It earned $172 million worldwide at the box office against a $25 million budget. It is the first installment of the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' franchise]], followed by ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'' in 2016 and ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'' in 2018. A direct sequel is in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe film is presented as [[Found footage (film technique)|footage]] from a personal camcorder recovered by the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the area \"formerly known as [[Central Park]]\", bearing a disclaimer stating multiple sightings of a case designated ''Cloverfield''.\n\nThis earlier footage, from April 27, shows Robert \"Rob\" Hawkins waking up with Elizabeth \"Beth\" McIntyre in her father's apartment above [[Columbus Circle]] before sharing a special day across New York City and [[Coney Island]]. Fragments of this overwritten footage appear during the course of the film.\n\nRob has a farewell party on May 22, thrown by his brother Jason and Jason's girlfriend Lily, celebrating Rob's new job as vice-president for a company in [[Japan]]. Jason gets Rob\u2019s best friend Hudson \"Hud\" Platt to film testimonials for Rob during the party. Beth, who Rob has now broken up with, brings a new man to the party. Beth and Rob argue over her guest, and Beth leaves shortly before a massive [[earthquake]] occurs, causing a brief citywide [[power outage]]; the [[local news]] reports a capsized [[oil tanker]] near [[Liberty Island]]. From the roof, the party-goers witness an explosion in the distance and flee as flaming debris flies in their direction.\n\nAs the party-goers leave the building, the severed head of the [[Statue of Liberty]] is hurled into the street in front of them. In the chaos, Hud records [[Clover (creature)|an enormous creature]] several blocks away collapsing the [[Woolworth Building]]. During the group's planned evacuation of Manhattan, the creature's tail destroys the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], killing Jason and dozens of other people. News reports show the [[Army National Guard]]'s [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] attacking the monster. Smaller [[parasite]] creatures fall off its body and attack nearby pedestrians and soldiers.\n\nRob listens to a phone message from Beth, in which she indicates she is trapped in her apartment at the [[Time Warner Center]] and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Hud\u2019s crush, Marlena Diamond, venture into [[Midtown Manhattan]] to rescue Beth. By 3:17&nbsp;a.m., they get caught in a battle between the creature and the Army National Guard, run into the subway, and are attacked by several of the parasites. While saving Hud, Marlena is bitten by one of the creatures. The four escape the subway and enter a below ground mall where she begins to feel unwell. They are found by military and taken to a [[command center]] and [[field hospital]] nearby. In reaction to being bitten, Marlena begins bleeding from her eyes. She is forcibly taken into a tent, where she appears to explode. Rob, still intending on saving Beth, persuades one of the military leaders to let them go. He is then informed when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its \"Hammer Down Protocol\", which will destroy [[Manhattan]] in its entirety in order to kill the monster.\n\nThey travel to Beth's apartment building to discover it toppled on its side. After crossing roofs from the opposite building, the group finds her impaled on exposed [[rebar]]. They free her and make their way to the evacuation site at [[Grand Central Terminal]], where they encounter the creature again. Lily is first rushed into a departing [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] helicopter to escape before the terminal is destroyed. Moments later, Rob, Beth, and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness the creature being bombed. The bombing causes the creature to fall and success is assumed, but then it lunges out of the smoke, hitting the helicopter and causing it to crash in Central Park, killing the pilot and everyone inside except Rob, Beth, and Hud.\n\nLess than an hour later, a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warns that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in fifteen minutes. The three friends regain consciousness, and attempt to flee; Hud turns back to retrieve the camera when the creature suddenly appears and kills him. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under an arch as [[air raid sirens|sirens]] blare, and the bombing starts. Rob and Beth each provide their last testimony of the day's events. The bridge begins to crumble, and the camera is knocked out of Rob's hand and buried beneath rubble. Rob and Beth proclaim their love for each other just as the bomb explodes, the camera freezing up before the footage cuts.\n\nThe film ends with the finale of Rob and Beth's trip to Coney Island on a Ferris wheel. Unseen by them, an indiscernible object falls from the sky into the ocean. Just before the camera cuts out, Beth states, \"I had a good day.\"\n\nAfter the credits, a voice can be heard saying, \"Help us...\" When [[backmasking|played in reverse]], it says, \"It's still alive.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|List of Cloverfield characters}}\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles (same order) per closing credits scroll -->\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Marlena, a fellow partygoer and Hud's crush\n* [[Jessica Lucas]] as Lily, Jason's fianc\u00e9\n* [[T.J.

Some scenes were also written specifically for the audition process, not intended for use in the film.

The limited steel-book edition is only available from [[HMV]], while [[Play.com]] offers exclusive cover artwork. The HMV-exclusive steel-book contains two discs.\n\nThe DVD includes two [[alternative ending]]s, which vary only slightly. The first alternative ending shows Rob and Beth exiting the [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue]] station instead of on the Ferris wheel and features different sirens in the background as Rob talks to the camera. In the second alternative ending, just after the final explosion, Beth can be heard screaming \"Rob!\", followed by a very brief clip of an unknown person looking at the camera (in the commentary, Reeves said that it was one of the crew members) and brushing rubble off the lens. The film then ends with the original final clip of Rob and Beth on their [[Coney Island]] date recording themselves on the Ferris Wheel as the camera tape runs out, with two differences: there is no [[timestamp]] in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, and there is an additional beeping tone indicating the end of the tape.<ref>{{cite video |title=Cloverfield Special Features&nbsp;\u2013 Alternative Endings |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |date=April 2008}}</ref>\n\nA [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] edition was released on June 3, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/releasedates.html |title=Blu-ray Disc Release Dates {{!}} High Def Digest |access-date=June 11, 2009}}</ref> It includes a \"Special Investigation Mode,\" as well as all the bonus features of the 2-disc DVD in HD.\n\nOn the film's 10th anniversary, Paramount issued a 4k [[UHD Blu-ray]] version of the film, accompanied by the standard Blu-ray and bonus extras, it was released on January 23, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultrahd.highdefdigest.com/54168/cloverfield4kultrahdbluray.html |title=Cloverfield - 4k Ultra HD Blu-Ray {{!}} High Def Digest |date=January 22, 2018 |access-date= May 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Cloverfield'' opened in 3,411 theaters on January 18, 2008, and grossed a total of $16,930,000 on its opening day in the United States and Canada.

This may have been either the satellite owned by the fictional Japanese media company, Tagruato, or the creature itself. A company news piece on the Tagruato website mentions that a piece of the Japanese Government's ChimpanzII satellite fell off into the Atlantic. Producers Bryan Burk and J. J.
