The film stars [[Jean Reno]], [[Michel Muller]] and [[Ry\u014dko Hirosue]]. In France, it was released as '''''Wasabi, la petite moutarde qui monte au nez''''' (''\"Wasabi, the little mustard that gets right up your nose\"'').\n\nThe film gets its title from a scene where the protagonist, Hubert Fiorentini (Reno), eats a whole serving of [[wasabi]] at a Japanese restaurant without flinching.\n\n==Plot==\nA woman (later revealed to be a transvestite), dancing provocatively to the enjoyment of other nightclub patrons, is abruptly hit in the face by Hubert Florentini (Reno), a commisaire of the French Police. Florentini drags her out of the club in handcuffs, assaulting other patrons who come too close to free the captive woman or attempt to hinder his exit. Unfortunately, one of these patrons includes the chief's son.\n\nFlorentini is chastised for the violent and unorthodox methods that he uses to accomplish his goals and is put on paid leave from the force. Despite his success and his seemingly enjoyable lifestyle of fighting crime, playing golf, and being the object of a beautiful woman's (Bouquet's) attentions, he has been unable to forget his one true love, Miko, a Japanese spy he met 19 years prior. Upon receiving news of her death, he is summoned to Japan by her lawyer, Ishibashi (Haruhiko Hirata) for the reading of her will.\n\nIshibashi informs Florentini that he has inherited the guardianship of Yumi (Hirosue), a fiery, adorable and eccentric Japanese/French teenage girl over whom he has custody until she reaches adulthood in two days (the age of adulthood in Japan being 20). Yumi, who was led to believe she was the result of her mother's rape and subsequent abandonment, hates her unknown father. Florentini realizes Yumi is his daughter, but does not tell her as she would probably flee from him.\n\nFlorentini uncovers evidence that Miko was the victim of foul play.  He discovers that Miko had stolen a small fortune from the [[Yakuza]], a fortune now destined for Yumi upon reaching adulthood. Florentini summons the help of Momo (Michel Muller), a former intelligence colleague living in Tokyo. He helps Florentini with further investigations into Miko's death and in guarding Yumi from the Yakuza by supplying him with two metal suitcases of weapons. The Yakuza try to attack Yumi in an arcade, but Florentini, who has been observing their positions, kills all of them.\n\nLater, Yumi discovers that Florentini is her father as she is captured by the Yakuza. As they take her away and prepare to execute Florentini, he uses golf balls to knock out his would-be executioners and knock out the rest in m\u00eal\u00e9e combat. With the help of former intelligence colleagues, Florentini and Momo free Yumi from her kidnappers when they attempt to withdraw money from Yumi's bank account by replacing the bank's staff and customers with their own men. During the rescue attempt a gunfight breaks out and all of the Yakuza are killed by Florentini single-handedly without any casualties to the good guys.\n\nFollowing the ordeal, Florentini takes a flight back to France, having promised Yumi he would be back in a month. But just before the plane takes off, a group of customs officers enter the cabin with two familiar metal suitcases in hand, asking for their owner.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Hubert Fiorentini\n* [[Ry\u014dko Hirosue]] as Yumi Yoshimido ([[Nihongo]]: \u5409\u5802\u7531\u7f8e, ''Yoshi d\u014d Yumi'')\n* [[Michel Muller]] as Maurice \"Momo\"\n* [[Carole Bouquet]] as Sofia\n* [[Ludovic Berthillot]] as Jean-Baptiste #1\n* [[Yan Epstein]] as Jean-Baptiste #2\n* [[Michel Scourneau]] as Van Eyck\n* [[Christian Sinniger]] as Squale\n* [[Jean-Marc Montalto]] as Olivier\n* [[Alexandre Brik]] as Ir\u00e8ne\n* [[Fabio Zenoni]] as Josy\n* [[V\u00e9ronique Balme]] as Betty\n* [[Jacques Bondoux]] as Del Rio\n* {{ill|Yoshi Oida|ja|\u7b08\u7530\u30e8\u30b7}} as Takanawa ([[Nihongo]]: \u9ad8\u8f2a, ''Takanawa'')\n* {{ill|Haruhiko Hirata|ja|\u5e73\u7530\u6674\u5f66}} as Ishibashi ([[Nihongo]]: \u77f3\u6a4b, ''Ishibashi'')\n* [[Edilberto Ruiz]] as Guacamole\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in Tokyo, Japan.<ref name=\"bifi\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''Wasabi'' was met with mixed reviews, with a 43% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wasabi/ |title=''Wasabi'' |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]/[[Flixster]] |access-date=2013-08-03}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that \"Reno does what he can in a thankless situation, the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again, and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wasabi-2002 |title=''Wasabi'' Movie Review & Film Summary (2002) |author=Ebert, Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |publisher=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert Digital LLC]] |date=2002-10-18 |access-date=2013-08-03}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 53 out of 100, based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/wasabi |title=Wasabi |work=Metacritic |access-date=July 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite some exhibitor expectations, it only opened in second place at the French box office, behind ''[[American Pie 2]]'', with a gross of 18.6 million Francs ($2.7 million) for the week.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=12|date=12 November 2001|title=International box office}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=12|date=12 November 2001|title=Holdovers save the day overseas|last=Groves|first=Don}}</ref> It reached [[List of 2001 box office number-one films in France|number one]] in its second week with a gross of 9.4 million Francs.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=9|date=19 November 2001|title=International Box Office}}</ref> It grossed $6.7 million in France and $10.4 million worldwide.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Amg movie|257792|Wasabi}}\n* {{IMDb title|0281364|Wasabi}}\n* {{mojo title|id=wasabi|title=Wasabi}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=Wasabi|title=Wasabi}}\n\n{{Luc Besson}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wasabi (Film)}}\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2000s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:EuropaCorp films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:French action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by G\u00e9rard Krawczyk]]\n[[Category:Films scored by \u00c9ric Serra]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Yakuza films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Luc Besson]]\n[[Category:2001 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
