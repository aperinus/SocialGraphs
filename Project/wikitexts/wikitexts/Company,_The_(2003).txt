The film also stars [[Malcolm McDowell]] and [[James Franco]], and is set in the company of the [[Joffrey Ballet]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=April 2016}}\n''The Company'' is composed of stories gathered from the dancers, choreographers, and staff of the Joffrey Ballet. Most of the roles are played by company members. While a small subplot relates a love story between Campbell's character and a character, a chef played by [[James Franco]], most of the movie focuses on the company as a whole, without any real star or linear plot. The many company stories woven together express the dedication and hard work that dancers must put into their art, although they are seldom rewarded with fame or fortune.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Neve Campbell]] as Loretta 'Ry' Ryan\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Alberto Antonelli\n* [[James Franco]] as Josh Williams\n\nThe part of Alberto Antonelli was reportedly inspired by the real life dancer and choreographer [[Gerald Arpino]].<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=The Company |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=December 24, 2003 |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-company-2003 |access-date=April 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''The Company'' was an idea of Campbell's for a long time\u2014she began her career as a ballet dancer, having been a student at Canada's [[National Ballet School]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Murray | first = Rebecca | title = Neve Campbell Interview - The Company Movie | url = http://movies.about.com/cs/thecompany/a/neve121203.htm | accessdate = January 27, 2007}}</ref> Altman was initially reluctant to direct the film, reportedly remarking, \"Barbara, I read your script and I don't get it.
