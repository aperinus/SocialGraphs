The screenplay by [[Steven Zaillian]] is based on the 1979 book ''The Falcon and the Snowman: A True Story of Friendship and Espionage'' by [[Robert Lindsey (journalist)|Robert Lindsey]], and tells the true story of two young American men, [[Christopher John Boyce|Christopher Boyce]] ([[Timothy Hutton]]) and [[Andrew Daulton Lee]] ([[Sean Penn]]), who sold US security secrets to the [[Soviet Union]]. The film features the song \"[[This Is Not America]],\" written and performed by [[David Bowie]] and the [[Pat Metheny Group]].\n\n==Plot==\nChristopher Boyce, an expert in the sport of [[falconry]] and the son of a former FBI special agent, gets a job at a civilian defense contractor working in the so-called \"Black Vault,\" a secure communication facility through which flows information on some of the most classified U.S. operations in the world. Boyce becomes disillusioned with the U.S. government through his new position, especially after reading a misrouted communiqu\u00e9 dealing with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s plan to [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|depose the Prime Minister of Australia]]. Frustrated by this duplicity, Boyce decides to repay his government by passing classified secrets to the Soviets.\n\nAndrew Daulton Lee is a drug addict and minor cocaine smuggler, nicknamed \"The Snowman,\" who has frustrated and alienated his family. Lee agrees to contact and deal with the KGB's agents in Mexico on Boyce's behalf, motivated not by idealism but by what he perceives as an opportunity to make money with plans to settle in Costa Rica, a nation that at that time had no extradition treaty with the United States.\n\nAs the pair become increasingly involved with espionage, Lee's ambition to create a major espionage business coupled with his excessive drug use begins to strain the two from each other. Alex, their Soviet handler, becomes increasingly reluctant to deal through Lee as the middleman because of Lee's periods of irrationality. Above all, Boyce wants to end the espionage act so that he can resume a normal life with his girlfriend Lana and attend college. Boyce meets with Lee's KGB handler to explain the situation. Meanwhile, Lee is desperate to regain the Soviets' regard after realizing that the KGB no longer needs him as a courier. Lee is observed tossing a note over the fence at the Soviet embassy in [[Mexico City]] and is arrested by Mexican police and a U.S. Foreign Service officer accompanies him to the police station.\n\nWhen the police search his pockets and find film from a [[Minox]] camera Boyce used to photograph documents along with a postcard used by the Soviets to show Lee the location of a drop zone, they produce pictures of the same location that was on the postcard, showing officers surrounding a dead man on the street. The Foreign Service officer explains that the Mexican police are trying to implicate him with the murder of a policeman. The police then drag Lee away and interrogate him.\n\nHours later, Lee reveals that he is a [[Soviet spy]]. Told by the Mexican police that he will be deported, Lee is offered a choice of where to be sent. Lee suggests Costa Rica, but the choice is merely between the Soviet Union and the United States. Lee reluctantly agrees to go back to America and is arrested as he walks across the border.\n\nKnowing that he too will soon be captured, Boyce releases his pet falcon, Fawkes, and then sits down to wait. Moments later, U.S. Marshals and FBI agents surround and capture him. As the film ends, Lee and Boyce are seen being escorted to prison.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Timothy Hutton]] as [[Christopher John Boyce|Christopher Boyce]]\n* [[Sean Penn]] as [[Andrew Daulton Lee]]\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Mr. Boyce\n* [[Joyce Van Patten]] as Mrs. Boyce\n* [[Richard Dysart]] as Dr. Lee\n* [[Priscilla Pointer]] as Mrs. Lee\n* [[Chris Makepeace]] as David Lee\n* [[Dorian Harewood]] as Gene\n* [[Macon McCalman]] as Larry Rogers\n* [[Nicholas Pryor]] as Eddie\n* [[Jerry Hardin]] as Tony Owens\n* [[Lori Singer]] as Lana\n* [[David Suchet]] as Alex\n* [[Boris Leskin]] as Mikhael\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n''The Falcon and The Snowman'' received generally positive notices upon release in 1985 and currently has an 82% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 22 critics.\n\nFilm critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave it a perfect four-star rating, citing one of the many strengths as that \"it succeeds, in an admirably matter-of-fact way, in showing us exactly how these two young men got in way over their heads. This is a movie about spies, but it is not a thriller in any routine sense of the word. It's just the meticulously observant record of how naivet\u00e9, inexperience, misplaced idealism and greed led to one of the most peculiar cases of treason in American history.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=The Falcon and the Snowman movie review (1985) {{!}} Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-falcon-and-the-snowman-1985 |access-date=2022-06-12 |website=rogerebert.com/ |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFilm critic [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also gave the film four stars and hailed Hutton and Penn's work in the film, writing that \"it's tough to spot Penn in this new role\" and calling Penn's performance rare because it \"neither patronizes nor celebrates drug use; instead, it's absolutely lifelike, and for a film based on a true story, there is no greater compliment.\"  Siskel also noted that the two lead characters formed an odd couple that made \"a terrific formula for a movie, creating at least three stories: The plight of each man, their joint effort to accomplish their goal and the changing dynamic of their relationship as the story progresses.  As if that weren't enough, 'The Falcon and the Snowman' also turns into a 'how-to' movie with a fine sense of detail for the worlds of espionage and drugs.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Gene |last=Siskel |title=The Falcon and the Snowman : John Schlesinger Triumphs with First Fine Film of 1985 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=4 |date=January 25, 1985 }}</ref>\n\n==Captain Midnight intrusion==\n{{Main|Captain Midnight broadcast signal intrusion}}\nOn April 27, 1986, a broadcast of ''The Falcon and The Snowman'' by [[Home Box Office|HBO]] was interrupted for four and a half minutes by a pirate broadcast featuring a message protesting the network's introduction of signal scrambling and higher charges for satellite dish owners.
