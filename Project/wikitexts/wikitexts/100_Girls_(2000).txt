It tells the story of a college student's ([[Jonathan Tucker]]) efforts to find a mystery girl with whom he had sex in an elevator during a blackout. It was released direct-to-video on September 25, 2001.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter leaving a party at a women's dormitory, Matthew ([[Jonathan Tucker]]) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out. They have sex in the dark and when Matthew wakes up in the elevator the morning after, he finds himself alone with a pair of her [[panties]].\n\nOn a mission to find his mystery maiden by looking for a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the \"Virgin Vault\", an all-female dormitory. This allows him to investigate without drawing suspicion. His roommate Rod (James DeBello) keeps telling him to give up and introduces him to the \"penile power\", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size. He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from [[hypospadias]].\n\nEarly on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty ([[Emmanuelle Chriqui]]) and her boyfriend Crick (Johnny Green) fight. Crick is the [[epitome]] of the macho man [[stereotype]], with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness. Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick. Crick leaves, and Patty tries to help Matthew, but Matthew can't help but think of Patty's reputation as a \"[[slut]]\".\n\nWhile searching one room, Matthew finds himself trapped in the bathroom when the occupant returns. Matthew is attacked by Wendy ([[Larisa Oleynik]]), until she recognizes him as a high school classmate. Wendy decides to help Matthew in his quest to find his mystery maiden, hoping that, in the process, she may find one of her own, as she is a closeted [[lesbian]].\n\nMatthew is nervous about talking to girls. Arlene ([[Katherine Heigl]]) and his teacher Ms. Stern (Aimee Graham) disparage Matthew, asserting that women are more dominant than men are and that women, rather than men, should be in command. Rod tells Matthew that he's a chicken and should just give up on girls, while Matthew tells him that he has never been able to speak to girls, especially Cynthia ([[Jaime Pressly]]).\n\nMatthew puts an advertisement in the school newspaper asking the girl he's seeking to meet him in the basement on a Thursday night. He sits in the dark every Thursday night, waiting for her to show up. The door opens one night, and he thinks it's her, but it's Wendy, coming to check up on him. Finally, the mystery maiden does show up, only to tell him to stop looking for her.\n\nDespite this, Matthew isn't deterred, and disguises himself in drag, as Francesca, as a means to continue his search. In drag, he is actually able to talk to Cynthia without being intimidated by her good looks.  She then gets injured after two students accidentally drop a couch on her. Rod flirts with Francesca and later brags to Matthew that he had sex with her. This makes Matthew so angry that he adds another weight onto Rod's \"penile power\" device, hurting him. Crick makes a pass at Matthew in drag while he fights with Patty. Matthew bites off part of Crick's tongue. As a result, Crick is unable to speak without [[lisping]].\n\nDesperation sets in, so Matthew appeals to his mystery maiden by proclaiming his love for her to the whole dormitory. He finally determines his mystery maiden is Patty. She initially rejects him because she thought that he would see her only as a slut. Crick sees that Matthew wants Patty, but Matthew has him arrested for sexually assaulting him (when he was dressed as Francesca).\n\nMatthew introduces Rod and Dora, and Arlene and Wendy hook up. Cynthia shows off her newly found martial art abilities that she discovered as a way to cope with frustration following her injury, and Ms. Stern learns a valuable lesson on gender equality, as Matthew stands up to her in front of the class, to an ovation. Finally, Matthew proclaims his love to Patty, who sees his loving eyes, and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jonathan Tucker]] as Matthew\n* [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]] as Patty\n* James DeBello as Rod\n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as Arlene\n* [[Larisa Oleynik]] as Wendy\n* [[Jaime Pressly]] as Cynthia\n* [[Marissa Ribisi]] as Dora\n<!-- End of \"main\" cast as per film's opening credits -->\n* Johnny Green as Crick\n<!-- End of \"main\" cast as per film's end credits -->\n* Aimee Graham as Ms. Stern\n* Ange Billman as Dana\n* [[Kristina Anapau]] as Sasha\n* Rainbeau Mars as Maureen\n* Monica Huarte as Janeite #1\n* Reilly McLaren as Janeite #2\n* Kristin Herold as Barbara\n* [[Anya Marina]] as Rhonda\n* Josephine Angelini as Michelle\n* Julieanne Steger as Penny\n* Ivana Bozilovic as Rene\n* [[Eric Szmanda]] as Sam\n* Jennifer Ko as Crystal\n* Alex Duda as Ronald\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 60% based on reviews from 5 critics.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web |title= 100 Girls (2000) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/100_girls |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\nChristopher Null of Reel.com gave it 2.5/4 and described the film as \"One hell of an oddity\"<ref>{{cite web |date= 22 June 2008 |author1= Christopher Null |title= 100 Girls (2000) |url= http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=133299&buy=open&PID=12142193&Tab=reviews&CID=18#tabs |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080622184308/http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=133299&buy=open&PID=12142193&Tab=reviews&CID=18#tabs |url-status= dead |archive-date= 22 June 2008 |website=Reel.com }}</ref>\nDavid Nusair of Reel Film gave the film 2.5/4, and comparing it to films like ''[[Scary Movie]]'' concluded \"...you could certainly do worse.\"<ref>{{cite web |date= August 1, 2003 |author= David Nusair |title= The Films of Michael Davis - Reviews by David Nusair |url= https://www.reelfilm.com/micdavis.htm#100girls |website=Reelfilm.com }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[100 Women (film)|100 Women]]'' (2002), a thematic sequel by the same writer/director.
