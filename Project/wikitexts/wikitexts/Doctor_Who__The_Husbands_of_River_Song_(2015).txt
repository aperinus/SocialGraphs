First broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 25 December 2015, it is the eleventh [[List of Doctor Who Christmas specials|Christmas special]] since the show's revival in 2005. It was written by [[Steven Moffat]] and directed by [[Douglas Mackinnon]]. The episode marks the return of [[Alex Kingston]] as [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], making her first appearance alongside [[Peter Capaldi]]'s [[Twelfth Doctor]].<ref name=\"2015Christmas\">{{cite web|title=The Doctor and River Song Reunite For A Spectacular Christmas|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/32369834-a751-4dca-8829-b1a9ec3fb1cb|website=BBC|publisher=The Doctor Who Team|access-date=12 November 2015|date=2 September 2015}}</ref> This also marks the first appearance of [[Nardole]], who would become a companion starting from the [[The Return of Doctor Mysterio|next episode]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 5343 on the human colony of Mendorax Dellora, the [[Twelfth Doctor]] is mistaken by a servant, [[Nardole]], for a surgeon hired by [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] to attend to her dying husband, King Hydroflax. River, who is unfamiliar with his new set of [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]]s, fails to recognize the Doctor as she takes him aside and tells him to decapitate Hydroflax so she can claim the Halassi Androvar, the most valuable diamond in the universe, which has become lodged in the king\u2019s brain.\n\nHowever, they are interrupted by Hydroflax, who overhears them. Being a [[cyborg]], he detaches his head from his mechanical body and orders it to kill them. While River defends herself, the Doctor grabs Hydroflax's head and threatens to put him in the garbage disposal, creating a stalemate and allowing Ramone, River's actual husband, to teleport her, the Doctor, and Hydroflax\u2019s head outside. Believing Nardole to have information about River, Hydroflax\u2019s body decapitates him to use his head as its own.\n\nRiver and Ramone track down the TARDIS and attempt to take off with the Doctor, but the ship's safeguards prevent it from taking off when it detects that Hydroflax\u2019s head and body, although separated, are still linked to one another. Left behind, Hydroflax\u2019s body tricks and uploads Ramone before following a homing beacon emitted by his head. Using Ramone, it forces its way inside, causing the TARDIS to travel to the starship ''Harmony and Redemption'', where River requests that the [[Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel|ma\u00eetre d\u2019]], Flemming, [[List of Doctor Who items#Deadlock seal|deadlock seal]] the baggage hold where the TARDIS landed to prevent Hydroflax\u2019s body from pursuing them further.\n\nRather than return the diamond to the Halassi, River reveals that she intends to sell the diamond to a buyer named Scratch, who has secretly filled the meeting point with members of his own species. After receiving payment, River and the Doctor discover that Scratch and his compatriots worship Hydroflax and are after the diamond in his honour. Despite attempts to hide the bagged head containing the diamond, Flemming stops them from escaping\u2013after being tricked into entering the baggage area by an under-duress Ramone\u2013but promises the Doctor's head to Hydroflax's body using River as bait. Sensing that Hydroflax's head will die imminently, his body destroys it, leaving only the diamond. Flemming interrogates River for the Doctor's whereabouts, but she explains that although she loves the Doctor, he does not reciprocate before realizing the Doctor was with her all along.\n\nBeing a time traveler, River knows the ship is about to be crippled by a meteor strike, which she uses as their escape plan, taking the diamond in the process. The Doctor uses Scratch\u2019s universal bank transfer device to overload Hydroflax\u2019s body before heading to the ship\u2019s bridge. As the ship is crashing, River discovers that they are heading towards the planet Darillium, which the Doctor remembers is where she spends her last night with him before her death. Realizing that they cannot save the ship, River and the Doctor flee into the TARDIS, but the impact knocks her unconscious.\n\nHaving avoided taking River to Darillium for as long as possible, the Doctor decides to give in to the inevitable. After traveling to the next morning, the Doctor suggests to a man searching for survivors that he build a restaurant with a view of Darillium's Singing Towers, and gives him the diamond to fund its construction. Traveling forward in time once again, the Doctor books a table on the balcony for Christmas Day in four years\u2019 time. When River awakens and exits the TARDIS into the restaurant, she is told that the Doctor is waiting for her. She encounters Hydroflax\u2019s body, since salvaged and now peacefully controlled by Ramone and Nardole's heads, working as a waiter in the restaurant.\n\nThe Doctor gives River a [[sonic screwdriver]], the same one she has in \"[[Forest of the Dead]]\". As the pair admire the Singing Towers, River asks whether this really is their last night together. The Doctor insists that there is no way to avoid the end of their times together and refuses to tell River the future, though he reveals one night on Darillium lasts for twenty-four years.\n\n===Continuity===\nRamone shows pictures of the Doctor's original twelve faces, which River mentions having in order to recognise the Doctor in \"[[The Time of Angels]]\" (2010).<ref name=\"richjohnston\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/12/25/ten-thoughts-about-doctor-who-christmas-special-the-husbands-of-river-song/|title=Ten Thoughts About Doctor Who Christmas Special: The Husbands Of River Song (UPDATE)|author=Rich Johnston|work=Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News|date=25 December 2015}}</ref> River doesn't recognise the Twelfth Doctor ''as'' the Doctor because \"he has limits\", referring to the [[Time Lords]]' [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)#Maximum number of regenerations in a cycle|twelve-regenerations limit]] first mentioned in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976).<ref name=\"denofgeek.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/doctor-who/38355/doctor-who-geeky-spots-in-the-husbands-of-river-song|title=Doctor Who: geeky spots in The Husbands Of River Song|work=Den of Geek|date=25 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs he reads River's diary, Flemming relates many of her adventures with the Doctor: the opening of the Pandorica (\"[[The Pandorica Opens]]\"), the crash of the ''Byzantium'' (first mentioned in \"[[Silence in the Library]]\" and shown in \"[[Flesh and Stone]]\"), a picnic at Asgard (mentioned in \"Silence in the Library\"), an encounter with Jim the Fish (mentioned in \"[[The Impossible Astronaut]]\"), and her most recent trip \u2013 to a place called \"Manhattan\" (\"[[The Angels Take Manhattan]]\").<ref>{{Citation | title = The husbands of River Song new details | url = http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/the-husbands-of-river-song-new-details-78926.htm | newspaper = Doctor Who TV | date = 9 December 2015 | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.</ref><ref name = hints2>{{Citation | title = The husbands of River Song hints, teasers set 2 | url = http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/the-husbands-of-river-song-hints-teasers-set-2-79170.htm | place = UK | newspaper = Doctor Who TV| date = 24 December 2015 }}.</ref><ref name = den>{{Citation | title = Doctor Who geeky spots in The husbands of River Song | newspaper = Den of geek | date = 25 December 2015 | url = http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/doctor-who/38355/doctor-who-geeky-spots-in-the-husbands-of-river-song}}.</ref>\n\nThe Doctor tells River that \"every Christmas is last Christmas\", repeating what a dream-image [[Danny Pink]] tells [[Clara Oswald]] in \"[[Last Christmas (Doctor Who)|Last Christmas]]\" (2014).<ref name = hints2 /><ref name = den />\n\nWhen the Doctor argues about River's \"marriages\", River recounts some of the Doctor's own: [[Elizabeth I]] (first mentioned in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" and depicted in \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\"), [[Marilyn Monroe]] (\"[[A Christmas Carol (Doctor Who)|A Christmas Carol]]\"), and [[Cleopatra]] (mentioned in \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\").<ref name = den />\n\nDetails of the Doctor's last encounter with River at the singing towers of Darillium, originally mentioned in \"[[Forest of the Dead]]\" (2008), are shown here.
