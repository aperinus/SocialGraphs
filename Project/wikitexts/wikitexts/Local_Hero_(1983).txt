Produced by [[David Puttnam]], the film is about an American oil company representative who is sent to the fictional village of Ferness on the west coast of Scotland to purchase the town and surrounding property for his company. For his work on the film, Forsyth won the 1984 [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction]].\n\nA stage musical adaptation received its world premiere in 2019. In the same year a [[Criterion Collection]] DVD/Blu-ray was released in September.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/28709-local-hero|website=Criterion Collection|title= Bill Forsyth: Local Hero|access-date= 5 December 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\"Mac\" MacIntyre is a typical 1980s hot-shot executive working for Knox Oil and Gas in [[Houston, Texas]]. The eccentric head of the company, Felix Happer, sends him (largely because his surname sounds Scottish) to acquire the village of Ferness in the Scottish Highlands to make way for a refinery. Mac (who is actually of Hungarian extraction) is a little apprehensive about his assignment, complaining to a co-worker that he would much rather take care of business over the phone and via [[Teletypewriter message|telex]] machines. Happer, an avid astronomy buff, tells Mac to watch the sky and to notify him immediately if he sees anything unusual.\n\nUpon arriving in Scotland, Mac teams up with local Knox representative Danny Oldsen. During a visit to a Knox research facility in [[Aberdeen]], Dr. Geddes and his assistant Watt inform them about the scope of the company's plans, which entail replacing Ferness with the refinery. They also meet (and admire) marine researcher Marina.\n\nMac ultimately spends several weeks in Ferness, gradually adapting to the slower-paced life and getting to know the eccentric residents, most notably hotel owner and accountant Gordon Urquhart, and his wife Stella. As time passes, Mac becomes more and more conflicted as he presses to close the deal that will spell the end of the quaint little village he has come to love. Unbeknownst to him, however, the villagers are tired of their hard life and are more than eager to sell, though they feign indifference to induce a larger offer. Mac receives encouragement from an unlikely source: Victor, a capitalistic [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] fishing boat captain who periodically visits his friends in Ferness (and checks on his investment portfolio, managed by Gordon).\n\nMeanwhile, Danny befriends Marina, who is under the impression that the company is planning to build a research centre at Ferness. During a date, he discovers that Marina, who seems more at home in the water than on land, has [[webbed toes]]. While watching some grey seals, Danny mentions that sailors used to believe they were [[mermaid]]s. Marina tells him the sailors were wrong.\n\nAs the deal nears completion, Gordon discovers that Ben Knox, an old [[Beachcombing|beachcomber]] who lives in a driftwood shack on the shore, owns the beach through a grant from the [[Lord of the Isles]] to his ancestor. MacIntyre tries everything to entice Ben to sell, even offering enough money to buy any other beach in the world, but the owner is content with what he has. Ben picks up some sand and offers to sell for the same number of pound notes as he has grains of sand in his hand. A suspicious MacIntyre declines, only to be told there could not have been more than ten thousand grains.\n\nHapper finally arrives on site, just in time to unknowingly forestall a potential confrontation between some of the villagers and Ben. When Mac informs him of the snag in the proceedings, he decides to negotiate personally with Ben and, in the process, discovers a kindred spirit. Happer opts to locate the refinery offshore and set up an astronomical observatory instead. He sends MacIntyre home to implement the changes. Danny brings up Marina's dream of an [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] research facility and suggests combining the two into the \"Happer Institute\", an idea that Happer likes. A sombre MacIntyre returns to his apartment in Houston. He pulls from his pocket pebbles and shells and spreads them out on the work surface. The local phone box in Ferness starts ringing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Peter Riegert]] as Mac\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Felix Happer\n* [[Fulton Mackay]] as Ben Knox\n* [[Denis Lawson]] as Gordon Urquhart\n* Norman Chancer as Moritz\n* [[Peter Capaldi]] as Danny Oldsen\n* [[Rikki Fulton]] as Geddes\n* [[Alex Norton]] as Watt\n* [[Jenny Seagrove]] as Marina\n* [[Jennifer Black]] as Stella\n* Christopher Rozycki as Victor\n* [[Gyearbuor Asante|Christopher Asante]] as Reverend Macpherson\n* [[John Gordon Sinclair]] as Ricky\n* Caroline Guthrie as Pauline\n* [[John M.

When Puttnam won a [[BAFTA]] for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' in 1982 this convinced Goldcrest executives to  finance the entire film. Warner Bros. agreed to pay $1.5 million for US rights.<ref name=\"jake\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nPuttnam always wanted Burt Lancaster to play Happer but the casting proved problematic because the Hollywood star wanted his $2 million salary, which was almost a third of the film's entire budget. However, upon learning of Lancaster's potential involvement in the project, [[Warner Bros.]] offered Puttnam a US distribution deal and provided the additional funding to secure Lancaster. After negotiations, Puttnam ended up having an additional $200,000 in the film's budget. He later remarked in an interview that \"big stars are not a liability, they are an asset!\".\n\n[[Michael Douglas]] and [[Henry Winkler]] were both actively pursued by Bill Forsyth for the role of MacIntyre (which ultimately went to [[Peter Riegert]]).\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Pennan Village 01072008.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pennan]], [[Aberdeenshire]], which featured as the fictional village of Ferness]]\n[[File:Camusdarach Beach, near Morar - geograph.org.uk - 58018.jpg|right|thumb|Camusdarach, [[Morar]], near [[Mallaig]], [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], as the beach at Ferness]]\n''Local Hero'' was filmed in several locations around Scotland.

He gave particular praise to writer-director Bill Forsyth for his abilities as a storyteller.\n\n{{blockquote|What makes this material really work is the low-key approach of the writer-director, Bill Forsyth, who also made the charming ''[[Gregory's Girl]]'' and has the patience to let his characters gradually reveal themselves to the camera. He never hurries, and as a result, ''Local Hero'' never drags: Nothing is more absorbing than human personalities, developed with love and humor. Some of the payoffs in this film are sly and subtle, and others generate big laughs. Forsyth's big scenes are his little ones, including a heartfelt, whisky-soaked talk between the American and the innkeeper, and a scene where the visitors walk on the beach and talk about the meaning of life. By the time Burt Lancaster reappears at the end of the film, to personally handle the negotiations with old Ben, ''Local Hero'' could hardly have anything but a happy ending.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=Local Hero |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19830415/REVIEWS/304150301 |access-date=22 January 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n[[James Berardinelli]] gave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling it \"a fragment of cinematic whimsy\u2014a genial dramatic comedy that defies both our expectations and those of the characters\". Berardinelli also focused on Forsyth's abilities as a storyteller, noting that the director \"finds the perfect tone for this not-quite-a-fairy-tale set in a quaint seaside Scottish village named Ferness. By injecting a little (but not too much) magical realism into the mix, Forsyth leavens his pro-environmental message to the point that those not looking for it might not be conscious of its presence.\" Berardinelli concluded that ''Local Hero'' represents \"the best kind of light fare: a motion picture that offers a helping of substance to go along with an otherwise frothy and undemanding main course\".<ref name=\"reelviews\">{{cite web |last=Berardinelli |first=James |title=Local Hero |website=Reel Views |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/l/local_hero.html |access-date=22 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, \"Genuine fairy tales are rare; so is film-making that is thoroughly original in an unobtrusive way. Bill Forsyth's quirky disarming ''Local Hero'' is both.\" Maslin concluded:\n{{blockquote|''Local Hero'' is a funny movie, but it's more apt to induce chuckles than knee-slapping.
