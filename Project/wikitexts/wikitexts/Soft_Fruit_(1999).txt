It is an Australian American co-production produced by New Zealand filmmaker [[Jane Campion]] and directed by [[Christina Andreef]].\n\nAndreef later talked about the themes of the film:\n<blockquote>As you grow older, it's so difficult to stay in relationship with your adult brothers and sisters. When you get into your thirties and forties, paths are dividing.   ''Soft Fruit'' is about that sibling struggle. You think you don't care when you have a fight and fall out. Someone is always on the outer. It's about that struggle to get back on the inner, on the inside.<ref>[http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Christina+Andreef&bl \"Interview with Christina Andreef\", ''Signet'', May 2000] accessed 17 November 2012</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2000]] the soundtrack was nominated for [[ARIA Award for Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album|Best Original Soundtrack Album]].<ref name=\"OST\">ARIA Award previous winners. {{cite web|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/award/best-original-soundtrack-cast-show-album|title=History Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album |publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA)|access-date=12 July 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jeanie Drynan]] as Patsy\n*[[Russell Dykstra]] as Bo\n*[[Linal Haft]] as Vic\n*[[Genevieve Lemon]] as Josie\n*[[Sacha Horler]] as Nadia\n*[[Alicia Talbot]] as Vera\n\n==Awards==\n<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180181/awards {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref>\n*[[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor]] - Russell Dykstra ('''winner''')\n*[[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Australian Film Institute Award for Best Supporting Actress]] - Sacha Horler ('''winner''')\n*[[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film]] (nominated)\n*[[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress]] - Jeanie Drynan (nominated)\n*[[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Direction|Australian Film Institute Award for Best Director]] - Christina Andreef (nominated)\n*[[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Screenplay]] - Christina Andreef (nominated)\n*[[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Original Music Score]] \u2013 [[Antony Partos]] (nominated)\n\n==Box office==\n''Soft Fruit'' grossed $598,704 at the box office in Australia.<ref>[http://film.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/AA4_Aust_Box_office_report.pdf ''Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office'']</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cinema of Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0180181}}\n*[https://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/soft-fruit ''Soft Fruit''] at Oz Movies\n\n[[Category:Australian drama films]]\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:Fox Searchlight Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Australian films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-Australia-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
