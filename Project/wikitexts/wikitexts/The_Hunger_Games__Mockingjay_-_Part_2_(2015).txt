It is the fourth installment in [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' film series]], and the second of two films based on the 2010 novel ''[[Mockingjay]]'', which serves as the final book in [[The Hunger Games|''The Hunger Games'' trilogy]] by [[Suzanne Collins]]. The film was produced by [[Nina Jacobson]] and Jon Kilik, and distributed by [[Lionsgate]]. It features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[Liam Hemsworth]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. Hoffman died in February 2014, marking his final film role.\n\nThe story continues from ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1]]'' with [[Katniss Everdeen]] (Lawrence) preparing to win the war against President Snow (Sutherland) and the tyrannical Capitol. Together with Peeta, Gale, Finnick, and others, she travels to the Capitol to kill Snow. [[Principal photography]] on both parts of ''Mockingjay'' began on September 23, 2013, in [[Atlanta]], before moving to [[Paris]] for two weeks of [[back to back film production|back-to-back]] filming and officially concluding on June 20, 2014, in [[Berlin]] and at [[Babelsberg Studio]], which served as a co-producer.<ref name=\"BTB production\"/>\n\n''The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2'' premiered in Berlin on November 4, 2015, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 20, 2015, in 2D and [[IMAX]], and internationally in 2D, 3D, [[RealD Cinema]], and IMAX 3D in select territories; it is the only film in the series widely released in 3D. The film grossed $102 million gross over its opening weekend in North America, the sixth-biggest opening in 2015, and held the number one spot at the international box office for four consecutive weekends. The film grossed over $658 million worldwide, making it the [[2015 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth highest-grossing film of 2015]],<ref name=\"profit\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/03/hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-profit-jennifer-lawrence-box-office-2015-1201724077/|title=No. 12 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2' \u2013 2015 Most Valuable Movie Blockbuster Tournament|author=Mike Fleming Jr|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=March 22, 2016|access-date=March 23, 2016}}</ref> but the lowest-grossing installment in the series, falling below expectations both internationally and domestically.\n\n''Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2'' received generally positive reviews from critics, for its performances (particularly Lawrence, Hutcherson and Sutherland's), screenplay, musical score, and action sequences, though it was criticized for splitting the final adaptation into two separate parts. The film was nominated for [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]] at the [[42nd Saturn Awards]]. It received three nominations at the [[21st Empire Awards]] for [[Empire Award for Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy|Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy]], [[Empire Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Lawrence) and Best Production Design. For her part, Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie|Best Actress in an Action Movie]] at the [[21st Critics' Choice Awards]]. A [[The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes|prequel]] is scheduled to be released on November 17, 2023.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter being attacked by a hijacked (brainwashed) [[Peeta Mellark]], [[Katniss Everdeen]] recovers from her injuries in District 13.  [[Alma Coin|President Coin]] refuses to let Katniss go to the Capitol until they take District 2, so instead, she sends her to join the assault on the Capitol's armory in District 2, the last district controlled by the Capitol. Although she is able to rally the rebels and convince District 2 to join the rebellion, she is shot by a civilian, but merely injured due to her bulletproof Mockingjay costume.\n\nJohanna covers for Katniss while she sneaks onboard a helicopter on its way to the Capitol. Coin becomes aware of Katniss' defiance but plays along. Katniss is recruited into the Star Squad, which includes [[Gale Hawthorne|Gale]] and a recently married Finnick. The whole squad is given nightlock pills to take in case they are captured. Peeta, who is still not fully recovered, eventually joins them in the field to appear in the propaganda videos that the team is responsible for shooting in the wreckage of the city. Led by Boggs, the team makes their way to the Capitol, evading [[booby trap|booby-trapped]] \"pods\" placed along the way with Boggs' holographic map called the Holo. In setting up for a shot in a courtyard, Boggs is fatally wounded by a pod and bestows the Holo on Katniss. In his final breath, he tells her the password to self-destruct the Holo and insists that she keep going, warning her of Coin. The squad then accidentally triggers another pod, releasing a flood of lethal black tar. As they flee, Peeta momentarily succumbs to his conditioning in the high-pressure situation and attacks Katniss, killing Mitchell in the process.\n\nKatniss refuses to kill Peeta, but Gale states that he would kill him if needed. The group are then trapped in a building by Peacekeepers. As they try to figure out their next steps, Katniss lies and says that Coin has sent her on a mission to assassinate President Snow. The other group members know this is a lie, but they back Katniss up and decide to follow \"Coin's\" orders. The Leeg sisters stay behind in the building as a distraction so the group can escape the building. The Peacekeepers destroy the building and the Capitol broadcasts a video of the attack announcing Katniss' apparent death, which is then interrupted by Coin who delivers an impassioned eulogy for Katniss to rally the rebels. Realizing that everyone believes Katniss to be dead actually helps their cause, the team decides to continue on to the mansion and quietly assassinate Snow. The group travels into the sewers to make it across the Capitol without being detected or hurt by pods, but surveillance footage in the tunnels alerts Snow that Katniss is actually alive. He orders the release of genetically engineered \"mutts\" into the sewers, who ambush and kill several members of the group, including Finnick. Katniss uses the password on the Holo to self-destruct and cause an explosion that kills the rest of the mutts. The team escapes the sewers and takes shelter in a nearby house owned by former Hunger Games stylist and Snow's cousin, Tigris.\n\nSnow invites Capitol citizens to take shelter in his mansion, forming a human shield around the mansion. After saying goodbye to Peeta, Katniss and Gale join the group of citizens in disguise in order to infiltrate the mansion. During this attempt, the rebels finally arrive at the Capitol and engage in a gunfight with the Peacekeepers, with several Capitol citizens being caught in the crossfire. The mansion gates remain closed to the Capitol citizens that arrive, and the children in the crowd are brought to the front so that they can enter first when they do. In all the confusion, a hovercraft marked with Capitol insignia drops bombs into the crowd. When a group of medics, including Katniss' sister, Prim, arrive to treat the wounded, the second wave of bombings occurs, killing Prim and knocking Katniss unconscious.\n\nKatniss awakens, and Haymitch informs her that the rebels have finally won the rebellion. Katniss goes to face Snow in his greenhouse, where he is being held prisoner and awaiting execution. He explains to Katniss that Coin staged the bombing to turn his followers against him and when she doesn't believe him, reminds Katniss of his promise never to lie to her. Katniss realizes Gale had suggested a similar strategy and confronts him about this when he comes to visit her. When Gale claims that he is not sure whose side the bombs came from, but that he cannot deny his part in Prim's death and regrets not being able to keep his promise of protecting her family, Katniss dismisses him.\n\nCoin calls a meeting of the surviving Hunger Games victors, where she declares herself the interim President of Panem. Haymitch slyly asks how long \"interim\" might be, but Coin does not answer. To end the violence of the rebellion, she calls for a vote for a final, symbolic Hunger Games using the children of Capitol leaders as revenge. Some of the tributes, including Peeta, are immediately outraged, and others support the initiative. Katniss stays deliberately silent, and Coin asks her directly what she thinks after most of the tributes have cast their votes. After a moment to think, Katniss votes yes on the condition that she can execute Snow herself. After meeting Katniss' eyes at the table, Haymitch casts the tie-breaking final vote of \"yes.\"\n\nAt Snow's execution, Katniss approaches Snow with her bow in hand as he's tied to a stake. Overlooking them is Coin, and after a booming speech Katniss shoots her instead. Coin falls from her podium and Snow begins to laugh, which causes a riot of citizens to converge on and kill Snow. Katniss then tries to swallow her nightlock pill, but Peeta rushes in to stop Katniss from committing suicide and she is then arrested. In captivity, Haymitch brings Katniss a letter from [[Plutarch Heavensbee|Plutarch]] that she refuses to read. Haymitch then reads it aloud to her; the letter assures Katniss that she will be pardoned, there will be no \"last Hunger Games,\" and she will be able to return to District 12. He doesn't tell her this in person because he feels that he cannot be seen with her as Panem begins to heal under the leadership of Commander Paylor. Katniss remarks that the only person who's ever actually won the Hunger Games is Plutarch Heavensbee.\n\nReturning home to District 12, Katniss tries to pick up the pieces of her old life. Prim's cat returns to the house, and Katniss has an outburst at the animal before breaking down into tears, hugging it close to her. One day Katniss walks outside to find Peeta, who has almost fully recovered from his conditioning and returned home. He is planting primroses at the front of the village. They spend time together, sometimes with Haymitch, and even receive a letter from Annie, Finnick's wife, telling them that they have had a son, that Katniss\u2019 mother is still treating survivors, and that Gale was promoted to Captain. Commander Paylor is formally elected the new President of Panem.\n\nYears later, Katniss and Peeta play with their two children in a meadow. Their infant cries from a nightmare, and Katniss ponders that they will eventually learn her story and about her time in the Games; she muses to her baby that sometimes when she has a nightmare, she plays a game wherein she imagines every good thing that she has ever seen anyone do. She says that the game gets a little tedious at times, but states that \u201cthere are much worse games to play.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n{{For|character descriptions from the novels|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n[[File:Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2015 X-Men.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Jennifer Lawrence]] made her final appearance as [[Katniss Everdeen]] in the film.]]\n\n<!--- Cast per tombstone closing credits and order, which included 20 actors, with roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as [[Peeta Mellark]]\n* [[Liam Hemsworth]] as [[Gale Hawthorne]]\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as [[Haymitch Abernathy]]\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as [[Effie Trinket]]\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#President Coin|President Alma Coin]]\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Plutarch Heavensbee|Plutarch Heavensbee]]\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#75th Hunger Games (3rd Quarter Quell)|Beetee]]\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Caesar Flickerman|Caesar Flickerman]]\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[President Snow]]\n* [[Willow Shields]] as [[Primrose Everdeen]]\n* [[Sam Claflin]] as [[Finnick Odair]]\n* [[Jena Malone]] as [[Johanna Mason]]\n* [[Mahershala Ali]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Boggs|Boggs]]\n* [[Natalie Dormer]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Cressida|Cressida]]\n* [[Wes Chatham]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Castor|Castor]]\n* [[Michelle Forbes]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Jackson|Lieutenant Jackson]]\n* [[Elden Henson]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Pollux|Pollux]]\n* [[Patina Miller]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Commander Paylor|Commander Paylor]]\n* [[Evan Ross]] as Messalla\n* [[Omid Abtahi]] as Homes\n{{div col end}}\n\nIn addition to these twenty top-billed cast, [[Stef Dawson]] returned for her third appearance as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Annie Cresta|Annie Cresta]], [[Robert Knepper]] as [[Antonius]], [[Paula Malcomson]] for her fourth appearance as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Mrs. Everdeen|Katniss\u2019s mother]], [[Eugenie Bondurant]] as [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Tigris|Tigris]], [[Gwendoline Christie]] as Commander Lyme, a previous victor from District 2.
