The screenplay by [[Hossein Amini]] is based on the [[The Wings of the Dove|1902 novel of the same name]] by [[Henry James]]. The film was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] and five BAFTAs, recognizing Bonham Carter's performance, the screenplay, the costume design, and the cinematography.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1910 London, Kate Croy (Helena Bonham Carter) lives under the careful watch of her domineering Aunt Maude ([[Charlotte Rampling]]). The wealthy Maude has taken the penniless Kate in as her ward, intending to marry her to a rich man and save her from the fate which befell her recently deceased mother when she married Kate's own dissolute father, Lionel ([[Michael Gambon]]). Lord Mark ([[Alex Jennings]]), a sophisticated aristocrat with a large estate, begins to court Kate with Maude's approval. However, Kate is secretly in love with a young [[Muckraker|muckraking]] journalist named Merton Densher (Linus Roache), whom her aunt has forbidden her from pursuing a relationship with because of his humble circumstances. Nonetheless, she has continued to meet with Merton in secret, though he is growing increasingly impatient for her to leave her aunt and marry him.\n\nAunt Maude confronts Kate about her continuing association with Merton and threatens to withdraw her financial support from Kate and her father. Kate reluctantly breaks with Merton and refuses to meet with him anymore. A few months later, at a dinner party given by her aunt, Kate is introduced to the wealthy American orphan and heiress Milly Theale (Allison Elliot), who is on an extended trip through Europe with her travelling companion Susan Stringham ([[Elizabeth McGovern]]). The cynical Kate is captivated by Milly's beauty, vivaciousness and humour, and the two form a strong friendship. Kate and Merton reconcile and resume their secret meetings; one day they run into Milly, and Kate introduces Merton as a family friend. Soon after, Milly invites Kate to accompany her and Susan to [[Venice]].\n\nBefore leaving, Lord Mark secretly reveals to Kate that Milly is terminally ill and that although he desires Kate he needs to marry Milly and her fortune to avoid losing his estates. Aware that Milly is indifferent to Lord Mark but is smitten with Merton, Kate invites Merton to Venice and persuades him to show Milly affection in an effort to seduce her. Kate expects that the orphaned and lonely Milly will leave him her fortune after her death.\n\nDuring Kate's, Milly's, and Merton's excursions through Venice, Kate gradually becomes jealous of Milly's attraction to Merton, so much so that she lures him away one night to have sex. Milly confronts her the next morning, though Kate denies that Merton is her lover. She realises that, if her scheme is to succeed, she must leave Venice without warning Merton. On their own in Venice, Merton's affection for Milly grows and the two form a strong bond, even as her condition worsens. One day Merton spots Lord Mark at a cafe; alarmed, he goes to visit Milly but is denied entry. Susan visits him and Merton realises that Kate has revealed their secret to Lord Mark to sabotage the whole scheme, knowing that Mark would tell Milly as revenge for her rejecting him. Nonetheless, Milly agrees to see Merton and the two share an intimate moment where she forgives him and says that she still loves both him and Kate, despite their actions. A few days later, Milly dies and Merton and Susan attend her funeral.\n\nAfter Merton returns to London, Kate comes to Merton's flat. She asks why he has not come to see her in the weeks he has been back and finds a letter from Milly's lawyers, informing Merton that Milly did indeed bequeath a sizable portion of her estate to him. Merton tells Kate that he will not take the money, and she must marry him without it if they are to be together. They make love and afterwards Kate agrees, with the condition he tells her that he is not still in love with his memory of Milly. He cannot, and Kate leaves him for good, knowing that her conniving has backfired. Merton returns alone to Venice, while in the background we hear Milly's voice repeating her confident assertion that Merton will be coming into his own, and sooner than he thinks.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Kate Croy\n* [[Alison Elliott]] as Milly Theale\n* [[Linus Roache]] as Merton Densher\n* [[Elizabeth McGovern]] as Susan Stringham\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Aunt Maude\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Lionel Croy\n* [[Alex Jennings]] as Lord Mark\n\n==Production==\nFilming for ''The Wings of the Dove'' took place over the summer of 1996, with eight weeks spent in London and six in Venice.<ref name=\"filmscouts\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmscouts.com/scripts/matinee.cfm?Film=win-dov&File=productn|title=The Wings of the Dove - About The Production|website=www.filmscouts.com|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> London exterior locations include [[Brompton Cemetery]] on the [[Fulham Road]]; [[Carlton House Terrace]] in [[St. James's]] (Aunt Maud's house); [[Freemasons' Hall, London|Freemasons' Hall]] in [[Great Queen Street]] (Merton's newspaper office); [[Kensington Gardens]]; the [[National Liberal Club]] in [[Whitehall]]; the [[Richmond Fellowship]]; and the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Old Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]]. [[Knebworth House]] in [[Hertfordshire]] stood in for Lord Mark's country estate, and [[Debenham House]] in [[Kensington]] for his London home. [[Syon House]] in London was used for the wedding reception scene early in the film. [[Shepperton Studios]] was used for the mock-ups of a platform tunnel and passageways representing both [[Green Park tube station|Dover Street]] and [[Knightsbridge tube station]]s.\n\nLocations in Venice include [[St. Mark's Square (Venice)|St. Mark's Square]] and the [[Palazzo Barbaro]].<ref>\u201cThe City of Falling Angels'', John Berendt, Penguin Books, 2006, pg.147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MrW5d7MZCgUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false], {{ISBN|1-59420-058-0}}</ref> The Palazzo Barbaro was where Henry James wrote the original novel and is believed to have inspired Millie's palazzo as it is described in the book.<ref name=\"filmscouts\"/>\n\nCostume designer [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] sought a clear distinction between the outfits the female characters wear in London and Venice, with the London costumes consisting of \"chic outfits with the daring feeling of contemporary high fashion, clothes that herald the start of the more provocative \"Twenties\" fashion\". In Venice, Powell sourced luxuriant, loose fitting gowns in lighter colors, reflecting a more \"ethnic, North African look\". Powell was inspired by the gowns of the early 20th century designer [[Mariano Fortuny (designer)|Fortuny]]; her goal was to reflect the freedom of the characters during their time in the city.<ref name=\"filmscouts\"/>\n\nA notable departure from Henry James\u2019 text is the inclusion of a sex scene late in the film, with Kate and Merton naked on a bed. \u201cWe went into that with our eyes open,\u201d Iain Softley said. \u201cWe had no qualms.

This is a breakthrough for Softley, whose earlier films ''[[Backbeat (film)|Backbeat]]'' and ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'' only hinted at the style and complexity he displays here, and a wonderful showcase for Roache, Elliott and Bonham Carter, who gives her best performance yet.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Edward Guthmann |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/11/14/DD57299.DTL |title=''San Francisco Chronicle'' review |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=1997-11-14 |access-date=2011-08-18}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Entertainment Weekly'', Owen Gleiberman graded the film A and observed it \"has a lush yet aching beauty that seems to saturate you as you watch it. I'm not just talking about visual beauty. I'm speaking of dramatic beauty, the exquisite moment-to-moment tension of characters who reveal themselves layer by layer, flowing from thought to feeling and back again, until thought and feeling become drama. Director Iain Softley has made one of the rare movies that evokes not just the essence of a great novel but the experience of it...''The Wings of the Dove'' is, I think, a great film ... that confirms the arrival of major screen talents: director Softley, who works with sublime sensitivity to the intricacies of self-deception; Bonham Carter and Roache, who create a dazzlingly intimate chemistry within the propriety of Jamesian manners; and ''[[The Spitfire Grill]]''<nowiki/>'s Alison Elliott, who, with her beatific charm and [[Mona Lisa]] smile, does one of the most difficult things an actress can \u2014 she brings goodness itself to life.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Owen Gleiberman |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,290185,00.html |title=''Entertainment Weekly'' review |publisher=Ew.com |date=1997-11-07 |access-date=2011-08-18}}</ref>\n\nDavid Stratton of ''Variety'' stated the film \"gives Helena Bonham Carter one of her best opportunities in a while, one which she seizes with relish, looking vibrant and totally convincing in her pivotal role...''The Wings of the Dove'' may be typical of the school of British literary cinema, but Softley's handling of several key elements, including an unusually frank love scene in the later stages, is always inventive.

''Wings'' is a masterful and deeply haunting film; it adds genuine relevance to a genre that typically leans toward the static.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Andrew|date=November 6\u201313, 1997|title=The Wings of the Dove|journal=Time Out New York|pages=83}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
