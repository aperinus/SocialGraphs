Largely based on [[Andrew Chaikin]]'s 1994 book, ''[[A Man on the Moon]]'', the series is known for its accurate telling of the story of Apollo and the [[special effect]]s under visual director Ernest D. Farino.\n\nThe series takes its title from, but is not based upon, the 1865 [[Jules Verne]] [[science fiction]] novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''. Hanks appears in every episode, introducing each of the first eleven.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Hanks-Earth-to-Moon-a-real-blast-3096849.php|title=Hanks' \"Earth to Moon' a real blast|last1=Goodman|first1=Tim|newspaper=SF Gate|date=April 3, 1998}}</ref> The last episode is represented in a pseudo-[[Documentary film|documentary]] format narrated by [[Blythe Danner]], interspersed with a reenactment of the making of [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]' 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon|Le Voyage dans la Lune]]'', which was in part inspired by Verne's novel. Hanks narrates and appears in these scenes as M\u00e9li\u00e8s' assistant.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of From the Earth to the Moon cast members}}\nThe miniseries has a fairly large cast, driven in part by the fact that it portrays 30 of the [[List of Apollo astronauts|32 astronauts who flew, or were preparing to fly, the twelve missions]] of the [[Apollo program]]. (The only two Apollo astronauts not portrayed by credited actors are [[Apollo 13]] [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] pilot [[Jack Swigert]], who is heard but not seen in Episode 8, and [[Apollo 17]] Command Module pilot [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]], who has a brief appearance in the liftoff scene of [[Apollo 17]] in the final episode.) Members of many of the astronauts' families, and other [[NASA]] and non-NASA personnel, are also portrayed.\n\nSeveral fictional (or fictionalized) characters are also included, notably television newscaster Emmett Seaborn ([[Lane Smith]]) who appears in nine of the twelve episodes.\n\nAstronaut [[David Scott]], from [[Apollo 15]], was the chief technological consultant.<ref name=nyt2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/06/arts/television-from-earth-to-the-moon-and-back-for-more-bows.html|title=Television; From Earth to the Moon and Back, for More Bows|last1=Nichols|first1=Peter M.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 6, 1998}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\nThe twelve episodes, each directed by different individuals, use a variety of viewpoints and themes, while sequentially covering the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs. [[Lane Smith]] portrays Emmett Seaborn, a seasoned reporter for a fictional television network, who covers the U.S. space program from its earliest days, providing continuity for most of the episodes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#191970; color:#ffffff; width:6%;\"|No.\n! style=\"background:#191970; color:#ffffff;\" |Title\n! style=\"background:#191970; color:#ffffff;\" |Directed by\n! style=\"background:#191970; color:#ffffff;\" |Written by\n! style=\"background:#191970; color:#ffffff;\" |Original air date\n|-\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=1\n| Title=Can We Do This?\n| DirectedBy=[[Tom Hanks]]<ref name=flyhim>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/36481361/the_los_angeles_times/|title=Fly Him to the Moon|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles, California|date=April 5, 1998|page=390|via=Newspapers.com|last1=Brownfield|first1=Paul}}</ref>\n| WrittenBy=Steven Katz\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1998|4|5}}<ref name=flyhim />\n| ShortSummary=Covers the early years of the United States' \"[[Space Race]]\" with the [[Soviet Union]], including the creation of [[NASA]] and the decision to send men to the Moon.

Veteran [[television|TV]] spaceflight reporter Emmett Seaborn ([[Lane Smith]]) is summoned to broadcast the breaking news of the in-flight failure, as young reporter Brett Hutchings ([[Jay Mohr]]) is pulled off of sports to help with the coverage. As the crisis unfolds, Seaborn finds himself at odds with Hutchings' style of sensationalizing its impact on the astronauts' families, and criticizing NASA. Seaborn starts to feel he is being marginalized when the network decides to leave Hutchings on location in Houston, while sending him back to headquarters to provide only background coverage. The last straw falls when, after the successful recovery of the astronauts, Hutchings horns in on his traditional post-flight interview with flight controller [[Gene Kranz]]. Seaborn leaves dejectedly, not to be seen again until the flight of [[Apollo 17]] in the final episode.\n| LineColor=191970  }}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=9\n| Title=For Miles and Miles\n| DirectedBy=[[Gary Fleder]]\n| WrittenBy=Erik Bork\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1998|5|3}}\n| ShortSummary=In 1964, while riding high on his fame as America's first man in space and his expected command of the first Gemini mission, [[Alan Shepard]] is suddenly struck with [[M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease]], characterized by vertigo and nausea. Flight operations director [[Deke Slayton]] must ground him, but offers him the job of chief astronaut, effectively making Shepard Slayton's assistant as supervisor of all the astronauts. A few years later, a surgeon tries an experimental surgery which cures Shepard's symptoms, and he is returned to the flight rotation, commanding [[Apollo 14]] in early 1971, which accomplishes Apollo 13's failed Fra Mauro landing. Shepard brings a [[iron (golf)|six-iron golf club]] head on board, which he fastens to a soil-collecting tool handle and uses to hit a ball \"for miles and miles\".\n| LineColor=191970  }}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=10\n| Title=Galileo Was Right\n| DirectedBy=[[David Carson (director)|David Carson]]\n| WrittenBy=Jeffrey Fiskin<br />Remi Aubuchon\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1998|5|3}}\n| ShortSummary=[[NASA Astronaut Group 4|Scientist astronaut]] [[Harrison Schmitt|Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt]], a geologist, persuades his mentor, professor [[Leon Silver|Lee Silver]], to train the Apollo astronauts in selecting appropriate rock samples to collect through field experience, rather than the boring classroom lectures NASA has been using. Silver takes the four [[Apollo 15]] prime and backup landing crew members ([[David Scott]], [[James Irwin]], [[Richard F.

Schmitt is disappointed to learn his own Apollo 18 flight will be cancelled, but he still believes the training of the other astronauts is vital. It pays off when Scott and Irwin find the \"[[Genesis Rock]]\", originally believed to come from the Moon's primordial crust. The title refers to Scott's reproduction of an experiment proving [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s hypothesis that [[Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment|gravity will cause bodies]] of differing masses to fall at the same rate in a vacuum, by dropping a hammer and a feather.\n| LineColor=191970  }}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=11\n| Title=The Original Wives Club\n| DirectedBy=[[Sally Field]]\n| WrittenBy=Karen Janszen<br />Tom Hanks<br />Erik Bork\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1998|5|10}}\n| ShortSummary=Shows the Apollo program from the point of view of the nine wives of [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|NASA's second group of astronauts]], from 1962 beyond the end of the program. The burdens placed on them include maintaining a home while presenting a positive image to the news media, shielding their husbands from any family concerns which could affect their position in the flight rotation or ability to return to Earth safely, and comforting each other in the face of tragedies which kill [[Elliot See]] and Ed White.

Simulated interviews of various characters such as Emmett Seaborn and flight director [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr.]], in old-age makeup, are included. The documentary is interspersed with the story of early French film maker [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]' creation of his vision of a trip to the Moon, the 1902 ''[[A Trip to the Moon|Le Voyage dans la Lune]]''. Scenes from the original film are merged with the recreation of its filming.| LineColor=191970  }}\n|}\n\n==Integration with existing films==\nThe miniseries, concentrating on the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] space program, was produced with an intent not to repeat other dramatic portrayals of events of the space race.\n\n[[Project Mercury]], which was portrayed in the 1983 film ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'', was briefly summarized in the first episode.  Miniseries producers Hanks, Howard and Grazer, who had previously produced the 1995 film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', shot the episode \"We Interrupt This Program\" from the perspective of the media covering that flight, as the film had already covered the story from the point of view of the crew and the mission control team.\n\n==Production==\nMany of the actors had opportunity to interact and form friendships with the real life astronauts they were portraying. [[Brett Cullen]], who played [[Apollo 9]] [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] pilot and [[Apollo 15]] commander [[David Scott]], was invited to the Scott family home each time an episode he appeared in was first televised. Two short clips from the final scenes of ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' were used in \"That's All There Is\"; a splashdown sequence, and a view of the recovery ship [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']] (portrayed by [[USS New Orleans (LPH-11)|USS ''New Orleans'']]).\n\nThe original series was shot in [[Super 35]], intended to be viewed on standard television sets of the time in 1.33:1 aspect ratio. With the proliferation of widescreen flat-panel TV sets the series was remastered in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio and re-released in 2005 as a 5-disc DVD box set. As is the case with most material shot in this format, the widescreen framing causes the loss (in some shots) of the top and bottom parts of the frames from the original broadcast, but reveals additional information on the left and right. This is not always noticeable because of careful transfer process, but in some scenes important details are lost. For example, in the first episode, when the Gemini 8 / Agena assembly is tumbling around in space with a stuck thruster, the thruster is not visible in the new widescreen version, as it is cut off by the top of the frame. Some captions have also been compromised.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/review/R14N5WVCNCBTH2/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm|title=From the Earth to the Moon: 2005 Signature Series DVD Box set, user's comments|website=Amazon }}</ref>{{Better source needed|date= July 2019}}\n\nParts of the miniseries were filmed at the Disney-MGM Studios (now [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]]) in Orlando, Florida.  Scenes of the moonwalks were shot inside the blimp hangars on a former Marine base in Tustin, California. Approximately half the area inside was converted to the Moon's surface, with the remainder used to hold production trailers. To simulate lunar [[surface gravity]], weather balloons filled with helium were attached to the backs of the actors playing the astronauts in the lunar [[extravehicular activity]] scenes, effectively reducing their weights to one-sixth.\n\nThe score of \"Spider\" prominently features an imitation of the main title theme from the 1963 [[World War II]] movie ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', and Tom Kelly jokes about having a crew digging a tunnel out of the Grumman plant. The episode also featured a real [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM-13), which had been built for the Apollo 18 mission but was never used due to budget cuts.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nThe series was nominated for seventeen Emmy awards and won three: [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries|Outstanding Miniseries]], [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Miniseries, Movie, or a Special|Outstanding Casting for a Miniseries or a Movie]] and Outstanding Hairstyling for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/36481190/dayton_daily_news/|title=HBO Series Gets 17 Emmy Nominations|newspaper=Dayton Daily News|location=Dayton, Ohio|date=July 24, 1998|page=17|via=Newspapers.com|last1=Elber|first1=Lynn|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> In addition, the series won a 1999 [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3%;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:22%;\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:33%;\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:35%;\"| Nominee(s)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:6%;\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:1%;\"| {{Abbr|Ref.|References}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"40\"|1998\n| [[American Cinema Editors Awards]]\n| [[American Cinema Editors Award for Best Edited Miniseries or Motion Picture for Television|Best Edited Episode from a Television Mini-Series]]\n| Richard Pearson {{small|(for \"1968\")}}\n| {{nom}}\n| \n|-\n| [[ADG Excellence in Production Design Awards|Art Directors Guild Awards]]\n| [[Art Directors Guild Award for Excellence in Production Design for a Television Movie or Limited Series|Excellence in Production Design Award - Television Movie or Mini-Series]]\n| Richard Toyon, Kitty Doris-Bates, Seth Reed\n| {{won}}\n| \n|-\n| [[4th Critics' Choice Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]]\n| Best Picture Made for Television\n| ''From the Earth to the Moon''\n| {{won}}\n| <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9901/26/broadcast.film.awards/ |title=Broadcast Film critics name 'Saving Private Ryan' best film |last=Clinton |first=Paul |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=January 26, 1999 |access-date=September 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305021108/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9901/26/broadcast.film.awards/ |url-status=live |archive-date=March 5, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Cinema Audio Society Awards]]\n| [[Cinema Audio Society Award for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for Television Movie or Limited Series|Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for Television - Movie of the Week, Mini-Series or Specials]]\n| [[Joe Foglia]], Kevin Patrick Burns, Todd Orr {{small|(for \"Le Voyage Dans La Lune\")}}\n| {{won}}\n| \n|-\n| [[Costume Designers Guild Awards]]\n| Excellence in Costume Design for Television\n| [[Chrisi Karvonides-Dushenko]]\n| {{nom}}\n| \n|-\n| [[51st Directors Guild of America Awards|Directors Guild of America Awards]]\n| [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Miniseries or TV Film|Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing Achievement in Miniseries or TV Film]]\n| [[Jon Turteltaub]] {{small|(for \"That's All There Is\")}}\n| {{nom}}\n| <ref>{{cite web|title=DGA Announces Nominees for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Movies for Television for 1998|url=https://www.dga.org/News/PressReleases/1999/0201-DGA-Announces-Nominees-for-Outstanding-Directorial-Achievement-in-Movies.aspx|publisher=Directors Guild of America|access-date=February 4, 2018|date=February 1, 1999}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[56th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]]\n| [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Miniseries or Television Film]]\n| ''From the Earth to the Moon''\n| {{won}}\n| <ref>{{cite news|last1=Higgins|first1=Bill|title=Globes 'In Love' and war|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/globes-in-love-and-war-1117490584/|access-date=11 January 2018|work=Variety|date=24 January 1999}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[10th Golden Laurel Awards|Producers Guild of America Awards]]\n| [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Long-Form Television|Best Long-Form Television]]\n| [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tony To]], [[John Melfi|John P.
