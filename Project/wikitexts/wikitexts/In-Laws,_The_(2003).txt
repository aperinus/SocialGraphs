Her father is mild-mannered foot doctor, Jerry Peyser. When the two families meet for dinner, Peyser stumbles on to Steve Tobias' secret operation as Tobias tries to set up a deal to sell a Russian submarine, the Olga, to an arms smuggler in France as bait to catch arms smugglers. As Peyser's incidental involvement increases, he is suspected by the FBI of being part of a seemingly malicious deal. Peyser does not want to be involved in the deal or with Tobias' family but is either dragged in against his will or tricked into participating in wild escapades with Tobias. The two future fathers-in-law end up dodging bullets, jumping off buildings, and stealing jets together as they attempt to avoid capture by the FBI. After the wedding reception is ended by a last chase scene, they are finally left alone with only their children and wives to have a quiet marriage ceremony, presided over by the FBI agent who was chasing them.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Steve Tobias\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Jerry Peyser\n* [[Robin Tunney]] as Angela Harris\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as  Mark Tobias\n* [[Candice Bergen]] as Judy Tobias\n* [[Lindsay Sloane]] as Melissa Peyser\n* Maria Ricossa as Katherine Peyser\n* [[David Suchet]] as Jean-Pierre Thibodoux\n* Vladimir Radian as Cherkasov\n* Michael Bodnar as Cherkasov's Bodyguard\n* [[Boyd Banks]] as Patient\n* [[Susan Aceron]] as Nurse\n* Chang Tseng as Quan Le\n* [[Tamara Gorski]] as Yadira\n* Matt Birman as Agent at Restaurant\n* Russell Andrews as Agent Will Hutchins\n* [[Richard Waugh (actor)|Richard Waugh]] as Agent Thorn\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Person in the Background\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''The In-Laws'' had a mixed to negative critical reception.
