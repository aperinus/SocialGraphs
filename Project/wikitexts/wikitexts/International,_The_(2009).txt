Starring [[Clive Owen]] and [[Naomi Watts]], the film follows an [[Interpol]] agent and an American district attorney who jointly investigate [[Political corruption|corruption]] within the IBBC, a fictional [[merchant bank]] based in [[Luxembourg]]. It serves [[organized crime]] and corrupt governments as a banker and as an [[weapons industry|arms broker]]. The bank's ruthless managers assassinate potential threats, including their own employees.\n\nInspired by the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI) scandal of the 1980s, the film raises concerns about how global finance affects [[international politics]] across the world. Production began in [[Berlin]] in September 2008, including the construction of a life-size replica of New York's [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] for the film's central shootout scene. The film opened the [[59th Berlin International Film Festival]] on 5 February 2009. The [[Rotten Tomatoes]] critical consensus praised the action sequences and locations but criticized the plot.<ref name=RT/>\n\n==Plot==\nLouis Salinger, an [[Interpol]] detective, and Eleanor Whitman, an [[New York County District Attorney|Assistant District Attorney]] from [[Manhattan]], are assigned to investigate the International Bank of Business and Credit (IBBC), which funds criminal activities such as [[money laundering]], [[terrorism]], [[Arms trafficking|arms trading]], and the destabilization of governments. Salinger's and Whitman's investigation takes them to [[Milan]], where the IBBC assassinates Umberto Calvini, an arms manufacturer and [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian prime ministerial]] candidate. The assassin diverts suspicion to a local assassin with political connections, who is then promptly killed by a corrupt [[Carabinieri|policeman]]. Salinger and Whitman get a lead on the second assassin, but the policeman confronts the two and orders them out of the country. At the airport, they are able to check the security camera footage for clues on the whereabouts of the bank's assassin, and follow a suspect to [[New York City]].\n\nIn New York, Salinger and Whitman are met by two [[New York Police Department]] (NYPD) detectives, Iggy Ornelas and Bernie Ward, who have a photograph of the assassin's face. Salinger, Ornelas, and Ward locate Dr. Isaacson to whose practice the assassin's [[leg brace]] has been traced, and they are able to follow him to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]].\n\nJonas Skarssen, the chairman of the IBBC, reveals to his superiors White and Wexler that Calvini was killed so that they could have his sons buy [[missile guidance]] systems in which the bank has invested. Since the bank knows that Salinger and Whitman are close to finding their assassin, they send a team of hitmen to kill him, while Wexler is arrested by Ornelas. As Salinger and Ward speak to the assassin and attempt to arrest him, a shootout at the Guggenheim erupts when a number of gunmen attack them. Ward is killed in the chaos, and Salinger is forced to team up with the assassin to fight off the gunmen. However, the assassin is mortally wounded during their escape and dies of his injuries.\n\nWhen Salinger goes to interrogate Wexler, he reveals that the IBBC is practically untouchable due to its connections to terrorist organizations, drug cartels, governments, and powerful corporations, though Wexler indicates a willingness to help Salinger take down the IBBC. Meanwhile, Salinger persuades Whitman to let him continue alone.\n\nIn Italy, Salinger tells Calvini's sons of the IBBC's responsibility for their father's murder, prompting them to cancel the deal with the bank and order White to be killed. Salinger then accompanies Wexler to [[Istanbul]], where Skarssen is buying the guidance systems from their only other manufacturer, Ahmet Sunay. Salinger attempts to record the conversation so that he can obstruct the deal by proving to the buyers that the missiles will be useless, but he ultimately fails. Both Wexler and Skarssen are then killed by a hitman contracted by the Calvinis to avenge their father's murder. Salinger is left stunned, his investigation, pursuit, and determination to bring down the IBBC having led to nothing.\n\nAfterwards, the bank successfully continues its operations despite the death of Skarssen, as he had predicted to Salinger before he was killed. However, with the new and more aggressive chairman, the IBBC's increased expansion and aggression ultimately lead to greater scrutiny, leading to a [[United States Senate]] investigation headed by Whitman.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Louis Salinger\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Eleanor Whitman\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Wilhelm Wexler\n* [[Ulrich Thomsen]] as Jonas Skarssen\n* Michel Voletti as Viktor Haas\n* [[Patrick Baladi]] as Martin White\n* Jay Villiers as Francis Ehames\n* Fabrice Scott as Nicolai Yeshinski\n* [[Haluk Bilginer]] as Ahmet Sunay\n* [[Luca Barbareschi]] as Umberto Calvini\n* Alessandro Fabrizi as Inspector Alberto Cerutti\n* [[Axel Milberg]] as Klaus Diemer\n* [[Br\u00edan F.
