It is based on [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]]'s 1994 [[Prozac Nation|memoir of the same name]], which describes Wurtzel's experiences with [[atypical depression]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Prozac Nation: Young and Depressed in America|last=Wurtzel|first=Elizabeth|publisher=[[Riverhead Trade]]|year=1994|location=New York|page=298|isbn=978-0-39-568093-3|quote=The McLean people have recommended fluoxetine because they have diagnosed me with atypical depression.}}</ref> The title is a reference to [[Prozac]], the brand name of an [[antidepressant]] she was prescribed.\n\n==Plot==\nElizabeth \"Lizzie\" Wurtzel is a 19-year-old accepted into [[Harvard]] with a scholarship in journalism. She has been raised by her divorced mother since she was two years old and has not seen her father at all in the last four years. Despite his lack of interest and involvement, Lizzie still misses her father, a contributing factor to her depression. Through a series of flashbacks, it is clear that there was a total communication breakdown between Lizzie's parents, which is soon reflected in Lizzie's own relationship with her mother.\n\nSoon after arriving at Harvard, Lizzie decides to lose her virginity to an older student, Noah. Lizzie proceeds to alienate Noah by throwing a loss-of-virginity party immediately afterwards with the help of her roommate Ruby. Although she and Lizzie begin as best friends, Ruby soon becomes another casualty of Lizzie's instability. Although Lizzie's article for the local music column in ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' is presented an award by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' early into the semester, Lizzie soon finds herself unable to write, stuck in a vicious cycle with substance abuse. She begins a relationship with another student, Rafe, but after travelling to his home in Texas and discovering that his sister has an intellectual disability, Lizzie accuses Rafe of being 'a creepy voyeur' who gets off on witnessing the pain of others. Rafe breaks up with her.\n\nLizzie's promising literary career is at risk, as is her mental and physical health. Her mother sends her to expensive psychiatric sessions towards which her father, pleading poverty, implacably refuses to contribute anything at all. After a long period of treatment under medication and a [[Parasuicide|suicidal gesture]], Lizzie stabilizes and begins to adjust to her life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]]\n** Zoe Miller as young Elizabeth Wurtzel\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Rafe\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Dr. Sterling\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Ruby\n* [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as Noah\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Lynne Wurtzel\n* [[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]] as Sam\n* [[Nicholas Campbell]] as Donald Wurtzel, Elizabeth's father\n* [[Lou Reed]] as himself\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 8, 2001 (three days before the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attack]]); distribution rights were acquired by [[Miramax Films]] with the intent of giving the film a wider theatrical release.

And I think the reason Miramax has struggled is the fact that it doesn't have a traditional dramatic structure, in terms of a clear, unqualified ending. Look at the book: Elizabeth is very clear that Prozac has helped her, but you're left with a dilemma, because perhaps she no longer knows who she is. We didn't want to come down heavily on one side or the other. People who've experienced depression like that aspect of the film, but a lot of people don't like it. Miramax certainly don't seem to like it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/18/features.review|title=Release me|access-date=8 March 2013|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=John|last=Harris|date=18 July 2004}}</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received generally negative reviews, scoring a 29% on the film aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prozac_nation|title=Prozac Nation (2001)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nWhat follows is a list of the songs that were played according to the end credits.\n\n# \"The Promise\" \u2013 [[Bruce Springsteen]]\n# \"Mystery Achievement\" \u2013 [[The Pretenders]]\n# \"I Will Dare\" \u2013 [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]]\n# \"[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]\" \u2013 [[Lou Reed]]\n# \"[[Sweet Jane]]\" \u2013 Lou Reed\n# \"Keep the Promise\" \u2013 [[The Pontiac Brothers]]\n# \"Ivory Tower\" \u2013 [[The Long Ryders]]\n# \"Who Is Who\" \u2013 [[Adolescents (band)|Adolescents]]\n# \"The Real West\" \u2013 [[Thin White Rope]]\n# \"Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse\" \u2013 [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.miramax.com/movie/prozac-nation/}}\n* {{IMDb title|0236640|Prozac Nation}}\n* {{AllMovie title|255213|Prozac Nation}}\n\n{{Erik Skjoldbj\u00e6rg}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2001 drama films]]\n[[Category:2001 independent films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:American psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:Eli Lilly and Company]]\n[[Category:Films about bipolar disorder]]\n[[Category:Films about depression]]\n[[Category:Films about virginity]]\n[[Category:Films based on memoirs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Erik Skjoldbj\u00e6rg]]\n[[Category:Films set in Harvard University]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Boston]]\n[[Category:Films shot in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:German psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
