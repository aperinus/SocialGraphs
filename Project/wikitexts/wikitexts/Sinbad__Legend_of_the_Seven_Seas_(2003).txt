Like ''[[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]]'', it combines [[traditional animation]] with some [[computer animation]], and was directed by [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] and Patrick Gilmore (in the latter's directorial debut) and written by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], and stars the voices of [[Brad Pitt]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], and [[Joseph Fiennes]]. It covers the story of [[Sinbad the Sailor|Sinbad]] (voiced by Pitt), a pirate who travels the sea with his dog and his loyal crew, alongside Marina (voiced by Zeta-Jones), the fianc\u00e9e of his childhood friend Prince [[Proteus]] (voiced by Fiennes), to recover the stolen Book of Peace from [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] (voiced by Pfeiffer) to save Proteus from accepting Sinbad's death sentence. The film blends elements from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and [[classical mythology]].\n\n''Sinbad'' was released on July 2, 2003, and received mixed reviews from critics, praising the animation, action scenes, and voice performances but criticized the storyline and polarizing CGI. Grossing $80.8 million on a $60 million budget, ''Sinbad'' was a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]]. DreamWorks suffered a $125 million loss on a string of films, which nearly bankrupted them. To date, this is the final DreamWorks Animation film to use [[traditional animation]], as the studio abandoned that in favor of [[computer animation]].<ref name=LATWakeUpCall /> However, DreamWorks brought 2D animation back for the 5-minute short film ''[[Bird Karma]]'' in 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\nSinbad and his pirate crew attempt to steal the magical \"Book of Peace\" and hold it for ransom as one last job before retiring to [[Fiji]]. Sinbad is surprised to see it is being protected while on board to [[Syracuse, Sicily]] by Prince Proteus of Syracuse. Proteus was Sinbad's best friend as a child, and he tells him that if their friendship ever meant anything to Sinbad, he can prove it now. Sinbad tries to steal the book anyway, but is prevented when [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] attacks the ship. The two work together to fight off Cetus and for a moment reaffirm their bond. Just when it seems the beast is defeated, Sinbad is dragged off the ship. Proteus goes to save Sinbad, but he is stopped by his crew.\n\nDrawn underwater by Cetus, Sinbad is saved by the beautiful Goddess of Discord, [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], who offers him any boon he desires in exchange for the Book of Peace. Sinbad and his crew go to Syracuse to steal the Book, but after seeing Proteus with his fianc\u00e9 Lady Marina, Sinbad abandons the mission without giving a motive. Anticipating this, Eris impersonates Sinbad and steals the Book herself. Sinbad is sentenced to death, whereupon Proteus sends Sinbad to retrieve the Book instead, [[Damon and Pythias|placing himself as a hostage]], and Marina goes to make sure that Sinbad succeeds. To prevent them from succeeding, Eris sends a group of mythical [[Sirens (mythology)|siren]]s, who entrance and seduce the men aboard Sinbad's ship with their hypnotic singing voices, but do not affect Marina, who pilots the ship to safety and wins the favor of the crew. However, as she and Sinbad continue to argue with each other, Eris notices their disharmony and sends in a [[Roc (mythology)|roc]]. The Roc captures Marina, but she is rescued by Sinbad, and they successfully defeat the creature, causing a reconciliation between the two.\n\nAfter these and other incidents, Sinbad and Marina talk in a brief moment of peace - Marina reveals that she's always dreamed of a life on the sea, and Sinbad reveals that he distanced himself from Proteus 10 years earlier because he loved Marina. They suddenly then reach and enter Eris' realm where she reveals that her plan was to maneuver Proteus into Sinbad's place, leaving Syracuse without an [[heir]] to collapse into chaos. Through Marina, Eris agrees to surrender the Book of Peace only if Sinbad truthfully tells whether he will return to Syracuse to accept blame and be executed if he does not get the Book. She gives him her word that she will honor the deal, making it unbreakable even for a god. When he answers that he will return, Eris calls him a liar, and returns him and Marina to the mortal world. Ashamed, Sinbad admits the Goddess of Discord is right, truly believing deep down that he is a selfish, black-hearted liar. Only, for Marina to tell him she is wrong, giving Sinbad a change of heart.\n\nIn Syracuse, the time allotted to Sinbad has elapsed. Proteus readies himself to be beheaded, but at the last minute, Sinbad appears and takes his place. An enraged Eris appears suddenly and saves Sinbad by shattering the executioner's sword to pieces. Sinbad, shocked, realizes that this was still part of her test and that he has beaten her by proving his answer to be true after all. Eris is furious but cannot go back on her word as a goddess, and begrudgingly gives the book to Sinbad. With the true culprit revealed, Sinbad is pardoned for the crime of stealing the book and is now well-respected.\n\nWith the Book restored to Syracuse, Proteus and Sinbad leave still as the best of friends. Sinbad and his crew prepare to leave on another voyage, leaving Marina in Syracuse. Unbeknownst to him, Proteus sees that Marina has fallen deeply in love with Sinbad and life on the sea, and releases her from their engagement, sending her to join Sinbad's ship. Marina surprises Sinbad by revealing her presence on the ship just as it begins to sail, and the two share a kiss. Now together, they and the crew set out on another long voyage as the ship sails into the sunset.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n*[[Brad Pitt]] as [[Sinbad the Sailor|Sinbad]], an adventurous pirate and sailor who plans on retiring to [[Fiji]].\n*[[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Lady Marina, a [[Thracian]] ambassador to Syracuse, Proteus\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and Sinbad\u2019s love interest. \n*[[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the beautiful and manipulative Goddess of Discord and Chaos who wants to create destruction throughout the world.\n*[[Joseph Fiennes]] as Prince Proteus of Syracuse, Sinbad's noble childhood-friend and Marina's fianc\u00e9.\n*[[Dennis Haysbert]] as Kale, Sinbad's [[Chief mate|first mate]].\n*[[Adriano Giannini]] as \"Rat\", an Italian lookout of Sinbad's crew.\n*[[Timothy West]] as King Dymas of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], Proteus\u2019 father.\n*[[Jim Cummings]] as Luca, an elderly member of Sinbad's crew and The Ambassador leader.\n*[[Conrad Vernon]] as Jed, a comically heavily armed member of Sinbad's crew.\n* [[Raman Hui]] as Jin, an Asian member of Sinbad's crew who frequently makes bets with Li.\n*Chung Chan as Li, an Asian member of Sinbad's crew who frequently makes bets with Jin.\n*Andrew Birch as Grum and Chum, members of Sinbad's crew.\n* [[Frank Welker]] (uncredited) as Spike, Sinbad's pet mastiff who Marina grows a soft spot for.\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Tower Guard.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nShortly after co-writing ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992) for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]], screenwriters [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] came up with the idea of adapting the story of [[Sinbad the Sailor]] in the vein of the story of [[Damon and Pythias]] before settling on a [[love triangle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rossio|first=Terry|url=http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp47.100.Million.Mistake.html|title=The One Hundred Million Dollar Mistake|website=Wordplayer|access-date=July 25, 2019}}</ref> They wrote a treatment inspired by [[screwball comedy film|screwball]] [[romantic comedy]] films with Sinbad as a reserved apprentice cartographer who joins Peri, a free-spirited female smuggler, on an adventure and falls in love.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp37-xtras/wp37x.SINBAD.html|title=Sinbad: 2/8/94 Treatment|website=Wordplayer|access-date=July 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview|url=http://mjsimpson-films.blogspot.com/2013/04/interview-ted-elliott-and-terry-rossio.html|title=Interview: Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio|interviewer=MJ Simpson|subject=Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|date=April 27, 2013|access-date=July 25, 2019}}</ref> The story was based largely on the 'Simbad' comic book written and illustrated by Elena Poirier (1949-1956).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Simbad: el gran amigo del Peneca: a\u00f1o 1, n\u00fameros del 1-17, del 8 de noviembre al 28 de diciembre de 1949 - Memoria Chilena|url=http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-553856.html|access-date=August 30, 2021|website=Memoria Chilena: Portal|language=es}}</ref> In July 1992, Disney had announced they were adapting the story into a potential animated feature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-02/features/9202290009_1_songs-aladdin-studio-chairman-jeffrey-katzenberg|title='Odyssey,' Sinbad, Pocahontas Getting Disney Treatment|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 2, 1992|access-date=July 25, 2019}}</ref> The project was cancelled in 1993.\n\nIn 1994, after [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] founded DreamWorks and started ''[[The Prince of Egypt|Prince of Egypt]]''{{'}}s works, he decided to re-start some ideas that Disney cancelled, like ''[[The Road to El Dorado]]'' or ''[[Sinbad]]''; he involved ''[[Antz]]''{{'}}s director [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] in the making of an animated feature about Sinbad the Sailor.\nShortly after writing ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000), [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]] was approached by Katzenberg to write the script for an animated film.
