[[Amy Adams]] received an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Academy Award]] nomination for her supporting role in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen art dealer Madeleine ([[Embeth Davidtz]]) travels from Chicago to [[North Carolina]] to pursue a local, self-taught painter (Frank Hoyt Taylor) for her [[outsider art]] gallery, she takes the opportunity to meet and stay with the family of her new husband George ([[Alessandro Nivola]]), who live close by.\n\nThere is his mother Peg ([[Celia Weston]]); his reserved, contemplative father Eugene ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]); and his sullen, resentful, twenty-ish brother Johnny ([[Ben McKenzie]]) who, although married, lives at home. He is studying for his high school equivalency certificate while working at [[Replacements, Ltd.]] as an order processor. Johnny married his now pregnant wife Ashley ([[Amy Adams]]) before either of them finished high school. Relations between Johnny and Ashley are strained, with Ashley believing that a baby will solve their marital problems.\n\nMadeleine and George stay in the expected baby's nursery, and Madeleine becomes friends with Ashley, who is very sweet and friendly, if somewhat naive and talkative. The family takes Madeleine to a church social, where George is asked to sing a hymn. Madeleine is not used to intense religious displays but makes no comment. She attends Ashley's [[baby shower]] and gives her sister-in-law an antique silver spoon, which stands out from the other gifts. Madeleine discovers that she does not know much about George, as they have been married only six months and knew each other only a week before they got married.\n\nThe artist Madeleine is pursuing wavers over signing with her gallery. Ashley goes into labor, and the family goes to the hospital with her. Madeleine chooses to go and convince the artist to sign with her gallery, which briefly makes George angry.  Madeleine calls George to rave about the artist (she is impressed with his work, but shocked by his anti-semitism) without asking about the baby.  George interrupts her and informs her that Ashley's baby boy is [[stillbirth|stillborn]], which causes Madeleine to double over with guilt. The artist and his sister drive Madeleine back to her in-laws' home, and she later sits with Eugene on the back porch and cries. Meanwhile, George supports Ashley at the hospital, who expresses that George is always there when Ashley needs him. George kisses Ashley on the forehead and leaves. George comes home and has a wordless encounter in the garage with his brother, Johnny, who throws a tool at him, injuring his forehead. George does nothing in response.\n\nThe next day, George and Madeleine prepare to leave. Johnny calls Ashley and suggests that they \"try again,\" to which Ashley excitedly squeals. As George and Madeleine drive onto the highway and pick up speed, George remarks, \"I'm so glad we're out of there\" as Madeleine caresses George's neck with her left hand.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Madeleine Johnsten\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Ashley Johnsten\n* [[Ben McKenzie]] as Johnny Johnsten\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Peg Johnsten\n* [[Alessandro Nivola]] as George Johnsten\n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as Eugene Johnsten\n* Frank Hoyt Taylor as David Wark, the artist\n* Joanne Pankow as Sissy Wark, David's sister\n* Alicia Van Couvering as Bernadette, Madeleine's gallery assistant\n* [[Jill Wagner]] as Millicent, friend at baby shower\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot on [[Super 16mm]] film stock.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Epoch Films Presents Junebug - Sony Pictures Press Release |url=https://www.sonyclassics.com/junebug/_content/downloads/junebug_presskit.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Leydon |first=Joe |date=2005-02-10 |title=Junebug |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/awards/junebug-1200528076/ |access-date=2022-03-17 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Junebug'' was well received among critics.
