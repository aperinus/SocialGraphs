The film focuses on [[television]] [[reporter]] Lanie Kerrigan ([[Angelina Jolie]]) and her quest to find meaning in her life. The original music score was composed by [[David Newman (composer)|David Newman]].\n\n==Plot==\nLanie Kerrigan, a successful reporter for a Seattle television station, interviews a self-proclaimed [[prophet]], Jack, to find out if he really can predict football scores. Instead, Prophet Jack not only predicts the football score, and that it will [[hail]] the next day, but also that Lanie will die in seven days, on the following Thursday. When his first two prophecies come true, Lanie panics and again meets with Jack to ask for another prophecy to test him again. Jack tells her that there will be a relatively significant [[earthquake]] in [[San Francisco]] at 9:06 am, which also happens. Now Lanie is convinced that she is going to die and is forced to reevaluate her life.\n\nLanie tries to find consolation in her famous [[baseball player]] boyfriend Cal Cooper and in her family, but there is little there. Her lifelong ambition of appearing on network television begins to look like a distant dream. In her desperation, she commits professional blunders but ends up finding support in an unlikely source: her archenemy, the cameraman Pete Scanlon, with whom she once had [[casual sex]]. He introduces her to a new approach to life: to live every moment of her life to the fullest and to do whatever she had always wanted to do. Lanie moves in with Pete for a day, and he introduces her to his son Tommy, who lives with his mother. They spend a whole day together with Tommy. That night Lanie and Pete sleep together for the second time. The next day Lanie receives an opportunity for a job she always dreamed of in [[New York City|New York]]. She asks Pete to come with her, but he declines, telling her that her appetite for success and fame will never end. Sadly, Lanie leaves for New York.\n\nPete meets Jack and tells him how wrong he is, as Lanie got the job which Jack foretold she would not get. However, Jack explains that he was right, as Lanie will never be able to get the job because she'll die before it begins. He also gives a prophecy of the death of a famous former baseball player in a plane crash. When Pete receives the news of the death of the baseball player, as foretold by Jack, he tries to call Lanie to warn her. He can't reach her, so he flies to New York.\n\nLanie - unconcerned with Jack's prophecy - interviews her idol, famous media personality Deborah Connors. Lanie realizes how petty the opening questions are and shares a heartfelt moment with Deborah live on air. The interview receives huge [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]. The network immediately offers her a position, but Lanie declines, realizing that she wants a life with Pete in Seattle.\n\nAs she leaves the studio, a police officer gets into a conflict with a man, who shoots a bullet into the air. Pete tries to warn Lanie from across the street, but she is shot in the crossfire. Lanie dies in the operating theatre but is revived. When she wakes up, Pete tells her that he has loved her since the first time he saw her, and Lanie tells him that she loves him too. Later, Pete, Lanie, and Tommy watch Cal's baseball game, while Lanie (in a voiceover) says that one part of her has died \u2014 the part that didn't know how to live a life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Lanie Kerrigan\n** Amy Esterle as 15-years-old Lanie Kerrigan (uncredited)\n** Marika Anuik as 10-years-old Lanie Kerrigan\n** Ashlyn Morgan Williams as 5-years-old Lanie Kerrigan\n* [[Edward Burns]] as Pete Scanlon\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Prophet Jack\n* [[Christian Kane]] as Cal Cooper\n* [[James Gammon]] as Pat Kerrigan\n* [[Melissa Errico]] as Andrea\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Deborah Connors\n* [[Lisa Thornhill]] as Gwen\n** Kasey Stevens as 5-years-old Gwem\n* [[Gregory Itzin]] as Dennis\n* [[Veena Sood]] as Doctor\n* [[Jesse James Rutherford]] as Tommy\n\n==KOMO-TV==\nThe majority of the movie was shot on location in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], although portions were also filmed in [[downtown Vancouver]], British Columbia.
