This one is 687 words. -->\nDavid Seville is seriously injured when a cardboard cutout of Alvin sends him flying across the stage during a charity benefit concert in Paris, [[France]]. While he recuperates in a French hospital, Dave asks his aunt, Jackie, to look after the Chipmunks, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. Arrangements are also made for them to attend West Eastman High School. After Jackie also has an accident at the airport, the Chipmunks are left in the care of Toby, Jackie's grandson and Dave's cousin.\n\nFormer JETT Records chief executive Ian Hawke, who is broke and destitute, lives in the company\u2019s basement. Three singing female chipmunks, Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor, a.k.a. the [[The Chipettes|Chipettes]], emerge from a FedEx package. Ian recruits the Chipettes to resurrect his career.\n\nWhile at school, two jealous jocks ridicule the Chipmunks and chase them around, flushing Simon's head in a toilet and poking at Theodore's backside. The Chipmunks are summoned to the principal's office after attacking the jocks. The principal, Dr. Rubin, who is a fan who saw them in Denver, Colorado, enlists their help to raise money for the school's music program by participating in a contest. Ian is shocked to find the Chipmunks on the front page of his newspaper. After he reads a story about them representing the school, he quickly enrolls the Chipettes at the same school.\n\nWhen the Chipmunks meet the Chipettes, both groups are smitten with each other. However, Brittany reminds the girls that Ian said the Chipmunks betrayed him and are untrustworthy. Alvin and the boys struggle to make it through a rehearsal because of their new crushes. Ian smugly walks in and introduces his new stars, the Chipettes. The boys are shocked to see the girls working with Ian, and a rivalry emerges when Ian convinces Dr. Rubin to let the Chipettes compete in the Battle of the Bands. Rubin sets up a concert for the two groups to compete to represent the school.\n\nAlvin becomes popular with the jocks and joins the football team, not realizing that the next game is during the concert. At the concert, Theodore and Simon tell the fans that Alvin failed to show up, and they cannot perform, leading to a victory for the Chipettes. Alvin arrives after the concert to an empty auditorium, and Brittany calls him out for his lack of responsibility. Alvin returns home and unsuccessfully tries apologizing to his brothers. Theodore runs away to the [[Los Angeles Zoo]] the next day. Alvin and Simon save him from a [[wedge-tailed eagle]], and the three make it out alive.\n\nSoon, the Chipettes are hired but learn they are to perform as an opening act for a [[Britney Spears]] concert on the same night as the school contest. Ian convinces them to call off the battle and perform at the concert, but refuses to give the same credit to Jeanette and Eleanor that he gives Brittany, who demands that they all perform together or not at all, until Ian threatens to send them to a barbecue restaurant unless they perform.\n\nBefore the Battle of the Bands, Alvin receives a panicked phone call from the Chipettes, who tell him that Ian has locked them in a cage. Alvin races off to rescue them while Simon tells Jeanette how to pick the lock over the phone. Simon and Theodore are on the verge of going out to perform just by themselves until the others arrive just in time to perform at the contest. The Chipmunks and the Chipettes perform together for the first time and win the money for the music program. Dave, who had left the hospital upon learning that Toby was looking after the Chipmunks, returns during the contest, happy to see the Chipmunks again, and allows the Chipettes to stay with them. Meanwhile, Ian sets up for the girls when he attempts to imitate the Chipettes, only for the security guards to throw him out of the arena and in a dumpster.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live-action cast===\n* [[Zachary Levi]] as Toby Seville\n* [[David Cross]] as Ian Hawke\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as [[Dave Seville|David \"Dave\" Seville]]\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Dr. Rubin\n* [[Anjelah Johnson]] as Julie Ortega\n* [[Kevin G.
