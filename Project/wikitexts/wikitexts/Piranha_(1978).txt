The film tells the story of a river being infested by lethal, genetically altered [[piranha]], threatening the lives of the local inhabitants and the visitors to a nearby summer resort.\n\nProduced by [[Roger Corman]], ''Piranha'' is  the first of [[Piranha (film series)|a series of low-budget B movies]] inspired by the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), which had been a major success for [[Universal Pictures]] and director [[Steven Spielberg]]. Initially, Universal had considered obtaining an [[injunction]] to prevent ''Piranha'' being released, particularly as they had released ''[[Jaws 2]]'' the same summer, but the lawsuit was dropped after Spielberg himself gave the film a positive comment in advance. Released on August 3, 1978, the film was a commercial success and later became a [[cult film]]. ''Piranha'' was followed by a sequel, ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'' (1982), and two remakes, [[Piranha (1995 film)|one in 1995]] and [[Piranha 3D|another in 2010]], which [[Piranha 3DD|spawned its own sequel in 2012]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[MOS:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->\nTwo teenagers find an abandoned military compound and [[Nude swimming|skinny dip]] in a holding pool, but are attacked and killed by an unseen force.\n\nSometime later, determined yet absent-minded [[skiptrace]]r Maggie McKeown is dispatched to find the missing teenagers near Lost River Lake and hires surly backwoods drunkard, Paul Grogan, to guide her. They discover the compound and find bizarre jarred specimens and evidence of an occupant inside. Locating a drainage switch for the nearby pool, McKeown empties it to search the bottom, but a haggard man enters and tries to stop her until Grogan subdues him. The pair find a skeleton in the pool's filtration trap and learn it was filled with saltwater. The man awakens and steals their jeep, but crashes due to being disoriented and is taken to Grogan's home. The next day, as the three travel downriver, the stranger tells the pair the pool was filled with a school of piranha and McKeown released them into the river. She and Grogan are skeptical until they come across the corpse of Grogan's friend Jack.\n\nThe stranger reveals himself as Dr. Robert Hoak, lead scientist of a defunct [[Vietnam War]] project called Operation: Razorteeth, which involved genetically-engineering a ravenous and prodigious strain of piranha that could endure the [[North Vietnam]]ese rivers' cold waters and inhibit [[Viet Cong]] movement. The project was canceled after the war ended, but the [[mutant]] specimens survived and Hoak tended to them to salvage his work. Grogan realizes that if the local dam is opened, the piranha will gain access to the Lost River resort and the nearby summer camp. On their way, the trio rescue a boy whose father was killed  by the piranha, but Hoak is killed by the mutants before he can reveal how to kill them and the survivors narrowly make it to shore. Grogan successfully stops the dam attendant from opening the spillway before calling the military.\n\nA military team led by Colonel Waxman and former Razorteeth scientist Dr. Mengers spread poison upstream, ignoring protests that the piranha survived the first attempt. When Grogan discovers a tributary that bypasses the dam, Waxman and Mengers quarantine him and McKeown to prevent them from alerting the media. The pair escape, but Waxman alerts law enforcement to capture them while the piranha attack the summer camp, injuring and killing many children and a camp counselor.\n\nWaxman and Mengers arrive at the water park to intercept Grogan and McKeown, but the piranha attack and kill many vacationers and Waxman. Intending to prevent the piranha from reaching the ocean and spreading around the world, Grogan and Maggie commandeer a speedboat and rush to a shuttered smelting plant in the hopes that they can use its industrial waste to kill the mutants. They arrive at the plant before the piranha, but the control office is submerged, forcing Grogan to go underwater with a safety line. Despite being attacked by the piranha, he opens the valves and McKeown pulls him to safety. The pair return to the water park, where Grogan enters a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] state. During a televised interview, Mengers [[Spin (propaganda)|spin]]s an altered version of events and downplays the piranha's existence.\n<!-- Please review [[MOS:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bradford Dillman]] as Paul Grogan\n* [[Heather Menzies]] as Maggie McKeown\n* [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Dr. Robert Hoak\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Jack\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Buck Gardner\n* [[Barbara Steele]] as Dr. Mengers\n* [[Belinda Balaski]] as Betsy\n* [[Melody Thomas Scott]] as Laura\n* [[Bruce Gordon (American actor)|Bruce Gordon]] as Colonel Waxman\n* [[Barry Brown (actor)|Barry Brown]] as Trooper\n* [[Paul Bartel]] as Dumont\n* Shannon Collins as Suzie Grogan\n* Shawn Nelson as Whitney\n* [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]] as Earl Lyon\n}}\n\nThe screenwriter [[John Sayles]] appears in a cameo as a sentry.\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\nThe film was released theatrically in the [[United States]] by [[New World Pictures]] in August 1978.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Given the proximity to ''[[Jaws 2]]'', Universal Pictures had considered an [[injunction]], but Spielberg convinced them otherwise.<ref name=mcbride/>\n\n===Home media===\nIn 2004, [[New Concorde|New Concorde Home Entertainment]] released the film on [[special edition]] [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdempire.com/Exec/v4_item.asp?item_id=7636|title=Piranha: The Directors' Series |work=dvdempire.com|access-date=2011-03-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, as a tie-in to the release of [[Piranha 3D|the remake]], [[Shout!
