Loosely inspired by an actual case, it tells the story of a disillusioned army officer whose love for his wife in her efforts to save a convicted murderer leads him to disobey orders.\n\nThe film made its North American debut at the 2000 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. It was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] in 2001 for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] and in that year was also nominated for two [[C\u00e9sar Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1849, on the French islands of [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]], two rescued sailors get drunk and kill a man. Arrested, tried and sentenced, one dies in custody but the other, N\u00e9el, has to wait for his execution because the little islands have no [[guillotine]] or executioner.\n[[File:Louisbourg04.jpg|thumb|The restored fortress and town of Louisbourg stood in for nineteenth-century St. Pierre]]\n[[File:Place du General de Gaulle square, St Pierre.JPG|thumb|The modern waterfront of St. Pierre]]\nHe is kept in the army barracks under the command of the Captain, who loves and trusts his childless wife known as Madame La. She takes an interest in the  convict and begins to try to redeem him. Under her auspices, N\u00e9el works hard, does various good deeds and starts to win the respect of the islanders. The authorities are however adamant that he must die.\n\nA year passes before the authorities hear that an old guillotine is on its way from the island of [[Martinique]]. By that time N\u00e9el is a changed man, who has learned to read and has even become a father after a quick encounter with a young widow whose roof he was mending. To the fury of the authorities, the Captain gets a priest into the barracks to marry the pair.\n\nWhen the ship with the guillotine eventually approaches, its rudder is broken and the island's men are asked to tow it inshore in rowing boats, one being N\u00e9el. Seeing how powerfully he rows, Madame La fills a boat with food and tells him to escape in it to the British island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. He however returns to his cell.\n\nAs none of the islanders will take the job of executioner, a new arrival is made to accept the task or face deportation. The Captain then tells the authorities that he will not order his soldiers to fire on inhabitants who obstruct the execution. For this disobedience, he is placed aboard a warship to be taken back to France for [[court-martial]] and Madame La joins him.\n\nThe Captain is condemned to death and shot by a firing squad. Back on Saint-Pierre, the old guillotine fails to work and they have to cut N\u00e9el's head off with an axe.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Madame La\n* [[Daniel Auteuil]] as The Captain\n* [[Emir Kusturica]] as N\u00e9el \n* [[Michel Duchaussoy]] as The Governor\n* Philippe Magnan as Council Chairman\n* Christian Charmetant as Naval Officer\n* Philippe Du Janerand as Customs Chief\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n* [[2001 C\u00e9sar Awards]]\n** Nominated for Best Actress \u2013 [[Juliette Binoche]]\n** Nominated for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 [[Emir Kusturica]]\n* Golden Globe Awards 2001\n** Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film\n* Sant Jordi Awards 2001\n** Winner Best Foreign Actor \u2013 [[Daniel Auteuil]]\n* [[22nd Moscow International Film Festival]]\n** Winner Russian Film Critics Award \u2013 Best Film\n** Nominated for Golden Saint George Award<ref name=\"Moscow2000\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2000 |title=22nd Moscow International Film Festival (2000) |accessdate=2013-03-26 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328142219/http://moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2000 |archivedate=March 28, 2013 }}</ref>\n*Jutra Awards 2001\n** Nominated for Best Art direction\n\n==Production notes==\nThough set in the French colony of St Pierre and Miquelon, the movie was filmed in the restored [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] on [[Cape Breton Island]], Nova Scotia.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://larswillumcuisine.com/tag/cape-breton-leg-of-lamb/# |title=Blog referring to the food prepared or the lead actor |access-date=29 April 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629154258/http://larswillumcuisine.com/tag/cape-breton-leg-of-lamb/# |archive-date=29 June 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nThe French title ''La Veuve de Saint-Pierre'' contains wordplay. \"Veuve\" translates to \"Widow\".
