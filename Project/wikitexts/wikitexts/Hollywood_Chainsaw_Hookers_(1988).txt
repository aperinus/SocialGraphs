They are handled here by seasoned professionals. The makers of this motion picture advise strongly against anyone attempting to perform these stunts at home. Especially if you are naked and about to engage in strenuous sex.\" The film ends with the promise of the sequel ''Student Chainsaw Nurses'', which was never made.\n\n==Reception==\n''Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers'' received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, earning a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] Want-To-See score of 33%.\n\n==Home media==\n''Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers'' has been released on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray format.\n\nIn the United States, the film was released in a '20th Anniversary Widescreen Edition' DVD on August 5, 2008. It was made available on Blu-ray in two individual editions on January 9, 2015, with a standard edition and a signed 'Special Limited Edition' of 1000 copies.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was released on DVD on July 10, 2000. 88 Films has released the film on Blu-ray on March 23, 2015 as part of the 'Slasher Classics Collection'. It is placed at #6 and like the other films released in the collection, it contains a reversible sleeve.\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book |last=Thompson|first=Nathaniel|title=DVD Delirium: The International Guide to Weird and Wonderful Films on DVD; Volume 1 Redux|orig-year=2002|year=2006|publisher=FAB Press|location=[[Godalming]], England|isbn=1-903254-39-6|pages=360\u2013361}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0095312|Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers}}\n* {{Amg movie|22751|Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers}}\n* [http://www.badmovies.org/movies/chainhooker/ ''Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers'' at BadMovies.org]\n\n{{Fred Olen Ray}}\n\n[[Category:Films directed by Fred Olen Ray]]\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1988 horror films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:Transgender-related films]]\n[[Category:1980s slasher films]]\n[[Category:Slasher comedy films]]\n[[Category:American slasher films]]\n[[Category:American exploitation films]]\n[[Category:1988 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American splatter films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:Films about cults]]"}]}}}}
