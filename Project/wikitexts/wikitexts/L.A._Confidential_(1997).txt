Confidential''''' is a 1997 American [[neo-noir]] [[crime film]] directed, produced, and co-written by [[Curtis Hanson]]. The screenplay by Hanson and [[Brian Helgeland]] is based on [[James Ellroy]]'s 1990 [[L.A. Confidential|novel of the same name]], the third book in his ''[[L.A. Quartet]]'' series. The film tells the story of a group of [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers in 1953, and the intersection of [[police corruption]] and [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] celebrity. The title refers to the 1950s scandal magazine ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'', portrayed in the film as ''Hush-Hush''.\n\nAt the time, Australian actors [[Guy Pearce]] and [[Russell Crowe]] were relatively unknown in [[North America]]. One of the film's backers, Peter Dennett, was worried about the lack of established stars in the lead roles, but supported Hanson's casting decisions, and the director had the confidence also to recruit [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Kim Basinger]], and [[Danny DeVito]].\n\n''L.A. Confidential'' was a critical and commercial success. It grossed $126 million against a $35 million budget and received acclaim from critics, with praise for the acting, writing, directing, editing, and [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s musical score.<ref name=\"tomatoes\" /><ref name=\"metacritic\" /> It was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning two: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Basinger) and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]; ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' won in every other category ''L.A. Confidential'' was nominated for. In 2015, the [[Library of Congress]] selected ''L.A. Confidential'' for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Barnes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|first=Mike |last=Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|access-date=December 16, 2015|location=Los Angeles, California}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=2015 National Film Registry: \"Ghostbusters\" Gets the Call|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-15-216/2015-national-film-registry-ghostbusters-gets-the-call/2015-12-16/|access-date=2020-11-18|website=Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref><ref name=\"Washington, D.C\">{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-11-18|website=Library of Congress|publisher=Washington, D.C.\\}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1953 [[Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Sergeant Edmund Exley is determined to live up to the reputation of his father, famed detective Preston Exley, who was killed by an unknown assailant whom Exley secretly nicknamed \"Rollo Tomasi\", his prototype of \"the guy who gets away with it.\"  He volunteers to testify against corrupt police officers involved in the \"[[Bloody Christmas (1951)|Bloody Christmas]]\" case in exchange for promotion to Detective Lieutenant, against the advice of [[Police captain|precinct captain]] Dudley Smith.\n\n[[Plainclothes law enforcement|Plainclothes]] Officer Wendell \"Bud\" White is obsessed with punishing men who abuse women, his own mother having been beaten to death by his father. White hates Exley because his partner, Dick Stensland, was fired thanks to Exley's testimony. With gangster [[Mickey Cohen]] imprisoned for [[tax evasion]], Smith recruits White to [[torture]] and frighten away out-of-town criminals trying to gain a foothold in Los Angeles. While at a liquor store, White also encounters Lynn Bracken, a prostitute resembling [[Veronica Lake]], and former cop Leland \"Buzz\" Meeks. Both work for Pierce Patchett, whose ''Fleur-de-Lis'' service runs high-end prostitutes altered by [[plastic surgery]] to resemble film stars.\n\nSergeant Jack Vincennes is a [[narcotics]] detective who moonlights as a technical advisor on ''Badge of Honor'', a TV police drama series. Sid Hudgens, publisher of the ''Hush-Hush'' [[tabloid magazine]], tips Vincennes on celebrity criminal activity so that he can make high-profile arrests for Sid's publication.\n\nExley soon investigates a robbery and multiple [[homicide]] at the ''Nite Owl'' coffee shop. Stensland was one of the victims. Exley and Vincennes arrest three [[African-American]] felons for the crime; they later escape from police custody and are killed by Exley in a shootout. Exley is decorated for bravery. Although the Nite Owl case appears solved, Exley and White investigate further, discovering evidence of [[corruption]] all around them. White begins a relationship with Lynn, and recognizes Nite Owl victim Susan Lefferts as one of Patchett's escorts. Lefferts' mother tells White that Stensland was Susan's \"boyfriend\"; White searches the crawl space under the mother's house and finds Meeks' corpse. He then interrogates [[Johnny Stompanato]], Cohen's ex-bodyguard, who says Meeks was trying to sell a large stash of [[heroin]] he had stolen.\n\nHudgens involves Vincennes in setting up a [[homosexual]] tryst between struggling actor Matt Reynolds and [[District Attorney]] Ellis Loew, intending to create a lucrative scandal. After Reynolds is found murdered, a guilt-ridden Vincennes joins Exley's investigation to find the killer. Vincennes later confronts Smith with evidence that Meeks and Stensland worked together under Smith's command a decade earlier, and dropped an investigation on Patchett, who had Hudgens photographing businessmen with prostitutes in a [[blackmail]] scam. Smith shoots Vincennes, who dies after murmuring \"Rollo Tomasi\".\n\nThe next day, Exley's suspicions are aroused when Smith asks him who \"Rollo Tomasi\" is. While interrogating Hudgens, Smith arranges for White to see photos of Lynn having sex with Exley, which sends an enraged White to find him. At the police station, White and Exley fight, but stop when both realize that Smith is corrupt. They deduce that Stensland killed Meeks over the stolen heroin, and that the Nite Owl killings were to allow Smith to kill Stensland. Smith's men framed the three African-Americans for the Nite Owl murders with planted evidence. Exley and White interrogate Loew and learn that Smith and Patchett (aided by Hudgens' blackmail photos) have been taking over Cohen's criminal empire, and that the killings were because of Smith tying up loose ends. They later find Patchett and Hudgens murdered.\n\nSmith lures Exley and White into an ambush. After the pair kill Smith's hitmen in a gunfight, White and Smith wound each other. As Exley holds Smith at gunpoint, Smith assures him that he can \"explain\" everything to the arriving police and Exley will be promoted. Smith walks away toward the newly gathered squad cars, but Exley shoots him in the back, killing him.\n\nAt the police station, Exley explains what he, Vincennes and White learned about Smith's corruption. The LAPD decides to protect their image by saying Smith died a hero in the shootout, while awarding Exley a second medal for bravery. Outside [[Los Angeles City Hall|city hall]], Exley says goodbye to Lynn and White before watching them drive off to Lynn's home in [[Arizona]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Detective Sergeant Jack \"Hollywood Jack\" Vincennes\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Detective Sergeant Wendell \"Bud\" White\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Detective Lieutenant Edmund \"Shotgun Ed\" Exley\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Captain Dudley Smith\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Lynn Bracken\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Sid Hudgens\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Pierce Morehouse Patchett\n* [[Ron Rifkin]] as District Attorney Ellis Loew\n* [[Graham Beckel]] as Detective Sergeant Richard \"Dick Stens\" Stensland\n* [[Amber Smith]] as Susan Lefferts\n* [[John Mahon (actor)|John Mahon]] as Police Chief\n* [[Paul Guilfoyle]] as [[Mickey Cohen|Meyer \"Mickey\" Cohen]]\n* [[Matt McCoy (actor)|Matt McCoy]] as Brett Chase\n* [[Paolo Seganti]] as [[Johnny Stompanato]]\n* [[Simon Baker|Simon Baker Denny]] as Matt Reynolds\n* [[Tomas Arana]] as Detective Sergeant Michael Breuning\n* Michael McCleery as Detective Sergeant William Carlisle\n* [[Shawnee Free Jones]] as Tammy Jordan\n* [[Darrell Sandeen]] as Leland \"Buzz\" Meeks\n* Marisol Padilla S\u00e1nchez as Inez Soto\n* Gwenda Deacon as Mrs. Lefferts\n* [[Jim Metzler]] as Councilman\n* [[Brenda Bakke]] as [[Lana Turner]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Curtis Hanson]] had read half a dozen of [[James Ellroy]]'s books before ''[[L.A.

He said, \"What hooked me on them was that, as I met them, one after the other, I didn't like them\u2014but as I continued reading, I started to care about them.\"<ref name= \"sragow\">{{cite news\n | last = Sragow\n | first = Michael\n | title = City of Angles\n | work = [[Dallas Observer]]\n | date = September 11, 1997\n | url = http://www.dallasobserver.com/film/city-of-angles-6402511\n | access-date = July 21, 2015}}</ref> Ellroy's novel also made Hanson think about Los Angeles and provided him with an opportunity to \"set a movie at a point in time when the whole dream of Los Angeles, from that apparently golden era of the '20s and '30s, was being bulldozed.\"<ref name= \"sragow\"/>\n\nScreenwriter [[Brian Helgeland]] was originally signed to [[Warner Bros.]] to write a Viking film with director [[Uli Edel]] and then worked on an unproduced modern-day [[King Arthur]] story. Helgeland was a longtime fan of Ellroy's novels. When he heard that Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to ''L.A. Confidential'' in 1990, he lobbied to script the film,<ref name=\"sragow\" /> but the studio was then talking only to well-known screenwriters. When he finally got a meeting, it was canceled two days before it was to occur.<ref name=\"sragow\" />\n\nHelgeland found that Hanson had been hired to direct and met with him while the filmmaker was making ''[[The River Wild]]''. They found that they not only shared a love for Ellroy's fiction but also agreed on how to adapt ''Confidential'' into a film. According to Helgeland, they had to \"remove every scene from the book that didn't have the three main cops in it, and then to work from those scenes out.\"<ref name=\"sragow\" /> According to Hanson, he \"wanted the audience to be challenged but at the same time I didn't want them to get lost.\"<ref name=\"dawson\">{{cite news\n | last = Dawson\n | first = Jeff\n | title = Mean Streets\n | work = [[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]\n | date = December 1997\n }}</ref> They worked on the script together for two years, with Hanson turning down jobs and Helgeland writing seven drafts for free.<ref name=\"sragow\" />\n\nThe two men also got Ellroy's approval. He had seen Hanson's films ''[[The Bedroom Window (1987 film)|The Bedroom Window]]'' and ''[[Bad Influence (film)|Bad Influence]]'', and found him \"a competent and interesting storyteller\", but was not convinced that his book would be made into a film until he talked to the eventual director.<ref name=\"sragow\" /> He later said, \"They preserved the basic integrity of the book and its main theme. Brian and Curtis took a work of fiction that had eight plotlines, reduced those to three, and retained the dramatic force of three men working out their destiny.\"<ref name=\"sragow\" />\n\nWarner executive Bill Gerber showed the script to Michael Nathanson, CEO of [[New Regency Productions]], which had a deal with the studio. Nathanson loved it, but they had to get the approval of New Regency's owner, [[Arnon Milchan]]. Hanson prepared a presentation that consisted of 15 vintage postcards and pictures of L.A. mounted on posterboards, and made his pitch to Milchan. The pictures consisted of orange groves, beaches, tract homes in the [[San Fernando Valley]], and the opening of the [[Hollywood Freeway]] to symbolize the image of prosperity sold to the public.<ref name= \"sragow\"/>\n[[File:5618-30 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Building used for movie premiere scene in L.A. Confidential]]\nIn the pitch, Hanson showed the darker side of Ellroy's novel by presenting the cover of scandal rag ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' and the famous shot of [[Robert Mitchum]] coming out of jail after his [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] bust. He also had photographs of jazz musicians [[Zoot Sims]], [[Gerry Mulligan]], and [[Chet Baker]] to represent the popular music of the time.<ref name= \"sragow\"/> Hanson emphasized that the period detail would be in the background and the characters in the foreground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edark.org/ellroy/english/menu3_en/toronto.html|title=Press Conference at Toronto International Film Festival|publisher=TIFF|year=1997|access-date=2015-11-15|archive-date=2008-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230175907/http://www.edark.org/ellroy/english/menu3_en/toronto.html}}</ref> Milchan was impressed with his presentation and agreed to finance it.\n\n===Casting===\nHanson had seen [[Russell Crowe]] in ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' and found him \"repulsive and scary, but captivating\".<ref name= \"sragow\"/> The actor had read Ellroy's ''[[The Black Dahlia (novel)|The Black Dahlia]]'' but not ''L.A.

Pearce did not like Ed when he first read the screenplay and remarked, \"I was pretty quick to judge him and dislike him for being so self-righteous ...

Crowe and Pearce were also relative unknowns in North America, and Milchan was equally worried about the lack of film stars in the lead roles.<ref name= \"sragow\"/> But he supported Hanson's casting decisions and this gave the director the confidence to approach [[Kim Basinger]], [[Danny DeVito]] and [[Kevin Spacey]]. Hanson cast Crowe and Pearce because he wanted to \"replicate my experience of the book.

He was billed as Simon Baker Denny in the film's credits.\n\nHanson felt that the character of Jack Vincennes was \"a movie star among cops\", and thought of Spacey, with his \"movie-star charisma,\" casting him specifically against type.<ref name= \"amy\"/> The director was confident that the actor \"could play the man behind that veneer, the man who also lost his soul,\" and when he gave him the script, he told him to think of [[Dean Martin]] while in the role.<ref name= \"amy\"/> Hanson cast Basinger because he felt that she \"was the character to me. What beauty today could project the glamor of Hollywood's golden age?\"<ref name= \"veniere\"/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nTo give his cast and crew points and counterpoints to capture Los Angeles in the 1950s, Hanson held a \"mini-film festival\", showing one film a week: ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'', because it epitomized the glamorous Hollywood look; ''[[In a Lonely Place]]'', because it revealed the ugly underbelly of Hollywood glamor; [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[The Lineup (film)|The Lineup]]'' and ''[[Private Hell 36]]'', \"for their lean and efficient style\";<ref name= \"amy\"/> and ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'', because it was \"so rooted in the futuristic '50s: the atomic age.\"<ref name= \"sragow\"/><ref name= \"amy\"/> Hanson and the film's cinematographer [[Dante Spinotti]] studied [[Robert Frank]]'s 1958 photographic book ''[[The Americans (photography)|The Americans]]'' and felt that the influence of his work was in every aspect of the film's visuals.
