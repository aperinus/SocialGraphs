It tells the true story of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]'s deteriorating [[mental health]], and his equally declining relationship with his eldest son, the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], particularly focusing on the period around the [[Charles James Fox#The Regency Crisis|Regency Crisis of 1788&ndash;89]]. Two text panels at the end of the film note that the colour of the King's urine suggests that he was suffering from [[porphyria]], adding  that the disease is \"periodic, unpredictable and [[Genetic disorder|hereditary]].\"\n\n''The Madness of King George'' won the [[BAFTA Awards]] in 1995 for [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Outstanding British Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] for [[Nigel Hawthorne]], who was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. The film won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and was also nominated for [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Mirren and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. Helen Mirren also won the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress]] and Hytner was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]].\n\nIn 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] voted ''The Madness of King George'' the [[BFI Top 100 British films|42nd greatest British film of all time]].\n\n==Plot==\nKing George III's bout of [[Insanity|madness]] in 1788 touched off the [[Charles James Fox#The Regency Crisis|Regency Crisis of 1788]] and triggered a power struggle between factions of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] under the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[William Pitt the Younger]] and the reform-minded [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Charles James Fox]].\n\nAt first, the King's behaviour appears mildly eccentric. He is deeply concerned with the wellbeing and productivity of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], and exhibits an encyclopedic knowledge of the families of even the most obscure royal appointments.  He is devoted to his loving wife and their large brood of 15 children. However, he is growing more unsettled, partly over the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|loss of America]]. His memory fails, his behavior becomes erratic and [[Hypersexuality|hypersexual]], he talks and talks, and his urine turns blue.\n\n[[George IV of the United Kingdom|George]], [[Prince of Wales]], aggravates the situation, knowing that he will be named [[regent]] if the King becomes incapacitated.  George chafes under his father's relentless criticism, and yearns for greater freedom, particularly when it comes to choosing a wife. He married the woman everyone believes to be his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], [[Maria Fitzherbert|Mrs. Fitzherbert]], in a secret ceremony in 1785. Without his father's consent, the marriage is illegal. Even with consent, it would remove him from the [[Succession to the British throne|succession]], because Fitzherbert is a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]. He knows that he has the moral support of Fox, whose agenda includes [[Abolitionism|abolition of the slave trade]] and friendlier [[United Kingdom\u2013United States relations|relations with America]].  Knowing how to exacerbate the King's behaviour, the Prince arranges a concert of music by [[Handel]]. The King reacts as expected, interrupting the musicians, speaking lasciviously to [[Elizabeth Herbert, Countess of Pembroke and Montgomery|Lady Pembroke]], and finally assaulting his son.\n\nIn a private moment, the King tells Charlotte that he knows something is wrong. They are brutally interrupted when the Prince has them separated, supposedly on the advice of physicians. Led by the Prince of Wales' personal physician, [[Richard Warren (physician)|Dr. Warren]], the King is treated using the medical practices of the time, which focus on the state of his urine and bowel movements, and include painful [[Cupping therapy|cupping]] and [[Laxative|purgatives]].\n\nLady Pembroke recommends [[Francis Willis (physician)|Dr. Francis Willis]], who cured her mother-in-law. Willis uses novel procedures. At his farm in Lincolnshire, patients work to gain \u201ca better opinion of themselves.\u201d He observes to an equerry \u201cTo be curbed, thwarted, stood up to, exercises the character.\u201d  When the King insults him, foully, he is strapped into a chair and gagged. He will be restrained whenever he \u201cswears and indulges in meaningless discourse\u201d and \u201cdoes not strive every day and always towards his own recovery\u201d.\n\nWhen the Prince has the King transferred to Kew, Charlotte watches as her beloved, bearded and wearing a soiled diaper and a straitjacket, struggles against being put in the coach. \u201cUntil you can govern yourself, you're not fit to govern others. And until you do so, I shall govern you,\u201d Willis says. At Kew, the King spits soup at Willis, but gains control under the physician's intractable gaze.<ref>According to the film, it was unheard of for anyone to look directly at the King without his permission.</ref> Later, the King, properly dressed, feeds himself to a round of applause from staff\u2014but the delusions persist.\n\nThe [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] opposition confronts Pitt's increasingly unpopular [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] government with a proposal that would give the Prince powers of regency. [[Baron Thurlow]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], obtains and suppresses proof of the marriage. Fox wins, and The Regency Bill is printed. Thurlow comes to see the King and joins in a moving reading of ''[[King Lear]]''.<ref>Act IV, scene 7</ref>  \u201c I have remembered how to seem...\u201d the King muses. \u201cWhat, what!\u201d an expression he has not used in 6 months. His urine is yellow.\n\nThurlow and the King arrive at Parliament in time to thwart the bill. The King forces the Prince to admit his marriage and to put away Fitzherbert.  With the crisis averted, all those who have witnessed his suffering are summarily dismissed, including Greville. Fitzroy observes: \u201cTo be kind does not commend you to kings.\u201d\n\nCheering crowds welcome the royal family to [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Willis stands by, but the King dismisses him.\n\n\u201cWe must be a model family,\u201d he declares; George wants \u201csomething to do.\u201d \u201cSmile at the people, wave at them. Let them see that we're happy. That's why we're here.\u201d Saluting, Willis disappears into the crowd, where Mrs. Fitzherbert also smiles, wistfully.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]]\n* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Francis Willis (physician)|Francis Willis]]\n* [[Amanda Donohoe]] as [[Elizabeth Herbert, Countess of Pembroke and Montgomery|Lady Pembroke]], [[Lady of the Bedchamber]]\n* [[Rupert Graves]] as Captain [[Robert Fulke Greville|Greville]]\n* [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]] as Doctor [[Richard Warren (physician)|Warren]]\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince of Wales]]\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as [[Charles James Fox]], [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]\n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Frederick, the Duke of York]]\n* [[Julian Wadham]] as [[William Pitt the Younger]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]\n* [[Anthony Calf]] as [[Lord Charles FitzRoy (British Army officer)|Lord Charles FitzRoy]]\n* [[Adrian Scarborough]] as [[Fortnum & Mason#History|Fortnum]]\n* [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow|Lord Thurlow]]\n* [[Jeremy Child]] as [[Black Rod]]\n* [[Struan Rodger]] as [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]]\n* [[Barry Stanton (actor)|Barry Stanton]] as [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]\n* [[Janine Duvitski]] as [[Margaret Nicholson]]\n* [[Caroline Harker]] as [[Maria Fitzherbert|Mrs. Fitzherbert]]\n* [[Roger Hammond (actor)|Roger Hammond]] as [[Sir George Baker, 1st Baronet|Baker]]\n* [[Cyril Shaps]] as [[Lucas Pepys|Pepys]]\n* [[Selina Cadell]] as Mrs. Cordwell\n* [[Alan Bennett]] as a backbench MP\n* [[Nicholas Selby]] as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAlan Bennett insisted that director Nicholas Hytner and actor Nigel Hawthorne should be cast in the film version, after having acted in the play.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Madness of King George |url=https://ew.com/article/1995/01/20/madness-king-george/ |website=EW.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=8 January 1995 |author=DAVID GRITTEN |title=Late-Blooming Nigel Hawthorne Enjoys 'Madness' of King-Size Role in Hytner's Film |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-01-08-ca-17652-story.html |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |quote=\u201cIt was wonderful that Alan Bennett insisted on Nick and me doing the film after we'd done it as a play,\u201d he said of the playwright. }}</ref>\n\n===Title change===\nIn adapting the play to film, the director Nicholas Hytner changed the name from ''The Madness of George III'' to ''The Madness of King George'' for American audiences, to clarify George III's royalty.

An interview revealed: \"That's not totally untrue,\" said Hytner, laughing. \"But there was also the factor that it was felt necessary to get the word ''King'' into the title.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-08/entertainment/ca-17601_1_miss-saigon/2|title=PROFILE : Life on an Artistic Carousel : Nicholas Hytner, director of 'Miss Saigon' and 'Carousel,' and 'Madness of King George' on film, is the hottest British import.
