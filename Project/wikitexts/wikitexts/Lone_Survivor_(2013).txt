Set during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)|war in Afghanistan]], it dramatizes the unsuccessful [[United States Navy SEALs]] [[counter-insurgency|counter-insurgent]] mission [[Operation Red Wings]], during which a four-man SEAL [[reconnaissance]] and surveillance team was given the task of tracking down the [[Taliban]] leader [[Ahmad Shah (Taliban)|Ahmad Shah]]. The film was written and directed by [[Peter Berg]] and stars [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Taylor Kitsch]], [[Emile Hirsch]], [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]], and [[Eric Bana]].\n\nUpon first learning of the book in 2007, Berg arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss [[film adaptation|adapting]] the book to film. [[Universal Pictures]] acquired the film rights in August 2007, after [[bidding]] against other major studios. In re-enacting events, Berg drew much of his screenplay from Luttrell's eyewitness accounts in the book, as well as autopsy and incident reports related to the mission. After directing ''[[Battleship (film)|Battleship]]'' (2012) for Universal, Berg resumed working on ''Lone Survivor''. [[Principal photography]] began in October 2012 and concluded in November, after 42 days. Filming took place on location in [[New Mexico]], using [[digital cinematography]]. Luttrell and several other Navy SEAL veterans acted as technical advisors, while multiple branches of the [[United States Armed Forces]] aided the production. Two companies, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] and [[Image Engine]], created the visual effects.\n\n''Lone Survivor'' opened in [[limited release]] in the United States on December 25, 2013, before opening across North America on January 10, 2014. It received generally positive reviews; critics praised Berg's direction and realism, as well as the acting, story, visuals and battle sequences, though some criticism was directed at the film's focus on action rather than characterization. It grossed over $154 million, of which $125 million was from North America. It was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2013|top ten films of 2013]] and received two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|Operation Red Wings}}\n\n[[Ahmad Shah (Taliban)|Ahmad Shah]], a local [[Taliban]] warlord in the [[Korangal Valley]] is identified as the person responsible for the deaths of several [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], plus any villagers who are believed to have aided the American forces in Afghanistan. A [[United States Navy SEAL|Navy SEAL]] team, consisting of [[Michael P. Murphy|Michael Murphy]], [[Matthew Axelson]], [[Danny Dietz]] and [[Marcus Luttrell]], is ordered to capture Shah.\n\nInserted overnight via helicopter, the four-man team make their way toward Shah's last known location. Due to the mountainous terrain the team are operating in, communications with [[Forward Operating Base Salerno|J-Bad]] become difficult. Though the team identify Shah, they are discovered by local villagers; one of whom is carrying a [[walkie-talkie]]. Believing that the villagers are Taliban sympathisers, the SEALs debate setting them free or killing them. Murphy orders them to be set free.\n\nThe team proceed up the mountainside, aborting their mission and intend to extract. However, true to the SEALs\u2019 concerns the villagers alert the Taliban, who pursue the team. Though the SEALs begin with the advantage, the sheer number of the Taliban forces begins to overwhelm them and their position. Pushed toward a [[ravine]] the SEALs are given little choice but to jump, but are thrown off balance when an [[Rocket Propelled Grenade|RPG]] detonates in front of them. Dietz is killed and the remaining SEALs try desperately to raise support. Murphy scales the cliff to gain a [[Mobile phone signal|clear signal]] which finally alerts the [[Quick Reaction Force|QRF]], though he is killed shortly after.\n\nThe QRF scrambles to the SEALs\u2019 aid, though the two [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook]] helicopters fly in without [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|Apache]] support. Briefly encouraged by the arrival of reinforcements, Luttrell and Axelson watch helplessly as one Chinook is shot down by an RPG. The second aborts, leaving Luttrell and Axelson to fend for themselves. Already grievously wounded from battle, the disoriented Axelson is soon cornered by Taliban gunmen and killed. Luttrell is also discovered, though he survives an RPG attack and is able to hide from his pursuers overnight and escapes.\n\nWandering alone, Luttrell happens across a small stream when he is discovered by Mohammed Gulab, a local [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]. Taking the wounded and exhausted Luttrell into his care, Gulab hides him from the Taliban in his home, and also sends another villager to the nearest American base to report on Luttrell's location. Shah arrives at the village to execute Luttrell, however the villagers resist. Shah leaves, but returns later with several Taliban gunmen and engage the villagers. [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] arrive mid battle and evacuate Luttrell, who also thanks Mohammed for his assistance.\n\nImages of the real Luttrell, Gulab and the fallen service members killed during the mission are shown during a four-minute [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]], and an [[epilogue]] explains that the Pashtun villagers agreed to help Luttrell as part of a traditional [[honor system|code of honor]] known as the [[Pashtunwali]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{quote box|quote=What makes this story so special is the bond and the camaraderie between the guys, but also the state of where we are in the world today.

Stofksy noted that a total of \"36 cookie cutter uniforms\" were produced for Wahlberg.<ref name=\"CDG\" />\n\nIn designing the costumes for the Pashtun people and Taliban forces, Stofsky aimed to create a visual distinction between the villagers and Taliban fighters. \"Luttrell survived because of the age-old tradition of the [[Pashtunwali|Pashtun culture]] in providing hospitality and safety to those that enter their home\", she explained. \"We dyed the Taliban's costumes black, [[Variations of gray#Charcoal|charcoal]], [[Wine (color)|wine]], and [[indigo]] and kept the villagers light. Their humanity prevails. This is what we hoped to get across.\" Stofsky utilized a [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]]-based Afghan vendor, Moe Noorzai, for traditional Afghan clothing including vests, pants, dresses and [[Kashmir]] scarves. Stofsky also had a New Mexico-based tailor produce all of the [[turban]]s featured in the film.<ref name=\"CDG\" />\n\nZarin Mohammad Rahimi, an Afghan refugee who fled to the United States to avoid the Taliban, and his sons, Muhammad Nawroz Rahimi and Nawaz Rahimi, were hired as technical advisors during production.

He works in a very linear manner, so as we start to view a scene, if there's something that bothers him, we'll stop and address it.\"\n\nThe first cut of the film was two-and-a-half hours long. Parker then cut the film down to two hours when he realized there was a way to further trim the film. \"There were a number of scenes that paced well when we intercut them rather than letting them play as written in a linear fashion. For instance, we wanted to let the mission briefing scene play normally\u2014this is where the SEAL team is briefed on their target.
