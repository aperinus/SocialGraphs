The fifth installment in the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' series]], it follows serial killer [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] who again returns to the town of Haddonfield to murder his niece, [[Jamie Lloyd]], who, traumatized from his previous attack on her, has been institutionalized following her attempt to murder her foster mother.\n\nAfter the success of the previous installment, ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' (1988), ''Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'' was rushed into production by executive producer [[Moustapha Akkad]]. The original screenplay, which was still under revision at the time filming began, introduced elements of [[Supernatural horror film|supernatural horror]], including Jamie possessing a [[telepathy|telepathic]] link to Michael Myers, as well as a storied subplot in which Myers, under the influence of a [[cult]] centered around the ancient [[rune]] of [[Thorn (letter)|Thorn]], is driven to kill his bloodline. While the final cut of the film features a mysterious \"Man in Black\" character, the \"Curse of Thorn\" subplot was largely minimized, resulting in audiences and critics expressing some confusion, though it was expanded upon in the following film, ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' (1995).\n\nFilmed in [[Salt Lake City]] in mid-1989, ''Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'' was released theatrically in North America in October of that year by the [[independent film|independent]] studio Galaxy Releasing. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office disappointment]], only grossing $11.6 million domestically against a $5.5 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 40-Year History of Halloween at the Box Office |url=https://www.boxofficepro.com/halloween-franchise-box-office-history/#:~:text=One%20year%20later%2C%20Halloween%205,off%20a%20%245%20million%20budget. |website=Box Office Pro}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn <!--This is a date-->October 31, 1988,<!--Do not link to a movie per WP:EASTEREGG]]--> [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] is shot and falls down a salt [[Shaft mining|mine shaft]]. Sheriff Ben Meeker, the lynch mob of Haddonfield's truckers, and state police toss down [[dynamite]] to finish him off. Escaping into a nearby creek before the dynamite explodes, Michael stumbles upon an elderly [[hermit]] who nurses him back to health after he falls into a coma. One year later, on October 30, 1989, Michael awakens, stabs the hermit to death with his knife, and returns to Haddonfield to find his niece [[Jamie Lloyd]] again, who narrowly avoided being killed by him the year before.\n\nJamie has been admitted to the Haddonfield Children's Clinic after having attacked her foster mother. Jamie has been rendered [[Muteness|mute]] due to [[psychological trauma]], suffering from nightmares and seizures and exhibits signs of a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] link with her uncle. Dr. Sam Loomis becomes aware of Jamie's psychic link with Michael, and tries to convince Meeker that Michael is still alive. Meanwhile, Michael stabs Jamie's foster sister [[Rachel Carruthers|Rachel]] to death and begins stalking their friend Tina. Michael kills Tina's boyfriend Mike, then poses as him by wearing a mask that Tina had given to Mike earlier.\n\nLater that night, Tina and her friends Sam and Spitz go to a Halloween party at a farm. Sensing that Tina is in danger, Jamie (having partially regained her ability to speak) goes to warn her. While Sam and Spitz are having sex in the barn, Michael impales Spitz with a pitchfork and decapitates Sam with a [[scythe]]. Tina finds the bodies, and goes to warn nearby police deputies but finds that Michael has already killed them. Tina flees, but Jamie and her friend Billy Hill (a fellow patient from the clinic) arrive. Michael begins chasing Jamie in a car but crashes into a tree. Michael exits the car, and Tina sacrifices herself to allow Jamie and Billy time to escape. Loomis arrives, and Jamie finally agrees to help him stop Michael for good.\n\nWith Jamie's help, Loomis and Meeker have created a set up at the old Myers house to lure him back to his abandoned childhood home. Suddenly, the police receive a call saying Michael has broken into the clinic, which prompts Meeker and most of the officers to leave; however, this call is merely a diversion. Michael appears and kills the trooper sitting in the patrol car outside, before entering the house. Loomis tries to reason with him, but Michael slashes him and throws him over the stair banister. Michael kills deputy Bloch who was protecting Jamie before chasing her throughout the house. Jamie hides in a laundry chute but is forced to abandon it when Michael stabs and injures her. Fleeing upstairs, Jamie finds the bodies of Max the dog, Rachel, and Mike in the attic. Michael finds Jamie and attempts to kill her, but stops when Jamie addresses him as 'Uncle,\" and removes his mask. When Jamie touches his face he goes into a fit of rage, and chases her again. Jamie heads downstairs and finds Loomis. Loomis uses Jamie to lure Michael into a trap, shooting him with a [[tranquilizer gun]] and dropping a steel net onto him. He beats the trapped, drugged Michael unconscious with a wooden plank until he eventually suffers from a stroke and collapses on top of Michael.\n\nMeeker and the rest of the police return shortly thereafter and Michael is then taken into custody. Meeker assures Jamie that Michael, who is locked up in a cell, will remain in prison until he dies; Jamie doesn't believe him, however, and remarks that Michael will \"never die.\" One of the officers goes to bring Jamie home when a mysterious man in black, who has been searching for Michael, arrives and causes an explosion at the police station. The officer, hearing gunfire, rushes back inside after warning Jamie to stay with the car. When the officer doesn't return, Jamie goes back inside to investigate and finds the station destroyed from the explosion, along with Meeker and several of his men dead. Jamie discovers Michael's cell empty and the back door of the police station broken open, causing her to break down in tears as she realizes Michael is free again to continue terrorizing Haddonfield.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Halloween (franchise) characters|l1=''List of'' Halloween ''characters''}}\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Donald Pleasence]] as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]]\n*[[Danielle Harris]] as [[Jamie Lloyd]]\n*[[Ellie Cornell]] as [[Rachel Carruthers]]\n*[[Beau Starr]] as Sheriff Ben Meeker\n*Jeffrey Landman as Billy Hill\n*[[Wendy Kaplan]] as Tina Williams\n*[[Tamara Glynn]] as Samantha Thomas\n*[[Don Shanks (stuntman)|Don Shanks]] as [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] / The Man in Black\n*Jonathan Chapin as Mike\n*[[Matthew Walker (American actor)|Matthew Walker]] as Spitz\n*Max Robinson as Dr. Max Hart\n*Betty Carvalho as Nurse Patsey\n*[[Troy Evans (actor)|Troy Evans]] as Deputy Charlie Bloch\n*Frank Como as Deputy Nick Ross\n*David Ursin as Deputy Tom Farrah\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment on a fifth ''Halloween'' was fast tracked to meet a pre-set release deadline of October 1989.{{sfn|Clark|Kasch|Wallick|2013|loc=0:43}} Producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] turned to ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' writer and director [[Alan B.

At the time of filming, it was unknown who this figure was.

After Rachel's demise, Tina inherits the role of Jamie's protector.\n\n[[George P.

[[Don Shanks (stuntman)|Don Shanks]] was cast to play the speech-less, white-masked murderer. Shanks had already played a similar character in the first two ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night]]'' films. Shanks also had a double role as the Man in Black. Wilbur, who had to wear hockey pads to appear to have a bigger build, would later portray the Shape again in the next installment, ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]''. Shanks did not have to wear the hockey pads because he already had a larger build.<ref name=\"H25 Doc\">''Halloween: 25 Years of Terror'' DVD documentary</ref>\n\nMax Robinson would play Maxwell Hart, the doctor who assists Jamie when she is having one of her nightmares in the beginning of the film. Betty Carvalho appears as his assistant, Nurse Patsey, who has a \"motherly\" feel to Jamie. Jeffrey Landman portrayed Billy Hill, Jamie's best friend, who has a stutter. Landman worked with a coach who taught him about stuttering to help him prepare for the role.\n\nNewcomers such as [[Tamara Glynn]], [[Matthew Walker (American actor)|Matthew Walker]], and Jonathan Chapin appear as Samantha Thomas, Spitz, and Mike, who are friends of Tina and Rachel. Walker would later appear in another slasher film, ''[[Child's Play 3]]'' (1991).\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began on May 1, 1989, in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], as well as the surrounding communities of [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] and [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]].<ref name=afi/> Several prior filming locations from ''Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers'' are featured in the film, including the Carruthers residence, as well as the local general store.

Othenin-Girard had forgotten to yell \"Cut!\" and fire was beginning to emerge from the car (Shanks put this down to Othenin-Girard being sidetracked by seeing stunts take place during his first major directing job). Finally, stunt coordinator Don Hunt told Othenin-Girard to finally yell \"cut\".
