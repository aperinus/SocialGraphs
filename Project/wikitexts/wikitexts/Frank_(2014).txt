As Lucas is taken to the hospital, Jon meets Don, who explains that Lucas was the keyboardist for a band called The Soronprfbs, which Don manages. After mentioning that he plays keyboards, Jon is invited to perform with them that night. The Soronprfbs\u2019 drummer Nana, synthesizer and theremin player Clara, and guitarist Baraque are reluctant to accept Jon, but he is warmly welcomed by lead vocalist Frank, who always wears a [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] [[mask]] over his head. Their performance abruptly ends when Clara storms off the stage after being shocked by an electrical fault.\n\nFrank invites Jon to become a full-time member of the band. He agrees and accompanies them to [[Ireland]] to spend a year in a remote cabin while they work on recording their debut album. One day, Don confesses to Jon that he feels he cannot live up to Frank's prowess. The next day, Don reveals they are being evicted from the cabin, but Jon offers to pay the outstanding rent using his grandfather's inheritance. After completing the album, the band finds what appears to be Frank's corpse hanging from a tree, but discover it is actually Don once they remove the mask. They cremate him, and Clara reveals to Jon that Don was the original keyboardist of the band.\n\nJon reveals that he has been secretly uploading the band's recording sessions on social media, earning them a small fan following and an invitation to perform at [[South by Southwest]]. Most of the band is offended by Jon's clandestine promotion of them, but Frank, excited by the prospect of a large audience, agrees to go to the festival. Clara confronts Jon as the latter is soaking in the hot tub, expressing contempt for his growing influence over Frank. The ensuing argument culminates in them having angry sex, and Clara threatens to stab him if the trip to America goes awry.\n\nLeading up to the performance, the band begins to argue over creative differences. Clara and Frank disappear shortly before the concert and Jon finds them in an alley, where Clara is helping Frank stave off a mental breakdown. Jon tries to get Frank to go back to the festival with him, prompting Clara to stab him in the leg as promised. After she is arrested, Jon uses the scandal to build publicity for the band. The night before the concert, Nana and Baraque reveal their disdain for Jon's selfish ambitions and quit the band. Jon and Frank go onstage by themselves in spite of Frank's deteriorating mental health. When Jon tries to begin the set with one of his own songs rather than one from the album, Frank has a breakdown and collapses on stage. They move into a cheap motel together, where a frustrated Jon tries to forcibly unmask Frank. Frank tries to escape and is hit by a car, smashing the fake head. He flees before Jon can see his real face.\n\nSome time later, Jon visits a [[dive bar]] where Clara, Nana, and Baraque are playing as a trio, and apologizes to them for having taken control of the band. After numerous failed attempts, he finally succeeds in tracking Frank to his hometown of [[Bluff City, Kansas]], where he is living with his parents. Frank is scarred and balding from prolonged use of the mask. Frank\u2019s parents explain that he has suffered from severe mental health issues all his life and began wearing the mask as a teenager after his dad made it for him for an alleged [[costume party]], but that he has always been musically talented. Frank declares he has been unable to make music since the band fell apart. Jon takes Frank to the dive bar where the rest of the band is playing. They quickly realize who he is, and join him as he begins to sing. With the original Soronprfbs restored, Jon leaves the bar alone.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as Frank, the eccentric titular character and leader of the band who wears a large [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] head throughout the film, similar to that worn by [[Chris Sievey|Frank Sidebottom]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/frank-clip-yes-thats-michael-fassbender-under-the-giant-fake-head/ |title= 'Frank' Clip: Yes, That's Michael Fassbender Under the Giant Fake Head |date= 17 January 2014 |access-date= 17 January 2014 |first= Angie |last= Han |work= /FILM}}</ref> Director Lenny Abrahamson said that Fassbender was \"very comfortable\" wearing the head and said that he even enjoyed acting in it.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{cite news |url= http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/sundance-how-to-make-fassbender-unattractive.html |title= Sundance: How to Make Michael Fassbender Unattractive |date= 18 January 2014 |access-date= 21 January 2014 |first= Kyle |last= Buchanan |newspaper=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]}}</ref>\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Jon Burroughs, a young wannabe musician who joins Frank's band.<ref name=\"Metro\">{{cite news |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/going-out/film/michael-fassbender-to-play-frank-sidebottom-1308523#.Utm67PTFInI |title= Michael Fassbender is about to go big-headed... playing Frank Sidebottom in a new film |date= 6 September 2012 |access-date= 17 January 2014 |first= Steve |last= White |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]}}</ref>\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Clara Wagner, Frank's often aggressive sidekick who plays a [[Korg MS-20]] and a [[theremin]].<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/frank-first-look-new-still-410707 |title= 'Frank' First Look: New Still Released From Film Set |date= 10 January 2013 |first= Stuart |last= Kemp |work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date= 17 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Var\"/> Gyllenhaal originally turned down the role, saying that she didn't understand it, but the story stuck with her and weeks later she changed her mind.<ref name=\"THR2\">{{cite news |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-cast-michael-fassbenders-frank-672093 |title= Sundance: Cast of Michael Fassbender's 'Frank' Thought Film Was 'Bizarre' |date= 18 January 2014 |access-date= 21 January 2014 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first= Borys |last= Kit}}</ref> Before filming started, Gyllenhaal decided to act as though Clara was Frank's true love but said that it was hard due to Frank's head.<ref name=\"Vulture\"/>\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Don, the band's manager, producer and sound engineer.<ref name=\"Var\">{{cite news |url= https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-frank-1201063014/ |title= Sundance Film Review: 'Frank' |date= 18 January 2014 |access-date= 21 January 2014 |first= Peter |last= Debruge |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n* [[Carla Azar]] as Nana, the band's drummer.\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Civil]] as Baraque, the band's French guitar player.\n\n==Production==\n''Frank'' is a fictional story mostly inspired by Frank Sidebottom, the [[comic persona]] of [[Chris Sievey]] who is thought to have given his backing to the film before his death, but the plot was also inspired by other musicians like [[Daniel Johnston]] and [[Captain Beefheart]].<ref name=\"Metro\"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/maggie-gyllenhaal-to-star-alongside-michael-fassbender/293885 |title= Maggie Gyllenhaal to star alongside Michael Fassbender in 'Frank' |date= 1 January 2013 |access-date= 17 January 2014 |work= [[NME]]}}</ref> [[Jon Ronson]], who co-wrote the film, was part of Sidebottom's band,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/may/31/art.popandrock |title= Oh blimey!
