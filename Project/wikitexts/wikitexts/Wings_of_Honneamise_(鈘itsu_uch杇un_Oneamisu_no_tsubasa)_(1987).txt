A dubbed [[35 mm movie film|35 mm]] version toured theaters in [[North America]] and the [[United Kingdom]], during which time it received coverage in major newspapers but highly mixed reviews.

His grades disqualifying him, Shirotsugh ended up instead joining the \"Royal Space Force,\" a tiny unit with poor morale whose commander, General Khaidenn, dreams of human spaceflight, yet is barely capable of launching unmanned satellites. One night, Shirotsugh encounters a woman named Riquinni who is preaching in the [[red-light district]]. Riquinni Nonderaiko, who lives with a sullen little girl named Manna, surprises him by suggesting that humanity could find peace through space travel. Inspired, Shirotsugh volunteers for a last-ditch project to keep the Space Force from being disbanded: send the first astronaut into orbit.\n\nRiquinni gives Shirotsugh scriptures to study, but becomes upset when he touches her and angry when he suggests she should \"compromise\" with God. Riquinni feels such compromise is to blame for the evils of the world, but Shirotsugh suggests it has made it easier to live in. The General arranges a shady deal to help finance his project, and tells a cheering crowd that the orbital capsule will be a [[militarisation of space|\"space warship]]\". Soon after, Riquinni's cottage is foreclosed upon and demolished; not wishing to expose Manna\u2014 whose mother was constantly [[domestic abuse|abused]] by her husband\u2014 to any more conflicts, she rejects the outraged Shirotsugh's offer to get her a lawyer. He begins to read Riquinni's scriptures, which assert that humanity is [[original sin|cursed]] to violence for having [[theft of fire|stolen fire]].\n\nA test explosion that kills the chief rocket engineer is suggested to be the work of radicals, and Shirotsugh confounds his friends by sympathizing with protestors who say the mission is a waste of federal funding. The launch site is suddenly moved to the Kingdom's southern border, [[Spaceport#Location|which will assist in reaching orbit]] but is also adjacent to a territory occupied by their international rival, the distant Republic. The General learns to his shock that his superiors see the rocket only as a useful [[casus belli|provocation]]; unknown to the Kingdom, the Republic plans to buy time to get their forces into position by assassinating Shirotsugh.\n\nIncreasingly disenchanted, Shirotsugh goes [[Desertion#Absence without leave|AWOL]], giving his money to the homeless and joining Riquinni's ministry, but is troubled by Manna's continued silence and seeing the money Riquinni keeps. He turns away when she reads from her scriptures that one\u2019s own efforts at truth and good will fail, and one can only pray. That night, he sexually assaults her; when he hesitates momentarily, she knocks him unconscious. Next morning, a repentant Shirotsugh is bewildered when Riquinni maintains he did nothing, apologizing for having hit \u201ca wonderful person like you\". Reuniting with his best friend Marty, Shirotsugh asks whether one might be the villain in one's own life's story, not its hero. Marty replies with the view that people exist because they serve purposes for one another. The Republic's assassin strikes\u2014 Shirotsugh attempts to flee, but eventually fights back, killing the assassin. The General confides in the wounded astronaut afterwards that he once wanted to be a historian and not a soldier, but found history harder to confront, because it taught him human nature would not change.\n\nAt the launch site, the crew finishes assembling the rocket even as both sides prepare for the expected attack. Without informing his superiors, the General decides to launch early by trimming safety procedures, to which Shirotsugh agrees. When the Republic's forces invade to seize the rocket by force, an evacuation is ordered, but Shirotsugh rallies the crew to proceed with the countdown. The combined ground-air assault ceases with the rocket's unexpected launch, and the Republic forces withdraw. From orbit, Shirotsugh makes a radio broadcast, uncertain if anyone is listening: although humans have brought ruin to each new frontier, he asks nevertheless to give thanks for this moment, praying for forgiveness and guidance. As the capsule crosses into the [[terminator (solar)|dayside]], a montage of visions suggests Shirotsugh's childhood and the passage of history; far below, Riquinni, preaching where he first met her, is the only one to look up as the snow begins to fall, and the camera draws back, past the ship and its world, to the stars.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

If normal things now look impressive and interesting because they've been seen through a different world, then we'll have achieved what we set out to do in the plan; we'll be able to express, 'Reality is much more interesting than you thought.{{' \"}}<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c\u4e16\u754c\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306b\u306f\u7d30\u5fc3\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3053\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306f\u5168\u304f\u306e\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3068\u540c\u6642\u306b\u3001\u73fe\u5b9f\u305d\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3042\u3089\u306d\u3070\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3089\u3067\u3059\u3002\u306a\u305c\u306a\u3089\u3001\u73fe\u5b9f\u3092\u518d\u8a8d\u8b58\u3055\u305b\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3068\u306f\u3044\u3048\u3001\u5168\u304f\u73fe\u5b9f\u306e\u901a\u308a\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u3092\u9032\u3081\u3066\u3082\u3001\u305d\u306e\u73fe\u5b9f\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3082\u306e\u81ea\u4f53\u304c\u5f7c\u7b49\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u306f\u624b\u57a2\u304c\u3064\u3044\u305f\u3001\u9b45\u529b\u306e\u7121\u3044\u4e16\u754c\u3068\u611f\u3057\u3089\u308c\u308b\u304b\u3089\u3067\u3059\u3002\u305d\u308c\u3088\u308a\u3001\u3053\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u5168\u304f\u306e\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3044\u3001\u307e\u308b\u3067\u5916\u56fd\u6620\u753b\u3067\u3042\u308b\u304b\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3075\u308b\u307e\u3063\u305f\u65b9\u304c\u89b3\u5ba2\u306e\u6ce8\u610f\u3092\u305d\u3061\u3089\u306b\u5f15\u304d\u3064\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308b\u308f\u3051\u3067\u3059\u3057\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5f15\u304d\u3064\u3051\u308b\u5bfe\u8c61\u304c\u30e1\u30ab\u3084\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u3054\u304f\u666e\u901a\u306e\u98a8\u4fd7\u3084\u30d5\u30a1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e8\u30f3\uff08\u666e\u901a\u3068\u3044\u3063\u3066\u3082\u8003\u3048\u306c\u304b\u308c\u305f\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3089\u3001\u5145\u5206\u8208\u5473\u6df1\u304f\u3001\u9762\u767d\u3044\u308f\u3051\u3067\u3059\uff09\u3067\u3042\u308b\u306e\u306a\u3089\u3070\u3001\u4f01\u753b\u610f\u56f3\u306f\u307b\u3070\u3001\u9054\u6210\u3057\u305f\u3068\u3044\u3048\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3002\u3064\u307e\u308a\u3001\u305d\u306e\u624b\u6cd5\u3092\u3068\u308c\u3070\u300e\u73fe\u5b9f\u3068\u306f\u81ea\u5206\u304c\u4eca\u3001\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3088\u308a\u305a\u3063\u3068\u9762\u767d\u3044\u300f\u3068\u3044\u3046\u4e8b\u304c\u8868\u73fe\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\u3002\u300d}}{{harvnb|Studio Hard|1987|p=49}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe September 1984 proposal for ''Royal Space Force'' was unusual for an anime pitch in that it described the setting and story, but never named the main characters.<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c\u666e\u901a\u3069\u3093\u306a\u4f01\u753b\u66f8\u3082\uff08\u7279\u306b\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u306e\u5834\u5408\uff09\u3001\u4f5c\u54c1\u672c\u7de8\u306e\u30bf\u30bf\u30ad\u53f0\u7a0b\u5ea6\u306e\u6271\u3044\u3057\u304b\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3042\u3048\u3066\u5272\u611b\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3044\u305f\u3002\u552f\u4e00\u3042\u308b\u3068\u3059\u308c\u3070\u3001\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u3068\u30d2\u30ed\u30a4\u30f3\u306b\u540d\u524d\u304c\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u304f\u3089\u3044\u304b\u3002\u300d}}{{harvnb|Studio Hard|1987|p=49}}</ref> The written proposal was accompanied by a set of over 30 [[Concept art|\"image sketches\"]] depicting the world to be designed for the anime, painted in watercolor by Sadamoto and [[Mahiro Maeda]].<ref name=\"Matsushita 1987 25\"/> Maeda, a high school classmate of Daicon Film director and character designer [[Takami Akai]], had attended [[Tokyo Zokei University]] with Sadamoto;

I did want it to be a hit, but from the start, I wasn't aiming for a ''[[Star Wars]]''. In trying to make it a success, it had to be purely young people's ideas and concepts; we couldn't force them to compromise. We had to let them run free with it.

Among the ambitious animators of those days, there was some sort of consensus that 'if we can create an animated movie that adults can watch, with decent content \"for children\" which director Hayao Miyazaki has, it will be a hit for sure.' The pilot version was also created under that consensus unconsciously. However, I figured it's not good to do so, and my movie making started from completely denying that consensus. Of course, if we had created this movie with the concept of the world similar to the pilot version, it would've had a balanced and stable style, and not only for staff, but also for sponsors, motion picture companies, and the media ... it would have been easier to grasp and express. But if we had done that, I don't think that any of the Gainax works after that would've been successful at all.\"<ref name=\"Yamaga 2007 5\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Screenplay===\n\n<blockquote>\"The film was Gainax's call to the world, of how we would be. The story of the anime is explaining why we are making anime in the first place.

On the choice of using either an early US or Soviet rocket as a model for the Royal Space Force launcher, Anno explained that he chose the Soviet because it was novel to him personally, and because he felt the [[Vostok (rocket family)|Vostok]]'s use of boosters that [[Multistage rocket#Separation events|separated]] horizontally (rather than vertically as with American rockets of the period) would create more visual interest. An aesthetic touch Anno added to the final rocket design was its [[copper]] appearance, which was inspired by the [[10 yen coin|Japanese 10 yen coin]].<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u3092\u6c7a\u3081\u308b\u306e\u3082\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306f\u82e6\u52b4\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3068\u306b\u304b\u304f\u3001\u50d5\u9054\u306e\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u300e\u73fe\u5b9f\u300f\u306e\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\uff08\u3053\u308c\u306f\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u9803\u306bTV\u3067\u89b3\u305f\u7269\uff09\u306e\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u5d29\u3055\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002 \u73fe\u5728\u306e\u9ad8\u6821\u751f\u306f\u3002\u3002\u3002\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3068\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30b7\u30e3\u30c8\u30eb\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3002\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u4eba\u9054\u306b\u306f\u3042\u306e\u9577\u7d30\u306b\u68d2\u72b6\u306e\u5f62\u306f\u73cd\u3057\u304f\u611f\u3058\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3068\u3002\u300d\u300c\u5f62\u306f\u30bd\u9023\u306e\u30dc\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30af\u307f\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\u300d\u300c\u30bd\u9023\u306e\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u3057\u305f\u7406\u7531\u306f\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u5f0f\u306e\u6c34\u5e73\u5206\u96e3\u3088\u308a\u30bd\u9023\u5f0f\u306e\u5782\u76f4\u5206\u96e2\u306e\u65b9\u304c\u7d75\u7684\u306b\u826f\u3044\u3057\u3001\u81ea\u5206\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u3082\u65ac\u65b0\u3060\u3063\u305f\u304b\u3089\u3067\u3059\u3002\u300d\u300c\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u8272\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306f\uff1f\u300d\u300c\u81ea\u5206\u3067\u52dd\u624b\u306b10\u5186\u7389\u306e\u8272\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u300e\u9285\u300f\u3068\u3044\u3046\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\u300d}}{{harvnb|Matsushita|1987|p=202}}</ref>}}  This exception was later noticed by Hayao Miyazaki, for whom it formed one of his two criticisms of the anime;

the camera angles to be used were also decided by the animators through discussion.

However, many of us had only been in the anime industry for a short time, so we had to make do with what we had. Even with the same staff, if I were asked to do this twice, I don't think I could.

Takaya's method, instead of using a sequence of separate animation cels, created movement within a unified \"harmony layer\" where the object intended to move was constructed as one single assembly made from flat overlapping cutout pieces, each piece mounted individually on an elastic strip; the strip was pulled, and the resulting motion of the parts filmed. Miyazaki's assistant on ''Nausica\u00e4'', [[Kazuyoshi Katayama]], compared the technique to a [[bellows]], remarking that the varying levels of elastic tension along the parts of the assembly conveyed a distinct sense of dimension and mass to the motion depicted.<ref>{{harvnb|Katayama|2019|pp=153\u2013155}}</ref> The larger concept of \"harmony\" in cel animation encompassed conveying touches, shadings, and gradations of the kind associated with [[oil paint|oils]] or [[watercolor painting|watercolors]] that were not necessarily expressible through the [[acrylic paint]]s traditionally used to color cels directly; therefore the harmony technique would, for example, paint only the black outlines of the animated object on the transparent cel, conveying the animated object's color via a separate painted layer underneath the cel. A \"harmony\" layer could also incorporate additional imagery created by background artists that were trimmed into shapes and attached to the cels.<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c

The appearance and disappearance of an [[analog television]]'s [[cathode ray tube|cathode ray]]-generated images as a channel was switched or the set turned off was further simulated by using a photo [[compositing]] technique, as it was felt employing a simple [[dissolve (filmmaking)|camera fade]] would reduce the realism of the effect.<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c \u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u753b\u9762\u304c\u6d88\u3048\u305f\u30ea\u3001\u6620\u3063\u305f\u30ea\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067\u306f\u3001\u30d5\u30a7\u2014\u30c9\u3092\u4f7f\u3046\u3068\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u753b\u9762\u3089\u3057\u304f\u306a\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u306e\u3067\u3001\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u753b\u9762\u4e0a\u306e\u7d75\u306f\u30aa\u30d7\u30c1\u30ab\u30eb\u5408\u6210\u3067\u5165\u308c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002\u30b9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u304c\u5165\u308b\u3068\u30d0\u30c3\u3068\u5e83\u304c\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6620\u308b\u77ac\u9593\u306e\u8868\u73fe\u4e0a\u3053\u306e\u6280\u8853\u306f\u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3060\u3002\u3055\u3089\u306b\u5168\u4f53\u304c\u30e2\u30b6\u30a4\u30af\u72b6\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u306f\u3001\u87a2\u5149\u706f\u306e\u30ab\u30d0\u30fc\u306b\u4f7f\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30ae\u30b6\u30ae\u30b6\u5165\u30ea\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30ea\u30eb\u677f\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u305f\u3081\u3002\u305d\u306e\u30ab\u30d0\u30fc\u3092\u30bb\u30eb\u306e\u4e0a\u306b\u304a\u304d\u3001\u52d5\u304b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3001\u5c11\u3057\u53d7\u50cf\u72b6\u614b\u304c\u826f\u304f\u306a\u3044\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u753b\u9762\u3089\u3057\u304f\u898b\u3048\u308b\u306e\u3060\u3002\u4f55\u6c17\u306a\u3044\u5de5\u592b\u3060\u304c\u3001\u3053\u3046\u3057\u305f\u5de5\u592b\u306e\u7a4d\u307f\u91cd\u306d\u304c\u6280\u8853\u306e\u5411\u4e0a\u3092\u751f\u307f\u51fa\u3059\u3002\u7d20\u4eba\u306e\u4f5c\u30ea\u51fa\u3059\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u306b\u3082\u7d20\u6674\u3057\u3044\u3082\u306e\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u305a\u306b\u3002\u3053\u306e\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u753b\u9762\u306e\u64ae\u5f71\u3092\u3057\u305f\u306e\u306f\u3001\u64ae\u5f71\u5c02\u9580\u306e\u30c6\u30a3\u2022\u30cb\u30b7\u30e0\u30e9\u306e\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u300d}}{{harvnb|Studio Hard|1987|p=68}}</ref> The TV screen images were shot at the T Nishimura studio, a photography specialist that would later contribute to 1989's ''[[Patlabor: The Movie]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Naito|Saito| 2006|p=4}}</ref>\n\nIsakawa described the technical challenges he faced in filming Gainax's work on ''Royal Space Force'', with some individual cuts created by using as many as 12 photographic levels consisting of cels, [[superimposition]] layers, and sheets of paper [[Masking (art)|masks]] designed to capture isolated areas of different colored transmitted light (a photographic technique useable with [[translucent]] items such as animation cels, where the image can also be illuminated by light passing through the object, rather than only by reflected light). Some of the cel layers arrived with dust and scratches, which posed additional difficulties for Isakawa; he considered obscuring them with the popular method of employing a [[Polarizing filter (photography)|polarizing filter]], but felt he could not use the technique, as such filters also obscured fine details in the cel art. Isakawa remarked that Gainax had however largely avoided what he described as the common errors in the anime industry of cels not being long enough for their background paintings, or having misaligned attachment points to [[Traditional animation#Animation|peg bars]].<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c\u3060\u304b\u3089\u91cd\u306d\u308b\u306812\u679a\u304f\u3089\u3044\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\u5168\u90e8\u304c\u30bb\u30eb\u3068\u3044\u3046\u308f\u3051\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u304c\u5165\u3063\u305f\u308a\u900f\u904e\u5149\u306e\u30e9\u30b7\u30e3\u7d19\u306e\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u3060\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3001\u305d\u308c\u306712\u679a\u306a\u3093\u3066\u3044\u3046\u306e\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3051\u3069\u306d\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3060\u304b\u3089\u4e2d\u306b\u306f\u6c5a\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3093\u3067\u4eca\u6d41\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308bPL\u30d5\u30a3\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u4f7f\u304a\u3046\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3067\u3082\u3001\u3042\u308c\u306f\u30c7\u30a3\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb\u304c\u6f70\u308c\u3061\u3083\u3046\u3093\u3067\u7f8e\u8853\u306e\u65b9\u304c\u56f0\u308b\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3088\u306d\u3002\u3060\u304b\u3089\u307b\u3053\u308a\u3084\u30bb\u30eb\u50b7\u304c\u51c4\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306f\u304b\u306a\u308a\u3057\u3093\u3069\u3044\u601d\u3044\u3092\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3088\u304f\u30bb\u30eb\u306e\u9577\u3055\u304c\u8db3\u308a\u306a\u3044\u3068\u304b\u30bf\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u4ed8\u3051\u65b9\u304c\u307e\u3061\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3068\u304b\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3063\u305f\u70b9\u306f\u6700\u521d\u306b\u30ad\u30c1\u30c3\u3068\u3084\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3089\u3057\u304f\u30c8\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u7121\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\u300d}}{{harvnb|Matsushita|1987|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> Another challenging aspect for Isakawa involved motion rather than light, such as conveying the heavy vibrations of Marty's motorcycle, or the air force plane cockpit; whereas ordinarily such scenes would be filmed while shaking the cels and the backgrounds as a unit, Gainax insisted that the elements be shaken separately.<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c\u7279\u306b\u3001\u3042\u306e\u98db\u884c\u6a5f\u306b\u4e57\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u3001\u5916\u306e\u666f\u8272\u3068\u30b3\u30af\u30d4\u30c3\u30c8\u306e\u4e21\u65b9\u304c\u6447\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u611f\u3058\u3092\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\u666e\u901a\u3060\u3068\u5168\u90e8\u304c\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u6447\u308c\u3061\u3083\u3046\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u666f\u8272\u3068\u30b3\u30af\u30d4\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u5225\u306b\u6447\u308c\u3066\u30c0\u30d6\u30e9\u30b7\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3002\u3042\u3068\u30aa\u30fc\u30c8\u30d0\u30a4\u306b\u4e57\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u3001\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u4e57\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u304c\u63fa\u308c\u3066\u5411\u3053\u3046\u306e\u5c71\u3082\u6447\u308c\u308b\u3068\u304b\u3001\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306e\u8981\u671b\u304c\u304b\u306a\u308a\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u306d\u3002\u300d}}{{harvnb|Matsushita|1987|p=207}}</ref>\n\nYamaga and Shinji Higuchi, who also served as assistant director of photography on the film,<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c\u305d\u306e\u3078\u3093\u306e\u64ae\u5f71\u306e\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u7684\u306a\u8981\u671b\u306f\u3001\u5c71\u8cc0(\u535a\u4e4b)\u76e3\u7763\u306a\u308a\u64ae\u5f71\u306e\u52a9\u76e3\u7763\u3067\u3042\u308b\u6a0b\u53e3 (\u771f\u55e3)\u3055\u3093\u304b\u3089\u3069\u3046\u3044\u3046\u5f62\u3067\u8868\u73fe\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u300d}}{{harvnb|Matsushita|1987|p=207}}</ref> had Isakawa watch ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' and showed him [[NASA]] photos as a reference for the look they wished to achieve in certain shots.

They have a firm grasp of history, and they don't shy away from the parts in this film that adults have avoided; they call out the lies, while at the same time, each one of them puts in their work with sincerity.\"<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c\u7acb\u6d3e\u306a\u82f1\u96c4\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3002\u3002\u3002\u30b7\u30ed\u30c4\u30b0\u304c\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304f\u8a71\u3067\u3059\u3088\u306d\u3002\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u8a71\u306b\u3069\u308c\u3060\u3051\u8aac\u5f97\u529b\u3092\u6301\u305f\u305b\u3089\u308c\u308b\u304b\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306a\u3093\u3060\u3051\u3069\u3001[\u738b\u7acb\u5b87\u5b99\u8ecd]\u306f\u305d\u308c\u306f\u305a\u3044\u3076\u3093\u3042\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3046\u3057\u3002\u500b\u4eba\u306e\u6210\u9577\u304c\u3044\u3064\u306e\u307e\u306b\u304b\u6b74\u53f2\u306e\u6210\u9577\u306b\u7d99\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u304f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3088\u306d\u3002\u305d\u306e\u6210\u9577\u306e\u679c\u3066\u306b\u3042\u308b\u3082\u306e\u304c\u6bb5\u3005\u3068\u898b\u3048\u3066\u304f\u308b\u3002\u305d\u306e\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c\u51c4\u304f\u58ee\u5927\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3088\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3002\u3053\u3046\u3044\u3046\u4f5c\u54c1\u309224\u624d\u306e\u4eba\u304c\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u304c\u51c4\u3044\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u3053\u3046\u3044\u3046\u4eba\u304c\u51fa\u3066\u304f\u308b\u3093\u3060\u306a\u3042\u3068\u3044\u3046\u306e\u304c\u5b09\u3057\u3044\u3057\u3001\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093\u3068\u51fa\u3066\u304d\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3069\u3053\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u3042\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3051\u3069\u306d\u3002\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3093\u611f\u3058\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u306e\u306f\u2026\u50d5\u9054\u3082\u542b\u3081\u3066\u5927\u4eba\u3063\u3066\u300e\u8fd1\u9803\u306e\u82e5\u3044\u8005\u306f\u300f\u3068\u304b\u8272\u3005\u3068\u8a00\u3046\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\u3067\u3082\u5b9f\u306f\u305d\u3046\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u82e5\u3044\u8005\u306f\u5927\u4eba\u304c\u3082\u3046\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u306a\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u3068\u3066\u3082\u8efd\u3005\u3068\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\u6b74\u53f2\u3082\u3057\u3063\u304b\u308a\u628a\u63e1\u3057\u3066\u4eca\u307e\u3067\u5927\u4eba\u9054\u304c\u6620\u753b\u306e\u5618\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u9003\u3052\u3066\u3044\u305f\u90e8\u5206\u3092\u9003\u3052\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3072\u3068\u3064\u305a\u3064\u8aa0\u5b9f\u306b\u4ed5\u4e8b\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u3053\u3046\u3068\u3059\u308b\u3001\u305d\u3046\u3044\u3046\u82e5\u3055\u306e\u53b6\u30af\u53b6\u30af\u3068\u6e67\u304d\u3042\u304c\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b\u6050\u3055\u3092\u3044\u3061\u3070\u3093\u611f\u3058\u3066\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\u300d}}{{harvnb|Matsushita|1987|p=209}}</ref>\n\nYayoi commented that Yamaga had described Riquinni to her as \"uncompromising in her beliefs, and this could be seen as hardheadedness and causing problems or discomfort to those around her.

One imagines that investors hoped to bootstrap a new ''[[Gundam]]'' or a new ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (disambiguation)|Yamato]]'' out of nothing, which might have explained the enthusiasm during production for a possible movie sequel or television spin-off.{{efn| Okada describes the idea for a TV anime series spinoff as originating from a split at Bandai between executives in one group who simply regarded the film as a loss for the company and wished to move on, and those in another group who believed it could still eventually become a successful investment. Around June of 1987, this \"success\" faction suggested to Okada and Yamaga that ''Royal Space Force'' could be developed into a TV anime series that would begin airing in April of 1988. Yamaga and Okada began to discuss the outline of a 52-episode weekly series that would expand the background events of the film\u2019s story. In the outline, the space program itself would not get underway within the TV series until the fall, several months into the show; it would be preceded by a major plot event, the first  [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear test]] within the alternate world of ''Royal Space Force'', giving military significance to the development of the rocket as a possible [[Nuclear weapons delivery|delivery system]]. Yamaga desired that the nuclear test storyline be featured in an August episode, to coincide with the anniversary of  [[Surrender of Japan|the end of the Second World War]]. At the time, Okada compared the outline\u2019s structure to the approach taken in [[Isao Takahata]]\u2019s 1976 ''[[3000 Leagues in Search of Mother]]'', itself a one-year series where the eponymous search does not begin until the fourth month. As the planning for the TV series consisted only of conversations, Okada felt he could not say how serious Yamaga was about the show, but in retrospect compared Yamaga\u2019s ideas for episodes peripheral to the main narrative to [[Shin Takahashi]]\u2019s ''[[Saikano]]'', as well as to ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', whose episodes Okada described as \"branches and leaves\" that enriched the main storyline.

In either case, they won't be able to do the kind of pure moviemaking the way they have up until now. So it's their last time in that sense.

Okada considered that it had been a \"natural\" request from a sponsor's perspective, as a movie theater would give four daily showings to a two-hour film, but six if it were only 80 minutes, opening the possibility of 50% more ticket sales. At the time, however, Okada refused, arguing that the box office performance was not part of his job, and telling the theatrical distributor and Bandai in a meeting that if they wanted to cut the film by even 20 minutes, they might as well cut off Okada's arm. In retrospect, Okada felt that he had acted like a child, but that \"creators are all children,\" and if they were making something new and interesting, then in the end everyone involved should profit; he acknowledged, however, that in the meantime it was the \"grown-ups\" who had to deal with the risks and problems along the way, yet to him, acting like such a \"responsible adult\" would

It's a matter of quality, and it's not possible to maintain this level. Or that may be the case. So I think they did a great job, and yet from a professional perspective, they've made something that's a problem. When you look at it from the viewpoint of the anime industry, it must be very difficult to make something on this level. I've recently come to understand just how demanding it was for them to put make this piece by piece. And once it comes out, it'll set a new standard, won't it? If whatever comes next doesn't equal or surpass it, then it'll be a regression in terms of quality ... [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|achieved the peak [in animation] 50 years ago.]] You can't surpass them. Even if [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] or someone like that tries, it would only be an extension of what Disney did, but it wouldn't surpass it.

This is a movie that's come in for a lot of different praise, as well as criticism. However, it's a work that basically, I wish to support ... The question I raise though isn't so much about the film itself; it's about the core business thinking behind the release of this film. I was pleased to see Bandai enter into anime filmmaking. But why did they produce as their first film project a movie with no product development behind it, which, being a toy company, is their biggest strength? And why didn't they use a smaller budget, so as to make their profit at the box office? If their wish was to create a sustained filmmaking business, they should have aimed to make certain that their premiere release was a financial success by maximizing their commercial advantages on it. To be blunt, it was too risky a bet to have a movie like ''The Wings of Honn\u00eaamise'' be their first film. They should have made it their third or fourth.\" \n| source = \u2014Tetsuo Daitoku, 1988<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c\u305d\u3057\u3066\u6771\u5b9d\u6d0b\u753b\u7cfb\u306e\u300e\u30aa\u30cd\u30a2\u30df\u30b9\u306e\u7ffc\u300f\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u306a\u306b\u304b\u3068\u6bc0\u8a89\u8912\u8cb6\u306e\u591a\u3044\u6620\u753b\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308b\u304c\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306b\u306f\u50d5\u306f\u3053\u306e\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u652f\u6301\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3002\u3002\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u50d5\u304c\u7591\u554f\u306b\u601d\u3063\u305f\u306e\u306f\u3001\u4f5c\u54c1\u8ad6\u7684\u306a\u554f\u984c\u3088\u308a\u3082\u3001\u6620\u753b\u3092\u516c\u958b\u306b\u81f3\u3089\u305b\u308b\u307e\u3067\u306e\u30d0\u30c3\u30af\u30dc\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002\u30d0\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u304c\u76f4\u63a5\u306b\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u6620\u753b\u88fd\u4f5c\u306b\u4e57\u308a\u51fa\u3059\u3053\u3068\u306f\u559c\u3070\u3057\u3044\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3001\u306a\u305c\u30aa\u30e2\u30c1\u30e3\u4f1a\u793e\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u6700\u5927\u306e\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u3042\u308b\u5546\u54c1\u5c55\u958b\u3092\u629c\u304d\u306b\u3057\u305f\u4f5c\u54c1\u3092\u7b2c\uff11\u4f5c\u76ee\u3068\u3057\u3066\u88fd\u4f5c\u3057\u305f\u306e\u3060\u308d\u3046\u304b\uff1f\u307e\u305f\u3001\u8208\u884c\u9762\u3067\u306e\u7d50\u679c\u4e88\u7b97\u3092\u306a\u305c\u3082\u3063\u3068\u30c4\u30e1\u305f\u4e0a\u3067\u4f5c\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3060\u308d\u3046\u304b\uff1f\u6620\u753b\u3092\u305d\u308c\u4ee5\u5f8c\u3082\u6301\u7d9a\u7684\u306b\u88fd\u4f5c\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u8003\u3048\u305f\u306e\u306a\u3089\u3070\u3001\u4f01\u696d\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u5546\u696d\u7684\u306a\u30e1\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u6700\u5927\u9650\u306b\u6d3b\u7528\u3057\u3066\u3001\u7b2c\uff11\u4f5c\u76ee\u306f\u306a\u306b\u304c\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3082\u8208\u884c\u7684\u306b\u6210\u529f\u3055\u305b\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3060\u308d\u3046\u304b\u3002\u306f\u3063\u304d\u308a\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u300e\u30aa\u30cd\u30a2\u30df\u30b9\u306e\u7ffc\u300f\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u306f\u7b2c\uff13\u4f5c\u76ee\u3001\uff14\u4f5c\u76ee\u306b\u4f5c\u308b\u3079\u304d\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u7b2c\uff11\u4f5c\u76ee\u306b\u6301\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b\u306e\u306b\u306f\u3042\u307e\u308a\u306b\u30ea\u30b9\u30af\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u8ced\u3051\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3088\u3046\u306a\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b\u3002\u300d}}{{harvnb|Daitoku|1988|p=73}}</ref>\n| width = 20%}}\n\nTo Yamashina, the contrast spoke to a paramount issue dating back to the original proposal for ''Royal Space Force''\u2014whether the creators were correct in their understanding of what their generation was truly looking for in a film; the pre-release research and test audience reactions had left Yamashina personally uncertain on this question: \"I'm afraid that the theaters will be deserted, and no one will go to see the movie.\"<ref>{{lang|ja|\u300c \u300e\u50d5\u306e\u5fc3\u914d\u306f\u6620\u753b\u9928\u306b\u9591\u53e4\u9ce5\u304c\u5165\u3063\u3066\u8ab0\u3082\u6620\u753b\u898b\u306b\u884c\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3001\u3053\u308c\u304c\u6050\u3044\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\u300f\u300d}}{{ harvnb|Saitani|1987|p=49}}</ref> On the other hand, Yamashina repeated his concern for the implications if the film did turn out to be a hit: \"If this is the [new] line that Yamaga is setting out, then filmmakers in the future are going to have to follow this line,\" suggesting that the previous assumptions about movies \"will all get blown away ...

We may try to bestow humanistic meanings to the universe, but it is essentially indifferent to us and beyond our interpretations. The history of human civilization teaches us that \"purposes\" and \"missions\" are often used as sacrosanct excuses to commit violence. It is accepted as a truism that humans need to fight for some ideal goals to sustain civilization. At one point in [''Royal Space Force''], an interviewer asks Shirotsugh to talk about the \"purpose\" (''shimei'') of his mission. Shirotsugh does not know how to answer this question ... but he is certainly affected by the question. The later part of the movie suggests that Shirotsugh\u2019s adamant ignorance or, say, innocence implies that not having a purpose is his purpose; his mission has a point because it is blatantly useless. In fact, every military man and politician ridicules his mission ... Shirotsugh\u2019s lack of purpose (which also means not having a military force to destroy or to subjugate others) is an oblique political gesture against intrinsically war-driven human civilization, yet he still cannot escape from such a world in turmoil.

He maintained that art must find the same 'empty space' to revolutionize itself.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Matsui|2007 |p=87}}</ref> ''Sea Breeze'' was \"...&nbsp;contained in a square box on wheels...when switched on, the intense heat and dazzling flash of the lights evoke the moment of its launch...Gainax represented, for Murakami, a model of marginalized yet cutting-edge cultural production. Referring to their film was Murakami's homage to Gainax's independent spirit. At the same time, the fact that the burning wheel was contained inside a box signified passion confined within a conventional frame, evoking the failure of ''Honneamise'' to present a uniquely Japanese expression as it remained under the influence of Western science-fiction films.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Matsui|2007 |p=89}}</ref> Murakami would later assert, two years after its initial debut, that ''Sea Breeze'' \"does not have any concept. Just an enormous work [whose] ground of art is collapsed,\" yet in 1999 remarked further of the piece that, \"sadly, this indoor artworld spectacle was the closest the Japanese would get to a space program\".<ref>{{harvnb| Friis-Hansen |2000 |p=41}}</ref>\n\nMurakami would express a specific historical conception of otaku during a discussion with Toshio Okada conducted for the 2005 exhibition ''[[Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture]]'', addressing Okada with the premise: \"After Japan experienced defeat in [[World War II]], it gave birth to a distinctive phenomenon, which has gradually degenerated into a uniquely Japanese culture ... [you] are at the very center of this ''otaku'' culture\",<ref>{{harvnb|Morikawa|Murakami| Okada| 2005|p=165}}</ref> further asserting in an essay for the exhibit catalog that therefore \"''otaku'' ... all are ultimately defined by their relentless references to a humiliated self\".<ref>{{harvnb|Murakami| 2005|p=132}}</ref> This historical positioning of otaku culture would itself be challenged through an analysis of ''Royal Space Force'' by Viktor Eikman, who cites Murakami's statement in the same essay that the anime studio that made the film occupied \"a central place in the current anime world... [they were] professionally incorporated as Gainax in 1984 upon production of the feature-length anime ''The Wings of Honneamise'' (released in 1987)\"<ref>{{harvnb|Murakami| 2005|p=127}}</ref> but that the two Gainax works discussed by Murakami in his theory of otaku were the ''[[Daicon III and IV Opening Animations|Daicon IV Opening Animation]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''. Eikman argues that the theory should be tested also against \"other works by the same studio, made by the same people for the same audience, but not analysed [in the essay] by Murakami\".<ref>{{harvnb| Eikman |2007 |pp=7\u20138}}</ref> Of ''Royal Space Force'', Eikman contended, \"At most we may view the humiliated Shiro\u2019s mission as symbolic of Japan\u2019s desire to join the [[Space Race]] in particular and the 'big boy' struggles of the [[Cold War]] in general, a desire which plays into the sense of childish impotence described by Murakami, but even that is a very speculative hypothesis,\" arguing that \"it is remarkably hard to find parallels to World War II\" in the film. Eikman proposes a possible \"weak analogy\" in ''Royal Space Force'' to the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] through the theory of an [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory|opposing nation being permitted]] to attack the launch site in order to provide a ''[[casus belli]]'', but suggests such an analogy would \"inappropriately cast Shiro as an American\".<ref>{{harvnb| Eikman |2007 |p=30}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004's ''The Cinema Effect'', a historical survey examining film through \"the question of [[temporality]]\",<ref>{{harvnb| Cubitt |2004 |p=5}}</ref> Sean Cubitt presents an argument grouping ''Royal Space Force'' together with [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]]\u2019s ''[[1942: A Love Story]]'' and [[Tsui Hark]]\u2019s ''[[Once Upon a Time in China]]'' as examples of \"revisionary\" films, distinct from [[Historical revisionism|\"revisionist\"]] works in that they \"do not so much revise [their] history as revision it, look into it with a new mode of envisioning the relationship between the past and the present ... they displace the fate of the present, opening instead a vista onto an elsewhere...ready to forsake the Western ideal of realism [for] the possibility of understanding how they might remake the past and so make the present other than it is.\"<ref>{{harvnb| Cubitt |2004 |p=321}}</ref> Cubitt proposes that in ''Royal Space Force'' \"the future emerges as an alternative past ... the film envisions [a country of] [[lamplighter]]s and steam trains, trams, and prop-driven warplanes, a universe that the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji modernization]] ... might have arrived at had it not been urged along other routes by its exposure to Western technology.\"<ref>{{harvnb| Cubitt |2004 |p=303}}</ref> A [[diegesis]] structured between town and country is seen by Cubitt in the persons of Shiro and Riquinni and their evocation of the \"urban-rural continuum\" present in Japan's particular experience of modernization, dependent upon \"the mythic standing of rice as the medium of 'commensality,' of sharing, hospitality, connection to the gods, the environment, and the cycles of sexual reproduction. In the imaginary country of Honn\u00eaamise, the humble bowl of 'terish' seems to work in the same way, a dish whose origin is not clarified in a brief shot of harvesting what might be wheat or millet. The offering and sharing of food brings the stranger into the community in a way that idle urban drinking and gambling cannot.\"<ref>{{harvnb| Cubitt |2004 |pp=304\u2013305}}</ref>\n\nCubitt, like Murakami, references the historical consequences of World War II, but in citing a speech by Japan's first postwar prime minister [[Naruhiko Higashikuni]] on the need for \"nationwide collective repentance,\" suggests that such repentance is \"the theme that seems to resonate in the curious, slow budding\" of ''Royal Space Force'' through Riquinni's \"homemade religion of renunciation and impending judgment\"<ref>{{harvnb| Cubitt |2004 |pp=303\u2013304}}</ref> arguing that such a philosophy is evoked also through the film's animation style: \"Often a minor fluctuation is all there is to denote the atmosphere or emotion of a scene ... The appeal to a sophisticated audience's ability to decipher these small motions grows into an overall impression of lassitude before a world and a life well worth renouncing\" and that \"the two major action sequences, the chase and death of the assassin and the launch sequence, cut in the frame, the edit and the construction of depth, but they resolve into the absolute indifference of movements in equilibrium. Like the zero of the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8res']] flickering views, the action of [''Royal Space Force''] sums at nothingness, a zero degree of the political that removes its resolution from history, and from time itself, into the atemporal zone denoted by Shirotsugh's orbit ... an empty place from which alone the strife of warfare and suffering sinks into pure regret, not so much an  [[End of history|end]] as an exit from history.\"<ref>{{harvnb| Cubitt |2004 |p=307}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, Shu Kuge, in a 2007 essay in the journal ''[[Mechademia]]'', sees Shiro's position in space at film's end as \"not the denial of history but the empathetic move to accept the cruel world without translating it into a metaphysical meaning\".<ref>{{harvnb|Kuge|2007|p=253}}</ref> Kuge groups the connection between Shiro and Riquinni with that between Mikako Nagamine and Noboru Terao in [[Makoto Shinkai]]'s ''[[Voices of a Distant Star]]'' as examples of a personal connection that, although under different circumstances in each story, is in either case a relationship sustained by the spatial distance between two people: \"[they] sustain the distance rather than shrink it because sustaining ... is crucial for their relationships to be vast and generous. The topological relationship between the floating and the remaining is actually a [[mimesis]] of a stellar relationship, such as the moon and the earth, the earth and the sun. Repetitive references to 'stars' in these movies should not be understood as metaphors; the characters in these anime aspire to become stars in space so as to overcome human dimensions...\"<ref>{{harvnb| Kuge |2007|pp=256\u2013257}}</ref> Kuge suggests a mutual personal attraction is indeed present between Riquinni and Shiro, but that \"Riquinni maintains distance from Shirotsugh and leaves herself as an [[That Obscure Object of Desire|object of desire somewhat obscure]], probably because she fears that physical proximity as well as the clarity of her interest diminishes a certain degree of her and his curiosity in their relationship. It is not that she is a tease, but she seems to know that ongoing curiosity, a drive toward the unknown, makes life more valuable; therefore, they can take care of each other better. In other words, the unknown should be sustained. Spatially speaking, curiosity is possible when the contact of the two bodies is suspended.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kuge|2007|pp=255\u2013256}}</ref>\n\nKuge further asserts \"...&nbsp;They 'communicate' best when they have a physical distance between them...Shirotsugh visits Riquinni the day before he leaves for his mission, but she is not at home. He then hops into a trolley car, and Riquinni almost simultaneously steps out from the same car. She turns and recognizes Shirotsugh on board. They do not talk, but she smiles at him. As the trolley car\nslowly begins to move, Shirotsugh smiles back, saying 'Ittekimasu,' which literally means 'I am going,' a greeting that can be uttered only between family members and close friends.{{efn| Riquinni responds with \"itterasshai\", which would also be the expected familiar reply of one who awaits a person's return. Kuge, a Japanese artist writing in English, makes note of the usages of the film's original language at several points in his analysis, including observing that \"Shirotsugh\" is an alternate [[romanization]] of an actual given name in Japanese, {{nihongo||\u300c\u4ee3\u6b21\u300d\u300c\u56db\u90ce\u6b21\u300d| Shirotsugu }}.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuge|2007|p=252}}</ref>}} This scene lasts for less than thirty seconds, yet it demonstrates effectively and poetically what their relationship ''is.'' The physical distance between these two people connects them and sustains them in a particular continuity, although they appear not to share the same space. The same continuity also preserves the erotic energy between them. Collapsing this distance can mean the end of their relationship.\"<ref>{{harvnb| Kuge |2007|p=255}}</ref> Noting the struggle between the armed forces of Honn\u00eaamise and the Republic to control the same physical territory, Kuge comments that by contrast the Royal Space Force does not in fact \"possess any military force,\" and suggests that likewise the personal nature of Shiro and Riquinni's relationship depends upon respecting the physical separation and boundaries that she seeks to maintain and which he seeks to violate, and does violate, before they are reaffirmed in the latter part of the film. \"It is not a coincidence that Shirotsugh's enthusiasm for space arises right after he meets Riquinni, who promotes the world of\n''[[Myth#Meanings in Ancient Greece|mythos]]'' that preserves the unknown (because it does not inquire about the 'essence' of all that is), instead of that of ''[[logos]]'', or logical reasoning, which rationalizes physical phenomena. As she sustains her distance from him, his curiosity toward her is also transposed to an unknown territory, that is, outer space. When Shirotsugh reaches the unknown, there is no physical contact. All he can do is float. He seems to realize that the world indeed has no boundaries; in fact, he can float in this one continuous spatiality that includes everything. Being sustained by this vast distance, Shirotsugh prays, as if it were the only way to tell others the grandeur of this world.\"<ref>{{harvnb| Kuge |2007|p=256}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Uru in Blue}}\n\nDuring 1992\u201393, [[Gainax]] developed plans for a sequel to ''Royal Space Force'' to be entitled ''Aoki Uru'' (also known under the titles ''Uru in Blue'' and ''Blue Uru''); an anime film project to be directed by [[Hideaki Anno]] and scripted by [[Hiroyuki Yamaga]], with [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]] serving as its chief animation director and character designer. Although a full storyboard, partial script, and an extensive collection of design illustrations were produced for ''Aoki Uru'',<ref>{{harvnb|Gainax|1998}}</ref> the project had been initiated without a secured budget, and its development occurred within a period of personal, financial, and managerial crises at Gainax that contributed to the indefinite suspension of work on ''Aoki Uru'' in July 1993; the studio instead shifted to producing as their next anime project the TV series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Takeda|2005|pp=154\u2013161, 164\u2013165}}</ref> In the years following 1993, Gainax has made occasional announcements regarding a revival of the ''Aoki Uru'' concept, including a [[multimedia]] proposal in the late 1990s, and the formal announcement of an English name for the film, ''Uru in Blue'', at the 2013 [[Tokyo Anime Fair]].
