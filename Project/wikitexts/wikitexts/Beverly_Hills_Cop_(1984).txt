[[Judge Reinhold]], [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]], [[Ronny Cox]], [[Lisa Eilbacher]], [[Steven Berkoff]], [[Paul Reiser]], and [[Jonathan Banks]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nThis first film in the [[Beverly Hills Cop (franchise)|''Beverly Hills Cop'' franchise]] shot Murphy to international stardom, won the [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for \"Favorite Motion Picture\" and was nominated for both the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] in 1985. It was an immediate [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], receiving critical acclaim and earning $234 million at the North American domestic box office, making it the highest-grossing film released in 1984 in the U.S.\n\n==Plot==\nYoung and reckless [[Detroit Police Department]] detective Axel Foley's latest unauthorized [[sting operation]] goes sour when two uniformed officers intervene, resulting in a high-speed chase through the city that causes widespread damage. His superior, Inspector Douglas Todd reprimands Axel for his behavior and threatens to fire him unless he changes his ways on the force. Axel arrives at his apartment to find it has been broken into by his childhood friend, Michael (Mikey) Tandino. When they were kids, Mikey and Axel committed grand theft auto together, and Mikey took the rap for it and served time in prison.  He ended up working as a security guard in Beverly Hills thanks to a mutual childhood friend, Jenny Summers. Mikey shows Axel some [[West Germany|German]] [[bearer bond]]s and Axel wonders how he got them, but chooses not to question him about it. After hanging out at a bar, they return to Axel's apartment where two men, Zack and Casey knock Axel unconscious, confront Mikey about the bearer bonds and then kill him.\n\nAxel asks to investigate Mikey's murder, but Inspector Todd refuses to allow it because of his close ties to Mikey. Axel uses the guise of taking vacation time to head to Beverly Hills to solve the crime alone. He finds Jenny working in an art gallery and learns about Mikey's ties to Victor Maitland, the gallery's owner. Posing as a flower deliveryman, Axel goes to Maitland's office and tries to question him about Mikey, but is thrown out a window by Maitland's bodyguards and arrested. At the police station, Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil assigns Sergeant John Taggart and Detective Billy Rosewood to follow Axel. Taggart and Billy have a humiliating encounter with Axel when he sabotages their car. As a result, Billy and Taggart do not get along with Axel at first, but the three do begin to develop a mutual respect after they foil a robbery at a [[striptease]] bar.\n\nOn the trail of Mikey's killers, Axel sneaks into one of Maitland's [[warehouse]]s, where he finds crates full of [[coffee grounds]], which he suspects were used to pack [[drugs]] while covering their scent from police dogs. He also discovers that many of Maitland's crates have not gone through customs. After being arrested again, this time after a battle with Zack at Maitland's country club, Axel admits to Bogomil that Maitland must be a smuggler. Police Chief Hubbard, who has learned of Axel's ill-advised investigative actions, orders that Axel be escorted out of town. However, Axel convinces Billy to pick up Jenny instead and take her with them to the warehouse, where a shipment is due to arrive that day.\n\nAxel and Jenny break into the warehouse and discover several bags of cocaine inside a crate. Before Axel can get this newfound evidence to  Billy, Maitland and his associates arrive. Maitland takes Jenny and leaves Axel to be killed, but not before Zack admits to Axel he was the one who killed Mikey. After some hesitation, Billy enters the warehouse and rescues Axel during a brief gunfight in which he kills Casey. Taggart tracks Axel and Billy to Maitland's estate, where he joins the two in their efforts to rescue Jenny and bring Maitland to justice. Together, the trio wipe out a number of Maitland's men, including Zack. With Bogomil's help, Axel then fatally shoots Maitland and rescues Jenny. Bogomil fabricates a story to Hubbard that covers for all the participants without discrediting the Beverly Hills PD. Realizing that his exploits while \"on vacation\" are likely to get him thrown off the Detroit police force, Axel requests that Bogomil straighten matters over with Inspector Todd; when Axel mentions the possibility of setting up shop as a [[Private investigator|PI]] in Beverly Hills, Bogomil nervously agrees to wipe the slate clean for him. Later, Taggart and Billy meet Axel as he checks out of his hotel, and pay his bill. Axel invites them to join him for a farewell drink, and they accept the offer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Detective [[Axel Foley]]\n* [[Judge Reinhold]] as Detective William \"Billy\" Rosewood\n* [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]] as Sergeant John Taggart\n* [[Lisa Eilbacher]] as Jeanette \"Jenny\" Summers\n* [[Steven Berkoff]] as Victor Maitland\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Zack\n* [[James Russo]] as Michael \"Mikey\" Tandino\n* [[Stephen Elliott (actor)|Stephen Elliott]] as Chief Hubbard\n* [[Paul Reiser]] as Jeffrey\n* [[Michael Champion]] as Casey\n* [[Frank Pesce]] as Cigarette Buyer\n* [[Gil Hill|Gilbert R.

Stallone has said that his script for ''Beverly Hills Cop'' would have \"looked like the opening scene from ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' on the beaches of Normandy. Believe it or not, the finale was me in a stolen [[Lamborghini]] playing chicken with an oncoming freight train being driven by the ultra-slimy bad guy.\"<ref name=\"CBR\"/> However, Stallone's ideas were deemed \"too expensive\" for Paramount to produce and Stallone ultimately pulled out two weeks before filming was to start. Stallone would later use the bulk of these ideas as the basis for the 1986 film ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]''. Two days later, the film's producers, Simpson and Bruckheimer, convinced Eddie Murphy to replace Stallone in the film, prompting more rewrites.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/16/movies/exit-stallone-enter-eddie-murphy.html |title=EXIT STALLONE, ENTER EDDIE MURPHY |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Gruson |first=Linsey |date=1984-12-16 |access-date=2014-06-12 |archive-date=December 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215224144/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/16/movies/exit-stallone-enter-eddie-murphy.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Besides Stallone and Rourke, other actors who were considered for the role of Axel Foley included [[Richard Pryor]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[James Caan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/2014/05/20-fascinating-facts-about-the-beverly-hills-cop-franchise/|title=20 Fascinating Facts About The 'Beverly Hills Cop' Franchise|work=The New York Times|last=Gruson|first=Linsey|date=1984-12-16|access-date=2014-06-12|archive-date=June 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614101124/http://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/2014/05/20-fascinating-facts-about-the-beverly-hills-cop-franchise/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Harrison Ford]] was offered the role of Axel Foley but turned it down.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&dat=19850201&id=UPAaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U0cEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5682,286642&hl=en |title = Daily News - Google News Archive Search}}</ref>\n\nThe film was budgeted at $14 million, including $4 million for Murphy, but was brought in at a cost of just $13 million.<ref name=budget/>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{main|Beverly Hills Cop (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack was released on [[MCA Records]] and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media]] (1986).
