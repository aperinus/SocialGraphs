The screenplay by [[Julian Barry]] is based on his play of the same name.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film jumps between various sections of Bruce's life, including scenes of when he was in his prime and the burned-out, strung-out performer who, in the twilight of his life, used his nightclub act to pour out his personal frustrations. We watch as up-and-coming Bruce courts his \"[[Shiksa]] goddess,\" a stripper named Honey. With family responsibilities, Lenny is encouraged to do a \"safe\" act, but he cannot do it. Constantly in trouble for flouting obscenity laws, Lenny develops a near-messianic complex which fuels both his comedy genius and his talent for self-destruction. Worn out by a lifetime of tilting at establishment windmills, Lenny Bruce dies of a [[morphine]] overdose in 1966.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Lenny Bruce]]\n* [[Valerie Perrine]] as [[Honey Bruce]]\n* [[Jan Miner]] as [[Sally Marr]]\n* [[Stanley Beck]] as Artie Silver\n* Rashel Novikoff as Aunt Mema\n* [[Gary Morton]] as Sherman Hart\n* Guy Rennie as Jack Goldman\n* Aldo Demeo as Bailiff\n\n==Release==\nLenny opened at Cinema I in New York City on November 10, 1974, and grossed a house record $14,981 in its first day.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title='Prince' Gives N.Y.
