S. Wilson]], written by Maddock, Wilson, and Underwood and starring [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Finn Carter]], [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]], and [[Reba McEntire]].\n\nIn the film, handymen Val McKee (Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Ward) try to skip the small desert town of Perfection, Nevada, tired of their dull lives. However, they happen upon a series of mysterious deaths and a concerned seismologist Rhonda (Carter) studying unnatural readings below the ground. With the help of eccentric [[survivalist]] couple Burt and Heather Gummer (Gross and McEntire), the group fights for survival against giant, prehistoric, worm-like monsters hungry for human flesh.\n\nReleased by [[Universal Pictures]], the film is the first installment of the [[Tremors (franchise)|''Tremors'' franchise]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE2DE1631F93AA25752C0A966958260 |title=Underground Creatures and Dread Events|author=Vincent Canby|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1990-01-19|author-link=Vincent Canby}}</ref> and was followed by five [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]]s and one [[prequel]]: ''[[Tremors 2: Aftershocks]]'' (1996), ''[[Tremors 3: Back to Perfection]]'' (2001), ''[[Tremors 4: The Legend Begins]]'' (2004), ''[[Tremors 5: Bloodlines]]'' (2015), ''[[Tremors: A Cold Day in Hell]]'' (2018), and ''[[Tremors: Shrieker Island]]'' (2020).

This is currently < 650 words long, and the guideline recommends a maximum of 700 words. -->\nValentine \"Val\" McKee and Earl Bassett are handymen working in Perfection, Nevada, an isolated settlement in the high desert east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains. They eventually get tired of their jobs and leave for Bixby, the nearest town. As they leave, they discover the dead body of another resident, Edgar Deems, perched atop an [[Electricity pylon|electrical tower]], still grasping the tower's crossbeams and his rifle. Jim Wallace, the town's doctor, determines that Edgar died of [[dehydration]], apparently having been too afraid to climb down.\n\nLater on, an unseen creature kills shepherd Fred and his flock of sheep. Val and Earl discover his severed head and believe that a serial killer is on the loose. Two construction workers ignore Val and Earl's warning and are killed by the same creature, causing a rock slide. Val and Earl try to find help after warning the residents, but find the phone lines are dead and that the rock slide has blocked the only road out of town. Out of sight, a snake-like creature wraps itself around their truck's rear axle, but is torn apart when Val stomps on the accelerator and drives away, and is discovered when they return to town.\n\nVal and Earl borrow horses to ride to Bixby for help. They come upon Wallace and his wife's buried [[station wagon]] near their trailer, but the couple is missing (having been killed the previous night). As they press on, an enormous burrowing worm-like monster suddenly erupts out of the ground, revealing the snake-like creature to be one of the worm's many tentacled \"tongues\". Thrown from their horses, the men flee with the monster in pursuit. The chase ends when the eyeless creature crashes through the concrete wall of an [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]], dying from the impact. Rhonda LeBeck, a graduate student conducting [[seismology]] tests in the area, stumbles onto the scene; she deduces from previous readings that three other worms are in the area. Rhonda, Val, and Earl become trapped overnight atop a cluster of boulders near one of the worms, and surmise that the creatures hunt their prey by detecting seismic vibrations. The trio then find some discarded poles and use them to [[pole vault]] over to nearby boulders, eventually reaching Rhonda's truck and escaping.\n\nAfter the three return to town, the worms attack and kill general store owner Walter Chang, forcing everyone to hide on the town's various rooftops. Meanwhile, [[survivalist]] couple Burt and Heather Gummer manage to kill one of the creatures after unwittingly luring it to their basement armory. In town, the two remaining worms attack the building foundations, knocking over a trailer belonging to Nestor before dragging him under and devouring him. Realizing they cannot stay in the town any longer, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel distract the monsters while Val commandeers a [[track loader]] and chains a [[semi-trailer]] to the rear; the survivors use it to try to escape to a nearby mountain range. En route, both worms create a sinkhole trap that disables the track loader, and the survivors flee to some nearby boulders for safety. Earl then has an idea to lure in the worms and trick them into swallowing Burt's homemade [[pipe bomb]]s. The strategy successfully kills one worm, but the last one spits a bomb back towards the survivors, forcing them to disperse as the explosion destroys all but one of the remaining bombs.\n\nVal lures the final worm into chasing him to the edge of a cliff and then explodes the remaining bomb behind it, frightening the worm into charging through the cliff face, where it plummets to its death onto the rocks below. The group returns to town, where they call in the authorities to begin an investigation while Earl encourages Val to pursue a romantic relationship with Rhonda.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, plus remaining four (so few), all roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Valentine \"Val\" McKee, a [[handyman]] and jack-of-all-trades who does odd jobs around town with his partner Earl to make money.\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Earl Bassett, Val's partner in the handyman business.

S. Wilson and Brent Maddock were working for the [[United States Navy]] as filmmakers in charge of creating educational safety videos. While getting footage, the two climbed a large desert boulder and asked the question \"What if there was something that wouldn't let us off of this rock?\" This inspired the two to start brainstorming ideas for a monster movie, which was eventually dubbed \"Land Sharks\".<ref>[https://youtube.com/m-HUUt21tRA?t=64]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref> They shared their idea to their friend [[Ron Underwood]], who was working with [[National Geographic]] as a documentary director, and used his knowledge of zoology to better develop the \"land sharks\" into creatures that could realistically exist.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAfter their script for ''[[Short Circuit (1986 film)|Short Circuit]]'' spawned a major box office hit, Wilson and Maddock quickly began shopping around their idea for ''Tremors''. The name \"Land Sharks\" was changed owing to a then-popular ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch featuring a character of the same name. The original screenplay, titled 'Beneath Perfection', was finished in June 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Tremors.html |title=Tremors Script |publisher=IMSDb}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in early 1989 and lasted over 50 days. [[Principal photography]] took place around [[Lone Pine, California]], and the isolated community of [[Darwin, California]], which the crew liked because of its similitaries to the fictional town of Perfection, Nevada. The town, which was entirely a set, was built near [[Olancha, California]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tremors filming locations |url=http://scabbyhorror.blogspot.com/2014/12/tremors-1990-filming-locations.html|date=December 2, 2014}}</ref> The mountains in the distance are the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and [[Owens Lake]] is visible in the background during the film's climax.<ref>{{cite interview |last1= Maddock |first1= Brent |last2=Wilson |first2=SS |interviewer= MJ Simpson |title=Exclusive Tremors Interview Part 3 |url=http://www.angelfire.com/movies/krccc/interview3.html |date= June 5, 2000 |access-date=January 4, 2014 |publisher=[[angelfire.com]] }}</ref>\n\n===Props===\nThe creature for ''Tremors'' was designed by [[Amalgamated Dynamics]]. The full-scale graboid seen after being dug up by Val was cast in lightweight foam. It was placed in a trench and buried and dug up again to achieve the desired \"used\" effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stampede-entertainment.com/site/photos/wppg_photo_details/?gallery_id=10&image_id=747|title=Tremors Full Scale Graboid On Set|work=stampede-entertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nBurt's elephant gun, an 8-gauge Darne shotgun, was rented from a private collector for use in the film.

However, the [[MPAA]] gave the film an R rating owing to language, and the creators decided at the last minute to make the film more commercially available. Over 20 or so uses of the word \"fuck\" were either cut or redubbed with softer words; examples include \"Can you fly, you sucker?\" and \"We killed that motherhumper\", among several others.<ref name=\"stampede-entertainment.com\">{{cite web|url=http://stampede-entertainment.com/site/fan-extras/tremors-faq/|title=Tremors FAQ |publisher=Stampede Entertainment}}</ref> The film was pushed back to allow more time for editing, and the film was eventually released in January 1990 with a PG-13 rating. Wilson and Maddock later stated they were very happy with the decision to make ''Tremors'' appeal to a more family-friendly audience rather than an adult-oriented audience.<ref name=\"stampede-entertainment.com\"/>\n\n==Release and reception==\n===Box office===\nTremors opened on January 19, 1990, in 1,457 theaters against no new releases and debuted at the #5 spot, behind ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'', ''[[Tango & Cash]]'', ''[[The War Of The Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'', and ''[[Internal Affairs (film)|Internal Affairs]]'', grossing $3,731,520 in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tremors opening weekend stats |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1990&wknd=03&p=.htm |website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> It dropped to #6 on its second week but would stay in the top 10 for four weeks before finally dropping to #11 in week 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1990&wknd=06&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for February 9-11, 1990 - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> Tremors had a budget of $10 million and ended up grossing $16,667,084 at the domestic box office, which made it financially successful, though far below projected numbers.
