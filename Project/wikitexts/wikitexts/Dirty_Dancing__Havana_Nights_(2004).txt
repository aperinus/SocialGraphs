The film is an unrelated [[prequel]]/\"re-imagining\" of the 1987 [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', reusing the same basic plot, but transplanting it from upstate New York to Cuba on the cusp of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. [[Patrick Swayze]], star of the original ''Dirty Dancing'', appears as a dance instructor. It was mostly filmed in [[Old San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1958, Katey Miller ([[Romola Garai]]), her parents ([[Sela Ward]] and [[John Slattery]]), and her younger sister Susie ([[Mika Boorem]]) arrive in Cuba during the [[Cuban revolution]]. A self-described bookworm, Katey is not very happy about having to move to a different country during her senior year of high school, as she had been planning to attend [[Radcliffe College]], although the rest of her family seem extremely pleased to be in Cuba.\n\nMeeting several other rich American teenagers down by the pool - including James Phelps ([[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]]), the son of her father's boss - Katey becomes disgusted when one of the teenagers insults a local waiter when he drops their drinks because Katey accidentally bumped into him. Katey attempts to talk to the waiter\u2014Javier ([[Diego Luna]]), who works at the hotel to support his family\u2014because she feels awful about what had occurred, but he is not interested.\n\nKatey watches a film of her mother and father dancing and wishes she could dance as well as they did. She and her father dance a bit. The next day in class, Katey is asked to read aloud from the [[Odyssey]] - a passage about love and passion. After class, James invites her to a party at the country club the next day and she accepts.\n\nWhile walking home from school, she sees Javier dancing to street music, and he offers to walk her home. They stop to listen to a street band and police show up, stopping Javier while Katey runs away.\n\nThe next day, Katey tries some of the dance moves she saw. Javier sees her and asks her to come see the real dancers Saturday night, but she says she is already going to the country club. Javier gets upset and leaves. Katey wears one of her maid's dresses to the country club party and impresses James. Katey convinces him to take her to the Cuban nightclub ''La Rosa Negra'' (The Black Rose) where Javier is dancing with the ladies.\n\nJavier dances with Katey while James sits at the bar. Soon he is accosted by Javier's brother, Carlos, who tells him that they will eventually kick the Americans out of Cuba. Javier comes over and argues with his brother. James takes Katey back to the car and assaults her after she refuses to kiss him. She slaps him and runs into the club, and Javier agrees to walk her home.\n\nThe next day, Katey walks by a dance class. The teacher ([[Patrick Swayze]]) asks if anyone wants to enter the big dance contest and then dances with Katey for a bit. She grabs a flyer for the competition.\n\nWhile walking to the pool, James apologizes to Katey and then tells her that Susie saw Javier with her and got him fired. Katey argues with Susie and goes to find Javier. He is now working at a [[chop shop]] with Carlos. She asks him to enter the dance contest with her, but he refuses. Meanwhile, it is becoming apparent that Carlos is helping the revolutionaries.\n\nThe next day, Javier shows up at Katey's school and agrees to enter the dance contest with her. They start teaching each other dance moves and Javier convinces her to \"feel the music.\" They practice all the time, and Katey dances some more with the dance teacher, until it is the night of the dance. Katey and Javier dance with the other couples on the floor and are chosen to go on to the next round.\n\nKatey's parents disapprove of her relationship with Javier, but Katey reconciles with them. On the night of the contest's final round, while Katey and Javier are on the dance floor, Javier sees his brother and some revolutionaries disguised as waiters, and the police soon try to arrest them. The contest stops as everyone flees the club, and Javier has to save Carlos from the police. Javier and Carlos talk about how they miss their dad, then they hear that [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] has fled the country and join the celebration.\n\nLater, Javier comes to the hotel and finds Katey. He takes her to the beach and they have sex. The next day, Katey's parents tell her they are leaving Cuba and she has one last night with Javier. They go to the Cuban club where they first danced, and the floor is theirs as they are dubbed King and Queen. Katey's family is there to see her, and Katey narrates that she doesn't know when she will see Javier again, but this will not be their last time to dance together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Romola Garai]] as Katey Miller\n* [[Diego Luna]] as Javier Suarez\n* [[Sela Ward]] as Jeannie Miller\n* [[John Slattery]] as Bert Miller\n* [[Mika Boorem]] as Susie Miller\n* [[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]] as James Phelps\n* [[Rene Lavan]] as Carlos Suarez\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Dance Class Instructor\n* [[January Jones]] as Eve\n* [[M\u00fda Harrison]] as Lola Martinez\n* [[Ang\u00e9lica Arag\u00f3n]] as Mrs. Suarez\n\n==Production==\n''Havana Nights'' is based on an original screenplay by playwright and [[NPR]] host [[Peter Sagal]], based on the real life experience of producer JoAnn Jansen, who lived in Cuba as a 15-year-old in 1958\u201359. Sagal wrote the screenplay, which he titled ''Cuba Mine'', about a young American woman who witnessed the [[Cuban revolution]] and had a romance with a young Cuban revolutionary. The screenplay was to be a serious political romance story, documenting, among other stories, how the Cuban revolution transformed from idealism to terror. It was commissioned in 1992 by [[Lawrence Bender]], who was rising to fame with his production of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' and ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. The screenplay was bought by a film studio, which requested several rewrites before deciding not to produce the film. A decade later, Bender decided to make a ''Dirty Dancing'' [[sequel]], and the film was very loosely adapted from Sagal's script. Not a single line from Sagal's original screenplay appears in the final film and Sagal says that the only remnants of the political theme that existed in his script is a scene wherein some people are executed.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[This American Life]] |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=383 |title=Radio episode #383|date=June 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Natalie Portman]] was offered the role of Katey Miller but she turned it down.<ref name=\"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/dirty-dancing-havana-nights-1200534782/|title=Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights|work=Variety|date=February 27, 2004}}</ref> [[Ricky Martin]] was also considered for the role of Javier Suarez.<ref name=\"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\"/> The film was British actress [[Romola Garai]]'s first Hollywood film and she repeatedly has cited the filming of the movie as being an extremely negative experience which caused her to re-evaluate working in Hollywood.

Wesley Morris of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' awarded it 2 out of 4 stars, saying: \"As you might expect, the movie is as square as a sock hop.\" Philip Martin of the ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'', who rated it B\u2212, because \"aside from the triteness of the dialogue, the mathematical predictability of the script and the muddling of numbskulled politics, DD: HN is a fairly enjoyable experience.\" According to Louis Hobson of Jam! Magazine, who thought the movie was worth 3.5 out of 5 stars, the main redeeming factor was the choreography: \"You may have problems with the obvious, clich\u00e9d story, but the dancing is incredible.\" Philip Wuntch of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' gave the film a C, stating that \"both the dance numbers and the personal drama are largely listless.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|havana_nights|Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = February 17, 2004\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Pop music|Pop]] / [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[J Records]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n# \"Dance Like This\" \u2013 [[Wyclef Jean]] featuring [[Claudette Ortiz]]\t\n# \"Dirty Dancing\" \u2013 [[The Black Eyed Peas]]\n# \"Guajira (I Love U 2 Much)\" \u2013 [[Yerba Buena (band)|Yerba Buena]]\n# \"Can I Walk By\" \u2013 [[Jazze Pha|Phalon Alexander]] featuring [[Monica (entertainer)|Monica Arnold]]\n# \"Satellite (From \"Havana Nights\")\" \u2013 [[Santana (band)|Santana]] featuring [[Jorge Moreno]]\n# \"El Beso Del Final\" \u2013 [[Christina Aguilera]]\n# \"Represent, Cuba\" \u2013 [[Orishas (band)|Orishas]] featuring [[Heather Headley]]\n# \"Do You Only Wanna Dance\" \u2013 [[M\u00fda Harrison]]\n# \"You Send Me\" \u2013 Shawn Kane\n# \"El Estuche\" \u2013 [[Aterciopelados]]\n# \"Do You Only Wanna Dance\" \u2013 Julio Daivel Big Band (conducted by Cucco Pe\u00f1a)\n# \"Satellite (Spanish Version) Nave Espacial (From \"Havana Nights\")\" \u2013 Santana featuring Jorge Moreno\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0338096|Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights}}\n* {{tcmdb title|451474|Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights}}\n* {{mojo title|dirtydancing2|Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|havana_nights|Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights}}\n\n{{Dirty Dancing}}\n{{Guy Ferland}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights}}\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2000s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s dance films]]\n[[Category:2004 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s romantic musical films]]\n[[Category:2000s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s teen romance films]]\n[[Category:A Band Apart films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:American dance films]]\n[[Category:American musical drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic musical films]]\n[[Category:American teen drama films]]\n[[Category:American teen musical films]]\n[[Category:American teen romance films]]\n[[Category:Artisan Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Coming-of-age romance films]]\n[[Category:Dirty Dancing films]]\n[[Category:Films about interracial romance]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Guy Ferland]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Lawrence Bender]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Heitor Pereira]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1958]]\n[[Category:Films set in Havana]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Boaz Yakin]]\n[[Category:Miramax films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:American prequel films]]"}]}}}}
