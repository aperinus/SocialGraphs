It stars [[Chris Sarandon]], [[William Ragsdale]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Amanda Bearse]], [[Jonathan Stark (actor)|Jonathan Stark]], Dorothy Fielding, [[Stephen Geoffreys]], and [[Art Evans (actor)|Art Evans]]. The film follows young Charley Brewster, who discovers that his next-door neighbor Jerry Dandrige is a [[vampire]]. When no one believes him, Charley decides to get Peter Vincent, a TV show host who acted in films as a vampire hunter, to stop Jerry's killing spree.\n\nThe film was released on August 2, 1985, and grossed $24.9 million at the [[box office]]. Since its release, it has received positive reviews from critics and has become a [[Cult film|cult classic]]. ''Fright Night'' was followed by a sequel, ''[[Fright Night Part 2]]'', in 1988, and [[Fright Night (2011 film)|a remake in 2011]], which was in turn followed by ''[[Fright Night 2: New Blood]]'' in 2013. In October 2020, Tom Holland confirmed that he was writing a direct sequel to the original film titled ''Fright Night: Resurrection'' that would bring back characters from the original film and would ignore the 1988 sequel.\n\n==Plot==\nSeventeen-year-old Charley Brewster is a fan of a horror television program called ''Fright Night'', hosted by former movie vampire hunter Peter Vincent. One evening, Charley discovers that his new next-door neighbor [[Jerry Dandrige]] is a vampire responsible for the disappearances of several victims. After telling his mother, Charley asks his girlfriend, Amy Peterson, and his friend, \"Evil Ed\" Thompson, for help before contacting the authorities. Detective Lennox goes with Charley to Jerry's house to question him, but his \"roommate\" Billy Cole tells them that Jerry is \"away on business\". Charley reveals his suspicions about Jerry's vampirism, and Lennox leaves, furious. That night, Charley is shocked to see Jerry inside his house, having been invited in by Charley's mother. Later, Jerry visits Charley and offers him a choice: ignore his vampiric activities, or else. Charley refuses, brandishing a crucifix at Jerry. When Jerry tries to push him out the window to his death, Charley stabs Jerry's hand with a pencil. Jerry destroys Charley's car in retaliation and threatens Charley over the telephone.\n\nCharley turns to Peter Vincent for help, but Peter dismisses Charley as an obsessed fan. Amy, fearing for Charley's sanity and safety, hires the destitute Peter to \"prove\" that Jerry is not a vampire by having him drink what they claim is \"[[holy water]]\", but it is only tap water; Jerry has claimed to Peter that drinking actual holy water would be against his religious convictions. Peter discovers Charley is right about Jerry's true nature after glancing at his pocket mirror and noticing Jerry's lack of a reflection, causing him to accidentally drop the mirror; Peter then flees, but Jerry learns of his discovery after finding a shard of mirrored glass on the floor.\n\nJerry hunts down Ed and turns him into a vampire, then Ed proceeds to visit Peter and tries to attack him, only to be warded off when burned by a crucifix to the forehead. Meanwhile, Jerry chases Charley and Amy into a nightclub. While Charley tries to call the police, Jerry hypnotizes and abducts Amy, who resembles Jerry's lost love, and bites her. With nowhere left to turn, Charley attempts to gain Peter's help once more. A frightened Peter initially refuses, but then reluctantly resumes his \"vampire killer\" role. Entering Jerry's house, the two are able to repel Jerry using a crucifix, though only Charley's works since he has faith in its spiritual power. Billy appears and knocks Charley over the banister, while Peter flees to Charley's house. There, he is surprised by Ed, who attacks him in the form of a wolf, only to be pierced through the heart with a broken table leg held by Peter. Removing the stake from Ed's body, Peter goes to rescue Charley and battle Jerry.\n\nCharley is locked in with Amy, who is slowly transforming into a vampire. Peter frees him before she awakens, and says the process can be reversed if they destroy Jerry before dawn. Billy confronts Charley and Peter, and is revealed to be undead. They destroy Billy, who melts into goo and sand. Peter is able to lure the overconfident Jerry in front of a window using a crucifix, which now works due to his renewed faith in its abilities. As the sun rises, Jerry transforms into a bat and attacks Peter and Charley before fleeing to his coffin in the basement. Charley and Peter pursue Jerry; the latter breaks open Jerry's coffin and tries to stake him through the heart while Charley fights off Amy, who has almost completed her transformation. By breaking the blacked-out windows in the basement, Peter and Charley expose Jerry to the sunlight, destroying him and returning Amy to her human form.\n\nA few nights later, Peter returns to his ''Fright Night'' TV series and announces a hiatus from vampires, presenting a film about [[alien invader]]s instead. Charley and Amy watch the program as they embrace in bed. Charley gets up to turn off the TV and glimpses red eyes in Jerry's now-vacant house, but dismisses them. Unbeknownst to both Charley and Amy, a new neighbor has just moved in.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Sarandon]] as [[Jerry Dandrige]]<ref name=\"script\">{{cite web|title=Fright Night (1985) Script|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/157635650/Fright-Night-1985-Script|publisher=ScribD|author=Tom Holland}}</ref> \n* [[William Ragsdale]] as Charley Brewster\n* [[Amanda Bearse]] as Amy Peterson\n* [[Stephen Geoffreys]] as Edward \"Evil Ed\" Thompson\n* [[Jonathan Stark (actor)|Jonathan Stark]] as Billy Cole\n* Dorothy Fielding as Judy Brewster\n* [[Art Evans (actor)|Art J.

figuring that ''Fright Night'' would be as successful as it ultimately became.\n\n===Casting===\nThe Peter Vincent character was named after horror icons [[Peter Cushing]] and Vincent Price, and Holland specifically wrote the part for Price,<ref name=\"TimSullivan\"/><ref name=\"Pirate\"/> but at this point in his career, Price had been so badly typecast that he had stopped accepting roles in horror movies.<ref>{{cite video | title = Vincent Price: The Sinister Image | publisher=[[Image Entertainment]] | date=1987}}</ref> Guy McElwaine, then the head of Columbia Pictures, suggested [[Roddy

McDowall had already starred in the Holland-penned film ''Class of 1984'', so Holland was immediately receptive to the suggestion. \"He understood the part\", commented Holland, \"and he also understood what he could do with it, and he ''really'' wanted it!\"<ref name=\"DreadCentral1\"/> McDowall was particularly interested in the genesis of the character. \"In the film, I perform as being in my late 20s or early 30s in the film clips of my old movies-all the way up to my 60s, when I'm the washed-up has-been\", McDowall adding that the role interested him because, \"I'd never played anything that old.\"<ref name=\"Monsterland\">{{cite journal| author = Paul Davids| date = October 1985| title = There Are Vampires Lurking in the Shadows Waiting for Roddy McDowall in Fright Night|

Holland to a dinner party where he introduced him to Vincent Price, who was flattered that the part was an homage to him and commented that the film \"was wonderful and he thought Roddy did a wonderful job.\"<ref name=\"TimSullivan\"/>\n\nChris Sarandon's agent gave him a copy of the script and he replied, \"there's no way I can do a horror movie,\"<ref name=\"DallasPanel\"/> but he decided to give the script a once-over and was immediately captivated by it. \"I thought this is one of the best scripts I've read in a long time\", Sarandon said, \"beautifully constructed, it was obvious that this was a labor of love, it was clear that the writer/director's approach to it was one of wanting to have fun with the genre without ''making fun'' of it, the characters were beautifully drawn.\"<ref name=\"Pirate\"/> Sarandon was worried about being typecast as a villain, but the script resonated with him because the story was deeper than just an average monster movie. \"Forgetting about vampirism, what this film is about on one level is an older man trying to take a younger man's girl away from him\", commented Holland.<ref name=\"Holland\">{{cite web|title=Tom Holland bio \u2013 Fright Night press kit |url=http://geocities.com/michel_and/TomHolland-bio.html |url-status=dead

leery of working with a first-time director, so he flew to Los Angeles to meet Tom Holland and producer [[Herb Jaffe]]. Holland and he had an immediate rapport (and went on to make several more films together), and Sarandon was awed that Holland had the film so completely mapped out that he \"literally described the movie shot-by-shot all the way through \u2013 page-by-page, scene-by-scene. It was basically the way he shot it.\"<ref name=\"Pirate\"/>\n\nJonathan Stark was not a fan of vampire films, but he also liked the script. The Billy Cole character was written as a hulking giant, so Stark padded himself with extra clothing when he went in to audition.<ref name=\"Pirate\"/> At auditions, he read the scene in which he is being questioned by the detective, which was written to be played straight. \"I'm thinking if I'm sitting there being evil\", Stark commented, \"the lieutenant's gonna get suspicious. Why not throw him off the trail by being funny?\"<ref name=\"Pirate\"/> Holland liked his take on the character, and Stark was told that he had the part \u2013 but because he came in to read at the start of the audition process, months passed before filming commenced and Stark worried that he had lost the role.<ref name=\"2008panel\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0aD176KcZE|title='Fright Night' Actors and Director Discuss Making The Film|publisher=youtube.com |date=September 22, 2008 |access-date=September 13, 2014}}</ref> The gap worked to his advantage, however, because it gave him time to hit the gym and bulk up so he would not have to wear padding in the film.<ref name=\"Pirate\"/>\n\nWilliam Ragsdale had auditioned to portray [[Roy L.

Casting director Jackie Burch remembered his audition though, and thought he would be right to portray Charley Brewster. Ragsdale auditioned several times and ultimately received the news that he had landed the part on Halloween night 1984,<ref name=\"imdb\"/><ref name=\"2008panel\"/> beating out several other future-stars like [[Charlie Sheen]].<ref name=\"ProjectionBooth\">{{cite web|url=http://projection-booth.blogspot.com/2011/08/special-report-3-fright-night-1985.html|title=The Projection Booth Special Report: Fright Night (1985)|publisher=Projection Booth|date=2011-08-18|access-date=2014-09-13}}</ref>\n\nDue to a mix-up, Stephen Geoffreys had an awkward audition for [[Anthony Michael Hall]]'s role in ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'',<ref name=\"DallasPanel\"/> and he made an indelible impression on Jackie Burch, who suggested him for ''Fright Night''. Although he was not a horror-movie fan, Geoffreys loved the script, so he called his agent and emphatically declared that he would love to audition for Charley Brewster. \"No, Steve\", his agent replied, \"you're wanted for the part of Evil Ed.\"<ref name=\"DallasPanel\"/> Geoffreys was simultaneously baffled and heartbroken. \"What do they see in me that they think I should be this... well anyway, it worked out.\"<ref name=\"DallasPanel\"/>\n\nThe most difficult role to cast was Amy Peterson. \"There wasn't the perfect [[girl next door]] until Amanda Bearse walked in\", Holland commented.<ref name=\"DreadCentral1\"/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nOnce his cast was in place, Holland got input from each of the actors and made numerous revisions to the script. Some were slight and others were major \u2013 such as the ending, which originally featured Peter Vincent transforming into a vampire as he returned to host ''Fright Night''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://s284.photobucket.com/user/BDRecords/media/FrightNightalternateending.jpg.html|title=Fright Night (1985) Original Ending \u2013 Script Excerpt|publisher=photobucket.com |access-date=September 13, 2014}}</ref> The September 6, 1984, draft of the screenplay, which is circulating online,<ref name=\"script\"/> is very close to the final cut of the film, but a few more changes were still to come.\n\nThe cast and crew were given the luxury of having two weeks of rehearsal time in late November 1984 prior to filming.<ref name=\"Pirate\"/> Holland blocked out the scenes on a soundstage and the cast performed the entire film like it was a stage play. Having begun his career as a classically trained actor,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yzcsr7DHrY|title=Choice Cuts: Tom Holland Interview pt. 2 (3/24/11)|publisher=youtube.com |date=2011-03-24|access-date=2014-09-13}}</ref> Holland encouraged the cast to write biographies of their characters so they would completely understand their motivations and be able to draw on that information while filming their scenes.<ref name=\"Pirate\"/><ref name=\"DaysoftheDead\"/> All of the kinks in the story/performances were ironed out during the rehearsal period, so when time to film came, Holland only shot two or three takes of each scene and then moved on.<ref name=\"DreadCentral1\"/><ref name=\"Pirate\"/>\n\nAs originally written, Jerry Dandrige was more villainous, so Sarandon tried to find various ways to humanize the vampire,<ref name=\"Pirate\"/> including suggesting the implication that the Amy character was the reincarnation of his long-lost love. \"I wanted to give the audience something to hold onto in terms of understanding that this was someone who was at one time--and still is, in certain respects--a thinking, feeling human being\", Sarandon said.<ref name=\"Sarandon\">{{cite web|title=Chrs Sarandon bio \u2013 Fright Night press kit |url=http://geocities.com/michel_and/ChrisSarandon-bio.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820015716/http://geocities.com/michel_and/ChrisSarandon-bio.html |archive-date=August 20, 2009 }}</ref> \"This is a man who has been hunted for all his post-human existence, but who has fallen in love a number of times, and who in a sense, longs for a normal existence.\" Sarandon also did research into bats and discovered that most of the world's bat populations are [[frugivore]]s, so he concluded, \"Jerry had a lot of fruit bat in his DNA.\"<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG7j5FNevsg|title=Fright Night \u2013 Panel Discussion With Actors And Crew Members At Monsterpalooza 2012!|publisher=youtube.com |date=2012-05-20|access-date=2014-09-13}}</ref> This explains why his character is frequently munching on apples, which Sarandon decided his character was using to \"cleanse his palate\"<ref name=\"Pirate\"/> after draining blood from his victims.\n\nStark and Sarandon had not picked up on Holland's intended [[gay]] subtext when they were developing their characters. \"I didn't have any sense of it as being anything other than [[Renfield]] and [[Dracula]]\", Chris Sarandon recalled. \"I think there was sort of an asexual quality to the relationship that was sort of borderline homoerotic but ''not'' in the sense that it was creepy.\"<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/> For the scene in which Jerry pulls down the window shade and it looks as though Billy is about to perform [[oral sex]] on him, Stark remembered, \"I'm cleaning his hand and [Tom Holland] said, 'No, get down on your knees.' 'Okay, Tom.' Then when I saw [the film], I thought, 'Oooooh, okay.'\"<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/>\n\nMcDowall also did a lot of work on his character, and made a conscious decision to pattern his performance after the [[Cowardly Lion]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref name=\"TimSullivan\"/><ref name=\"DreadCentral1\"/><ref name=\"Pirate\"/><ref name=\"Monsterland\"/> \"My part is that of an old ham actor, I mean a ''dreadful'' actor. He realizes it but doesn't admit it. He had a moderate success in an isolated film here and there, but all very bad product. This poor sonofabitch just played the same character all the time, which was awful. And then he disappeared from sight, 15 years beforehand. He's been peddling these movies to late night TV, various syndicated markets \u2013 he'd go six months in Iowa, six months in Podunk.\"<ref name=\"Monsterland\"/> McDowall commented to Fangoria, \"He's got such a sad life, he's sort of cowardly and then he finds his strength as a human being.\"<ref name=\"FangoriaOnSet\">{{cite journal| author = Abbie Bernstein| date = August 1985| title = On the Set: Fright Night| journal= Fangoria| publisher = O'Quinn Studios, Inc.| issue = 47| pages = 32\u201335}}</ref> Despite the pathetic character he was portraying, McDowall was a pillar for the cast and crew. \"He was a kind of [[Yoda]] on the set\", commented Sarandon. Recalled Ragsdale, \"He had his videocamera on his shoulder and he was shooting, like, family movies the whole time.\"<ref name=\"2008panel\"/>\n\nSarandon recalled that Holland collaborated with [[choreographer]] Dorain Grusman in shooting a disco dance scene to have Bearse's character physically changing so that \"she goes from this rather dewey, innocent-looking girl to this ''[[femme fatale]]''; she kind of grows up right before your eyes.\"<ref>''Chris Sarandon Interview with Mr. Beak'' ''Ain't It Cool News'' Sept. 19, 2008</ref> The scene also established Amy discovering Jerry actually was a vampire.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] commenced on December 3, 1984, and wrapped on February 23, 1985. At the time of production, ''Fright Night'' was Columbia's lowest-budgeted film and they did not have high expectations for it, so they were focusing all of their attention on the [[John Travolta]]/[[Jamie Lee Curtis]] film ''[[Perfect (1985 film)|Perfect]]'', which they were certain was going to be a blockbuster.<ref name=\"TimSullivan\"/><ref name=\"Pirate\"/><ref name=\"DallasPanel\"/> \"They never even came to the set\", Holland said. \"I was left alone. It was totally my film without studio interference.\"<ref name=\"TimSullivan\"/>\n\nGenerally, filming went off without a hitch, but a few mishaps did occur, including an incident in which Ragsdale broke his ankle while running down a staircase. The schedule had to be reorganized, but filming continued. \"Nobody panicked. In fact, I think that the thing I'll remember most about this movie is everyone's spirit and humor.\"<ref name=\"Ragsale\"/> The cast and crew seemed to meld with a singular vision of making the best movie possible. Early in production, Holland invited ''[[Fangoria]]'' writer Abbie Bernstein to visit the set as often as she liked, and she took him up on his offer. Of the wrap party in March, Bernstein wrote, \"It's fun and pleasant, but it lacks the intense camaraderie of the set.\"<ref name=\"FangoriaOnSet\"/>\n\n===Make-up and visual effects===\n[[Richard Edlund]] was the head of visual effects, and his team had just completed work on ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', which worked to the advantage of ''Fright Night''. \"They had made all of their mistakes with how to do the matte shots and everything on ''Ghostbusters'', with their huge budget\", Holland commented, \"so they really knew how to do [the special effects] as inexpensively and efficiently as it could be done at the time.\"<ref name=\"DreadCentral3\">{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/26462/fright-night-retrospective-part-three-crafting-the-ultimate-80s-creature-feature-with-tom-holland/|title=Fright Night Retrospective Part Three: Crafting the Ultimate 80s Creature Feature with Tom Holland |date=August 23, 2011 |access-date=September 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe most excruciating part of the makeup process for the cast was the contact lenses. In those days, the lenses were hard plastic, which [[Steve Johnson (special effects artist)|Steve Johnson]] hand-painted (throwing some glitter into the mix), lacquered, and sanded.<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/> The cast could only wear them for a maximum of 20 minutes because they were virtually blind in them, and they were thick and painful, and dried out their eyes. A set was made for Stark to wear when he was in his final pursuit of Peter and Charley, but he kept tripping on the stairs. Holland told him to take one out, and he was then able to perform the scene.<ref name=\"Pirate\"/><ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/> Three sets were made for [[Amanda Bearse]], but one of them caused her agonizing pain, which she initially tried to endure. When it finally became too much to bear, she took the contacts out and the crew realized they had forgotten to buff them.<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/> For the scene in Mrs. Brewster's bedroom, Geoffreys kept his contacts in for nearly 40 minutes, resulting in scratches on his eyeballs for months afterward.<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/>\n\nFor the transformation sequences, up to 8 hours were needed to prepare Sarandon's makeup.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> Sarandon was uncomfortable spending that long sitting in a chair doing nothing, and since he had experience doing his own makeup for his work on the stage, he volunteered to help. He did some of the stippling, and while the makeup men were applying prosthetics to his face and head, he worked on the finger extensions.<ref name=\"Pirate\"/><ref name=\"DaysoftheDead\"/> Sarandon has often joked that the rubber fingers caused difficulties whenever he had to urinate, so costume supervisor Mort Schwartz constantly offered to help him.<ref name=\"Pirate\"/><ref name=\"DaysoftheDead\"/> \"I said to Morry, 'Thank you, no, I'll just use a coat hanger!'\"<ref name=\"DaysoftheDead\"/> Co-star Ragsdale recalled one instance when Sarandon spent an entire day in the makeup chair, and when he was finally fully transformed into the monster, a producer informed him that they were not going to be able to shoot the scene that day. \"And Chris said, 'Okay,' and turned around and went and took it off, it was amazing!\" Ragsdale exclaimed. \"I would have gone through the roof, but he didn't. His will had been broken by that point!\"<ref name=\"DaysoftheDead\"/>\n\nThe makeup for Evil Ed's wolf transformation took 18 hours.<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/> While he had the wolf head on, the crew began pouring what they thought was [[methylcellulose]] into his mouth to create the illusion of saliva, but when Geoffreys began to complain about the taste, Mark Bryan Wilson realized they had been using prosthetic adhesive, which was gluing his mouth shut.<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/>\n\nOn Christmas Eve, during the shooting of a scene where he is running down a staircase, Ragsdale accidentally tripped and broke his ankle, resulting in the film being temporarily put on a hold until he could recover. \"Rod Martin, a trainer for the [[Los Angeles Raiders]], came in every day to wrap the foot for me, and the shooting schedule was rearranged to put off the action sequences until it mended.\" said Ragsdale.<ref name=\"Ragsale\">{{cite web|title=William Ragsdale bio \u2013 Fright Night press kit |url=http://geocities.com/michel_and/WilliamRagsdale-bio.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022113623/http://geocities.com/michel_and/WilliamRagsdale-bio.html |archive-date=October 22, 2009 }}</ref> Many scenes were shot with his foot in a cast, including the scene in which Jerry comes to Charley's room to attack him. For shots in which Charley's feet were visible, the costumers slit Ragsdale's shoes in several places, slipped them on and then covered the portions of white cast that peeked through the slits with black cloth.<ref name=\"FangoriaOnSet\"/> For the scene in which Jerry is carrying Charley by the throat with one hand, Sarandon was simultaneously pushing Ragsdale along on a furniture dolly.<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/>\n\nThe shot of Jerry pulling the pencil out of his hand was achieved by having a spring-loaded, collapsible pencil glued to his palm and an eraser-tip loosely attached to the back of his hand. When he turns his hand and pulls the spring-loaded piece from his palm, out of shot a monofilament wire jerked away the tip, so when he turns it back, it appears as though he has pulled it straight through his hand. \"So we go to the editing room\", FX man Steve Johnson recalled of an early cut, \"and Tom had put a reaction in the middle of it, ''ruined'' the entire shot!\"<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/>\n\nThe crew attempted to achieve the illusion of the cross-scar vanishing from Evil Ed's forehead live on-set, but the effect was a resounding failure. In that predigital age, Edlund's crew was able to alter the film using [[Optics#Photography|optical photography]] to achieve the effect.<ref name=\"Monsterpalooza\"/>\n\nFilming of the sequence with the bat was difficult for effects veteran Randall Cook, who kept winding up on film while puppeteering the creature. Further complications ensued when the bat tries to bite Roddy McDowall's character and he forces a bone into its mouth; getting the puppet to bite was difficult, and then McDowall jerked the bone too hard and broke the bat's skull.<ref name=\"FangoriaOnSet\"/> The bat was quickly patched, but the required repairs forced them to wait two days to shoot more close-ups.<ref name=\"FangoriaOnSet\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Fright Night\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = 1985\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Rock music|Rock]], [[New wave music|new wave]]\n| length     = 37:12\n| label      = [[Columbia Records|Private I]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe original 10-track soundtrack album was released on [[LP record|LP]] and [[Cassette tape|cassette]] in 1985 by [[Columbia Records|Private-I Records]].

The script, penned by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' alumna [[Marti Noxon]], loosely followed the plot of the original film. Charley ([[Anton Yelchin]]) and his mother ([[Toni Collette]]) are transplanted from Corvalis, Iowa, to a [[Las Vegas]] suburb; Amy ([[Imogen Poots]]) is feistier and sexually aggressive; Evil Ed ([[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]]) has endured a falling out with Charley prior to the start of the film; Peter Vincent ([[David Tennant]]) is a horror magician modeled after [[Criss Angel]]; the Billy Cole character was omitted; and Jerry Dandrige ([[Colin Farrell]]) is no longer the lovelorn vampire. He was described by Evil Ed as \"the fucking shark from ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''\" and has different intentions for his victims.\n\nSarandon was offered a role in the 2011 remake and chose to pass on the torch by doing a cameo as a man who is eaten by Jerry Dandrige.

Bearse commented, \"as a stand-alone horror movie, it was very well done. It didn't lessen the appeal of the original. It was just more of a one-note film.\"<ref name=\"DaysoftheDead\"/> Geoffreys only watched the first 20 minutes and then turned it off. Stark and Ragsdale went to a screening and discovered they \"were the only two people\" in attendance.<ref name=\"DaysoftheDead\"/> Ragsdale liked an early draft of the screenplay, but he was not particularly enamored with the final result and was perplexed that \"there was kind of a nastiness to\" the Evil Ed character.<ref name=\"DaysoftheDead\"/> The discussion dragged on for so long that the audience roared with laughter when Sarandon sarcastically interrupted Ragsdale to declare, \"I'm sure there are some other questions about ''the original'' ''Fright Night''.\"<ref name=\"DaysoftheDead\"/>\n\nWhen asked his thoughts in 2015, creator Tom Holland replied, \"Kudos to them on every level for their professionalism, but they forgot the humor and the heart. They should have called it something other than ''Fright Night'', because it had no more than a passing resemblance to the original. What they did to Jerry Dandrige and Peter Vincent was criminal.\" Smiling, he added, \"Outside of that, it was wonderful.\"<ref>[http://www.theblood-shed.com/exclusive-tom-holland-reflects-on-30-years-of-fright-night/ The Bloodshed Exclusive: Tom Holland Reflects on 30 Years of Fright Night]</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Comic books===\nBetween 1988 and 1993, [[NOW Comics]] published 27 [[Fright Night (comic line)|''Fright Night'' comic books]].
