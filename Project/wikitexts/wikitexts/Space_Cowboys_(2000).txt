It stars Eastwood, [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Donald Sutherland]], and [[James Garner]] as four older \"ex-test pilots\" who are sent into space to repair an old [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] satellite.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1958, two [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] pilots and aspiring astronauts William \"Hawk\" Hawkins and Frank Corvin are testing a modified [[Bell X-2]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.impdb.org/index.php?title=Space_Cowboys#Bell_X-2|title=Space Cowboys - the Internet Movie Plane Database}}</ref> when Hawk decides to break a height record.  The plane stalls and they are forced to eject, narrowly missing a [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress]] flying with navigator \"Tank\" Sullivan. On the ground, Frank punches Hawk, but their fight is broken up by flight engineer Jerry O'Neill. Their boss, Bob Gerson chastises Hawk before taking them to a press conference, where he announces that the newly created [[NASA]], rather than the USAF, will be conducting space flight tests.\n\nIn the present day, NASA is tasked to prevent a Soviet communications satellite, IKON, from decaying out of orbit and crashing to Earth. The satellite's archaic electronics are based on those of [[Skylab]] that Frank had developed. Bob, now a project manager at NASA, requests Frank's help. Frank still despises Bob, but agrees provided he has the help of \"Team Daedalus\" including Hawk, Tank, and Jerry. Bob plans to have younger astronauts shadow the four, so as to replace them before launch. When the press learn of Frank's team, the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] convinces Bob that they must be part of the mission for publicity. The old and young teams soon work together, with the older astronauts showing off skills learned without the aid of a computer.\n\nThe [[Space Shuttle]] ''Daedalus'' finds the satellite. It is not a communication satellite but in fact houses six nuclear missiles, relics from the [[Cold War]] and a violation of the [[Outer Space Treaty]]. Frank discovers that the satellite control system was stolen from Bob's files by the [[KGB]], and that the satellite's computers will launch the missiles at predetermined targets if it falls out of orbit. NASA and the crew plan to use the payload-assist rockets to push the satellite into deep space. However, one of the younger astronauts, Ethan Glance, acting under Bob's original orders, tries to put the satellite into stable orbit himself. He sets off a chain reaction: the satellite collides with the shuttle, damaging most of the shuttle's computer systems and engines, destroying the solar panels on the satellite, and sending it into a faster decaying orbit, while Ethan is knocked out and dragged along with the satellite.\n\nWhile Tank and Jerry tend to the other young astronaut Roger Hines, who suffered a concussion on the impact, Frank and Hawk space walk to the satellite in time to activate a booster rocket and slow the orbit's decay. As they see to Ethan, they realize that the only option is to have someone ride on the satellite as they fire the missiles' engines so that it escapes into deep space. Hawk, who was recently widowed and who has eight months to live from [[pancreatic cancer]], sacrifices himself, hoping that he will be able to land on the Moon to fulfill his life's dream.\n\nFrank, Tank, and Jerry now plan to bring the shuttle down over water since landing it would be difficult, but the shuttle comes in too fast. After safely bailing out Ethan and Roger, Tank and Jerry stay with Frank regardless of the risk. Frank recalls a maneuver Hawk had used before, purposely increasing the shuttle's angle of attack in the flare to bring the aircraft near a stall, thus allowing the shuttle to drop its speed quickly and allowing him to land the shuttle safely.\n\nThe film ends with the [[Frank Sinatra]] song \"[[Fly Me to the Moon]]\", zooming in on the surface of the Moon showing that Hawk had indeed landed there before he died.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Colonel Francis D. \"Frank\" Corvin, Ph.D., USAF (Ret.)\n** [[Toby Stephens]] as Young Frank Corvin\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Colonel William \"Hawk\" Hawkins, USAF (Ret.)\n** [[Eli Craig]] as Young William \"Hawk\" Hawkins\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Captain Jerry O'Neill, USAF (Ret.)\n** [[John Mallory Asher]] as Young Jerry O'Neill\n* [[James Garner]] as Captain / Reverend \"Tank\" Sullivan, USAF (Ret.)\n** [[Matt McColm]] as Young \"Tank\" Sullivan\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Sara Holland\n* [[William Devane]] as Flight Director Eugene \"Gene\" Davis\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Ethan Glance\n* [[Courtney B.
