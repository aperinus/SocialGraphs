The film also nominated for [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design]] but lost to ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins in 1935 in [[Florence]], where a group of cultured expatriate [[English People|English]] women \u2013 the \"[[the Scorpioni|Scorpioni]]\" \u2013 meet for tea every afternoon. Young Luca is the illegitimate son of an Italian businessman who's little interested in his son's upbringing; the boy's seamstress mother has recently died.\n\nMary Wallace, the man's secretary, steps in to care for Luca, seeking support from her Scorpioni friends, including eccentric would-be artist Arabella. They teach Luca about life and the arts. Elsa Morganthal, a rich young American widow who Scorpioni matron Lady Hester Random barely tolerates, sets up a financial trust for Luca when she hears his mother has died, as she was fond of her and still owes her money for her dressmaking services.\n\nOne day when the ladies are having afternoon tea, Italian [[National Fascist Party|Fascists]] disrupt them, reflecting the increasingly uncertain position of the expatriate community. Lady Hester, widow of Britain's former ambassador to Italy, retains an admiring faith in [[Benito Mussolini]]. She visits him, receiving his assurances of their safety, and proudly recounts her \"tea with Mussolini\".\n\nAs the political situation continues to deteriorate, the Scorpioni find their status and liberties diminishing. Luca's father decides Italy's future is with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] rather than [[United Kingdom|Britain]], so sends Luca to an [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian]] [[boarding school]].\n\nFive years later, Luca plans to study art in Florence with Elsa's trust fund. He finds that most British nationals are fleeing the country, anticipating Mussolini's [[Military history of Italy during World War II|declaration of war on Great Britain]], and that Mary has moved in with Lady Hester and the other English hold-outs. Arriving at the house just as they \u2013 and Hester's grandson Wilfred, disguised as a woman \u2013 are being transported to the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] town of [[San Gimignano]], he follows.\n\nAs the U.S. is not at war, Elsa and her American compatriot Georgie Rockwell, an openly lesbian [[archaeologist]], remain free. Elsa uses Luca to deliver forged orders and funds to have the ladies moved from their barren quarters to an upper class hotel. Believing that Mussolini helped, Lady Hester is delighted, proudly brandishing the newspaper photo of her tea with ''Il Duce''.\n\n[[File:Piazza cisterna 01.jpg|thumb|left|The Piazza Cisterna in [[San Gimignano]], where many of the film's scenes were shot.]]\n\nAs the war progresses, Jewish oppression increases and the Jewish Elsa \u2013 protected somewhat by her citizenship and wealth \u2013 gets a group of Italian Jews fake passports, enlisting Luca \u2013 who is enamored of her \u2013 to deliver them. However he becomes jealous when seeing she's involved with Italian lawyer Vittorio.\n\nWhen the U.S. enters the war in 1941, Elsa and Georgie are interned with the British women. Tricked by Vittorio, who embezzles her art collection and money, he plans to deliver her to the German [[Gestapo]] in a phony escape to [[Switzerland]]. Luca knows but tells no one out of jealous spite. Mary learns of it from Elsa's art dealer and scolds him.\n\nLuca's attitude changes and he gives his trust fund money to the [[Italian resistance movement]], which Wilfred has joined. Elsa refuses to believe Vittorio's betrayal until Lady Hester, discovering what Elsa has done for all of them, repents and offers gratitude and help. Elsa's escape plan is hatched by Mary, Luca and Wilfred. Before leaving, she tells Luca she supported his young mother to go through with her pregnancy, so he could be there for her.\n\nIn July 1944, as the [[British Army]] advances toward [[San Gimignano]], Arabella defends her frescoes from demolition by German troops, heroically joined in the line of fire by Georgie and the English women, including Lady Hester. They are saved when the Germans retreat, leaving the women and the towers untouched.\n\nThe city rejoices as the [[Scots Guards]] arrive, with Luca now serving as their Italian interpreter. The major has orders to evacuate the Scorpioni but Lady Hester refuses, resolved that they will resume their former lives in Italy. Mary is delighted to see that Luca \u2013 now in British uniform \u2013 has become the \"English gentleman\" his father wished him to be.\n\nClosing texts explain the mostly happy fates of the characters, concluding with the remark that Luca has become an artist and is the writer and director of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ermanno scervino, costume indossato da cher per un t\u00e8 con mussolini, 1999.jpg|thumb|Costume for Cher, by [[Ermanno Scervino]] (Museo Zeffirelli, Florence)]]\n* [[Joan Plowright]] as Mary Wallace, a British expatriate who becomes a surrogate mother for Luca\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Lady Hester Random, widow of the former British ambassador to Italy\n* [[Cher]] as Elsa Morganthal Strauss-Armistan, a wealthy American socialite\n* [[Judi Dench]] as Arabella, an aspiring artist and art lover\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Georgina 'Georgie' Rockwell, an openly lesbian American archaeologist\n* Tessa Pritchard as Connie Raynor, a journalist for ''The Morning Post''\n* Baird Wallace as Luca Innocente, as a teenager\n* Charlie Lucas as Luca Innocente, as a child\n* [[Paul Chequer]] as Wilfred 'Lucy' Random, Lady Hester's grandson\n* [[Paolo Seganti]] as Vittorio Fanfanni, a lawyer and Elsa's lover\n* Mino Bellei as Cesare, an art dealer and close friend of Elsa\n* [[Massimo Ghini]] as Paolo Guarnieri Innocente, Luca's father\n* [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] as the British Consul\n* Claudio Spadaro as [[Benito Mussolini]]\n* [[Pino Colizzi]] as [[Dino Grandi]]\n* [[Paula Jacobs]] as Molly\n\n[[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]], who was married to [[Judi Dench]] in real life, died not long after the film was finished.

Zeffirelli mentions her and a couple of other ladies of ''the Scorpioni'' in his autobiography. He said: \"I don't remember if she was called Hester, but I remember this terrible, fantastic woman. She was the dowager of the community. I remember the many outrageous things she did because she could afford to be arrogant and bossy.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zeffirelli |first1=Franco |title=Zeffirelli: An Autobiography |date=September 1, 1986 |publisher=Grove Pr}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film opened tenth at the U.S. box office with $1,633,183 for the weekend, eventually grossing a worldwide total of $45,566,200, considerably more than its budget.\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 64% from 39 reviews with the consensus: \"''Tea with Mussolini'' contains few surprises, but this amiably ambling drama is too likable \u2013 and well-cast \u2013 to completely resist.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tea_with_mussolini|title = Tea with Mussolini |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, \"There are some scary, somber moments in this lushest of period pieces, yet Zeffirelli wisely sustains a gallant, predominantly blithe spirit throughout.
