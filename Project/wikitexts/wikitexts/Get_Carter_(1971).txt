Based on [[Ted Lewis (writer)|Ted Lewis]]'s 1970 novel ''[[Jack's Return Home]]'', the film follows the eponymous Jack Carter (Caine), a London [[gangster]] who returns to his hometown in [[North East England]] to learn about his brother's supposedly accidental death. Suspecting foul play, and with vengeance on his mind, he investigates and interrogates, regaining a feel for the city and its hardened-criminal element.\n\nProducer [[Michael Klinger (producer)|Michael Klinger]] optioned Lewis's novel shortly after its publication and made a deal with the ailing [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) to finance and release the film, making ''Get Carter'' the last project to be approved by the studio's [[MGM-British Studios|Borehamwood division]] before its closure. The production went from novel to finished film in eight months, with [[principal photography]] taking place from July to September 1970 in and around [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Gateshead]] and [[County Durham]]. Hodges, Klinger and Caine intended to create a more realistic portrayal of violence and [[criminal behaviour]] than had previously been seen in British films: Caine, who also served as an uncredited co-producer, incorporated aspects of criminal acquaintances into his characterisation of Carter, while Hodges conducted research into the criminal underworld of Newcastle (in particular the [[one-armed bandit murder]]). [[Cinematographer]] [[Wolfgang Suschitzky]] worked with Hodges to give scenes a naturalistic feel, drawing heavily on their backgrounds in [[documentary film]]s.\n\nTurning a respectable profit upon its initial UK release, ''Get Carter'' initially attracted mixed reviews. Critics begrudgingly appreciated the film's technical achievements and Caine's performance while criticizing the complex plot, violence and amorality, in particular Carter's apparent lack of remorse for his actions.<ref name=\"Mayer-2003\"/> American critics were generally more enthusiastic, but the film languished on the [[drive-in]] circuit, while MGM focused its resources on producing ''[[Hit Man (1972 film)|Hit Man]]'', a [[Blaxploitation]]-themed remake of the film.\n\n''Get Carter'' eventually garnered a [[cult following]], and further endorsements from directors such as [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Guy Ritchie]] led to the film being critically re-evaluated,<ref name=\"Crossan-09-12-2009\">{{cite news |last=Crossan |first=Rob|title=Defining Moment: 'Get Carter' rewrites the gangster movie, March 1971 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/25adefe8-9c0f-11de-b214-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1pJXFzqcD |access-date=16 March 2012|newspaper=Financial Times Magazine|date=12 September 2009}}</ref> with its depiction of class structure and life in 1970s Britain and [[Roy Budd]]'s minimalist [[jazz]] score receiving considerable praise.<ref name=AFI /> In 1999, ''Get Carter'' was ranked 16th on the [[BFI Top 100 British films]] of the 20th century; five years later, a survey of British film critics in ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine chose it as the greatest British film.<ref name=\"03-10-2004\">{{cite news |title=''Get Carter'' tops British film poll |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3711460.stm |access-date=6 April 2012 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=3 October 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515044118/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3711460.stm |archive-date=15 May 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> A poorly-received second remake under the [[Get Carter (2000 film)|same title]] was released in 2000, with [[Sylvester Stallone]] portraying Jack Carter and Caine in a supporting role.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]-born [[gangster]] Jack Carter has lived in London for years in the employ of [[organised crime]] bosses Gerald and Sid Fletcher. Jack is sleeping with Gerald's girlfriend Anna and plans to escape with her to [[South America]], but he must first return to Newcastle and [[Gateshead]] to attend the funeral of his brother, Frank, who died in a purported drunk-driving accident. His bosses warn him not to stir up trouble, as they are friendly with the Newcastle mob. Unsatisfied with the official explanation, Jack investigates for himself. At the funeral, Jack meets his teenage niece Doreen, and Frank's evasive mistress Margaret.\n\nJack goes to [[Newcastle Racecourse]], seeking his old acquaintance Albert Swift for information about his brother's death, but Swift evades him. Jack encounters another old associate, Eric Paice, who refuses to tell Jack who is employing him as a chauffeur. Tailing Eric leads him to the country house of crime boss Cyril Kinnear. Jack confronts Kinnear but learns little from him; he also meets a glamorous drunken woman, Glenda. As Jack leaves, Eric warns him against damaging relations between Kinnear and the Fletchers. Back in town, Jack is threatened by henchmen who want him to leave town, but he fights them off, capturing and interrogating one to find out who wants him gone. He is told the name \"Brumby\".\n\nJack knows Cliff Brumby as a businessman with controlling interests in local seaside [[amusement arcade]]s. Visiting Brumby's house, Jack discovers the man knows nothing about him and, believing he has been set up, he leaves. The next morning two of Jack's London colleagues \u2013 Con McCarthy and Peter the Dutchman \u2013 arrive, sent by the Fletchers to take him back, but he escapes. Jack meets Margaret to talk about Frank, but the Fletchers' men are waiting and pursue him. He is rescued by Glenda, who takes him in her sports car to meet Brumby at his new restaurant development at the top of a [[multi-storey car park]]. Brumby identifies Kinnear as being behind Frank's death, also explaining that Kinnear is trying to take over his business. He offers Jack \u00a35,000 to kill the crime boss, which he refuses.\n\nJack has sex with Glenda at her flat, where he finds and watches a [[pornographic film]] in which Doreen is forced to have sex with Albert. The other participants in the film are Glenda and Margaret. Jack becomes enraged and pushes Glenda's head underwater as she is taking a bath. She tells him the film was Kinnear's, and that she thinks Doreen was pulled into the production by Eric. Forcing Glenda into the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] of her car, Jack drives off to find Albert.\n\nJack tracks down Albert, who confesses he told Brumby that Doreen was Frank's daughter. Brumby showed Frank the film to incite him to call the police on Kinnear; Eric and two of his men arranged Frank's death. Having extracted this information, Jack fatally stabs Albert. Jack is attacked by the London gangsters and Eric, who has informed Fletcher of Jack and Anna's affair. In the ensuing shootout, Jack shoots Peter dead. As Eric and Con escape, they push the sports car into the river, unaware that Glenda is in the boot. Returning to the car park, Jack finds and beats Brumby before throwing him to his death. He then posts the film to the [[Scotland Yard]] [[Vice unit#Law enforcement|vice squad]].\n\nJack abducts Margaret. He telephones Kinnear in the middle of a wild party, telling him he has the film and makes a deal for Kinnear to give him Eric in exchange for his silence. Kinnear agrees, sending Eric to an agreed location; however, he subsequently phones an associate. Jack drives Margaret to the grounds of Kinnear's estate, kills her with a fatal injection and leaves her body there. He then calls the police to raid Kinnear's party.\n\nJack chases Eric along a beach. He forces Eric to drink a bottle of whisky as Eric had done to Frank, then beats him to death with his shotgun. Having avenged Frank and Doreen, Jack walks along the shoreline{{snd}}where he is shot dead from a distance by Kinnear's associate.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Get-carter-trailer.jpg|thumb|Jack Carter as seen in the film's trailer]]\nThere was pressure from MGM to have more big-name American stars in the film, which was successfully resisted by Hodges. As well as [[Telly Savalas]], names posited by Klinger and studio executives were [[Joan Collins]], and someone Hodges described as \"the Canadian lead actress in TV's ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]''\", which is likely a reference to [[Barbara Parkins]].<ref name=Klinger/> The production also utilised a large number of extras, most of whom were locals who just happened to be on scene when filming was happening. Others were sourced from local casting company Beverley Artistes, which sent everyone registered with it for auditions, one of these being Deana Wilde, who was cast as the pub singer. Several of the company's actors were also in background shots in the film including the casino, streets, bars and the police raid scene.<ref name=\"BBC-carter-march 2011\">{{cite news|title=Get Carter celebrates its 40th anniversary|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/tyne/hi/front_page/newsid_9421000/9421191.stm|access-date=20 February 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=11 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031003242/http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/tyne/hi/front_page/newsid_9421000/9421191.stm|archive-date=31 October 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Jack Carter.

Hodges was surprised that a star of Caine's stature would want to play such a thoroughly unlikeable person as Carter. Giving his reasons for wanting to be involved with the film, the actor said \"One of the reasons I wanted to make that picture was my background. In English movies, gangsters were either stupid or funny. I wanted to show that they're neither. Gangsters are not stupid, and they're certainly not very funny\".

Accordingly, her small role in the film was overemphasised in the publicity. Ekland was afraid of becoming typecast, having already played two [[gangster's moll]]s before ''Carter''.<ref name=SC29/> She was also reluctant to take the part as she did not want to take her clothes off; however, she had financial problems at the time as a result of bad investment decisions by her accountant.

He grew up in working-class [[Hoxton]] and had come to acting late when in 1959 he joined [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]]. A well-known face on British television in the 1960s, his sandblasted features and shifty, haunted looks made him ideal for playing villainous characters or hard-bitten detectives.

Lewis depicted Peter as a misogynistic homosexual in his novel; these elements were not emphasised in the film, although the character is flamboyant and [[Camp (style)|camp]].

Like Sewell, Edwards was an apprentice of Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop who had come to acting in his thirties. He had previously appeared alongside Caine in ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' and ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]''.

Petra Markham was a 24-year-old experienced theatre actress when she was asked to play the role of Carter's 16-year-old niece. Her appearance in only four scenes in the film meant she could balance the film work with appearing at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]] and her role in the television series ''[[Albert and Victoria]]''.

White had a successful career as a television actress and was particularly well known for ''[[Z-Cars]]'', but the part of Margaret was her first credited cinematic role (the only other being a part in the 1955 film ''[[Touch and Go (1955 film)|Touch & Go]]''). She had previously worked with Mike Hodges on the television play ''Suspect''.<ref name=\"Chibnall 31\" />\n* [[Rosemarie Dunham]] as Edna, Carter's landlady.

He was the son of a London cab driver who was \"discovered\" by [[Ken Loach]] in a pub. As a young man Bindon had been in and out of [[borstal]], and spent most of his adult life associating with criminals, so he was ideally suited to play a [[Organized crime|gangland]] boss, despite being young, having intimate knowledge of that world.

Rigby was another actor Hodges cast from his familiarity in television police drama.<ref name=\"Chibnall 34\">Chibnall, p. 34</ref>\n\nMike Hodges recruited a band of experienced character actors to play the small supporting roles. [[Godfrey Quigley]] was cast as Eddie, a colleague of Frank Carter's. [[Kevin Brennan (actor)|Kevin Brennan]] appears as Harry the card-player. [[Ben Aris]], who plays one of the architects, had previously appeared in such films as ''[[if....]]'', ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' and ''[[Hamlet (1969 film)|Hamlet]]''.<ref name=\"Chibnall 34\" />\n\nCarl Howard's character of the assassin, \"J\", is only identified by the initial on his ring, in his only film role, and an appropriate mystery surrounds his real identity. His name does not appear on the credits of some prints. Mike Hodges explained that Howard was an extra in his TV film ''Rumour'', and the director gave him a line to say, but another extra was wrongly credited.

He suggested Hodges use John Trumper as editor. Hodges said that he and Trumper argued and disagreed constantly, but he still thought he was a \"brilliant, brilliant editor\" and was \"very grateful to him for [...] how much he contributed\". Sound editing and dubbing was done by Jim Atkinson, whom Hodges described as \"so obsessive about the job\". He gave Hodges multiple possibilities of how the sound could be dubbed, and explored every angle. Klinger was worried that the debut director might be overwhelmed with too many options, but Hodges said he and Atkinson got on very well.<ref name=Klinger/>\n\nThe majority of the film's music was composed by [[Roy Budd]], a jazz pianist and composer, who had previously worked on soundtracks for ''[[Soldier Blue]]'' and ''[[Flight of the Doves]]''. Aside from its score, Budd also composed three songs: \"Looking For Someone\", \"Love Is A Four Letter Word\" (with lyrics by Jack Fishman) and \"Hallucinations\".<ref name=AFI/> The theme (otherwise known as \"Carter Takes a Train\"), the best-known piece from the film, was played by Budd and the other members of his jazz trio, [[Jeff Clyne]] ([[double bass]]) and [[Chris Karan]] ([[percussion]]), and was recorded on a budget of \u00a3450.
