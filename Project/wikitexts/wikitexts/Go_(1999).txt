The film stars [[William Fichtner]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Jay Mohr]], [[Sarah Polley]], and [[Scott Wolf]] and features [[Taye Diggs]], [[Breckin Meyer]], [[Timothy Olyphant]], [[Desmond Askew]], [[Jane Krakowski]], [[J. E. Freeman]], and [[Melissa McCarthy]] in her film debut.\n\nThe film underperformed at the box office, but was critically acclaimed. It has since become a [[cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n<!-- UNCONVENTIONAL STRUCTURE and TIMELINE qualify this film for plot size exceptions as noted at [[WP:FILMPLOT]] - see talk page-->\n\nAround [[Christmas]], Ronna, working overtime at her supermarket job to avoid being evicted, is approached by Adam and Zack to buy 20 hits of [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]], which they had hoped to buy from her absent co-worker, Simon.\n\nAfter work, Ronna approaches Simon's dealer, Todd, for the pills. She is unable to pay the full amount so she leaves her friend Claire with Todd as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Ronna meets with Adam and Zack but grows suspicious of Burke, a stranger accompanying them who presses her for the ecstasy. She flushes the drugs down the toilet and leaves, then steals over-the-counter pills to replace them, helped by Manny (Nathan Bexton) who had covertly swallowed two of the ecstasy pills, unaware of their strength. Ronna gives 20 of the fake pills to Todd. She, Claire, and Manny then go to a [[rave]] where she sells the rest of the fake pills as ecstasy.\n\nTodd realizes the pills are fake and pursues Ronna to the rave. Ronna flees, hiding the now incapacitated Manny in an alley and promising to return with her car. Todd confronts her with a gun in the parking lot when she is hit by a car that speeds away, leaving her motionless in a ditch.\n\nThe story restarts from the perspective of Simon, who is on a trip to [[Las Vegas]] with Marcus, Tiny, and Singh. Simon crashes a wedding and has sex with two of the bridesmaids before they accidentally set their hotel room on fire. Simon and Marcus leave the hotel, stealing a [[Ferrari]] whose owner thinks Marcus is a [[Valet parking|parking valet]].\n\nThe two go to a [[strip club]] where Simon enrages the bouncer, Victor Jr., by groping one of the strippers. Simon shoots Victor Jr. in the arm with a gun that he found in the car. He and Marcus flee to the hotel, rousing Tiny and Singh. A car chase ensues and the four barely escape the bouncer and his father, Victor Sr., but Victor Sr. traces Todd's address from his credit card, which Simon had borrowed.\n\nThe story changes perspective to Adam and Zack, actors in a [[soap opera]] who are in a relationship. Having been busted for drug possession, they are coerced into working for Burke, a police detective, to entrap their dealer. Adam is fitted with a [[Covert listening device|wire]]. As Simon is absent, the two arrange to buy drugs from Ronna. When Ronna arrives later to make the deal, Zack secretly warns her so she flushes the drugs down the toilet and leaves.\n\nAfter the unsuccessful bust, Burke invites Adam and Zack to Christmas dinner, where they observe strange behavior from Burke and his wife, Irene. Over dinner Burke and Irene pitch a [[multi-level marketing]] company to Adam and Zack. Discussing their mutual infidelities, Adam and Zack realize they both cheated with the same person, Jimmy. They confront him at the rave, cutting a lock of his hair.\n\nLeaving the rave they accidentally run over Ronna, panic, and drive away when they see Todd with a gun. Zack tries to reassure Adam that, even if Ronna had survived, Todd would have shot her. Adam realizes to his horror that he is still wearing his wire. Fearing they have been recorded, the two return to the scene to remove Ronna's body but discover she is just unconscious. They prop her up on a car, setting off its alarm, and watch from a distance as other partygoers call an ambulance.\n\nAs morning breaks, Claire goes to a restaurant to meet up with Ronna and Manny, but encounters Todd instead. The two end up going to Todd's apartment building. While making out on the stairs they are confronted by the two Victors. Simon arrives, having hoped to hide for a few days. The ensuing scuffle is stopped by Claire, who refuses to witness a murder.\n\nSimon agrees to be shot in the arm by Victor Jr. as Claire leaves in disgust. Meanwhile, Ronna wakes up in hospital and hobbles to the supermarket to start work. Realizing she left Manny at the rave, she and Claire return to the venue to find Manny pale and shaking in the alley. The three go to Ronna's car where Ronna muses that she can now pay her rent and Manny asks what their plans are for [[New Year's Eve|New Year's]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Burke Halverson\n* [[Desmond Askew]] as Simon Baines\n* [[Scott Wolf]] as Adam\n* [[Jay Mohr]] as Zack\n* [[Sarah Polley]] as Ronna Martin\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Todd Gaines\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Claire Montgomery\n* Nathan Bexton as Mannie\n* [[Tony Denman]] as Track Suit Guy\n* [[Taye Diggs]] as Marcus\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as Tiny\n* [[James Duval]] as Singh\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Sandra\n* [[J.

Polley, who resides in Canada, was offered the role directly, without auditioning. Olyphant was a late addition; he was about to shoot the film ''[[Practical Magic]]'' but was fired from his role and replaced by [[Aidan Quinn]], enabling him to join the cast as Todd.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI2eBF4F2jM|title=Timothy Olyphant interview|work=[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]|publisher=NBC|date=March 11, 2013}}</ref>  He was called in to audition for Adam or Zack, but all agreed he was better as drug dealer Todd, the character he wanted to play.\n\nWhen ''Go'' was about to start shooting, its foreign financing fell through because the film lacked a \"bankable white male star.\" [[Columbia Pictures]] stepped in and financed the film. As most of the plot takes place at night, August recalled being \"outside in the dark from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. for 25 days\" during filming.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rosen|first1=Christopher|title=15 Years Later, John August Looks Back On 'Go'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/go-15th-anniversary_n_5107394.html|access-date=April 18, 2017|work=Huffington Post|date=April 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Go'' was released to critical acclaim. The film received a 91% approval rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 74 critic reviews, with an average score of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"With its sharp dialogue and raucous visuals, ''Go'' entertains at an exhilarating pace.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1087053_go?|title=Go (1999)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=March 2, 2018}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/go |title=Go Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=March 2, 2018}}</ref> Many critics generally found ''Go''{{'}}s fast pace and light-hearted feel appealing. The film grossed $28.5 million worldwide against a $20 million budget. The film was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on September 3, 1999, and opened at #6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=19990903|title=Weekend box office 3rd September 1999 - 5th September 1999|publisher=www.25thframe.co.uk|access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBecause of its irreverent and frequently off topic dialogue, fast pace, rapidly changing point of view, and non chronological format, the film is generally categorized as one of many movies of varying quality that attempted to capture the style of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. [[Leonard Maltin]], who disliked the film, said that ''Go'' came off as a \"junior ''Pulp Fiction''.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|date=2008|title=Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide|location=New York|publisher=Signet|page=529}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike many of the films in the subgenre, the comparisons were mostly favorable, with [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' stating that \"''Go'' is an entertaining, clever black comedy that takes place entirely in Tarantino-land.... ''Go'' has energy and wit, and the performances are right for the material \u2013 especially Sarah Polley, who thinks fast and survives harrowing experiences, and Fichtner, the cop who is so remarkably open to new experiences.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Go Movie Review & Film Summary (1999)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/go-1999|access-date=April 18, 2017|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=April 9, 1999|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the performances of Olyphant and Fichtner, as well as ''Go''{{'}}s energy and Liman's direction: \"Artfully executed druggy flights of fancy include a hallucinatory [[Macarena (song)|macarena]] in a supermarket, a mind-reading black cat and a smart visual approximation of how it feels to be on the verge of throwing up. Here and elsewhere, Mr. Liman manipulates speed, light, editing and point of view vigorously and keeps the radio humming. He creates a film that lives up to the momentum of its title and doesn't really need much more.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Maslin |first1=Janet |date=April 9, 1999 |title=Pulp Friction, With Drugs, Energy and Attitude |language=en |work=The New York Times |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/040999go-film-review.html |access-date=April 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe film has endured as a cult classic, with critics continuing to review the film. In 2008, Joe Valdez of ''The Distracted Globe'' wrote, \"Few titles have the finesse to sum up a movie as brilliantly as ''Go'', a drug fueled rollercoaster ride that alternates between dark comedy and light suspense with terrific verve. The film's appeal lies in its modest scale and the fact that it was made mostly by starving artist types. ...Nearly everyone involved in the production was a relative unknown or comer. With no pressure to supply an entertainment to the masses, the writer, director and most of the actors deliver the best work of their careers.\"<ref name=\"distracted\"/>\n\nIn April 2014, Joe Reid of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' revisited ''Go'' on the 15th anniversary of its release. Reid noted that at the time it came out, it was seen as a \"knock-off\" of other 1990s films. \"The split narrative style, complete with character title cards separating the film into thirds, put ''Go'' at the top of the list when it came to late '90s Tarantino influenced cinema. And then there was director Doug Liman, red hot off of the cult success of ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]'', trading neo swing culture for X and raves. (Both films would give a healthy chunk of attention to Vegas, though.) The thing about ''Go'' that sets it apart, however, is that it's COMPLETELY FANTASTIC. Energetic and quotable and stylish and neither overly enamored with nor overly dismissive of the culture it's inhabiting.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Reid|first1=Joe|title='Go' Cast Power Rankings, Then and Now|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/go-power-rankings-then-and-now/360397/|access-date=April 18, 2017|work=The Atlantic|date=April 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Track listing|extra_column=Artist(s)| title1 = [[New (No Doubt song)|New]] | extra1 = [[No Doubt]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/go-1999-original-soundtrack-mw0000231222|title=''Go'' [1999 Original Soundtrack]|website=AllMusic}}</ref> | length1 = 4:13\n| title2 = [[Steal My Sunshine]] | extra2 = [[Len (band)|Len]] | length2 = 4:08\n| title3 = [[Magic Carpet Ride (Steppenwolf song)|Magic Carpet Ride]] | note3 = Steir's mix | extra3 = [[Philip Steir]] featuring [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] | length3 = 3:25\n| title4 = Troubled by the Way We Came Together | extra4 = [[Natalie Imbruglia]] | length4 = 3:50\n| title5 = [[Gangster Trippin'|Gangster Trippin{{'-}}]] | extra5 = [[Fatboy Slim]] | length5 = 5:19\n| title6 = Cha Cha Cha | note6 = ''Go'' remix | extra6 = [[Jimmy Luxury|Jimmy Luxury & The Tommy Rome Orchestra]] | length6 = 3:27\n| title7 = Song for Holly | extra7 = [[Esthero]] with [[Danny Saber]] | length7 = 4:06\n| title8 = Fire Up the Shoesaw | note8 = LP version | extra8 = [[Lionrock]] | length8 = 5:43\n| title9 = To All the Lovely Ladies | note9 = radio mix | extra9 = Goldo | length9 = 3:14\n| title10 = Good to Be Alive | extra10 = [[DJ Rap]] | length10 = 4:15\n| title11 = Believer | extra11 = [[BT (musician)|BT]] | length11 = 5:11\n| title12 = Shooting Up in Vain | note12 = T-Ray remix | extra12 = [[Eagle-Eye Cherry]] | length12 = 4:51\n| title13 = Talisman | extra13 = [[Air French Band|Air]] | length13 = 4:16\n| title14 = [[Swords (Leftfield song)|Swords]] | extra14 = [[Leftfield]] featuring [[Nicole Willis]] | length14 = 7:17\n}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+\n!Award\n!Category\n!Nominee(s)\n!Result\n!{{Abbr|Ref.|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n|[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards]]\n|Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures\n|[[Gregg Diamond]] for the song \"[[Steal My Sunshine]]\"\n|{{won}}\n|{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA101 |title=Jewison and Bernstein Scoop ASCAP Awards |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=May 5, 2001 |page=101}}</ref>}}\n|-\n|[[1st Canadian Comedy Awards|Canadian Comedy Awards]]\n|Film - Performance - Female\n|[[Sarah Polley]]\n|{{won}}\n|{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nominations & Awards Archives {{!}} Canadian Comedy Awards |url=https://www.canadiancomedyawards.org/archives.php?year=2000 |access-date=2022-10-15 |website=www.canadiancomedyawards.org}}</ref>}}\n|-\n|[[Casting Society of America|Casting Society of America Awards]]\n|Best Casting for Feature Film, Drama\n|Joseph Middleton\n|{{nom}}\n|{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite web |title=1999 Artios Awards |url=https://www.castingsociety.com/awards/artios/1999 |access-date=2022-10-15 |website=www.castingsociety.com |language=en}}</ref>}}\n|-\n|[[Chlotrudis Society for Independent Films|Chlotrudis Awards]]\n|Best Actress\n|Sarah Polley\n|{{nom}}\n|{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite web |title=2000, 6th Annual Awards |url=https://chlotrudis.org/awards/past-awards/2000-6th-annual-awards/ |access-date=2022-10-15 |website=Chlotrudis Society for Independent Film |language=en-US}}</ref>}}\n|-\n|[[Deauville American Film Festival|Deauville Film Festival]]\n|Grand Special Prize \n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Doug Liman]]\n|{{nom}}\n|{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite web |title=Deauville Film Festival 1999 |url=https://mubi.com/awards-and-festivals/deauville?year=1999 |access-date=2022-10-15 |website=MUBI |language=en}}</ref>}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[15th Independent Spirit Awards|Independent Spirit Awards]]\n|[[Independent Spirit Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|{{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{align|center|<ref>{{Cite news |date=2000-01-13 |title=\"Election,\" \"Limey\" Up for Indie Oscars |work=E!
