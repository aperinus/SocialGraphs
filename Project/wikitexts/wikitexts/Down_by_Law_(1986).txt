It discards jailbreak film conventions by focusing on the interaction between the convicts rather than on the mechanics of the escape. A key element in the film is [[Robby M\u00fcller]]'s slow-moving camerawork, which captures the architecture of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and the [[Louisiana]] [[bayou]] to which the cellmates escape.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThree men, previously unknown to each other, are arrested in [[New Orleans]] and placed in the same cell. Both Zack (Waits), a [[disc jockey]], and Jack (Lurie), a [[pimp]], have been set up, neither having committed the crime for which they have been arrested. Their cellmate Bob (Benigni, in his first international role<ref>{{cite book|last=Su\u00e1rez|first=Juan Antonio|title=Jim Jarmusch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0Wec-S-kK4C&pg=PA48|year=2007|publisher=U of Illinois P|isbn=9780252074431|page=48}}</ref>), an Italian tourist who understands minimal English, was imprisoned for accidental [[manslaughter]].\n\nZack and Jack soon come to blows and thereafter avoid speaking to each other. Bob has an irrepressible need for conversation. He hatches a plan to escape, and before long the three are on the run through the swamp surrounding the prison. Hopelessly lost and with a simmering hatred between Jack and Zack almost causing the party to split up, they are brought together by Bob's ability to provide food. The trio eventually chances across a house in the forest, the residence of Nicoletta (Braschi). Bob and Nicoletta instantly fall in love, and Bob decides to stay with her in the forest. Zack and Jack go their separate ways\u2014an unspoken, begrudging friendship hanging between them as they part.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Waits]] as Zack\n* [[John Lurie]] as Jack\n* [[Roberto Benigni]] as Roberto\n* [[Nicoletta Braschi]] as Nicoletta\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Laurette\n* Billie Neal as Bobbie\n* [[Rockets Redglare]] as Gig\n* [[Vernel Bagneris]] as Preston\n* Timothea as Julie\n* L.C.
