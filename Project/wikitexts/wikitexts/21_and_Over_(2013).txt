The film stars [[Justin Chon]], [[Miles Teller]], and [[Skylar Astin]], and follows a trio of friends who go out drinking to celebrate one of their 21st birthdays despite having a medical school interview the following morning. The film was released on March 1, 2013, received generally unfavorable reviews from critics and grossed $48 million.\n\n==Plot==\nCasey and Miller invite their college friend, Jeff Chang, out to celebrate his 21st birthday. Jeff declines, citing an important medical school interview early the next morning that his domineering doctor father arranged; Jeff finally agrees to having one drink.\n\nAt a bar, Jeff accidentally hits a guy with a dart, and the trio flee, interrupting Casey's chat with Jeff's attractive friend, Nicole. Enthused about drinking legally, Jeff [[Binge drinking|over imbibes]] and passes out. Casey and Miller want to take Jeff home but forget where he lives.\n\nThinking that Nicole knows Jeff's address, they sneak into what they believe is her [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|sorority]] house, only to discover it is a Latina one. Upstairs, they encounter two blindfolded pledges undergoing [[hazing|initiation]]. Miller paddles the girls' buttocks, ordering them to make out. Upon realizing they were tricked, the entire sorority is furious. Casey and Miller escape, first tossing Jeff from an upstairs balcony onto a covered pool. Bouncing off, a drunken Jeff lands in a rose garden still passed out.\n\nThe boys locate Nicole at a pep rally. She refers them to her boyfriend, Randy, the angry guy from the bar. When he refuses to look up the address in his phone, they steal it. Jeff no longer lives at that address but a party is in progress there. Searching for somebody who knows Jeff's address, Casey and Miller leave him alone with two stoners. For fun, they strip Jeff, write \"Douche Bag\" on his forehead and glue a teddy bear to his crotch. He then wanders into the street, causing a commotion. The police apprehend and transfer him to the campus health center.\n\nAs Casey and Miller head to the clinic, the vengeful Latina sorority girls abduct them. They find themselves in a ritualistic setting, stripped and shackled to the floor. They are forced to endure what they tricked the two pledge girls into doing. Embarrassed, bruised, and sporting bright-red spanked buttocks, they are released and walk across campus wearing only tube socks over their genitals. Casey blames Miller's immaturity for their predicament, unleashing long-simmering mutual resentment that culminates into a brawl.\n\nAt the health center, Casey and Miller discover Jeff is on a 24-hour hold due to a previous suicide attempt. They encounter Nicole. She is there with Randy, who was injured at the pep rally, though she has just broken up with him. Casey and Miller eventually deduce where Jeff lives and smuggle him out of the clinic. Groggy and barely sober, Jeff steals Randy's truck, fleeing with Miller and Casey. Randy and his buddies, and also the police, chase them until the vehicle careens down an embankment, losing the pursuers.\n\nThey arrive at Jeff's apartment with barely enough time to prepare him for the interview. Randy arrives, threatening the boys, but Jeff's father shows up and beats Randy. Encouraged by Casey and Miller, Jeff confronts his father, saying he does not want to be a doctor. Dr. Chang berates him until Jeff orders him to leave, surprisingly earning him Randy's respect, who resents his own domineering father. Casey, meanwhile, realizes he has fallen for Nicole and goes after her.\n\nThree months later, Casey, Nicole, Miller, and Jeff are partying at a music festival. Later, Miller, a college dropout who was an intelligent but academically lazy student, applies to Jeff's university. Casey is dating Nicole. Jeff is pursuing music and has a girlfriend.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Justin Chon]] as Jeff Chang<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/movie-news/item/7662-21-and-over-theatrical-trailer-a-birthday-gone-horribly-right.html |title='21 AND OVER' THEATRICAL TRAILER: A BIRTHDAY GONE HORRIBLY RIGHT |publisher=Iamrogue.com |accessdate=2013-01-20}}</ref>\n* [[Miles Teller]] as Miller\n* [[Skylar Astin]] as Casey\n* [[Sarah Wright]] as Nicole\n* [[Francois Chau]] as Dr. Chang\n* [[Jonathan Keltz]] as Randy\n* [[Daniel Booko]] as Julian\n* [[Samantha Futerman]] as Sally Huang\n* Eddy Martin As Eddy \n* [[Dustin Ybarra]] as PJ Bril\n* Christiann Castellanos as Pledge Gomez\n* Jeremiah Sird as Dr. Cabahug\n\n==Production==\n[[Jon Lucas]] and [[Scott Moore (screenwriter)|Scott Moore]] had worked together previously as writers on multiple films, including ''[[The Hangover]]'', ''[[The Change-Up]]'' and ''[[Ghosts of Girlfriends Past]]''.\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] was scheduled to begin on September 22, 2011, at the [[University of Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.relativitymediallc.com/News.aspx?pid=4ba435ec-dcbb-4d72-1b79-bd78d12ece08 |title=PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY BEGINS ON 21 AND OVER |publisher=Relativitymediallc.com |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2013-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219235304/http://www.relativitymediallc.com/News.aspx?pid=4ba435ec-dcbb-4d72-1b79-bd78d12ece08 |archive-date=2013-02-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.washington.edu/news/articles/filming-of-movie-24-and-over-continues-on-uw-campus Filming of movie '21 & Over' continues on UW campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229102227/http://www.washington.edu/news/articles/filming-of-movie-24-and-over-continues-on-uw-campus |date=2011-12-29 }}</ref> Key scenes were filmed in Lewis Hall, the University of Washington Medical Center, University Way NE, locally known as [[The Ave]], the Greek fraternities and sororities on 17th Ave NE, the UW's Husky Stadium area, and the UW's Quad and Red Square.
