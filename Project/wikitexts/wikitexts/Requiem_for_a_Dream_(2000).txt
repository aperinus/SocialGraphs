It is based on the 1978 [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] and how it alters their physical and emotional states. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates, and their reality is overtaken by delusion, resulting in a catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic about the story and developed the script with Selby, despite initial struggles to obtain funding for the film's production. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoidance of reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a positive response from critics despite moderate success at the box office. The film's visual style, direction, screenplay,\u00a0editing, musical score, cast, and themes were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three deal heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks an escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive [[Very-low-calorie diet|crash diet]] in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.\n\nAt the advice of her friend Rae, Sara visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs of her drug abuse and implores her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends Ada and Rae are her remaining reasons to live. As time passes Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]].\n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between drug traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]] and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their saved money to post [[bail]]. As a result of the gang warfare, the local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to [[New York (state)|New York]] from [[Florida]], but the price has doubled and the minimum purchase risk is high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal symptoms]], strains their relationship.\n\nSara's increased dosage of amphetamines distorts her sense of reality, and she begins to hallucinate that she is mocked by the host and crowd from the television show, and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to various medications. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. After the heroin shipment descends into a melee, Harry and Tyrone travel to [[Miami]] to buy heroin directly from the wholesaler. However, Harry's arm has become [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] from heroin use, so the two stop at a hospital. The doctor realizes that Harry is a drug addict and calls the police, resulting in Harry and Tyrone being arrested.\n\nBack in [[New York City]], a desperate Marion prostitutes herself to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim. She is forced to perform demeaning sexual acts for a crowd of paying customers. Sara's treatment leaves her in a [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociated]] [[catatonia|catatonic]] near-[[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]], to the horror of her friends Ada and Rae, who weep and try to comfort each other on a park bench outside the hospital. Harry's arm is amputated above the elbow, and he breaks down in tears after he realizes Marion will not visit him. Tyrone is subjected to grueling labor and racial abuse from the prison guards, all while experiencing a painful [[Opioid withdrawal|heroin withdrawal]]. Marion returns home and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Each of the four characters curls into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful game show winner, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.
