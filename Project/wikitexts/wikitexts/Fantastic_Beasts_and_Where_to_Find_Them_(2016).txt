He observes Mary Lou Barebone, the non-magical (\"No-Maj\" or \"[[Muggle]]\") head of the New Salem Philanthropic Society, preaching that witches and wizards are real and dangerous. Attempting to recapture a [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Creatures|Niffler]] that escaped from his suitcase of magical creatures, Newt meets No-Maj Jacob Kowalski, an aspiring baker, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Porpentina \"Tina\" Goldstein, a demoted [[Auror]] of the Magical Congress of the United States ([[MACUSA]]), arrests Newt for breaking magical law. Since the suitcase in his possession only contains Jacob's baked goods, Newt is released. At home, Jacob opens Newt's suitcase, inadvertently freeing several creatures into the city.\n\nAfter Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her [[Magic in Harry Potter#Legilimency and Occlumency|Legilimens]] sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to have any contact with No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his suitcase, magically expanded to house various creatures including an [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Obscurials/Obscurus|Obscurial]], a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children when their abilities are suppressed; those afflicted rarely live past the age of ten.\n\nAfter they recapture two of the three escaped beasts, Tina returns the suitcase to MACUSA, but they are arrested, as officials believe one of Newt's creatures is responsible for killing [[United States Senate|Senator]] Henry Shaw Jr., who was actually attacked by a different Obscurial. The Director of Magical Security, Percival Graves, accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Arts|dark wizard]] [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Gellert Grindelwald|Gellert Grindelwald]], and decides to destroy Newt's suitcase and [[Magic in Harry Potter#Spellcasting|obliviate]] Jacob's recent memories. Newt and Tina are sentenced to death. Queenie senses this, rescues Jacob before his memory can be wiped, then helps Newt and Tina escape and retrieve Newt's suitcase. A tip from Tina's [[goblin]] informant Gnarlak leads the four to recapture the last of the escaped creatures.\n\nGraves approaches Credence, Mary Lou's adult adopted son, and offers to free him from his abusive mother in exchange for helping to find the Obscurial causing destruction throughout the city. Credence finds a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Wand|wand]] under his adopted sister Modesty's bed, which Mary Lou assumes is his; when Credence is about to be punished, the Obscurial kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves, assuming Modesty is the Obscurus' host, dismisses Credence as a [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Squibs|Squib]] and refuses to teach him magic as he had promised in return for service. Credence reveals he is the real host, having survived due to the intensity of his magic, and attacks the city in broad daylight.\n\nNewt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel, but is attacked by Graves. Tina, who had tried to protect Credence from Mary Lou (leading to her demotion), attempts to calm the boy, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence returns to human form, MACUSA President Seraphina Picquery and the Aurors counterattack, shattering the Obscurial. However, unseen by anyone but Newt, a single wisp of the creature flees the scene. Graves admits he had planned to unleash the Obscurial to expose the magical community to the No-Majs and to frame Newt for the incident. He claims MACUSA's laws openly protect No-Majs at the expense of the magical community, and he no longer cares to live in hiding. Picquery orders the Aurors to apprehend Graves, but he defeats them. Newt captures him with the help of one of his beasts and reveals that Graves is Grindelwald in disguise, although it is unknown if the real Graves is still alive or not.\n\nMACUSA fears their secret world has been exposed, but Newt releases his [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]] to disperse a potion that obliviates recent memories over the city as rainfall, while MACUSA wizards repair the destruction and erase the recent events from the news. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories, and Newt returns to England. Jacob opens a bakery with pastries resembling Newt's beasts, and, when Queenie enters, he smiles at her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{further|List of Fantastic Beasts cast members|List of Fantastic Beasts characters}}\n[[File:Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them Cast (Cropped).jpg|thumb|right|400px| ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' panel at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic Con International]] (left to right): director Yates; actors Redmayne, Waterston, Sudol, Fogler, Farrell, Miller.]]\n* [[Eddie Redmayne]] as [[Newt Scamander]],<ref name=\"RedmayneCast\" /> an introverted British wizard, magizoologist and an employee of the [[Ministry of Magic]].
