The film was directed by [[Robert Stevenson (director)|Robert Stevenson]] from a screenplay by Lowell S. Hawley freely based upon [[Jules Verne]]'s 1868 adventure novel ''[[In Search of the Castaways|Captain Grant's Children]]''.<ref>IN SEARCH OF THE CASTAWAYS\nMonthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 29, Iss. 336, (Jan 1, 1962): 171.</ref>\n\n''In Search of the Castaways'' was the third of Hayley Mills' six for the Disney Studios.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Britain in 1858, Professor Paganel ([[Maurice Chevalier]]), a scientifically-thinking French geography professor, finds a bottle containing a note which he believes to have been written by the missing Captain John Grant ([[Jack Gwillim]]). Paganel and Grant's two teenaged children, Mary ([[Hayley Mills]]) and Robert (Keith Hamshere), approach John Glenarvan ([[Michael Anderson, Jr.]]) and his father, the wealthy shipping magnate Lord Glenarvan ([[Wilfrid Hyde-White]]), the owner of Captain Grant's ship, and persuade them to finance a search expedition. The expedition sets sail and ventures halfway around the world to South America.\n\nIn the Andes, an earthquake sends them down a mountain on a glacier. A giant [[condor]] snatches up Robert but Thalcave ([[Antonio Cifariello]]), an Indian chief, rescues him. He later claims to know the whereabouts of Captain Grant. After surviving a tidal wave and a lightning storm, the group discovers that the well-meaning Thalcave was mistaken. Meanwhile, a budding romance develops between young Mary Grant and Lord Glenarvan's son John.\n\nThey then depart for Australia, where Paganel feels sure they will find Captain Grant. In Melbourne they meet a treacherous gunrunner, Thomas Ayerton ([[George Sanders]]), who produces evidence that Captain Grant is in New Zealand. Unaware that Ayerton is the third mate who caused a mutiny on Grant's ship, the search party once more sets sail. Ayerton causes another mutiny and sets the group adrift. They are captured by Maori cannibals, and are imprisoned along with Captain Grant\u2019s shipmate, Bill Gaye ([[Wilfrid Brambell]]), who helps them escape to a volcano. They evade their pursuers by starting an avalanche which triggers an eruption.\n\nThey finally find Captain Grant, overcome Ayerton and his mutineers, and sail for home. As they all sit around talking, the note that Professor Paganel initially found (and that was supposedly in Captain Grant\u2019s handwriting) is brought up. Captain Grant states that he never wrote any note, to which Bill says: \"The voice be the voice of a God-fearing man. But the hands are the hands of a forger\", implying that he imitated Captain Grant\u2019s handwriting and wrote the note himself. In the final scene, the Professor points out John and Mary stargazing out at the railing, clearly falling for one another.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Maurice Chevalier]] as [[Jacques Paganel]]\n* [[Hayley Mills]] as Mary Grant\n* [[George Sanders]] as [[Tom Ayrton|Thomas Ayerton]]\n* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] as [[Lord Glenarvan]]\n* [[Michael Anderson, Jr.|Michael Anderson]] as John Glenarvan\n* Keith Hamshere as Robert Grant\n* [[Antonio Cifariello]] as Thalcave, the Indian Chief\n* [[Wilfrid Brambell]] as Bill Gaye\n* [[Jack Gwillim]] as Captain Grant\n* [[Inia Te Wiata]] as Maori Chief\n* [[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]] as Guard at Dockyard Gate\n* [[Norman Bird]] as Senior Yacht Guard\n* [[George Murcell]] as Ayerton's Assistant\n* [[Mark Dignam]] as Rich Man at Yacht Party\n* Michael Wynne as Crooked Sailor\n* David Spenser as South American Guide\n* [[Milo Sperber]] as Crooked Sailor\n* [[Roger Delgado]] as Patagonian Prisoner\n* Barry Keegan as Irish Claimant \n* [[Maxwell Shaw]] as Sailor\n* [[Andreas Malandrinos]] as Crooked Sailor\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally called ''The Castaways''. It was devised by Disney specifically as a vehicle for Hayley Mills, who was under contract to the studio to make a film a year for five years. Disney wanted to age her gradually on screen and she would have her first case of \"puppy love\" in the film.<ref>A Legendary Tale Spinner Looks Ahead--British TV Adjusts a Balance: Disney Boosting Live-Action Films, John C.

In January 1962, he was diagnosed with the cancer which caused his death in December.<ref>Actor Charles Laughton Dies of Cancer at 63, Los Angeles Times 16 Dec 1962:D1.</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography was at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England. Disney said this was done because Mills' contract \"calls for alternating her pictures here and there each year\".<ref>DISNEY MAPS NEW FRONTIER, Williams, Dick. Los Angeles Times 10 Dec 1961:Q5</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\nSongs composed by the [[Sherman Brothers]] include \"Castaway\", \"Merci Beaucoup\", \"Let's Climb (Grimpons)\", and \"Enjoy It\", with an orchestral arrangement of \"Castaway\" serving as the film's overture.\n\n[[Maurice Chevalier]] later sang the [[Sherman Brothers]]' theme song 'The Aristocats' from Disney's 1970 animated film ''[[The Aristocats]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''In Search of the Castaways'' was a commercial success. Upon its initial release, it earned $4.9 million in North American theatrical rentals.<ref>\"All-time top film grossers\", ''Variety'' 8 January 1964 p 37.</ref> It was one of the 12 most popular movies at the British box office in 1963.<ref>\"Most Popular Films Of 1963.\" Times [London, England] 3 Jan. 1964: 4. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.</ref>\n\n===Critical===\n''[[The New York Times]]'' declared: \"It is, as we say, a whopping fable, more gimmicky than imaginative, but it doesn't lack for lively melodrama that is more innocent and wholesome than much of the stuff the children see these days on television\".<ref>\"Wild and Woolly Disney Version of Verne Fable\". ''[[The New York Times]]''. December 22, 1962. 5.</ref>\n\nA review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said: \"Walt Disney has come up with another splendid piece of spectacular hokum, lavishly-coloured and packed with incident and special effects. It can hardly fail to appeal to all types of audience, though apparently aimed mainly at the moppets\".<ref>\"Film Reviews: In Search Of The Castaways\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. November 21, 1962. 6.</ref>\n\n''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote: \"Well-timed for Christmas, this film is designed to keep the family wide awake after the plum-pudding, when the critical faculties are not too sharp. Attention is discreetly drawn away from the rather cardboard characters, and the [[Little Lord Fauntleroy|Fauntleroy]] smile of Michael Anderson, by a kaleidoscope of colour and movement\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 1962 |title=In Search of the Castaways |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=29 |issue=347 |page=124 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1962]]\n*[[List of films set in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/in-search-of-the-castaways}}\n* {{IMDb title|0056095|In Search of the Castaways}}\n* {{tcmdb title|79117|In Search of the Castaways}}\n* {{amg title|24579|In Search of the Castaways}}\n\n{{In Search of the Castaways}}\n{{Robert Stevenson}}\n\n[[Category:1962 films]]\n[[Category:1962 adventure films]]\n[[Category:1960s children's films]]\n[[Category:1960s children's adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1960s musical films]]\n[[Category:Films about castaways]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on children's books]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Jules Verne]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Robert Stevenson]]\n[[Category:Films set in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Films set in South America]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Films set in Australia]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1850s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1858]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Seafaring films]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Walt Disney]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
