A sequel to 1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and loosely based on [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1995 novel ''[[The Lost World (Crichton novel)|The Lost World]]'', the film was directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] from a screenplay by [[David Koepp]]. The film stars [[Jeff Goldblum]], returning as the eccentric [[chaos theory|chaos theorist]] and mathematician [[Ian Malcolm (character)|Ian Malcolm]], as well as [[Julianne Moore]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], [[Arliss Howard]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and [[Vanessa Lee Chester]]. Four years after the original film, [[John Hammond (Jurassic Park character)|John Hammond]] ([[Richard Attenborough]]) sends a team, led by Malcolm, to Isla Sorna, the second island Hammond's company InGen used to make the dinosaurs, to study the animals while coming into conflict with a team led by InGen to bring some of the dinosaurs back to the United States.\n\nAfter the [[Jurassic Park (novel)|original novel]]'s release and the first film's success, fans pressured Crichton for a sequel. Following the book's publication in 1995, production began on a film sequel. Filming took place from September to December 1996, primarily in California, with a shoot in [[Kauai]], Hawaii, where the first film was shot. ''The Lost World''{{'}}s plot and imagery is substantially darker than ''Jurassic Park''. It makes more extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]] to depict the dinosaurs, along with life-sized [[animatronics]].\n\nAs the sequel to the then highest-grossing film of all time, ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' was among the most anticipated films of 1997. It was accompanied by a $250 million marketing campaign which included [[Jurassic Park video games#The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)|video games]], comic books, and toys. Upon its release on May 23, 1997, the film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the visual effects but criticized the character development. It earned an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], losing to ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. The film grossed $618&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming the [[1997 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 1997]] behind ''Titanic''.\n\nAlthough it broke several box-office records in its opening weekend, ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' failed to replicate the cultural impact and following of ''Jurassic Park''. Retrospective reviews have been mixed, with some viewing the film as an inferior follow-up to ''Jurassic Park''. Spielberg also expressed disappointment with the film, stating he had become increasingly disenchanted with it during production. A sequel, ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'', was released on July 18, 2001.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTE: Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words. -->\nFour years after the events on [[Isla Nublar]], a wealthy family docks their yacht ashore the nearby [[Isla Sorna]]. Their daughter wanders off and is attacked by a group of ''[[Compsognathus]]'', but is saved. An ailing [[Dr. John Hammond]] invites mathematician [[Dr. Ian Malcolm]] to discuss the incident. [[InGen]] is now headed by Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow, who used the incident to take control of the company from Hammond. Ian learns that InGen had created the Jurassic Park dinosaurs on Isla Sorna, and Ludlow wants to exploit the island's creatures to save InGen from bankruptcy. Hammond asks Ian to join a team who will document the dinosaurs in their natural habitat, to encourage a policy of non-interference. Ian's girlfriend, [[paleontologist]] [[Dr. Sarah Harding]], was hired and is already on the island. Ian reluctantly agrees to go, but only to retrieve her.\n\nIan travels to Isla Sorna with [[Eddie Carr (Jurassic Park)|Eddie Carr]], an equipment specialist and engineer, and [[Nick Van Owen]], a video documentarian and activist. They find Sarah amidst a herd of ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', but she insists on staying to continue her research. Ian is shocked when he discovers his daughter Kelly has stowed away in a trailer, which serves as their mobile base. Ludlow and a mercenary team arrive on the island and capture dinosaurs, with help from [[Big-game hunting|big-game hunter]]s Roland Tembo and Ajay Sidhu, Roland's second-in-command Dieter Stark, and paleontologist Dr. Robert Burke. Malcolm's group realizes Ludlow and the InGen team plan to ship the captured specimens to a proposed Jurassic Park attraction in [[San Diego]]. Nick and Sarah free the captured dinosaurs, and the animals wreak havoc on the InGen team's camp. On the way back to the trailer, Nick rescues an injured ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' infant that Roland used as bait to hunt its father. Nick and Sarah treat the infant's broken leg, but the ''Tyrannosaurus'' adults arrive. They reclaim their infant, destroy the trailer, and devour Eddie during his attempt to rescue the group.\n\nIan, Sarah, Nick, and Kelly are rescued by Ludlow's team, and are forced to work together after losing all their communications equipment. They elect to walk ''[[en masse]]'' inland to an abandoned InGen base to call for help. During a break, Stark goes into the wilderness alone to relieve himself and is killed by a group of ''Compsognathus''. After the team sets up a camp for the night, they are ambushed by the ''Tyrannosaurus'' adults: Burke is devoured, and everyone else flees into a field of long grass containing a pack of ''[[Velociraptors]]'', which kill Ajay and most of the InGen team. Ian, Sarah, Kelly, and Nick reach the InGen base, fight off three ''Velociraptors'', and successfully radio for helicopter extraction. After being rescued, Nick reveals that he stole Roland's ammunition to prevent him from killing his trophy, but they learn Roland sedated the male ''Tyrannosaurus'' with tranquilizers instead. As InGen personnel arrive on the island to secure the male and infant, Roland declines Ludlow's job offer at the San Diego park, reflecting on Ajay's death and the morality of Ludlow's scheme.\n\nIn San Diego, Ian and Sarah attempt to convince Ludlow to abandon his plans, but the ship carrying the male ''Tyrannosaurus'' suddenly crashes into the docks. The crew is found dead, and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' breaks free and goes on a rampage through the city. Ian and Sarah locate the infant at the planned park and use it to lure the male back to the docks. Ludlow pursues the animals onto the ship, and tries to catch them within the cargo hold, but he is injured by the adult before being mauled to death by the infant. Sarah uses a tranquilizer gun to sedate the male, while Ian seals the cargo hold doors. In the aftermath, the dinosaurs are shipped back to Isla Sorna accompanied by a naval escort, while Ian, Sarah and Kelly watch Hammond in a televised interview announce that the American and Costa Rican governments have declared the island a [[Nature reserve|nature preserve]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Jurassic Park characters}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as [[Dr. Ian Malcolm]]: A [[mathematician]] and [[Chaos theory|chaos theorist]].\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as [[Dr. Sarah Harding]]: Malcolm's girlfriend and a behavioral paleontologist.\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as [[Roland Tembo]]: A big-game hunter who adheres to his own strict moral code.\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Peter Ludlow|Peter Ludlow]]: Hammond's nephew who has been appointed CEO of [[InGen]].\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as [[Dr. John Hammond]]: The former CEO of InGen who takes steps to redeem himself and preserve Isla Sorna.\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as [[Nick Van Owen]]: An experienced documentarian, photojournalist and environmentalist.\n* [[Vanessa Lee Chester]] as [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Kelly Curtis|Kelly Curtis]]: Malcolm's daughter who stows away in the support trailer to be with him.\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as [[Dieter Stark]]: The second-in-command of the InGen group under the control of Roland Tembo.\n* [[Harvey Jason]] as [[Ajay Sidhu]]: Roland Tembo's best friend and hunting partner.\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as [[Eddie Carr (Jurassic Park)|Eddie Carr]]: A field equipment expert.\n* [[Thomas F.

Arby is a black character, and black actress [[Vanessa Lee Chester]] was chosen to play Kelly in the film. Initially, Kelly was to be a student of Ian Malcolm's, although Koepp had difficulty making this idea work, saying that Malcolm \"would never teach grade school, so I thought maybe he was tutoring her. ''Why''? Maybe he got a drunk driving ticket, and he had to do community service, so he's tutoring at this inner-city high school\". Koepp scrapped this idea because of its similarity to the 1995 film ''[[Dangerous Minds]]''. Because the film would deal with dinosaur nurturing, Koepp realized that the parenting element should also extend to the human characters. Spielberg approved Koepp's idea to have Kelly as Malcolm's daughter, although they initially were unsure about a black actress playing the daughter of a white parent. Spielberg has two adopted black children, and he and Koepp soon decided to retain the idea. Koepp wanted to write an explanation into the script about the discrepancy in skin color, but he dropped this idea as he could not think of a way to address it in a simple manner.<ref name=Starlog/>\n\nKoepp referred to Crichton's original ''Jurassic Park'' novel for some scenes that would be added into the film adaptation of ''The Lost World''.<ref name=Making/> Dieter's death scene was inspired by John Hammond's death in the first novel, where ''[[Procompsognathus]]'' kill him.<ref name=Bustle/><ref name=AV/> The film's opening scene came from an early chapter in the first novel that was not used in the film adaptation, where a ''Procompsognathus'' bites a girl on a beach.<ref name=AV/><ref name=Silliman/> The first novel also included a scene where characters hide behind a waterfall from a ''T. rex''; this scene was not used in the first film but was added into ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'', for the scene in which the ''T. rex'' eats Burke.<ref name=AV>{{cite web|last=Vlastelica|first=Ryan|title=In Jurassic Park, Spielberg made a family favorite from an adult book|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jurassic-park-spielberg-made-family-favorite-adult-219492|website=A.V.

An exception was a handful of ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'' shots.<ref name=Making/>\n\nSpielberg followed Horner's advice to help keep the dinosaurs scientifically accurate for the most part, with some exceptions. The Winston design team closely modelled the dinosaurs based on paleontological facts, or theories in certain cases where facts were not definitively known. In addition to animatronics, Winston's team also painted maquettes of dinosaurs that would subsequently be created through CGI.<ref name=Making/> ILM animators went to [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]], then known as [[Marine World/Africa USA]] to videotape elephants, reptiles, and rhinos, to determine how to make the dinosaurs appear more like living animals.<ref name=Interviews/> Although technology had not advanced much since the release of the first film, Spielberg noted that \"the artistry of the creative computer people\" had advanced: \"There's better detail, much better lighting, better muscle tone and movement in the animals.

Their small size meant the Compys had their whole body visible and thus needed a higher sense of gravity and weight.

Winston's team was to create a puppet version of the animal for this scene, but ILM ultimately created the animal through CGI instead, basing the design off of a miniature sculpture that Winston's team had created. In addition, an earlier opening scene that was scrapped would have featured a Japanese [[fishing trawler]] acquiring a partially decomposed ''Parasaurolophus'' in its net, which would break from the weight, allowing the body to sink back into the ocean.
