Shurik, who is riding on the same bus, puts on a pair of sunglasses, and pretends to be [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]]. When Fedya is urged to let him sit in his seat, Shurik offers the seat to the pregnant woman. Fedya is enraged at being deceived and gets into a fight with Shurik. As a result, Fedya is arrested and sentenced to 15 days of [[Community service#Court ordered service|community service]], Russian administrative arrest or simply '15 sutok' (15 days). Ironically, he is sent to serve his term to the same construction site where Shurik works part-time. The manager puts them on the same work crew. Fedya does not do his work properly, bullies Shurik, and plans to get revenge on the young student. When Shurik finally hits back, the two get involved in a ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''-style chase throughout the construction site using building equipment and various materials as weapons. In the end Fedya is subdued and reeducated by Shurik.\n\n===Segment \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\"===\n\nIt's time for summer [[Test (assessment)|examinations]] at the University, and everyone is cramming for the exams. Shurik (and everyone else) is looking desperately for lecture notes and finally sees them in the hands of a girl on a [[Tram|streetcar]], Lida, who is a student of the same university. As Shurik follows her reading the notebook over her shoulder, they become so deeply absorbed in reading the notes that Lida never looks up, instinctively assuming that Shurik is one of her female coeds. The two are completely engrossed in reading and never look at or speak to each other, following a sort of humorous pantomime.\n\nThey come into the girl's apartment and spend time there reading simultaneously with having a snack and resting, with the girl undressing, still completely unaware of each other's identity, then prepare to go back to the University. There Shurik is distracted from Lida's notebook by a fellow student and loses her as she walks in another direction. After passing the exam successfully, he is introduced to Lida by a mutual friend. Shurik does not recognize Lida but is enchanted by her. He walks her back home and, following an amusing incident involving a dog belonging to Lida's neighbors, finds himself in her apartment again, where he starts to feel [[D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu|as if he has been there before]] since he can guess where all the things are placed and all the \"objects, scents and sounds\"<!-- it's a quote (Shurik) --> seem familiar to him. Lida assumes that he might be a [[telepathy|telepathist]] and has an ability of [[precognition]]. She tells him to guess her wish that she has written on a piece of paper, \"Find the [[teddy bear]]\". Shurik then kisses her. Although he failed to guess the wish, the kiss evokes romantic feelings in both of them, and they decide to meet again after the next exam.\n\nMeanwhile, another student tries to cheat his way through his Physics exam by using a concealed radio to communicate with another student, but has to dress up to an absurd degree to hide his crude equipment and attracts the examiner's attention by using radio jargon, but he seems to get away with it. However, the examiner promptly reveals a proper [[Signals intelligence|radio intercept]] suite in his bag, listens to the cheater calling him a fool, and then activates a [[Radio jamming|radio jammer]] before approaching the offender and blowing his cover. They both laugh at the disguise, and the student gets 5 (excellent) for his design (it is an engineering college) and a 1 (complete fail) for the exam.\n\n===Segment \"Operation Y\"===\n[[File:Arkhangelskoye Vadim Zadorozhnys Vehicle Museum S-3A IMG 9619 2150.jpg|thumb|Fool and Pro near their S-3A.

Their elaborate plan goes wrong when Shurik is asked by his landlady, an elderly woman who usually guards the warehouse, to babysit her granddaughter during her shift, and once that proves to be too much for him, to replace her while she takes care of the child. Surprised, Coward fails to neutralize the guard using a handkerchief soaked in [[chloroform]] as planned, putting himself to sleep instead. The culmination of the story is the \"Warehouse Battle\", involving Shurik and the criminals using various impromptu weapons such as [[musical instrument]]s and [[rapier]]s. Finally, an agitated woman arrives at the warehouse and finds Shurik and the trio lying on a floor asleep \u2014 Coward having fainted earlier on, Fool and Pro having been \"rendered harmless\" by Shurik, and Shurik himself having fallen asleep after accidentally wiping his face with the chloroform soaked handkerchief. At the end of the segment, Shurik and the woman take the criminals to the police station.\n\n==Production==\n* The film was shot in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], [[Odessa]], [[Yalta]], [[Mosfilm]] pavilions, Sviblovo district of Moscow and near the [[Moscow State University]]. The filming was started on 27 July 1964. In October bad weather in Moscow hindered the completion of the outdoor scenes, so the shooting was relocated to Odessa and was complete on 22 November. The rest of the scenes were shot in Moscow and Leningrad. The lack of snow offered much difficulty filming the third episode about the burglary of a warehouse on a snowy winter night. In spring 1965 the editing of the film was mostly complete. The remaining short location shooting was made in Yalta.<ref name=\"vm1\">{{cite news|title=\"Simply Shurik\".

A character of a \"good guy\" was popular in the Soviet art of that time, so Gaidai decided to follow this tendency shooting his next film. The story line was modified and the additional novel was written.<ref name=\"vm1\"/>\n* More than one hundred actors took a screen test for the role of the student Vladik, but Gaidai was not satisfied with any of them. He had his own personality in mind as a [[prototype]] of the character, so when he first saw a photo of Aleksandr Demyanenko and then met him in person, he noticed the likeness to himself in the actor, and believed that the humble Demyanenko in glasses would be able to portray the awkward, naive and honest student.<ref name=\"vm1\"/>\n*Before the shooting it was decided to dye Aleksandr's hair from brown to blond. Years later, his wife Lyudmila Akimovna recalled: \"He was dyed mercilessly, until blisters appeared on his skin. The dyes were terrible back then. It is a good thing that Sasha's hair was so thick that despite all the experiments he did not go bald.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spb.aif.ru/culture/person/vlip_ochkarik_pyat_yarkih_roley_aleksandra_demyanenko|publisher=[[Argumenty i Fakty]]|title=\"\u0412\u043b\u0438\u043f, \u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\"! \u041f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u0414\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e}}</ref>\n* Initially the name of the main character was Vladik (short for ''Vladislav''). Later the director, impressed by Demyanenko, decided to name the character after the actor (Shurik, as well as Sasha, is a short form of the name Aleksandr).<ref name=\"vm1\"/>\n* Among those who took part in the audition for the main role was actor Valery Nosik. Eventually he appeared in the film as a student-gambler. Mikhail Pugovkin, who played the role of the construction site manager, was initially cast for the role of Fedya.\n* At the session of the Art Council after the preliminary watching of the film, the critics panned the acting of Morgunov and Vitsin, while praising Nikulin, and were insisting on deleting scenes where Alexei Smirnov appears in [[blackface]].
