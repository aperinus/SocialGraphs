Wil is a lesbian but is [[closeted]] to her mother Gao and her mother's friends. Wil is forced by her mother to come to a gathering at the restaurant Planet China with family friends where her mother has plans to set her up with a son of a friend, but Wil is drawn to Vivian,  the daughter of one of the Chinese mothers who recently got a divorce. They run into each other at the hospital where Wil works, only to discover that Vivian's father is Wil's boss, Dr. Shing. Vivian and her father have a tense relationship since Vivian is currently pursuing her love of modern dance instead of the more respectable ballet.\n\nWil comes home to discover her mother has been kicked out by her grandfather for being pregnant out of [[Marriage|wedlock]], bringing shame to the family. Wil asks for the identity of the father, but Gao refuses to answer. From then on, Gao lives with Wil.\n\nVivian invites Wil to one of her dance shows and after the show, the two hang out. Vivian reveals the fact that they had met once before when they were children; Vivian kissed Wil on the nose after Wil rescued her from bullies; Wil ran away afterward. Vivian and Wil go to Vivian's apartment and the two kiss. The couple goes on several dates, but Wil is afraid of kissing Vivian in public. At Vivian's request, Wil presents Vivian to her mother as a friend so that they can meet and the three share an awkward dinner. It is revealed later that her mother knows of her homosexuality, but is in denial.\n\nSet up by Wil, Gao goes on several dates to find a man to be a father to her unborn child, but remains unattached. She debates on whether to accept the affections of Cho, a man who has loved her for 15 years and is willing to parent her child.\n\nVivian reveals to Wil that she was accepted into a prestigious ballet program in Paris and is considering the offer. Wil congratulates Vivian and gives her encouragement to accept the offer. While Vivian still debates on the offer, Vivian's father speaks to Wil and presses her to convince Vivian to accept the offer. Wil withdraws from Vivian, and Vivian accepts the job in Paris.\n\nAfter Wil\u2019s grandmother passes away unexpectedly, Gao accepts Cho's marriage proposal. At the wedding, Wil interrupts with a love note from the father of the child saying how much he loves her and wants to marry her despite their age gap. Wil points out the elderly pharmacist, Old Yu, as the man she loves. Old Yu protests, and Little Yu, his son, stands up and announces that he is the one. Wil and her mother run out of the wedding and onto a bus, laughing. After an emotional talk with her mother, Wil rushes to the airport to catch Vivian. Wil apologizes, but Vivian challenges Wil to kiss her to prove her sincerity. Unable to publicly display her love out of fear, Wil is left at the terminal as Vivian leaves for Paris.\n\nThree months later, Wil goes to another party at Planet China, where Gao and Little Yu are now a couple. Wil sees Vivian, who has come to see her mother. Wil approaches Vivian and asks her to dance.  They dance and kiss. Gao and Vivian's mother smile at each other while giving a thumbs up. Some people leave in disgust, but Wil and Vivian ignore them, while everyone else joins in to dance.\n\nIn between credits, Gao has Wil and Vivian, family and friends over at her apartment for a function. Gao asks Wil about having babies, to which she reacts with a [[Spit-take|spit take]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michelle Krusiec]] as Wilhelmina Pang\n* [[Lynn Chen]] as Vivian Shing\n* [[Joan Chen]] as Hwei-lang Gao (Mother/Ma)\n* Jin Wang as Wai Gung (Grandfather)\n* Guang Lan Koh as Wai Po (Grandmother)\n* [[Jessica Hecht]] as Randi\n* [[Ato Essandoh]] as Jay\n* [[Wang Luoyong]] as Dr. Shing\n* David Shih as Norman\n* [[Brian Yang (producer)|Brian Yang]] as Yu\n* Nathaniel Geng as Stimson Cho\n* Mao Zhao as Old Yu\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[Alice Wu]], who directed the movie, wrote the script several years earlier while working as a program manager at Cinemania and Music Central, [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[CD-ROM]] entertainment department.

By falling in love with Wil and wanting her to be open about their relationship, Vivian gave her the confidence to come out to her mother and her community.<ref name=\":9\" /> Eventually, Wil is able to come out which allows for her to start living her life as her true life which also inspires her to stop her mother's unwanted wedding, giving her the same gift of freedom.\n\nMa's character starts as being dependent, not open about her feelings and willing to marry a man only to restore her father's honour. After being banished from Flushing for her scandalous pregnancy, she is able to deepen her relationship with Wil while simultaneously becoming more independent and in tune with her own feelings.<ref name=\":9\" /> Furthermore, the film briefly addresses the issue of [[Racism|anti-Black racism]] in Asian communities when Ma insisted that Jay, Wil's [[African Americans|African American]] neighbour use paper plates because it is \"safer.\" However, as the movie progresses, Ma becomes close friends with Jay, demonstrating her ability to change her traditional views.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nThe evolution of the importance of saving face is also intertwined with the character development of Wil and Ma since as they become more empowered and [[Sexual liberation|sexually liberated]], they begin to care less about saving face, implying the possibility of change in traditional Chinese family ethics.<ref name=\":8\" /> The ending scene of the movie included Ma, Wil, and Vivian as a way to indicate Wil's development where all aspects of her life have now become interconnected.<ref name=\":9\" /> The end is also a result of the relationships between these three women, further demonstrating the importance of their relationships in achieving \"personhood and\u2026empowerment\u2026The progressive liberating process of coming out of the closet embraced by Ma and Wil in the end also invokes cultural change in the Chinese American community.\"<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n=== The concept of face ===\nLike the title suggests, one of ''Saving Face''\u2019s major themes is the concept of face, a value central to many Chinese families where family members are \u201cexpected to perform his or her role properly to maintain the family reputation \u2026and [is] strongly monitored by the community.\u201d<ref name=\":8\" /> The very first scene in the film, Wil is wearing a face mask, indicating that she is hiding and not being her true self. When Ma shows up to Wil's apartment with her face covered by sunglasses, it is a physical manifestation of her father and her own loss of face since she has been banished from Flushing for being pregnant [[Wedlocks|outside of wedlock]].<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nThe concept of face is especially clear during the climactic scene of the film: when Wil comes out to her mother by saying \u201cI love you\u2026and I\u2019m\u2026gay\u201d. When Ma responds by saying \u201cHow can you say you love me, and throw that in my face?\u201d, face has a double meaning. Wil's mother sees the impossibility of accepting her daughter's sexuality because she believes it is based on a \u201cbad ideology\u201d<ref name=\":8\" /> on top of it negatively affecting her reputation (face).<ref name=\":9\" /> In this way, the closet serves as a way to reinforce the concept of face because it is used to hide Wil's sexuality and in the same vein, Ma's pregnancy. Consequently, both characters perform normative forms of heterosexuality in order to hide these realities that are perceived as shameful by their community.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last1=Ledru|first1=Juliette|title=Chinese Cinemas: International perspectives|last2=Chan|first2=Felicia|last3=Willis|first3=Andy|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|location=London|pages=96\u2013106|chapter=Blurred lines?: The dialectics of the margins and the mainstream in The Wedding Banquet (Ang Lee, 1993) and Saving Face (Alice Wu, 2004)|doi=10.4324/9781315691893-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereotypical representation ===\nThis film has also been interpreted as an example of the blurring between mainstream and marginal representations of Chinese Americans in film. Wu uses [[stereotype]]s to establish a \u201cChinese authenticity\u201d for the characters while also subverting others in important ways. As an intelligent surgeon, Wil is an example of the [[model minority]] while her mother is \u201cgerm-obsessed\u2026and [a] meddling matchmaker\u201d. Elders are generally shown to be maintainers of tradition who pressure their children to integrate. For instance, Wil's grandfather practices ''tai chi'' while Old Yu tells fortunes.<ref name=\":10\" /> ''Saving Face'' references mainstream Chinese American movies such as ''[[The Joy Luck Club (film)|The Joy Luck Club]], [[The Last Emperor]],'' and ''[[Maid in Manhattan]]'' in the scene when Ma goes to the video store. There, she examines [[Pornography|porn]] movies that stereotype Asian women as docile, the \u201cChina Doll\u201d and \u201cDragon lady\u201d who are all sexual objects for the Western white [[male gaze]]. By combining these stereotypes with ironic comments, consumption of porn meant for men, a homosexual storyline and characters, Wu questions these stereotypes.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== The fluidity of identity and tradition ===\n\n==== ''Complex identities'' ====\n''Saving Face'' explores the experiences of being [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] within an ethnic community<ref name=\":10\" /> and addressing \u201cthe multiple layers of minority status by examining intersections of gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation\u201d.<ref name=\":9\" /> The complexities and contradictions of these experiences are displayed using the changing identities of Wil and her mother as well as their defiance of [[Social norm|norms]].<ref name=\":9\" /> Throughout most of the film, Wil's mother is both constrained by traditional Chinese values and the enforcer of these values. She decides to marry a man that she does not love in order to please her father and regain her family's honour while also setting Wil up with men even though she already knew that she was interested in women.<ref name=\":8\" /> Moreover, Ma's character defies norms despite this emphasis on [[filial piety]]: she is autonomous as she is pregnant, explores the city alone, and rents a porn DVD. These contradictions demonstrate Ma's flexibility, negotiation, and [[Social constructionism|social construction]] of her values.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== ''Incompatibility of [[homosexuality]] and traditional Chinese values'' ====\nThis film's dealing with the topic of the incompatibility of homosexuality with Chinese traditions and its evolution throughout demonstrate the fluidity of these traditions in accommodating new realities. Homosexuality is seen as a threat in traditional Chinese families because they threaten \u201c[[filial piety]], family continuity and family reputation\u201d and is seen as linked to failed education and [[Americanization]].<ref name=\":8\" /> The [[heteronormativity]] of the Chinese Flushing community is first displayed during the first dance hall scene when the shots alternate between those of men and women. These shots represent accepted [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] binary that places men and women on opposite sides.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nWil's mother's refusal to accept Wil's [[lesbian]]ism despite having walked in on her with a woman demonstrates this incompatibility as she continues to set Wil up with men.<ref name=\":9\" /> The incompatibility of gay and Asian identities was also exemplified in Wil's coming out scene when Ma says \u201cI am not a bad mother. My daughter is not gay\u201d, relating homosexuality to a \u201cbad ideology\u201d that could not have come from Ma's traditional Chinese teachings and must therefore originate in Wil's Americanization.<ref name=\":8\" /> When Vivian and Wil break up near the end of the film, it seems as though these two identities are truly irreconcilable.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nYet at the end of the movie, this dichotomy between men and women at the dancehall is no longer present, and Wil and Vivian's kiss symbolize the breaking of this binary.<ref name=\":8\" /> While some of the partygoers leave, rejecting the inclusion of homosexual people in their community, others stay, including Wil's mother and grandfather.<ref name=\":10\" /> The happy ending shows that even though Chinese families are seen as traditional and static, they can transform to accept homosexuality.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== Impact and legacy ==\nIn an interview with Asians on Film, Michelle Krusiec mentioned that although ''Saving Face'' did not make a dramatic impact on Hollywood through the box office, the film has remained relevant through its staying power.<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Saving Face'' has continued to be screened at festivals such as at the [[San Diego Asian Film Festival]] in 2019<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web |title=Saving Face |url=https://sdaff.org/2019/movies/saving-face/ |access-date=2020-03-02 |website=2019 San Diego Asian Film Festival |language=en-US}}</ref> and at the 30th annual [[CAAMFest|San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival]] in 2012.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nLooking back on the film at the eight-year anniversary reunion and press conference, Joan Chen, Michelle Krusiec, and Lynn Chen recalled that the movie was a special project that they continue to treasure. On this topic, Joan Chen said \u201cI was always this tragic woman, and Alice gave me this opportunity to play in a comedy. In a lot of the movies that I did, before ''Saving Face'', I had a dark period where I played a lot of awful roles in films like ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'' and ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' \u2026 But I really felt I wasn\u2019t being authentic, and so ''Saving Face'' came along and gave me the opportunity to get the authenticity that I was craving for.\u201d<ref name=\":5\" /> Similarly, Krusiec was appreciative of her role as a \u201cfulfilling\u201d opportunity to show \u201creal depth\u201d in a central role where she could develop her character.<ref name=\":6\" /> Lynn Chen also praised Alice Wu for her skill at directing and commanding the set and realized that she has not had as much of a special opportunity since filming ''Saving Face''.<ref>{{cite AV media |date=20 November 2019 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnMq9wjF9Ug |title=Saving Face Reunion |publisher=[[Lynn Chen]] |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=8 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220531140333/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnMq9wjF9Ug |archive-date=31 May 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the ''Saving Face'' reunion panel at [[ClexaCon|Clexacon]] in 2017, Krusiec commented on the power of the movie, being one of the few lesbian movies with a happy ending. She explained that this film remains important because many viewers have told her that it has made them feel represented to the point where they were able to come out.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn an episode of ''Drunk Lesbians Watch'' posted in 2018 to YouTube, Michelle Krusiec and Lynn Chen appeared with the hosts and commented on specific scenes from the film, explaining the motivations and emotions of their characters in the scenes.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Follow-up ==\nIn 2019, it was announced that Alice Wu would be writing, directing, and producing ''[[The Half of It]]'', a spiritual follow-up film to ''Saving Face''. ''The Half of It'' focuses on Ellie Chu, a smart, thoughtful, lesbian Chinese American teenager growing up in an immigrant family. The film was released on [[Netflix]] in 2020.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of LGBT films directed by women]]\n* [[List of lesbian filmmakers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.sonyclassics.com/savingface/}}\n* [http://www.sonyclassics.com/savingface/presskit.pdf  ''Saving Face''] Press Kit\n* {{IMDb title|0384504}}\n* {{Allrovi movie|313456}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:2004 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Chinese-American films]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese-American films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Mandarin-language films]]\n[[Category:Shanghainese-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about surgeons]]\n[[Category:Chinese-American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Lesbian-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Destination Films films]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:2004 independent films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Will Smith]]\n[[Category:2004 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2004 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about mother\u2013daughter relationships]]\n[[Category:Asian-American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Asian-American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Chinese-language American films]]\n[[Category:2004 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
