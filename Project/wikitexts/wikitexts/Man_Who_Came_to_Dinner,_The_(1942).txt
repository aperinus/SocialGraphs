The screenplay by [[Julius J. Epstein|Julius]] and [[Philip G. Epstein]] is based on the 1939 play ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'' by [[Moss Hart]] and [[George S. Kaufman]].  The supporting cast features [[Jimmy Durante]] and [[Billie Burke]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile passing through small-town Ohio during a cross-country lecture tour, notoriously acerbic New York radio personality Sheridan Whiteside ([[Monty Woolley]]) breaks his hip after slipping and falling on the icy steps of the house of the Stanleys ([[Grant Mitchell (actor)|Grant Mitchell]] and [[Billie Burke]]), a prominent [[Ohio]] family with whom he's supposed to dine as a publicity stunt. He insists on recuperating in their home during the [[Christmas]] holidays. The overbearing, self-centered celebrity soon comes to dominate the lives of the residents and everyone else who enters the household. He encourages young adults Richard ([[Russell Arms]]) and June ([[Elisabeth Fraser]]) Stanley to pursue their dreams, much to the dismay of their conventional father Ernest.\n\nMeanwhile, Whiteside's spinster assistant Maggie Cutler ([[Bette Davis]]) finds herself attracted to local newspaperman Bert Jefferson ([[Richard Travis (actor)|Richard Travis]]). When Bert reads her his play, she is so impressed she asks Whiteside to show it to his contacts and then announces she will quit his employment and marry Bert. However, her boss is loath to lose such an efficient aide and does his best to sabotage the blossoming romance. He also exaggerates the effects of his injuries to be able to stay in the house. He suggests actress Lorraine Sheldon ([[Ann Sheridan]]) would be perfect for one of the leading roles, intending to have her steal Bert away from Maggie. Lorraine convinces Bert to spend time with her to fix up the play. When Maggie realizes Whiteside is behind the underhanded scheme, she quits. Somewhat chastened, Whiteside concocts a plan to get Lorraine out of the way, with the help of his friend Banjo ([[Jimmy Durante]]). They trap Lorraine in an Egyptian [[sarcophagus]], and Banjo ships her off to [[Nova Scotia]]. \n \nFinally fed up with his shenanigans, meddling, insults, and unbearable personality, Mr. Stanley swears out a warrant ordering Whiteside to leave in 15 minutes. However, with seconds to spare, Whiteside blackmails Mr. Stanley into dropping the warrant, and allowing his children to do as they please by threatening to reveal Stanley's sister Harriet's past as an infamous axe murderess. As Whiteside departs, he falls on the Stanleys' icy steps again and is carried back inside, much to Stanley's consternation.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Maggie Cutler\n* [[Ann Sheridan]] as Lorraine Sheldon\n* [[Monty Woolley]] as Sheridan Whiteside\n* [[Richard Travis (actor)|Richard Travis]] as Bert Jefferson\n* [[Jimmy Durante]] as Banjo\n* [[Billie Burke]] as Mrs. Ernest Stanley (Daisy)\n* [[Reginald Gardiner]] as Beverly Carlton\n* [[Elisabeth Fraser]] as June Stanley\n* [[Grant Mitchell (actor)|Grant Mitchell]] as Ernest Stanley\n* [[George Barbier (actor)|George Barbier]] as Dr. Bradley\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Miss Preen\n* [[Russell Arms]] as Richard Stanley\n* Ruth Vivian as Harriet Stanley\n* [[Edwin Stanley]] as John\n* Betty Roadman as Sarah\n* [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]] as Sandy\n* Nanette Vallon as Cosette\n* [[John Ridgely]] as Radio man\n{{Div col end}}\n'''Uncredited'''\n(in order of appearance)\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Dudley Dickerson]]{{snd}}Porter at train station\n*[[Patrick McVey]]{{snd}}Harry, the baggage clerk\n*[[Roland Drew]]{{snd}}Reporter\n*[[Ernie Adams (actor)|Ernie Adams]]{{snd}}Michaelson\n*[[Leslie Brooks]]{{snd}}Hollywood blonde\n*[[Georgia Carroll]]{{snd}}Hollywood blonde\n*[[Bess Flowers]]{{snd}}Fan at train station\n*[[Florence Wix]]{{snd}}Fan at train station\n*[[Leah Baird]]{{snd}}Fan at train station\n*[[Lottie Williams]]{{snd}}Fan at train station\n*[[Sol Gorss]]{{snd}}Chauffeur\n*[[Beal Wong]]{{snd}}Chinese guest\n*[[Kam Tong]]{{snd}}Chinese guest\n*[[Creighton Hale]]{{snd}}Radio man\n*[[Hank Mann]]{{snd}}Expressman\n*[[Eddy Chandler]]{{snd}}Guard\n*[[Fred Kelsey]]{{snd}}Detective\n*[[Frank Mayo (actor)|Frank Mayo]]{{snd}}Plainclothesman\n*[[Jack Mower]]{{snd}}Plainclothesman\n*[[Alix Talton]]{{snd}}Chorus girl\n*[[Frank Moran]]{{snd}}Haggerty\n{{Div col end}}\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n*Monty Woolley, Ruth Vivian, and Mary Wickes reprised their roles from the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=12627 |title=The Man Who Came to Dinner  |publisher=IBDB |access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>\n*[[Russell Arms]] made his screen debut.<ref name=tcm>{{tcmdb title|82721|The Man Who Came to Dinner}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Bette Davis in The Man Who Came to Dinner trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Bette Davis]] in the film's trailer]]\n\nFour of the leading characters are based on real-life personalities. Sheridan Whiteside was inspired by celebrated critic and [[Algonquin Round Table]] member [[Alexander Woollcott]], who eventually played the role on stage; Lorraine Sheldon, by musical stage actress [[Gertrude Lawrence]]; Beverly Carlton, by playwright and renowned wit [[No\u00ebl Coward]]; and Banjo, by Algonguin Round Table member [[Harpo Marx]].<ref name=Stine>Stine, Whitney, and Davis, Bette, ''Mother Goddam: The Story of the Career of Bette Davis''. New York: Hawthorn Books 1974. {{ISBN|0-8015-5184-6}}, pp. 153-154</ref><ref name=TCM>Passafiume, Andrea. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/82721/The-Man-Who-Came-to-Dinner/articles.html The Man Who Came to Dinner\"] on [[TCM.com]]</ref>\n\nWhen [[Bette Davis]] saw the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''The Man Who Came to Dinner'', she decided the role of Maggie Cutler would be a refreshing change of pace following her heavily dramatic role in ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]''. She urged [[Jack L. Warner]] to purchase the screen rights for herself and [[John Barrymore]]. He tested for the role of Whiteside but was deemed unsuitable when, as a result of his heavy drinking (or perhaps encroaching Alzheimers), he supposedly had difficulty delivering the complicated, fast-paced dialogue, even with his lines posted on [[cue card]]s throughout the set.<ref name=\"Stine\"/> The screen test was exhibited at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in the early 21st century, making the reason for Davis' subsequent rage at the superb Barrymore not being cast quite apparent.\n\nBoth [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Orson Welles]], who wanted to direct the film, campaigned for the role, and [[Laird Cregar]] and [[Robert Benchley]] made screen tests; but executive producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] thought the former was \"overblown and extravagant\" and the latter \"too mild mannered.\" Warner suggested [[Cary Grant]], but Wallis felt he was \"far too young and attractive.\" Although [[Monty Woolley]], who had created the role on the Broadway stage, was not familiar to movie audiences, Wallis finally cast him in the role, despite Warner's concern that the actor's homosexuality would be obvious on screen.<ref name=TCM /> Orson Welles played the role many years later in a television adaptation of the play.\n\n[[Bette Davis]] was unhappy with the casting of Woolley. In later years, she observed, \"I felt the film was not directed in a very imaginative way. For me, it was not a happy film to make; that it was a success, of course, did make me happy. I guess I never got over my disappointment in not working with the great [[John Barrymore]].\"<ref name=Stine />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed, \"Any one who happened to miss the original acid-throwing antic on the stage \u2013 and any one, for that matter, who happened not to have missed it \u2013 should pop around, by all means, and catch the cinematic reprise. For here, in the space of something like an hour and fifty-two minutes, is compacted what is unquestionably the most vicious but hilarious cat-clawing exhibition ever put on the screen, a deliciously wicked character portrait and a helter-skelter satire, withal.\" He added, \"Woolley makes ''The Man Who Came to Dinner'' a rare old goat. His zest for rascality is delightful, he spouts alliterations as though he were spitting out orange seeds, and his dynamic dudgeons in a wheelchair are even mightier than those of [[Lionel Barrymore]]. A more entertaining buttinsky could hardly be conceived, and a less entertaining one would be murdered on the spot. One palm should be handed Bette Davis for accepting the secondary role of the secretary, and another palm should be handed her for playing it so moderately and well.\" In conclusion, he said, \"The picture as a whole is a bit too long and internally complex for 100 per cent comprehension, considering the speed at which it clips. But even if you don't catch all of it, you're sure to get your money's worth. It makes laughing at famous people a most satisfying delight.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E0D91E31E53BBC4A53DFB7668389659EDE|title=' The Man Who Came to Dinner,' With Monty Woolley, Bette Davis, Arrives in Cinematic Full-Dress at the Strand|first=Bosley|last=Crowther}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' made note of the \"superb casting and nifty work by every member of the company\" and thought the \"only detracting angle in the entire film is [the] slowness of the first quarter.
