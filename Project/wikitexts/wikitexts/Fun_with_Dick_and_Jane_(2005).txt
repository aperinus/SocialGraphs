It stars [[Jim Carrey]] and [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] and is a [[remake]] of the 1977 film of [[Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)|the same name]]. The story focuses on a married, middle-class couple who resort to robbery when the husband's employer goes bankrupt. [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Angie Harmon]], [[John Michael Higgins]], [[Richard Burgi]], [[Carlos Jacott]], [[Gloria Garayua]] and [[Stephnie Weir]] also star, and [[James Whitmore]] appears in an uncredited cameo in one of his final roles. ''Fun with Dick and Jane'' was released by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] label to [[Columbia Pictures]] on December 21, 2005 and grossed over $204 million worldwide at the box office. It was the third collaboration between Carrey and producer [[Brian Grazer]], after ''[[Liar Liar]]'' and ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2000, Dick Harper gets promoted to Vice President of Communications for the major media corporation Globodyne. He convinces his wife Jane to quit her job as a travel agent to spend more time with their son Billy, as Dick's salary would be able to cover their expenses.\n\nHowever, during an interview on television on his first day, he discovers his CEO covertly sold 80 percent of his shares in the company and Globodyne is accused of \"perverting the American dream\" by presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]]. Simultaneously, all of the company's stocks drop to zero, and everyone, including Dick, lose their jobs, savings, and pensions. Dick tries to confront CEO Jack McCallister, but he flies away in the company's helicopter.\n \nBreaking the news to his family that night, Dick tries to assure them he can find another job as vice president. However, he soon finds that Globodyne's collapse has sent the overall economy into a recession, making it next to impossible to find a new vice president position. In addition, the television interview has tarnished his reputation as being incompetent, rendering him not hirable. Even worse, Jane discovers that, because their pension and all their savings and investments were tied up in Globodyne's now-worthless stock, the family now has no assets and face possibly losing their home.\n\nDick and Jane then accept low paying work, but are unable to keep their jobs. Soon afterwards, their utilities are cut off, forcing them to sell their personal property and take off-the-books work to stay afloat; the latter results in Dick getting wrongfully arrested and deported, necessitating his 'illegal' re-entry. When given a 24-hour eviction notice, a fed-up Dick turns to crime, persuading Jane to follow him. After a few mishaps, they rob a head shop. They go on to have a few nightly robbing sprees, becoming more comfortable and professional, even stealing from people who wronged them during their job search, and eventually retire their entire debt. For their final heist, they come up with a complex scheme to steal from a local bank. All goes as planned until the Petersons \u2013 another Globodyne couple \u2013 make an amateurish attempt to rob the same bank. The Petersons are quickly arrested and Dick and Jane lose their chance to rob the place, but take advantage of the hysteria to escape.\n\nWatching a news report on the arrests of the Petersons and other former Globodyne employees who desperately turned to crime, the Harpers decide to cease their criminal lifestyle. However, Dick finds that his interview with Ralph Nader has caused him to be indicted for his unwitting role in the company's collapse. Drowning his sorrows at a millionaire's club, he stumbles upon drunk former CFO of the company, Frank Bascombe. When he and Jane confront him, Frank remorsefully admits Jack had planned everything from the beginning: during Dick's television interview, Jack diverted all of Globodyne's assets and then dumped the entire stock, thus ruining the company and its employees and investors, and leaving Dick and Frank to take the blame, while embezzling a $400 million fortune and getting off scot-free. Frank, about to go to prison for 18 months for his role in the scheme after failing to expose Jack's crimes, got [[hush money|$10 million in hush money]] from him.\n\nFrank tells him Jack plans to transfer the $400 million to an offshore account and creates a plan with Dick and Jane to intercept the transfer, rerouting the funds to an account Frank has established. Things go wrong when Dick accidentally loses the form, so they must print a new one in the bank while Jack is there making the transfer. Jack realizes there are errors on the form and spots Dick. Finally, Dick holds Jack discreetly at gunpoint, demanding he sign a check, which he does. Dick reveals to Jane it was a ruse to get his signature, so Jane, an art major, can forge it.\n\nThe next day, Jack is mobbed by reporters and former Globodyne employees, all praising him for his sudden \"generosity\". Dick shows up as vice president and hands him a prepared statement, which the CEO reads on live television. He is shocked to announce he has transferred $400 million to a trust fund to support Globodyne's defunct pension plan. A news report reveals the company's former employees (including the now-imprisoned Petersons) will get their pension checks from the fund, Dick's reputation is restored and he evades indictment, and Jack's net worth has been reduced to a mere $2,238.04.\n\nA year later, Dick's family drives a [[Volkswagen Rabbit]] convertible into the sunset. While Billy is teaching his parents Spanish, Dick's friend Garth drives up in a brand new [[Bentley Azure]], excited to reveal that he has a new job with great benefits, at [[Enron]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Dick Harper\n* [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] as Jane Harper\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jack McCallister\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Frank Bascombe\n* [[Angie Harmon]] as Veronica Cleeman\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Garth\n* [[Richard Burgi]] as Joe Cleeman\n* [[Carlos Jacott]] as Oz Peterson\n* [[Stephnie Weir]] as Debbie Peterson\n* [[David Herman]] as Angry Caller (voice)\n* Aaron Michael Drozin as Billy Harper\n* [[Gloria Garayua]] as Blanca\n* [[Jason Marsden]] as Convenience Store Employee\n* [[Clint Howard]] as INS Agent\n* [[Pasha D.

(Some sources erroniously claim the source to be a novel by Gaiser, but there is only a novelization by Linda Stewart as \"Sam Stewart\"; the book solely cites \"a screenplay by Gerald Gaiser\" as its source, but is clearly based on a draft of the subsequent '77 shooting script, which was credited to [[David Giler]], [[Jerry Belson]] and [[Mordecai Richler]].) [[Peter Tolan]] wrote the first draft of the remake screenplay. In June 2003 it was announced that Jim Carrey would star in the film with [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] directing and [[Brian Grazer]] producing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movieweb.com/carrey-is-having-fun-with-dick-and-jane/|title=Carrey is having FUN WITH DICK AND JANE|author=Brian B.|date=June 4, 2003|publisher=movieweb.com|access-date= May 9, 2016}}</ref> On July 14, 2003 it was announced that [[Cameron Diaz]] would star opposite Carrey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2003/07/14/Cameron-Diaz-to-star-with-Jim-Carrey/UPI-72221058198949/?st_rec=97391059583758|title=Cameron Diaz to star with Jim Carrey|date=July 14, 2003|publisher=upi.com|access-date=May 9, 2016}}</ref> The same day it was also reported that the [[Coen brothers]] would rewrite the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2003/07/14/coen-bros-will-write-cameron-diaz-and-jim-carrey|title=Coen Bros. will write for Cameron Diaz and Jim Carrey|author=Susman, Gary|date=July 14, 2003|publisher=ew.com|access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref> On July 3 it was announced that Sonnenfeld had left the film six weeks before the start of production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2003/07/30/Sonnenfeld-leaves-Dick-and-Jane/97391059583758/|title=Sonnenfeld leaves 'Dick and Jane'|date=July 3, 2003|publisher=upi.com|access-date=May 9, 2016}}</ref> Production was postponed until after Carrey had completed his next film ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]''.<ref name=psffpwc>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/news/parisot-set-for-fun-pic-with-carrey-1117893377/|title=Parisot set for 'Fun' pic with Carrey|author=Fleming, Michael|date= October 2003|publisher=variety.com|access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref> On October it was announced that\n[[Dean Parisot]] would replace Sonnenfeld as director and that production would start in June 2004.<ref name=psffpwc/> [[Judd Apatow]] and [[Nicholas Stoller]] worked on the script with Parisot.<ref name=psffpwc/> Diaz then left the film.
