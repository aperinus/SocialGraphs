The film is a [[triptych]] of stories involving foreign protagonists, unfolding over the course of the same night. \"Far from Yokohama\" features a Japanese couple ([[Youki Kudoh]] and [[Masatoshi Nagase]]) on a cultural pilgrimage, \"A Ghost\" focuses on an Italian widow ([[Nicoletta Braschi]]) stranded in the city overnight, and \"Lost in Space\" follows the misadventures of a newly single and unemployed Englishman ([[Joe Strummer]]) and his reluctant companions ([[Rick Aviles]] and [[Steve Buscemi]]). The narratives are linked by a run-down flophouse overseen by a night clerk ([[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]]) and his disheveled bellboy ([[Cinqu\u00e9 Lee]]), the use of [[Elvis Presley]]'s song \"[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]\",<ref name=\"reverseshot\"/> and a gunshot.\n\nThe starting point for the script was the ensemble cast of friends and previous collaborators Jarmusch had conceived characters for, while the tripartite formal structure of the film was inspired by his study of literary forms. Cinematographer [[Robby M\u00fcller]] and musician [[John Lurie]] were among the many contributors who had been involved in earlier Jarmusch projects and returned to work on the film. ''Mystery Train''{{'}}s US$2.8 million budget (financed by Japanese conglomerate [[JVC]]) was considerable compared to what the director had enjoyed before, and allowed him the freedom to rehearse many unscripted background scenes. It was the first of Jarmusch's feature films since ''[[Permanent Vacation (1980 film)|Permanent Vacation]]'' to depart from his trademark [[black-and-white]] photography, though the use of color was tightly controlled to conform with the director's intuitive sense of the film's aesthetic.{{According to whom|date=June 2019}}\n\n''Mystery Train'' was released theatrically by [[Orion Classics]] under a restricted rating in the United States, where it grossed over $1.5 million. It enjoyed critical acclaim on the film festival circuit, and like the director's earlier films premiered at the [[New York Film Festival]] and was shown in competition at [[1989 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]], where Jarmusch was awarded the Best Artistic Achievement Award. The film was also shown in the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival|Edinburgh]], [[BFI London Film Festival|London]], [[Midnight Sun Film Festival|Midnight Sun]], [[Telluride Film Festival|Telluride]], and [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto]] film festivals, and was nominated in six categories at the [[Independent Spirit Awards]]. Critical reaction was overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers praising the structure, humor, and characters of the film, though there was criticism that the director had not been sufficiently adventurous.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film consists of three stories that take place on the same night in downtown Memphis. The three stories are linked together by the Arcade Hotel, a run-down [[flophouse]] presided over by a night clerk and a [[bellboy]], where the principal characters in each story spend a part of the night. Every room in the hotel lacks a television (as is noted in each story) but is adorned with a portrait of [[Elvis Presley]].\n\nThe first story, \"Far from Yokohama\", features Mitsuko and Jun, a teenage couple from [[Yokohama]] making a pilgrimage to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] during a trip across America. Mitsuko is obsessed with Elvis, and has put together a scrapbook detailing her belief that the singer has a mystical connection to other cultural figures ranging from [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] to the Buddha to the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The story follows the couple as they travel from the train station, through downtown Memphis and a tour of [[Sun Records]], to the Arcade hotel, before they eventually depart to board the train again.\n\nThe second story, \"A Ghost\", is about an Italian widow, Luisa, who is stranded in Memphis while escorting her husband's coffin back to Italy. Luisa shares a room at the hotel with Dee Dee, a young woman who has just left her British boyfriend (Johnny from the final story) and plans to leave the city in the morning. Luisa is kept awake by Dee Dee's constant talking. After Dee Dee finally goes to sleep, Luisa is visited by an apparition of Elvis Presley.\n\nThe final story, \"Lost in Space\", introduces Johnny. Upset after losing his job and his girlfriend, Johnny  \u2013 called Elvis, much to his chagrin \u2013 drunkenly brandishes a gun in a bar before leaving with his friend Will Robinson and his ex-girlfriend's brother, Charlie, who believes Johnny to be his brother-in-law. They stop at a liquor store, which Johnny robs, shooting its clerk in the process. Fearing the consequences, Johnny, Will and Charlie retire to the hotel to hide out for the night; there, they all become increasingly intoxicated. Charlie realizes that Will shares the same name as the character Will Robinson from the television show ''[[Lost in Space]]'', which Johnny has never heard of. Charlie and Johnny proceed to tell him about the show, and Will comments that the title describes how he feels then with Charlie and Johnny: lost in space. The next morning, Charlie discovers that Johnny is not really his brother-in-law, which angers him because of what they have been through. Johnny attempts to shoot himself, and while struggling to prevent him, Charlie is accidentally shot in the leg. Leaving the hotel, the three rush to escape a police car that is not even looking for them. The closing credits show the train, the airport and final views of the characters from the first two stories.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Masatoshi Nagase]] as Jun\n* [[Youki Kudoh]] as Mitsuko\n* [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]] as night clerk\n* [[Cinqu\u00e9 Lee]] as bellboy\n* [[Rufus Thomas]] as man in station\n* [[Jodie Markell]] as Sun Studio guide\n* [[Nicoletta Braschi]] as Luisa\n* [[Elizabeth Bracco]] as Dee Dee, Charlie's sister\n* [[Sy Richardson]] as newsvendor\n* [[Tom Noonan]] as man in diner\n* [[Joe Strummer]] as Johnny {{aka}} Elvis\n* [[Rick Aviles]] as Will Robinson\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Charlie\n* [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as Ed\n* [[Tom Waits]] as radio D.J.

The great number of these collaborators contributed to it being \"the most complicated film to write and execute\" according to the director.<ref name=\"wilmington\" />\n{{quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |salign=right|quote=What I like about the Japanese kids in Memphis is, if you think about tourists visiting Italy, the way the Romantic poets went to Italy to visit the remnants of a past culture, and then if you imagine America in the future, when people from the East or wherever visit our culture after the decline of the American empire \u2013 which is certainly in progress \u2013 all they'll really have to visit will be the homes of rock'n'roll stars and movie stars.

Although reticent about acting, Hawkins responded favorably to the director's offer to appear.<ref name=\"wilmington\" /> The part of Luisa was also written by the director with the star \u2013 actress Nicoletta Braschi \u2013 in mind; the two had previously collaborated on ''[[Down by Law (film)|Down by Law]]'' (1986).<ref name=\"atthe\" /> Cinqu\u00e9 Lee is the younger brother of director [[Spike Lee]], a longtime friend of Jarmusch from their days at [[New York University]]'s film school, while Youki Kudoh was cast after the director saw her performance in [[S\u014dgo Ishii]]'s ''[[The Crazy Family]]'' (1984) while promoting ''Down by Law'' in Japan.<ref name=\"wilmington\" /><ref name=\"strangers\" /> Repeat Jarmusch collaborators who worked on the film included [[John Lurie]] who provided the original music, cinematographer [[Robby M\u00fcller]],<ref name=\"cannes\" /> and singer [[Tom Waits]], who in a voice appearance reprised his role of radio DJ Lee Baby Sims from ''Down by Law''. Other cameos include Jarmusch's long-time girlfriend [[Sara Driver]] as an airport clerk, [[Rufus Thomas]] as the man in the train station who greets the Japanese couple,<ref name=\"strangers\" /> [[Rockets Redglare]] as the clerk of the liquor store, [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as Ed, [[Sy Richardson]] as the news vendor, and Richard Boes and [[Tom Noonan]] as diner patrons.<ref name=\"variety\" />\n\n===Filming===\n''Mystery Train'' was filmed in Memphis in the summer of 1988.<ref name=\"sukita\" /> After arriving in the city during a snowstorm to scout for shooting locations, Jarmusch drove around without direction before coming to the intersection of a disused train station, the Arcade Luncheonette diner, and the dilapidated Arcade Hotel that would become the film's core setting.<ref name=\"rea\" /><ref name=\"strangers\" /> He would later recount the experience in a March 1990 interview in ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'': \"Man, ... this crossroad is filled with so many ghosts. You know Robert Johnson walked down that street, you know Muddy Waters was in that train station.\"<ref name=\"strangers\" /> The locale of the intersection was one of the film's primary formal elements; the effect of Jarmusch returning to the setting with different characters under different circumstances was one of the variations on a theme.<ref name=\"rosenbaum\" />\n\n[[File:Screamin' Jay Hawkins as Night Clerk in Mystery Train by Masayoshi Sukita.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A middle-aged black man in a bright red suit sits at a dark brown desk against a backdrop of a wall painted in various dull shades of blue.

I am equally moved by that moment in Jim Jarmusch's ''Mystery Train'' when the young Japanese couple arrive in the train station in Memphis only to encounter what appears to be a homeless black man, a drifter, but who turns to them and speaks in Japanese. The interaction takes only a moment, but it deconstructs and expresses so much. It reminds us that appearances are deceiving. It made me think about black men as travelers, about black men who fight in armies around the world. This filmic moment challenges our perceptions of blackness by engaging in a process of defamiliarization (the taking of a familiar image and depicting it in such a way that we look at it and see it differently). Way before Tarantino was dabbling in \"cool\" images of blackness, Jarmusch had shown in ''Down by Law'' and other work that it was possible for a white-guy filmmaker to do progressive work around race and representation.}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"wilmington\">{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-27/entertainment/ca-1542_1_jim-jarmusch |title=Director Puts Much Value on Tough-Sell Reputation Movies |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 27, 1990 |first=Michael |last=Wilmington |access-date=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"liner\">{{cite AV media notes\n| title = Mystery Train\n| year = 1989\n| chapter = Notes on Mystery Train, by Jim Jarmusch\n| first = Jim\n| last = Jarmusch\n| publisher = Milan Records\n}}\n</ref>\n<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mystery-train-1990 |title=Mystery Train |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=January 26, 1990 |access-date=June 3, 2017 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |via=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"ebert-great\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-mystery-train-1989 |title=Great Movie: Mystery Train |first=Roger |last=Ebert |date=July 21, 2010 |access-date=June 3, 2017 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |via=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"salewicz\">{{cite book | last = Salewicz | first = Chris | title = [[Redemption Song: The Ballad of Joe Strummer]] | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-571-21178-4 | page = [https://archive.org/details/redemptionsongba00sale/page/433 433] | oclc = 76794852 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"strangers\">{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msdh3F68Q44C&pg=PA5 |title=''Strangers in Paradise'' |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=December 1989 |first=Scott |last=Cohen |access-date=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"mcguigan\">{{cite magazine|first=Catherine |last=McGuigan |magazine=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] |title=Shot by Shot: ''Mystery Train'' |date=January 1990 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=80\u201383}} Reprinted with permission in {{cite book | last = Hertzberg | first = Ludvig | title = Jim Jarmusch: Interviews | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | location = Jackson | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-57806-379-5 |oclc=46319700 |pages=99\u2013104 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"allmovieawards\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/work/mystery-train-34211/awards |title=''Mystery Train'' > Awards |work=AllMovie |access-date=December 28, 2009}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"areyoutryingtotellme\">{{cite book | last = Su\u00e1rez | first = Juan Antonio | title = Jim Jarmusch | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-252-07443-1 |oclc=71275566 |chapter=Are You Trying to Tell Me the Drumming in My Records Sucks?
