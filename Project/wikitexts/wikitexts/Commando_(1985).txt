Lester]] and starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Rae Dawn Chong]], [[Alyssa Milano]], [[Vernon Wells (actor)|Vernon Wells]], [[Bill Duke]] and [[Dan Hedaya]]. The film was released in the United States on October 4, 1985. The film was noted for its furious action and sense of humor.\n\nThe film was nominated for a [[Saturn Award for Best Special Effects]] but lost to ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The film's score was provided by [[James Horner]]. A commercial success, ''Commando'' was the 7th-highest-grossing R-rated film of 1985 worldwide, and the 25th-highest-grossing overall.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nRetired [[United States Army Special Forces|US Army]] [[Colonel]] John Matrix is informed by his former superior [[Major General]] Franklin Kirby that all the other members of his former unit have been killed by unknown mercenaries. The mercenaries, among them Bennett, an ex-member of Matrix's team discharged for excessive violence, attack Matrix's secluded mountain home and kidnap his young daughter Jenny. While trying to intercept them, Matrix is overpowered and abducted by the mercenaries. He is taken before their commander, Arius, a former South American dictator Matrix removed from power. Arius blackmails Matrix into carrying out a political assassination in his home country of [[Val Verde (fictional country)|Val Verde]], where he wishes to lead a military coup. With Jenny's life on the line, Matrix seemingly agrees to fulfill the demand.\n\nAfter boarding a plane, a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10|DC-10-10]] operated by [[Western Airlines]] from [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles Airport]] to Val Verde, Matrix manages to kill his guard and jumps from the plane just as it is taking off. With approximately 11 hours before the plane is scheduled to land, he sets out after another of Arius' men, Sully. He enlists the aid of an off-duty flight attendant, Cindy, and instructs her to follow Sully to a shopping mall. Cindy first assumes that Matrix is a madman, but after she sees Sully pull a gun on Matrix in the ensuing fight, she decides to assist him in his endeavor. After a lengthy car chase, Matrix catches up with Sully and drops him off a cliff to his death. Taking a [[motel]] key from Sully's jacket, Matrix tracks down and confronts Cooke, a former Green Beret in Arius' employ. He impales Cooke on a table leg after a lengthy fight. Matrix tells Cindy that Arius was going to kill Jenny, regardless of whether or not he did the job. Afterward, Matrix and Cindy break into a warehouse owned by Arius that supplies weapons for his army. Matrix learns where Jenny is being held after looking at a map of the island where Arius' villa is located.\n\nMatrix breaks into a [[surplus store]] to equip himself with military weaponry, but is immediately arrested by the police. Cindy helps him escape by using a rocket launcher on the [[police car]] and, after commandeering a seaplane from a nearby marina controlled by Arius, Matrix and Cindy land the plane off the coast of Arius' island hideout. Matrix instructs Cindy to contact General Kirby and then proceeds to Arius's villa, killing Arius and his army. Jenny escapes to the villa's basement, but is captured by Bennett. Matrix tracks them, and after a lengthy fight, finally kills Bennett by impaling him with a steam pipe. Kirby arrives with a military detachment and asks Matrix to rejoin the unit, but Matrix declines and departs the island aboard the seaplane with Jenny and Cindy, telling Kirby \"no chance.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Colonel John Matrix\n* [[Rae Dawn Chong]] as Cindy\n* [[Alyssa Milano]] as Jenny Matrix\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as President Arius\n* [[Vernon Wells (actor)|Vernon Wells]] as Captain Bennett\n* [[James Olson (actor)|James Olson]] as Major General Franklin Kirby\n* [[David Patrick Kelly]] as \"Sully\"\n* [[Bill Duke]] as Cooke\n* [[Drew Snyder]] as Lawson\n* [[Michael Delano]] as Forrestal\n* Charles Meshack as Henriques\n* Carlos Cervantes as Diaz\n* [[Chelsea Field]] as Brunette Stewardess\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Intercept Officer\n* [[Ava Cadell]] as Girl in Bed at Motel\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWriter [[Jeph Loeb]] said his original script was about an [[Israelis|Israeli]] soldier who had renounced violence.

Mark L. Lester stated that Wells was \"the only one that could have played against him [Schwarzenegger]\". He further added Bennett was \"in love with Matrix but he hated him, too.

The barracks that are \"attacked\" are actually beach properties belonging to the [[Hearst Castle|Hearst Castle Estate]]. The house that Matrix storms at the film's climax was actually the former main residence of the [[Harold Lloyd Estate]] in the [[Benedict Canyon]] district of [[Beverly Hills]]. The car chase scene between Sully and Matrix starts on [[Ventura Blvd]] and moves into the hills on [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles|Benedict Canyon]]. The [[Sherman Oaks Galleria]], in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles|Sherman Oaks]], California, served as the film's shopping mall location, and was used for six days after 9pm, after stores closed. This film was originally set to cost $8 million, but ended up costing $9 million once filming ended.<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web |title=AFI Catalog |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/57535-COMMANDO?sid=9ce03979-3cec-4008-a00c-54e9314616ff&sr=10.34141&cp=1&pos=0 |website=American Film Institute |access-date=March 10, 2020 |archive-date=May 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210503025337/https://catalog.afi.com/Film/57535-COMMANDO?sid=9ce03979-3cec-4008-a00c-54e9314616ff&sr=10.34141&cp=1&pos=0 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n=== Soundtrack ===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Commando\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[James Horner]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = December 2003\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 43:21\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2|5}} [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r820720|pure_url=yes}} link]}}\n\nA soundtrack album was released by Var\u00e8se Sarabande on December 2, 2003, as part of the label's CD Club and was limited to 3,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.varesesarabande.com/details.asp?pid=VCL%2D1103%2D1026%2D2|title=Var\u00e8se Sarabande Product Details|access-date=25 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928001724/http://www.varesesarabande.com/details.asp?pid=VCL-1103-1026-2|archive-date=28 September 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The score, composed by [[James Horner]], is notable for its prominent use of [[steel drums]] and for reusing motifs from Horner's soundtrack for 48 Hours.\n\n; Track listing\n# \"Prologue/Main Title\" \u2013 3:58\n# \"Ambush and Kidnapping\" \u2013 2:35\n# \"Captured\" \u2013 2:14\n# \"Surprise\" \u2013 8:19\n# \"Sully Runs\" \u2013 4:34\n# \"Moving Jenny\" \u2013 3:44\n# \"Matrix Breaks In\" \u2013 3:30\n# \"Infiltration, Showdown and Finale\" \u2013 14:32\n\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Commando\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[James Horner]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = August 2011\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 61:48\n| label      = La-La Land Records\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Anchor|Score}}\nLa-La Land Records released a limited edition of [[James Horner]]'s score in August 2011.

Common with early DVD releases, the disc featured a non-[[Anamorphic widescreen|anamorphic]] video transfer, a basic 2.0 surround track, and only the US [[Trailer (film)|theatrical trailer]] as an extra. DVDs released in other regions soon followed, some with anamorphic transfers, but the 2001 United Kingdom region 2 DVD was censored by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC), with 12 seconds of cuts to an arm severing and closeups of the impaled Bennett. These cuts were brought over from the 1985 original theatrical release. However, a German master was used for the UK DVD, meaning the film was cut even more than it should have been, leading to 56 seconds of cuts instead of the BBFC's 12 seconds. If the film had been resubmitted to the BBFC, it would be passed uncut under the BBFC's new, more liberal rules. This has proven to be the case as the BBFC's website indicates that both versions of the film (the U.S. theatrical cut and the unrated edition) for the DVD were passed on June 11, 2007. With the unrated edition released, the film is available in its entirety, a first for the UK.\n\nOn June 5, 2007, 20th Century Fox officially announced that a completely unedited and unrated [[director's cut]] of the film would be released on region 1 DVD on September 18, 2007. Through [[seamless branching]], this disc not only features an unrated cut (which was claimed to run at 95 minutes, but is only 91 minutes, with 92 seconds of extra footage), but as a bonus, also contains the original 90-minute, R-rated US theatrical version. Aside from this, the DVD is a special edition, featuring an [[audio commentary]] from director [[Mark L. Lester]] (only on the theatrical cut), additional [[deleted scene]]s, a ''Pure Action'' [[featurette]], a ''Let Off Some Steam'' featurette, and four photo galleries with over 150 photos. The transfer is anamorphically enhanced and features a [[Surround sound|5.1 audio mix]].\n\nIn April 2008, the 90-minute theatrical version of the film was released to consumers on the high definition [[Blu-ray Disc]] format.\n\nOn May 5, 2015, as part of the film's 30th anniversary, the [[director's cut]] of ''Commando'' was released on Blu-ray Disc in a limited edition, collectible metalpak as a Best Buy exclusive. It contains all of the special features that were included in the 2007 DVD release, including the 90-minute theatrical version of the film.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Commando'' was a box office success grossing over $57.5 million against a $9 million budget. The film debuted at number one on the weekend of October 4\u20136, 1985 in the United States and spent three consecutive weeks at the top position.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=commando.htm| title = Commando Summary| publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]| access-date = August 14, 2015| archive-date = December 7, 2017| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171207023745/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=commando.htm| url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 67% based on reviews from 36 critics, with an average rating of 5.80/10.<ref name=\"RT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1004567_commando|title=Commando (1985)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=11 July 2022|archive-date=21 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821125737/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1004567_commando|url-status=live}}</ref> The website's critical consensus reads, \"The ultimate '80s Schwarzenegger movie, replete with a threadbare plot, outsized action, and endless one-liners.\"<ref name=\"RT\" /> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a rating of 51 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{Metacritic film}}</ref>\n\n[[D.
