It stars [[Madonna]] and [[Griffin Dunne]], and depicts the story of a street-smart girl who is falsely accused of murdering her boyfriend and is sent to jail. After release, she meets a man, supposed to make sure she gets on her bus back to Philadelphia, and convinces him to help her catch those responsible for her confinement. While searching for the embezzler, they fall in love with each other.\n\nAfter her 1986 film ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'' failed, Madonna decided to sign on to another comedy, titled ''Slammer'', later renamed ''Who's That Girl''. However, she had to convince both Warner Bros. and the film's producers that she was ready. Madonna enlisted her friend Foley to direct. Shooting began in New York in October 1986, and continued until March 1987. Production was halted during December due to snowfall. Madonna utilized the time to work on her [[Who's That Girl World Tour|next tour]] and the [[Who's That Girl (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack]].\n\nThe film was released on August 7, 1987, and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only  $2.5&nbsp;million in its first week, with its final domestic total being about $7.3&nbsp;million on a budget between $17\u201320 million. Critics were highly dissatisfied with the film, and Foley's direction. However, the accompanying tour went on to be a critical and commercial success, grossing a total of US$25&nbsp;million, and playing in front of audiences totaling 1.5&nbsp;million people. The soundtrack also enjoyed commercial success, selling over six million copies worldwide, in addition to the [[Who's That Girl (Madonna song)|title track]] becoming Madonna's sixth number one single on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] record chart.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/madonnas-first-four-albums-to-be-reissued-on-crystal-clear-vinyl-2551051|title=Madonna's first four albums to be reissued on stunning crystal clear vinyl|work=[[NME]]|first=Will|last=Lavin|date=September 24, 2019|access-date=August 8, 2021|archive-date=May 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200503064730/https://www.nme.com/news/music/madonnas-first-four-albums-to-be-reissued-on-crystal-clear-vinyl-2551051|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nNikki Finn is a carefree young woman who usually wears a leather jacket and skirt, sports fire-red lips and a platinum bob, and speaks in a high-pitched voice; she is also resourceful and intelligent. One day her boyfriend Johnny sees two men stealing money out of a trust fund and takes a picture of this theft. He puts the pictures in a [[safe deposit box]] and gives Nikki the key for safekeeping. The thieves catch and murder Johnny and frame Nikki by dumping his body into the trunk of her car, and she is sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nFour years later, tax attorney Loudon Trott is marrying the daughter of one of the richest men in New York, Simon Worthington. Loudon's bride Wendy Worthington is a selfish woman who is more consumed in her wedding plans than in her fianc\u00e9's well-being. Loudon, on the other hand, has many duties entrusted to him by his boss\u2014and future father-in-law\u2014Mr. Worthington: First he must pick up a [[cougar]] for exotic-animal activist Montgomery Bell, then he must pick up Nikki (who has been put on parole) and lastly he must make sure she catches the next bus to her hometown, Philadelphia.\n\nMeanwhile, Nikki is determined to catch the actual thieves and expose the truth. After meeting Loudon, Nikki cons him into taking her shopping. After they take a Rolls-Royce into Harlem to buy a gun\u2014and are nearly arrested during a police raid\u2014she tells Loudon her story; believing she is innocent, he decides to help her. She is also on the run from a [[pimp]] named Raoul and his lackey Benny, the ones who killed Johnny. Only after dangling off a [[Cadillac]] [[limousine]] smashed through the top floor of a parking garage does he tell her the bank and the box number (6111) of her slain boyfriend.\n\nAfterward Nikki vanishes with the cougar, whom she names Murray. Later that night, Loudon visits Mr. Bell to apologize for losing the animal, then finds that Nikki had delivered Murray and was waiting for Loudon at Mr. Bell's [[penthouse apartment]]; he has created a [[Amazon rainforest|Brazilian rainforest]] filled with animals on top of his roof. There Nikki and Loudon\u2014who have become close\u2014express love for each other; Murray also finds a mate. Loudon delivers Nikki to the bus station the next morning, but Nikki brokenheartedly realizes that she must return to Philadelphia, leaving Loudon, who is about to get married. On the bus she opens an envelope in the security box and finds the photographs that prove that Mr. Worthington is an [[Embezzlement|embezzler]] and he was the mastermind behind the theft. Nikki [[Gate-crashing|gate-crashes]] the wedding, gets Mr. Worthington arrested, and proclaims her love for Loudon. Nikki and Loudon ride off into the sunset on a bus to Philadelphia, with Murray and his partner chasing after them.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Madonna]] as Nikki Finn\n* [[Griffin Dunne]] as Loudon Trott\n* [[Haviland Morris]] as Wendy Worthington\n* [[John McMartin]] as Simon Worthington\n* [[Bibi Besch]] as Ms. Worthington\n* [[John Mills]] as Montgomery Bell\n* Robert Swan as Detective Bellson\n* Drew Pillsbury as Detective Doyle\n* [[Coati Mundi (musician)|Coati Mundi]] as Raoul\n* [[Ron Taylor (actor)|Ron Taylor]] as 1st Dock Worker\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as 2nd Dock Worker\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=I was young, I was twenty-eight.

Following the commercially successful ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'', her 1986 film ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]''\u2014where she starred with her then husband [[Sean Penn]]\u2014was a critical and box-office failure, prompting Madonna to comment that she \"struggled to come to terms with her character in ''Shanghai Surprise'', because the innocence and repressed personality I was required to portray was so at variance with my own character.\"<ref name=\"morton1\">{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=189}}</ref> Continuing to struggle with her film career, Madonna was unsure of her ability to choose a good script, and film producers were less sure about backing her up.<ref name=\"morton1\" />\n\nMadonna felt that comedy was more of her repertoire, and proceeded to sign a comedy film titled ''Slammer'', written by Andrew Smith and [[Ken Finkleman]]. She wanted to play the part of a street smart girl called Nikki Finn, who was jailed for a crime she did not commit.<ref name=\"morton1\" /> However, in light of the bad publicity surrounding her and Penn, and of the very public failure of ''Shanghai Surprise'', Madonna had to persuade producers Rosilyn Heller and [[Bernard Williams (producer)|Bernard Williams]], as well as Warner Bros., that she was up for the part.<ref name=\"morton1\" /> In addition, she wanted friend [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]] to direct the film. Foley had been Penn's best man at his marriage to Madonna, and had directed the music videos of Madonna's singles \"[[Live to Tell]]\" (1986) and \"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\" (1986).<ref name=\"morton1\" /> He was ecstatic at having the opportunity to make a major feature film, as previously he had only directed the small-budgeted film ''[[At Close Range]]'', starring Penn.<ref name=\"lucy\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=29}}</ref> As author [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] pointed out in his biography on Madonna, \"the combination of a dubiously talented movie star and a first-time movie director hardly guaranteed a box-office hit, but the film received the go-ahead from Warner, who wanted to encache more on Madonna's success.\"<ref name=\"morton1\" /> Madonna plowed gamely on, saying: \"All Warner's executives were real positive about the project.
