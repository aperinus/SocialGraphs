It stars [[Mimi Rogers]] as a woman who converts from a [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]] to a [[born-again Christian]] after learning that a true [[Rapture]] is upon the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/the-rapture/|title=Review: The Rapture|author=Uhlich, Keith|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=9 November 2004 |access-date=9 November 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSharon, a young [[Los Angeles]] woman, engages in a swinging, libidinous lifestyle. She comes into contact with a [[sect]] that advises her that the [[Rapture]] is imminent.\n\nIn time, she comes to accept this belief herself and becomes a born-again Christian. She then starts living a pious life, eventually marrying and having a daughter, Mary. When her husband Randy is killed in a senseless murder, however, she begins to question the benevolence of God. She believes God has called her to go to the desert to wait for the Rapture, and instead of leaving her daughter safely with friends, she decides Mary must come with her. Foster, a police officer, is concerned for their well-being after they are reduced to stealing food while they wait, but Sharon is insistent that the end is near.\n\nSharon begins to despair after a period of time, and at her daughter's urging, decides to hasten their ascendance to Heaven. She kills Mary with a gunshot but is unable to take her own life afterwards, afraid she will be [[Christian views on suicide|condemned as having killed herself]]. She confesses to Foster what she had done and is jailed.\n\nAfter an apparition of Mary (accompanied by two angels) appears in the night, the Rapture occurs. While Sharon sits in her cell early the next morning, a loud trumpet blast is heard all over the world, signaling the start of the Rapture. Later on, Sharon and Foster, after driving out into the desert, are both raptured to a [[Purgatory]]-like landscape. Foster, who had been an [[atheist]] his whole life, accepts God and is allowed entrance to Heaven, but Sharon blames God for Mary's death, even though God did not tell her to take Mary with her to the desert, and she cannot renounce her anger at what she sees as God's cruelty. Mary pleads with her to accept God back into her heart so she can join her and Randy in Heaven, but Sharon refuses, choosing to remain alone in the purgatory-like landscape for eternity.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mimi Rogers]] as Sharon\n* [[David Duchovny]] as Randy\n* [[Kimberly Cullum]] as Mary\n* Darwyn Carson as Maggie\n* [[Patrick Bauchau]] as Vic\n* [[James LeGros]] as Tommy\n* [[Will Patton]] as Deputy Foster\n* Sam Vlahos as Wayne\n* St\u00e9phanie Menuez as Diana\n* Marvin Elkins as bartender\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in [[Los Angeles]] over six weeks.<ref name=lat/>\n\n===Casting===\nPrior to Rogers' involvement, [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Meg Ryan]], and [[Rachel Ward]] passed on taking the role of Sharon.<ref name=ew/> Tolkin noted that Rogers' [[Scientology]] beliefs played no bearing on her casting: \"Mimi's background in Scientology played no role in my casting her, nor did I see it as a problem \u2014 we never even discussed it.\" Rogers added that \"my own religious views didn't affect my approach to the picture at all.\"<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-06/entertainment/ca-112_1_mimi-rogers/2 Her Salvation? : Mimi Rogers has taken a chance with a role in a movie about faith and sin.
