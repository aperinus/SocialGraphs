It was one of the few films to be shown in [[Sensurround]], which used extended-range bass frequencies to give a sense of vibration to the viewers during the coaster rides.\n\n==Plot==\nAn unnamed man ([[Timothy Bottoms]]) (simply called \"young man\" in the credits) sneaks into [[Ocean View Amusement Park]] and places a small radio-controlled bomb on the tracks of the park's wooden roller coaster, The Rocket. The bomb detonates, causing the ride's train to derail, killing and injuring the riders as a result. Safety inspector Harry Calder ([[George Segal]]), who initially cleared the ride, is called to the park to investigate. A park worker tells Calder that he saw what he thought was a park maintenance man up on the tracks earlier that day but did not state that the man was someone other than the park had authorized to be there.\n\nIn [[Pittsburgh]] the bomber causes a fire on a [[dark ride]] at another park. Calder suspects the incidents might be linked, and learns that the executives of companies running the largest amusement parks in America are holding a meeting in [[Chicago]]. Calder flies to Chicago and intrudes on the meeting. One of the executives plays a tape sent by the bomber, wherein he demands $1 million to stop his activities.\n\nBack home, Calder is visited by FBI Agent Hoyt ([[Richard Widmark]]), who says the extortion money is to be delivered by Calder at [[Kings Dominion]]. There, Calder is ordered to wait at a telephone and the bomber calls, warning him there is a bomb in the park. He sends Calder a two-way radio so that he can keep contact, then orders Calder to go on various rides in the park such as the [[Racer 75|Rebel Yell]] roller coaster. While Calder is riding on the [[Gondola lift|Skyway]], the bomber tells Calder that the bomb is located in the radio. He warns Calder not to throw it away, because it will explode on impact on the paths below, which are occupied by many of the park's visitors. He orders Calder to falsely signal that he has made the delivery, in order to distract the FBI, then leave the money on a bench. Calder complies and walks away. Later, Hoyt admits that he marked the money (violating the bomber's instructions). Calder demands to be sent home and leaves the bomb radio with the bomb squad.\n\nBack home, Calder gets another call from the bomber. He blames Calder for the marked money, and threatens another attack. Assuming it will be directed at himself personally, Calder deduces that the next target will be [[The New Revolution (roller coaster)|Revolution]] at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]]. The FBI rejects Calder's hypothesis, but decide to investigate anyway because the ride is scheduled to debut on July 4, when park attendance will be at its highest for the season. Agents disguised as park maintenance men eventually find a bomb attached to the tracks and disarm it.\n\nThe bomber returns to his car and gets a new bomb just as the Revolution is about to open. In order to get on board, he pays a park guest $100 for his \"Gold Ticket\", which entitles the holder to be one of the first passengers. He places the bomb under his seat in the rear of the train. Following the inaugural ride, Calder recognizes the bomber's voice during his ride exit interview with a reporter. He chases the bomber, and alerts the agents that he might have placed something in the coaster train. The train leaves the chain lift on its second ride through.\n\nThe bomber is eventually cornered and threatens to blow up the ride, holding the detonator in his hand while the agents try to jam the signal. He demands a firearm. Calder takes one from an agent and begins to hand it to him. Agents succeed in jamming the detonator's signal, and alert Calder. Calder retains the gun but in doing so accidentally shoots the bomber, who then runs away. He hops a fence into the area below the Revolution and runs blindly, eventually circling back toward Calder. The bomber climbs onto the track, but sees Calder and freezes. He is hit and killed by the coaster train. The ride re-opens following the accident.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[George Segal]] as Harry Calder\n*[[Richard Widmark]] as Agent Hoyt\n*[[Timothy Bottoms]] as Young Man\n*[[Henry Fonda]] as Simon Davenport\n*[[Harry Guardino]] as Keefer\n*[[Susan Strasberg]] as Fran\n*Dorothy Tristan as Helen\n*[[Helen Hunt]] as Tracy Calder\n*[[Wayne Tippit]] as Christie\n*[[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] as Demerest\n*[[Craig Wasson]] as Hippie\n*[[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]] as Quinlan\n*[[Robert Quarry]] as Mayor\n*[[Monica Lewis]] as Tourist Mother\n*[[Dick Wesson (actor)|Dick Wesson]] as Tourist Father\n\n==Production==\nThis was the third film to be presented in [[Sensurround]]. Special low-frequency bass speakers were used during the roller coaster sequences. Sensurround was employed in only three other films released by Universal: ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974), ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' (1976), and the theatrical version of ''[[Saga of a Star World|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (1978).\n\n\"Sensurround is as big a star as there is in movies today,\" said [[Sidney Sheinberg]], head of MCA, who attributed the better-than-expected success of ''Earthquake'' and ''Midway'' at the box office to the device.<ref>Movies: Universal hopes to ride 'Rollercoaster' all the way to bank\nAljean Harmetz.

Los Angeles Times 1 Sep 1976: g5</ref>\n\nSeveral real [[amusement park]]s were used in the film for the various park and roller coaster scenes. Ocean View Park in Norfolk, Virginia, was used for the first park in the film.<ref>'Thrill Ride' a Film Star\nThe Washington Post 7 Sep 1976: B7.</ref> Although the park was located on the Chesapeake Bay, it was described as a west coast park in the film. Goldstone chose the park because of its old-fashioned feeling. The park's major wooden roller coaster, The Skyrocket, was renamed simply \"The Rocket\" for the film. [[Kings Dominion]] in Doswell, Virginia, also appeared in the film. Some of the rides featured in the film, such as the Shenandoah Lumber Company and [[Rebel Yell (roller coaster)|Rebel Yell]] wooden roller coaster (renamed Racer 75), still exist today. The final park used was [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] (now called Six Flags Magic Mountain) in Valencia, California. The park's [[The New Revolution (roller coaster)|Great American Revolution]] roller coaster was featured prominently in the film's climax.\n\nOriginally, [[Kennywood]] was one of the locations to be used in the opening \"crash\" segment of the film.  But after the park's owners declined their participation, the producers of the film ended up shooting the \"Wonder World\" segment at Kings Dominion instead.\n\nAccording to Goldstone, the three parks that appeared in the final film were chosen from over 20 candidates.\n\nAdditionally, parts of the movie were filmed at the [[Hyatt Regency Chicago]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Rollercoaster (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's musical score was written by composer [[Lalo Schifrin]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box Office===\nDespite having been released in the late spring of 1977, and being overshadowed by the smash hit ''[[Star Wars IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', it went on to be a moderate success at the box office. However it was considered a financial disappointment and Universal lost enthusiasm for Sensurround films.<ref name=\"film\"/>\n\n===Critical===\nReviews were mixed. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"effective pop entertainment that, like an amusement-park ride, deals in the sensation of suspense for the foolish fun of it.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (June 11, 1977). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/11/archives/screen-rollercoaster-on-tracksuspense-melodrama-stars-widmark-and.html Screen: 'Rollercoaster' on Track: Suspense Melodrama Stars Widmark and Fonda]\". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 12.</ref>\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and called it \"a traffic accident masquerading as a movie\" with \"one of the dullest villains imaginable.\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (June 13, 1977). \"[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43476147/gene-siskel-movie/ 'Rollercoaster' is a disaster of a disaster]\".

Section 2, p. 7.</ref>\n\n[[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in a positive review that the film \"is not so much a disaster story as an unexpectedly articulate and well-polished piece of cat-and-mouse suspense whose derivation is more from [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] than, say, [[Irwin Allen]].\"<ref>Charles, Champlin (June 10, 1977). \"'Rollercoaster' a Rousing Ride\".

Then I saw 'Rollercoaster.' 'Rollercoaster,' slambang title notwithstanding, is a singularly tepid piece of work, so dull not even Sensurround can keep you fully awake. Yes, I cried when it was finally over, there is such a thing as a bad movie, and this is it.
