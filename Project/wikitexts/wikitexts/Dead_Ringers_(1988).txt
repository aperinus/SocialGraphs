[[David Cronenberg]] directed and co-wrote the screenplay with [[Norman Snider]]. Their script was based on the lives of [[Stewart and Cyril Marcus]] and on the novel ''Twins'' by [[Bari Wood]] and Jack Geasland, a \"highly fictionalized\" version of the [[Stewart and Cyril Marcus|Marcuses' story]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/02/arts/film-view.html |last=Maslin |first=Janet |title=\"Ringers\": the Eerier, the Better |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 2, 1988 |access-date=July 29, 2018 |archive-date=October 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014061640/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/02/arts/film-view.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film won numerous honors, including for Irons' performance, and 10 [[10th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], notably [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]]. [[Toronto International Film Festival]] critics have ranked it among the [[Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Twin]]s Elliot and Beverly Mantle are [[Gynecology|gynecologists]] who jointly operate a highly successful clinical practice in [[Toronto]] that specializes in treating fertility problems. Elliot, the more confident and cynical of the two, seduces women who come to the Mantle Clinic. When he tires of them, the women are passed on to the shy and passive Beverly while the women remain unaware of the substitution.\n\nActress Claire Niveau comes to the clinic for her infertility where it turns out that she has a \"trifurcated [[cervix]]\", meaning she probably will be unable to have children. Elliot seduces Claire and then urges Beverly to sleep with her. Beverly becomes emotionally attached to Claire, and this upsets the equilibrium between the twins. Beverly also begins sharing Claire's [[Prescription drug abuse|abuse of prescription drugs]] which he abets through his doctor's authority. When Claire learns that Elliot has been taking sexual advantage of her by impersonating Beverly, she is angry and confronts them both in a restaurant but later decides to continue a relationship with Beverly exclusively.\n\nEventually, Claire leaves town to work on another film, sending Beverly into [[clinical depression]], more prescription drug abuse and paranoid [[Stimulant psychosis|delusions]] about \"mutant women\" with abnormal genitalia. Beverly seeks out [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] artist Anders Wolleck and commissions a set of bizarre \"gynecological instruments\" for operating on these mutant women. Beverly prepares to operate on a patient during surgery with one of Wolleck's tools, while his shocked surgical team exchanges horrified glances. Before he can proceed, the drug-addled doctor drops one of the tools on the ground and then collapses atop the patient, and begins to inhale from her gas mask. Both brothers are immediately suspended from practice and put on administrative leave by the hospital board.\n\nWith their medical careers now ruined, Elliot locks Beverly inside the clinic and tries to clean him up, taking pills himself in order to \"synchronize\" with Beverly. When Claire returns, Beverly leaves the clinic to be with her. After recovering his sobriety, he returns to the clinic which he finds in shambles and Elliot despondent and intoxicated. Their positions have become reversed as Beverly cares for Elliot. Drugged and despairing, they celebrate their mock birthday and Elliot volunteers to be killed so as to \u201cseparate the [[Siamese twins]]\" and allow Beverly to live his own life. Beverly disembowels Elliot on an examination table with the same claw-like instrument of Wolleck's that he planned to use on his patient in the operating room.\n\nThe next morning, Beverly awakens and sees that he killed Elliot during their drug-induced delirium. Devastated, he pulls himself together, leaves the clinic and calls Claire on a pay phone. When she asks \"Who is this?\" Beverly silently leaves the phone, walks back into the clinic and dies (implicitly from drug withdrawal) in Elliot's dead arms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Beverly Mantle / Elliot Mantle\n** Jonathan and Nicholas Haley as young Beverly / Elliot\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]] as Claire Niveau\n* Heidi von Palleske as Cary\n* [[Barbara Gordon (actress)|Barbara Gordon]] as Danuta\n* [[Shirley Douglas]] as Laura\n* [[Stephen Lack]] as Anders Wolleck\n* Nick Nichols as Leo\n* Lynne Cormack as Arlene\n* Damir Andrei as Birchall\n* Miriam Newhouse as Mrs. Bookman\n* [[Jill Hennessy]] as Mimsy\n* [[Jacqueline Hennessy]] as Coral\n** (Jill and Jacqueline Hennessy, themselves identical twins, made their film debut as twin escorts)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Jeremy Irons.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Jeremy Irons]] played the two roles of Bev and Elliot Mantle.]]\nAlthough ''Dead Ringers'' closely follows the case of [[Stewart and Cyril Marcus]], director [[Peter Greenaway]] claims that Cronenberg queried him about his film ''[[A Zed & Two Noughts]]'' for two hours before going on to make ''Dead Ringers'' eight months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plasmapool.50webs.com/interview/200410-greenaway.html|title=October 2004 - Online Q&A with director Peter Greenaway|publisher=The Plasma Pool|access-date=2015-03-04|archive-date=December 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227204920/http://plasmapool.50webs.com/interview/200410-greenaway.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn his [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], Irons claims that [[Robert De Niro]] declined playing the Mantles due to his unease with the subject matter and portraying gynecologists, while [[William Hurt]] decided to reject the parts because \"it is hard enough to play one role\".<ref name=\"Dead Ringers Review\">{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/dead-ringers/ |title=Dead Ringers Review |date=October 7, 2010 |work=A Life At The Movies |access-date=February 2, 2016 |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201232603/http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/dead-ringers/ |url-status=live }}</ref> This movie marked the screen debut of actress [[Jill Hennessy]] and her twin sister [[Jacqueline Hennessy|Jacqueline]], who play [[call girl]]s in one scene of the film.\n\nIrons was given two different dressing rooms with two sets of costumes for playing his two characters.
