The film stars [[Richard Burton]], [[Claire Bloom]], and [[Oskar Werner]]. It was directed by [[Martin Ritt]], and the screenplay was written by [[Paul Dehn]] and [[Guy Trosper]].<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|last=Erickson |first=Hal |title=The Spy Who Came In from the Cold (1965) |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/46310/The-Spy-Who-Came-in-From-the-Cold/overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123174528/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/46310/The-Spy-Who-Came-in-from-the-Cold/overview |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 November 2007 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |author-link=Hal Erickson (author) |date=2007 |access-date=22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film depicts British [[MI6]] agent Alec Leamas' mission as a faux [[defector]] who is given the task of sowing damaging disinformation about a powerful [[East Germany|East German]] intelligence officer. As part of a charade, Leamas is apparently dismissed from the British secret intelligence service and becomes an embittered alcoholic. He is soon approached by East German agents in Britain, and he allows himself to be recruited and taken to continental Europe to sell his secrets for money. Just when it seems that he has successfully discredited his target, however, Leamas is revealed to be an active British intelligence agent disseminating false information. Much to his surprise, this revelation achieves the real and heretofore hidden objectives of the mission.\n\n''The Spy Who Came In from the Cold'' was a box-office success, receiving positive reviews and several awards, including four [[BAFTA Awards]] for Best British Film, Best Actor, Best Cinematography, and Best Art Direction. For his performance, Richard Burton received the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actor, the Golden Laurel Award, and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The film was named one of the top ten films of 1966 by the [[National Board of Review]] in the United States.<ref name=\"imdbawards\">{{cite web|title=Awards for The Spy Who Came In from the Cold |work=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059749/awards |access-date=22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe West Berlin office of [[MI6]], under station chief Alec Leamas, has suffered from reduced effectiveness. He is recalled to London shortly after the death of one of his operatives and is seemingly drummed out of the agency. In reality, a carefully staged transformation of Leamas has been arranged by Control, the agency's chief. Appearing to be depressed, embittered and alcoholic, Leamas takes work as an assistant at a local library. There he begins a relationship with co-worker Nan Perry, a young and idealistic member of the [[British Communist Party]]. Leamas spends most of his small salary on alcohol, leaving him constantly low on funds. He drunkenly assaults a shopkeeper who refuses him credit and is briefly jailed. His predicament attracts the attention of the [[Hauptverwaltung Aufkl\u00e4rung|East German Intelligence Service]], which sees him as a potential [[defection|defector]].\n\nLeamas is approached by a series of operatives, each one passing him up the chain of the East German intelligence service, and he expresses a willingness to sell British secrets for money. He eventually flies to the Netherlands to meet an agent named Peters, who decides that his information is important enough to send him on to East Germany. At a German country house, Leamas is introduced to Fiedler, who becomes his main interrogator. Leamas then begins to carry out his secret mission, which is to share information that suggests a high-ranking East German intelligence officer named Mundt is a paid informant of the British. The evidence is circumstantial, and though it seems to implicate Mundt, Leamas repeatedly refutes that conclusion, claiming that an important East German official could not have been a British agent without his knowledge. However, Fiedler is able to independently confirm Leamas' information and comes to the conclusion that Mundt, his supervisor, has indeed been a secret asset of British intelligence for many years.\n\nMundt himself unexpectedly arrives at the compound and has both Leamas and Fiedler arrested for plotting against him. Once Fiedler explains his findings to his superiors, the tables are turned and Mundt is arrested. A secret tribunal is convened to try Mundt for espionage, with Leamas compelled to testify. Fiedler presents a strong case for Mundt being a paid double agent. However, Mundt's attorney uncovers several discrepancies in Leamas' transformation into an informant, suggesting that Leamas is a faux defector. Leamas' credibility collapses when Nan, who has been brought to East Germany for what she thought was a [[cultural exchange]] visit, is forced to testify at the tribunal and unwittingly reveals that she has been receiving payments from a British intelligence officer as Leamas had arranged. Faced with this testimony, Leamas reluctantly admits that he is indeed a British agent. Mundt is vindicated, and Fiedler is arrested as a complicit dupe.\n\nLeamas initially believes he has failed in his mission and fears severe retribution from Mundt. However, in the middle of the night, Mundt releases Leamas and Nan from their cells and provides an escape plan for them both. Mundt explains that Leamas' real mission has succeeded; Mundt actually ''is'' a British agent, and Fiedler had been the target of the operation all along, as he had grown too suspicious of his supervisor. This comes as a shock to Leamas, and the complex web he has been drawn into and the risk he has been placed in by his own superiors become painfully clear. He explains the entire plot to still-idealistic Nan as they drive their borrowed car toward the border. She berates him for being involved in what amounts to the murder of Fiedler, who was only doing his job. Leamas, agitated by her naivet\u00e9, erupts in an angry, self-loathing confession:\n<blockquote>What the hell do you think spies are? Moral philosophers measuring everything they do against the word of God or Karl Marx? They're not. They're just a bunch of seedy squalid bastards like me, little men, drunkards, queers, henpecked husbands, civil servants playing \"Cowboys and Indians\" to brighten their rotten little lives. Do you think they sit like monks in a cell, balancing right against wrong? Yesterday I would have killed Mundt because I thought him evil and an enemy. But not today. Today he is evil and my friend.</blockquote>\n\nLeamas and Nan arrive at the [[Berlin Wall]] and are given instructions to climb over to West Germany on an emergency ladder while a searchlight is intentionally turned away. Leamas is at the top of the wall pulling Nan up behind him when the searchlight suddenly shines directly on them, alarms sound, and Nan is shot dead by Mundt's operatives, silencing the only civilian witness to the operation. Leamas freezes in shock and horror, and is urged by agents on both sides to return to the West. Instead, he begins to climb down towards Nan's body on the eastern side of the wall and is also shot and killed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Richard Burton]] as Alec Leamas\n* [[Claire Bloom]] as Nan Perry\n* [[Oskar Werner]] as Fiedler\n* [[Sam Wanamaker]] as Peters\n* [[George Voskovec]] as East German Defence Attorney\n* [[Rupert Davies]] as [[George Smiley]]\n* [[Cyril Cusack]] as [[Control (fictional character)|Control]]\n* [[Peter van Eyck]] as Hans-Dieter Mundt\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as Ashe\n* [[Robert Hardy]] as Dick Carlton\n* [[Bernard Lee]] as Patmore\n* [[Beatrix Lehmann]] as Tribunal President\n* [[Esmond Knight]] as Old Judge\n* Tom Stern as CIA Agent\n* [[Niall MacGinnis]] as Checkpoint Charlie Guard\n* Scott Finch as German Guide\n* Anne Blake as Miss Crail\n* [[George Mikell]] as Checkpoint Charlie Guard\n* [[Richard Marner]] as Vopo Captain\n* [[Warren Mitchell]] as Mr. Zanfrello\n* [[Steve Plytas]] as East German Judge\n* [[Richard Caldicot]] as Mr. Pitt\n* [[Nancy Nevinson]] as Mrs. Zanfrello\n* [[Michael Ripper]] as Mr. Lofthouse\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film closely follows the plot of the original source text.
