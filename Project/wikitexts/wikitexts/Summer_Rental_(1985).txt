It tells the story of an overworked air traffic controller who is put on a five weeks' paid leave and takes his family to the resort town of Citrus Cove, Florida with different comical results. An original music score was composed for the film by [[Alan Silvestri]]. The film was released on August 9, 1985, by [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DEFD91138F93AA3575BC0A963948260 |title=Movie Review - Summer Rental - FILM: 'SUMMER RENTAL,' DIRECTED BY CARL REINER |work=NYTimes.com |date=1985-08-09 |access-date=2015-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4252/Summer-Rental/ |title=Summer Rental (1985) - Overview |publisher=TCM.com |date= |access-date=2015-04-30}}</ref>\n\nThe film was met with negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nOverworked [[air traffic controller]] Jack Chester is given five weeks' paid leave by his supervisor Hal after nearly causing a mid-air collision on the job and having an outburst over what turned out to be a fly covering a radar blip. He uses this time off to take his wife Sandy, children Jennifer, Bobby, and Laurie, and pet dog Archie on a summer vacation from the [[Atlanta]] area to the Gulf Coast [[resort town]] of Citrus Cove, Florida, where they are beset by a barrage of problems.\n\nFirst, they are bumped out of the front of the line of an upscale seafood restaurant in favor of arrogant local sailing champion Al Pellet. They end up dining at The Barnacle run by a local saloon keeper named Richard Scully with a pirate's mentality. Later, the family learns that they misread the address and moved into the wrong house as Dan Gardner, the real owner, and his family arrive home and help them rectify the address error. They end up at the real address which turns out to be a decrepit hut with public access path on the property to the beach. Later, Jack suffers a leg injury sailing with Bobby and colliding with Al's sailboat that prevents him from spending time with his family who befriend Don Moore and his son Gregg at the movie theater. After befriending their neighbors Vicki and Ed Sanders, Chester later befriends Richard who teaches him how to run a sailboat.\n\nLater, Jack again locks horns with Al, who turns out to be the new owner of the dubious house after the previous landlord died, having been sent to the hospital earlier. Jack gives Al the check for $1,000 to cover the rent for the next two weeks, but Al tears up the check and orders the Chesters to leave when the first two weeks expire, threatening premature personal eviction. To avoid this, Jack challenges Al to a race at the upcoming Citrus Cove Regatta: if Al wins, Jack will pay him the $1,000 rent and take his family home. if Jack wins, he keeps the money and earns the right to stay in the house for the next two weeks rent-free. Al scoffs at the notion that Jack could defeat him in a race, but accepts the challenge. However, Jack hasn't sailed for many years and doesn't even have a boat. Richard Scully volunteers to help him on both counts with help from his crew. The bored Chesters come to life by helping Jack make his new vessel seaworthy with help from the Sanders.\n\nOn the day of the Citrus Cove Regatta, the Moores watch over Archie while the Sanders watch the race. This motley crew is initially no match for Al or the other competitors, but a strong breeze, a large pair of pants, and throwing out useless items enable Jack to achieve a victory at sea.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[John Candy]] as Jack Chester, an air traffic controller who takes his family on a vacation to Citrus Cove, Florida.\n* [[Richard Crenna]] as Al Pellet, a rich arrogant sailing champion in Citrus Cove who antagonizes Jack.\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Richard Scully, the proprietor of a restaurant boat with a pirate mentality who Jack befriends.\n* [[Karen Austin]] as Sandy Chester, the wife of Jack.\n* [[Kerri Green]] as Jennifer Chester, the oldest daughter of Jack and Sandy.\n* [[Joey Lawrence]] as Bobby Chester, the son of Jack and Sandy.\n* Aubrey Jene as Laurie Chester, the youngest daughter of Jack and Sandy.\n* [[John Larroquette]] as Don Moore, a man who the Chester family befriends.\n* Tom Blackwell as Gregg Moore, the son of Don who becomes Jennifer's love interest.\n* [[Richard Herd]] as Angus MacLachlan, a Scottish man who works for Richard.\n* Santo Morales as Cortez, a Mexican man who works for Richard.\n* Harry Yorku as Yorku, a pirate musician who works for Richard.\n* [[Lois Hamilton]] as Vicki Sanders, the neighbor of the Chester family's rental that Jack befriends.\n* [[Carmine Caridi]] as Ed Sanders, the husband of Vicki who is an expert carpenter.\n* [[Francis X.
