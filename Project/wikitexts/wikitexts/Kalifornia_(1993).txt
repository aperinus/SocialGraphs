It stars [[Brad Pitt]], [[Juliette Lewis]], [[David Duchovny]], and [[Michelle Forbes]]. The film tells the story of a journalist (Duchovny) and his photographer girlfriend (Forbes) traveling cross-country to research [[serial killing]]s, who unwittingly carpool with a psychopath (Pitt) and his childlike girlfriend (Lewis).\n\nFilmed in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and rural inland California in the spring of 1993, ''Kalifornia'' premiered at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]] on August 27, 1993, where it was awarded two competition prizes. It was released theatrically the following week in the United States, but was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $2.4 million against a nearly $9 million budget. The film received mixed reviews from critics,<ref name=\"RT\" /><ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> with some praising its [[art film|art house]] sensibility, while others dismissed it as a violent [[exploitation film]]. Despite this, the film's acting was largely praised, and critic [[Roger Ebert]] heralded the performances of Pitt and Lewis among the best he had ever seen.<ref name=ebert/> The film was nominated for three [[Saturn Awards]] in 1994, including for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nBrian Kessler is a graduate student and journalist whose article about [[serial killer]]s has gotten him an offer for a book deal. He and his girlfriend Carrie Laughlin, an avant garde photographer, decide to relocate to [[California]] in hopes of enriching their careers. The two plot their journey from [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to [[Los Angeles]], planning to visit infamous murder sites along the way which Carrie can photograph for Brian's book. Short on funds, Brian posts a [[Carpool|ride-share]] ad on the university campus.\n\nMeanwhile, [[psychopath]]ic parolee Early Grayce has just lost his job. His parole officer learns of this and comes to the [[trailer park]] where Early lives with his na\u00efve girlfriend Adele Corners. Early refuses the officer's offer of a job as a janitor at the university, saying he wants to leave the state, but the officer pressures him into keeping his appointment for the job interview. When Early arrives at the campus, he sees the ride-share ad and calls Brian, who agrees to meet him the following day. Early sends Adele ahead, then murders his landlord before joining her to wait for Brian and Carrie. Carrie is reluctant about riding with the couple given their rough appearance, but Brian encourages her to give them a chance. On the road, unbeknown to his companions, Early murders a man in a gas station bathroom and steals his money. When they arrive at their first hotel, Early cuts Adele's long hair shorter to try to match Carrie's.\n\nAt another hotel, Early invites Brian out to play pool, leaving Adele and Carrie alone together. Adele explains that her mother did not approve of her relationship because Early had just been released from prison. Adele reveals to Carrie that she suffered a vicious [[gang rape]] and that she views Early as her protector, even though he sometimes \"punishes\" her. While Carrie and Adele drink beer, Adele also admits to Carrie that Early forbids her to smoke or drink. Meanwhile, at a local bar, Early assaults a man who confronts Brian. Later on during the road-trip, Early introduces Brian to pistol shooting in a remote, unnamed location.\n\nCarrie is alarmed by Brian's growing fascination with Early, and by Brian's nonchalant response to the news that Early is a convicted [[felony|felon]]. After catching Early and Adele having sex in the car, she gives Brian an [[ultimatum]]: either they rid themselves of the pair, or she will leave. At a desert gas station, Carrie glimpses a news report about Early being a suspected murderer. Early kills the gas station attendant in front of Carrie and continues the trip with the couple as hostages. At an abandoned mine camp, the party encounter two police officers whom Early shoots and kills. They next come to the home of an elderly couple in the desert. Early beats the man to death, but Adele allows the woman to flee.\n\nWhen Early confronts Adele about letting the woman free, she hits him in the face with a [[cactus]] and chastises him, after which he shoots her to death. He then knocks Brian unconscious before kidnapping Carrie, driving her to the abandoned [[Nevada Test Site|Dreamland nuclear testing site]] on the California-[[Nevada]] border. Early forces Carrie to dress in Adele's clothes and the film implies that he rapes her off-camera. Brian regains consciousness, and the elderly woman gives him the keys to her truck. Brian follows Early to the test site and attacks him, hitting him in the face with a shovel. Brian finds Carrie, who appears to be in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], handcuffed to a bed in an abandoned house. Early, who was only stunned, attacks Brian and they struggle. Early is hit over the head by Carrie with the limb from a nuclear test [[mannequin]]. When he continues the attack, Brian shoots and kills him.\n\nSome time later, Brian and Carrie are living in an oceanfront house in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. As Brian sifts through tapes made with his [[Dictation machine|voice recorder]] during their trip, Carrie tells him that a gallery in Venice is interested in her art. Brian responds by suggesting they go out to celebrate. As they depart, Brian unintentionally leaves a recording running, which reveals a \"thank you\" message Adele covertly left at the end of a tape.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Brad Pitt]] as Early Grayce\n*[[Juliette Lewis]] as Adele Corners\n*[[David Duchovny]] as Brian Kessler\n*[[Michelle Forbes]] as Carrie Laughlin\n*James Michael McDougal as John Diebold\n*[[Mars Callahan]] as Walter Livesy\n*[[Brett Rice]] as Police Officer\n*[[Loanne Bishop]] as Female Officer\n*[[John Dullaghan]] as Mr. Musgrave\n*Sierra Pecheur as Mrs. Musgrave\n}}\n\n==Critical analysis==\nIn ''Lost Highways: An Illustrated History of Road Movies'' writers Jack Sargeant and Stephanie Watson note that the film presents doubled images of the two couples, \"contrary rituals of affirmation\" between Early and Adele, and Brian and Carrie, which demonstrate their social and class-related disparities.{{sfn|Sargeant|Watson|1999|p=159}} Sargeant and Watson also interpret the character of Carrie as an androgyne that \"offers a threat to order\" in the dynamics among Early, Adele, and Brian.{{sfn|Sargeant|Watson|1999|p=166}}\n\nFilm scholar Charles Derry views ''Kalifornia'' as part of a historical trend of serial killer films released in the early 1990s, popularized by the success of [[Jonathan Demme]]'s ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991).{{sfn|Derry|2009|p=133}} Derry interprets the film's misspelled title as a \"political attack on those fascist qualities within AmeriKa which breed such violence,\" and also draws parallels between its aesthetic elements to those of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960).{{sfn|Derry|2009|p=133}} Furthermore, Derry considers the climactic sequence setting at the Dreamland nuclear testing site as an \"image of [[Armageddon]]\" symbolic of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings]], which themselves \"should be considered government-sanctioned serial killings on a massive scale.\"{{sfn|Derry|2009|p=135}}\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nOriginally titled ''California'', the script was written by Tim Metcalfe with Stephen Levy in 1987.
