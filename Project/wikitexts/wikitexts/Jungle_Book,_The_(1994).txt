It is the second film adaptation by [[The Walt Disney Company]] of the [[Mowgli]] stories from ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894) and ''[[The Second Jungle Book]]'' (1895) by [[Rudyard Kipling]], and the first live-action adaptation of [[Walt Disney]]'s [[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|animated film of the same name]] from 1967.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nibley |first=Alexander |date=May 26, 1997 |title=Are Films Using Names in Vain? |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-26/entertainment/ca-62611_1_jungle-book |url-status=dead |access-date=November 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103214325/http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-26/entertainment/ca-62611_1_jungle-book |archive-date=November 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film stars [[Jason Scott Lee]], [[Cary Elwes]], [[Lena Headey]], [[Sam Neill]], and [[John Cleese]]. Unlike most adaptations of Kipling's stories in the animated film, the animal characters in this film do not speak which same happened later in [[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]], a live action remake of the [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|1961 animated film of almost the same name]].\n\nReleased on December 25, 1994, by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], the film received generally positive reviews and grossed $70.7 million in theaters against a $30 million budget.\n\nIn 2016, Disney released another live-action adaptation, ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', which was more similar and faithful to both the 1967 animated film and Kipling's book.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1887, during the [[British Raj]] in India, Mowgli is the 5-year-old son of the widowed jungle guide Nathoo, whose wife [[Maternal death|died in childbirth]]. On one of Nathoo's tours, he leads Colonel Geoffrey Brydon and his men, as well as Brydon's 5-year-old daughter Katherine nicknamed Kitty. Fellow guide Buldeo and two soldiers kill several animals for sport, which enrages [[Shere Khan]], a tiger who serves as the jungle's keeper, and he begins to pursue the tour group. That night, Kitty gives Mowgli her late mother's bracelet as a gift. Mowgli tells Nathoo of a dream where he faced Shere Khan and showed no fear, becoming a tiger himself. Shere Khan attacks the encampment. He succeeds in killing the two soldiers, but when he tries to kill Buldeo, Nathoo defends him and is subsequently mauled to death by Shere Khan. In the confusion, Mowgli is lost in the jungle with his pet wolf cub, [[Grey Brother]], and Brydon and his men presume him killed. Mowgli is taken by [[Bagheera]], a gentle black panther, to the wolf pack. Mowgli also befriends a bear cub named [[Baloo]].\n\nYears pass and Mowgli grows into a young man.  One day, a monkey steals the bracelet and lures Mowgli towards a legendary lost city honoring [[Hanuman]], filled with treasure belonging to [[King Louie]] the [[orangutan]], who has the treasure guarded by [[Kaa]], a gigantic python. Forced to fight for his life and the bracelet, Mowgli succeeds in wounding the snake with a bejeweled dagger that he retrieves from the treasure horde. Winning King Louie's respect, Mowgli keeps the dagger as a trophy.\n\nElsewhere, Kitty and Colonel Brydon are still stationed in India. She and Mowgli meet again, but neither recognize the other. Kitty is also in a relationship with one of Brydon's soldiers, Captain William Boone. Infatuated with her, Mowgli travels to Brydon's fort and enters her room, alerting the guards. Kitty sees that Mowgli is wearing her mother's bracelet and realizes who he is. Boone and his men manage to capture Mowgli with Buldeo's help. They find the jeweled dagger on his possession, which Buldeo recognises as coming from the lost city. Kitty and Dr. Julius Plumford, a good friend of Brydon's, decide that they must reintroduce Mowgli to civilization. In doing so, Mowgli and Kitty fall in love, much to Boone's displeasure. Eventually, Boone convinces Mowgli to tell him of his \"Monkey City\" and the treasure hoard that it holds, but Mowgli refrains from revealing its location to Boone upon realizing he does not follow the \"Jungle Law\" and kills for sport rather than survival purposes. Boone later proposes to Kitty, although she is hesitant to concede. Around this time, after Boone and his men publicly humiliate him, Mowgli returns to the jungle as he does not feel at home in the village. After Boone's cruel treatment of Mowgli, Kitty realizes she cannot marry Boone, so Colonel Brydon decides to send her back to England.\n\nMeanwhile, Boone teams up with Buldeo and his friend Tabaqui. The men recruit soldiers Lieutenant Wilkins and Sergeant Harley, and gather some bandits to capture Mowgli in order to find out where the treasure is. Wilkins and Boone shoot Baloo when he comes to Mowgli's defense, much to Mowgli's distress. Buldeo and the bandits then ambush Kitty and Brydon, who is shot and wounded in the process. Even though Mowgli, along with Bagheera, Grey Brother, and the rest of the wolves, attack and fight off the bandits, Buldeo manages to capture Kitty and Brydon and the would-be treasure hunters use them as blackmail: if Mowgli leads them to the treasure, Kitty and her father shall live. That night, the group learn Shere Khan has returned to the Jungle and is hunting them. Because of this, Mowgli decides to escape the group and keep lookout to ensure Kitty's safety.\n\nThe next morning, Harley catches Mowgli escaping with the aid of Bagheera and chases him, only to fall into [[quicksand]] and drown, despite Wilkins' attempt to save him. Mowgli then has an elephant take the injured Brydon back to the village, after promising him to rescue Kitty. As the journey continues, Tabaqui decides that Mowgli is no longer needed and attempts to murder him, only to be killed himself after toppling off a cliff. Later, Wilkins becomes separated from the group and is mauled to death by Shere Khan. Eventually, the remaining party enters Monkey City, where Buldeo inadvertently entombs himself in a trap while trying to shoot Mowgli. Only Mowgli, Kitty and Boone reach the treasure room, where Mowgli and Boone engage in a fierce fight until Mowgli injures Boone with another dagger. Mowgli then escapes with Kitty, while Boone begins greedily pocketing treasure; until Kaa returns and kills him.\n\nAs they escape from the ancient ruins, Mowgli and Kitty are confronted by Shere Khan, who roars at them. However, Mowgli roars back and defiantly stands his ground. Impressed by Mowgli's bravery, Shere Khan acknowledges him as a creature of the jungle and allows him and Kitty to leave peacefully. Mowgli and Kitty reunite with Brydon and Baloo, both of whom have recovered from their injuries under Plumford's care. Having defeated Boone and his men and fulfilled his childhood dream in facing Shere Khan, Mowgli becomes the new lord of the jungle and begins a relationship with Kitty.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jason Scott Lee]] as [[Mowgli]], a wild man who was orphaned at 5 years old and was raised by the animals in the jungle of India.\n** Sean Naegeli  as 5-year-old Mowgli\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Captain William Boone, Kitty's suitor who desires the wealth of the ancient ruins.\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Katherine \"Kitty\" Brydon, the feisty and benevolent daughter of Colonel Brydon who is also the childhood friend and romantic interest of Mowgli.\n** Joanna Wolff as 5-year-old Kitty\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Colonel Geoffrey Brydon, Kitty's firm but reasonable father who is the head of the British army stationed in India.

Dissatisfied with these scripts, one of which was 180 pages long with no dialogue for the first 70 pages, Katzenberg handed the project to [[Stephen Sommers]] after being satisfied with his work on ''[[The Adventures of Huck Finn (1993 film)|The Adventures of Huck Finn]]''. Sommers, who is a huge fan of the original animated film and various jungle adventure films, was eager to do a lush, romantic adventure and to show the beauty of the jungle. Executives were stunned by Sommers' decisions for the project as some were expecting an exact recreation of the original animated film and others wanted a teen romance to be the main focus.\n\nWhen it came to casting, [[Jason Scott Lee]] was Sommers' only choice for [[Mowgli]]. Disney executives labeled him as \u201ctoo old\" for the role until Sommers convinced them that he would be a much more believable leading man than an unknown teenager. Lee was also cast because the animals reacted to him the best. Sommers and his crew did try to cast actors in India, but due to [[Bollywood]] guidelines, their schedules and limits on the number of films they could work on restricted their involvement. However, they were able to cast [[Stefan Kalipha]] and [[Anirudh Agarwal]] before they agreed to any Bollywood productions. The casting of [[Cary Elwes]] as Captain William Boone, [[Lena Headey]] as Kitty Brydon, and [[Sam Neill]] as Colonel Geoffrey Brydon soon followed. Neill in particular found himself drawn to the role as he comes from a long line of family who served in the British Army during the [[British Raj|Raj]].<ref name=notes>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ibiblio.org/samneill/films/junbooknotes.txt |title=Production Information |access-date=February 18, 2018 |archive-date=November 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107062950/http://www.ibiblio.org/samneill/films/junbooknotes.txt |url-status=live |website=The Sam Neill Home Page}}</ref> The role of Dr. Julius Plumford was always written for [[John Cleese]] but Sommers was discouraged that Cleese would never accept it.
