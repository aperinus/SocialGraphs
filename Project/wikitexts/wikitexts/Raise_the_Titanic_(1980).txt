The film, written by Eric Hughes (adaptation) and [[Adam Kennedy (actor)|Adam Kennedy]] (screenplay), is based on the 1976 [[Raise the Titanic!|book of the same name]] by [[Clive Cussler]]. The storyline concerns a plan to recover the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] due to the fact that it was carrying cargo valuable to [[Cold War]] [[hegemony]].\n\nThe film stars [[Jason Robards]], [[Richard Jordan]], [[David Selby]], [[Anne Archer]], and Sir [[Alec Guinness]]. It received mixed reviews by critics and audiences and proved to be a [[box-office bomb]], grossing about $7 million against an estimated $40 million budget. Producer [[Lew Grade]] later remarked \"it would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic\".<ref name=\"independent\">{{citation|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/it-would-be-cheaper-to-lower-the-atlantic-1312196.html|title=It would be cheaper to lower the Atlantic|place=London|date=31 August 1996|first=Rebecca|last=Fowler|access-date=2009-05-11}}</ref><ref name=\"Kennedy\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19343441|title=Australian billionaire on mission to recreate Titanic|first=Duncan |last=Kennedy|work=BBC News|date=25 August 2012 |access-date=25 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the wilds of Northern Siberia, an American geologist/spy breaks into an old, snow-covered mine, where he discovers the frozen body of a US Army sergeant. Next to the corpse is a wooden [[Headstone|marker]] dated 1912. Using his [[Geiger counter]], the geologist/spy discovers that the mineral he seeks was there. He is then chased away by a [[Soviet]] soldier, who shoots him while in pursuit.\n\n[[CIA|US intelligence]] soon find out that the wooden shipping boxes containing the raw mineral were loaded onto the RMS ''Titanic'' in April 1912 by an American. A search is conducted in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] to locate the sunken [[ocean liner]]. It is aided by one of the ''Titanic''{{'s}} last survivors who explains he was also the last person to see the American alive. Just before the ''Titanic'' foundered, the sailor said he locked the man inside the ship's vault containing the boxes of mineral, his last words being, \"Thank God for Southby!\"\n   \nSalvage experts begin the dangerous job of raising the ''Titanic'' from the seabed, during which one of the submersibles, ''Starfish'', experiences a cabin flood and implodes. Another submersible, the ''Deep Quest'', experiences a battery shortage, which causes its manipulator arm to become locked onto the ''Titanic''{{'}}s wreckage.\n\nEventually, the rusting ''Titanic'' is brought to the surface using multiple compressed air tanks and buoyancy aids. The passenger liner is then towed to a dry dock in New York, its original destination. It turns out no expense is being spared because the rare mineral will be used as the power source in a proposed weapons system that could take down any missile entering US airspace. In response, the [[USSR]] challenges the United States over the salvage of ''Titanic'' because they claim the mineral was taken illegally from the [[Soviet Union]]. On entering the watertight vault, the salvage team discover the mummified remains of the American, but no mineral. The boxes are just full of gravel. It soon becomes evident that a clue was left in the dead American's final words. He had arranged a fake burial in a graveyard in \"Southby\", England prior to sailing back to the United States on the ill-fated ocean liner. It is decided to leave the mineral buried in the grave because knowledge of its existence would destabilize the ''[[status quo]]'' that maintains the peace between the West and the Soviet Union.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Robards]] as [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[James Sandecker]]\n* [[Richard Jordan]] as [[Dirk Pitt]]\n* [[David Selby]] as Gene Seagram\n* [[Anne Archer]] as Dana Archibald\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as John Bigalow\n* [[Bo Brundin]] as Captain Andre Prevlov\n* [[M.

In August of that year producer Robert Shaftel reportedly had the film rights,<ref>{{cite news|title=book notes: Titanic epic that earns the title|author=Lochte, Dick|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Aug 29, 1976|page=j2}}</ref> but in the following month it was clarified that the film rights had not yet been offered.<ref>{{cite news|title='Pop' goes Warhol's cash register|author=Lochte, Dick|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Sep 12, 1976|page=u2}}</ref>\n\n===Stanley Kramer===\n[[Lew Grade]] said he read the novel by Clive Cussler and became interested, thinking there was potential for a series along the lines of the James Bond films. He discovered that [[Stanley Kramer]] was interested in directing, and Grade said he would buy the rights to the book and let Kramer direct and produce.<ref name=\"grade\">Lew Grade, ''Still Dancing: My Story'', William Collins & Sons 1987 p 260-261</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lord Grade: A Movie Mogul In the Classic Mold: Lew Grade at 73: A Classic Mogul|author=Benedict Nightingale|work=New York Times|date=Feb 10, 1980|page=D1}}</ref> Kramer was making ''The Domino Principle'' for Grade.

Kramer explained \"the factors were casting and the number of miniatures we planned to use. You might say one of the possibilities as to why I left was that I felt things might have cost more. It's aways a little sad to see it happen this way. ''Raise the Titanic'' was a big challenge \u2013 all the excitement of special effects, underwater filming\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Film Clips: Gilbert Moses Lands a 'Fish'|author=Lee, Grant|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Dec 31, 1977|page=c6}}</ref> Kramer said the producers wanted the movie made for $9 million but he felt it would cost $14 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Critic at Large: High Noon for Stanley Kramer Critic at Large|author=Champlin, Charles|work=Los Angeles Times |date=Feb 24, 1978|page=e1}}</ref> Kramer was paid off with a fee of $500,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=All That Glitter Isn't Sold--Yet|author=Mann, Roderick|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Mar 21, 1978|page=e11}}</ref>\n\n===Jerry Jameson===\nIn May 1978, Jerry Jameson was picked up as a director, who had been attached to ''The Golden Gate'', which had not been made. Grade said the movie would be his most expensive yet, costing $20 million, but would not feature any major stars, as he commented that \"the ship is the star. Anyway the money that would normally go to actors has been spent on our models. They're magnificent\". The models cost $5 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Gospel According to Heston|date=May 25, 1978|work=Los Angeles Times|page=f17}}</ref> William Frye, who produced Jameson's ''Airport 77'', was hired to produce.<ref name=\"pre\"/>\n\nProduction costs spiralled to {{USD|15 million}} as work was undertaken to find a ship that could be converted to look like the sunken ''Titanic''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB8J2ho-0k8C&pg=PA413|title=Guts and Glory|first=Lawrence H.Suid|last=Suid|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2002|isbn=9780813190181|page=413}}</ref>\n\nIt was felt that the real ''Titanic'', if raised from the bottom of the ocean, would come up rather gradually at a gentle angle, before levelling off on the surface. The tank in North Hollywood was too shallow and would launch the model like a rocket ship. It was decided to film in a bigger tank.<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\nIn December 1978 construction began on a water tank in Malta to film the underwater scenes. Grade said that \"Malta was the only place we could find an existing tank with the right location and the right surroundings\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Malta filming vital, says Grade|author=Barker, Dennis|work=The Guardian |date=Dec 20, 1978|page=6}}</ref>\n\nA double for the ''Titanic'' was found in Athens.<ref name=\"pre\"/>\n\n===Screenplay===\nThe screenplay also underwent numerous rewrites.<ref name=\"tales\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPsyxjUxYIAC&pg=PA74|title=Film Tales|first=Robert |last=Cettl|publisher=Wider Screenings TM|year=2010|page=74|isbn=9780987050007}}</ref> The first writer to work on it was Adam Kennedy, who wrote the script for Stanley Kramer's film for Lew Grade, ''The Domino Principle''. He was followed by Eric Hughes, [[Millard Kaufman]] and [[Arnold Schulman]]. Kennedy was brought back to do further revisions on the script and he gets sole credit.<ref name=\"pre\"/>\n\nNovelist [[Larry McMurtry]] \u2013 who disliked Cussler's novel, considering it \"less a novel than a manual on how to raise a very large boat from deep beneath the sea\" \u2013 claims that he was one of approximately 17 writers who worked on the screenplay and the only one not to petition for a credit on the finished film.<ref>{{cite book|last=McMurtry|first=Larry|author-link=Larry McMurtry|title=Hollywood: A Third Memoir|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=2010|pages=59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nAdmiral David Cooney, Chief of Information for the Navy, demanded the script be rewritten so as the Russians did not come off smarter than the Americans.<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\nCussler was furious with the final result, because most of the original plot had been rejected leaving a hollow shell of his story; additionally he felt that the casting was wrong. Elements of the novel which did survive into the film were the discovery of the cornet that leads the search party to the wreck, and the eventual discovery of the mineral not in the ''Titanic'' cargo hold, but in the Southby graveyard, although in the novel's story it is exhumed and the Sicilian Project is tested.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Elliott Gould]] was offered a lead role, but turned it down: \"I don't want to raise the Titanic.

By this stage $15 million had already been spent on the tank and models.<ref name=\"pre\">{{cite news|title=Preproduction: A Titanic Task|author=Schreger, Charles|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Oct 20, 1979|page=c6}}</ref>\n\nAn old Greek [[ocean liner]], [[SS Santa Rosa (1932)|''SS Athinai'']] (which was scrapped in 1989), was converted into a replica of the ''Titanic''. A scale model was used for close-up underwater scenes. At the time of filming there were conflicting views as to whether [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|the ''Titanic'' had broken up as she foundered]] based on the original eyewitness testimony of the survivors, and \u2013 in line with the novel's assumption against the break-up narrative \u2013 the ship was portrayed as intact in the film. In 1985 the wreck of the real ''Titanic'' was located, confirming that she had broken up during the disaster, and lay in two pieces on the bottom of the North Atlantic in a state of advanced corrosion.\n\nA 10-tonne {{convert|50|ft|abbr=on}} scale model was also built for the scene where the ''Titanic'' is raised to the surface. Costing $7 million, the model initially proved too large for any existing water tank.<ref name=\"tales\" /> This problem led to one of the world's first [[horizon tank]]s being constructed at the Mediterranean Film Studios near [[Kalkara]], [[Malta]]. The 10 million-gallon tank could create the illusion a ship was at sea. The ''Titanic'' model was raised more than 50 times until a satisfactory shot was acquired.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\nFollowing the completion of filming, the scale model was left to rust for 30 years at the side of the horizon tank (at {{nowrap|{{coord|35|53|36.36|N|14|32|4.41|E|scale:10000}}}}). In January 2003 a storm caused damage to the model. By 2012 the remains of the metal structure had been moved to a new location closer to the sea (at {{nowrap|{{coord| 35|53|37.51|N| 14|32|6.13|E|scale:2000|display=inline}}}}).\n\nThe final scene involved Alec Guinness at St. Ives in Cornwall<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-film-locations.com/scene-2ev/Raise-The-Titanic-1980|title=British Film Locations \u2013 Raise the Titanic|website=British Film Locations}}</ref> over two days. The day before the shoot St Ives had its worst storm in one hundred years, destroying the church where the scene was to be shot so it had to be relocated.<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] created the film's musical score, which became the most acclaimed aspect of the production and is considered by many to be one of the very best of Barry's career \u2013 closely following the style of his soundtrack for the James Bond film ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' the preceding year, with militaristic passages reflecting the Cold War aspects of the plot to the dark, cold, brooding compositions reflected in the underwater scenes.\n\nThough the original recordings of the music have been lost, Silva Screen Records, along with Nic Raine, one of Barry's orchestrators, commissioned a re-recording in 1999 of the complete score with the [[City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nIn August 2014{{needs update|date=August 2018}} Network On Air were to release ''Raise The Titanic'' on Blu-ray in the UK, with the only known available original Barry score.
