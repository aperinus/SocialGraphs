Mrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins, who belong to the same ladies' club, but have never spoken, become acquainted after reading a newspaper advertisement for a small medieval castle on the shores of the Mediterranean to be let furnished for the month of April. They find some common ground as both are struggling to make the best of unhappy marriages. Having decided to seek other ladies to help share expenses, they reluctantly take on the elegant but peevish elderly Mrs. Fisher, and the stunning, aloof, and very wealthy Lady Caroline Dester. The four women come together at the castle and, after many unexpected twists and turns, find rejuvenation in the tranquil beauty of their surroundings, rediscovering hope and love.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Josie Lawrence]] as Lottie Wilkins\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Rose Arbuthnot\n* [[Polly Walker]] as Caroline Dester\n* [[Joan Plowright]] as Mrs. Fisher\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Mellersh Wilkins\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Frederick Arbuthnot\n* [[Michael Kitchen]] as George Briggs\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location at [[Castello Brown]] in [[Portofino]], Italy, the castle where the author of the book had stayed in the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/31/movies/review-film-in-italy-a-lourdes-for-the-soul.html|title=Review/Film; In Italy, A Lourdes For the Soul|first=Janet|last=Maslin|date=31 July 1992|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> The score by [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], featuring flute and oboe themes, evokes the film's mood and accentuates the story's sentimentality and nostalgia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chandos.net/cd_notes.asp?cnumber=chan%209867|title=Chandos Records Classical Music CDs and MP3 Downloads OnLine|last=RECORDS|first=CHANDOS|website=Chandos Records|access-date=2017-09-01}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film premiered as the opening night gala of the [[London Film Festival]] on 6 November 1991.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[BFI]]|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/every-bfi-london-film-festival-opening-night-film|title=Every BFI London Film Festival opening night film|date=22 August 2016|last=Robinson|first=Brian|access-date=20 January 2020}}</ref> It gained a positive reaction from critics and holds an 84% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 31 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/enchanted_april|title=Enchanted April (1992)|website=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
