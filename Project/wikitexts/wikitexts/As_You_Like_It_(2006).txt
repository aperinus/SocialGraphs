The film stars [[Romola Garai]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[Adrian Lester]], [[Janet McTeer]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[David Oyelowo]] and [[Brian Blessed]] in a [[dual role]].\n\nTransferring the play's setting to a late 19th-century European colony in Japan after the [[Meiji Restoration]], filming took place at [[Shepperton Film Studios]] and at the never-before-filmed gardens of [[Wakehurst Place]]. Produced by The Shakespeare Film Company and financed by [[HBO Films]] and [[BBC Films]], it is the fifth and to date, the most recent Shakespeare adaptation by Branagh, and the only one not to feature Branagh himself in the cast, though he has a [[cameo appearance|vocal cameo]] towards the end of the film.\n\nThe film premiered in Italy on 1 September 2006 before being released by [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse]] in the United States on 21 August 2007 and by [[Lionsgate UK|Lionsgate]] in the United Kingdom on 21 September 2007. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n== The Japanese setting ==\n{{main|Nanban trade}}\nAlthough the film was not made in Japan, Branagh sets the play there during the late nineteenth century among [[Nanban trade|English traders]]. Branagh portrays Duke Senior's court as a British outpost whose ruler admires [[Japanese culture]]:  although most of the inhabitants wear European clothes, Duke Senior and his brother both wear [[Japanese clothes]]. Each British lady at the outpost covers her face modestly with a fan, and styles her hair in a Japanese manner. When the banished characters travel to the [[Arden, Warwickshire|Forest of Arden]], both Japanese and western actors portray its inhabitants: Phoebe and William are Japanese, Corin and Audrey are European, while Silvius is a European who wears Japanese clothes. [[Black British]] actors play the de Boys brothers, Orlando and Oliver, Orlando fights a [[sumo]] wrestler.\n\nBranagh invented a prologue in which [[ninja]] warriors attack Duke Senior's family as it attends a performance of [[Kabuki]] theatre. Branagh's prologue defines exactly the moment that Duke Frederick usurps his brother's kingdom, a moment that Shakespeare's play does not.\n\nThe epilogue deliberately interrupts the closing credits with Rosalind's speech, as the camera pans to see Rosalind's actor, [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], walking to her dressing trailer on the film's location.\n\nDespite the cultural transposition, Shakespeare's text and the names of his characters remain the same. The film closely follows Shakespeare's plot. Although some critics praised the setting, others found it useless and irrelevant since few of the characters are [[Japanese people|Japanese]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article2490202.ece | title=As You Like It | work=The Times | date=13 March 2012 | access-date=24 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/wrong-turn/Content?oid=925709 | title=Wrong Turn | publisher=Chicago Reader | date=16 August 2007 | access-date=24 July 2012 | last=Gronvall | first=Andrea}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per closing tombstone stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\nThe onscreen credits list the main cast alphabetically:\n{{Cast listing|\n* Jotham Annan as Jaques de Boys<!---Jaques without a \"c\" per onscreen credits--->\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as Duke Senior and Duke Frederick\n* [[Richard Briers]] as Adam\n* Paul Chan as William\n* [[Richard Clifford]] as Le Beau\n* [[Patrick Doyle]] as Amiens\n* [[Romola Garai]] as Celia\n* [[Gerard Horan]] as Denis\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Rosalind\n* Jade Jefferies as Phoebe\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Jaques<!---Jaques without a \"c\" per onscreen credits--->\n* [[Adrian Lester]] as Oliver de Boys\n* [[Janet McTeer]] as Audrey\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Touchstone\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as Orlando de Boys\n* [[Alex Wyndham]] as Silvius\n* [[Jimmy Yuill]] as Corin\n}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released theatrically in Italy on 1 September 2006, in Greece on 7 September 2006, and in the UK on 21 September 2007.<ref name=mojo />\n\nIn the United States, [[HBO]] began airing the film on TV on the evening of 21 August 2007,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/19/entertainment/ca-branagh19|title=Keeping the best of the Bard within reach|last=King|first=Susan|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=19 August 2007|access-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> but it has never had a true theatrical release in the US, only occasional one-time showings, and most of these US showings took place after the film's television premiere.

This makes Kline the first actor to win a major US award for acting in one of Branagh's Shakespeare films, though some of his others have won critics' awards for the acting in them.\n\nLikewise, [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for Best Actress in a Made-for-TV Film or Miniseries, but did not win the award.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{TCMDb title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* [http://www.branaghcompendium.com/ayli_announcement.html September 1st 2006 \u2013 opening in Italy]\n\n{{Kenneth Branagh}}\n{{As You Like It}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2000s historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:American historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:British historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:British historical films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on As You Like It]]\n[[Category:Films about interracial romance]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kenneth Branagh]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Patrick Doyle]]\n[[Category:Films set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 19th century]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
