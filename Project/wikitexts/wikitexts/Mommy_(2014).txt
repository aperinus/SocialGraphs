The story concerns a mother with a sometimes-violent teenage son, struggling to control his behaviour in a desperate attempt to avoid seeing him being institutionalized.\n\nThe story focuses on mother\u2013son relationships, a reoccurring theme in Dolan's work, and also marks his fourth collaboration with Dorval and his third with Cl\u00e9ment. Inspiration for this particular story was drawn from Dolan's discovery of Pilon and the music of [[Ludovico Einaudi]]. It was shot in Quebec in an unconventional 1:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].\n\nThe film debuted at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]]. It subsequently became a critical and financial success, grossing over $13 million worldwide. ''Mommy'' went on to win numerous other awards, among them nine [[3rd Canadian Screen Awards|Canadian Screen Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a fictional outcome for the [[2015 Canadian federal election]], a political party comes to power and establishes a law called S-14. This legislation allows parents of troubled children and limited finances to place their children in hospitals, without regard for [[fundamental justice]].\n\nDiane \"Die\" Despr\u00e9s, a widowed mother and 46-year-old advice columnist, picks up her son Steve from an institution. Steve, who has [[ADHD]] and an [[attachment disorder]], was being discharged after starting a fire in which another youth was injured. Die brings Steve to their new home in [[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]] and struggles to care for him under financial distress. When Steve gives her a cart full of groceries and a necklace reading \"Mommy\", Die suspects that he has stolen the items. Enraged by the accusation, Steve begins choking her, and she defends herself by hitting him with a glass frame. Whilst chaos ensues, Kyla, a neighbour and teacher on sabbatical, shows up to tend to their wounds.\n\nKyla, who is dealing with a stuttering problem and recently moved into the area with her husband and daughter, begins to tutor Steve. After a disastrous tutoring session where Steve goads Kyla, she snaps and attacks him. After the confrontation, Steve mellows and indicates he is glad to know her and respects her boundaries and expectations. Kyla notes Steve reminds her of her late son. The three have bonded and their situation improves: Die has a cleaning job and translation work on the side, Kyla's speech problem is resolving, and Steve is receiving better marks on his school work. All is looking up, until Die is served papers by the parents of the injured boy, indicating she and Steve are being sued for the injuries caused by his fire.\n\nDie finds a lawyer, a neighbour and a potential love interest, who is willing to help them with Steve's case. The three of them go out to a karaoke restaurant for the evening. Over the night, Steve is increasingly agitated by the atmosphere and what he sees as his mother's sexual interest in the lawyer. Steve decides to sing, but is taunted by the audience, leading to a fight. They are thrown out. Steve, Die and their lawyer argue, ending with Die slapping the lawyer in retaliation for him slapping Steve, driving the lawyer away. Die in turn shouts at Steve for continually being an issue in her life, whereupon Steve runs away. He returns the following morning.\n\nDie continues to try and help her son and rebuild their lives, but while out shopping with Steve and Kyla, Steve disappears. He is found by Kyla after slitting his wrists. Although he survives, Die comes to realise she is running out of options. One day Die and Kyla surprise Steve with a picnic, and on the drive Die finds herself reflecting on all the dreams she had for her son to live a fulfilled, happy life. The trio end up not at a picnic site as the faux ending implies, but at a hospital to commit Steve under S-14. Upon realising the deception by the two women, Steve angrily resists attempts to apprehend him by hospital staff. Die begins to regret the decision when she helplessly watches the officials use violence and [[taser]]s to subdue him.\n\nKyla announces she is moving to [[Toronto]] and Die encourages her. Kyla is relieved Die is not upset. While explaining how much she enjoyed her time with Die and Steve, she accidentally makes a faux-pas about 'abandoning her family'. Die responds that she holds on to hope that her life and the life she envisages for her son will come to fruition. Kyla returns home as Die privately breaks down in tears. While preparing dinner and doing translation work, Die misses a phone call from Steve.\n\nBack at the hospital, Steve, restrained in a straitjacket, apologises to his mother in a voicemail. Immediately after the straps of his jacket are removed by two officials, Steve runs full speed towards a large, bright window.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anne Dorval]] as Diane \"Die\" Despr\u00e9s\n* [[Antoine Olivier Pilon]] as Steve Despr\u00e9s\n* [[Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment]] as Kyla\n* Alexandre Goyette as Patrick\n* [[Patrick Huard]] as Paul B\u00e9liveau\n* Steven Chevrin as older Steve<ref>{{cite tweet |user=xdolan |number=517232867005722624 |date=1 October 2014 |title=non.
