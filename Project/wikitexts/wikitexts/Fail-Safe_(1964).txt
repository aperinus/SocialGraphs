The film follows a crisis caused by a critical error that sends a group of U.S. bombers to destroy [[Moscow]], and the ensuing attempts to stop the bomber group before it can deploy a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|nuclear first strike]]. The film features performances by actors [[Henry Fonda]], [[Dan O'Herlihy]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Frank Overton]], [[Larry Hagman]], [[Fritz Weaver]], [[Dana Elcar]], [[Dom DeLuise]] and [[Sorrell Booke]].\n\nIn [[Fail Safe (2000 film)|2000, the novel was adapted again]] as a [[television play|televised play]] starring [[George Clooney]], [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Noah Wyle]], and broadcast live in black and white on [[CBS]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[United States Air Force]] General Black has been having recurring dreams in which a Spanish [[Bullfighter|matador]] kills a bull before a cheering crowd. Black flies to [[Washington, D.C.]] to attend a conference led by Dr. Groeteschele, a political scientist renowned for his expertise on the politics of nuclear weapons.\n\nGroeteschele is a fervent anti-communist. At a dinner party the evening before, he dismisses the fears that such a war would destroy the human race. To Groeteschele, nuclear war, like any other war, must have a victor and a loser, and the millions who might die in such a war are the price to be paid to end the Soviet threat.\n\nUSAF [[Distant Early Warning Line|early warning radar]] indicates that an unidentified aircraft has intruded into U.S. airspace. Shortly after, the intruder is identified as an off-course civilian airliner. However, a computer error causes one U.S. bomber group, Group 6, to erroneously receive apparently valid orders for a nuclear attack on [[Moscow]]. Attempts to rescind this order fail because a new Soviet countermeasure [[radio jamming|jams]] U.S. radio communications. Colonel Jack Grady, the group's commander, obeys the order, and Group 6 starts flying their \"Vindicator\" bombers over the Arctic towards Moscow.\n\nThe [[President of the United States]] attempts to recall the bombers or shoot them down. Groeteschele is called on to advise the President. Though the military \u2014 including Black \u2014 warns the President that the Soviets will retaliate with everything they have, Groeteschele insists that the Soviets will surrender when Group 6 reaches Moscow. U.S. fighters scramble to intercept the Vindicators but, using their [[afterburner]]s, they run out of fuel before they can reach Group 6 and plunge into the Arctic waters.\n\nCommunications are opened with the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]]. The jamming ceases, but the crew follows their training, dismissing the counter-orders as a Soviet ruse. General Bogan advises the Soviets on how to trigger the Vindicators' defense missiles. The President struggles to find a solution that will avert a [[nuclear holocaust]]. He orders a U.S. nuclear bomber to fly towards New York City to bomb it if necessary, trading the largest American city for the largest Soviet city, despite knowing that the [[FLOTUS|First Lady]] is there.\n\nThe Soviets destroy most of Group 6, but miss both Grady's plane and a second decoy plane, carrying only defensive weapons. The second plane draws Soviet aircraft away from Grady, despite Bogan's desperate pleas to the Soviets, allowing Grady to evade their defenses.\n\nThe Soviets, in desperation, fire all their weapons in the path of the remaining Vindicator.  As Grady nears Moscow, the Americans are finally able to reach him via radio. Both the President and Grady's own wife desperately urge him to break off the attack. As Grady wavers, a salvo of Soviet missiles targets his plane. Grady decoys them with the last of his defensive missiles, causing them to detonate far above him, though Grady knows that his crew has received a fatal dose of radiation. Grady dismisses the pleas as a trick.\n\nThe President remains in contact with the U.S. ambassador in Moscow until the telephone line abruptly cuts off with a loud squeal. He then orders General Black, whose wife and children live in New York City, to fly over the city and bomb it, using the [[Empire State Building]] as [[ground zero]]. After obeying, Black kills himself. As he dies, he calls out to his doomed wife telling her that he has at last learned the meaning of his recurring dream: \"The Matador, the Matador ... me ... me.\"\n\nThe last moments of the film show images of people in New York going about their daily lives, unaware of the coming disaster, followed by freeze-frames of their faces as the nuclear bomb explodes.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Edward Binns in Fail-Safe trailer.jpg|thumb|Edward Binns as Colonel Jack Grady (right)]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as the President of the United States\n* [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as Brigadier General Warren A. \"Blackie\" Black, USAF\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Professor Groeteschele\n* [[Frank Overton]] as General Bogan, USAF\n* [[Fritz Weaver]] as Colonel Cascio, USAF\n* [[Edward Binns]] as Colonel Jack Grady, USAF\n* [[Larry Hagman]] as Buck, the President's interpreter\n* [[William Hansen (actor)|William Hansen]] as Defense Secretary Swenson\n* [[Russell Hardie]] as General Stark\n* [[Russell Collins]] as Gordon Knapp\n* [[Sorrell Booke]] as Congressman Raskob\n* [[Nancy Berg]] as Ilsa Woolfe\n* [[John Connell (actor)|John Connell]] as Thomas\n* Frank Simpson as Sullivan\n* [[Hildy Parks]] as Betty Black\n* [[Janet Ward]] as Helen Grady\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Master Sergeant Collins, USAF\n* [[Dana Elcar]] as Mr. Foster\n* Stewart Germain as Mr. Cascio\n* Louise Larabee as Mrs. Cascio\n* Frieda Altman as Mrs. Jennie Johnson\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in black and white, in a dramatic, theatrical style with claustrophobic close-ups, sharp shadows and ponderous silences between several characters. Except for radio background during a scene at an Air Force base in [[Alaska]], there is no original music score (only the electronic sound effects act as the film's main and end title music). With few exceptions, the action takes place largely in the [[White House]] underground bunker, the Pentagon war conference room, the SAC war room, and a single bomber cockpit (a \"Vindicator bomber\"). Shots of normal daily life are seen only after the title opening credits and in the final scene depicting an ordinary New York City day, its residents entirely unsuspecting of their imminent destruction, each scene ending with a [[freeze-frame shot]] at the moment of impact.\n\nThe character of Groeteschele was inspired, according to Lumet's audio commentary on the film, by military strategist [[Herman Kahn]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/05/shut-in-movie-club-fail-safe-coronavirus|title = Watching Fail Safe at the End of the World|website = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date = 8 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Vindicator\" bombers (an invention of the novelists) are sometimes represented in the film with [[stock footage]] of [[Convair B-58 Hustler]]s. Fighters sent to attack the bombers are illustrated by film clips of the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]], [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger]], [[Dassault Mirage III]] and [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]]. Stock footage was used because the Air Force declined to cooperate in the production, disliking the premise of a lack of control over nuclear strike forces.<ref name=\"Strategy\">[http://www.strategypage.com/moviereviews/default.asp?target=Fail%20Safe \"Fail-Safe (Reviews).\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012171023/http://www.strategypage.com/moviereviews/default.asp?target=Fail%20Safe |date=2012-10-12 }} ''strategypage.com.'' Retrieved: September 5, 2012.</ref> The scene depicting bombers taking off was stock footage of a single B-58 takeoff edited to look like several bombers taking off in succession. A nightmare quality is imparted to many of the flying sequences by depicting the planes in [[Negative (photography)|photographic negative]]. In several of the negative sequences the \"Soviet interceptors\" were actually French-built Mirage fighters with Israeli markings.\n\n==Reception==\nWhen ''Fail Safe'' opened in October 1964, it garnered excellent reviews, but its box office performance was poor. Its failure rested with the similarity between it and the [[nuclear war]] satire ''Dr. Strangelove'', which had appeared in theaters first, in January 1964. Still, the film later was applauded as a Cold War thriller. The novel sold through to the 1980s and 1990s, and the film was given high marks for retaining the essence of the novel.<ref>Erickson, Hal.
