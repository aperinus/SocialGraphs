'''''Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N.''''' in the UK, \"R.N.\" standing for \"[[Royal Navy]]\") is a 1951 British naval [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] [[war film]] in [[Technicolor]] from [[Warner Bros.]], produced by Gerry Mitchell, directed by [[Raoul Walsh]], that stars [[Gregory Peck]], [[Virginia Mayo]], [[Robert Beatty]] and [[Terence Morgan]].\n\nThe film is based on three of [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] novels: ''[[The Happy Return]]'' (1937), ''[[A Ship of the Line]]'' (1938), and ''[[Flying Colours (novel)|Flying Colours]]'' (1938). Forester is credited with the screen adaptation.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1807, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Royal Navy]] Captain [[Horatio Hornblower]] commands the 38-gun [[frigate]] HMS ''Lydia'' on a secret mission to [[Central America]]. He is to provide arms and support to a [[wikt:megalomania|megalomania]]c named Don Julian Alvarado, who calls himself \"El Supremo\" (\"The Almighty\"), in his rebellion against Spain, an ally of Britain's enemy [[First French Empire|France]].\n\nUpon arrival, Hornblower is told that a larger, much more powerful Spanish warship, the 60-gun ''Natividad'', has been sighted. When it anchors nearby, Hornblower and his crew board and capture it in a surprise night attack. He then reluctantly hands the ship over to Alvarado to appease the madman, and they go their separate ways.\n\nLater, he encounters a small Spanish vessel and learns that Spain has switched sides, so the ''Lydia'' will have to attack the ''Natividad'' again. Two passengers transfer to the ''Lydia'' (over Hornblower's strenuous objections): Lady Barbara Wellesley and her maid, fleeing a [[yellow fever]] epidemic. As Lady Barbara is the (fictitious) sister of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], Hornblower cannot refuse her request for passage to England.\n\nUsing superior seamanship and masterful tactics, Hornblower sinks the more powerful ''Natividad''. When the ship's surgeon is killed during the battle, Lady Barbara insists on tending the wounded. When she later falls gravely ill, Hornblower nurses her back to health. On the voyage back to England, they fall in love. However, when she speaks of her feelings (although she is engaged), Hornblower gently tells her he is married. Later they meet in a passageway and embrace passionately. She promises her maid's discretion, but he says that they are not free.\n\nAfter arriving home, Hornblower learns that his wife has died in childbirth, leaving him an infant son. Later, he is given command of the ''Sutherland'', a [[Seventy-four (ship)|74-gun]] [[ship of the line]] captured from the French, and is assigned to a squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Leighton. Leighton has just returned from his honeymoon with Lady Barbara. Outside the Admiralty, Lady Barbara tells Hornblower that she did not learn of his wife\u2019s death until she returned from Ireland. Leighton's squadron is to help enforce the British [[blockade]] of France.\n\nHornblower learns that four [[French Navy|French]] ships of the line have broken through the blockade. Leighton assumes they will make for the Mediterranean, but Hornblower suggests that they mean to support [[Napoleon]]'s [[Peninsular War|campaign on the Iberian Peninsula]]. Leighton decides to cover both possibilities by detaching one ship to patrol the French coast. When he learns that Hornblower's ''Sutherland'' is best suited for this task, having the shallowest [[draft (hull)|draught]], he accuses Hornblower of pursuing glory and [[prize money#Royal Navy prize money|prize money]] and expressly forbids Hornblower's taking any independent action if he sights the French.\n\nHornblower's French-built ship is subsequently mistaken for a friendly vessel by a small French [[brig]], which flies the enemy's recognition signal for the day. After capturing the vessel, Hornblower learns from its captain that he was transporting supplies to the four warships for use in Spain. Rather than return to the squadron, Hornblower enters the enemy harbour where the French ships are anchored and guarded by a well-armed fort. By flying a French flag and the recognition signal and taking advantage of his ship's French design, Hornblower fools the garrison into believing that the ''Sutherland'' is friendly. His gun crews [[Mast (sailing)|dismast]] all four enemy ships before cannon fire from the fort forces the British to abandon ship. Hornblower [[Scuttling|scuttles]] his ship in the channel, bottling up the French ships.\n\nAs the rest of the British squadron arrives to complete the job, Hornblower, First Lieutenant Bush, and seaman Quist are taken by carriage to Paris to be tried for [[piracy]]. They escape en route and make their way to the port of [[Nantes]]. Disguised as [[Netherlands|Dutch]] officers, they board the ''Witch of Endor'', a captured British ship. They overpower the [[skeleton crew]], free a working party of British [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] to man her, and sail to England.\n\nHornblower is hailed as a national hero and learns that Leighton was killed in the battle against the French ships. Hornblower returns home to visit his young son and finds Lady Barbara there. The two embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gregory Peck]] as Captain [[Horatio Hornblower]], R.N.\n*[[Virginia Mayo]] as Lady Barbara Wellesley\n*[[Robert Beatty]] as First Lieutenant William Bush\n*[[Terence Morgan]] as Second Lieutenant Gerard\n*[[Moultrie Kelsall]] as Third Lieutenant Crystal\n*James Kenney as Midshipman Longley\n*[[James Robertson Justice]] as Seaman Quist\n*[[Denis O'Dea]] as Rear Admiral Sir Rodney Leighton\n*[[Richard Hearne]] as Polwheal\n*[[Michael J.

Warner's was already building up [[Burt Lancaster]] as their new swashbuckling screen star, but the role of a British sea captain seemed to be outside his range, so Peck was ultimately cast on a loan-out from [[David O. Selznick]], who received screen credit in the opening titles. Virginia Mayo was only cast after a number of high-profile British actresses were either not free or not interested.

Instead of moving the horizon background in order to simulate movement on the water, the ship itself was rocked. This caused many problems because of the combined weight of ship, crew and equipment. The Italian [[brigantine]] ''Marcel B.
