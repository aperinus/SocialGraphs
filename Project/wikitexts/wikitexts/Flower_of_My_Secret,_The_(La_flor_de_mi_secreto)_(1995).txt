Unable to contact her housekeeper, she tracks down her best friend, Betty, who removes the boots. Betty later encourages Leo, who is a writer, to contact Betty's friend \u00c1ngel, an editor at ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'', and ask for a job writing about literature as a distraction. \u00c1ngel and Leo get along well, but when he asks her to review a new [[anthology]] of works by Amanda Gris, a popular writer of romance novels, she refuses and leaves his office.\n\n\u00c1ngel calls Leo to tell her he has read the pieces she gave him as examples of her writing and wants to publish one of her essays. Excited, she wants to talk to Paco, but her call wakes him up and he accuses her of being drunk before she can relay her news.\n\nLeo meets with her publishers to discuss her newest manuscript. They tell her it is unsuitably dark for an Amanda Gris novel and remind her that she is contractually obliged to write five romance novels each year with happy endings and without any social conscience, to be published [[pseudonym]]ously, at Leo's request. The publishers threaten to sue her for [[breach of contract]] if she does not submit something in the required style, but she says she cannot write like that anymore. Frustrated, Leo writes an article belittling Amanda Gris and submits it to \u00c1ngel, who publishes it.\n\nPaco comes home on what is supposed to be a 24-hour leave, but when he arrives, he is aloof and says he has to leave in two hours to go to [[Split, Croatia|Split]].{{efn|The part of the plot dealing with Paco's visit has similarities to [[Dorothy Parker]]'s short story ''The Lovely Leave''.<ref name=\"about1\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-26/entertainment/ca-51499_1_pedro-almodovar.htm |title=Pedro Almodovar, Tempted by Austerity |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1996-03-26 |access-date=2015-08-06}}</ref> When Leo first meets \u00c1ngel, she mentions that Parker is one of her favourite writers.}} Leo becomes hysterical and Paco accuses her of being selfish, resulting in an argument, during which all of the problems in their relationship that they had agreed to forget about until the conflict in Bosnia was over resurface. As Paco is leaving, Leo asks if there is any chance at saving their marriage. He says there is not. Left alone, Leo takes half of a bottle of tranquilizers.\n\nLeo is awoken by the sound of her mother leaving a message on her [[answering machine]]. She vomits up the pills and wanders into the streets, where she bumps into \u00c1ngel. When she wakes up in his apartment the next day, she learns that, in her compromised state, she told him that she is Amanda Gris. He agrees to keep her secret, so long as she does not try to kill herself again.\n\nOnce home, Leo finds Betty waiting for her. Betty tells Leo that she and Paco had been having an affair, but she ended it the previous night when Paco came to see her following his argument with Leo. Leo's mother calls again to complain about Leo's sister, Rosa, with whom she lives, and say she is moving back to their old [[Almagro, Ciudad Real|village]]; Leo decides to go with her.\n\nLeo spends some time resting and reconnecting with her roots. One day, one of her publishers calls to say how pleased the firm is with Leo's two newest Amanda Gris novels. Somewhat bemused, Leo calls \u00c1ngel to ask if he wrote and submitted the works on her behalf. He says he did and, later, agrees to write the rest of the books on Leo's contract.\n\nBack in [[Madrid]], after attending a dance performance created by Antonio, the son of her housekeeper, who danced in it with his mother, Leo returns to her apartment. Antonio stops by and tells her that he had taken advantage of her recent forgetfulness to steal some of her belongings to finance his show, among them a copy of her rejected novel, which is being made into a film. Leo, who had been worried she was losing her mind, like several of her female relatives before her, muses about the paradoxes of life and surprises Antonio by thanking him for giving meaning to her darkest months.{{efn|Presumably by making them the source of something beautiful (''i.e.'', his and his mother's dance).}} Revitalized, she visits \u00c1ngel and, pretending it is [[New Year's Eve]], they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marisa Paredes]] as Leo Mac\u00edas\n* [[Juan Echanove]] as \u00c1ngel, an editor at ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]''\n* [[Carme El\u00edas]] as Betty, Leo's friend\n* [[Rossy de Palma]] as Rosa, Leo's sister\n* [[Chus Lampreave]] as Leo's mother\n* [[Kiti Manver]] as Manuela, a nurse who works with Betty\n* [[Joaqu\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]] as Antonio, Blanca's son\n* [[Manuela Vargas (flamenco dancer)|Manuela Vargas]] as Blanca, Leo's housekeeper\n* [[Imanol Arias]] as Paco, Leo's husband\n* [[Gloria Mu\u00f1oz (actress)|Gloria Mu\u00f1oz]] as Alicia, Leo's publisher\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website\u00a0[[Rotten Tomatoes]],\u00a0the film\u00a0holds an approval rating of 85% based on 26 reviews, with an average score of 7/10.

Also, the title of the essay by Leo that \u00c1ngel wants to publish in ''El Pa\u00eds'' is \"Pain and Life\", which resembles \"Pain and Glory\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.2filmcritics.com/post/pain-and-glory|title=Pain and Glory (Dolor y Gloria) \u2605\u2605\u2605|date=16 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Spanish films of 1995]]\n* [[List of submissions to the 68th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Spanish submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_n4_v26/ai_18268107/print Interview with Pedro Almod\u00f3var about The Flower of My Secret]\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-26/entertainment/ca-51499_1_pedro-almodovar LA Times article on The Flower of My secret]\n\n{{Pedro Almod\u00f3var}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flower of My Secret}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Ciby 2000 films]]\n[[Category:El Deseo films]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Pedro Almod\u00f3var]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Agust\u00edn Almod\u00f3var]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Alberto Iglesias]]\n[[Category:Films set in Castilla\u2013La Mancha]]\n[[Category:Films set in Madrid]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Madrid]]\n[[Category:French drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language French films]]"}]}}}}
