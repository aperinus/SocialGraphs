An international co-production of Italy, France, and the United Kingdom, the film stars [[Chris Isaak]], [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Prince Siddhartha]] (the [[Buddha]] before his enlightenment).\n\n==Plot==\nTibetan Buddhist monks from a monastery in [[Bhutan]], led by [[Lama]] Norbu, are searching for a child who is the [[tulku|rebirth]] of a great Buddhist teacher, Lama [[Dorje]]. Lama Norbu and his fellow monks believe they have found a candidate for the child in whom Lama Dorje is [[rebirth (Buddhism)|reborn]]: an American boy named Jesse Conrad, the young son of an architect and a teacher who live in [[Seattle]]. The monks come to Seattle in order to meet the boy.\n\nJesse is fascinated with the monks and their way of life, but his parents, Dean and Lisa, are wary, and that wariness turns into near-hostility when Norbu announces that he wants to take Jesse back with him to Bhutan to be tested. Dean changes his mind, however, when one of his close friends and colleagues commits suicide because he went broke. Dean then decides to travel to Bhutan with Jesse. In [[Nepal]], two children who are also candidates for the rebirth are encountered, Raju and Gita.\n\nGradually, over the course of the movie, first Jesse's mother and then Lama Norbu tell the life story of Prince Siddhartha, reading from a book that Lama Norbu has given to Jesse.\n\nIn ancient Nepal ([[Lumbini]]), a prince called [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] turns his back on his comfortable and protected life, and sets out on a journey to solve the problem of universal suffering. As he progresses, he learns profound truths about the nature of life, [[consciousness]], and [[reality]]. Ultimately, he battles [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] (a [[demon]] representing the ego), who repeatedly tries to divert and destroy Siddhartha. Through the final complete realization of the illusory nature of his own ego, Siddhartha attains [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and becomes the Buddha.\n\nIn the final scenes of the movie, it is found that all three children are rebirths of Lama Dorje, separate manifestations of his body (Raju), speech (Gita), and mind (Jesse). A ceremony is held and Jesse's father also learns some of the essential truths of [[Buddhism]]. His work finished, Lama Norbu enters a deep state of [[meditation]] and dies. As the funeral ceremony begins, Lama Norbu speaks to the children, seemingly from a higher plane, telling them to have compassion; and just before the credits roll the children are seen distributing his ashes.\n\nAt the very end of the film credits, the [[sand mandala]] that was seen being constructed during the movie is destroyed, \"with one swift stroke.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Lisa Conrad\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Siddhartha\n* [[Chris Isaak]] as Dean Conrad\n* [[Ying Ruocheng]] as Lama Norbu\n* Alex Wiesendanger as Jesse Conrad\n* Raju Lal as Raju\n* Greishma Makar Singh as Gita\n* [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] as Kenpo Tenzin\n* Ven.

[[Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche]] appears near the end of the film, when Lama Norbu is shown meditating overnight, and as a consultant, supervised every gesture and ritual performed by Tibetan monks.
