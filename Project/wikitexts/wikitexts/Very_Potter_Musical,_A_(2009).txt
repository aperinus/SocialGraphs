Headmaster of Hogwarts [[Albus Dumbledore]] welcomes everyone back, skips the Sorting Ceremony and introduces the House Cup Tournament, in which a champion will be chosen on behalf of each House ([[Hogwarts#Gryffindor|Gryffindor]], [[Hogwarts#Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw]], [[Hogwarts#Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff]], and [[Hogwarts#Slytherin|Slytherin]]) to fight for the House Cup.\n\nThe names are chosen out of a magical trophy by Potions Master, [[Severus Snape]], with Harry being chosen for Gryffindor. The other champions are his crush [[Dumbledore's Army#Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] (Ravenclaw), her current boyfriend [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] (Hufflepuff) and Harry's obnoxious rival, [[Draco Malfoy]] (Slytherin). Hermione then voices her concern about the bloodstained history of the House Cup Tournament but no one can drop out due to the enchantment on the trophy from which the names were drawn. Draco attempts to intimidate Harry by claiming that he will transfer to a prestigious wizarding academy on [[Mars]] called Pigfarts and presided over by Headmaster Rumbleroar, a talking lion, but Hermione threatens him and forces him to back off.\n\nMeanwhile, Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher [[Hogwarts staff#Quirinus Quirrell|Quirinus Quirrell]] is secretly conspiring to revive the evil wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who is parasitically attached to the back of his head after Voldemort's previous defeat by an infant Harry Potter. They bicker about this arrangement, which causes inconvenience to both of them due to their conflicting personalities (\"Different As Can Be\").\n\nHarry convinces Hermione to do all of his school work for him while he writes a love song intended to win the heart of Cho Chang. He tests out the song on Ron's younger sister [[Dumbledore's Army#Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] (\"Ginny's Song\"), while being oblivious to Ginny's own crush on him. Harry, Ron and Hermione use his [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Harry's Cloak of Invisibility|Cloak of Invisibility]] to sneak off and investigate what the first round of the House Cup Tournament could entail, leaving Ginny alone to lament her unrequited love (\"Harry\").\n\nVoldemort convinces Quirrell to go out and celebrate the progress of their evil plan instead of grading papers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione discover that the first round will involve dragons, while also eavesdropping on a conversation by Malfoy that hints at an unrealised crush on Hermione. Voldemort and Quirrell return from a night of drunken escapades, reminiscing on past events and how they have become good friends from their time spent (literally) together (\"Different As Can Be (Reprise)\").\n\nHarry continues to neglect his preparation for the tournament, and is caught completely off-guard when he is forced to face a deadly Hungarian Horntail in battle, initially having been lulled into a false sense of security as his competitors are allotted dragons such as 'Puff the Magic Dragon'. With no other choice, Harry summons his guitar and [[serenade]]s the dragon into submission, allowing him to move on to the next round of the competition (\"The Dragon Song\").\n\nThe annual Yule Ball is announced, and Ginny attempts to ask Harry to be her partner. Unfortunately, Harry is dead set on asking Cho and unknowingly rejects Ginny, causing her to run off in tears. Harry plays his song for Cho (\"Ginny's Song Reprise (Cho's Song)\") but is rejected because Cho has already agreed to go with Cedric, leaving him and Ron as the only two male students without partners. Quirrell relieves Voldemort of his worries surrounding their master plan as the two weigh the pros and cons of their upcoming physical separation. Voldemort realises he has become close with Quirrell, and that he wishes to remain his friend.\n\nAt the Yule Ball, the normally-unattractive Hermione suddenly shows up with a gorgeous makeover, causing Ron and Malfoy to suddenly realise their feelings for her (\"Granger Danger\"). Harry develops an attraction to Ginny and asks her to dance, leaving Ron to get \"drunk\" on Butterbeer and fight over Hermione with Malfoy, causing her to lash out at both of them. Harry pulls back from a kiss with Ginny, stating that they cannot be together because of his friendship with Ron. Ginny leaves in tears and a flustered Harry attempts to regain his dignity by cutting in with Cho, causing him to get into a fight with Cedric. As the guys argue over who will get a thirsty Cho a glass of punch, they both grab the enchanted ladle that Quirrell had planted earlier, teleporting them to a mysterious graveyard.\n\nQuirrell appears, killing Cedric with the [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] and using the full Body-Bind curse on Harry. Snape then appears; while Quirrell and Voldemort submerge themselves in a large cauldron, Snape uses his own hand and Harry's blood to complete a ritual that successfully revives Voldemort, who joyfully celebrates with his Death Eaters (\"To Dance Again!\"). Death Eater [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] arrives to welcome back her master and former lover, and reveals their plan was to use Quirrell as a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] for the murder of Harry. Heartbroken at the betrayal of their friendship, Quirrell falls out with Voldemort and is taken to [[Places in Harry Potter#Azkaban|Azkaban]]. Before Voldemort can kill Harry, Harry manages to use the ladle to escape back to Hogwarts, where he exclaims in horror that Voldemort has returned.\n\n===Act II===\n\nThe Ministry of Magic doesn't believe that Voldemort's back, \ndespite proof such as Voldemort's new vlog and his review of [[17 Again (film)|17 Again]], with the star [[Zac Efron]]. Meanwhile, Harry, consumed by the stress this situation is causing him, pushes his friends away by acting egocentric. Malfoy tries to make fun of Harry, but he's once more humiliated in front of the student body and he promises revenge. Ginny tries to make sense of her relationship with Harry, but he explains to her that as long as Voldemort is around, they can't be together because he wants to protect her. When Ginny runs away in tears, Dumbledore in disguise calls Harry to his office to discuss about Voldemort.\n\nSnape reveals himself as a Death Eater under cover and meets up with Voldemort, who's in a deep depression after his fight with Quirrell. Snape introduces Draco Malfoy to the Dark Lord, who informs him about a secret passage leading to Hogwarts in exchange for a rocket to Mars (\u201cPigfarts, Pigfarts, Here I Come\u201d). Voldemort makes Draco sign a magical contract to make him kill Dumbledore. Harry, Ron and Hermione get to Dumbledore's office for the meeting. There, Dumbledore explains that Voldemort possesses some [[Horcrux]]es that make him immortal as long as they exist, he reveals that he has already destroyed five of the six Horcruxes and tells Harry to find the last one, hidden right there in Hogwarts. At that moment, the Death Eaters break into Dumbledore's office and arrest him. Malfoy is ready to follow through his part of the deal, but after a speech from Dumbledore he finds himself unable to give him the final blow. Snape takes the initiative and kills Dumbledore, traumatising Harry who declares he has to kill Voldemort on his own.\n\nVoldemort successfully takes over the Ministry of Magic, but he's still sad about the loss of Quirrell. Voldemort, Quirrell and Harry lament all the people they lost (\u201cMissing You\u201d). After that, a Death Eater informs Voldemort that Hogwarts has fallen, and Voldemort gets ready to leave for Hogwarts.\n\nGinny finds Harry and tries to convince him that he has the power to save everyone, but Harry is pessimistic and he complains about all the unrealistic expectations and the pressure on him for being the \u201cBoy Who Lived\u201d. Ginny reassures him that he's not alone in his fight against evil (\u201cNot Alone\u201d) and he makes up with Ron and Hermione. With Malfoy's help, who regretted his choices, Harry and Ron go to Dumbledore's office to destroy the last Horcrux, while Ginny and Hermione try to contact the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|\nOrder of the Phoenix]]. Before they separate, Ron apologises to Hermione for his behaviour at the Yule Ball and the two share a passionate kiss.\n\nHarry, Ron and Malfoy find out that the last Horcrux is Zac Efron's poster that Dumbledore kept in his office. The Horcrux tries to turn Ron against Harry by taking the form of Voldemort and Hermione and relying on his insecurities. Ron fights against it and destroys the Horcrux, rekindling his friendship with Harry.\n\nA group of Death Eaters led by Bellatrix arrives in the office, after having captured Ginny and Hermione. Snape is revealed to be Dumbledore's agent and tries to save the students, but Bellatrix kills him. At that moment Ginny and Ron's mother, [[Molly Weasley]] (Lily Marks) intervenes and kills Bellatrix. With his last breath, Snape reveals that Harry became a seventh Horcrux the night his parents died.\n\nVoldemort has arrived at Hogwarts and demands that the student body delivers Harry to him in exchange for their lives. Harry realises that he has to die to save everyone else and he turns himself in to Voldemort, who kills him. In a realm between life and death, Harry meets Dumbledore, who explains to him that by killing Harry Voldemort involuntarily destroyed his seventh Horcrux. Dumbledore makes Harry return to the world of the living before leaving for Pigfarts riding Rumbleroar, the lion who acts as Headmaster at the Mars school.\n\nRon and Hermione gather the other Hogwarts students and convince them to fight because that's what Harry would have done (\u201cVoldemort is Goin\u2019 Down\u201d). When Harry shows himself still alive, everybody cheers, but Voldemort bursts into the room, shocked that Harry isn't dead. Harry explains that his sacrifice made the Hogwarts\u2019 students immune to Voldemort's magic, and that Voldemort's disregard about other people is eventually going to be his demise. Voldemort tries the Avada Kedavra curse, but Harry counterattacks the spell and kills him.\n\nThe student body celebrates Voldemort's death, and [[Neville Longbottom]] (Richard Campbell) finds Dumbledore's will in which the Headmaster awards Gryffindor with the House Cup and nominates Harry as the new Headmaster. Harry kisses Ginny after Ron gives them his blessing, and all the students throw a party.\n\nAt Azkaban, Quirrell hears about Voldemort's death and he's devastated. However, the last residue of Voldemort's soul comes to make amends with Quirrell, and the two gloriously reunite (\u201cNot Alone (Reprise)/Goin\u2019 Back to Hogwarts (Reprise)\u201d).\n\n==Cast and characters==\n<ref name=\"website\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character\n!University of Michigan<br><small>2009</small>\n|-\n![[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]\n|[[Darren Criss]]\n|-\n![[Ron Weasley]]\n|Joey Richter\n|-\n![[Hermione Granger]]\n|Bonnie Gruesen\n|-\n![[Dumbledore's Army#Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]\n|Jaime Lyn Beatty\n|-\n![[Draco Malfoy]]\n|Lauren Lopez\n|-\n![[Lord Voldemort]]\n|Joe Walker\n|-\n![[Albus Dumbledore]]\n|Dylan Saunders\n|-\n![[Hogwarts staff#Quirinus Quirrell|Quirinus Quirrell]]\n|Brian Rosenthal\n|-\n![[Severus Snape]]\n|Joe Moses\n|-\n![[Bellatrix Lestrange]]\n|Britney Coleman\n|-\n![[Cedric Diggory]] / [[Ministry of Magic#Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]]\n|Tyler Brunsman\n|-\n![[Dumbledore's Army#Cho Chang|Cho Chang]]\n|Devin Lytle\n|-\n![[Neville Longbottom]]\n|Richard Campbell\n|-\n![[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Crabbe and Goyle|Vincent Crabbe]]\n|Julia Albain\n|-\n![[Dumbledore's Army#Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]]<br>\n|Sango Tajima\n|-\n![[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Crabbe and Goyle|Gregory Goyle]]<br>\n|Jim Povolo\n|-\n![[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]] / [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)#Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley]]\n|Lily Marks\n|}\n'''Notes'''\n\n[[A.
