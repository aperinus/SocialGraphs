In 2000, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] premiered a one-hour [[Soul Food (TV series)|television series based upon the film]]. In 2015, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] is planning a sequel for film called ''More Soul Food'', written by Tillman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/soul-food-sequel-works-at-827318|title='Soul Food' Sequel in the Works at Fox 2000 (Exclusive)|author=Rebecca Ford|date=29 September 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''Soul Food,'' told through the eyes of 11-year-old [[Soul Food (TV series)|Ahmad]] (Hammond), follows the trials of the Joseph family, a close-knit [[Chicago]] family that gets together to have Sunday dinner every week, with plenty of [[soul food]] to go around. [[Josephine Joseph (Soul Food)|Mother (Big Mama) Joe]] (Hall) has three daughters, who each have had varying success in life: oldest daughter [[Soul Food (TV series)|Teri]] (Williams) has become a successful lawyer, but has a strained relationship with younger sister [[Soul Food (TV series)|Maxine]] (Fox), Ahmad's mother, who stole and eventually married Teri's former boyfriend, [[Soul Food (TV series)|Kenny]] (Sams). Teri is currently married to Miles (Beach), a lawyer who quits his job to pursue his dream of being an [[R&B]] musician, which Teri doesn't support. Youngest daughter Robin (Long)\u2014nicknamed [[Soul Food (TV series)|\"Bird\"]]\u2014has just opened a [[barber]]shop/[[beauty salon|beauty parlor]], and married [[Soul Food (TV series)|Lem]] (Phifer), an ex-convict.\n\nLife becomes complicated when Mother Joe, the diabetic but wise and caring matriarch of the family and the glue that holds it together, suffers a debilitating [[stroke]] during an operation to [[Amputation|amputate]] her leg and slips into a [[coma]], dying shortly after sharing a last word of advice with Ahmad when she awakens five weeks later. Without her guidance, the family begins to fall apart in the interim. Teri takes in her troubled cousin Faith (Ravera), who bonds with Miles over a love of the arts. The two have an affair and are caught having sex by Teri, which later leads to a near-violent confrontation at Kenny and Maxine's anniversary party when she furiously comes after the two with a knife. Meanwhile, Lem cannot find a job due to his criminal record, so Bird makes an uneasy deal with her former boyfriend Simuel St. James ([[Mel Jackson]]) to get Lem a job. This creates tension between Lem and Bird when he finds out, and in one of their arguments, Teri overhears and mistakenly believes Lem was physically threatening her sister. Teri hires her cousin Blimp to teach Lem a lesson, but when the two men fight, which ends with Lem pulling a gun, the police become involved and Lem is arrested on assault and illegal gun possession charges.\n\nRealizing her mistake, Teri calls in a few favors to have Lem released and later apologizes to him. Kenny and Maxine refuse to live within their means and constantly borrow money from Teri without paying it back, which causes even more tension between the sisters; the fighting between Teri and Maxine soon causes the Sunday dinners to stop and the Joseph family tradition to be broken after forty years due to the ongoing tensions. Everything comes to a head when, after Teri decides to sell the Joseph family home rather than get stuck with most of her mother's hospital bills, Maxine and Bird file an injunction to stop the sale, setting the stage for a major legal battle within the family. Throughout all this, Ahmad becomes worried about the state of his extended family and, following Big Mama's passing, conspires to find a way to bring them all back together.\n\nAhmad tells his relatives about a stash of money that Big Mama had hidden away some time ago but everyone dismisses him, believing it to be a myth. However, Ahmad manages to get everyone together for another Sunday dinner by promising them the whereabouts of the money. The dinner is uneasy as everyone starts confronting their issues, and eventually they come to realize there is no money. Maxine chastises her son for lying, but Ahmad says tearfully that it was the only way to get everyone back together again, citing it as Big Mama's dying wish. As Maxine comforts her son, the kitchen accidentally catches on fire, and they all work together to try and to put it out. Just as they finish putting the fire out, Uncle Pete, Big Mama's brother, comes down with his television and drops it to reveal the money that Big Mama had hidden away.\n\nThings start to go well for the family. Miles still comes by for Sunday dinner even though he and Teri are divorcing; Lem and Bird are expecting their first child, Teri and Maxine have made peace and the former opts to not sell the family house. Faith is finally becoming part of the family again and Uncle Pete, who never came out of his room, starts to join the family.\n\n==Main cast==\n* [[Vanessa Williams]] as Teri\n* [[Vivica A.
