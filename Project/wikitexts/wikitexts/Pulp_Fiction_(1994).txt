The title refers to the [[pulp magazine]]s and [[hardboiled]] crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.\n\nTarantino wrote ''Pulp Fiction'' in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for ''[[True Romance]]'' (1993). Its plot occurs [[Nonlinear narrative|out of chronological order]]. The film is also [[self-reference|self-referential]] from its opening moments, beginning with a [[Intertitle|title card]] that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an [[Irony|ironic]] combination of humor and strong violence. [[TriStar Pictures]] reportedly turned down the script as \"too demented\". [[Miramax]] co-chairman [[Harvey Weinstein]] was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax fully financed.\n\n''Pulp Fiction'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]], and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the [[67th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]; it earned Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman Academy Award nominations and boosted their careers.

There are seven narrative sequences; the three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles:\n# \"Prologue&nbsp;\u2013 The Diner\" (i)\n# Prelude to \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\"\n# \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\"\n# Prelude to \"The Gold Watch\" (a&nbsp;\u2013 flashback, b&nbsp;\u2013 present)\n# \"The Gold Watch\"\n# \"The Bonnie Situation\"\n# \"Epilogue&nbsp;\u2013 The Diner\" (ii)\n\nIf the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5.

See WP:FILMPLOT. -->\nHitmen Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's associates. He declaims a [[Ezekiel 25#Verse 17|passage from the Bible]], and he and Vincent kill Brett for trying to double-cross Marsellus. They take the briefcase to Marsellus and wait while he bribes boxer Butch Coolidge to [[Match fixing|take a dive]] in his upcoming match.\n\nThe next day, Vincent purchases [[heroin]] from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and drives to meet Marsellus's wife, Mia, having agreed to escort her while Marsellus is out of town. They eat at Jack Rabbit Slim's, a [[Theme restaurant|1950s-themed restaurant]], and participate in a [[Twist (dance)|twist]] contest, then return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin and snorts it, mistaking it for [[cocaine]]. She suffers an [[drug overdose|overdose]]; Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where they revive her with an injection of [[adrenaline]] into her heart. Vincent drops Mia off at her home, and the two agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident.\n\nButch bets the bribe money on himself and double-crosses Marsellus, winning the bout but accidentally killing his opponent as well. Knowing that Marsellus will send hitmen after him, he prepares to flee with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers she has forgotten to pack a gold watch passed down to him through his family. Returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a suppressed [[MAC-10]] on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. When Vincent exits the bathroom, Butch shoots him dead and departs.\n \nWhen Marsellus spots Butch stopped at a traffic light, Butch rams his car into him, leaving both of them injured and dazed. Once Marsellus regains consciousness, he shoots at Butch, chasing him into a [[pawnshop]]. Butch gains the upper hand and is about to shoot Marsellus, but the shop owner, Maynard, captures them at gunpoint and binds and gags them in the basement. Maynard and his accomplice Zed take Marsellus into another room and begin to rape him, leaving the \"gimp\" \u2013 a silent figure in a [[bondage suit]] \u2013 to watch over Butch. Butch breaks loose and knocks the gimp unconscious. Instead of fleeing, he decides to save Marsellus, and arms himself with a [[katana]] from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who shoots Zed in the crotch with Maynard's shotgun. Marsellus informs Butch that they are even, and to tell no one about the rape and to depart Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's [[Chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]], and they ride away.\n\nEarlier, after Vincent and Jules have killed Brett in his apartment, another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them, but every shot misses; after briefly checking themselves for wounds, Jules and Vincent shoot him dead. While driving away with Brett's associate Marvin, Jules professes that their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes. Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face, killing him, and covering Vincent, Jules, and the car interior in blood in broad daylight. They hide the car at the home of Jules's friend Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife, Bonnie, comes home. Marsellus sends a [[Fixer (person)|cleaner]], Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to clean the car, hide the body in the trunk, dispose of their bloody clothes, and take the car to a [[Wrecking yard|junkyard]].\n\nAt a diner, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their \"miraculous\" survival at the apartment was a sign of [[miracle|divine intervention]]. While Vincent is in the bathroom, a couple, \"Pumpkin\" and \"Honey Bunny\", hold up the restaurant and demand Marsellus's briefcase. Jules distracts Pumpkin with its contents, and then overpowers him and holds him at gunpoint; Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun at Jules. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase in hand.\n\n== Cast ==<!-- Other articles link here -->\n<!-- Cast per opening credits order. -->\n* [[John Travolta]] as Vincent Vega:\n:Jules' partner-in-crime, working for Marsellus Wallace.

In 1995, in a special edition of ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert]]'' devoted to Tarantino, [[Gene Siskel]] argued that the work posed a major challenge to the \"ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas\". In Siskel's view,\n\n<blockquote>\nthe violent intensity of ''Pulp Fiction'' calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' [1960], [[Arthur Penn]]'s ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' [1967], and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' [1971]. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for ''Pulp Fiction''. Like all great films, it criticizes other movies.<ref name=\"SE\">\"Pulp Faction: The Tarantino Generation\", ''Siskel & Ebert'', ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nKen Dancyger writes that its \"imitative and innovative style\"&nbsp;\u2013 like that of its predecessor, ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''&nbsp;\u2013 represents\n\n<blockquote>\na new phenomenon, the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life. The consequence is twofold&nbsp;\u2013 the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as the [[gangster film]]s or Westerns, horror films or adventure films. And that the parody or alteration of that film creates a new form, a different experience for the audience.<ref>Dancyger (2002), p. 228.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Quentin Tarantino Uma Thurman John Travolta Cannes 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Travolta]], [[Uma Thurman]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]] at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]], for the film's 20th anniversary tribute.]]\nIn a widely covered speech on May 31, 1995, Republican presidential candidate [[Bob Dole]] attacked the American entertainment industry for peddling \"nightmares of depravity\".

Not because all audiences got all or any of its references to Scorsese and Kubrick, but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification. The film's cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world, but this nastiness keeps being laughed off&nbsp;\u2013 by the mock intensity of the action, the prowling, confronting, perverse, confined, and airless nastiness of the world Tarantino creates.<ref name=\"K250\">Kolker (2000), p. 250.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Henry Giroux|Henry A. Giroux]] argues that Tarantino \"empties violence of any critical social consequences, offering viewers only the immediacy of shock, humor, and irony-without-insight as elements of mediation. None of these elements gets beyond the seduction of voyeuristic gazing&nbsp;... [t]he facile consumption of shocking images and hallucinatory delight.\"<ref>Giroux (1996), p. 77.</ref>\n\nRegarding the violence and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that ''Pulp Fiction'' should be seen in light of the short stories of [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref>[Pamela H. Demory, \"Violence and Transcendence in ''Pulp Fiction'' and Flannery O'Connor\" in ''The Image of Violence in Literature, the Media, and Society: Selected Papers [from the] 1995 Conference [of the] Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Social Imagery'', ed. and intro., Will Wright and Steven Kaplan (Pueblo, Co.: Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Social Imagery, 1995): 187-194.]</ref> which likewise feature \"religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor.\" Discussing \"the connection between violence and redemption,\" Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers \"of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace,\" Tarantino \"seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything we have seen in the film&nbsp;\u2013 all the violence, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior&nbsp;\u2013 grace is still possible; there might still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits.\"<ref>[Quoted in ''Flannery O'Connor: An Annotated Reference Guide to Criticism'', ed. R. Neil Scott (Milledgeville, Georgia: Timberlane Books, 2002), p. 185]</ref>\n\n=== Homage as essence ===\n==== Cinema ====\n''Pulp Fiction'' is full of [[Homage (arts)|homages]] to other movies. \"Tarantino's characters\", writes [[Gary Groth]], \"inhabit a world where the entire landscape is composed of Hollywood product. Tarantino is a cinematic kleptomaniac&nbsp;\u2013 he literally can't help himself.\"<ref>Groth (1997), p. 189.</ref> Two scenes in particular have prompted discussion of the film's highly [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] style. Many have assumed that the dance sequence at Jack Rabbit Slim's was intended as a reference to Travolta's star-making performance as Tony Manero in the epochal ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977); Tarantino, however, credits a scene in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Bande \u00e0 part (film)|Bande \u00e0 part]]'' (1964) with the inspiration. According to the filmmaker;\n\n<blockquote>\nEverybody thinks that I wrote this scene just to have John Travolta dancing. But the scene existed before John Travolta was cast. But once he was cast, it was like, \"Great. We get to see John dance. All the better.\"...&nbsp;My favorite musical sequences have always been in Godard, because they just come out of nowhere. It's so infectious, so friendly.

'rustic sexual expression often takes the form of homosexual rape' in American movies.\"<ref>Bell (2000), p. 87.</ref> Stephen Paul Miller believes the ''Pulp Fiction'' scene goes down much easier than the one it echoes: \"The buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was in ''Deliverance''&nbsp;...

That's definitely the one to beat in that particular category!\"<ref>[[Rolling Stone]], November 3, 1994, p110</ref>)\n\nNeil Fulwood focuses on Butch's weapon selection, writing, \"Here, Tarantino's love of movies is at its most open and nonjudgemental, tipping a nod to the noble and the notorious, as well as sending up his own reputation as an [[enfant terrible]] of movie violence. Moreover, the scene makes a sly comment about the readiness of cinema to seize upon whatever is to hand for its moments of mayhem and murder.\"<ref name=\"F\" /> White asserts that \"the katana he finally, and significantly, selects identifies him with&nbsp;...

Our culture was television.\" A random list of the TV programs referenced in ''Pulp Fiction'' confirms his observation: ''[[Speed Racer]], [[Clutch Cargo]], [[The Brady Bunch]], [[The Partridge Family]], [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]], [[The Three Stooges]], [[The Flintstones]], [[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]], [[Green Acres]], [[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]], [[Happy Days]]'', and last but not least, Mia's fictional pilot, ''Fox Force Five''.<ref>Miklitsch, pp. 15, 16. Note that while the Three Stooges did have an original TV series that ran briefly in the mid-1960s, they were most familiar from their cinematic [[Short film|shorts]] that were [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to television.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n\"The above list, with the possible exception of ''The Avengers'',\" writes Miklitsch, \"suggests that ''Pulp Fiction'' has less of an elective affinity with the cinematic avant-gardism of Godard than with mainstream network programming.\"<ref name=\"M16\">Miklitsch, p. 16.</ref> Jonathan Rosenbaum had brought TV into his analysis of the Tarantino/Godard comparison, acknowledging that the directors were similar in wanting to cram everything they like onscreen: \"But the differences between what Godard likes and what Tarantino likes and why are astronomical; it's like comparing a combined museum, library, film archive, record shop, and department store with a jukebox, a video-rental outlet, and an issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''.\"<ref name=\"JR\" />\n\nSharon Willis focuses on the way a television show (''[[Clutch Cargo]]'') marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father's comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movie ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978). Willis writes that \"when Captain Koons enters the living room, we see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruined [[masculinity]] in search of rehabilitation&nbsp;... [T]he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze.\"<ref name=\"Willis\">Willis (1997), p. 195.</ref> Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a \"prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their b\u00eate noire: TV.\"<ref name=\"M16\" /> Kolker might not disagree, arguing that \"''Pulp Fiction'' is a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move through a series of long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend.\"<ref name=\"K250\" />\n\n=== Notable motifs ===\n\n==== The mysterious 666 briefcase ====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = PulpFictionCase.jpg\n| caption1  =Vincent \"stares&nbsp;... transfixed\" into the glowing case, as specified in Tarantino's screenplay.<ref>Tarantino (1994), p. 28.</ref>\n\n| image2    = KissMeDeadlyPandora.jpg\n| caption2  = Vincent's demeanor reinforces the allusion to the scene in ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955) in which Lily Carver, a.k.a.

Analyzing the notion, [[Roger Ebert]] dismissed it as \"nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the Net\".<ref>Ebert 1997, p. 188.</ref>\n\n==== Jules' Bible passage ====\nJules ritually recites what he describes as a biblical passage, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 25:17, before he executes someone. The passage is heard three times&nbsp;\u2013 in the introductory sequence in which Jules and Vincent reclaim Marsellus's briefcase from the doomed Brett; that same recitation a second time, at the beginning of \"The Bonnie Situation\", which overlaps the end of the earlier sequence; and in the epilogue at the diner. The first version of the passage is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</blockquote>\n\nThe second version, from the diner scene, is identical except for the final line: \"And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.\"\n\n{{listen|filename=End of Ezekiel.ogg|title=\"And I will strike down&nbsp;...\"| description= Conclusion of the \"Ezekiel 25:17\" monologue and Brett's murder}}\n\nWhile the final two sentences of Jules's speech are similar to the actual cited passage, the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases.<ref>Reinhartz (2003), p. 108.</ref> The text of Ezekiel 25 preceding verse 17 indicates that God's wrath is retribution for the hostility of the [[Philistines]]. In the [[King James Version]] from which Jules's speech is adapted, Ezekiel 25:17 reads in its entirety:\n\n<blockquote>And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I ''am'' the LORD, when I shall lay My vengeance upon them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/108/26/25.html|title=The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel, 25|work=The Holy Bible: King James Version|access-date=2007-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131052531/http://www.bartleby.com/108/26/25.html|archive-date=January 31, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTarantino's primary inspiration for the speech was the work of Japanese [[martial arts film|martial arts]] star [[Sonny Chiba]]. Its text and its identification as Ezekiel 25:17 derive from an almost identical creed that appears at the beginning of the Chiba movie ''[[Karate Kiba]]'' (''The Bodyguard''; 1976), where it is both shown as a scrolling text and read by an offscreen narrator.<ref>Thomas (2003) notes that instead of \"the Lord\", this version reads \"...&nbsp;and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard&nbsp;...\" (pp. 61\u201362). Conard (2006) claims that the text originates from the film ''Bodigaado Kiba'' (''Bodyguard Kiba'' or ''The Bodyguard''; 1973) and that the end phrase there is \"And you will know my name is Chiba the Bodyguard&nbsp;...\" (p. 135, n. 4).</ref>\n\nThe version seen at the beginning of ''The Bodyguard'' (1976) is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the inequity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the father of lost children. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger, who poison and destroy my brothers; and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard when I shall lay my vengeance upon them!</blockquote>\n\nIn the 1980s television series ''Kage no Gundan'' (''[[Shadow Warriors (TV series)|Shadow Warriors]]''), Chiba's character would lecture the villain-of-the-week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him.<ref>Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 4, ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref> A killer delivers a similar biblical rant in ''[[Modesty Blaise (novel)|Modesty Blaise]]'', the hardback but pulp-style novel Vincent is shown with in two scenes.<ref name=\"T25\">Enhanced Trivia Track, ch. 25, ''Pulp Fiction'' DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment).</ref>\n\nTwo critics who have analyzed the role of the speech find different ties between Jules's transformation and the issue of [[postmodernity]]. Gormley argues that unlike the film's other major characters&nbsp;\u2013 Marsellus aside&nbsp;\u2013 Jules is:\n\n<blockquote>\nlinked to a \"thing\" beyond postmodern simulation&nbsp;... [T]his is perhaps most marked when he moves on from being a simulation of a Baptist preacher, spouting Ezekiel because it was \"just a cool thing to say&nbsp;...\" In his conversion, Jules is shown to be cognizant of a place beyond this simulation, which, in this case, the film constructs as God.<ref>Gormley (2005), p. 167.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Adele Reinhartz]] writes that the \"depth of Jules's transformation\" is indicated by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: \"In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness&nbsp;... In the second&nbsp;... he appears to be a different sort of man altogether&nbsp;... [I]n true postmodern fashion, [he] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation.\"<ref>Reinhartz (2003), pp. 106, 107.</ref> Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him \"that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life\"; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture.<ref>Conard (2006), p. 130.</ref> Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: \"[T]he [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual awakening]] at the end of ''Pulp Fiction'', which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It may make you feel good, but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser.\"<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan. \"Allusion Profusion (''Ed Wood, Pulp Fiction'')\", ''Chicago Reader'', October 21, 1994. Note that the avowed inspiration is actually a TV show, ''Kung Fu''.</ref>\n\n==== The bathroom ====\nMuch of ''Pulp Fiction''{{'}}s action revolves around characters who are either in the bathroom or need to use the toilet. To a lesser extent, Tarantino's other films also feature this narrative element.<ref>{{cite web |author1=White, Mike |author2=Mike Thompson |name-list-style=amp |work=Cashiers du Cinemart |title=Tarantino in a Can? |url=http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_2/2_toilet.asp?IshNum=2&Headline=Tarantino%20In%20The%20Can |date=Spring 1995 |access-date=2006-12-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211214336/http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_2/2_toilet.asp?IshNum=2&Headline=Tarantino%20In%20The%20Can |archive-date=2012-02-11}}</ref> At Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia goes to \"powder her nose\"&nbsp;\u2013 literally; she [[Cocaine#Insufflation|snorts coke]] in the restroom, surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping. Butch and Fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom, he in the shower, she brushing her teeth; the next morning, but just a few seconds later in screen time, she is again brushing her teeth. As Jules and Vincent confront Brett and two of his pals, a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom&nbsp;\u2013 his actions will lead to Jules' transformative \"moment of clarity\". After Marvin's absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie's bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel.<ref name=\"Den\" /> When the diner hold-up turns into a [[Mexican standoff]], \"Honey Bunny\" whines, \"I gotta go pee!\"<ref name=\"F15\">Fraiman (2003), p. 15.</ref>\n\nAs described by Peter and Will Brooker, \"In three significant moments Vincent retires to the bathroom [and] returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened.\"<ref name=\"B&B\">Brooker and Brooker (1996), p. 239.</ref> The threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically, and is realized in the third instance:\n\n# Vincent and Jules's diner breakfast and philosophical conversation is aborted by Vincent's bathroom break; an armed robbery ensues while Vincent is reading on the toilet.\n# While Vincent is in the bathroom worrying about the possibility of going too far with Marsellus's wife, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses.\n# During a stakeout at Butch's apartment, Vincent emerges from the toilet with his book and is killed by Butch.\n\nIn the Brookers' analysis, \"Through Vince&nbsp;... we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent, transformed, disastrously, in the instant you are not looking.\"<ref name=\"B&B\" /> Fraiman finds it particularly significant that Vincent is reading ''Modesty Blaise'' in two of these instances. She links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as \"the archetypal consumers of pulp\":\n\n<blockquote>\nLocating popular fiction in the bathroom, Tarantino reinforces its association with shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of \"pulp\" that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then is a series of damaging associations&nbsp;\u2013 pulp, women, shit&nbsp;\u2013 that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent's reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub.<ref>Fraiman (2003), p. 14. Fraiman's identification of the submachine gun as a [[\u0160korpion|Czech M61]] matches the description in the screenplay: Tarantino (1994), p. 96.
