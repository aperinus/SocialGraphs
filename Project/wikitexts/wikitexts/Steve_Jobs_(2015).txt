A British-American co-production, it was adapted from the [[Steve Jobs (book)|2011 biography]] by [[Walter Isaacson]] and interviews conducted by Sorkin, and covers 14 years (1984\u20131998) in the life of [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Jobs is portrayed by [[Michael Fassbender]], with [[Kate Winslet]] as [[Joanna Hoffman]] and [[Seth Rogen]], [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], and [[Jeff Daniels]] in supporting roles.\n\nDevelopment began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Filming began in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive on the project, with editor [[Elliot Graham]] starting while the film was still shooting. [[Daniel Pemberton]] served as composer, with a focus on dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.\n\n''Steve Jobs'' premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival|2015 Telluride Film Festival]] on September 5, 2015, and began a [[limited release]] in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the U.S. on October 23, 2015 to critical acclaim, with Boyle's direction, visual style, Sorkin's screenplay and the acting of Fassbender and Winslet garnering praise. However, it was a financial disappointment, grossing $34 million worldwide against a budget of $30 million. People close to Jobs such as [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[John Sculley]] praised the performances, but the film also received criticism for historical inaccuracy. Winslet won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] for Best Supporting Actress and Sorkin won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay]] at the [[73rd Golden Globes]], while Fassbender and Winslet received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively, at the [[88th Academy Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->In 1984, the [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh 128K]]'s voice demo fails less than an hour before its unveiling at [[De Anza College|Flint Center]]. [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] demands engineer [[Andy Hertzfeld]] fix it, threatening to publicly implicate him in the presentation's credits if he does not. Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo using the prototype [[Macintosh 512K]] computer.\n\nJobs rants to marketing executive [[Joanna Hoffman]] about a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] \u2013 he denies he is the father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa]]. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him \u2013 she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her [[MacPaint]] art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] asks Jobs to acknowledge the [[Apple II]] team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.\n\nBy 1986, following the apparent failure of the Macintosh, Jobs has founded a new company, [[NeXT]]. Before the [[NeXT Computer]] launch at the [[War Memorial Opera House]] in 1988, he spends time with 9-year-old Lisa. However, his relationship with Brennan is still strained \u2013 he accuses her of irresponsible behavior and of using Lisa to get money from him. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure. Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions Jobs' contributions to computing history. Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor who directs \"musicians\" like Wozniak.\n\nApple CEO [[John Sculley]] demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs \u2013 Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Despite Sculley's warnings, Jobs criticized the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes Jobs designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.\n\nBy 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, purchased NeXT, and named Jobs CEO, and Jobs is about to unveil the [[iMac G3|iMac]] at [[Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall|Davies Symphony Hall]]. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother to sell the house Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition, and Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, and again he refuses.\n\nSculley arrives in secret, and the two make amends. Jobs and Sculley discuss Jobs' life as an adopted child, and Jobs admits that his need for control stems from his feelings of powerlessness in being given up. At the behest of Hoffman, Jobs apologizes to Lisa for his mistakes and accepts that he is her father, admitting that he is \"poorly made.\" He confesses to Lisa that \"[[Apple Lisa|the Lisa]]\" was actually named after her. He also promises Lisa on seeing her Walkman that he's going to put more [[iPod|music in her pocket]]. Lisa watches her father take the stage to introduce the iMac.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Steve Jobs]]:\n:Co-founder of [[Apple Inc.]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cultofmac.com/310397/meet-official-cast-steve-jobs-movie/ |title=Meet the official cast of the Steve Jobs movie |access-date=July 12, 2015 |last=Hein |first=Buster |date=January 28, 2015 |work=Cultofmac |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317052105/http://www.cultofmac.com/310397/meet-official-cast-steve-jobs-movie/ |archive-date=March 17, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Fassbender acknowledged his lack of physical resemblance to Jobs, but stated that he was more interested in capturing Jobs' essence than his appearance.

Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part.\"<ref name=\"Labrecque\" /> Winslet spent considerable time with [[Joanna Hoffman]] to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman \"has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself.

I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty [[Eastern Europe]]an person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass.\" In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she \"just wanted to please [Hoffman] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake.\"<ref name=hoffman/> Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman \"did genuinely love [Jobs]. And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly.\"<ref name=\"dbprem\"/>\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as [[Steve Wozniak]]:\n:Co-founder of Apple and creator of the [[Apple II]].<ref name=\"cast\"/> Rogen admitted to not being familiar with Wozniak or his founding work with Apple.

K\u00fcchler|Alwin K\u00fcchler]] implemented three different film formats: [[16mm film|16mm]] for 1984, [[35mm movie film|35mm]] for 1988, and [[Digital cinematography|digital]] for 1998. They also wanted each of the film's three time periods to visually reflect Jobs' own development at the time. For instance, K\u00fcchler explains that the filming at [[De Anza College|Flint Center, De Anza college]] for the first act combined the graininess of 16&nbsp;mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional, spontaneous look \u2013 much in the vein of how Jobs is portrayed at that time. The third act, shot with an [[Arri Alexa]] at the [[Davies Symphony Hall]], incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of Jobs' own design philosophies of the [[iMac]] and subsequent [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] hardware. K\u00fcchler describes his experience filming ''Steve Jobs'' as \"brilliant and challenging at the same time\", and that the goal was to \"make sure that the visuals kept up with the words\", in reference to the production's collaboration between Boyle and Sorkin.<ref name=\"boylewired\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/steve-jobs-danny-boyle-interview/ |title=Why Danny Boyle Filmed Steve Jobs in Three Different Formats |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 16, 2015 |access-date=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818112833/http://www.wired.com/2015/10/steve-jobs-danny-boyle-interview |archive-date=August 18, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"kuchlerthalo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thalo.com/articles/view/1143/steve_jobs_dp_alwin_h_kchler_shoots_in_three_acts |title=Steve Jobs DP Alwin H.

During the one-week rehearsal that took place in between production for each of the three acts (shot in chronological order), Graham worked on the existing footage and received ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room. In an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the [[Shot (filmmaking)#Film editing|shot frequency]] and providing enough \"visual interventions\" to control for Sorkin's dialogue-heavy screenplay. He described approaching each scene as \"a series of fight sequences\". Michael Fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as Jobs, which Graham and Boyle then chose from during [[post-production]].<ref name=\"boylecrave\">{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/912765-interview-danny-boyle-politics-steve-jobs |title=Interview Danny Boyle on the Politics of ''Steve Jobs''|last=Bibbiani |first=William |work=[[CraveOnline]] |date=October 16, 2015 |access-date=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223082859/http://www.craveonline.com/culture/912765-interview-danny-boyle-politics-steve-jobs |archive-date=December 23, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"grahamguild\">{{cite web |url=https://www.editorsguild.com/FromTheGuild.cfm?FromTheGuildid=535 |title=From the Guild: Getting to the Core of Apple |last=Feld |first=Rob |publisher=[[Motion Picture Editors Guild]] |date=November 4, 2015 |access-date=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921115915/http://editorsguild.com/FromTheGuild.cfm?FromTheGuildid=535 |archive-date=September 21, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/video/steve-jobs-editing-aaron-sorkin/ |title=Steve Jobs Editor on the Rush of Working With Aaron Sorkin Dialogue |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815225947/http://variety.com/video/steve-jobs-editing-aaron-sorkin/ |archive-date=August 15, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Graham also said: \"Danny would be involved a lot but also take time away.

Much like the film's visual approach, the score is divided into three distinguishable sections, each corresponding to the intended feel of the act in which the section is heard. \"You have the first act which is analog,\" Pemberton explains, \"you have the second act which is orchestral, and you have the third act which is digital.\" For the first act's composition, Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers, in particular ones released no later than 1984 \u2013 the time the first act takes place \u2013 such as the [[Roland SH-1000]] and [[Yamaha CS-80]]. The second act's score is more operatic in nature, matching the setting of the [[War Memorial Opera House|San Francisco Opera House]]. Finally, the third act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of the 1998 iMac product launch, and Pemberton correspondingly used his own iMac to compose this section.<ref name=\"pembertonpop\">{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/a-symphony-in-three-parts-breaking-down-the-steve-jobs-score-with-composer-/ |title=Breaking Down the 'Steve Jobs' Score with Composer Daniel Pemberton |first=Cory |last=Woodroof |work=[[PopMatters]] |date=November 13, 2015 |access-date=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popmatters.com%2Ffeature%2Fa-symphony-in-three-parts-breaking-down-the-steve-jobs-score-with-composer-%2F+&date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"pembertonvariety\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/movie-maestros-mix-organic-and-synthetic-sounds-1201632653/ |title=Movie Maestros Mix Organic and Synthetic Sounds |first=Joe |last=Burlingame |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 3, 2015 |access-date=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418100733/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/movie-maestros-mix-organic-and-synthetic-sounds-1201632653/ |archive-date=April 18, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"pembertonclash\">{{cite web |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/daniel-pemberton-scoring-steve-jobs |title=Daniel Pemberton: Scoring Steve Jobs |first=Paul |last=Weedon |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=November 18, 2015 |access-date=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320002324/http://www.clashmusic.com/features/daniel-pemberton-scoring-steve-jobs |archive-date=March 20, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"deadlinepemberton\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2015/12/steve-jobs-composer-daniel-pemberton-oscars-2015-best-score-1201617583/ |title='Steve Jobs' Composer Daniel Pemberton Blended Nostalgia And Futurism |first=Anthony |last=D'Alessandro |work=[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]] |date=December 5, 2015 |access-date=December 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217041418/http://deadline.com/2015/12/steve-jobs-composer-daniel-pemberton-oscars-2015-best-score-1201617583/ |archive-date=February 17, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack also features songs by [[The Libertines]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Maccabees (band)|The Maccabees]].

Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that \"the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you made a movie called ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person.\"<ref name=mossberg>{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/21/9578921/steve-jobs-movie-review-walt-mossberg |title=Mossberg: The Steve Jobs I knew isn't in this movie |access-date=October 22, 2015 |last=Mossberg |first=Walt |date=October 21, 2015 |work=[[The Verge]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909001619/http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/21/9578921/steve-jobs-movie-review-walt-mossberg |archive-date=September 9, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Steve Jobs (film)}}\n''Steve Jobs'' has received over 4 dozen industry and critic award nominations.
