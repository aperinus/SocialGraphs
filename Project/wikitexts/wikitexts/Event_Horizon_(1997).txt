S. Anderson]] and written by [[Philip Eisner]]. It stars [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Sam Neill]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]] and [[Joely Richardson]]. Set in 2047, it follows a crew of astronauts sent on a rescue mission after a missing spaceship, the ''Event Horizon'', spontaneously appears in orbit around [[Neptune]], only to discover that a sinister force has come back with it.\n\nThe film had a troubled production, with filming and editing rushed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] when it became clear that ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' would not meet its projected release. The original 130-minute cut of the film was heavily edited by the studio's demand, to Anderson's consternation.\n\nOn release, the film was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $42 million on a $60 million production budget. However, it began to sell well on [[home video]]; its initial DVD release sold so well that Paramount contacted Anderson to begin working on a restoration of the deleted footage, but it had been either lost or destroyed. In the years since, the film has slowly built a [[cult film|cult following]] and is referenced in other works of popular culture.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2047, a distress signal is received from the ''Event Horizon'', a [[starship]] that disappeared during its maiden voyage to [[Proxima Centauri]] seven years earlier, and has mysteriously reappeared in a [[orbital decay|decaying orbit]] around [[Neptune]]. The rescue vessel ''Lewis and Clark'' is dispatched. Its crew\u2014Capt. Miller, second-in-command Lt. Starck, pilot Smith, medical technician Peters, engineer Ensign Justin, doctor D.J., and rescue technician Cooper\u2014is joined by Dr. William Weir, the ''Event Horizon''{{'}}s designer. He briefs them on the ship's experimental gravity drive with a simple visualization of how it [[Wormhole|folds space-time]]. The distress signal seems to consist of a series of screams and howls but D.J. believes he can discern the [[Latin]] phrase {{lang|la|\"Liberate me\"}} (\"Save me\").\n\nUpon boarding the ''Event Horizon'', the crew finds evidence of a massacre. As they search for survivors, the ship's gravity drive activates, briefly pulling Justin into the resulting portal and causing a shock wave that damages the ''Lewis and Clark'', forcing the entire crew to board the ''Event Horizon''. Justin emerges in a [[catatonia|catatonic state]], as a result of what he has seen on the other side. He attempts [[suicide]] by decompression, but is saved by Miller, forcing the crew to place him in [[suspended animation|stasis]].\n\nThe crew begins seeing people from their pasts that only they can see,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Horror in Space: Critical Essays on a Film Subgenre|last=Brittany|first=Michele|publisher=McFarland|year=2017|isbn=978-14766-6405-7|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=3}}</ref> hallucinations corresponding to their fears and regrets. Miller sees Corrick, a subordinate he was forced to abandon to his death; Peters sees her son, who she left with her ex-husband, with his legs covered in bloody lesions and Weir sees an eyeless vision of his late wife who killed herself, urging him to join her. They discover a video log of the ''Event Horizon''{{'}}s crew fornicating and mutilating each other shortly after first engaging the gravity drive. The log ends with a shot of the ''Event Horizon''{{'}}s captain, holding out his own eyes gouged from their sockets, speaking the complete Latin phrase from the earlier distress call, which D.J. translates as {{lang|la|\"Liberate tutemet ex inferis<!-- per transcript - see discussion at Talk -->\"}} (\"Save {{em|yourself}} from [[hell]]\").\n\nDeducing that the ship's drive opened a gateway to a hellish dimension outside the [[universe|known universe]], and that the ''Event Horizon'' has somehow attained [[sentience]], Miller decides to destroy it and orders an evacuation. Peters is lured to her death by a hallucination of her son. Weir, who has gouged out his own eyes and is possessed by the evil presence, uses an explosive device to destroy the ''Lewis and Clark'', killing Smith and blasting Cooper off into space. Weir kills D.J. by [[Vivisection|vivisecting]] him and corners Starck on the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. Miller confronts Weir, who overpowers him and initiates a 10-minute countdown, at the end of which the ''Event Horizon'' will return to the other dimension by activating the gravity drive.\n\nCooper, having used his space suit's oxygen supply to propel himself back to the ship, appears at the bridge window. Weir shoots at him, shattering the window, and is blown into space by the ensuing decompression. Miller, Starck and Cooper survive and manage to seal off the ship's bridge. With their own ship destroyed, Miller plans to split the ''Event Horizon'' in two and use its forward section as a lifeboat. He is attacked by manifestations of Corrick which turn out to be the resurrected Dr. Weir. Miller fights him off and detonates the explosives, sacrificing himself.\n\nThe gravity drive activates, pulling the ship's stern section into a black hole. Starck and Cooper enter stasis beside a comatose Justin and wait to be rescued. 72 days later, the wreckage of the ''Event Horizon'' is boarded by a rescue party, who discover the remaining crew in stasis. Starck sees Weir posing as one of the rescuers and screams in terror, but she wakes up and realizes that it was a nightmare. Cooper and the rescue team comfort the newly awakened and terrified Starck as the bulkheads unexpectedly close.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Captain S.J.

Producer and longtime collaborator [[Jeremy Bolt]] felt it was a \"terrific concept\" but was \"very dense\" in terms of length and the storyline was \"a bit lost.\"<ref name=\"makingof\"/> Anderson didn't want to direct a mimicry of ''Alien'', so he gave the script a major rewrite, picturing a \"classic haunted house movie.\" He incorporated significant influences of moderately successful horror films such as [[Robert Wise]]'s ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' (1963) and [[Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980), because they created suspense from the unknown\u2014the evil presence was hidden from the viewer\u2014and their endings induced ambiguities of perception in the audience.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> He said he was also interested in the concept of [[Hell]], and of \"the ship itself being possessed rather than going 'Oh, it's an alien consciousness that is doing this,'\" and added these to the script.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nScreenwriter [[Philip Eisner]] acknowledged that ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' influenced the story.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=phubar |author-link=Philip Eisner |number=860129292151214082 |date=May 4, 2017 |title=I played the shit out of 40K, so it was definitely an influence, conscious or otherwise.}}</ref> In the setting of ''Warhammer 40,000'', spaceships travel the galaxy by passing through \"the Warp\"&mdash;a parallel dimension where faster-than-light travel is possible, conceptually similar to \"[[hyperspace]]\" in ''[[Star Wars]]''&mdash;but which is also inhabited by evil spirits that can infiltrate the ship and possess the crew if said ship isn't properly shielded.

However, due to the short production schedule, the rapidly approaching release date, and the fact that principal photography had not finished, Anderson agreed to a six-week editing period, and promised to deliver the film by August 1997, as Paramount wanted a hit film before ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic's]]'' planned September release date. When the main unit wrapped, Anderson was supposed to start editing the film, but he had two weeks of shooting left with the [[second unit]], shortening post-production to just four weeks, during which only a rough cut could be assembled. He noted that at two hours and 10 minutes, it was overly long, with weak direction and acting that could have used another editing pass; unfinished special effects; and a poor sound mix.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXL_CM4DXZ8  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/TXL_CM4DXZ8 |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Paul W.S.

There were complaints about the extreme gore,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and Anderson and producer [[Jeremy Bolt]] claim that some members of the test audience fainted.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> Paramount executives, who had stopped watching the [[dailies]] before any of the gore was shot, and were seeing the complete film for the first time along with the audience, were similarly shocked by how gruesome it was, and demanded a shorter runtime with less gore. Anderson agreed that while his first cut was too long, Paramount forced him to make one that was instead too short, and that the film would benefit by the restoration of around 10 minutes of footage, including some of the deleted gore.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\n===Lost footage===\n{{quote box |width=30% |quote=It was 'reduced unit' footage, I think the studio never bothered watching it because they thought it was [[Insert (filmmaking)|inserts]] and buttons being pressed or something. But what it all was, was actually all of the hell footage{{nbsp}}... influenced by [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]{{nbsp}}... so there was a beauty to it, even though it was very disturbing. |source=\u2014Paul W.

The director's cut was abandoned and instead a special-edition two-DVD set was released, featuring one deleted scene, two extended scenes, and a few shots of deleted material in the included [[making-of]] featurette. The footage is of \"[[Videotape|video]]\" quality.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nKnown deleted scenes include a meeting scene between Weir and people in charge of the mission in which they discuss ''Event Horizon'', some dialogue of which remained present in the theatrical trailer;<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocQvTGLuBY8 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/ocQvTGLuBY8 |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Event Horizon deleted scene |date=8 October 2010|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=16 July 2018|author=TheDronemaster}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pugTKXUUlGk |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/pugTKXUUlGk |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Event Horizon (1997) Trailer|date=13 February 2009|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=16 July 2018|author=HorrorMoviesBlog}}{{cbignore}}</ref> more backstory for Cooper and Justin, including a stronger explanation for Justin entering the black hole; a deleted backstory of the relationship between Starck and Miller; additional scenes explaining what the gateway to hell/black hole is;<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Anthony C.|last=Ferrante|title=The Cutting Room: Event Horizon|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|issue=170|page=12|access-date=16 July 2018|url=http://www.oocities.org/hollywood/Cinema/3615/mag/mag3.html |issn=0164-2111}}</ref> Miller finding a tooth floating in ''Event Horizon'';<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> a longer version of the scene where Peters hallucinates that her son's mangled legs are covered in maggots;<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> a scene where Weir hallucinates that Justin turns into his wife Claire;<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Z6ln27_cE |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/n4Z6ln27_cE |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Behind The Scenes \"Event Horizon\" part 4\\9. \u0417\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e \"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439\" \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c 4\\9 |date=13 May 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=16 July 2018 |author=Simbacool69}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=\"BehindTheScenes\">{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RzccmgGMcs  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/5RzccmgGMcs |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Behind The Scenes \"Event Horizon\" part 7\\9. \u0417\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e \"\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043e\u043d\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439\" \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c 7\\9|date=13 May 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=16 July 2018|author=Simbacool69}}{{cbignore}}</ref> a bloodier version of Weir's wife Claire's suicide; a longer version of the scene where Miller finds D.J.'s vivisected body with his guts on the table; and a longer version of the \"Visions From Hell\" scene during Miller's final fight with Weir, with more shots of ''Event Horizon''<nowiki/>'s crew being tortured.{{better source needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe \"bloody orgy\" video was also longer.

One did not have a jump scare at the end when the last two survivors are found by another rescue crew and Starck hallucinates that she sees Weir, although there was a similar version of the scene included in this ending where she hears screams of the ''Event Horizon'' crew and screams before Cooper wakes her.
