During its four years of development, the producers had difficulties securing financial support. It was eventually produced with a budget between US$100 million and US$146.7 million provided by independent sources, making it one of the most expensive [[independent film]]s ever produced. Filming for ''Cloud Atlas'' began in September 2011 at [[Babelsberg Studio]] in [[Babelsberg|Potsdam-Babelsberg, Germany]].\n\nIt premiered on 8 September 2012 at the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival|37th Toronto International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"LAtimes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-wachowskis-cloud-atlas-toronto-20120909,0,3034761.story|title=Wachowskis open up their 'Cloud Atlas' at last|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=11 September 2012|date=9 September 2012|first=Mark|last=Olsen}}</ref> and was publicly released on 26 October 2012 in conventional and [[IMAX]] cinemas.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sandy Schaefer|url=https://screenrant.com/cloud-atlas-imax-tv-spots/?_r=true|title='Cloud Atlas' Arriving in IMAX Theaters; First TV Spot Released|website=Screen Rant|date=24 September 2012}}</ref> Critics were polarized, causing it to be included on various \"[[Best Film]]\" and \"[[Worst film|Worst Film]]\" lists.<ref name=\"Austin Film Critics Association Awards\"/><ref name=\"Boston Online Film Critics Association Awards\"/><ref name=\"Indiwire\"/> It was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]] for Tykwer (who co-scored the film), [[Johnny Klimek]], and [[Reinhold Heil]].<ref name=\"goldenglobes.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/2012/12/nominations-2013/|title=Nominations 2013 \u2014 Golden Globe Awards|date=13 December 2012|work=Golden Globes|access-date=13 December 2012|archive-date=14 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214105703/http://www.goldenglobes.org/2012/12/nominations-2013/|url-status=dead}}</ref> It received several nominations at the [[Saturn Awards]], including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]], and won for [[Saturn Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Make-up|Best Make-up]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story jumps between eras until each storyline eventually resolves, spanning hundreds of years. Writings from characters in prior storylines are found in future storylines. Characters appear to recur in each era, but change relationships to each other. Slaves or abusers often change roles, suggesting [[reincarnation]] or other connection between souls through the ages.\n\nIn the [[Chatham Islands]], 1849, American lawyer Adam Ewing witnesses the whipping of Autua, an [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[Moriori people|Moriori]] man. Autua [[stowaway|stows away]] on Ewing's ship and persuades him to advocate for Autua to join the crew as a free man. Autua saves Ewing's life before his doctor, Henry Goose, can poison him and steal his gold under the guise of treating him for a parasitic worm. In San Francisco, Ewing and his wife denounce her father's complicity in slavery and leave to join the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition movement]].\n\nIn 1936, English composer Robert Frobisher finds work as an [[amanuensis]] to aging composer Vyvyan Ayrs, allowing Frobisher to compose his own masterpiece, \"The Cloud Atlas Sextet\". Frobisher reads from Ewing's journal among the books at Ayrs's mansion. Ayrs demands credit for the sextet and threatens to expose Frobisher's bisexuality if he refuses. Frobisher shoots and wounds Ayrs and goes into hiding. He finishes the sextet and shoots himself before his lover Rufus Sixsmith arrives.\n\nIn San Francisco, 1973, journalist Luisa Rey meets Sixsmith, now a nuclear physicist. Sixsmith tips off Rey to a conspiracy to create a catastrophe at a [[nuclear reactor]] run by Lloyd Hooks, who secretly promotes oil-energy interests. He is killed by Hooks's hitman, Bill Smoke, before he can give her a report as proof. Rey finds Frobisher's letters to Sixsmith, just as Frobisher had found Ewing's journal earlier.  She tracks down Frobisher's obscure sextet in a record store.  Scientist Isaac Sachs passes her a copy of Sixsmith's report. Smoke kills Sachs by blowing up his plane and then runs Rey's car off a bridge, destroying the report.  With help from the plant's head of security, Joe Napier, Rey evades another assassination attempt, and Smoke is killed. With a copy of the report from Sixsmith's niece, she exposes the plot and has Hooks indicted.\n\nIn London, 2012, [[gangster]] Dermot Hoggins murders a critic after a harsh review of his memoir, generating huge sales.  Hoggins's brothers threaten the publisher, the aging Timothy Cavendish, for Hoggins's profits.  Timothy's brother, Denholme, tells him to hide at Aurora House.  On the way, Timothy reads a manuscript based on Rey's story. Believing Aurora House is a hotel, Timothy signs in, only to discover he has unwittingly committed himself to a [[nursing home]] where all outside contact is prohibited; Denholme reveals that he sent Timothy there as revenge for an affair with his wife. Timothy escapes with three other residents, resumes his relationship with an old flame, and writes a screenplay about his experience.\n\nIn 2144, Sonmi-451 is a \"fabricant\", a humanoid clone indentured as a fast food server and implied sex worker in a dystopian Neo [[Seoul]]. She is exposed to ideas of rebellion by another fabricant, Yoona-939, who has obtained a clip of the movie about Cavendish's involuntary institutionalization. After Yoona is killed, Sonmi is rescued by rebel Commander Hae-Joo Chang, who exposes Sonmi to the banned writings of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the full film version of Cavendish's experience.  Hae-Joo eventually introduces her to the leader of the rebel movement, and shows her that clones when 'freed' are actually recycled into \"soap\", food for fabricants. Sonmi makes a public broadcast of her revelations before the authorities attack, killing Hae-Joo and recapturing Sonmi. After recounting her story to an archivist, she is executed.\n\nIn 2321, the tribespeople of the post-apocalyptic [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] worship Sonmi; their sacred text is taken from her recorded testimony. Zachry Bailey's village is visited by Meronym, a member of an advanced society called the Prescients.  Prescients use nuclear powered ships and remnants of high technology, but are dying from a plague.  Meronym is searching for a forgotten communication station on Mauna Sol to send an SOS to off-world humans. In exchange for healing Zachry's niece, Catkin, Meronym is guided by Zachry to the station where Sonmi made her recording. Returning home, Zachry finds his tribe slaughtered by the cannibalistic Kona tribe. He kills the sleeping Kona chief and rescues Catkin before he and Meronym fight off the other tribesmen. Zachry and Catkin join Meronym and the Prescients as their ship leaves Big Island. On a distant planet, Zachry is married to Meronym and recounts the story to his grandchildren.\n\n==Main cast==\nThe main character in each story is indicated in '''bold'''.\n\n<!--READ ME - Do not make changes to this cast table.
