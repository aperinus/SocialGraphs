She also acts in the starring role, opposite [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]. The film was the first major studio production for July, who had been known previously for her self-produced [[short film]]s and [[performance art]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe structure of the film consists of several subplots which all revolve around an intertwined cast of characters.\n\nThe film begins by introducing Richard ([[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]), a shoe salesman and recently separated father of two. After being thrown out by his wife Pam ([[JoNell Kennedy]]), he gets an apartment of his own to share with his children, Peter (Miles Thompson) and Robby (Brandon Ratcliff). He meets Christine ([[Miranda July]]), a senior-cab driver and amateur video artist, while she takes her client to shop for shoes, and the two develop a fledgling romantic relationship.\n\nRobby, six years old, and his 14-year-old brother, Peter, have a joint online chat, which he later depicts in another chat session as \"))<>((\", an emoticon that means \"pooping back and forth, forever.\" This piques the interest of the woman at the other end and she suggests a face-to-face meeting. When Robby and the woman meet at a park, she realizes he's a child and kisses him and walks away.\n\nTwo of Richard's teenaged neighbors, Heather (Natasha Slayton) and Rebecca (Najarra Townsend), develop a playful relationship with a much older neighbor Andrew ([[Brad William Henke]]) who works in the shoe store with Richard. He does not say much, but he keeps leaving signs on his window about what he would do to each of them. As a result of this relationship, Heather and Rebecca ask Peter if they can practice oral sex on him, so that he can tell them which of the two does it better; so they do. He says both were exactly the same. The daughter of a neighbor peeks in the window, sees what is happening, and quickly leaves. Heather and Rebecca later come to the neighbor's house intending to have sex with him as practice, but he appears afraid when he sees them through his window and he pretends not to be home.\n\nMeanwhile, Christine's work is rejected by a contemporary art museum, but then later accepted by the curator, who turns out to be the woman who was instant messaging with the brothers.\n\nThe plots come together in the end, with Peter developing a friendship with the daughter of a neighbor, having been introduced to the hope chest that she has, Christine and Richard displaying a show of mutual acceptance of their attraction to each other, and, as a final plot device, Robby finding that the noise he had awoken to early every morning was that of an early-rising businessman tapping a quarter on a street sign pole. When asked why he is doing it, he stops and turns around, saying \"just passing the time\", and gives Robby the quarter. When his bus drives away and Robby tries it out himself, the sun heightens with each tap, time literally passing as he does it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Miranda July]] as Christine Jesperson\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Richard Swersey\n* Miles Thompson as Peter Swersey\n* Brandon Ratcliff as Robby Swersey\n* Natasha Slayton as Heather\n* Najarra Townsend as Rebecca\n* Carlie Westerman as Sylvie\n* JoNell Kennedy as Pam\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as Andrew\n* [[Tracy Wright]] as Nancy Herrington\n* Hector Elias as Michael\n* [[Ellen Geer]] as Ellen\n* Jordan Potter as Shamus\n* Colette Kilroy and James Kayten as Sylvie's mom and dad\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot using a [[CineAlta|Sony HDW-F900 CineAlta]] high definition digital video camera.<ref>[https://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news-features/chuy-ch-vez-me-and-you-and-everyone-we-know-415183 Chuy Ch\u00e1vez on \u2018Me and You and Everyone We Know\u2019-Creative Planet Network]</ref>\n\nThe score, composed by [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]], was performed largely on a [[Circuit bending|modified]] [[Casio SK-1]] sampling keyboard.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Me-You-Everyone-Know-Score/dp/B0009R0WBG Michael Andrews-Me And You And Everyone We Know (Score)-Amazon.com Music]</ref>\n\nOn-line chat scenes were filmed with open-source [[Pidgin (software)|Gaim]] software, now known as Pidgin.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received largely positive reviews;
