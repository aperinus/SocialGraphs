The story revolves around a [[romantic love|romance]] between two [[teenager]]s, and it stars [[Noah Taylor]], who appears again as Danny Embling, the protagonist of Duigan's 1987 film ''[[The Year My Voice Broke]]''. It also stars [[Thandiwe Newton]] and [[Nicole Kidman]].\n\n''Flirting'' is the second in an incomplete potential [[trilogy]] of autobiographical films by Duigan. It was produced by [[Terry Hayes]], [[Doug Mitchell (film producer)|Doug Mitchell]], Barbara Gibbs and [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]], and made by [[Kennedy Miller Mitchell|Kennedy Miller Studios]], who also made the ''[[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max Trilogy]]''. The film won the 1990 [[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film]], as ''The Year My Voice Broke'' had in 1987.\n\n== Plot ==\nDanny, now an awkward, underdeveloped 17-year-old, has been sent away by his parents to the all-male St. Albans [[boarding school]] in rural [[New South Wales]], Australia, in the hopes he won\u2019t become a delinquent. The year is 1965 and it has been some time since Danny has had any romantic relationship with a girl (his former love, Freya, from ''The Year My Voice Broke'', left him at the end of the first film). Danny is the butt of jokes because of his stutter and long nose (for which he is nicknamed \"Bird\"). His only friend is Gilbert.\n\nAt a school rugby game, he meets and slowly becomes interested in Thandiwe, a Ugandan-Kenyan-British girl (Ugandan father and Kenyan-British mother) attending the all-girls Cirencester Ladies\u2019 College across the lake, while her father, a political activist, is lecturing at university in Canberra. They later meet at a debate between the two schools, and covertly during a school dance. She is punished for leaving the dance without permission and is given chores by the prefect, Nicola. Thandiwe is later befriended by Melissa and Janet.\n\nThroughout the course of the school year, they foster a budding romance, despite the overbearing regulations inflicted upon them \u2014 specifically [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial politics]] and [[social conventions]] (Thandiwe is often regarded by the school authorities as rebellious and overtly sexual). After the performance of the musical, Danny introduces his parents to Thandiwe and her parents. They later decide to return to Uganda in response to the political turmoil there. Soon Thandiwe decides to return too, and lies about her true departure date, in order to spend the night in a motel with Danny. They are discovered, leading to his expulsion. Thandiwe writes to him regularly from Uganda, but then the letters stop coming. One day a letter arrives from Nairobi saying she is finally safe there.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Danny Embling\n* [[Thandiwe Newton]] as Thandiwe Adjewa<ref name=\"vogue\">{{cite magazine |last=Evans |first=Diana |date=4 April 2021 |title=\"I'm Taking Back What's Mine\": The Many Lives of Thandiwe Newton |url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/thandiwe-newton-interview |magazine=Vogue |access-date=5 April 2021}}</ref>\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Nicola Radcliffe \n* [[Kym Wilson]] as Melissa \n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Janet\n* [[Les Hill]] as Greg Gilmore\n\n== Production ==\nThe script was written before ''The Year My Voice Broke''.<ref name=\"stratton2\">David Stratton, ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Pan MacMillan, 1990 p348</ref> Although the story evokes universal themes of romance and love, some say that it also examines the properties of the \"Australian character\": existential isolation and strong cultural ties to Great Britain.

Mr. Duigan avoids melodrama, which is all to the good. Yet his gift for the acutely observed commonplace detail is neither strong nor original enough to transform the movie into something comparable to so many similar, better films. The best things about \"Flirting\" are the performances. Ms. Newton is delightful as Thandiwe, who is far more sophisticated than Danny and wise enough never to let him know it. Mr. Taylor is also good, although the troubled Danny is not an easy character to play. He's virtually the generic artist-as-a-young-man. Nicole Kidman appears in a supporting role as one of Thandiwe's older classmates, who is less of a snob than she first appears.<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |author-link=Vincent Canby |date=6 November 1992 |title=Review/ Film; First Love And Sartre, As a Youth Grows Up |work=The New York Times |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE7DA1138F935A35752C1A964958260}}</ref>\n\nIn his review for ''[[The Washington Post]],'' [[Desson Thomson]] commented:\n:The movie is full of wonderful scenes: Newton caught hiding in a boys' toilet stall as the unsuspecting lads come in to shower, a line of uniformed boys ritualistically facing a row of ballroom-gowned girls at a school dance, and so on. \"Flirting\" is also full of amusing rejoinders and comments: \"Remember her needs as well as yours,\" suggests Taylor's friend with secondhand Kamasutra wisdom when Taylor heads toward an intended sensual tryst. \"If you can give her pleasure, she'll be back for more.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Howe |first=Desson |author-link=Desson Howe |date=20 November 1992 |title=Flirting |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/flirtingnrhowe_a0af3b.htm |access-date=3 February 2021}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nThe film received the following 1990 [[1990 Australian Film Institute Awards|AFI Awards]]:<ref>{{Cite news |date=October 11, 1990 |title=Top film award goes to Flirting |page=2 |work=[[The Canberra Times]] |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/122316154 |access-date=21 September 2022}}</ref>\n\n*Best Film (Terry Hayes, Doug Mitchell, George Miller)\n*Best Achievement in Editing (Robert Gibson)\n*Best Achievement in Production Design (Roger Ford)\n\nThe film was also nominated for the following 1990 [[1990 Australian Film Institute Awards|AFI Awards]]:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Winners & Nominees |url=https://www.aacta.org/aacta-awards/winners-and-nominees/ |access-date=2022-09-21 |website=www.aacta.org |language=en-AU}}</ref>\n\n*Best Achievement in Sound (Antony Gray, Ross Linton, Phil Judd)\n*Best Actor in Supporting Role (Bartholomew Rose)\n*Best Achievement in Cinematography (Geoff Burton)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cinema of Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223552/http://www.afc.gov.au/filmsandawards/filmdbsearch.aspx?view=title&title=FLIRTI Entry for the film] on the [[Australian Film Commission]] website\n* {{IMDb title|id=0101898|title=Flirting}}\n*[http://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/flirting ''Flirting''] at Oz Movies\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|flirting}}\n* {{Amg movie|17861|Flirting}}\n* [http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Number%3A316583;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10 Flirting at the National Film and Sound Archive]\n\n{{John Duigan}}\n{{Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film 1990-2009}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flirting (Film)}}\n[[Category:1991 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:Australian coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Australian romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Australian independent films]]\n[[Category:Films set in boarding schools]]\n[[Category:Australian sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films about interracial romance]]\n[[Category:Films set in schools]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Duigan]]\n[[Category:The Samuel Goldwyn Company films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by George Miller]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Doug Mitchell]]\n[[Category:1991 independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s teen romance films]]\n[[Category:1990s coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Australian teen comedy-drama films]]"}]}}}}
