Directed by [[Harry Winer]], story by Patrick Bailey and Larry B. Williams, screenplay by Clifford Green (as W. W. Wicket) and Casey T. Mitchell, the film stars [[Kate Capshaw]], [[Kelly Preston]], [[Larry B. Scott]], [[Lea Thompson]], [[Tate Donovan]], and [[Joaquin Phoenix|Leaf Phoenix]].\n\n''SpaceCamp'' received mixed reviews and is famous for being a \"marketing nightmare,\" as it was released less than five months after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' accident]] of January 28, 1986 (although filming was completed before the disaster occurred).<ref name=AVClub /> At the time of release, some thought the movie was trying to capitalize on the shuttle tragedy and should never have been released. However, those associated with ''SpaceCamp'' disagreed and added they had taken extra care to avoid any appearance of exploiting a national tragedy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Willistein |first1=Paul |title=WHEN HOLLYWOOD FICTION BECOMES REAL-LIFE FACT MAKERS OF 'SPACECAMP' GRAPPLE WITH CHALLENGER TRAGEDY |url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1986-06-06-2522155-story.html |website=The Morning Call |date=6 June 1986}}</ref>\n\nThe film performed poorly at the box office, grossing less than $10 million in the US. The script was later adapted into a novel, which did include references to the ''Challenger'' explosion and some of the kids' decisions to attend Space Camp in the wake of said tragedy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/spacecampnoveliz00hill|title=SpaceCamp: a novelization for young readers|last1=Hiller|first1=B.

They meet their instructor Andie Bergstrom, a [[NASA Astronaut Corps|NASA-trained astronaut]] who is frustrated that she has not yet been assigned to a [[Space Shuttle]] mission.  Her bitterness is compounded by the fact that her husband, camp director Zach Bergstrom, is an astronaut who has walked on the Moon.\n\nMax befriends a [[robot]] named Jinx, which was deemed unsuitable for space work because it overheated and was overly literal.  Max and the robot declare themselves to be \"friends forever\". Kathryn declares her dream to become the first female Shuttle commander, and is frustrated when Andie assigns that role to Kevin instead to teach him responsibility. Kevin pursues Kathryn romantically, Rudy shares his wish to open the first [[Fast food restaurant|Fast food franchise]] on the Moon and Tish reveals that despite appearing to be a [[Valley girl]], she is a genius with a [[photographic memory]].\n\nKathryn and Kevin sneak away for some romance near the [[Launch Complex 39|Launch pad]], but Jinx unintentionally gives them away when Andie and Zach discover they are missing. During a confrontation, Andie explains that she believes Kathryn has what it takes to accomplish her ambition, and explains the necessity of the harsh treatment Andie is giving her. While Kathryn vows to improve her performance, Zach's conversation with Kevin is less successful.\n\nKevin takes out his anger on Max. Upset, Max states \"...I wish I was in space\". Jinx overhears and takes what Max said literally. The campers are allowed to sit in the [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']] during a routine [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|Engine]] test. Jinx secretly enters NASA's computer room and triggers a \"thermal curtain failure\", causing one of the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|boosters]] to ignite during the test. In order to avoid a crash, [[Launch Control Center|Launch Control]] is forced to ignite the second booster and launch the Shuttle.\n\nThe Shuttle is not flight ready, has no long range radio and insufficient on-board oxygen to last to the re-entry window at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. Andie takes the Shuttle to the partially constructed [[Space Station]] ''Daedalus'' to retrieve oxygen stored there. Realizing that while they have no voice communications with NASA they do have [[telemetry]], Tish begins using a switch to send a [[Morse code]] signal to NASA, but it is not noticed by ground control.\n\nAndie is slightly too big to reach the oxygen cylinders, so Max suits up for an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]. During a critical moment, Max begins to panic until Kevin, knowing that Max is a fan of ''[[Star Wars]]'', begins calling him [[Luke Skywalker|\"Luke\"]], and tells him to \"use [[the Force]]\", which calms him enough to complete the mission, allowing Max and Andie to retrieve the containers.\n\nIn the Shuttle, Rudy attempts to decipher the technical schematics to work out how to feed the oxygen into the Shuttle's tanks. His lack of confidence combined with the time pressure frustrates Kathryn, who tries reading the diagram herself and gives Andie instructions that conflict with Rudy's. Andie follows Rudy's correct instructions. Kathryn's self-confidence is shaken as she realizes her interference nearly caused disaster.\n\nThe second oxygen tank malfunctions, injuring Andie. Unaware of this, Ground Control begins the autopilot sequence to land the Shuttle \u2013 closing the bay doors and stranding Andie outside.  Andie regains consciousness and urges them to leave her and take the re-entry window, as the Shuttle does not have enough oxygen to make the next window. Kathryn is unable to make a decision, but Kevin shows himself to be the Shuttle Commander and overrides the autopilot, enabling Max to rescue Andie. Having missed the Edwards re-entry window, the crew comes up with a plan to land at [[White Sands Space Harbor|White Sands, New Mexico]] after Rudy recalls the [[STS-3|1982 Space Shuttle mission that landed there]]. Armed with this news, Tish uses Morse Code to signal NASA to let them land there.\n\nAt Ground Control, Jinx brings the signal to Zach's attention and they prepare for the White Sands landing.  With Andie injured, Kathryn fulfils her role as Shuttle Pilot, but frets and doubts her abilities until Kevin cajoles and teases her into guiding ''Atlantis'' through re-entry and landing it at White Sands.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kate Capshaw]] as Andie Bergstrom, a camp instructor and [[astronaut]].\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Zach Bergstrom, the camp director, \"flown\" astronaut, and Andie's husband.\n* [[Lea Thompson]] as Kathryn Fairly, who idolizes Andie and wants to be the first female shuttle commander. However, she is assigned the [[Pilot (aircraft)#Pilots in Space|Pilot]] role.\n* [[Tate Donovan]] as Kevin Donaldson. Kevin is initially arrogant and selfish until Andie assigns him the role of [[Commander#NASA rank|Commander]] to teach him responsibility, much to Kathryn's dismay.\n* [[Larry B. Scott]] as Rudy Tyler. Rudy loves science, but admits he is sometimes not very good at it.\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Tish Ambros\u00e9. Tish appears to be a typical \"Valley girl\" teenager, but is actually highly intelligent and has an [[eidetic memory]].\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix|Leaf Phoenix]] as Max Graham, an eager 12-year-old boy who has been to Junior Camp twice, whom Andie finally allows to stay at the main camp. He frequently makes references to ''Star Wars''.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as the voice of Jinx, a sentient [[robot]] who befriends Max. Jinx facilitates the group's launch into space and then helps rescue them by discovering Tish's telemetry in Morse code. Jinx takes everything literally.\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was made in the summer of 1985<ref name=AFI>{{AFI film|57478}}</ref> and was the last film made by [[ABC Motion Pictures]] which was closed down in October 1985.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fabrikant|first1=Geraldine|title=ABC Discontinues Movie Operations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/29/business/abc-discontinues-movie-operations.html|access-date=December 20, 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 29, 1985}}</ref>\n\nThe film was the feature film directorial debut of [[Harry Winer]].<ref name=AFI/>\n\nLea Thompson mentioned in an interview that after their first day of shooting, they were ten days behind schedule and what was supposed to be a three-month shoot became six.

Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave it a one and half star rating, saying that \"Our thoughts about the Space Shuttle will never be the same again, and our memories are so painful that ''SpaceCamp'' is doomed even before it begins.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Spacecamp'|work= Chicago Sun Times|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/spacecamp-1986}}</ref>  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' says that \"''SpaceCamp'' never successfully integrates summer camp hijinks with outer space idealism to come up with a dramatically compelling story\",<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Spacecamp'|work= Variety|date=1985-12-31|url= https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117795084.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0|access-date=2010-11-02}}</ref> while James Sanford of the ''[[Kalamazoo Gazette]]'' responds \"Not exactly out of this world\". Website At-A-Glance gave the film an even worse review, \"It's tough to accept this movie's premise. A bunch of kids are given a tour of the Space Shuttle as NASA is testing its engines. An accident happens, and they, along with their guide, are launched into space. Once up there, can they be talked back down? Add an annoying, seemingly sentient robot into the mix. Add the standard 'two dimensional character development' arc, where each member of the cast overcomes his or her single character trait/flaw by the end of the story. Add gobs of sap, gushiness, and boredom. Mix well, and you've got a first-class mess.\"\n\nIn a 2012 interview with ''[[The A.V.
