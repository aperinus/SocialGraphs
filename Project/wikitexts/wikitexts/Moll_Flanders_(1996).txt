The film, which vastly differs from the original novel, was written and directed by [[Pen Densham]]. The original music score was composed by [[Mark Mancina]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{More plot|date=November 2018}}\nIn the late 17th century, a black gentleman, Hibble, takes custody of a girl, Flora, who is being physically mistreated by abusive nuns at a London orphanage. The two set off on a journey to the American colonies where Flora will be raised by her guardian, Mrs Allworthy. As they set out, Hibble begins to read to Flora the memoirs of her mother, Moll Flanders.\n\nIn a flashback, Moll Flanders' story unfolds. After bearing her in a prison cell, Moll's own mother was hanged for theft. Moll grows up in a church orphanage. When a priest sexually assaults her, she stabs him with a knitting needle and is in turn whipped.\n\nMoll escapes despite being arrested and is eventually taken in by Mrs Allworthy, the ruthless proprietor of an upscale London [[Brothel#Europe|brothel]]. Life as a prostitute takes a toll on Moll and, although she befriends Hibble, she is mistreated by her madame, Mrs Allworthy. Eventually, a kind but eccentric [[Cadaver#In art|anatomy artist]] named Jonathan begins paying her to model for him. He starts to earn Moll's trust by taking her in after she is brutally beaten by an angry religious group.\n\nMoll gradually falls in love with Jonathan and becomes pregnant. For a while, despite his wealthy parents disowning him, their life seems happy. Then Jonathan grows gravely ill and dies. Devastated by the loss, Moll later gives birth to a baby girl. She encounters Allworthy and her stalwart servant Hibble once more, when Allworthy kidnaps Moll and takes her aboard a ship bound for [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]], forcing her to abandon her daughter in London.\n\nOn the voyage, a storm forces the ship into a frenzy. Seizing the opportunity, Moll fights against Allworthy for control. The fight ends when both women are swept away by the raging current. Hibble looks on, horrified.\n\nAfter finishing his story, Hibble proclaims that Moll was lost at sea. Disillusioned, Flora blames Hibble for not saving her mother and nearly runs away before Moll shows up, alive and well, having survived the storm and taken Allworthy's identity and associated fortune. Moll reconciles with her daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright]] as Moll Flanders\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Hibble\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Mrs Allworthy\n* [[John Lynch (actor)|John Lynch]] as Jonathan (the Artist)\n* [[Brenda Fricker]] as Mrs Mazzawatti\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Edna\n* Aisling Corcoran as Flora\n* [[Jeremy Brett]] as Artist's Father\n* Britta Smith as Artist's Mother\n* [[Cathy Murphy]] as Polly\n* Emma McIvor as Mary\n* [[Maria Doyle Kennedy]] as Alice\n\n==Production==\nDensham was inspired to make the film after listening to an NPR radio piece about letters from 18th-century women who had abandoned their children. The film was shot in Ireland. Freeman and Wright worked for modest salaries, liking the script.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1996/06/14/denshams-love-affair-with-moll/5f2a0044-727d-47ec-a8a5-8335cd4b2c7b/ |title=DENSHAM'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH MOLL' |date=1996-06-14 |author1=Desson Howe |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |place=Washington, D.C. |issn=0190-8286 |oclc=1330888409}}</ref> This was the final role for [[Jeremy Brett]] who, having died in September 1995, appears uncredited in the posthumously released film.\n\nThe film was released in 1996, but still uses a 1995 copyright notice in the closing credits.\n\n==Critical reception ==\nBased on 24 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Moll Flanders'' currently has a 46% approval rating from critics.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1071414-moll_flanders/ ''Moll Flanders'' (1996)] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]</ref> A problem many critics had was with the movie largely throwing out the original Defoe story and structuring it like ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (in which Wright was prominently featured). While the original book was about a woman's struggle to survive a male-dominated era (the early 17th century) and her turning to illegal actions to make it through stealing and prostitution, among other means, the movie dealt with Moll's working on herself and improving her life.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F05E3D91739F937A25755C0A960958260 ''New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the movie three stars and said of the film \"it's an original; Densham took only the name, the period, and a few notions from Defoe, and has made up the rest.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960614/REVIEWS/606140302/1023 Roger Ebert's review] in the ''Chicago Sun-Times''</ref> ''Variety'' wrote that Wright's performance, 'should send (Wright) to the upper echelon of actresses with the talent, charisma and unflagging watchability to carry a movie.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/moll-flanders-1200445744/|title=Moll Flanders|date=May 24, 1996}}</ref> ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the film a C grade.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1996/06/28/moll-flanders/|title=Moll Flanders|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe [[International Press Academy]] nominated ''Moll Flanders'' for four awards: [[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright]] for Best Actress in a Drama, [[John Lynch (actor)|John Lynch]] for Supporting Actor in a drama, [[Stockard Channing]] for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama, and for [[Consolata Boyle]]'s Costume Design.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0117071|Moll Flanders}}\n* {{Mojo title|mollflanders}}\n* {{amg title|136310|Moll Flanders}}\n\n{{Pen Densham}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about identity theft]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on romance novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on historical novels]]\n[[Category:Romantic period films]]\n[[Category:Romantic epic films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Mancina]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 17th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:1990s historical drama films]]\n[[Category:American historical drama films]]\n[[Category:Spelling Films films]]\n[[Category:1990s historical romance films]]\n[[Category:American historical romance films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Pen Densham]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
