The film was successful in Denmark, but did not live up to the success of Refn's previous film ''[[Pusher (1996 film)|Pusher]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows the friends Leo and Lenny, who live in [[N\u00f8rrebro]], a working-class neighborhood in [[Copenhagen]]. Leo lives in a rundown apartment with his girlfriend Louise. Lenny is a shy and quiet film expert who works with his and Leo's mutual friend Kitjo, in a video store that rents out [[art film]]s as well as a huge collection of pornographic films.\n\nAs a subplot, we follow Lenny, who is trying to build a relationship to Lea, a girl that works in a local grill bar. Lenny asks Lea out to see a movie, but he chickens out when he sees her at the theatre. Lenny spends most of his time both at home and at work watching films.\n\nWhen Leo finds out that Louise is pregnant and wants to keep the baby, he becomes more and more aggressive. After witnessing a beating at a club he gets himself a gun. During a normal film night, Leo pulls a gun on Lenny and Kitjo. Leo berates Lenny for his life style, and expresses his disdain for his own life, feeling trapped in a dead end. Later Leo, in despair, hits Louise, and is threatened by her brother, Louis. When it happens again, Louise loses the baby. Louis takes a gruesome revenge by injecting [[HIV]] infected blood into Leo's body. Leo retaliates in an equally gruesome manner, shooting Louis in the stomach, then shooting off his own hand and letting the blood drip into Louis' wound. Leo then commits suicide.\n\nKitjo brings Lenny to Leo's funeral but Lenny cannot bring himself to go. Life continues, and Lenny casually tells Kitjo that he has been offered a job in another store, but does not think he will accept as he has to change his routine. Lenny seeks up Lea again. They both seem shy towards each other, and have trouble communicating. Lenny asks Lea out a second time; the final image of the film shows them alone in the grill/bar where Lea works thus ending the film on a hopeful note.\n\n==Cast==\n''Bleeder'' features a relatively small [[ensemble cast]], where the most of the actors, except Corfixen and Andersson, previously starred in Refn's debut film ''Pusher''. Jensen only had a small role in ''Pusher'', his role in ''Bleeder'' is more developed.\n\n* [[Kim Bodnia]] - Leo\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] - Lenny\n* [[Rikke Louise Andersson]] - Louise\n* [[Levino Jensen]] - Louis\n* [[Liv Corfixen]] - Lea\n* [[Zlatko Buri\u0107]] - Kitjo\n* [[Claus Flygare]] - Joe\n* Marko Zecewic - Marko\n* Gordana Radosavljevic - Mika\n* Dusan Zecewic - Dusan \n* Ole Abildgaard - Video shop customer\n* Karsten Schr\u00f8der - R\u00f8de\n* Sven Erik Eskeland Larsen - Svend\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{infobox album\n|name = Bleeder\n|type = soundtrack\n|artist = various artists\n|genre = [[Punk rock]]\n|released = 1999\n}}\nMusic is used heavily throughout the entire film.
