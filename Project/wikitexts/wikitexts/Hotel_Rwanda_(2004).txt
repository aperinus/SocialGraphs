Based on the [[Rwandan genocide]], which occurred during the spring of 1994, the film documents Rusesabagina's efforts to save the lives of his family and more than 1,000 other refugees by providing them with shelter in the besieged [[H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burr|first=Ty|date=7 January 2005|title=Hotel Rwanda Movie Review: Cheadle brings quiet power to 'Rwanda'|url=https://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&id=7112|url-status=dead|journal=[[Boston Globe]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430050749/http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&id=7112|archive-date=April 30, 2008|access-date=9 April 2007}}</ref> ''Hotel Rwanda'' explores [[genocide]], political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.<ref name=\"film\"/>\n\nThe film was a co-production between [[United Artists]] and [[Lions Gate Films]], and was commercially distributed by United Artists theatrically and by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for home media. ''Hotel Rwanda'' premiered in theaters in limited release in the United States on 22 December 2004 and in wide release on 4 February 2005, grossing more than $23 million in domestic ticket sales. It earned an additional $10 million in business through international release to top out at a combined total of nearly $34 million in gross revenue.\n\nThe film was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Cheadle), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Okonedo), and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn April 1994, tensions between the [[Hutu]]-controlled government and [[Tutsi]] rebels led to [[Rwandan genocide|genocide in Rwanda]], where corruption and bribes between politicians were routine. [[Paul Rusesabagina]], manager of the Belgian-owned [[H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines]], is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana is Tutsi. Their marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, including [[Georges Rutaganda]], a goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of [[Interahamwe]], a brutal Hutu militia.\nPaul carries favor with [[Rwandan Army]]  general [[Augustin Bizimungu]], who favors the Hutu. Following the [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|assassination of the president]], a Hutu, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed, initiating the early stages of the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]]. When [[Rwandan Civil War|civil war]] erupts and a [[Rwandan Army]] Captain threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety and brings them to the hotel. Upon returning with them, he finds his insolent receptionist Gregoire occupying the presidential suite and threatening to expose the Tutsi refugees, including Paul's wife, if he is made to work.\nThe UN peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver, are forbidden to intervene in the conflict and prevent the genocide. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind.\nMore evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened United Nations refugee camp, the [[Red Cross]], and various orphanages, totaling 800, both Tutsi and Hutu. Tatiana desperately searches for her brother, sister-in-law, and two nieces. As the situation becomes more violent, Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, protect his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning 4-star hotel. Paul forces Gregoire to work with the help of General Bizimungu.\n\nLow on supplies, Paul and Gregoire drive to collect hotel supplies from Georges Rutaganda and witness the [[Interahamwe]] militia raping Tutsi hostages. Georges explains to Paul that the \"rich cockroaches'\" money will become worthless since all of the Tutsis will be killed. Paul expresses disbelief that the Hutu extremists will wipe out all of the Tutsis, but Georges replies: \"Why not? We are halfway there already.\" They return to the hotel through the dark, thick fog, on the riverside road recommended by Georges, only to find it is carpeted with dead bodies.\n\nWhen the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, Gregoire betrays them to the Interahamwe, who use radio broadcasts to accost them. After giving General Bizimungu the remaining valuables and Scotch from his office safe to protect the refugees, Paul then admonishes Bizimungu for genocide apathy and promises to testify on his behalf for his help.\nSoon afterward, Paul's family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel through retreating masses of refugees and militia to reach safety behind [[Rwandan Patriotic Front|Tutsi rebel]] lines and are reunited with their nieces.\n\nThe end title cards explain that Paul saved at least 1,200 Tutsi and Hutu refugees. He and his family, who adopted the two nieces, moved to [[Belgium]], but Tatiana's brother Thomas and his wife were never found. The genocide came to an end in July 1994 when the Tutsi rebels drove the Hutu and the Interahamwe militia across the border into the Congo. At least 491,000 people died in the genocide. Georges and Bizimungu were tried and sentenced for war crimes, with Georges receiving a life sentence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Don Cheadle UNEP 2011 (cropped).jpg\n| width1 = 155\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Paul Rusesabagina.jpg\n| width2 = 155\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Actor Don Cheadle (L) portrayed Rwandan hotelier Paul Rusesabagina (R)\n}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as [[Paul Rusesabagina]]\n* [[Sophie Okonedo]] as [[Tatiana Rusesabagina]]\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Colonel Oliver, loosely based on General [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]]\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Jack Daglish, loosely based on peacekeeper [[Stefan Stec (UN peacekeeper)|Stefan Stec]]\n* [[Fana Mokoena]] as General [[Augustin Bizimungu]]\n* [[Cara Seymour]] as Pat Archer\n* [[David O'Hara]] as Dave Flemming\n* [[Tony Kgoroge]] as Gregoire\n* [[Desmond Dube]] as Dube\n* [[Hakeem Kae-Kazim]] as [[Georges Rutaganda]]\n* [[Leleti Khumalo]] as Fedens\n* [[Antonio Lyons]] as Thomas Mirama\n* [[Mosa Kaiser]] as Elys Rusesabagina\n* [[Mduduzi Mabaso]] as a Hutu lieutenant\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Mr. Tillens (uncredited)\n* [[Eugene Wanangwa Khumbanyiwa]] as Hotel Staff (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production and historical accuracy==\nSharing his thoughts about the lack of international intervention during the crisis, director George commented, \"It's simple, ...
