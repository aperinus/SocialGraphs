Set in 1947 [[London]] at the time of the [[wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten]], the film follows an American brother-sister [[musical ensemble|song]] and [[dance ensemble|dance]] duo who, while performing, each fall in love\u2013he, with a female dancer, and she, with an impoverished but well-connected nobleman. The film marked Donen's second directorial feature. It was released as '''''Wedding Bells''''' in the United Kingdom.<ref name=var51 />\n \n''Royal Wedding'' is one of several MGM musicals that [[List of films in the public domain in the United States|entered the public domain]] because the studio failed to renew the [[copyright registration]] in the 28th year after its publication.<ref name=pubdomain />\n\n==Plot==\nThe story sees brother and sister Tom and Ellen Bowen as stars of a show ''Every Night at Seven'', a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] success. They are persuaded to take the show to London, capitalizing on the [[wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh|imminent royal wedding]] of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten.\n\n[[File:Royal Wedding (1951) 1.jpg|thumb|267px|[[Peter Lawford]], [[Jane Powell]] and [[Fred Astaire]] in ''Royal Wedding'']]\n\nOn the ship, Ellen meets and quickly falls in love with the impoverished but well-connected Lord John Brindale. Whilst casting the show in London, Tom falls in love with a newly engaged dancer, Anne Ashmond. Tom assists Anne in reconciling her estranged parents and also asks his agent to locate Anne's supposed fianc\u00e9 in [[Chicago]] \u2013 only to discover that he's married and therefore Anne is free to do what she likes.\n\nCarried away by the emotion of the wedding, the two couples decide that they will also be married that day. Thanks to the resourcefulness of Tom's London agent, Edgar Klinger, who knows someone in the Archbishop's office who can cut through the official red tape and also has a cooperative minister in his pocket, Anne and Tom, and Ellen and John, are in fact married on the royal wedding day.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Tom Bowen\n* [[Jane Powell]] as Ellen Bowen\n* [[Peter Lawford]] as Lord John Brindale\n* [[Sarah Churchill (actress)|Sarah Churchill]] as Anne Ashmond\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Irving Klinger / Edgar Klinger\n* [[Albert Sharpe]] as James Ashmond\n\n==Production==\n[[Stanley Donen]] and [[Jane Powell]] were not part of the film's original crew and cast; former dancer [[Charles Walters]] was the film's original director, with [[June Allyson]] as Astaire's co-star.<ref name=tcmprint /> [[Judy Garland]] was then signed as Ellen due to Allyson's pregnancy, over the objection of Walters who had spent a year-and-a-half nurturing her through her previous film, ''[[Summer Stock]]''. Instead of listening to Walters' objection, [[Arthur Freed]] brought in Donen as director; Garland, who during rehearsal worked only half-days, started calling in sick as [[principal photography]] was to begin. Her behavior prompted Freed to replace her with Jane Powell and suspend Garland. According to Garland biographer, Gerold Frank, she was despondent about her career and personal life and she asked MGM to be released from her contract. MGM agreed and the contract that had begun in 1935 was abrogated on September 28, 1950.<ref name=tcmprint /><ref name=\"Judy\">{{Cite book |last=Frank |first=Gerold |title=Judy |publisher=Harper & Row |year=1975 |edition=1st |location=New York |pages=284\u2013285}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in 1950, from July 6 to August 24; retakes took place in mid-October.<ref name=tcmprint />\n\nThe scene featuring the song \"You're All the World to Me\" was filmed by building a set inside a revolving barrel and mounting the camera and its operator to an [[ironing board]] which could be rotated along with the room.<ref name=tcmprint /> Astaire danced in the barrel set as if he really danced on the wall and ceiling. It inspired the [[Lionel Richie]] song \"[[Dancing on the Ceiling]]\" with the music video featuring Richie doing the same room dance as a tribute to Astaire.\n\n==Notable songs and dance routines==\n[[File:Astaire - Sunday Jumps 2.jpg|right|thumb|267px|Astaire in \"Sunday Jumps\"]]\n[[File:Astaire - You're All the World to Me.jpg|right|thumb|267px|Astaire in \"You're All the World to Me\"]]\n\nThe songs in ''Royal Wedding'' were written by [[Burton Lane]] (music) and [[Alan Jay Lerner]] (lyrics).  The dances were choreographed by Nick Castle.<ref name=afi>{{AFI film|50273|Royal Wedding}}</ref>\n\n* \"Ev'ry Night At Seven\": The film's opening number has Astaire and Powell perform from the \"play within a play\" Broadway musical that their characters are taking to London.\n* \"Sunday Jumps\": Astaire parodies himself by dancing with a [[hatrack]]. The fame of the dance rests on Astaire's ability to animate the inanimate. The solo takes place in a ship's gym, where Astaire is waiting to rehearse with his partner Powell, who doesn't turn up, echoing Adele Astaire's attitude toward her brother's obsessive rehearsal habits to which the lyrics (unused and unpublished) also made reference.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In 1997, Astaire's widow Robyn authorized [[Dirt Devil]] to use a digitally altered version of the scene where Astaire dances with their product in a commercial; Astaire's daughter Ava objected publicly to the commercial, implying they had \"tarnish[ed] his image\" and saying it was \"the antithesis of everything my lovely, gentle father represented\"<ref name=vacuum />\n* \"Open Your Eyes\": This [[waltz]] is sung by Powell at the beginning of a romantic routine danced by Powell and Astaire in front of an audience in the ballroom of a transatlantic liner. Soon, a storm rocks the ship and the duet is transformed into a comic routine with the dancers sliding about to the ship's motions. This number is based on a real-life incident which happened to Fred and Adele Astaire as they traveled by ship to London in 1923.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* \"The Happiest Days of My Life\": Powell's character sings this ballad to Lawford, with Astaire sitting at the piano.\n* \"How Could You Believe Me When I Said I Love You When You Know I've Been a Liar All My Life\" has what is considered the longest title of any song in MGM musical history. For the first time in his career,{{Sfn|Mueller|1985|p=327}} Astaire casts aside all pretension to elegance and indulges in a comic song and dance [[vaudeville]]-style with Powell. The routine recalls the \"A Couple Of Swells\" number with [[Judy Garland]] in ''[[Easter Parade (1948 film)|Easter Parade]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Here, for the second time in the film, he seems to parody Gene Kelly by wearing the latter's trademark straw boater and employing the stomps and splayed strides that originated with [[George M. Cohan]] and were much favored in Kelly's choreography.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* \"Too Late Now\": Powell sings her third ballad, this time an open declaration of love, to Lawford.\n* \"[[You're All the World to Me]]\": In one of his best-known solos, Astaire dances on the walls and ceilings of his room because he has fallen in love with a beautiful woman who also loves to dance. The idea occurred to Astaire back in the 1920s and was first mentioned by him in the MGM publicity publication ''Lion's Roar'' in 1945.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* \"I Left My Hat in Haiti\": This number, essentially the work of dance director Nick Castle, involves Powell, Astaire, and chorus in a song and dance routine with a Caribbean theme.\n\n==Reception==\nAccording to MGM's records, the film earned $2,548,000 in the US and Canada and $1,354,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit to the studio of $584,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/> The film was listed by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' as one of the top box office hits of 1951.<ref name=boxoffice />\n\nUpon its release, [[Bosley Crowther]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film had \"a lively lot of dancing and some pleasantly handled songs\"; according to Crowther, \"Mr. Astaire has fared better in his lifetime - and he has also fared much worse.\"<ref name=NYTimes/>\n\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Royal Wedding'' had a 91% approval rating based on 23 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \"Vintage MGM musical stuff, characterized by Stanley Donen's fleet direction and some amazing dance performances from star Fred Astaire.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/royal_wedding/|title=Royal Wedding|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=9 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\"Too Late Now\" was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[24th Academy Awards]], losing the award to \"[[In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening]]\" by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and [[Johnny Mercer]], which featured in ''[[Here Comes the Groom]]''.\n\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2002: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]] \u2013 Nominated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/passions400.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions Nominees |access-date=2016-08-19}}</ref>\n* 2006: [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals]] \u2013 Nominated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/musicals_ballot.pdf |title= AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals Nominees |access-date=2016-08-19}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2007, [[Warner Home Video]] released ''Royal Wedding'' in a DVD set as part of its \"Classic Musicals From The Dream Factory\" series, along with \"three fine-but-unexceptional films directed by [[Norman Taurog]]\" and two other films: ''[[The Belle of New York (1952 film)|The Belle of New York]]'' and ''[[The Pirate (1948 film)|The Pirate]]''.<ref name=dvd/>\n\nThe film was later featured in an [[List of Cinema Insomnia episodes|episode of ''Cinema Insomnia'']].<ref name=CinemaInsomnia.com/> It is also distributed through Corinth Films.<ref name=CorinthFilms/>\n\nThe songs listed [[Royal Wedding#Notable songs and dance routines|above]] were published by MGM on an early 10 inch [[LP record|long play record]] recorded at 33\u2153 rpm (MGM E-543).\n\nThe song \"Sunday Jumps\" was referenced by [[Mel Gibson]] in ''[[What Women Want]]'' and by [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] in the [[Talking Heads]] concert film ''[[Stop Making Sense]]''.  \"Sunday Jumps\" was also parodied by [[Kermit the Frog]] in ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|3|refs=\n\n<ref name=boxoffice>Staff (January 2, 1952) \"The Top Box Office Hits of 1951\", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''</ref>\n\n<ref name=tcmprint>{{cite web|url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2942/Royal-Wedding/articles.html | title= Royal Wedding| first= Frank|last=  Miller | publisher= [[Turner Classic Movies]] | access-date=2013-02-02 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=var51>{{cite web| url= https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117794590/ |title= Royal Wedding| year= 1951 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=pubdomain>{{cite journal |first=David |last=Pierce |date=June 2007 |title=Forgotten Faces: Why Some of Our Cinema Heritage Is Part of the Public Domain  |journal=Film History: An International Journal |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=125\u201343 |issn=0892-2160 |oclc=15122313 |jstor= 25165419 |doi=10.2979/FIL.2007.19.2.125 |s2cid=191633078 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=vacuum>{{cite web| url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117863031| title= Astaire won't deal with the Devil| date= February 25, 1997| publisher= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| first= Army |last=Archerd| author-link= Army Archerd| access-date=2012-11-11 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite web|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEEDE1638E43BBC4153DFB566838A649EDE&pagewanted=print | title= Fred Astaire and Jane Powell Seen in 'Royal Wedding' at Radio City Music Hall| date= March 9, 1951| first= Bosley |last= Crowther| author-link= Bosley Crowther| work= [[The New York Times]] | access-date=2012-11-11}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=CinemaInsomnia.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemainsomnia.com/show.php |title=Cinema Insomnia, with your Horror Host, Mister Lobo! - SHOW INFORMATION |access-date=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328140102/http://www.cinemainsomnia.com/show.php |archive-date=March 28, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=CorinthFilms>{{cite web | url=  http://www.corinthfilms.com/details.php?id=377 | title=  The Royal Wedding | access-date=  2012-11-11 | url-status=  dead | archive-url=  https://archive.today/20130120015120/http://www.corinthfilms.com/details.php?id=377 | archive-date=  2013-01-20 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=dvd>{{cite web| first=Noel |last= Murray| date= August 1, 2007| title= Classic Musicals From The Dream Factory &mdash; DVD &mdash;| work= Home Video Review | publisher= [[The A.V.
