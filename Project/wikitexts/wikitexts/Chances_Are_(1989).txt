In 1987, 23 years later, his widow Corinne still misses him, ignoring the frustrated devotion of his best friend Phillip Train, who has pretty much raised Louie's only daughter Miranda as his own. Miranda, while a student at [[Yale University]], meets Alex Finch, who works in the library but is about to graduate.\n\nAfter graduation, Alex heads to Washington, D.C., where he makes his way to the offices of ''[[The Washington Post]]''. His first attempts to meet with [[Ben Bradlee]] thwarted, he schemes his way into Bradlee's office by pretending to be a delivery man. Alex walks into Bradlee's office, with Phillip behind him. Confounded by the young man, Bradlee asks who he is. When Alex attempts to remind him of their meeting at Yale, Phillip vouches for him, which changes his mind about giving him a meeting. Unfortunately, Bradlee feels Alex needs more time working on smaller papers before he can offer him a job. Feeling defeated, Alex leaves his office.\n\nPhillip finds Alex downstairs in the lobby, who offers Phillip a ride, during which Phillip invites Alex to meet the Jeffries family over dinner. While at the Jeffries' home, which he'd never previously been to, Alex begins to have flashbacks of a previous life. Anguished, he begins to act crazed and confused. Putting the pieces together, Alex realizes he is Louie Jeffries, Corinne's dead husband, reincarnated.\n\nMiranda, wanting to continue the flirtation that started when they met, is confused when Alex rebuffs her and orders her to go to her room when she kisses him. Alex then goes to Corrine and tries to convince Corrine that he's Louie. At first she doesn't believe him, but he tells her details about their earlier life together that only Louie would know. She finally gives in and they kiss. They take a trip together away from town, but Corrine is a little disturbed when people think Alex is her son. Louie/Alex wants to make love, but Corrine reveals she hasn't had sex since Louie died.\n\nOne night when Alex and Corrine are together, they're caught by Phillip, who accuses Alex of being a gold digger. Louie/Alex then reminds Phillip he declared his love for Corinne to Louie on their wedding day. Phillip is confused and tries to punch Alex but he gets punched instead, knocking him out. Corinne rushes to Phillip's side, and yells at Alex to get out of the room. Louie/Alex realizes then that she loves Phillip too, and Louie must let go.\n\nCorrine slips a note under Alex's door, saying she's sorry, and she'll visit him later. Alex puts the still-unconscious Phillip in his bed, so that when Corinne arrives, thinking he's Louie, she accidentally kisses Phillip. He's ecstatic, and Corinne realizes she loves him too. They make love.\n\nAlex spends the night in his car. The next day, he bursts into a courtroom and accuses the judge of accepting a bribe (Alex remembers himself as Louie taking the incriminating photographs of the then younger judge back in 1964). Phillip, who's also in the courtroom, realizes only Louie would know that fact, and now believes Alex is Louie. Alex tells Phillip the location of his camera with the photographs of the judge accepting the bribe. Attempting to escape from the commotion in the courtroom, Alex falls down the stairs, hits his head, and ends up in the hospital. While unconscious, Omar the angel visits Alex, and gives him the special \"shot\" he should have gotten 23 years previous, to forget his past life.\n\nWhen Alex wakes, he's completely forgotten about being Louie, and he tells Miranda that the last thing he remembers is their kissing in the kitchen of her house. Miranda is relieved and delighted. Newspaper headlines show the judge charged with accepting the bribe. Impressed by Alex's journalistic prowess in exposing the corrupt judge, Bradlee offers him a job as a reporter at the ''Post''. Corinne and Phillip get married, and at their wedding, Alex tells Phillip he's in love with Miranda, just as Phillip told Louie he was in love with Corinne on their wedding day all those years earlier.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Corinne Jeffries\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Alex Finch/Louie Jeffries\n* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Phillip Train\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Miranda Jeffries\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Louie Jeffries\n* [[Josef Sommer]] as Judge Fenwick\n* [[Joe Grifasi]] as Omar\n* [[Henderson Forsythe]] as Ben Bradlee\n* [[Fran Ryan]] as Mavis Talmadge\n* [[James Noble (actor)|James Noble]] as Dr. Bailey\n* [[Marc McClure]] as Richard\n* [[Susan Ruttan]] as Woman in the Bookstore\n* [[Mimi Kennedy]] as Sally\n* [[Kathleen Freeman]] as Mrs. Handy\n* [[Dennis Patrick]] as Archibald Blair\n* [[Martin Garner (actor)|Martin Garner]] as Mr. Zellerbach\n* [[Gianni Russo]] as Anthony Bonino\n* [[Lester Lanin]] as Conductor\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Cybill Shepherd at Castle.jpg|right|thumb|Cybill Shepherd inside the \"[[Smithsonian Castle]]\" during the filming of ''Chances Are'', where she plays a Smithsonian curator.
