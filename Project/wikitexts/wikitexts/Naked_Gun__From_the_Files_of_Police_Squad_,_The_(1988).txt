(also known as simply '''''The Naked Gun''''') is a 1988 American [[crime comedy film]] directed by [[David Zucker]] and released by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film stars [[Leslie Nielsen]] as the bumbling police lieutenant [[Frank Drebin]]. [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], [[George Kennedy]], and [[O. J. Simpson]] also star in supporting roles.\n\nThe film features fast-paced [[slapstick]] comedy, including many visual and verbal [[pun]]s and gags. The film is based on the character portrayed by Nielsen in the television series ''[[Police Squad!]]'', and is also a continuation of the latter.<ref>{{cite news|title= Creators of a TV Flop Get Just Dessert with Naked Gun |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 29, 1988|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-29/entertainment/ca-670_1_naked-gun|access-date=November 18, 2010|first=Hilliard|last=Harper}}</ref> The core creative team behind ''Police Squad!'' and the film series includes the team of [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker|David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker]] as well as [[Pat Proft]] in varying combinations.<ref>{{cite news|title= Naked Truth Behind 'Naked Gun' : Direct From the Files of the Play Squad |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 2, 1988|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-12-02/entertainment/ca-1136_1_naked-gun|access-date=November 18, 2010|first=Nina J.|last=Easton}}</ref>\n\nReleased on December 2, 1988, ''The Naked Gun'' was a critical and commercial success, which led to [[The Naked Gun|two sequels]]: ''[[The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear|The Naked Gun {{frac|2|1|2}}: The Smell of Fear]]'' (1991) and ''[[Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult|Naked Gun {{frac|33|1|3}}: The Final Insult]]'' (1994).\n\n==Plot==\nPolice Squad Lieutenant Frank Drebin, taking a vacation in [[Beirut]], disrupts a conference of America's greatest enemies ([[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Fidel Castro]], and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/lists/5-movies-about-assassination-attempts-on-real-leaders-20141222/the-naked-gun-1988-20141219|title=Before Interviewgate: 5 Movies on Real-Leader Assassinations|date=December 22, 2014}}</ref>) who are trying to conceive a terrorist plan to humiliate the U.S. In [[Los Angeles]], Officer Nordberg attempts to bust a [[heroin]] drug operation organized by businessman Vincent Ludwig, and is shot by Ludwig's henchmen. After returning to L.A. and being briefed on the case, Drebin visits Nordberg in the hospital. Nordberg provides cryptic clues, including a picture of Ludwig's ship on which the deal had been organized. Frank also learns that Nordberg's jacket tested positive for heroin.\n\nPolice Squad is put in charge of security for the visit of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] to Los Angeles, and Captain Ed Hocken tells Frank that he has 24 hours to clear Nordberg before word gets out and detracts from the Queen's visit.\n\nAfter a visit from Frank, Ludwig learns that Nordberg is still alive. Ludwig has his assistant, Jane Spencer, help Frank in his investigation, and the two fall in love. However, Jane is unaware of her employer's illegal activities. Meanwhile, Ludwig meets with Pahpshmir, a participant of the Beirut meeting, to discuss an assassination plot against the queen. Ludwig agrees to do it for $20&nbsp;million and explains that he will use a [[pager|beeper]] that can create an assassin using [[post-hypnotic suggestion]]. Ludwig attempts to have Nordberg killed at the hospital by hypnotizing a doctor. Frank successfully protects Nordberg, but also causes the assassin to crash a car into a gasoline truck, then a ballistic missile, and finally a fireworks factory. Because of this, Frank fails to uncover the motive behind the attempted murder.\n\nFrank then breaks into Ludwig's office and searches for evidence. He finds a note from Pahpshmir addressed to Ludwig which confirms his suspicions, but inadvertently starts a fire that destroys the note and the office. Frank later confronts Ludwig with his allegations at a reception for the Queen's arrival. He misinterprets Ludwig's presentation of a musket to the Queen as an attack and tries to protect her, but only causes more of a problem and is fired from Police Squad. Afterward, Jane finds out the plan will be executed at a baseball game at [[Angel Stadium|Anaheim Stadium]] and that one of the players will perform the act.\n\nThe Police Squad arrives at the stadium. In order to search the players, Frank knocks the home plate umpire out and takes his place, frisking the players for weapons while they are at bat. Ludwig eventually activates his \"sleeper\", [[Reggie Jackson]]. Jane alerts Frank, who chases after Jackson and tackles him, but Jackson manages to get away when Frank's action starts a [[bench-clearing brawl]]. Ludwig holds Jane at gunpoint and begins to leave the stadium while Jackson takes aim at the Queen. Frank tries to incapacitate Jackson with a tranquilizer dart, but misses and hits a large woman on the upper deck. She falls over the railing and lands on Jackson, incapacitating him and saving the Queen's life.\n\nFrank follows Ludwig to the top of the stadium and shoots Ludwig with another dart, causing him to fall over the side of the stadium and be struck by a passing bus, run over by a steamroller, and trampled by the [[Spirit of Troy|USC marching band]]. Some of the band members inadvertently step on Ludwig's beeper, triggering Jane to attempt to kill Frank. He breaks Jane's hypnotized state by openly professing his feelings for her and giving her an engagement ring. Frank and Jane meet Mayor Barkley, who reinstates Frank back to Police Squad, and a recovered Nordberg congratulates him. Unfortunately, Frank pushes Nordberg's wheelchair down the stadium stairs by accident and launches him onto the field.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Lt.

The Mariners' opponent was supposed to have been the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] who, despite its willingness to allow [[Dodger Stadium]] to be used for filming, refused to be mentioned in the film because of its objection to the [[bench-clearing brawl]] scene.
