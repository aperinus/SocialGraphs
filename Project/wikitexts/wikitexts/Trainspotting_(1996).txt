Renton's other friends, aggressive, alcoholic psychopath Francis \"Franco\" Begbie and honest footballer and recreational speed user Tommy Mackenzie, who abstains from heroin, warn him about his dangerous drug habit. Growing tired of his reckless lifestyle, Renton attempts to wean himself off heroin with a bare room, foodstuffs, and [[opium]] [[Suppository|suppositories]] given by ill-reputed dealer Mikey Forrester; he also suffers a bout of diarrhoea and has to relieve himself in the dilapidated toilet of a [[betting shop]]. Realizing he has defecated the suppositories into the toilet, he enters a surreal trance in which he plunges headfirst into the toilet to retrieve them.\n\nRenton attempts to lead a \"useful and fulfilling\" life away from heroin. This consists of him meeting Sick Boy in a park where he shoots a stranger's dog with an [[air gun]], supplying Spud with [[amphetamine]] for a job interview that turns disastrous, and stealing a sex tape of Tommy and his girlfriend, Lizzy. At a nightclub, Renton notices that his cessation of heroin use has increased his [[libido]]. He seduces a girl named Diane Coulston, and they return to her apartment to have sex. The following morning, Renton is horrified to learn that she is below the [[age of consent]] and lives with her parents, whom Renton initially assumes are her flatmates. Diane threatens to report him to the police if he does not continue the relationship.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to return to society, Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud [[relapse]] into heroin use; Tommy also begins to dabble in drug use after becoming depressed due to being dumped by Lizzy, thanks to the actions of an unknowing Renton. Even the negligence-induced death of Dawn, the infant daughter of Sick Boy and his girlfriend Allison, does not persuade the group to recover. Later, Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud are caught [[shoplifting]]; Renton and Spud are arrested while Sick Boy narrowly escapes. Spud receives a six-month custodial sentence at [[Edinburgh (HM Prison)|HMP Saughton]], while Renton avoids jail by entering a [[drug rehabilitation]] programme. Despite being given [[methadone]] to help him, Renton quickly relapses and nearly dies of a heroin [[Drug overdose|overdose]] at Swanney's home. Upon returning home after his revival at the hospital, Renton's parents lock him in his childhood bedroom and force him to go [[cold turkey]]. Following a problematic withdrawal punctuated by hallucinations of his friends and visions of Dawn crawling on the ceiling, Renton is released upon the condition of an [[HIV/AIDS]] test. Despite years of sharing syringes with other addicts, Renton tests negative.\n\nNow clean but bored and devoid of a sense of meaning in his life, Renton visits Tommy, who is now severely addicted to heroin and is HIV-positive. On Diane's advice, Renton moves to [[London]] and takes a job as a property letting agent. He begins to enjoy his new life of sobriety in London and corresponds with Diane, who updates him on developments back home. To Renton's shock and frustration, Begbie, wanted for a failed [[armed robbery]], tracks him down and takes refuge with him in his apartment. Sick Boy, now trying to be a [[pimp]] and [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]], soon joins them. Begbie and Sick Boy later attack two of Renton's clientele (at a supposedly impossible-to-sell property where Renton has sent them to get them off his back), resulting in him losing his job. The trio return to Edinburgh to avoid police attention and for the funeral of Tommy, who has died of AIDS-related [[toxoplasmosis]].\n\nFollowing the funeral, Sick Boy asks Renton, Begbie, and Spud (who has been recently released from prison) for help in buying two kilograms of pure heroin from Mikey Forrester (who got it after a drunken night out with two Russian sailors), for the low price of \u00a34,000, to sell on, with Renton needing to supply the remaining \u00a32,000 asking price. After Begbie threatens him, Renton reluctantly covers the remaining cost, and the group returns to London to sell the heroin to a dealer for \u00a316,000. As they celebrate in a pub, Renton secretly suggests to Spud that they could leave with the money, but Spud, motivated by fear and loyalty, refuses. Sick Boy indicates he would happily do so, and Begbie brutally beats a man after a minor accident. Concluding that Begbie and Sick Boy are unpredictable and dangerous, Renton quietly steals the bag of money and leaves the following morning. Spud witnesses him but does not warn the others. Renton leaves \u00a34,000 in a safe deposit box for Spud, who \"never hurt anybody\". Begbie, discovering Renton and the money gone, angrily destroys the hotel room where the four stayed, prompting the police to arrive and arrest him as Sick Boy and Spud flee. Spud discreetly claims his share of the money, and Renton walks away to his new life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as [[Mark Renton|Mark \"Rent Boy\" Renton]]\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Daniel \"Spud\" Murphy\n* [[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Simon \"Sick Boy\" Williamson\n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as Francis \"Franco\" Begbie\n* [[Kevin McKidd]] as Thomas \"Tommy\" Mackenzie\n* [[Kelly Macdonald]] as Diane Coulston\n* [[Peter Mullan]] as Swanney \"Mother Superior\"\n* [[Fiona Bell]] as Diane's Mother\n* Pauline Lynch as Lizzy\n* Susan Vidler as Allison\n* Eileen Nicholas as Mrs Renton\n* [[James Cosmo]] as Davie Renton\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Gail Houston\n* [[Stuart McQuarrie]] as Gav Temperley/American Tourist\n* [[Irvine Welsh]] as Mikey Forrester\n* [[Kevin Allen (actor)|Kevin Allen]] as Andreas\n* [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] as Hugo the Dealer, reprising his role from ''[[Shallow Grave (1994 film)|Shallow Grave]]'' (1994)\n* [[Dale Winton]] as Game Show Host\n* Lauren and Devon Lamb as Baby Dawn (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/scotland-now/danny-boyle-tracks-down-twin-10723412|title=Danny Boyle tracks down twin girls he picked to play tragic tot in Trainspotting and is relieved they aren't drug addicts|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|first=Jenny|last=Morrison|date=2 July 2017|access-date=16 November 2019|archive-date=16 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116143116/https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/scotland-now/danny-boyle-tracks-down-twin-10723412|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nProducer [[Andrew Macdonald (producer)|Andrew Macdonald]] read [[Irvine Welsh]]'s book on a plane in December 1993, and felt that it could be made into a film.<ref name=\"grundy\">{{cite news | last = Grundy | first = Gareth | title = Hey!
