The film stars [[Stephanie Leonidas]], [[Jason Barry]], [[Rob Brydon]], and [[Gina McKee]].\n\nThe music used in the film was composed by [[Iain Ballamy]]. It was produced by [[The Jim Henson Company]]. Gaiman and McKean worked on the film concepts over the course of two weeks at [[Jim Henson]]'s family's home, and actual production of the film took seventeen months.\n\nCreated on a budget of $4 million, the film was originally made as a [[direct-to-video]] film,<ref name=\"weiland\">{{cite web |last= Weiland |first= Jonah |title= Putting on the \"MirrorMask\": Executive Producer Michael Polis on the Film |publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]] |date= August 6, 2004 |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=3869 |access-date= 2009-06-08}}</ref> but had a limited theatrical run in the United States on September 30, 2005, resulting in a domestic theatrical gross of $867,000. The film was also screened at the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]] where it received positive responses. The overall critical reaction to the film was mixed, with critics praising the film's visuals while complaining about the overall story and script.\n\n==Plot==\nHelena Campbell ([[Stephanie Leonidas]]) works with her parents Joanne and Morris ([[Gina McKee]] and [[Rob Brydon]]) at their family circus, but desires to run away and join real life. At the next performance, after Helena and Joanne have a heated argument, Joanne collapses and is taken to the hospital. Ten days later, while Helena is staying with her grandmother, she finds that the doctors determine that Joanne requires an operation, and Helena can only blame herself for the situation.\n\nThat night, she wakes up in a dream-like state and leaves her building to find three performers outside. As they try to perform for Helena, a shadow encroaches on the area and two of the performers are consumed by it. The third performer, Valentine ([[Jason Barry]]), a juggler, helps to quickly direct Helena to safety through the use of magical flying books. She learns they are in the City of Light which is slowly being consumed by shadows, causing its widely varied citizens to flee. Soon Helena is mistaken for the Princess. She and Valentine are taken to the Prime Minister (Brydon). He explains that the Princess from the Land of Shadow stole a charm from the White City, leaving their Queen of Light (McKee) in a state of unnatural sleep and the City vulnerable to the Shadows. Helena notes the resemblance of the Queen and Minister to her mother and father, and offers to help recover the charm along with Valentine. They are unaware their actions are being watched by the Queen of Shadows (also McKee) who has mistaken Helena for her daughter.\n\nHelena and Valentine attempt to stay ahead of the shadows as they follow clues to the charm, learning that it is called the \"MirrorMask\". Helena discovers that by looking through the windows of the buildings, she can see into her bedroom in the real world, through the drawings of windows that she created and hung on the wall of her room. She discovers that a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of herself is living there and behaving radically differently from her. The doppelganger soon becomes aware of her presence in the drawings and begins to destroy them, causing parts of the fantasy world to collapse. Valentine betrays Helena to the Queen of Shadows in exchange for a large reward of jewels. The Queen's servants warp Helena's mind so she will believe she is the Princess of Shadows. Valentine has a change of heart and returns to the Queen's palace, and helps Helena to break the spell on her. They search the Princess' room, and Helena discovers the MirrorMask hidden in the Princess' mirror. They flee the castle with the charm.\n\nAs they escape to Valentine's flying tower, Helena realizes that her doppelganger in the real world is the Princess of Shadows, who had used the MirrorMask to step through the windows in Helena's drawings. The Princess destroys the rest of the drawings in Helena's room, preventing Helena from returning, and Helena and Valentine disappear in the collapsed world. The Princess takes the drawings to the building's roof to disperse the shreds into the wind, but discovers one more drawing Helena had made on the back of the roof door. Helena successfully returns to the real world, sending the Princess back to her realm. At the same time, the Queen of Light finally awakens and the two Cities are restored to their natural balance.\n\nHelena is woken up on the roof by her father, and they to learn that her mother's operation was successful; Helena returns to happily help at the circus. Sometime later, Helena becomes fascinated by a young man, strongly resembling Valentine, who wants to be a juggler for the circus.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stephanie Leonidas]] as Helena Campbell, a young circus performer and aspiring artist who is drawn into a mysterious world of masked people and monsters shortly after her mother is hospitalized. It is eventually revealed that the world she entered was created through her own drawings that she hung up on the walls of her room. Leonidas stated that she expected that filming would be difficult because most of the scenes were done with one or two other actors just with a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] in the background, but also said that \"it all came alive\" for them when they started working.<ref>{{cite web |last= Epstein |first= Daniel Robert |title= Stephanie Leonidas of MirrorMask |publisher= UGO.com |url= http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmTv/features/mirrormask/interview.asp |access-date= 2009-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104003806/http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/mirrormask/interview.asp |archive-date= 4 November 2005}}</ref>\n** Leonidas also portrays The Princess, Helena's parallel self and the Queen of Shadows' rebellious daughter. She uses the MirrorMask to switch places with Helena and hides it in her room. After escaping to the \"real world\", she takes advantage of her new freedom: dressing like a teenage punk, kissing boys, smoking, and arguing with Helena's father.\n* [[Jason Barry]] as Valentine, a juggler who keeps describing himself as a \"very important man\". He is Helena's companion in the dream world, although he betrays Helena by handing over to the Queen of Shadows. He regrets this decision, however, and returns to rescue Helena. He is very proud of his tower, though he mentions that he had an argument with it and that they parted ways. As he and Helena are being pursued by the Queen of Shadows, he calls the tower to aid their escape by shouting an apology to it. When Helena reawakens in her world, she meets him again auditioning as a juggler for the circus.\n* [[Rob Brydon]] as Morris Campbell, Helena's father. A juggler and ringmaster of his family circus, he is a gentle and kind man with an artistic temperament. He is frightened and overwhelmed by his wife's illness. Brydon also plays the Queen of Light's majordomo.\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Joanne Campbell, Helena's mother. A circus acrobat and ticket-seller, Joanne collapses during a skit and is confined in the hospital shortly after having an argument with Helena. After a successful operation, Joanne recovers and returns to circus life with her family.\n** McKee also plays The Queen of Shadows, a possessive mother who treats her daughter like a pet. She mistakes Helena for the Princess who has run away, but when Helena reveals who she is, the Queen does not care as long as she has a daughter.\n** McKee also plays The Queen of Light, a kind ruler. She falls into a deep sleep when the MirrorMask is stolen from her, leaving her city vulnerable to the Shadows.\n\nThe film also features appearances by [[Dora Bryan]] and the voices of [[Stephen Fry]], [[Lenny Henry]], [[Robert Llewellyn]], and others.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nExecutive producer Michael Polis mentioned that the idea of creating ''MirrorMask'' began when [[The Jim Henson Company]] and [[Sony Pictures]] expressed interest in making a film that would sell as well in video release as ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' and ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' based on the two films' consistent DVD sales in 1999. They had considered creating a prequel to ''Dark Crystal'' and sequels for ''Labyrinth'', but decided that \"it made the most sense to try and create something similar or in the spirit of those films and attribute it as a Jim Henson Company fantasy title.\"<ref name=weiland />\n\nAfter being shown a short film directed by McKean, [[Lisa Henson]] contacted Gaiman in 2001 about the project, asking if McKean would be interested in directing and if Gaiman was interested in coming up with the story for the film. Gaiman agreed to write for the film if McKean agreed to direct.<ref name=weiland /><ref>{{cite web |last= Flanagan |first= Mark |title= Neil Gaiman Interview (page 2) |publisher= About.com |date= September 9, 2005 |url= http://contemporarylit.about.com/od/authorinterviews/a/gaimanInterview_2.htm |access-date= 2009-06-08}}</ref>\n\nProduction for the film took seventeen months, with a budget of $4 million.<ref name=khouri /> Though limited by the $4 million budget, McKean viewed this as a good thing, saying \"It's very good to have a box to fight against, and to know where your limitations are, because it immediately implies a certain kind of thing... a certain kind of shape... a certain approach to things.\"<ref name=\"ignmckean\" />\n\n===Setting===\nAccording to McKean, the film's setting was originally in [[London]], but that had opted to film it in [[Brighton]] at producer Simon Moorhead's suggestion.
