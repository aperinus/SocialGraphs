The [[screenplay]] by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]] is based on his [[The Miracle Worker (play)|1959 play of the same title]], which originated as a 1957 broadcast of the [[television]] [[anthology series]] ''[[Playhouse 90]]''. Gibson's secondary source material was ''[[The Story of My Life (biography)|The Story of My Life]]'', the 1903 [[autobiography]] of Helen Keller.\n\nThe film went on to be an instant critical success and a moderate commercial success. The film was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for [[Arthur Penn]], and won two awards, [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Patty Duke]], the latter of whom, at age 16, became the youngest competitive Oscar winner at the time. ''The Miracle Worker'' also holds a 96% score from the movie critics site [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1013973-miracle_worker/|title = The Miracle Worker (1962) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=September 7, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nYoung Helen Keller ([[Patty Duke]]), [[blindness|blind]] and [[Hearing impairment|deaf]] since infancy due to a severe case of [[scarlet fever]], is frustrated by her inability to communicate and subject to frequent violent and uncontrollable outbursts. Unable to deal with her, her terrified and helpless parents contact the [[Perkins School for the Blind]] for assistance. In response, they send [[Anne Sullivan]] ([[Anne Bancroft]]), a former student, to the Keller home as a tutor. A battle of wills ensues as Anne breaks down Helen's walls of silence and darkness through persistence, love, and sheer stubbornness, starting by teaching Helen to make a connection between her hand signs and the objects in Helen's world for which they stand.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as [[Anne Sullivan]]\n* [[Patty Duke]] as [[Helen Keller]]\n* [[Victor Jory]] as Captain Arthur Keller\n* [[Inga Swenson]] as Kate Keller\n* [[Andrew Prine]] as James Keller\n* Kathleen Comegys as Aunt Ev\n* [[Beah Richards]] as Viney (uncredited)\n* Jack Hollander as Mr. Anagnos (uncredited)\n* Michael Darden as Percy (uncredited)\n* Dale Ellen Bethea as Martha (uncredited)\n* [[John Bliss]] as Admissions Officer (uncredited)\n* [[Judith Lowry]] as 1st Crone (uncredited)\n* [[William F.

However Arthur Penn (who had also directed the stage production) insisted on using Bancroft. As a result, the studio viewed the film as a risky prospect and granted Penn only a tight budget of $1,300,000 (of which $200,000 was spent in purchasing the rights to the play).<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Chaiken |editor-first=Michael |date=2008 |url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Arthur_Penn/kb3a9Mkjc38C?gbpv=1&pg=PA32&printsec=frontcover |title=Arthur Penn: Interviews |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |page=32 |isbn=9781604731057}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, despite the fact that [[Patty Duke]] had played Helen Keller in the play, she almost did not get the part. The reason was that at 15 she was too old to portray a seven-year-old girl. But after Bancroft had been cast as Anne, Duke was chosen to play Helen in the movie.\n\nFor the dining room battle scene, in which Anne tries to teach Helen proper table manners, both Bancroft and Duke wore padding beneath their costumes to prevent serious bruising during the intense physical skirmish. The nine-minute sequence required three cameras and took five days to film.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=19300&category=Articles \"The Miracle Worker\"]. Turner Classic Movies.</ref>\n\nThe film was shot at [[Big Sky Ranch]] in [[Simi Valley]], California, and [[Middletown, New Jersey]].\n\nIt was remade for television in 1979 with Patty Duke as Anne and [[Melissa Gilbert]] as Helen as well as in 2000 with [[Alison Elliott]] and [[Hallie Kate Eisenberg]] in the lead roles.\n\nThe film ranked 15 on ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers|AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers: America's Most Inspiring Movies]]''.\n\n==Reception==\nIn his review in ''The New York Times'', Bosley Crowther wrote <blockquote>The absolutely tremendous and unforgettable display of physically powerful acting that Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke put on in William Gibson's stage play ''The Miracle Worker'' is repeated by them in the film ... But because the physical encounters between the two ... seem to be more frequent and prolonged than they were in the play and are shown in close-ups, which dump the passion and violence right into your lap, the sheer rough-and-tumble of the drama becomes more dominant than it was on the stage ... The bruising encounters between the two ... are intensely significant of the drama and do excite strong emotional response. But the very intensity of them and the fact that it is hard to see the difference between the violent struggle to force the child to obey ... and the violent struggle to make her comprehend words makes for sameness in these encounters and eventually an exhausting monotony. This is the disadvantage of so much energy. However, Miss Bancroft's performance does bring to life and reveal a wondrous woman with great humor and compassion as well as athletic skill. And little Miss Duke, in those moments when she frantically pantomimes her bewilderment and desperate groping, is both gruesome and pitiable.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bosley |first=Crowther |date=May 24, 1962 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E6D91038E63ABC4C51DFB3668389679EDE |title=Screen: 'The Miracle Worker' Opens |work=The New York Times}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''TV Guide'' rates the film 4{{frac|1|2}} out of a possible five stars and calls it \"a harrowing, painfully honest, sometimes violent journey, astonishingly acted and rendered.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/miracle-worker/review/106332 |title=The Miracle Worker Reviews |work=TV Guide |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203200845/http://movies.tvguide.com/miracle-worker/review/106332 |archivedate=February 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Time Out London'' wrote <blockquote>It's a stunningly impressive piece of work ... deriving much of its power from the performances. Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft spark off each other with a violence and emotional honesty rarely seen in the cinema, lighting up each other's loneliness, vulnerability, and plain fear. What is in fact astonishing is the way that, while constructing a piece of very carefully directed and intelligently written melodrama, Penn manages to avoid sentimentality or even undue optimism about the value of Helen's education, and the way he achieves such a feeling of raw spontaneity in the acting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/73246/The_Miracle_Worker.html |title=The Miracle Worker |work=Time Out London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203100644/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/73246/The_Miracle_Worker.html |archivedate=February 3, 2009}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n{{main|List of accolades received by The Miracle Worker}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
