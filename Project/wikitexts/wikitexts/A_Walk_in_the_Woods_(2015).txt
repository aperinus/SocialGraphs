Based on the 1998 book of [[A Walk in the Woods (book)|the same name]] by [[Bill Bryson]], it was released on September 2, 2015, by [[Broad Green Pictures]].<ref name=\"variety.com\">{{Cite news |last=McNary |first=Dave |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/99-homes-a-walk-in-the-woods-release-date-broad-green-1201468864/ |title='99 Homes,' 'A Walk in the Woods' Set for September Releases |date=April 8, 2015 |work=variety.com |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAuthor Bill Bryson ([[Robert Redford]]), after living for ten years in the [[UK]], moved to [[New Hampshire]]. Now in his 60s, he had been living there peacefully. A television interview reports that he has published several popular books and there is speculation he will be writing more. Bryson, however, has no such plans.\n\nBryson and his wife Catherine ([[Emma Thompson]]) attend a funeral. Afterwards, he takes a stroll up to the nearby [[Appalachian Trail]], and suddenly decides he will hike its entire length. Catherine objects, presenting many accounts of accidents and murders on the trail. She relents on condition that he not travel alone. He agrees and searches for a friend willing to join him. Everyone declines his invitation; some declare him insane. Finally, he is contacted by Stephen Katz ([[Nick Nolte]]), an old friend who offers to be a hiking companion. Despite appearances, Stephen claims to be fit enough for the challenge. Bill's wife is unhappy with his choice, but relents.\n\nWithin less than a mile of their departure point, as groups of hikers overtake and pass them, they begin to grasp the difficulty of their ambition. Shortly after, a group of young children effortlessly runs by them up the trail, laughing and calling out to each other. Seeing others pass by so easily motivates them to carry on. And so they move on, day by day, making more or less pleasant acquaintances, having more or less pleasant experiences.  Some time later they reach a hut, having hiked miserably through pouring rain. Carved into the log wall is an Appalachian Trail map showing the trail and their present location. They realize they have finished less than half of the trail after spending three months on it. Eventually they trek into a restricted section posted \"for experienced hikers only\". While maneuvering their heavy and awkward backpacks alongside a precipitous drop, Bill trips and pulls Stephen with him down a steep, rocky cliff. They fall about fifteen feet onto a ledge spacious enough to be comfortable, but far enough below the trail to be unable to get back up to resume the hike. They spend the night there with no clear hope of rescue. Luckily, the next day they are awakened by early morning hikers who are able to get them off the ledge.\n\nEventually, they decide they have had enough and end their journey. When comfortably back at home, Bill, going through his mail, finds a series of post cards from Stephen that were mailed from their various stops along the trail. The last one reads:  \"What's next?' Bill sits down and begins typing on his computer, \"A WALK IN THE WOODS.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Redford]] as [[Bill Bryson]]\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Stephen Katz\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Catherine Bryson\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as Mary Ellen\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as REI Dave\n* [[Mary Steenburgen]] as Jeannie\n* [[Hayley Lovitt]] as Donna<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1178665/ |title=A Walk in the Woods (2015) |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\nThe project dates back to at least 2005, when Robert Redford first announced his plans to make the film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/news/394.html |title=Newman and Redford plan new project |date=2008-05-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112062844/http://www.timeout.com/film/news/394.html |archive-date=2006-01-12 |access-date=2008-03-07}}</ref> At various points directors such as [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070208_columbus_to_direct_newmanredfo.html |title=Columbus to direct Newman/Redford film |date=2008-02-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201020441/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070208_columbus_to_direct_newmanredfo.html |archive-date=2008-02-01 |access-date=2008-03-07}}</ref> [[Barry Levinson]]<ref name=\"EW\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i29ce7ca58f3334d03925a8c353efdcaf |title=Redford Doing Adaptation of 'Walk in the Woods' |date=2008-01-29 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=2008-03-07}}</ref> and [[Larry Charles]] were involved.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39262 |title=Now Larry Charles Will Guide A Walk In The Woods |last=James White |date=2015-10-09 |website=Empireonline.com |access-date=2016-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/afm-robert-redfords-a-walk-in-the-woods-attracts-director-larry-charles-1200786018/ |title=AFM: Robert Redford's 'A Walk in the Woods' Attracts Director Larry Charles |last=Dave McNary |date=2013-11-01 |website=Variety |access-date=2016-04-29}}</ref> However, [[Ken Kwapis]] ended up directing the picture.\n\nRedford initially wanted [[Paul Newman]] to costar in the film with him, to the point where Redford temporarily abandoned the project after Newman's death, unable to picture any other actor suitable for the role.
