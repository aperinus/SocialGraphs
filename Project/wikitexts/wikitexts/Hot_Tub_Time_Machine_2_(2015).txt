The film stars [[Rob Corddry]], [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]], [[Clark Duke]], [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Gillian Jacobs]]. It is the sequel to the 2010 film ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine]]''. The film was released on February 20, 2015. [[John Cusack]], who played Adam Yates and produced the first film, does not return in the theatrical cut, but has a brief cameo in the unrated version. The film grossed $13 million against a budget of $14\u201318 million, and was heavily panned by critics, who deemed it \"unfunny\" and \"unoriginal\".<ref name=\"Gettell\" />\n\n==Plot==\nFive years after the events of the first film, Lou Dorchen and Nick Webber have become [[Wealth|rich]] and [[Celebrity|famous]], with Lou becoming a billionaire and Nick being a successful musician/singer. At Lou's celebratory party, Lou is shot in the groin. Jacob (Lou's son) and Nick drag him to the hot tub time machine and activate it to travel back in time to find and stop the killer. When they awaken, they find themselves 10 years in the future, where Jacob is in charge of Lou's mansion. After determining that they are in an alternate timeline where Lou's killer is from this future, they go to their friend Adam Yates's home, only to meet his son Adam Yates Stedmeyer (Adam Jr.), who is engaged to a woman named Jill.\n\nLou suspects his nemesis Gary Winkle is the killer, but he learns Gary actually made his own fortune from some land that Lou could have purchased. They party at Gary's nightclub, where Adam Jr. takes [[hallucinogen]]s for the first time. The next day, they attend the popular television game show ''Choozy Doozy'', where contestant Nick is required to have [[virtual reality]] sex with a man. As Lou suggested the idea, he is obliged to participate, but uses his \"lifeline\" to switch with Adam Jr. Jacob becomes disillusioned with the misadventures and leaves the group to get [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] at Gary's club and to then commit [[suicide]] by jumping off an extremely high building. Lou makes amends with him and prevents his suicide.\n\nWhen the guys see a news report where Brad, an employee of Lougle, invents nitrotrinadium, the ingredient that activates the hot tub time machine, they suspect he is the killer. At Adam Jr.'s wedding, Jacob talks with Brad and realizes he is not the killer, but that he invented the chemical after being inspired by Lou's words. Jill, who is upset about Adam Jr.'s partying, has sex with Lou, but when Adam Jr. finds out, he steals the nitrotrinadium and goes back to the past. Jacob, Nick, and Lou return to the mansion, but are too late to stop Adam Jr. As the guys sit in defeat, Jacob realizes that because the chemical has appeared in the past, it now exists in the future. They return to the present and stop Adam Jr. from shooting Lou after Lou apologizes to him.\n\nFollowing this incident, Nick apologizes to Courtney as Lou tells his wife he wants to go to [[drug rehabilitation]] for his [[drug abuse]]. Adam Jr. meets Jill for the first time. The more optimistic Jacob approaches Sophie (his girlfriend in the future) and convinces her to join him in a relationship. As Lou, Nick, Jacob, and Adam Jr. return to the hot tub, Lou's head is shot off by Lou (or Adam Sr. in the unrated version) dressed in a [[minuteman]] costume. Patriot Lou informs them there are [[Multiverse|multiple Lous]] anyway, and invites them to \"make America happen.\" During the closing credits, the guys are seen exploiting the time machine to change history.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col begin}}\n<!-- Listed by closing credits -->\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Lou Dorchen\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as Nick Webber\n* [[Clark Duke]] as Jacob Dorchen\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Adam Yates Stedmeyer (Adam Jr.)\n<!-- \"And\" credit in closing credits, but star billing on poster -->\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Hot Tub Repairman\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Jill\n<!-- listed 2 at a time in closing credits -->\n* [[Collette Wolfe]] as Kelly Dorchen\n* Bianca Haase as Sophie\n<!-- listed 3 in closing credits -->\n* [[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason P.
