Their mission is to protect him on a dangerous journey into no-man's land to investigate some \"real estate\" for a company, although Voyteche claims that there is nothing out there.\n\nGoing most of the way by truck, they traverse the forest and hear distant fighting, artillery, jets fly overhead, and an intense burst of static knocks out their radios. Reaching their destination, the team discovers a seemingly abandoned bunker complex. Leaving Jordan and Tak above ground, the rest of the team explore the outpost. Jordan notices a flash of light coming from the trees: assuming it is sunlight flashing off a [[Telescopic sight|scope]], Tak fires. Another burst of static is heard, and McKay is hit in the arm by the only returning shot. Tak scouts the trees, finding no one and nothing: not even bullet casings. Locating the bunker\u2019s generator, D.C. and Hunt get to work restoring the power. Cotter and McKay discover a room filled with corpses and are horrified to find a catatonic survivor, G\u00f6tz. As the lights come on, Prior discovers a room with a projector screen and, behind it, the flag of the [[Nazi Party]].\n\nThe mercenaries interrogate G\u00f6tz to no avail, and assume that local paramilitaries used the bunker to hide evidence of ethnic cleansing. Jordan suggests that there might be a stockpile of hidden Nazi gold. D.C. orders a perimeter of landmines, assuming that hostiles may likewise be looking for the cache. Hunt goes through some documents and finds a back room containing a large generator-like device, secretly informing the company. McKay momentarily sees two jackbooted men standing next to G\u00f6tz before they vanish. Hunt, meanwhile, similarly spots a disappearing Nazi SS trooper behind him and is locked in the room, but assumes it is only a prank. He then vaguely explains the machine's purpose to D.C.: it is designed to manipulate [[Unified field theory|unified physics fields]] with \"limitless\" potential applications.\n\nMcKay's work on the bunker's radio initially produces scream-like static and then loud classical music, refusing to stop when unplugged until it spontaneously explodes. Outside that night, a mist appears, mysterious lights shine from the trees, and silhouettes of figures are seen who are unaffected by gunfire. A sudden, intense windstorm forces the mercenaries to take cover; afterwards, they find that Tak is missing and an [[Iron Cross]] placed where he was. Back in the bunker, Jordan shows D.C. the round he removed form McKay\u2014 a German rifle round not in use since the Second World War. The bullet is warped and deformed; the odds that it could have been fired from a rifle are slim. When a furious D.C. threatens Gotz with a pistol, his eyes move.\n\nHunt explains that the company wants him to find and recover the device, which was used by the SS for reality-shifting, invisibility, and reanimation experiments to make an army of unstoppable undead soldiers. He reveals that the company has leverage on them all: if the team tries to evacuate, hitmen will be dispatched to go after his and their families. Outside, Tak is brutally tortured and killed beyond the perimeter. Voyteche, caught alone, is also silently stabbed to death and found propped up with Tak's body the next morning. Despite the threat of Hunt\u2019s backers, D.C. orders an evacuation. Cotter goes to collect Hunt but is attacked by an SS trooper who impales him with a pickaxe and crushes his skull. When Hunt shows the surviving mercenaries the tape of the experiments, they realize Gotz is an SS ''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]'' responsible for the experiments. An enraged Prior promptly blows his brains out but with little effect; Gotz reanimates and kills McKay, leaving him outside. Left with no other option, DC, Prior, Jordan, and Hunt plan to restart the machine to neutralize the SS and trap them in the bunker.\n\nThat night the undead SS garrison, now led by G\u00f6tz, attacks in force. The mercenaries fight a delaying action to buy Hunt time to power up the machine. Prior is brought down before Hunt manages to set off a shockwave which disables the undead, However, the unstable machine is disabled and the attack resumes. Jordan is pulled down a side corridor and savagely killed. A wounded D.C. tries to buy time for Hunt to escape through the vents, only to be overrun as well. Hunt finds himself in the test chamber only to be cornered by G\u00f6tz and his men before being pulled down from behind.\n\nA second corporate team arrives 72 hours later to carry out the same assignment, only to find a \"breather\" among the piles of naked corpses. Outside, the clearing is illuminated again and Gotz gives the SS soldiers a nod to begin their assault on the team.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Julian Wadham]] as Hunt, \"Company\" agent\n*[[Ray Stevenson]] as DC, British [[Royal Marine]] Warrant Officer\n*[[Richard Brake]] as Prior, [[United States Marine Corps]]\n*Paul Blair as Jordan, [[French Foreign Legionnaire]]\n*[[Brett Fancy]] as Taktarov (\"Tak\"), [[Alpha Group|Russian Alpha Group]]\n*Enoch Frost as Cotter, Belgian Peacekeeper\n*Julian Rivett as Voyteche, Yugoslav military\n*[[Michael Smiley]] as McKay (\"Mac\"), British Army [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]]\n*[[Johnny Meres]] as [[Brigadef\u00fchrer]] G\u00f6tz, German SS (Schutzstaffel) Officer (\"The Breather\")\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was produced by Scottish couple Arabella Croft and Kieran Parker and their production company [[Black Camel Pictures]].
