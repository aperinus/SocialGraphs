The film stars [[Bill Murray]], Aykroyd, [[Sigourney Weaver]], Ramis, [[Rick Moranis]], [[Ernie Hudson]], and [[Annie Potts]]. It is the sequel to the 1984 film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and the second film in the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]]. Set five years after the events of the first film, the Ghostbusters have been sued and put out of business after the destruction caused during their battle with the [[deity]] [[Gozer]]. When a new paranormal threat emerges, the Ghostbusters reunite to combat it and save the world.\n\nAfter the success of ''Ghostbusters'', [[Columbia Pictures]] wanted a sequel but struggled to overcome objections from the cast and crew. As with the first film, Aykroyd and Ramis collaborated on the script, which went through many variations. The pair wanted to convey a message about the consequences of negative human emotions in large cities. They settled on the idea of negative feelings creating a mass of supernatural slime beneath New York City that empowers malevolent spirits. With a budget of $30\u201340 million, filming took place between November 1988 and March 1989 in New York City and Los Angeles. Production was rushed compared to the original film's 13-month shooting schedule; large sections of the film were scrapped after poorly received test screenings. New scenes were written and filmed during re-shoots between March and April 1989, only two months before its release.\n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was released on June 16, 1989 to generally negative reviews. Critics responded unfavorably to what they perceived as largely a copy of the original and a softening of its cynical, dark humor to be more family-friendly, although the performances of [[Peter MacNicol]] and Rick Moranis were repeatedly singled out for praise. As the sequel to the then-highest-grossing comedy film of all time, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was expected to dominate the box office. Instead, the film earned $215.4 million during its theatrical run compared with the original's $282.2 million, making it the [[1989 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest-grossing film of the year]]. Columbia Pictures deemed it a financial and critical failure, effectively dissuading Murray from participating in a third ''Ghostbusters'' film. Its soundtrack single, \"[[On Our Own (Bobby Brown song)|On Our Own]]\" by [[Bobby Brown]], was a success, spending 20 weeks on the United States music charts.\n\nThe film failed to replicate the cultural impact and following of ''Ghostbusters''. Although some critics retrospectively praised it, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is generally seen as a poor follow-up to ''Ghostbusters'' and responsible for stalling the franchise for decades. The film spawned a series of merchandise including [[List of Ghostbusters video games|video games]], board games, [[Ghostbusters (comics)|comic books]], music, toys, and [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted houses]]. Despite the relative failure of ''Ghostbusters II'', a second sequel was pursued through to the early 2010s. Following the 2016 series reboot, ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters: Answer the Call]]'', a sequel to ''Ghostbusters II'' titled ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'' was released in 2021.\n\n== Plot ==\nFive years after saving [[New York City]] from destruction by the shape-shifting god [[Gozer]],{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984).}} the Ghostbusters have been sued for the property damage incurred and barred from investigating the supernatural, forcing them out of business. Ray Stantz now owns an occult bookstore and works a side job alongside Winston Zeddemore as unpopular children's entertainers, Egon Spengler works in a laboratory experimenting with human emotions, and Peter Venkman hosts a television [[talk show]] about psychics.\n\nDana Barrett, Peter's ex-girlfriend, has an infant son named Oscar with her ex-husband and works at an art museum restoring artwork. She contacts the Ghostbusters after Oscar's [[baby transport|baby stroller]] rolls, seemingly independently, into a busy intersection. At the museum, a painting of Vigo the Carpathian, a 16th-century European tyrant and powerful [[Magic (supernatural)|magician]], comes to life and enslaves Dana's boss, Janosz Poha. Vigo orders Janosz to bring him a child to possess, allowing him to escape the confines of his painting and live again to conquer the world. Because of his infatuation with Dana, Janosz chooses Oscar.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ghostbusters excavate the intersection where Oscar's stroller stopped and discover a river of slime running through the abandoned [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] system. Ray obtains a sample but is attacked by the slime and accidentally breaks a pipe that falls onto a power line, causing a citywide blackout. The Ghostbusters are arrested and taken to court for the damage and for investigating the supernatural. Upon presentation as evidence, the slime sample responds physically to the judge's tirade against the Ghostbusters and then explodes, summoning the ghosts of the Scoleri brothers, whom he sentenced to death. The Ghostbusters capture the ghosts in exchange for a dismissal of the charges and the right to resume their business.\n\nOne night, the slime invades Dana's apartment, attacking her and Oscar. She seeks refuge with Peter, and they rekindle their relationship. The Ghostbusters discover the slime reacts to emotions and suspect it has amassed from the [[Negative affectivity|negative emotions]] of New Yorkers. Determining Vigo and the slime are connected, Egon, Ray, and Winston investigate the river of slime, but they are pulled in. They emerge at the museum and begin fighting each other until Egon realizes the slime's negative energy is influencing them.\n\nThe Ghostbusters tell the mayor of their discoveries but are dismissed; his assistant Jack Hardemeyer has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor's political interests. A spirit appearing as Janosz kidnaps Oscar, and Dana pursues them into the museum, which is then covered with impenetrable slime. On [[New Year's Eve]], the slime rises to the streets, causing widespread supernatural chaos. Discovering Hardemeyer's actions, the mayor fires him and has the Ghostbusters released.\n\nDetermining that a positive symbol will rally the citizens and weaken the slime, the Ghostbusters use slime charged with positive emotions to animate and pilot the [[Statue of Liberty]] through the streets filled with cheering citizens. At the museum, the slime barrier partially recedes due to the [[positive affectivity|positive emotions]] and the Ghostbusters use the Statue's torch to break through the ceiling, stopping Vigo from possessing Oscar, then rappel through the ceiling and neutralize Janosz with positive slime. Vigo takes on physical form, immobilizes Dana and the Ghostbusters, and recaptures Oscar. The gathered crowds outside begin singing a chorus of \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\", and their positivity weakens Vigo, sending him back to the painting and freeing the Ghostbusters. Vigo possesses Ray, but the Ghostbusters use their weapons to free him and defeat Vigo, his painting being replaced by their likenesses surrounding Oscar. Afterwards, the city lauds the Ghostbusters and the Statue of Liberty is returned to Liberty Island.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Ghostbusters characters}}\n[[File:Ghostbusters 1989 Cast.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Portrait photos of the stars of the film: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, Harold Ramis, and Rick Moranis|Stars of the film include (l\u2013r, top row) [[Bill Murray]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], (bottom row) [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Harold Ramis]], and [[Rick Moranis]]]]\n* [[Bill Murray]] as [[Peter Venkman]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as [[Ray Stantz|Raymond Stantz]]\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Dana Barrett]]\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as [[Egon Spengler]]\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as [[Louis Tully]]\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as [[Winston Zeddemore]]\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Janine Melnitz]]\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Janosz Poha\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Jack Hardemeyer\n* [[David Margulies]] as Mayor Lenny Clotch\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Judge Stephen Wexler\n* [[Janet Margolin]] as the Prosecutor\n* William T.

An older Caucasian male with shoulder-length white hair and a short white beard. The man is shown from his front-right profile, facing right and smiling away from the camera. |Then-[[Columbia Pictures]] executive [[David Puttnam]] was blamed for ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s lengthy production, though director [[Ivan Reitman]] said it was more the fault of the reluctant cast and crew.<ref name=\"RollingJul62016\" />]]\n\nAfter the success of ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', a sequel was considered inevitable even though the film had been developed as a stand-alone project.<ref name=\"Collider2013\" /><ref name=\"NYTDec88\" /> The development of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was arduous, and the behind-the-scenes conflicts were given as much coverage in the press as the film.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\" /> When [[David Puttnam]] became chairman of [[Columbia Pictures]] in June 1986, he was not interested in developing an expensive sequel, and favored smaller films such as the critically acclaimed war film ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987) and the comedy film ''[[Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989 film)|Bloodhounds of Broadway]]'' (1989) over big-budget [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]]. He also greenlit several foreign-language films by European directors because he preferred making films for the \"world market\".<ref name=\"NYTimesFeb89\" /> ''Ghostbusters'' was part of former Columbia executive [[Frank Price]]'s legacy, and Puttnam had no interest in furthering that legacy while building his own.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" />\n\nReitman later said the delay in development was not Puttnam's fault; he said that executives above Puttnam at Columbia's New York branch had attempted to work around him, but could not get the production moving even after sidelining him. According to Reitman, the delay occurred because the main actors did not want to make a sequel for nearly three years; by the time they decided to go ahead, Murray was committed to his starring role in the Christmas comedy film ''[[Scrooged]]'' (1988). When Murray was finally ready, the script was not.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\" /> As co-creators, Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis all had control over the franchise, and their unanimous approval was required to proceed.<ref name=\"RollingJul62016\" /><ref name=\"VultureControl\" />\n\nIn April 1987, Puttnam announced that ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' would go into production in November that year without having informed Reitman, who had not yet reviewed the unfinished script.<ref name=\"LATimesMay87\" /><ref name=\"LooperDunno\" /> Puttnam was removed from his job in September. This was in part because he had alienated Murray and his talent agent Michael Ovitz. Puttnam had publicly criticized Murray as \"an actor who makes millions of dollars from Hollywood without giving back to his art. He's a taker\".<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\" /><ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> He also attacked expensive talent agency packages that provided scripts, directors, and stars; Ovitz also represented Aykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman.<ref name=\"THRPuttnam\" />\n\nPuttnam was replaced as Columbia president by [[Dawn Steel]].<ref name=\"NYTimesJan1990\" /><ref name=\"NYTimesFeb89\" /> When she took the job, her corporate bosses made it clear that getting the sequel into production was a priority.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> Columbia had experienced a long series of box-office failures since ''Ghostbusters'', and ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was seen as the best way to reverse their fortunes.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> By November, filming was scheduled to begin in summer the following year. At the time, Murray reportedly wanted $10 million to star in the sequel and his co-stars demanded an equal amount.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribFilmingSched\" /><ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\" />\n\nThe main obstacle was the disputes between the principal cast and crew that had arisen since ''Ghostbusters''. Ramis later said \"there was a little air to clear\" before they could work together.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> In March 1988,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /> Ovitz arranged a private lunch for himself, Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Reitman, and Ovitz's colleague, CAA head of business affairs Ray Kurtzman, at Jimmy's, a celebrity restaurant in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. Concerns were raised such as whether the principals could still carry the sequel because Murray had been away from films for so long and Aykroyd had had a series of film failures. During the meeting, the group had fun and decided they could work together.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" />\n\nMonths of negotiations followed with Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis to negotiate a minimal salary in exchange for a percentage of the box office profits.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /><ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /> The deal was reported to be 10% of the box office profits each; Reitman denied that the figure was that large but said, \"it's a big one\".<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\" /><ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /> This was to keep the budget low, aiming for approximately $30 million, whereas upfront salaries would have raised it closer to $50 million.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> After this, the film was rushed into production, with shooting scheduled for mid-1988 in anticipation of a mid-1989 release.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /><ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\" /> Despite the five years it took to produce a sequel and its necessity for special effects, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' had a shorter schedule than its predecessor's one-year turnaround.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\" />{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} [[Michael C.

Early on, they decided ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' should reflect the five-year passage of time between the two films.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=57}} Ramis suggested the story focus on a baby because he had previously developed a horror film concept centered on an infant who possessed adult agility and focus. This inspired him to create the character Oscar.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} Initially, the child was the son of Peter Venkman and Dana, who would have maintained their relationship in the intervening years. The child would have become possessed as a focal point of the film; Murray felt this created an imbalance in the story, placing too much emphasis on his and Dana's relationship with the child rather than the Ghostbusters and their character dynamics.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|pp=57,58}} Instead, they chose to have Peter's and Dana's relationship fail, allowing her to marry, have a child and be divorced by the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Ramis wanted to show that the Ghostbusters had not remained heroes after their victory in the previous film; he felt that would have been a less original approach.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}}\n\nThe river of slime was conceived early in their collaboration.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} Ramis wanted the slime beneath New York to present a moral issue caused by the build-up of negative human emotions in large cities;{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}}{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}} he considered it a metaphor for [[urban decay]] and a call to deliver a human solution, though he said this was buried deeply in the script.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> The pair wanted negative emotions to have consequences and found humor in New York City having to be nice or face destruction, though at this point they did not know what form that destruction would take.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}} Ramis said: \"Comedically, it suggested, what if everyone in New York City had to be nice for forty-eight hours?\"<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> Aykroyd said they wanted to show negativity has to go somewhere, potentially into the person the emotion is directed towards. He felt this made the film more grounded compared with dealings with gods.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=60\u201361}} He said: \"Cities everywhere are dangerous. Life has become cheap. You can go to{{nbsp}}... see a movie and get machine-gunned on the street\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} The story evolved far from Ramis' and Aykroyd's efforts but retained the core notion of emotions and their impact.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} By May 1987, Aykroyd and Ramis had been working for over a year,<ref name=\"LATimesMay87\" /> and had completed the screenplay by March 1988.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\" />\n\nIn the years since the release of the more adult-oriented ''Ghostbusters'', its animated spin-off television series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' had become popular with its target child audience. The team was tasked with balancing the needs of ''Ghostbusters'' fans and those of the cartoon's audience.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /> According to Medjuck, the cartoon's success was influential in the return of [[Slimer]] for the sequel, and they aimed to avoid contradicting the cartoon where possible; he said although the Ghostbusters have been out of work for five years, they had to act as though the cartoon's events took place after the film.<ref name=\"BTMSep14\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:Max von Sydow Cannes 2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A profile image of Max von Sydow. An elderly Caucasian man with short white hair. He is facing forwards while looking off to the left, with a slight, open-mouthed smile. |[[Max von Sydow]] provided the voice of Vigo the Carpathian.]]\nAccording to early reports, Puttnam intended to replace the principal cast with lower-salaried actors, in part because of his disdain for Murray. Puttnam denied this in a 1987 interview and said recasting had never been an option.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /><ref name=\"LATimesMay87\" />\n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was to be the first sequel Reitman had directed, and he was worried about being able to surprise the audience without relying on elaborate special effects. He wanted to focus on character interaction, believing that was the original film's main draw.<ref name=\"NYTDec88\" /> Ramis was apprehensive about returning to the franchise because of the overwhelming success of ''Ghostbusters''.<ref name=\"NYTDec88\" /> Murray was also hesitant; he had left acting for four years following the release of the previous film. He described ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} success as a phenomenon that would forever be his biggest accomplishment and felt \"radioactive\" after the failure of his personal project ''[[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'' (1984). He chose to avoid making films until he returned for ''Scrooged''.<ref name=\"CSTEbert\" /><ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> Murray was also dismissive of sequels in general, believing they exist only for \"greed\" or \"business\" reasons, the latter of which he said should carry a death sentence. He said he returned for the sequel because \"working on the first ''Ghostbusters'' was the most fun any of us had\".<ref name=\"NYTDec88\" />\n\nThe character of Janosz Poha, portrayed by Peter MacNicol, was originally called Jason and serves as a [[straight man]] to the Ghostbusters.{{sfn|Bernard|1989|p=29}} MacNicol said the role could be played by anyone so he opted to give Poha a backstory in which he is [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Carpathian]]. He developed the accent from his Czech friend and from observations at a Romanian tourist agency.<ref name=\"PeopleJul89\" />{{sfn|Bernard|1989|p=31}} MacNicol wanted to wear a black [[The Beatles|Beatles]] wig but the idea was rejected because many of the cast had dark hair.{{sfn|Bernard|1989|p=32}} The character's accent was inspired by that of [[Meryl Streep]] in the film ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982). In the script, Poha is not described as having an accent but MacNicol impressed Reitman with it at his audition.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\" />\n\nMax von Sydow provided the voice of Vigo; he completed his recordings in a single day.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\" /> Von Homburg reportedly only learned his voice had been dubbed with von Sydow's while watching the premiere and stormed out shortly afterward.<ref name=\"Deadspinvonhomburg\" /> He later said his slurred voice, which was caused by a split lip, had been a hindrance in securing acting work.{{sfn|Salmon|2016|p=77}} [[Eugene Levy]] was cast as Louis' cousin Sherman, an employee at the psychiatric ward where the Ghostbusters are imprisoned.

Thousands of civilians attended the recording and were used in the film, shown running away from the arch.]]\nFollowing [[test screening]]s, the principal crew realized there were numerous issues with the film.{{sfn|McCabe|2016B|pp=74,75}}<ref name=\"LATimesEndingCut\" /> Reitman said that upon watching the test version he realized the final 25 minutes of the film \"just died a horrible death\", so he spent four days filming a new 25-minute ending to replace it.<ref name=\"LATimesEndingCut\" /> The test screenings identified that audiences liked the film but felt Vigo did not present a real challenge to the Ghostbusters and that their victory was too easy.{{sfn|McCabe|2016B|pp=74,75}} Test audiences also thought Vigo, the slime, and the associated ghosts were not sufficiently connected.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=25}} According to Gross, the audiences were not aware that the slime in the film could be charged by negative or positive emotions, so scenes were added to better explain this.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=23, 25}}\n\nExtensive re-shoots were conducted throughout March and April 1989, only two months before the film's release; these included on-location filming in New York.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=23}}<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /><ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' had been scheduled for release on the [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4th Independence Day holiday weekend]] but Reitman felt June 23 would work better. When they learned the superhero film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' was also being released that day, they asked to move to the 16th. According to Gross, \"Joe Medjuck and I were turning pale{{nbsp}}... it did not look possible{{nbsp}}... It was a real killer\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=25}}\n\nSeveral new scenes were added to increase the sense of urgency and threat to the Ghostbusters, including the underground ghost train sequence and the associated severed-heads scare. A scene showing the Ghostbusters' developed photographs of Vigo bursting into flames, threatening to immolate them, was also added. Reitman wanted these scenes added because he thought his previous cut of the film focused too much on the relationship between Murray's and Weaver's characters.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\" /> The ghost train scene was filmed at the [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]] night club in New York. It was added to create a sense of an unseen force trying to keep the Ghostbusters away.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=23}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} Medjuck noted that the added scenes did not require extensive special effects.{{sfn|McCabe|2016B|pp=74,75}} Cheech Marin's cameo as a dock supervisor was also added in this period.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" />\n\nThe additional content replaced some scenes and subplots that were far into completion and contained finished special effects.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /> Further shooting was done in [[Washington Square Park]], which was used for the monster moving under the [[Washington Square Arch]]. The popularity of the film was evident at that time when thousands of people arrived after hearing ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was being filmed there. They took part in filming, screaming on cue and running to escape the monster.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}} The film's final battle with Vigo was reshot, and the way that Vigo left the painting to confront the Ghostbusters changed completely.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\" /><ref name=\"AICNOverview\" />\n\nOne of the cut scenes included a subplot in which the Raymond Stantz character is possessed by Vigo following his inspection of the Vigo painting. Raymond erratically drives the [[Ectomobile]] until he is freed of Vigo's control by Winston. This explained Raymond's possession in the finale. Some of this footage was repurposed into a montage.<ref name=\"Collider2013\" />{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} There were also scenes of Louis Tully attempting to capture Slimer, which test audiences found intrusive, and Slimer was reduced to two appearances.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} Gross said they retained some Slimer scenes for children but that audiences generally had no reaction to the character, which was not what they had expected.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=22}} Because the sequence in which Tully's cousin frees the Ghostbusters from the psychiatric hospital was removed, a scene showing a paranormal eclipse from the Mayor's office was added to explain the Mayor securing their release. Other removed scenes showed Ray and Egon experimenting with the slime, which explained how they learned to manipulate it to control the Statue of Liberty. A ghost was also removed from the sequence in which the slime causes ghosts to rise across New York because Reitman felt it was not creepy enough.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Ghostbusters II (soundtrack)|l1=Ghostbusters II ''soundtrack''}}\n[[Ray Parker, Jr.]] helped develop an updated version of his hit song \"[[Ghostbusters (song)#Run-D.M.C. version|Ghostbusters]]\", which was co-written and performed by [[hip hop]] group [[Run-DMC]].<ref name=\"Collider2013\" /><ref name=\"RollingVinyl2\" /> Aiming to replicate the success of the original soundtrack, producer Peter Afterman wanted to hire Bobby Brown who had a recent succession of hit songs.<ref name=\"RollingStoneBobbyB\" /><ref name=\"RollingStoneBrown\" /> To secure Brown's involvement, Afterman offered Brown's music label, [[MCA Records]], the rights to the [[Ghostbusters II (soundtrack)|''Ghostbusters II'' soundtrack]]. Brown agreed in exchange for a role in the film. Filming had nearly concluded at that time, but Reitman wrote Brown a cameo as the mayor's doorman.<ref name=\"RollingStoneBrown\" /> The resulting song, \"[[On Our Own (Bobby Brown song)|On Our Own]]\", was written by [[L.A. Reid]], [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]], and [[Daryl Simmons]]. The music video features appearances by [[Iman (model)|Iman]], [[Jane Curtin]], [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Malcolm Forbes]], Rick Moranis, [[Donald Trump]], and [[Marky Ramone|Marky]] and [[Joey Ramone]].<ref name=\"RollingStoneBobbyB\" /><ref name=\"LATimesBobbyBrown2\" />\n\nBrown also worked alone to write and produce \"We're Back\".<ref name=\"RollingStoneBrown\" /> Other songs on the soundtrack include \"Flip City\" by [[Glenn Frey]], \"Spirit\" by Doug E. Fresh & The Get Fresh Crew, and \"Love is a Cannibal\" by [[Elton John]].<ref name=\"Stereogum\" /> The song \"Flesh 'n Blood\" by composer [[Danny Elfman]] and [[Oingo Boingo]] was written for the film but Elfman said he was disappointed that only four [[Bar (music)|musical bars]] of it were used. He thought the small usage was an excuse to be able to release it on the soundtrack and said if he had known he would have pulled the song.<ref name=\"NYTimesElfman\" /><ref name=\"LATimesElfman\" />\n\n[[Randy Edelman]] was responsible for the film's [[Ghostbusters II (soundtrack)#Ghostbusters II: Original Motion Picture Score|original score]].<ref name=\"Edelman\" /><ref name=\"Edelman2\" /> It was one of Edelman's first experiences working with a large scale orchestra. Although familiar with ''Ghostbusters'', he chose not to re-watch it for inspiration so the sequel would have a unique sound. Edelman believed the distinct personalities of the existing characters meant they rarely needed a musical accompaniment, and instead focused on scoring the supernatural and action setpieces to represent the menace and \"dark nature of the evil Carpathian\".<ref name=\"SoundtrackNetEdelman\" />\n\n== Special effects and design ==\n[[File:Dennis Muren.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A profile image of Dennis Muren. A middle-aged, balding Caucasian male with short-white hair on the sides of his head. He is wearing dark glasses and looking towards the camera with a smile.|[[Dennis Muren]] served as the visual effects supervisor on ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.]]\nAs with his work on ''Ghostbusters'', Reitman had little interest in the technical side of his film. For the sequel, he employed special effects studio [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), giving them a rough outline of the plot and the freedom to do as they wanted.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}}<ref name=\"TestedMay15\" /><ref name=\"NYTimesEffects\" /> Columbia had previously helped [[Richard Edlund]] found special effects company ''Boss Film Studios'' for ''Ghostbusters'', but Reitman was reported to be unhappy with their work. Edlund's former ILM co-worker [[Dennis Muren]] served as the visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /> Despite the film's intentionally rushed schedule, Muren wanted to work on the film because it would let him design new creatures.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}} Muren admitted that his designs would not be as original as ''Ghostbusters''{{'}}, and instead wanted to make them more flexible and \"ghostly\".<ref name=\"NYTimesEffects\" /> The team was originally hired to provide 110 effects shots but this grew to 180.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}}<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" />\n\nILM was also working on special effects for other 1989 releases; ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', and ''[[The Abyss]]'', but had the most difficulty with ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' because designs and concepts were constantly changing and new scenes were being added. ILM eventually refused to accept any further alterations.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /> As the schedule tightened, ILM had nine teams working every day for four weeks to complete the expanded 180 shots,{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=25}} and had to outsource some of the extra work to Visual Concept Engineering, Available Light, Character Shop, and the uncredited [[Tippett Studio]].<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /> Apogee Productions handled many of the effects for the reshoots.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" />{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}}\n\n=== Slime ===\n[[Methocel]], a vegetable-based gel, was used to create the slime.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> Food coloring was added; the colors included green (to match Slimer) and blue. Physical effects supervisor [[Chuck Gaspar]] mocked up differently colored batches and Reitman settled on pink.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" />{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} The film required approximately {{convert|100,000|USgal|l|sp=us|abbr=off}} of slime.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> Four cement mixers were kept on-site to mix fresh batches daily because it deteriorated quickly.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" />{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} [[Mica]] dust and mineral oil were added for the river of slime; the dust added depth to the river while the oil created varying shapes on its surface.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" />{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}}\n\nThe river of slime in the Van Horne Pneumatic Transit station was a miniature model with a plexiglass trough {{convert|1|foot|meter|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|10|feet|meters|abbr=on}} long. It operated in a [[Pump#Gravity pumps|gravity pump]] and was fed from a large tank {{convert|15|feet|meters|abbr=on}} above it. After reaching the end of the river, the slime fell into another tank, from which it was fed back to the upper tank. Air injectors and puppeteered [[Slosh dynamics|baffles]] were used to create bubbles and manipulate the slime to flow as though something was moving beneath the surface.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=9, 10}} Small slime tentacles were created using vinyl-covered sticks operated from below. The large tentacle was plastic and was filmed against a blue screen as it fell away from a stand-in's boot. The footage was then played in reverse so the tentacle would appear to be grabbing at Aykroyd.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} The Van Horne scene combined the miniature river, matte paintings of the station, and a practical set for stairs leading to a tunnel.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} The scene in which Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson fall into the river was considered one of the most difficult effects to achieve; the actors were filmed falling from the Van Horne set, which was composited with the miniature river. Hudson's character being dragged away by the slime's current was filmed against a blue screen so he would appear in the river; his motion in the river had to be animated by hand against the river's natural movements.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}}\n\n=== Creature effects ===\nThe returning Slimer ghost was re-developed to be more child-friendly like his popular ''The Real Ghostbusters'' incarnation. His face, which was controlled with wires and cables in ''Ghostbusters'', was now controlled by servo motors and had a pneumatic jaw. Bobby Porter was hired to wear the Slimer costume until the character was removed from the film entirely. A few weeks later, Slimer was reinserted but by this time, Porter was not available and was replaced by Robin Shelby.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=21}}\n\nThe Scoleri Brother ghosts, Tony and Nunzio, were inspired by a pair of brothers who robbed Ramis' father's store. Creature designer Tim Lawrence was influenced by the musical comedy film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), which starred Aykroyd and featured two brothers, one of whom was tall and thin (Tony) and the other short and fat (Nunzio). The brothers were given a cartoonish design to counter the film's scary moments. Lawrence aimed to represent the characters' evil rather than their pre-death appearances.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=14}} Camilla Henneman created most of Nunzio using spandex pouches filled with gelatinous materials to make him appear impossibly fat. The costume was worn by Lawrence. The impossibly thin Tony was designed as a life-size puppet but Muren thought this approach would impact the filming schedule. Tony was reworked as a costume that was worn by actor Jim Fye; it was given elongated appendages to appear unnaturally thin.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=14}}\n\nThe ghosts' faces were articulated with motors and pneumatics created by mechanical animator Al Coulter and his team. Lawrence also developed an animation system to allow the masks to lip-sync dialog. Alongside early concepts of the ghosts walking and creating explosive ruptures with each step, most of these features were abandoned in the final film. Lawrence later said without those features the same effect could have been created with a one-third-scale puppet.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=17}} The brothers' electric chairs were miniatures composited into footage of the seated, costumed actors.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=17}} Distortion effects such as the ghosts being squeezed were created using completed effect shots that were rephotographed through [[mylar]] material that could be warped to affect the underlying image.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=18}} For the scene in which Nunzio carries the prosecutor upside-down from the courtroom, a stuntwoman was hung upside down on a rail. Reitman wanted her to pass through the doorway while seeing above it. Gaspar's team created a passage made of foam above a door that resembled the iron grill. The foam was spring-loaded so that when the wire passed through, the set sprang back into place quickly; the effect was hidden behind a composite of Nunzio.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=13,14}} Full-scale cutouts of the ghosts were used during filming to aid the actors.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=13}} ''Ghostbusters'' storyboard artist Thom Enriquez storyboarded the scene; he found the process difficult because the limited schedule meant the courtroom was being built as he worked. He was also restricted by the budget, saying he \"could use only fourteen chairs. I could also blow up four pillars and one wall of glass\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=13}}\n\n[[File:116 NYC (Liberty Island).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The Statue of Liberty as seen from below. The green statue is a female figure wearing a toga and crowd, while holding a torch above in her right hand. There is a blue sky and white clouds behind it. |The [[Statue of Liberty]] was a prominent feature in the film's finale. [[Dan Aykroyd]] liked the idea of animating something otherwise immobile.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}}]]\nThe animated Statue of Liberty was conceived by Aykroyd, who liked the idea of taking a static image and making it move about, comparing it with seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] moving or [[Victoria Falls]] flowing in reverse.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} The statue's role was originally written as a weapon for Vigo but this idea did not progress the narrative.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=34}} The effect was a combination of a costume worn by Fye, miniatures, and larger-than-life-size elements like the statue's crown\u2014 which in reality was too small to let the Ghostbusters peer out. The crown was mounted on a [[gimbal]], allowing it to be pivoted as though its wearer was walking. Reitman ordered the crown be tilted down further than the actors were expecting to elicit from them a genuine reaction of surprise. The upper body was modeled and filmed at night in a makeshift pool to show it emerging from the ocean.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=37}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=41}} Fye also portrayed the ghost of a [[Central Park]] jogger.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=20}}\n\nTo portray the possessed Janosz illuminating a hallway with his eyes, MacNicol was filmed walking down a hallway, which was filmed again without lights and with Michael Chapman holding a light at the height of MacNicol's head, while panning it from side-to-side. Several takes were done to cover MacNicol's gaze. Animators added the beams emanating from Janosz, including particulate matter to enhance the realism.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} The \"ghost nanny\" version of Janosz that snatches Oscar from Venkman's apartment went through many variations. During development, it was conceived of as a two-headed dragon\u2014an idea that was dismissed as unoriginal\u2014billboard figures, animated gargoyles, a phantom taxi, and [[Santa Claus]].{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} A possessed item in the apartment was also considered; this idea inspired the possessed bathtub.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} MacNicol wore [[drag (clothing)|drag]] as the nanny for closeups and a puppet was used for wide shots. The ghost's extending arm was made from stretchable plastic tubing covered in fabric.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=26,27}}\n\nWelch built the exterior walls and ledge of Venkman's apartment to scale; it was positioned {{convert|10|feet|meters|abbr=on}} in the air. The ledge was superimposed over a matte painting of the full building. The infant actor was secured in a rig that helped him to stand up before his abduction.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} The possessed bathtub started as a bubble-bath monster that would appear to have thousands of eyes in each bubble; it is destroyed when Dana drops her hairdryer into the bath. Reitman preferred the slime to be the monster. A silicone bath that could be easily bent was used; from below, Tom Floutz puppeteered a tentacle made of dielectric gel and reinforced with spandex and china silk, which was covered in slime. A fiberglass maw was inserted in front of a vacuum tube that sucked the material backward when activated, revealing a mouth. An animated tongue was added later.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=23}}\n\nThe [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] was one of the first shots ILM completed; they wanted a powerful image for the scene and considered using the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'']] airship complete with flaming passengers and luggage, a subway train carrying rotting passengers, and a graveyard with exploding headstones. A miniature model of the ''Titanic'' with slightly modified aspects was used instead; the position of the ship's name was altered to make it clearly identifiable. Extras were filmed wearing period costume, seaweed, and dripping water but many of the minor details were lost in the wide shot.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=33}} A scale model of the museum was created because Reitman wanted to be able to show the slime oozing from cracks and seams.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=33}} Several last-minute effect shots were added due to the hectic schedule. The ghost train was intended to be a subway car but there was no time to find a suitable model and an antique train was used. The severed heads were sourced from multiple places; poorer quality heads were placed further away from the camera.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} The theater ghost took three weeks to build and required four puppeteers. The Washington Square monster was animated in [[stop motion]] by [[Phil Tippett]], who accepted the job on the condition that the effect was no longer than 160 frames, was built on an existing model, and could be done in one take. Tippett was seriously injured in a car accident during development but continued to work and finished his effect in time.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}} The slime-possessed fur coat was achieved using four coats with parts controlled with servo motors. ILM considered using live animals for the segment but abandoned the idea.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}}\n\n=== Vigo the Carpathian ===\n[[File:Ghostbusters II Vigo Painting.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An image of Wilhelm von Homburg in character as Vigo the Carpathian.

The character went through many designs, and this canvas painting was in actuality a photograph of von Homburg taken on a set that was blown up in size and treated to resemble an oil painting.]]\nThe concept for the physical form of the central villain Vigo went through many changes,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /> including a plan to transform him into a large monstrosity.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=44-45}} There was difficulty determining how Vigo would interact outside his painting.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} Vigo was intended to have heavier creature makeup, but after Von Homburg was cast, his distinctive look meant the extra makeup was largely unnecessary.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=44}}\n\nIn early 1989, ILM contacted Glen Eytchison to develop a painting that could come to life. Eytchison specialized in ''[[Tableau vivant|tableaux vivants]]'' - the use of static sets and stationary actors to create the illusion of a flat painting. Muren said that his team could have worked out a way to achieve the desired effect, but they did not have enough time and needed to enlist an expert. The aim was to depict what appeared to be a painting of Vigo that would come to life to shock the audience. ILM spent months producing concepts of the painting's look but Reitman rejected them for being too similar to \"[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan [the Barbarian]]]\".<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\" />{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=7}} Eytchison and his team researched the look of a 16th-century warlord and references the period's painters to match the contemporaneous art styles.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\" />\n\nEytchison's team painted a background and individual items including skies, skulls, and trees on acetate. This allowed Reitman to view combinations quickly; he chose his favored design in 15 minutes. Local painter Lou Police produced a painting from this concept; Reitman approved it but Eytchison realized a painting would not be realistic enough to allow them to switch between it and the actor. Eytchison's team decided to create a small set resembling the painting; it had structural elements, including styrofoam skulls, in which Von Homburg could stand. Von Homburg's  costume and the set were painted by the same team to ensure they had the same texture and blended together.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\" />\n\nOnce the set arrived at ILM, Von Homburg was positioned in it wearing full costume, makeup, and prosthetics. Lighting was used to eliminate shadows, creating a flat image. A photograph was then taken and enlarged to be used as the painting. Welch's department treated the photograph to make it closely resemble an oil painting.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\" />{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=7\u20139}} Scenes of Von Homburg on the set delivering his dialog and stepping out of the set as if leaving the painting were filmed; according to Eytchison, the actor struggled with the action and Reitman did not like the effect. The ending was changed completely, eliminating the living picture concept.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\" /> When Vigo interacts from the painting in the finished film, the image is replaced by Von Homburg's disembodied head floating over a miniature river-of-slime set built from foam by ILM.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} When leaving the painting, Vigo disappears and materializes into the scene.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\" /> Another concept had him \"peel\" from the canvas,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\" /> and another had the slime bring other paintings to life to aid him. A molded mask was created to represent his inner evil; it was worn by [[Harold Weed]] as the possessed version of Aykroyd's character.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=45}}\n\n=== Technology ===\n{{See also|Ectomobile|Proton pack}}\n''Ghostbusters''{{'}} hardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for much of the Ghostbusters' equipment and their vehicle, the Ectomobile; he designed new equipment for ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' in an uncredited role. Dane revised the designs of the [[proton pack]] weapons, the ghost trap, and the Ectomobile, which became the Ectomobile 1A. Dane designed new equipment including the giga-meter, the slime scooper, and the slime blower\u2014a large tank connected to a slime-spewing nozzle.

They said that ''Ghostbusters'' had succeeded by projecting childlike fantasies onto adult characters who snubbed authority and bonded in a clubhouse, but by taking a surreal comedic fantasy and adding humanity to the central characters, the sequel had become \"Four Ghostbusters and a Baby\", a reference to the 1987 comedy film ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=1D}}<ref name=\"ReviewKehr\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] called it a disappointment, saying he reviewed ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' in a public screening and heard only one laugh during the entire film.<ref name=\"InvestJul16\" />\n\nSeveral reviewers criticized the film for too closely emulating the structure and story elements of its predecessor.<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" />{{sfn|Schickel|1989|p=89}} [[Gene Siskel]] called it a poor copy that offered nothing new, as though they \"were filming the first draft of a script\".<ref name=\"RevSiskel\" /><ref name=\"InvestJul16\" /> [[Richard Schickel]] was critical of the glut of sequels in 1989 in his review.

He nevertheless criticized it for what he saw as a lack of tension and plot development.<ref name=\"RevWaPo\" /> [[Vincent Canby]] said the film was funnier and not as \"oppressively extravagant\" as ''Ghostbusters''; he believed the plot lacked depth but that the overall tone of the film was \"remarkably cheerful\".<ref name=\"RevCanby\" />\n\nSome reviewers found the film to be poorly paced, leaving scenes feeling overlong, and that its best moments felt both few and infrequent.<ref name=\"RevNYDaily\" /><ref name=\"WAPOThomson\" /> Others echoed this sentiment, saying that it lacked the energy of ''Ghostbusters'', and was too laid back.<ref name=\"RevChicagoReader\" /><ref name=\"RevSiskel\" /><ref name=\"InvestJul16\" /> Writing for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Rick Groen considered the film self-important and mediocre,{{sfn|Groen|1989|p=D9}} and criticized Reitman's direction for lacking visual imagination.{{sfn|Groen|1989|p=D9}} The film's special effects generally received praise.

Despite being predicted to outperform its rival films before its release it failed to do so.<ref name=\"LAtimesApr1990\" /><ref name=\"LATimesAug1989\" /> As a part of the most successful summer for film to that date, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was seen as a critical and commercial failure; it also failed to garner the same passionate response from critics and fans as its predecessor.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\" /><ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> While Columbia did not comment, industry experts believed the film was undone, at least partly, by the combination of ''Batman'' attracting teenage audiences and ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' taking family audiences.<ref name=\"LATimesAug1989\" /> Another issue was the quantity of films being released close together and unexpected successes that meant films were staying in theaters longer than anticipated. By only mid-July, one theater was alternating ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' and ''The Karate Kid III'' on the same screen because of their diminishing returns to play ''Batman'' and ''Lethal Weapon 2'' on other screens.<ref name=\"LATimesGlut\" />\n\nReitman blamed changes in what audiences wanted from films. He felt contemporaneous society was more negative and cynical, and noted the popularity of ''Batman'', which had a darker tone whereas ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is more positive, particularly its upbeat, optimistic ending that shows New Yorkers coming together to help defeat Vigo.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\" /><ref name=\"RollingJul62016\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\" /> Reitman also felt the novelty of ''Ghostbusters'' could not be repeated because big surprises like ghosts and epic finales were now expected.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\" /> In 2014, he said that \"it didn't all come together{{nbsp}}... we just sort of got off on the wrong foot story-wise on that film\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> Reviewers often noted that the film largely resembles its predecessor down to the story structure, a giant figure stomping through New York, and a mid-film montage set to a theme song.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\" /> Some noted that releasing a film set at Christmas in June may also have worked against it.<ref name=\"Collider2013\" /> It has been suggested the five-year gap between films worked against it, both losing the momentum generated by the original and setting expectations too high. This period also allowed a potential cultural saturation of the brand through the cartoon series and merchandise.<ref name=\"DOGJul16\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\" />\n\nReitman was disappointed with ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'s}} performance and said making the film had not been as much fun an experience as working on ''Ghostbusters''. He told Columbia he would not be part of a third film, and intended to break from comedies altogether.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\" /> In a 2008 interview, Murray said: \"We did a sequel and it was sort of rather unsatisfying for me, because the first one to me was{{nbsp}}... the real thing{{nbsp}}... They'd written a whole different movie than the one [initially discussed]. And the special-effects guys got it{{nbsp}}... There were a few great scenes in it, but it wasn't the same movie\".<ref name=\"SciFi2008\" /><ref name=\"LAtimes2008\" /> Moranis said: \"To have something as offbeat, unusual, and unpredictable [as] the first ''Ghostbusters'', it's next to impossible to create something better. [And] with sequels{{nbsp}}... they want better\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> Much as with the first film, Hudson was disappointed his role was relatively small. In ''Ghostbusters'', many of his major scenes had been given to Murray who was better-known, and Hudson felt the sequel continued to marginalize his character. He affirmed that despite this, he appreciated the role because of the positive way fans have reacted to it.<ref name=\"EWNov2014\" /><ref name=\"HudsonGuardian\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was released on [[VHS]] on November 22, 1989, only shortly after the end of its theatrical run. Since the early 1980s, home media was normally released at least six months after films launched in theaters, and in the case of blockbusters like ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' and ''Batman'', anywhere from nine to twelve months later. To take advantage of the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas season]], ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', ''Batman'', and ''When Harry Met Sally...'' were all released before the end of the year.

The record also contains the Parker, Jr. version of the song and was released to celebrate the 30th and 25th anniversaries of ''Ghostbusters'' and ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' respectively.<ref name=\"RollingVinyl2\" /> The same year, the soundtrack was first released in digital format.<ref name=\"AllMusic\" /> Edelman's score remained unreleased until 2021. Available on vinyl, compact disc, and digital formats, the release included 16 tracks from the film, some of which were re-recorded for the album, and an unused song made for the film.<ref name=\"SoundtrackNetEdelman\" />\n\n== Thematic analysis ==\n=== Positivity vs. negativity ===\nSeveral elements of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' deal with the consequences of actions. Instead of being lauded as heroes after defeating Gozer, the Ghostbusters are driven out of business because of the associated destruction they caused. The slime amasses beneath the city as a consequence of negative emotions projected by New Yorkers.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\" /> When writing the script, Aykroyd and Ramis wanted to show that negativity had a lasting impact on the person inflicting it or the one receiving it. Aykroyd noted that, at the time, he considered major cities to be places where danger was rife and life held little value.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=60\u201361}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Writing for ''[[Mashable]]'' in 2019, Pravit Chatterjee argues that this theme is more relevant in the contemporary age of social media and hate speech.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\" />\n\nSimilarly, positivity is presented as a uniquely powerful force. Their previous combined efforts defeated Gozer, a god of destruction, but the Ghostbusters are completely powerless against Vigo and the accumulated negativity fuelling him. It is only when the citizens gathered outside the museum unite to sing a chorus of \"Auld Lang Syne\" that their positivity overwhelms Vigo, allowing the Ghostbusters to defeat him.{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=213}}{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}}<ref name=\"MashableChatter\" /> In 2016, A. Bowdoin van Riper wrote that while destruction-heavy films set in New York made before the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attack]] had taken on darker, unintended meanings, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was now more relevant. Its ending, which can be seen as \"hokey\" or false, now seemed \"touchingly real\".{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=213}} Murray described it as a \"story about innocence restored, and good values, and the power of faith in ordinary people\".{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=99}} Unlike ''Ghostbusters'', ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' lauds the values of community and family over their Ghostbusters' personal successes.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}} Indeed, the Ghostbusters' involvement in the sequel comes from the threat to their personal acquaintance Dana Barrett and her son. They are drawn out of retirement and break the rules of their legal settlement with the city to help, despite the lack of financial rewards and the personal risk to themselves.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=102}}\n\n=== Fatherhood ===\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is among many films released during the 1980s and 1990s that dealt with issues of fatherhood; these included ''Three Men and a Baby'' (1987), ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' (1989), ''Uncle Buck'' (1989), ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990), ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'' (1989), ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993). These film types appeared among their respective release years' highest-grossing films, and focus on redeeming or celebrating the concept of fatherhood in different forms from warm and friendly to authoritarian.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=102}} These father figures are initially unprepared for their responsibility. Nicole Matthews argues that the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=110}} These films each share a similar concept, that female characters are either absent or not important to the overall story.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=105}}\n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s driving plot is ostensibly about a mother (Dana Barrett) trying to protect her son who is the target of a malevolent force. Instead, it becomes about Peter Venkman and his relationship to the child, both representing a surrogate paternal figure and lamenting that he is not the child's biological father. The film focuses on moments of paternal tenderness such as Venkman using his treasured football shirt to clothe Oscar.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=107}} This focus is evident during the film's finale where Vigo's portrait is replaced by an image of the Ghostbusters as four paternal figures surrounding Oscar, with no female present. Instead a sword is depicted penetrating a stone; a symbol of fertility.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=107}}{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nJim Whalley wrote that when Dana describes Venkman as \"the most charming, kindest and most unusual\" man she has met, \"kind\" would not be an applicable description of his character in ''Ghostbusters'', evidencing his growth and maturity in the intervening years. Venkman's inability to commit to Dana ended their original relationship, but he is shown to have changed and now be willing to serve as a partner and father.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}} Similarly, Murray's comedic talents are seemingly ineffective throughout the film, unable to charm his way out of difficult situations as in ''Ghostbusters'' and further the narrative. He instead serves as comic relief, and it is the Ghostbusters' noble heroism that progresses the story.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=102}}\n\n=== Politics ===\nAs with the previous film, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' criticizes political institutions. The team actively questions authority in a deteriorating city filled with unhappy people.

It said the plot of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is arguably better executed than that of the first film, with multiple threads coming together in a \"seamless\" third act with a positive ending that works better with modern audiences.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\" /> [[Den of Geek]] compared it to sequels to other genre-specific classics like ''Back to the Future Part II'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), which were considered not as good as the original but as good films in their own right, while ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is perceived as being a bad film despite a close similarity to the original.<ref name=\"DOGJul16\" /> ''[[Deadspin]]'' said that like those aforementioned films, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s darker setpieces and comedy made it more suited for adults than children, but that it is better than most people remember.<ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\" /> [[Uproxx]] called it the ideal film to watch during the [[New Year]] period because it offers an unsubtle, simple morality tale about treating others well.<ref name=\"LegacyUproxx\" />\n\nContemporary review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] offers a {{RT data|score}} approval rating from {{RT data|count}} critics, with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}. The site's consensus reads: \"Thanks to the cast, ''Ghostbusters 2'' is reasonably amusing, but it lacks the charm, wit, and energy of its predecessor\".<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" /> The film has a score of 56 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 14 critical reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> In 2009, Den of Geek listed it as the eighteenth best blockbuster sequel of all time.<ref name=\"DOG2009Best\" />\n\n=== Merchandise ===\n{{See also|List of Ghostbusters video games#Ghostbusters II video game|l1=Ghostbusters video games}}\nFilm merchandising was a relatively new concept created mainly by the success of the ''Star Wars'' series. Merchandising for ''Ghostbusters'' was unsuccessful; toys in particular sold poorly until the release of the cartoon spin-off ''The Real Ghostbusters''. Sequels were seen as a brighter prospect because they are based on established characters. Over 24 tie-in toys were released alongside the film including water guns, colored slimes,<ref name=\"NYTimesJun89\" /> [[coloring book]]s, comics, and children's meals.<ref name=\"Collider2013\" /> ''Ghostbusters'' action figures were the fifth-most in-demand toy for the 1989 Christmas season according to a survey of 15,000 retailers.<ref name=\"LATimesToys\" /> Approximately 2.8 million units of a promotional [[noisemaker]] toy called the \"Ghostblaster\", which was released across 3,100 outlets of the fast-food restaurant [[Hardee's]], were recalled in June 1989 because of reports children were ingesting its small batteries.<ref name=\"UPIHardees\" /><ref name=\"CSPCHardees\" /> [[Now Comics]] released a three-part comic book miniseries adaptation of the film set in ''The Real Ghostbusters'' cartoon universe. The story included subplots from the film including Ray's possession while driving the Ectomobile and Tully trying to capture Slimer.{{sfn|ComicBookIssue1|1989|pp=1,2}}{{sfn|ComicBookIssue2|1989|pp=1,2,21\u201324, 27}}{{sfn|ComicBookIssue3|1989|pp=1,2}}\n\nSeveral video games were released around the release of the film; ''[[Ghostbusters II (computer video game)|Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II]]'' in 1989 for personal computers, ''[[Ghostbusters II (NES video game)|Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II]]'' (published by [[Activision]]) in 1990 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), and ''[[New Ghostbusters II]]'' (as ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''), also in 1990 for the Nintendo [[Game Boy]]. ''New Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was also released for the NES in Europe and Japan but could not be released in America because Activision held the rights to the game there.<ref name=\"ViceVideoGames\" /><ref name=\"EngagetNes\" />\n\nSince its release, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' merchandise has included [[Playmobil]] sets with action figures and a model of the Ectomobile 1A.<ref name=\"MerchPlaymobil\" /> A [[board game]], ''Ghostbusters: The Board Game II'', was released in 2017 by [[Cryptozoic Entertainment]]. Based on the film, it casts the players as the Ghostbusters and tasks them with defeating Vigo and his ghostly minions. The game's creation was [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]], raising over $760,000.<ref name=\"BoardGame1\" /><ref name=\"BoardGame2\" /><ref name=\"BoardGame3\" /> The 2019 [[Halloween Horror Nights]] event at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[Universal Studios Florida]] held a 'Ghostbusters-themed haunted maze that featured locations, characters, and ghosts from ''Ghostbusters'', and the Scoleri Brothers.<ref name=\"MazeIGN\" />\n\n== Sequels and spin-offs ==\n{{See also|Ghostbusters (franchise)|Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters: Afterlife}}\n[[File:Men Women and Children 45 (15273754892).jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A profile image of Jason Reitman.

The concept failed to progress for many years, reportedly primarily because of Murray's reluctance to participate.<ref name=\"VultureAug14\" /><ref name=\"LAtimes2008\" /> ''The Real Ghostbusters'' series continued to air until 1991 and ended after seven seasons; according to Medjuck, the cartoon series technically took place after the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.<ref name=\"BTMSep14\" /><ref name=\"Collider2013\" /> ''The Real Ghostbusters'' was followed in 1997 by a sequel series called ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'', which aimed to reinvigorate the franchise but lasted for only one season.<ref name=\"Collider2013\" /> In the years that followed the release of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', Aykroyd continued attempts to develop a film sequel throughout the 1990s to the early 2010s. By 1999, he had completed a 122-page concept for a sequel called ''Ghostbusters III: Hellbent'', which would add several new characters and take them to ManHellton, a demonic version of Manhattan, where they would encounter the demon [[Lucifer]].<ref name=\"VultureAug14\" />\n\nIn 2009, ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' featuring story consulting by Ramis and Aykroyd, and the likenesses and voice acting of Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, and Atherton, was released. Set two years after ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', the story follows the Ghostbusters training a new recruit (the player) to combat a ghostly threat related to Gozer. The game was well-received, earning award nominations for its storytelling. Aykroyd said the game is \"essentially the third movie\".<ref name=\"DOGJun14\" /><ref name=\"VultureAug14\" /> The game establishes that following the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' the still-possessed portrait of Vigo became a decoration at the Ghostbusters' firehouse.<ref name=\"DOGJul16Game\" /> ''Ghostbusters: The Return'' (2004) was the first in a planned series of sequel novels before the publisher, [[Byron Preiss|iBooks]], went out of business.<ref name=\"THRApr16\" /> Several [[Ghostbusters (comics)|''Ghostbusters'' comic books]] have also continued the original characters' adventures across the globe and in other dimensions.<ref name=\"THRApr16\" /><ref name=\"THRJan2019\" />\n\nFollowing Ramis's death in 2014, Reitman chose to no longer consider directing a potential third Ghostbusters film.<ref name=\"EWOCt14\" /><ref name=\"THRFeb14\" /> He decided the creative control shared by himself, Ramis, Aykroyd, and Murray was holding the franchise back and negotiated a deal with the studio to sell the rights; he spent two weeks persuading Murray. Reitman refused to release details about the deal but said that \"the creators would be enriched for the rest of our lives, and for the rest of our children\u2019s lives\". He and Aykroyd set up a production company called [[Ghost Corps]] to continue and expand the franchise, starting with the 2016 female-led reboot, ''Ghostbusters'', which was directed by [[Paul Feig]]<ref name=\"VultureControl\" /> and starred [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], and [[Kate McKinnon]] as the Ghostbusters.<ref name=\"EWOCt14\" /><ref name=\"BBCJan15\" /> Before its release, the film was beset by controversies and on release it attracted mixed reviews and was considered a [[box office bomb]].<ref name=\"MSNBCMar16\" /><ref name=\"PolygonJul16\" /><ref name=\"FortuneJul16\" /><ref name=\"EsquireJun17\" /> ''Ghostbusters: Afterlife'', a sequel to the original two films, was directed by Reitman's son [[Jason Reitman|Jason]]. Written by him and [[Gil Kenan]], the film was released in November 2021.<ref name=\"VarietySept1\" /> Several members of the original cast appear in the film alongside new cast members [[Mckenna
