The film stars [[Marlon Brando]], [[Maria Schneider (actor)|Maria Schneider]] and [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]], and portrays a recently widowed American who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young Parisian woman.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[New York Film Festival]] on October 14, 1972, and grossed $36 million in its U.S. theatrical release,<ref name=mojo>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2287961601/|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=Last Tango in Paris|access-date=31 May 2020}}</ref> making it [[1973 in film#Highest-grossing films|the seventh highest-grossing film of 1973]]. The film's raw portrayal of sexual violence and emotional turmoil led to international controversy and drew various levels of government censorship in different jurisdictions. Upon release in the United States, the [[MPAA]] gave the film an [[X rating]]. United Artists Classics released an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] cut in 1981. In 1997, after the film became part of the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] library, the film was reclassified as [[NC-17]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPaul, a middle-aged American hotel owner mourning the suicide of his wife Rosa, meets a young, engaged Parisian woman named Jeanne at an apartment that both are interested in renting. Paul takes the apartment after they begin an anonymous [[sexual relationship]] there. He insists that they not share any personal information, even given names, much to Jeanne's dismay. At one point in their relationship, he rapes her. Despite this, she tells him that she tries to leave him, but can't bring herself to do it. The affair continues for some time until Paul decides to leave Jeanne, after which she arrives at the apartment and finds that he has packed up and left without warning.\n\nPaul later meets Jeanne on the street and says he wants to renew the relationship. He tells her of the recent tragedy of his wife. As he tells his life story, they walk into a [[tango (music)|tango]] bar, where he continues telling her about himself. The loss of anonymity disillusions Jeanne about their relationship. She tells Paul she does not want to see him again. Paul, not wanting to let Jeanne go, chases her through the streets of Paris. While running, she continually yells at him to go away and tells him that their relationship is over.  Despite her threats to call the police, he chases her all the way back to her building and forces his way into her apartment. He mocks her for running away from him, followed by him saying he loves her and wants to know her name.\n\nJeanne takes a gun from a drawer. She tells Paul her name and shoots him. Paul staggers out onto the balcony, mortally wounded, and collapses. As Paul dies, Jeanne, dazed, mutters to herself that he was just a stranger who tried to rape her and she did not know who he was, as if in a rehearsal preparing herself for questioning by the police.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Paul, an American expatriate and hotel owner\n* [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] as Jeanne, a young Parisian woman\n* [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as Thomas, a film director and Jeanne's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Maria Michi]] as Rosa's mother\n* [[Massimo Girotti]] as Marcel, Rosa's former lover\n* [[Giovanna Galletti]] as the prostitute, an old acquaintance of Rosa\n* [[Catherine All\u00e9gret]] as Catherine, a maid at Paul and Rosa's hotel\n* Gitt Magrini as Jeanne's mother\n* Luce Marquand as Olympia, Jeanne's former childhood nurse\n* Dan Diament as the TV sound engineer\n* Catherine Sola as the script girl\n* Mauro Marchetti as the TV cameraman\n* Peter Schommer as the TV assistant cameraman\n* [[Catherine Breillat]] as Mouchette, a dressmaker\n* Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Breillat as Monique, a dressmaker\n* [[Darling L\u00e9gitimus]] as the Concierge\n* [[Veronica Laz\u0103r]] as Rosa, Paul's deceased wife\n* Armand Abplanalp as the prostitute's client\n* Rachel Kesterber as Christine\n* Ram\u00f3n Mendiz\u00e1bal as the Tango orchestra leader\n* Mimi Pinson as the President of Tango jury\n* G\u00e9rard Lepennec as the tall furniture mover\n* St\u00e9phane Koziak as the short furniture mover\n* Michel Delahaye (''scenes deleted'') as the Bible salesman\n* [[Laura Betti]] (''scenes deleted'') as Miss Blandish\n* [[Jean-Luc Bideau]] (''scenes deleted'') as the Barge Captain{{sfn|Arcalli|Bertolucci|1972|pp=21\u201322}}\n* Gianni Pulone (''scenes deleted'')\n* Franca Sciutto (''scenes deleted'')\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Bir-Hakeim-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Pont de Bir-Hakeim]] in Paris, where numerous scenes were shot]]\n[[Bernardo Bertolucci]] developed the film from his sexual fantasies: \"He once dreamed of seeing a beautiful nameless woman on the street and having sex with her without ever knowing who she was\".<ref name=\"Taylor\">{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Sophie |date=4 February 2011 |title=Last Tango in Paris star Maria Schneider dies at 58 |url=https://www.theweek.co.uk/entertainment/8061/last-tango-paris-star-maria-schneider-dies-58 |newspaper=[[The Week]] |access-date=5 January 2014}}</ref> The screenplay was by Bertolucci, [[Franco Arcalli]], and [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] (additional dialogue).

The final judgment of the Court of Appeal (Cassazione) delivered on 29 January 1976 ordered that the film be seized by the censorship commission and that all copies be destroyed. Scriptwriter Franco Arcalli, producer Alberto Grimaldi, director Bernardo Bertolucci, and Marlon Brando were each given suspended sentences of two months imprisonment.\n\n=== Rape scene ===\nThe film contains a scene in which Paul [[anal rape|anally rapes]] Jeanne using butter as a lubricant. While the rape is [[Simulation|simulated]], Schneider has said the scene still had a tremendously negative effect on her. In a 2006 interview, Schneider said that the scene was not in the script and that \"when they told me, I had a burst of anger. Woo! I threw everything.

Marlon said to me: 'Maria, don't worry, it's just a movie', but during the scene, even though what Marlon was doing wasn't real, I was crying real tears. I felt humiliated and to be honest, I felt a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci. After the scene, Marlon didn't console me or apologize.

The hues used in the film were inspired by the paintings of Bacon.{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=233}} During pre-production, Bertolucci frequently visited an exhibit of Bacon's paintings at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris; he said that the light and colour in Bacon's paintings reminded him of Paris in the winter, when\n\n<blockquote>the lights of the stores are on, and there is a very beautiful contrast between the leaden gray of the wintry sky and the warmth of the show windows...the light in the paintings was the major source of inspiration for the style we were looking for.{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=126}}</blockquote>\n\nBacon's painting style often depicted human skin like raw meat and the painter's inspiration included meat hanging in a butcher shops window and human skin diseases.{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=126}}\n\nCinematographer Vittorio Storaro had previously worked with Bertolucci on ''[[The Conformist (film)|The Conformist]]'' and often used an azure hue in the film. Storaro later told a reporter that\n\n<blockquote>after ''The Conformist'' I had a moment of crisis; I was asking myself: what can come after azure?...I did not have the slightest idea that an orange film could be born. We needed another kind of emotion...It was the case of ''Last Tango''.{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=126}}</blockquote>\n\nFor ''Last Tango in Paris'', Bertolucci and Storaro took inspiration from Bacon's paintings by using \"rich oranges, light and cool grays, icy whites, and occasional reds combine[d] with Bertolucci's own tasteful choices of soft browns, blond browns, and delicate whites with bluish and pink shadings\".{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=127}}\n\nBertolucci took Marlon Brando to the Bacon exhibit and told Brando that he \"wanted him to compare himself with Bacon's human figures because I felt that, like them, Marlon's face and body were characterized by a strange and infernal plasticity. I wanted Paul to be like the figures that obsessively return in Bacon: faces eaten by something coming from the inside.\"{{sfn|Tonetti|1995|p=126}}\n\n=== Brando's lines ===\nAs was his practice in previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many of the scenes. Instead, he wrote his lines on [[cue cards]] and posted them around the set, leaving Bertolucci with the problem of keeping them out of the picture frame. During his long monologue over the body of his wife, for example, Brando's dramatic lifting of his eyes upward is not spontaneous dramatic acting but a search for his next cue card.<ref name=\"SelfPortrait\">{{cite magazine |url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903717,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429021823/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903717,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 April 2007 |title=Self-Portrait of an Angel and Monster |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]  |location=New York City |date=22 January 1973 |access-date=29 July 2018|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Brando asked Bertolucci if he could \"write lines on Maria's rear end\", which the director rejected.<ref name=\"The Hottest Movie\"/>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Last Tango in Paris\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Gato Barbieri]]\n<!-- Commented out: | cover      = Last Tango in Paris (soundtrack).jpg -->\n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = 1973\n| recorded   = 20\u201325 November 1972 <br><small>Rome Italy</small>\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[United Artists Records|United Artists]]<br><small>UA-LA-045-F</small>\n| producer   = [[Alberto Grimaldi]]\n| chronology = [[Gato Barbieri]]\n| prev_title = [[Under Fire (album)|Under Fire]]\n| prev_year  = 1971\n| next_title = [[Bolivia (Gato Barbieri album)|Bolivia]]\n| next_year  = 1973\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n}}\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Gato Barbieri]], arranged and conducted by [[Oliver Nelson]], and the [[soundtrack album]] was released on the [[United Artists Records|United Artists]] label.<ref name=\"UA discography\">Edwards, D., Eyries, P., Watts, R., Neely, T. & Callahan, M., [http://www.bsnpubs.com/ua/uaconsolidated.pdf Discography Preview for the United Artists label \"LA\" Consolidated Series (1972-1981)] accessed 8 February 2016</ref><ref>Payne, D., [http://dougpayne.com/on67-75.htm#LAST%20TANGO%20IN%20PARIS Oliver Nelson discography] accessed 8 February 2016</ref> [[AllMusic]]'s [[Richie Unterberger]] noted \"Although some of the smoky sax solos get a little uncomfortably close to 1970s fusion clich\u00e9, Gato Barbieri's score to Bertolucci's 1972 classic is an overall triumph.
