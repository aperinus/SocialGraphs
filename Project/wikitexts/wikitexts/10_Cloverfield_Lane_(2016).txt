J. Abrams]] and Lindsey Weber<!-- Do not remove the producers, please. They are also important. --> and written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken, and [[Damien Chazelle]]. The second film in the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' franchise]], it stars [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[John Goodman]], and [[John Gallagher Jr.]] The story follows a young woman who, after a car crash, wakes up in an underground bunker with two men who insist that an event has left the surface of Earth uninhabitable.\n\nThe film was developed from a script titled ''The Cellar''; but under production by [[Bad Robot Productions|Bad Robot]], it was turned into a [[spiritual successor]] to the 2008 film ''[[Cloverfield]]''. It is presented in a [[third-person narrative]], in contrast to its predecessor's [[Found footage (film technique)|found-footage]] style. [[Principal photography]] took place under the title ''Valencia'' in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], from October 20 to December 15, 2014.\n\n''10 Cloverfield Lane'' premiered in [[New York City]] on March 8, 2016, and was released in select countries on March 10. It was released in the United States on March 11, 2016, in both conventional and [[IMAX]] formats. The film grossed over $110 million worldwide. A successor, ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'', was released on February 4, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400\u2013700 words.

While she is driving through rural Louisiana at night, Ben calls, begging her to return. The news reports of blackouts in several major cities. Her car is suddenly struck and flips off the road.\n\nAwakening in a concrete room, Michelle finds she has an injured leg and is chained to the wall. A man named Howard enters and unchains her. She later unsuccessfully ambushes him, and he explains that there has been a massive attack, perhaps by Russians or [[Martians]], and he had found her wreck and saved her life by bringing her to his underground bunker. He tells a doubtful Michelle that they cannot leave for one or two years because the air is poisoned and everyone outside is dead.\n\nHoward takes Michelle on a tour of the well-stocked bunker he built, which houses a third resident, Emmett, whose left arm is in a sling. Through a viewport, Howard shows her his two decayed pigs outside as evidence of the fallout, but she also sees Howard's truck, and regains the memory of it forcing her off the road. She privately relays this to Emmett, who dismisses it. He says he came to the bunker voluntarily, which he had helped Howard build, after actually seeing the attack happen and injuring his arm while fighting his way inside.\n\nDuring their first dinner together, Howard shows little tolerance for Emmett and flashes of jealousy and rage. Michelle antagonizes him and steals his keys, but just before she opens the outer door a woman covered with lesions appears, screaming to be let inside. Horrified, Michelle retreats back. Howard confesses he accidentally struck Michelle's car while in a panic to get to the bunker. She uses her fashion design skills to stitch the cut she caused on his forehead, and Howard opens up about his daughter.\n\nThe trio begins to adapt to life underground. The air ventilation system fails after something loud passes overhead, and Howard sends Michelle through a small duct to turn it back on. In the mechanical room, she finds a padlocked skylight with \"HELP\" scratched on the inside and an earring she had seen in a picture Howard showed her of his daughter. She shares this with Emmett, who recognizes the girl in the picture as a local girl who had gone missing two years earlier. They decide to seek help and Michelle begins to fashion a makeshift hazmat suit so one of them can go outside.\n\nHoward finds some of the hidden tools Michelle and Emmett are using for their plan and threatens to immerse them both in [[perchloric acid]]. Emmett takes responsibility, claiming he was building a weapon to use to get Howard's gun and impress Michelle. Howard accepts Emmett's apology before shooting him in the head, telling a shocked Michelle that now they can be a family of two. While Howard cleans up, Michelle works to finish the suit. He discovers the suit, but she flees and is able to upend the barrel of acid onto him, which disfigures him and starts a fire. She dons the suit and narrowly escapes outside. When she sees birds overhead, she removes her gas mask, but then observes an alien biomechanical craft floating in the distance. When the bunker explodes, the craft turns in her direction and drops off a quadrupedal creature. Michelle shelters in Howard's truck from the creature and from a flammable green gas the craft emits. The craft's tentacles draw the truck toward its maw, but Michelle finds materials for a [[Molotov cocktail]] and destroys it.\n\nMichelle drives off. A radio broadcast says there has been some success in the fight against the invaders and instructs survivors to seek safety in Baton Rouge, but also requests the help of anyone with medical or combat training in Houston. Michelle heads for Houston while a larger alien craft is revealed by lightning.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Michelle<ref name=\"empire\">{{cite web|url=https://empireonline.com/movies/features/jj-abrams-talks-10-cloverfield-lane-secrets/|title=Exclusive: J.J.
