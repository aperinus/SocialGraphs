The film was released [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] on August 8, 2006.\n\n<!--This movie is the second sequel. Bring It On is the original movie. Bring It On Again is the first sequel. Bring It On: All or Nothing is the second sequel.-->\nThis film, which is the second sequel to ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'', has a tenuous link to its predecessors, featuring only a similar plot of competing cheerleading teams that have to try something different in order to win. There are no recurring cast members or canonical references to the preceding films. However, the film stylistically refers to its predecessors in that it is the third film in the ''Bring It On'' series to open with a choreographed musical number that turns out to be a dream sequence of the protagonist, and like all three films, the end credits feature outtakes and clips of the cast having fun dancing.\n\n\n==Plot==\nBritney Allen is living a \"dream life\" as the cheerleading captain and girlfriend of Brad Warner, the star quarterback of Pacific Vista High School. Her [[frenemy]] is the highly ambitious Winnie Harper, another member of the squad. Her life changes dramatically when her father loses his job, and the family must relocate to the disadvantaged city, Crenshaw Heights, which Britney, being the \"[[Tokenism|white girl]]\", [[Culture shock|takes quite a while to adjust to]].\n\nShe meets Camille, cheerleading captain of the Crenshaw Heights Warriors and her friends and fellow cheerleaders, Kirresha and Leti. She also meets Jesse, a male \ncheerleader and the only person who is nice to her on her first day. Britney, at the urging of Winnie, has already vowed to never cheer for another team, as this would make her a \"cheer whore\", but after being dared by Camille and Jesse to show up at the cheerleading tryouts, Britney impresses everyone with her skills and experience. Camille, after being persuaded by her friends to \"do it for the squad\", reluctantly lets her in. Britney and Jesse become close and eventually kiss.\n\nAround this time, singer [[Rihanna]] announces a television special where all high school cheerleading squads can compete, with the winners appearing in a performance with her that will be shown worldwide and winning brand new computers for their school. Winnie finds out that Britney's cheering with the Warriors and tells her friends. A week later, Britney lies to Camille, telling her that she cannot cheer at the next game because she will be holding a memorial service for her dead dog; when she is actually going to Pacific Vista's Homecoming dance. Camille and Jesse arrive at Britney's to offer their condolences, and when they see Britney and Brad dressed up for the dance, Camille kicks her off the squad.\n\nAt the dance, Winnie reveals to everyone that she has been sleeping with Brad [[Infidelity|behind Britney's back]], causing Britney to break up with Brad and end her friendship with Winnie. She calls them a \"[[Promiscuity|pig]]\" and \"too much of a [[Backstabbing|backstabber]] to have any real friends\", respectively. On the day of the auditions, Britney arrives at the Warriors' bus and comes to wish them good luck. When Winnie, with the rest of her team, mock and make racial jokes about the Warriors, Britney stands up to Winnie and defends them. Camille, impressed by this, lets Britney cheer with them again. Jesse, however, is still mad at her for not telling him that she had a boyfriend before they had kissed. Both of the rivaling teams show their performances. At the auditions, the two finalists are Pacific Vista and Crenshaw Heights. PV wows the audience with their routine and Camille starts getting worried. Then Britney points out that all their steps are repetitive and that they have their secret weapon: [[Krumping]]. Now dressed in streetwear instead of their regular uniforms, steps on stage during PV's performance and begins mirroring their steps. Finally, they begin krumping, wiping PV off the stage and impressing Rihanna with their routine.  After the Warrior's performance ends, Winnie approaches Rihanna and insists that Crenshaw Heights should be disqualified (\"or arrested\") for interrupting PV's routine. This leads to an argument between Winnie and the rest of the Pacific Vista squad, during which Britney notes, \"Spirit Law states that if there's a cheer [[mutiny]], a squad can vote to replace their captain.\"\n\nEveryone present, even Rihanna and the other performing squads, vote to replace Winnie as the Pacific Vista High cheerleading captain. Winnie protests, dismissing CH's style as \"[[ghetto]]\", to which Rihanna responds that she judges a squad by their skills and not by where they come from. Rihanna ultimately selects Crenshaw Heights as the winners, and the Pacific Vista squad with Britney's friend Amber as their new captain comes forward to congratulate them. Britney and Jesse also make up, kissing backstage after their first performance. The film ends with a made-for-film music video of Rihanna's \"[[Pon de Replay]]\" with the Crenshaw Heights squad dancing in the background. During the end credits, the main characters are seen dancing to the outro music as the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Britney Allen\n* [[Solange Knowles-Smith]] as Camille\n* [[Marcy Rylan]] as Winnie Harper\n* Gus Carr as Jesse\n* [[Jake McDorman]] as Brad Warner\n* [[Giovonnie Samuels]] as Kirresha\n* [[Francia Raisa]] as Let\u00edcia \"Leti\" \n* [[Gary Leroi Gray]] as Tyson \n* Cindy Chiu as Amber\n* [[Danielle Savre]] as Brianna\n* Jessica Fife as Sierra\n* [[Kiersten Warren]] as Pamela Allen\n* [[Eric Bruskotter]] as Timothy Allen\n* [[Rihanna]] as herself\n* [[Swin Cash]] as herself\n\n==Reception==\n''Bring It On: All or Nothing'' received little attention from published movie critics.
