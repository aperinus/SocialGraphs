The screenplay by Clayton Frohman and Zwick was based on [[Nechama Tec]]'s 1993 book ''Defiance: The Bielski Partisans'', an account of the [[Bielski partisans]], a group led by Polish Jewish brothers who saved and recruited Jews in [[Belarus]] during the [[Second World War]]. The film stars [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Tuvia Bielski]], [[Liev Schreiber]] as [[Alexander Zeisal Bielski|Zus Bielski]], [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Asael Bielski]], and [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as [[Aron Bielski]].\n\nProduction began in early September 2007. After a [[limited release]], e.g. [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], in the [[United States]] on December 31, 2008, it went into [[Wide release|general release]] worldwide in January and February 2009.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034303/ |title=Defiance (2008) |access-date=November 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn August 1941, [[Nazi Germany]]'s {{lang|de|[[Einsatzgruppen]]}} are sweeping through [[Eastern Europe]] [[The Holocaust|systematically killing]] [[European Jews]]. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to [[ghetto]]es are the Jewish Bielski brothers: [[Tuvia Bielski|Tuvia]], [[Alexander Zeisal Bielski|Zus]], [[Asael Bielski|Asael]] and [[Aron Bielski|Aron]]. Their parents are dead, killed by local {{lang|de|[[Schutzmannschaft]]}} under orders from the [[German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II|German occupiers]]. The brothers flee to the [[Naliboki forest]], vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents.\n\nThe brothers encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest and take them under their protection and leadership. Tuvia kills the {{lang|de|Schutzmannschaft}} chief responsible for his parents' deaths. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered. The Bielski brothers stage raids on the Germans and their [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborators]]. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Jews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of [[Soviet partisans]], while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Jewish camp in exchange for supplies.\n\nAfter a winter of sickness, [[starvation]], attempted [[mutiny]] and constant hiding, the camp learns that the Germans are about to attack them in force. The Soviets refuse to help and they evacuate the camp as {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} [[Junkers Ju 87|Stukas]] bomb them. A delaying force stays behind, led by Asael, to slow down the German infantry. The defense does not last long; only Asael and a camp member named Sofiya survive to rejoin the rest of the group, who, at the edge of the forest, are confronted with a seemingly impassable marsh. They cross the marsh with only one casualty but are immediately attacked by a German platoon supported by a [[Panzer III]] tank. Just as all seems lost, the Germans are assaulted from the rear by a partisan force led by Zus, who has deserted the Soviets to rejoin the group.\n\nIn the [[epilogue]], it is revealed that the survivors lived in the forest for another two years, building a hospital, a nursery, a school, growing to a total of 1,200 Jews. Original photographs of the participants are shown, including Tuvia in his uniform and their fates are described: Asael was conscripted into the [[Red Army]] and was [[killed in action]], never getting to see the child he fathered; Tuvia, Zus and Aron survived the war and emigrated to the [[United States]] to form a trucking firm in [[New York City]]. The epilogue also states that the Bielski brothers never sought recognition for what they did and that the descendants of the people they saved now number in the tens of thousands.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Tuvia Bielski]]<ref name=\"star\" />\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as [[Alexander Zeisal Bielski|Zus Bielski]]<ref name=\"foursome\" />\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Asael Bielski]]<ref name=\"foursome\" />\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as [[Aron Bielski]]<ref name=\"imdb.com\" />\n* [[Alexa Davalos]] as Lilka Ticktin, a Polish refugee and Tuvia's love interest.<ref name=\"foursome\" />\n* [[Allan Corduner]] as Shimon Haretz, the brothers' old schoolteacher.\n* [[Mark Feuerstein]] as Isaac Malbin, an intellectual.\n* [[Tomas Arana]] as Ben Zion Gulkowitz, a resistance leader.<ref name=\"foursome\" />\n* [[Jacek Koman]] as Konstanty \"Ko\u015bcik\" Koz\u0142owski\n* [[Mia Wasikowska]] as Chaya Dziencielsky, Asael's love interest.\n* [[Iben Hjejle]] as Bella, Zus's love interest.\n* [[Jodhi May]] as Tamara Skidelski, a cousin of the Bielskis who had been raped by a Nazi soldier.\n* [[Kate Fahy]] as Riva Reich\n* [[Iddo Goldberg]] as Yitzhak Shulman\n* [[Sam Spruell]] as Arkady Lubczanski\n* [[Ravil Isyanov]] as Viktor Panchenko, Soviet partisan commander, roughly based on the real life partisan figure, Nikolai Mayakov.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n* Rolandas Boravskis as Gramov, the second-in-command of the Soviet partisans.\n* Kristina Skokova as Red Haired Woman\n\n==Production==\nZwick began writing a script for ''Defiance'' in 1999 after he acquired film rights to Tec's book.

His pen is, if anything, blunter still, with dialogue that crashes down on the big themes like a blacksmith's hammer\".

He told ''The Times'': \"The Bielskis weren't saints. They were flawed heroes, which is what makes them so real and so fascinating.
