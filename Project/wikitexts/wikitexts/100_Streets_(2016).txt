In each story, the main character must deal with the consequences of his previous actions, as each man struggles to overcome obstacles in the path to a better life. One of the characters is Max, a former rugby captain for Team England and celebrity who struggles to keep his marriage together with his estranged wife, Emily. The film also follows a small time drug dealer named Kingsley, who through a chance encounter with an aging actor Terence, finds inspiration to escape his life of petty crime and his disapproving mother. Lastly, George is a gentle cab driver looking for the chance to adopt a child and build a family with his long suffering wife, Kathy. How each man deals with his personal challenges reveals how circumstance, accidental encounters and conscious decisions determine our fate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Idris Elba]] as Max<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/11/100-streets-idris-elba-gemma-arterton-jim-ohanlon-1201746666/|title='100 Streets' Trailer: Idris Elba Plays a Retired Rugby Player Who Spirals Out of Control|date=November 15, 2016|access-date=January 13, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Gemma Arterton]] as Emily\n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Kingsley\n* [[Ken Stott]] as Terence\n* [[Kierston Wareing]] as Kathy\n* [[Charlie Creed-Miles]] as George\n* [[Tom Cullen]] as Jake\n* [[Ryan Gage]] as Vincent\n\n==Production==\nWriter and producer Leon Butler penned the script and also single-handedly raised the entire \u00a33 million budget from private equity.<ref name=\"budget\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2016, and was released in the United States in theaters and on video-on-demand on 13 January 2017 by [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]].<ref name=\"100 Streets\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a score of 41%, based on 39 reviews, and an average score of 4.9/10.
