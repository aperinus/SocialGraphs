Directed by [[Bruce W. Smith]], in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], it is based upon comedian [[Robin Harris]]' [[stand-up comedy]] act of the same name.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lenburg |first1=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=1999 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=0-8160-3831-7 |access-date=June 6, 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780816038312/page/168/mode/2up |pages=168\u2013169}}</ref> Harris died two years before the film was released; in the film, he is voiced by [[Faizon Love]], in his film debut. The film co-stars [[Vanessa Bell Calloway]], [[Marques Houston]], [[Nell Carter]] and [[Tone L\u014dc]].\n\nOriginally released theatrically on July 31, 1992 by [[Paramount Pictures]], it received mostly negative reviews from critics and grossed $8.4 million at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nThe original [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up routine]] by [[Robin Harris]] is shown in a brief live-action segment before an animated version of Harris woefully recounts his troubles to a blind bartender. He traces his problems all the way back to Jamika, an attractive woman he met at a funeral.\n\nOutside the premises, Robin approaches Jamika and asks her out. Jamika picks up her mild-mannered son, Leon, from the babysitter and invites Robin to come along with her to the amusement park Fun World, to which Robin agrees. The next day, Jamika introduces Robin to LaShawn, Kahlil and Pee-Wee, a trio of neglected, truant, violent children and the offspring of her absentee hedonistic friend, B\u00e9b\u00e9, for whom Jamika serves as an obvious enabler. All six travel to Fun World, but are confronted by security at the entrance, and warned they are being watched. Upon entering the park, the kids are set loose and promptly wreak havoc. Robin's disastrous outing is further disrupted by a chance encounter with his ex-wife, Dorothea, and her best friend Vivian.\n\nAfter going on a couple of rides with the kids, Robin and Jamika let them go off on their own again as they attempt to enjoy a ride through the Tunnel of Love, where Jamika commends Robin for his endurance. While Robin and Jamika spend time together on their own, Leon tries to fit in with B\u00e9b\u00e9's kids but is at first unsuccessful, although they allow him to tag along. The kids then resume their mischief until they are caught by security. However, they escape and convince a group of other free-range children to spread the chaos. Meanwhile, Dorothea and Vivian attempt to sabotage the growing relationship between Robin and Jamika but are thwarted by Robin.\n\nElsewhere, in an abandoned building, Leon and B\u00e9b\u00e9's kids are captured by animatronic robot versions of the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Richard Nixon]], and are put on trial. The robot \"Terminator\" acts as judge who decides whether their antics are worth sending to the electric chair, while \"Lincoln\" acts as the kids' defense attorney with \"Nixon\" as the prosecutor. Leon proves his courage through a rap that not only wins their freedom but also gains him B\u00e9b\u00e9's kids' respect. They celebrate their victory by stealing a pirate ship and crashing it into a recreation of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], taking hostage the crew and passengers, including Dorothea and Vivian.\n\nRobin and Jamika finally leave Fun World, with the park ultimately crumbling in destruction through Robin's rearview mirror. When a cop passes, Robin tries to get his attention, but B\u00e9b\u00e9's kids scare the officer away. Robin drops the kids off at their apartment, where he sees how they really live. B\u00e9b\u00e9, as usual, is nowhere to be seen, and has left a note on the empty refrigerator, expecting Jamika to feed the kids. Sad to see Robin go, the kids bid him an emotional goodbye, but not before he gives them what money he has left so they can order themselves a pizza. At the bar, Robin has a change of heart and returns to hang out with the kids a little while longer, despite all the mayhem they've caused. The kids force him to take them all to Las Vegas, where everybody flees in terror when they recognize the kids. Pee-Wee finds and pulls a plug out of a socket, causing a citywide [[Power outage|blackout]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Faizon Love]] as [[Robin Harris]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Christon|first=Lawrence|date=July 28, 1992|title=Comic's Legacy: 'Bebe's Kids' : Robin Harris Lives On in New Animated Feature|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-07-28-ca-4863-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=June 24, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602154204/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-07-28-ca-4863-story.html|archivedate=June 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Harris makes a live-action appearance in the opening scene.\n* [[Vanessa Bell Calloway]] as Jamika\n* [[Marques Houston]] as Kahlil\n* Jonell Green as LaShawn\n* [[Tone L\u014dc]] as Pee-Wee\n* Wayne Collins Jr. as Leon\n* Myra J. as Dorothea\n* [[Nell Carter]] as Vivian\n* [[Phillip Glasser]] as Winthrop \"Opie\"\n* [[Louie Anderson]] as Security Guard #1\n* [[Tom Everett]] as Security Guard #2\n* [[Rich Little]] as President Nixon\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Card Player #1\n* [[George Wallace (American comedian)|George Wallace]] as Card Player #4\n\n==Original stand-up version==\nIn the original act, Robin's prospective girlfriend, Jamika, asks him to take her and her son to a [[Disneyland]]-type amusement park, but when he agrees she shows up with four kids, three of whom are the neglected children of her friend, B\u00e9b\u00e9, whom Jamika refuses to judge.\n\nB\u00e9b\u00e9's kids are misbehaved truants and violent troublemakers, over whom Jamika does not attempt to exercise any control. They terrorize park staff, cut off [[Donald Duck]]'s feet to use for swimming, try to steal Robin's [[8-track tape|8-track]]/radio while he's listening to it, and make a general menace of themselves, literally destroying the park. Their reputation is so bad that even the police refuse to mess with them. In the second act, Robin is picked up from a bar by Jamika and the kids. The kids force him to take them to Las Vegas.
