It is based on the [[The Beverly Hillbillies|television series of the same name]] (which ran from 1962\u201371) and features [[cameo appearance]]s by [[Buddy Ebsen]] (the original [[Jed Clampett]], in his final motion picture appearance, playing his other starring television role, [[Barnaby Jones|Detective Barnaby Jones]]), [[Dolly Parton]], and [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]. The film follows a poor [[hillbilly]] named Jed Clampett (Jim Varney), who becomes a billionaire after inadvertently finding crude oil on his property while firing his gun.<ref>{{cite news|title= Hollywood To Make Movie Of Old 'Beverly Hillbillies'|work= Orlando Sentinel|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-01-24/news/9301240378_1_beverly-hillbillies-dabney-coleman-series-the-beverly|access-date=2010-10-06}}</ref>\n\n==Plot ==\nJed Clampett ([[Jim Varney]]), a hillbilly of humble station from Arkansas, accidentally discovers oil on his land while shooting at a [[jackrabbit]]. Ozark Mountain Oil, interested in purchasing his land, offers him $1 billion for the property. Unsure of what to do, Jed consults his sister, Pearl Bodine ([[Linda Carlson]]), during a family dinner. Pearl suggests that a change of scenery for Jed's daughter, Elly May ([[Erika Eleniak]]), would be a good thing. Pearl and Jethro convince them to move to Beverly Hills California. Ozark Mountain Oil come by Jed's place to check to see if he has signed the contract. Having made up his mind and signed the contract, Jed and his daughter, his mother-in-law, Daisy Moses (aka \"Granny\" ([[Cloris Leachman]]), and his nephew, Jethro ([[Diedrich Bader]]), Pearl's son, load up Jethro's old, dilapidated truck with their possessions and move to [[Beverly Hills, California]], even though Granny is reluctant to come.\n\nMilburn Drysdale ([[Dabney Coleman]]), the [[CEO]] of the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills (where Jed's money is stored), sends out his secretary/assistant, Jane Hathaway ([[Lily Tomlin]]) to meet the Clampetts at their new estate that is next door to his. Jane calls the [[Beverly Hills Police Department|Beverly Hills Police]] after the Clampetts arrive, mistaking them for burglars. Upon learning of Jane's mistake at the police station, Drysdale briefly fires her. But seeing that Jed insists that he still wants her to watch over his affairs, Drysdale rehires her.\n\nThe Clampetts settle into their new surroundings. Drysdale and his wife, Margaret ([[Penny Fuller]]), push their reluctant son, Morgan Drysdale ([[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]]), into befriending Elly May, to whom he eventually develops an attraction. Jane is also smitten by Jethro, who seems ignorant of her affections.\n\nJed requests Jane's assistance in helping him search for someone who will help turn Elly May into a lady and also wants to get married, so Miss Hathaway has to play matchmaker. Woodrow Tyler ([[Rob Schneider]]), a banker at Drysdale's bank, catches wind of this and contrives a scheme with his con artist girlfriend, Laura Jackson ([[Lea Thompson]]), to steal Jed's money by having her marry Jed.  She poses as a French etiquette teacher, Laurette Voleur,<ref>''[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/voleur Voleur]'' is French for ''thief'', per the ''Collins French to English Dictionary''. Copyright \u00a9 by HarperCollins Publishers. All rights reserved. ''(Retrieved 2018-09-06.)''</ref> and asks for work. 'Laurette' feigns romantic interest in Jed, which eventually leads to him proposing marriage to her.\n\nShortly before the wedding, Granny hears Laura and Woodrow talking about the scam. Granny reveals herself to the pair and threatens to expose their scam to Jed, and thus the impending wedding will be off. But before she can do so, they capture her, restrain her, and have her institutionalized at the Los Viejos Nursing Home, so that she cannot contact Jed.\n\nAt the wedding, Woodrow prepares to transfer all of Clampett's money in Drysdale's bank to a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] account, on his [[laptop]] computer, when the couple says 'I do'. Realizing that Granny is missing, Jane goes to the office of [[Barnaby Jones]] ([[Buddy Ebsen]]) and after learning where Granny is and who Laura is, poses as a nurse and breaks her out. Granny and Jane arrive at the wedding and foil Laura and Tyler's plan when Jane grabs a shotgun and blows the laptop to bits, before they can steal Jed's money. The police arrest Laura and Woodrow. Jed decides that, since the wedding was off, they should have 'one hellacious shindig'.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Jed Clampett|Jedidiah D.
