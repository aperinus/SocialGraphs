The film was distributed by [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]] as a [[double feature]] showing with Corman's ''[[Not of This Earth (1957 film)|Not of This Earth]]''.\n\nThe film concerns a second scientific expedition that is sent to a remote Pacific island to discover what happened to the scientists of the first. Unknown to them when they arrive, the island is inhabited by a pair of radiation-mutated giant crabs that not only consumed the members of the first expedition, but absorbed their minds, and now plan to reproduce their kind in numbers. \n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nA group of scientists and their support crew of five sailors land on a remote island in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. They are searching for a previous expedition that disappeared without a trace, and to continue their research on the effects of radiation from [[Operation Crossroads|the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests]] on the island's plant and sea life. The scientists on the expedition are led by Dr. Karl Weigand ([[Leslie Bradley]]), and also include geologist James Carson (Richard H. Cutting) and biologists Jules Deveroux ([[Mel Welles]]), Martha Hunter (Duncan), and Dale Drewer (Garland). Their party also includes technician and handyman Hank Chapman (Johnson).\n\nSoon after their arrival, a sailor, Tate ([[Charles B. Griffith]]), falls in the water and is killed, his decapitated body floating to the surface. Two sailors (Beach Dickerson and Tony Miller) are left behind to guard the explorers, while the others, led by Ensign Quinlan ([[Ed Nelson]]), attempt to return to the mainland, but their seaplane inexplicably explodes.\n\nThe scientists are unable to report what happened due to a storm, so they decide to stay on the island and continue their research. They read journal entries written by the previous scientific team, which mention killer worm creatures. Martha and Dale later go scuba diving. That night, Martha hears \"McLane\", leader of the previous expedition, calling out to her. Carson descends into a pit that opened up outside during an inexplicable earthquake and falls, losing his footing.\n\nThe current expedition learns to their horror that the earlier group had been killed and eaten by two mutated, intelligent giant crabs, who have absorbed the minds of their victims and can speak telepathically in their voices. Members of the current expedition are being systematically attacked and killed by the monsters, which are now invulnerable to most standard weaponry because of their cell structure mutations.\n\nThe remaining scientists finally discover that both giant crabs are the cause of the ongoing earthquakes and landslides on the island; they are slowly destroying the island, reducing its size, by undermining it with tunnels. The scientists turn their attention to a way to stop the mating pair of monsters from reproducing. They are able to kill one of the giant crabs in a cave when their placed explosive detonates, shaking loose an overhead rock that crushes the head of the monster.\n\nAs the island continues to fall away into the Pacific, and after barely escaping from their collapsing laboratory building, the surviving trio of Dale, Martha, and Hank finally meet the remaining intelligent giant crab, Hoolar, who speaks to them via telepathy. Hoolar vows to go to the mainland with her fertilized eggs when the island is gone (and the three humans are dead) to feed upon even more people, absorbing those minds in the process. Hank then sacrifices himself by bringing down an electrically-charged broadcast tower directly on top of the giant crab, electrocuting the monster and her unhatched brood. Dale and Martha embrace on the small portion of what remains of the once large island.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Garland]] as Dale Drewer\n* [[Pamela Duncan (actress)|Pamela Duncan]] as Martha Hunter\n* [[Russell Johnson]] as Hank Chapman\n* [[Leslie Bradley]] as Dr. Karl Weigand\n* [[Mel Welles]] as Jules Deveroux\n* Richard H.

Griffith]], who had worked with Roger Corman on a number of occasions. Griffith later described the scripting process:<blockquote>\"Roger came to me and said, 'I want to make a picture called ''Attack of the Giant Crabs'' and I asked, 'Does it have to be atomic radiation?' He responded, 'Yes.' He said it was an experiment. 'I want suspense or action in every scene. No kind of scene without suspense or action.' His trick was saying it was an experiment, which it wasn't. He just didn't want to bother cutting out the other scenes, which he would do\".<ref>Fischer, Dennis.

Griffith said,\n<blockquote>\"I had just read ''[[The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure|The Silent World]]'' by [[Jacques Cousteau]] and found it to be new and exciting. So when that picture came along, I wrote all the underwater stuff and went to Roger and told him I\u2019d direct all the underwater parts for $100. He said 'okay.' If I had just asked, he would have said 'no.' I had to put it in a way that he would jump at. So I directed all that stuff and it was rather funny. I\u2019d be down at the bottom of the tank at [[Marineland of the Pacific|Marineland]] trying to get actors to do something while (director of photography) [[Floyd Crosby]] was hammering at the glass window trying to get them to do something else. (Laughs.) It was all pretty silly\".<ref>Graham, Aaron W.[http://sensesofcinema.com/2005/35/charles_b_griffith/ \"Little Shop of Genres: An interview with Charles B.

Earning an estimated $1 million,<ref name=\"frank\"/> ''Attack of the Crab Monsters'' was Corman's most profitable production up to that time, which he attributed to the \"wildness of the title,\" the construction of the storyline,<ref name=\"frank\"/> the structuring of every scene for horror and suspense, and editing for pace.<ref name=\"franco\">di Franco 1979 p. 78.</ref> Corman:\n<blockquote>This was the most successful of all the early low budget horror movies. I think its success had something to do with the wildness of the title which, even I admit, is pretty off-the-wall. However, I do think a lot of its popularity had to do with the construction of the plotline. I've always believed that, in horror and science fiction films, too much time is usually spent explaining the characters in depth and developing various subplots. Genre audiences really come to these movies for their science fiction elements or their shock value. Of course they want to understand the characters and want to empathize with them all in order to share the emotions present. But they don't wish to do that at the expense of the other aspects of the picture. I talked to Chuck Griffith about this. Chuck and I worked out a general storyline before he went to work on the script. I told him, 'I don't want any scene in this picture that doesn't either end with a shock or the suspicion that a shocking event is about to take place.' And that's how the finished script read. You always had the feeling when watching the movie that something, anything was about to happen. I think this construction, plus the fact that the creature was big and ugly, won audiences.<ref name=\"tcm\">[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67771/Attack-of-the-Crab-Monsters/articles.html Ed Naha ''Brilliance on a Budget'' reprinted in ''Turner Classic Movies'']</ref></blockquote>\n\nCorman has stated that the success of the film convinced him that horror and humor was an effective combination.<ref>Corman and Jerome 1990, p. 39.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nAccording to Tim Dirks, the film was one of a wave of \"cheap teen movies\" released for the [[Drive-in theater|drive-in market]].
