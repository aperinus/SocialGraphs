His sister tries to find him a suitable woman, but his real passion is putting on amateur theatre productions of [[Oscar Wilde]] plays, particularly ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]''. The film deals with his struggle, temptation, and friendships, and how they are affected by his homosexuality.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connell|first=Di\u00f3g|title=World Film Locations: Dublin|year=2012|publisher=Intellect Books|pages=36\u201337|isbn=9781841505503|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ce9MOsVbu-AC&q=%22A+Man+of+No+Importance%22+finney&pg=PA36|editor=Jez Conolly, Caroline Whelan}}</ref>\n\nAlfred is a bus conductor who recites poetry and Oscar Wilde play lines to his regular bus riders.  This year he hopes to put together the Wilde play ''Salome''.  Alfie lives with his sister Lily.  He lines up the church hall only telling the priest that the play is about [[John the Baptist]].  A new beautiful young rider, Adele Rice, is his perfect Salome.  Alfie lives above the Carson Butcher Shop and he slates up the butcher as King Herod.  He wants his bus driver Robbie to be John the Baptist, but Robbie refuses, saying he is no actor.  When the theatre group meets, Alfie tells them that they are not doing ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' this year but rather ''Salome''.  Butcher Carson finds the play offensive and misses rehearsals.\n\nByrne goes ahead with his amateur production with his friend Birdy as stage manager and Mrs. Crowe for costumes and assumes all is going well. Alfie's sister sets up a dinner date and a trip to the zoo with his leading lady, Adele.  She tells Alfie she already had a boyfriend, John.  Widow Birdie tells Alfie of the joys and benefits of marriage.  An actor questions Alfie about his portrayal of Salome as a virgin princess.   Butcher Carson goes to church counsel and tries to stop the smut-filled play.\n\nAlfie decides to give in to temptation and go to a gay bar.  He approaches a young good looking man called Kitty and asks for a cuddle.  They go outside and he is mugged and robbed.  His closeted homosexuality is exposed.  He suffers from fierce [[homophobia]] from his community, but he does get some support from actors in his play.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Alfred Byrne\n* [[Brenda Fricker]] as Lily Byrne\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Ivor J.
