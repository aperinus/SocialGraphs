The members are exploited by corrupt labor union boss Jerry Merke, and the leadership of the [[International Longshoremen's Association|ILA union]] urges Danny to run against him. Sneperger's gambling leaves him in a huge debt with [[Cleveland crime family|Cleveland Mafia]] captain [[John Nardi]]. In return for Sneperger's debt being forgiven, Danny supplies Nardi with goods stolen from the docks. Merke finds out, demands a cut of Danny's profits, and sends his enforcer Joe Buka to kill him. Danny provokes Buka into a fist fight and beats him unconscious. He kicks Merke out of his office, and is elected local union president. He improves the working conditions at the docks and starts doing business with Nardi.\n\nDanny's own corruption as union president is revealed in an expos\u00e9 by [[The Plain Dealer|the local newspaper]]. Cleveland police detective Joe Manditski, who grew up with Danny in [[Collinwood]], arrests him. Broke and facing prison, Danny [[plea bargain|pleads]] to lesser charges in return for becoming an [[FBI]] informant and being banned for life from [[organized labor]]. Danny is released and moves his unhappy wife and daughters back to Collinwood. Nardi gets him work as an enforcer for Jewish [[loan shark]] [[Alex Birns|Shondor Birns]] and brokers a deal with Mafia captain [[Jack Licavoli]] for Danny to force the city's garbage haulers to join the union Licavoli controls. Danny, McComber, Sneperger, and local boxing champ Keith Ritson terrorize many into joining, but Danny's friend Mike Frato refuses. Licavoli orders Danny to kill Frato, but Danny balks because Frato has ten children. Nardi counsels him privately that being a successful criminal involves doing things you do not want to.\n\nAs Danny prepares to kill Frato with a car bomb, he learns from the FBI that Sneperger has returned to gambling, and has become a police informant. Sneperger is assigned to set a remote controlled bomb under Frato's car, but Danny sets it off as he is doing it. An enraged Frato later starts shooting at Danny in a park. Danny returns a single shot to Frato's head, killing him. Danny is arrested, but released when Frato's driver tells Manditski that Danny acted in self-defense. Having had enough, Danny's long suffering wife leaves him and takes their children.\n\nDanny wants to open an upscale restaurant and lounge and asks Birns for help. Birns arranges a $70,000 loan from the [[Gambino crime family|Gambino family]], but Birns' courier buys [[cocaine]] with the money and gets arrested. Birns and Danny have a falling out over who should pay the money back. Birns hires a hitman to kill Danny. Danny narrowly escapes, and kills Birns with a car bomb. After Mafia boss [[John T. Scalish]] dies, both Nardi and Licavoli are considered for succession. Licavoli is chosen due to his close ties to the New York Mafia families and decides to charge Danny a 30% \"street tax\" for doing business in Cleveland. Danny refuses to pay, crudely mocks Licavoli's Italian heritage, and vows, \"The Irishman's in business for himself now.\"\n\nAn outraged Licavoli has Danny's house blown up, but he and his girlfriend survive. Licavoli then attempts to demote Nardi and take away his business, only to have the latter join forces with Danny. Vowing to take over Cleveland together, Danny and Nardi start by organizing the murders of several of Licavoli's men. Danny escapes several attempts on his life and the summer of 1976 sees 46 bombings in the Cleveland area between the warring gangs. The national attention it draws humiliates Licavoli and he humbly asks [[Genovese Crime Family|Genovese]] boss [[Anthony Salerno]] in New York for help.\n\nWanting a new life away from Cleveland with his new fiance, Danny travels to New York and makes Salerno an offer: in return for surrendering the war to Licavoli, Salerno will invest in a Texas ranch that Danny will start. Salerno is noncommittal and Nardi does not trust him. Salerno arranges for hitman [[Ray Ferritto]] to travel to Cleveland and work for Licavoli. Ferritto turns the tide for the Cleveland Mafia and all of Danny's closest allies, including Nardi, are killed. Detective Manditski offers Danny protection, but Danny refuses. Ferrito taps Danny's girlfriend's phone and learns that Danny has a dentist appointment. After the appointment, Danny checks his car for any explosive devices before realizing Ferritto planted a bomb in the parked car next to his. Ferrito detonates the bomb, killing Danny.\n\n==Cast==\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-left:0.2em; border: 1px solid #BBB;\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n| valign=\"top\" |[[File:ChristopherWalkenFeb08.jpg<!--\n  -->|95px]]<br />Christopher Walken\n|}\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-left:0.2em; border: 1px solid #BBB;\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n| valign=\"top\" |[[File:Val Kilmer Cannes.jpg<!--\n  -->|90px]]<br />Val Kilmer\n|}\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-left:0.2em; border: 1px solid #BBB;\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n| valign=\"top\" |[[File:Vincent Utah.jpg<!--\n  -->|81px]]<br />Vincent D'Onofrio\n|}\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-left:0.2em; border: 1px solid #BBB;\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n| valign=\"top\" |[[File:Th Comic-Con Ray Day0211-1-1.jpg<!--\n  -->|76px]]<br />Ray Stevenson\n|}\n<!--In movie credit order please do not change-->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] as [[Danny Greene|Danny 'The Irishman' Greene]]\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as [[John Nardi]]\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as Detective Joe Manditski\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Alex Birns|Alex 'Shondor' Birns]]\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Joan Madigan\n* [[Tony Darrow]] as Mikey Mendarolo\n* [[Robert Davi]] as [[Ray Ferritto]]\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Grace O'Keefe \n* [[Bob Gunton]] as Jerry Merke \n* [[Jason Butler Harner]] as Art 'Snep' Sneperger\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as Keith 'The Enforcer' Ritson\n* [[Tony Lo Bianco]] as [[James T.

Producer Tommy Reid heard that Rick Porrello, an Ohio policeman, was about to publish a book about Greene called ''To Kill the Irishman''. Reid flew to Ohio and met with Porrello, who told Reid his grandfather was a high-ranking Mafia figure in Cleveland during the prohibition era. On March 17, 1998, they signed a deal for the film rights to the book.<ref name=\"McDermott, Mark 2011\"/> Getting ''Kill the Irishman'' produced was difficult. Reid frequently left deals unconcluded, and discovered that the script he'd commissioned was attached to a cover with another screenwriter and producer's name listed. According to Reid, this was a common occurrence in Hollywood,<ref name=\"McDermott, Mark 2011\"/> and he claims to have spent over $1 million to ensure the film was made.<ref name=\"McDermott, Mark 2011\"/>\n\n==Pre-production==\n\n===Inspiration===\nReid was a fan of Mafia movies (including ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[Goodfellas]]'') and aspired to become a filmmaker. Being of Irish and Italian ancestry, he wanted to make a film that would relate to both nationalities.<ref name=\"rivetingriffs.com\">{{cite journal| author='Montague, Joe |url=http://www.rivetingriffs.com/Tommy%20Reid.html |title=Interview with Film Director Tommy Reid| journal=Riveting Riffs |date=September 15, 2013 |access-date=January 24, 2015}}</ref> Reid first heard about mobster Danny Greene from his roommates in Ohio, and believed that [[New York City]], [[Chicago]] and [[Boston]] were the \"three meccas of mafia crime\". According to Reid, there wasn't much documentation on Greene's life, but after hearing that Porrello was about to publish a book on Greene and the Mafia in Cleveland, he was determined to make a movie about him.<ref name=\"McDermott, Mark 2011\"/>\n\n===Background research===\nPrior to making ''Kill the Irishman'', Reid and screenwriter Jeremy Walters conducted research on Greene's life and organized crime in Cleveland. Reid spoke with Sister Barbara Eppich, a nun who helped raise Greene during his childhood. Sister Barbara told Reid of how Greene was abandoned during childhood and was raised by his grandfather. Because his grandfather worked nights, Greene was left to walk the streets. He would go to school dirty on a regular basis, and Sister Barbara would have to wash him. She also stated that Greene would sleep all the time but was a \"phenomenal athlete\".<ref name=\"clevelandmovieblog.com\">{{cite web |author=Roche, Peter M. |url=http://www.clevelandmovieblog.com/2011/03/producer-tommy-reid-talks-danny-greene.html |title=Producer Tommy Reid talks 'Danny Greene\" documentary |website=Cleveland Movie Blog |date=March 23, 2011 |access-date=January 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nReid spoke to a number of law enforcement agencies, including the [[FBI]]. The FBI wanted to make sure that Reid wasn't glorifying the Mafia. Reid stated he had no intentions of glorifying crime and that \"the whole message at the end of the movie is that crime doesn't pay\".<ref name=\"rivetingriffs.com\"/> On a similar subject, Hensleigh also said the \"film [doesn't suggest Greene] was a hero\". However, he did note the film provides a balanced perspective.<ref name=IrishCentral>{{cite web|author=O'Doherty, Cahir |date=March 11, 2011|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/-a-man-you-dont-meet-every-day-kill-the-irishman-117794749-237375141.html |title=A man you don't meet every day - 'Kill the Irishman'|website=irishcentral.com|access-date= April 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile researching his role, Stevenson looked at TV footage of Greene and read Porrello's book, ''To Kill The Irishman''.<ref name=\"goodfilmguide.co.uk\"/> According to Stevenson, there was \"quite a bit\" of research material available.<ref name=\"goodfilmguide.co.uk\"/> D'Onofrio, on the other hand, had the opposite experience.

From his research for the movie, Reid became specialized in the Northern Ohio crime scene and Greene's life,<ref name=\"clevelandmovieblog.com\"/> and felt that by making the documentary, at least he could go to his \"grave 'saying I tried'\".<ref name=\"McDermott, Mark 2011\"/>\n\nIn 2009, with 17 hours of the documentary shot, Reid was told his film had been green-lit. He joined forces with the production company Code Entertainment and engaged with a \"reliable\" director; [[Jonathan Hensleigh]]. They then signed the actors [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Christopher Walken]],<ref name=\"McDermott, Mark 2011\"/> and later [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] (''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''), [[Paul Sorvino]] (''[[Goodfellas]]''), and the Irish actor [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]], respectively.<ref name=\"McDermott, Mark 2011\" /> Stevenson was filming ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' when he got a telephone call from Hensleigh, so they arranged to meet in Los Angeles; according to Stevenson, he was drawn to the script and immediately made a deal.<ref name=\"goodfilmguide.co.uk\">{{cite web|author=Wheeldon, Matt |url=http://goodfilmguide.co.uk/kill-the-irishman-interview-with-lead-actor-ray-stevenson/ |title=Kill The Irishman: Interview with Lead Actor Ray Stevenson |website=Good Film Guide |date=September 23, 2011 |access-date=January 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nOn May 19, 2009,<ref name=FernandezHR>Fernandez, Jay A.

Stevenson said everyone \"had to be on point,\" and that any mistakes couldn't be rectified by re-filming. For example, the producers couldn't afford to shoot the film's final scene (in which Greene is killed via a car explosion) twice.

To me, I think [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''Goodfellas'' is that type of film for the gangster genre. In the 21 years since the film was released, so many filmmakers have tried so hard to copy ''Goodfellas''' success, and so few have gotten even close to capturing the magic that Scorsese did in one of his very best films. The 21 years have been littered with a bunch of pale imitations. To that list, you can add Jonathan Hensleigh's ''Kill the Irishman'', which wants so desperately to be ''Goodfellas'', and comes up so very, very short.<ref name=VanHouwelingen>Van Houwelingen, Dave (29 March 2011).
