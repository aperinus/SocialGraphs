It is based on the young adult novel ''All the Way'' by American author Andy Behrens.<ref>{{cite news |author = Robinson, Tasha |title = Q&A with Andy Behrens, the author behind 'Sex Drive' |url = http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/oct/17/books/chi-andy-behrens-sex-drive-1017oct17 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090515101128/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/oct/17/books/chi-andy-behrens-sex-drive-1017oct17 |newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] |date = October 17, 2008 |archive-date = May 15, 2009 |url-status = dead |access-date = August 22, 2009 }}</ref> The film was directed by [[Sean Anders]], and stars [[Josh Zuckerman]], [[Amanda Crew]], [[Clark Duke]], [[Seth Green]], and [[James Marsden]], while [[Katrina Bowden]], [[Alice Greczyn]], [[Michael Cudlitz]], [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]], and [[David Koechner]] appear in supporting roles. It was released in North America on October 17, 2008, and in the United Kingdom on January 9, 2009. The film received mixed reviews, with the performances of Duke, Marsden, and Green receiving praise.\n\n==Plot==\nIan Lafferty is an 18-year-old recent high school graduate. He searches for a girl online making it seem as if he is attractive and strong, although he is sweet and unassuming. He soon meets \"Ms. Tasty\" and agrees to meet her in person. She lives in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], while he lives in [[Bartlett, Illinois]]. With his best friends Lance Nesbitt and Felicia Alpine, he goes to Knoxville in a [[Pontiac GTO|1969 Pontiac GTO Judge]] borrowed without permission from Ian's arrogant, homophobic and macho older brother Rex.\n\nOn the way to Knoxville, they come across a hitchhiker, as the radiator in the Judge overheats. They attempt urinating in the radiator, which only works briefly as they try to leave the hitchhiker in the dust. The hitchhiker, frustrated at Ian's lack of concern for his well-being, leaves, but not before urinating on the car window. As Ian and Felicia wander to find help, Lance is waiting with the car as Ezekiel happens to pass by in his horse-drawn buggy. Ezekiel and his [[Amish]] buddies repair the car while they join a [[Rumspringa]] party where [[Fall Out Boy]] are playing a concert, and at which Lance meets an attractive Amish girl named Mary. The three promise to come again on the way back to do some work in return for fixing the car.\n\nThey go to jail due to Ian throwing a tire iron into a state trooper car, due to his increasing frustration after trying to put a possum he hit out of its misery, and are released after Mary pays the bail. Upon arriving in Knoxville, they find a hotel that sports a wide variety of role playing rooms. Rex, who has discovered the Judge missing, arrives angrily and insists that they go back and that Ian cannot visit Ms. Tasty. After Ian pretends to be gay, Rex allows him to see Ms. Tasty, hoping this encounter will change Ian's mind. Ian finally meets Ms. Tasty. However, when he tells her about Felicia, her seduction of Ian becomes a threat as her psychotic boyfriend Bobby Jo puts a gun to Ian's head. It becomes apparent that they work at a chop shop and attempt to steal the Judge.\n\nLance and Mary arrive after having sex, as well as a redneck named Rick, whose girlfriend Brandy slept with Lance earlier. Felicia, however, is hiding in the car when Bobby Jo tries to steal it. Soon, a green car that has been continuously drag-racing with the Judge throughout the movie arrives. Ian manages to save Felicia, who then is able to run off and report to the police. Ms. Tasty tries to escape, but is stopped by the green car, whose drivers turn out to be Andy and Randy, two dim-witted self-declared \"womanizers\" from Ian's school, whom Ms. Tasty tried to manipulate into giving her the car. Bobby Jo is treated after being shot by Ian in self-defense. Felicia tells the police about the chop shop location and the couple is arrested.\n\nUpon finding out that if Mary leaves the Amish community, she will be shunned, Lance refuses to come back home and stays behind to marry Mary, while Ian and Felicia realize their love for each other. Ian and Felicia drive to a tree where Ian throws his shoes up into the tree. A few weeks later Ian is Felicia's date to her cousin's wedding. At Thanksgiving dinner, Rex tells his family that he is gay. On New Year's Eve Ian and Felicia finally have sex, in Ian's basement under a blanket on the sofa. In the final frame of the film, a picture is shown of Lance and Mary getting married, accompanied by Ian. Lance is shown sporting a beard exactly like Ezekiel's. During the credits, a short scene shows Ezekiel and Fall Out Boy arguing over the fact that the Amish fixed Fall Out Boy's tour bus for just \"a five song set\" in form for compensation, referring to a running gag throughout the movie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing |\n* [[Josh Zuckerman]] as Ian Lafferty\n* [[Amanda Crew]] as Felicia Alpine\n* [[Clark Duke]] as Lance Nesbitt\n* [[Seth Green]] as Ezekiel\n* [[James Marsden]] as Rex Lafferty\n* [[Katrina Bowden]] as Ms. Tasty\n* [[Alice Greczyn]] as Mary\n* [[Michael Cudlitz]] as Rick\n* [[David Koechner]] as Hitchhiker\n* [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Bobby Jo\n* [[Mark L.
