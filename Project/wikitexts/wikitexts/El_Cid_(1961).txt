The film is loosely based on the life of the 11th century [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] warlord [[El Cid|Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar]], called \"El Cid\" (from the Arabic [[sidi|as-sidi]], meaning \"The Lord\"). The film stars [[Charlton Heston]] in the title role and [[Sophia Loren]] as [[Ximena D\u00edaz|Do\u00f1a Ximena]]. The screenplay is credited to [[Fredric M. Frank]], [[Philip Yordan]], and [[Ben Barzman]] with uncredited contributions by [[Bernard Gordon (writer)|Bernard Gordon]].\n\n''El Cid'' premiered on December 6, 1961 at the Metropole Theatre in London, and was released on December 14 in the United States. The film received largely positive reviews praising the performances of Heston and Loren, the cinematography, and the musical score. It went on to gross $26.6 million during its initial theatrical run. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]].\n\n==Plot==\nGeneral Ben Yusuf of the [[Almoravid dynasty]] has summoned all the [[emir]]s of [[Al-Andalus]] to North Africa. He chastises them for co-existing peacefully with their Christian neighbors, which goes against his dream of Islamic world domination. The emirs return to Spain with orders to resume hostilities with the Christians while Ben Yusuf readies his army for a full-scale invasion.\n\nDon Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, on the way to his wedding with [[Jimena D\u00edaz|Do\u00f1a Ximena]], rescues a Spanish town from an invading [[Moors|Moorish]] army. Two of the Emirs, [[Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud|Al-Mu'tamin]] of [[Zaragoza]] and Al-Kadir of [[Valencia]], are captured. More interested in peace than in wreaking vengeance, Rodrigo escorts his prisoners to Vivar and releases them on condition that they never again attack lands belonging to [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile|King Ferdinand of Castile]]. The Emirs proclaim him \"El Cid\" (Castilian Spanish for the Arabic for [[milord]]: \"Al [[Sidi]]\") and swear allegiance to him.\n\nFor his act of mercy, Don Rodrigo is accused of treason by [[Garc\u00eda Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez|Count Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]]. In court, the charge is supported by Ximena's father, Count Gormaz, the king's champion. Rodrigo's aged father, Don Diego, angrily calls Gormaz a liar. Gormaz strikes Don Diego, challenging him to a [[duel]]. At a private meeting Rodrigo begs Gormaz to ask the aged but proud Diego for forgiveness (for accusing Rodrigo of treason). Gormaz refuses, so Rodrigo fights the duel on Diego\u2019s behalf and kills his opponent. Ximena witnesses the death of Gormaz and swears to avenge him, renouncing her affection for Rodrigo.\n\nWhen the King of Aragon demands the city of [[Calahorra]], Rodrigo becomes Ferdinand's champion, winning the city in single combat. In his new capacity he is sent on a mission to collect tribute from Moorish vassals to the Castilian crown. He asks that Ximena be given to him as his wife upon his return, so that he can provide for her. Ximena promises Count Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez she will marry him instead if he kills Rodrigo. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez lays an ambush for Rodrigo and his men but is captured by Al-Mu'tamin, to whom Rodrigo had earlier showed mercy. Rodrigo forgives the Count and returns home to marry Ximena. The marriage is not consummated: Rodrigo will not touch her if she does not give herself to him out of love. Ximena instead goes to a convent.\n\nKing Ferdinand dies and his younger son, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Prince Alfonso]] tells the elder son [[Sancho II of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Prince Sancho]] that their father wanted his kingdom divided between his heirs: Castile to Sancho, Asturias and Le\u00f3n to Alfonso, and Calahorra to their sister, [[Urraca of Zamora|Princess Urraca]]. Sancho refuses to accept anything but an undivided kingdom as his birthright. After Alfonso instigates a knife fight, Sancho overpowers his brother and sends him to be imprisoned in Zamora. Rodrigo, who swore to protect all the king\u2019s children, single-handedly defeats Alfonso's guards and brings the Prince to Calahorra. Sancho arrives to demand Alfonso, but Urraca refuses to hand him over. Rodrigo cannot take a side in the conflict, because his oath was to serve them all equally.\n\nBen Yusuf arrives at Valencia, the fortified city guarding the beach where he plans to land his armada. To weaken his Spanish opponents he hires Dolfos, a warrior formerly trusted by Ferdinand, to assassinate Sancho and throw suspicion for the crime on Alfonso, who becomes the sole king. At Alfonso's coronation, El Cid has him swear upon the Bible that he had no part in the death of his brother. Alfonso, genuinely innocent (although his ally Urraca was aware of the plot), is offended by the demand and banishes Rodrigo from Spain. Ximena discovers she still loves Rodrigo and voluntarily joins him in exile. Rodrigo makes his career as a soldier elsewhere in Spain, and he and Ximena have twin girls.\n\nYears later, Rodrigo, now known widely as \"El Cid\", is called back into the service of the king to protect Castile from Yusuf's North African army. However, Alfonso rejects an alliance with El Cid's Muslim friends, and rather than work directly with the king, El Cid allies himself with the emirs to besiege Valencia, where the cowardly Al-Kadir has violated his oath of allegiance to Rodrigo and come out in support of Ben Yusuf.\n\nAfter being defeated by the Moors at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]], Alfonso seizes Ximena and her children and puts them in prison. Count Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez rescues the three and brings them to Rodrigo, wanting to end his rivalry with El Cid and join him in the defense of Spain. Knowing that the citizens of Valencia are starving after the long siege, Rodrigo wins them over by throwing bread into the city with his catapults. Al-Kadir tries to intercede, but the Valencians kill him and open the gates to the besiegers. Emir Al-Mu'tamin, Rodrigo's army, and the Valencians offer the city's crown to El Cid,  but he refuses and instead sends the crown to King Alfonso.\n\nBen Yusuf arrives with his immense invasion army, and Valencia is the only barrier between him and Spain. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez is tortured and killed after being captured on a reconnaissance mission. The ensuing battle goes well for the defenders until El Cid is struck in the chest by an arrow and has to return to the city in plain sight of the Moorish army. Doctors inform him that they can probably remove the arrow and save his life, but he will be incapacitated for a long time after the surgery. Unwilling to abandon his army at this critical moment, Rodrigo obtains a promise from Ximena to leave the arrow and let him ride back into battle, dying or dead. King Alfonso comes to his bedside and asks for his forgiveness.\n\nRodrigo dies, and a rumor of his death spreads. His allies honor Rodrigo's final wish. With help of an iron frame they prop up his body, its eyes staring straight ahead. Dressed in full armor and holding an unfurled banner, he is strapped to the back of his horse, Babieca. Guided by King Alfonso and Emir Al-Mu'tamin riding on either side, the horse leads a mounted charge against Yusuf's now terrified soldiers, who believe that El Cid has risen from the dead. In the panic that ensues, Ben Yusuf is thrown from his horse and is crushed beneath Babieca's hooves, leaving his scattered army to be annihilated. King Alfonso leads Christians and Moors alike in a prayer for God to receive the soul \"of the purest knight of all\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as Don Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, [[El Cid]]\n* [[Sophia Loren]] as [[Ximena D\u00edaz|Do\u00f1a Ximena]]\n* [[Herbert Lom]] as [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin|Ben Yusuf]]\n* [[Raf Vallone]] as [[Garc\u00eda Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]]\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Page]] as [[Urraca of Zamora|Do\u00f1a Urraca]] (sister of Alfonso VI)\n* [[John Fraser (actor)|John Fraser]] as [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI]] (King of Castile)\n* [[Douglas Wilmer]] as [[Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud|Al-Mu'tamin]] (Emir of Zaragoza)\n* [[Frank Thring]] as [[Yahya al-Qadir|Al-Kadir]] (Emir of Valencia)\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as Don Diego (father of Rodrigo)\n* [[Andrew Cruickshank]] as Count Gormaz (father of Ximena)\n* [[Gary Raymond]] as Prince [[Sancho II of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Sancho]], the 1st born of King Ferdinand\n* [[Ralph Truman]] as [[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile|King Ferdinand]]\n* [[Massimo Serato]] as [[\u00c1lvar F\u00e1\u00f1ez|Fa\u00f1ez]] (nephew of Rodrigo)\n* [[Hurd Hatfield]], as Arias\n* [[Tullio Carminati]] as Al-Jarifi\n* [[Fausto Tozzi]] as Dolfos\n* [[Christopher Rhodes]] as Don Mart\u00edn\n* [[Carlo Giustini]] as Berm\u00fadez\n* [[G\u00e9rard Tichy]] as [[Ramiro I of Aragon|King Ramiro]]\n* [[Barbara Everest]] as Mother Superior\n* [[Nerio Bernardi]] as Soldier (Credited on film as Nelio Bernardi)\n* [[Franco Fantasia]] as Soldier\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn 1958, producer [[Samuel Bronston]] first considered filming ''El Cid'' prior to his work on ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'' (1961), but the production proved to be so troublesome that it would be set aside until ''King of Kings'' reached completion.<ref name=EpicFilms>{{cite book|last=Allen Smith|first=Gary|title=Epic Films: Casts, Credits, and Commentary on More Than 350 Historical Spectacle Movies|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihaBCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA76|year=2015|page=76|publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]]|isbn=978-1-476-60418-3|access-date=April 9, 2020|archive-date=April 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200409182747/https://books.google.com/books?id=ihaBCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA76|url-status=live|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> In April 1960, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' announced that Bronston was independently producing three films in Spain, one of which included ''El Cid''.

She then recommended hiring blacklisted screenwriter [[Ben Barzman]] to revise it. Mann subsequently got Barzman onto a plane to Rome, after which he gave him the current screenplay draft. Barzman read the draft and found it to be unusable.{{sfn|Martin|2007|pp=73\u201375}} With filming set to begin, Barzman received a copy of the tragicomedy play ''[[Le Cid]]'' by [[Pierre Corneille]] from the library of the French embassy in Madrid and used it as the basis for a new screenplay.{{sfn|Barzman|2003|pp=306\u2013313}}{{sfn|Martin|2007|pp=73\u201375}} Years later, in 1967, Mann told [[Bertrand Tavernier]] that \"not one line\" in the shooting script was written by Yordan.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Tavernier |first=Bertrand |title=Anthony Mann et 'Le Livre noir' |magazine=[[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]] |issue=186 |page=15 |date=January 1967 |language=French |url=https://archive.org/details/CahiersDuCinma/Cahiers%20du%20Cin%C3%A9ma/186/page/n14/mode/1up |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> However, Barzman's screen credit would not be added to the film until 1999.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=The Making of 'El Cid'|medium=DVD|year=2008|publisher=The Weinstein Company}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Barzman's script lacked powerful romantic scenes, which again displeased Loren. Screenwriter [[Bernard Gordon (writer)|Bernard Gordon]], who was also blacklisted, was hired to rewrite these scenes. He stated, \"So [Philip] Yordan yanked me from what I was doing in Paris and said, 'Write me three or four love scenes for Loren and Heston.' Well, what the hell \u2013 he was paying me $1500 a week, which was a lot more than I made any other way, and I just took orders and I sat down and I wrote four scenes, about three or four pages each.

The most expensive costume piece was a black-and-gold velvet robe worn by King Alfonso VI during the film, which was tailored in [[Florence]], Italy from materials specially woven in [[Venice]].

James Berardinelli of ''Reel Views'' gave the film three stars out of four. In his review, he felt that \"''El Cid'' turns more often to the ridiculous than the sublime. Perhaps if the movie didn't take itself so seriously, there wouldn't be opportunities for unintentional laughter, but, from the bombastic dialogue to the stentorian score, ''El Cid'' is about as self-important as a motion picture can be.
