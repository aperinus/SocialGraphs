In Uk the distribution company altered the order of the trilogy placing the second film as the first one.\n\nBelvaux referred in the DVD commentary that main idea behind ''Trilogy'' is that the main characters in a particular story are the secondary characters of others, in such sense the three films happen at the same time and share a series of common scenes and plot points, complementing each other, but also have their own perspective and style. The audience is left with piecing the films together, which Belvaux avoided, since editing the three films into one single narrative would have resulted in a very long film with no style of its own.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=September 2011}}\nOn a Friday evening, just before closing time Alain Coste is in his office and gets ready to leave, Claire, his [[personal assistant|PA]], manages to stall him a couple of minutes, he goes out and she steals his keys just before he comes back for his jacket. Claire calls C\u00e9cile Coste to report that Alain has left. Alain goes to see Georges Colinet, his physician who tells him that he has [[tennis elbow]] and must have an operation. Alain becomes very worried that this operation shall take his life despite all assurances to the contrary. Later on Alain goes to a park and he starts a series of [[Will (law)|will]] projects that he dictates in a pocket [[tape recorder]] that he carries around, the first will distributes his [[assets]] 50/50% to his wife and children, 98% of his company shall go to his children and the remaining 2% to Claire and some moneys that he has in a Swiss [[bank]]-account shall go to the Fund for [[Cancer]] Research.\n\nAt home C\u00e9cile is worried that Alain is not back yet and assumes that the worst has happened (which she does all the time). It is clear that she is preparing a surprise [[birthday]] party for Alain, her daughter Louise is there with her [[boyfriend]] Henry helping in the [[kitchen]]. Police lights are visible from the kitchen and C\u00e9cile goes to the door, but it is [[Police]] [[Inspector]] Pascal Manise who arrives to drop his wife Agn\u00e8s. The [[doorbell]] rings, it is [[physician|Dr.]] Colinet who arrives. In the meantime Alain is lost in his own [[neighbourhood]], he cannot find his [[house]] and comes close to having a car accident with Manise; when finally home he tells C\u00e9cile that he was late because he gave Claire a ride home. The party begins and R\u00e9my and Louise sing \"[[Les roses blanches]]\" to him instead of \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\". When Agn\u00e8s congratulates Alain she says \"''may you have more days like this''\", which he takes as a dark [[omen]]. Georges assures him that nothing is wrong with him and gives him back his [[key (lock)|key]]s to a [[chalet]] Alain owns in the nearby [[mountain]]s, which he used for a romantic escapade.\n\nWhen alone at the kitchen, C\u00e9cile confronts Alain and tells him that it is not true that he gave Claire a ride home and he then says that he actually had a car accident, as she is about to check out the car, Agn\u00e8s faints; Alain uses that opportunity to create the \"accident\" that he had, which means hitting his [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] with a [[hammer]]. Meanwhile, C\u00e9cile has reached Manise over the phone and tells him that Agn\u00e8s is sick. He arrives and takes her away. While waiting for Manise, C\u00e9cile sees that the car has not had the [[exhaust system|exhaust]] changed as Alain had said earlier.\n\nThe next day after a debate at [[school]], C\u00e9cile asks Pascal to tail Alain because he is hiding something from her. Manise tells her that it is preferable to be honest and ask her husband directly but she refuses. Meanwhile, in his office Alain has a sudden [[spasm]] and begins dictating his ever growing symptoms in his recorder, he leaves the office (which Claire reports to C\u00e9cile, who has been keeping a record of all his comings and goings) and goes to the [[park]] where he meets Louise, who tells her father that Henry dumped her because she cheated on him. Manise is close by and all he sees is that Alain is meeting with a younger woman, but when he reports it to C\u00e9cile she recognizes her daughter and is relieved that there is not another woman. At school Agn\u00e8s is very worried because Manise had to arrest Jeanne, a colleague [[teacher]] and [[friend]].\n\nManise asks C\u00e9cile to check the bank accounts for unusual charges, she does so despite Claire's warnings that Alain shall notice, they find nothing. During [[lunch]] Alain is designing several gadgets on a [[table mat]] and Manise is drinking coffee, he leaves the bar and says goodbye to everyone at the bar in a very French fashion which catches Alain's attention. Manise goes back to Alain's office and poses as a policeman from the financial branch, insinuating that Alain is involved in some questionable businesses, which Claire denies, however he manages to take a lock of Claire's [[hair]] without her noticing. On his way out he crosses Alain who is puzzled to see him again and asks Clair who he was and she says that he was a copying-machine representative. Alain sits at his desk and notices that things are not exactly where he left them and asks Claire to retrieve his [[newspaper]], which he forgot at the bar. When she leaves he redials the last phone and sees that Claire was not talking to her mother but to C\u00e9cile. He also notices that Manise is still outside and manages to shake his tail, then he rushes home turning the house upside down looking for something and finds C\u00e9cile's notes on him, he changes his will: nothing for C\u00e9cile or Claire, all for the children with a warning not to trust their [[mother]].\n\nThat night C\u00e9cile goes to Manise's place to confront him about scaring Claire, she does not know that Alain is following her. Manise however, notices that Alain is close by and makes it look as if C\u00e9cile is having an affair with him and asks her to take him to the [[police station]]. Manise also reveals that Agn\u00e8s is addicted to [[drugs]] and that the day of the [[party]] she fainted due to [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal syndrome]]. Before they can leave Alain is assaulted by thugs. Alain then goes to Claire's and forces a confession from her. Alain goes back home and tells C\u00e9cile that he must go to Paris for a couple of days.\n[[File:Tramway citadis grenoble.JPG|thumb|left|Grenoble's train station]]\nThe next day C\u00e9cile drops Alain at the [[train station]] but he comes out a few seconds later to take a [[taxicab|taxi]], however Manise is still tailing him. While in the taxi Alain changes his will again: the money for the Cancer Research is diminished. The [[taxicab driver|taxi driver]] tells Alain that he is being followed and manages to lose Manise again, but Manise finds the taxi driver and shows him his [[badge]]. Meanwhile, at the hospital Alain tells Georges about the person who is tailing him but Georges reassures him, Alain changes his will: the money for the Cancer Research fund is increased. As he gets an [[anesthetic]] shot from Georges' [[nurse]] who turns out to be the [[Sexual partner|lover]] that he took to the chalet, looks out the [[window]] and sees Manise talking to Dr. Colinet in the [[parking lot]]. He flees but no taxi shall take him.\n\nAs C\u00e9cile is about to enter the school where she works, Manise tells her that Alain did not take the [[train]] to [[Paris]] and ventures that he is probably in a [[hotel]] with someone else. C\u00e9cile goes to the school and finds that everyone is celebrating Jeanne's release from [[prison]]. Agn\u00e8s asks if she can borrow her car and if she can use the chalet, C\u00e9cile angrily accepts. Meanwhile, Alain has managed to get on the [[countryside]] by [[foot]] and calls for Claire to help him. When she arrives the anaesthetic has kicked in and Alain lies unconscious in the middle of the [[field (agriculture)|field]], Claire manages to wake him up. As they drive to the chalet Alain again drops asleep and drives off the [[road]] while drawing conclusions on the \"[[Conspiracy (crime)|plot]]\" against his life, he finally wakes up and steps out of the [[car]], he changes his will again: Claire gets her [[inheritance]] back. When backing up to the main road, Alain spots his wife's car with another car behind her. He follows and hears a man inside his chalet singing in Italian. He then assumes that his wife is connected to [[Italian Mafia|the Mafia]] and are plotting to kill him because of some of his inventions, Claire does not see the \"connection\". Meanwhile, Dr. Colinet has reported Alain's disappearance to Manise. Alain and Claire go to the police but see Manise and Dr. Colinet walking out of the station together and conclude that they are together in the plot with his wife.\n\nAlain and Claire go to their place, with Manise on their tail. She tells him that he must do something, but by then his [[paranoia]] has kicked in and he has begun adding up facts into a big scheme to kill him, which also involves his children, based on the song that they sang to him at his birthday and the changes that they made to fit him (the song involves the story of a poor boy who has to steal flowers for his dying mother in the hospital, only to find that when he finally arrives, she is already dead), Alain changes his will again: all goes to Claire. As they talk, enters Vincent, Claire's [[boyfriend]] and an [[employee]] of Alain's who is back home due to a [[working accident]], but Alain does not believe him since the [[Medical prescription|prescription]] is signed by Dr. Georges Colinet, thus Vincent is in the plot too. C\u00e9cile comes back home and finds that Louise has moved back in, when she discovers the reason (Louise had cheated on her boyfriend and he dumped her) she is so angry that she slaps her daughter and also draws a conclusion that Agn\u00e8s is the one having an [[affair]] with Alain. She picks Agn\u00e8s at the street and drives up to the chalet but finds that a man named Pierre is there and it seems that Agn\u00e8s' story is true. C\u00e9cile confronts Georges about the truth related to her husband's whereabouts but he does not betray anything and acts surprised when she tells him that Alain is not in Paris.\n\nAlain has interrogated Vincent and although he does not get a confession, he ties Vincent to Claire's bed. They go to Alain's place where he connects his recording machine to the telephone to spy on C\u00e9cile, he is discovered by Louise who then agrees to call him if anything strange happens related to C\u00e9cile. During this conversation it is revealed that the only reason that his children sang \"Les roses blanches\" to him is because he sang that song all the time regardless of the occasion, because it was the only one he knew.\n\nC\u00e9cile arrives home and has another [[fight]] with Louise. She [[spends]] the night crying and close to dawn Manise tells her that Alain is at Claire's. As they leave, C\u00e9cile notices that her car is gone but asks Manise not the release a police notice on it, she assumes that her daughter took it. They go to Claire's but cannot find Alain. As they leave, Claire asks Vincent to follow them, Manise notices it and beats Vincent, thinking he is one of a drug dealer's thugs who have been following him. Back in his car he tells C\u00e9cile that he is being [[blackmail]]ed by Agn\u00e8s' dealer, C\u00e9cile asks him to take her to her chalet, where she confronts Pierre, she believes that he is the [[drug dealer]], he tells her that Manise is a [[Domestic violence|wife beater]]. As they are about to leave, Manise tells C\u00e9cile that he is in love with her. She becomes very angry and slaps him and explodes with all her cruelty to him and leaves.\n\nMeanwhile, Alain is taking Vincent to the [[hospital]] but when he sees Dr. Colinet, he goes bezerk and crashes Vincent into the wall and beats Georges until the orderlies finally stop him. After he is restrained Alain gets a call from Louise, C\u00e9cile has not shown up for work, he calls the police, Manise goes back for C\u00e9cile and they go to her house. Alain finally reveals the reason for his secrecy and she is more at ease but not before she consults with Georges about the real gravity of his situation, a conversation that is spied by Alain through the window.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:tan;\" width=\"150\" | Actor\n! style=\"background-color:silver;\" width=\"200\" | Role\n|-\n| [[Ornella Muti]] || ''C\u00e9cile Coste, High school teacher''\n|-\n| [[Fran\u00e7ois Morel (actor)|Fran\u00e7ois Morel]] || ''Alain Coste, an inventor''\n|-\n| [[Val\u00e9rie Mairesse]] || ''Claire, Alain's [[personal assistant|PA]]''\n|-\n| [[Dominique Blanc]] || ''Agn\u00e8s Manise, High school teacher, wife of Inspector Manise''\n|-\n| [[Gilbert Melki]] || ''Pascal Manise, Police Inspector''\n|-\n| [[Lucas Belvaux]] || ''Bruno Le Roux, posing as Pierre, an unemployed bump''\n|-\n| [[Catherine Frot]] || ''Jeanne Rivet, [[High school]] teacher and friend of C\u00e9cile''\n|-\n| [[Yves Claessens]] || ''Freddy, a bar owner''\n|-\n| [[Bernard Mazzinghi]] || ''George, [[surgeon]] and friend of the Costes''\n|-\n| [[Rapha\u00eble Godin]] || ''Louise Coste''\n|-\n| [[Patrick Depeyrrat]] || ''Patrick''\n|-\n| [[Vincent Colombe]] || ''R\u00e9my Coste''\n|-\n| [[Pierre G\u00e9rard]] || ''Olivier''\n|-\n| [[Jean-Baptiste Montagut]] || ''Henri''\n|-\n| [[Anne Delol]] || [[Nurse]]\n|-\n| [[Joss Philop\u00e9mon]] || [[Taxicab|Taxi]] driver\n|}\n\n==Reception==\n\n[[A. O. Scott]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"And ''An Amazing Couple'' isn't either, exactly. The film's tableau of duplicity and innocent schemes gone awry is shadowed by the grim business of ''On the Run'' and the swelling pathos of ''After the Life.'' Some of the scenes are like mislaid puzzle pieces, and they snap into place only when all three movies have been seen and absorbed. This makes watching any one of the episodes both more interesting and more frustrating than it might otherwise be, since a portion of dramatic satisfaction is always withheld\".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2004-02-06|title=FILM IN REVIEW; 'The Trilogy' -- 'An Amazing Couple'\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/06/movies/film-in-review-the-trilogy-an-amazing-couple.html |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220227201624/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/06/movies/film-in-review-the-trilogy-an-amazing-couple.html |archive-date=2022-02-27|access-date=2022-02-27|website= [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> [[Desson Thomson]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated \"Bruno from the first movie.
