The film was the first of [[American International Pictures#List of Corman-Poe films|eight Corman/Poe feature films]] and stars [[Vincent Price]], [[Myrna Fahey]], [[Mark Damon]] and Harry Ellerbe.\n\nIn 2005, the film was listed with the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Adds 25 Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-05-262/librarian-of-congress-adds-25-films-to-national-film-registry-2/2005-12-20/|access-date=2020-10-30|website=Library of Congress, Washington, DC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-30|website=Library of Congress, Washington, DC}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nPhilip Winthrop ([[Mark Damon]]) travels to the House of Usher, a desolate mansion surrounded by a murky swamp, to see his fianc\u00e9e Madeline Usher ([[Myrna Fahey]]). Madeline's brother Roderick ([[Vincent Price]]) opposes Philip's intentions, telling the young man that the Usher family is afflicted by a cursed [[Heredity|bloodline]] which has driven all their ancestors to madness and even affected the mansion itself, causing the surrounding countryside to become desolate. Roderick foresees the family evils being propagated into future generations with a marriage to Madeline and vehemently discourages the union. Philip becomes increasingly desperate to take Madeline away; desperate to get away from her brother, she agrees to leave with him.\n\nDuring a heated argument with her brother, Madeline suddenly falls into [[catalepsy]], a condition in which its sufferers appear dead; her brother\u2014who knows that she is still alive\u2014convinces Winthrop that she is dead and rushes to have her entombed in the family [[crypt]] beneath the house. As Philip is preparing to leave following the entombment, the [[butler]], Bristol (Harry Ellerbe), lets slip that Madeline suffered from catalepsy.\n\nPhilip rips open Madeline's coffin and finds it empty. He desperately searches for her in the winding passages of the crypt but eventually collapses. Madeline revives inside her sealed coffin, goes insane from being buried alive, and breaks free. She confronts her brother and attacks him, throttling him to death. Suddenly the house, already aflame due to fallen coals from the fire, begins to collapse, and the two Ushers and Bristol are consumed by the falling house, ending the Usher bloodline. Philip alone escapes and watches the burning house sink into the swampy land surrounding it. The film ends with the final words of Poe's story: \"...&nbsp;and the deep and dank tarn closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the 'House of Usher'\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Roderick Usher\n* [[Mark Damon]] as Philip Winthrop\n* [[Myrna Fahey]] as Madeline Usher\n* Harry Ellerbe as Bristol\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=June 2019}}\nThe film was important in the history of [[American International Pictures]] which up until then had specialized in making low budget black and white films to go out on double bills.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> The market for this kind of movie was in decline so AIP decided to gamble on making a larger budgeted film in color.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\nThe film was announced in February 1959 and was dubbed the company's \"most ambitious film to date\".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Chase Still Critical Element in Comedy: Tempo and Crescendo Applied by Veteran Norman McLeod|author=Scheuer, Philip K.|date=Feb 13, 1959|work=Los Angeles Times|page=B7}}</ref>\n\nA number of other companies announced Poe projects around this time: Alex Gordon had a version of ''Masque of the Red Death'', Fox had ''Murders in the Rue Morgue'', Ben Bogeus ''The Gold Bug'', and Universal ''The Raven''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Poe Scenarists Tell a Sad Tale: Couple Working on 1 of 6 Films Being Adapted From Writer Encounter Pitfalls|author=Murray Schumach |date=Aug 21, 1959|work=New York Times|page=12}}</ref>\n\nIt was shot in 15 days.{{sfn|Eagan|2021|page=565}} The budget was $300,000, $100,000 of which went to star Vincent Price.{{sfn|Eagan|2021|page=565}} Production designer Daniel Haller purchased sets and props from Universal Studios for $2,500 and redressed them to create the Usher mansion.{{sfn|Eagan|2021|pages=565-566}} The misshapen trees seen on the Usher estate were actual trees which had burned in a fire in the Hollywood Hills.{{sfn|Eagan|2021|page=566}} To depict the burning manse, Corman had two cameramen film the burning of a barn in Orange County.{{sfn|Eagan|2021|page=566}}\n\n''House of Usher'' made $1 million in the summer of 1960.{{sfn|Eagan|2021|page=566}}\n\n==Score==\nIn February 2011 Intrada made the world premiere release of the [[Les Baxter]] score from music-only elements in mono.<ref>[http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.6926/.f CD-page on Intrada's site]</ref><ref>[http://www.intrada.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=47528#p47528 Official announcement]</ref>\n{{Track listing\n|title1 = Overture\n|length1 = 3:03\n|title2 = Main Title\n|length2 = 2:00\n|title3 = Roderick Usher\n|length3 = 4:02\n|title4 = Madeline Usher\n|length4 = 2:50\n|title5 = Tormented\n|length5 = 2:24\n|title6 = Lute Song\n|length6 = 1:00\n|title7 = Reluctance\n|length7 = 3:58\n|title8 = The Sleepwalker\n|length8 = 4:12\n|title9 = The Vault\n|length9 = 2:36\n|title10 = The Ancestors\n|length10 = 2:58\n|title11 = House of Evil\n|length11 = 4:53\n|title12 = Catalepsy\n|length12 = 4:13\n|title13 = Pallbearers\n|length13 = 2:03\n|title14 = Buried Alive\n|length14 = 8:14\n|title15 = Fall of The House of Usher\n|length15 = 13:50\n|total_length = 1:02:16\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nEugene Archer, in the September 15, 1960 edition of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"[[American International Pictures|American-International]], with good intentions of presenting a faithful adaption of Edgar Allan Poe's classic tale of the macabre...blithely ignored the author's style.
