As with the first film, ''Bride of Frankenstein'' was directed by [[James Whale]] starring [[Boris Karloff]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|the Monster]] and [[Colin Clive]] as Dr. Frankenstein.<ref name=\"Bride of Frankenstein\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69663/Bride-of-Frankenstein/|title=Bride of Frankenstein|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=15 March 2016}}</ref> The sequel features [[Elsa Lanchester]] in the dual role of [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|the titular character]] at the end of the film. [[Colin Clive]] reprises his role as [[Victor Frankenstein|Henry Frankenstein]], and [[Ernest Thesiger]] plays the role of [[Doctor Septimus Pretorius]].\n\nTaking place immediately after the events of the earlier film, it is rooted in a subplot of the original [[Mary Shelley]] novel, ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'' (1818). Its plot follows a chastened Henry Frankenstein as he attempts to abandon his plans to create life, only to be tempted and finally [[blackmailed]] by his old mentor Dr. Pretorius, along with threats from the Monster, into constructing a [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|mate]] for the Monster.\n\nThe preparation to film the sequel began shortly after the premiere of the first film, but script problems delayed the project. [[Principal photography]] began in January 1935, with creative personnel from the original returning in front of and behind the camera. ''Bride of Frankenstein'' was released to critical and popular acclaim, although it encountered difficulties with some state and national censorship boards. Since its release the film's reputation has grown, and it is now frequently considered one of the greatest sequels ever made; many fans and critics consider it to be an improvement on the original, and it has been hailed as Whale's [[masterpiece]]. In 1998, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]], having been deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn a castle on a stormy night, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] praise [[Mary Shelley]] for her story of Frankenstein and his Monster. She reminds them that her intention for writing the novel was to impart a moral lesson, the consequences of a mortal man who tries to [[wikt:play God|play God]]. Mary says she has more of the story to tell. The scene shifts to the end of the 1931 ''Frankenstein'', in 1899.\n\nVillagers gathered around the burning windmill cheer the apparent death of the Monster. Hans, the father of the girl the creature drowned in the previous film, wants to see the Monster's bones. He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster\u2014having survived the fire\u2014strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans' wife to her death. He next encounters Frankenstein's servant Minnie, who flees in terror.\n\nThe body of [[Victor Frankenstein|Henry Frankenstein]], who is thought to have died at the windmill, is returned to his fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth at his ancestral castle home. Minnie arrives to sound the alarm about the Monster, but her warning goes unheeded. Elizabeth, seeing Henry move, realizes he is still alive. Nursed back to health by Elizabeth, Henry has renounced his creation, but still believes he may be destined to unlock the secret of life and immortality. A hysterical Elizabeth cries that she foresees death.\n\nHenry visits the lab of his former mentor [[Doctor Septimus Pretorius]], where Pretorius shows Henry several [[Homunculus|homunculi]] he has created. Pretorius wishes to work with Henry to create a mate for the Monster, with the proposed venture involving Pretorius growing an artificial brain while Henry gathers parts for the mate.\n\nThe Monster saves a young shepherdess from drowning. Her screams upon seeing him alert two hunters, who shoot and injure the Monster. The hunters raise a mob that sets out in pursuit. Captured and trussed to a pole, the Monster is hauled to a dungeon and chained. Left alone, he breaks his chains, overpowers the guards, and escapes into the woods.\n\nThat night, following the sound of a violin playing \"[[Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)|Ave Maria]]\", the Monster encounters an old blind [[hermit]] who thanks God for sending him a friend. He teaches the monster words like \"friend\" and \"good\" and shares a meal with him. Two lost hunters stumble upon the cottage and recognize the Monster. He attacks them and accidentally burns down the cottage as the hunters lead the hermit away.\n\nTaking refuge from another angry mob in a crypt, the Monster spies Pretorius and his cronies Karl and Ludwig breaking open a grave. The henchmen depart as Pretorius stays to enjoy a light supper. The Monster approaches Pretorius, eats some of his food, and learns that Pretorius plans to create a mate for him.\n\nHenry and Elizabeth, now married, are visited by Pretorius. When Henry expresses his refusal to assist with Pretorius' plans, Pretorius calls in the Monster, who demands Henry's help. Henry again refuses, and Pretorius orders the Monster out, secretly signaling him to kidnap Elizabeth. Pretorius guarantees her safe return upon Henry's participation. Henry returns to his tower laboratory where, despite himself, he grows excited over his work. After being assured of Elizabeth's safety, Henry completes the [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Bride]]'s body.\n\nA storm rages as final preparations are made to bring the Bride to life. Her bandage-wrapped body is raised through the roof, where electricity is harnessed from lightning to animate her. Henry and Pretorius lower her and, after realizing their success in bringing her to life, remove her bandages and help her to stand.\n\nThe Monster comes down the steps after killing Karl on the rooftop and sees his mate. The excited Monster reaches out to her and asks: \"Friend?\" The Bride, screaming, rejects him. The dejected Monster observes: \"She hate me! Like others\". As Elizabeth races to Henry's side, the Monster rampages through the laboratory. When Pretorius warns that the Monster's actions are about to destroy them all, the Monster pauses and tells Henry and Elizabeth: \"Go! You live! Go!\" To Pretorius and the Bride, he says: \"You stay. We belong dead\". While Henry and Elizabeth flee, the Monster looks at the Bride who hisses at him. Shedding a tear, he pulls a lever to trigger the laboratory and tower's destruction. \n\n==Cast and Characters==\n[[File:Bride of Frankenstein (1935) poster 1.jpg|right|thumb|Lobby card for re-release of ''Bride of Frankenstein'' with [[Douglas Walton (actor)|Douglas Walton]] as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], Lanchester as [[Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley]] and [[Gavin Gordon (actor)|Gavin Gordon]] as [[Lord Byron]].]]\n\n[[File: Bride of Frankenstein trailer (1935).webm|thumb|thumbtime=3|upright=1.3| '''PLAY''' 1935 [[trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for ''Bride of Frankenstein'']] \n\n{{div col}}\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster]], Henry's creation who tries to find a friend whilst being chased by the villagers and also learning how to speak clear sentences.

The script passed its review, but Whale, who by then had been contracted to direct, complained that \"it stinks to heaven\".<ref>Curtis, p. 134</ref> [[Lawrence Blochman|L. G. Blochman]] and [[Philip MacDonald]] were the next writers assigned, but Whale also found their work unsatisfactory. In 1934, Whale set [[John L. Balderston]] to work on yet another version, and it was he who returned to an incident from the novel in which the creature demands a mate. In the novel Frankenstein creates a mate, but destroys it without bringing it to life. Balderston also created the Mary Shelley prologue. After several months Whale was still not satisfied with Balderston's work and handed the project to playwright William J. Hurlbut<!--read [[WP:REDLINK]] before unlinking William J. Hurlbut who is credited with writing some 37 plays and therefore a potential article.--> and [[Edmund Pearson]]. The final script, combining elements of a number of these versions, was submitted for Hays office review in November 1934.<ref>Curtis, pp. 234\u201336</ref> [[Kim Newman]] reports that Whale planned to make Elizabeth the heart donor for the bride,<ref name = newman>{{cite news|author=Newman, Kim|title=Rewind Masterpiece #18|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=December 2004|page=181|author-link=Kim Newman}}</ref> but film historian Scott MacQueen states that Whale never had such an intention.<ref name = dvd />\n\nSources report that [[Bela Lugosi]] and [[Claude Rains]] were considered, with varying degrees of seriousness, for the role of Frankenstein's mentor, Pretorius;<ref>Lennig, p. 92</ref> others report that the role was created specifically for Ernest Thesiger.<ref name = skal185>Skal, p. 185</ref> Because of [[Mae Clarke]]'s ill health, [[Valerie Hobson]] replaced her as Henry Frankenstein's love interest, Elizabeth.<ref name = dvd /> Early in production, Whale decided that the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film's prologue, to represent how the story \u2014 and horror in general \u2014 springs from the dark side of the imagination.<ref name=vieira82>Vieira, p. 82</ref> He considered [[Brigitte Helm]] and [[Phyllis Brooks]] before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband [[Charles Laughton]] to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success while Laughton had made a strong impact with several films including ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'' (for which he had won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]) and Whale's own ''[[The Old Dark House (1932 film)|The Old Dark House]]''. Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role.<ref name=lanchester>Curtis, pp. 243\u201344</ref> Lanchester modeled the Bride's hissing on the hissing of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while filming the hissing sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.<ref name=vieira86>Vieira, p. 86</ref>\n\nColin Clive and Boris Karloff reprised their roles from ''Frankenstein'' as creator and creation, respectively. Hobson recalled Clive's alcoholism had worsened since filming the original, but Whale did not recast the role because his \"hysterical quality\" was necessary for the film.<ref name=vieira82/> Karloff strongly objected to the decision to allow the Monster to speak: \"Speech! Stupid! My argument was that if the monster had any impact or charm, it was because he was inarticulate \u2013 this great, lumbering, inarticulate creature. The moment he spoke you might as well ... play it straight\".<ref name = gifford55>Gifford, p. 55</ref> This decision also meant that Karloff could not remove his dental plate, so now his cheeks did not have the sunken look of the original film.<ref name = dvd /> Whale and the studio psychiatrist selected 44 simple words for the Monster's vocabulary by looking at test papers of ten-year-olds working at the studio.<ref name=vieira80/> Dwight Frye returned to play the doctor's assistant, Karl, having played the hunchback Fritz in the original. Frye also filmed a scene as an unnamed villager and the role of \"Nephew Glutz\", a man who murdered his uncle and blamed the death on the Monster.<ref name = dvd /> Boris Karloff is credited simply as KARLOFF, which was Universal's custom during the height of his career.<ref name = curtis237 /> Elsa Lanchester is credited for Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, but in a nod to the earlier film, the Monster's bride is credited only as \"?\" just as Boris Karloff had been in the opening credits of ''Frankenstein''.\n\n[[File:Brideoffrankenstein.jpg|thumb|261px|right|alt=The Bride of Frankenstein has black hair with a white streak running through it, is dressed in a white gown, and has a blank expression.

Whale told him: \"Nothing will be resolved in this picture except the end destruction scene. Would you write an unresolved score for it?\"<ref name=vieira86/> Waxman created three distinctive themes: one for the Monster; one for the Bride; and one for Pretorius. The score closes, at Whale's suggestion, with a powerful dissonant chord, intended to convey the idea that the on-screen explosion was so powerful that the theater where the film was being screened was affected by it.<ref>Curtis, p. 246</ref> Constantin Bakaleinikoff conducted 22 musicians to record the score in a single nine-hour session.<ref>Curtis, p. 249</ref>\n\nShooting began on January 2, 1935,<ref name = mank>Mank, p. xvii</ref> with a projected budget of US$293,750 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|293750|1935|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTISOYEAR}})&nbsp;\u2013 almost exactly the budget of the original \u2013 and an estimated 36-day shooting schedule.{{Inflation-fn|US}}<ref>Curtis, p. 241</ref> On the first day, Karloff waded in the water below the destroyed windmill wearing a rubber suit under his costume.

He continued to object to such dialogue in revised scripts,<ref name = skal18791>Skal, pp. 187\u201391</ref> and to a planned shot of the Monster rushing through a graveyard to a figure of a crucified Jesus and attempting to rescue the figure from the cross.<ref>Curtis, p. 247</ref> Breen also objected to the number of murders, both seen and implied by the script and strongly advised Whale to reduce the number.<ref name = dvd /> The censor's office, upon reviewing the film in March 1935, required a number of cuts. Whale agreed to delete a sequence in which Dwight Frye's \"Nephew Glutz\"<ref name = dvd /> kills his uncle and blames the Monster,<ref name = curtis250>Curtis, p. 250</ref> and shots of Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley in which Breen felt too much of her breasts were visible.

Horror scholar [[David J. Skal]] suggests that Whale's intention was to make a \"direct comparison of Frankenstein's monster to Christ\".<ref>Skal. p. 189</ref> Film scholar Scott MacQueen, noting Whale's lack of any religious convictions, disputes the notion that the Monster is a Christ-figure. Rather, the Monster is a \"mockery of the divine\" since, having been created by Man rather than God, it \"lacks the divine spark\". In crucifying the Monster, he says, Whale \"pushes the audience's buttons\" by inverting the central Christian belief of the death of Christ followed by the resurrection.

Director James Whale was openly gay, and some of the actors in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and, according to rumor, Colin Clive, were respectively gay or [[bisexual]].<ref name=Bright>{{cite journal| last =Morris| first =Gary| title =Sexual Subversion: The Bride of Frankenstein| journal =[[Bright Lights Film Journal]]| issue =19| date =July 1997| url =http://brightlightsfilm.com/sexual-subversion-bride-frankenstein/| access-date =January 7, 2008}}</ref> Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective,<ref name=\"Curtis, p. 144\">Curtis, p. 144</ref> scholars have perceived a gay [[subtext]] suffused through the film, especially a [[Camp (style)|camp]] sensibility,<ref>Skal, p. 184</ref> particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.\n\nGay film historian [[Vito Russo]], in considering Pretorius, stops short of identifying the character as gay, instead referring to him as \"[[sissy|sissified]]\",<ref>Russo, p. 50</ref> \"sissy\" itself being Hollywood code for \"homosexual\". Pretorius serves as a \"gay [[Mephistopheles]]\",<ref name = skal185 /> a figure of seduction and temptation, going so far as to pull Frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in the unnatural act of creating non-procreative life. A novelization of the film published in the United Kingdom made the implication clear, having Pretorius say to Frankenstein: \"Be fruitful and multiply. Let us obey the Biblical injunction: you of course, have the choice of natural means; but as for me, I am afraid that there is no course open to me but the scientific way\".<ref>Egremont, Michael, quoted in Skal, p. 189</ref>\n\nThe Monster, whose affections for the male hermit and the female Bride he discusses with identical language (\"friend\") has been read as sexually \"unsettled\" and bisexual.<ref name = Bright /> Gender studies author Elizabeth Young writes: \"He has no innate understanding that the male-female bond he is to forge with the bride is assumed to be the primary one or that it carries a different sexual valence from his relationships with [Pretorius and the hermit]: all affective relationships are as easily 'friendships' as 'marriages'\".<ref>Young, p. 134</ref> Indeed, his relationship with the hermit has been interpreted as a [[same-sex marriage]] that heterosexual society will not tolerate: \"No mistake \u2013 this is a marriage, and a viable one ... But Whale reminds us quickly that society does not approve. The monster \u2013 the outsider \u2013 is driven from his scene of domestic pleasure by two gun-toting rubes who happen upon this startling alliance and quickly, instinctively, proceed to destroy it\", writes cultural critic Gary Morris for ''Bright Lights Film Journal''.<ref name = Bright /> The creation of the Bride scene, Morris continues, is \"Whale's reminder to the audience \u2013 his Hollywood bosses, peers, and everyone watching \u2013 of the majesty and power of the homosexual creator\".<ref name = Bright />\n\nFilmmaker [[Curtis Harrington]], a friend and confidant of Whale's, dismissed this as \"a younger critic's evaluation.
