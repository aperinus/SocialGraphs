The screenplay by [[Harold Pinter]] is an adaptation of [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]]'s play, ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]''. Caine had previously starred in a [[Sleuth (1972 film)|1972 version]], where he played Law's role against [[Laurence Olivier]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nTwo extremely clever British men are in a game of trickery and deceit. Andrew Wyke, an aging famous author who lives alone in a high-tech mansion, after his wife Maggie has left him for a younger man; and Milo Tindle, an aspiring actor, equipped with charm and wit, who demonstrates both qualities once again. When Wyke invites Tindle to his mansion, Tindle seeks to convince the former into letting his wife go by signing the divorce paper. However, Wyke seems far more interested in playing mind games with his wife's new lover, and lures him into a series of actions he thoroughly planned in seeking revenge on his unfaithful spouse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Andrew Wyke\n* [[Jude Law]] as Milo Tindle\n\nThe film's screenwriter, [[Harold Pinter]], credited as \"Man on TV\", is seen on a television in the background interviewing another man, played by an uncredited [[Kenneth Branagh]]. The only other person seen in the film is an uncredited actress, [[Carmel O'Sullivan]], in the role of Maggie.\n\n==Production==\nCaine had starred as hairdresser Milo Tindle opposite [[Laurence Olivier]]'s novelist Andrew Wyke in the 1972 film ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'', with each being nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for their performance. In the 2007 film, Caine took the role of Wyke, and Law took Caine's role of Tindle.<ref name=AMG>Jason Buchanan, [http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=360769 \"Sleuth\"] plot summary at [[Allmovie]], rpt. in ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Retrieved 7 October 2007.</ref> Dargis wrote that she did not like watching the film, finding it too claustrophobic: \"Mr. Branagh fiddles with the lights, tilts the camera and hustles his hard-working actors upstairs and down and back again and into an elevator as small as a coffin built for one. He embellishes the screenplay\u2019s every obvious conceit and word, hammering the point until you feel as if you\u2019re trapped inside the elevator with Milo and Andrew, going up and down and up and down, though nowhere in particular.\"\n\nIn his interview with Martin A. Grove, Branagh mentions that the danger of inducing [[claustrophobia]] in audience members is a risk that he took into account in filming ''Sleuth'': \"What Branagh didn't do that many Hollywood directors would have done is to open the film up by, for instance, having the two men drive to a nearby pub at some point in their conversation. 'Well, it's interesting you say that,' he told [Grove], 'There were discussions about that, but we said, 'If we believe in the power of the writing here and the power of the performances, but also, frankly, if we believe in the audience and believe that the audience can find this as fascinating as I do on the pages and if we can realize it to meet all of their expectations then the claustrophobia (won't be a problem).'&nbsp;\"\n\n===The House===\nDirector Branagh found shooting in the house difficult yet interesting. \"The minimalism I found was a great challenge.
