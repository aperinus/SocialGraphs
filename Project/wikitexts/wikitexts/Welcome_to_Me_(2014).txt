The film stars [[Kristen Wiig]] as Alice Klieg, a lottery winner with [[borderline personality disorder]] who uses her newfound wealth to write and star in her own syndicated talk show. The cast includes [[James Marsden]], [[Linda Cardellini]] and [[Wes Bentley]]. The film was  released on May 1, 2015 in a [[limited release]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcometomemovie.com |title=Welcome To Me \u2013 Official Site |publisher=Welcometomemovie.com |date= |access-date=2015-04-30}}</ref> receiving generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nAlice Klieg, a [[mentally ill]] single woman living on [[disability benefit]]s, and fan of [[Oprah Winfrey]], wins the ''California Stack Sweepstakes'' lottery jackpot of $86 million. She appears on the local TV news celebrating her win, but is upset when the speech she had prepared is abruptly cut off after she mentions using masturbation as a sedative. She discontinues her medication, against the advice of her psychiatrist, Daryl Moffat, and moves into a casino hotel with her best friend Gina Selway.\n\nDuring a vitamin supplement [[infomercial]] presented by Gabe Ruskin, Alice, who is in the studio audience, responds to his request for a volunteer, hijacks the broadcast and tries to recite her speech once again (although is again cut off by the director). Gabe's brother Rich, the co-owner and manager of the studio, introduces himself and arranges a meeting to discuss Alice's idea for a TV show, at which Alice writes a check for $15 million to pay for 100 live-broadcast two-hour episodes of a [[Vanity press|vanity]] show about herself entitled ''Welcome to Me''.\n\nGabe is nonplussed over the show's aimless premise, but after Alice takes him on a date, they promptly have sex and begin a relationship. During the first episode: Alice announces that she has given up her medication, includes a silent five-minute segment of her eating meatloaf cake with mashed sweet potato icing, and a live re-enactment of a scene from her past (with actors wearing name-cards playing herself and a friend who had betrayed her in high school).\n\nAfter seeing a recording, Alice decides the show looks too inexpensive and writes another check to bring the production values more in line with ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. The studio set is revamped to include a rotating stage and a replica of her house.\n\nAs the show grows in popularity, her friends and family become alienated by her non-flattering depictions of them in her sketches. Rainer Ybarra, a graduate student and fan of the show, interviews Alice about her rising stardom, and the two go on a date which ends with her [[Fellatio|fellating]] him in her limousine. Their tryst is revealed on air, much to Gabe's fury.\n\nWhile recovering from burns sustained in a cooking accident on the show, Alice decides to introduce a new theme of neutering dogs on the show, utilizing her six years' experience as a veterinary nurse. Fed up with her volatility, Gabe finally quits.\n\nRich continues to support Alice's decisions until he and the studio are threatened with various lawsuits including slander and health code violations. Rich angrily interrupts the show, demanding that Alice should cancel the veterinary procedures. Alice abandons the broadcast 40 minutes early, cancels her show and settles the lawsuits, leaving her with $7 million.\n\nAlice suffers a nervous breakdown, walking naked through the main floor of the casino. She is hospitalized and resumes her medication. After being released, she apologizes to Dr. Moffat and contacts Rich to arrange a final episode of ''Welcome to Me''. She invites her family and Gina to the broadcast, a lavish [[telethon]] aimed at finding owners for her dogs which she has neutered, along with making amends to everyone she has wronged. In the show's last moments, Alice gives a heartfelt apology to Gina and praises her for her patience, presenting her with a check for the remaining $7 million of her lottery winnings.\n\nHer life now back to normal, Gabe takes Alice home and gives her a camcorder as a gift. When she goes to bed, she finally turns off her television that she had left switched on continuously for over 11 years.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Alice Klieg\n* [[Wes Bentley]] as Gabe Ruskin\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Gina Selway\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Dawn Hurley\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Barb Vaughn \n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Deb Moseley\n* [[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]] as Rainer Ybarra\n* [[James Marsden]] as Rich Ruskin\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Dr. Daryl Moffat\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Ted Thurber\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Welcome to Me \"VOICE AWARDS-2015\" (21416963009).jpg|thumb|left|Eliot Laurence, writer of the film, is joined by the film's director, Shira Piven, on stage in 2015.]]\nOn March 20, 2013, [[Kristen Wiig]] was in talks to join the cast of the film and re-team with ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]'' cohorts Will Ferrell and [[Adam McKay]], who produced.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kristen Wiig to Reteam With Will Ferrell on Indie 'Welcome to Me'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kristen-wiig-reteam-will-ferrell-430133|access-date=6 August 2013|newspaper=hollywoodreporter.com|date=20 March 2013}}</ref> On May 21, 2013, it was announced that Wiig had signed to star in the film.<ref name=Wiig>{{cite news|title=Kristen Wiig to star in Will Ferrell-produced comedy 'Welcome to Me'|url=http://www.hitfix.com/news/kristen-wiig-to-star-in-will-ferrell-produced-comedy-welcome-to-me|access-date=6 August 2013|newspaper=hitfix.com|date=21 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kristen Wiig Confirmed for Welcome to Me|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/kristen-wiig-confirmed-for-welcome-to-me|access-date=6 August 2013|newspaper=movieweb.com|date=21 May 2013}}</ref> On July 16, 2013, more actors were added to the cast including [[Linda Cardellini]], [[Tim Robbins]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]].<ref name=Linda>{{cite news|title=Linda Cardellini, Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Leigh Join Kristen Wiig Film|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/linda-cardellini-tim-robbins-and-jennifer-jason-leigh-welcome-to-me-1200563687/|access-date=6 August 2013|newspaper=variety.com|date=16 July 2013}}</ref> On July 29, 2013, four more actors were added to the cast, [[Wes Bentley]], [[James Marsden]], [[Joan Cusack]], and [[Alan Tudyk]].<ref name=Wes>{{cite news|title=Kristen Wiig-Starrer 'Welcome To Me' Adds Four To Cast As Production Kicks Off|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/07/kristen-wiig-starrer-welcome-to-me-adds-four-to-cast-as-production-kicks-off/|access-date=6 August 2013|newspaper=deadline.com|date=29 July 2013}}</ref> On December 3, 2014, [[Millennium Entertainment]] acquired the American distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lesnick|first1=Silas|title=Millennium Entertainment Takes Welcome to Me, Starring Kristen Wiig|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/388651-millennium-entertainment-takes-welcome-to-me-starring-kristen-wiig|access-date=December 4, 2014|publisher=comingsoon.net|date=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in July 2013 in [[Los Angeles]] and filming mostly in [[Greater Los Angeles Area]].
