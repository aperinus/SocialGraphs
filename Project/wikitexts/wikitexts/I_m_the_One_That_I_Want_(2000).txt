The film captures a live performance of a one-woman show of stand-up comedy, featuring actress and comedian [[Margaret Cho]].\n\n== Premise ==\nThe film combines elements of storytelling and stand-up. It showcases Cho's unique style of sexually blunt monologue performance. The primary focus of the material is on Cho's ascension into stardom and her struggles with weight, drug addiction and sexual promiscuity. Cho also addresses her failed sitcom ''[[All-American Girl (TV series)|All American Girl]]'', racism, homophobia and other challenges.\n\n== Production notes ==\nThe performance was filmed at the Warfield Theater in [[San Francisco]] on November 13, 1999. The movie was almost universally praised by critics, and it garnered favorable comparisons to the work of comedians like [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Lenny Bruce]].\n\n== Book, CD, DVD and VHS ==\nA book of the same name was also released, as well as a compact disc. The CD is a live audio recording of the same performance at the Warfield Theater. There is also a CD version of the book available, and it is read by Cho. The concert film was released on DVD and VHS on October 9, 2001 by Winstar Home Video.<ref>{{cite web|author=Holly J.
