Huey, Dewey and Louie wake up Chip and Dale one Christmas morning and then go downstairs to open their presents, even though they are supposed to wait for Daisy, Uncle Scrooge and Aunt Gertie to arrive. The boys then take their new sleds from Uncle Donald (not reading the included card) and go sledding before having Christmas dinner, where Donald yells at them to learn some manners. While Donald, Daisy, Uncle Scrooge and Aunt Gertie sing carols, the boys play with their new toys.\n\nLater, it is time to go to bed and having enjoyed the day immensely, the boys wish for it to be Christmas every day. Their wish is granted and at first they are joyful. After a few days however, they begin to get tired of Christmas and realize that every day will be exactly the same. They decide to change the course of action of the next day by playing tricks and pranks, including swapping the cooked turkey with a live one at dinner. It turns out to be a terrible Christmas for everyone, especially Donald.\n\nShortly after, the boys read the card that was given to them earlier by Donald and Daisy. The card wishes them love and explains that Christmas is not just about presents, it is also about being with family. The boys feel guilty and decide to make amends by making the next day the best Christmas ever. As the boys spread love and cheer by giving Aunt Gertie kisses and helping Daisy with dinner, Donald becomes suspicious. Whilst singing carols, Donald confronts the boys, demanding to know what they are up to. An outraged Daisy snaps at Donald, accusing him of spoiling a perfect Christmas. Huey, however, admits that Donald was right and that he and his brothers forgot something. Huey, Dewey and Louie pull out their gift for Uncle Donald - a sail boat made out of their sleds. Genuinely surprised, embarrassed & touched, Donald thanks his nephews with a warm hug. At the end of the next day, the boys finally realize the true meaning of Christmas and the time loop ends, leading into the day after Christmas.\n\n===A Very Goofy Christmas===\n[[Goofy]] and Max are mailing a letter to [[Santa Claus]]. However, as soon as they get home, their neighbour Pete tells Max that Santa does not exist, saying it is impossible that he cannot fly around the world in one night. Things get worse when Goofy poses as Santa for some kids and Max finds out that he tricked him. Goofy is determined to prove to Max that Santa does exist and stays up all Christmas Eve to keep an eye out for him while Max, still bitter, just wants to move on. After mistaking a Beagle Boy (who was robbing Pete's house) for Santa, Goofy eventually gives up hope of Santa coming. Max then does everything that Goofy did, to try and make him happy, including posing as (a very small) Santa himself. In the end, the real Santa actually comes and gives Max the gift he had asked for earlier (as well as burying Pete's house next door, in snow). When Max asks Goofy if Santa forgot his present, Goofy answers that every year he asks for the same thing - Max's happiness.\n\nThis segment of ''Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas'' chronologically precedes the cartoon series, ''[[Goof Troop]]''. Max is voiced by [[Shaun Fleming]].\n\n===Mickey and Minnie's Gift of the Magi===\nBased on the 1905 short story \"[[The Gift of the Magi]]\" by [[O. Henry]]. Mickey wants to get Minnie a gold chain for her one heirloom, her watch, so he works at Crazy Pete's Tree Lot. Minnie wants to give Mickey something special for Christmas as well, so she works hard at her job in a department store to get a bonus to buy a present with. When Mickey offers a small tree to a poor family who can't afford to buy a special 10-footer tree, his greedy boss Pete, steals all of Mickey's money and sacks him. Pete then accidentally puts his lit cigar into his pocket with Mickey's money without noticing, which sets himself, the money and his trees-(including the 10-footers, much to Pete's dismay) on fire. Meanwhile, Minnie's bonus from her stingy boss [[Mortimer Mouse]] proves to be nothing but a [[fruit cake]]. After playing music for a toy drive with the [[Firehouse Five Plus Two|Firehouse Five]], Mickey has the idea that he can trade his [[harmonica]] for the gold chain. The shop is closing when he gets there and the owner who is just leaving isn't interested in the harmonica, but changes his mind after hearing Mickey play it. Back at Minnie's house, Mickey gives her the chain for her watch, which she no longer has and Minnie gives him a case for his harmonica, which he also no longer has. However, Mickey and Minnie are still able to celebrate a merry Christmas. As in ''The Gift of the Magi'' original story, the thought behind each gift is what counts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blockbusteronline.com/movies/mickeys-once-upon-a-christmas.html|title=Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas (1999)|website=Blockbuster Online|publisher=[[Blockbuster LLC]]|access-date=December 30, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120722085639/http://www.blockbusteronline.com/movies/mickeys-once-upon-a-christmas.html|archive-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Finale===\nThe film concludes with a medley of various songs, \"[[Jingle Bells]]\", \"[[Deck the Halls]]\" and \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\", featuring the main characters from the three segments.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Wayne Allwine]] as [[Mickey Mouse]]\n* [[Russi Taylor]] as [[Minnie Mouse]], Huey Duck, Dewey Duck and Louie Duck\n* [[Tony Anselmo]] as [[Donald Duck]]\n* [[Diane Michelle]] as [[Daisy Duck]] (The Gift of the Magi)\n* [[Tress MacNeille]] as Daisy Duck (Stuck on Christmas, singing voice in the finale), Chip and Aunt Gertie\n* [[Alan Young]] as [[Scrooge McDuck]]\n* [[Bill Farmer]] as [[Goofy]], [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], [[Horace Horsecollar]]\n* [[Corey Burton]] as [[Chip 'n' Dale|Dale]]\n* [[Shaun Fleming]] as [[Max Goof]]\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]], Police, Mailman, Fire Chief, Dad, onlooker, shop owner, and [[Santa Claus]]\n* [[Jeff Bennett]] as Dad Firefighter #2, Mortimer Mouse, Store Announcer, Man and Costumer\n* [[Gregg Berger]] as Mr Anderson, and Shopper\n* Kylie Dempsey as Kid #2, and Little Girl\n* Taylor Dempsey as Little Jimmy, and Kid #1\n* Andrew McDonaugh as Boy\n* [[Pat Musick]] as Distressed Woman, Angry Woman, Eccentric Lady, Shopper and Mrs Anderson\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Turkey and Figaro\n* [[Mae Whitman]] as Girl\n* [[April Winchell]] as [[Clarabelle Cow]], Mom, Old Woman, Firewoman, and Firefighter #1\n* [[Kelsey Grammer]] as the Narrator\n* [[Tommy Morgan]] provides Mickey's harmonica solos\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was originally released on VHS and DVD on November 9, 1999.<ref name=Crump/> It was later re-released on VHS and on DVD (as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection) on November 7, 2000.
