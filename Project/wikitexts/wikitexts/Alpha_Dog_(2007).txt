It grossed $32 million worldwide on a budget of $9 million.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the year 1999, Johnny Truelove is a very young [[drug dealer]] in the [[San Gabriel Valley]]. His father, Sonny, supplies him with [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], which Johnny distributes with his gang of friends: Frankie Ballenbacher, Johnny's right-hand man; Tiko Martinez, the group\u2019s muscle; Elvis Schmidt, who is ridiculed for being in debt to Johnny; and Jake Mazursky, an addict also in debt with Johnny. Jake attempts to borrow money from his father and stepmother, while his younger half-brother Zack looks up to him and longs to escape his home life.\n\nA fight suddenly breaks out when Jake tries to pay Johnny only part of his debt, leading Johnny to get Jake fired, and Jake to retaliate by breaking into Johnny\u2019s apartment. Johnny brings Frankie and Tiko to confront Jake, but he is nowhere to be found. Spotting Zack on the side of the road, Johnny impulsively orders the gang to kidnap him, planning to hold him until Jake pays his debt. Wanting a break from home, Zack makes no effort to escape, and they drive to [[Palm Springs]]. Frankie is left to watch Zack, and offers him a chance to leave, but Zack declines, not wanting to cause problems for his brother.\n\nStaying at Frankie\u2019s father\u2019s house, Zack bonds with Frankie and ingratiates himself with his friends Keith, Julie, Sabrina, and Susan, though only Susan is concerned by his abduction. Frankie suggests to Johnny that they pay Zack to keep quiet about the kidnapping, and Johnny agrees. However, after a threatening phone call with Jake, and learning from his lawyer that he could face life in prison, Johnny offers to forget Elvis\u2019 debt if he kills Zack, giving him a submachine gun. Believing Zack will be returning home that night, Frankie and his friends throw a raucous party at a hotel. Zack goes swimming naked with Julie and her friend Alma, leading to a threesome.\n\nEveryone happily says goodbye to Zack, and Elvis arrives, arguing with Frankie over Johnny\u2019s plan to kill Zack. While Frankie runs off, Elvis introduces himself to Zack, then takes Keith to dig a grave in the nearby mountains. Frankie returns and gives Zack a final opportunity to escape, but Zack declines, oblivious to the danger he is in. Elvis and Keith return, and Frankie relents when Elvis explains they could face life in prison. Sonny, Johnny's godfather Cosmo, and their lawyer confront Johnny, who refuses to call off the hit. Zack is brought to the grave, and despite his and Frankie\u2019s pleas, Elvis insists on following through. Frankie calms Zack and ties him up with duct tape, before Elvis knocks Zack into the grave and shoots him dead. Zack's body is soon discovered.\n\nThe story is intercut with interviews conducted by detective Tom Finnegan with people connected to Johnny\u2019s gang, and with some of the 38 witnesses who saw Zack between his initial kidnapping and eventual murder. Zack\u2019s mother Olivia, now suffering from obesity and depression, talks candidly about attempting suicide after her son's death. Susan angrily confronts Frankie and goes to the authorities. Elvis is caught trying to secure a lift out of town. Johnny flees to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] where an old classmate then drives him to Cosmo's house.\n\nTiko is convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to nine years in prison; Keith is convicted of second degree murder and remains at the California Youth Authority until the age of 25; Frankie is convicted of aggravated kidnapping of special circumstances and receives a life sentence; Elvis is convicted of kidnapping and first degree murder, and is currently on [[Death Row]] in [[San Quentin State Prison]]. Asked how his son was able to escape authorities for four years without help, Sonny claims not to know. In 2005, after over five years on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|FBI\u2019s most wanted list]], Johnny is arrested in Paraguay, and is now in California awaiting trial, facing the death penalty.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as Johnny Truelove, the leader, or the \"[[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]] dog.\" Inspired by [[Jesse James Hollywood]].
