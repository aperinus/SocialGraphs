It stars [[Val Kilmer]] (in his film debut role) and [[Lucy Gutteridge]] alongside a supporting cast featuring [[Omar Sharif]], [[Peter Cushing]], [[Michael Gough]], and [[Jeremy Kemp]].\n\nThe film parodies various film styles such as [[Elvis Presley on film and television|musicals starring Elvis Presley]], [[spy film]]s of the [[Cold War]] era and World War II films. The original music score was composed by [[Maurice Jarre]].\n\n==Plot==\nNick Rivers, an American rock star (\"Skeet Surfin'&thinsp;\"), travels to [[East Germany]] (which is represented as like [[Nazi Germany|Hitler's regime]]) to perform at a cultural festival, which secretly serves the East German government as a diversion for a military operation with the intent of reuniting Germany under their rule. At a dinner, Nick encounters Hillary Flammond, a member of the local resistance movement who is attempting to avoid the authorities. He pretends to be her date to get to know her, and performs an impromptu song and dance (\"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\"), mistakenly thinking he was asked to do so, to the delight of Hillary and the diners but to the annoyance of General Streck, the mastermind of the \"reunification\" plot.\n\nNick later sees Hillary at a ballet, where she expects to rendezvous with the resistance leader but is met by the police instead. Nick saves her and they try to escape, but Nick turns himself in so that Hillary can get away. He is taken to a prison where he is questioned and tortured, but he knows nothing and does not break. In an escape attempt, he ends up in the secret prison lab of Dr. Paul Flammond, a brilliant scientist developing the \"Polaris naval mine\", a device that can destroy the entire [[NATO]] submarine fleet as part of the government's plot. The East Germans force him to work by threatening to kill his daughter Hillary. Nick is recaptured and scheduled for execution.\n\nThe East Germans decide that Nick must perform to avoid an international incident, and he does so to the rapturous joy of the local girls (\"How Silly Can You Get\"/\"Spend This Night with Me\"). He is rescued by Hillary at the end of his performance, after which they spend the night in the loft of a Swedish bookstore. Nick plays for her (\"[[Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song)|Are You Lonesome Tonight?]]\") and they make love. The next morning, they are moved to the \"Potato Farm\" where they meet members of the [[French Resistance]], led by Nigel \"The Torch\", who was Hillary's lover from when they were stranded on an island as youths. Nick is upset by Hillary's love for Nigel, but accepts that they must work together for the cause. After fighting off an attack by the East Germans (who were tipped off by a mystery traitor) they move to a pizza restaurant, where Nick proves his identity by performing for the locals (\"Straighten Out the Rug\").\n\nThe resistance group stages a rescue of Dr. Flammond, where Nigel and Du Quois, a resistance leader, dress up in a fake cow outfit to disable the prison's defenses. While the other members successfully infiltrate the prison, Nigel reveals himself as the traitor. Dr. Flammond is rescued, but Nigel makes off with Hillary, and Nick is forced to rescue her in an underwater bar fight. With their flight about to leave, Hillary chooses to go with Nick and her father to America.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as Nick Rivers\n* [[Lucy Gutteridge]] as Hillary Flammond\n* [[Christopher Villiers]] as Nigel \"The Torch\", Resistance Leader\n* [[Billy J.

They made the TV series ''[[Police Squad!]]'' but it was cancelled after six episodes.<ref name=ScreenCrush>Ryan, Mike (June 18, 2014). [http://screencrush.com/top-secret-30/ \"How Silly Can You Get?

''[[TV Guide]]''. pp. 20 and 21</ref> David Zucker explained:\n\n<blockquote>We just needed a subject that we would be excited about. Starting out, we didn\u2019t have a whole genre like the airplane disaster movies. We were just fans of those black and white World War II movies that were made during the war. Somehow, we didn\u2019t think that was enough: we didn\u2019t want to do a period piece, we wanted to make it contemporary. That was the whole concept of \u2018Top Secret!\u2019: that it was not necessarily grounded in reality, but it would have kind of this heightened sense of craziness \u2013 even to which genres we were picking, which was a split hybrid between Elvis movies and the World War II movies.<ref name=ScreenCrush/></blockquote>\n\nDavid Zucker said they had been working on the script since ''Airplane!'' \"but we just couldn't figure out how to do it. We made repeated attempts to combine a rock and roll movie with a World War II movie but it was very difficult to do&nbsp;... We already had ideas for scenes we wanted to do and we tried to fit in plot around those scenes\". A fourth writer, Martyn Burke, was brought in to work on the plot. \"If it weren't for Martyn we'd still be sitting in that room\", said Jerry Zucker.<ref name=NewYorkTimes>{{Cite news|author=Bennetts, Leslie|date=June 24, 1984|title='''Top Secret''' Suggests That Three Heads May Be Funnier Than One: Three Behind 'Top Secret'|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=H19}}</ref>\n\nThe film was mostly written at the offices of ZAZ's lawyers.

The official reason was that Paramount wanted to avoid competing against ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and ''[[Gremlins]]'' although rumours spread that the studio was dissatisfied with the film's quality. Producer Jon Davison denied this saying \"Paramount has a lot of confidence in the picture or they wouldn't have cared.
