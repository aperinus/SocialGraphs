The film received four other Oscar nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. In 2018, ''Days of Wine and Roses'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Film Registry Turns 30|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-18-144/library-of-congress-national-film-registry-turns-30/2018-12-12/|access-date=2020-09-25|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-25|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[San Francisco]] [[public relations]] executive Joe Clay ([[Jack Lemmon]]) meets [[secretary]] Kirsten Arnesen ([[Lee Remick]]). Considering her to be brash and disrespectful at first, he eventually begins dating her. Kirsten is a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]] until Joe introduces her to [[Drinking culture#Social drinking|social drinking]]. She is reluctant at first, but after her first few [[Brandy Alexander]]s, she admits that having a drink makes her \u201cfeel good.\" Despite the misgivings of Kirsten's father ([[Charles Bickford]]), who runs a [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]] landscaping business, they marry and have a daughter, Debbie.\n\nJoe and Kirsten slowly go from the \"[[Three-martini lunch|two-martini lunch]]\" to full-blown [[alcoholism]]. Joe is demoted due to poor performance, and is sent out of town to work on a minor account. Kirsten is alone all day, and finds drinking the best way to pass the time. While drunk one afternoon, she causes a fire in their apartment that almost kills her and Debbie. Eventually, Joe is fired, and he spends the next several years going from job to job.\n\nOne day, Joe sees his reflection in a bar window, and realizes in horror that he hardly knows his own face. He tells Kirsten that they must stop drinking, and she reluctantly agrees. Seeking escape from their addiction, Joe and Kirsten work together in Arnesen's business and stay sober for two months.  But the urge is too strong, and after a late-night drinking binge, Joe destroys his father-in-law's greenhouse while looking for a stashed liquor bottle.\n\nJoe is committed to a sanitarium, where he suffers from [[delirium tremens]] while confined in a straitjacket. After his release, Joe finally gets sober for a while with the help of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], a dedicated [[Twelve-step program|sponsor]] named Jim Hungerford ([[Jack Klugman]]), and regular AA meetings. He explains to Joe how alcoholics often demonstrate obsessive behavior, pointing out that Kirsten's previous passion for chocolate may have been the first sign of an [[addictive personality]]. Jim advises Joe that most drinkers hate to drink alone or in the company of sober people.\n\nMeanwhile, Kirsten's drinking persists, and she disappears for several days without contacting Joe. She is eventually located at a nearby motel, drunk, but when Joe tries to help her, he ends up drinking again. When their supply runs out, Joe happens upon a [[liquor store]] that has closed for the night. He breaks in and steals a bottle, resulting in another trip to the sanitarium, where he is stripped down and tied to a treatment table. Hungerford appears at his side and warns him that he must keep sober no matter what, even if that means staying away from Kirsten.\n\nJoe finally gets sober, becomes a responsible father to Debbie, and holds down a steady job. He tries to make amends to his father-in-law by offering him payment for past debts and wrongs, but Arnesen accuses him of being indirectly responsible for Kirsten's alcoholism. After calming down, Arnesen says that Kirsten has been disappearing for long stretches of time and is picking up strangers in bars.\n\nOne night, after Debbie is asleep, Kirsten, shakily sober for two days, comes to Joe's apartment to attempt a reconciliation. Joe replies that she is welcome back anytime, but only if she stops drinking. Kirsten refuses to admit she is an alcoholic and acknowledges why she can't stop: \"The world looks so dirty to me when I'm not drinking.\u201d She tries to persuade Joe to forget the past and reunite with her.  He tells her he won't abandon sobriety for anything, not even her. If she wants to grab on, grab on, but there is no room for booze. Kirsten sadly advises Joe to give up on her. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he says.\n\nShe leaves. Joe fights the urge to go after her, calling her name, and watches through the window as she walks out into the night, turning away from a bar. Debbie wakes. He tells her she was dreaming and puts her back to bed, explaining:  \u201cMommy is sick\u2026\u201d \u201cIs she going to get well?\u201d \u201cI did, didn't I?\u201d Debbie nods.\n\nThe last scene is a reverse shot of Joe staring out at the empty street, the bar's flashing neon sign reflected in the window.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Joe Clay\n* [[Lee Remick]] as Kirsten Arnesen-Clay\n* [[Charles Bickford]] as Ellis Arnesen\n* [[Jack Klugman]] as Jim Hungerford\n* [[Alan Hewitt]] as Rad Leland\n* Tom Palmer as Ballefoy\n* Debbie Megowan as Debbie Clay\n* [[Maxine Stuart]] as Dottie\n* [[Jack Albertson]] as Trayner\n* [[Ken Lynch]] as Liquor Store Proprietor\n* [[Katherine Squire]] as Mrs. Nolan\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nJP Miller found his title in the 1896 poem \"Vitae Summa Brevis Spem Nos Vetat Incohare Longam\" by the English writer [[Ernest Dowson]] (1867\u20131900):<ref>[http://www.curtainup.com/daysofwineandroses.html Loveridge, Charlotte]. ''Curtain Up,'' theater review, February 24, 1995.</ref> It also inspired the title song devised by [[Henry Mancini]] and [[Johnny Mercer]].\n:They are not long, the weeping and the laughter,\n:Love and desire and hate;\n:I think they have no portion in us after\n:We pass the gate.\n\n:They are not long, the days of wine and roses:\n:Out of a misty dream\n:Our path emerges for a while, then closes\n:Within a dream.\n\nJohnny Mercer had also written the lyrics for the theme from ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'', a 1944 film in which Dowson's poem is quoted in its entirety.\n\nMiller's teleplay for ''Playhouse 90'', also titled ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (Playhouse 90)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'', had received favorable critical attention and was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] in the category Best Writing of a Single Dramatic Program - One Hour or Longer. Manulis, a ''Playhouse 90'' producer, decided the material was ideal for a movie. Some critics observed that the movie lacked the impact of the original television production, which starred [[Cliff Robertson]] as Joe and [[Piper Laurie]] as Kirsten. In an article written for ''DVD Journal,'' critic D.K. Holm noted numerous changes that altered the original considerably when the material was filmed. He cites as an example the hiring of Jack Lemmon. With his participation \"little remained of the founding teleplay, except for actor Charles Bickford reprising his role.\"<ref>[http://www.dvdjournal.com/quickreviews/d/daysofwineandroses.q.shtml Holm, D.K.] DVD Journal. Last accessed: December 25, 2007</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film's locations included San Francisco, Albany, California, and the [[Golden Gate Fields]] race track. The [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Oscar]]-winning [[Days of Wine and Roses (song)|title song]] had music by [[Henry Mancini]] and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. Single records by Andy Williams and the Henry Mancini chorus made the Billboard Top 40.\n\nDirector Blake Edwards became a non-drinker a year after completing the film and went into substance-abuse recovery. He said that he and Jack Lemmon were heavy drinkers while making the film.<ref>''Days of Wine and Roses,'' [[DVD]] commentary by Blake Edwards.</ref> Edwards used the theme of alcohol abuse often in his films, including ''[[10 (film)|10]]'' (1979), ''[[Blind Date (1987 film)|Blind Date]]'' (1987) and ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'' (1989). Both Lemmon and Remick sought help from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] long after they had completed the film. Lemmon revealed to [[James Lipton]] on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' his past drinking problems and his recovery. The film had a lasting effect in reinforcing the growing social acceptance of Alcoholics Anonymous.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blocker|first1=Jack S.|last2=Fahey|first2=David M.|last3=Tyrrell|first3=Ian R.|title=Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History: An International Encyclopedia|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1-57607-833-7|page=vol. 1, p. 29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuzNzm-x0l8C&q=%22Days+of+Wine+and+Roses%22&pg=PA29|access-date=17 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the interview on ''Inside the Actors Studio'', Lemmon stated that there was pressure by the studio to change the ending. To preserve the integrity of the movie, scenes were filmed in the same order as they appeared in the script, with the last scene filmed last. This is in contrast with the standard practice of filming different scenes together that take place in the same location, which reduces expenses, shortens the schedule, and aids with scheduling the actors' time on set. Immediately following the completion of filming, Lemmon left for Europe and remained out of communication so that the studio would be forced to release the movie without changing the story.\n\n==Release==\nThe producers used the following tagline to market the film: \"This, in its own terrifying way, is a love story.\"\n\nThe picture opened in the United States on December 26, 1962.\n\n===Home media===\n[[Warner Home Video]] released the film on video on February 9, 1983, as part of their \"A Night At the Movies\" series, featuring a [[Hearst Metrotone News]]reel; a Warner Bros. animated short; and a coming attractions trailer of films from 1962.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=December 28, 1982|page=2|title=Warner Home Vid Adds New Titles}}</ref> A LaserDisc was released in 1990. A DVD of the film was released on January 6, 2001, by Warner Home Video containing an extra commentary track by director Blake Edwards and an interview with Jack Lemmon. A [[Warner Archive Collection|Warner Archive]] Blu-ray was released on October 29, 2019.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film became one of Blake Edwards' better-regarded films, opening to praise from the critics and audiences alike. [[Bosley Crowther]], film critic for ''The New York Times'', wrote \"[It] is a commanding picture, and it is extremely well played by Mr. Lemmon and Miss Remick, who spare themselves none of the shameful, painful scenes. But for all their brilliant performing and the taut direction of Blake Edwards, they do not bring two pitiful characters to complete and overpowering life.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/01/18/archives/screen-days-of-wine-and-rosesa-crisp-romance-ends-as-temperance.html|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|author-link=Bosley Crowther|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Screen: 'Days of Wine and Roses'|date=January 18, 1963}}</ref>\n\n\"Tube.\" at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' liked the film, especially the acting and writing: \"Miller's gruelling drama illustrates how the unquenchable lure of alcohol can supersede even love, and how marital communication cannot exist in a house divided by one-sided boozing&nbsp;... Lemmon gives a dynamic and chilling performance. Scenes of his collapse, particularly in the violent ward, are brutally realistic and terrifying. Miss Remick, too, is effective, and there is solid featured work from Charles Bickford and Jack Klugman and a number of fine supporting performances.\"<ref name=varrev>{{cite magazine|title=Film Reviews: Days of Wine and Roses|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Tube.|url=https://variety.com/1961/film/reviews/days-of-wine-and-roses-1200420206/|access-date=November 17, 2020|date=December 5, 1962|page=11}}</ref>\n\nIn a review of the DVD, critic Gary W. Tooze lauded Edwards' direction: \"Blake Edwards's powerful adaptation of J.P. Miller's ''Playhouse 90'' story, starring Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick in career performances, remains a variation in his body of work largely devoted to comedy... Lemmon is at his best and ditto for Remick in this harrowing tale of people consumed by their mutual addiction. This turns to an honest and heartbreaking portrayal of alcoholism as deftly done as any film I can remember.\"<ref>[http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDReview/daysofwineandroses.htm Tooze, Gary W.] DVD Beaver, DVD review of film ''Days of Wine and Roses.''
