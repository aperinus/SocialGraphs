The screenplay was written by [[Leigh Brackett]], who co-wrote the screenplay for Chandler's ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' in 1946. The film stars [[Elliott Gould]] as [[Philip Marlowe]] and features [[Sterling Hayden]], [[Nina Van Pallandt]], [[Jim Bouton]] (in a rare acting role), [[Mark Rydell]] and an early uncredited appearance by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].\n\nThe story's period was moved from 1949\u201350 to 1970s [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]].

Marlowe obliges. On returning home, Marlowe is met by two police detectives who accuse Lennox of having murdered his rich wife, Sylvia. Marlowe refuses to give them any information, so they arrest him. After he is jailed for three days, the police release him, because they have learned that Lennox has committed [[suicide]] in Mexico. The police and the press seem to believe it is an obvious case, but Marlowe does not accept the official facts.\n\nMarlowe is hired by Eileen Wade, who asks him to find her missing husband Roger, an [[alcoholic]] novelist with writer's block whose macho, [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]-like persona is proving self-destructive, resulting in days-long disappearances from their [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home. While investigating Eileen's missing husband, Marlowe visits the subculture of private detoxification clinics for rich alcoholics and [[drug addiction|drug addicts]]. He locates and recovers Roger and learns that the Wades knew the Lennoxes socially, and suspects that there is more to Lennox's suicide and Sylvia's murder. Marlowe incurs the wrath of gangster Marty Augustine, who wants money returned that Lennox owed him, and threatens Marlowe by maiming his own mistress.\n\nAfter a side-trip to Mexico, where officials corroborate the details of Lennox's death, Marlowe returns to the Wade house. A party breaks up after an argument over Roger's unpaid bill from the detoxification clinic. Later that night, Eileen and Marlowe are interrupted when she sees a drunken Roger wandering into the sea; before they can stop him, he drowns. Eileen confesses that Roger had been having an affair with Sylvia, and might have killed her. Marlowe tells this to the police, who tell him that Roger's time at the clinic provides an alibi.\n\nAfter visiting Augustine, whose missing money has been returned, Marlowe sees Eileen driving away in her open topped [[Mercedes-Benz R107 and C107|Mercedes-Benz 450SL]]. While running after her, he is struck by a car and hospitalized. Waking up, he is given a harmonica by the heavily-bandaged patient in the next bed. Returning to Malibu, he finds the Wade house being packed up by a real estate company and Eileen gone.\n\nHe returns to Mexico, where he bribes local officials into revealing the truth. They confess to having set up Terry's apparent suicide and reveal he is alive and well in a Mexican villa. Marlowe finds Terry, who admits to killing Sylvia and reveals that he is having an affair with Eileen. Roger had discovered the affair and disclosed it to Sylvia, after which Terry killed her in the course of a violent argument. Terry gloats that Marlowe fell for his manipulations, causing Marlowe to fatally shoot Terry. As Marlowe walks away, he passes Eileen, who is on her way to meeting Terry. Marlowe pulls out his harmonica and plays it while strolling jauntily down the road.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as [[Philip Marlowe]]\n* [[Nina van Pallandt]] as Eileen Wade\n* [[Sterling Hayden]] as Roger Wade\n* [[Mark Rydell]] as Marty Augustine\n* [[Henry Gibson]] as Dr. Verringer\n* [[David Arkin]] as Harry\n* [[Jim Bouton]] as Terry Lennox\n* [[Warren Berlinger]] as Morgan\n* [[Pancho C\u00f3rdova]] as Doctor\n* [[Enrique Lucero]] as Jefe\n* [[Rutanya Alda]] as Rutanya Sweet\n* [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]] as Riley\n* Jerry Jones as Det.

Brackett:\n<blockquote>... set the deal with United Artists, and they had a commitment for a film with Elliott Gould, so either you take Elliott Gould or you don't make the film. Elliott Gould was not exactly my idea of Philip Marlowe, but anyway there we were. Also, as far as the story was concerned, time had gone by\u2014it was twenty-odd years since the novel was written, and the private eye had become a clich\u00e9. It had become funny. You had to watch out what you were doing. If you had Humphrey Bogart at the same age that he was when he did ''The Big Sleep'', he wouldn't do it the same way. Also, we were faced with a technical problem of this enormous book, which was the longest one Chandler ever wrote. It's tremendously involuted and convoluted. If you did it the way he wrote it, you would have a five-hour film.<ref name=\"leigh\"/></blockquote>\n[[Brian G. Hutton]], who had made a number of movies for Kastner, was originally attached as director and Brackett says Hutton wanted the script structured so that \"the heavy had planned the whole thing from the start\" but when writing it she found the idea contrived.<ref name=\"leigh\">[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft0z09n7m0&chunk.id=d0e1020&toc.depth=1&brand=ucpress ''Backstory 2: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1940s and 1950s'' By Patrick McGilligan p23]</ref>\n\nThe producers offered the script to both [[Howard Hawks]] and [[Peter Bogdanovich]] to direct it. Both refused the offer, but Bogdanovich recommended Robert Altman.<ref name=\"McGilligan\"/>\n\n===Robert Altman===\nUnited Artists president David Picker may have picked Gould to play Marlowe as a ploy to get Altman to direct. At the time, Gould was in professional disfavor because of his rumored troubles on the set of ''[[A Glimpse of Tiger]]'', in which he bickered with costar [[Kim Darby]], fought with director [[Anthony Harvey]], and acted erratically. Consequently, he had not worked in nearly two years; nevertheless, Altman convinced Bick that Gould suited the role.<ref name=\"McGilligan\"/> United Artists had Elliott Gould undergo the usual employment medical examination, and also a [[psychological examination]] attesting to his mental stability.<ref name=\"McGilligan2\">McGilligan 1989, p. 361.</ref>\n\nIn January 1972 it was announced Altman and Gould would make the film.<ref>Gould, Altman Team for 'Long Goodbye'\nHaber, Joyce.

Los Angeles Times 23 July 1972: u1</ref>\n\nIn adapting Chandler's book, Leigh Brackett had problems with its plot, which she felt was \"riddled with cliches\", and faced the choice of making it a period piece or updating it.<ref name=\"McGilligan4\">McGilligan 1989, p. 363.</ref> Altman received a copy of the script while shooting ''[[Images (film)|Images]]'' in [[Ireland]]. He liked the ending because it was so out of character for Marlowe. He agreed to direct but only if the ending was not changed.<ref name=\"Thompson\">Thompson 2005, p. 75.</ref>\n\nBrackett recalled meeting Altman while he was doing ''Images''. \"We conferred about ten o'clock in the morning and yakked all day, and I went back to the hotel and typed all the notes and went back the next day. In a week we had it all worked out. He was a joy to work with. He had a very keen story mind.\"<ref name=\"leigh\"/>\n\nAltman and Brackett spent a lot of time talking over the plot. Altman wanted Marlowe to be a loser. He even nicknamed Gould's character Rip Van Marlowe, as if he had been asleep for 20 years, had woken up, and was wandering around Los Angeles in the early 1970s but \"trying to invoke the morals of a previous era\".<ref name=\"Thompson2\">Thompson 2005, p. 76.</ref>\n\nBrackett says her first draft was too long, and she shortened it, but the ending was inconclusive.<ref name=\"McGilligan4\"/> She had Marlowe shooting Terry Lennox.<ref name=\"McGilligan5\">McGilligan 1989, p. 364.</ref> Altman conceived of the film as a satire and made several changes to the script, like having Roger Wade commit suicide and having Marty Augustine smash a Coke bottle across his girlfriend's face.<ref name=\"McGilligan5\"/> Altman said, \"it was supposed to get the attention of the audience and remind them that, in spite of Marlowe, there is a real world out there, and it is a violent world\".<ref name=\"McGilligan6\">McGilligan 1989, p. 365.</ref>\n\n\"Chandler fans will hate my guts,\" said Altman. \"I don't give a damn.\"<ref name=\"hate\">Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe\nMichaels, Ken.

[[Jim Bouton]], cast as Marlowe's friend Terry Lennox, was not an actor; he was a former [[Major League Baseball]] pitcher and the author of the bestselling book ''[[Ball Four]]''. [[Nina Van Pallandt]] was best known at the time as the ex-lover of writer [[Clifford Irving]], who had written a fake autobiography of [[Howard Hughes]] that turned into a major scandal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/clifford-irving-dead-died-author-literary-hoax-howard-hughes-a8132121.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220618/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/clifford-irving-dead-died-author-literary-hoax-howard-hughes-a8132121.html |archive-date=2022-06-18 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|website=The Independent|title=Clifford Irving: Author whose literary hoax fooled America in the Seventies and inspired a Hollywood film|first=Harrison|last=Smith|date=December 29, 2017|accessdate=December 1, 2021}}</ref> [[Mark Rydell]], who played vicious gangster Marty Augustine, had an acting background, but was better known as the director of films like ''[[The Cowboys]]'' and ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0041932/?ref_=pro_nm_visitcons|website=IMDb|title=Mark Rydell|accessdate=December 1, 2021}}</ref> [[Henry Gibson]] was another odd choice, having just completed four years as a cast member of the TV comedy-variety series ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002099/?ref_=pro_nm_visitcons|website=IMDb|title=Henry Gibson|accessdate=December 1, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1972 it was announced [[Dan Blocker]] would appear.<ref>MOVIE CALL SHEET: Blocker, Gould to Costar\nLos Angeles Times (1923-1995); Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif]05 May 1972: g22.</ref> He was cast in the role of Roger Wade. However, he died before filming started. The film is dedicated to his memory in the closing credits.\n\nIn June it was announced that [[Vilmos Zsigmond]] would be cinematographer.<ref>MOVIE CALL SHEET: Redford Picked as 'Gatsby'\nMurphy, Mary. Los Angeles Times (1923-1995); Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif]08 June 1972: h17.</ref>\n\nNear the midpoint of the film, during a scene in which Marlowe meets with Marty Augustine, Augustine orders everyone to strip and we see [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in briefs portraying a massive thug working for Augustine. Arnold received neither screen credit nor lines in this appearance.\n\n===Filming===\nAltman did not read all of Chandler's book and instead used ''Raymond Chandler Speaking'', a collection of letters and essays. He gave copies of this book to the cast and crew, advising them to study the author's literary essays.<ref name=\"McGilligan5\"/> The opening scene with Philip Marlowe and his cat came from a story a friend of Altman's told him about his cat only eating one type of cat food. Altman saw it as a comment on friendship.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> The director decided that the camera should never stop moving and put it on a dolly.<ref name=\"Thompson3\">Thompson 2005, p. 77.</ref> The camera movements would counter the actions of the characters so that the audience would feel like a voyeur. To compensate for the harsh light of Southern California, Altman gave the film a soft pastel look reminiscent of old postcards from the 1940s.<ref name=\"Thompson3\"/>\n\nWhen it came to the scenes between Philip Marlowe and Roger Wade, Altman had Elliott Gould and Sterling Hayden ad lib most of their dialogue because, according to the director, Hayden was drunk and stoned on [[marijuana]] most of the time.<ref name=\"McGilligan5\"/> Altman was reportedly thrilled by Hayden's performance, despite him being second choice to Blocker. Altman's home in Malibu Colony was used as the location for the scenes that took place in Wade's house. \"I hope it works,\" said Altman during filming. \"We've got a script but we don't follow it closely.\"<ref name=\"hate\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack of ''The Long Goodbye'' features two songs, \"[[Hooray for Hollywood]]\" and \"The Long Goodbye\", composed by [[John Williams]] and [[Johnny Mercer]]. It was Altman's idea to have every occurrence of the latter song arranged differently, from hippie chant to supermarket [[Elevator music|muzak]] to radio music, setting the mood for the hero's encounters with eccentric Californians, while pursuing his case.<ref name=\"Thompson5\">Thompson 2005, p. 80.</ref>\n\n[[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] released selections from Williams' score on a CD in 2004 paired with the album re-recording of Williams' music from ''[[Fitzwilly]]''; in 2015 Quartet Records issued a CD entirely devoted to ''The Long Goodbye''.\n\n{{Tracklist\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline  = ''The Long Goodbye''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.quartetrecords.com/the-long-goodbye.html | title = ''The Long Goodbye: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' | publisher = Quartet Records | access-date = October 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n| title1 = The Long Goodbye (John Williams, piano soloist)\n| length1 = 3:07\n| title2 = The Long Goodbye ([[Clydie King]], vocal)\n| length2 = 4:35\n| title3 = The Long Goodbye ([[Dave Grusin]] trio)\n| length3 = 5:02\n| title4 = The Long Goodbye ([[Jack Sheldon]], vocal)\n| length4 = 3:32\n| title5 = The Long Goodbye (Dave Grusin trio)\n| length5 = 4:33\n| title6 = The Long Goodbye - Tango\n| length6 = 2:30\n| title7 = The Long Goodbye ([[Irene Kral]] & Dave Grusin trio)\n| length7 = 3:11\n| title8 = The Long Goodbye - Mariachi\n| length8 = 2:04\n| title9 = Marlowe in Mexico\n| length9 = 3:37\n| title10 = Main Title Montage\n| length10 = 10:58\n| title11 = Night Talk\n| length11 = 2:08\n| title12 = The Border\n| length12 = 0:34\n| title13 = Love Theme from \"The Long Goodbye\"\n| length13 = 1:58\n| title14 = The Long Goodbye - Sitar\n| length14 = 1:02\n| title15 = Guitar Nostalgia\n| length15 = 1:01\n| title16 = The Mexican Funeral\n| length16 = 2:31\n| title17 = Finale\n| length17 = 1:08\n| title18 = Clydie King Adlibs Rehearsal\n| length18 = 8:25\n| title19 = Jack Riley and Ensemble Rehearsal\n| length19 = 1:39\n| title20 = Violin Rehearsal\n| length20 = 2:06\n}}\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on September 17, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|first=Enrique|last=Rivero|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/product_article.cfm?article_id=3170|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604225436/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/product_article.cfm?article_id=3170|title=MGM Preserves Zsigmond's Vision With 'Goodbye|website=hive4media.com|archive-date=June 4, 2002|date=May 23, 2002|access-date=September 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n===Initial release===\n''The Long Goodbye'' was previewed at the Tarrytown Conference Center in [[Tarrytown, New York]].

Screenwriter Leigh Brackett took many liberties with the story, plot and characters of ''The Long Goodbye'' in her adaptation. In the film,  Marlowe kills his best friend, Terry Lennox. Lennox did kill his own wife, because she discovered he was having an affair with Eileen, and he admits this to Marlowe. The father of millionairess Sylvia Lennox, Sylvia herself as well as her sister, do not appear in the film; Roger Wade commits suicide in the film, rather than being murdered; and gangster Marty Augustine and his subplots are additions to the film. Bernie Ohls, Marlowe's sometime-friend on the LAPD, is also absent.\n\nThe film quotes from the novel when Marlowe, under police interrogation, asks, \"Is this where I'm supposed to say, 'What's all this about?' and he [the cop] says, 'Shut up! I ask the questions'?\"<ref>''The Long Goodbye'', Houghton Mifflin, p. 28</ref>\n\nThroughout the film are stylistic nods to the Chandler novels and 1950s American culture. Marlowe drives a 1948 [[Lincoln Continental]] convertible Cabriolet, in contrast with the contemporary cars driven by others in the film. Marlowe also [[chain smoking|chain smokes]] in the film, in contrast with a health-conscious California; no one else smokes onscreen. As a reference to the American iconography which Chandler used in his novels, Marlowe wears a tie with [[American flag]]s on it (the tie looks plain red in the movie due to cinematographer [[Vilmos Zsigmond]]'s [[Post-production|post]]-[[Flashing (cinematography)|flashing]]).<ref name=\"rip van marlowe\">''Rip Van Marlowe'', Director Greg Carson, 2002.</ref>\n\nA \"making-of\" featurette on the DVD is entitled \"Rip van Marlowe\", a reference to the character [[Rip Van Winkle]], to emphasize the contrast between Marlowe's anachronistic 1950s behavior and the film's 1970s setting.<ref name=\"rip van marlowe\" />\n\n==Later screenings==\nWhen the film screened on TV in 1977, ABC cut off the final shooting.<ref name=\"Deeb\">{{cite web |last1=Deeb |first1=Gary |title='Long Goodbye' was a short one |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/78797188/ |website=Chicago Tribune |page=II-12 |date=29 July 1977|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'' (2017), the soundtrack of which was also composed by [[John Williams]], briefly samples Williams's own theme for ''The Long Goodbye'' (lyrics by [[Johnny Mercer]]) during Finn and Rose's escape, although this was not included in the official soundtrack release.
