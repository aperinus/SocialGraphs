The film stars [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Stacy Martin]], [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Jamie Bell]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[Jean-Marc Barr]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Connie Nielsen]]. The plot follows Joe (played by Gainsbourg and Martin), a self-diagnosed \"[[hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]],\" who recounts her erotic experiences to a bachelor who helps her recover from an assault. The narrative chronicles Joe's promiscuous life from adolescence to adulthood and is split into eight chapters told across two volumes. The film was originally supposed to be only one complete entry, but, because of its length, von Trier made the decision to split the project into two separate films. ''Nymphomaniac'' was an international co-production of [[Cinema of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Cinema of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Cinema of France|France]], and [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]].\n\nThe world premiere of the uncut ''Volume I'' occurred on 16 February 2014 at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"Berlin\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2014/pressemitteilungen_2014/08_pressemitteilungen_2014detail_20821.html |title=World premiere of Lars von Trier's Long Uncut Version of Nymphomaniac Volume I |access-date=2014-01-01 |work=berlinale}}</ref> while the uncut ''Volume II'' premiered at the [[71st Venice International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Venice\">{{Cite web |url=http://trustnordisk.com/content/nymphomaniac-volume-ii-director-s-cut-selected-venice-film-festival |title='NYMPHOMANIAC Volume II \u2013 Director's Cut Selected for Venice Film Festival |access-date=2014-07-24 |work=MICHELLE RIIS MICHAELSEN}}</ref> The world premiere of the Director's Cut took place in Copenhagen on 10 September 2014.

The Gun\n|}\nOn a snowy evening, middle-aged bachelor Seligman ([[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]]) finds [[self-diagnosed]] [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] Joe ([[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]) beaten up and lying in the alleyway behind his apartment. He takes her back to his home and, over tea, listens intently as Joe recounts the story of her libidinous life. Seligman, a highly educated but cloistered man, connects and analyses Joe's stories with what he has read about. Seligman's favourite hobby to read about is fly fishing, which is why he has a [[Artificial fly|fly fishing lure]] on his wall and this is how their conversation begins. Throughout the story he parallels much of what she has experienced with various methods of the sport.\n\n===Volume I===\nInspired by a fly fishing lure on the wall behind her and Seligman's love of [[Izaak Walton]]'s book ''[[The Compleat Angler]]'', Joe opens her story by talking about her precocious sexual fascination during her early childhood. Her father ([[Christian Slater]]) is a tree-loving doctor whom she adores while her mother ([[Connie Nielsen]]) is, as Joe describes her, a \"cold bitch\". In adolescence, Joe ([[Stacy Martin]]) loses her virginity to an arbitrary young man named Jer\u00f4me ([[Shia LaBeouf]]). This first encounter, which ends with Jer\u00f4me casually leaving her to fix his [[moped]], leaves her disappointed, while Seligman observes that the combination of the number of times Jer\u00f4me penetrated her, three times vaginally and five times anally, resembles the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]].\n\nSeveral years later, Joe engages in a contest with her friend B ([[Sophie Kennedy Clark]]) during a train journey; whichever of the two women has sex with the most passengers by the train's arrival at the station wins a bag of chocolate sweets. After having sex in the toilet with several of the men she comes across, Joe wins by performing a blowjob on a passenger in a first-class car, S ([[Jens Albinus]]). S is a married man who resists both her and B's advances, but ultimately Joe forces herself on him. Joe tells Seligman her encounter with S is the first of many terrible things she has done, but he waves off her accusation.\n\nOver [[rugelach]] and a discussion over the lack of masculinity in men using cake forks to eat pastry, Joe talks about her first experiences with actual love, something she dismisses as \"lust with jealousy added\". Joe takes on more lovers as she, B, and several friends create a club, \"The Little Flock\", dedicated to liberating themselves from society's fixation on love. Joe eventually leaves after all the other members end up developing serious attachments to their conquests. As a young adult, Joe drops out of medical school and finds work as a secretary at a printing company. Her first employer is none other than Jer\u00f4me. While sexual intentions are clearly on his mind, she finds herself avoiding his advances and sleeping with other co-workers, frustrating him. When Joe finally realises she has developed feelings for Jer\u00f4me, she writes him a letter. However, she is too late as he has left with his uncle's jealous secretary Liz (Felicity Gilbert), who was fully aware of Joe's feelings. She is immediately fired by his uncle ([[Jesper Christensen]]), the actual owner of the company, for her lack of experience and goes back to indulging her nymphomania, despite a yearning for Jer\u00f4me.\n\nOn one occasion with one of her lovers, H ([[Hugo Speer]]), Joe inadvertently causes conflict that makes him leave his wife for her. The distressed Mrs. H ([[Uma Thurman]]) arrives and demonises both of them in front of her children, though Joe states in the present that this barely affected her. The situation then becomes more awkward as Joe's next lover, A ([[Cyron Melville]]), arrives at the house and finds himself in the middle of Mrs. H's mental breakdown. The family finally leaves, but not before Mrs. H verbally lacerates Joe, slaps her now ex-husband and leaves the apartment wailing.\n\nA conversation about [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and his death from [[delirium tremens]] reminds Joe of the last time she saw her father. She is the only one to visit him in the hospital as he dies of cancer. Joe's father asks her not to slander her mother, who is afraid of hospitals, for not being by his side, explaining they said their goodbyes. Joe is a firsthand witness as her father deteriorates from a unnamed illness, into fits of violent spasms, paranoid delusions and screams for his wife. To take her mind off her father's suffering, the cause of which she remains naive to, Joe has sexual intercourse with several people at the hospital. When he finally dies, Joe becomes sexually aroused, with a drop of [[Vaginal lubrication|vaginal fluid]] running down her thigh as she stands in front of the body, and becomes numb with depression.\n\nAfter Seligman explains how he feels [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] perfected [[polyphony]], Joe uses his example to talk about three lovers leading up to her \"[[cantus firmus]]\". The \"bass voice\", F ([[Nicolas Bro]]) is a tender but predictable man who puts her sexual needs above his own. The \"second voice\", G (Christian Gade Bjerrum), thrills Joe because of his animalistic control of her in bed. During one of Joe's regular walks in the local park, Jer\u00f4me finds her after separating from Liz, a coincidence Seligman finds preposterous, and they embrace. As the two engage in authentically passionate sex \u2013 set alongside Joe's experiences with F and G \u2013 Joe becomes emotionally distraught when discovering she can no longer \"feel anything\".\n\n===Volume II===\nJoe becomes annoyed with Seligman, accusing him of overlooking the severity of her lost sexuality to focus on the allegorical before realising he cannot relate to her stories. He goes on to confirm his [[asexuality]] and virginity, but assures her his \"innocence\" and lack of bias makes him the best man to listen to her story. She becomes inspired to tell him another portion of her life after noticing a [[Andrei Rublev|Rublev]]-styled icon of the Virgin Mary and a discussion about the differences between the Eastern Church (\"the church of happiness\") and the Western Church (\"the church of suffering\").\n\nJoe reminisces about a field trip as a young girl that suggests she had a vision of [[Valeria Messalina]] and the [[Whore of Babylon]] looking over her as she levitates and spontaneously has her first orgasm, which shocks Seligman as he explains her orgasm is a mockery of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration of Jesus on the Mount]]. Returning to where she left off in her story, Joe falls into a crisis upon losing her ability to achieve sexual pleasure, though she does find a different sort of pleasure in her time with Jer\u00f4me. When the two conceive a baby together, Marcel, Jer\u00f4me struggles to keep up with her sexual needs and allows her to see other men. This is shown to be detrimental later, as he becomes jealous of her endeavors.\n\nSeveral years later to no success, Joe's sexual endeavors become increasingly adventurous by engaging in a tryst with a pair of African brothers that turns into a botched threesome; the frustration to reclaim her orgasm culminates in visits to K ([[Jamie Bell]]), a sadist who violently assaults women seeking his company. The more she visits him, the more neglectful she becomes in her domestic duties. At Christmas, after stopping an unattended Marcel who has wandered out an opened door onto a snowy balcony from coming into any harm, Jer\u00f4me forces her to choose between the family and K. She picks the latter and, after receiving an especially brutal beating from K with a [[cat o' nine tails]] that allows her to climax again, takes a path of loneliness away from her one and only possibility of a normal life. Marcel is sent to live in a foster home because Jer\u00f4me has no room in his life for him.\n\nTo keep the story from ending on an unhappy note, Joe concludes it with the first time K introduced her to [[Fisting|\"the Silent Duck\"]], which leaves Seligman surprised and impressed at K's talents.\n\nLooking at the mirror facing Seligman's bed, Joe jumps ahead in time. Several years later, Joe has regained pleasure, but her genitalia are left with some irreversible damage due to a lifetime of sexual activity mixed with K's brutality. Her habits are known around her new office, prompting the boss to demand she attend [[sex addiction]] therapy under the threat of losing her job and any future job she takes.\n\nWhen asked why she refused to attend therapy, Joe talks about becoming pregnant after leaving Jer\u00f4me and Marcel and demanding her doctor abort the 11-week pregnancy, but he insists she speak to a counselor first. The visit to the psychologist ([[Caroline Goodall]]) ends disastrously due to Joe's attitude towards the situation. She decides to take matters into her own hands and perform the abortion herself. Using the knowledge she had retained from medical school, Joe aborts the fetus with the use of several household implements and a wire hanger. Back in the present, Joe and Seligman get into a very heated argument regarding Joe's actions, [[abortion rights]] in general and Seligman's potential hypocrisy in supporting them while wanting to know nothing about how the actual procedure is performed.\n\nJoe reluctantly attends the meetings and, after ridding her apartment of almost everything in it, attempts sobriety. During one meeting three weeks later, she sees a reflection of her younger self in the mirror, harshly insults every member of the group, including the therapist, and proclaims pride in her nymphomania before walking out.\n\nJoe tells Seligman she is not sure where to conclude her story as she has used every item from around his room to help inspire each \"chapter\". After a suggestion from him, she notices how the stain from a cup of tea she had earlier thrown in anger looks like a [[Walther PPK]], the same kind of gun her favourite literary character [[James Bond]] uses, and knows exactly how and where to end things.\n\nRealising she has no place in \"normal\" society, Joe turns to organised crime and becomes a debt collector, utilising her extensive knowledge of men, sex, and [[sadomasochism]]. She reminisces about a memorable housecall to a man ([[Jean-Marc Barr]]) who she initially finds sexually unreadable. She ties him to a chair, strips him and attempts to provoke him with every sexual scenario she can think of. Upon further interrogation, Joe gleans that he is a repressed [[pedophile]]. She takes pity on him and fellates him. Joe explains to Seligman how she feels deep compassion for people born with a forbidden sexuality. She strongly identifies with the man's loneliness and status as a sexual outcast, and laud him for going through life without acting on his aberrant desires.\n\nJoe's superior, L ([[Willem Dafoe]]), recommends that she groom an apprentice and suggests P ([[Mia Goth]]), the 15-year-old daughter of criminals. Joe is initially repulsed by the idea, but ends up sympathising with the girl in question. P is a vulnerable, lonely, emotionally damaged young girl who quickly latches herself onto Joe. The two of them click and form a special connection. Joe opens her heart to P and eventually invites her to move into her home. Over time, Joe and P's relationship develops a sexual dimension, leading to romance. As P seems to mature, Joe hesitantly decides to teach her young female lover the ropes of her trade.\n\nDuring one round of debt collection, Joe notices that they are at a house belonging to Jer\u00f4me (now played by Micha\u00ebl Pas) and, to make sure she is not seen, tells P to perform her first solo job. This proves to be a mistake as Joe eventually discovers P is having an affair with Jer\u00f4me. After finding her \"soul tree\" in a failed attempt to leave town, Joe waits for Jer\u00f4me and P in the alley between his home and her apartment and pulls a gun she confiscated from P earlier on him. When she pulls the trigger, she forgets to rack the pistol. Jer\u00f4me viciously beats Joe and then has sex with P right in front of her, thrusting into P in exactly the same way he once took her virginity. P urinates on her before leaving her as she was at the beginning of the film.\n\nIn the present, Seligman suggests how the circumstances of Joe's life might have been due to differences in gender representation; all of the stigma, guilt and shame she felt for her actions made her fight back aggressively \"like a man\", ultimately \"forgetting\" to rack the gun because her human worth would not allow her to kill someone, even Jer\u00f4me. Joe, who has until this moment been playing [[devil's advocate]] to Seligman's assumptions, finally feels at peace, having unburdened her story to someone with she truly considers a friend. She says she is too tired to go on and asks to go to sleep.\n\nAs Joe begins to drift off, Seligman silently returns with his pants off and attempts to rape her. Joe wakes up and, realising what Seligman is doing, reaches for and racks the gun. Seligman protests and attempts to justify his behaviour, but Joe shoots him, grabs her things, and flees the apartment.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Do NOT change cast order, it's how they are officially billed.

From 25 December 2013, and approximately four months ahead, the four-hour long NYMPHOMANIAC Volume I and II is released worldwide. In some territories the two volumes will be released at the same time, and in some territories the volumes will be released apart. Each country has its own rules of censorship and in order to create cohesion between each country's distribution strategies the four-hour long version will be the one released first. And even this version is expected to meet minor additional changes in certain countries. Just as Lars von Trier gave consent to the making of different censored versions of ANTICHRIST, when that film was released, Trier has also approved of this version of NYMPHOMANIAC. Technically the changes in the abridged version consist of an editing-out of the most explicit close-ups of genitals and the film has, in agreement with Lars von Trier, been shortened by his editors to a length, which has been decided upon in collaboration with several of the film's stakeholders, two parts of two hours each. The five-and-a-half-hour long version of NYMPHOMANIAC Volume I and II expect to be finalized for distribution sometime in 2014. When, exactly, is to be confirmed. This version will be distributed in those parts of the world where laws of censorship allow. Ever since NYMPHOMANIAC was announced as Lars von Trier's next project it's been out in the open that the film would be distributed in different versions, ensuring financing, and as widespread distribution of NYMPHOMANIAC as possible, and finally to ensure Lars von Trier as much artistic freedom as possible.\n| Producer Louise Vesth, November 2013, quoted from ''Nymphomaniac International Press Materials''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymphomaniacthemovie.com/assets/downloads/docs/INT_press_materials_291113.pdf |title=Nymphomaniac International Press Materials |publisher=Nymphomaniacthemovie.com |access-date=24 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514122655/http://www.nymphomaniacthemovie.com/assets/downloads/docs/INT_press_materials_291113.pdf |archive-date=14 May 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\n{{Quotation\n| We knew from the beginning that there would be various versions.
