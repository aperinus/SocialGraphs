He is also anxiously awaiting [[prom]] and has the hopes of going with Cinny ([[Maia Campbell]]), the school's local beauty. As he tries to ask his parents for help paying for prom, they begin nagging him after finding out he hasn\u2019t filled out one college application, telling him they won\u2019t give a dime until he fills one out. Along with these wants, Greg is also an avid daydreamer and  is always daydreaming (\"trippin'\") over everything. \n\n==Production notes==\n''Trippin''' was filmed on location in California in the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] in 1998.
