He finds an outlet for his creativity making custom [[Horse head mask|horse masks]] and provocative outfits for Galega (Maeve Jinkings), the group's driver who also performs sexually enticing dances for groups of men after each rodeo. They are accompanied by Galega's daughter, Cac\u00e1 (Alyne Santana); and Z\u00e9 (Carlos Pessoa), a buffoonish bull wrangler who is the butt of the other's jokes. The film deals mainly with the interactions between the members of this group, interspersed with Iremar's attempts to design clothing, and rodeo scenes. After an attempt by Iremar and Z\u00e9 to steal valuable [[Thoroughbred|horse semen]] from a stud auction goes awry, Z\u00e9 is offered a new job as a horse wrangler; he is replaced in the group by Junior (Vin\u00edcius de Oliveira) a young, attractive, and vain, but kind, man who befriends Cac\u00e1 and becomes sexually involved with Galega. During a rodeo, Iremar meets Geise, a pregnant woman selling cologne and perfume from a large factory where she also works as a nighttime security guard. After the rodeo, Geise brings a bottle of cologne to Iremar as a gift. Later, at night, he visits her at the factory, where he is impressed by the industrial clothing machinery. She seduces him, whereupon they engage in sexual intercourse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Juliano Cazarr\u00e9]] as Iremar\n* [[Maeve Jinkings]] as Galega\n* [[Vin\u00edcius de Oliveira]] as J\u00fanior\n* Alyne Santana as Cac\u00e1\n* Josinaldo Alves as M\u00e1rio\n* Samya De Lavor as Geise\n* Carlos Pessoa as Z\u00e9\n* [[Abigail Pereira]] as Fabiana\n\n==Production==\nIn the scene where [[Juliano Cazarr\u00e9]] had to masturbate a horse, he was sure that [[Gabriel Mascaro]] had planned to use a prosthesis. Instead, when the director told him that he would have to actually touch the horse's penis, he refused to continue unless Mascaro did the same first. So in the end they both did the act.<ref>{{cite web |title=Horse Masturbation and Pregnant Sex: Body Politics in Gabriel Mascaro's 'Neon Bull' |work=nofilmschool.com |url=https://nofilmschool.com/2016/04/neon-bull-gabriel-mascaro |access-date=30 January 2022 }}</ref>\n\nThe genuinity of the scene in which [[Juliano Cazarr\u00e9]] had to have sex with Samya De Lavor, who was really 8 months pregnant, is disputed.
