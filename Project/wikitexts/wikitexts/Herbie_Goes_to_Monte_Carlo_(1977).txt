In the film, [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] returns as champion race car driver Jim Douglas (reprising his role from the [[The Love Bug|first film in the series]]), joined this time by his somewhat cynical and eccentric riding mechanic Wheely Applegate ([[Don Knotts]]). The film follows Douglas, Applegate, and Herbie as they participate in the fictional Trans-France Race, a [[road racing|road race]] from [[Paris, France]], to [[Monte Carlo, Monaco]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Herbie car.jpg|thumb|left|Original car used during filming of ''Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo'']]\nJim Douglas, his partner and mechanic Wheely Applegate, and Herbie arrive in Paris to qualify for and compete in the Trans-France Race (a fictional version of the [[Monte Carlo Rally]]), in the hopes of staging a career comeback. The team has three major opponents in the race: Bruno Von Stickle ([[Eric Braeden]]), a German driver with experience in the \"European Racing Circuit,\" Claude Gilbert (Mike Kulcsar), a French driver, and Diane Darcy ([[Julie Sommars]]), a beautiful young woman and the only female driver in the Trans-France Race. She initially hates Jim for apparently his, but what was actually Herbie's, knee-jerk behavior that ruin her chances of succeeding during the first qualifying rounds. This was because of Herbie seeing and falling in love at first sight with Giselle, her [[Lancia Montecarlo#Lancia Scorpion|Lancia Scorpion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22486/lot/137/?category=list|work=[[Bonhams]]|title=1976 LANCIA SCORPION|date=November 23, 2015|access-date=May 22, 2020}}</ref> Herbie's infatuation with Giselle results in him compromising the plan to win the Trans-France Race, turning against Jim and Wheely. However, the strong-willed Diane does not appear to believe in any cars that can be alive and have a mind of their own.\n\nDiane and Giselle crash into a lake towards the end of the race. After being rescued by Herbie and Jim, Diane's attitude toward Jim softens. When Herbie seems to have trouble restarting because of being determined to stay with Giselle, Diane begins to understand that cars can have minds of their own. She encourages Herbie not to relent in the quest for victory in the Trans-France Race. With Diane now out of the race, Jim pursues Von Stickle through the streets of Monte Carlo, leading to a thrilling duel for the win. Herbie takes the lead by driving upside down on a tunnel roof, and Jim drives Herbie to victory for the 20th time in their careers.\n\nAs the film progresses, two thieves, Max ([[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]]) and Quincey ([[Roy Kinnear]]), steal the famous ''\u00c9toile de Joie'' (French for \"Star of Joy\") diamond and cleverly hide it in Herbie's fuel tank (Herbie was fitted with an external fuel filler cap for this film - a 1963 Beetle's cap actually being inside the front luggage compartment) in order to avoid being captured by a swarm of searching policemen. But little did they know that they picked the wrong car to hide it in, because it was alive and had a mind of its own. That causes them to blow every chance they get in getting back the diamond they hid inside him. Because of this, and on account of an attempt where they tried to threaten Jim and Wheely at gunpoint to relinquish the car to them, an encounter from which Herbie managed to escape, and thanks to a misunderstood conclusion thereafter that Diane would have tried to mastermind the whole event. Subsequently, Herbie is placed under the protection of the French police. \nIt is also revealed not too far in that Inspector Bouchet ([[Jacques Marin]]), also known as \"Double X\" as a code name to the thieves, is the mastermind behind the museum robbery, though the fact of his scheme is revealed near the end of the movie. It is the eager, and somewhat knee-jerk and unpunctual young detective Fontenoy ([[Xavier Saint-Macary]]), of whom the Inspector is the superior officer, who unravels the mystery of L'\u00c9toile de Joie, and has Bouchet clapped in handcuffs.\n\nIn the end, Jim and Diane begin to fall in love, as do Wheely and the Monte Carlo trophy girl. Most of all, Herbie and Giselle (which Diane names her car) fall in love again as well.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as James \"Jim\" Douglas\n* [[Don Knotts]] as Cory \"Wheely\" Applegate\n* [[Julie Sommars]] as Diane Darcy\n* [[Jacques Marin]] as Inspector Bouchet\n* [[Roy Kinnear]] as Quincey\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as Max\n* [[Eric Braeden]] as Bruno Von Stickle\n* [[Xavier Saint-Macary]] as Detective Fontenoy\n* Fran\u00e7ois Lalande as Monsieur Ribeaux, The Owner of The Museum \"\u00c9toile de Joie\" Diamond\n* [[Alan Caillou]] as Emile, The Chief Monaco Official\n* [[Laurie Main]] as Duval, The Museum Guard\n* Mike Kulcsar as Claude Gilbert\n* [[Johnny Haymer]] as Race Official\n* Stanley Brock as Taxi Driver\n* [[G\u00e9rard Jugnot]] as The Waiter\n* Jean-Marie Proslier as Doorman\n* Tom McCorry as Showroom M.C.\n* Lloyd Nelson as The Mechanic\n* Jean-Jacques Moreau as Truck Driver\n* Yveline Bri\u00e8re as Girl Friend\n* S\u00e9bastien Floche as French Tourist\n* Madeleine Damien as Old Woman\n* Alain Janey as Man At Caf\u00e9\n* Raoul Defosse as Police Captain\n* Ed Marcus as Exhibit M.C.\n* [[Dick Warlock|Richard Warlock]], Gerald Brutsche, Kevin Johnston, Bob Harris, [[Carey Loftin]], Jesse Wayne, Bill Erickson as The Drivers\n* [[Katia Tchenko]] as Monte Carlo Trophy Girl (uncredited)\n* [[Josiane Balasko]] as Woman In The Crowd (uncredited)\n* Andr\u00e9 Penvern as French Policeman (uncredited)\n\n==Promotion==\n\n===Mann's Chinese Theatre===\nOn July 11, 1977, [[Herbie]] joined other immortals of the silver screen when he placed his wheel-prints in cement in the forecourt of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood, California]]; the ceremony was also attended by the film's stars [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]], [[Don Knotts]] and [[Julie Sommars]], as well as several hundred guests and tourists.
