''Maggie'' is a dramatic departure for Schwarzenegger, who is better known for his [[action film]] roles.\n\nThe film was originally set to have its world premiere at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]], but Lionsgate bought the American distribution rights and pulled the film out of the festival's roster.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/movies/index.ssf/2014/08/arnold_schwarzeneggers_nola-sh.html|title=Arnold Schwarzenegger's NOLA-shot 'Maggie' lands distribution deal, plus more Hollywood South headlines|last=Scott|first=Mike|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}</ref> It instead premiered at the 2015 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 23, 2015, as part of their lineup,<ref name=\"tribecafilm1\"/> followed by a limited theatrical release and simultaneous [[Video on demand|VOD]] release on May 8, 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the present-day [[Midwestern United States]], society struggles to function in the aftermath of a [[zombie]] pandemic (Necroambulism) barely under control. Maggie Vogel calls her father from a broken city under [[curfew]]; her voicemail urges that he not seek her and that she loves him. Her arm was bitten. Knowing she has only weeks before the \"Necroambulist virus\" turns her cannibalistic, she left home to protect her family. Maggie's father Wade has searched two weeks, despite her warning. Finding her in a hospital for the infected, he brings Maggie home to care for her until she must eventually be [[quarantine]]d. During their return, a zombie attacks Wade at an abandoned gasoline station and he breaks its neck.\n\nAt home, Maggie's younger half-siblings Bobby and Molly are leaving to stay with their aunt. Maggie talks to Bobby, who mostly understands what she is undergoing. She withdraws from her family, struggling to cope with her hopeless situation and torn about contacting her friends. Falling from a swing, she breaks a finger on her infected arm, from which black fluid oozes. Terrified, even though she feels little or no pain, and despairing over her deteriorating body, Maggie cuts off the finger. She flees outside and encounters a neighbor, Nathan, and his young daughter, both senseless with infection. Wade kills both zombies but feels extreme remorse. The responding sheriff and deputy consider Wade blameless, instead blaming Nathan's wife Bonnie, who hid her infected family from the authorities. Bonnie visits Wade that night, decrying the dehumanizing treatment of the infected and revealing that Nathan had locked himself in with his sick daughter, becoming infected himself, rather than abandon her to death among strangers in quarantine.\n\nA sympathetic doctor lies to Maggie and on her medical report about the progress of her infection, but warns Wade that, if he wishes to spare Maggie quarantine, he will have to [[euthanasia|euthanize]] her himself, either with an extremely painful drug cocktail, or by \"making it quick\". Wade and Maggie make the most of their remaining days, reminiscing about Maggie's deceased mother. Despite Maggie's physical deterioration (she's woken by maggots wriggling in her dying arm) she struggles to maintain normality. She attends a bonfire with a high school friend, Allie, and an infected boy, Trent, whom Maggie previously dated, and whom she kisses. He tells rumors of horrible conditions at the quarantine facilities, saying he would die before going there.\n\nOne day, Maggie smells food near her stepmother Caroline, though Caroline smells nothing and muses that Wade must be cooking downstairs. Finding the kitchen empty, Caroline realizes in horror that Maggie has begun to smell living flesh, in this case Caroline's, as food. Maggie receives a desperate call from Trent. At his home, Trent has locked himself inside his bedroom after he too felt hunger smelling another human, his father. Maggie tries to comfort him but watches helplessly as the police forcibly remove Trent to quarantine.\n\nBack home, Maggie encounters a trapped fox in the woods. Later she runs into her home, hysterical and coated in blood, admitting through tears to her frightened parents that she wanted to free the fox but then couldn't stop herself from attacking it. Wade shoots the half-eaten fox. Caroline departs and urges Wade it's time Maggie is taken away. Two officers arrive and Wade fights one of them before Maggie appears, assuring them she has not yet turned. The sympathetic sheriff leaves Wade with a warning that he'd better decide what to do with her before they next come to check on Maggie.\n\nWade shows Maggie white daisies he's grown in her mother's old garden, \"Daisy\" being a nickname he sometimes uses for Maggie. She thanks him for the garden's beauty, but also begs him to promise that he will \"make it stop\" before she grows worse. Later, Wade sits alone with his shotgun, still unable to use it. He pretends to sleep when Maggie approaches, her skin now gray and her eyes blackened. She lingers over him, smelling him, seemingly on the edge of self-control, before kissing his forehead. Maggie goes outside. Wade, seeing a shell on the floor, puts it in the shotgun. Maggie has climbed to the roof and jumps off, her last memories being of herself as a child frolicking outdoors with her mother, picking a daisy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columnslist|\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Wade Vogel\n* [[Abigail Breslin]] as Maggie Vogel\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Caroline Vogel\n* Douglas M.

The result is a close-up study of his limitations as an actor, and a genuinely sad piece of work that he handles well.\" McWeeny also comments, \"Breslin does solid work as a girl who has to grapple with the idea that she will not be able to enjoy the joys of adulthood, and who knows full well what her suffering is going to do to her father.... I honestly wish I liked the film more, but at this point, we've seen a whole lot of zombie movies, and while this one tries to find a new way into the idea, it doesn't do anything particularly new.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://uproxx.com/hitfix/review-schwarzenegger-tries-to-stretch-in-slow-burn-zombie-film-maggie/|title=Schwarzenegger tries to stretch in slow-burn zombie film 'Maggie'|last=McWeeny|first=Drew|publisher=Uproxx|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=October 23, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Blood List]]\n* ''[[I Am Legend (film)#Development|I Am Legend]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://maggiethefilm.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|1881002}}\n* {{AllRovi title|583915}}\n* {{Mojo title|maggie}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|maggie_2015}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maggie}}\n[[Category:2015 films]]\n[[Category:2015 horror films]]\n[[Category:2015 independent films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about viral outbreaks]]\n[[Category:American post-apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:American zombie films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Roadside Attractions films]]\n[[Category:Vertigo Films films]]\n[[Category:American dystopian films]]\n[[Category:American horror drama films]]\n[[Category:2015 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2015 drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
