The film involves the hunt for a paid assassin. It is a loose remake of the 1973 film ''[[The Day of the Jackal (film)|The Day of the Jackal]]'', which starred [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]], and was based on the 1971 [[The Day of the Jackal|novel of the same name]] by [[Frederick Forsyth]]. Although the film earned mostly negative reviews from critics, it was a commercial success and grossed $159.3 million worldwide against a $60 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nA joint operation between the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|MVD]] in [[Moscow]] leads to the killing of the younger brother of the [[Azerbaijani mafia]] leader Terek Murad. In retaliation, Murad hires an international [[hitman]], operating under the codename \"the [[Jackal (The Day of the Jackal)|Jackal]]\", to assassinate an unidentified prominent American for $70 million. Two weeks later, the MVD capture and interrogate one of Murad's henchmen, Viktor Politovsky in [[Porvoo]], [[Finland]], and discover the assassination plot. The interrogation, coupled with recovered documents, leads the FBI and MVD to suspect that FBI Director Donald Brown is the intended target.\n\nUsing a series of disguises and stolen IDs, the Jackal prepares for the assassination attempt. FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston and Russian Police Major Valentina Koslova turn to imprisoned [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] sniper Declan Mulqueen for help. They believe that his former lover, a former [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] militant and fugitive named Isabella Zancona, can identify the Jackal. Mulqueen reveals that he knows the Jackal and agrees to help in exchange for his release as well as [[Citizenship of the United States|U.S. citizenship]] and safe haven for Zancona. Mulqueen and Zancona want revenge on the Jackal after he wounded her in [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] and caused her to miscarry their unborn child. Zancona, now married, provides information to help identify the Jackal, including that he is a [[United States Army Special Forces]] veteran with combat experience from his stationing in [[El Salvador]]. Zancona discreetly slips Mulqueen a key to a drop box containing a clean passport and $10,000 cash to return to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. However, Mulqueen has given Preston his word that he will not run.\n\nMeanwhile, when the Jackal arrives in [[Montreal]] to collect a large caliber weapon, a contact notifies him that hijackers are pursuing it. The Jackal kills one hijacker and evades the others. He then hires a small-time hood/gunsmith, Ian Lamont, to build a control mount for the weapon. The Jackal demands that all design specs be turned over to him, and he also demands Lamont's complete confidentiality. When Lamont tries extorting more money from the Jackal, the Jackal kills him during a live-fire test of the weapon. The FBI discovers Lamont's remains and evidence that the Jackal intends to utilize a long-range [[heavy machine gun]] for the assassination. The Jackal sails across the [[Great Lakes]] to [[Chicago]], where he escapes the FBI and nearly kills Mulqueen. Mulqueen deduces there is a mole tipping off the Jackal. They discover that the director of the [[Embassy of Russia, Washington, D.C.|Russian Embassy in Washington DC]] gave the Jackal a direct access code to FBI records, allowing him to kill Koslova and Agents Witherspoon and McMurphy. Before dying, Koslova - passing on a taunt from the Jackal - tells Mulqueen that '[Declan] cannot protect his women'.\n\nAs the Jackal drives to [[Washington, D.C.]], Mulqueen deduces from the Jackal's mocking statement that his target is actually the [[First Lady of the United States]], who is scheduled to give a public speech. The Jackal, masquerading as a gay man, dates Douglas, a man he encountered earlier in a bar; unbeknownst to Douglas, he uses Douglas's garage to store his machine gun. When a news report exposes the Jackal's identity, he kills Douglas. On the date of the First Lady's speech, the weapon is hidden in a [[minivan]] parked near the speaker podium - the Jackal plans to shoot the First Lady via remote control. However, before the Jackal can act, Mulqueen uses a sniper rifle to destroy the weapon's scope. The Jackal blindly opens fire, and Preston takes a bullet that is fired at the First Lady. Following a chase through the [[Washington Metro]] tunnels, Zancona shoots the Jackal; however, the Jackal's gun discharges a shot, and Mulqueen is hit. While Zancona consoles Mulqueen, the Jackal, who was merely wounded, pulls another backup gun. Seeing this, Mulqueen grabs Zancona's pistol and shoots the Jackal several times, finally killing him.\n\nA few days later, Preston and Mulqueen witness the Jackal's burial in an unmarked grave. Preston reveals that he is returning to Russia to pursue Murad. He says that Mulqueen's request to be released was denied, but that he will likely be moved to a minimum security prison. Preston's heroics in saving the First Lady have enhanced his clout within the FBI. He turns his back on Mulqueen, allowing him to go free.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as [[Jackal (The Day of the Jackal)|The Jackal]]\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Declan Joseph Mulqueen\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Deputy Director]] Carter Preston\n* [[Diane Venora]] as Major Valentina Koslova, [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|MVD]]\n* [[Mathilda May]] as Isabella Celia Zancona\n* [[J.
