A. Dow, [[Jean Sullivan]], Peter MacLean, Fran Higgins and [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]]. The film takes place in the fictional town of Fly Creek, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which becomes infested with [[carnivorous]] worms after an electrical storm. Lieberman's script is based on a childhood incident in which his brother fed electricity into a patch of earth, causing [[earthworms]] to rise to the surface.\n\nMost of the financing came from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producers [[Edgar Lansbury (producer)|Edgar Lansbury]] and [[Joseph Beruh]]. Millions of worms were used over the five-week filming in [[Port Wentworth, Georgia]]; worms were brought in from Maine to augment local supplies. Makeup artist [[Rick Baker]] provided the special effects, using [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetic]]s for the first time in his career. After [[American International Pictures]] picked up ''Squirm'' for distribution, it was edited to remove the most graphic scenes in an unsuccessful attempt to lower its \"R\" [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating]] to \"PG\". The film was a commercial success, but opened to lukewarm reviews. It has since become a critical favorite and a [[Cult film|cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the rural town of Fly Creek, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], a powerful storm blows down an [[overhead power line]], leaving the area without electricity. The power line lands in wet mud and electrifies the worms underneath. The next morning, Geri Sanders borrows a truck from her neighbor, [[worm farm]]er Roger Grimes, to pick up her boyfriend Mick, who is arriving from New York City for a vacation.  While Geri and Mick go to town, Roger's shipment of 100,000 [[Glycera (annelid)|bloodworms]] and sandworms escape from the back of the truck. Mick enters a diner, where a customer says over 300,000 [[volt]]s are being released into the ground from severed power lines. He orders an [[egg cream]] and finds a worm in it, though the owner and Sheriff Jim Reston believe he placed it there himself as a prank.\n\nGeri introduces Mick to her mother Naomi and sister Alma, before they both leave to browse at antique dealer Aaron Beardsley's house. Outside, Roger's father Willie finds the shipment of worms is missing. Roger sees Mick with Geri and becomes envious of their relationship. After arriving at Beardsley's house, Geri and Mick cannot find him, but Geri sees a human skeleton outside the property. They bring over Sheriff Reston but the skeleton disappears. Thinking it is another prank, Reston threatens to arrest Mick if he returns to the town. While asking locals about Beardsley's whereabouts, they find out he was last seen before the storm. Mick believes he himself unintentionally released the worms; he apologizes to Roger and invites him to go fishing with him and Geri. They find the skeleton in Roger's truck.\n\nWhile on the boat, Mick is bitten by a worm. Roger shows his bitten-off thumb and tells Mick and Geri that worms attack when electrified. Mick gets off the boat to tend to his wound, leaving Geri with Roger; Mick and Alma take the skeleton's skull to an abandoned dental office, where they compare its teeth with [[Dental radiography|X-rays]] and confirm the skeleton is Beardsley's. Roger makes advances towards Geri, but the worms they brought as bait attack him and crawl into his face. He runs off into the woods and Geri tells Mick what happened. Mick and Geri visit the worm farm to find Roger, but Mick finds Willie's body being eaten by worms. They try telling Sheriff Reston, but he ignores them. Mick deduces the worms killed Beardsley but cannot figure out why they attacked him.\n\nWhile Mick and Geri are eating dinner with Naomi and Alma, the worms eat through the roots of a tree, causing it to crash into the house. Mick realizes electricity is still being released from the power lines and that the wet soil is acting as a conductor; he hypothesizes the worms only come out at night. Mick tells Geri to keep everyone inside equipped with candles and leaves to get plywood to board up the house. Roger, whose face has been deformed by worms, attacks Mick and knocks him unconscious. He then enters the house and kidnaps Geri. The worms infest the house and attack other places in town. Sheriff Reston and a woman are eaten alive in a jail cell, and people at a bar are attacked and eaten.\n\nMick regains consciousness and finds Naomi's remains, covered in worms, at the house. When he goes upstairs, Roger attacks and chases him downstairs. Mick pushes Roger into a pile of worms, which engulf him. Mick frees Geri and tells her that Naomi, and presumably Alma, are dead. While they try escaping through a window, Roger crawls out of the pile of worms and bites Mick in the leg. Mick beats Roger to death with a flashlight before climbing onto a tree with Geri, where they stay until morning. Upon waking up, they realize the worms had disappeared and a repairman informs them that the power has been restored. Alma, who survived by hiding in a chest, comes out and looks out the window. Geri and Mick rush into the house to meet her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Don Scardino]] as Mick\n* [[Patricia Pearcy]] as Geraldine \"Geri\" Sanders\n* R. A.

They read the script during the warm U.S. summer months of 1975, after which the project moved swiftly, with the producers buying ''Squirm'' and investing $470,000 of their own money into the project.

Return of the Repressed}} Rob Craig also commented on the sexual undercurrents in the film, arguing that in the context of the film's treatment of rural folk as \"ignorant, divisive, reactionary, corrupt, and quite possibly lunatic\", the worms can be seen as a metaphor for \"a country bumpkin's slimy, limp penis: a laughably vulnerable object by itself, but fearsomely dangerous in aggregate\", which in turn implies the rural men are \"a gaggle of 'limp noodles' which are nonetheless dangerous as a societal force\".{{sfn|Craig|2019| page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=e0CIDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA78&pg=PA349#v=onepage&q&f=false 349]}} Kyle B. Counts notes similarities between the themes of \"masculine ideals\" in ''Squirm'' and [[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|''Straw Dogs'']], in which the male leads are heroes, and also said the film does not give the impression Don Scardino's character grew into a \"man\" after his experience.<ref name=Cinefantastique/>\n\nLieberman wrote the foreword for Jon Towlson's 2014 book ''Subversive Horror Cinema: Countercultural Messages of Films from ''Frankenstein'' to the Present''. In this, he addressed the critical and scholarly analysis of ''Squirm'':\n\n{{Blockquote|quote=In my first movie, ''Squirm'' (1976), I really didn't try to make any sort of social or political comment. At least not consciously. However, soon after the movie's release, critics found some very profound subtexts which I myself wasn't aware of. Nature getting revenge on man for his disrespect of ecology. The symbolism of man's mortality and his inevitable fate of becoming worm food. Even themes of suppressed sexuality in the main characters.
