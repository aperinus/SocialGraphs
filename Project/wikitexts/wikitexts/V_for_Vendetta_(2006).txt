See [[Talk:The Matrix (franchise)#Request for Comment \u2013 Crediting The Wachowskis]]. --> It is based on the 1988 [[Vertigo Comics |DC Vertigo Comics]] limited series [[V for Vendetta |of the same title]] by [[Alan Moore]], [[David Lloyd (comics) |David Lloyd]], and [[Tony Weare]]. The film, set in a future where a [[fascist]] [[totalitarian]] regime has subjugated the UK, centres on [[V (character) |V]] (portrayed by [[Hugo Weaving]]), an [[Anarchism |anarchist]] and masked freedom-fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, and on [[Evey Hammond]] (portrayed by [[Natalie Portman]]) a young woman caught up in V's mission. [[Stephen Rea]] portrays a detective leading a desperate quest to stop V.\n\nProduced by [[Silver Pictures]], [[Virtual Studios]] and [[The Wachowskis#Film production and comic book publishing |Anarchos Productions, Inc.]], ''V for Vendetta'' was originally scheduled for release by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on 4 November 2005 (a day before the 400th [[Guy Fawkes Night]]), but was delayed; it instead opened in the United States on 17 March 2006 to mostly positive reviews from critics and became a box-office success. Alan Moore, dissatisfied with the film adaptations of his other works, [[From Hell (film)| ''From Hell'']] (2001) and [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)| ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'']] (2003), declined to watch the film and asked to not be credited or paid royalties.\n\nSome political groups have seen ''V for Vendetta'' an allegory of oppression by government; anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: \"The [[Guy Fawkes mask]] has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny\u2014and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of [[popular culture]] being used this way.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735|title=V for Vendetta masks: Who's behind them?|last= Waites|first= Rosie|date=20 October 2011|work=BBC News|access-date=20 October 2011}}\n</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Do not specify the year the film is set in; see discussion at Talk page. -->\nIn the near future, Britain is ruled by the [[Norsefire]] political party, a fascist and authoritarian regime led by High Chancellor [[Adam Susan|Adam Sutler]], which controls the populace through propaganda, and imprisons or executes those deemed undesirable, including immigrants, [[homosexuals]], and people of alternative religions.\n\n[[Evey Hammond]] is the daughter of activists who died in prison and her brother was killed in the St Mary's school terrorist attack fourteen years earlier. One evening a [[Guy Fawkes mask]]ed vigilante, \"[[V (character)|V]]\", rescues her from assault by the secret police and has her witness as his bombs destroy the [[Old Bailey]]. On November 5, V hijacks the state-run television network to address the nation, claiming credit for the attack and encouraging the populace to resist Norsefire by joining him outside the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] on [[Guy Fawkes Night]] in one year's time. Evey is knocked unconscious aiding V's escape and he takes her with him to avoid her arrest and likely execution.\n\nV kills Norsefire propagandist Lewis Prothero, Dr. Delia Surridge, and, with Evey's assistance, Anthony Lilliman the [[Bishop of London]]. Evey flees after betraying V, hoping to be forgiven by Norsefire. Assigned to capture V, Chief Inspector Eric Finch uses Surridge's journal and information from former covert operative, William Rockwood (actually V in disguise), to learn that, two decades earlier, Surridge led biological weapon research and human experimentation at the Larkhill Detention Facility on behalf of Norsefire, creating the \"St Mary's Virus\". Although dozens of political prisoners died during experimentation, an amnesiac in cell \"V\" developed mutated immunities and disfigurements as well as physical enhancements and eventually destroyed Larkhill during his escape. Peter Creedy, head of the secret police, faked a terrorist attack by releasing the virus at targets including St. Mary's, and used the resulting public fear to embed Norsefire in power, while the company manufacturing the cure enriched party members such as Prothero and Lilliman.\n\nEvey takes shelter with her former boss, talkshow host Gordon Dietrich, who shares with her his collection of illegal materials such as subversive paintings, an antique [[Quran]], and homoerotic photographs. Emboldened by Evey and V, he satirizes Sutler on his show, leading to his execution and Evey's arrest. She takes solace in a note hidden in her cell written by Valerie Page, a woman imprisoned in the cell next to V, detailing her hopes despite her impending death. Tortured and facing her own execution, Evey refuses to submit to her captors and is released, finding herself in V's lair. V had intercepted Evey before Creedy's men and subjected her to false imprisonment so she could learn to live without fear. Although initially angry at V, Evey realizes that he has been avenging Valerie and the other Larkhill victims, and promises to return to see him before November 5. To kill the otherwise unreachable High Chancellor, V convinces Creedy to kill Sutler and take his place in exchange for V's surrender.\n\nOn November 5, V has hundreds of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks distributed across the nation, leading to a rise in masked, anonymous chaos and eventually riots after the secret police kill a young masked girl. V shares a dance with Evey before leading her to the shuttered London underground he restored over the previous decade. Not intending to survive the night, V bequeaths the decision to start the explosive-filled train to Evey. Although she pleads that he abandon his crusade and leave with her, he refuses. Creedy meets V and executes Sutler before demanding V unmask, but, in spite of being shot and badly injured, he kills Creedy and his men, stating that the idea he represents is more important than his identity. V returns to Evey, dying in her arms after admitting he loves her, and Finch finds her placing V's body aboard the train, but allows her to start it after she affirms that the people need hope. With Sutler and Creedy dead, the military forces in London stand down as countless citizens dressed as V descend on Parliament and witness its destruction. Finch asks for V's true identity, to which Evey replies that \"he was all of us\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width       = 500\n| direction         = horizontal\n| align             = right\n| footer            = (Left to right) [[Natalie Portman]] (pictured in 2015), [[Hugo Weaving]] (2018), and [[Stephen Rea]] (circa 2010)\n| image1            = Natalie Portman Cannes 2015 4.jpg\n| alt1              = A photograph of Natalie Portman\n| image2            = MJK 08925 Hugo Weaving (Berlinale 2018) bw43.jpg\n| alt2              = A photograph of Hugo Weaving\n| image3            = Stephen Rea.jpg\n| alt3              = A photograph of Stephen Rea\n}}\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Evey Hammond]], an employee of the state-run British Television Network who is rescued by V from a gang of London's [[secret police]] and subsequently becomes involved in his life.\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[V (character)|V]], a masked, charismatic and skilled anarchist terrorist who had been the unwilling subject of experimentation by [[Norsefire]].

Much of the film was shot on [[sound stage]]s and indoor sets, with location work done in [[Berlin]] for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman's bedroom. The scenes that took place in the abandoned [[London Underground]] were filmed at the disused [[Aldwych tube station]]. Filming began in early March 2005 and lasted through early June 2005.<ref name=\"vendettasite\" /> ''V for Vendetta'' is the final film shot by [[cinematographer]] [[Adrian Biddle]], who died of a heart attack on 7 December 2005, 4 days prior to its world debut.<ref>Guard, Howard\n[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/19/guardianobituaries.film Adrian Biddle obituary], www.guardian.co.uk, 18 January 2006.

The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an [[undercroft]].<ref name=\"Unmasked\">{{cite video | people=Warner Bros |year=2006 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775408 | title=V for Vendetta Unmasked | medium=TV-Special | location=United States|publisher=Warner Bros.}}</ref> The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include ''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]], a ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' poster, ''[[St. Sebastian (Mantegna)|St. Sebastian]]'' by [[Andrea Mantegna]], ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]] and statues by [[Giacometti]].\nOne of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.<ref name=\"About the Production\">{{cite web| work=Official website | title=V for Vendetta&nbsp;\u2014 About the production | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_03.html | access-date=4 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Main|V for Vendetta: Music from the Motion Picture}}\nThe ''V for Vendetta'' [[film soundtrack|soundtrack]] was released by [[Astralwerks|Astralwerks Records]] on 21 March 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7042674|title=Detailed V For Vendetta Soundtrack Music Information|work=[[CD Universe]]|publisher=Muze Inc|access-date=15 January 2011}}</ref> The original scores from the film's composer, [[Dario Marianelli]], make up most of the tracks on the album.<ref name=\"tillnes2006\">{{cite web|last=Tillnes |first=John |title=Soundtrack Review: V for Vendetta by Dario Marianelli (2006) |url=http://soundtrackgeek.com/2008/03/09/soundtrack-review-v-for-vendetta-by-dario-marianelli-2006/ |work=Soundtrack Geek |publisher=Soundtrackgeek.com |access-date=13 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201043653/http://soundtrackgeek.com/2008/03/09/soundtrack-review-v-for-vendetta-by-dario-marianelli-2006/ |archive-date=1 December 2010}}</ref> The soundtrack also features three vocals played during the film: \"[[Cry Me a River (1953 song)|Cry Me a River]]\" by [[Julie London]], a cover of [[The Velvet Underground]] song \"I Found a Reason\" by [[Cat Power]] and \"Bird Gerhl\" by [[Antony and the Johnsons]].<ref name=\"tillnes2006\"/> As mentioned in the film, these songs are samples of the 872 [[Blacklisted#Political context|blacklisted]] tracks on V's [[Wurlitzer|Wurlitzer jukebox]] that V \"reclaimed\" from the Ministry of Objectionable Materials. The climax of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]'' appears at the end of the track \"Knives and Bullets (and Cannons too)\". The Overture's ''[[Finale (music)|finale]]'' is played at key parts at the beginning and end of the film.\n\nThree songs were played during the ending credits which were not included on the ''V for Vendetta'' soundtrack.<ref name=\"tillnes2006\"/> The first was \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\" by the [[Rolling Stones]]. The second was a special version of [[Ethan Stoller]]'s \"BKAB\". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from \"On Black Power\" (also in \"A Declaration of Independence\") by [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] leader [[Malcolm X]], and from \"Address to the Women of America\" by feminist writer [[Gloria Steinem]] were added to the song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: \"This is no simple reform ... It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organising human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends.\" The final song was \"[[Let It Come Down (Spiritualized album)|Out of Sight]]\" by [[Spiritualized]].\n\nAlso in the film were segments from two of [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]]'s classic [[bossa nova]] songs, \"[[The Girl from Ipanema|The Girl From Ipanema]]\" and \"[[Corcovado (song)|Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars]]\". These songs were played during the \"breakfast scenes\" with V and Deitrich and were one of the ways used to tie the two characters together. [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's ''Symphony No.5'']] also plays an important role in the film, with the first four notes of the first movement signifying the letter \"V\" in [[Morse code]].<ref name=\"graphic novel\">{{Cite book|last= Moore |first= Alan |author2=David Lloyd  |title= V for Vendetta |quote=Inspector Finch recognises the background noise as Beethoven's Fifth, and states: \"It's Morse code for the letter \"V\"\" |publisher= Vertigo |date=November 2005|isbn= 1-4012-0792-8 |title-link= V for Vendetta }}</ref><ref name=\"BBC News\">{{Cite news|publisher=BBC News | title=Newswatch 1940s | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/newswatch/history/noflash/html/1940s.stm | access-date=21 November 2006}}</ref> Gordon Deitrich's [[Benny Hill]]-styled comedy sketch of Chancellor Sutler includes the \"[[Yakety Sax]]\" theme.

Moore's comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint and in the United Kingdom under [[Titan Books]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Itzcoff | first = Dave | title = The Vendetta Behind 'V for Vendetta | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date =12 March 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/the-vendetta-behind-v-for-vendetta.html | access-date =16 November 2021}}</ref>\n\nThere are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material. Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story was changed by the Wachowskis to fit a modern [[United States|US]] political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story turned into an American-centric conflict between [[liberalism (US)|liberalism]] and [[neoconservatism]], and abandoned the original anarchist\u2013fascist themes. Moore states that \"[t]here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial purity]] had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity.\" Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story.<ref name=\"official production\" />\n\nMany of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterised in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |title=V for Vendetta the Page Vs. The Screen |access-date=26 June 2010 | url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318221050/http://www.mutantreviewers.com/rvarticle.html |archive-date=18 March 2012 }}</ref> However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]] is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. Gordon, a very minor character in both versions, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by Fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a [[Quran]] is found in his possession.<ref name=\"IGN\" />\n\n==Release==\n[[File:V for Vendetta film.jpg|thumb|''V for Vendetta'' playing at [[Odeon Luxe Leicester Square|Odeon Leicester Square]], London, March 2006]]\nThe film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]], in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England.<ref name=\"vendettasite\" /> The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of 5 November 2005, the Plot's 400th anniversary, with the tag line \"Remember, remember the 5th of November\", taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event. However, the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to 17 March 2006.

It was a response to living in [[Thatcherite]] Britain ... This is a response to the world in which we live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities.\" Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.<ref name=\"v for vendetta interviews\" />\n\n====Books====\nThe original graphic novel by Moore and Lloyd was re-released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film's original release date of 5 November 2005.<ref>{{ASIN|1401207928|title=V for Vendetta [Hardcover]}} {{ISBN|978-1-4012-0792-2}}</ref> The film renewed interest in Alan Moore's original story, and sales of the original graphic novel rose dramatically in the United States.<ref name=\"Televisionpoint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1143785410|title=V for Vendetta graphic novel is a US Bestseller|date=31 March 2006|work=televisionpoint.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119122204/http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1143785410|archive-date=19 November 2006|access-date=2 April 2006}}</ref>\n\nA novelisation of the film, written by [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]] and based on the Wachowskis' script, was published by [[Pocket Star]] on 31 January 2006.<ref>{{ASIN|1416516999|title=V for Vendetta: a Novelization}} {{ISBN|978-1416516996}}</ref> Spencer Lamm, who has worked with the Wachowskis, created a \"[[Making-of|behind-the-scenes]]\" book.
