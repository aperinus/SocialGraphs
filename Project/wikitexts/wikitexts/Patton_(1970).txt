Patton]] during [[World War II]]. It stars [[George C. Scott]] as Patton and [[Karl Malden]] as General [[Omar Bradley]], and was directed by [[Franklin J. Schaffner]] from a script by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Edmund H. North]], who based their screenplay on ''Patton: Ordeal and Triumph'' by [[Ladislas Farago]] and Bradley's memoir, ''A Soldier's Story''.\n\n''Patton'' won seven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. Scott also won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal of General Patton, but declined to accept the award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/dvd/patton |title=Review of Patton |author=TotalFilm |access-date=2006-04-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705124124/http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/dvd/patton |archive-date=July 5, 2011 }}</ref> The opening monologue, delivered by Scott as General Patton with an enormous American flag behind him, remains an iconic and often quoted image in film.

Patton]] [[George S. Patton's speech to the Third Army|addresses an unseen audience of American troops]], emphasizing the importance Americans place upon victorious role models as well as his own demands that his men defeat the enemy by working and fighting as a team.\n\nIn its first encounter with the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Afrika Korps]] at [[Battle of Kasserine Pass|Kasserine]], the [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]] is humiliatingly defeated by General [[Erwin Rommel]], whom Patton places in high regard as a well respected rival. As a consequence, Patton is placed in command of II Corps and immediately begins instilling discipline amongst his untested troops. Alongside the poor condition of American soldiers in the II Corps, Patton also identifies the stubbornness of his British counterpart; General [[Bernard Montgomery]] constantly undermines American forces in order to monopolize the war glory. Patton's chance to prove his worth comes at the subsequent [[Battle of El Guettar]] where Patton defeats the advancing German forces.\n\nThe eventual Allied victory in [[North African campaign|North Africa]] prompts both Patton and Montgomery to come up with competing plans for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily invasion]]. Patton's plan, drawn from reference to the [[Peloponnesian War]] highlights the strategic importance of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]; if it fell to an occupying force, the [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italians]] would surely withdraw. Patton proposes that Montgomery captures Syracuse, whereas he will land near [[Palermo]] then capture [[Messina]] to cut off the withdrawal. Though the plan initially impresses General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Alexander]], to whom Patton and Montgomery report, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] turns it down in favor of Montgomery's more cautious plan that the two armies land side-by-side in the south-east, essentially relegating Patton to guarding the left flank of the British advance. Angered by the lack of progress being made, Patton thrusts west and captures Palermo, before beating Montgomery to Messina. Patton's blunt aggression sits poorly with his subordinates [[Omar Bradley]] and [[Lucian Truscott]]. During a visit to a [[field hospital]], Patton notices a soldier, crying out of [[shell shock]]. Surmising that the soldier isn't actually physically injured, Patton [[George S. Patton slapping incidents|slaps the soldier]] and threatens to shoot him for his cowardice and demands he return to the frontline. Eisenhower demands Patton apologize to his entire command for the altercation. Though Patton obliges, he is stunned to find out that Bradley, not he, has been given command of American forces preparing for the invasion of France.\n\nWith the [[Operation Overlord|Invasion of Normandy]] due to start, Patton is placed in charge of the fictional [[First United States Army Group]] as a decoy in [[London, England|London]], the Allied consensus believing that his presence in England will tell the Germans that he will lead the invasion of Europe. At a war drive in [[Knutsford]], Patton openly remarks that the [[Post-war|post-war world]] will be dominated by British and American influence, seen as a slight to the [[Soviet Union]]. Though Patton objects to having done anything wrong, the situation has already spiraled from his control. The decision to send him home or keep him in England rests upon General [[George C. Marshall|George Marshall]]. Though he is not present during the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]], Patton is given command of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] by General Bradley, now his superior. Under Patton's leadership, the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|Third Army sweeps brilliantly across France]] but is unexpectedly brought to a halt when the supplies are diverted to Montgomery's ambitious [[Operation Market Garden]].\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Bulge]] Patton devises a plan to relieve the trapped [[101st Airborne Division]] in [[Siege of Bastogne|Bastogne]], which he does before smashing through the [[Siegfried Line]] and [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|into Germany]].\n\n[[End of World War II in Europe|Germany eventually capitulates]], though Patton's outspokenness lands him in trouble once again when he compares [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] to [[Nazism]]. Though he loses his command once again, Patton is kept on to see the [[Allied-occupied Germany|rebuilding of Germany]] in the post war period. In a final scene Patton is seen walking Willie, his [[Bull Terrier|bull terrier]]. Patton's voice is heard:\n\n''\"For over a thousand years, [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] - a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeters and musicians and strange animals from the conquered territories, together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children, robed in white, stood with him in the chariot, or rode the trace horses. A [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] stood behind the conqueror, holding a golden crown, and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory ... is fleeting.\"''\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[George C.

The early scene, where Patton and [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Muhammed V]] are reviewing [[Royal Moroccan Armed Forces|Moroccan troops]] including the [[Moroccan Goumier|Goumiers]], was shot at the [[Dar al-Makhzen (Rabat)|Royal Palace]] in [[Rabat]]. One unannounced battle scene was shot the night before, which raised fears in the Royal Palace neighborhood of a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]''. One paratrooper was electrocuted in power lines, but none of this battle footage appears in the film. The scene at the dedication of the welcome centre in [[Knutsford]], [[Cheshire]], England, was filmed at the actual site. The scenes set in Tunisia and Sicily were shot in [[Almeria]] in the south of Spain; [[Pamplona]] in the north was used for France and Germany; while the winter scenes in [[Belgium]], including for the [[Battle of the Bulge]] sequence, were shot near [[Segovia]] (to which the production crew rushed when they were informed that snow had fallen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2003/patton/index.htm|title=The Photography of \"Patton\"|first=George J.|last=Mitchell|website=in70mm.com|access-date=December 29, 2011|archive-date=January 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105050701/http://www.in70mm.com/news/2003/patton/index.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=photoplay/><ref name=AFI/> Interior shots were filmed in [[Seville]].<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\nThe film was shot by cinematographer [[Fred J.

Outtakes from ''Patton'' were used to provide battle scenes in the made-for-TV film ''[[Fireball Forward]]'', which was first broadcast in 1972. The film was produced by ''Patton'' producer Frank McCarthy and Edmund North wrote the screenplay. One of the cast members of ''Patton'', Morgan Paull, appeared in this production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fireball Forward - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fireball_forward/|publisher=Flixster, Inc.|access-date=12 November 2012|archive-date=September 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925074424/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fireball_forward|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Opening===\n[[Image:Patton1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The opening scene of the movie.]]\nThe film opens with Scott's rendering of [[George S.

The Duke, the Longhorns, and Chairman Mao: John Wayne's Political Odyssey.\"</ref> Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual words and statements in the scene, as well as throughout the rest of the film, to avoid an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]]; in the opening monologue, the word ''fornicating'' replaced ''fucking'' when he was criticizing ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Also, Scott's gravelly and scratchy voice is the opposite of Patton's high-pitched, nasal and somewhat squeaky voice, a point noted by historian [[S.L.A. Marshall]].<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> However, Marshall also points out that the film contains \"too much cursing and obscenity [by Patton]. Patton was not habitually foul-mouthed. He used dirty words when he thought they were needed to impress.\"<ref name=\"Marshall\" />\n\nWhen Scott learned that the speech would open the film, he refused to do it, as he believed that it would overshadow the rest of his performance. Director Schaffner assured him that it would be shown at the end. The scene was shot in one afternoon at Sevilla Studios in Madrid, with the flag having been painted on the back of the stage wall.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=George J. |title=The Photography of Patton |journal=After the Battle |date=1975 |issue=7 |pages=38\u201343 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/38610171/Patton-HQ-Magazines |access-date=September 7, 2017 |archive-date=March 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305120651/https://www.scribd.com/doc/38610171/Patton-HQ-Magazines |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAll the medals and decorations shown on Patton's uniform in the monologue are replicas of those actually awarded to Patton. However, the general never wore all of them in public and was in any case not a [[Four-star rank|four-star general]] at the time he made the famous speeches on which the opening is based. He wore them all on only one occasion, in his backyard in [[Virginia]] at the request of his wife, who wanted a picture of him with all his medals. The producers used a copy of this photo to help recreate this \"look\" for the opening scene.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Music===\nThe critically acclaimed score for ''Patton'' was composed and conducted by the prolific composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]]. Goldsmith used a number of innovative methods to tie the music to the film, such as having an [[echoplex]] loop recorded sounds of \"call to war\" [[Tuplet#Triplets|triplets]] played on the trumpet to musically represent General Patton's belief in reincarnation. The main theme also consisted of a symphonic march accompanied by a [[pipe organ]] to represent the militaristic yet deeply religious nature of the protagonist.<ref name=\"Filmtracks\" >Clemmensen, Christian.

Another unusual element of the telecast was that almost none of Patton's profanity-laced dialogue was cut (only two sentences, one of which contained no profanity, were cut from the famous opening speech in front of the giant US flag). The film was the fourth highest-rated film broadcast on television in the United States at the time, with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 38.5 and an audience share of 65%.<ref name=ratings>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=24 January 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nIn 1977, ''Patton'' was among the first 50 [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] releases from [[Magnetic Video]]. The film would be released on [[LaserDisc|Laserdisc]] in 1981, also by Magnetic Video. A widescreen version was released in 1989, which includes four newsreels about the real Patton. A [[THX]]-certified Laserdisc would be released on July 9, 1997, trading the newsreels for many new features. A THX-certified widescreen VHS was also released in 1998 by the same distributor, [[20th Century Studios Home Entertainment|20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].\n\n''Patton'' was first released on [[DVD]] in 1999, featuring an audio commentary by '''Charles M. Province''', the founder of '''The George S. Patton, Jr. Historical Society''', and again in 2006, with a commentary by screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola and extra bonus features.\n\nThe film made its [[DVD region code|Region A]] (locked) [[Blu-ray]] debut in 2008 to much criticism, for its excessive use of [[digital noise reduction]] on the picture quality.

Nixon became obsessed with the film, repeatedly watching it with [[Henry Kissinger]] over the next month. He screened it several times at the [[White House]] and during a cruise on the presidential yacht [[USS Sequoia (presidential yacht)|USS ''Sequoia'']] in the [[Potomac River]]. Kissinger sarcastically wrote of Nixon's insistence that he see the film on the cruise: \"It was the second time he had so honored me.
