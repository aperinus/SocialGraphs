[[Dianne Wiest]], [[Loretta Devine]], [[Richard Schiff]], and [[Laura Dern]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nNelson and co-writer Kristine Johnson researched the issues facing adults with intellectual disabilities by visiting the non-profit organization L.A. GOAL (Greater Opportunities for the Advanced Living). They subsequently cast two actors with disabilities, Brad Silverman and Joe Rosenberg, in key roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/77829/vedder-crowes-cover-beatles-for-i-am-sam#/news/vedder-crowes-cover-beatles-for-i-am-sam-1097149.story|title=Vedder, Crowes Cover Beatles for 'I Am Sam'|publisher=billboard.com|access-date=2009-12-27}}</ref> The film's title is derived from the  lines \"I am Sam / Sam I am\" of the book ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' by [[Dr. Seuss]], which is read in the movie.\n\nThe film received polarized reviews from critics and audiences. It grossed over $97 million at the box office, against a production budget of $22 million.<ref name= \"BOM\" /><ref name=\"numbers\" /> For his role as Sam, Penn was highly acclaimed and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]] in 2002. The film launched the career of [[Child actor|child actress]] Dakota Fanning, who was then seven years old and had only acted in two small roles. She became the youngest actress to be nominated for a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1993, Samuel Dawson, a [[Starbucks]] employee with an [[intellectual disability]], becomes the single father of Lucy Diamond Dawson, named after [[The Beatles]] song \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\", following their abandonment by her mother, a homeless woman with whom Sam had a sexual encounter.\n\nSam is well-adjusted and has a supportive group of friends with disabilities, as well as a kind, [[agoraphobic]] neighbor, Annie, who takes care of Lucy when Sam cannot. Nearly eight years later in 2001, Sam provides a loving place for precocious Lucy, though she soon surpasses his mental capacity and ability.\n\nOther children bully her for having an intellectually-disabled father, and she becomes too embarrassed to accept that she is more advanced than he is. In danger of losing [[child custody]], Sam gets advice from his friends and also hires a lawyer, Rita Harrison, whose absorption in her work and neglect of her son reveals her to also struggle with her role as a parent. In an attempt to prove that she is not cold, Rita agrees to take on Sam's case ''[[pro bono]]''.\n\nAs they work to secure Sam's rights, Sam helps Rita see her own life anew. This includes encouraging her to leave her philandering husband and repair her fractious relationship with her son.\n\nAt the trial, due to pressure from the prosecutor, Sam breaks down after becoming convinced he is not capable of raising Lucy. Afterward, she resides in a foster home with Miranda \u201cRandy\u201d Carpenter but tries to convince Sam to help her run away. Sam moves so he is nearby Lucy, so she continually leaves in the middle of the night to go to his apartment, though he immediately returns her.\n\nHowever, the foster parents decide not to adopt her as they had planned and return her to Sam. Randy assures him that she will tell the judge he is the best parent for Lucy. In turn, Sam asks Randy if she will help him raise Lucy because he feels she needs a mother figure.\n\nThe final scene depicts a [[soccer]] game, in which Sam [[referees]] and Lucy participate as a player. In attendance are Lucy's former foster family, Sam's friend group, and a newly single Rita with her son.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Samuel John \"Sam\" Dawson\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Rita Harrison Williams\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as Lucy Diamond Dawson\n** Allison and Jillian Thormahlen as infant Lucy \n** Ryan Williams as 6-month-old Lucy  \n** Felicity Ann and Makindra Sherry Forbes as 18-month-old Lucy \n** [[Elle Fanning]] as 2 year old Lucy\n** Amanda Lehaf as  4 year old Lucy\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Annie Cassell\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Margaret Calgrove\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Mr. Turner\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Miranda \"Randy\" Carpenter\n* [[Marin Hinkle]] as Patricia\n* [[Stanley DeSantis]] as Robert\n* Brad Silverman as Brad\n* [[Doug Hutchison]] as Ifty\n* [[Rosalind Chao]] as Lily\n* [[Ken Jenkins]] as Judge Philip McNeily\n* [[Wendy Phillips]] as Miss Wright\n* [[Scott Paulin]] as Duncan Rhodes\n* [[Kimberly Scott]] as Gertie\n* [[Michael B.

The album contents are made up entirely of cover versions of songs by The Beatles, although it was originally intended to consist of the group's original recordings. When producers were unable to obtain the rights to the original tracks, they commissioned artists such as [[the Black Crowes]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Stereophonics]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[the Wallflowers]], [[Ben Harper]], [[The Vines (band)|the Vines]], and [[Ben Folds]] to record the versions released. Penn's brother, [[Michael Penn]], is also featured on a duet with his wife [[Aimee Mann]].\n\nAs the movie had been shot and produced to the original Beatles music, the artists had to record their covers to the same [[musical timing]] ([[tempo]]) as that of [[the Beatles]]' original pieces.<ref>{{Citation |title=I Am Sam (2001) - IMDb |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277027/trivia/ |access-date=2022-03-23}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 35% based on reviews from 145 critics, with an average rating of 4.77/10.
