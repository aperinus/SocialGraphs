An [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] by [[Bill Naughton]] of his own 1966 novel and 1963 [[Alfie (play)|play of the same name]], the film was released by [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\n''Alfie'' tells the story of a young womanising man who leads a self-centred life, purely for his own enjoyment, until events force him to question his uncaring behaviour, his loneliness and his priorities. He cheats on numerous women, and despite his confidence towards women, he treats them with disrespect and refers to them as \"it\", using them for sex and for domestic purposes. Alfie frequently breaks the [[fourth wall]] by speaking directly to the camera narrating and justifying his actions. His words often contrast with or totally contradict his actions.\n\nThe film had its World Premiere at the Plaza Theatre in the [[West End of London]] on 24 March 1966. A box office success, it received critical acclaim and is an influential part of British cinema.\n\n==Plot==\nAlfie Elkins, a handsome [[Cockney]], self-centered, narcissistic chauffeur in London enjoys the sexual favours of married and single women, while avoiding commitment. He is ending an affair with Siddie, a married woman, just as he gets his submissive single girlfriend, Gilda, pregnant. Alfie thinks nothing of pilfering fuel and money from his employer and tells Gilda to do the same. Although he refuses to marry her, and despite his constant cheating, Gilda decides to have the child, Malcolm Alfred, and keep him rather than give him up.\n\nOver time, Alfie becomes quite attached to his delightful son, but his unwillingness to marry Gilda causes her to break up with him and marry Humphrey, a kindly bus conductor and neighbour. He loves her and is willing to accept Malcolm Alfred as his own. Gilda bars Alfie from any further contact with Malcolm, forcing him to watch from a distance as Humphrey steps into his fatherly role. When a health check reveals Alfie has [[Tuberculosis|tubercular shadows on his lungs]], the diagnosis, and his fear of death, combined with his separation from his son, leads him to have a brief [[mental breakdown]].\n\nAlfie spends time recuperating in a pastoral sanitorium, where he befriends Harry, a fellow patient, a family man devoted to his frumpy wife Lily. Alfie makes out with one of the nurses, disgusting Harry. Alfie thinks nothing of cheating, lying, stealing, or taking other men's wives. When Alfie flippantly suggests that Lily might be cheating on him, Harry angrily confronts Alfie about his attitudes and behaviour.\n\nReleased from the convalescent home, Alfie briefly stops working as a chauffeur to take holiday photos of tourists near the [[Tower of London]]. Here he meets Ruby, an older, voluptuous, affluent and promiscuous American, who, although she is accompanied by an older gentleman, gives him her address and telephone number.\n\nAlfie returns to chauffeuring and drives a Rolls Royce to the sanitorium to visit Harry. He finds Lily finishing a visit with her husband, who asks him to give his wife a ride back to London to save her an exhausting train ride. Neither initially want to spend time together, but they agree in order to please Harry. Along the way, they stop for tea and then a canoe ride where he seduces her.\n\nLater, chauffeuring in the Rolls again, Alfie sees a young red-headed hitchhiker, Annie, who wants a fresh start in London. A lorry driver picks her up just before Alfie gets to her. He follows them to a cafe and steals her away to London. She moves into his bedsit where she proves preoccupied with a love left behind, scrubbing Alfie's floor, doing his laundry, and preparing his meals to compensate. The lorry driver finds him in a pub, punches him in the face and a barroom brawl ensues.\n\nComing home with a big black eye, Alfie grows resentful of Annie and drives her out with an angry outburst, immediately regretting it. Around the same time, Lily informs him that she is pregnant from their one encounter, and they plan for her to have an abortion. Lily comes to his flat to meet the abortionist. During the procedure, Alfie leaves Lily and walks around. He catches sight of his son Malcolm outside a church and witnesses the baptism of Gilda and Humphrey's new daughter. He watches as they exit the church as a family. The abortion traumatizes both Lily and Alfie, with him breaking down in tears when seeing the aborted fetus, the first time he confronts the consequences of his actions.\n\nThe stress of the situations with Annie and Lily makes Alfie decide to change his non-committal ways and settle down with the rich Ruby. However, visiting her, he finds a younger man in her bed. He comes across Siddie, (the married woman from the beginning of the movie), but she has lost interest in him and returned to her husband. Alfie is left lonely, wondering about his life choices, then asks the viewers \"What's it all about? You know what I mean.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Alfie Elkins\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Ruby\n* [[Millicent Martin]] as Siddie\n* [[Vivien Merchant]] as Lily Clamacraft\n* [[Jane Asher]] as Annie\n* [[Julia Foster]] as Gilda\n* [[Shirley Anne Field]] as Carla\n* [[Eleanor Bron]] as the Doctor\n* [[Denholm Elliott]] as the Abortionist\n* [[Alfie Bass]] as Harry Clamacraft\n* [[Graham Stark]] as Humphrey\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as Nat\n* [[Sydney Tafler]] as Frank\n* [[Queenie Watts]] (''uncredited'') as the Blonde Pub Singer\n* [[Pauline Boty]] (''uncredited'') as Laundress\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film is unusual in that it has no opening credits and the end credits feature photos of the principal actors, as well as of the main technical crew, including director Gilbert and cameraman Otto Heller.\n\n===Casting===\nSeveral leading actors, including [[Richard Harris]], [[Laurence Harvey]], [[James Booth]] and [[Anthony Newley]] turned down the title role due to the then-taboo subject matter. Despite having played \"Alfie\" on Broadway, [[Terence Stamp]] categorically declined to reprise the role on film, so he and casting agents approached his good friend and then roommate [[Michael Caine]]: not one to then snub a role about a [[Everyman|common man]], Caine agreed to do it.

It features Rollins with [[J.J.

The site's consensus states: \"Anchored by Michael Caine's charmingly droll performance, Alfie is an equally raucous and heart-rending portrait of romance in the Swinging '60s.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000581-alfie/ | title=Alfie (1966)| publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=18 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]], film reviewer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', singled out Vivien Merchant's acting for particular praise:\n{{blockquote| There must be an abortion\u2014a miserable and tragic thing, which Lewis Gilbert, who produced and directed, makes us sense in all its shabbiness and shame.

An updated [[Alfie (2004 film)|2004 remake]] starred [[Jude Law]] in the title role.\n\n===References in popular culture===\n* Much of the film's dialogue was sampled by the band [[Carter USM]] for their 1991 album ''[[30 Something]]''.\n* The LP, ''Nino Tempo's Rock 'N Roll Beach Party'' (1956 Liberty Records ... LRP3023) can be seen hanging in Alfie's apartment in several key scenes.\n* New York [[post-hardcore]] band [[Polar Bear Club]] references \"Alfie Elkins '66\" in their song \"Drifting Thing\" off their 2009 release ''[[Chasing Hamburg]]''.\n* The soundtrack to ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (in which Caine co-stars) contains a song entitled \"Alfie (What's It All About Austin)\" performed by [[Susanna Hoffs]]. This song is a cover of the original film's title song, with all occurrences of \"Alfie\" replaced with \"Austin\". A [[deleted scene]] has the cast performing the song.\n* The film inspired [[The Divine Comedy (band)|The Divine Comedy]]'s ''[[Casanova (The Divine Comedy album)|Becoming More Like Alfie]]'', which samples its opening dialogue in its introduction.\n* Guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] quoted the title song's melody in his instrumental showpiece [[Over Under Sideways Down|\"Jeff's Boogie\"]], released a few months after the film's premiere.\n* Singer/songwriter [[Tori Amos]] performed the theme as part of her repertoire as a teen, and references it in the song \"Gold Dust\" from her 2002 album ''[[Scarlet's Walk]]''.\n* British Pop Art artist, [[Pauline Boty]] makes a brief appearance as the manageress of a Dry-Cleaner's whom Alfie visits for sex. Boty died just over three months after the film's UK premiere.\n\n==See also==\n* [[BFI Top 100 British films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{cite web| url=http://caine-home.narod.ru/60-16/60-16.html| title=Michael Caine's Russian Home| publisher=caine-home.narod.ru| language=ru| access-date=31 March 2008}}, Screenshots from the film\n\n{{Alfie}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Awards for ''Alfie''\n| list =\n{{Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize}}\n{{Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film}}\n}}\n{{Lewis Gilbert}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1966 plays]]\n[[Category:1966 films]]\n[[Category:1966 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:British comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:British sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:Casual sex in films]]\n[[Category:Films about abortion]]\n[[Category:Films about adultery in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lewis Gilbert]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot in London]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Plays by Bill Naughton]]\n[[Category:1960s British films]]"}]}}}}
