It was followed by ''[[Shadow of the Thin Man]]'' (1941).\n\n==Plot==\nNick and Nora Charles are back in New York with Asta and their son Nicky Jr. They are invited by Colonel Burr MacFay to spend the weekend at his house on [[Long Island]]. McFay, the former business partner of Nora's father and the administrator of her fortune, desperately wants Nick to put his well-known detective skills to work, as he has been receiving death threats from a shady character named Phil Church. When MacFay is killed, Church seems to be the obvious suspect, but Nick is skeptical, suspecting more than a simple murder. MacFay's housekeeper, his adopted daughter, and various hangers-on all may have had an interest in killing him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Powell]] as Nick Charles\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as Nora Charles\n* [[Virginia Grey]] as Lois MacFay\n* [[Otto Kruger]] as Assistant District Attorney Van Slack\n* [[C.
