The film is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of Willimon's 2008 play ''[[Farragut North (play)|Farragut North]]''. It stars [[Ryan Gosling]] and Clooney alongside [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Marisa Tomei]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Evan Rachel Wood]].\n\n''The Ides of March'' was featured as the opening film at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] and at the 27th [[Haifa International Film Festival]], and was shown at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news |title=TIFF 2011: U2, Brad Pitt, George Clooney Films Featured At 2011 Toronto International Film Festival |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/07/26/tiff-brad-pitt-2011-george-clooney-u2_n_909633.html#s316195&title=U2 |access-date=25 August 2011 |work=[[HuffPost]]|agency=[[The Canadian Press]] |date=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=Evans2011>{{Cite journal  | title = Ides of March premiere photos | url = http://www.digitalhit.com/galleries/40/579/\n | year = 2011 | author = Evans, Ian | website = DigitalHit.com | access-date = 2012-03-20 }}</ref> It received a [[Wide release|wide theatrical release]] on 7 October 2011, and grossed $76 million worldwide. The film received positive reviews from critics and was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2011#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2011]]. Gosling earned a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|his performance]], while Clooney, Heslov and Willimon were nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nStephen Meyers is the junior campaign manager for [[Governor of Pennsylvania]] Mike Morris, who is competing against [[Arkansas]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] Ted Pullman in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary]]. Both campaigns are vying for the endorsement of Senator Franklin Thompson, who controls 356 [[Delegate (American politics)#Democratic Party|delegate]]s; these would clinch the nomination for either candidate. At the Morris campaign's headquarters in [[Cincinnati]], Meyers receives a call from Tom Duffy, Pullman's campaign manager; Duffy asks him to meet in secret at a local bar. Meyers calls his boss, Morris campaign manager Paul Zara, who does not answer. Meyers decides to meet with Duffy anyway and Duffy offers him a position in Pullman's campaign; Meyers refuses. When Zara calls back, Meyers does not tell him about the meeting.\n\nMeyers starts a sexual relationship with Molly Stearns, an attractive intern whose father is the chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. Meyers admits to an angry Zara that he met with Duffy, who said that Pullman will offer Thompson the position of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in exchange for his endorsement. Zara and Meyers discuss the matter with Morris, saying they must make the same offer to Thompson. Morris refuses on principle, as he thoroughly disagrees with Thompson and his policies, and wants a \"clean\" campaign without such deals.\n\nWhile Molly is sleeping, Meyers picks up her phone by mistake and finds that Morris is trying to call her. He discovers that Molly and Morris had a brief sexual liaison several weeks previously shortly after Molly arrived on the campaign in [[Iowa]], and Molly is now pregnant with Morris' child. Molly needs $900 for an [[abortion]], but cannot tell her father because her family is [[Catholicism|Catholic]]. Meyers helps her with the money but warns her not to tell anybody and fires her from the campaign to make the problem go away. Ida Horowicz, a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', reveals to Meyers that an anonymous source leaked his meeting with Duffy and that she plans to publish an article unless Meyers gives her the details about the Morris campaign's overtures to Thompson.\n\nAfter dropping Molly off at the abortion clinic, Meyers goes to Zara for help. Zara reveals that he leaked the meeting to Ida with Morris's approval as a pretext for firing Meyers over his purported disloyalty. An angry and desperate Meyers offers his services to Duffy, who says he met with Meyers only to influence his opponent's operation, under the likelihood that Meyers either would come to work for him or would be fired for taking the meeting. Meyers offers to sell out Morris but Duffy declines, believing Thompson's endorsement of Pullman is assured. Meyers berates Duffy for using him, for which Duffy halfheartedly apologizes, and advises him to quit politics before he becomes a cynic like Duffy.\n\nHaving been told that Meyers had threatened to take down the campaign, Molly fatally overdoses on pills in a hotel room. Meyers comes across the scene and steals her phone. Unbeknownst to the Morris campaign, he meets with Thompson to set the conditions for his endorsement and his delegates. Meyers confronts Morris and gives him an [[ultimatum]]: Either give him Zara's job and offer Thompson the post of Vice President, or Meyers will go to the press with Molly's purported [[suicide note]] and expose the affair, all but assuring Morris's reputation tarnished and Pullman getting Thompson's endorsement. Morris relents, giving up what is left of his personal integrity, and meets Meyers' demands. Zara takes his firing philosophically and is amicable when he chats with Meyers at Molly's funeral.\n\nThompson officially endorses Morris, making him the ''de facto'' Democratic nominee. Promoted to senior campaign manager, Meyers is on the way to a remote TV interview with [[John King (journalist)|John King]] when Ida Horowicz ambushes him and says her next story will be about how Meyers delivered Thompson and his delegates and got his promotion. He reacts by having security bar Horowicz from entering the auditorium. Meyers takes his seat for the interview, just as Morris finishes a speech about how integrity and dignity matter. King then asks Meyers for insight as to how the events surrounding the primary unfolded.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Stephen Meyers, Morris' junior campaign manager.<ref name=\"/Film\" />\n* [[George Clooney]] as Mike Morris, Governor of Pennsylvania and a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate.<ref name=\"/Film\" />\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Paul Zara, Morris' campaign manager and Meyers's superior and mentor.<ref name=\"NYTimesCast\">{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/451477/Farragut-North/cast |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130074230/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/451477/Farragut-North/cast |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 January 2013 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=The Ides of March (2011) |access-date=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Tom Duffy, Ted Pullman's campaign manager.<ref name=\"Vareity1\" />\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Molly Stearns, an intern for Morris's campaign<ref name=\"Vareity1\" /> and Meyers' love interest.\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Ida Horowicz, a reporter for the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref name=\"Vareity1\" />\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as Franklin Thompson, Democratic Senator from North Carolina.\n* [[Max Minghella]] as Ben Harpen,<ref name=\"NYTimesCast\" /> a member of Morris's campaign staff.\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Cindy Morris, wife to Governor Mike Morris and the First Lady of Pennsylvania. \n* [[Gregory Itzin]] as former Senator Jack Stearns, father of Molly Stearns and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.\n* Michael Mantell as Ted Pullman, Senator from Arkansas and Morris's opponent in the Democratic primaries.\n\n==Production==\nIn October 2010, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Clooney signed on to produce, direct, and star in the [[film adaptation]] of Beau Willimon's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[[Farragut North (play)|Farragut North]]''.
