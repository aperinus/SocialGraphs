It is directed by [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]] and written by [[Max Landis]], and stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Jessica Brown Findlay]], [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]], and [[Charles Dance]]. The film was released by [[20th Century Fox]] on November 25, 2015.\n\nTold from Igor's perspective, it shows the troubled young assistant's dark origins and his redemptive friendship with the young medical student, Victor Frankenstein. Through Igor's eyes, the audience witnesses the emergence of Frankenstein as the man from the legend we know today. Eventually, their experiments get them into trouble with the authorities, and Dr. Frankenstein and Igor become fugitives as they complete their goals to use science as a way to create life from death.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Michelle|first1=Kara|title=Victor Frankenstein: A \"rip-roaring, fun adventure movie version\" of Mary Shelley's Gothic horror novel, says star who portrays the hunchback lab assistant Igor|url=http://www.celebeat.com/articles/16665/20150112/victor-frankenstein-rip-roaring-fun-adventure-movie-version-mary-shelley.htm|website=Celebeat.com|access-date=26 February 2015}}</ref> The film received generally negative reviews and became a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $34.2 million against a budget of $40 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn  1860s London, ambitious medical student [[Victor Frankenstein]] attends a circus performance, where he helps save an injured [[aerialist]], Lorelei, with the aid of a nameless hunchback who is enslaved by the circus' ringleader and harbors feelings for the girl. Impressed by the hunchback's vast knowledge of human anatomy, acquired from stolen books, Victor rescues him, drains the cyst on his back that causes his physical abnormality, and gives him a harness to improve his posture &ndash; he then names him \"Igor Straussman\" after his roommate who is not often at home. The two then become partners in Victor's ongoing experiments to resurrect life through artificial means, incurring the wrath of devoutly religious police inspector Roderick Turpin, who views their experiments as blasphemy.\n\nWhen Victor shows Igor his use of electricity to animate eyes, Igor suggests he made mistakes attaching the nerves, leading Victor to ask Igor to perform the surgical parts of his experiment. Victor procures parts from dead animals and makes Igor restore the organs, which Victor secretly uses to create a monstrous chimpanzee-like creature nicknamed \"Gordon\".\n\nIgor reunites with Lorelei, now masquerading as the mistress of a closeted gay [[baron]], upsetting Victor, who views Lorelei as a distraction. Igor invites Lorelei to a demonstration of their experiment, which goes awry when Gordon escapes and wreaks havoc through the university before being killed by Victor and Igor. Lorelei is horrified by Victor's experiments and urges Igor to stop him from pursuing the matter further, but Igor is reluctant to do so upon learning that Victor is driven by the need to atone for his indirect role in the death of his older brother, Henry, for which Victor's domineering father blames Victor.\n\nVictor is expelled from college for his unorthodox methods, but attracts the attention of his wealthy, arrogant classmate Finnegan, who wants him to create an artificial humanoid creature. Victor and Igor outline a behemoth named \"Prometheus\", but Igor's deepening relationship with Lorelei soon causes a rift between them.\n\nTurpin and his men raid Victor's laboratory, hell-bent on destroying his inventions. During the raid Igor stumbles onto the corpse of the real Igor Straussman, dead from an overdose, and the source of the eyes Victor had used in his experiments.  When he attacks Victor, Turpin loses a hand and is blinded in one eye. Victor and Igor escape in a carriage sent by Finnegan and are taken to his family's estate.  Turpin is fired from [[Scotland Yard]] for having invaded Victor's home without a warrant.\n\nFinnegan provides the scientists with the necessary funds to build Prometheus and offers them laboratory facilities at his family's estate in Scotland. Igor is suspicious of Finnegan and outraged with Victor for his treatment of the original Igor.  After a falling out, Victor departs for Scotland alone. Finnegan kidnaps and binds Igor, revealing his plans to kill Victor once Prometheus is complete and weaponize his creation. Igor is then thrown into the River Thames to drown, but manages to escape and reunites with Lorelei, who nurses him back to health.\n\nIgor and Lorelei embark to Finnegan's estate in order to rescue Victor. Igor finds Victor on the verge of using lightning to animate Prometheus. Victor ignores Igor's pleas and activates the machine. A power surge overloads the machinery, killing Finnegan and several of his employees. During the ensuing chaos, Turpin unexpectedly arrives, blaming and threatening Victor for his creation. Prometheus suddenly awakens and steps forward. Victor is initially ecstatic that the experiment has worked, sharing a brief moment with Prometheus, thinking him to be his resurrected brother Henry. Victor quickly realizes that the experiment has failed: Prometheus has no consciousness and cannot talk. The shocked Turpin opens fire on Prometheus, who goes into a rage, killing Turpin and nearly killing Victor. Returning to his senses, Victor joins forces with Igor to kill Prometheus by stabbing its two hearts.\n\nAfter regaining consciousness the next morning, Igor reunites with Lorelei, who hands him a letter written to him by Victor, in which Victor apologizes for all the suffering he caused and tells Igor that he is allowed to live his life with Lorelei. Victor informs Igor to be ready for when Victor may one day ask for his help, and recognizes that Igor was his \"greatest creation\". Victor retreats to the Scottish countryside in search of new discoveries.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[James McAvoy]] as [[Victor Frankenstein]]\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Igor (character)|Igor Straussman]]<ref
