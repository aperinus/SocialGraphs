The plot follows wealthy businessman Charles Morse (Hopkins), photographer Bob Green (Baldwin), and assistant Stephen (Harold Perrineau), who must trek through the elements and try to survive after their plane crashes down in the Alaskan wilderness; all while being hunted by a large [[Kodiak bear]] and the men's fraying friendships. [[Bart the Bear]], a trained Kodiak bear known for appearances in several Hollywood movies, appears in the film as the bloodthirsty Kodiak, in one of his last film roles.\n\n==Plot==\nBillionaire Charles Morse, photographer Robert \"Bob\" Green, and Bob's assistant Stephen arrive at a remote [[Alaskan]] resort with Charles's wife Mickey, a model, and a team of photographers. Styles, the proprietor of the lodge, warns everyone about leaving uncovered food out, as it will attract bears. During a surprise [[birthday party]], Mickey gives Charles a watch, while Bob gifts him a [[pocket knife]].\n\nAt a [[photo shoot]], Charles observes Bob and Mickey flirting from a distance. Short on time and missing a model, Bob decides to seek out Jack Hawk, a local hunter. Charles, Bob and Stephen fly to Jack Hawk\u2019s home, only to find a note on his door that indicates he is miles away hunting. They fly to where the man is supposed to be, but the plane strikes a flock of birds and nose-dives into a lake, killing the pilot. Charles, Bob and Stephen barely reach the shore of the lake. Lost in the crash is a book that Charles was recently given on surviving in the wild.\n\nThe three men gather wood for a fire and spend the night by the lake. The next morning, Charles uses a compass leaf to determine the direction of south. They start a hike that way, but encounter an enormous male [[Kodiak bear]]; it gives chase. Bob saves Charles as they flee over a log bridge, leaving Charles in doubt over his earlier suspicions that Bob was planning to kill him for Mickey. The group continues on and they find their way back at the lake. Distraught, Stephen distracts himself by carving a [[spear]] to fish with. He accidentally stabs his own leg and Charles tends to the wound. That night, the bear, having caught the scent of Stephen\u2019s blood, attacks their camp, devouring Stephen and chasing Charles and Bob away.\n\nCharles and Bob adapt to their harsh surroundings; while watching a squirrel fall for a trap they have constructed, they hear a rescue helicopter fly above. They run after it, yet fail to flag it down, and tensions rise when Bob expresses his disgust with Charles and his wealth in an argument. Charles rebuffs Bob, who settles down. They both resolve to walk their way back to civilization and abandon the remote hope of being found.\n\nAfter hiking for some time, Charles and Bob reach a creek. Charles tries to catch a fish, but is ambushed by the bear and falls back to the campsite Bob is putting together. The bear stalks them throughout the night. Charles realizes that as long as this persists, they will be unable to forage for essentials, and decides that they have to kill the bear in order to survive. The following day, the pair lure the bear into a trap and engage it in a direct battle with spears. The bear wounds Bob but Charles stabs it and the bear advances on him. It rears onto its hind legs and collapses on Charles\u2019s spear, impaling itself. Charles and Bob feast and celebrate afterwards.\n\nSometime later, brought together by their new comradeship, Charles and Bob come across an empty cabin along a river. Charles notices a [[deadfall trap]] outside. Inside are supplies, including a canoe, rifle, and ammunition. As Bob checks if the canoe is usable, Charles finds a receipt from the box he kept his knife in to use as [[tinder]]. The receipt contains information confirming his suspicions about Mickey\u2019s infidelities with Bob. Charles subtly confronts Bob, who reveals that he plans to kill Charles for Mickey. He orders Charles to go outside, but before he is able to shoot him with the rifle, Bob falls into the deadfall and is badly injured. Charles refuses to kill Bob and removes him from the pit to tend to his wounds. They go downriver in the canoe together.\n\nCharles stops and makes a fire to keep Bob warm. Bob apologizes for betraying Charles and says Mickey was unaware that he intended to murder him. A helicopter appears in the distance and Charles successfully attracts its attention, but Bob succumbs to his wounds just as the helicopter approaches. Brought back to the lodge, Charles reveals to his wife that he is aware of her betrayal by handing her Bob's wristwatch. When questioned by the gathered press on how his companions died, Charles emotionally states, \u201cThey died saving my life.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Charles Morse\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Bob Green\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Steve\n* [[Elle Macpherson]] as Mickey Morse\n* [[L.Q.

Footage was taken primarily in [[Alberta]].  Among the [[Alberta]] locations were [[Banff National Park]], [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]], [[Edmonton]], Thunderstone Quarries, [[Fortress Mountain Resort]] and Allarcom Studios.  Additional scenes were shot in [[Yoho National Park]] and [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] both in [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119051/locations|title = The Edge (1997) - IMDb|website = [[IMDb]]}}</ref> Filming ended on November 22, 1996.\n\nThe shooting of the film is discussed by [[Art Linson]] in his 2002 book ''What Just Happened?'', later made into [[What Just Happened (2008 film)|a film]] starring [[Robert De Niro]]. Initially called ''Bookworm'', the script was turned down by [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]] before Alec Baldwin settled on the role of Green. De Niro showed some interest in the role of Morse but ultimately declined. Baldwin's unwillingness to shave a beard that he had grown for the role is reenacted by [[Bruce Willis]] in [[Barry Levinson]]'s adaptation of Linson's book.\n\nLike many other actors who had worked with Bart the Bear, Baldwin was extremely impressed with how well-trained and docile the bear was. In interviews, he revealed that during filming he was concerned that the film simply would not work because of how docile Bart was. After the film was completed, Baldwin commented that Bart \"should send the film editor a fruit basket every day for making him look so scary.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-09-29/lifestyle/9709260451_1_bart-kodiak-william-arnold|title=Kodiak Moments Steal Show|author=Robin Berkowitz|date=September 29, 1997|work=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|publisher=Tribune Company|access-date=September 11, 2012}}</ref>  As for Hopkins, who had worked with Bart in ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'', he \"was absolutely brilliant with Bart,\" according to trainer Lynn Seus, who went on to say that Hopkins \"acknowledged and respected (Bart) like a fellow actor.

Based on 50 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received a 64% approval rating, with an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 6.38/10. The consensus reads, \"''The Edge'' is an entertaining hybrid of brainy Mamet dialogue with brawny outdoors action\u2014albeit one that sadly lacks as much bite as its furry antagonist.\"<ref name=\"rt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/edge/|title=The Edge - Rotten Tomatoes|work=[[IMDb]]|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=September 11, 2012}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]]  of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing that the filmmakers did well by not going berserk with the action sequences as other films do. He did criticize the ending, saying that:\n:\"Having successfully negotiated almost its entire 118 minutes, ''The Edge'' shoots itself in the foot. After the emotionally fraught final moments, just as we are savoring the implications of what has just happened, the screen fades to black and we immediately get a big credit for Bart the Bear. Now Bart is one helluva bear (I loved him in the title role of ''[[The Bear (1988 film)|The Bear]]''), but this credit in this place is a spectacularly bad idea.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-edge-1997 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=The Edge}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nFollowing its initial release on VHS, ''The Edge'' was released on a non-[[anamorphic widescreen]] [[NTSC]] DVD in the US, with no extras, save the original theatrical trailer.
