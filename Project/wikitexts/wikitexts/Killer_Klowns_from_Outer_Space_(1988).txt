Nearby, farmer Gene Green, believing it to be [[Halley's Comet]], ventures into the woods to find the impact site. He stumbles upon a large [[circus]] tent-like structure, and he and his dog are captured by mysterious clown-like aliens known as \"Klowns\". Mike and Debbie arrive to investigate for themselves. Entering the structure, they discover a complex interior with bizarre rooms and eventually realize it is the object and a spaceship. They find a gelatinized Green encased in a [[cotton candy]]-like [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] and are spotted by a klown, who shoots popcorn at them from a [[bazooka]]-like weapon and then chases them aided by another one who uses a living [[balloon modelling|balloon]] dog.\n\nNarrowly escaping to the local police station, they report the incident to one of the officers and Debbie's ex-boyfriend, Dave Hanson, and his curmudgeonly partner, Curtis Mooney. Mike takes Dave to the site of the ship, only to find it has disappeared and left a large crater in its place. They travel to the lovers' lane, only to find all the cars abandoned and covered in the cocoon's substance. The klowns begin encasing townspeople in cocoons using toy-like [[raygun]]s. Several klowns perform pranks and mock circus acts which result in the deaths of several onlookers.\n\nMike and Dave witness a klown using [[shadow puppet]]s to shrink a crowd of people, then dump them into a bag full of popcorn, which are revealed to be klowns in larval form. Back at the police station, another klown arrives and Mooney arrests it, believing it to be a teenage prankster. Dave returns to the station to find the place ransacked and the klown using a deceased Mooney as a [[Ventriloquism#ventriloquist's dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]]. Dave shoots the alien in the nose, which causes it to spin wildly and explode.\n\nMike meets with his friends, Rich and Paul Terenzi, and using the [[Public address system|PA speaker]] on their [[ice cream truck]], they drive around town attempting to warn people of the klowns. At Debbie's house, popcorn from her earlier encounter with the klowns evolves into juvenile klowns and attacks her. As she attempts to escape, she is intercepted by the klowns, who trap her in a giant balloon. Mike, Dave, and the Terenzi's witness Debbie's capture and give chase, following the klowns to the local amusement park, where they have relocated their ship. Journeying through a funhouse, the Terenzi brothers become separated. After Dave and Mike witness a klown using a [[drinking straw]] to drink one of the gelatinized townspeople's blood, they rescue Debbie and flee into a maze full of traps.\n\nThe trio then finds themselves surrounded by a legion of klowns. The Terenzis arrive in their ice cream truck and use the PA to distract the aliens. A gargantuan klown [[marionette]], Jojo the Klownzilla, appears and destroys the ice cream truck, seemingly killing the Terenzi's, Dave creates a distraction and Mike and Debbie escape before the ship begins to take off. Dave uses his badge to pierce Jojo's nose, causing it to explode and destroy the ship. A clown car drops out of the sky and Dave emerges along with the Terenzi brothers, who miraculously survived by hiding in the ice cream truck's freezer moments before it was destroyed. \n\nAs the group watches the fireworks created by the ship's destruction, pies fall from the sky and land on their faces.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Grant Cramer]] as Mike Tobacco\n* [[Suzanne Snyder]] as Debbie Stone\n* [[John Allen Nelson]] as Dave Hanson\n* [[John Vernon]] as Curtis Mooney\n* Michael S.
