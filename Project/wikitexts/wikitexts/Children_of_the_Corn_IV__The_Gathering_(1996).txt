It is the fourth film in the [[Children of the Corn (film series)|''Children of the Corn'' series]]. The plot follows a medical student returning to her hometown in Nebraska, where she finds the children to be falling under a mysterious mass illness connected to the town's past.\n\nThe film expands upon the origins of \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows\". The film marked the first time Naomi Watts received [[Billing (filmmaking)|first billing]], and was also the debut of actor [[Mark Salling]].\n\nThe film was followed by an unrelated sequel entitled ''[[Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror]]'' (1998).\n\n==Plot==\n[[Medical student]] Grace Rhodes (Naomi Watts) returns to her hometown of [[Grand Island, Nebraska]] to take care of her [[agoraphobic]] mother June ([[Karen Black]]), who refuses to leave her yard. She is having recurring nightmares of being attacked by children. Grace must also look after her younger siblings, James and Margaret. She takes a job at Dr. Larson's local clinic, where she'd worked before. James and Margaret become ill, showing similar symptoms to those of the children in June's dreams. While working at Dr. Larson's office the next day, Grace notices that many other kids have the same symptoms. During the night all of the kids get worse as their fevers skyrocket. Suddenly it all stops and the fevers drop.\n\nLocal parents Donald ([[Brent Jennings]]) and Sandra Atkins notice that their son Marcus is acting strangely. One night, a group of children descend upon the house, led by a [[child preacher]], and Sandra is murdered in front of Marcus. The police arrive and question Donald; Marcus flees into a field and is chased by the sheriff, whom the child preacher confronts and kills. A suspect in his wife's murder, Donald goes into hiding and is taken in by two elderly sisters, Jane and Rosa ([[Marietta Marich]]).\n\nThe children stop answering to their names and claim to be other people; longtime resident Dr. Larson recognizes the names they use as those of dead children from the town's history. One night, he is killed in his office by two children. When Grace arrives the next day, his body has vanished, and the children's blood tests reveal inexplicable signs of decay and death. June's recurring nightmares start up again\u2014but she is not dreaming; it's all actually happening. She flees her house and drives away; spotting James entering an old barn, she follows him inside. She is captured and killed by the child preacher, after which children gather at the barn.\n\nGrace decides to go to Dr. Larsen's house to find him. Donald hijacks her and her car and forces her to drive at gunpoint. They go to Jane and Rosa's house. Rosa reveals that the child preacher, Josiah, was the bastard son of a local woman. He was taken in by traveling preachers and became a gifted preacher. Over the years, Josiah stopped aging and never grew out of boyhood. The traveling preachers gave him over to darkness to stunt his growth, but when word got out, they abandoned him. Josiah killed the preachers, then the townspeople burned him alive and sealed his remains in a well.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary Anne, Grace's best friend and co-worker, is attacked and killed by Josiah. Grace and Donald return to the clinic and discover that Margaret is missing, but they learn that Josiah's weakness is [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. It is also revealed that Josiah is Rosa's son. Margaret, James, Marcus, and all the other children gather at the barn and offer blood to Josiah. Marcus is a [[hemophiliac]], so he would bleed to death with even a small cut, but he cuts his hand and offers his blood to Josiah, and Margaret offers Josiah her soul. Marcus collapses from blood loss and Margaret is pulled into the pool of blood, from which Josiah emerges.\n\nDonald and Grace arrive at the barn and connect its sprinkler system to their supply of mercury. Donald fills two of his bullets with mercury and gives Grace the gun. Donald stops Marcus' bleeding, but the children try to kill him. Josiah attacks Grace, but she shoots him with a mercury bullet. She then finds the bodies of June and Dr. Larson. Josiah attacks her again, but she activates the sprinklers, which shower him with mercury. Grace slashes him with his own scythe, finally killing him. The children stop trying to kill Donald and return to normal. Grace finds Margaret; she's nearly drowned, but Grace manages to revive her.\n\nIt is revealed that Margaret is actually Grace's daughter, and that she abandoned her with June as a teenager. After the victims' funerals, Grace, Margaret, James, Donald, and Marcus all move out of Nebraska.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Grace Rhodes\n* [[Jamie Ren\u00e9e Smith]] as Margaret Rhodes\n* [[Karen Black]] as June Rhodes\n* [[Brent Jennings]] as Donald Atkins\n* Toni Marsh as Sandra Atkins\n* Lewis Flanagan III as Marcus Atkins\n* [[Mark Salling]] as James Rhodes\n* [[Brandon Kleyla]] as Josiah\n* Salle Ellis as Jane Nock\n* [[Marietta Marich]] as Rosa Nock\n* Jonathan Patterson as Charlie McLellan\n* Joshua Patterson as Scott McLellan\n* Kay Bower as Janet McLellan\n* Samaria Graham as Mary Anne \n* [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]] as Doc Rob Larson\n* Adam Lidberg as Michael\n* [[Libby Villari]] as Michael's mom\n* Stephen Earnhart as Wilks\n* James Krieg as Smits\n* Richard Gross as Sheriff Biggs\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming for ''Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering'' took place in [[Austin, Texas]] in the middle of 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://austin.com/top-10-worst-movies-filmed-austin/|work=Austin.com|title=The 10 Worst Movies Filmed in Austin|author=Webster, Stephen C.|date=June 12, 2014|access-date=September 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rclabaugh.com/corn4.html|work=Richard Clabaugh - Filmmaker|access-date=October 1, 2015|title=Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering}}</ref> According to Watts, she was paid $5,000 for her work in the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/21/naomi-watts-on-the-impossible-personal-tragedy-and-playing-princess-diana.html|newspaper=The Daily Beast|title=Naomi Watts on 'The Impossible', Personal Tragedy, and Playing Princess Diana|author=Stern, Marlow|date=December 21, 2012|access-date=October 4, 2015|quote=\"I was in Children of the Corn IV or V, and got paid $5,000 to do that whole film, but so what?\" she says. \"In retrospect, I would have loved to have had more time in my 20s playing different roles, but maybe I would've gone off course or got seduced into doing things I wasn't good at.
