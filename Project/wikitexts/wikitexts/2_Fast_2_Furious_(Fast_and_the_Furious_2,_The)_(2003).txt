The film received negative reviews from critics, with criticism for its screenplay and lack of originality, but received some praise for its lighthearted tone. ''2 Fast 2 Furious'' was a box office success, grossing over $236 million worldwide, making it the [[2003 in film#Highest-grossing films|17th highest-grossing film of 2003]] and the then-highest grossing film in the franchise. The [[standalone sequel]] film, ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'', was released in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Miami]], [[Brian O'Conner]] makes a living participating in illegal street races organized by his mechanic friend Tej Parker. After winning a race against drivers including Suki, the police show up and Brian is arrested. He is given a deal by his former boss [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Bilkins and [[U.S. Customs]] Agent Markham to go undercover and bring down Argentinian drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for clearing his criminal record. Brian agrees on the condition that he choose his partner.\n\nBrian heads home to [[Barstow, California]], where he enlists the help of Roman Pearce, a childhood friend who had served jail time and is under parole. Roman agrees, but only for the same deal Brian was offered. In Miami, Agent Monica Fuentes, undercover with Verone for a year, assists them into his organization. After acquiring confiscated vehicles and being hired by Verone as his drivers, the duo returns to a Customs/FBI hideout, where Roman confronts Markham over interference with the mission. Brian informs Bilkins and Markham that Verone plans to smuggle the money into his private jet and fly off.\n\nTo evade their [[GPS]] traces, Brian and Roman challenge a pair of [[muscle car]] drivers they raced earlier for [[Vehicle title|pink slips]]. Despite engine and power output handicaps, Brian and Roman manage to win the race and the other two cars. Roman confronts Brian about his attraction to Monica and the constant threat of Verone's men, but they patch up their differences. At a nightclub, Brian and Roman witness Verone torturing [[Miami Police Department|MPD]] Detective Whitworth into giving his men a window of opportunity to make their getaway. The next morning, Monica warns them that they will be killed once the drop is made. Despite this, Markham refuses to call off the job, claiming that it is their one chance to catch Verone.\n\nOn the day of the mission, Brian and Roman begin transporting duffel bags of Verone's money with two of Verone's men\u2014Enrique and Roberto\u2014riding along to watch them. Before the 15-minute window is set, Whitworth, the detective in charge, decides to call in the police to move in for the arrest, resulting in a high-speed chase across the city. The duo leads the police to a warehouse, where a \"scramble\" by dozens of street racers organized by Tej disorients the police. Following the scramble, the police manage to pull over the wanted cars, only to find out that they were driven by Tej and Suki.\n\nAs Brian approaches the destination point in a [[Yenko Camaro]], Enrique tells him to make a detour away from the airfield to the Tarpon Point Marina exit. Meanwhile, Roman gets rid of Roberto by using an improvised [[ejector seat]] in his [[Dodge Challenger RT|Dodge Challenger]] powered by [[Nitrous oxide engine|nitrous oxide]]. At the airfield, Customs Agents have Verone's plane and convoy surrounded, only to discover they have been duped into a decoy maneuver while Verone is at a boatyard miles away. Verone reveals he knew Monica was undercover, and gave her the wrong destination point and plans to use her as leverage. When Brian arrives at the marina, Enrique prepares to kill him; Roman appears and helps incapacitate Enrique. Verone escapes aboard his private yacht, but Brian and Roman drive the Yenko Camaro off a ramp, crashing on top of it. The duo apprehend Verone and save Monica.\n\nAs part of the deal, Markham clears Brian and Roman\u2019s criminal record, and in return Roman turns over the second half of Verone's cash. The two agree to stay in Miami, and Brian suggests opening a garage\u2014funded by a cut of Verone's cash Roman kept for themselves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Fast & Furious characters}}\n* [[Paul Walker]] as [[Brian O'Conner]], a former [[Los Angeles]] [[police officer|cop]] who became a fugitive after letting Dominic Toretto escape in the previous film who has now settled in Miami.
