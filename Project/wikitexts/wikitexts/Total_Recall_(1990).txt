The film stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Rachel Ticotin]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Ronny Cox]], and [[Michael Ironside]]. Based on the 1966 short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\" by [[Philip K. Dick]], ''Total Recall'' tells the story of Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker who receives an implanted memory of a fantastical adventure on [[Mars]]. He subsequently finds his adventure occurring in reality as agents of a shadow organization try to prevent him from recovering memories of his past as a Martian secret agent aiming to stop the tyrannical regime of Martian dictator Vilos Cohaagen (Cox).\n\nShusett bought the rights to Dick's short story in 1974 and developed a script with O'Bannon. Although considered promising, the ambitious scope kept the project in [[development hell]] at multiple studios over sixteen years, seeing forty script drafts, seven different directors, and multiple actors cast as Quaid. ''Total Recall'' eventually entered the early stages of filming in 1987 under the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] shortly before its bankruptcy. Schwarzenegger, who had long held an interest in the project but had been dismissed as inappropriate for the lead role, convinced [[Carolco Pictures]] to purchase the rights and develop the film with him as the star. On an estimated $48\u201380{{nbsp}}million budget (making it [[List of most expensive films|one of the most expensive films made]] in its time), filming took place on expansive sets at [[Estudios Churubusco]] in Mexico over six months. Cast and crew experienced numerous injuries and illnesses during filming.\n\n''Total Recall'' was anticipated to be one of the year's most successful films. On its release, the film earned approximately $261.4{{nbsp}}million worldwide, making it the [[1990 in film|fifth-highest-grossing film of the year]]. Its critical reception was mixed, with reviewers praising its themes of identity and questioning reality, but criticizing content perceived as vulgar and violent. The practical special effects were well received, earning the film an [[Special Achievement Academy Award|Academy Award]], and the score by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] has been praised as one of his best works.\n\nSince its release, ''Total Recall'' has been praised for its ambiguous ending positing whether Quaid's adventures are real or a fantasy, and it has also been analyzed for themes of authoritarianism and colonialism. Retrospective reviews have called it one of Schwarzenegger's best films and placed it among the best science fiction films ever made. Alongside comic books and video games, ''Total Recall'' has been adapted into the 1999 television series ''[[Total Recall 2070]]''. An early attempt at a sequel, based on Dick's ''[[The Minority Report]]'', became the 2002 standalone film ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and a 2012 remake, also titled ''[[Total Recall (2012 film)|Total Recall]]'', failed to replicate the success of the original.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2084, Mars is a colonized world under the tyrannical regime of Vilos Cohaagen, who controls the mining of valuable turbinium ore. On Earth, construction worker Douglas Quaid experiences recurring dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman. Intrigued, he visits Rekall, a company that implants realistic false memories, and chooses one set on Mars (with a blue sky) where he is a Martian secret agent. However, before the implant is completed Quaid lashes out, already thinking he is a secret agent. Believing Cohaagen's \"Agency\" has suppressed Quaid's memories, the Rekall employees erase evidence of Quaid's visit and send him home.\n\nEn route, Quaid is attacked by men led by his colleague Harry because Quaid unknowingly revealed his past; Quaid's instincts take over and he kills his assailants. At home, he is assaulted by his wife Lori who claims she was assigned to monitor Quaid by the Agency and their marriage is a false memory implant. He flees but is pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen's operative and Lori's real husband. A man who claims to be Quaid's former acquaintance gifts him a suitcase containing supplies and a video recording in which Quaid identifies himself as Hauser, a Cohaagen ally who defected after falling in love. According to the recording, Cohaagen brainwashed Hauser to become Quaid and conceal his secrets before securing him on Earth. Hauser instructs Quaid to return to Mars and stop Cohaagen.\n\nOn Mars, Quaid evades Richter and, following a note from Hauser, travels to Venusville, a district populated by humans and those mutated by air pollution and radiation. He meets Melina, the woman from his dreams, who knows him as Hauser and believes he is still working for Cohaagen. In his hotel room, Quaid is confronted by Lori and Dr. Edgemar from Rekall, who explains that Quaid is still at Rekall on Earth, trapped in his fantasy memory. Quaid notices Edgemar is sweating and, believing he is real, kills him. Quaid is captured by Richter's men, but Melina rescues him and Quaid kills Lori. The pair escape with taxi driver Benny to Venusville.\n\nThe mutants lead them to a hidden rebel base, where Quaid meets their leader Kuato, a mutant growing out of the abdomen of his brother George. Kuato psychically reads Quaid's mind, learning that Cohaagen is hiding a 500,000-year-old alien reactor built into a mountain that, once activated, produces breathable air but could also destroy all turbinium, ending Cohaagen's monopoly over both resources. Benny shoots George, revealing himself to be in Cohaagen's employ, and Cohaagen's forces attack the base, killing the rebels. Kuato implores Quaid to start the reactor before Richter executes him. Cohaagen disables Venusville's air supply to slowly suffocate the remaining inhabitants.\n\nQuaid and Melina are brought to Cohaagen, who explains that Hauser was his close friend who volunteered to become Quaid as an elaborate ruse to bypass the mutants' psychic abilities, infiltrate the rebellion, and destroy it. Quaid's Rekall visit had activated him earlier than planned and Cohaagen has been helping him to survive the oblivious Richter's pursuit. Cohaagen orders Hauser's memories to be restored in Quaid and Melina to be reprogrammed as his subservient lover, but they manage to escape to the mines below the reactor. Benny, Richter, and his men attack them, but the pair outwits and kills them all.\n\nCohaagen awaits them in the reactor control room, claiming that activating it will destroy the planet. He sets off an explosive but Quaid throws it down a tunnel, creating a breach to the Martian surface. The [[explosive decompression]] blows Cohaagen out to the surface where he suffocates and dies. Quaid activates the reactor before he and Melina are also blown out. The reactor melts the planet's ice core into gas that bursts to the surface, forming a breathable atmosphere and saving Quaid, Melina, and the rest of Mars's population. As everyone beholds the now-blue sky, Quaid momentarily wonders if everything was a dream, before he and Melina kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|total_width=500\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = (Left to right) [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Ronny Cox]]  (both pictured in 2019), and [[Sharon Stone]] (2017)\n| image1 = Arnold Schwarzenegger by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| alt1 = A photograph of Arnold Schwarzenegger \n| image2 = Ronny Cox 2019.jpg\n| alt2 = A photograph of Ronny Cox\n| image3 = Sharon Stone by Gage Skidmore 4.jpg\n| alt3= A photograph of Sharon Stone\n}}\n\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Douglas Quaid / Carl Hauser: An Earth-based construction worker with a hidden past<ref name=\"SyFyCast\"/>\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Melina: A Martian freedom fighter<ref name=\"ColliderCast\"/>\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Lori: Quaid's wife and a secret agent<ref name=\"SyFyCast\"/>\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Vilos Cohaagen: The governor of the Martian colony<ref name=\"DOGCast\"/>\n* [[Michael Ironside]] as Richter: Cohaagen's ruthless enforcer<ref name=\"DOGCast\"/><ref name=\"WaTimesCast\"/>\n* [[Marshall Bell]] as George / Kuato (voice): The mutant leader of the Martian resistance<ref name=\"CBRCast\"/>\n* [[Michael Campbell (musician and actor)|Michael Champion]] as Helm: Richter's right-hand man<ref name=\"DOGCast2\"/>\n* [[Mel Johnson Jr.]] as Benny: A Martian taxi driver<ref name=\"SyFyCast2\"/>\n* [[Roy Brocksmith]] as Dr. Edgemar: A Rekall employee<ref name=\"SyFyCast\"/>\n* [[Rosemary Dunsmore]] as Dr. Renata Lull: A Rekall programmer<ref name=\"Filmsite.orgCast\"/>\n\nThe Earth-based cast features [[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] as Rekall salesman Bob McClane,<ref name=\"Filmsite.orgCast\"/> [[Robert Costanzo]] as Harry, and Alexia Robinson as Tiffany.<ref name=\"BFICast\"/> [[Robert Picardo]] provides the voice and visual likeness of Johnnycab, an automated taxi driver.<ref name=\"SyFyat30\"/>\n\nThe Martian cast includes [[Lycia Naff]] as Mary, a mutant three-breasted prostitute,<ref name=\"VultureCast\"/> [[Marc Alaimo]] as Everett, [[Dean Norris]] as Tony, [[Debbie Lee Carrington]] as Thumbelina, [[Sasha Rionda]] as Mutant Child, [[Mickey Jones]] as Burly Miner, and Priscilla Allen as \"fat lady\".<ref name=\"BFICast\"/>\n\n==Production==\n===Early development===\nThe development of ''Total Recall'' began in 1974, when producer [[Ronald Shusett]] purchased the adaptation rights to science fiction writer [[Philip K.

However, the process uncovers his true identity as a secret agent who previously visited Mars and whose death will bring about an alien invasion.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=61}}<ref name=\"WiredPKD\"/>\n\nRenaming it ''Total Recall'', Shusett worked with [[Dan O'Bannon]] to write the script. O'Bannon exhausted the existing material quickly, and the short story's abrupt ending meant he could only write thirty pages, effectively only the first act, and an original second and third act were needed; he suggested sending Quaid to Mars.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=61}} Shusett and O'Bannon disagreed over the third act, the former wanting something more dramatic. O'Bannon's ending revealed the handprint on the alien machine as Quaid's, who is a replica of the original, and placing his hand on it grants him total memory recall. O'Bannon described the filmed ending as \"lame\".{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=62}}<ref name=\"XRating1\"/> Dick read the script prior to his death in 1982 and, according to O'Bannon, enjoyed it.{{sfn|Murray|1990b|p=72}} Although studios deemed Shusett and O'Bannon's script an ambitious and brilliant idea, it was essentially considered unfilmable, in part because of the extensive special effects and high budget that would be required.{{sfn|Murray|1990|p=52}}{{sfn|Murray|1990b|p=30}}\n\nThe pair moved on to collaborating on the script for the science fiction horror film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), the success of which earned Shusett a development deal at [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]. He pursued the ''Total Recall'' project at the studio, initially budgeted at $20{{nbsp}}million, but the idea did not progress because issues with the third act could not be resolved. The project was sold to [[Dino De Laurentiis]]'s [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] (DEG) in 1982.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:{{sfn|Murray|1990|p=52}}{{sfn|Murray|1990b|p=30}}<ref name=\"WiredPKD\"/>{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=62}}<ref name=\"LATimesDec1988\"/>{{sfn|Roberts|1990|p=6}}}}\n\n===Development under De Laurentiis Entertainment Group===\n[[File:Dino de laurentiis crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A 2009 photograph of Dino De Laurentiis|Producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] (pictured in 2009) thought [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was not suitable to lead the film. ]]\nDe Laurentiis considered [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]], [[Lewis Teague]], [[Russell Mulcahy]], and [[Fred Schepisi]] to direct the film, before choosing [[David Cronenberg]] in 1984.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=62}}{{sfn|Roberts|1990|p=6}} Cronenberg was unfamiliar with Dick's work but was interested in the script. Even so, problems remained with the third act and Cronenberg spent the next year writing twelve separate drafts.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=62}} In his finished script, Quaid's true identity is Chairman Mandrell, the dictator of Earth who, following a failed assassination attempt on his life, is convinced by Mars Administrator Cohaagen to confront the organization that suppressed his memory. Cohaagen later reveals that Quaid is an inconsequential government worker chosen to play the role of Mandrell to facilitate Cohaagen usurping control of the Earth. Quaid defeats Cohaagen and assumes the identity of Mandrell.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=65}} Cronenberg was responsible for the mutant characters, including Kuato (originally called Quato), and further developed an idea by Shusett about mutant animals, known as Ganzibulls, in the Martian sewers; Cronenberg made them mutant camels.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nCronenberg found himself at odds with Shusett regarding the tone, as Shusett and De Laurentiis did not want it to be as serious as the science fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982)\u2014an adaptation of Dick's novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (1968).{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=63}} Shusett described Cronenberg's work as bringing the film back to Dick's original short story, whereas they wanted an adventure closer to \"''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' go to Mars\".{{sfn|Murray|1990|p=52}}<ref name=\"WiredPKD\"/> Cronenberg did not want to make that film and chose to quit. He was also frustrated by his disagreements with Shusett and De Laurentiis, and the casting of [[Richard Dreyfuss]] in the lead role.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=63}} Dreyfuss had requested further rewrites to have Quaid reflect the everyman persona he had established in his previous films, rather than the action-focus of the Shusett/O'Bannon story. Cronenberg had wanted to cast [[William Hurt]] as the lead instead and focus more on the concepts of memory and identity.{{sfn|Murray|1990|p=52}}{{sfn|Hughes|2012|pp=63\u201364}} [[Christopher Reeve]] and [[Jeff Bridges]] were also considered for Quaid.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:{{sfn|Murray|1990|p=52}}{{sfn|Murray|1990b|p=30}}<ref name=\"WiredPKD\"/>{{sfn|Vest|2009|p=48}}}} De Laurentiis had wanted to reduce the budget by eliminating Mars entirely, but Shusett and O'Bannon dissented.{{sfn|Roberts|1990|p=6}} De Laurentiis threatened to sue Cronenberg for quitting but was placated by Cronenberg agreeing to work with him on a different film.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=63}} A few years later, De Laurentiis offered Cronenberg the opportunity to make ''Total Recall'' as he had wanted, but Cronenberg was not interested and did not want to argue with Shusett again.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=63}}\n\nProblems with finalizing the script and the high budget continued to stall ''Total Recall'' for the next few years.{{sfn|Murray|1990|p=52}}{{sfn|Roberts|1990|p=6}} In 1987, De Laurentiis again considered hiring Rush as director, but De Laurentiis disliked the finale featuring a breathable atmosphere on Mars while Rush supported the idea. De Laurentiis accepted he was wrong after hiring director [[Bruce Beresford]], who also supported the ending.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=66}} Around this time, writer [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]] was offered an opportunity to refine the script, but he turned it down to focus on his own project, called ''Warrior'', that he was working on alongside director [[Paul Verhoeven]] at [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=66}} Beresford began preparations for a version of ''Total Recall'' described by Shusett as less gritty and more \"[[Steven Spielberg|Spielbergian]]\" in tone, and [[Patrick Swayze]] was cast as Quaid.

Verhoeven read each one and highlighted those he wanted Goldman to reference.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|pp=67\u201368}}\n\n===Writing===\nGoldman had little knowledge of Dick's work but tried to respect the source material and work of previous screenwriters.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|pp=70\u201371}} He considered the second half of the film a concession to traditional Hollywood narratives and so retained most of the structure from Beresford's shooting script. Because the creative team wanted to commence soon, Goldman believed he did not have the freedom to make substantial changes to the script and focused on refining the existing content and making the scientific aspects more realistic. Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger agreed that everything after Dr. Edgemar's visit to Quaid on Mars was not working.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|pp=67\u201368}}{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=71}} Verhoeven wanted a significant change, to indicate that Edgemar could be telling the truth and Quaid is actually having a mental breakdown on Earth. Goldman rewrote the script to make it possible for the film to be viewed as both reality and fantasy.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=68}} He also made Hauser an ally to Cohaagen, clearly defining Quaid and Hauser as separate identities.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=69}} Goldman believed that making Hauser evil would better justify Quaid not returning to his original personality. It would also explain why Hauser becomes Quaid: to conceal his intentions from the psychic mutants. Goldman made the Benny character a villain, because he believed African Americans were typically typecast as good characters and the reveal would be surprising.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=70}}\n\nThe script also had to be revised to match Schwarzenegger's action-hero public image, although Goldman tried to make it less comical than some of the actor's previous films.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=71}} The meek clerk Quail was renamed Quaid, to avoid referencing then-vice president [[Dan Quayle]], and became a muscle-bound construction worker, while fight scenes were rewritten to include more feats of strength and less martial arts or running.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=61}}<ref name=\"WiredPKD\"/>{{sfn|Murray|1990|p=53}} Second unit director and stunt coordinator [[Vic Armstrong]], among other stunt people who had worked with Schwarzenegger on ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982) and ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]'' (1985), said that they knew what he could physically do without looking silly.{{sfn|Murray|1990|pp=53\u201354}} Schwarzenegger also wanted more creative methods to dispatch Quaid's foes because he had been criticized for an over-reliance on guns to kill people in films like ''Commando''.{{sfn|Murray|1990|p=54}} After Goldman's first rewrite, he discussed it with Verhoeven, Schwarzenegger, Shusett, Vajna, and Kassar. Schwarzenegger and Shusett believed the climax lacked emotion, which was an intentional choice by Verhoeven, who did not take the Martian rebel plot very seriously and prioritized the intellectual aspects of the narrative. To appease Schwarzenegger, Goldman conceived of Cohaagen shutting off the oxygen to the mutants in Venusville.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=71}} After nearly sixteen years in development, seven directors, four co-writers, and forty script drafts, ''Total Recall'' went into production.{{sfn|Murray|1990|p=52}}{{sfn|Hughes|2012|pp=66,71,88}}{{sfn|Murray|1990b|pp=30,72}}\n\n===Cast and characters===\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = left\n| footer = (Left to right) [[Michael Ironside]] (pictured in 2009) who portrayed Richter and [[Roy Brocksmith]] (date unknown) who played Rekall employee Dr. Edgemar\n| image1 = Michael Ironside WOH-06 (cropped).jpg\n| alt1 = A photograph of Michael Ironside\n| image2 = Roy Brocksmith.png\n| alt2 = A black-and-white photograph of Roy Brocksmith\n}}\n\nVerhoeven chose Michael Ironside to portray Cohaagen's henchman Richter.

He recounted having just finished filming a \"horrible\" [[Blaxploitation|black exploitation]] film when he read the ''Total Recall'' script and, after seeing Benny described as a \"black jivester\", he threw the script across the room.

Describing his portrayal, Cox said that he did not employ [[method acting]] but did try to understand how the character would feel and think and how he would react to situations and that would determine his performance. The character's hairstyle came about after Cox's hair was slicked-back in order to make a face mold for special effects purposes.

Almost everyone involved suffered from dust inhalation on set. Food poisoning and gastroenteritis from the local Mexican cuisine was also a problem, except for Shusett and Schwarzenegger, who had his food brought from the United States after a negative experience while filming ''Predator'' in Mexico.<ref name=\"XRating1\"/><ref name=\"ringer june2020\"/> The illness compounded the difficulties Lycia Naff had filming her scenes as the three-breasted prostitute.

Filming had to be paused while he recovered, as Richter was involved in most of the remaining scenes. After three weeks, a producer asked that he return to filming but they could not obtain insurance unless Ironside performed fifty push-ups. Despite the doctor's advice, he attempted the feat and reinjured himself; after thirty push-ups the doctor said it was sufficient. Ironside's first scene on his return involved him fighting Schwarzenegger on an elevator, but he struggled to lift his arm. The doctor had [[Oakland Raiders]] quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] drop off a brace built for his own injury, which held Ironside's chest in a stable position, although it made breathing difficult. Ironside filmed his scene over the remainder of the day, only being hit once accidentally by Schwarzenegger, who was cautious of his condition.<ref name=\"DOGCast\"/> A separate fight between Stone and Ticotin was arranged to normally feature one of the actresses and one stunt person because padding could not be concealed under their outfits.

Apart from ''Die Hard 2'', the films were all scheduled for release by the end of June to ensure a long theatrical run during the peak time of the year, and other releases were scheduled to avoid opening against them. National polling in April that year showed audiences were most interested in ''Another 48 Hrs.'' and ''Die Hard 2''. The year was predicted to surpass the record $5{{nbsp}}billion box office of 1989, with more films than ever expected to surpass $100{{nbsp}}million box offices. At the same time, the importance of domestic box office grosses was decreasing as studios increasingly earned profits from home media releases, television rights, and markets outside of the United States and Canada. These growing markets were, in turn, inflating film production costs as stars commanded higher salaries to compensate for their international appeal, with ''Total Recall'', ''Die Hard 2'', and ''Days of Thunder'' among the most expensive films being released.

Although retailers normally avoided selling films with violent or sexual content, they were willing to stock ''Total Recall''.<ref name=\"LATimesHomeMedia5\"/> It was predicted to perform well as a purchase and rental.<ref name=\"NYTimesHomeMedia1\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesHomeMedia2\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesHomeMedia3\"/> It became one of the bestselling home entertainment products of the year, in which purchases outperformed rentals for the first time. It was also one of the top rentals in December, trading the number one position back and forth with ''Pretty Woman''.<ref name=\"LATimesHomeMedia6\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesHomeMedia4\"/>\n\nThe film was first released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] in 2000, and received criticism from ''[[IGN]]'' for what was perceived as poor image quality. It was followed by a special edition version in 2001 that included a commentary track with Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger and a documentary about the film's production, including its release and subsequent reaction.<ref name=\"IGNDVDNormal\"/><ref name=\"DVDIGNSpecial\"/> A special ''Total Recall: Mind-Bending Edition'' [[Blu-ray]] was released in 2012, featuring a high-definition restoration from the original negative. This version included a new interview with Verhoeven and a comparison of the restored footage against the original.<ref name=\"WaTimesCast\"/><ref name=\"BluRayMind1\"/><ref name=\"BluRayMind2\"/> For its 30th anniversary in 2021, the film was remastered as a [[4K resolution]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] Blu-ray (including a digital copy) based on a digital scan from the original 35mm film negatives under Verhoeven's supervision.<ref name=\"VultureCast\"/> As well as content from the 2012 Blu-ray, this release introduced a 60-minute documentary about the success and failure of Carolco Pictures, and retrospectives on the film score, special effects, and production.<ref name=\"WaTimesCast\"/> A separate 5-disc collectors edition was released with a double-sided poster, art cards, essays about the film and the score on [[compact disc]] (CD).<ref name=\"Empire30th\"/>\n\nGoldsmith's score was first released on CD in 1990 with 10 tracks. A deluxe edition was released in 2000 with 27 tracks.<ref name=\"SoundtrackNet\"/> Coinciding with the 30th anniversary, Quartet Records released the remastered soundtrack on a 2-CD and limited edition 3-[[Phonograph record|Vinyl record]] set. The anniversary edition included the score plus alternates and source music, restored by Goldsmith's long-time sound mixer [[Bruce Botnick]].<ref name=\"30thAnniversaryScore\"/>\n\n===Other media===\nA [[novelization]] of the film, written by [[Piers Anthony]] and based on the script and Dick's original novel, was released in 1990; it retains the original character name of Douglas Quail.<ref name=\"Novel\"/> That same year, an action-platformer video game, ''[[Total Recall (video game)|Total Recall]]'', was released for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amstrad CPC]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], and [[Amiga]], and [[Atari ST]] computers. A ZX Spectrum version was planned but cancelled because it would not be ready for the Christmas 1990 release date.<ref name=\"DOGGame\"/> A comic book adaptation of the film was also released in 1990 by [[DC Comics]].<ref name=\"CBR1990Comic\"/> A 2011 four-issue miniseries comic book was released by [[Dynamite Entertainment]]. Written by Vince Moore with art by Cezar Rezak, the series' narrative continues on from the end of the film, depicting Quaid dealing with a Mars still in chaos following Cohaagen's death.<ref name=\"ComicBook2011\"/><ref name=\"ComicBook20112\"/><ref name=\"ComicBook20113\"/>\n\n==Themes and analysis==\n===Themes===\nThe main theme of ''Total Recall'' is the question of whether or not Quaid's experiences are real or a dream induced by his failed Rekall memory implantation. Despite the film's deviations from Dick's original story, both focus on this theme.<ref name=\"WiredPKD\"/> Verhoeven explicitly wanted both possibilities to be viable, although his personal preference is that Quaid's experiences are a dream. He explained \"it's a dream, which is disturbing to the audience because they don't want that, of course. They want an adventure story, they don't want a fake adventure story. So they are on [Quaid's] side trying to believe that it's all true, while [Dr. Edgemar] is trying to tell him that it's not true.\"{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=68}} Quaid chooses to believe in his reality and kills Dr. Edgemar.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=68}} Lori confirming that the Quaid persona is effectively a dream breaks down the barrier between reality and fantasy, leaving Quaid and the audience unable to definitively determine the reality of what they are experiencing.{{sfn|Vest|2009|p=35}}\n\nIt is left up to the audience to determine what is real, and because of Schwarzenegger's public image as a superhuman action hero, the possibility remains that Quaid's adventures on Mars are real. Verhoeven said that re-watching the film can induce more doubt in the audience, particularly when the Rekall manager, Bob McClane, effectively outlines everything that will happen to Quaid after the memory implantation. During the same scene, Melina is shown on the Rekall screen before Quaid has met her.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|pp=68\u201369}} At the film's end, Quaid still questions if everything is a dream, and Melina suggests that he kiss her before he wakes up. English professor Jason P. Vest said that by not including herself in Quaid's possible delusion, Melina both suggests and denies she is a creation of Quaid's fantasy.{{sfn|Vest|2009|p=37}} Ironside stated that he believed the film is an analog for manipulating reality for the common people through news and the media at the behest of those in power.<ref name=\"BFIORal\"/> Writer Bek Aliev believed that this theme remains relevant in the age of social media, where the line between a person's average life and more curated online life becomes blurred.<ref name=\"CBRTotal\"/>\n\nAnother theme of ''Total Recall'' is the meaning of identity in a world where memories are commodities that can be erased or fabricated completely.{{sfn|Vest|2009|pp=xxix, 33\u201334}} Vest contrasted this with ''Blade Runner,'' in which memory is presented as a precious and vital component of the human experience, while in ''Total Recall,'' memories can be easily removed, replaced, or revised and these changes are generally embraced. When Quaid learns that he is really Hauser, he affirms to himself \"I am Quaid\" and rejects the Hauser personality.{{sfn|Vest|2009|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nAuthor David Hughes wrote that Quaid is not an altered version of Hauser but a completely separate personality with his own memories and morality. He contrasted Quaid with ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s [[replicant]]s\u2014artificial humans\u2014except that it is Quaid's mind that is artificial. Quaid is forced to choose between returning to his original but antagonistic persona or remaining as the artificial but benevolent construct of Quaid. Hughes considered this an interesting moral choice and true to Dick's work.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=69}} Quaid is offered a chance at a better life by being restored to Hauser's higher social status, but will lose himself in the process.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|p=70}} Goldman believed Quaid's refusal to be the authentic choice because he did not believe someone would willingly and permanently give up their identity.{{sfn|Hughes|2012|pp=69\u201370}} ''[[SyFy]]'' writer Noah Berlatsky said that as an everyday worker who desires grand adventures, Quaid is an audience stand-in, and suggested the hologram projector that creates a duplicate image of Quaid to be akin to the audience viewing themselves through the phantom personality that is Quaid.<ref name=\"SyFyCast\"/>\n\nThe film presents a politically, morally, and visually unattractive future in which the Earth's locations are covered in brutalist, concrete architecture. Verhoeven specifically chose to use this style because he believed it suggested a cruel society indifferent to the suffering of the Martian colonists as long as terbinium ore mining continues. Mars is represented ubiquitously with various red hues, invoking associations with blood, danger, and a hellish domain.{{sfn|Vest|2009|p=32}}<ref name=\"LATimesRetro\"/> The in-film Propaganda networks show reality being altered in real-time, as they brand the resistance as terrorists and describe the indiscriminate slaughter of them as restoring order with minimal use of force.<ref name=\"TheGuardianREtro\"/>\n\n===Analysis===\nAccording to Vest and English professor Frank Grady, most political assessments of the film considered it [[left-wing]] for its anti-corporation and revolutionary message but Vest perceived a more [[Conservatism|conservative]] subtext in which the \"white protagonist saves a society of the less well-off who cannot save themselves\".{{sfn|Vest|2009|pp=39,41}}{{sfn|Grady|2003|p=44}} They identified ''Total Recall'' as one of many films produced throughout the 1980s\u2014such as ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985) and ''Predator''\u2014that were \"fronted by white male characters who employ violence to preserve American righteousness, liberty, autonomy, and reinforce an idealistic American image of combating unnecessary bureaucracy, fascists, communists, and foreign and domestic threats\". Schwarzenegger identified himself as a conservative and supporter of [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Ronald Reagan]], which Vest opined made him \"an unusual choice to portray the protagonist who liberates Mars from Cohaagen's dictatorship\".{{sfn|Vest|2009|p=39}}{{sfn|Grady|2003|p=42}} Quaid's rejection of the Hauser persona can be seen as an example of self-determination and American exceptionalism, but in doing so he also avoids responsibility or punishment for Hauser's acts, which Grady considered an act of [[Cynicism (contemporary)|moral cynicism]]. Historian [[Stephen Prince]] described Quaid's choice not as the loss of self, but conscious rejection of it.{{sfn|Vest|2009|p=39}}{{sfn|Grady|2003|pp=44\u201345}} Remarking on the similarities between ''Total Recall'' and the science fiction film ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999), educator [[Neal King]] found that both protagonists begin as discontented workers who learn their life is a fabrication, become instrumental to those rebelling against overwhelming authority, and eventually learn they were deliberately created to quash the rebellion. Any good deeds they perform are a result of who they were programmed to be, meaning their free will is an illusion.{{sfn|King|2008|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nGrady and ''SyFy'' writer Stephanie Williams described the [[privatization]] of air in ''Total Recall'' as the extreme of unchecked corporate power, comparing it to the real world privatization of water sources by companies whose core incentive is to increase profits, such as in the [[Flint water crisis]]. The mutants on Mars are the result of early colonists exposed to a toxic atmosphere because of cheap domes, and their offspring still serve Cohaagen, meaning the authorities have escaped any responsibility for their involvement. In the end, Cohaagen suffocates in a toxic atmosphere that he could have changed at any time.{{sfn|Grady|2003|p=44}}<ref name=\"SyFyPrivatization\"/> The film also contains a number of product placements for brands such as [[Pepsi]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Jack in the Box]], promoting corporate interests while portraying an anti-corporate stance.{{sfn|Grady|2003|p=44}}\n\nLinda Mizejewski, a professor of women's studies at the [[Ohio State University]], suggests that the name \"Cohaagen\" is supposed to sound [[Afrikaans]] and this, along with the character's links to the mining industry, is part of an analogy between [[Apartheid|Apartheid-era South Africa]], in which there was a highly prosperous [[Mining industry of South Africa|mining industry]], and sharply defined class divisions, akin to those in the film between the mining executives and the ordinary, oppressed Martians.{{sfn|Vest|2009|p=40}} Likewise, Aliev considered the relationship between the lower classes on Mars and the government to be analogous to real-world colonial and post-colonial social structures, such as Apartheid. The technology that undermines the existing power structure is a metaphor for decolonization and championing the voices of the oppressed.<ref name=\"CBRTotal\"/> Vest believed ''Total Recall'' did not offer a positive representation of minorities, as Benny, the only important African American character, collaborates with Cohaagen and helps assassinate the Martian freedom fighter Kuato. Vest believed that his repeated references to having multiple children \"reinforced stereotypes of African American men as irresponsible and promiscuous\", and that \"his alliance with Cohaagen presents the character as untrustworthy, selfish, and corrupt\".{{sfn|Vest|2009|p=46}}\n\nVest identified certain elements in the film as sexist and misogynistic. Many female characters are presented as prostitutes or mutants, which he believed suggested that \"femininity is a source of moral or physical deformity\". Many female characters are violently killed throughout, such as Lori, who is dispatched while Schwarzenegger quips that she should \"consider that a divorce\". However, while Melina is sometimes reliant on Quaid to save her, both she and Lori are portrayed as effective fighters and Melina is essential to saving Quaid's life at the end.{{sfn|Grady|2003|pp=44\u201345}}{{sfn|Vest|2009|pp=42\u201343}} [[Union College]] film studies co-director Michelle Chilcoat wrote that ''Total Recall'' began a decade of [[cyberpunk]] films that focused on a separation and transformation of the mind away from a traditional human body, such as ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'' (1992), ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' (1995), and ''The Matrix''. Even so, Chilcoat argues that given the option to become anything via Rekall, ''Total Recall'' repeatedly asserts Quaid's heterosexuality.{{sfn|Chilcoat|2004|pp=156,162}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Modern reception===\n[[File:Jerry Goldsmith 2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A 2003 photo of Jerry Goldsmith |The score for ''Total Recall'' is considered among the best work of composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]] (pictured in 2003).]]\nSince its release, several publications have named ''Total Recall'' as one of the top 100 science fiction films ever made.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"BestSciFiIGN\"/><ref name=\"BestSciFiPaste\"/><ref name=\"BestSciFiRT\"/><ref name=\"BestSciFiTimeOut\"/><ref name=\"BestSciFiParade\"/>}} [[Rotten Tomatoes]] named it one of the 300 essential films to watch,<ref name=\"RT300\"/> and it is also listed in the book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]''.{{sfn|Schneider|2013}} On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a {{RT data|score}} approval rating from the aggregated reviews of {{RT data|count}} critics, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}.

Similarly, he believed Quaid's upbeat, amoral antihero protagonist was closer to Dick's traditional protagonists.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> Even so, ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'' wrote that \"its weirdness and appreciation of dumb-fun\" meant that it would probably never be as highly considered as ''Blade Runner'' or films such as ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"CBRTotal\"/> To mark Schwarzenegger's 75th birthday in 2022, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' listed ''Total Recall'' as the fourth-best film in his 46-year career.<ref name=\"Variety75\"/>\n\n===Cultural influence===\n''Total Recall'' became one of the most expensive films ever made in its time, and one of the last big-budget films to use almost entirely practical special effects.<ref name=\"BFIORal\"/><ref name=\"ReviewVariety\"/><ref name=\"LATimesRetro\"/> It is also seen as among the films responsible for a significant rise in the costs of film production because of the high salaries studios like Carolco paid to stars with international appeal such as Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and [[Mel Gibson]], recouping their investment by selling their films to the rapidly growing film markets outside of the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"10TR12T2\"/><ref name=\"NYTImesJune251990\"/> Alongside the boost to Schwarzenegger's career, ''Total Recall'' also redefined Stone from a model to a legitimate film star.<ref name=\"ringer june2020\"/><ref name=\"LATimesPremiere\"/><ref name=\"ETSTone\"/>\n\nA 2020 ''SyFy'' article credited ''Total Recall'' as one of three action films, along with ''Terminator 2'' and ''True Lies'' (1994), that revived Schwarzenegger's career after a series of less successful action films such as ''Predator'', ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987), and ''Red Heat''.<ref name=\"LATimesJune51990\"/><ref name=\"SYFYCareer\"/> Schwarzenegger recounted coming across the film on television that year, and believing it still held up, saying: \"that is really great filmmaking{{nbsp}}... when you can, after 30 years, watch a movie and it still feels the same.\"<ref name=\"ringer june2020\"/> Schwarzenegger also named his 2012 [[memoir]] ''Total Recall''.<ref name=\"Memoir\"/>\n\nIn 2020, ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that, with hindsight, ''Total Recall'' formed the middle of Verhoeven's unofficial science fiction action film trilogy about authoritarian governance, following ''RoboCop'' and preceding ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'' (1997).<ref name=\"TheGuardianREtro\"/> Quaid's line, \"consider that a divorce\", after killing Lori, is considered one of Schwarzenegger's most iconic [[One-line joke|one-line quips]] from his filmography,<ref name=\"CBRTotal\"/><ref name=\"AVClubRetro\"/><ref name=\"TheGuardianREtro\"/> and the three-breasted prostitute, portrayed by Lycia Naff, is regarded as an iconic character in cinematic history.<ref name=\"SyFyCast2\"/><ref name=\"VultureCast\"/> Although she eventually came to terms with the role, Naff was initially embarrassed by her appearance in ''Total Recall'' and avoided interviews or fan interactions, saying \"I decided not to answer every letter from every prisoner in the world who was writing to me{{nbsp}}...\"<ref name=\"EmpireDutch\"/>\n\n''Total Recall'' influenced films such as ''The Matrix'', ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000), also starring Schwarzenegger, as well as other media such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[The Expanse (TV series)|The Expanse]]''.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"CBRTotal\"/><ref name=\"LATimesRetro\"/><ref name=\"RetroVulture\"/><ref name=\"AVClubRetro\"/><ref name=\"CultRickandM\"/><ref name=\"CultSouthPark\"/><ref name=\"CultExpanse\"/>}} It has been referenced in politics when, during his 2020 address to the [[Austrian World Summit]] climate conference about the urgency of their 2050 climate neutrality goal, Dutch politician and [[European Commissioner for Climate Action]] [[Frans Timmermans]] said, \"it's been 30 years since ''Total Recall'' and ''Kindergarten Cop'' \u2014 I mean these things go so fast{{nbsp}}... we have to act now and we can.\"<ref name=\"Politico\"/>\n\n==Sequel and adaptations==\n{{Main|Total Recall 2070|Minority Report (film)|Total Recall (2012 film)}}\n\n''Total Recall''{{'}}s success led to development of a sequel.
