It is based on the real-life story of [[Ram\u00f3n Sampedro]] (played by [[Javier Bardem]]), who was left [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]] after a diving accident, and his 28-year campaign in support of [[euthanasia]] and the [[Right to die|right to end his life]]. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nThis is the life story of Spaniard Ram\u00f3n Sampedro, who fought a 28-year campaign to win the right to end his own life with assisted suicide. The film explores Ram\u00f3n's relationships with two women: Julia, a lawyer suffering from [[CADASIL syndrome|Cadasil syndrome]] who supports his cause, and Rosa, a local woman who wants to convince him that his life is worth living. Through the gift of his love, these two women are inspired to accomplish things they never previously thought possible.\n\nRam\u00f3n, now 54 years old, has been fighting for 26 years for his right to die following a diving incident which left him paralysed from the neck down. He is unable to end his life by himself and does not wish to implicate his family or friends, as by Spanish law, they would be charged with murder or assisting a suicide. Following the death of his mother, he is cared for by his sister-in-law, Manuela. Ram\u00f3n's elder brother Jos\u00e9 does not believe he should have the right to die; both Manuela and her son, Javier, believe in his case.\n\nRam\u00f3n's friend Gen\u00e9, who works for an organisation fighting for the right to die, puts him in contact with Julia, a lawyer. As she seeks to learn more about him and his situation in order to fight for his cause, he recounts his past and his reasons for wanting to die: He says that there is no dignity in living paralysed. After seeing his story online, Rosa visits Ram\u00f3n to convince him to live. He demands that she respect his wishes and she leaves, upset. Later, whilst DJing her part-time radio show, she apologises on air in the hopes that he is listening. She continues to visit, bringing her children, and the two strike up a friendship. Despite romantic interest in both women, Ram\u00f3n maintains that he is spoken for by death.\n\nJulia reads Ram\u00f3n's memoir describing his life and experiences as a quadriplegic and urges him to publish it. He imagines flying from his bed to visit her on the beach. Later, she is hospitalised with a stroke and admitted to rehab to relearn how to walk. The two write letters to each other, sending updates of their lives. Ram\u00f3n loses a court case for his right to die. Rosa, in tears, appears at his house and Ram\u00f3n admits that he has planned a way to commit suicide without the direct and obvious involvement of anyone else.\n\nMeanwhile, Padre Francisco, a quadriplegic Catholic priest, comes to convince Ram\u00f3n to want to live. Ram\u00f3n refuses to be carried downstairs and so the two men converse through the help of a church boy, who runs up and down to share their arguments. Angry and upset, Manuela asks him to leave. Julia visits to assist Ram\u00f3n in writing his memoir whilst his family and friends discuss his right to die. Divided, they fight. But Ram\u00f3n is unwavering in his wish. Again, he imagines that he is able-bodied, kissing Julia. Later, she admits that her condition will only become more severe and that she is planning to kill herself. But first, she would like to help Ram\u00f3n.\n\nRam\u00f3n and Javier work together to design and build a wheelchair for him in which he can appear in court to fight for his own right to die. His appeal is ultimately rejected, but Ram\u00f3n eventually fulfils his wish nonetheless. Each of his friends and family complete a small action in his death; not enough to convict any of them of his murder or assisting his suicide. He records himself on a video camera, narrating his own death, before ingesting a cyanide-laced drink that kills him.\n\n==Cast==\n===Sampedro family===\n*[[Javier Bardem]] as [[Ram\u00f3n Sampedro]]\n*[[Celso Bugallo]] as Jos\u00e9 Sampedro, Ram\u00f3n's elder brother\n*[[Mabel Rivera]] as Manuela, Jos\u00e9's wife and Ram\u00f3n's caregiver\n*[[Tamar Novas]] as Javier Sampedro, Ram\u00f3n's nephew\n*Joan Dalmau as Joaqu\u00edn Sampedro, Ram\u00f3n and Jos\u00e9's father\n\n===Ramon's friends===\n*[[Bel\u00e9n Rueda]] as Julia\n*Alberto Jim\u00e9nez as Germ\u00e1n, Julia's husband\n*[[Lola Due\u00f1as]] as Rosa\n*Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez Luna as Cristian, Rosa's elder son\n*Ra\u00fal Lavisier as Samuel, her younger son\n*Clara Segura as Gen\u00e9\n*[[Francesc Garrido]] as Marc, Gen\u00e9's husband\n\n===Others===\n*[[Josep Maria Pou]] as Padre Francisco, a quadriplegic Catholic priest\n*Alberto Amarilla as Hermano Andr\u00e9s\n*[[Andrea Occhipinti]] as Santiago\n*Federico P\u00e9rez Rey as Conductor (Driver)\n*Xos\u00e9 Manuel Olveira as Juez 1 (Judge 1)\n*C\u00e9sar Cambeiro as Juez 2\n*Xos\u00e9 Manuel Esperanto as Periodista 1 (Reporter 1)\n*Yolanda Mui\u00f1os as Periodista 2\n*Adolfo Obreg\u00f3n as Ejecutivo (Executive)\n*Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez as Presentador (TV host)\n*Julio Jord\u00e1n as Encuadernador (Bookbinder)\n*Juan Manuel Vidal as Amigo Ram\u00f3n (Ram\u00f3n's friend)\n*[[Marta Larralde]] as Muchacha en la playa (Girl on beach)\n*Jacob Ahlgren as himself (Baller)\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received positive reviews from critics.
