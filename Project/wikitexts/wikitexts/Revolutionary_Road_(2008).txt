The [[screenplay]] was written by [[Justin Haythe]], adapted from the 1961 [[Revolutionary Road|novel of the same name]] by [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]]. It stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Kate Winslet]] as Frank and April Wheeler, with [[Michael Shannon]], [[Kathryn Hahn]], [[David Harbour]], and [[Kathy Bates]] in supporting roles. Set in the mid-1950s, the Wheelers struggle to cope with their personal problems and the ensuing breakdown in their marriage. ''Revolutionary Road'' is the second onscreen collaboration for DiCaprio, Winslet, and Bates, all of whom previously co-starred in 1997's ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.  The film soundtrack was composed by [[Thomas Newman]], his fourth collaboration with Mendes.\n\nDevelopment of the film adaptation actually began in 1961. However, a lack of commercial prospects and disagreements with the screenplay caused the project to be in limbo until the 2000s. [[BBC Films]] eventually purchased the film rights to the novel and Haythe rewrote the screenplay. Winslet read the script and persuaded her then-husband Mendes to direct, and DiCaprio to play the role of Frank. [[Principal photography]] began in 2007, [[On location filming|on location]] in [[Darien, Connecticut]].\n\n''Revolutionary Road'' was released in the United States on December 26, 2008, followed by a wider international release in January 2009, and grossed $76 million at the worldwide box office. The film received positive reviews from critics, who lauded the performances of DiCaprio, Winslet and Shannon, as well as the faithfulness to the novel. For their performances, DiCaprio and Winslet earned [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actress]], respectively, of which Winslet won. The film also received three [[Academy Award]] nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Shannon), [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1948, Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) meets April (Winslet) at a party. He is a [[Stevedore|longshoreman]], hoping to be a [[cashier]]; she wants to be an actress. Frank later secures a sales position with Knox Machines, and he and April marry. The Wheelers move to 115 Revolutionary Road in suburban Connecticut when April becomes pregnant.\n\nThe couple become close friends with their [[realtor]] Helen Givings (Bates) and her husband Howard Givings (Easton), and neighbor Milly Campbell (Hahn) and her husband Shep (Harbour). To their friends, the Wheelers are the perfect couple, but their relationship is troubled. April fails to make a career out of acting, while Frank hates the tedium of his work. On his 30th birthday, Frank invites a secretary at work to have a drink with him at a bar. She accepts, becomes heavily intoxicated, and they end up having sex. Meanwhile, Helen has asked April if they will meet her son, John (Shannon), who had been in an insane asylum. She thinks the younger couple may be able to help her son with his condition. April accepts.\n\nApril wants a change of scenery and a chance to support the family so Frank can find his passion, so she suggests that they move to [[Paris]] to start a new life away from the \"hopeless emptiness\" of their lifestyle. Frank balks at the idea at first, but becomes convinced. Over the next several weeks, the Wheelers tell their various friends about their plans to live in Paris, but surprisingly, the only person who seems to comprehend their decision is John. \n\nAs the couple prepares to move, they are forced to reconsider. Frank is offered a promotion, and April becomes pregnant again. When Frank discovers she is contemplating having an abortion, the couple have an altercation, in which April says that they had their second child only to prove the first child was not a \"mistake\". The next day, Frank takes the promotion and tries to accept his uneventful life. At the end of an evening at a jazz bar with the Campbells, Shep and April end up alone together. She confides in him of her depression over the canceled Paris plans and her life in general, and they end up having sex in the car. Shep professes his long-held love for April, but she rejects his interest.\n\nThe following day, Frank confesses to having had an affair, hoping to reconcile with April. To his surprise, April responds apathetically and tells him it does not matter, as her love for him has gone, which he does not believe. The Givings come over for dinner, and Frank announces to the guests that their plans have changed because April is pregnant. John lambasts Frank for crushing April's hope, as well as his acceptance of his circumstances. Angered, Frank nearly attacks John, and the Givings leave. Afterwards, Frank and April have an altercation, and April flees the house.\n\nFrank spends the night in a drunken stupor. The next morning he is shocked to find April in the kitchen, calmly making breakfast. Frank, unsure of how to react, eats with her and then leaves for work. April then goes to the bathroom, where she\u2014offscreen\u2014performs a [[vacuum aspiration]] abortion on herself. Afterwards, she discovers she is bleeding and calls an ambulance. Frank arrives at the hospital, distraught, and is comforted by Shep. April dies in the hospital from blood loss. A guilty Frank moves to the city and starts selling computers. He spends his spare time with his children. \n\nA new couple, the Braces, buys their old home and Milly tells the story of the Wheelers to them. Shep stands up and walks out of the house, crying; he tells Milly to never talk about the Wheelers ever again. Helen talks to her husband, years later, about how the Braces seem to be the best-suited couple for the Wheelers' old house. When her husband mentions the Wheelers, Helen starts to explain why she did not like them. As she continues to elaborate, her husband turns off his [[hearing aid]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Frank Wheeler\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as April Wheeler\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as John Givings, Jr.\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Milly Campbell\n* [[David Harbour]] as Shep Campbell\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Helen Givings\n* [[Ty Simpkins]] as Michael Wheeler\n* [[Richard Easton]] as Howard Givings\n* [[Ryan Simpkins]] as Jennifer Wheeler\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Jack Ordway\n* [[Zoe Kazan]] as Maureen Grube\n* [[Max Casella]] as Ed Small\n* [[Jay O.
