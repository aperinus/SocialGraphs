Seaman]], based on [[Neil B. Shulman]]'s book ''What? Dead...Again?'' The film stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Julie Warner]], [[Barnard Hughes]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[David Ogden Stiers]], [[Frances Sternhagen]], and [[Bridget Fonda]].\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Micanopy, Florida]].\n\n==Plot==\nHaving completed his medical residency in a [[Washington, D.C.]] hospital, Dr. Benjamin \"Ben\" Stone drives to [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] for a job interview with noted plastic surgeon Dr. Halberstrom. While passing through the small town of Grady, [[South Carolina]], Ben crashes into a fence whilst trying to avoid hitting a cow. Unfortunately, the fence belongs to Judge Evans, who then sentences him to 32 hours of community service at the town's medical clinic. \n\nMayor Nick Nicholson and the town's reception committee meet Ben, hoping to hire him to replace Dr. Aurelius Hogue, who is planning to retire. While his 1956 [[Porsche Speedster]] is being repaired, Ben tends to patients and flirts with ambulance driver Vialula (better known as \"Lou\"), a single mother of a four-year-old daughter. Local insurance agent Hank Gordon also courts Lou, while Nancy Lee, the mayor's daughter, pursues Ben.\n\nThe town's residents begin to warm to Ben, and he in turn starts  to enjoy small-town life. Hogue, initially dismissive of Ben as being  too young and  too inexperienced,  changes his mind when he has a    [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and Ben saves his life. Grateful, Hogue privately calls Halberstrom explaining Ben's delay due to his enforced community service (which he explains as being \"volunteer work\"), while Judge Evans releases Ben from his remaining sentence. \n\nOn the eve of Ben's departure, he shares an intimate evening with Lou. Unwilling to exploit the situation or incite Hank's jealousy, Ben secretly leaves town at night. Near the town's reservoir, Ben happens upon a local man whose wife is in labor inside their car. After a short hesitation, he stops to help. During the delivery, Ben's Porsche is once again damaged when a fatigued carnival truck driver knocks into it.\n\nBen prepares to leave the next day. The community has chipped in and bought him a plane ticket to [[Los Angeles]]. Lou, not wanting Ben to waste his talents in a small town, hides her feelings for him, and says  she is marrying Hank.\n\nDr. Halberstrom hires Ben based on Hogue's recommendation. Beverly Hills' superficiality soon leaves Ben, who grew up in a small town, feeling [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] and isolated. A few weeks later, Hank and Nancy Lee arrive in Los Angeles, bringing Ben's repaired car with them. After Hank tells Ben that he and Lou broke off their engagement, Ben returns to Grady and reconciles with her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael J. Fox]] as Dr. Benjamin \"Ben\" Stone, an aspiring surgeon.\n* [[Julie Warner]] as Vialula/\"Lou\", a tomboyish ambulance driver living in Grady who is a single mother and is a law student.\n* [[Barnard Hughes]] as Dr. Aurelius Hogue, an elderly doctor in Grady.\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Hank Gordon, Grady's local insurance salesman.\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Mayor Nick Nicholson, the mayor of Grady who is also the owner of the town's [[Coffeehouse|caf\u00e9]].\n* [[Frances Sternhagen]] as Lillian, a member of Grady's welcoming committee.\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Nancy Lee Nicholson, the daughter of Nick Nicholson.\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as Judge Evans, the judge who sentences Ben to community service.\n* Eyde Byrde as Nurse Packer, Grady's residential nurse who oversees Ben's community service.\n* [[Mel Winkler]] as Melvin, a mechanic charged with the duty to restore Ben's car.\n* [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as Dr. Halberstrom, a Beverly Hills doctor.\n* Time Winters as Kyle Owens\n* K.T. Vogt as Mary Owens\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Doc Holly.jpg|right|thumb|Neil B. Shulman posing in front of a ''Doc Hollywood'' poster.]]\nThe film is based on the book ''What? Dead\u2026Again?'' by Neil B. Shulman, about his time as a doctor in rural Georgia.<ref>{{cite book |title=What?

The critical consensus reads: \"''Doc Hollywood'' isn't particularly graceful in its attempt to put a '90s spin on its Capraesque formula, but a light touch and a charming cast make its flaws easy to forgive.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Doc Hollywood (1991) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/doc_hollywood |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2022-06-26 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] it has a score of 56% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Doc Hollywood |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doc-hollywood |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=2021-01-01}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web|title=Home - Cinemascore|url=https://www.cinemascore.com/|access-date=28 December 2019|website=Cinemascore}}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"Mr. Fox, blithe and funny as ever, amusingly shrugs off each new surprise the film has to offer\", adding that \"while retaining his boyish appeal, Mr. Fox also seems a shade more substantial this time, possibly because he is seen making life-or-death decisions when not fielding comic lines\". She did, however, say that \"the screenplay, by Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman and Daniel Pyne, is occasionally sharp-tongued but more often pleasantly knee-deep in rustic corn\".<ref>{{cite news|title= Review/Film; A Hollywood Doctor In American Squashland | work=[[The New York Times]]|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE0D91F38F931A3575BC0A967958260|access-date=2012-06-05}}</ref>\n\nPeter Rainer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' remarked that \"[I]f you have any doubt as to the outcome, you haven't been paying attention to the latest self-serving movie trend. The back-to-basics, anti-greed message of ''Doc Hollywood'' has been all over the screens this season, from TV's ''[[Northern Exposure]]'' to the movies' ''[[City Slickers]]'', ''[[Regarding Henry]]'', ''[[Life Stinks]]'' and ''[[The Doctor (1991 film)|The Doctor]]''\". He added:{{cquote|''Doc Hollywood'' draws its energy almost exclusively from clich\u00e9. Caton-Jones, perhaps because he's Scottish, feels free to indulge himself with every piece of small-town, movie-derived Americana he can train his camera on; he's an equal-opportunity borrower. Even ''[[Local Hero (film)|Local Hero]]'', directed by fellow Scotsman [[Bill Forsyth]], gets pillaged.\n\nThe cornball rowdiness is partially redeemed by the good cast, which includes Woody Harrelson as a lunky insurance salesman, David Ogden Stiers as the mayor, Roberts Blossom as a judge, Barnard Hughes as the town's decrepit doctor and Frances Sternhagen as a local busybody. Bridget Fonda turns up as a Hollywood-struck belle and, as usual, she's much stronger than her role allows for. Fonda has the power and the sass to become a major actress. Why did she bother with this dinky cameo?\n\nMichael J. Fox, as in ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'' and the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' films]], goes in for a lot of scampering here. In between scampering, he mugs. It's probably just as well that Fox doesn't bring much gravity to the role; if he were any moonier and heartfelt, the film might really be exposed as a crock.<ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : 'Doc Hollywood': Southern Exposure | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-02/entertainment/ca-83_1_doc-hollywood |access-date=2012-06-05 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2021}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] rated the film a three out of four stars stating \"On the basis of the movie's trailer, I was expecting ''Doc Hollywood'' to be a comedy.
