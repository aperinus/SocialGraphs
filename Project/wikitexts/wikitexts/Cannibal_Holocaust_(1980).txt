It stars [[Robert Kerman]] as Harold Monroe, an anthropologist from [[New York University]] who leads a rescue team into the [[Amazon rainforest]] to locate a crew of filmmakers. Played by [[Carl Gabriel Yorke]], [[Francesca Ciardi]], [[Perry Pirkanen]], and [[Luca Barbareschi]], the crew had gone missing while filming a documentary on local cannibal tribes. When the rescue team is only able to recover the crew's lost cans of film, an American television station wishes to broadcast the footage as a sensationalized television special. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is appalled by the team's actions and objects to the station's intent to air the documentary.\n\nProduced as part of the contemporary cannibal trend of Italian [[exploitation film|exploitation cinema]], ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was inspired by Italian media coverage of [[Red Brigades]] terrorism. The coverage included news reports that Deodato believed to be staged, an idea which became an integral aspect of the film's story.<ref name=\"Interview 2\"/> Additional story elements were influenced by the documentaries of [[Mondo film|Mondo]] director [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]], including the presentation of the documentary crew's lost footage, which constitutes approximately half of the film. The treatment of this footage, which is noted for its visual [[Realism (arts)|realism]], innovated the [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] style of filmmaking that was later popularized in American cinema by ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''. ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was filmed primarily on location in the Amazon rainforest of [[Colombia]] with a cast of [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous]] tribes interacting with mostly inexperienced American and Italian actors recruited in New York City.<ref>''Cinema Inferno: Celluloid Explosions from the Cultural Margins''. Weiner, Robert G.; Cline, John (Editors). Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-8108-7656-9}}.</ref>\n\n''Cannibal Holocaust'' achieved notoriety as its graphic violence aroused a great deal of controversy. After its premiere in Italy, it was ordered to be seized by a local [[Magistrate#Continental Europe and its former colonies|magistrate]], and Deodato was arrested on [[obscenity]] charges. He was later charged with multiple counts of murder due to rumors that claimed several actors were killed on camera. Although Deodato was cleared of these charges, the film was banned in Italy, Australia, and several other countries due to its graphic content, including [[sexual assault]] and genuine [[Cruelty to animals|violence toward animals]]. Although some nations have since revoked the ban, it is still upheld in several countries. Critical reception of the film is mixed, although it has received a [[cult following]]. The film's plot and violence have been noted as subtextual commentary on ethics in journalism, exploitation of [[South America]]n countries, and the difference between Western and non-Western countries, yet these interpretations have also been met with criticism, with any perceived subtext deemed hypocritical or insincere due to the film's presentation.<ref name=\"David Carter\">{{cite web | url=http://www.savagecinema.com/cannibalholocaust.html | title=Savage Cinema | author=Carter, David | publisher=Savage Cinema | access-date=6 September 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402122835/http://www.savagecinema.com/cannibalholocaust.html | archive-date=2 April 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewhitelies.co.uk/features/articles/cannibal-holocaust-16541 |title=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Review |author=Bitel, Anton |publisher=Little White Lies |access-date=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110233913/http://www.littlewhitelies.co.uk/features/articles/cannibal-holocaust-16541 |archive-date=10 November 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Goodall\"/> Many sequels were filmed, but all of them were unofficial.\n\n==Plot==\nAn American film crew disappear in the [[Amazon rainforest]] while filming a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes. The team consists of Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, script writer; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at [[New York University]], agrees to lead a rescue mission in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers. In anticipation of his arrival, military personnel stationed in the rainforest conduct a raid on the local [[Yacumo]] tribe and take a young hostage in order to negotiate with the natives. Monroe flies in via [[floatplane]] and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel.\n\nAfter several days of trekking through the jungle, the rescue team encounters the Yacumo. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group is initially greeted with hostility and learns that the filmmakers caused great unrest among the people. The next day, Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring cannibal tribes, the [[Yanomami|Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6]] and the [[Yanomaman languages|Shamatari]]. They encounter a group of Shamatari warriors and follow them to a riverbank, where Monroe's team saves a smaller group of Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6 from death. The Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6 invite the team back to their village in gratitude, but they are still suspicious of the foreigners. To gain their trust, Monroe bathes naked in a river, where he is joined by a group of Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6 people. The people lead Monroe from the river to a shrine, where he discovers the skeletal remains of the filmmakers with their film reels nearby. Shocked by what he sees, he confronts the Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6 in the village, during which time he plays music from a tape recorder. The intrigued natives agree to trade it for the filmmakers' surviving reels of film.\n\nBack in New York, executives of the Pan American Broadcasting System invite Monroe to host a broadcast of the documentary to be made from the recovered film, but Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision. One of the executives first introduces him to Alan's work by showing an excerpt from his previous documentary, ''The Last Road to Hell'', after which she informs Monroe that Alan staged dramatic scenes to get more exciting footage. Monroe then begins to view the recovered footage, which first follows the group's trek through the rainforest. After walking for days, their guide, Felipe, is bitten by a venomous snake. The group amputates Felipe's leg with a machete to save his life, but he dies and is left behind. Upon locating the Yacumo in a clearing, Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew proceeds to intimidate the tribe before herding the natives into a hut, which they burn down in order to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe expresses apprehension about the staged footage and the treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored.\n\nAfter he finishes viewing the remaining footage, Monroe expresses his disgust toward the station's decision to air the documentary. To convince the executives otherwise, he shows them the remaining unedited footage that only he has seen. The final two reels begin with the filmmakers locating a Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6 girl, whom the men take turns raping against Faye's protests, stating they are wasting film footage. They later encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where they claim that the natives killed her for loss of [[virginity]], although it is implied that the group themselves killed her and staged it as a murder by the natives for dramatic effect. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by the Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6 tribe as revenge for the girl's [[rape]] and death. Jack is hit by a spear, and Alan shoots him to prevent his escape. The scene then moves to the crew filming the natives undressing Jack in their captivity and cutting his [[Male reproductive system|genitalia]] off with a large [[machete]] before completely mutilating Jack's lifeless body. Shortly afterwards, an exhausted Alan says they have gotten completely lost trying to escape, and are now surrounded by the natives who pursued them. As a last resort, Alan attempts to scare them off with a flare gun. During the commotion, Faye is captured by the Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6. Alan insists that they attempt to rescue her, but Mark continues to film as she is stripped naked, gang-raped, beaten to death, and beheaded. The Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6 then locate and kill the last two team members as the camera drops to the ground. Disturbed by what they have seen, the executives order all of the footage to be burned. As Monroe leaves, he ponders \"who the real cannibals are\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert Kerman]] as Professor Harold Monroe\n* [[Carl Gabriel Yorke|Gabriel Yorke]] as Alan Yates\n* [[Luca Barbareschi|Luca Giorgio Barbareschi]] as Mark Tomaso\n* [[Francesca Ciardi]] as Faye Daniels\n* [[Perry Pirkanen]] as Jack Anders\n* Salvatore Basile as Chaco\n* Ricardo Fuentes\n* [[Paolo Paoloni]] as Executive\n* Lionello Pio Di Savoia as Executive\n* Luigina Rocchi\n* Kate Weiman as Executive {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* Enrico Papa as TV Interviewer {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* [[David Sage]] as Mr. Yates {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* [[Ruggero Deodato]] as Man on University Campus {{small|(uncredited)}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Ruggero Deodato 2008.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Director [[Ruggero Deodato]]]]\nProduction on ''Cannibal Holocaust'' began in 1979, when director [[Ruggero Deodato]] was contacted by West German film distributors to make a film similar to his previous work, ''[[Ultimo mondo cannibale|Last Cannibal World]]''. He accepted the project and immediately went in search of a producer, choosing his friend Francesco Palaggi. The two first flew to Colombia to scout filming locations. [[Leticia, Colombia]] was chosen as the principal filming location after Deodato met a Colombian documentary filmmaker at the airport in [[Bogot\u00e1]], who suggested the town as a location ideal for filming. Other locations had been considered, specifically those where [[Gillo Pontecorvo]]'s ''[[Burn!]]'' had been shot, but Deodato rejected these locations due to lack of suitable [[rainforest]].<ref name=\"In the Jungle\"/>\n\nDeodato conceived of the film's premise while talking to his son about news coverage of the terrorism of the [[Red Brigades]]. Deodato thought that the media focused on portraying violence with little regard for [[journalistic integrity]] and believed that journalists staged certain news angles in order to obtain more sensational footage. The Italian media was symbolized by the behavior in the film team in ''Cannibal Holocaust'', the depiction of whom was also influenced by the works of [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]], a documentary filmmaker of whom Deodato was a fan.<ref name=\"Ortolani\">{{cite video | people=[[Riz Ortolani|Ortolani, Riz]] (interviewee) |date=2003 |title=In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust |medium=Documentary |location=Italy |publisher=Alan Young Pictures}}</ref><ref name=\"Interview 2\"/> Jacopetti and his partner, Franco Prosperi, are credited with popularizing Mondo films, a genre of documentary, with their first release, ''[[Mondo cane]]''. Mondo films focused on sensational and graphic content from around the world, including local customs, violence, sexuality, and death. Deodato included similar content in ''Cannibal Holocaust'', such as graphic violence and animal death, and the documentary that is produced in ''Cannibal Holocaust'' resembles a Mondo film.<ref name=\"Goodall\"/><ref name=\"killing for culture\"/> The scene of Monroe bathing naked in a river and the scene of a [[forced abortion]] rite have also been noted as being similar to scenes in Antonio Climati's Mondo film ''[[Savana violenta]]''.<ref name=\"Goodall\"/>\n\nThe Italian screenwriter [[Gianfranco Clerici]] wrote the script under the working title ''Green Inferno''. He had collaborated with Deodato in his previous films ''Ultimo mondo cannibale'' and ''[[The House on the Edge of the Park]]'', the latter of which was filmed before ''Cannibal Holocaust'' but released afterward. The screenplay included multiple scenes that did not make the film's final cut, including a scene in which a group of Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6 cuts off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeds him to [[piranha]]s in a river. This scene was to take place directly after Monroe's team rescues a smaller group of Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6 from the Shamatari.<ref name=\"script\"/> Attempts were made to film this scene, but the [[underwater camera]] did not operate properly, and the piranha were difficult to control. As a result, Deodato abandoned his efforts, and still photographs taken during the scene's setup are its only known depiction.<ref name=\"Interview 2\"/> The originally scripted version of ''The Last Road to Hell'', which was written to depict soldiers advancing upon an enemy position, also went unused, as Deodato instead decided to use stock footage of political executions for the segment in order to draw further parallels to the films of Jacopetti.<ref name=\"Interview 2\"/> The character names Mark Williams and Shanda Tommaso in Clerici's screenplay were also changed to Mark Tomaso and Faye Daniels, respectively, in the film.<ref name=\"script\">Clerici, Gianfranco.

However, the film had to establish a European nationality so that it could be more easily distributed among European countries.<ref name=\"Euro\">{{Citation|last=Gyory|first=Michel| title=Making and Distributing Films in Europe: The Problem of Nationality|publisher= European Audiovisual Observatory|year=2000}}</ref> Under Italian law, for the film to be recognized as Italian, at least two actors who spoke Italian as a native language had to star in the film.<ref name=\"In the Jungle\"/><ref name=\"Euro\"/> [[Luca Barbareschi|Luca Giorgio Barbareschi]] and [[Francesca Ciardi]], two inexperienced students from the [[Actors Studio]] in [[New York City]], were cast as Mark Tomaso and Faye Daniels, respectively, in part because they were native Italian speakers who also spoke English. Deodato also hired an American from the Actors Studio, [[Perry Pirkanen]], to play Jack Anders.<ref name=\"In the Jungle\"/>\n\nA friend of Pirkanen was initially cast to play Alan Yates, but he dropped out of the film shortly before the production team left for the Amazon.<ref name=\"Interview\"/> He instead appears in the film as an ex-colleague of Yates.<ref name=\"Interview 2\"/> [[Casting director]] Bill Williams subsequently contacted [[Carl Gabriel Yorke]] to play the role. Yorke, a [[stage actor]] who had studied under [[Uta Hagen]], was chosen in part because he was the right size for the costumes and boots, which had already been purchased. Because ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was a [[SAG-AFTRA|non-union]] production, Yorke originally wanted to be credited under the stage name Christopher Savage, although he ultimately decided it to be unnecessary due to the film's obscurity and remote filming location.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite interview |last=Yorke |first=Carl Gabriel |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]] |title=Alan Yates Uncovered |location=Palo Alto, California |date=12 May 2005 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Kerman]] had years of experience working in [[adult film]]s under the pseudonym R. Bolla, including the well-known ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'', before breaking into the Italian film industry. Kerman was recommended to Deodato for his previous film, ''[[The Concorde Affair]]'', in which Kerman played an air traffic controller, and his performance impressed Deodato enough to have Kerman cast as Harold Monroe in ''Cannibal Holocaust''. Kerman went on to star in the Italian [[cannibal film]]s ''[[Eaten Alive!]]'' and ''[[Cannibal Ferox]]'', both directed by [[Umberto Lenzi]]. Kerman's girlfriend at the time was cast as one of the station executives, as she was available to film in both New York City and Rome.<ref name=\"Exposed\"/>\n\n===Direction===\nFilm historian David Kerekes contends that the film's sense of reality is based on the direction and the treatment of the film team's recovered footage, noting that the \"shaky hand-held camerawork commands a certain realism, and 'The Green Inferno,' the ill-fated team's film-within-a-film here, is no exception\", and that \"this very instability gives the 'Green Inferno' film its authentic quality.\"<ref name=\"killing for culture\"/> David Carter of the cult horror [[webzine]] ''Savage Cinema'' says that Deodato's methods added a [[first-person narration]] quality to the film team's footage, writing: \"The viewer feels as if they are there with the crew, experiencing the horrors with them.\"<ref name=\"David Carter\"/> Deodato was proud of other aspects of the [[cinematography]], namely the numerous moving shots using a standard, shoulder-mounted [[movie camera|camera]], foregoing the use of a [[steadicam]].<ref name=\"Interview 2\"/>\n\nKerekes noted the animal slaughter and inclusion of footage from ''The Last Road to Hell'' as adding to the sense of reality of the film.<ref name=\"killing for culture\">{{cite book |last=Kerekes |first=David |author2=Slater, David |title=Killing for Culture: Death Film from Mondo to Snuff |date=January 1996 |publisher=Creation Books |location=UK |isbn=1-871592-20-8}}</ref> [[Lloyd Kaufman]] of [[Troma Entertainment]] compares these scenes to [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]'s theory of [[Montage sequence|montage]], saying: \"In ''Cannibal Holocaust'', we see the actors kill and rip apart a giant sea turtle and other animals.

The scenes featuring the film team were shot first with handheld [[16mm]] cameras in a ''cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9'' style that mimicked an observational documentary, a technique Deodato had learned from his mentor [[Roberto Rossellini]]. This same style was also used by Climati in his Mondo film ''[[Ultime grida dalla savana]]'', which may have been influential on Deodato's direction.<ref name = \"Goodall\"/> After shooting with the film team was completed, Kerman flew down to film his scenes in the rainforest and then to [[New York City|New York]] to film exterior shots in the city. Leticia was only accessible by aircraft, and from there, the cast and crew had to travel by boat to reach the set.<ref name=\"Gelend\">{{cite video |people=Gelend, Antonio (interviewee) |date=2003 |title=In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust |medium=Documentary |location=Italy |publisher=Alan Young Pictures}}</ref><ref name=\"Interview\"/> The interior shots of New York were filmed later in a studio in Rome.<ref name=\"Interview 2\"/><ref name=\"Comment\"/>\n\nProduction on the film was delayed numerous times while in the Amazon. After the actor originally cast as Alan Yates dropped out of the role, filming was halted for two weeks until new casting calls were completed and Yorke arrived in Leticia.<ref name=\"Interview\"/> During principal filming with Kerman, the father of the actor who played Miguel was murdered, and production was again halted as the actor flew back to [[Bogot\u00e1]] to attend his father's funeral.<ref name=\"Interview 2\"/> The locale also presented problems for the production, in particular the heat and sudden rain storms, which sporadically delayed filming.<ref name=\"Gelend\"/><ref name=\"D'Offizi\">{{cite video | people = D'Offizi, Sergio (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref>\n\nInterpersonal relationships were strained on the set. Kerman and Deodato frequently clashed, as the two got into long, drawn-out arguments every day of shooting, usually because of remarks made by Deodato to which Kerman took offense.<ref name=\"Interview 2\"/><ref name=\"Comment\">{{cite interview |last=Kerman |first=Robert |subject-link=Robert Kerman |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]], [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=12 November 2000 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref> Although Deodato noted that the two were always friendly again a few minutes later,<ref name=\"Interview 2\"/> Kerman expressed his personal dislike of Deodato in several interviews. He described Deodato as remorseless and uncaring on set<ref name=\"Comment\"/> and stated that he did not believe that Deodato had a soul.<ref name=\"Exposed\"/> Kerman also noted hostile treatment of other cast and crew members by Deodato, stating: \"He was a sadist. He was particularly sadistic to people that couldn't answer back, people that were Colombian, [and] people that were Italian but could be sent home.\"<ref>The Gore-Met (December 2005). \"A Forbidden Feast of Flesh\". Rue Morgue Magazine #52, 30\u201332.</ref> Yorke and co-star Perry Pirkanen also did not get along, which Yorke attributed to disappointment that Pirkanen felt after his friend dropped out of the production. Yorke also alienated Ciardi after he declined to have sex with her in preparation for filming their sex scene.<ref name=\"Interview\"/>\n\nMultiple cast and crew members were uncomfortable with the film's graphic content, in particular the genuine killing of animals. Yorke described the shoot as having \"a level of cruelty unknown to me\" and was initially unsure if he was taking part in a [[snuff film]]. When his character was scripted to kill a pig on camera, Yorke refused, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. Yorke had traveled with the pig to the set and felt he had formed a relationship with the animal. When it was shot, the emotional impact of hearing the pig squeal subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because the production did not have access to additional pigs.<ref name=\"Interview\"/> Kerman similarly objected to the killing of the [[coati]] and stormed off the set while its death scene was filmed; he had repeatedly pressed Deodato to let the animal go in the minutes leading up to filming.<ref name=\"Exposed\"/> Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle,<ref name=\"Interview 2\"/> and crew members vomited off camera when a [[squirrel monkey]] was killed for the film.<ref name=\"Interview\"/>\n\nThe film's sexual content also proved a point of contention among the cast members. Ciardi did not want to bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Yorke, and she became agitated with him during the filming of the scene. When she refused to comply with the direction, Deodato led her off the set and screamed at her in Italian until she agreed to perform the scene as instructed. Yorke also became severely upset while filming a scene in which his character takes a part in the rape of a native girl. The film's content had given Yorke anxiety throughout his time in Colombia, and this tension peaked during the rape scene. His experiences on set ultimately weighed so heavily on him that Yorke ended his relationship with his girlfriend in New York shortly after his return from the Amazon.<ref name=\"Interview\"/>\n\nYorke experienced unfair payment practices when his first payment for the film came in the form of [[Colombian peso]]s and was less than what had been agreed upon. He refused to continue shooting until he was paid the correct amount in [[United States dollar]]s. The native extras also went unpaid for their work despite their involvement in numerous dangerous scenes, including a scene in which they were forced to stay inside a burning hut for a prolonged period of time.<ref name=\"Interview\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{listen|pos=Right|filename=Main Theme.ogg|title=\"Cannibal Holocaust (Main Theme)\"|description=Thirty second audio sample of the theme from ''Cannibal Holocaust''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe film's soundtrack was composed entirely by Italian composer [[Riz Ortolani]], whom Deodato specifically requested because of Ortolani's work in ''Mondo Cane''. Deodato was particularly fond of the film's main theme, \"Ti guarder\u00f2 nel cuore\", which was given lyrics and became a worldwide [[pop music|pop]] hit under the title \"[[More (Mondo Cane theme)|More]]\". The music of ''Cannibal Holocaust'' is a variety of styles, from a gentle melody in the \"Main Theme\", to a sad and flowing score in \"Crucified Woman\", and faster and more upbeat tracks in \"Cameraman's Recreation\", \"Relaxing in the Savannah\", and \"Drinking Coco\", to the sinister-sounding \"Massacre of the Troupe\".

David Carter says: \"''Cannibal Holocaust'' is not merely focused on the societal taboo of [[Cannibalism|flesh eating]]. The greater theme of the film is the difference between the civilized and the uncivilized. Though the graphic violence can be hard for most to stomach, the most disturbing aspect of the film is what Deodato is saying about modern society. The film asks the questions 'What is it to be 'civilized'?' and 'Is it a good thing?{{' \"}}<ref name=\"David Carter\"/> Mark Goodall, author of ''Sweet & Savage: The World Through the Shockumentary Film Lens'', also contends the film's message is [to show] \"the rape of the natural world by the unnatural; the exploitation of 'primitive' cultures for Western entertainment.\"<ref name=\"Goodall\"/>\n\nDeodato's intentions regarding the Italian media coverage of the Red Brigades have also fallen under critical examination and has been expanded to include all [[sensationalism]]. Carter explores this, claiming that \"[the lack of journalistic integrity] is shown through the interaction between Professor Monroe and the news agency that had backed the documentary crew. They continually push Monroe to finish editing the footage because blood and guts equal [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].\"<ref name=\"David Carter\"/> Lloyd Kaufman claims that this form of exploitative journalism can still be seen in the media today and in programming such as [[reality television]].<ref name=\"Kaufman\"/> Goodall and film historians David Slater and David Kerekes have also suggested that Deodato was attempting to comment on the documentary works of Antonio Climati with his film.<ref name=\"Goodall\">{{cite book |last=Goodall |first=Mark |title=Sweet and Savage: The World Through the Shockumentary Film Lens |year=2006 |publisher=Headpress |location=[[London]], UK |isbn=1-900486-49-0}}</ref><ref name=\"killing for culture\"/>\n\nDespite these interpretations, Deodato has said in interviews that he had no intentions in ''Cannibal Holocaust'' but to make a film about cannibals.<ref name=\"Kaufman\"/> Actor [[Luca Barbareschi]] asserts this as well and believes that Deodato only uses his films to \"put on a show\".<ref name=\"Luca\">{{cite video | people = Barbareschi, Luca (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref> Robert Kerman contradicts these assertions, stating that Deodato did tell him of political concerns involving the media in the making of this film.<ref name=\"Exposed\">{{cite interview |last=Kerman |first=Robert |subject-link=Robert Kerman |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]], [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Robert Kerman Exposed |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=15 November 2000 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}</ref>\n\nThese interpretations have also been criticized as hypocritical and poor justification for the film's content, as ''Cannibal Holocaust'' itself is highly sensationalized. Firsching claims that \"The fact that the film's sole spokesperson for the anti-exploitation perspective is played by porn star [[Robert Kerman]] should give an indication of where its sympathies lie\",<ref name=\"AllMovie\"/> while Schager says Deodato is \"pathetically justifying the unrepentant carnage by posthumously damning his eaten filmmaker protagonists with a 'who are the real monsters \u2013 the cannibals or us?' anti-imperialism morale.\"<ref name=\"Schager\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nickschager.com/nsfp/2005/08/cannibal_holoca.html | title=The Nick Schager Film Project: Cannibal Holocaust | author=Schager, Nick |publisher=Nick Schager Film Project |access-date=15 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\nSince its original release, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' has been the target of censorship by moral and animal activists. Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and genuine [[Animal cruelty|cruelty to animals]], issues which find ''Cannibal Holocaust'' in the midst of controversy to this day. Due to this notoriety, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' has been marketed as having been banned in over 50 countries.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Cannibal Holocaust 25th Anniversary Edition |others=[[Ruggero Deodato|Deodato, Ruggero]] |type=back cover |publisher=VIPCO (Video Instant Picture Company) |location=UK |id=VIP666SE |year=2004}}</ref> In 2006, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine named ''Cannibal Holocaust'' as the 20th most controversial film of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever |url=https://ew.com/gallery/25-most-controversial-movies-ever |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue=882 |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=Entertainment Weekly Inc. |date=16 June 2006 |access-date=1 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Snuff film allegations===\n[[Image:CannibalHolocaustimpale.jpg|right|thumb|The film's impalement scene was one of several scenes examined by the courts to determine whether the violence depicted was staged or genuine.]]\nTen days after its premiere in Milan, ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was confiscated under the orders of a local magistrate,<ref>Sumner, Don: ''Horror Movie Freak'', p. 189 (Krause Publications, 2010). {{ISBN|978-1-4402-0824-9}}.</ref> and Ruggero Deodato was charged with obscenity. As all copies were to be turned over to the authorities, the film was released in other countries like the United Kingdom via subterfuge.<ref name=\"In the Jungle\"/> In January 1981, during the film's theatrical run in France, the magazine ''[[Photo (French magazine)|Photo]]'' suggested that certain deaths depicted in the film were real, which would have made ''Cannibal Holocaust'' a [[snuff film]].<ref>King, Geoff: ''The Spectacle of The Real: From Hollywood to 'Reality' TV and Beyond'' (Intellect Ltd., 2005). {{ISBN|1-84150-120-4}}.</ref> Following the publication of the ''Photo'' article, the charges against Deodato were amended to include murder. The courts believed that the actors who portrayed the missing film crew and the native actress featured in the impalement scene were killed for the camera.<ref name=\"In the Jungle\"/><ref name=\"Interview 2\"/>\n\nCompounding matters was the fact that the supposedly deceased actors had signed contracts with the production which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. This was done in order to promote the idea that ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians. During the subsequent court proceedings, questions arose as to why the actors were in no other media if they were alive as Deodato claimed.<ref name=\"In the Jungle\"/><ref name=\"Interview 2\"/>\n\nTo prove his innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get in contact with the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian television show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood in her mouth and looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.<ref name=\"In the Jungle\"/><ref name=\"Interview 2\"/>\n\n===Censorship===\nAlthough the snuff film allegations were successfully refuted, the Italian courts decided to ban ''Cannibal Holocaust'' due to the genuine animal slayings, citing animal cruelty laws. Deodato, Franco Palaggi, Franco Di Nunzio, Gianfranco Clerici, producer Alda Pia and [[United Artists|United Artists Europa]] representative Sandro Perotti each received a four-month suspended sentence after they were all convicted of obscenity and violence. Deodato fought in the courts for three additional years to get his film unbanned. In 1984, the courts ruled in favor of Deodato, and ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was granted a rating certificate of VM18 for a cut print. It would later be re-released uncut.<ref name=\"In the Jungle\">{{cite video | people = Deodato, Ruggero (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}</ref><ref name=\"Interview 2\"/>\n\n''Cannibal Holocaust'' also faced censorship issues in other countries around the world. In 1981, video releases were not required to pass before the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] (BBFC), which had power to ban films in the United Kingdom. ''Cannibal Holocaust'' was released [[Direct-to-video|straight-to-video]] there, thus avoiding the possible banning of the film. This did not save the movie, however, because in 1983, the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] compiled a list of 72 video releases that were not brought before the BBFC for certification and declared them prosecutable for obscenity. This list of \"[[Video nasty|video nasties]]\" included ''Cannibal Holocaust'', which was successfully prosecuted and banned. The film was not approved for release in the UK until 2001, albeit with nearly six minutes of mandated cuts. In 2011, the BBFC waived all but one of these previous edits and passed ''Cannibal Holocaust'' with fifteen seconds of cuts. It was determined that the only scene that breached the BBFC's guidelines was the killing of a [[coati]]mundi, and the BBFC acknowledged that previous cuts were reactionary to the film's reputation.<ref name=\"bbfc ch\">{{cite web|title=Cannibal Holocaust|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/cannibal-holocaust |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]|access-date=23 December 2013|date=5 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe film was also banned in [[Australia]], the [[United States]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]],<ref name=\"tonight ggs\">{{cite news|url=http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=347&fArticleId=5128279|title=Gratuitous Gore and Sex|last=Davis|first=Laura|date=16 August 2009|work=Tonight|publisher=Tonight & Independent Online|access-date=2010-03-19|location=New Zealand}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[New Zealand]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censorship.govt.nz/oflcdd/DocProps.asp?PubNum=601050 |title=Cannibal Holocaust, OFLC decision |access-date=2008-01-27 |publisher=Office of Film and Literature Classification, New Zealand |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507065416/http://www.censorship.govt.nz/oflcdd/DocProps.asp?PubNum=601050 |archive-date=2008-05-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Singapore]]<ref>{{cite news|title=BANNED: THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL FILMS|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/banned-the-most-controversial-films-1768299.html?action=gallery&ino=14|website=The Independent|access-date=2014-10-02|location=London|first=Laura|last=Davis|date=5 October 2010}}</ref> and several other countries in or before 1984.<ref name=\"Refused\">{{cite web | url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_C.htm#cannibalholocaust | title=Films C | publisher=Refused-Classification.com | access-date=15 January 2007}}</ref> The movie was briefly released in the US by Trans American Films in 1985, but this release lasted for less than a month before being pulled from theaters, likely due to the large controversies surrounding the film.

In 2005, the [[Australian Classification Board|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] in Australia lifted the ban, passing ''Cannibal Holocaust'' with an R18+ rating for the uncut print, including the consumer advice, \"High level sexual violence, high level violence, animal cruelty.\" In 2006, the film was rejected for classification and banned in its entirety by the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|OFLC]] in New Zealand.

In the UK, the film was originally released on [[VHS]] by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These cuts were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape.<ref>{{cite book |last=Egan |first=Kate |title=Trash or Treasure?: Censorship and the Changing Meanings of the Video Nasties |year=2002 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |page=59}}</ref> In 2001, the film was passed for release on [[DVD]] by the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] with five minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of these cuts were waived for a re-release in 2011.<ref name=\"bbfc ch\"/> The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato which reduces the violence toward animals.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Cannibal Holocaust: Ruggero Deodato's New Edit |others=[[Ruggero Deodato|Deodato, Ruggero]] |type=back cover |publisher=Shameless Screen Entertainment |location=UK |id=B0051ZH8CC |year=2011}}</ref> [[Grindhouse Releasing]]'s home video releases contain an \"Animal Cruelty Free\" version of the film that cuts out the six animal deaths. Other versions also contain alternative footage shot specifically for [[Middle East]]ern markets that do not depict nudity.<ref name=\"Interview\"/>\n\nThere are multiple versions of the ''Last Road to Hell'' segment of the film, which causes variances even among uncensored releases. An extended version of ''The Last Road to Hell'' includes approximately 10 seconds of footage not seen in an alternative, shorter version. This additional footage includes a wide-angle shot of firing-squad executions, a close-up of a dead victim, and extended footage of bodies being carried into the back of a truck. The longer version also includes different titles that correctly name the film team as they appear in the final film, while the shorter version gives the names of the film team that originally appear in the script.<ref name=\"roadtohell\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{IMDb title|0078935|Cannibal Holocaust}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|cannibal_holocaust|Cannibal Holocaust}}\n\n{{Ruggero Deodato}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cannibal Holocaust}}\n[[Category:1980 films]]\n[[Category:1980 horror films]]\n[[Category:1980s adventure films]]\n[[Category:1980 controversies]]\n[[Category:Film controversies]]\n[[Category:Film censorship in Italy]]\n[[Category:Film censorship in Iceland]]\n[[Category:Film censorship in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Italian adventure films]]\n[[Category:Italian horror films]]\n[[Category:English-language Italian films]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ruggero Deodato]]\n[[Category:Animal cruelty incidents in film]]\n[[Category:Cannibal-boom films]]\n[[Category:Films about animal cruelty]]\n[[Category:Films about filmmaking]]\n[[Category:Films about hunter-gatherers]]\n[[Category:Films about snuff films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1979]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in South America]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Amazon]]\n[[Category:Films set in Venezuela]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Rome]]\n[[Category:Found footage films]]\n[[Category:Italian independent films]]\n[[Category:Italian mockumentary films]]\n[[Category:Obscenity controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Rape and revenge films]]\n[[Category:Italian splatter films]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Riz Ortolani]]\n[[Category:Censored films]]\n[[Category:Films about missing people]]\n[[Category:Video nasties]]\n[[Category:1980s exploitation films]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
