Directed by [[Scott Cooper (director)|Scott Cooper]] and written by Mark Mallouk and [[Jez Butterworth]], it is based on [[Dick Lehr]] and [[Gerard O'Neill]]'s 2001 book ''Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob''. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Johnny Depp]] as Bulger, alongside [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Jesse Plemons]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Dakota Johnson]], and [[Corey Stoll]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] of the film began on May 19, 2014, in [[Boston]] and wrapped on August 1, 2014. The film had its world premiere at the [[72nd Venice International Film Festival]] and was released by [[Warner Bros.]] worldwide on September 18, 2015. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $99 million on a $53 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1975, [[Whitey Bulger|James \"Whitey\" Bulger]], leader of the [[Winter Hill Gang]], controls most [[organized crime]] within [[South Boston]], along with his right-hand man [[Stephen Flemmi]], newcomer [[Kevin Weeks]], and callous hitman [[Johnny Martorano]]. Bulger lives with his longtime partner Lindsey Cyr and their young son Douglas.\n\nBulger's supremacy is challenged by the [[North End, Boston|North End]]-based [[Angiulo Brothers]], a rival gang that is part of the [[Patriarca crime family|New England Mafia family]]. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[John Connolly (FBI)|John Connolly]] returns to the area, having grown up in South Boston as a friend of Whitey and his brother, [[Massachusetts Senate]] [[President of the Massachusetts Senate|President]] [[William Bulger|William \"Billy\" Bulger]].\n\nAfter the Angiulo Brothers send a motorcycle-riding assassin who murders a Winter Hill soldier, Whitey becomes an informant for Connolly. Connolly believes he can infiltrate the Angiulo Brothers' organization with Whitey's help. Although Whitey hates the idea of being [[Informant|a rat]], he understands the protection doing so would afford him, his gang, and his family. Douglas suffers from [[Reye syndrome]], leading the devastated Lindsey to remove him from life support over Whitey's furious objections.\n\nAlthough Connolly is supported by his co-worker John Morris, their boss, Charles McGuire, is suspicious. Whitey increasingly exploits his status as an informant, using Connolly's \"protection\" as a cover for his crimes. When Connolly demands information on the Angiulos' [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] locations, Whitey gets pictures of the rival gang's hideouts, allowing the FBI to plant [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]]s. The FBI arrests the Angiulos, thus eliminating the remaining opposition to Whitey's power. Blinded by his past, Connolly grows closer to Whitey and the gang and even invites them to his house for a cookout. His wife, Marianne, sees negative changes in her husband as his agent-informant relationship with Whitey grows, including accepting expensive gifts and money from the gang.\n\nAn associate, Brian Halloran, fears for his own life and goes to the FBI to report Whitey's involvement, much to Connolly's displeasure. Connolly then tells Whitey of Halloran's accusation, thereby resulting in the murders of Halloran and an unnamed accomplice. Following his mother's death, Whitey's behavior becomes increasingly violent and unpredictable, deteriorating his informant relationship.\n\nWhen \"bulldog\" [[prosecutor]] Fred Wyshak is appointed the new assistant [[United States Attorney|U. S. Attorney]] in Boston, Connolly attempts to make friends and perhaps divert his attention from Whitey. Still, Wyshak bluntly refuses and demands the FBI arrest him. John McIntyre, an informant within the Winter Hill Gang, informs on an attempt by Whitey to [[smuggle]] [[Arms trafficking|weapons]] for the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]. The shipment is seized, and Whitey kills McIntyre after Connolly tips him off.\n\nWyshak and McGuire investigate Connolly's management of Whitey's informant role and realize that most of the \"tips\" provided by Whitey were already obtained from other informants (that Bulger could've possibly killed since he was ironically known for killing \"Rats\"). Morris, disillusioned and fearing prosecution for his association with Connolly's activities, divulges Connolly's and Whitey's relationship to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', and a front-page story exposes the FBI's links to organized crime. As Connolly, Flemmi, Weeks, and Martorano are arrested, Whitey gives Billy a final goodbye from a gas station pay phone before leaving Boston.\n\nA textual epilogue reveals Weeks received a five-year sentence, Martorano a twelve-year sentence, and Flemmi a life sentence, while Morris received [[legal immunity|immunity]] for his cooperation; Billy became Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts but resigned following the discovery that he was in touch with Whitey; Connolly was convicted of second-degree murder and received a forty-year sentence, and Whitey, after an anonymous tip led to his arrest on June 22, 2011, in Santa Monica, California, received two consecutive life sentences with an added five years.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Whitey Bulger|James \"Whitey\" Bulger]]\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as [[John Connolly (FBI)|John Connolly]]\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[William Bulger|William \"Billy\" Bulger]]<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.boston.com/entertainment/movies/2014/05/21/benedict-cumberbatch-take-bulger-role-black-mass/lTeJtQLzss4DhAEqryGo3M/story.html \"Benedict Cumberbatch to Take On Bulger Role in ''Black Mass''\"], Boston.com; accessed December 8, 2014.</ref><ref>[https://variety.com/2014/film/news/benedict-cumberbatch-replaces-guy-pearce-in-johnny-depps-black-mass-1201188402 \"Benedict Cumberbatch Replaces Guy Pearce in Johnny Depp's Whitey Bulger Movie\"], Variety.com; accessed December 8, 2014.</ref>\n* [[Rory Cochrane]] as [[Stephen Flemmi|Stephen \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi]]\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Charles McGuire<ref name=\"Bacon\"/>\n* [[Jesse Plemons]] as [[Kevin Weeks]]\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as Brian Halloran<ref>[https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/19/peter-sarsgaard-joins-black-mass-cast-as-a-favor \"Peter Sarsgaard joins ''Black Mass'' as a favor\"], IGN.com; accessed December 8, 2014.</ref>\n* [[Dakota Johnson]] as Lindsey Cyr\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as Fred Wyshak\n* [[David Harbour]] as John Morris<ref name=\"Harbour\"/>\n* [[Julianne Nicholson]] as Marianne Connolly (n\u00e9e Lockary)\n* [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Robert Fitzpatrick<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/adam-scott-joins-johnny-depp-706342 \"Adam Scott Joins Johnny Depp in 'Black Mass' (Exclusive)\"], HollywoodReporter.com; accessed December 8, 2014.</ref>\n* [[Brad Carter]] as John McIntyre\n* [[W.
