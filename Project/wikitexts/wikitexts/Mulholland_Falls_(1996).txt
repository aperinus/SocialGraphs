A similar theme is the basis of a 2012 film, ''[[Gangster Squad (film)|Gangster Squad]]'' (in which Nolte also appeared), as well as the television [[miniseries]], ''[[Mob City]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early 1950s, a four-man squad of [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detectives, frustrated with the rules and weaknesses of the legal system stopping them from more aggressively battling crime, commit an [[extrajudicial execution]] when they toss Jack Flynn, a powerful gangster from [[Chicago]], off a cliff on [[Mulholland Drive]], nicknamed \"Mulholland Falls\" for all the criminals they have thrown to their deaths.\n\nThe squad leader, Lieutenant Maxwell Hoover, and his partners Ellery Coolidge, Eddie Hall, and Arthur Relyea are brought in to investigate the suspicious death of a young woman whose body was found at a construction site. An examination reveals that every bone in her body is broken and the coroner comments that she looks as though she \"jumped off a cliff\" even though there are no cliffs nearby. The woman turns out to be someone Hoover knew very well: a prostitute named Allison Pond. The detectives receive a film of Allison having sex in a motel room, taken by a camera hidden behind a two-way mirror. Allison's friend, Jimmy Fields, admits that he and Allison made numerous such films, including one with Hoover in it. Fields is subsequently murdered while being guarded by Hall and Relyea.\n\nRadioactive glass is found in Allison's foot, which leads the detectives to the [[Nevada Test Site]], where they are quickly caught by base security. Their superior, Col. Fitzgerald, threatens to have the squad arrested and prosecuted for trespassing on a secret government facility, but the team is able to escape their predicament when the man in the film is identified as the civilian commander of the base, retired Gen. Thomas Timms. Timms, the head of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], confirms that he slept with Pond, but has an alibi for the day of her death. An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent visits the LAPD and personally asks the chief to stop the investigation; when his request is denied, Hoover's house is ransacked by federal agents with a search warrant, who fail to recover the film. Hoover brutally assaults the FBI agent, after which another film is delivered to his wife Kate, showing her husband and Allison having sex in the motel.\n\nThe blackmailer turns out to be Fitzgerald, who demands the film of Timms with Allison be brought to him. Hoover realizes that Fields' film footage of Allison also includes images of \"atomic soldiers\", American servicemen who were unwillingly used by Fitzgerald as guinea pigs for A-bomb tests before being transferred to a secure military hospital ward on his orders; the colonel intends to let them die so he can avoid being held accountable. Hoover and Coolidge fly to the base, and secretly deliver the film to Timms, who is terminally ill with cancer himself, so he can expose Fitzgerald's wrongdoing.\n\nFor their return trip to Los Angeles, Hoover and Coolidge board a [[Douglas DC-3|C-47]] cargo plane, where they are joined by Fitzgerald and his aide, the Captain. During the flight, Hoover deduces how Pond was murdered and tells Coolidge that Fitzgerald is going to kill them the same way - by throwing them out of the plane in mid-flight. In a vicious struggle, the detectives fight for their lives. Coolidge charges the Captain as gunshots go off. The detectives are finally able to throw the Captain and Fitzgerald out of the plane, both falling to their deaths. The pilot is also accidentally shot, but manages a crash landing before he dies. Coolidge celebrates the landing until realizing that he, too, has been shot, also dying at the scene.\n\nHoover cannot reconcile with his wife at Coolidge's funeral because she feels betrayed and heartbroken, and afterwards, she leaves him for good. With the news that his unit has been disbanded in order to protect the LAPD's image, Hoover is left with nothing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Lieutenant Max Hoover\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Katherine Hoover\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Detective Ellery Coolidge\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Detective Eddie Hall\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Detective Arthur Relyea\n* [[Treat Williams]] as Colonel Nathan Fitzgerald\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Allison Pond\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Jimmy Fields\n* [[John Malkovich]] as General Thomas Timms\n* [[Daniel Baldwin]] as FBI Special Agent Jeffrey McCafferty\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as The Captain\n* [[William Petersen]] as Jack Flynn (uncredited)\n* [[Titus Welliver]] as Kenny Kamins\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as Detective Earl\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Flynn's Associate (uncredited)\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as LAPD Chief [[William H.

It's a 1950s crime movie, but with a modern, ironic edge: The cops are just a shade over the top, just slightly in on the joke. They smoke all through the movie, but there's one scene where they're disturbed and thoughtful, and they all light up and smoke furiously, the smoke lit by the [[Cinematography|cinematographer]] to look like great billowing clouds, and you smile, because you know the scene is really about itself.'<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mulholland-falls-1996 Ebert, Roger].

This director's first Hollywood film has such punch, in fact, that it takes a while to realize how slight and sometimes noxious its concerns really are. But ''Mulholland Falls'' is so well cast and relentlessly stylish (thanks to some fine technical talent assembled here) that its sheer energy prevails over its shaky plot. After all, when a filmmaker can show Ms. Griffith contentedly reading ''[[A Farewell to Arms]],'' there's not much he won't do. So this film has all the ''Chinatown'' staples\u2014dangerous sex, corrupt power and a vast environment-damaging conspiracy\u2014along with mushroom clouds, porn movies, a crash-landing airplane and many quick bursts of one-on-one violence.'<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/26/movies/film-review-high-test-swagger-by-burly-buddies.html Maslin, Janet].

Writing for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', he noted: \"''Mulholland Falls'' falls flat a lot. The best of the old ''[[film noir|noir]]'' detective dramas had lively pacing and crisp tough-guy dialogue. This movie seems at times like an exercise in slow motion and in dull, cumbersome writing (the script is by novelist and former newspaper columnist [[Pete Dexter]], who wrote the screenplay for ''[[Rush (1991 film)|Rush]]'').\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Nolte-Takes-Plunge-Into-Noir-Mulholland-Falls-2984522.php Stack, Peter].
