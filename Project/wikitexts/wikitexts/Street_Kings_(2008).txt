The initial screenplay drafts were written by [[James Ellroy]] in the late 1990s under the title ''The Night Watchman''.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on April 11, 2008 and was followed by a [[direct-to-video]] [[stand-alone sequel]] ''[[Street Kings 2: Motor City]]'' in 2011, with [[Clifton Powell]] returning as a corrupt cop.\n\n==Plot==\nTom Ludlow, an [[alcoholic]], undercover detective for the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], meets with Korean gangsters who he believes have kidnapped two teenage girls. During their meeting, he provokes them into beating him and stealing his car, but he has planted a tracking device in advance and tracks the vehicle to the gang's hideout via [[GPS]].\n\nUpon reaching their hideout, Ludlow storms in and kills the gangsters before altering the scene to make the shootings look justified, then finds the girls locked in a closet. While the rest of his unit congratulate him, he is confronted by his former partner, Detective Terrence Washington, who has grown weary of police corruption, and has begun reporting problems to Captain James Biggs of [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]], who apparently starts an investigation against Ludlow.\n\nBelieving that Washington has been snitching on him, Ludlow follows him to a convenience store to beat him up. However, Washington is killed by two gangsters under the pretense of a robbery, and the surveillance video of the encounter shows Ludlow to have accidentally shot Washington while trying to protect him with his gun.\n\nThe DNA of two criminals known as Fremont and Coates is found at the scene, as well as a large amount of cash in Washington's possession. The investigation assumes that Washington was corrupt and stealing drugs from the [[evidence room]] and selling them to Fremont and Coates. Ludlow then enlists the help of Detective Paul Diskant in his personal investigation.\n\nAs Ludlow and Diskant investigate, they eventually find a house in the hills where they discover the bodies of the real Fremont and Coates buried in a shallow grave; the condition of the bodies makes it apparent that they were killed long before Washington's death.\n\nLudlow and Diskant then pose as dirty cops who are willing to take over the stealing and selling of drugs, and are able to set up a meeting with the two criminals masquerading as Fremont and Coates. Ludlow questions who the two really are, but Diskant is fatally shot when he recognizes them. Ludlow manages to kill both men and escape back to his girlfriend's house, and he discovers from a news report that they were undercover [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] deputies.\n\nLater, Ludlow is taken by Detective Cosmo Santos and Detective Dante Demille, who admit that they planted Fremont and Coates' DNA and the money at the scene of Washington's murder; Ludlow realizes that Washington was informing on Captain Jack Wander to Biggs, as he was the one stealing drugs from the department's evidence room.\n\nSantos and Demille take Ludlow out to the house where the bodies of the real Fremont and Coates were buried to execute him, but Ludlow manages to kill both of them. He then heads to Washington's house where he finds Sergeant Mike Clady about to kill Washington's widow, but he is able to subdue Clady and places him in the trunk of his car.\n\nLudlow confronts Wander at his house and apprehends him after a brawl. He then discovers that Wander has incriminating evidence against several high ranking officials in the department and other politicians, with which he would have used to become LAPD chief and eventually, mayor. Wander, asserting that he is Ludlow's friend and mentor, attempts to bribe him with a large amount of money and incriminating documents, but Ludlow refuses and executes Wander.\n\nLater, Captain Biggs and Sergeant Green arrive, and Biggs reveals to Ludlow that they used him to bring down Wander and get access to his files by opening his eyes to the real corruption going on within his unit. As he leaves, Biggs tells Ludlow that the department does need him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Detective Tom \"Phonebook Tom\" Ludlow\n* [[Hugh Laurie]] as Captain Jimmy Biggs\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Detective Paul \"Disco\" Diskant\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Captain Jack Wander\n* [[Naomie Harris]] as Linda Washington\n* [[John Corbett]] as Detective Dante Demille\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Winston \"Scribble\"\n* [[Jay Mohr]] as Sergeant Mike Clady\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Detective Terrence Washington\n* [[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Fake Coates\n* [[Cle Shaheed Sloan]] as Fake Fremont\n* [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] as \"Grill\"\n* [[Kenneth Choi]] as Boss Kim\n* [[Martha Higareda]] as Grace Garcia\n* [[Amaury Nolasco]] as Detective Cosmo Santos\n* [[Clifton Powell]] as Sergeant Green\n* [[Noel G.]] as \"Quicks\"\n\n==Production==\nIn 2004, it was announced that [[Spike Lee]] would be directing the film for a 2005 release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/reeveskeanu/a/watchman111604.htm |title=The Night Watchman Movie - Keanu Reeves to Star in The Night Watchman (Street Kings) |publisher=Movies.about.com |date=2004-11-16 |access-date=2012-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607052453/http://movies.about.com/od/reeveskeanu/a/watchman111604.htm |archive-date=2011-06-07 }}</ref> In 2005, it was announced that [[Oliver Stone]] was in talks to direct the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/moviesinproduction/a/watchman042805.htm |title=The Night Watchman Movie - Oliver Stone May Direct The Night Watchman (Street Kings) |publisher=Movies.about.com |date=2005-04-25 |access-date=2012-05-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607052458/http://movies.about.com/od/moviesinproduction/a/watchman042805.htm |archive-date=2011-06-07 }}</ref> However, Stone later denied this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/13/stone-denies-night-watchman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525211043/http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/613/613388p1.html |archive-date=May 25, 2005 |title=IGN: Stone Denies Night Watchman |publisher=IGN |access-date=2022-01-18}}</ref> ''[[Training Day]]'' [[screenwriter]] [[David Ayer]] took over the project.\n\nOn February 5, 2008, it was announced that [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] changed the film's title from ''The Night Watchman'' to ''Street Kings''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/41661-the-night-watchman-retitled-to-street-kings |title=The Night Watchman Retitled to Street Kings |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=2008-02-05 |access-date=2022-01-18}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] 36% of 152 reviews of the film are positive with average rating of 5.11/10.
