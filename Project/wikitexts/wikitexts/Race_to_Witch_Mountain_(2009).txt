It was [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s third film adaptation of the novel; the second was ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain (1995 film)|Escape to Witch Mountain]]'' (1995). Filming began in Los Angeles in March 2008. It was released on March 13, 2009 to mixed reviews but was a box office success.\n\nIt is Johnson's second collaboration with Fickman, following ''[[The Game Plan (film)|The Game Plan]]'', which was also a live-action movie released by Disney.\n\n== Plot ==\nAn [[Ufo|alien spacecraft]] crashes near [[Searchlight, Nevada]], 45 miles outside of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Project Moon Dust, a secret [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] unit led by Henry Burke, arrive at the scene of the crash in [[black helicopters]]. [[Men in black]] seize the [[Ufo|spaceship]] and search for its passengers with the intention of harnessing their [[DNA]] and powers.\n\nBack in Vegas, former mob getaway driver Jack Bruno works as a [[taxi cab driver]] to avoid returning to jail. One of his passengers is Dr. Alex Friedman, a failed [[astrophysicist]] who has come to Vegas to speak at a [[UFO convention]] at the [[Planet Hollywood hotel]].\n\nAfter fending off two thugs who seek his services for a mob boss named Andrew Wolfe, Bruno finds two teenagers, Sara and Seth, in his cab. They offer $15,000 to drive them to an unknown destination. Burke's men track down the teenagers (who turn out to be the spaceship's passengers) through various discoveries such as stolen clothes, a car being burglarized, a bus leading to Las Vegas, and an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] being deprived of all of its contents, which eventually pinpoints their location in Bruno's taxi. They engage Bruno in a high speed chase. Mistaking the government agents for more mob thugs, he tries to evade them with his driving skills. Seth's ability to vary his molecular density, as well as Sara's [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]], helps the group to escape.\n\nWhen they arrive at an abandoned house, Bruno follows them out of concern and curiosity. The teenagers retrieve the device they were looking for within a hidden underground laboratory, but the three are attacked by the \"Siphon\", a powerful armored alien assassin. The Siphon pursues the group until its spaceship crashes into a train and the creature is wounded. After Seth and Sara prove their otherworldly biology to Bruno, the three settle at a diner to calm their nerves, only to be tracked by and escape from Burke's agents again.\n\nBruno brings Seth and Sara to Dr. Friedman at the UFO convention. Despite initially dismissing Bruno's story, she believes him after Seth and Sara show off their powers and narrate their current situation: they are aliens from a dying planet located 3,000 [[light year]]s from [[Earth]], and are able to travel by using wormholes on their spaceships. Its government intends to invade Earth, despite the majority of their race being fully opposed to the plan, so that their kind may survive. Seth and Sara's parents are scientists who sought a way to save their planet without invasion, but were arrested before completing their experiment. The teenagers came to retrieve the successful results, but the alien government (who still have their sights on invading Earth rather than trying to save their home planet) sent the Siphon to stop them. To save both worlds, they must retrieve their spaceship and return home with the results in order to prevent the invasion from happening.\n\nFriedman then realizes that the teenagers are what she has been searching for and joins the group. They meet fellow [[UFOlogist]] and [[conspiracy theorist]] Dr. Donald Harlan, who tells them that the spaceship was taken to the secret US government base named Witch Mountain. Harlan and his men distract the soldiers with Bruno's taxi while the others escape to Witch Mountain in Harlan's RV after evading the Siphon. The group arrives at the base, but are captured by Burke. He orders that the teenagers be prepared for [[vivisection]], but Burke frees the adults, confident that nobody will believe them.\n\nThe Siphon attacks Witch Mountain and engages the soldiers, allowing Bruno and Friedman to infiltrate the base and free Seth and Sara. They launch the ship, escape through the mountain's tunnels, and finally kill The Siphon, who has stowed away on the spaceship. The teenagers give Bruno and Friedman a tracking device that will allow the aliens to always find them. They tearfully wish them farewell, but not before Sara gives her telepathic powers to Bruno.\n\nSome weeks later, Bruno and Friedman become successful authors of a book named ''Race to Witch Mountain: A True Story''. They promote their book and knowledge on the UFO convention circuit, explaining that the publicity protects them from government reprisal. As they leave the convention, the alien device activates, implying that the alien teenagers may be returning to Earth.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Jack Bruno, who is a [[Las Vegas]] [[cab driver]] and a former [[convict]].<ref name=rock/> The director wrote in a cab driver as a main character because there was a unique relationship between the driver and his passengers.
