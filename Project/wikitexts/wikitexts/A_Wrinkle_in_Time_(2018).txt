Meg and her [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] younger brother [[Charles Wallace Murry|Charles Wallace]] are sent to the principal after Charles scolds a pair of gossiping teachers, and Meg retaliates against Veronica, Meg's neighbor and longtime bully. Meg and her mother Kate discover Charles with an unusual visitor, Mrs. Whatsit, who claims that the tesseract \u2013 a method of space travel Alex was studying \u2013 is real.\n\nMeg and Charles meet her classmate [[Calvin O'Keefe]], who joins them at the house of Mrs. Who, another strange friend of Charles who speaks only in quotations. Calvin has dinner with the Murrys, and Kate remembers Alex's commitment to their research despite public ridicule. In the backyard, Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who appear with Mrs. Which, revealing themselves as astral travelers. Explaining that they have come to help find Alex, who has transported himself across the universe, the Misses lead Meg, Calvin, and Charles through a tesseract to the distant planet Uriel.\n\nThe planet's sentient flowers confirm that Alex visited Uriel, and Mrs. Whatsit transforms into a flying creature, carrying the children into the sky. Calvin nearly falls to his death after noticing a dark planet that Mrs. Which identifies as Camazotz, home to an evil energy known as \"the IT\". They [[teleportation|tesser]] to the planet Orion to seek the help of a seer named Happy Medium. Mrs. Which reveals that the IT spreads negativity throughout the universe, including on Earth: Charles' gossiping teachers were jealous of the principal's promotion; Veronica judges herself for her weight; the Murrys' kindly neighbor is mugged by severely insecure teens; and Calvin's father is an abusive [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]].\n\nHappy Medium helps Meg overcome her self-doubt, and they learn that her father tessered to Uriel, then Ixchel, but was trapped on Camazotz. The Misses insist they regroup on Earth, but Meg's determination to save her father overrides the tesseract, unintentionally redirecting them to Camazotz. Unable to stay, as Camazotz's evil is stronger than their light, the Misses bestow gifts before departing: Mrs. Who gives Meg her glasses to see what is really there, Mrs. Whatsit gives Meg the knowledge of her faults, and Mrs. Which gives the children the command to never separate.\n\nA forest appears, separating Meg and Calvin from Charles, and they are pursued by a tornado-like storm. Meg uses the storm's own force to [[gravity assist|slingshot]] her and Calvin atop a cliff wall, where they reunite with Charles. They find themselves in a neighborhood of look-alike homes, children, and mothers; one woman invites them inside but Meg declines, reminding Calvin and Charles not to trust anyone. Their surroundings transform into a crowded beach, where a man introduces himself as Red, assuring them Alex is safe, and offers them food. When Charles says it tastes like sand, Red possesses him through the IT, which Red is actually a puppet of.\n\nMeg and Calvin chase after Red and Charles through the crowd, but are trapped in a seemingly empty, spherical room. Red deactivates while Charles taunts Meg and Calvin. Using Mrs. Who's glasses, Meg finds an invisible staircase to another room where her father is imprisoned. After a tearful reunion, they are dragged by Charles to meet his master. As Calvin and Meg fall under the IT's power, Alex opens a tesseract to escape with the two of them. Refusing to abandon Charles, Meg projects back to Camazotz and confronts the IT in its malevolent, [[neuron]]-like form.\n\nCharles and the IT try to force Meg to give in to darkness, menacing her with an idealized version of herself, but Meg embraces her own imperfections and uses her love for her brother to free him. The IT dissipates as the Misses reappear, congratulating Meg and Charles on becoming \"warriors of light\", and Meg tessers them home. Alex is reunited with his family, and Calvin leaves to confront his father, as Meg looks to the sky, thanking the Misses.<ref>{{Citation|title=A Wrinkle in Time (2018) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/plotsummary|access-date=2021-06-26}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]] as Mrs. Which, an astral being as old as the universe\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Mrs. Whatsit, an astral being whose favorite planet is the planet Uriel\n* [[Mindy Kaling]] as Mrs. Who, an astral being from the planet Ixchel\n* [[Storm Reid]] as [[Meg Murry]], a gifted young girl who's been bullied by Veronica for the past years\n** Lyric Wilson as young Meg\n* [[Levi Miller]] as [[Calvin O'Keefe]], Meg's classmate and friend\n* Deric McCabe as [[Charles Wallace Murry]], Meg's smart adoptive six-year-old brother who gets hypnotized by the IT\n* [[Chris Pine]] as Dr. Alexander Murry, Meg and Charles Wallace's long-lost father and Kate's husband\n* [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as Dr. Kate Murry, Meg and Charles Wallace's mother and Alex's wife\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Happy Medium, a seer from the planet Orion\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Red,<ref name=\"wdsm_press_kit\"/> a form of The IT\n**[[David Oyelowo]] as The IT, Red's true diabolical form<ref name=\"wdsm_press_kit\"/>\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Holland]] as James Jenkins, the principal of Meg, Calvin and Charles Wallace's school<ref name=\"wdsm_press_kit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdsmediafile.com/media/AWrinkleInTime/writen-material/AWrinkleInTime5a989b04754db.pdf |title=A Wrinkle in Time Press Kit |publisher=[[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]] |access-date=March 7, 2018 |archive-date=9 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191009072722/http://www.wdsmediafile.com/media/AWrinkleInTime/writen-material/AWrinkleInTime5a989b04754db.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Rowan Blanchard]] as Veronica Kiley, a student who bullies Meg because of her vanished father but later regrets her past actions and no longer bullies her<ref name=\"wdsm_press_kit\"/>\n* [[Bellamy Young]] as Camazotz Woman,<ref name=\"wdsm_press_kit\"/> a mother from the Camazotz neighborhood \n* [[Conrad Roberts]] as Elegant Man,<ref name=\"wdsm_press_kit\"/> an elder neighbour and friend of Charles Wallace\n* [[Will McCormack]] and [[Yvette Cason]] as Two unnamed teachers,<ref name=\"wdsm_press_kit\"/> two gossipy teachers that are jealous of kids with gifts\n* [[Daniel MacPherson]] as Mr. O'Keefe,<ref name=\"wdsm_press_kit\"/> Calvin's abusive and unloving father\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn October 2010, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] retained the film rights for the 1962 novel ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]'', by [[Madeleine L'Engle]], which had previously been made as a [[A Wrinkle in Time (2003 film)|2003 television film]].
