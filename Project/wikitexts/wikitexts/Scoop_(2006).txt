It was released in the United States by [[Focus Features]] on July 28, 2006. The film follows an American journalist and a magician being guided by the spirit of a reporter to investigate a British aristocrat who might be a serial killer. ''Scoop'' received mixed reviews from critics regarding its humor, but was a box-office success, grossing $39.2 million against a $4 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing the memorial service for investigative reporter Joe Strombel, Strombel's spirit finds himself on the [[Charon (mythology)|barge of death]] with several others, including a young woman named Jane Cook who believes she was poisoned by her employer, Peter Lyman. Jane tells Strombel she thinks Lyman, a handsome British [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] with political ambitions, may be the [[Tarot]] Card Killer, a notorious [[serial killer]] of [[prostitute]]s, and that he killed her when she stumbled onto his secret. The Tarot Card Killer left a card on each murder victim's body.\n\nSondra Pransky is a beautiful but awkward American journalism student on vacation in [[London]]. Pransky attends a performance given by magician Sid Waterman, aka \"The Great Splendini\", and agrees to participate onstage. While in a booth known as The Dematerializer, Pransky encounters Strombel's ghost. The ghost has escaped the [[Grim Reaper]] himself to impart his suspicions of Lyman to a journalist who can investigate the story.{{#tag:ref|The scene was influenced by one from [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'', in which a stage musician about to be exposed as a fraud performs actual magic.|group=N}} Sondra decides to infiltrate Lyman's privileged world to find out if he truly is the dreaded criminal, enlisting Sid in the process and taking advantage of his powers of deception.\n\nSondra catches Lyman's attention by pretending to drown near him at an exclusive club's swimming pool. When he rescues her, she introduces herself as Jade Spence, daughter of a wealthy oil family from [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]]. While Sid poses as her father, \"Jade\" begins dating Lyman. Sondra is convinced Lyman is the murderer, but Sid finds it hard to believe. Sondra gradually falls in love with Lyman and begins to trust him. Sid meanwhile becomes less sanguine about Lyman as he notices more and more inconsistencies, especially after Sondra finds a [[Tarot]] deck hidden under a French horn in Peter's vault, a climate-controlled music room containing expensive antique musical instruments. Sid finally prevails upon Sondra to write a news story implicating Lyman, but the newspaper editor rejects the story because of Sondra's lack of proof. Throughout their investigation, Sid and Sondra have a relationship that is in turns friendly, paternal, and antagonistic\u2014fueled largely by Sondra's annoyance that her smooth \"Jade Spence\" charade is being compromised by Sid's obnoxious attempts to act the part of a nouveau riche oil baron.\n\nSoon the police arrest the real Tarot Card Killer. Sondra, relieved that her suspicions were for naught, reveals her real name and the deception she and Sid had practiced. Lyman is surprisingly gracious, and tells Sondra he wants to keep seeing her. They plan to spend the weekend at Lyman's isolated country estate. Later, Sid (at Strombel's urging) suggests that Lyman used the Tarot Card murders to cover up a murder he committed.\n\nWhile Sondra and Lyman vacation in the country, Sid continues to investigate this theory. He finds that Lyman did frequent a prostitute, Betty Gibson, who was later killed, apparently by the Tarot Card Killer. Gibson is described as a \"baby-faced blonde\" (just like Sondra) before Lyman convinced her to dye her hair, presumably to match the profile of the other Tarot victims. When Sid calls Sondra with his findings, she waves them off. Unbeknownst to her, Lyman is listening in on another extension.\n\nSid breaks into Lyman's vault again, this time finding a mysterious key, which turns out to be to Betty Gibson's flat. Meanwhile, in a rowboat on Lyman's lake, Lyman confesses to Sondra that he killed Gibson to stop her from blackmailing him and used the Tarot Card pattern to allay suspicion, just as Strombel had told Sid. Lyman comments on the irony that he first met Sondra by saving her from drowning, and now she really would drown. He would kill Sid later; no one would connect an obscure stage magician's death to that of a clumsy journalism student. This scene is intercut with shots of Sid driving madly to the Lyman estate to rescue Sondra, ultimately ending in a car crash.\n\nAfter his confession, Lyman throws Sondra into the lake and watches her go under. He then calls the police to report her drowning death. When they question him, he tells them Sondra was a terrible swimmer and almost drowned that first day at the pool. Suddenly, Sondra enters, soaking wet but smiling cheerfully. She informs Lyman and the police that the drowning had been an act to get his attention, and actually she was a very good swimmer.\n\nBack in the newspaper offices, the editor who previously rejected Sondra's article now congratulates Sondra on a brilliant piece of investigative journalism, the start of a promising career. Sondra seems flattered, and says she must also credit Joe Strombel and the late Sid Waterman, Splendini, who is now a passenger on the Reaper's ship, performing for his fellow spirits the same magical gags and comedy routines he did in life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Sondra Pransky\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Sid Waterman\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as Peter Lyman\n* [[Ian McShane]] as Joe Strombel\n* [[Charles Dance]] as Mr. Malcolm\n* [[Romola Garai]] as Vivian\n* [[Kevin McNally|Kevin R.

He also said:\n{{Blockquote|''Scoop'' has something ''[[Match Point]]'' didn't, something that none of Allen's films have had to quite this degree in 10 years. It's really, really funny. Not funny \"heh-heh\", but laugh-out-loud funny. Funny like you walk out wanting to tell your friends its best lines. Funny like you're walking down the street and remember a moment and start laughing like an idiot. Woody Allen has written himself an ideal role, creating a character and a situation that result in a continuous stream of winning bits.

When we see him onstage as The Great Splendini, Allen even eerily resembles Chaplin in ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'', shyly smiling out at the audience with the comedian's eternal hope of unconditional love.
