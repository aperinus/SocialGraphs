It premiered in the United States on [[Syfy|Sci Fi]], in Canada on the [[CTV Sci-Fi Channel|Space]] channel and in the United Kingdom on [[Sky One]].\n\n==Synopsis (extended version)==\n''Razor'' takes place during the first thirty days of [[Lee Adama]]'s ''Pegasus'' command during the period originally covered in the second half of season 2, after the episode \"[[The Captain's Hand]]\" but before \"[[Lay Down Your Burdens]]\", and uses flashbacks to show Rear Admiral Cain's orders during and shortly after the [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylon]] attack, as well as events occurring on the final day of the first [[Cylon War]]. Cain's actions in the wake of the holocaust are connected to the present by Kendra Shaw, self-described as Cain's legacy.\n\nEvents of the final day of the first Cylon war follow Lieutenant [[William Adama]], a Viper pilot and Helena Cain, a child. Flashbacks of Adama discovering a lab housing the early Cylon experiments on humans as well as the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)#Hybrids|first Cylon hybrid]] and Helena Cain abandoning her little sister during a Cylon invasion of Tauron finish as the first Cylon war ends. Each character is left hanging somewhat (Adama is unable to free the surviving prisoners and Cain cannot find her sister). These are shown to be driving forces for their actions as the show continues. Cain goes on to teach Shaw that you have to become a 'razor' to survive during war while referring to her pocket knife, which later becomes Kendra's and then is passed on to [[Kara Thrace]] at the end of the show. Admiral Adama teaches his son Lee a different lesson: that they cannot become butchers.\n\nLee Adama's priority as ''Pegasus'' commander is to restore trust and integrity to the troubled command, while preserving some continuity in the leadership that had evolved under Rear Admiral Cain. He picks Kendra Shaw as his [[executive officer]], promoting her to major, despite the stark contrast between Cain's enthusiastic praise and subsequent ''Pegasus'' officers' complaints about Kendra's performance. First boarding ''Pegasus'' less than an hour before the Cylon attack on the colonies, Shaw follows Rear Admiral Cain's order to make a \"blind jump\" that saves the ship from destruction at Scorpion Fleet Shipyards.\n\nLike Gaius Baltar on ''Galactica'', Kendra discovers that the Cylons were about to infect the ''Pegasus'' with a computer software virus which would have disarmed ''Pegasus'' and left it helpless. After ''Pegasus'' receives reconnaissance information that all the colonies have been destroyed, Cain delivers a rallying speech inciting the crew to war for the purpose of revenge. The crew responds by chanting \"So say we all!\" throughout the ship; the Number Six Cylon agent [[Gina Inviere]] awkwardly joins in.\n\nLee Adama's first mission as commander of ''Pegasus'' is a mission to retrieve a lost science team. Antiquated [[Cylon Raider]]s from the first war appear and attack ''Pegasus''. Simmering bitterness between Kara and Shaw is exacerbated when Shaw endangers Kara and her wingman to defend the battlestar. Both pilots land safely, though Kara has to destroy a Raider that follows her into ''Pegasus''.\n\nDuring a heated exchange, Shaw reminds Kara that defying authority is a risky proposition aboard ''Pegasus'', recalling how Cain shot her executive officer, Colonel Jurgen Belzen, for refusing an order to attack a Cylon staging area filled with an unexpectedly strong force of Raiders. It is during this mission that Gina Invierre helps Cylon centurions board the ''Pegasus'' and Shaw discovers Gina's true identity. It is hinted that the torture inflicted on Gina at Cain's orders had been influenced by the burgeoning romantic relationship between the Cylon and Cain. When Shaw is promoted to captain by Admiral Cain, she reminds her troubled prot\u00e9g\u00e9 the Cylon tricked them all.\n\nViewing the wreckage of the raider, [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon Valerii]] notes that Cylon lore tells of a group of original [[Cylon (reimagining)#Centurions|centurions]] left to guard the first Cylon hybrid. This group, referred to as 'The Guardians', has been missing since the First Cylon War. Admiral Adama then recalls his rookie mission as a Viper pilot, when he encountered that hybrid and saw what the Cylons did to their human captives for their research. Admiral Adama concludes that the Cylons must still be pursuing the experiments, with the captured science team as new test subjects.\n\nLee Adama approves a plan to use ''Pegasus'' to find the basestar and lure the Cylon Raiders away from it, then launch a rescue team\u2014including Kara Thrace and Kendra Shaw\u2014outfitted with a nuclear warhead, in a Raptor. Admiral William Adama transfers his flag to ''Pegasus'' to counsel his son on his first command. The diversion succeeds; the rescue team sacrifices its Raptor and boards the basestar.\n\nAs the rescue team searches the basestar, the Cylon hybrid can be heard speaking in more coherent phrases than its more-modern counterparts. It repeatedly utters the words \"All this has happened before and will happen again\". The hybrid also makes a far more elaborate pronouncement,\n\n{{Blockquote|At last, they have come for me. I feel their lives, their destinies spilling out before me. The denial of the one true path, played out on a world not their own, will end soon enough. Soon there will be four, glorious in awakening, struggling with the knowledge of their true selves. The pain of revelation bringing new clarity. And in the midst of confusion, he will find her. Enemies brought together by impossible longing. Enemies now joined as one. The way forward at once unthinkable, yet inevitable. And the fifth, still in shadow, will claw toward the light, hungering for redemption that will only come in the howl of terrible suffering. I can see them all. The seven, now six, self-described machines who believe themselves without sin. But in time, it is sin that will consume them. They will know enmity, bitterness, the wrenching agony of one splintering into many. And then, they will join the promised land, gathered on the wings of an angel. Not an end, but a beginning.}}\n\nThe science team is found and partly rescued, but the team comes under fire from Cylon centurions. While the team manages to evacuate the basestar in a second Raptor, the nuclear warhead is damaged and has to be detonated manually. Wounded, Shaw remains behind to detonate the warhead and comes face to face with the Cylon hybrid. The hybrid offers absolution to Kendra, who is haunted by the fact that it was she who fired the first shot in the massacre aboard the civilian ship called ''Scylla'' as part of an operation to conscript civilians for the ''Pegasus''. The hybrid then tells her that \"Kara Thrace will lead the human race to its end. She is the herald of the apocalypse, the harbinger of death. They must not follow her\". Shaw tries to relay this information to Lee Adama but is stopped when the Cylons jam communications. Her final act is to detonate the nuclear warhead, destroying the basestar.\n\nOn ''[[Battlestar Galactica (fictional spacecraft)|Galactica]]'', Admiral Adama reflects on Cain's legacy and proposes a posthumous commendation for Kendra Shaw, over his son's protests that she and other members of Admiral Cain's crew \"butchered innocent civilians\". They close their arguments noting that history's first draft will be written in their logs and Lee agrees to consider the commendation.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- organized this way since the DVD cover more closely reflects the prominence given certain characters in the plot-->\nThe following are listed in order of their prominence on the DVD front cover:\n* [[Michelle Forbes]] \u2013 Admiral Helena Cain\n* [[Stephanie Chaves-Jacobsen|Stephanie Jacobsen]] \u2013 Major [[List of Battlestar Galactica characters#Battlestar Pegasus military personnel|Kendra Shaw]]\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] \u2013 President [[Laura Roslin]]\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] \u2013 Admiral [[William Adama]]\n* [[Katee Sackhoff]] \u2013 [[Kara Thrace|Captain Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace]]\n* [[Jamie Bamber]] \u2013 [[Lee Adama|Commander Lee \"Apollo\" Adama]]\n* [[James Callis]] \u2013 Dr. [[Gaius Baltar]]\n* [[Tricia Helfer]] \u2013 [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six / Gina Inviere]]\n* [[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]] \u2013 [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Eight / Sharon Valerii]]\n* [[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]] \u2013 Colonel [[Saul Tigh]]\n* [[Fulvio Cecere]] \u2013 Lieutenant Alastair Thorne\n* Nico Cortez \u2013 Young William Adama, callsign \"Husker\"\n* [[Steve Bacic]] \u2013 Colonel Jurgen Belzen\n* [[Graham Beckel]] \u2013 Colonel Jack Fisk\n* [[Campbell Lane]] \u2013 [[Cylon Basestar|Hybrid]]\n\n==Production==\n''Razor'' was conceived and partially financed by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]], a subsidiary of [[NBCUniversal]]. The conglomerate's home video division approached [[Ronald D. Moore]], the show's developer and executive producer, wanting a stand-alone product that could be sold in [[DVD-Video]] format only days after its Sci Fi broadcast.<ref name=\"nyt1107\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/21/arts/television/21batt.html |title='Battlestar' Goes Boldly Into the DVD Universe| work=The New York Times| date=2007-11-21| access-date=2008-09-12 | first=Jonathan D. | last=Glater}}</ref><ref name=\"salon\">[http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2007/03/24/battlestar/index2.html The man behind \"Battlestar Galactica\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414033820/http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2007/03/24/battlestar/index2.html |date=April 14, 2008 }}, a March 2007 [[Salon.com]] article</ref> Moore called the proposal \"an interesting opportunity\" made even more attractive by the division's offer to subsidize part of its production costs.<ref name=\"nyt1107\"/> Moore was also happy to meet their other requirement, which was to produce 10 to 15 minutes' worth of scenes that would not be part of the broadcast version; he noted on the DVD [[audio commentary]] track that such a requirement was not a problem, since the [[rough cut]] of most of the show's episodes are always too long.<ref name=\"dvdmoore\">Moore, from his [[audio commentary]] to the \"Unrated Extended Edition\" of the DVD</ref> He also noted that the division gave the crew the option of including scenes of violence or sex that would normally not meet Sci Fi's broadcast standards, but in the end Moore chose not to go that route, even cutting a torture scene that was part of the script during [[principal photography]].<ref name=\"dvdmoore\"/><ref>The torture scene taped for ''Razor'' but cut before broadcast didn't even make the DVD's \"deleted scenes\" extras.</ref> Because of how the show's third season had ended, Moore decided \"there was no way there could be a home video release that could stand alone and also work in the continuity of the show. It had to be something that took place before the [[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|season 3 cliffhanger]].\"<ref name=\"nyt1107\"/>\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary, Moore and his editors undertook a significant re-ordering and editing of the rough cut that was based on the script as used during principal photography. The narrative was made more linear, a change that screenwriter [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] was disappointed about, though he admitted (later in the commentary) that at least one person close to him but not the show\u2014someone who saw both the scripted version and Moore's final version\u2014found it easier to follow. Both Moore and Taylor noted that the end-result occasionally suffers from what they called the [[phantom limb]]-like effects that are inevitable when a last-minute re-structuring is done, referring to subtle changes in tone and performance that hint at scenes no longer included or included in a different order. In some cases they were able to compensate with [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR]].<ref name=\"dvdboth\">Comments from Ronald D. Moore and Michael Taylor, from their DVD audio commentary track</ref>\n\nSci Fi Channel confirmed on March 21, 2007, that part of the show's renewal for a fourth season of 22 episodes included a television film to be released sometime in the fall of 2007. The film comprises the first two of 22 episodes.\n\nWhile ''Razor'' is set in the past (in relation to the conclusion of season three), Moore has stated that \"the events set up in that story will then pay off in season 4.\"<ref name=\"salon\"/> He explained his rationale for involving the ''Pegasus'', saying that \"one of the story lines everyone had really liked was the ''Pegasus'' story and the character of Admiral Cain, so we decided to go with that.\"\n\nIn the weeks prior to the movie's premiere on the Sci-Fi Channel, a series of mini \"webisodes\" (each less than five minutes in length) called [[Battlestar Galactica: Razor Flashbacks|''Razor Flashbacks'']] were screened online to promote it. These featured a young William Adama (played by Nico Cortez) as a Viper pilot on his first mission at the end of the first Cylon War over 40 years earlier. The inclusion of the first Cylon War was a relevant plot point within the ''Razor'' TV movie and viewers got to see Cylon Centurions, Raiders and Basestars similar to those in the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original series]]. Further references to the original series included a golden Centurion commander, and another Cylon saying, \"By your command.\" However, while the Cylon Centurions seen here are similar in design to the original series Cylons (the original actor who provided their voices in the original series returned as well),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trekbbs.com/showpost.php?p=2766208&postcount=24 |title=View Single Post - Nods to TOS |publisher=The Trek BBS |date=2009-03-28 |access-date=2011-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717095826/http://www.trekbbs.com/showpost.php?p=2766208&postcount=24 |archive-date=17 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> they were [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] rather than actors in suits.\n\n==DVD release==\nUniversal Studios requested that the producers of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' TV series make a one-off stand-alone TV movie that could be released on DVD almost immediately after its initial broadcast on television.<ref name=\"nyt1107\"/><ref name=\"dvdboth\"/> Staff writer Michael Taylor pitched Moore an idea about the backstory of the Battlestar ''Pegasus'' which would work as a stand-alone production but also set up events for the forthcoming final season of the series scheduled for Spring 2008.<ref name=\"dvdboth\"/>\n\n''Razor'' was released on Region 1 DVD on December 4, 2007, ten days after airing on the Sci-Fi Channel,<ref name=\"scifi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/razor/ |title=Archive snapshots of the official ''Razor'' website |access-date=2007-09-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831180829/http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/razor/ |archive-date=2007-08-31 }}</ref> and the Region 2 DVD was released on December 26, 2007 (three weeks after airing on Sky One).<ref name=\"Amazon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000WISSOK |title=Battlestar Galactica: Razor DVD |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]]}}</ref> The DVD releases feature an extended cut of the movie and include extras such as the seven \"webisodes\" that were created to be screened online in the weeks prior to the movie's broadcast.
