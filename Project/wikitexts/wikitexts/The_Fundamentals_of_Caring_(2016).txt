He takes a six-week course to become a registered [[caregiver]] and is hired by Elsa, a bank office manager from England, to care for her 18-year-old son Trevor, who has [[Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy]].\n\nBen adjusts to Trevor\u2019s routine and bonds with the sardonic, sexually frustrated teenager. Trevor reveals that his father left when he was diagnosed at age 3, and sends Trevor letters which he ignores. Elsa and Trevor know Ben is coping with the death of his young son. Elsa warns Ben not to become too close to Trevor, fearing Trevor will be hurt when Ben inevitably moves on.\n\nTrevor is fascinated with American roadside attractions, and Ben convinces Elsa to let them take a road trip. He and Trevor embark on a journey to see the world's deepest pit. Additionally, Trevor asks to visit his father, who owns a car dealership in [[Salt Lake City]]. At a gas station, Trevor develops a crush on a hitchhiker his age named Dot. When he and Ben see her again outside a diner, Ben invites her to join them on the road. Dot explains that she is heading to [[Denver]] to restart her life. Stopping at a motel, Ben suspects they are being followed by someone sent by his wife.\n\nTraveling down the highway, they find a pregnant woman, Peaches, whose car has broken down and they offer her a ride. When they stop for the night, Trevor asks Dot on a date to the diner across the street, and she accepts. The next day, the four confront Trevor's father at his dealership. He admits although Elsa asked him to write to Trevor, he never did. Elsa wrote all the letters herself. Uninterested in connecting with his son, Trevor\u2019s father offers him money instead, but Trevor and his companions leave. Lashing out at each other, Trevor and Ben prepare to drive home, but Dot insists they complete their journey.\n\nArriving at the [[Bingham Canyon Mine|world\u2019s deepest pit]], Trevor, Dot, and Peaches head to the bottom, while Ben waits at the top, saying he forgot his mobile. He confronts the driver who has been following them and discovers he is Dot's father, who wants to make sure she safely reaches Denver. Suddenly, Ben receives a frantic call from Dot, and he races to the bottom of the pit, fearing something has happened to Trevor. He discovers Peaches has gone into labor. He helps her deliver her baby, overcoming his guilt of his son's death, when his car, with the parking brake accidentally not fully engaged, ran over his son while Ben was unloading groceries.\n\nPeaches and her newborn son are taken to the hospital. Dot reconciles with her father, who agrees to take her the rest of the way to Denver. She kisses Trevor before she leaves, promising to keep in touch. With a borrowed [[spinal board]], Ben helps Trevor fulfill his wish of urinating standing up, over the rail, into the pit. Ben and Trevor return home, and Ben finalizes his divorce. He begins writing his next novel about Trevor, indicating he has remained close friends with him.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as  Ben Benjamin\n* [[Craig Roberts]] as Trevor\n* [[Selena Gomez]] as Dot\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Elsa\n* [[Megan Ferguson]] as Peaches\n* [[Fred Weller|Frederick Weller]] as Bob\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Cash\n* Julia Denton as Janet\n\n== Production ==\nOn October 11, 2012, [[Worldwide Pants]]' [[Rob Burnett (producer)|Rob Burnett]] and [[Jon Beckerman]] acquired the film rights to [[Jonathan Evison]]'s novel ''[[The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving]]''.<ref name=WorldwidePants>{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Tatiana|title=Worldwide Pants Nabs Big-Screen Rights to Jonathan Evison's Novel 'The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/worldwide-pants-nabs-big-screen-378278|accessdate=February 14, 2015|publisher=hollywoodreporter.com|date=October 11, 2012}}</ref> Burnett adapted and directed the film,<ref name=\"WorldwidePants\" /> and [[Donna Gigliotti]] and James Spies produced.
