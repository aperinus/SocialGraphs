Under the leadership of the inexperienced [[Second Lieutenant]] Armitage, his platoon is deployed without protective gear to a volatile area where [[Irish Catholics]] (largely [[Irish republicanism|Republicans]]) and [[Ulster Protestants]] (largely [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalists]]) live side by side. The unit provides support for the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] as it inspects homes for firearms, shocking Hook with their rough treatment of Catholic civilians. A crowd gathers to protest the search; the soldiers, who were ordered to leave riot gear behind, are ordered to keep the crowd back, however the latter turn violent when the RUC start beating homeowners in the street.\n\nOne soldier is hit by a rock and drops his [[L1A1 rifle]] to the ground. In the confusion, a young boy seizes it and runs off through the mob. Hook and another soldier, Thompson, pursue him. As the crowd's protest escalates, the soldiers and police pull out, leaving the two soldiers behind. Hook and Thompson are severely beaten and disarmed by a mob, until a sympathetic woman manages to calm things down. However, Thompson is suddenly shot dead at point-blank range by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] gunman Paul Haggerty. Hook flees through streets and back alleys and hides in an outhouse until dark.\n\nAfter Hook leaves, he wanders into the [[Shankill Road|Shankill]] Estate. A foul-mouthed Protestant youngster takes Hook to a local pub that serves as a front for Loyalists. There, Hook glimpses a Loyalist group in a back room constructing a bomb under the guidance of Sergeant Lewis, a member of the [[Military Reaction Force]] (MRF), the British Army's covert [[counter-insurgency]] unit. Hook steps outside the pub just before an enormous explosion destroys the building, killing or injuring many of those inside, including the young boy who brought him there. Unaware that the Loyalist bombers have blown themselves up accidentally, the Provisional IRA and [[Official Irish Republican Army|Official IRA]] factions accuse each other of being responsible for the bombing.\n\nTwo Catholics, Eamon and his daughter Brigid, discover Hook as he lies in a street unconscious and injured by shrapnel. They take him to their home in the [[Divis Tower|Divis Flats]]. Eamon, a former army medic, stitches Hook's wounds.\n\nDespite the Provisional IRA having recently taken control of the area from the OIRA, Eamon contacts senior OIRA officer Boyle for help, expecting a more humane solution than the Provisional IRA faction would allow. Boyle, less radical and violent than the younger Provisional IRA members, tells [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Browning, leader of the local MRF section, of Hook's whereabouts and asks in return that Browning kill James Quinn, a key leader of the younger Provisional IRA faction.\n\nQuinn and his squad have tailed Boyle since the pub explosion and saw him visit Eamon's flat without knowing why he was there. Sensing danger, Hook flees the flat, taking a large knife he finds in a bag. Hook eludes Quinn's men but, unable to evade Haggerty, stabs and kills him.\n\nQuinn's group captures Hook and takes him to a hideout. Quinn orders Sean, the young boy who in the early neighborhood persecution had hesitated to kill Hook, to murder him. When Sean hesitates, Quinn prepares to execute Hook, only to leave when Browning's group arrives. Sergeant Lewis of Browning's group shoots Sean, to Hook's horror. Lewis then attempts to strangle Hook to prevent him from informing others about the bomb.\n\nAs Lieutenant Armitage and his men enter in support of Browning, Armitage sees Lewis' attempt to kill Hook. Sean, having survived the first shot, raises himself and shoots Lewis dead, before being shot again, this time by Armitage, finally killing him. Browning finds Quinn, and rather than arresting or executing him, tells him Boyle wants him dead and needs to be dealt with. As Quinn leaves, Browning tells him he will be in touch soon.\n\nHook is returned to his barracks. Later, despite a formal complaint by Armitage, the [[commanding officer]] dismisses the incident involving Hook, Lewis, and Sean as 'a confused situation' that merits no further inquiry. Hook returns to England, throwing his dog tags from the ferry, and reunites with his younger brother.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]] as Gary Hook\n* [[Richard Dormer]] as Eamon\n* [[Charlie Murphy (actress)|Charlie Murphy]] as Brigid\n* [[David Wilmot (actor)|David Wilmot]] as Boyle\n* [[Sean Harris]] as Captain Sandy Browning\n* [[Killian Scott]] as James Quinn\n* [[Sam Reid (actor)|Sam Reid]] as Second Lieutenant Armitage \n* [[Barry Keoghan]] as Sean\n* [[Paul Anderson (actor)|Paul Anderson]] as Sergeant Leslie Lewis\n* [[Jack Lowden]] as Thompson (\"Thommo\")\n* [[Adam Nagaitis]] as Jimmy\n* [[Martin McCann (actor)|Martin McCann]] as Paul Haggerty\n* [[Babou Ceesay]] as Corporal\n* Corey McKinley as Loyalist child\n* [[Paul Popplewell]] as Training Corporal\n* [[Amy Molloy]] as Mother in Raided House\n* [[Valene Kane]] as Orla Spitting Girl\n* Harry Verity as Darren\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 96% of 138 surveyed critics have given the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.80/10.
