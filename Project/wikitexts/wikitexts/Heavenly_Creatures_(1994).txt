Based on the notorious 1954 [[Parker\u2013Hulme murder case]] in [[Christchurch]], the film focuses on the relationship between two teenage girls\u2014Pauline Parker and [[Anne Perry|Juliet Hulme]]\u2014which culminates in the murder of Parker's mother. The events of the film span the period from their meeting in 1952 to the murder in 1954.\n\nThe film opened in 1994 at the [[51st Venice International Film Festival]], where it won the [[Silver Lion]], and became one of the best-received films of the year. Reviewers praised most aspects of the production, with particular attention given to the performances by the previously unknown Winslet and Lynskey, as well as for Jackson's directing. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1952 [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, the more affluent English 13-year-old girl [[Juliet Hulme]] befriends a 14-year-old girl from a working-class family, Pauline Parker, when Juliet transfers to Pauline's school. They bond over a shared history of severe childhood disease and isolating hospitalizations, and over time develop an intense friendship. Pauline admires Juliet's outspoken arrogance and beauty.\n\nTogether they paint, write stories, make plasticine figurines, and eventually create a fantasy kingdom called Borovnia. It is the setting of the adventure novels they write together, which they hope to have published and eventually made into films in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. Over time it begins to be as real to them as the real world.\n\nPauline's relationship with her mother Honora becomes increasingly hostile and the two fight constantly. This angry atmosphere is in contrast to the peaceful intellectual life Juliet shares with her family. Pauline spends most of her time at the Hulmes', where she feels accepted. Juliet introduces Pauline to the idea of \"the Fourth World\", a Heaven without Christians where music and art are celebrated. Juliet believes she will go there when she dies. Certain actors and musicians have the status of [[saint]]s in this afterlife, such as singer [[Mario Lanza]], with whom both girls are obsessed.\n\nDuring a day trip to [[Port Levy]], Juliet's parents announce that they are going away and plan to leave Juliet behind. Her fear of being left alone makes her hysterical, culminating in her first direct experience of the Fourth World, perceiving it as a land where all is beautiful and she is safe. She asks Pauline to come with her, and the world that Juliet sees becomes visible to Pauline, too. This is presented as a shared spiritual vision, a confirmation of their \"Fourth World\" belief, that influences the girls' predominant reality and affects their perception of events in the everyday world.\n\nJuliet is diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and is sent to a clinic. Pauline is desolate without her, and the two begin an intense correspondence, writing not only as themselves, but in the roles of the royal couple of Borovnia. During this time Pauline begins a sexual relationship with a lodger, which makes Juliet jealous. For both of them, their fantasy life becomes a useful escape when under stress in the real world, and the two engage in increasingly violent, even murderous, fantasies about people who oppress them. After four months, Juliet is released from the clinic and their relationship intensifies. Juliet's father blames the intensity of the relationship on Pauline and speaks to her parents, who take her to a doctor. The doctor suspects that Pauline is [[homosexual]], and considers this a cause of her increasing anger at her mother as well as her dramatic weight loss.\n\nJuliet catches her mother having an affair with one of her psychiatric clients and threatens to tell her father, but her mother tells her he knows. Shortly afterward, the two announce their intention to divorce, upsetting Juliet. Soon it is decided that the family will leave Christchurch, with Juliet to be left with a relative in South Africa. She becomes increasingly hysterical at the thought of leaving Pauline, and the two girls plan to run away together. When that plan becomes impossible, the two share a bathtub and talk about murdering Pauline's mother as they see her as the primary obstacle to their being together.\n\nAs the date of Juliet's departure nears, it is decided that the two girls should spend the last three weeks together at Juliet's house. At the end of that time, Pauline returns home and the two finalize plans for the murder. Honora plans a trip for the three of them to [[Victoria Park, Christchurch|Victoria Park]], and the girls decide this will be the day. Juliet conceals a broken piece of brick in her bag and Pauline places it into an old stocking before departing on the trip. After having tea, the three walk on a path down a steep hillside. When Honora bends over to pick up a pink charm the girls have deliberately dropped, Juliet and Pauline bludgeon her to death with the brick.\n\nA post-script states that Pauline and Juliet were arrested shortly after the murder; that, as the girls were too young to face the death penalty, both were sentenced to serve five years in prison; that they were released separately in 1959; and that it was a condition that they never see one another again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as [[Anne Perry|Juliet Hulme]]\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as [[Parker\u2013Hulme murder case|Pauline Parker]]\n* [[Sarah Peirse]] as Honora Parker\n* [[Diana Kent]] as Hilda Hulme\n* [[Clive Merrison]] as [[Henry Rainsford Hulme|Dr. Henry Hulme]]\n* Simon O'Connor as Herbert Rieper\n* [[Jed Brophy]] as John\n* [[Peter Elliott (actor)|Peter Elliott]] as Bill Perry\n* Gilbert Goldie as Dr. Bennett\n* [[Elizabeth Moody (actor)|Elizabeth Moody]] as Miss Waller\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Fran Walsh]] suggested to [[Peter Jackson]] (who was noted for horror-comedy films) that they write a film about the notorious Parker-Hulme murder. Jackson took the idea to his long-time collaborator, producer Jim Booth (who died after filming). The three filmmakers decided that the film should tell the story of the friendship between the two girls rather than focus on the murder and trial. \"The friendship was for the most part a rich and rewarding one, and we tried to honour that in the film. It was our intention to make a film about a friendship that went terribly wrong,\" said Peter Jackson.<ref name=\"hcfaq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heavenlycreaturesmovie.com|title=Fourth World - The Heavenly Creatures Website|website=Heavenlycreaturesmovie.com|access-date=24 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nWalsh had been interested in the case since her early childhood. \"I first came across it in the late sixties when I was ten years old.<ref name=\"hcfaq\"/> ''The Sunday Times'' devoted two whole pages to the story with an accompanying illustration of the two girls. I was struck by the description of the dark and mysterious friendship that existed between them\u2014by the uniqueness of the world the two girls had created for themselves.\"\n\nJackson and Walsh researched the story by reading contemporary newspaper accounts of the trial. They decided that the sensational aspects of the case that so titillated newspaper readers in 1954 were far removed from the story that Jackson and Walsh wished to tell. \"In the 1950s, Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme were branded as possibly the most evil people on earth. What they had done seemed without rational explanation, and people could only assume that there was something terribly wrong with their minds,\" states Jackson. To bring a more humane version of events to the screen, the filmmakers undertook a nationwide search for people who had close involvement with Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme forty years earlier. This included tracing and interviewing seventeen of their former classmates and teachers from [[Christchurch Girls' High School]]. In addition, Jackson and Walsh spoke with neighbours, family friends, colleagues, policemen, lawyers and [[psychologist]]s. Jackson and Walsh also read Pauline's diary, in which she made daily entries documenting her friendship with Juliet Hulme and events throughout their relationship. From the diary entries, it became apparent that Pauline and Juliet were intelligent, imaginative, outcast young women who possessed a wicked and somewhat irreverent sense of humor. In the film, all of Pauline's voice-overs are excerpts from her journal entries.\n\n===Casting===\nThe role of Pauline was cast after Walsh scouted schools all over New Zealand to find a Pauline 'look-alike'. She had trouble finding an actress who resembled Pauline and had acting talent before discovering Melanie Lynskey. [[Kate Winslet]] was among 175 girls to audition for the film, and was cast after impressing Jackson with the intensity she brought to her part.<ref name=\"Sibley2006\">{{cite book |last = Sibley |first = Brian |title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ljcdAQAAIAAJ |year = 2006 |publisher = HarperCollins Entertainment |isbn = 978-0-00-717558-1 |page = 243 |url-status=live}}</ref> The girls were both so absorbed by their roles that they kept on acting as Pauline and Juliet after the filming was done, as is described on Jackson's website.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Principal photography===\nThe entire film was shot on location in [[Christchurch]] in the [[South Island|South Island of New Zealand]] in 1993.
