Repeatedly bumping into each other on campus, John confides in Maggie that he is writing a novel. Maggie begins reading it, and they start meeting on a regular basis to talk about the novel.\n\nMaggie attempts to inseminate herself, but is interrupted by the doorbell. It is John, who confesses that he is in love with her and wants to be the father of her child.\n\nThree years later, Maggie and John are married, and they have a daughter, Lily. Maggie repeatedly finds herself having to put her professional goals on the back burner to take care of Lily and her two step-children, and to support John's writing. Taking Lily for a walk, she runs into Guy, who initially thinks Lily is his daughter, but Maggie tells him that Lily is John's child.\n\nMaggie goes to see Georgette, John's ex-wife, at a book signing. She approaches Georgette and tells her that she knows Georgette is still in love with John, and that she wants to help them get back together. Georgette decides to go along with the plan, and asks for Maggie's help getting John to attend a conference which she will also be attending. At the conference, Georgette and John make up and sleep together. Returning home, John confesses everything to Maggie, who tells him he belongs with Georgette.\n\nJohn accidentally learns that Maggie had planned to re-unite him with Georgette. He leaves Maggie and Lily, and disappears for a while. Maggie goes to speak to Georgette, in order to try to find out any news about John, and ends up taking Georgette and the children to her home, where Georgette spends the day reading John's novel. Meeting with him later, she tells him her opinion about the novel. Realizing that she knows him better than he knows himself, John forgives Georgette for her part in the scheme, and they re-unite.\n\nSometime later, the blended family goes out ice-skating. Maggie is surprised when Lily begins to recite numbers, as neither she nor John are mathematically inclined. She sees Guy walking towards the ice rink.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Maggie Hardin\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as John Harding\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Georgette
