Peck's  Brentwood Production also co-produced the film.<ref>p.239 Fishgall, Gary ''Gregory Peck: A Biography'' Simon and Schuster, 2002</ref>\n\nThe film is based on the 1961 novel by [[Leo Rosten]]. It was loosely based on the World War II experiences of Rosten's close friend [[Ralph Greenson]], M.D., while Greenson was a captain in the [[Army Medical Corps]] supporting the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] and stationed at [[MCAS Yuma|Yuma Army Airfield]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]]. Greenson is well known for his work on \"empathy\" and was one of the first in his field to seriously associate [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (years before that terminology was developed) with wartime experiences. He was a director of the Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Institute and was a practicing [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]]. Greenson is perhaps best known for his patients, who included [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Vivien Leigh]].\n\nMajor filming took place at the U.S. Army's [[Fort Huachuca]] complex in [[southern Arizona]], with the co-located [[Libby Army Airfield]] used to portray the fictional Colfax Army Air Field.\n\nThe story was used as a 1972 [[television pilot]] of the same title produced by Danny Thomas Productions starring [[Jim Hutton]] in the title role and [[Joan Van Ark]] as Lt Corum.<ref>p.650 Terrace, Vincent ''Encyclopedia of Television Pilots, 1937\u20132012'' McFarland, 26 Feb. 2013</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1944, Captain Josiah Newman is head of the neuro-psychiatric Ward 7 at the Colfax Army Air Field (AAF) military hospital, located in the Arizona desert. As he explains to a visiting [[VIP]] who wanders in: \"We're short of beds, doctors, orderlies, nurses, everything ... except patients.\" He will use unconventional tactics to treat his patients and to recruit much needed personnel, as when he hijacks a new and very reluctant [[orderly]], Corporal Jackson Leibowitz, a wheeler-dealer from New Jersey. Leibowitz promptly has the entire ward participating in a sing-along of \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm.\"\n\nNewman also takes great pains to court nurse Lieutenant Francie Corum on what she thinks is a date... until he asks her to transfer to Ward 7. Their 'date/fight' is cut short by a phone call: Colonel Bliss has forced his way into Ward 7 looking for Dr. Newman with a 6-inch knife, because Newman blocked his return to active duty after witnessing Bliss' erratic behavior. After watching Newman's handling of this situation and other patients on the ward, Corum transfers in.\n\nNewman treats [[PTSD|shell-shocked]], [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] and [[catatonia|catatonic]] patients, facing an especial challenge from the traumatized Corporal Jim Tompkins, an Eighth Air Force air gunner whose mind has been shattered by his war experiences. Newman is bedeviled by Colfax AAF's \"old-school\" base commander, Colonel Pyser, who ultimately saddles him with a complement of injured Italian POWs because his is the only secure ward in the hospital. In addition, a flock of constantly straying sheep (kept for the medical lab) that find their way to the airfield and a set of feuding orderlies keeps life interesting right up to Christmas 1944.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Capt.
