The film is based on the lives and crimes of the British gangster twins Ronald and Reginald Kray, often referred to as [[Kray twins|The Krays]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE0D61739F93AA35752C1A966958260|title=The Krays (1990) Review/Film; Twin Thugs With a Mother Complex|authorlink=Janet Maslin|first=Janet|last=Maslin|date=9 November 1990}}</ref> The film stars [[Billie Whitelaw]], [[Tom Bell (actor)|Tom Bell]], and real life brothers [[Gary Kemp|Gary]] and [[Martin Kemp]], both of whom were members of the band [[Spandau Ballet]].<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film charts the lives of the [[Kray twins]] from childhood to adult life. The plot focuses on the relationship between the twins and their doting mother (Whitelaw). Ronald (Gary Kemp) is the dominant one, influencing his brother Reginald (Martin Kemp) to perform several acts of violence as they rise to power as the leaders of a powerful organised gang in 1960s London.\nThe movie focuses more on the personal life of the brothers, including Reg's marriage and then alienation from his wife, culminating in her suicide. The movie omits the police investigation going against the Krays and ends with a jump-cut to them attending their mother's funeral in 1982, already serving time in prison by then.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Billie Whitelaw]] as Violet Kray\n* [[Tom Bell (actor)|Tom Bell]] as [[Jack McVitie]]\n* [[Gary Kemp]] as [[Kray twins|Ronnie Kray]]\n* [[Martin Kemp]] as [[Kray twins|Reggie Kray]]\n* [[Susan Fleetwood]] as Rose\n* [[Charlotte Cornwell]] as May\n* [[Kate Hardie]] as Frances\n* [[Avis Bunnage]] as Helen\n* [[Alfred Lynch]] as Charlie Kray Sr.\n* [[Gary Love]] as Steve\n* [[Steven Berkoff]] as [[George Cornell]]\n* [[Jimmy Jewel]] as Cannonball Lee\n* [[Barbara Ferris]] as Mrs. Lawson\n* [[Victor Spinetti]] as Mr. Lawson\n* [[John McEnery]] as Eddie Pellam\n* [[Norman Rossington]] as Shopkeeper\n* [[Michael Balfour (actor)|Michael Balfour]] as Referee\n* [[Jimmy Flint]] as Perry \n* [[Ian Burfield]] as Whip\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as Newsagent\n* [[Sadie Frost]] as Sharon Pellam\n* [[Stephen Lewis (actor)|Stephen Lewis]] as Policeman\n* [[Angus MacInnes]] as Palendri\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''The Krays'' holds a rating of 82% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 17 reviews.\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at the [[List of 1990 box office number-one films in the United Kingdom|top of the UK box office]] with a gross of \u00a31,036,117 for the week.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=U.K. Top 10 Films |page=40|date=9 May 1990}}</ref> It remained at number one for a second week<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Good weather bad for biz; Scandi, Paris fall sharply|page=34|date=16 May 1990|last=Pitman|first=Jack}}</ref> and went on to gross \u00a33,707,649 ($7 million) at the UK box office.<ref name=\"org\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-back-to-the-future-the-fall-and-rise-of-the-british-film-industry-in-the-1980s.pdf|page=25|title=Back to the Future: The Fall and Rise of the British Film Industry in the 1980s \u2013 An Information Briefing|publisher=British Film Institute|date=2005}}</ref> In the United States and Canada, it grossed $2,060,847.<ref>{{Mojo title|krays}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n*'''Nominee''' Best Supporting Actress \u2013 [[BAFTA]] ([[Billie Whitelaw]])\n*'''Winner''' Best Film \u2013 [[Evening Standard British Film Awards]] ([[Peter Medak]])\n*'''Winner''' Most Promising Newcomer \u2013 [[Evening Standard British Film Awards]] ([[Philip Ridley]])\n*'''Winner''' Best Actress \u2013 International Fantasy Film Awards ([[Fantasporto]]) ([[Billie Whitelaw]])\n*'''Nominee''' Best Film \u2013 International Fantasy Film Awards ([[Fantasporto]]) ([[Peter Medak]])\n*'''Winner''' George Delerue Prize for Music \u2013 [[Ghent International Film Festival]] ([[Michael Kamen]])\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Legend (2015 film)|Legend]],'' a 2015 film with [[Tom Hardy]] playing both brothers\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0099951|The Krays}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|krays}}\n*{{Mojo title|krays}}\n\n{{Peter Medak}}\n{{Films by Philip Ridley}}\n{{The Krays}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Krays, The}}\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:1990 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s gang films]]\n[[Category:British biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:British crime drama films]]\n[[Category:British gangster films]]\n[[Category:Crime films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Hood films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Kamen]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films about murderers]]\n[[Category:Films about twin brothers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Medak]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1951]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1982]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Georges Delerue Award winners]]\n[[Category:Works about the Kray twins]]\n[[Category:Films about organised crime in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
