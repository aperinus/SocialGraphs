It tells the story of Darnell Wright ([[Martin Lawrence]]), a ladies' man who finds himself stalked by one of his obsessed lovers: Brandi ([[Lynn Whitfield]]), an attractive and successful, but unstable older businesswoman.\n\nLawrence directed the film, and co-wrote the screenplay alongside Kenny Buford, [[Bentley Kyle Evans]] and [[Kim Bass]]. Released on April 3, 1996, the film grossed over $34 million at the [[box office]] against a budget of $8 million.\n\n==Plot==\nNightclub manager Darnell Wright ([[Martin Lawrence]]) is a perpetual [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] and hopeless male [[chauvinist]]. He works for a nightclub called ''Chocolate City'' and aspires to be its owner. He trades [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]] privileges at the club for favors from women. Though he is an expert at conning women, he sometimes worries about what his childhood sweetheart Mia ([[Regina King]])  thinks of his adventures.\n\nWhen the beautiful and wealthy Brandi Webb ([[Lynn Whitfield]]) steps out of a limousine to enter the club, Darnell feels that he's met his ultimate prize. She initially rejects his come-ons, which only fuels his appetite. He pursues her, showing up with flowers at her office. He finally wins over Brandi, only to find out that he's really in love with Mia. One morning, Darnell wakes up to find Brandi in his kitchen making bacon and pancakes. She wants him to hold her, but he pushes her off aggressively. However, Brandi doesn't take kindly to rejection. She becomes an obsessed [[femme fatale]] stalking him, even taking all four wheels off his SUV to ground him from his rounds, shattering his windshield and setting his nightclub on fire. In one scene, she hits herself with a fruit hidden in a stocking to cause bruises without fingerprints, and repeatedly slams a door on her arm injuring herself. When Darnell goes to see her at the hospital, he is arrested for a false domestic violence charge. She also threatens Mia's life.\n\nEnding his relationship with Mia is not enough to satisfy Brandi who finally administers Darnell's punishment for his [[misogyny]]. Darnell quickly learns the hard way that when you \"play\", you have to \"pay.\" Darnell, now suffering from a gun wound attempts to take the gun off Brandi causing himself, Brandi and Mia to fall out of the window and land in the pool. Darnell wakes up in the hospital with all his friends and family as well as Mia standing over him, and decides to change his life for the better. Brandi ends up arrested and imprisoned.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Darnell Wright \n* [[Lynn Whitfield]] as Brandi Web\n* [[Regina King]] as Mia Williams\n* [[Bobby Brown]] as \"Tee\"\n* [[Della Reese]] as Mama Wright\n* [[Malinda Williams]] as Erica Wright\n* [[Daryl Mitchell (actor)|Daryl Mitchell]] as Earl\n* [[Roger E.
