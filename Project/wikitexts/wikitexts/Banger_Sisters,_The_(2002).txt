The film stars [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Susan Sarandon]] as two middle-aged women who used to be friends and [[groupie]]s when they were young.\n\nReleased on September 20, 2002, the film was Hawn's last acting role until the release of ''[[Snatched (2017 film)|Snatched]]'' in 2017, fourteen and a half years after the film's release.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Suzette is fired from her job as bartender at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in [[Los Angeles]], she promptly decides to travel to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] to see her old friend Vinnie. Stranded at a service station without any money to buy some gasoline, she picks up neurotic, middle-aged author Harry Plummer, who is heading to Phoenix to permanently deal with his father's negative influence over his life.\n\nOn arriving in Phoenix, Suzette has a chance encounter with Vinnie's 17-year-old daughter Hannah who, after some [[recreational drug use]], starts throwing up in Harry's hotel room. When she drives her back to her parents' elegant suburban home, Suzette initially cannot believe what she sees: Vinnie, who now calls herself Lavinia Kingsley, leads the more [[conservative]] life of the perfect wife and mother\u2014a life which at one point prompts one of her daughters to ask Suzette, \"Did she ''ever'' do ''anything'' wrong?\" Raymond, Vinnie's lawyer husband and an aspiring politician, is also unaware about his wife's past.\n\nHowever, Suzette's sudden appearance brings back all those memories for Lavinia. She cuts her hair and throws off her expensive but boring clothes and, just for one night, relives the old days by going dancing with Suzette. They return to Vinnie's home and down in the basement she retrieves some of the memorabilia of their previous life as groupies, which includes a collection of [[Instant film|Polaroids]] of the penises of numerous \"musicians and a few [[roadie]]s\". After smoking a [[Cannabis|marijuana]] joint they set off the smoke detector, waking up the household.\n\nGinger has a minor fender bender which has everyone off to the hospital. Vinnie has an identity crisis during a family argument where Hannah blames Suzette for disrupting their lives. Suzette leaves and calls Harry telling him she's going back to Los Angeles. Vinnie follows Suzette and they have a heart to heart that ends up with them sitting atop a \"[[Got Milk?]]\" billboard sign to watch the sunrise.\n\nThe pair go to the hotel room to find Harry has left. Suzette fears the worst as Harry has taken a gun with him. They find Harry going to see his father, in a cemetery. While Suzette tries to talk sense into Harry, Vinnie loses her patience and bumps into him with the car. Suzette takes the gun and shoots the single bullet into the air. Harry finally comes to grips with his deceased, absentee father.\n\nIn the end, both Lavinia's husband and her two daughters have understood that she is only human after all. In her graduation speech, Hannah speaks out against anything that is \"fake\" and urges her schoolmates, teachers and the parents present to \"do it true\".\n\nThe following day, Suzette returns to Los Angeles together with Harry, who has come to consider her his muse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Suzette\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Lavinia \"Vinnie\" Kingsley\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Harry Plummer\n* [[Erika Christensen]] as Hannah Kingsley\n* [[Robin Thomas]] as Raymond Kingsley\n* [[Eva Amurri]] as Ginger Kingsley\n* Matthew Carey as Jules\n* Andre Ware as Jake the Bartender\n* Adam Tomei as Club Owner\n* Sal Lopez as Pump Attendant\n* [[Kohl Sudduth]] as Hotel Clerk\n* [[Tinsley Grimes]] as Prom Girl\n* Larry Krask as Man in Bar\n* Marlayna Garrett as Young Groupie\n* [[Buckcherry]] as Themselves\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was released on September 20, 2002.
