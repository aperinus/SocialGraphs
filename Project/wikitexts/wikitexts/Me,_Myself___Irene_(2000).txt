[[Chris Cooper]], [[Robert Forster]], [[Richard Jenkins]], [[Daniel Greene (actor)|Daniel Greene]], [[Anthony Anderson]], [[Jerod Mixon]] and Mongo Brownlee co-star. The film is about a [[Rhode Island]] state trooper named Charlie who, after years of continuously suppressing his rage and feelings, suffers a psychotic breakdown that results in a [[Dissociative identity disorder|second personality]], Hank. This was Carrey's first role in a [[20th Century Fox]] film along with being the Farrelly brothers' second film with Carrey, since ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' was released in 1994.\n\n==Plot==\nMeek veteran [[Rhode Island State Police|Rhode Island state trooper]] Charlie Baileygates has been taken advantage of by those around him, including his wife Layla. Almost immediately after their wedding, she begins to cheat on Charlie with their wedding limo chauffeur, a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] black man named Shont\u00e9 with a genius-level IQ.\n\nDespite his friends warning him of Layla's infidelity, Charlie denies it, even after she gives birth to biracial [[triplets]], who also appear to be geniuses. A few years later, Layla leaves with Shont\u00e9, abandoning her children. Charlie raises the triplets: Jamal, Lee Harvey, and Shont\u00e9 Jr. as his own children. While the boys love and respect Charlie, the rest of the town continually abuses him. After years of such treatment, he develops a [[split personality]] named Hank Evans to deal with confrontations Charlie avoids.\n\nEmerging whenever Charlie is under extreme stress, Hank is an over-the-top, rude, and violent persona reminiscent of characters played by [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Saathof|first=Evan|title=The Split Tonal Personality Of ME, MYSELF, & IRENE A look at the Farrelly Brothers' funniest drama|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/06/30/the-split-tonal-personality-of-me-myself-irene|publisher=Birth.

Irene insists her mob-connected ex-boyfriend Dickie fabricated the accusation to keep her from revealing his illegal activities to the authorities.\n\nIn Massena, Charlie turns over Irene to two [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] agents. A [[hitman]] with a contract on Irene kills one of the agents. She and Charlie flee, hastily leaving his medication behind, causing Hank to emerge frequently. Charlie is unjustly blamed for the murder. FBI agents begin pursuing him and Irene, as do two crooked police officers on Dickie's payroll, Boshane and Gerke. The chase becomes a media spectacle, alerting Charlie's sons to his predicament.\n\nCharlie and Irene return to Rhode Island, bonding along the way. Though Irene is taken by Charlie's personality, Hank worries her, as his aggressive personality and overestimation of his own toughness often gets them into trouble. Along the way they pick up \"Whitey\", an [[albinism|albino]] waiter who claims to have killed his entire family. While stopping at a motel, Hank convinces Irene to have sex with him by impersonating Charlie. When Charlie realizes what happened the next morning, he is incensed and begins fighting with Hank. They are almost ambushed by Boshane and Gerke, but Charlie's sons, having found them, steal a police helicopter and call in a false report, stating Charlie and Irene have been apprehended in the woods nearby.\n\nCharlie and Irene leave Whitey at the motel and board a train to Rhode Island. Dickie boards the same train, having been ordered by his police allies to \"get his hands dirty\". He kidnaps Irene, and Charlie chases him, working together with Hank to save her. Hank balks when Dickie heads onto a bridge, but Charlie finally faces his fears, thus permanently nullifying Hank. As Charlie tries to disarm Dickie, Dickie shoots off his thumb. Whitey then throws a lawn dart at Dickie, hitting him from behind and killing him.\n\nCharlie and Irene fall from the bridge into the river below, where his sons arrive to rescue them. Regrouping with Whitey, Charlie apologizes for making him kill again, but Whitey reveals he made up his backstory, fearing Hank. The police arrive, quickly learning of Irene's plight. Gerke and Boshane are arrested, Charlie is praised for bringing them to justice, and Irene is cleared of the charges against her.\n\nIrene prepares to leave Rhode Island when the police pull her over, but this is only a diversion so Charlie can propose, which she happily accepts. In a post-credits scene, everyone looks for Charlie's thumb in the river. Whitey finds it, but a fish eats it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Charlie Baileygates / Hank Evans\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Irene P. Waters\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Lt.
