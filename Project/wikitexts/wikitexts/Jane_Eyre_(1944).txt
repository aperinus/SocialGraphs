Jane is ecstatic when Mrs. Reed, eager to be rid of her, arranges for Jane to be sent to Lowood Institution, a charity [[boarding school]] for young girls, run by the disciplinarian Mr. Brocklehurst.\n\nBased on what Mrs. Reed has told him, Mr. Brocklehurst labels Jane a liar in front of her schoolmates and orders her to stand on a stool for hours on her first day of attendance. She is comforted and befriended by another student, Helen Burns. Later, Jane protests when Brocklehurst orders that Helen's naturally curling hair be cut. Both are punished by being forced to walk circles in a courtyard during a downpour. Dr. Rivers, a sympathetic physician who periodically checks on the students, brings the girls inside, but it is too late for Helen, who dies that night.\n\nTen years later, in 1840, twenty-year-old Jane turns down Brocklehurst's offer of a teaching position. She advertises for and accepts a job as [[governess]] for a young girl named Ad\u00e8le. When she arrives at [[Thornfield Hall|Thornfield]], a gloomy, isolated mansion, she initially thinks her employer is Mrs. Fairfax, who is in fact the housekeeper for the absent master.\n\nJane goes for a walk one night only to startle a horse into throwing and slightly injuring its rider, Edward Rochester\u2014whom she doesn't realize is her employer. When Jane arrives back at Thornfield, she discovers this fact, and Rochester calls her into his library to interview her. His brusque manner contrasts with her quiet, gentle demeanor, and he finally dismisses her with the wish that she will enjoy her stay there.\n\nThat night, Jane is awakened by strange laughter. She investigates, and discovers that Rochester's bed curtains are on fire. She rouses the sleeping man and they extinguish the fire without rousing anyone. Rochester bids her wait while he goes to another wing of the house, where mysterious seamstress Grace Poole keeps to herself. When he returns, he tells Jane nothing other than that the matter is under control. The next morning, he leaves Thornfield.\n\nA winter and spring go by before he returns with a large group of guests. Jane is greatly saddened when Mrs. Fairfax discloses that everyone expects Rochester to marry the vivacious Blanche Ingram. However, Rochester confides to Jane his conviction that Blanche is attracted only by his wealth.\n\nWhen a man named Richard Mason of [[Spanish Town, Jamaica]], arrives at Thornfield, Jane sees that Rochester is disturbed. That night, a pained scream awakens everyone. Rochester assures his guests it is just a servant's reaction to a nightmare, but after he sends them back to their rooms, he has Jane secretly tend to a bleeding Mason in the tower while he fetches a doctor. Behind her, a locked wooden door rattles with someone trying to get out, but Rochester orders Jane to ignore everything she sees or hears. Rochester has the doctor take Mason away.\n\nRochester has a private conversation with Blanche, in which he bluntly asserts that she is a gold digger. Offended, she and the other guests leave. Unaware of this development, Jane broaches the topic of her future employment elsewhere after Rochester gets married, and confesses that she does not want to leave Rochester. In response, Rochester reveals that he loves her and not Blanche, and proposes marriage to her, which she accepts.\n\nDuring the wedding ceremony, an attorney intervenes and declares that Rochester has a wife by the name of Bertha Antonietta Mason, who is mentally ill and deranged. This is confirmed by Mason, Rochester's brother-in-law. Rochester calls off the marriage ceremony and takes Jane and Mason back to Thornfield to reveal Bertha, who is insane to the point of animalistic behavior, and lives in a tower cell guarded by Grace Poole. Rochester explains to Jane that his and Bertha's marriage was arranged when he was a teenager, and he did not truly know her. He was helpless as she drove herself mad, and has been searching for happiness with a real partner ever since, which caused him to become desperate when he fell for Jane. Though they admit they still love each other, Jane rejects Rochester's offer to stay as his mistress, and she determinedly departs Thornfield to preserve her principles.\n\nWith her funds exhausted, Jane returns to Gateshead. She discovers that her aunt has suffered a stroke, caused by worry over the ruinous gambling habits of her son, who it is revealed has committed suicide. Mrs. Reed is happy to see Jane and they reconcile. After Mrs. Reed dies, Jane ponders what to do next, when she hears Rochester's anguished voice calling her name during a storm.\n\nJane returns to Thornfield and finds it in ruins. Mrs. Fairfax informs her that Bertha had escaped confinement, set the place on fire, and fled to the roof. While Fairfax took Ad\u00e8le to safety, Rochester tried to rescue Bertha, but she jumped to her death. The burning staircase collapsed underneath Rochester, badly wounding him. With no other impediments, Jane reunites with Rochester, who is now blind from the fire. He tells her she should not waste her life with a crippled man like him, but she has made her choice to stay. They reaffirm their love and kiss passionately. Jane narrates that she married Rochester, and when their son was born, her husband's vision was sufficiently restored for him to see their child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Orson Welles]] as [[Edward Rochester]]\n* [[Joan Fontaine]] as [[Jane Eyre (character)|Jane Eyre]]\n* [[Margaret O'Brien]] as Ad\u00e8le Verans \n* [[Peggy Ann Garner]] as young Jane Eyre \n* [[John Sutton (actor)|John Sutton]] as Dr. Rivers\n* [[Sara Allgood]] as Bessie\n* [[Henry Daniell]] as Mr. Brocklehurst\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Mrs. Reed\n* [[Aubrey Mather]] as Colonel Percy Dent\n* [[Edith Barrett]] as Mrs. Fairfax\n* [[Barbara Everest]] as Lady Ingram\n* [[Hillary Brooke]] as Blanche Ingram\n* [[Ethel Griffies]] as Grace Poole\n* [[Eily Malyon]] as Mrs. Skatcher\n* [[Ivan Simpson]] as Mr. Woods\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Mr. Briggs\n* [[John Abbott (actor)|John Abbott]] as Mason\n* [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Helen Burns\n* [[Mae Marsh]] as Leah\n* [[Mary Forbes]] as Mrs. Eshton\n* Thomas Louden as Sir George Lynn\n* [[Yorke Sherwood]] as Beadle\n* Ronald Harris as John Reed\n* Charles Irwin as Auctioneer\n* [[Gwendolyn Logan]] as Dowager\n* [[Moyna Macgill]] as Dowager\n* [[Gerald Oliver Smith]] as Footman at Gateshead\n* [[Leslie Vincent]] as Guest\n* [[Billie Seward]] as Woman at party\n* [[Adele Jergens]] as Woman at party\n* Eustace Wyatt as Dr. Carter\n* [[Harry Allen (actor)|Harry Allen]] as Guard\n* [[Charles Coleman (actor)|Charles Coleman]] as Guard\n* [[Billy Bevan]] as Bookie\n* [[Tempe Pigott]] as Fortune teller/Gypsy\n* [[Alec Craig]] as Footman\n* [[Arthur Gould-Porter]] as Young Man\n* [[Brandon Hurst]] as Trustee\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 170\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Jane-Eyre-1943-4.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Jane-Eyre-LIFE-1944-O'Brien.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Margaret O'Brien\n}}\n\n===Development under David O. Selznick===\n[[David O. Selznick]] hired John Houseman in February 1941 while Houseman was directing Philip Barry's play ''Liberty Bell''. Houseman's first assignment for the producer would be writing the script to ''Jane Eyre''.<ref name=\"Houseman RT\"/>{{Rp|475, 478}} <ref>Lana Turner Heroine in 'Jekyll and Hyde':\nSchallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times5 Feb 1941: A10.</ref>\n\nHouseman later said \"I foolishly believed I would then produce the film because Selznick had just made ''Gone with the Wind'' and ''Rebecca'' and I believed he was going to take a rest from producing for a while and let me do the producing for his studio. This was one of the reasons I went to work for him. But I didn't know David Selznick! It was absolutely out of the question that he would dream of letting anybody else do anything.\"<ref name=\"john\">JOHN HOUSEMAN THE PRODUCER'S SIGNATURE INTERVIEW\nHandzo, Stephen.

Robert Stevenson, a British director Selznick had under contract, was sent to New York City to work with him.<ref name=\"Houseman RT\"/>{{Rp|478}}\n\nAfter the play's March 24 premiere, Houseman and Stevenson flew to the West Coast and completed the screenplay over the next five weeks. According to Houseman, Stevenson did most of the work. \"We finished it and presented it to our leader, only to discover that he had not the slightest intention of producing it,\" Houseman wrote.\n\n[[Aldous Huxley]] also contributed to the screenplay, rendering the character of Mrs. Rochester unseen\u2014assuring that she would be more menacing, and circumventing British censorship regulations on the depiction of madness. Other contributors to the script include [[DeWitt Bodeen]] and playwright Keith Winter.<ref name=\"AFI\"/>\n\n(Houseman - who had nothing to do with producing the final film - says when he saw the movie he was unhappy and asked for his name to be taken off, but they refused, so his credit stayed.<ref name=\"john\"/>)\n\n===Under 20th Century Fox===\nSelznick executive Daniel O'Shea began to offer the production as a package that included the services of Stevenson as director, Joan Fontaine as star,<ref name=\"Houseman RT\"/>{{Rp|478}} architect [[William Pereira]] as production designer and [[George Barnes (cinematographer)|George Barnes]] as cinematographer.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> The price was so \"fabulous\", Houseman wrote, that it took a year to find a buyer.\n\nIn the midst of the war boom<ref name=\"Houseman RT\">{{cite book |last=Houseman |first=John |author-link=John Houseman |title=Run-Through: A Memoir |url=https://archive.org/details/runthroughmemoir00hous |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location=New York |date=1972 |isbn=0-671-21034-3}}</ref>{{Rp|478}} in November 1942,<ref name=\"AFI\"/> Selznick finally sold the package to [[William Goetz]] at 20th Century Fox, which Goetz was running in the absence of [[Darryl F.

Other film projects included ''[[The Key to the Kingdom]]'' and ''[[Claudia (1943 film)|Claudia]]'', and talent contracts with Stevenson, [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Dorothy McGuire]], George Barnes, [[Stanley Cortez]], Gene Kelly, Alan Marshall, Ingrid Bergman and Joan Fontaine. Of all the projects, ''Jane Eyre'' was the one closest to being realised, but Selznick had been frustrated by his ability to get the right leading man.<ref>\n20th in Deal With Selznick: Independent Producer's Story Properties and Players Taken Over\nLos Angeles Times 16 Nov 1942: A1.</ref>\n\n===Under Orson Welles===\nSelznick had always wanted Orson Welles to play the role of Edward Rochester, but despaired of ever getting him because of his contract with [[RKO Pictures]].
