Reitman and Cody worked together previously on ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'' (2007). ''Young Adult'' began a limited release on December 9, 2011, before expanding to a wide release on December 16, 2011. It received generally positive reviews from critics, and Theron earned a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe]] nomination for her performance.<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/charlize-theron-starrer-young-adult-215106 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122170747/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/charlize-theron-starrer-young-adult-215106 |archive-date=November 22, 2011|access-date=November 22, 2011|title=Charlize Theron Starrer 'Young Adult' Opens in Limited Release Dec. 9|date=July 25, 2011|first=Pamela |last=McClintock |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMavis Gary is a 37-year-old divorced, [[alcoholic]] [[ghost writer]] of a series of [[young adult novel]]s, on deadline with her editor to finish the last book of the soon-to-be-canceled series. Mavis receives an e-mail with a picture of the newborn daughter of her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade and his wife Beth. Believing it to be a sign she and Buddy are meant to be together, Mavis leaves [[Minneapolis]], returning to her hometown of Mercury, Minnesota, to reclaim her life with Buddy, under the pretext of overseeing a real estate deal.\n\nArriving after listening to \"The Concept\" by [[Teenage Fanclub]] from an old [[mixtape]] Buddy gave her in high school, Mavis arranges to meet him the next day at a local sports bar, for old times' sake. Beforehand, she goes alone to the bar, Woody's. There she reconnects with a former classmate she barely remembers, Matt Freehauf, who became disabled after being beaten by jocks who erroneously assumed he was [[gay]]. He tells her that her plan to reclaim Buddy is irrational and selfish, but she ignores him.\n\nThe following day, Mavis meets Buddy at the bar, where they see Matt again, as he is the bookkeeper. On their way out, Buddy invites Mavis to a performance of Beth's \"mom rock band\". Mavis spends another night getting drunk with Matt, who distills homemade bourbon in his garage where he lives with his sister Sandra. On another outing with him, Mavis also runs into a cousin who lives locally. When Mavis attends the gig, the other moms are resentful of Mavis, whom they remember as the \"psychotic prom queen bitch\". When Beth's band performs, the lead singer dedicates their opening song to Buddy from Beth; \"The Concept\".\n\nBeth wants to stay out longer, so Mavis offers to drive the drunk Buddy home. On the lawn, they share a kiss that is quickly broken up when the [[babysitter]] opens the front door to greet them. The next day, after an awkward encounter with her parents, who didn't know Mavis was in town, Mavis is invited to Buddy's daughter's [[naming ceremony]]. She later goes out drinking with Matt again, and he tells her to grow up. The following day, Mavis attends the party, where she declares her love for Buddy, but he rebuffs her. Everyone at the party is called out to the lawn to await a surprise Buddy has prepared for Beth. Mavis, who has been drinking, collides with Beth, who accidentally spills punch on Mavis's dress. Mavis insults her and, in a profanity-laced tirade, tearfully reveals that she became pregnant with Buddy's baby years ago but had a [[miscarriage]] at three months.\n\nBuddy, who has been preparing a drum-set gift for Beth in the garage, opens the garage door and belatedly learns what has transpired. Mavis asks him why he invited her. He reveals it was Beth's idea, as she feels sorry for Mavis. Humiliated, Mavis leaves and visits Matt, where she breaks down in tears and, later, initiates sex. The following morning, while Matt sleeps, Mavis has coffee in the kitchen with Sandra, who still idolizes her. Mavis talks about needing to change herself, but Sandra says Mavis is better than the rest of Mercury and should not change. Mavis says she agrees and prepares to return to Minneapolis. Sandra asks to go with her but Mavis declines and leaves alone.\n\nIn a diner on her way home, Mavis writes the ending of the book, in which the main character graduates high school, quickly leaves her past behind, and looks forward to the future. Afterward, in the parking lot, she glances at the crumpled bumper of her car, before driving off.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Mavis Gary\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Matt Freehauf\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as Buddy Slade\n* [[Elizabeth Reaser]] as Beth Slade\n* [[Collette Wolfe]] as Sandra Freehauf \n* [[Jill Eikenberry]] as Hedda Gary\n* [[Louisa Krause]] as Hotel Clerk\n* [[Mary Beth Hurt]] as Jan\n* [[Hettienne Park]] as Vicki Robek\n* [[J.

When the production of ''[[Labor Day (novel)#Film adaptation|Labor Day]]'', a film Reitman had been preparing, was pushed to 2012, a window developed during which he could direct Cody's script, which was shot on a $12 million budget in 30 days.<ref name=fji /> The movie's location shooting was in [[Minnesota]], while the bulk of the movie, set in the fictional town of Mercury, was shot north of New York City in the towns of [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[Nanuet, New York|Nanuet]], [[New City, New York|New City]], [[Tappan, New York|Tappan]], [[Ardsley, New York|Ardsley]], and [[Port Chester, New York|Port Chester]], and in the [[Long Island]] towns of [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]] and [[Massapequa Park, New York|Massapequa Park]], the last of which included Woody's Village Saloon.
