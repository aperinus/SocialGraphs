The film was directed by [[Franco Zeffirelli]] and starred [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] in the [[Othello (character)|title role]], [[Katia Ricciarelli]] as [[Desdemona]] and [[Justino D\u00edaz]] as [[Iago]]. For the film's soundtrack, [[Lorin Maazel]] conducted the Orchestra and Chorus of the [[La Scala|Teatro alla Scala]]. The film premiered in [[West Germany]] on 28 August 1986 and received a U.S. theatrical release on 12 September 1986. It was nominated for a [[Bafta Award]] and a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n== Plot ==\nWith only a few exceptions, the film follows the same plot as the opera. Iago plots and brings about Otello's downfall by convincing him that his wife Desdemona is engaged in an affair with the young lieutenant [[Michael Cassio|Cassio]], provoking Otello to murder her in a blind rage. However, in a major change from the opera, Otello kills Iago at the end by throwing a spear at him, while in the stage version he only wounds him with his sword.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as Otello\n* [[Katia Ricciarelli]] as Desdemona\n* [[Justino D\u00edaz]] as Iago\n* [[Petra Malakova]] as Emilia\n* [[Urbano Barberini]] as Cassio\n* [[Massimo Foschi]] as Lodovico\n* [[Edwin Francis]] as Montano\n* [[Sergio Nicolai]] as Roderigo\n* [[Remo Remotti]] as Brabantio\n* [[Antonio Pierfederici]] as Doge\n\n==Production==\n[[Menahem Golan]] and [[Yoram Globus]] of [[Cannon Films]] worked out a deal with popular operatic [[tenor]] [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] to finance him in a film version of an opera. They wanted the singer to appear in an adaptation of [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]''. Domingo, however, suggested instead that they film [[Otello]], his signature role. While working with Italian director [[Franco Zeffirelli]] on a stage production of ''[[Tosca]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], Domingo discussed the possibility of collaborating again on another opera film. They had previously made television versions of ''[[Cavalleria rusticana (1982 film)|Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and ''[[Pagliacci (1982 film)|Pagliacci]]'' together, as well as a theatrically released film of Verdi's ''[[La Traviata (1983 film)|La Traviata]]''. Zeffirelli agreed to direct Domingo in ''Otello''.<ref name=\"Fawkes\">{{cite book|last=Fawkes|first=Richard|title=Opera on Film|date=2000|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|isbn=978-0-7156-2943-7|pages=188\u2013189}}</ref>\n\nShooting was scheduled to begin in 1985 at [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]]. Soon before the filming was to start, Mexico City was devastated by a massive earthquake. Domingo cancelled all his engagements in order to help with rescue efforts. Once the project came close to being scrapped, Domingo agreed to appear in Crete for the filming. Zeffirelli later recalled that the tenor used his hard work on ''Otello'' to help forget the traumatic sights in Mexico of the injured and dead (which included some of his family members).<ref name=\"Fawkes\" />\n\n==Music==\nFor the most part, the film follows the original score of the opera with several noticeable exceptions. The entire \"Willow Song\" (\"Salce, salce\"), Desdemona's solo aria, which is largely considered one of the most beautiful moments in the work, is omitted. However, her \"Ave Maria\", which follows immediately, is retained in the film. There are, at various points, smaller additional cuts in the music, such as the moment at the end of the storm scene when the chorus is cut short and the film skips to the [[recitativo]] between Iago and Roderigo. This contrasts with stage productions of ''Otello'', where the opera is rarely cut. There are also two additions: the extra music from the rarely performed third act ballet (written for the opera's [[Paris]] premiere) is inserted into the festivities of the first and third acts in the film.\n\nIn some scenes, Zeffirelli was able to use the medium of film to show aspects of his interpretation that could not be done onstage. In the movie, when Iago is informing Otello about Cassio's supposed dream in which he apparently said to Desdemona, \"Let us hide our loves\", we see Cassio singing the words, not Iago, as in the original stage version. Here Zeffirelli is showing the audience the image of Iago's fabricated dream as Otello is imagining it. Another of Zeffirelli's interpretive decisions was to show, complete with screams and sound effects, a flashback of marauding soldiers attacking an African village and snatching Otello (as a baby) from his mother, while the adult Otello and Desdemona sing their Act I love duet.\n\nOn the soundtrack album of the opera, released by [[EMI]], the music is presented with no cuts or additions, as it is when ''Otello'' is performed on the stage. The soundtrack album, however, has not proved to be as popular as Pl\u00e1cido Domingo's first recording of the opera, conducted by [[James Levine]] and released in 1978 by [[RCA Victor]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Otello'' was named [[National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Film]] of 1986 by the U.S. [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/1986/ |title=1986 Award Winners |date=2016 |publisher=[[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] |access-date=31 October 2016 }}</ref> It was nominated for a [[Bafta Award]] for the Best Foreign Language Film in 1987, but the award was won by [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]''. In the same category, it was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]. The film was also entered into the [[1986 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/836/year/1986.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Otello |access-date=2009-07-11|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]], in his ''Movie and Video Guide'', called the film \"nearly flawless\". [[Vincent Canby]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, criticized Zeffirelli for some of his alterations to the opera's music.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/12/movies/film-placido-domingo-in-zeffirelli-s-otello.html | title=Film: Placido Domingo in Zeffirelli's 'Otello' | first=Vincent | last=Canby | date=12 September 1986 | newspaper=The New York Times | access-date=10 January 2019}}</ref> In an interview in ''[[Opera News]]'', the film's star, [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], expressed similar displeasure in the movie's musical cuts. He also complained that the synchronization of the soundtrack with the film was improperly done, rendering the music half a step lower than it was recorded. In regard to his interpretation of Otello, he felt that some camera [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaways]] undermined what he was trying to express in his characterization. Overall, he deemed it a \"good film\" that \"could have been better\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scovell|first1=Jane|title=Domingo: Giving his Best|journal=Opera News|date=September 1987}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Shakespeare on screen]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1015709-otello}}\n\n{{Franco Zeffirelli}}\n{{Giuseppe Verdi}}\n{{Othello}}\n{{National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Otello (1986 Film)}}\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1980s musical films]]\n[[Category:Italian musical films]]\n[[Category:Dutch musical films]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Franco Zeffirelli]]\n[[Category:Films based on Othello]]\n[[Category:Films based on operas by Giuseppe Verdi]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 16th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Venice]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cyprus]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Crete]]\n[[Category:Golan-Globus films]]\n[[Category:Films based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Blackface minstrel shows and films]]\n[[Category:Opera films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Menahem Golan]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Yoram Globus]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian films]]\n\n[[ja:\u30aa\u30c6\u30ed (\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3)#\u6620\u753b]]"}]}}}}
