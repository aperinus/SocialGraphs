It stars [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[Robert Ryan]] with support from [[Anne Francis]], [[Dean Jagger]], [[Walter Brennan]], [[John Ericson]], [[Ernest Borgnine]] and [[Lee Marvin]]. The film is a [[crime drama]] set in 1945 that contains elements of the [[revisionist Western]] genre. In the plot, a one-armed stranger (Tracy) comes to a small desert town and uncovers an evil secret that has corrupted the entire community.\n\nThe film was based on a short story called \"Bad Time at Honda\" by [[Howard Breslin]], published by ''[[The American Magazine]]'' in January 1947. Filming began in July 1954 and the movie went on national release in January 1955. It was a box office success and was nominated for three [[28th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] in 1956. In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Tracy Bad Day at Black Rock Color Still 1955.jpg|thumb|left|Spencer Tracy and [[John Ericson]] in the hotel]]\nIn late 1945, one-armed John J. Macreedy gets off a train at the isolated [[deserts of California|Californian desert]] hamlet of Black Rock. The residents immediately appear suspicious, as this is the first time in four years that [[request stop|the train has stopped]] there. After Macreedy states he is looking for a man named Komoko, several of the local men become hostile. Hastings, the telegraph agent, tells him there are no cabs. The hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth, claims he has no vacant rooms. Hector David threatens him. Later, Reno Smith informs Macreedy that Komoko, a Japanese-American, was [[Japanese American internment|interned during World War II]].\n\nMacreedy visits the local sheriff, Tim Horn, but the alcoholic lawman is of no help. The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie, advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but lets slip that Komoko is dead. Pete's sister Liz rents Macreedy a [[Jeep]]. He drives to nearby Adobe Flat, where he finds a homestead burned to the ground, and wildflowers growing nearby. As Macreedy drives back, Coley Trimble tries to run him off the road. Macreedy tries to leave town, but Liz, having been confronted by Smith earlier, refuses to rent him the Jeep again. When Smith asks about his lost left arm, Macreedy discloses that he lost it [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|fighting in Italy]]. Macreedy says the wildflowers at the Komoko place lead him to suspect that a body is buried there. Smith reveals that he is virulently anti-Japanese; he tried to enlist the day after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], but failed the physical.\n\nMacreedy tries to telephone the state police, but Pete refuses to put the call through. Doc Velie admits that something terrible happened four years ago, but Smith has everyone too terrified to speak up. Velie offers Macreedy his old hearse to leave town, but Hector disables it. Macreedy writes a [[telegram]] to the state police and gives it to Hastings. Macreedy goes to the diner where Trimble provokes a fight with him but Macreedy, though disabled, easily beats him up by using martial arts. Macreedy confronts Smith and accuses him of killing Komoko with the help of others. Hastings arrives and tries to give Smith a piece of paper, but Macreedy snatches it away. It is his unsent telegram. Macreedy and Velie tell Hastings he has broken the law and demand that Horn take action. Horn stands up to arrest Hastings, but Smith pulls the sheriff's badge off Horn's shirt and pins it on Hector, who casually tears up the telegram.\n\nAfter Smith and Hector leave, Macreedy reveals that the loss of his arm had left him wallowing in self-pity, but Trimble's attempt to kill him has reinvigorated him. Macreedy finally reveals that Komoko's son died in combat (with the [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Infantry Regiment]]) while saving his life. Macreedy came to town intending to give the man's medal to Komoko. Macreedy learns that the elder Komoko had leased some farmland from Smith, who was sure there was no water. Komoko dug a well and found water. After Smith was rejected for military service, he and the other men got to drinking, then decided to scare Komoko. The old man barricaded himself inside his home, but the men set it on fire. When Komoko emerged ablaze, Smith shot and killed him.\n\nDoc and Pete enlist Liz to help Macreedy escape under cover of darkness. Hector is standing guard outside the hotel; Pete lures him into the office, where Doc Velie knocks him unconscious. Liz drives Macreedy out of town, but stops at Adobe Flat. Macreedy realizes he has been set up. When Smith starts shooting at him, Macreedy shelters behind the Jeep. Liz rushes to Smith despite Macreedy's warning. Smith tells her that she has to die along with the rest of his accomplices. Smith shoots her in the back as she flees. Macreedy finds a bottle and fills it with gas from the Jeep. When Smith climbs down for a better shot, Macreedy throws the [[Molotov cocktail]], setting Smith on fire. Macreedy drives back to town with Smith and Liz's body. The state police are called in and several arrests are made. As Macreedy is leaving town, Doc Velie requests Komoko's medal to help Black Rock heal. Macreedy gives it to him just before boarding the train.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as John J.

Schary had previously produced ''[[Go for Broke! (1951 film)|Go for Broke!]]'' (1951), based on the exploits of the segregated Japanese-American [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]].<ref name=\"Densho\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Metro to Stress Big-Budget Films |work=New York Times |date=August 7, 1953}}</ref> Breslin novelised the script, using the pseudonym Michael Niall.

The producers were worried about the title because \"Bad Time at Honda\" was similar to ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'', recently made by [[John Wayne]]. Kaufman suggested changing the name of the town to Black Rock, after a real town in Arizona. Kaufman finished the script in the fall of 1953.<ref name=\"Densho\"/> Although [[Spencer Tracy]] was 55 and much older than the platoon leader in the original story, Schary wanted Tracy to play the lead role.<ref>{{cite news |title=Metro Eyes Tracy For Western Lead |work=New York Times |date=August 13, 1953}}</ref> [[John Sturges]] was hired as director in June 1954 and shooting began the following month near [[Lone Pine, California]], where the small town set had been quickly constructed.<ref name=\"Densho\"/> Just before shooting began, an indecisive Tracy tried to back out of the picture. Schary made clear that he was willing to sue the actor if he quit the film.{{sfn|Andersen|1997|p=243}} Budget for the film was $1.3 million and it was shot in color using [[Cinemascope]] as Schary thought widescreen would emphasise the menace of the isolated town. Temperatures on location were over {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. On August 9, the cast and crew moved to the studio lot in [[Culver City]]. [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] was hired to write the score.<ref name=\"Densho\"/>\n\nWhile the film is essentially a [[crime drama]] set in 1945, it is recognised as a [[neo-Western]] with strong links to the [[revisionist Western]] genre.{{sfn|Newman|1990|p=198}} The premiere was at Loew's 72nd Street Theater in [[New York City]] on December 8, 1954. The film went on national release in January 1955.<ref name=\"Densho\"/> According to MGM records, it earned US$1,966,000 in the US and Canada and $1,822,000 elsewhere, making the studio a profit of $947,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\n==Themes==\nThough essentially a [[crime drama]] with [[revisionist Western]] overtones, the film is one of the first to recognise discrimination against Japanese Americans in World War II. No Japanese American characters are portrayed, though Komoko and his son, both dead, are central to the plot. In her 1991 documentary film, ''[[History and Memory: For Akiko and Takashige]]'', [[Rea Tajiri]] uses footage from  ''Bad Day at Black Rock'' to illustrate prevailing attitudes towards the Japanese. Tajiri's family were among those interned after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref name=\"Densho\"/>\n\nJohn Streamas describes the film as an indictment of both [[racism]] and [[McCarthyism]]. He comments on the unusual means of denunciation that it employs because, with no Japanese American characters taking part, there is no liberation of an oppressed victim. Instead, the film delivers justice for the victim of a murder that took place four years earlier.{{sfn|Streamas|2003|p=99}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nWhen ''Bad Day at Black Rock'' was released, the reviews were almost universally positive with, for example, [[John O'Hara]] in ''[[Collier's]]'' hailing it as \"one of the finest motion pictures ever made\".<ref name=\"Densho\"/> Many reviewers noted the film's Western-like elements, comparing it favorably with ''[[High Noon]]'' and cinematographer [[William C.
