Topo is a blind man traveling cross country in a Jeep with his associate John. They stop by Chloe's motel, when John hires prostitute Gwen, and convinces Topo to stay the night. When Gwen is entertaining John, an argument has John fatally shooting Gwen, waking Chloe up. Chloe investigating finds Gwen and John dead.\n\nThe police arriving, Chloe has a conversation with her police friend Billy who was Gwen's pimp. He comforts her while Chloe tells him she will not allow his girls to use the rooms in her motel anymore, as a social worker was around earlier threatening to take Sophia away. The following day Topo takes Chloe and Sophia hostage looking for the Jeep. As Sophia watches TV Chloe agrees to retrieve the Jeep from the police. Topo forces Chloe and Sophia to stake out Billy's residence. Billy's wife Amber answers the door and Chloe and Billy fight. Billy refuses to give Chloe the Jeep. Topo forces Chloe to break into the police junkyard and retrieve a package hidden behind the radio. After evading the Patrolman, Chloe reaches the car but cannot find the package.\n\nBack at the motel, Chloe learns more about Topo and figures out that he is a courier who is supposed to deliver bundles of money. She proposes to Topo that they split the money if she helps him faster and he reluctantly agrees due to his new impairment. After Chloe falls asleep with Sophia, Topo looks around and finds Chloe's hidden stash of emergency money.\n\nThe next morning, Topo and Chloe stake out, learning that John was Topo's nephew and Chloe's husband died in a hit and run. After finding Billy, Chloe follows him only to be found out and cornered in an alley. After Billy has Chloe pinned on the roof of the car, Topo sneaks up behind him and interrogates him and heads to Billy's house thinking the money is stashed there. After Chloe finds the money under the bed she is confronted by  Amber, whom Topo shoots. They leave after tying Billy to the radiator. They go back to the motel where Topo leaves with all of the money with another associate, Donnie.\n\nChloe calls the police and tells them that she was a hostage. They tell her that Billy was not found at his house and decide to leave a squad-car there for her safety. Topo and Donnie meet [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] mafia, Jacques and his associates in a car park. The mafia force Topo into the car and proceed to count the money to find that Topo is missing fifty grand, which Chloe has as her cut. When Jacques threatens to kill Topo, Topo kills them all. Back at the motel, Chloe packs her and Sophia's things, she sends the police away only to be approached by Topo to give her back her cut, when Billy shoots Topo and Donnie, and has cornered Chloe, who then throws him through a window, unintentionally fatally slicing his neck.\n\nChloe sets the scene to look like a deal gone bad, and takes Sophia into a taxi to parts unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alice Eve]] as Chloe\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as \"Topo\"  Topolewski\n* [[Logan Marshall-Green]] as Billy\n* [[Ursula Parker]] as Sophia\n* [[Leo Fitzpatrick]] as Donnie\n* [[Erin Cummings]] as Amber\n* [[Robin Lord Taylor]] as Quincy\n* [[Sarah Sokolovic]] as Gwen\n* Marceline Hugot as Denise\n* Stephen Sheffer as Jacques\n* [[Robert Prescott (actor)|Robert Prescott]] as Detective McKenney\n* [[Ashlie Atkinson]] as Social Worker\n* Dylan Chalfy as Police Officer\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot over 22 days in October and November 2012 in Windham, Cairo, and East Durham in Greene County, upstate New York.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} Formerly known as ''Eye of Winter ''and ''Cold Quarter'', the film is the second feature collaboration between director [[Tze Chun]] and producer [[Mynette Louie]]; their previous film, ''[[Children of Invention]]'', premiered at [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] in 2009.<ref>Kishori Rajan. \"Second-Time Director: Tze Chun and Eye of Winter\".
