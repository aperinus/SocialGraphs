The picture stars [[Irene Dunne]] as a woman who, after being [[Shipwreck|shipwrecked]] on a tropical island for several years and declared legally dead, returns to her [former] husband ([[Cary Grant]]) and children. The story is an adaptation of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s 1864 poem, \"[[Enoch Arden]]\"; in tribute, the main characters' last name is Arden. The supporting cast features [[Gail Patrick]] as the woman Arden has just married when his first wife returns, and [[Randolph Scott]] as the man with whom his wife was marooned. ''My Favorite Wife'' was [[RKO]]'s second-biggest hit of 1940.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter seven years, lawyer Nick Arden has his wife Ellen, missing since her ship was lost, [[declared death in absentia|declared legally dead]] [[Enoch Arden law|so he can marry]] Bianca.  Ellen, though, was actually shipwrecked on a deserted island, and has been rescued. When she returns home, she learns that Nick has just left on his honeymoon with his second wife.\n[[File:My Favorite Wife.jpg|thumb|Photo from ''My Favorite Wife'']]\nWhen Ellen tracks him down before his [[honeymoon]] night, he is at a loss as to how to break the news to Bianca and continually puts off the unpleasant task. Meanwhile, Bianca becomes frustrated by Nick's odd behavior (especially the nonconsummation of their marriage) and calls in a psychiatrist, Dr. Kohlmar. Further complications ensue when an insurance adjuster mentions to Nick a rumor that Ellen was not alone on the island, but had the company of a Stephen Burkett, and that they called each other \"Adam\" and \"Eve\". When Nick confronts Ellen, she recruits a mousy shoe salesman to pretend to be Stephen, but Nick has already tracked down the real Stephen.\n\nNick tries to explain the situation to Bianca and Dr. Kohlmar, but they do not believe him, until he is arrested on a charge of [[bigamy]]. In court, Judge Bryson, the same judge who had Ellen declared legally dead and also married Nick and Bianca, annuls the second marriage. By this time, Ellen is no longer sure of Nick's feelings for her. Stephen asks her to marry him and return with him to the island, but she still loves Nick. In the end, Nick and Ellen are reconciled.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Irene Dunne]] as Ellen Arden\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Nick Arden\n* [[Randolph Scott]] as Stephen Burkett\n* [[Gail Patrick]] as Bianca Bates\n* [[Ann Shoemaker]] as Ma, Nick's mother\n* [[Scotty Beckett]] as Tim, the Ardens' son\n* Mary Lou Harrington as Chinch, the Ardens' daughter\n* [[Donald MacBride]] as Hotel clerk\n* [[Hugh O'Connell]] as Johnson, the insurance adjuster\n* [[Granville Bates]] as Judge Bryson\n* [[Pedro de Cordoba]] as Dr. Kohlmar\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter the great success of ''[[The Awful Truth]]'' (1937), McCarey signed Cary Grant and Irene Dunne for the film without a script.<ref name=\"Bogdanovich\"/>{{Rp|419\u2013420}} He was to have directed ''My Favorite Wife'', as well, but after his near-fatal car accident, Garson Kanin was assigned as director.<ref name=\"RKO Story\">{{cite book |last1=Jewell |first1=Richard B. |last2=Harbin |first2=Vernon |date=1982 |title=The RKO Story |location=New York |publisher=Arlington House |isbn=9780517546567  }}</ref>{{Rp|148}} \"On ''My Favorite Wife'',\" recalled Gail Patrick, \"we were desperately trying to be funny as our producer, Leo McCarey, lay at death's door from an automobile crash.
