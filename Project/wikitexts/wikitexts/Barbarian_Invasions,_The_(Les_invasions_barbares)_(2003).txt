The film is a sequel to Arcand's 1986 film ''[[The Decline of the American Empire]]'', continuing the story of the character R\u00e9my, a womanizing history professor now terminally ill with cancer.\n\nThe sequel was a result of Arcand's longtime desire to make a film about a character close to death, also incorporating a response to the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001. It was produced by companies from both Canada and France, and shot mainly in [[Montreal]], also employing a former hospital and property near [[Lake Memphremagog]].\n\nThe film received a positive response from critics and became one of Arcand's biggest financial successes. It was the first Canadian film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], at the [[76th Academy Awards]] in 2004. It won awards at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]], six [[24th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]], and three [[29th C\u00e9sar Awards|C\u00e9sar Awards]], including [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]]. ''The Barbarian Invasions'' was followed by the thematically related ''[[Days of Darkness (2007 Canadian film)|Days of Darkness]]'' in 2007 and ''[[The Fall of the American Empire]]'' in 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nSeventeen years after the events of ''[[The Decline of the American Empire]]'', S\u00e9bastien is enjoying a successful career in quantitative finance in [[London]] when he receives a call from his mother, Louise, that his father and Louise's ex-husband R\u00e9my is terminally ill with cancer. S\u00e9bastien is not enthused about seeing R\u00e9my, whom he blames for breaking up the family with his many [[adultery|adulteries]]. R\u00e9my and his friends of the older generation are still largely [[social democracy|social-democrats]] and proponents of [[Quebec nationalism]], positions seeming somewhat anachronistic long after the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s. R\u00e9my does not like S\u00e9bastien's career, lack of reading or fondness for video games.\n\nThe father and son travel to the [[U.S. state]] of [[Vermont]] to briefly receive medical care before returning to the overcrowded and disorganized Quebec hospital. S\u00e9bastien attempts to bribe hospital administration for better care, and calls R\u00e9my's old friends about a possible visit. Upon hearing [[heroin]] is \"800%\" more effective than morphine, he tracks some down for R\u00e9my from a drug addict, Nathalie.\n\nMeanwhile, R\u00e9my is reunited with his friends, including Pierre, Dominique, Claude and Diane, Nathalie's mother, and they share a conversation on their old sex drive and the gradual decline of their vitality. Diane is concerned for Nathalie, while R\u00e9my, a history professor, lectures the hospital chaplain Constance on the relative peace of the 20th century compared to past centuries. At the same time, another scholar describes the [[September 11 attacks]] as historically small except as a possible beginning of modern [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]].  After R\u00e9my and his friends retreat to the countryside, they speak of their devotion to constantly evolving [[-ism]]s. R\u00e9my dies in the company of his friends and S\u00e9bastien, after a heroin injection from Nathalie, whom R\u00e9my calls his guardian angel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[R\u00e9my Girard]] as R\u00e9my\n* [[St\u00e9phane Rousseau]] as S\u00e9bastien\n* [[Doroth\u00e9e Berryman]] as Louise\n* [[Louise Portal]] as Diane\n* [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]] as Nathalie (Diane's daughter)\n* [[Marina Hands]] as Ga\u00eblle\n* [[Dominique Michel]] as Dominique\n* [[Pierre Curzi]] as Pierre\n* [[Yves Jacques]] as Claude\n* [[Isabelle Blais]] as Sylvaine\n* Toni Cecchinato as Alessandro\n* [[Sophie Lorain]] as First Lover\n* [[Mitsou|Mitsou G\u00e9linas]] as Ghislaine\n* [[Micheline Lanct\u00f4t]] as Nurse Carole\n* [[Johanne-Marie Tremblay]] as Sister Constance\n* [[Roy Dupuis]] as Narcotics Officer Gilles Levac\n* [[Lise Roy]] as Mme.
