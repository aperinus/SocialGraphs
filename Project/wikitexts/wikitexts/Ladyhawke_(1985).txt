The story is about a young thief who becomes unwillingly involved with a warrior and his lady who are hunted by the Bishop of Aquila. As he learns about the couple's past and secret, he chooses to help them overcome the bishop's forces: men-at-arms, a wolf hunter and an infernal curse.\n\n==Plot==\n<!---Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film summaries are to contain only the most essential info to advance the plot, and are not to exceed 700 words.

Current wordcount is 659. --->\n\nIn [[Italy in the Middle Ages|medieval Italy]], Phillipe Gaston, a thief known as \"The Mouse\", is imprisoned in the dungeons of the evil Bishop of [[L'Aquila|Aquila]]. Phillipe escapes, just in time to avoid execution. He is recaptured at an inn by the Bishop's guards, led by Captain Marquet. The former captain, Etienne Navarre, arrives, rescues him, and defeats Marquet and the guards. As Navarre and Phillipe flee on horseback, Navarre's [[hawk]] scatters the other guards, aiding the escape.\n\nNavarre and Phillipe stay the night at a farmer's barn. Later, Phillipe tries to leave, but the farmer attempts to kill him. An enormous [[melanism|black]] [[european wolf|wolf]] protects him by killing the farmer. Phillipe looks for Navarre in the barn, but discovers a beautiful young woman, dressed in Navarre's cloak, who walks away with the wolf.\n\nIn the morning, Navarre returns, reveals his intention to kill the Bishop, and asks Phillipe to help him get inside Aquila. Phillipe refuses, and Navarre ties him to a tree. That night, Phillippe meets the woman again and tricks her into cutting his bonds. The next day, he is captured by the Bishop's guards, who use him to set up an ambush for Navarre. During the ambush, Navarre and his hawk are each hit by a crossbow bolt, but Navarre manages to defeat the Bishop's guards and save Phillipe.\n\nNavarre orders Phillipe to take the hawk, who is the worse injured of the two of them, and ride ahead to the ruined castle of a monk named Imperius for help. The hawk is sequestered in a room, but a curious Phillipe picks the lock and finds the mysterious woman inside, her chest struck with the bolt. After tending to her wound, Imperius explains that she is Isabeau of Anjou, who had once refused the Bishop's unwelcome advances. After a drunken Imperius leaked the fact that Navarre and Isabeau had secretly wed, the enraged Bishop put the couple under a satanic curse. Isabeau becomes a hawk by day and Navarre a wolf by night; despite being always together, they are eternally apart. Just before dawn, Imperius' castle is invaded by the Bishop's soldiers; while escaping, Isabeau falls off a tower, but Phillipe is able to hold onto her for a moment, letting her go just as the sunrise turns her into a hawk so she can fly away.\n\nWhen Navarre catches up, Imperius tells him that the curse can be broken if the couple faces the Bishop, both as humans, on \"a day without a night and a night without a day\". Navarre dismisses Imperius as an old drunk, and continues on his way to Aquila, intent on simply killing the Bishop for revenge. Now invested in the lovers' story, Phillipe volunteers to accompany them. After the group's perilous encounters with a wolf-trapper and a frozen river, Phillipe saves Navarre's life, earns his friendship, and convinces him to try to break the curse before killing the Bishop.\n\nAt night, Imperius and Isabeau smuggle the Navarre-wolf into Aquila, while Phillipe swims back through the sewers to get inside the cathedral. Seeing no divine sign on the day that he and Isabeau are to appear as humans together, Navarre reverts to his original plan to kill the Bishop. He orders Imperius to euthanize the hawk should the cathedral bells ring, which would mean he had failed.\n\nPhillipe infiltrates the cathedral and unlocks its doors. Navarre rides in and duels with Marquet. Suddenly noticing a [[solar eclipse]] through a window, Navarre realises Imperius was right. He tries to get back to Imperius, but fails to keep the guards from ringing the bell. Believing that Imperius has killed Isabeau, Navarre continues his fight and eventually kills Marquet.\n\nAs Navarre is about to execute the unarmed Bishop, a human Isabeau enters the cathedral and stops him. Together, she and Navarre face the Bishop and break the curse. The maddened Bishop tries to kill Isabeau, only to die by Navarre's sword. Isabeau and Navarre finally embrace in joy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Phillipe Gaston, a young thief known as \"The Mouse\".\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as Etienne of [[Navarre]], the former [[Captain of the Guard]] of Aquila, who is hunted by the Bishop.\n:* Akeela, Kollchek, Levi, and Sasha\u2014a quartet of [[black wolf|melanistic]] Siberian [[wolf|wolves]]\u2014as Etienne's lupine form.<ref name=\"Senn2017\">{{cite book |author-last=Senn |author-first=Bryan |chapter=Ladyhawke |title=The Werewolf Filmography: 300+ Movies |publisher=MacFarland |date=2017 |pages=140\u2013141}}</ref>{{rp|141}}\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Isabeau of [[Duchy of Anjou|Anjou]], the Comte d'Anjou's daughter, who is hunted by the Bishop.\n:* Gift (c.1979\u20132 or 3 Dec 2014)<ref name=\"WIREC\">{{cite web |author=Wildlife Images Rehabilitation & Education Center |publisher=Facebook |url=https://www.facebook.com/155892084458559/posts/today-marks-the-passing-of-one-of-our-most-famous-animals-here-at-wildlife-image/850578711656556/  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/155892084458559/850578711656556 |archive-date=2022-02-26 |url-access=limited|title=Today marks the passing of one of our most famous animals \u2026 |date=3 Dec 2014 |access-date=24 Jul 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=\"RutgerHauer\">{{cite web |publisher=Rutger Hauer Official Website |url=http://www.rutgerhauer.org/tv/2014gift.php |title=Gift\u2014The Red-Tailed Hawk |date=Dec 2014 |access-date=24 Jul 2019}}</ref> and Ladyhawke (d.

Richard Donner stated that he was listening to [[The Alan Parsons Project]] (on which Powell collaborated) while scouting for locations, and became unable to separate his visual ideas from the music. Powell combined traditional orchestral music and [[Gregorian chants]] with contemporary [[progressive rock]]-infused material. At the time, it was part of a trend among 1980s fantasy films of abandoning the lush orchestral scores of composers such as  [[John Williams]], [[James Horner]], and Jerry Goldsmith in favor of a modern pop/rock sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/ladyhawke.html |title=''Ladyhawke'' - Soundtrack |publisher=filmtracks.com}}</ref>  The [[soundtrack album]] was released in 1985 and re-released with additional tracks in 1995.
