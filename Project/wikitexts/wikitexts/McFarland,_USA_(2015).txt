The film was co-produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and Mayhem Pictures. Based on the true story of a 1987 [[Cross country running|cross country]] team from a [[McFarland High School (California)|mainly Latino high school]] in [[McFarland, California]], the film stars [[Kevin Costner]] as [[James White (cross-country)|Jim White]], the school's coach, who leads the team to win a state championship.<ref name=THRCostner>{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Kevin Costner in Talks to Star in Disney's Sports Drama 'McFarland'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-costner-disney-mcfarland-352525|access-date=1 December 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=20 July 2013}}</ref> The film also stars [[Maria Bello]] and [[Morgan Saylor]].\n\n''McFarland, USA'' was released on February 20, 2015, received positive reviews from critics, and grossed over $45 million. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 2, 2015 by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1987, [[American football|football]] coach Jim White loses his job after he loses his temper and accidentally injures a team player in the locker room. He and his family relocate to his new job at [[McFarland High School (California)|McFarland High School]] in [[McFarland, California]], which is predominantly Latino. The family has trouble adjusting to the Hispanic neighborhood and lament being unable to afford to live in [[Bakersfield]].\n\nWhite is first put as assistant football coach, but ultimately loses his coaching status when he pulls an injured player, Johnny Sameniego, out of a game, causing the crass Head Coach Jenks to ask him to step down.\n\nDiscovering that some of his students are strong runners, White has Principal Camillo authorize [[Cross country running|cross-country]] as a sport and organizes an all-boys team. He enlists Sameniego's help and recruits Thomas Valles, Jose Cardenas, Victor Puentes and brothers David, Damacio and Danny Diaz. All seven have little hope for their future, specifically Valles, who has hardships with his father and nearly throws himself off a bridge before White stops him. Jim's devotion to the team leads to him alienating his family, including forgetting to pick up his daughter Julie's birthday cake.\n\nAfter a few regional competitions, the team wins its first race. Shortly after, the Diaz brothers are taken off the team by their father, who wants them to work for his team of [[Farmworker|field pickers]] instead. In response, White joins them in the fields and convinces them to come to meets and races at earlier and later times of the day, to which they finally address him as \"coach\". White's wife Cheryl organizes a [[tamale]] and car wash sale with the rest of the neighborhood to raise money for new uniforms, where the family and the neighborhood become better acquainted.\n\nEventually, the McFarland team competes in and qualifies for the State Tournament, and White takes them to the beach to celebrate. White also makes amends with Julie by throwing her a [[quincea\u00f1era]] with help from the neighbors, though it goes wrong when Julie is taken out on \"parade\" around the town and the group is attacked by street punks.\n\nDespite the group's insistence that Julie was protected, Jim questions his family's safety in McFarland and interviews for a full-time position at [[Palo Alto]] that he was previously offered, upsetting Julie and Thomas. Cheryl implores him to continue to be there for the McFarland team and their friends in the neighborhood, reminding him how much the community has embraced them.\n\nThe day of the state championships comes and almost the whole McFarland community accompanies the team to the race. Because of White's rigorous training and the efforts of the entire team, McFarland upsets the other more favored schools and comes in first. After the race, Jim turns down the Palo Alto position and embraces his family and the team.\n\nA series of texts shows that under White's guidance, the team becomes outstandingly successful, winning nine state titles over fourteen years. All the members of the first team become the first in their families to go to college or into military careers. Almost all members continue to attend the practices that Jim White held for successive school cross country teams even after graduation from college. White continued teaching and coaching in McFarland until his retirement in 2003 and after that he continued living in McFarland.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing credits order, with roles as credited --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Kevin Costner]] as [[James White (cross-country)|Jim White]]\n*[[Maria Bello]] as Cheryl White\n*[[Morgan Saylor]] as Julie White\n*Carlos Pratts as Thomas Valles\n*[[Elsie Fisher]] as Jamie White\n*Johnny Ortiz as Jose Cardenas\n*Hector Duran as Johnny Sameniego\n*Sergio Avelar as Victor Puentes\n*Michael Aguero as Damacio Diaz\n*Rafael Martinez as David Diaz\n*Ramiro Rodriguez as Danny Diaz\n*[[Diana-Maria Riva]] as Se\u00f1ora Diaz\n*[[Vanessa Mart\u00ednez]] as Maria Marsol\n*[[Martha Higareda]] as Lupe\n*[[Valente Rodriguez]] as Principal Camillo\n*[[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]] as Coach Jenks\n*[[Eloy Casados]] as Dale Padilla\n*[[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]] as Se\u00f1ora Valles\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[William Broyles Jr.]] was hired to write the screenplay for the film, which was in development since 2004.<ref>{{cite news|last=Foreman|first=Liza|title=William Broyles Jr. Boards Disney's 'McFarland' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/william-broyles-jr-boards-disneys-mcfarland-exclusive-67186|access-date=1 December 2013|newspaper=The Wrap|date=29 November 2012}}</ref> Negotiations for [[Kevin Costner]] to star were finalized in July 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=White|first=James|title=Kevin Costner On For McFarland|url=https://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=37971|access-date=1 December 2013|newspaper=Empire|date=1 July 2013}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Camarillo, California]], and many of McFarland's residents were extras in the movie.<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney movie starring Kevin Costner filming in Camarillo|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2013/oct/15/disney-movie-starring-kevin-costner-filming-in/|access-date=1 December 2013|newspaper=Ventura County Star|date=15 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"history_hollywood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/mcfarland-usa/|title=History vs Hollywood: McFarland, USA|access-date=2015-05-23|publisher=www.historyvshollywood.com}}</ref>\n\n===Historical accuracy===\nIn an interview, Jim White noted that while the film was based on a true story, it was not a documentary. He acknowledged that not everything in the film was factual, but that \"it's still an enjoyable movie... it turned out fine.\" Some of the more notable differences included:<ref name=\"history_hollywood\" />\n\n* Jim White had not been fired from numerous prior teaching jobs before starting at McFarland. He started teaching in the McFarland school district after graduating from [[Pepperdine University]] in 1964. During that time, McFarland was predominantly white in terms of demographics. White taught different subjects at numerous grade levels (fifth grade science, seventh and eighth grade woodshop, and PE) before starting his coaching career in 1980. White retired in 2003 after 23 years of coaching.\n* White did not establish the cross-country team at the school, but instead restarted it after it had been dropped for a year. He rebuilt both the boys' and girls' cross-country teams, despite only the boys' team being featured in the film. Similarly, White took both teams to the California coast beach at [[Cayucos, California|Cayucos]] during the 1985 (not 1987) season.\n* Not all runners from the 1987 team are featured in the film. Director Niki Caro wanted to feature more family in the film, so Luis Partida, who was on the team, was replaced with David Diaz, Damacio and Danny's brother. David, however, graduated the year before McFarland's first state title win.\n* Jim White and his wife Cheryl have three daughters, not two. Their oldest daughter, Tami, does not appear in the film. Julie and Jami are also portrayed relatively younger than their real ages at the time of McFarland's first state title win in 1987 (all three were in college during that time).\n* Danny Diaz was not overweight as a child. He was, however, the seventh person on the team and still instrumental to its 1987 state title win.\n* McFarland was not rivals with Palo Alto High School (the schools are 4 hours apart) nor did the schools ever race each other. This was made up to serve the plot.\n\n==Release==\nThe film was previously slated for a November 21, 2014 release, under the title ''McFarland'',<ref>{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title=Pixar's 'The Good Dinosaur' Pushed Back Nearly 18 Months After Losing Director|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pixars-good-dinosaur-pushed-back-631722|access-date=18 September 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=18 September 2013}}</ref> but was pushed back to February 20, 2015 and given a new title.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Busch|first1=Anita|title=Kevin Costner Movie 'McFarland' Moves Out Of 2014|url=https://deadline.com/2014/08/costner-movie-mcfarland-moves-out-of-2014-823323/|access-date=August 23, 2014|publisher=deadline.com|date=August 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Kevin Costner's Sports Drama 'McFarland USA' Pushed to 2015|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/kevin-costner-mcfarland-pushed-2015-1201288407/|access-date=August 24, 2014|work=Variety|date=August 22, 2014}}</ref> The film was released in Canada under its original title, ''McFarland''.\n\n=== Home media ===\n''McFarland, USA'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 2, 2015 by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = McFarland, USA (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = [[Film score]]\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = February 17, 2015\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = {{flat list|\n*[[Latin pop]]\n}}\n| length     = 46:31\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Ant\u00f4nio Pinto (composer)|Antonio Pinto]]\n| prev_title = [[Trash (2014 film)|Trash]]\n| prev_year  = 2014\n| next_title = [[Amy (soundtrack)|Amy]]\n| next_year  = 2015\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n|collapsed=no\n|extra_column   = Artist(s)\n|title1         = [[Juntos (Together)]]\n|extra1         = [[Juanes]]\n|length1        = 3:18\n|title2         = The Real McFarlands\n|extra2         = [[Ant\u00f4nio Pinto (composer)|Ant\u00f4nio Pinto]]\n|length2        = 2:39\n|title3         = [[Me and Baby Brother]]\n|extra3         = [[War (American band)|War]]\n|length3        = 3:26\n|title4         = Let's Hit It Again\n|extra4         = Ant\u00f4nio Pinto\n|length4        = 1:54\n|title5         = Lord's Prayer\n|extra5         = Ant\u00f4nio Pinto\n|length5        = 3:48\n|title6         = [[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]\n|extra6         = [[Mongo Santamar\u00eda]]\n|length6        = 2:26\n|title7         = Barbie Bike\n|extra7         = Ant\u00f4nio Pinto\n|length7        = 1:45\n|title8         = [[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]\n|extra8         = [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]]\n|length8        = 4:29\n|title9         = Convoy to State\n|extra9         = Ant\u00f4nio Pinto\n|length9        = 2:05\n|title10        = Whittier Blvd.\n|extra10        = [[Thee Midniters]]\n|length10       = 2:28\n|title11        = Beach\n|extra11        = Ant\u00f4nio Pinto\n|length11       = 2:26\n|title12        = This Ain't Golf\n|extra12        = Ant\u00f4nio Pinto\n|length12       = 2:10\n|title13        = That's Not Danny Diaz\n|extra13        = Ant\u00f4nio Pinto\n|length13       = 7:52\n|title14        = McFarland Theme\n|extra14        = Ant\u00f4nio Pinto\n|length14       = 2:43\n|title15        = Am\u00e9rica\n|extra15        = [[Los Tigres del Norte]]\n|length15       = 3:02\n|total_length   = 46:31\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n=== Box office ===\n''McFarland, USA'' grossed $44.5 million in North America and $1.2 million in other territories for a total gross of $45.7 million.\n\nThe film opened in North America on February 20, 2015 and earned $11 million in its opening weekend, finishing 4th at the box office.<ref name=\"BO\">{{cite web | url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4029&p=.htm|title=Weekend Report: Moviegoers Flee From 'Fifty Shades'|author=Ray Subers|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=February 22, 2015|access-date=February 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] has reported an 80% approval rating, based on 120 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|rating average]] of 6.7/10.
