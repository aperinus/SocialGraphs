Grimes' second in command, Margaret Wells, begins working with Crowe and seduces him, enticing him with a plot to murder Grimes so they can take over the firm.\n\nThe Toolshed's top client, Curl Industries, is being sued in a [[class action lawsuit]] in a case currently on appeal at the [[Washington State Supreme Court]]. Curl Industries is accused of poisoning the water supply to a small town, resulting in the birth of disabled children. Grimes gives Crowe $1 million to bribe one of the justices, Justin Beach, into swinging the verdict in favor of Curl Industries.\n\nCrowe and Toolshed operative Todd Stapp buy Justice Beach's $25,000 gambling debt from [[bookmaker]] Bobby Birdsong and pay for information on Beach's personal life from his friend, Les Goodwin. During a secret progress report meeting, Crowe is revealed to in fact be a [[mole (espionage)|mole]] for the CIA, albeit against his will. Crowe was dismissed from the agency on suspicion of stealing a $50,000 bribe meant for an Iraqi colonel.\n\nCrowe's former boss, William \"Smitty\" Smithfield, is threatening prison time or the disappearance of the bribe as leverage to get Crowe to infiltrate the Toolshed. The CIA intends to acquire the firm and use it as a [[black operations]] hub with Smitty in charge. During the meeting, as he turns over the $1 million bribe money for inspection, Crowe secretly records his conversation with Smitty, who also forces him to sign a receipt. Stapp later discovers Crowe's secret objective and extorts a payoff from Smitty to remain silent about it.\n\nBeach accepts the $1 million bribe delivered by Crowe. He and his mistress Julie Ames sign a receipt to ensure Beach's cooperation. Beach buys tickets for a flight to the [[Caribbean]] and sends Julie ahead with the money, telling her he intends to leave his wife and join her. However, after reneging on his agreement and voting against Curl Industries, Beach commits suicide.\n\nDespite the setback caused by Beach's death and his vote, Wells and Crowe continue with their plan to murder Grimes. Wells spends a romantic weekend with Grimes at his fishing cabin. Crowe sneaks in and shoots Grimes, then beats Wells to make it appear like the murder was a robbery gone wrong.\n\nWells and Crowe then take over the Toolshed, though Wells now rebuffs Crowe's affections towards her, having used him to get what she wanted. Upon hearing of her lover's death, Julie travels to Europe, sending Goodwin postcards telling him how she's enjoying spending the $1 million. Goodwin sells this information to Crowe, who takes it to Wells. Wells orders Crowe to find and kill Julie because of her knowledge of the bribe attempt. Smitty confronts Wells in her office at the Toolshed and informs her of the CIA's plan to take over and also of Crowe's involvement in the agency's infiltration.\n\nJulie buys a gun from Goodwin and goes to Crowe's apartment to kill him in revenge for Beach's death. She arrives shortly after Wells, who also came to kill Crowe. In a chaotic shootout, Julie blindly fires at both as Crowe and Wells shoot each other dead.\n\nJulie somehow remains unharmed. As she meticulously picks up her shell casings, she finds Crowe's briefcase containing incriminating evidence, including the tape of his conversations with Smitty and the receipt she and Beach signed. After burning the receipt, Julie mails the tape to the [[U.S. Attorney|U.S. Attorney's office]] to expose the corrupt dealings of both the CIA and the Toolshed. She then leaves town for good, alone.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Margaret Wells\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Nelson Crowe\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Vic Grimes\n* [[Michael Beach]] as Tod Stapp\n* [[Gia Carides]] as Julie Ames\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Judge Justin Beach\n* [[Daniel Hugh Kelly]] as Les Goodwin\n* [[Spalding Gray]] as Walter Curl\n* [[James Hong]] as Bobby Birdsong\n* Tegan West as Al\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as William \"Smitty\" Smithfield (uncredited)\n* [[Michelle Beaudoin]] as Wanda\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics.
