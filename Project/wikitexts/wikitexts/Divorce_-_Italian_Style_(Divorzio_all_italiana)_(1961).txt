The screenplay is by Germi, [[Ennio De Concini]], [[Alfredo Giannetti]], and [[Agenore Incrocci]], based on [[Giovanni Arpino]]'s novel ''[[Un delitto d'onore]]'' (''Honour Killing''). It stars [[Marcello Mastroianni]], [[Daniela Rocca]], [[Stefania Sandrelli]], [[Lando Buzzanca]], and [[Leopoldo Trieste]]. The movie won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Story and Screenplay \u2013 Written Directly for the Screen]]; Mastroianni was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] and Germi for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n==Plot==\nFerdinando Cefal\u00f9 ([[Marcello Mastroianni]]), a 37-year-old impoverished [[Sicily|Sicilian]] nobleman, is married to Rosalia ([[Daniela Rocca]]), a devoted wife he no longer loves. He is in love with his cousin Angela ([[Stefania Sandrelli]]), a 16-year-old girl he sees only during the summer because her family sends her away to Catholic school in the city. Besides his wife, he shares his life with his elderly parents, his sister, and her fianc\u00e9, a funeral director; the family share their once stately palace with his uncles, who are slowly but surely eating away the remainders of their once rich estate.\n\nAware that [[Divorce law by country#Italy|divorce is illegal]], Ferdinando fantasizes about doing away with his [[wife]], such as by throwing her into a boiling [[cauldron]], sending her into [[Outer space|space]] in a rocket, or drowning her in quicksand. After a chance encounter with Angela during a family trip, he discovers that she shares his feelings. Inspired by a local story of a woman who killed her husband in a rage of [[jealousy]], he resolves to lead his wife into having an affair so that he can catch her ''[[wikt:in flagrante delicto|in flagrante delicto]]'', murder her, and receive a light sentence for committing an [[Honour killing#Italy|honour killing]]. He first needs to find a suitable lover for his wife, whom he finds in the local priest's [[godson]], Carmelo Patan\u00e8 ([[Leopoldo Trieste]]), a painter who has had feelings for Rosalia for years and was for a time presumed killed during [[World War II]]. He also procures the State Prosecutor's friendship with a small favor. The final stage of his plan is to arrange for Carmelo's constant presence in his house, which he achieves by feigning interest in having his palace frescoes restored.\n\nBut Carmelo is timid with Rosalia, and she is initially committed to conjugal fidelity. Ferdinando tapes their private conversations and has to ward off the maid Sisina's infatuation with Carmelo. After Carmelo makes a pass at Sisina, she tells the priest, Carmelo's godfather, at confession, who informs her that Carmelo is married with three children, information she relays to Ferdinando. Rosalia and Carmelo finally give in to their passion but the tape of their conversation runs out just as they are arranging their next meeting. All Ferdinando knows is that it will take place the next evening.\n\nRosalia feigns a headache and remains home while the rest of the family goes to the cinema to see the local premi\u00e8re of ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', a film so scandalous that no one wants to miss it. Ferdinando sneaks out of the theatre and returns home, arriving just in time to see Rosalia leaving for the train station. He retrieves his gun to kill her, but arrives at the station just after their train departs. He revisits his plan and the Criminal Code. It defines a [[crime of passion]] as executed in the heat of the moment or in defense of one's honor, so he embraces the role of a [[cuckold]].\n\nAll along, Angela has been writing Ferdinando to assure him of her undying love for him. Her last letter is misdelivered to her father, who dies of a heart attack upon reading it. At the funeral, Ferdinando is approached by Mrs. Patan\u00e8, who demands to know what he will do about their situation. After he responds noncommittally, she spits in his face in front of the entire town, which gives him what he needs: an open insult to the family's honor due to his wife's elopement. The local [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] boss offers to find the lovers within 24 hours, which he does. As Ferdinando goes to the lovers' hideout, he hears Mrs. Patan\u00e8 kill Carmelo. He follows suit and kills Rosalia. At his trial he is defended by the State Prosecutor, who blames the whole thing on Ferdinando's father and his lack of love when raising him as a boy. He spends no more than three years in prison and returns home to find Angela waiting for him.\n\nIn the film's epilogue, Ferdinando and Angela are happily sailing at sea. As they kiss, the camera pans down, revealing Angela seductively rubbing her feet against those of the workman piloting the boat.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Mastroianni divorzio italiana.jpg|thumb|[[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Ferdinando Cefal\u00f9]]\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Ferdinando Cefal\u00f9\n* [[Daniela Rocca]] as Rosalia Cefal\u00f9\n* [[Stefania Sandrelli]] as Angela\n* [[Leopoldo Trieste]] as Carmelo Patan\u00e8\n* [[Odoardo Spadaro]] as Don Gaetano Cefal\u00f9\n* Margherita Girelli as Sisina\n* Angela Cardile as Agnese\n* [[Lando Buzzanca]] as Rosario Mul\u00e8\n* [[Pietro Tordi]] as Attorney De Marzi\n* Ugo Torrente as Don Calogero\n* [[Antonio Acqua]] as Priest\n* Bianca Castagnetta as Donna Matilde Cefal\u00f9\n* Giovanni Fassiolo\n* Ignazio Roberto Daidone\n* Francesco Nicastro\n\n==Release==\n''Divorce Italian Style'' was released in Rome in December 1961.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=22814|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402220610/http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=22814|archive-date=April 2, 2014|title=Divorce--Italian Style|access-date=October 25, 2018|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nWhen the film was released in the United States, it earned [[theatrical rental]]s of $803,666 in 1962 and a further $1,449,347 in 1963 for a total of $2,252,013 in the United States and Canada and was still in release in 1964.<ref name=rentals/>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
