Gordon]]. It stars [[Peter Graves]], [[Peggie Castle]], and [[Morris Ankrum]]. An agricultural scientist, played by Graves, successfully grows gigantic vegetables using [[radiation]]. Unfortunately, the vegetables are eaten by [[locust]]s (the swarming phase of short-horned [[grasshopper]]s), which quickly grow to a gigantic size and attack the nearby city of [[Chicago]]. ''Beginning of the End'' is generally known for its \"atrocious\" [[special effect]]s, \"and yet,\" writes reviewer Bill Warren, \"there is something almost compellingly watchable about this goofy little movie\".<ref name=\"Warren325326\">Warren, ''Keep Watching the Skies! American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties,'' 1997, p. 325-326.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with newspaper [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]] Audrey Aimes accidentally stumbling upon a small town ([[Ludlow, Illinois]]) which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 residents are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects that the military is covering something up, and travels to a nearby [[United States Department of Agriculture]] experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright, who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Wainwright reports that there have been a number of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby grain silo.\n\nGigantic mutant locusts rampage over the countryside.  Wainwright and Aimes begin to track down the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly discover that the locusts which ate the grain have grown to the size of a city bus. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now have turned to human beings as a source of sustenance. It is also clear that they are headed for Chicago.  Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson, Colonel Sturgeon, and Captain Barton to try to come up with a solution. [[Machine gun]] and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once. The [[United States Army]] and [[Illinois National Guard]] are called upon to help protect the city.  But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and begin to feast on human flesh, as well as several buildings.\n\nGeneral Hanson concludes that the only way to destroy the beasts ''en masse'' is to use a [[nuclear weapon]] and destroy Chicago. However, Wainwright realizes that the locusts are warm-weather creatures. He concludes that he might be able to lure the locusts into [[Lake Michigan]] using a decoy locust [[mating call]], generated electronically with test-tone oscillators. There, the cold water will incapacitate them, and they will drown. The plan works at the last possible moment.  The monstrous locusts drown, but Wainwright and Aimes wonder if other insects or animals might have eaten other radioactive crops.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=50%}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Peter Graves]] as Dr. Ed Wainwright\n*[[Peggie Castle]] as Audrey Aimes\n*[[Morris Ankrum]] as Gen.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was particularly negative. Calling the movie \"derivative\", the industry trade publication said, \"Summarizing the plot of ''Beginning of the End'' is like rehashing the story of several dozen similar films.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\">\"Film Reviews: 'Beginning of the End',\" ''Variety,'' July 3, 1957.</ref> The publication felt that not much effort had been put into the film. \"Even taken on its own terms\u2014as a low-budget exploitation feature\u2014''Beginning of the End'' hardly reflects the best effort of a major theatre circuit.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> It called the special effects \"obvious\" and decried the use of stock footage.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> The reviewer felt the screenplay was \"ludicrous\" and clich\u00e9-ridden.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> The magazine believed Peter Graves had turned in a decent performance, but described Peggie Castle's performance as \"unconvincing\" and Morris Ankrum's as \"artificial\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> The cinematography and editing were, it concluded, average.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Mae Tinnee, reviewing the motion picture for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' had several negative comments. \"The film obviously was made on a shoestring budget, and the people in it are no more than props for the magnified insects. I doubt if it will fool anyone. But youngsters will probably think it's great stuff.\"<ref name=\"TineeWild\" /> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was far harsher in its assessment. Its unsigned review concluded: \"The audience is cheated in the production. The conclusion is never in doubt and the process shots are so obvious that one is startled the first time a buffalo-sized grasshopper hits the screen but never again. And at no time are there more than a half-dozen of the things shown at once, although the script avers that there are thousands about and more coming.\"<ref name=\"Oversized\" /> As of 2008, ''Beginning of the End'' is still \"one of the most excoriated creature features.\"<ref name=\"Schoell53\">Schoell, ''Creature Features: Nature Turned Nasty in the Movies,'' 2008, p. 53.</ref> [[Leonard Maltin]] summed up his review in one word: \"awful\".<ref name=\"Maltin105\" /> Another recent film guide called it \"Bottom-of-the-sci-fi-barrel rubbish, very boring to watch.\"<ref name=\"Halliwell92\">Halliwell and Walker, ''Halliwell's Film Guide,'' 1994, p. 92.</ref> One review pointed out that Gordon didn't even bother to hide the mountains in the background of the shots (Central Illinois is mostly flat prairie land).<ref>Nagro, \"Bugshow,\" ''Pest Control Technology,'' July 27, 2010.</ref> Some have also been upset with film's lack of horrifying images.<ref name=\"Schoell54\">Schoell, ''Creature Features: Nature Turned Nasty in the Movies,'' 2008, p. 54.</ref> The derivative nature of the picture has also upset some critics. Critics say the film covered almost the same ground as the far superior monster movie ''Them!'',<ref name=\"Derry\" /> and it is clear that Gordon merely wanted to \"cash in\" on giant bug craze rather than come up with a story that was fresh and creative.<ref name=\"Fischer242\" />\n\nThere have been some positive reviews, however. One modern critic said \"the story is adequately paced, the acting is engaging, and we still get a thrill seeing the Army guys empty their cartridges at the unstoppable insects.\"<ref name=\"Pratt104\" /> Another modern reviewer found the screenplay effective, especially the beginning: \"As in ''[[The Deadly Mantis|Deadly Mantis]]'', the ''complete'' disappearance of the victims is especially chilling, as is the notion of 150 men, women and children being devoured overnight while in their beds. This aspect is like something out of [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraft]], although it is not exploited as well as it could have been.\"<ref name=\"Schoell54\" /> Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: \"The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they're na\u00efve and go to get scared, or they're sophisticated and enjoy scoffing at the pictures. There isn't much a teenager can scoff at these days, you know.\"<ref name=\"Bright\" /> Lead actor Peter Graves also felt the film worked on a certain level. \"I think they played OK. ... All of that was ludicrous, but there were a certain amount of people who 'bought' it and loved it.\"<ref name=\"Weaver145\" />\n\n''Beginning of the End'' has become somewhat infamous because of its notoriously poor production values and unrealistic plot.
