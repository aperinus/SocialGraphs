It was directed by [[Franc Roddam]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|feature directing d\u00e9but]]. Unlike the [[Tommy (1975 film)|adaptation]] of ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', ''Quadrophenia'' is not a [[musical film]], and the band does not appear live in the film.\n\nThe film is set in London in 1964, a time when the working class youth broadly aligned themselves with one of two factions, who frequently fought each other. The [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]] wore sharp suits, listened to current pop and soul music, took [[amphetamines]], and rode [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]]. [[Rocker (subculture)|Rockers]] rode powerful British motorcycles such as [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] and [[BSA motorcycles|BSA]], wore black leather jackets and listened to 1950s rock'n'roll.\n\nThe film stars [[Phil Daniels]] as Jimmy, a young mod who escapes from his dead-end job as a [[Internal mail|mailroom boy]] by dancing, partying, taking [[amphetamine]]s, riding his scooter and brawling with Rockers. After he and his friends participate in a huge brawl with the Rockers at the seaside town of [[Brighton]], he is arrested and his life starts to spiral out of control; he loses his love interest ([[Leslie Ash]]), gets kicked out of his house by his parents, and discovers that his idol, the popular mod nicknamed \"Ace Face\" ([[Sting (musician)|Sting]]), is actually a [[bellboy]] at a hotel.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1964, young London Mod Jimmy Cooper ([[Phil Daniels]]), disillusioned with his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, vents his teenage [[angst]] by taking amphetamines, partying, riding [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]s and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave ([[Mark Wingett]]), Chalky ([[Phil Davis (actor)|Philip Davis]]) and Spider ([[Gary Shail]]).\n\nAn attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliatory attack on Jimmy's childhood friend Kevin ([[Ray Winstone]]), one of the rival Rockers. Jimmy initially participates, but upon realising the victim is Kevin, he berates the other attackers but does not stop them, instead riding away on his scooter revving his engine loudly in frustration.\n\nA planned [[bank holiday]] weekend away provides the excuse for the rivalry between [[Mods and Rockers]] to escalate, as both groups descend upon the seaside town of [[Brighton]]. Jimmy plans to be noticed as a 'face', and hints to Steph ([[Leslie Ash]])&nbsp;\u2013 a girl on whom he has a crush&nbsp;\u2013 that he would like her to ride with him, but she confirms plans to ride instead with Pete ([[Garry Cooper]]), an older, [[wikt:well-heeled|well-heeled]] Mod.\n\nTo prepare for the weekend, the pals try to buy some recreational drugs from London gangster Harry North ([[John Bindon]]), but are cheated with fake pills. After vandalising the drug-seller's car in retaliation, they desperately rob a [[pharmacy]], finding a large quantity of their favourite \"[[Dexamyl|blues]]\".\n\nAfter an early morning group ride from London to the south coast, the friends gather on the seafront, where Jimmy first sees a flamboyant scooter-riding Mod he describes as ''Ace Face'' ([[Sting (musician)|Sting]]). Later in a dance hall, Jimmy suggests that he will help Steph, whose escort is now chatting to an attractive American girl, to dance with Ace Face, but on the dance floor ushers her away to dance with himself. Steph leaves Jimmy to dance with Ace Face, whereupon Jimmy plots to gain attention by climbing up on to the balcony-edge and dancing with much applause, annoying Ace Face. After [[stage diving|diving]] into the audience, Jimmy is ejected by [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]]. Steph's escort leaves with the American girl, and once again Jimmy tries to get with Steph, this time for the night, but she has arranged accommodation with a female friend.\n\nThe lads spend the night sleeping rough, meet up at a [[Cafe (British)|cafe]] on the following morning, then proceed along the [[promenade]], where a series of running battles ensue. As the police corner the [[rioters]], Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph, and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves amidst the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested and detained with the volatile Ace Face. When fined a hefty \u00a375, {{Inflation|UK|75|1964|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}, Ace Face mocks the magistrate ([[John Phillips (actor)|John Phillips]]) by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, amusing the fellow Mods.\n\nBack in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. His mother throws him out after finding his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and learns that Steph is now his friend Dave's girlfriend. After briefly fighting with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph, and his beloved [[Lambretta Li Special|Lambretta]] scooter is accidentally damaged in a crash involving a [[Royal Mail]] parcel van. Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton, taking increasing levels of pills and becoming more [[amphetamine psychosis|emotionally unstable]].\n\nAttempting to relive the recent excitement, he revisits the scenes of the riots and his encounter with Steph. Then, Jimmy horrifyingly discovers that his idol, Ace Face, has a menial job as a [[Bellhop|bellboy]] at the [[Grand Brighton Hotel]]. Jimmy steals Ace's [[Vespa]] scooter and heads out to [[Beachy Head]], riding close to the cliff-edge. Finally, the scooter is seen crashing over the cliff-top, which is where the film begins with Jimmy walking back against a sunset backdrop.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Phil Daniels]] as Jimmy Cooper\n* [[Leslie Ash]] as Steph\n* [[Phil Davis (actor)|Philip Davis]] as Chalky\n* [[Mark Wingett]] as Dave\n* [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] as Ace Face\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as Kevin Herriot, Jimmy's childhood friend\n* [[Gary Shail]] as Spider\n* [[Garry Cooper]] as Peter Fenton, Steph's boyfriend\n* [[Toyah Willcox]] as Monkey\n* [[Trevor Laird]] as Ferdy\n* Andy Sayce as Kenny\n* [[Kate Williams (actress)|Kate Williams]] as Mrs Cooper, Jimmy's mother\n* [[Michael Elphick]] as Mr George Cooper, Jimmy's father\n* Kim Neve as Yvonne Cooper, Jimmy's sister\n* [[Benjamin Whitrow]] as Mr Fulford, Jimmy's employer\n* [[Daniel Peacock]] as Danny\n* [[Jeremy Child]] as Agency Man\n* [[John Phillips (actor)|John Phillips]] as Magistrate\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Harry the Projectionist\n* [[Patrick Murray (actor)|Patrick Murray]] as Des the projectionist assistant\n* [[George Innes]] as Cafe Owner\n* [[John Bindon]] as Harry North, gangster\n* [[P.
