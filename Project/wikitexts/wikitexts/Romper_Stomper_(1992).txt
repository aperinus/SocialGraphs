The film stars [[Russell Crowe]], [[Daniel Pollock]], [[Jacqueline McKenzie]], [[Tony Le-Nguyen]] and Colin Chin. The film tells the story of the exploits and downfall of a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group in [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] suburban [[Melbourne]].  The film was released on 12 November 1992.\n\n==Plot==\nA gang of violent young [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[White power skinhead|skinheads]] from [[Footscray, Victoria]], Australia attack three [[Vietnamese Australians|Vietnamese Australian]] teenagers in a tunnel at [[Footscray railway station|Footscray Station]], brutally beating two of them. The gang is led by Hando, a violent, reckless, and unpredictable [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] with strong [[white nationalist]] beliefs and homicidal tendencies, with his friend and second-in-command, the quiet, reserved, but similarly violent Davey. At their local pub, Hando and Davey meet Gabrielle, who suffers from random [[seizures]], the day after her sexually abusive, affluent father Martin has her junkie boyfriend arrested. Gabrielle begins a romantic relationship with Hando, which, despite a strong start, quickly becomes dysfunctional as he becomes increasingly abusive towards her.\n\nAfter the gang vandalizes a [[shopping mall]], friends of the gang visit from [[Canberra]], one of whom has joined the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. A party at the warehouse follows. The next day two boys go to the pub, which has just been sold to a Vietnamese businessman by the owner. Upon seeing the new owner and his sons, they inform Hando, who arrives with his gang, and they savagely beat two of the new owner's sons, while the third son escapes and calls for help. Fed up with the gang's antagonism and violence, a large mob of armed and angry Vietnamese men, led by Tiger, arrive and descend upon the skinheads. The Vietnamese outnumber the skinheads by droves, and in the ensuing brawl and chase, several skinheads are beaten by the angry mob, among them Magoo, Luke, Champ, and Brent. The rest of the gang is chased back to their rented warehouse, from which they narrowly escape as the Vietnamese mob breaks in and ransacks the building before [[Arson|burning it down]].\n\nThe skinheads soon find a new base at a nearby warehouse, after evicting a pair of squatters, and plan retaliation against the Vietnamese. When the gang agrees to acquire firearms, two female friends of the gang depart in disgust. Gabrielle suggests the gang burgle her father's mansion for the guns. After beating and tying up Martin, the gang ransacks the house, smashes one of his cars, and raids his wine collection. The youngest skinhead, Bubs, steals a deactivated revolver from the house during the burglary. Gabrielle tells Martin the burglary is revenge for his years of abuse, then reveals to Davey her plan to take Hando away from his violent life. Martin eventually frees himself and uses a handgun to scare away the gang, who flee in the trashed vehicle and leave behind most of the stolen goods. Due to this incident, Davey begins to question his violent lifestyle.\n\nAgitated by Gabrielle's criticism of the poor outcome of the robbery and their living conditions, Hando abruptly hits, berates, dumps, and then evicts her. Davey, unable to tolerate the excess violence and Hando's cruel and unpredictable nature any further, declares his departure from the gang and gives Gabrielle his German grandmother's address, where he will be staying. Gabrielle informs the police of the gang's location and spends the night with Davey, where they confess their feelings for each other. Davey also reveals his doubts about his violent lifestyle to Gabrielle, having removed the racist patches from his [[flight jacket]] out of concern for his grandmother.\n\nThe morning after, the police raid the warehouse where the skinhead gang is hiding. Bubs is shot in the head after pointing the stolen deactivated gun at the police, and what remains of the gang is beaten and arrested. Hando, who was returning to the warehouse and fled when he spotted the police, successfully evades capture as the last remaining member of his gang.\n\nArriving at Davey's granny-flat, Hando finds his friend in bed with Gabrielle. Hando accuses her of informing the police, but Davey says they were together the whole time since leaving the squat. However, Hando convinces Davey and Gabrielle to come with him by claiming the police will soon raid the residence, and the trio go on the run. They rob a service station, where Hando strangles the Asian attendant to death; and, after driving all night, they stop at [[Point Addis Marine National Park|Point Addis]], [[Bells Beach, Victoria|Bells Beach]] the next morning. There, Gabrielle overhears a conversation wherein Hando tries to convince Davey to abandon her. Feeling betrayed, Gabrielle sets their car on fire and admits to tipping the police off about the gang's whereabouts. Hando, infuriated beyond sense, immediately attacks her and attempts to [[Asphyxiation|asphyxiate]] her multiple times, first by strangling her and then by drowning her in the surf. Davey attempts to fight Hando several times and successfully disrupts each attempt on Gabrielle's life, but he is quickly fought off and beaten down each time. Eventually, Hando attempts to smother Gabrielle in the sand, before Davey, desperate to save Gabrielle, stabs Hando in the neck with his [[Hitler Youth]] knife, who staggers away before finally collapsing. As a busload of Japanese tourists looks on, a weeping Davey attempts to comfort a petrified Gabrielle as Hando's corpse gazes lifelessly out at the ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Hando\n* [[Daniel Pollock]] as Davey\n* [[Jacqueline McKenzie]] as Gabrielle\n* [[Tony Le-Nguyen]] (credited as Tony Lee) as Tiger\n* [[Alex Scott (actor)|Alex Scott]] as Martin\n* Leigh Russell as Sonny Jim\n* [[Daniel Wyllie|Dan Wyllie]] as Cackles\n* James McKenna as Bubs\n* Eric Mueck as Champ\n* Frank Magree as Brent\n* Christopher McLean as Luke\n* [[John Brumpton]] as Magoo\n* Colin Chin as Japanese Extra 1\n\n==Origin==\n[[Geoffrey Wright]]'s script was inspired by the highly publicised crimes of leading Melbourne Neo-Nazi Dane Sweetman.<ref>{{cite news|title= FILM / Close to the knuckle: Romper Stomper, an Australian film about violent boneheads, has been condemned as likely to cause a breach of the peace.

The interview could not be arranged in a timely manner due to prison regulations, so the two men commenced correspondence, and Sweetman furnished Wright with a transcript of his murder trial, from which Wright drew influence. This influence is most clearly seen in the line delivered by Hando when scaring off squatters from the warehouse: \"I'll chop your legs off\". It is a direct reference to Sweetman's having cut off the legs of his victim.\n\nThat was one of many aspects of the film that mirrored Sweetman's life. A further example is that the characters Gabrielle, Davey, and the punk girls were all based on associates of Sweetman. Sweetman's name was conspicuously absent in the end credits, however. This issue was raised in the Australian media during the publicity phase of promoting the film. Russell Crowe acknowledged the origin of his character during an interview on'' Tonight Live ''with Steve Vizard in 1992. Wright has also cited Sweetman as an inspiration for the film's characters.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2012-10-02 |title=Exclusive Interview: Geoffrey Wright on 20th Anniversary of Romper Stomper |url=https://thereelbits.com/2012/10/02/exclusive-interview-geoffrey-wright-on-20th-anniversary-of-romper-stomper/ |access-date=2022-08-01 |website=The Reel Bits |language=en-AU}}</ref>\n\nThe film was financed by the [[Australian Film Commission]] with [[Film Victoria]].<ref name=\"eva\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Romper Stomper\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[John Clifford White]] and the Romper Stomper Orchestra & Band\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 30 November 1992\n| recorded   = 1991\u20131992\n| venue      =\n| studio     = [[Metropolis Group|Metropolis Studios]]\n| genre      = [[Film score]], [[Rock Against Communism]]\n| length     = 34:33\n| label      = Picture This\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe [[soundtrack|film's score]] was released by Picture This Records.

The band is also often called \"Master Race\" due to Peter Pales's German-language monologue in the beginning of \"Pulling on the Boots\". Some people have also considered the Australian punk band the [[Bastard Squad]] to have done the soundtrack, due to the line \"Jason from the Bastard Squad\" being in the thank you section at the movie's end credits.
