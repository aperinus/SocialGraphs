Television]] commissioned the series for production in May 1993, as part of its [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] (PTEN); the first season would premiere in the [[United States]] nearly a year later, on January 26, 1994.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{Babylon 5 TV seasons and films}}\n{{original research section|date=December 2018}}\nIn the Earth year 2257, a multitude of humans and non-humans gather deep in neutral space at a new station, ''[[Babylon 5 (fictional space station)|Babylon 5]]'', which has recently become operational. ''Babylon 5'' was built as a neutral venue for discussing and resolving issues between the five major spacefaring races of the galaxy, the [[Human (Babylon 5)|humans]], [[Narn]], [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]], [[Minbari]], and [[Vorlon]]s. Commander [[Jeffrey Sinclair]] is in overall charge of the station.\n\nAs the crew awaits the arrival of the fourth and final alien ambassador, Ambassador [[Kosh Naranek|Kosh]] from the Vorlon Empire, a transport ship arrives from Earth, bearing [[Lyta Alexander]], a human telepath who joins the station crew, and Del Varner, a civilian. Ambassador Kosh arrives two days ahead of schedule, and is on board the station less than a minute when he suddenly falls ill, apparently from poisoning. ''Babylon 5''{{'s}} chief medical officer, [[Benjamin Kyle (Babylon 5)|Dr. Kyle]], conducts a medical investigation and seeks to prevent Kosh's death, while Security Chief [[Michael Garibaldi]] conducts a security investigation. Worried that, if Kosh dies, the Vorlons will attack and destroy the station, Dr. Kyle and [[Laurel Takashima|Lt. Cmdr. Takashima]] persuade Lyta to perform an unauthorized mind scan on the unconscious Kosh. As she conducts the scan, Lyta sees Commander Sinclair poisoning the Ambassador. Lyta accuses Sinclair of attempted murder. A meeting of ''Babylon 5''{{'}}s Council, made up of delegates from all five races, resolves to extradite the Commander to the Vorlon homeworld for trial. Sinclair is told that he will be deported in twelve hours.\n\nGaribaldi comes to suspect Del Varner might have been involved in Kosh's poisoning. When he enters Varner's quarters, however, he discovers Varner dead in a fish tank. Lyta enters the medical lab, where she begins adjusting some of the settings that are keeping Kosh alive; when Dr. Kyle realizes what she's doing, he tries to stop her, and she attacks him. At that moment, the real Lyta Alexander enters the room; her double escapes.\n\nUpon further investigation in Varner's quarters, Garibaldi learns that Varner had been smuggling illegal items between systems, and that he most recently had gone to the Antares sector to acquire a [[changeling]] net: a device that can make an individual appear to look like somebody else. The crew realizes that Kosh had not been poisoned by Sinclair when he arrived at the station, but by someone using the changeling net to imitate Sinclair. Since the use of such a device would put out a lot of energy, Takashima uses the station's scanners to pinpoint an area of the station with a high concentration of unidentified energy use. Sinclair and Garibaldi head for that part of the station, just as a Vorlon squadron arrives in the vicinity of the station to pick up Sinclair for his voyage to the Vorlon homeworld.\n\nSinclair and Garibaldi confront the mysterious assailant. Garibaldi is injured in the firefight and Sinclair faces the assassin himself. The changeling net is disabled, revealing the assailant to be a Minbari assassin. The assassin is a member of the Minbari warrior caste and wanted to discredit Sinclair as retribution for Sinclair's role in the [[Earth\u2013Minbari War]] ten years earlier. Sinclair asks the assassin why he did it; the assassin replies simply, \"There is a hole in your mind.\" Sinclair, being informed that the assassin has triggered an explosive charge, manages to get away just before an explosion rips a hole in the station's hull, throwing the station off its axis and beginning to tear it apart from the inside. Takashima uses the station's stabilizers to reestablish its axis.\n\nThe Vorlon delegation, now satisfied that Sinclair is innocent, drops all charges against him. In the station's garden, Sinclair reveals to [[Delenn]] what the Minbari assassin had said about the \"hole\" in Sinclair's mind. Delenn claims that it is just an old Minbari insult. Sinclair, however, tells her that he had fought in the climactic battle of the Earth\u2013Minbari War, and that there is a twenty-four-hour period in the climactic battle, just before the Minbari surrendered, which he can't account for.\n\nTakashima declares Babylon 5 open and operational.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael O'Hare]] - Cmdr.

The original version was a TV movie aired in 1993 on the [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] as a pilot for the series. After a four-year run on PTEN, ''Babylon 5'' moved to [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|Turner Network Television (TNT)]] for its fifth and final season in 1998. Series creator and executive producer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] supervised a [[special edition]] of ''Babylon 5: The Gathering'', which aired on TNT immediately following the new TV movie, ''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning]]''. Scenes were edited to move at a faster pace, allowing the restoration of 14 minutes of footage adding exposition and character development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/000.html|title=\"The Gathering\" at midwinter.com|access-date=October 6, 2014|archive-date=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021161654/http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/000.html|url-status=live}}</ref>  Among the notable additions is a prophetic line spoken by Kosh when he first meets Sinclair. Lost in the special edition is a trip through the station's alien sector that some viewers felt looked too much like a zoo. Tamlyn Tomita's lines had been completely redubbed as the studio thought she sounded too \"harsh\"; the new edition restored her original performance. The original music, composed by [[Stewart Copeland]], is also replaced with a score by [[Christopher Franke]], who composed music for the rest of the series, played by the [[Berliner Symphoniker]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe special edition is included in the [[Warner Home Video]] DVD releases ''Babylon 5: The Gathering/In the Beginning'' and ''Babylon 5: The Movie Collection''. The original version was previously available on [[AOL]]'s now-defunct [[In2TV]] service, and [[Hulu]], but is no longer available on either as of April 2014. The [[iTunes Store]] appears to carry the special edition as part of its Season 1 bundle, but not the original. The date listed is the original air date, but it opens with \"TNT Presents a Special Edition of...\", and the run time is 1h35m. The original is available for streaming on Amazon.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe original version was released on DVD by Warner Home Video in Region 2. In Germany, it had the title \"Spacecenter Babylon 5 - Die Zusammenkunft.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Spacecenter-Babylon-5-Die-Zusammenkunft/dp/B00007JWKK|title=Spacecenter Babylon 5 - Die Zusammenkunft|via=Amazon|access-date=February 22, 2017|archive-date=March 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312193637/http://www.amazon.de/Spacecenter-Babylon-5-Die-Zusammenkunft/dp/B00007JWKK|url-status=live}}</ref>  It is also included in the \"Complete Collection\" and \"Ultimate Collection\" box sets (released in the UK only).{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Changes between pilot and series==\nMany elements of the pilot were changed when the series began, giving the pilot a different feel than the rest of the series. This was most evident in the prosthetics, sets, music, and cast members. [[Patricia Tallman]] played [[Lyta Alexander]]&nbsp;\u2013 she was replaced by [[Andrea Thompson]] as [[Talia Winters]]&nbsp;\u2013 but Tallman (as Alexander) would return later in the series, first as a recurring character and then as a regular. The medical officer was Dr. [[Benjamin Kyle (Babylon 5)|Benjamin Kyle]] (played by [[Johnny Sekka]]), rather than [[Richard Biggs]] as [[Stephen Franklin (Babylon 5)|Stephen Franklin]]. The explanation used for these cast changes is that these two characters saw [[Kosh Naranek|Kosh]] outside his encounter suit and thus had to be removed from duty&nbsp;\u2013 Kosh's secrecy is a running theme in the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/misc/lost-scenes.html#kosh|title=\"Lost Scenes\" at midwinter.com|access-date=October 31, 2020|archive-date=November 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108063246/http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/misc/lost-scenes.html#kosh|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe first officer was [[Laurel Takashima]] (played by [[Tamlyn Tomita]]), replaced for the series by [[Claudia Christian]] as [[Susan Ivanova]]. The alien characters&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Delenn]] and [[G'Kar]]&nbsp;\u2013 appeared slightly different because the prosthetics were different for the pilot than the series. Also, Delenn was originally supposed to be a male character destined to become female at the end of season 1, but since they could not make Mira Furlan's voice male enough, they decided to play her as female throughout the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/024.html|title=\"Revelations\" at midwinter.com|access-date=October 31, 2020|archive-date=November 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112000338/http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/guide/024.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the Command and Control center is Ed Wasser (as Guerra), in the series Wasser will return as [[List of Babylon 5 characters#Morden|Morden]].\n\nSinclair's love interest (Carolyn Sykes) is replaced by [[List of Babylon 5 characters#Catherine Sakai|Catherine Sakai]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0106336|Babylon 5: The Gathering}}\n* {{Amg movie|147608|Babylon 5: The Gathering}}\n\n{{Babylon 5}}\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Babylon 5 films|Gathering]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:1993 television films]]\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 23rd century]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stewart Copeland]]\n[[Category:American science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Christopher Franke]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Compton]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n[[ru:\u0412\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0438 (\u0412\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043d-5)]]"}]}}}}
