It stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Lea Thompson]], [[Crispin Glover]], and [[Thomas F. Wilson]]. Set in 1985, the story follows [[Marty McFly]] (Fox), a teenager accidentally sent back to 1955 in a [[DeLorean time machine|time-traveling DeLorean automobile]] built by his eccentric scientist friend [[Emmett Brown|Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]] (Lloyd). While in the past, Marty inadvertently prevents his future parents from falling in love\u2014threatening his existence\u2014and is forced to reconcile the pair and somehow get back to the future.\n\nGale and Zemeckis conceived the idea for ''Back to the Future'' in 1980. They were desperate for a successful film after numerous collaborative failures, but the project was rejected over 40 times by various studios because it was not considered raunchy enough to compete with the successful comedies of the era. A development deal was secured with [[Universal Pictures]] following Zemeckis's success directing ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' (1984). Fox was the first choice to portray Marty but was unavailable; [[Eric Stoltz]] was cast instead. Shortly after [[principal photography]] began in November 1984, Zemeckis determined Stoltz was not right for the part and made the concessions necessary to hire Fox, including re-filming scenes already shot with Stoltz and adding $4{{nbsp}}million to the budget. ''Back to the Future'' was filmed in and around California and on sets at [[Universal Studios]]. Filming concluded the following April.\n\nFollowing highly successful test screenings, the release date was brought forward to July{{nbsp}}3, 1985, giving ''Back to the Future'' more time in theaters during the busiest period of the theatrical year. The change resulted in a rushed post-production schedule and some incomplete special effects. ''Back to the Future'' was a critical and commercial success, earning $381.1{{nbsp}}million to become the [[1985 in film|highest-grossing film of 1985]] worldwide. [[Film criticism|Critics]] praised the story, humorous elements, and the cast\u2014particularly Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. It received multiple award nominations and won an [[58th Academy Awards|Academy Award]], three [[13th Saturn Awards|Saturn Awards]], and a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Hugo Award]]. Its theme song, \"[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]\" by [[Huey Lewis and the News]], was also a success.\n\n''Back to the Future'' has since grown in esteem and is now considered by critics and audiences to be one of the greatest science-fiction films and among the [[List of films considered the best|best films ever made]]. In 2007, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected the film for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. The film was followed by two sequels, ''[[Back to the Future Part&nbsp;II]]'' (1989) and ''[[Back to the Future Part&nbsp;III]]'' (1990). Spurred by the film's dedicated fan following and effect on popular culture, Universal Studios launched a [[Back to the Future (franchise)|multimedia franchise]], which now includes [[List of Back to the Future video games|video games]], [[Back to the Future: The Ride|theme park rides]], an [[Back to the Future (TV series)|animated television series]], and a [[Back to the Future: The Musical|stage musical]]. Its enduring popularity has prompted numerous books about its production, documentaries, and commercials.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1985, teenager [[Marty McFly]] lives in [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley, California]], with his depressed alcoholic mother, [[Lorraine Baines-McFly|Lorraine]]; his older siblings, who are professional and social failures; and his meek father, [[George McFly|George]], who is bullied by his supervisor, [[Biff Tannen]]. After Marty's band is rejected from a music audition, he confides in his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, that he fears becoming like his parents despite his ambitions.\n\nThat night, Marty meets his eccentric scientist friend, [[Emmett Brown|Emmett \"Doc\" Brown]], in the [[Twin Pines Mall|Twin Pines mall]] parking lot. Doc unveils a [[DeLorean time machine|time machine built from a modified DeLorean]], powered by [[plutonium]] he swindled from Libyan terrorists. After Doc inputs a destination time of November{{nbsp}}5, 1955\u2014the day he first conceived his time travel invention\u2014the terrorists arrive unexpectedly and gun Doc down. Marty flees in the DeLorean, inadvertently activating time travel when he reaches {{convert|88|mph}}.\n\nArriving in 1955, Marty discovers he has no plutonium to return. While exploring a burgeoning Hill Valley, Marty encounters his teenage father and discovers Biff was bullying George even then. George falls into the path of an oncoming car while [[Voyeurism|spying]] on the teenage Lorraine changing clothes, and Marty is knocked unconscious while saving him. He wakes to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him. Marty tracks down and convinces a younger Doc that he is from the future, but Doc explains the only source available in 1955 capable of generating the power required for time travel is a lightning bolt. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that documents an upcoming lightning strike at the town's courthouse. As Marty's siblings begin to fade from a photo he is carrying with him, Doc realizes Marty's actions are [[Temporal paradox|altering the future]] and jeopardizing his existence; Lorraine was supposed to tend to George instead of Marty after the car accident. Early attempts to get his parents acquainted fail, and Lorraine's infatuation with Marty deepens.\n\nLorraine asks Marty to the school dance, and he plots to feign inappropriate advances on her, allowing George to intervene and \"rescue\" her, but the plan goes awry when Biff's gang locks Marty in the trunk of the performing band's car, while Biff forces himself onto Lorraine. George arrives expecting to find Marty but is assaulted by Biff. After Biff hurts Lorraine, an enraged George knocks him unconscious and escorts the grateful Lorraine to the dance. The band frees Marty from their car, but the lead guitarist injures his hand in the process, and Marty takes his place, performing while George and Lorraine share their first kiss. With his future no longer in jeopardy, Marty heads to the courthouse to meet Doc.\n\nDoc discovers a letter from Marty warning him about his future and destroys it, worried about the consequences. To save Doc, Marty re-calibrates the DeLorean to return ten minutes before he left the future. The lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985, but the DeLorean breaks down, forcing Marty to run back to the mall. He arrives as Doc is being shot. While Marty grieves at his side, Doc sits up, revealing he pieced Marty's note back together and wore a bulletproof vest. He takes Marty home and departs to 2015 in the DeLorean. Marty wakes the next morning to discover his father is now a confident and successful [[science fiction]] author, his mother is fit and happy, his siblings are successful, and Biff is a servile valet in George's employ. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc suddenly reappears in the DeLorean, insisting they return with him to the future to save their children from terrible fates.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Back to the Future Part&nbsp;II]]'' (1989).}}\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Back to the Future characters|l1=List of ''Back to the Future'' characters}}\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | footer = [[Michael J.

He did not think so but realized he could test his theory if he could travel back to a time when he and his parents were a similar age.<ref name=\"NYTimesGaleJul85\" /> He shared the idea with Zemeckis, who recalled his mother's childhood stories were often contradictory.<ref name=\"HFPAOralHistory\" />\n\nGale and Zemeckis began a draft in late 1980. They sketched and acted out each scene to help develop the dialogue and actions.<ref name=\"NYTimesGaleJul85\" /> They believed many time travel films focused on the past being immutable and wanted to show the past being altered and the impact those changes would have on the future.<ref name=\"HFPAOralHistory\" /> In the draft, [[Copyright infringement|video pirate]] Professor Brown builds a time machine that sends his young friend Marty back to the 1950s where he interrupts his parents' first meeting.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=12}} In September 1980, Gale and Zemeckis pitched their idea to [[Columbia Pictures]] president [[Frank Price]], who had liked ''Used Cars'' and was keen to work with the pair. Gale recalled having to rein in Zemeckis' enthusiastic pitch before Price had time to change his mind.<ref name=\"EsquireDidntGetMade\" /> Gale and Zemeckis completed the first draft for Price on February{{nbsp}}21, 1981, but Price believed it needed significant refinement.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=12}}\n\nSome early concepts were abandoned. Originally, Marty's actions in 1955 had a more significant impact on the future, making 1985 more futuristic and advanced, but every person who read the script took issue with the idea.<ref name=\"BOMGaleInterview\" /><ref name=\"TheGuardianHowWeMade\" /> Marty's father also became a boxer, a result of his knockout punch on Biff.<ref name=\"TheGuardianHowWeMade\" /> The time machine was a stationary object moved around on the back of a truck.<ref name=\"ShortlistDudley\" /><ref name=\"TheGuardianHowWeMade\" /><ref name=\"SlashFilmFridge\" /> Inspired by the documentary ''[[The Atomic Cafe]]'', the drained time machine was written to be powered by Marty driving it into a nuclear explosion, combined with an additional ingredient\u2014[[Coca-Cola]].{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:<ref name=\"TheGuardianHowWeMade\" /><ref name=\"SlashFilmFridge\" /><ref name=\"Cryer\" /><ref name=\"ColliderDifferences2020\" />}} Gale and Zemeckis took inspiration from tales of legendary scientists, opting to make the time machine's creator an individual instead of a faceless corporation or government.<ref name=\"BOMGaleInterview\" /> The pair wanted the inciting time travel incident to be an accident so that it would not appear that the hero was seeking personal gain.<ref name=\"TheGuardianHowWeMade\" />\n\nGale and Zemeckis drew humor from the cultural contrasts between 1955 and 1985, such as Marty entering a 1955 soda shop while wearing 1985 clothing. The shop owner asks Marty if he is a sailor because his down vest resembles a [[Personal flotation device#Life jacket|life preserver]]. They also identified conveniences of 1985 that Marty had taken for granted, but would be denied in 1955. Gale and Zemeckis struggled as they were in their 30s and did not particularly self-identify with either era.<ref name=\"NYTimesGaleJul85\" /> They were inspired by the [[All-American]] aesthetic of films by [[Frank Capra]] featuring [[Picket fence|white picket fences]] and exaggerated characters like Biff,<ref name=\"ShortList\" /> ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', science-fiction films, and books by [[Robert Silverberg]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]].<ref name=\"CNNGaleInterview\" /> The romantic relationship between 1955 Lorraine and her future son was one of the more difficult writing challenges.<ref name=\"NYTimesJun1985AttheMovies\" /> Gale and Zemeckis attempted to take the concept as far as possible to keep the audience on edge. They believed it had to be Lorraine who stopped the relationship; she remarks that kissing Marty feels like kissing her brother. Gale jokingly said no one asked how she could make that comparison, but that audiences would accept it because they did not want the relationship to happen.<ref name=\"EsquireDidntGetMade\" /> The second draft was completed by April{{nbsp}}7, 1981.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=12}}\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Ready Player One Japan Premiere Red Carpet Steven Spielberg (26737406037) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Steven Spielberg shown talking into a microphone |[[Steven Spielberg]] in 2018.

Price's successor at Columbia Pictures, [[Guy McElwaine]], was developing a satire of the Universal-owned noir film ''[[Double Indemnity]]'' (1944) called ''[[Big Trouble (1986 film)|Big Trouble]]'' (1986). Its similarities to ''Double Indemnity'' meant the studio would violate Universal Pictures' copyright. With production imminent, McElwaine asked for the rights from Price; in exchange, Price obtained the rights to ''Back to the Future''.<ref name=\"DeadlinePrice\" />\n\nSheinberg suggested modifications to the film including changing the title to ''Space Man from Pluto'', believing ''Back to the Future'' would not resonate with audiences.<ref name=\"CNNGaleInterview\" /><ref name=\"Radio Times 30 August 2016\" /> Gale and Zemeckis did not know how to reject Sheinberg's suggestions without risking his ire. Spielberg intervened, sending Sheinberg a memo reading: \"Hi Sid, thanks for your most humorous memo, we all got a big laugh out of it, keep 'em coming.\" Spielberg knew Sheinberg would be too embarrassed to admit his memo was to be taken seriously.<ref name=\"ShortList\" /><ref name=\"Radio Times 30 August 2016\" /> Sheinberg later claimed the story was \"bullshit\".{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=111}} Sheinberg also wanted to change the name of Marty's mother from Meg to Lorraine (a tribute to his wife [[Lorraine Gary]]), and rename Professor Brown to Doc Brown because he considered it more accessible.<ref name=\"CNNGaleInterview\" />{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=18}} The third draft was completed by July 1984.{{sfn|Gaines|2015|p=18}} The lengthy development allowed Gale and Zemeckis to refine the script's jokes, especially ones that had become dated since 1980.<ref name=\"NYTimesGaleJul85\" /> The joke about former actor [[Ronald Reagan]] becoming [[president of the United States]] remained following his re-election in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]].<ref name=\"NYTimesGaleJul85\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:Dutchedstoltz.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt= Portrait of Eric Stoltz |[[Eric Stoltz]] (pictured in 2012) was cast as Marty McFly and spent several weeks filming ''Back to the Future'' before the role was re-cast.]]\nMichael J.

Special effects artist [[Ken Chase (make-up artist)|Ken Chase]] performed make-up tests on the young actors to age them; initial results were discouraging. He created a prosthetic neck and a [[bald cap]] with a receding hairline for Glover, but considered them excessive. Chase found it difficult to balance aging the actors while retaining enough of their natural appearance so they remained recognizable.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=56}}\n\nCasts were made of the actors' faces, from which plaster molds were made. Chase sculpted more subtle effects over the plaster molds using latex. For Lorraine, he crafted jowls and eye bags, plus body padding to reflect her increased weight and alcohol abuse.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|pp=56, 59}} Instead of a receding hairline, Chase only changed the style of George's hair and used prosthetics to give him a less-defined jawline.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=59}} Biff's character changed more significantly because Chase wanted him to look \"obnoxious\"; he was fattened, given sideburns, and a [[comb over]] hairstyle to hide a growing bald spot.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=59}} The prosthetics were combined with makeup and lighting to further age the characters.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=56}}\n\nChase found the work frustrating compared to his experiences with more fantastical prostheses that made it easier to hide defects.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=56}} The rubber latex did not reflect light the same way as natural skin, so Chase used a [[stippling]] process\u2014creating a pattern with small dots\u2014to variegate the actors' faces to better conceal where the skin and prosthetics met;{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=59}} close-up shots were avoided.{{sfn|Pourro|1985|p=59}} Doc's appearance was not altered significantly.

The summer period (beginning the final week of May) had 45 films scheduled for release, including ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part&nbsp;II]]'', ''The Goonies'', ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'', ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'', and the latest [[James Bond]] film ''[[A View to a Kill]]''.<ref name=\"NYTimes1985June11\" /> This 25% increase over the previous year's releases led to concerns among industry professionals the competition would divide audiences and limit financial returns, at a time when the average cost of making and marketing a film had increased to $14.5{{nbsp}}million and $7{{nbsp}}million, respectively.<ref name=\"NYTimes1985June11\" /> A higher budget to secure a popular, and thus profitable, cast was considered a suitable risk.<ref name=\"NYTimes1985June11\" /> Most films scheduled for release were aimed at younger audiences, focusing on fantasy and the supernatural.

The Hill Valley of 1985 is depicted as run down and in decay, while in 1955 it is presented as a more simplistic and seemingly safer time, seen through a nostalgic lens.<ref name=\"LATimesHoldUp\" /> Marty's future is bettered because he goes back to 1955 and teaches George to be more assertive and self-reliant; his initiative leads to more prosperous future for Marty with materialistic rewards.<ref name=\"UproxxAnalysis\" /><ref name=\"LATimesHoldUp\" /> The film uses many brand names of the time, ostensibly to make the setting more realistic\u2014such as [[Mountain Dew]], [[Pepsi]], and [[Texaco]]\u2014but the filmmakers received financial compensation from the brand owners, making their inclusion promotional and commercialistic instead of artistic.<ref name=\"BOMGaleInterview\" /><ref name=\"UproxxAnalysis\" />\n\nFilm studies lecturer Sorcha N\u00ed Fhlainn argues that many 1980s films resulted from the American public's desire for escapism from cultural anxieties and fears, including nuclear proliferation, unemployment, crime, growing inequality, and the AIDS crisis. In her view, films like those of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series and ''Back to the Future'' offered a childlike reassurance of safety and comfort, emphasizing idealized American values and the positive effects of instilling power in a patriarchal figure like George McFly or Darth Vader.{{sfn|N\u00ed Fhlainn|2014|p=5}} English professor Susan Jeffords considered Doc Brown to be an analog for Reagan, a man who embraces technological advancement, who is in conflict with Libyan terrorists, and provides the means for a failing family to better themselves.{{sfn|N\u00ed Fhlainn|2014|p=7}}\n\nThe song \"Johnny B.
