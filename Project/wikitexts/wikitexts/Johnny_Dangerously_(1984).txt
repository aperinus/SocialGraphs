It was directed by [[Amy Heckerling]].\n\nThe film stars [[Michael Keaton]] as an honest, goodhearted man who turns to a life of crime to finance his mother's skyrocketing medical bills and to put his younger brother through law school. [[Joe Piscopo]], [[Marilu Henner]], [[Maureen Stapleton]], [[Peter Boyle]], [[Griffin Dunne]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Dick Butkus]] and [[Alan Hale Jr.|Alan Hale, Jr.]] were in the film.\n\nPart of the film's comedic appeal is the clever and frequent use of [[malapropism]]s by Johnny and other crime characters, especially in instances where curse words were intended.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins in 1935. A pet shop owner catches a young boy shoplifting a puppy. To discourage the kid from a life of crime, the owner tells a story by way of a flashback.\n\nIn 1910, Johnny Kelly is a poor but honest newsboy in [[New York City]]. Johnny's mother, Ma Kelly, needs an operation that his family cannot afford. Since Johnny's criminal father was executed, Ma has supported her sons by doing other people's laundry. Johnny's younger brother, Tommy, is fascinated by the law. Johnny gets into a street fight with a boy named Danny Vermin, which attracts the notice of local crime boss Jocko Dundee, who offers Johnny a job. Seeing no honest way to earn the money for his mother's operation, Johnny agrees, even though it would break his mother's heart. He helps rob a rival nightclub belonging to Roman Moronie, a malapropist of swear words. Moronie claims he never forgets a \"fargin'\" face. When Jocko asks Johnny for his name, he replies Johnny Dangerously.\n\nYears pass. With Ma Kelly's continuing medical problems, Johnny decides to work for Dundee full-time. Everyone knows that Kelly is really Johnny Dangerously, except for Ma and Tommy, who think he owns a nightclub. Similarly, the gang knows nothing of Johnny's mother and brother. One day, Johnny comes to Dundee's headquarters to find he has taken on two new gang members: Danny Vermin, and his sidekick Dutch. Danny has become a \"total scumbag\" who uses opera audiences as shooting galleries. As the two gangs continue to war, Johnny falls for Lil Sheridan, a young showgirl new to the big city. Eventually, Johnny becomes the boss of the Dundee gang and negotiates a truce with Moronie.\n\nEventually, Tommy graduates from law school, unknowingly funded by Johnny's illicit earnings. He goes to work for the District Attorney's office, under D.A. Burr, who is on Johnny's payroll. Burr tries to sidetrack Tommy, who has become a major public figure after hearings look into Moronie's activities. Meanwhile, Burr and Vermin conspire to kill Tommy by cutting the brakes on his car. Tommy is badly injured, but survives. Johnny has Burr killed in revenge, which leaves Tommy as the new District Attorney. Vermin discovers that Dangerously is the D.A.'s brother, and Tommy overhears Vermin chortling about it. Tommy confronts Johnny, who agrees to turn over the evidence against himself to the Crime Commissioner. However, as Johnny enters the Commissioner's office, he finds him dead, and Vermin knocks him out and frames Johnny for the murder.\n\nJohnny is arrested, but insists he was framed. He realizes that his lucky cigarette case is missing, and that whoever actually has it is the guilty party. Nonetheless, Johnny is found guilty, sentenced to the electric chair and sent to Death Row. But when Vermin congratulates Tommy, he drops Johnny's cigarette case. Pocketing the case, Tommy realizes Johnny really is innocent, and that Vermin is the actual perpetrator. Johnny arrives on Death Row, where he receives rock star treatment from the starstruck warden. Johnny hears word that Tommy is in danger, and plots an escape\u2014with the rather strange request to the warden to move up his execution to that very night. As he is taken to the chair, Johnny assembles what looks like a tommy gun from parts handed to him by inmates. He escapes in a laundry truck driven by Lil Sheridan. Johnny, by way of a wild car chase (involving peeling off several layers of shelf paper on the truck), arrives at a movie theatre where Vermin and Dutch are behind the screen, planning to kill Tommy. Johnny runs to the front row, sees Vermin's gun barrel, jumps in front of Tommy and shoots through the screen. He wounds Vermin, and both learn that Johnny's cigarette case\u2014on Tommy's person at the time\u2014took Vermin's bullet. Vermin is arrested as the governor pardons Johnny.\n\nThe story returns to 1935. The young shoplifter is starstruck. Johnny wraps up his story and sends the boy off with a kitten and the lesson \"crime doesn't pay.\" When the boy leaves, Johnny changes into a tuxedo and heads off in a limo with Lil, looking at the camera and admitting: \"Well, it paid a little!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Keaton]] as Johnny Kelly (a.k.a.

Hurd, the film \"is loaded with sight gags, one liners, numerous sexual jokes, and puns\". But many critics found it to be a comedy which relies on [[sophomoric humor]].<ref name=\"Hurd\">Hurd (2007), p. 24</ref> According to [[Gwendolyn Audrey Foster]], the film is both a [[Mob film|gangster comedy]] and an homage to 1930s gangster films, but is perhaps too clever for a mainstream audience.<ref name=\"Foster\">Foster (1995), p. 175</ref> According to Leigh Hallisey, the film is a parody of \"old-school\" gangster films and reveals Heckerling's awareness of their conventions and stereotypes.<ref name=\"Hallisey\">Hallisey (2002), p. 232</ref> Foster finds the comedies of [[Amy Heckerling]] to rely on \"fast-paced, witty repartee and droll humor\", and draws comparisons to those of [[Frank Tashlin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]].<ref name=\"Foster\">Foster (1995), p. 175</ref>\n\nMartin F. Norden considers the film to be part of a trend in 1980s comedies, linking disability to humor. He notes that the film contains numerous gags of this nature. He spotlights a [[running gag]], concerning a blind newspaper vendor played by [[Ray Walston]]. He starts out [[Blindness|blind]] but a bundle of newspapers hits him on the head, causing him to regain his sight. A repetition of the accident then leaves him [[Deafness|deaf]]. Another repetition restores his sight and hearing but causes him to suffer [[amnesia]].<ref name=\"Norden\">Norden (1994), p. 290</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* {{citation | last=Foster | first=Gwendolyn Audrey| title=''Women Film Directors: An International Bio-critical Dictionary'' | chapter =Heckerling, Amy| year=1995 | publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]| isbn= 978-0313289729 | chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=-kJHa7KqnQ4C&pg=PA175 }}\n* {{citation | last=Hallisey | first=Leigh| title=''Contemporary North American Film Directors: A Wallflower Critical Guide'' | chapter =Amy Heckerling | year=2002 | publisher=Wallflower Press| isbn= 978-1903364529 | chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ifl0AkO-KeIC&pg=PA232 }}\n* {{citation | last=Hurd | first=Mary G.| title=''Women Directors and Their Films'' | chapter =Amy Heckerling| year=2007 | publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]| isbn= 978-0275985783 | chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=kfaOdsk5TI0C&pg=PA24 }}\n* {{citation | last=Norden | first=Martin F. | title=''The Cinema of Isolation: A History of Physical Disability in the Movies'' | chapter =High-Tech Heroics and Other Concerns| year=1994 | publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]| isbn= 978-0813521046 | chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=wehWxBo_AWUC&pg=PA380 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0087507|Johnny Dangerously}}\n* {{mojo title|johnnydangerously|Johnny Dangerously}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|johnny_dangerously|Johnny Dangerously}}\n\n{{Amy Heckerling}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnny Dangerously}}\n[[Category:1984 films]]\n[[Category:1980s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Amy Heckerling]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Morris]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1910]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1935]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Mafia comedy films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:1984 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in a movie theatre]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
