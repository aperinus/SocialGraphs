The film follows Matt Weston (Reynolds), a [[CIA]] officer on a low-level posting in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], who is in charge of a [[safe house]] where the CIA is interrogating Tobin Frost (Washington), a veteran operative who has allegedly betrayed the agency. When the safe house is attacked by mercenaries, Weston flees with Frost in his charge. As the team of killers, who seem to be one step ahead of the pair, track them throughout Cape Town, Weston wonders who to trust. [[Vera Farmiga]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]], [[Nora Arnezeder]] and [[Robert Patrick]] co-star.\n\n''Safe House'' was Espinosa's first English-language film. Filming took place on location in Cape Town. The film premiered in New York City on February 7, 2012, and was released in U.S. theaters on February 10, 2012, by [[Universal Pictures]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=October 29, 2010| url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/heat-vision/universal-announces-release-dates-bourne-33670|title=Universal Announces Release Dates for 'The Bourne Legacy,' 'Safe House'|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]| access-date=November 18, 2010}}</ref> The film earned mixed reviews, with praise for Washington and Reynolds' performances, but negative criticisms for the screenplay and the editing of the action scenes. Nevertheless, ''Safe House'' was a commercial success, earning $208 million worldwide against an $85 million budget.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], junior [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Matt Weston is serving as a \"housekeeper\", an operative in charge of securing and maintaining a local CIA [[safe house]] in case of an operation. He calls his mentor and immediate superior, David Barlow, and inquires about a station in Paris, where he hopes to follow his live-in girlfriend Ana, a young French physician about to start her residency. Barlow tells him he is likely underqualified for the position, which frustrates Matt as he has not had a \"houseguest\" during his year long tenure, and thus has been unable to gain field experience. Barlow promises to revisit the issue in a few months.\n\nElsewhere in Cape Town, ex-CIA [[Non-official cover|NOC]] operative turned international criminal Tobin Frost acquires a [[data storage device]] from rogue [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] officer Alec Wade. A team of mercenaries attacks them and kills Wade. Frost flees and, out of options, surrenders to the American consulate.\n\nA team led by veteran Daniel Kiefer transfers Frost to Weston's safe house in order to interrogate him for intelligence before he is returned to the US. Weston watches uneasily as Kiefer's team [[waterboarding|waterboards]] Frost. The mercenaries, led by Vargas, attack the safe house and kill Kiefer and his team. Weston escapes with Frost.\n\nWeston contacts Barlow at [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]] in [[Langley, Virginia]], along with Catherine Linklater, the operative in charge of Frost's interrogation and Kiefer's superior, and CIA Deputy Director Harlan Whitford, who is overseeing the operation. Linklater orders Weston to lie low and await further instructions.\n\nFrost begins to manipulate Weston, insisting that someone within the CIA gave away their location to the mercenaries and that Weston will be forced to take the fall if things go wrong. Weston contacts Ana, giving her a cover story that his office has been threatened and suggesting she stay with friends when it appears their apartment is under surveillance. Barlow tells Weston to go to [[Cape Town Stadium]] where he retrieves a GPS device containing the location of another safe house, but Frost creates a diversion and escapes. Weston, detained by the police, escapes and is forced to fire at them.\n\nWeston contacts Langley to report Frost's escape. After hearing that Weston fired at the police, Linklater orders him to visit the nearest American embassy for debriefing. When Whitford tells him \"we'll take it from here\", Weston decides to pursue Frost himself as Frost had warned him that when he heard that phrase (\"we'll take it from here\"), that was when Weston should become concerned about his own safety. Linklater and Barlow go to South Africa themselves. En route, Linklater suggests that Weston has joined Frost, which Barlow refutes. Weston meets with Ana and admits he is in the CIA, urging her to return to Paris and to tell anyone who asks that they broke up a week ago in order to protect her.\n\nWeston tracks Frost to a [[Township (South Africa)|township]] in [[Langa, Western Cape|Langa]], where Frost meets Carlos Villar, an old friend and document forger, who provides him with travel documents but suggests that he leave his life of crime behind. Vargas' team attacks again, killing Carlos and his family, but Weston helps Frost escape. Weston brutally interrogates one of Vargas' wounded mercenaries, who reveals that Vargas is working for the CIA, which is seeking to retrieve the storage device from Frost. As they bandage their wounds, Frost urges Weston not to kill innocent people, telling the story of how he was forced to kill an air traffic controller while on a mission. He later learned that he was simply part of a plot to assassinate a whistle-blower who would expose [[wetwork]] committed by the CIA.\n\nWeston takes Frost to the new safe house, where Weston keeps the housekeeper, Keller, at gunpoint. Keller attacks and severely wounds Weston before Weston kills him. Frost reveals the device contains evidence of corruption and bribery involving the CIA, [[MI6]], and other intelligence agencies, put together from a [[Mossad]] intelligence report. Frost leaves Weston, who passes out from blood loss.\n\nMeanwhile, Linklater informs Barlow of the device's existence, but not its contents. Barlow kills her and travels to the safe house where he reveals that he is Vargas' employer. He confirms that the file contains incriminating evidence against him, and encourages Weston to lie about what has happened. Frost returns and kills Vargas' team but is fatally wounded by Barlow. Weston then shoots and kills Barlow. As he dies, Frost gives Weston the file, saying he is a better man than Frost.\n\nBack in the United States, Weston meets with Director Whitford, who informs Weston that unflattering facts about the CIA must be removed from his report, but that he will be promoted. He asks Weston about the file's location but Weston denies knowing about it. Whitford states that whoever has those files will have many enemies. Weston assures Whitford that he will \"take it from here,\u201c visibly shaking Whitford's hand, and leaves. He leaks the files to the media, incriminating personnel from many intelligence agencies, including Whitford. Weston travels to Paris and covertly observes Ana while she sits with friends in a cafe. She notices him across the street and smiles before he walks away, content that she is safe.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Tobin Frost\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Matt Weston\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Catherine Linklater\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as David Barlow\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Harlan Whitford\n* [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]] as Carlos Villar\n* [[Nora Arnezeder]] as Ana Moreau\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Daniel Kiefer\n* [[Liam Cunningham]] as Alec Wade\n* [[Joel Kinnaman]] as Keller\n* [[Fares Fares]] as Vargas\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Safe House: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Ramin Djawadi]]\n| released   = {{Start date|2012|2|21}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=68|s=51}}\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] <small>067137</small>\n| producer   = Ramin Djawadi\n| prev_title = [[Fright Night (2011 film)#Soundtrack|Fright Night]]\n| prev_year  = 2011\n| next_title = [[Game of Thrones: Season 2 (soundtrack)|Game of Thrones: Season 2]]\n| next_year  = 2012\n}}\n[[Ramin Djawadi]] composed the score to the film.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|title=Safe House by Ramin Djawadi|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/safe-house-mw0002289553|access-date=November 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Track listing===\nAll music by Ramin Djawadi.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n{{tracklist\n|collapsed       = \n|headline        = \n|total_length    = 68:51\n|title1          = Safe House\n|length1         = 3:15\n|title2          = A Hundred Lies a Day\n|length2         = 3:15\n|title3          = Get in the Trunk\n|length3         = 4:24\n|title4          = Do I Make You Nervous?\n|length4         = 3:07\n|title5          = I Used to Be Innocent Like You\n|length5         = 2:11\n|title6          = Tobin Frost\n|length6         = 2:19\n|title7          = Off the Grid\n|length7         = 3:27\n|title8          = Do What You Have to Do\n|length8         = 4:48\n|title9          = Don't Kill Innocent People\n|length9         = 3:45\n|title10         = Who Do You Work For?\n|length10        = 3:44\n|title11         = Walk Away\n|length11        = 6:03\n|title12         = People Change\n|length12        = 2:16\n|title13         = Be Better Than Me\n|length13        = 4:11\n|title14         = Langa\n|length14        = 6:14\n|title15         = More Past Than Future\n|length15        = 3:19\n|title16         = 12 Months\n|length16        = 3:05\n|title17         = Truth\n|length17        = 3:42\n|title18         = I'll Take It From Here\n|length18        = 5:46\n}}\n\nSongs used in the film but not included in the soundtrack album were:\n* \"Rebel Blues\" performed by [[Don Omar|L\u00ebk S\u00e8n]]\n* \"[[No Church in the Wild]]\" performed by [[Kanye West]] & [[Jay-Z]] featuring [[Frank Ocean]]\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered in New York City on February 7, 2012, and was released in U.S. theaters on February 10, 2012.
