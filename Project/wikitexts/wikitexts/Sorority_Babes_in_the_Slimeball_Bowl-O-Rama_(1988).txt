In later years, it gained recognition as a \"so-bad-it's-good\" [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nThree nerdy frat boys, Calvin, Jimmie, and Keith, follow and spy on the Tri-Delta sorority group, which is holding an initiation ceremony. Sorority members Babs, Rhonda, and Frankie prepare for the ritual while newcomers Taffy and Lisa wait. Observed by the frat boys outside their house, the two initiates get spanked from a paddle and are sprayed with whipped cream during the initiation. While the girls clean themselves, the boys enter the house; the girls catch them there. The boys are then sent, with the pledges, on a mission to steal a trophy from a nearby bowling alley. Unbeknownst to them, Babs' father runs the mall where the bowling alley is located and watches the group through security cameras.\n\nThe group enters the bowling alley and encounters Spider, a stoic biker burgling the alley with a [[crowbar (tool)|crowbar]]. With her help, they break into the trophy room and, upon accidentally dropping the bowling trophy, unleash an [[imp]] named Uncle Impie who offers each of them one wish for freeing him. Jimmie is granted his wish of gold stacks, Taffy her wish of being the Prom Queen, and Keith his wish of having sex with Lisa. Suspicious of Uncle Impie, Spider and Calvin decline his offer.\n\nUncle Impie then attacks the sorority trio from the camera; Frankie is turned into the [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Bride of Frankenstein]]; and Rhonda is turned into a demon minion; Babs flees. After Babs is rendered unconscious from touching the mall's doors (which Uncle Impie has electrified to keep the group from leaving), the group finds out that the wishes requested were not really granted, with Jimmie's gold made out of wood and Taffy's dress disappearing.\n\nThe minions kill Jimmie and use his head as a bowling ball, and an enchanted Lisa tries furiously to have sex with Keith. Spider and Calvin hide from Rhonda in a closet, where they find a pistol; they shoot Rhonda, then flee. After escaping Lisa, Rhonda kills Keith by shoving his face into a stove, and the minions pull Taffy apart. Babs awakes and fights Rhonda, shoving her into the alley where she is seemingly killed by Spider, with a bowling ball. With Rhonda dead, Babs is possessed and turned into a demon minion.\n\nSpider and Calvin find the janitor, who reveals that the Imp was summoned to help a lousy bowler become a champion, and the Imp was trapped for 30 years due to the creature killing people (the bowler was blamed and executed for the deaths). Meanwhile, after Babs kills Lisa, no longer under Impie's spell, with a paddle, she is burned to death with a [[Molotov cocktail]] tossed by Calvin. After Spider and Calvin find the janitor dead, they are chased by Frankie with an [[axe]]. Spider gains the upper hand and decapitates her, and the severed head knocks the doors open. While Calvin starts up a car and is attacked by Rhonda from the backseat, Spider successfully traps Uncle Impie in a box. Calvin struggles to control the car, and ends up crashing upside down. Spider cries out for Calvin and runs to his aid.  Calvin survives while Rhonda is killed from the crash.\n\nAs day breaks, Spider drives Calvin to her house on her motorcycle while Uncle Impie is seen trapped in the box at the curb, asking someone to let him out, including the audience of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Linnea Quigley]] as \"Spider\"\n* [[Andras Jones]] as Calvin\n* [[Robin Rochelle]] as Barbara \"Babs\" Peterson\n* [[Carla Baron]] as Frankie\n* Kathi O'Brecht as Rhonda\n* John Stuart Wildman as Keith\n*[[Hal Havins]] as Jimmie\n* [[Brinke Stevens]] as \"Taffy\"\n* [[Michelle Bauer]] as Lisa\n* [[Dukey Flyswatter]] as Uncle Impie (credited as The [[Imp]])\n* [[George \"Buck\" Flower]] as The Janitor\n\n==Production==\nProduction for the film began and ended within 12 days in September 1987, in the state of California. Filming locations included the [[The Shoppes at Carlsbad|Plaza Camino Real]] and Eagle One Bowl. Due to the low budget, the movie had to be filmed in the bowling alley at night when it was closed, until 9 a.m., when it opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096142/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=IMDb Trivia|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe director, [[David DeCoteau]], was referenced in the story as David McCabe, and his film ''[[Creepozoids]]'' can be seen on Calvin's television in the beginning.\n\nEarly trailers for the film featured a high-pitched voice for the Imp; the final film used a lower-pitched voice. The bowling trophy from which Uncle Impie is released is made out of balsa wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096142/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=IMDb Trivia|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter production ended, DeCoteau reused the same cast and crew in ''[[Nightmare Sisters]]''.<ref>David DeCoteau, John Schouweiler.
