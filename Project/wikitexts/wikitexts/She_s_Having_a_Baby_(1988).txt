It tells the story of a young newlywed couple who try to cope with married life and their parents' expectations.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nThis film looks at the lives of Jefferson \"Jake\" ([[Kevin Bacon]]) and Kristy Briggs ([[Elizabeth McGovern]]), from their wedding day until the birth of their first child, mostly through Jake's eyes, with his voiceover commentaries and several imaginary scenes.\n\nBefore their wedding day, Jake asks his best friend Davis McDonald ([[Alec Baldwin]]) if he thinks Jake will be happy to which Davis says \"Yeah, you'll be happy. You just won't know it.\"\n\nAfter their wedding that was attended by Jake's parents Jim (James Ray) and Sarah ([[Holland Taylor]]), his grandparents ([[Bill Erwin]] and Reba McKinney), and Kristy's parents Russ ([[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]]) and Gayle ([[Cathryn Damon]]), Jake and Kristy head off for New Mexico where Jake works toward gaining a Master's Degree, but leaves before finishing. They return to Chicago where Jake is hired as an advertising copywriter. Jake says he wants to be a writer, which amuses his boss Howard ([[Paul Gleason]]). Kristy is hired as a research analyst and they are able to buy a house in the suburbs. Meanwhile, Jake begins fantasizing about having an affair with a mysterious young French model (Isabel Garc\u00eda Lorca).\n\nJake and Kristy continue to adjust to their new lives, although Jake feels pressure from his parents, society, and his wife to have a child. Gayle ([[Cathryn Damon]]) casually informs them that she had a difficult birth with Kristy and nearly died. Later, Kristy informs Jake that she stopped taking contraceptives without telling him. After several months, they discover that the reason she hasn't gotten pregnant is because he has been unable to impregnate her.\n\nAfter not seeing Jake and Kristy for three years, Davis visits unexpectedly telling them that his father has died. Jake and Kristy are supportive, allowing him to stay the night. Things take a turn when Davis makes a pass at Kristy by proclaiming his feelings and trying to open her bathrobe, but Kristy turns him down telling him that she is in love with Jake.\n\nThe couple begins a fertility program, which eventually succeeds. During a traumatic labor, Jake must leave the delivery room and he worries about losing Kristy, realizing that his lack of satisfaction in life was due to his own selfishness and immaturity.\n\nThe last scene of the film reveals that Jake's voiceover was the new father reading his novel entitled ''She's Having a Baby'' to his wife and son.\n\nDuring the credits, Jake and Kristy talk about what to name their son as a montage of family members, people they know, Roman Craig, Chet Ripley, and Buck Ripley from the following film ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]'', Ferris Bueller from ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', and an assortment of different actors pitching their suggestions of boy names is shown before settling on the name Christopher.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Jefferson \"Jake\" Edward Briggs, an advertising copywriter.\n** Neal Bacon as young Jake\n* [[Elizabeth McGovern]] as Kristen \"Kristy\" Bainbridge Briggs, a research analyzer and Jake's childhood sweetheart who marries Jake.\n** Laure Aronica as young Kristy\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Davis McDonald, Jake's friend.\n* James Ray as Jim Briggs, Jake's father.\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Sarah Briggs, Jake's mother.\n* [[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]] as Russell \"Russ\" Bainbridge, Kristy's father.\n* [[Cathryn Damon]] as Gayle Bainbridge, Kristy's mother.\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Grandpa Briggs, Jake's grandfather.\n* Reba McKinney as Grandma Briggs, Jake's grandfather.\n* [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]] as Ken\n* [[Paul Gleason]] as Howard, a man who hires Jake to work as an advertisement copywriter.\n* [[Dennis Dugan]] as Bill, the business partner of Howard.\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Hank\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Lynn\n* [[Nancy Lenehan]] as Cynthia\n* Valerie Breiman as Erin\n* [[Gail O'Grady]] as Laura\n* Isabel Garc\u00eda Lorca as Fantasy Girl\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as Girl in Medical Lab\n\nBesides some of the characters mentioned above, the following appear in the end credits pitching their ideas of boy names for Jake and Kristy's son where they are all uncredited:\n\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kirstie Alley]]\n* [[Harry Anderson]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Roman Craig from ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]''\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Ferris Bueller from ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''\n* [[John Candy]] as Chet Ripley from ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]''\n* [[Dyan Cannon]]\n* [[Belinda Carlisle]]\n* [[Stewart Copeland]]\n* [[Ted Danson]] \n* [[Judi Evans]]\n* [[Bob Fraser (TV producer)|Bob Fraser]] \n* [[Woody Harrelson]]\n* [[Robert Hays]]\n* [[Amy Irving]]\n* [[Magic Johnson]]\n* [[Michael Keaton]]\n* [[Joanna Kerns]]\n* [[Elias Koteas]]\n* [[Penny Marshall]]\n* [[Bill Murray]]\n* [[Olivia Newton-John]]\n* [[Roy Orbison]]\n* [[Cindy Pickett]]\n* [[Bronson Pinchot]]\n* [[Annie Potts]]\n* [[John Ratzenberger]]\n* [[Ally Sheedy]]\n* [[Lyman Ward (actor)|Lyman Ward]]\n* [[Wil Wheaton]]\n* [[Chris Young (actor)|Chris Young]] as Buck Ripley from ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]''\n* [[Warren Zevon]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], and [[Evanston, Illinois]], from September 1986 to December 1986.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=She's Having a Baby Filming Locations\n|work=80s Movies\n|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_havingababy.htm\n}}</ref> However, several scenes were shot directly in the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]] in Chicago, Illinois.

The site's consensus states: \"Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern struggle to sustain a spark in ''She's Having a Baby'', a blase adult romance that lacks the specificity and style of writer-director John Hughes' more successful forays into teenage angst.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|id=shes_having_a_baby}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave ''She's Having a Baby'' a mixed 2 stars out of 4. He wrote that the film \"begins with the simplest and most moving of stories and interrupts it with an amazing assortment of gimmicks,\" being salvaged only by strong performances from Bacon and McGovern.<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |author-link1=Roger Ebert |title=She's Having a Baby Movie Review (1988) |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/shes-having-a-baby-1988 |website=rogerebert. |date=February 5, 1988}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[An Evening with Kevin Smith 2: Evening Harder]]'' director [[Kevin Smith]] cites ''She's Having a Baby'' as his favorite John Hughes film.
