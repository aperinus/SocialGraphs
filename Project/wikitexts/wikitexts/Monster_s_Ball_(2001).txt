The film received positive reviews, with critical acclaim directed at Berry, Ledger and Thornton's performances, Forster's direction, and Addica and Rokos' screenplay. It was also a significant commercial success, grossing $44.9 million worldwide on a production budget of $4 million.\n\nThe film received numerous accolades and nominations, and was nominated twice at the [[74th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Berry) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Original Screenplay]] (Addica and Rokos), with Berry winning for her performance, becoming the first, and only [[African Americans|African-American]] woman to win the award.<ref>{{Cite web |title=#OscarsSoWhite and The Legacy of Halle Berry {{!}} 8Hours |url=https://www.8hours.com/essay/oscarssowhite-and-the-legacy-of-halle-berry#:~:text=In%202002%20Halle%20Berry%20became,it%20relates%20to%20actresses%20today. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210728203840/https://www.8hours.com/essay/oscarssowhite-and-the-legacy-of-halle-berry/ |archive-date=July 28, 2021 |access-date=2020-10-03 |website=www.8hours.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Barbour|first=Shannon|date=2020-09-09|title=Halle Berry's Oscar Win Was One of Her \"Biggest Heartbreaks\"|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a33967383/halle-berry-oscar-win-biggest-heartbreaks-monsters-ball/|access-date=2020-10-03|website=Cosmopolitan|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=September 9, 2020 |title=Halle Berry Recalls Historic Oscars Win For 'Monster's Ball' |url=https://www.bet.com/celebrities/news/2020/09/09/halle-berry-historic-oscars-win.html?cid=facebook |access-date=2020-10-03 |website=BET.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nHank Grotowski, a [[widow]]er, and his son, Sonny, are [[corrections officer]]s in a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/movies/film-review-courtesy-and-decency-play-sneaky-with-a-tough-guy.html?smid=url-share |title = FILM REVIEW; Courtesy and Decency Play Sneaky With a Tough Guy - The New York Times|website = [[The New York Times]]|date = 26 December 2001|last1 = Scott|first1 = A.

Sonny is friends with the Cooper brothers, Willie and Darryl, who are [[Black people|black]]. At the behest of Buck, Hank frightens off the brothers with a shotgun and is later confronted by their father Ryrus.\n\nHank, the prison's deputy warden, will oversee the [[Capital punishment|execution]] of convicted murderer Lawrence Musgrove. Musgrove, a talented amateur artist, draws a sketch of Sonny. Sonny is a shy and gentle person, and is as kind to Musgrove as his duties permit.\n\nThe night before the execution, Hank tells Sonny that a \"monster's ball\" is held by the corrections officers, a get-together of those who will participate in the execution. The proceedings prove too much for Sonny, who, as he is leading Lawrence to the [[electric chair]], vomits, and then collapses. Following the execution, Hank confronts Sonny in the prison's bathroom and slaps him for being so \"soft\" and \"ruining a man's last walk\".\n\nThe next morning, Hank attacks Sonny in his bed and orders him to leave the house. Sonny grabs a [[revolver]] from under his pillow and holds his father at gunpoint. The confrontation ends in their living room with Hank sitting on the carpet, and Sonny in Buck's customary chair. Sonny asks his father if he hates him. After his father calmly confirms that he does, and always has, Sonny responds, \"Well, I always loved you,\" and commits suicide by shooting himself in the chest.\n\nA devastated Hank buries Sonny in the back garden with an abbreviated [[funeral]] because, as Buck comments, \"He was weak.\" Hank subsequently resigns as deputy warden, burns his uniform in the backyard, and locks the door of Sonny's room. He purchases a local gas station in an attempt to provide a distraction in his retirement. The Coopers offer condolences to Hank, who asks which one is Willie and which one is \"Harry\" (mistaking Darryl's name) and is corrected politely.\n\nDuring the years of Lawrence's imprisonment leading up to his execution, his wife, Leticia, has been struggling while raising their son, Tyrell, who has inherited his father's artistic talent. Overwhelmed, she lashes out at the boy for his [[obesity]], resorting to physical and emotional abuse.  Along with her domestic problems, Leticia struggles financially, with an [[eviction notice]] on her house from her landlord. In desperate need of money, Leticia takes a job at a diner frequented by Hank. Due to lack of maintenance (which Lawrence had suggested), Leticia\u2019s car breaks down, so she and Tyrell begin walking back and forth between home and the diner.\n\nOne rainy night, Leticia (having stolen an umbrella) and Tyrell are walking down a soaked highway. Hank happens to be driving along and sees Tyrell lying mortally wounded on the ground and Leticia calling for help. After some hesitation, Hank stops, and being told Tyrell was struck by a car, he drives them to a hospital, where Tyrell dies from his injuries. At the suggestion of the authorities at the hospital, Hank drives Leticia home. A few days later, Hank gives Leticia another ride home from the diner. They begin talking in the car about their common losses, and she invites him in. Hank finds out that Leticia is Lawrence's widow, though he does not tell her that he participated in her husband's execution. They drown their grief with alcohol and have sex.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bonner |first=Mehera |date=September 4, 2019 |title=15 Movies That Broke the Mold and Featured Anal Sex Scenes |language=en-US |work=[[Marie Claire]] |url=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a13515394/best-anal-movie-sex-scenes/ |access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHank takes Sonny's old truck to Ryrus' auto shop and they discuss fixing it, with Hank mentioning he wanted to sell the truck, and asking if Ryrus' boys could wax it. He then offers to give the truck to Leticia, who reluctantly accepts after initial protests of discomfort.\n\nLeticia stops by Hank's home with a present for him, but he is not there. She meets Buck, who insults her and implies that Hank is only involved with her because he enjoys sex with black women. Leticia, offended by the remarks, refuses to interact with Hank. After Hank is made aware of Buck's actions, he finally commits his father to a [[nursing home]]. He then renames the gas station \"Leticia's\", saying it is his girlfriend's name when asked.\n\nLeticia is evicted from her home and Hank invites her to move in with him. She later discovers Hank's involvement in her husband's death when she finds the drawings of Sonny and Hank done by Lawrence as he awaited execution. She\u2019s disturbed by the revelation, but numb from the loss of her son and recent misfortune, she\u2019s waiting for Hank when he returns from town with ice cream. The film ends with the two of them eating ice cream together on the back porch, content with each other as Hank states that he thinks they\u2019ll be okay.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Hank Grotowski\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Leticia Musgrove\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as Sonny Grotowski\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Buck Grotowski\n* Coronji Calhoun as Tyrell Musgrove\n* [[Sean Combs]] as Lawrence Musgrove\n* [[Mos Def]] as Ryrus Cooper\n* Charles Cowan Jr. as Willie Cooper\n* Taylor LaGrange as Darryl Cooper\n\n==Development==\n[[File:AngolaLAPrison.jpg|thumb|[[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] served as a filming location.]]\nThe basis for this film came from the desire of actor-turned-writers Addica and Rokos to make a script that would interest a big star alongside themselves with [[Harvey Keitel]] in mind since he liked the latter's writing when offered one of their scripts.<ref name=\":0\"/> They were inspired by their troubled relationships with their fathers as a starting point that eventually led to a generational tale about executioners, which eventually led to the inspiration for the title (an old term for the last meal of a condemned man and a \"ball\" that took place with his jailers the night before).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |date=December 1, 2015 |title=FROM SCRIPT TO SCREEN: 'Monster's Ball' - Script Magazine |url=https://scriptmag.com/columns/script-screen-monsters-ball |access-date=2020-10-03 |website=scriptmag.com}}</ref> They wrote the script over a period of eight months over the course of 1995 that eventually inspired a bit of interest through a producer of a film Rokos had acted in.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2001-08-12|title=A Death Row Tale Finally Gets a Reprieve|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-aug-12-ca-33196-story.html|access-date=2020-10-03|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> Years of development occurred due to interest from filmmakers ranging from [[Robert DeNiro]] to [[Oliver Stone]] along with studios that wanted a lighter ending, but the transition to [[Lee Daniels]] and Lionsgate led to interest back to the original ending.<ref name=\":1\" /> The film was produced by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] and Lee Daniels Entertainment, the first production for the latter.\n\n== Production ==\nPrincipal photography began in May 2001 in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] and lasted for five weeks.<ref name=\":0\" /> A week before production, Combs auditioned for the role of Lawrence Musgrove, and won it.

What a shock to find these two characters freed from the conventions of political correctness, and allowed to be who they are: weak, flawed, needful, with good hearts tested by lifetimes of compromise.\" Of the screenplay, Ebert wrote, \"The screenplay by [Addica] and [Rokos] is subtle and observant; one is reminded of short fiction by Andre Dubus, William Trevor, Eudora Welty, Raymond Carver. It specifically does not tell \"their\" story, but focuses on two separate lives. The characters are given equal weight, and have individual story arcs, which do not intersect but simply, inevitably, meet.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBen Falk of [[BBC Online|BBC.com]] spoke highly of Berry and Thornton's performances, writing, \"This is by far Berry's best-ever performance and Thornton reminds us that there are few, if any, leading men who can convey sadness and hope almost simultaneously in just one minimal glance.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Falk |first=Ben |title=BBC - Films - review - Monster's Ball |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/02/13/monsters_ball_2002_review.shtml |access-date=2020-10-03 |website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a negative review, Jeffrey Chen of ReelTalk Movie Reviews complimented the performances, but was critical of the script, writing, \"Unfortunately, too many things bothered me so that I could not buy in to the movie. I didn't buy the idea that both Hank and Leticia needed each other -- Leticia needs Hank, but I got the feeling that Hank would've fared just fine (albeit less happily) without Leticia. If I wasn't supposed to see Hank as needing Leticia, then the movie would simply become a demeaning man-saves-woman story. I was also skeptical of the notion that sex heals wounds as well as it clearly does for these two characters.\" He finished off his review by saying, \"''Monster's Ball'' really isn't as offensive as I'm making it sound, but it had enough problems to trouble me to the point where I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. It may be worth seeing for the acting alone. It's a two-person show, with [Thornton] turning in another strong performance and [Berry] breaking out and showing her range. If you're a fan of either or both of these two, you'll be quite happy with the movie. Outside of that, I make no guarantees -- unless you just really enjoy your share of rescue fantasies.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chen |first=Jeffrey |date=January 12, 2002 |title=ReelTalk Movie Reviews |url=http://www.reeltalkreviews.com/browse/viewitem.asp?type=review&id=3930 |access-date=2020-10-03 |website=www.reeltalkreviews.com}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
