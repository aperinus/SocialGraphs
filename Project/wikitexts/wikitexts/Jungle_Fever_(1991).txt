The film stars [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Annabella Sciorra]], Lee, [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Lonette McKee]], [[John Turturro]], [[Frank Vincent]], [[Halle Berry]] (in her film debut), [[Tim Robbins]], [[Brad Dourif]], [[Queen Latifah]], [[Michael Imperioli]], and [[Anthony Quinn]], and is Lee's fifth feature-length film. ''Jungle Fever'' explores the beginning and end of an extramarital [[Interracial relationships|interracial relationship]] against the urban backdrop of the streets of [[New York City]] in the early 1990s. The film received positive reviews, with particular praise for Samuel L. Jackson's performance.\n\n==Plot==\nSuccessful [[Harlem]] architect Flipper Purify ([[Wesley Snipes]]) lives with his wife Drew ([[Lonette McKee]]), a [[Buyer (fashion)|buyer]] at [[Bloomingdales]], and their young daughter, Ming (Veronica Timbers). At work, Flipper discovers that an [[Italian-American]] woman named Angie Tucci ([[Annabella Sciorra]]) has been hired as his [[temporary worker|temp]] secretary. Initially upset at being the only black person, he relents after being told hiring is based on ability, not race.\n\nAngie lives in [[Bensonhurst]] with her abusive father, Mike ([[Frank Vincent]]), and her two brothers, Charlie (David Dundara) and Jimmy ([[Michael Imperioli]]). Angie's quiet fianc\u00e9 Paulie ([[John Turturro]]) runs a corner grocery store and lives with his elderly widowed father, Lou ([[Anthony Quinn]]). Meanwhile, Angie feels suffocated at home.\n\nAfter working several late nights together, Flipper and Angie [[sexual intercourse|have sex]], beginning a tumultuous relationship. The next day, Flipper demands his superiors, Jerry ([[Tim Robbins]]) and Leslie ([[Brad Dourif]]), promote him to partner, but he is denied. He resigns, having plans to start his own firm.\n\nEventually, Flipper admits his infidelity to his longtime friend, Cyrus ([[Spike Lee]]), who criticizes him not for his infidelity towards his wife, but for his affair with a white woman. Cyrus refers to his situation as \"jungle fever\"\u2014an attraction borne of sexualized racial myths rather than love\u2014and Flipper asks Cyrus not to tell anyone. Angie's friends are equally disparaging when she tells them she is having a relationship with a black man.\n\nDrew learns about Flipper's affair through Cyrus' wife, Vera ([[Veronica Webb]]) and throws him out of their home. Flipper moves in with his father, [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] [[preacher]] The Good Reverend Purify ([[Ossie Davis]]) and mother, Lucinda Purify ([[Ruby Dee]]). Later, Mike severely beats Angie after discovering that she is dating a black man and kicks her out of their home.\n\nAt Drew's workplace, Flipper attempts to reconcile but Drew kicks him out, feeling he was only attracted to her for being half-white, and that Flipper was searching for a white woman as he was a successful black man. Flipper and Angie move into an apartment in [[Greenwich Village]] where they encounter discrimination for being a mixed race couple, such as being insulted by a waitress named LaShawn ([[Queen Latifah]]), chastisement from The Good Reverend, and financial issues.\n\nAfter some play fighting, Flipper gets restrained by two policemen ([[Do the Right Thing|the same ones who killed Radio Raheem two years prior]]) who receive a call that he was attacking Angie. The couple's issues are compounded by Flipper's feelings for his family and Angie wanting to have children of her own, causing their split. Echoing what Cyrus told him earlier, Flipper tells Angie their relationship has been based on sexual racial myths and not love, but Angie denies this, telling him she loves him for who, not for what, he is.\n\nLater, Flipper's [[Crack cocaine|crack]]-addicted brother Gator ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) steals and sells Lucinda's TV for crack. Searching all over Harlem, Flipper eventually finds him in a crack house and exasperatedly disowns him.\n\nSoon after, Gator returns to his parents' house to ask for money and, after Lucinda refuses, begins ransacking the home. His erratic behavior ignites an altercation that ends with The Good Reverend proclaiming angrily that his son is \"evil and better off dead\" before shooting him. Gator collapses and dies in Lucinda's arms as The Good Reverend watches remorsefully.\n\nMeanwhile, Paulie's racist Italian-American friends mock him for having lost his girlfriend to a black man. He asks one of his customers, a friendly black woman named Orin Goode ([[Tyra Ferrell]]), out on a date. This angers his father, whom he defiantly ignores. En route to meet Orin, Paulie is assaulted viciously by his other customers for attempting an interracial relationship. Although badly beaten, Paulie still arrives for his date with Orin.\n\nMike reluctantly allows Angie to return home, and Flipper unsuccessfully tries to mend his relationship with Drew. As Flipper leaves from his apartment, a young crack-addicted prostitute propositions him, and in response, Flipper throws his arms around her and cries out in anguished torment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Flipper Purify<ref>{{cite news|title= Jungle Fever|work= [[Orlando Sentinel]]|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-05-17/entertainment/9105171224_1_snipes-jungle-fever-annabella-sciorra|access-date=2010-10-02}}</ref>\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Angie Tucci\n* [[Spike Lee]] as Cyrus\n* [[Ossie Davis]] as The Good Reverend Doctor Purify\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Lucinda Purify\n* [[Samuel L.
