The film is based on the [[X-Men]] superhero team appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. It is the [[sequel]] to ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000), as well as the second installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], and features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[James Marsden]], [[Rebecca Romijn|Rebecca Romijn-Stamos]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Alan Cumming]], [[Bruce Davison]], [[Shawn Ashmore]], [[Aaron Stanford]], [[Kelly Hu]], and [[Anna Paquin]]. Its plot, inspired by the [[graphic novel]] ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]'', concerns the [[genocide|genocidal]] Colonel [[William Stryker]] leading an assault on [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Professor Xavier]]'s school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer [[Cerebro]], in order to destroy every mutant on Earth and to save the human race from them, forcing the X-Men to team up with the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], their former enemies, to stop Stryker and save the mutant race.\n\nDevelopment on the sequel began shortly after the first film was released on July 14, 2000 by [[20th Century Fox]]. [[David Hayter]] and [[Zak Penn]] wrote separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. [[Michael Dougherty]] and [[Dan Harris (screenwriter)|Dan Harris]] were eventually hired to rewrite the work, and changed the characterizations of [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], and [[Lady Deathstrike]]. [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and the [[Danger Room]] were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns from Fox. The film's premise was influenced by the Marvel Comics storylines ''[[List of Ultimate X-Men story arcs#Return to Weapon X|Return to Weapon X]]'' and ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills|God Loves, Man Kills]]''. Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November, mostly taking place at [[Vancouver Film Studios]], the largest North American production facility outside of Los Angeles. [[Production design]]er [[Guy Hendrix Dyas]] adapted similar designs by [[John Myhre]] from the previous film.\n\n''X2'' was released in the United States on May 2, 2003 by [[20th Century Fox]], and received positive reviews for its storyline, action sequences, and performances. The film grossed $407{{nbsp}}million worldwide, and received eight [[Saturn Awards]] nominations. A sequel, ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', was released on May 26, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[White House]], brainwashed teleporting [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] attacks the [[President of the United States]], wounding many agents.He is shot and retreats. Meanwhile, [[Logan (film character)|Logan]] explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in [[Alberta]] for clues to his past, but finds nothing. [[Jean Grey]] has been having premonitions and struggles to concentrate as her powers become increasingly difficult to control. Later, Logan returns to [[Professor Xavier]]'s school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using [[Cerebro]]. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] go to question the imprisoned [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] about the attack, while X-Men [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and Jean Grey retrieve Nightcrawler. Military scientist Colonel [[William Stryker]] approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants in the wake of the recent attack. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] leads the remaining students to safety while Logan, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] escape, and Stryker's assistant [[Lady Deathstrike|Yuriko Oyama]] captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack, Logan confronts Stryker, who addresses him as Wolverine and seems to know about his past.\n\nThe shape-shifting [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] gains information about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics for a second Cerebro. Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents and brother in [[Boston]] and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]] is attacked by fighter jets while flying back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it and Xavier to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, [[Jason Stryker|Jason]], is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, whom Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker was the man who grafted his [[adamantium]] skeleton onto his bones and is responsible for his amnesia. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake.\n\nDisguised as Logan, Mystique infiltrates Stryker's base. She lets the rest of the mutants in and Magneto and Mystique go to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Jean fights a mind-controlled Cyclops; their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins to rupture. Logan finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it as where he received his adamantium skeleton. Logan fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter's wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on humans. The two subsequently use Stryker's helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro, who has been swayed to Magneto's views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control.\n\nThe X-Men flee the dam as water engulfs it, killing Stryker, but the X-Jet loses all power and struggles to take flight as the flood water rushes towards them. Jean sneaks off the jet and telepathically wishes the team goodbye. She holds back the water and raises the jet above it as flames erupt from her body, until she lets go and allows the flood to crash down upon her, presumably killing her. The X-Men give Stryker's files to the president, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Logan remember Jean, and Xavier begins to hold a class. Meanwhile, a [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix-like shape]] rises from the flooded Alkali Lake.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Professor Charles Xavier]]: A powerful [[telepathic]] mutant confined to a wheelchair who founded a School for \"Gifted Youngsters\", Xavier is a [[pacifist]] who believes humans and mutants can live together in harmony. He uses the [[Cerebro]] device, designed by Magneto and himself, to track and locate mutants across the world. A natural genius, Xavier is regarded as an authority on genetic mutation.\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film character)|Logan / Wolverine]]: A mysterious mutant who suffers from amnesia and has little to no recollection of his past life before he was grafted with an indestructible [[Adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] skeleton. Wolverine is a gruff loner, but is in love with Jean Grey and acts as a father figure to Rogue. He wields three highly durable adamantium blades that come out of each of his fists, has keen animal-like senses, the ability to heal rapidly from virtually any injury, and is a ruthless and aggressive fighter.\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as [[Magneto (film character)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: Once Xavier's ally, Magneto now believes mutants are superior to humans and that a genetic war is coming. Magneto wields the ability to manipulate metal magnetically, as well as the power to create magnetic fields and fly. He wears a helmet that renders him immune to Xavier's powers and all related telepathic powers. Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information over Cerebro and the Xavier Institute, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker. He has demonstrated sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation and engineering. The character's helmet was slightly redesigned as McKellen found wearing it uncomfortable in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591281/s Louise Mingenbach], United Colors of ''X2'', 2003, [[20th Century Fox]]</ref>\n* [[Halle Berry]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: An African mutant and teacher at Xavier's School who can control the weather with her mind.
