Mia and Alice have just moved into a trendy apartment but are in desperate need of a housemate. Mia's girlfriend Danni ([[Radha Mitchell]]) is keen to move in, but Mia fears commitment.\n\nObsessed with her favourite lecturer, Mia becomes embroiled in a war of paperwork with the university administration as she attempts to pursue him to his new department. She is hampered in her efforts to transfer by her current supervisor Professor Leach ([[Kym Gyngell]]). To add to her woes she then breaks up with her girlfriend, Danni. Danni pursues another love interest, in part to get back at Mia.\n\nAlice, a habitual perfectionist, is four years late with her thesis on 'Doris Day as Feminist Warrior'. She is looking for the perfect man but can't find anyone who fits her strict criteria. Frustrated, she falls for the most unsuitable male possible... Ari ([[Matthew Dyktynski]]), a classics student and part-time gigolo. However she is the object of desire of shy medical student, Michael ([[Matt Day]]).\n\nAs the day ends and the party begins events begin to unscramble in unexpected ways. ''Omnia Vincit Amor...
