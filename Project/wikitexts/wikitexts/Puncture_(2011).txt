The film is based on the true story of [[Michael David Weiss|Michael David \"Mike\" Weiss]] and Paul Danziger. It was chosen as one of the spotlight films for the 2011 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], premiering on April 21, 2011 in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/puncture-film36410.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408145328/http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/puncture-film36410.html |archivedate=2011-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nMike Weiss, a young Houston lawyer and drug addict, and Paul Danziger, his longtime friend and straitlaced law partner, are the personal injury lawyers behind the law firm Danziger & Weiss. They decide to take on a case involving Vicky Rogers, a local ER nurse, who was [[Needlestick injury|pricked by a contaminated needle]] on the job and contracted HIV. Vicky shows Mike and Paul a [[safety syringe|safety needle]], invented by her family friend, Jeffrey Dancort, which defends against accidental [[Needlestick injury|needlesticks]] by only being used once, and she urges them to help bring the product to hospitals. Vicky later dies from her illness. Mike digs deeper into the case, and discovers no one is willing to buy the needle because of a healthcare/pharmaceutical conspiracy and bribery racket. With the threat of exposure, heavyweight attorneys move in on the defense led by attorney Nathaniel Price. Out of their league and out of money, the mounting pressure of the case pushes the two underdog lawyers and their business to the breaking point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killerfilm.com/articles/read/evans-gets-a-puncture-27973 |title=Evans gets a Puncture |work=KillerFilm.com |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, Mike is struggling with his heavy drug usage and his loneliness. He seeks sex therapy as a source of comfort and is consistently in the company of prostitutes. His personal struggles hinder the realization of his professional ambitions, as he misses many of the meetings and investment events, driving a wedge between him and Paul.\n\nMike, Paul, and Dancort gain the support of Senator O'Reilly, not before she gives Mike an ultimatum: get clean. Mike's heavy withdrawal leaves him hospitalized, only adding to the financial burdens of the firm. The momentum of the case seems to come to a standstill: Senator O'Reilly pulls out after United Medical Health Supplies lobbies for her re-election campaign and Paul, with a new baby at home, is not interested in pursuing the case over his family.\n\nThey meet with Nathaniel Price, and he offers a settlement, the tipping point for the conflict between Mike and Paul. Their conflict comes to a head as Mike argues to take the case to trial and seek justice, while Paul protests there is no feasible way they can continue all the way financially. Mike meets a former employee of Thompson Needle Manufacturers and a friend of Vicky's, who implores him to continue the case on behalf of the lives affected by used needles, which spread AIDS and [[hepatitis]] worldwide. Mike meets with Nathaniel Price and pledges he will personally find new clients and hospital employees affected by these unsafe needles across the country. However, the next day, Paul finds Mike dead from an overdose.\n\nAt the settlement conference, Paul walks in with famous personal injury attorney [[Mark Lanier]], declining the settlement and proclaiming that they will see them in court. The movie's postscript tells the audience that in 2004, Attorney Lanier settled a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest medical supply manufacturer for over $150 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/03/business/03buyer.html?scp=16&sq=Retractable%20Technologies%20Inc&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Syringe Manufacturer Settles Claim of Market Manipulation | date=July 3, 2004|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref> \"As a result, thousands of hospitals throughout the United States now use [[safety syringe|safety needles]].\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Atty.
