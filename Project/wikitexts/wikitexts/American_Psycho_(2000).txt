The film contains comedic elements but is not an outright horror comedy. It is a horror film foremost. See [[WP:FILMLEAD]]. -->[[horror film]] directed by [[Mary Harron]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Guinevere Turner]]. Based on the [[American Psycho|1991 novel of the same name]] by [[Bret Easton Ellis]], it stars [[Christian Bale]] as [[Patrick Bateman]], a New York City [[investment banker]] who leads a double life as a serial killer. [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Jared Leto]], [[Josh Lucas]], [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], [[Samantha Mathis]], [[Cara Seymour]], [[Justin Theroux]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]] appear in supporting roles. The film blends horror and [[black comedy]] to satirize 1980s [[yuppie]] culture and [[consumerism]], exemplified by Bateman.\n\nEllis considered his controversial novel potentially [[Unfilmability|unfilmable]], but producer [[Edward R. Pressman]] was determined to adapt it and bought the film rights in 1992. [[Stuart Gordon]], [[David Cronenberg]], and [[Rob Weiss]] considered directing the film before Harron and Turner began writing the screenplay in 1996. They sought to make a 1980s period film that emphasized the novel's satire. The pre-production period was tumultuous; Harron chose Bale to play Bateman, but because distributor [[Lions Gate Films]] sought [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] in the role, Harron was fired and replaced with [[Oliver Stone]]. After Stone and DiCaprio left due to creative differences, Harron was rehired and allowed to cast Bale. [[Principal photography]] began in February 1999 in Toronto and New York City.\n\n''American Psycho'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 21, 2000, and was theatrically released in the United States on April 14. The film received mostly positive reviews, with praise for Bale's performance and the screenplay, and grossed over $34 million on a $7 million budget. It has since developed a [[cult following]] and a strong presence in contemporary [[Internet meme|meme]] culture.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 16, 2022 |title=10 Movie Characters Who Became Memes |url=https://screenrant.com/movie-characters-popular-meme-template/ |access-date=April 30, 2022 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> A direct-to-video sequel, ''[[American Psycho 2]]'', was released in 2002, although it has almost no relation to the original.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1987, [[Patrick Bateman]], a young and wealthy New York City [[investment banker]], spends most of his time dining at popular restaurants while keeping up appearances for his fianc\u00e9e Evelyn Williams and his circle of wealthy associates, most of whom he hates. At a business meeting, Bateman and his associates flaunt their [[business card]]s. Enraged by the superiority of his colleague Paul Allen's card, Bateman confronts a homeless man in an alley at night and stabs him and stomps his dog to death. Bateman and Allen, who mistakes Bateman for another coworker, make plans for dinner after a Christmas party. Bateman resents Allen for his affluent lifestyle and ability to obtain reservations at Dorsia, an exclusive restaurant that Bateman is unable to get into. Bateman manipulates Allen into getting drunk. He lures Allen into his apartment and kills him with an axe while listening to [[Huey Lewis and the News]]. Bateman goes into Allen's apartment and leaves a message on his answering machine claiming that Allen has gone on a business trip to London.\n\nAfter [[private investigator]] Donald Kimball interviews Bateman regarding Allen's disappearance, Bateman takes two prostitutes, Christie and Sabrina, to his apartment, where they have sex before he tortures them and sends them on their way after paying them. Bateman's colleague Luis Carruthers reveals a new business card, so Bateman tries to strangle him in the restroom of an expensive restaurant. Carruthers mistakes the attempt for a sexual advance and declares his love for Bateman, who panics and flees. Kimball conducts a second interview with Bateman, revealing that a colleague of Bateman's claims to have spotted Allen in London, calling the entire investigation into question. Bateman is relieved, but is perturbed and begins to doubt himself. After murdering a model, Bateman invites his secretary Jean to dinner, suggesting that she meet him at his apartment for drinks. Bateman plans to kill her with a nail gun, but desists after he receives a message from Evelyn on his answering machine.\n\nAn agonized Bateman meets Kimball for lunch. Kimball reveals that a colleague of Bateman claims to have had dinner with him, cementing his alibi. Kimball remarks that someone murdering Allen for no reason is simply not believable, to which Bateman nervously smiles. Bateman brings Christie to Allen's apartment where he drugs his acquaintance Elizabeth before having sex with her and Christie. After Bateman kills Elizabeth, Christie runs, discovering multiple female corpses as she searches for an exit. Bateman chases her and drops a chainsaw on her as she flees down a staircase. Afterwards, Bateman breaks off his engagement with Evelyn.\n\nAs Bateman uses an [[automated teller machine|ATM]], he sees a cat. The ATM displays the text \"FEED ME A STRAY CAT\", so he prepares to shoot the cat. When a woman confronts him, he instead shoots her. A police chase ensues, but Bateman kills the officers and blows up a police car. Bateman kills two more people before hiding in his office. He calls his lawyer Harold Carnes and frantically leaves a confession, claiming to have killed 20\u201340 people. The following morning, Bateman visits Allen's apartment to clean up the remains, but finds it vacant and for sale. The [[Real estate broker|realtor]] cryptically tells him that the apartment does not belong to Allen before ordering him to leave.\n\nWhile Bateman goes to meet with his colleagues for lunch, Jean finds detailed drawings of murder and mutilation in Bateman's office journal. Bateman sees Carnes and mentions the phone message. Carnes mistakes Bateman for another colleague and laughs off the confession as a joke. Bateman clarifies who he is and again confesses the murders, but Carnes says his claims are impossible since he recently had dinner with Allen in London. A confused Bateman returns to his friends; they muse whether [[Ronald Reagan]] is a harmless old man or hidden psychopath before discussing their dinner reservations. Bateman, unsure if his crimes were real or imaginary, realizes he will never receive the punishment he desires. His narration declares that his confession has meant nothing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 500\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = right\n| footer = (Left to right) [[Christian Bale]], [[Willem Dafoe]] (both pictured in 2019), and [[Jared Leto]] (2016)\n| image1 = Christian Bale-7837.jpg\n| alt1 = A photograph of Christian Bale\n| image2 = Willem Dafoe Cannes 2019.jpg\n| alt2 = A photograph of Willem Dafoe\n| image3 = Jared Leto, San Diego Comic Con 2016 (2).jpg\n| alt3 = A photograph of Jared Leto\n}}\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Patrick Bateman]], a New York City [[investment banker]] who leads a double life as a serial killer\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Donald Kimball, a [[private investigator]] who investigates the murder of Paul Allen\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Paul Allen, a fellow investment banker who Bateman kills\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Craig McDermott, a colleague of Bateman\n* [[Samantha Mathis]] as Courtney Rawlinson, Luis Carruthers' fianc\u00e9e who is having an affair with Bateman\n* [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]] as Luis Carruthers, a colleague of Bateman and closeted homosexual\n* [[Bill Sage]] as David Van Patten, a colleague of Bateman\n* [[Cara Seymour]] as Christie, a prostitute\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Jean, Bateman's secretary\n* [[Guinevere Turner]] as Elizabeth, a woman who Bateman kills\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Timothy Bryce, a colleague of Bateman\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Evelyn Williams, Bateman's fianc\u00e9e whom he despises\n\nOther cast members include Stephen Bogaert as Harold Carnes, Bateman's lawyer; [[Reg E.

Turner was not a horror fan and had never heard of ''American Psycho'', but Harron convinced her that it would be a good project to pursue.

The e-mails also describe or mention interactions with other characters from the novel, including Timothy Price (Bryce in the film version), Evelyn, Luis, Courtney, David, Detective Kimball, and Marcus. However, the film's star, Christian Bale, was not happy with this kind of marketing: \"My main objection is that some people think it will be me returning those e-mails. I don't like that ...

Ellis appreciated that the film clarified the humor for audiences who mistook the novel's violence for blatant misogyny as opposed to the deliberately exaggerated satire he'd intended, and liked that it gave his novel \"a second life\" in introducing it to new readers.
