Conway]] and written by Ken Pettus, from a story by Thomas C. Chapman and Conway. It stars [[Darren McGavin]], [[Robert Vaughn]], [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]], [[James Hampton (actor)|James Hampton]] and [[Pamela Bellwood]].<ref name=\"Hangar 18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/77285/Hangar-18/full-credits.html|title=Hangar 18|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|access-date=December 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''Hangar 18'' is about a cover-up following a UFO incident aboard the [[Space Shuttle]]. A satellite, just launched from the orbiter, collides with an unidentified object which, after being spotted on radar moving at great speeds, had positioned itself just over the shuttle. The collision kills an [[astronaut]] in the launch bay. The events are witnessed by Bancroft and Price, the astronauts aboard. After returning to Earth, they are stonewalled when they try to discuss what happened. Harry Forbes, Deputy Director of NASA, simply tells them that \"everything is going to be all right\".\n\nAfter it makes a controlled landing in the [[Arizona]] desert, the damaged alien spacecraft is taken to Wolf Air Force Base in Texas and installed in Hangar 18, where scientists and other technicians, headed by Harry Forbes, can study it. Due to an impending presidential election, government officials are anxious to prevent any public knowledge of the event.\n\nMeanwhile, unbeknownst to Forbes, the Air Force puts out a news story blaming Bancroft and Price for the death of their colleague and for the destruction of the satellite. The men know they can prove their innocence by viewing the telemetry tapes which recorded the UFO; but when they view them, all evidence of the object has been erased. Through a friend who works at a remote tracking station, they see the real telemetry and discover where the alien craft landed. They set out to expose the cover-up and clear their names.\n\nIn the hangar, investigators who enter the ship find its two crew members are dead. They determine that, during the collision with the satellite, chemicals were released in the craft that produced a short-lived toxic gas. They find a human woman in a stasis chamber, who later wakes up screaming. They realize that symbols on the control panels match those used by ancient Earth civilizations. Video on the ship's computer shows extensive surveillance of power plants, military bases, industrial plants and major cities worldwide. Autopsies performed on the aliens show that they and humans had similar evolutionary processes. A scientist deduces that the ship could not have reached Earth on its own, but must have been launched from a much larger, faster and more long-ranged mother ship.\n\nIn their pursuit of the truth, Bancroft and Price get closer to Hangar 18 but are targets of government agents. They elude one team, who are killed during a high-speed chase. Later, they find the brakes on their rental car have stopped working, and after careening along roads, they come to rest on the grounds of a gas refinery. Agents begin shooting at them, so they drive off in an oil tanker. With the agents in pursuit, Price climbs onto the tanker, lets some gas out of the truck, lights an emergency flare, and tosses it. Their pursuers crash and are killed, but Price is fatally shot. When Forbes learns of Price's death, he demands the Air Force take Bancroft to Hangar 18 or he will go to the press with the truth. Their cover-up and careers now threatened, government officials decide to remotely fly an explosives-filled plane into Hangar 18 to destroy all evidence of the event.\n\nThe researchers have determined that the aliens have been to Earth before and that human beings are, in fact, their descendants. Further examination of the video footage reveals that the industrial and military sites are \"designated landing areas\", suggesting the aliens are preparing to return.\n\nWhen Bancroft arrives at the base, he crashes through the base's security gate and, hiding in a warehouse, is discovered by Forbes, who takes him to Hangar 18 and the alien craft. Just as a researcher reveals that a translation of the aliens' language indicates that they are about to return, the plane crashes into Hangar 18, creating a huge explosion.\n\nThe next day, a news report says that Bancroft, Forbes and their group of technicians survived the blast, shielded inside an alien spacecraft. Forbes schedules a press conference for that afternoon.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]] as Steve Bancroft\n* [[James Hampton (actor)|James Hampton]] as Lew Price\n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as Gordon Cain\n* [[Pamela Bellwood]] as Dr. Sarah Michaels\n* Andrew Bloch as linguist Neal Kelso\n* [[Philip Abbott]] as Lt.
