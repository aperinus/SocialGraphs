It was released on June 19, 2009, received mixed reviews and grossed $35 million.\n\n==Plot==\nBoris Yelnikoff is a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]], [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] chess teacher and former [[University of Columbia|Columbia]] quantum mechanics professor. Divorced, he avoids most people and, except for three friends and his students, is patronizing to everyone he meets, who doesn't match him intellectually. He also spends much of the film washing his hands, while singing the song, \"Happy Birthday\". \n \nBoris comes home one night to find Melody, a simpleminded 21-year-old, on his doorstep. He reluctantly helps her, and she soon tells him her story. Melody turns out to have a distinctly [[Southern United States|Southern]] background, with [[religious fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] parents in Mississippi, and she's run away from them. She asks if she can stay the night, to which Boris eventually allows. While staying with Boris, Melody develops a crush on him, despite their age difference, varying cultures and intelligence.\n\nMelody soon finds a job as a dog walker, where she meets Perry Singleton and they arrange a date. When she comes back home afterwards, she explains to Boris, she didn't like Perry because he loved the world too much. Boris realizes that he's in love with her and they soon marry.\n\nA year later, Melody's mother, Marietta, finds Melody, explaining that she and her husband, John, thought Melody had been kidnapped. She goes on to tell her that John left her and sold their house after John lost money in the stock market. She meets Boris and is disappointed with him, so she tries to persuade Melody to end the marriage. The three go for lunch and meets Boris's friend, Leo. When Marietta goes to use the restroom, a young man, Randy Lee James, inquires about Melody and Marietta slyly decides to recruit Randy, who has fallen in love with Melody [[Love at first sight|at first sight]], to end her marriage. Later that evening, Leo, who had taken an interest in Marietta, asks her over for dinner. They spend the evening together, and discover that she's a talented photographer.\n\nBoris explains to the audience that over the next few weeks Marietta has changed and started experimenting with artistic photography, exotic new habits, and starting an [[open relationship]] with Leo and his business partner, Morgenstern. Marietta still hates Boris and keeps trying to get Melody to marry Randy. She takes Melody to an outdoor market and \"accidentally\" runs into Randy, who questions her about her marriage. Melody initially sees past Marietta's attempt and tells him that her marriage is fine. She warns her mother to stop, but Marietta continues to try. Later, while shopping for clothes, Melody meets Randy in another planned encounter and he gets her to admit that her relationship with Boris isn't entirely satisfying. He then invites her to the boat he lives on, and the two kiss and begin an affair.\n\nJohn arrives at Boris and Melody's home remorseful and hopes to get the family back together. They all go to Marietta's photography exhibit opening together, and he sees how his ex-wife has changed since she moved to New York. Distraught, he retreats to a bar, drinking away his misery. While there, he meets a recently divorced gay man, Howard, and admits what he has known most of his adult life: that he is also gay.\n\nMelody finally tells Boris she's in love with Randy, and Boris is devastated, jumping out another window. This time landing on another woman, Helena, breaking her arm and leg. As he visits her in the hospital, Boris asks her if there is anything he can do to make it up to her, Helena says she would like to go to dinner with him.\n\nFinally, Boris hosts a New Year's Eve party, where everyone is in their new relationships: Marietta with Leo and Morgenstern, John is with Howard, Melody with Randy, and finally Boris with Helena. Melody and her parents have completely shed their former Southern [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] mindsets and wholeheartedly adopted the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[New York City]] way of life and values. While everyone is now the best of friends, and at midnight they kiss their significant others.\n\nAfterward, it is revealed only Boris can speak to the audience and explains, that one has to find all the enjoyment one can to find, \"''Whatever Works''\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Larry David]] as Boris\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Melody\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as John\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Marietta\n* [[Conleth Hill]] as Brockman \n* [[Michael McKean]] as Boris' friend\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as Randy Lee James\n* [[John Gallagher Jr.]] as Perry\n* [[Jessica Hecht]] as Helena\n* [[Carolyn McCormick]] as Jessica\n* [[Christopher Evan Welch]] as Howard\n* [[Aleksander Krupa|Olek Krupa]] as Morgenstern\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Adam Brooks (filmmaker)|Adam Brooks]] and Lyle Kanouse portray Boris' two other unnamed friends.\n\n==Release==\nOn February 2, 2009, ''[[Variety magazine|Variety]]'' reported that [[Sony Pictures Classics]] had purchased U.S. distribution rights to ''Whatever Works''.

Thirty years later, Allen revisited the script in an attempt to create a film before a potential threat of a [[Screen Actors Guild]] strike.<ref name=\"nymag\"/> According to Allen, the only significant changes to the script involved updating the topical references.<ref name=\"teleg\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/06/16/woody_allen_larry_david_evan_rachel_wood|title=Woody Allen, Larry David, Evan Rachel Wood & Others Discuss 'Whatever Works'|work=Starpulse Entertainment News|date=June 16, 2009|access-date=June 19, 2009|archive-date=June 20, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620175418/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/06/16/woody_allen_larry_david_evan_rachel_wood|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* \"[[Hello, I Must Be Going (song)|Hello, I Must Be Going]]\" \u2013 [[Groucho Marx]] and Cast\n* \"Salty Bubble\" \u2013 Tom Sharpsteen and His Orlandos\n* \"Butterfly By\" \u2013 [[Heinz Kiessling]]\n* \"Honeymoon Swoon\" \u2013 Werner Tautz\n* \"[[If I Could Be With You (One Hour Tonight)]]\" \u2013 [[Jackie Gleason]]\n* [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)]] in D Minor, Op. 125  \u2013 [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]\n* [[Wedding March]] \u2013 [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]\n* [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)]] in C Minor  \u2013 [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]\n* \"[[Desafinado]]\" \u2013 [[Stan Getz]] and [[Charlie Byrd]]\n* \"Spring Will Be A Little Late This Year\" \u2013 [[Red Garland]]\n* \"Menina Flor\" \u2013 Charlie Byrd\n* [[Auld Lang Syne]] \u2013 [[Dick Hyman]] & His Orchestra\n* \"Happy Birthday To You\" \u2013 Larry David\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 50% based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10.
