It is the sequel to the 1988 film ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]''. This sequel had a limited theatrical release before being released on video in 1996 and stars [[Daniel Bernhardt]], who reprised the role in a sequel. It is the second film in the ''Bloodsport'' franchise.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter thief Alex Cardo ([[Daniel Bernhardt]]) gets caught and betrayed by his partner in crime John (Philip Tan) while stealing an ancient [[Jian]] in [[Thailand]], he soon finds himself imprisoned and beaten. One of the guards, Demon (Ong Soo Han), is particularly upset by Alex's appearance and tortures him whenever he gets the opportunity. Alex finds one friend and mentor in the jailhouse, Master Sun ([[James Hong]]), who teaches him a superior fighting style called \"[[Iron Palm|Iron Hand]]\". When a \"best of the best kumite\" is to take place, Demon gets an invitation. Now Master Sun and Alex need to find a way to let Alex take part in the kumite, too.\n\nThe final fight pits Alex and Demon together.  At first, and for a long time, Demon has the upper hand in terms of strength and fighting ability.  When Alex is down, he takes one last look at Master Sun and uses the \"Iron Hand\" against his opponent, severely damaging and defeating Demon.  Alex is the winner, and as part of deals previously made, Master Sun is freed from prison, and so is Alex.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Daniel Bernhardt]] \u2013 Alex Cardo\n*[[Pat Morita]] \u2013 David Leung\n*[[Donald Gibb]] \u2013 Ray 'Tiny' Jackson\n*[[James Hong]] \u2013 Master Sun\n*Lori Lynn Dickerson \u2013 Janine Elson\n*Ong Soo Han \u2013 Demon\n*[[Philip Tan]] \u2013 John\n*Nicholas Hill \u2013 Sergio DeSilva\n*Ron Hall \u2013 Cliff\n*[[Hee Il Cho]] \u2013 Head Judge\n*Shaun Gordon \u2013 Sun's Student\n*Lisa McCullough \u2013 Kim Campbell\n*Chuay \u2013 Chien\n*Steve Martinex \u2013 Head Referee\n*Jeff Wolfe \u2013 Flash\n*Cliff Bernhardt \u2013 Len\n*Nils Allen Stewart \u2013 Gorilla\n*Eric Lee \u2013 Seng\n*[[Kevin Chong]] \u2013 Sun's Student\n*Jerry Piddington \u2013 Kumite fighter\n*Richard Kee Smith \u2013 Kumite fighter\n*[[Gokor Chivichyan]] \u2013 Kumite fighter\n\n==Series continuity==\nActor [[Donald Gibb]] also appeared in [[Bloodsport (film)|the first Bloodsport film]] as Ray Jackson.
