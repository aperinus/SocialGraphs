Hours later, Boris\u2019s cousin Mark wakes him with news that the [[Operation Barbarossa#Invasion|Germans have invaded]].\n\nVeronika soon learns that Boris volunteered for the army. Boris asks his grandmother to give Veronika her birthday gift, a stuffed squirrel toy (\"squirrel\" is Boris's pet name for Veronika) into which he slides a love note. Veronika arrives too late to see Boris at his apartment, but his grandmother gives Veronika the stuffed squirrel. Veronika searches for Boris at the assembly station but misses finding him there too, as he marches off to war.\n\nVeronika remains in Moscow with her parents, who are killed in a German air raid that also destroys their apartment building. Boris's family invites the orphaned Veronika to stay with them.\n\nBoris's cousin Mark tells Veronika he loves her, but she faithfully waits for Boris. Veronika and Mark are alone in the apartment when another air raid occurs. Mark makes a pass at her, but she rebuffs him. Furious at being rejected, he rapes her. Veronika and Mark marry, but she despises him, and is in turn despised by the family who considers she betrayed Boris.\n\nAt the front, Boris gets into an argument with another soldier, Volodya, who taunts him over a photo of Veronika. Their commanding officer catches them fighting and assigns them a dangerous reconnaissance mission. Boris saves Volodya\u2019s life, but Boris gets shot. In his final moments, he has a vision of the wedding that he and Veronika never had.\n\nTo escape the German offensive, the family is relocated to Siberia. Veronika works as a nurse in a military hospital run by Boris's father, Fyodor. Mark and Veronika are miserable in their marriage.\n\nWhen a soldier in the hospital becomes hysterical after he received a letter saying his girlfriend left him for someone else, Veronika rushes to get Fyodor, who is processing the arrival of wounded troops. She barely misses seeing the injured Volodya, who is about to be admitted to the hospital, before Fyodor says that the hospital is full. Fyodor admonishes the distraught soldier to forget his unfaithful and unworthy girlfriend. Veronika overhears Fyodor\u2019s speech and becomes upset since she appears to be such a woman.\n\nOverwhelmed with guilt, Veronika tries to throw herself in front of a train. Just before she attempts suicide, she sees a young child about to be hit by a car and rescues him. The boy has been separated from his mother, and his name is Boris. Veronika takes the boy home and looks for her squirrel toy from Boris. Boris's sister Irina spitefully tells Veronika that Mark is giving the toy to his mistress at her birthday party. Veronika races over to the party, where a partygoer has finally found the note that Boris hid. Veronika grabs it, and in voice-over Boris narrates the final tender love note to her.\n\nFyodor learns that Mark bribed his way out of being drafted into the Red Army. He realises Mark betrayed Russia and the family and has taken advantage of Veronika. Fyodor kicks Mark out, and Veronika is forgiven by the family for \"betraying\" Boris. The boy saved by Veronika becomes part of the family. Later, Volodya, having recovered, comes in search of Boris's family and tells them that Boris is dead.\n\nIn 1945, the war has ended, and Veronika and Volodya stroll by the river back in Moscow. They are very close, but Veronika still refuses to believe that Boris is dead since Volodya was injured himself and never saw Boris die. When Boris\u2019s unit returns, Veronika carries a huge bouquet of flowers, intends to give them to him and hunts for him and his friend Stepan during a celebration at the train station. Veronika finds Stepan and finally learns that Boris is indeed dead. In tears, she stumbles through the celebrating crowd. As Stepan gives a rousing speech, asserting that those who died in the war will never be forgotten, Veronika goes from grieving to handing out her flowers to the returning soldiers and their families. When she looks up, cranes are flying again in the sky over Moscow.\n\nThe film ends with the words:\n\"But we shall not forget those left on the battlefield.\nTime will pass.\nTowns and villages will be rebuilt.\nOur wounds will heal.\nBut our fierce hatred of war will never diminish. \u2026.\nWe have triumphed not to destroy.\nBut to build a new life.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Mikhail Kalatozov PSE Russia 2003.jpg|thumb|right|320x222px|The illustrated [[Postal stationery envelope|PSE]] with the scenes from the film: A.

It was not only Soviet audiences that accepted and sympathised with Veronika's story. The lead actress of ''Cranes'',  [[Tatiana Samoilova]], who was frequently identified with her role, took Europe by storm. Following the film's victory at the Cannes Film Festival in 1958, where it earned the event\u2018s prestigious Grand Prize, the world celebrated the film's main protagonist, and critics hailed the production for its stunning cinematography, acting, direction and editing. Woll notes that the French ''Liberation'' commentator, for example, approvingly contrasted Samoilova's purity and authenticity with that of [[Brigitte Bardot]], a French female icon.<ref>Josephine Woll, ''The Cranes are Flying'' (London: I. B. Tauris, 2003), 77.</ref> Samoilova remembered receiving a watch from her East German fans during a festival there. The gift featured the inscription: \"Finally we see on the Soviet screen a face, not a mask\".<ref>Josephine Woll, ''Cranes'', 77.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Amg movie|11381}}\n* {{IMDb title|0050634}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=71700}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/200-the-cranes-are-flying ''The Cranes Are Flying''] an essay by Chris Fujiwara at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n* [http://www.vobzor.com/dvdcompare3.php?id=758 Comparison of different DVD editions] (in Russian and English)\n* <!-- ATTENTION: this is the OFFICIAL Mosfilm Youtube channel, not a copyvio!!! -->{{YouTube|2OccZQmxKac|Full movie, in original version with subtitles in several languages including English}}\n\n{{Mikhail Kalatozov}}\n{{Palme d'Or 1939-1959}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cranes Are Flying, The}}\n[[Category:1960 films]]\n[[Category:1960s war drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet war drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:1960s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Eastern Front of World War II films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow Oblast]]\n[[Category:Palme d'Or winners]]\n[[Category:Mosfilm films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mikhail Kalatozov]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Soviet romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Russian black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Russian World War II films]]\n[[Category:Soviet World War II films]]"}]}}}}
