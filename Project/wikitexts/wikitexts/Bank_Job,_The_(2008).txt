It received mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed $66 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1971, British Security Services ([[MI5]]) have taken interest in a [[safety deposit box]] that is located in a [[Lloyd's Bank]] branch on the corner of [[Baker Street]] and [[Marylebone Road]]. It belongs to a black militant gangster, [[Michael X]], and contains compromising photos of [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/how-mi5-raided-a-bank-to-get-pictures-of-princess-margaret-6584054.html|title=How MI5 raided a bank to get pictures of Princess Margaret|work=[[Evening Standard]]|location=London|date=20 May 2007|access-date=4 June 2021}}</ref> which he is keeping as insurance to keep the British authorities off his back. Martine Love, an ex-model who is romantically involved with MI5 agent Tim Everett, is caught at [[Heathrow Airport]] smuggling drugs into the country, and to avoid going to jail, she makes a deal with the authorities whereby she agrees to retrieve the photos.\n\nMartine approaches her friend Terry, a struggling [[East London]] car salesman with criminal contacts, and tells him that if he can assemble the gang to help her rob the bank, he will be richly rewarded, though she does not tell him about the photos in the deposit box. Terry recruits a small team, including one of his own workers, Eddie, Dave, Kevin, Bambas, and Guy Singer.  While scouting the bank, Dave runs into local gangster Lew Vogel, for whom he made several pornographic films.\n\nThe gang rents a leather goods shop near the bank and tunnels into the vault.  They loot the safety deposit boxes, but Terry becomes suspicious when Martine seems to display particular interest in one box and eventually discovers the photos. The police are alerted to the robbery by a ham radio operator who overhears the gang's walkie-talkie communications, but by the time they locate the bank, the gang has already fled. The robbery rattles many important underworld figures who had used the bank, including Lew Vogel, who kept a ledger of police payoffs inside.  He notifies a furious Michael X in [[Trinidad]], who correctly suspects [[Gale Benson]]\u2014 the lover of his associate [[Hakim Jamal]]\u2014of spying for MI5, and subsequently murders her. Vogel decides that Dave\u2019s presence outside that particular bank was not a coincidence, and has him kidnapped and tortured for information by sand blasting an ankle and one of his legs. Dave gives in, and Lew has Gerald Pyke and Nick Burton \u2014 two corrupt policemen working on his payroll, kidnap Eddie at Terry's garage. Meanwhile, Terry discovers explicit photographs of important government officials among their loot and uses them to secure passports and new identities for the gang.\n\nVogel's men track down and murder Bambas and Guy Singer. Eddie refuses to cooperate with Vogel, who has Gerald execute Dave and threatens to kill Eddie unless Terry delivers the ledger to him; Terry agrees to meet up with Vogel at Paddington Station to exchange the ledger for Eddie. He arranges for the meeting to happen at the same time as he will be picking up the new passports and immunity of prosecution of the robbery from the MI5 in exchange for the pictures of Princess Margaret. Meanwhile, Terry sends Kevin to honest cop Roy Given with a page torn from the ledger. Vogel becomes spooked and tries to flee, but Terry attacks and beats him\u2014only to be arrested by the police. However, Given has Terry released and uses the information he supplied to arrest Lew, Gerald and Nick. In Trinidad, Michael X is arrested as well and after Benson body is found in a shallow grave his house is burned down. Eddie inherits Terry's car dealership, while Kevin and Martine prepare to begin new lives with their share of the money. Terry and his family leave England and enjoy a carefree life on a boat in a sunny location.\n\nIt is later revealed Vogel's ledger eventually causes Scotland Yard to undergo a major corruption purge in the police force. The activities of Sonia Bern's brothels make several senior officials resign. Michael X is hanged in Trinidad in 1975 for the murder of Gale Benson and his file in the British National Archive remains classified until 2054. Lew Vogel is sentenced to 8 years in prison. Hakim Jamal is murdered in 1973. The murders of both Bambas and Guy Singer are never solved. The loot taken from the robbery exceeds that of the Great Train Robbery at \u00a34 million. Over 100 safe deposit holders refuse to identify their losses as most of them are criminals. A disclaimer at the end of the film ironically remarks that the names of many of the persons involved in the film have been changed to protect the guilty.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Terry Leather\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as Martine Love\n* [[Richard Lintern]] as Tim Everett\n* [[Keeley Hawes]] as Wendy Leather\n* [[Stephen Campbell Moore]] as Kevin Swain\n* [[Michael Jibson]] as Eddie Burton\n* [[Georgia Taylor]] as Ingrid Burton\n* [[Daniel Mays]] as Dave Shilling\n* [[David Suchet]] as Lew Vogel\n* [[Peter de Jersey]] as Michael Abdul Malik/[[Michael X]]\n* [[Gerard Horan]] as Det.

A gang tunnelled into a branch of [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] at the junction of Baker Street and Marylebone Road in London on the night of 11 September 1971 and robbed the safe deposit boxes that were stored in the vault. The robbers had rented a leather goods shop named Le Sac two doors down from the bank, and tunnelled approximately 40 feet (12 metres), passing under the Chicken Inn restaurant that was located between the shop and the bank.<ref name=mirrorstory/>  The tunnelling took three weeks, working on weekends.<ref name=mirrorstory/>\n\n[[Ham radio]] operator Robert Rowlands overheard conversations between the robbers and their rooftop lookout. He contacted police and tape-recorded the conversations, which were subsequently made public. The film includes lines recorded by Rowlands, such as the lookout's comment that \"money may be your god, but it's not mine, and I'm fucking off.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/11/film.ukcrime|title=Untold story of Baker Street bank robbery|date=11 March 2007|website=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\nThe film's producers said that they have a source, identified in press reports as George McIndoe, who was an executive producer.<ref name=\"Tel20080215\">{{cite news | last = Lawrence | first = Will | title = Revisiting the riddle of Baker Street |work=The Daily Telegraph  | date = 15 February 2008 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3671166/Revisiting-the-riddle-of-Baker-Street.html | access-date = 4 June 2021 | location=London}}</ref> McIndoe claimed that he had talked with two of the gang, who even visited the film set.<ref name=\"Herald\">Byrnes, Paul (26 July 2008) [https://www.smh.com.au/news/film-reviews/the-bank-job/2008/07/25/1216492719757.html \"Review: The Bank Job\"], ''Sydney Morning Herald''</ref> The film's plot includes a fictional issue of a D-Notice by MI5, requesting no further press reports on grounds of national security because a safe deposit box holding sexually compromising pictures of [[Princess Margaret]].<ref name=\"Tel20080215\" /> The possible connection to [[Michael X]] is  based on material from McIndoe, who said he had spoken to two men who claimed they were involved robbers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=J.R.|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2008/03/07/whats-the-real-story-behind-the-bank-job|title=What's the real story behind ''The Bank Job''?|work=Chicago Reader|date=7 March 2008|access-date=4 June 2021}}</ref> The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' interviewed a convicted robber who claims to be a perpetrator, and he indicated that embarrassing photos were found but deliberately left behind for the police, including child pornography.<ref name=mirrorstory/> The film-makers acknowledged that they made up the character Martine, and David Denby wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that it is \"impossible to say how much of the film's story is true\".<ref>{{cite news | last = Denby | first = David | title = Class Acts: 'The Bank Job' and 'The Duchess of Langeais' |work=The New Yorker | date = 10 March 2008 | url = https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2008/03/10/080310crci_cinema_denby | access-date =17 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe fictional character of Lew Vogel may allude to pornographer and racketeer [[Bernie Silver]],<ref name=\"Herald\"/> a major figure in [[Soho]] in the 1960s and early 1970s who was imprisoned in 1975 for the 1956 murder of Tommy \"Scarface\" Smithson, and also to later events surrounding his associate pornographer [[James Humphreys (pornographer)|James Humphreys]].
