The film follows scientists as they use experimental technology to enter the mind of a comatose serial killer in order to locate where he has hidden his latest kidnap victim.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews upon its release, with critics praising the visuals, direction, make-up, costumes and D'Onofrio's performance, while criticizing the plot, an emphasis on style rather than substance, and masochistic creation. Despite the critical reception, the film was a box office success, grossing over $104 million against a $33 million budget, and it earned a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Child psychology|Child psychologist]] Catherine Deane is hired to conduct an experimental [[virtual reality]] treatment for [[coma]] patients: a \"Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System\" device managed by doctors Henry West and Miriam Kent that allows her to enter a comatose [[mind]] and attempt to coax them into consciousness. The technology is funded by the parents of her patient, Edward Baines, a young boy left comatose by a viral infection that causes an unusual form of [[schizophrenia]]. Despite Deane's lack of progress, West and Kent reject Deane's suggestion to reverse the feed to bring Baines into her mind, fearing the consequences of him experiencing an unfamiliar world.\n\n[[Serial killer]] Carl Rudolph Stargher traps his victims in a [[prison cell|cell]] in the form of a [[glass]] enclosure that slowly fills with water by means of an automatic timer, then uses a hoist in his basement to suspend himself above their bodies while watching the recorded video of their deaths. He succumbs to the same schizophrenic illness and falls into a [[coma]] just as the [[FBI]] identifies him, leaving them without any leads as to the location of his latest victim, Julia Hickson. After learning of this experimental technology, Agent Peter Novak persuades Deane to enter Stargher's mind and discover Hickson's location.\n\nDeane enters the dark [[Dream world (plot device)|dreamscape]] of Stargher's twisted psyche, filled with doll-like versions of his victims. Stargher's innocent side manifests as Young Stargher and leads Deane through his memories of [[child abuse|abuse]] he suffered at the hands of his sadistic father. Deane nurtures Young Stargher in hopes of getting Hickson's location but she is thwarted by another manifestation: King Stargher, a demonic idealization of his murderous side that dominates the dreamscape. King Stargher torments Deane until she forgets [[Lucid dream|the world is not real]]. Dr. West discovers this while monitoring Deane's vitals. He warns that what happens to Deane while she is integrated into Stargher's mindscape will inflict neurological damage on her real body. Novak volunteers to enter Stargher's mind to make Deane remember herself.\n\nInside Stargher's mind, Novak is captured and subjected to King Stargher's torture while Deane looks on as Stargher's servant. Novak reminds Deane of a painful memory of her younger brother who died after a 6-month coma due to a car accident during her college years to reawaken her awareness that she is in Stargher's mind. Deane breaks free of Stargher's hold and stabs King Stargher to free Novak. During their escape, Novak sees a version of the glass enclosure with the same insignia as the hoist in Stargher's basement. Novak's team discovers that after the hoist's previous owner went bankrupt, the government hired Stargher to seal up his property. Novak races to the property and finds Hickson treading water in the enclosure and breathing through a pipe. Novak breaks the glass wall and rescues Hickson.\n\nDeane, now sympathetic to Young Stargher, locks her colleagues out and reverses the feed of the device to pull Stargher's mind into her own. She presents a comforting paradise to Young Stargher but he knows it is only a temporary reprieve from King Stargher. He shifts to Adult Stargher to relate a childhood story of when he drowned an injured bird as a [[Coup de gr\u00e2ce|mercy killing]] to prevent its torture at his father's hands. King Stargher intrudes as a [[Serpent (Bible)|scaly snake-man]] but this time, Deane is in control and she beats him to a bloody pulp before impaling him with a sword. However, Young Stargher exhibits the same injuries as King Stargher, and killing either manifestation kills Stargher. Adult Stargher reminds her of the story of the bird and implores her to \"save\" him. Deane carries Young Stargher into a pool, putting him out of his misery as Stargher dies in the real world.\n\nIn the aftermath, Deane and Novak meet outside of Stargher's house. The FBI has officially excluded the mind technology from their inquiry and Deane has gotten approval to use the reverse feed on Edward Baines. The final scene is of Baines walking to embrace Deane inside the paradise of Deane's mindscape.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Datlow | first1=Ellen | last2=Windling | first2=Terri | year=2001 | title=The Year's Best Fantasy and Horror: Fourteenth Annual Collection | edition=14 | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=0-312-27544-7 | page=xc | url=https://archive.org/details/yearsbestfantasy00terr_1 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Dr. Catherine Deane\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Carl Rudolph Stargher\n** [[Jake Thomas]] as Young Carl Rudolph Stargher\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Special Agent Peter Novak\n* [[Jake Weber]] as Special Agent Gordon Ramsey\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Henry West\n* [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] as Dr. Miriam Kent\n* [[Tara Subkoff]] as Julia Hickson\n* [[Catherine Sutherland]] as Anne Marie Vicksey\n* [[Colton James]] as Edward Baines\n* [[Musetta Vander]] as Ella Baines\n* [[Patrick Bauchau]] as Lucien Baines\n* [[James Gammon]] as Teddy Lee\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Cole\n* [[Lauri Johnson]] as Mrs. Hickson\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Dr. Reid\n* [[Kim Chizevsky-Nicholls]] as Stargher's victim\n* [[Gareth Williams (actor)|Gareth Williams]] as Stargher's father\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as John Tracy\n}}\n\n==Production==\nDirector Tarsem Singh asked Tara Subkoff, during her interview, if she could swim, to which she responded that she could and that she had been a lifeguard.

A scene in which a horse is split into sections by falling glass panels was inspired by the works of [[British people|British]] artist [[Damien Hirst]].

During a scene, Jennifer Lopez falls asleep watching a film; the film is ''[[Fantastic Planet]]''.\n\nIn the scene where Catherine talks with Carl while he is \"cleaning\" his first victim, the scenery resembles the music video \"Losing My Religion\" by [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]] The scene where Peter Novak first enters the mind of Carl Stargher, and is confronted by three women with open mouths to the sky is based on the painting ''[[Dawn (painting)|Dawn]]'' by Norwegian painter [[Odd Nerdrum]]. The scene when Catherine Deane is chasing Carl through a stone hallway, right before she enters the room with the horse, is based on a painting by [[H. R. Giger]] called \"Schacht\".\n\nA psychiatrist entering the dreams of an insane patient in order to take control of the dreams and so to cure the patient's mind (this being a very risky attempt, because the insanity may prevail during such \"neuro-participatory therapy\") was described in the novella ''[[The Dream Master|He Who Shapes]]'' (1965) by [[Roger Zelazny]], but the film ''[[Dreamscape (1984 film)|Dreamscape]]'' (1984), subsequently developed from Zelazny's basic idea, had a completely different plot.\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reaction to ''The Cell'' has been mixed, with a score of 45% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 165 reviews, and an average rating of 5.6/10  with the site's consensus reporting that \"''The Cell'' offers disturbing, stunning eye candy, but its visual pleasures are no match for a confused storyline that undermines the movie's inventive aesthetic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_cell_2000/|title=The Cell|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319091841/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_cell_2000/|archive-date=2012-03-19}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-cell |title = The Cell Reviews - Metacritic|website = [[Metacritic]]}}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"C+\" on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nOne of the most positive reviews came from [[Roger Ebert]], who awarded the film four stars out of four, writing: \"For all of its visual [[pyrotechnics]], it's also a story where we care about the characters; there's a lot at stake at the end, and we're involved.
