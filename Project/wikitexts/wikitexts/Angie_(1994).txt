It was produced by [[Caravan Pictures]] and distributed by [[Hollywood Pictures]]. It is based on the 1991 novel ''Angie, I Says'' by Avra Wing,<ref name=lat/> which was a [[New York Times Notable Book]] of 1991. The film received mixed to negative reviews and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $9.4 million against its $26 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=June 2015}}\nAngie is an office worker who lives in the [[Bensonhurst]] section of [[Brooklyn, New York]] and dreams of a better life. After learning that she is pregnant by her boyfriend Vinnie, she decides that she will have the baby, but not Vinnie as a husband.\n\nThis turns the entire neighborhood upside down and starts her on a journey of self-discovery, including a love affair with a man named Noel who she meets at an art museum. Even her best friend Tina has trouble understanding her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Angie <ref name=lat/>\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Vinnie\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Noel\n* [[Aida Turturro]] as Tina\n* Leonard Spinelli as Tina\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Frank\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Museum Guard\n* [[Jenny O'Hara]] as Kathy\n* [[Margaret Cho]] as Admissions Nurse\n\n==Production==\n20th Century Fox films head [[Joe Roth]], production president [[Roger Birnbaum]] and producer Larry Brezner had \"Angie, I Says\" under development. Todd Graff had written the screenplay for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. The adaptation was placed into turnaround. Roth and Birnbaum had left for an independent label at Disney, [[Caravan Pictures]], and were able to get the  \"Angie, I Says\" adaptation moved over. Because of scheduling conflicts with her role in [[Abel Ferrara]]'s movie ''[[Dangerous Game (1993 film)|Dangerous Game]]'', which is also produced by her company, [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]], she dropped out of the then [[Jonathan Kaplan]]-directed movie. Madonna had wanted them to push back production on the film, but given that it was a winter story, Caravan wanted to film it in winter, then debut it in winter. She bowed out as they also took issue with her lack of acting experience. The lead role was then offered to [[Geena Davis]].<ref name=lat>{{cite news |last1=Eller |first1=Claudia |title=Madonna faxes Roth her wrath |url=https://variety.com/1992/film/news/madonna-faxes-roth-her-wrath-102048/ |access-date=September 6, 2017 |work=Variety |date=December 14, 1992}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe film opened to mixed reviews and was a [[box office bomb]].
