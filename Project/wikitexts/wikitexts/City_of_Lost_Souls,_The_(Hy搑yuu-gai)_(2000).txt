They attempt to raise money by robbing a cockfight but end up robbing drugs bought by the yakuza Fushimi of the Okayama Group from a [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese triad]] boss named Ko moments before. Fushimi's boss demands his finger but Fushimi kills him and takes over his position with the aid of his soldier Yamazaki.\n\nMario and Kei sell the drugs to a local Brazilian TV broadcaster, who attempts to sell the drugs back to Ko but is beaten then given a message that there is a million-yen reward for Mario and Kei. Mario and Kei fly to Okinawa and are about to stow aboard a boat bound for Tapei then escape to Australia with the aid of their fake passports, but Fushimi abducts Mario's former lover Lucia's blind foster daughter Carla, so Mario and Kei return to Tokyo.\n\nKei is captured on the street by Riku and brought to Ko, who has always been in love with her. Fushimi and Yamazaki arrive and Ko challenges Fushimi to a ping-pong match, then uses a hidden button to shoot a spinning blade at Fushimi, which Fushimi dodges as Yamazaki shoots and kills Ko. The two yakuza take Kei with them, but Mario arrives and rescues Carla from the Okayama Group's offices before killing Fushimi and rescuing Kei.\n\nMario and Kei attempt to sail to Taiwan but Carla catches them and shoots them dead with a rifle. A video montage during the credits reveals that Yamazaki and Riku become lovers.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Teah]] as Mario\n*[[Michelle Reis]] as Kei\n*[[Patricia Manterola]] as Lucia\n*[[Mitsuhiro Oikawa]] as Ko\n*[[Koji Kikkawa]] as Fushimi\n*[[Ren Osugi]]\n*[[Akaji Maro]]\n*[[Anatoli Krasnov]] as Khodoloskii\n*[[Sebastian DeVicente]] as Rikardo\n*[[Terence Yin]] as Riku\n*[[Atsushi Okuno]] as Carlos\n*[[Akira Emoto]] as Kuwata\n*[[Eugene Nomura]] as Yamazaki\n*[[Marcio Rosario]] as Sanchez\n*[[Ryuushi Mizukami]] as Ide\n*[[Takeshi Nakajima]]\n*[[Tokitoshi Shiota]] as Beaten chicken owner\n\n==Other credits==\n*Produced by:\n**Kazunari Hashiguchi - producer\n**Toshiki Kimura - producer\n**Yasuyoshi Tokuma - executive producer\n**Tsutomu Tsuchikawa - planner: Daiei\n**Hiroshi Yamamoto - producer\n*Casting: Donna Brower\n*Production Design: Akira Ishige\n*Art Direction: Reiko Kobayashi\n*Assistant Director: Masato Tanno\n*US set decorator: Isabelle Stamper\n*Sound Department: Kenji Shibazaki - sound\n\n==Reception==\nIn a positive review of the film, Jesper Sharp of Midnight Eye wrote, \"Colourful and exotic or cluttered and chaotic, even if the whole never quite manages to add up to the sum of its parts and lacks the weight of some of his earlier work, Takashi Miike on cruise-control is still a devastating force.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/the-city-of-lost-souls/|title = Midnight Eye review: The City of Lost Souls (Hyoryugai, 2000, Takashi MIIKE)}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0246498|The City of Lost Souls}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|1110769-city_of_lost_souls}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n{{Takashi Miike}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:City of Lost Souls, The}}\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 action films]]\n[[Category:2000 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about child abduction in Japan]]\n[[Category:Films based on Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Takashi Miike]]\n[[Category:Films set in S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n[[Category:Films set in Okinawa Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Films set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Japanese action films]]\n[[Category:Japanese crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Portuguese-language films]]\n[[Category:Cockfighting in film]]\n[[Category:Triad films]]\n[[Category:Yakuza films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese films]]\n[[Category:2000s Hong Kong films]]\n\n\n{{2000s-Japan-film-stub}}\n{{crime-thriller-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
