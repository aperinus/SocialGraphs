For her performance, Garland was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], but lost to [[Grace Kelly]] for ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]''.\n\nIt was the second of four official adaptations of ''A Star Is Born'', with the first in [[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|1937]] starring [[Janet Gaynor]] and [[Fredric March]], the third in [[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|1976]] starring [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]], and the fourth in [[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|2018]] starring [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Bradley Cooper]].\n\nIn 2000, the 1954 film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite press release |last=D'Ooge |first=Craig |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-200/librarian-of-congress-names-25-more-films-to-national-film-registry/2000-12-27/ |title=Librarian of Congress Names 25 More Films to National Film Registry |agency=Library of Congress |date=December 27, 2000 |access-date=December 9, 2020}}</ref> The film ranked #43 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions|100 Years...100 Passions]] list in 2002 and #7 on its [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals|list of greatest musicals]] in 2006. The song \"[[The Man That Got Away]]\" was ranked #11 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs|AFI's list of 100 top songs]] in films.\n\n== Plot ==\nEsther Blodgett is a talented aspiring singer with a band, and Norman Maine is a former [[matin\u00e9e idol]] whose career is beginning to decline. When he arrives intoxicated at a function at the [[Shrine Auditorium]], studio publicist Matt Libby attempts to keep him offstage. After an angry exchange, Norman rushes away and bursts onto a stage where an orchestra is performing. Blodgett takes him by the hand and pretends he is part of the act, thereby turning a potentially embarrassing and disruptive moment into an opportunity for the audience to greet Norman with applause.\n\nRealizing that Esther has saved him from public humiliation, Norman thanks her and draws a heart on the wall with her lipstick. He invites her to dinner, and later watches her perform in an after-hours club. He recognizes her impressive talent, urges her to follow her dream, and convinces her she can break into movies. Esther is surprised that someone of Norman's stature sees something special in her. He offers her a screen test and advises her to \"sleep on it\", promising to call her the next day. Esther tells Danny McGuire, her bandmate, that she is quitting their upcoming gig to pursue movies in L.A. Thinking she is crazy, he tries to talk her out of it, but Esther is determined. Norman is called away early in the morning to filming and then falls ill. He attempts to get a message to Esther but cannot remember her address. When she does not hear from him, she suspects he was insincere. Not disheartened, she takes jobs as a carhop and TV commercial singer to make ends meet, convinced she can make it with or without Norman.\n\nNorman tries to find Esther, who has had to move from her apartment. Then he hears her singing on a television commercial and tracks her down. Studio head Oliver Niles believes Esther is just a passing fancy for the actor, but casts her in a small film role. The studio arbitrarily changes her name to Vicki Lester, which she finds out when she tries to pick up her paycheck. When Norman finally gets Niles to hear \"Vicki\" sing, he is impressed and she is cast in an important musical film, making her a huge success. Her relationship with Norman flourishes, and they wed.\n\nAs Vicki's career continues to flourish, Norman finds himself unemployed and going downhill fast\u2014an alcoholic in a tough new film business with no tolerance for alcoholics. Norman arrives, late and drunk, in the middle of Vicki's [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] acceptance speech. He interrupts her speech, rambling and pacing back and forth in front of her. While begging for work from the assembled and embarrassed Hollywood community, he accidentally strikes Vicki in the face.\n\nVicki continues working and tells Oliver that Norman has entered a sanitarium. After supporting him for so long, she worries about the effect of Norman's alcoholism on her, while acknowledging that he is trying very hard to overcome his addiction. Niles is amenable to offering Norman work, a gesture for which Vicki is grateful, thinking this may be just the boost her husband needs. At the racetrack, Norman runs into Libby, who taunts him and accuses him of living on Vicki's earnings. The resulting fight prompts Norman to go on a drinking binge; he is eventually arrested for being drunk and disorderly and receives ninety days in the city jail. Vicki bails him out and brings him home, where they are joined by Niles. Norman goes to bed but overhears Vicki telling Niles she will give up her career to take care of him. He also hears Oliver say that Norman ruined his own career with his drinking. Finally realizing what he has done to himself, Vicki, his career, and the people around him, Norman leaves his bed, tells Vicki cheerfully that he is going to go for a swim, walks into the ocean, and drowns himself.\n\nAt Norman's funeral, Vicki is mobbed by reporters and insensitive fans. Despondent, Vicki becomes a recluse and refuses to see anyone. Finally, her old bandmate Danny convinces her she needs to attend a charity function because she constitutes the only good work Norman did and which he died trying to save. At the Shrine Auditorium, she notices the heart Norman drew on the wall on the night they met and for a moment seems to lose her composure. When she arrives on stage, the master of ceremonies tells her the event is being broadcast worldwide, and asks her to say a few words to her fans. She says, \"Hello, everybody. This is Mrs. Norman Maine\", which prompts the crowd into a standing ovation.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Judy Garland]] as Esther Maine / Esther Blodgett / Vicki Lester\n* [[James Mason]] as Norman Maine (Ernest Gubbins)\n* [[Jack Carson]] as Matt Libby\n* [[Charles Bickford]] as Oliver Niles\n* [[Tommy Noonan]] as Danny McGuire\n* [[Amanda Blake]] as Susan Etting, Premier Radio Host\n* [[Lucy Marlow]] as Lola Lavery\n* [[Irving Bacon]] as Graves\n* [[Hazel Shermet]] as Libby's Secretary\n* [[Percy Helton]] as William Gregory (uncredited)\n* [[Nancy Kulp]] as Esther's neighbor (uncredited)\n* [[Frank Puglia]] as Bruno (uncredited)\n* [[Strother Martin]] as Delivery Boy (uncredited)\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Judy Garland filming A Star Is Born.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Judy Garland on location filming a scene as a restaurant [[carhop]]]]\nIn December 1952, George Cukor was approached by [[Sid Luft]], who proposed the director helm a musical remake of the 1937 film ''A Star Is Born'', with his then wife Judy Garland in the lead role.{{sfn|McGilligan|1991|p=217}} Garland previously had portrayed Vicki Lester in a December 1942 [[Lux Radio Theater]] broadcast with [[Walter Pidgeon]], and she and Luft, along with several associates, had formed Transcona Enterprises specifically to produce the project on screen.<ref name=Database>{{cite web |title=Judy Garland Database film review: \"A Star Is Born\" |url-status=dead |url=http://www.jgdb.com/star.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120085053/http://jgdb.com/star.htm |archive-date=January 20, 2009}}</ref> Cukor had declined to direct the original film because it was too similar to his 1932 work ''[[What Price Hollywood?]]'', but the opportunity to direct his first [[Technicolor]] film and first musical film, work with screenwriter [[Moss Hart]], and especially with Garland, appealed to him, and he accepted.{{sfn|McGilligan|1991|pp=217\u2013218}} It was Garland's first film since leaving [[MGM]].<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite news |last=Green |first=Abel |author-link=Abel Green |title=Film Reviews: A Star Is Born |url=https://archive.org/stream/variety195-1954-09#page/n311/mode/1up |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=6 |date=September 29, 1954 |access-date=November 29, 2020 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nGetting the updated film to the screen proved to be a challenge. Cukor wanted [[Cary Grant]], whom he had directed three times before, for the male lead, and went so far as to read the entire script with him. Grant, while agreeing it was the role of a lifetime, was more interested in traveling with wife [[Betsy Drake]], and steadfastly refused the role (he also turned down ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'').<ref name=\"Jaynes-Trach\">Jaynes, Barbara Grant; Trachtenberg, Robert.

Burbank, California: [[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM) and [[Turner Entertainment]]. 2004.</ref> He was also concerned about Garland's reputation for unreliability; Cukor never forgave Grant for declining the role. The director then suggested either [[Humphrey Bogart]] or [[Frank Sinatra]] for the part, but [[Jack L. Warner]] rejected both. Garland suggested [[John Hodiak]] (with whom she had previously worked in ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' eight years earlier) for the part, but Hodiak was unavailable at the time. [[Stewart Granger]] was the frontrunner for a time, but withdrew when he was unable to adjust to Cukor's habit of acting scenes as a form of direction.{{sfn|McGilligan|1991|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\nUltimately, [[James Mason]] was signed, and filming began on October 12, 1953. As the months passed, Cukor was forced to deal not only with constant script changes but an unstable leading lady, who was plagued by chemical dependencies, significant weight fluctuations, illnesses, and hypochondria.{{sfn|McGilligan|1991|pp=224\u2013226}} After considerable footage had been shot, studio executives decided the film should be the first Warner Brothers motion picture to use [[CinemaScope]], necessitating everything be scrapped and filmed again.<ref name=\"Database\" />\n\nIn March 1954, a rough cut still missing several musical numbers was assembled, and Cukor had mixed feelings about it. When the last scene was filmed in the early morning hours of July 28, 1954, Cukor had already departed the production and was unwinding in Europe.{{sfn|McGilligan|1991|p=226}} The long \"Born in a Trunk\" sequence was added after Cukor had left, supervised by Garland's professional mentor [[Roger Edens]].\n\nThe first test screening the following month ran to 196 minutes, and despite ecstatic feedback from the audience, Cukor and editor Folmar Blangsted trimmed it to 182 minutes for its New York premiere in October. The reviews were excellent, but Warner executives, concerned the running time would limit the number of daily showings, made drastic cuts without Cukor, who had departed for India to scout locations for ''[[Bhowani Junction (film)|Bhowani Junction]]''. At its final running time of 154 minutes, the film lost two major musical numbers and crucial dramatic scenes; Cukor called it \"very painful\" to watch.{{sfn|McGilligan|1991|pp=236\u2013237}}\n\n''A Star Is Born'' cost more than $5 million to produce,<ref name=\"mojo\"/> making it one of the more expensive films made in Hollywood at that time.\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:A Star Is Born (1954) - trailer.webm|thumb|thumbtime=58|the film's trailer.]]\nOn October 22, 1954, it was reported that [[Warner Bros.]] had removed 27 minutes from the film, and the new version would be sent back to theaters on November 1.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pryor |first=Thomas M. |title=Warners To Cut 'A Star is Born' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/10/23/archives/warners-to-cut-a-star-is-born-27-minutes-trimmed-from-3hour-film.html |url-access=subscription |work=The New York Times |page=13 |date=October 23, 1954 |access-date=December 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== 1983 restoration ===\nIn October 1981, an [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] tribute to Ira Gershwin was held, in which the musical number \"[[The Man That Got Away]]\" was screened.

It was originally released by [[Columbia Records]] in 1954 in 10-inch 78 rpm and 12-inch {{sfrac|33|1|3}} rpm editions, and also on 7-inch 45 rpm records.\n\nIn 1988, Columbia released the soundtrack on compact disc, taking the overture and the main musical numbers directly from the film's stereo soundtrack due to the fact no stereo pre-recordings for the soundtrack master existed for this number.\n\nIn 2004, in commemoration of the film's 50th anniversary, Columbia, [[Legacy Recordings]], and Sony Music Soundtrax released a nearly complete, digitally-remastered, expanded edition of the soundtrack. Due to the lack of a complete multitrack version of all songs and score from the film, the CD includes a mix of monaural and stereo elements in order to make as complete a soundtrack as possible.\n\nBecause some of the songs were not complete on the film soundtrack, as well as the fact that many of the original music stems had been lost or destroyed subsequent to original mono mixdown, numbers such as \"Here's What I'm Here For\" and \"Lose That Long Face\" are taken from the original mono LP masters.\n\nOther numbers such as \"Gotta Have Me Go with You\" are mostly in stereo, save for brief sections where the mono soundtrack album master was used in order to remove various endemic plot-related sound effects from the track. All of the instrumental tracks are in mono as well due to the fact that the original elements have been lost or destroyed.\n\nThe 2004 soundtrack also includes three vocal outtakes \u2013 an alternative vocal for the reprise of \"It's a New World\" that Esther sings while Norman goes for his final swim; \"When My Sugar Walks Down the Street\", which was intended to be part of the \"Born in a Trunk\" sequence, but was deleted for time constraints; and \"The Trinidad Coconut Oil Shampoo Commercial\", which was taken from the only surviving recording of the complete track, a very worn acetate artist reference disc.\n\nIn addition, much of the instrumental portion of the 2004 soundtrack contains partial or whole outtakes. This CD also sees the first CD release of the complete version of \"Gotta Have Me Go with You\" with the full introduction, as well as \"The Man That Got Away\" with an expanded introduction not used in the original film.\n\nThe original Columbia 1954 mono vinyl version of the soundtrack has been released on CD in Britain by [[Prism Leisure Corporation|Prism Leisure]] and is available for digital download. This version includes bonus tracks of Judy Garland's [[Decca Records|Decca]] recordings of songs from other films.\n\n===1954 soundtrack release===\n*\"Gotta Have Me Go with You\" ([[Harold Arlen]] and [[Ira Gershwin]])\n*\"[[The Man That Got Away]]\" (Arlen and Gershwin)\n*\"Born in a Trunk\" ([[Roger Edens]] (music) and [[Leonard Gershe]] (lyrics))<ref name=\"gersheletter\">Gershe received sole credit due to a contractual issue.
