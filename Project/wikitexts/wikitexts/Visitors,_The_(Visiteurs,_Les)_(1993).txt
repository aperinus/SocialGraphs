In this comedy, a 12th-century [[knight]] and his [[squire]] [[Time travel|travel in time]] to the end of the 20th century and find themselves adrift in modern society.\n\n''Les Visiteurs'' was the highest-grossing film in France in 1993 and remains the [[List of highest-grossing films in France|fourteenth highest grossing film in the country today]]. The publicity for the film used the tagline ''Ils ne sont pas n\u00e9s d'hier'' (\"They weren't born yesterday\"). Reno and Clavier reprised their roles in a [[Les Visiteurs II|sequel]] in 1998, the American remake ''[[Just Visiting (film)|Just Visiting]]'' in 2001 and a [[The Visitors: Bastille Day|second sequel]] in 2016. The Castle of Ermenonville<!--Q952229-->, in [[Oise]] d\u00e9partement, served as decoration for the castle of Montmirail in the current time and the [[Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne]] for medieval period.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the year 1123, Godefroy Amaury de Malf\u00eate, Count of [[Apremont, Oise|Apremont]] and Papincourt, saves the life of his beloved sovereign, [[Monarch|King]] [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI \"Le Gros\"]] (''\"The Fat\"'') from the sword of a \"horribilis\" Englishman.\n\nFor this action of bravery, the King makes him [[Count]] of Montmirail and promises him the woman he loves, the beautiful Fr\u00e9n\u00e9gonde de Pouille. On his way to the castle to marry Fr\u00e9n\u00e9gonde, Godefroy takes a witch prisoner, and she drugs his drinking flask. Hallucinating, he believes the [[Duke]] of Pouille, father of his future wife, is a ferocious bear, and kills him with a crossbow bolt. During the Duke's funeral, Fr\u00e9n\u00e9gonde refuses to marry Godefroy because of the tragedy; meanwhile, Godefroy's servant, the disreputable Jacquouille la Fripouille, steals the Duke's jewels at end of the funeral.\n\nIn an attempt to repair his mistake, Godefroy asks the wizard Eusebius to send him back in time to a moment before he shot the Duke. The old wizard muddles his magical spell, accidentally sending Godefroy and Jacquouille to the year 1992. There, they immediately run into trouble. Godefroy attacks a postman driving his car, mistaking him for a Moor in a devil's chariot; when he meets his descendant, B\u00e9atrice de Montmirail, an aristocrat who looks exactly like Fr\u00e9n\u00e9gonde, she calls the [[National Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]], who first imprison him, then as B\u00e9atrice thinks Godefroy is her distant cousin suffering from amnesia, take him to a mental hospital. Jacquouille, meanwhile, is befriended by Ginette la Clocharde (\"Ginette the Tramp\" in French), an attractive vagrant they meet early in their adventure.\n\nB\u00e9atrice, thinking Godefroy to be her long-lost stuntman cousin Hubert, gets Godefroy out of the mental hospital and takes them back to her home, much to her husband (who greatly dislikes the fact of the two being in their home) Jean-Pierre's dismay. There, various culture-shock comedy ensues as Godefroy and Jacquouille attempt to fathom modern household appliances, such as flooding the bathroom by leaving the tap open, using an umbrella as a pike to roast a  leg of lamb and setting it on fire, washing their hands in the toilet, trashing the bathroom during their baths and wasting all of the family's 6,000 [[French franc|FF]] [[Chanel No. 5]], greatly angering Jean-Pierre.\n\nSeeing the family seal on Godefroy's hand, Beatrice assumes he stole the jewel from the castle de Montmirail, now renovated into an expensive hotel. They go there and meet the owner of the castle, the effete Jacques-Henri Jacquard, the unwitting descendant and close likeness of Jacquouille (they react to each other with mutual disgust). The jewel on Godefroy's hand starts to burn as they get closer to the castle, where the present-day version of the seal is. The two seals explode and destroy Jacquard's brand new [[Range Rover#First generation .281970.E2.80.931996.29|Range Rover]].\n\nGodefroy books a room for the night and reopens a secret passage known only to him. There he finds a letter telling him to go to a certain address, where an aged Monsieur Ferdinand, the last descendant of the wizard Eusebius, gives him the potion that will return him to the year 1123. Jacquouille, however, wants to stay, enjoying Ginette's company and having proved more adaptable than Godefroy in discovering toothpaste, modern clothing and other amenities of the future. Furious at his behavior, Godefroy finally brings him to the hotel room by force.\n\nWhile Godefroy is talking with B\u00e9atrice, Jacquouille swaps jackets with his descendant, closes the curtains, dims the lights, drugs Jacquard and puts him on the bed in his place. In the dark, Godefroy gives Jacquard (thinking it is Jacquouille) the potion which then sends him back to the year 1123. Godefroy equally comes back just in time to stop himself from shooting Fr\u00e9n\u00e9gonde's father, and the deflected [[crossbow]] bolt kills the witch who caused the whole misadventure by drugging Godefroy's [[Canteen (bottle)|flask]]. The bewildered Jacquard finds himself stranded in the past in the role of Godefroy's servant as Godefroy leaves on horseback with Fr\u00e9n\u00e9gonde.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Christian Clavier]]: Jacquouille la Fripouille (in English, Jacquasse la Crasse) / Jacques-Henri Jacquard\n* [[Jean Reno]]: Godefroy de Montmirail, Count of Montmirail, Apremont and Papincourt\n* [[Val\u00e9rie Lemercier]]: Fr\u00e9n\u00e9gonde de Pouille / B\u00e9atrice de Montmirail\n* [[Christian Bujeau]]: Jean-Pierre Goulard\n* [[Marie-Anne Chazel]]: Ginette la Clocharde\n* [[Isabelle Nanty]]: Fabienne Morlot\n* [[G\u00e9rard S\u00e9ty]]: Edgar Bernay\n* [[Didier Pain]]: [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI le Gros ''(the Fat)'']]\n* [[Jean-Paul Muel]]: Mar\u00e9chal-des-Logis Gibon\n* [[Arielle S\u00e9m\u00e9noff]]: Jacqueline\n* [[Michel Peyrelon]]: \u00c9douard Bernay\n* Pierre Vial: Eusebius the Wizard / Monsieur Ferdinand\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Lalande]]: The priest\n* [[Didier B\u00e9nureau]]: Doctor Beauvin\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Baptiste]]: Freddy\n\n==Reception==\n''Les Visiteurs'' opened at [[List of 1993 box office number-one films in France|number one in France]] with a gross of 17.6 million [[French franc]]s ($3.3 million) for the week and remained there for ten weeks.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=40|date=8 February 1993|title=European box office|quote=$3,321,580; $1=5.3FF}}</ref> It returned to number one for another 7 weeks and was the highest-grossing film in France in 1993 with 13,782,846 ticket sales and a gross of $78 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2008/03/26/03002-20080326ARTFIG00564-les-quinze-plus-grands-succes-du-cinema-francais.php |title= Les quinze plus grands succ\u00e8s du cin\u00e9ma fran\u00e7ais |author= Laure Kermanac'h |date=4 April 2008 |work=[[Le Figaro]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title='Visiteurs 2' big B.O. cures sequel-phobia|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 16, 1998|page=24|last=Williams|first=Michael}}</ref> It was the highest-grossing non-English language film worldwide that year with a gross of $98.8 million.<ref name=gross/><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 3, 1994|page=1|last=Klady|first=Leonard|title=Top 100 pix take $8 bil globally}}</ref> It remains one of the [[List of highest-grossing films in France|highest grossing French films ever]].\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n*'''[[C\u00e9sar Awards]]''' (France)\n**'''Won''': [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress&nbsp;\u2013 Supporting Role]] (Val\u00e9rie Lemercier)\n**Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actor|Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Leading Role]] (Christian Clavier)\n**Nominated: Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Leading Role (Jean Reno)\n**Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] (Catherine Leterrier)\n**Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Jean-Marie Poir\u00e9)\n**Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] (Catherine Kelber)\n**Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n**Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Music|Best Music]] (Eric Levi)\n**Nominated: [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]] (Christian Clavier and Jean-Marie Poir\u00e9)\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on video in France on 15 December 1993.
