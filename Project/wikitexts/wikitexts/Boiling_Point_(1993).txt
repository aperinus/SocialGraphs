It was James B. Harris' last film. It is based on the novel ''Money Men'' by former U.S. Secret Service agent [[Gerald Petievich]], who co-wrote the screenplay.<ref name=NYT/>\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=September 2015}}\nThis film opens with Treasury Agent Jimmy Mercer ([[Wesley Snipes]]) and his partner Brady ([[Dan Hedaya]]) doing some undercover work, when Mercer's fellow Agent is shot and killed by a new man, Ronnie ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) that criminal Rudolph \"Red\" Diamond ([[Dennis Hopper]]) pulled out of jail. Now on a snap of anger and thoughts of revenge, Mercer wants to find the killer and take him down before he gets transferred to Newark. Although a cop and close colleague claims over dinner that Mercer must do it \"by the book,\" Mercer replies that \"when I'm done with this motherfucker, I'm gonna put him in a box..... by the book.\"\n\nA background theme is the closing of a big band dance emporium called the Palace.  Lonely, Red takes hooker Vicky (Lolita Davidovich) there for dancing.  Lolita is also involved romantically with Mercer, who is estranged from his ex-wife.\n\nRed continues to try to build a relationship with his old girlfriend, waitress Mona,  (Valerie Perrine).  Typically, he has manipulated and betrayed her in the past.\n\nRed is under increasing pressure to repay mob debts to boss Tony Dio (Tony Lo Bianco).  He manipulates Ronnie into a crime spree culminating in the murder of the boss and ransacking his apartment. He tells Ronnie to meet him  at the palace at 9 PM to split up the money. He asks Mona to meet him there as well.  Mercer is building his case against Red and arrives at the murder scene seconds too late.  Red is soon arrested and a net is laid for Ronnie at the club\n\nAt the club Red again manipulates Ronnie in an attempt to escape, yelling gun as he ducks.  Ronnie is shot by Mercer in the exchange and Red almost escapes.  As Red is taken away in the police car Mona arrives, seeing him pass by.  In the last scene Jimmy asks Vicky  to leave with him.\n\nThe epilogue reports that they actually did move to Newark.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as US Treasury Agent Jimmy Mercer\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Rudolph \"Red\" Diamond\n* [[Lolita Davidovich]] as Vikki Dunbar\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Ronnie\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as US Treasury Agent Sam Brady\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Virgil Leach\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Max Waxman\n* [[Christine Elise]] as Carol\n* [[Tony Lo Bianco]] as Tony Dio\n* [[Valerie Perrine]] as Mona\n* [[James Tolkan]] as Senior US Treasury Agent Jerry Levitt\n* [[Paul Gleason]] as Michael, The Transaction Man\n* Lorraine Evanoff as Connie\n* Stephanie E.
