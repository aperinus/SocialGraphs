To pay off his debts, he and his friends decide to rob a small-time gang who happen to be operating out of the flat next door.\n\nThe film brought Ritchie international acclaim and introduced actors Jones, a former [[Wales national football team|Wales]] international [[Footballer (soccer)|footballer]], and Statham, a former [[Diving (sport)|diver]], to worldwide audiences. Based on a $1.35 million budget, the film had a box office gross of over $28 million, making it a commercial success.\n\nA British television series, ''[[Lock, Stock...]]'', followed in 2000, running for seven episodes including the pilot.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[London]], long-time friends and small-time criminals Eddie, Tom, Soap, and Bacon put together \u00a3100,000 so that Eddie, a genius [[card sharp]], can buy into one of \"Hatchet\" Harry Lonsdale's high-stakes [[three-card brag]] games. The game is rigged and the friends end up owing Harry \u00a3500,000. Harry then sends his debt collector Big Chris to ensure that the quartet pay the debt within a week.\n\nAlso interested in a pair of expensive antique [[Holland & Holland]] [[shotgun]]s up for auction, Harry gets his enforcer Barry \"the Baptist\" to hire two thieves, Gary and Dean, to steal them from a bankrupt lord. The two turn out to be highly incompetent and unwittingly sell the shotguns to Nick \"the Greek\", a local [[fence (criminal)|fence]]. Barry threatens the two into getting the guns back. Eddie returns home one day and overhears his neighbours\u2014a gang of robbers led by a brutal man called \"Dog\"\u2014planning a heist on some [[cannabis]] growers loaded with cash and drugs. Eddie relays this information to the group, intending for them to rob the neighbours as they return from their heist. Preparing for the robbery, Tom visits Nick the Greek to buy weapons and ends up buying the two antique shotguns.\n\nThe neighbours' heist gets underway and despite a gang member being killed by his own [[Bren light machine gun|Bren gun]] and an incriminating encounter with a [[Parking enforcement officer|traffic warden]], they succeed, returning home with a duffel bag full of money and a van loaded with bags of cannabis. Eddie and his friends ambush them as planned and drive away in the neighbours' van containing the cannabis and the traffic warden. They transfer the loot to their own van and return home, knocking out the traffic warden and dumping him by the road, then have Nick fence the drugs to violent gangster Rory Breaker. Rory agrees to buy the cannabis at half price but two of Rory's men visit the house of the cannabis-growers, discover they've been robbed and the cannabis he just bought had been stolen from his own growers. Rory threatens Nick into giving him Eddie's address and tasks one of the growers, Winston, to identify the robbers.\n\nEddie and his friends celebrate at his father JD's bar. Dog's crew accidentally learns that their neighbours robbed them and set up an ambush in Eddie's flat. Rory and his gang arrive instead and in an ensuing shoot-out, all except Dog and Winston are killed. Winston leaves with the drugs, while Dog leaves with the two shotguns and the money but Big Chris incapacitates him and takes everything. Gary and Dean, having learned who bought the shotguns, follow Chris to Harry's place, unaware of the latter pair's relationship.\n\nChris delivers the money and guns to Harry but upon returning to his car he finds Dog holding his son Little Chris at knifepoint, demanding the money be returned to him. Chris complies and starts the car. Gary and Dean burst into Harry's office, and the ensuing confrontation results in their deaths along with Harry's and Barry's. Returning to see the carnage at their flat and their loot missing, Eddie and his friends head to Harry's but upon discovering Harry's corpse, they decide to take the money for themselves. Before they are able to leave, Chris crashes into their car to disable Dog and then bludgeons him to death with his car door. He then takes the debt money back from the unconscious friends but allows Tom to leave with the antique shotguns after a brief stand-off in Harry's office.\n\nThe friends are arrested but soon acquitted after the traffic warden identifies Dog and his crew as the culprits. Back at the bar, they dispatch Tom to dispose of the antique shotguns\u2014the only remaining evidence linking them to the case. Chris then arrives to give back the duffel bag, from which he has taken all the money for himself and his son and which now contains  a catalogue of antique weapons. Leafing through the catalogue, the friends learn that the shotguns are actually quite valuable (worth \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3300,000) and quickly call Tom to stop him from disposing of the guns. The film ends with Tom leaning over a bridge, with his mobile phone in his mouth and ringing, as he prepares to drop the shotguns into the [[River Thames]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n<!-- in credits order, do not change -->\n* [[Nick Moran]] as Eddie\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Tom\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as Soap\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Bacon\n* [[Steven Mackintosh]] as Winston\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as Big Chris\n* [[Nicholas Rowe (actor)|Nicholas Rowe]] as J\n* [[Lenny McLean]] as Barry \"the Baptist\"\n* [[P.

As stated in filmscouts.com:<blockquote>Although it was Ritchie's first feature, his previous short film ''The Hard Case'' was sufficiently impressive to secure interest not only from financial backers but also persuaded Sting to take the role of JD. \"I'd seen Guy's short film and was excited by the pace and energy in it. The way in which he handles violence and action appealed to me. I don't like gratuitous violence. I think it's much more chilling when it's suggested rather than graphic.\" For Ritchie, getting exactly the right actor for each role was essential. \"The casting took forever and we auditioned hundreds of people, but I was determined to hold out until we got the real McCoy.\" This led to employing several genuine ex-cons, who certainly invest the film with its menacing undertones. Ritchie also looked to the celebrity arena to secure the right cast such as Vinnie Jones. \"I didn't hesitate in casting Vinnie as I have the most incredible respect for his acting capabilities.\"<ref>[http://www.filmscouts.com/scripts/matinee.cfm?Film=loc-sto&File=productn Production notes from filmscouts.com]</ref></blockquote>\n\nA one-hour documentary of the production of the film was released featuring much of the cast along with Ritchie.<ref>''The Making of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''.

And so it is. We don't care much about the characters (I felt more actual affection for the phlegmatic bouncer, Barry the Baptist, than for any of the heroes). We realize that the film's style stands outside the material and is lathered on top (there are freeze frames, jokey subtitles, speed-up and slo-mo). And that the characters are controlled by the demands of the clockwork plot. But \"Lock, Stock<nowiki>''</nowiki> is fun, in a slapdash way; it has an exuberance, and in a time when movies follow formulas like zombies, it's alive\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels movie review (1999) {{!}} Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lock-stock-and-two-smoking-barrels-1999|access-date=2021-06-14|website=www.rogerebert.com/|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\nThe film was nominated for a [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Award]] in 1998 for the outstanding British Film of the Year.

In 2016, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked ''Lock, Stock'' 75th on their list of the 100 best British films, with their entry stating, \u201cto call the plot \"complex\" is to do it a disservice \u2013 it's all so slickly done, delivered with such balls-out confidence and written with such an amazing turn of phrase that somehow the convoluted to-ing-and-froing works like clockwork.
