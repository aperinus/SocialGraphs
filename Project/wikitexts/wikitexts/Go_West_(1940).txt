Quentin Quale is heading west to seek his fortune, but is short ten dollars for a train ticket. In the railroad station, he encounters brothers Joseph and Rusty Panello and attempts to swindle their money, but the two are also con men and manage to swindle Quale's money, instead. The Panellos are friends with an old prospector named Dan Wilson whose near worthless property, Dead Man's Gulch, has no gold. The Panello's loan Wilson their last ten dollars for a grubstake and he insists on giving them the deed to the Gulch as collateral. Unbeknownst to Wilson, Terry Turner, the son of his longtime rival and beau to his granddaughter Eve, has travelled to New York in order to persuade the Railroad to purchase Dead Man's Gulch from Dan Wilson. Terry convinces the railway officials that the gulch is the only practical route through the mountains to the west. The railroad agrees to buy the property thus making the deed holder rich. After Quale attempts to swindle the Panellos out of the deed, crooked railroad executive John Beecher and\nshady saloon owner \"Red\" Baxter manage to steal the deed from Quale; Quale and the Panello brothers help Terry and Eve retrieve the deed and deliver it to the railroad officials in New York.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Groucho Marx]] as S.

(In this song, Chico, playing the piano, rolls an [[orange (fruit)|orange]] on the keys in sync with the melody.)\n\nAs with ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'', the Marxes played key comedy scenes from ''Go West'' live onstage on a pre-filming tour; this tour was much shorter than that for the first two films, lasting three weeks.\n\nGroucho was aged 49 during the filming of ''Go West'', and his hairline had begun receding. As such, he took to wearing a [[toupee]] again throughout the film, as he did in the previous film, ''[[At the Circus]]''.\n\n''Go West'' Screenwriter [[Irving Brecher]] stood in for an ailing Groucho when publicity stills for the film were first taken. Brecher bore a remarkable resemblance to Groucho and is all but unrecognizable in the photos, sporting Groucho's glasses, greasepaint mustache and eyebrows.\n\nThe railroad scenes were filmed on the [[Sierra Railroad]] in [[Tuolumne County, California]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Jensen | first =Larry | authorlink = | title =Hollywood's Railroads: Sierra Railroad | publisher =Cochetopa Press | series = | volume = Two| edition = | date =2018 | location =Sequim, Washington | pages =20\u201321 | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=c-RNswEACAAJ&dq=Hollywood%27s+Railroads&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKgvSWqYncAhXqhFQKHQdfCaAQ6AEINjAE | doi = | id = | isbn =9780692064726 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n*\"You Can't Argue With Love\"\n*\"[[From the Land of the Sky-Blue Water]]\"\n*\"Ridin' The Range\"\n\n==Reception==\nThomas M.
