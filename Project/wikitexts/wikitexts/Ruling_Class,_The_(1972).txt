The film co-stars [[Alastair Sim]], [[William Mervyn]], [[Coral Browne]], [[Harry Andrews]], [[Carolyn Seymour]], [[James Villiers]] and [[Arthur Lowe]].

Jack, a [[paranoid schizophrenia|paranoid schizophrenic]], thinks he is [[Jesus Christ]] and shocks his family and friends with his talk of returning to the world to bring it love and charity, not to mention his penchant for breaking out into song and dance routines and sleeping upright on a cross. When faced with unpalatable facts (such as his identity as the 14th Earl), Jack puts them in his \"[[galvanized]] [[pressure cooker]]\" and they disappear. His unscrupulous uncle, Sir Charles ([[William Mervyn]]), marries him to his mistress, Grace ([[Carolyn Seymour]]), in hopes of producing an heir and putting his nephew in an institution; the plan fails, however, when Grace falls in love with Jack. Jack gains another ally in Sir Charles' wife, Lady Claire ([[Coral Browne]]), who hates her husband and befriends Jack just to spite him. She also begins sleeping with Jack's [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Herder ([[Michael Bryant (actor)|Michael Bryant]]), to persuade him to cure Jack quickly.\n\nHerder attempts to cure him through intensive [[psychotherapy]], to no avail; Jack so thoroughly believes that he is the \"God of Love\" that he dismisses any suggestion to the contrary as insane. The night his wife goes into [[Labour (childbirth)|labour]], Herder makes a last effort at curing Jack; he introduces Jack to McKyle ([[Nigel Green]]), a patient who also believes himself to be Christ\u2014or as the patient puts it, \"The High Voltage Messiah\"\u2014who subjects an unwitting Jack to [[electroshock therapy]]. The plan works, and as Grace is delivered of a healthy baby boy, Jack proclaims \"I'm Jack, I'm Jack\". His family takes this to mean that he has returned to his senses, but in reality he now believes himself to be [[Jack the Ripper]].\n\nSir Charles sends for a court-appointed psychiatrist ([[Graham Crowden]]) to evaluate Jack, confident that his nephew will be sent to an asylum for life. He is once again thwarted when the psychiatrist discovers that Jack was a fellow [[Eton College|Old Etonian]], bonds with him and declares him sane.\n\nJack murders Lady Claire in a fit of rage when the aging woman tries to seduce him. He frames the [[Communism|Communist]] family butler, Tucker ([[Arthur Lowe]]), for the murder. Sir Charles suffers a debilitating stroke shortly afterward, and Dr. Herder has a [[nervous breakdown]] upon realizing what Jack has done. Jack assumes his place in the [[House of Lords]] with a fiery speech in favour of [[capital punishment|capital]] and [[corporal punishment]]. His colleagues applaud wildly, completely unaware the speech is the ranting of a lunatic. When seen through his eyes, his colleagues &ndash; singing '[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]' &ndash; appear to be rotting corpses. Their enthusiasm contrasts with the unfavourable reaction when Jack believed he was Christ. That night, he murders Grace for expressing her love for him. Her terrified scream is matched by the sound of a baby cooing \"I'm Jack, I'm Jack\", suggesting that their son &ndash; the [[heir presumptive]] &ndash; has inherited Jack's madness.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] \u2013 Jack Gurney, 14th Earl of Gurney\n* [[Coral Browne]] \u2013 Lady Claire\n* [[William Mervyn]] \u2013 Sir Charles\n* [[James Villiers]] \u2013 Dinsdale, Sir Charles and Lady Claire's son\n* [[Arthur Lowe]] \u2013 Tucker\n* [[Alastair Sim]] \u2013 Bishop Lampton\n* [[Carolyn Seymour]] \u2013 Grace\n* [[Michael Bryant (actor)|Michael Bryant]] \u2013 Dr. Herder\n* [[Graham Crowden]] \u2013 Dr. Truscott\n* [[Harry Andrews]] \u2013 Ralph Gurney, 13th Earl of Gurney\n* Hugh Owens \u2013 The toastmaster\n* [[Hugh Burden]] \u2013 Matthew Peake\n* [[Henry Woolf]], Griffith Davies, [[Oliver McGreevy]] \u2013 Inmates\n* [[Kay Walsh]] \u2013 Mrs. Piggott-Jones\n* [[Patsy Byrne]] \u2013 Mrs. Treadwell\n* [[Nigel Green]] \u2013 McKyle\n* [[Cyril Appleton]], [[Leslie Schofield]] \u2013 McKyle's assistants\n* [[Joan Cooper]] \u2013 Nurse Brice\n* [[Declan Mulholland]] \u2013 A poacher\n* [[James Grout]] \u2013 Inspector Brockett\n* [[James Hazeldine]] \u2013 Fraser\n* [[Ronald Adam (actor)|Ronald Adam]], Julian D'Albie, [[Llewellyn Rees]] \u2013 Lords\n* [[Kenneth Benda]] \u2013 Lord Chancellor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nO'Toole [[Option (filmmaking)|held the rights]] to Barnes's play; [[Peter Medak]] approached O'Toole repeatedly about exercising those rights. According to Medak, the project got started one night that he and O'Toole were returning from the theatre, which \"meant stopping at every pub between [[Soho]] and [[Hampstead]], and it didn't matter if it was after closing hour because he would knock on the door and just say 'Peter's here,' and every door opened for him\". Later on, at O'Toole's apartment, the deeply inebriated actor phoned his manager and said, \"I'm with the crazy Hungarian and I know I'm drunk but I give you 24 hours to set this movie up.\" The next day, Medak received a call from United Artists and a deal was put together to shoot ''The Ruling Class''.<ref name=\"tcm\">{{cite web| first= Paul |last= Tatara |title= The Ruling Class | url= http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=290215%7C290217 | publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] | access-date= 2011-05-22}}</ref>\n\nPeter Barnes adapted the screenplay from his 1968 original, with few major changes. Filmed at the sprawling estate of [[Harlaxton Manor]], with the interiors reconstructed on sound stages, the production cost $1.4 million, with O'Toole working for free (he was instead paid a great deal for the big-budget ''[[Man of La Mancha (film)|Man of La Mancha]]'', released by the same studio later the same year).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n''The Ruling Class'' was the official British entry at the [[1972 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe film divided critics. ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as \"fantastic fun\" and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it \"brilliantly caustic\", but the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it \"[[snail]]-slow, shrill and gesticulating\" and ''[[Newsweek]]'' said it was a \"sledgehammer [[satire]]\".\n[[Jay Cocks]] called the screenplay a \"snarling, overwrought and somewhat parochial satire on aristocracy and privileged morality\"; he called the film \"wretchedly photographed...as if it were shot under floodlights\". In contrast Cocks praised the performances by Lowe, Mervyn, Browne, [[Alastair Sim]] and [[James Villiers]], but reserved most of his praise for O'Toole, saying his performance is of \"such intensity that it may trouble sleep as surely as it will haunt memory. All actors can play insanity; few play it well. O'Toole begins where other actors stop, with the unfocused gaze, the abrupt bursts of frenzied high spirits and precipitous depressions. Funny, disturbing, finally devastating, O'Toole finds his way into the workings of madness, revealing the anger and consuming anguish at the source.\"<ref>{{cite web| first= Jay |last= Cocks| author-link= Jay Cocks |date= 18 September 1972 |title= Cinema: Cartoons from Punch | url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,906410,00.html | archive-url= https://archive.today/20120914162304/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,906410,00.html | url-status= dead | archive-date= 14 September 2012 | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | access-date= 2011-05-22}}</ref> [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] described The Ruling Class as  a \"delightful satire\".<ref>{{cite book |title=John Simon on Film: Criticism 1982-2001|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=Applause Books |year=2005 |page=313}}</ref>\n\nDespite mixed critical reaction to the film, O'Toole's performance was universally praised and garnered  numerous prestigious awards and prizes, including an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. Reportedly, when [[United Artists]], its North American distributor, told producer [[Jules Buck]] that it would be cutting the film extensively for US release, Buck punched the company's London representative and bought the film back. [[Avco Embassy]] then bought the distribution rights and cut the film's 154-minute running time by six minutes.<ref name=\"news.independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe film was banned by the South African Publications Control Board.\n\nIn a review nearly 30 years after ''The Ruling Class'' was first released, [[Ian Christie (film scholar)|Ian Christie]] said the film is \"unashamedly theatrical, and it emerges from a particularly interesting period in English culture when theatre and cinema together were mining a rich vein of flamboyant self-analysis. Many stage works of this period cry out for filmic extension\u2014in fact, Medak had just filmed a very different play that mingled fantasy and reality by a writer often bracketed with Barnes, Peter Nichols\u2019 ''[[A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (1972 film)|A Day in the Death of Joe Egg]]''. But what makes ''The Ruling Class'' exceptional (and difficult for some) are its outrageous mixing of genres and its sheer ambition. Not only are there allusions to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]], but also to [[Oscar Wilde|Wilde]] and [[Whitehall farce]]; to the gentility of [[Ealing Studios]], with a plot that distantly evokes that other great [[black comedy]] ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'', and to [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer's gore-fests]].\"<ref>{{cite web|first= Ian |last= Christie |author-link= Ian Christie (film scholar) |date=29 October 2001 |title= The Ruling Class| url= http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/150-the-ruling-class | publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] | access-date= 2011-05-22}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n*[[National Board of Review Awards 1972|1972 National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] - Won NBR Award (Best Actor) - Peter O'Toole\n*[[1972 Cannes Film Festival]] - Nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2351/year/1972.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Ruling Class |access-date=2009-04-14|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n*[[45th Academy Awards|1973 Academy Awards]] - Nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] - Peter O'Toole\n*[[30th Golden Globe Awards|1973 Golden Globe Awards]] - Nominated for the  [[Golden Globe]] for Best English Language Foreign Film\n\n==Subsequent history==\nIn 1974, following an earlier-than-normal TV screening of the film on [[BBC Television]] that broke a [[gentlemen's agreement]] allowing a 'window' of theatrical distribution before any TV screening, the UK's [[Cinema Exhibitors' Association|Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association]] (the theatrical distributors' association) recommended its members blacklist all future movies produced by Jules Buck.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://secure.bfi.org.uk/filmtvinfo/publications/pub-rep-brief/pdf/britfilms/key-events.pdf|title=British Film Institute 'Key Events' list for 1974|access-date=2007-09-23}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\n[[Embassy Pictures]] re-released the film in May 1983.<ref>{{cite web| first= Judy |last= Klemesrud | author-link= Judy Klemesrud |date= 8 May 1983 |title= Cinema: Cartoons from Punch | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/08/movies/peter-o-toole-rises-from-the-ashes.html | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | work=Arts and Leisure| access-date= 2011-05-22}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0069198}}\n*{{Rotten-tomatoes|ruling_class}}\n* {{Amg movie|42294}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070315015620/http://www.yoism.org/?q=node%2F19 A Grade One, Galilee Miracle] from yoism.org, with a film clip in which the O'Toole character claims that he is Jesus Christ and presents a \"miracle\"\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/150-the-ruling-class ''The Ruling Class''] an essay by [[Ian Christie (film scholar)|Ian Christie]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Peter Medak}}\n{{Jack the Ripper media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ruling Class, The}}\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Medak]]\n[[Category:British black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1972 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:British comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1972 films]]\n[[Category:British plays]]\n[[Category:British satirical films]]\n[[Category:Films set in country houses]]\n[[Category:Films set in England]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Cameron]]\n[[Category:Embassy Pictures films]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:1972 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1972 drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s British films]]"}]}}}}
