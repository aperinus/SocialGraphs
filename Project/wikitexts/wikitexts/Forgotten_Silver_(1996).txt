It was written and directed by [[Peter Jackson]] and Costa Botes, both of whom appear in the film in their roles as makers of the documentary.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Forgotten Silver'' purports to tell the story of \"forgotten\" New Zealand filmmaker Colin McKenzie, and the rediscovery of his lost films, which presenter Peter Jackson claims to have found in an old shed. McKenzie is presented as the first and greatest innovator of modern cinema, single-handedly inventing the tracking shot (by accident), the close-up (unintentionally), and both sound and color film years before their historically documented creation. The film also shows fragments of an epic Biblical film, ''Salome'', supposedly made by McKenzie in a giant set in the forests of New Zealand, and a \"computer enhancement\" of a McKenzie film proving that New Zealander [[Richard Pearse]] was the first man to invent a powered aircraft, several months before the [[Wright Brothers]].<ref>[http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/colin-mckenzie/biography McKenzie] (faked biography)</ref>\n\nThe film also shows a (staged) premiere screening of a recovered McKenzie film presented by film promoter Lindsay Shelton. It features deadpan commentary from actor/director [[Sam Neill]] and director and film archivist [[John O'Shea (director)|John O'Shea]], as well as critical praise from international industry notables including film historian [[Leonard Maltin]], and [[Harvey Weinstein]] of [[Miramax Films]].\n\nIn reality, McKenzie is a fictional character, and the films featured in ''Forgotten Silver'' were all created by Peter Jackson, carefully mimicking the style of [[early cinema]]. The interviewees are all acting. [[Thomas Robins (actor)|Thomas Robins]], the actor who portrays Colin McKenzie, is today more easily recognized by audiences as [[Sm\u00e9agol]]'s ill-fated cousin [[D\u00e9agol]] in Jackson's ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.\n\n==Cast==\nAs themselves:\n* [[Jeffrey Thomas (actor)|Jeffrey Thomas]] (narrator)\n* [[Peter Jackson]]\n* [[Johnny Morris (film archivist)|Johnny Morris]]\n* [[Costa Botes]]\n* [[Harvey Weinstein]]\n* [[Leonard Maltin]]\n* [[Sam Neill]]\n* [[John O'Shea (director)|John O'Shea]]\n* Marguerite Hurst\n* Lindsay Shelton\n* [[Davina Whitehouse]]\n\nActors:\n* [[Thomas Robins (actor)|Thomas Robins]] - Colin McKenzie\n* Richard Shirtcliffe - Brooke McKenzie\n* Beatrice Ashton - Hannah McKenzie\n* Peter Corrigan - Stan \"the Man\" Wilson\n* [[Sarah McLeod]] - May Belle\n\n== Production ==\nCosta Botes directed the \"documentary\" portions while Peter Jackson created the \"archive footage\" supposedly filmed by McKenzie. Jackson also shot fake interviews in [[Los Angeles]], including the one with Weinstein.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was first aired on [[Television New Zealand]]'s channel [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV ONE]] at a time usually dedicated to [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[mini-series]], but was billed and introduced as a serious documentary. Many viewers were fooled until the directors shortly afterwards revealed that it was a hoax.
