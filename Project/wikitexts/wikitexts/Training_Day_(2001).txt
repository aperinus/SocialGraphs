Driving around in Alonzo's [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#1979|Monte Carlo]], they begin the day by catching some college kids buying [[marijuana]]. Confiscating their drugs, Alonzo puts it into a pipe and tells Jake to smoke it. When Jake refuses, Alonzo threatens him at gunpoint, stating that refusing like this while on the streets would get him killed. Jake smokes the pipe, and Alonzo tells him that it was laced with [[Phencyclidine|PCP]].\n\nAfter paying a visit to Roger, an ex-cop turned drug dealer, Jake notices a pair of addicts attempting to [[rape]] a teenage girl in an alley. Jake intervenes while Alonzo watches. After the girl leaves and Alonzo scares the addicts off, Jake finds the girl's wallet on the ground and retrieves it.\n\nLater, Alonzo and Jake apprehend a dealer named Blue, finding [[Crack cocaine|crack rocks]] and a loaded [[handgun]] on him. Rather than go to jail, Blue informs on his employer Kevin \"Sandman\" Miller, who is in prison. Using a fake [[search warrant]], Alonzo steals $40,000 from Sandman's home. At lunch, the two visit Alonzo's mistress Sara and their young son. Alonzo then meets with a trio of corrupt high-ranking police officials he dubs the \"Three Wise Men.\" Aware that the [[Russian mafia|Russian Mafia]] is hunting Alonzo over a large unpaid debt, they suggest that he skip town. Alonzo insists he has control of the situation and trades the $40,000 for an [[arrest warrant]].\n\nUsing the warrant, Alonzo, Jake, and four other narcotics officers return to Roger's house and seize $4 million from the premises, a quarter of which Alonzo keeps. Alonzo shoots and kills Roger when Jake refuses to do so, and stages the scene with his men to make the shooting look justified. Infuriated, Jake gets into a [[Mexican standoff]] with the corrupt officers; Alonzo (having planned the day's events) threatens Jake by reminding him of the LAPD's routine [[blood test]], which will identify the PCP-laced cannabis Jake smoked earlier and end his career. Alonzo promises to protect Jake for his cooperation, and Jake is forced to comply.\n\nLater that evening, Alonzo drives Jake to the home of a [[Sure\u00f1os|Sure\u00f1o]] gangster named \"Smiley\" for an errand. Jake reluctantly plays [[poker]] with Smiley and his fellow gang members as he waits for Alonzo. As they talk, Smiley reveals Alonzo's situation: by midnight, Alonzo must pay $1 million to the Russians for killing one of their men in [[Las Vegas]], or be killed himself. Realizing that Alonzo abandoned him and has paid Smiley to kill him, Jake attempts to flee but is beaten and dragged to the bathroom to be executed. Before they can kill Jake, a gang member searches him for money and finds the wallet of the teenage girl, who happens to be Smiley's cousin. After calling his cousin and confirming how Jake had saved her, Smiley releases Jake out of gratitude.\n\nJake returns to Sara's apartment to arrest Alonzo, just as he is leaving to pay the Russians with Roger's money. A gunfight and chase ensue, and Alonzo is eventually subdued on the street while the entire neighborhood gathers to watch. Alonzo offers money to whoever kills Jake to no avail. Jake then takes the stolen cash, intending to submit it as criminal evidence against Alonzo. The neighborhood gang allows Jake to leave safely. Enraged, Alonzo threatens to retaliate against the gang members, but the unimpressed gangs ignore him and walk away.\n\nAlonzo flees for his life to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]], but he is ambushed and gunned down by the Russians. Jake returns home as the press reports on Alonzo's death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Detective Alonzo Harris\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Officer Jake Hoyt\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as Roger\n* [[Eva Mendes]] as Sara\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as \"Smiley\"\n* [[Raymond Cruz]] as \"Sniper\"\n* [[Noel Gugliemi]] as Moreno\n* [[Dr. Dre]] as Detective Paul\n* [[Peter Greene]] as Detective Jeff\n* [[Nick Chinlund]] as Detective Tim\n* [[Jaime P.

He has said that he fought with studio executives who wanted to cut the Three Wise Men scene, thinking it slowed the film. He insisted that the Wise Men scene was pivotal in establishing that at least some of Alonzo's illegal actions were sanctioned by his superiors who regarded unethical behavior as a necessary evil.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\">{{cite AV media | people=Fuqua, Antoine (director, primary contributor) | date= June 3, 2002 | title=Training Day DVD | medium=Motion picture commentary | location=U.S.}}</ref>\n\nFuqua wanted ''Training Day'' to look as authentic as possible, and he shot on location in some of the most infamous neighborhoods of Los Angeles.
