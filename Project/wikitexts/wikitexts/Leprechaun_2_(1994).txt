The sequel [[Mark Jones (screenwriter)|Mark Jones]]' ''[[Leprechaun (film)|Leprechaun]]'' (1993) and the second entry in the [[Leprechaun (film series)|''Leprechaun'' series]], the plot centers on the psychopathic [[leprechaun]] Lubdan ([[Warwick Davis]]) as he hunts for a bride and for his gold.\n\n''Leprechaun 2'' was released on April 8, 1994 to a box office total of $2.3 million. Panned by critics, it was the final installment to receive a theatrical release. A sequel, ''[[Leprechaun 3]]'', was released [[direct-to-video]] the following year.\n\n==Plot==\n1000 years ago in [[Ireland]], an evil [[Leprechaun]] celebrates his 1,000th birthday on [[Saint Patrick's Day|St. Patrick's Day]]. He tells his slave, a man named William O'Day, that he has found the perfect [[bride]]. Once he marries, the Leprechaun promises to grant O'Day his freedom. O'Day is overjoyed at first, but is horrified to see the Leprechaun has chosen his beautiful daughter. Despite O'Day's pleas, the Leprechaun says that she will be his once she sneezes three consecutive times without anyone saving her by saying \"God bless you\". Once the Leprechaun manipulates her to start sneezing, O'Day says \"God bless you, my child\", freeing her from the Leprechaun. O'Day is then killed by the Leprechaun, who promises to marry an O'Day descendant on his next thousandth birthday.\n\nOn St. Patrick's Day in present-day [[Los Angeles]], a young man named Cody works with his uncle Morty giving \"dark side\" tours, a scam that drives tourists to alleged resting places of celebrities. When Morty is too drunk to drive, Cody does so, forcing him to cancel a date with his girlfriend Bridget. He drops Bridget off at a [[go-kart]] track run by his pretentious rival Ian. Prior to Bridget's departure, the Leprechaun emerges from one of the tour stops: an Irish tree that was present at the home of [[Harry Houdini]]. The Leprechaun tears out the [[Gold teeth|gold tooth]] of a homeless man and goes off to search for his new bride, revealed to be Bridget (a descendant of the O'Day bloodline). A frustrated Cody speeds through a red light and is arrested. Morty picks him up from the [[police station]].\n\nIan drives Bridget home and attempts to force his way inside her home to hook up with her, but she punches him. As he's leaving, Ian sees Bridget beckoning him to come into the garage. The sight is revealed to be a trick by the Leprechaun, who has given a running [[Lawn mower|lawnmower]] her appearance. Ian is killed as he goes to kiss what he thinks are her breasts, but are actually the spinning mower blades. Cody visits Bridget and gifts her flowers, and they reconcile. The Leprechaun has snuck inside and begins to make her sneeze which Cody thinks is caused by the flowers and attempts to say \"God bless you\" but suddenly begins to be strangled by a [[Registered jack|phone cord]] before he can finish saying it. The Leprechaun then appears to claim her. After a scuffle with Cody, he escapes with Bridget, but loses one of his gold coins after Bridget knocked the pot of gold from his hands, which lands in Cody's possession.\n\nThe Leprechaun takes her to his lair and plans to make her his bride, but realizes a coin is missing. He leaves to get the coin back. Since Cody left the flowers behind, he is considered a prime suspect in Ian's death and Bridget's disappearance. Cody returns home and consults a book with Morty. They learn about the Leprechaun's search for a bride and that cast iron is his one weakness. The Leprechaun suddenly attacks, demanding his coin back. Cody makes a deal to give the coin in exchange for Bridget, unaware the Leprechaun plans to double-cross him. Morty intervenes and they escape to a bar celebrating St. Patrick's Day. Morty notices the Leprechaun at the bar and challenges to a [[Drinking game|drinking contest]], reasoning with Cody that Bridget can't be harmed as long as the Leprechaun is with him. Morty wins the contest, but the Leprechaun escapes. The Leprechaun sobers up at an [[Coffeehouse|espresso bar]], killing an obnoxious barista. Remembering the Leprechaun's weakness, Cody and Morty go to the go-kart track and empty the facility's cast-iron safe, intending to capture the Leprechaun inside.\n\nA [[security guard]] nearly catches them, but Morty knocks him out. As the arriving Leprechaun attacks Morty, Cody is able to trick and capture him inside the safe. However, Morty locks Cody in a supply closet and demands the Leprechaun give him three wishes, as is tradition. Morty first wishes for the Leprechaun's pot of gold. The wish is unspecifically granted, as the pot manifests inside Morty's [[stomach]]. The Leprechaun says he can help remove it, tricking Morty into using his second wish to set him free from the safe. For his final wish, Morty asks for the pot to be removed, and the Leprechaun does so by tearing his stomach open, killing Morty. Cody escapes the closet, but is apprehended by the security guard, who believes Cody responsible for all the killings. The Leprechaun suddenly attacks them with a go-kart, killing the security guard. He attempts to run over Cody, but Cody discovers that he can't be killed as long as he has the gold coin. He makes his way to the Leprechaun's lair.\n\nIn the lair, Cody defeats the living skeleton of O'Day and frees Bridget. They attempt to escape the [[labyrinth]]-like lair, but get separated. Cody finds Bridget, who asks Cody to give the coin to her. He does so, and she is revealed to be the Leprechaun in disguise. The real Bridget reappears and begs the Leprechaun to spare Cody, but the Leprechaun forces Cody to drive a cast iron stake into himself. Cody's death is revealed to be a ruse (he knew of the Leprechaun's trick), as he gave the Leprechaun a chocolate coin he was given at the bar and is still immune to the Leprechaun's attacks. Cody rises and stabs the Leprechaun with the stake, causing him to violently combust. Cody and Bridget escape the lair. Cody discards the gold coin, remarking that it's \"not worth it\". They emerge in the sunlight together and kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as Lubdan The Leprechaun\n* Charlie Heath as Cody Ingalls\n* Shevonne Durkin as Bridget Callum\n** Durkin also plays O'Day's daughter in the prologue.\n* [[Sandy Baron]] as Mortimer \"Morty\" Ingalls\n* James Lancaster as William O'Day\n* Adam Biesk as Ian Joyce\n* Linda Hopkins as Housewife\n* Warren A.
