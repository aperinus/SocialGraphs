After accepting a job as a painter at a home for the elderly, he makes friends with the establishment's cooks and helps them improve their menu. These improvements eventually reach the ears of Alexandre Lagarde ([[Jean Reno]]), who is also in a precarious situation:  as the renowned chef of the Cargo Lagarde restaurant, he has to improve his entire menu.  If he cannot achieve this, the place will lose a star from its rating and Stanislas Matter (Julien Boisselier) will convert it into a molecular kitchen, with Alexandre and all the cooks losing their jobs.
