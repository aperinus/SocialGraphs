It is set before the events of both the series and the first film, showing how Fred and Barney meet Wilma and Betty. The title is a play on the [[Elvis Presley]] song, ''[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]'', also used as the title of an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] [[Viva Las Vegas|musical film]].\n\nNone of the original cast from the first film reprise their roles in this film. The film stars [[Mark Addy]] as [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Stephen Baldwin]] as [[Barney Rubble]], [[Kristen Johnston]] as [[Wilma Flintstone|Wilma Slaghoople]], and [[Jane Krakowski]] as [[Betty Rubble|Betty O'Shale]], replacing [[John Goodman]], [[Rick Moranis]], [[Elizabeth Perkins]], and [[Rosie O'Donnell]] respectively. The supporting cast features [[Joan Collins]], [[Thomas Gibson]], [[Harvey Korman]] (in his final film performance), and [[Alan Cumming]] as both [[The Great Gazoo]] and Mick Jagged, a parody of [[Mick Jagger]]. [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]], who created the original cartoon series, make cameo appearances at the end of the film.\n\nThe film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing only $59.5 million against its $83 million budget.<ref name=mojo /> Like its predecessor, ''Viva Rock Vegas'' also received negative reviews, though some critics considered it an improvement over the first film.\n\n== Plot ==\nYoung bachelors and best friends Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble have recently qualified as crane operators at Slate & Company. Soon to be employed, now they want dates, and a little green alien The Great Gazoo, exiled to Earth by his species, offers to help, although only they can see him. Meanwhile, Wilma Slaghoople wants a normal life and activities, like bowling, though her controlling mother Pearl wants her to marry smooth casino-owner Chip Rockefeller.  After Wilma angrily escapes to [[Burger King|Bronto King]] in [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], waitress Betty O'Shale, mistaking her as \"[[Homelessness|caveless]]\", offers to share her apartment and gets her a job.\n\nSmitten with the waitresses, the two men invite them to a carnival, with Fred dating Betty and Barney taking Wilma. However, the couples do not really connect until both men switch dates. Fred wins an egg in a carnival game which hatches into a baby dinosaur, which he names \"Dino\". Wilma invites her new friends home to a birthday party for her father, Colonel Slaghoople, where all are shocked by her wealth. Intending to propose, Fred changes his mind after meeting Chip, who berates his low-level job at Slate & Company. Pearl dislikes the three new friends, but the Colonel, glad for Wilma's happiness, accepts them and privately gives Wilma a valuable pearl necklace that his great-grandmother once wore. After the boys disgrace themselves at dinner, Wilma nevertheless proclaims her pride and follows them out.\n\nChip congratulates Fred on attracting Wilma, apologizes for mocking Fred's job, and invites the group to his [[Las Vegas|Rock Vegas]] resort as a peace offering. However, unbeknownst to the group, Chip plots to hope Fred gambles so Wilma dumps him, whereas Fred sees it as a chance to win big so he can impress Wilma with money like Chip's. Gangsters Big Rocko and Little Rocko visit Chip and his girlfriend Roxie to collect a lot of money that Chip owes their boss. Gazoo overhears Chip claiming his upcoming marriage to Wilma will allow him to access the Slaghoople fortune. Considering that plan creditable, the gangsters agree to suspend collections until after the wedding. When Barney tries to keep Fred from high-stakes poker, Chip sends Roxie to seduce and escort Barney to an all-you-can-eat buffet.\n\nChip keeps Fred gambling to miss his dinner date with the others. Betty sees Barney wipe cream from Roxie's chest, misinterpreting the move as a pass. Mick Jagged comforts the weeping girl, and they go on a date. Wilma breaks up with Fred over not spending any time with her. Chip warns her of burglaries and arranges that Fred loses everything before slipping Wilma's pearls in Fred's pocket and asking him to empty them. Hotel security arrests Fred for robbery, but when Barney protests that Fred is incapable of robbery and would not even be able to crack his own knuckles without help, Chip accuses Barney of being Fred's accomplice and also has him arrested. Angered that the two stole from her, Wilma goes back to Chip.\n\nGazoo visits the men in prison, revealing that Chip is severely indebted to the mob and hopes to solve both his problems by framing Fred for the robbery and marrying Wilma to get the Slaghooples' money. Barney slips through the bars, steals the keys, and unlocks the cell. Disguised in drag as dancers, they accidentally run into Jagged's dressing room. Barney tells Betty he loves her, and they reconcile after the misunderstanding involving Roxie at the buffet is cleared up, and Barney knocks out Jagged.\n\nFred plans to disguise himself as Jagged in an attempt to reconcile with Wilma. Meanwhile, in the audience, Chip proposes to an unresponsive Wilma. Fred then comes on stage disguised as Jagged and briefly sings to Wilma, apologizing for his behavior earlier before proposing to her. Knowing that she still loves Fred, Wilma happily accepts, rejecting Chip, and they marry in the Rock Vegas Chapel of Love. After the pastor proclaims them husband and wife, everyone sings \"[[Meet the Flintstones]]\". When Jagged sings \"Viva Rock Vegas\" at a party, Betty catches Wilma's tossed bouquet and kisses Barney. The newlyweds drive away with Dino and Gazoo to goodbye waves from their friends, family, and even a handcuffed Chip and Roxie.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mark Addy]] as [[Fred Flintstone]], a crane operator.\n* [[Stephen Baldwin]] as [[Barney Rubble]], a crane operator and Fred's best friend.\n* [[Kristen Johnston]] as [[Wilma Flintstone|Wilma Slaghoople]], the heir to the Slaghoople fortune and Fred's love interest.\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as [[Betty Rubble|Betty O'Shale]], a waitress at Bronto King and Barney's love interest.\n* [[Thomas Gibson]] as Chip Rockefeller, a casino owner who falls for Wilma.\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as [[The Great Gazoo]], an alien who befriends Fred and Barney.\n** Alan Cumming also portrays [[Mick Jagger|Mick Jagged]]\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as Colonel Slaghoople, Wilma's father.
