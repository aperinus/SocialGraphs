It is based on American television news producer [[Mary Mapes]]'s memoir ''Truth and Duty: The Press, the President and the Privilege of Power''. The film focuses on the [[Killian documents controversy]] and the resulting last days of news anchor [[Dan Rather]] and producer Mary Mapes at [[CBS News]]. It stars [[Cate Blanchett]] as Mapes and [[Robert Redford]] as Rather.\n\n''Truth'' had its world premiere at the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]]. The film received a [[limited release]] in the United States on October 16, 2015, before being released nationwide on October 30, 2015, by [[Sony Pictures Classics]].<ref name=\"release\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the months before the US [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], [[Mary Mapes]] (producer of the primetime news program ''[[60 Minutes II|60 Minutes Wednesday]]'') and her crew consisting of Mike Smith (Grace), Lucy Scott (Moss), and Colonel Roger Charles (Quaid) are seeking evidence to verify whether or not George W. Bush received any preferential treatment during his time in the military. Charles, knowing that the military \"is good at what they do,\" believes there were no mistakes or errors, despite some claims that Bush's records were lost or altered, and that Bush had difficulty meeting minimal physical aptitude testing. Seeking leads, Mapes and her crew eventually find [[Bill Burkett]], who says he has [[Killian documents controversy|documents]] in the form of memos and letters dictating that Bush did indeed have preferential treatment and went [[AWOL]] for one year in 1972. Rather also interviews former Texan Lieutenant Governor [[Ben Barnes (Texas politician)|Ben Barnes]] who admits he pulled strings which enabled George Bush to join the National Guard. Mapes produces a story that [[Dan Rather]] reports on ''60 Minutes''.\n\nAfter the airing, Mapes and Rather face questions over the accuracy of the segment. The authenticity of the documents on which the allegations are based is called into question. A controversy is fueled by radio hosts and bloggers and amplified by mainstream media sources, ''The Washington Post'', and by CBS itself. Certain characteristics of the memos, such as their font and letter spacing, indicate they were created on a computer using [[Microsoft Word]], and therefore could not have been typed on a typewriter in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"ebert\">[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/truth-2015 Truth movie review], [[RogerEbert.com]], October 16, 2015.</ref> Subsequently, Burkett, who presented the documents, admits that he lied about where he obtained them.<ref>Orr, Christopher. [https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/truth-a-terrible-terrible-movie-about-journalism/412036/ \"''Truth'': A Terrible, Terrible Movie About Journalism\"], ''The Atlantic'', October 23, 2015.</ref>\n\nJerry Killian was George W. Bush's commanding officer in 1972. At the time of the CBS reporting in 2004, Killian was dead. Killian's supervisory officer Robert \"Bobby\" Hodges recants an earlier statement that the Killian documents were authentic. However, Hodges refuses to dwell on whether or not there is \"truth\" in the documents.\n\nDan Rather is forced to apologize for presenting the material as fact. After the scandal, Mapes, her crew, and Rather are faced with charges that Mapes's liberal political agenda played a part in airing the segment. One by one they are forced to face an internal review panel to determine if political bias was a factor. The internal investigation focus on the authenticity of the Killian documents as opposed to their content. Smith, Scott and Charles are eventually banned from their work and fired, with Smith going on a rant in the office before being escorted out. Rather decides that after the hearing he will retire from broadcasting. After two sessions facing the board, Mapes lectures her opponents: \n:Our story was about whether Bush fulfilled his service. But nobody wants to talk about that. They want to talk about fonts and forgeries and conspiracy theories, because that's what people do these days if they don't like a story. They point and scream, they question your politics, your objectivity - hell, your basic humanity-and they hope to God the truth gets lost in the scrum. And when it is finally over and they have kicked and shouted so loud, we can't even remember what the point was.\nNonetheless, she is fired after the hearing. Rather makes his last broadcast, citing the courage it took for his crew to get through the toughest times. \nTitles at the end of the film note that Mary Mapes was fired and four executives were asked to resign, and also that CBS won a [[Peabody Award]] for Mapes' earlier documentary exposing atrocities at [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Mary Mapes]]\n* [[Robert Redford]] as [[Dan Rather]]\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Mike Smith\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Colonel Roger Charles\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Lucy Scott\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as [[Andrew Heyward]]\n* [[David Lyons (actor)|David Lyons]] as Josh Howard\n* [[John Benjamin Hickey]] as Mark Wrolstad\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as [[Bill Burkett]]\n* [[Noni Hazlehurst]] as Nicki Burkett\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Lawrence Lanpher\n* [[Rachael Blake]] as Betsy West\n* [[Andrew McFarlane (Australian actor)|Andrew McFarlane]] as Dick Hibey\n* [[William Devane]] as the voice of Gen.
