Spurlock's film follows a 30-day period from February 1 to March 2, 2003, during which he ate only [[List of McDonald's products|McDonald's food]]. The film documents the drastic effect on Spurlock's physical and [[psychology|psychological]] health and well-being. It also explores the [[fast food]] industry's corporate influence, including how it encourages poor [[nutrition]] for its own profit and gain.\n\nSpurlock ate at [[McDonald's]] restaurants three times a day, eating every item on the chain's menu at least once. Spurlock consumed an average of 20.9 [[Joule|megajoules]] or 5,000 [[Food energy|kcal]] (the equivalent of 9.26 [[Big Mac]]s) per day during the experiment. He also walked about 2 [[kilometer]]s (1.5 miles) a day. An intake of around 2,500 kcal within a healthy balanced diet is more generally recommended for a man to maintain his weight.<ref>{{cite web |title=What should my daily intake of calories be? |url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1126.aspx?categoryid=51 |website=[[NHS]]|date = June 27, 2018|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref> As a result, the then-32-year-old Spurlock gained {{convert|24.5|lbs|kg}}, a 13% body mass increase, increased his [[cholesterol]] to 230&nbsp;mg/dL (6.0&nbsp;mmol/L), and experienced [[mood swing]]s, [[sexual dysfunction]], and fat accumulation in his liver. It took Spurlock fourteen months to lose all the weight gained from his experiment using a [[vegan]] diet supervised by his then-girlfriend, a chef who specializes in gourmet vegan dishes.\n\nThe reason for Spurlock's investigation was the increasing spread of [[obesity in the United States|obesity throughout U.S. society]], which the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] has declared an \"epidemic\", and the corresponding [[lawsuit]] brought against McDonald's on behalf of two overweight girls, who, it was alleged, became obese as a result of eating McDonald's food ''(Pelman v.

He is seen by three [[physicians]] (a [[cardiologist]], a [[gastroenterologist]], and a [[general practitioner]]), as well as a [[nutritionist]] and a [[personal trainer]]. All of the health professionals predict the \"McDiet\" will have unwelcome effects on his body, but none expected anything too drastic, one citing the [[human body]] as being \"extremely adaptable\". Prior to the experiment, Spurlock ate a varied diet but always had [[vegan]] evening meals to accommodate his girlfriend, Alexandra, a vegan chef. At the beginning of the experiment, Spurlock, who stood {{convert|6|ft|2|in|cm}} tall, had a body weight of {{convert|185|lbs|kg}}.\n\n===Experiment===\nSpurlock followed specific rules governing his eating habits:\n* He must fully eat three McDonald's meals per day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n* He must consume every item on the McDonald's menu at least once over the course of the 30 days (he managed this in nine days).\n* He must only ingest items that are offered on the McDonald's menu, including [[bottled water]]. All outside consumption of food is prohibited.\n* He must [[Super Size]] the meal if offered, but he cannot request to Super Size on his own.\n* He will attempt to walk about as much as a typical United States citizen, based on a suggested figure of 5,000 standardized distance steps per day,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.verywellfit.com/how-many-steps-per-day-are-enough-3432827|title=How Many Steps Should You Aim for Each Day?|date=2020-12-09|last=Bumgardner|first=Wendy|publisher=VeryWellFit|access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref><ref name=film>{{cite AV media | people=Mark Fenton (Former ''Walking Magazine'' editor; Morgan Spurlock (director, producer, star)| date=2004 | title=Super Size Me| type=Motion picture}}<!--Figured supplied by Mark Fenton in a scene from the movie--></ref> but he did not closely adhere to this, as he walked more while in [[New York City|New York]] than in [[Houston]].\n\nOn February 1, Spurlock starts the month with breakfast near his home in [[Manhattan]], where there is an average of four McDonald's locations (and 66,950 residents, with twice as many commuters) per square mile (2.6&nbsp;km\u00b2). He aims to keep the distances he walks in line with the 5,000 steps (approximately two miles) walked per day by the average American.\n\nDay 2 brings Spurlock's first (of nine) Super Size meal, at the McDonald's on 34th Street and Tenth Avenue, which is a meal made of a [[Quarter Pounder|Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese]], Super Size French fries, and a 42-ounce [[Coca-Cola]], which took him 22 minutes to eat. He experiences steadily increasing stomach discomfort during the process, and then finally [[vomiting|vomits]] in the McDonald's parking lot.\n\nAfter five days Spurlock has gained {{convert|9.5|lb|kg}} (from 185.5 to about 195 pounds). It is not long before he finds himself experiencing [[depression (mood)|depression]], and he claims that his bouts of it along with [[lethargy]], and [[headache]]s could be relieved by eating a McDonald's meal. His [[general practitioner]] describes him as being \"addicted\". At his second weigh-in, he had gained another {{convert|8|lb|kg}}, putting his weight at {{convert|203.5|lb|kg}}. By the end of the month he weighs about {{convert|210|lb|kg}}, an increase of about 24.5 pounds (about 11&nbsp;kg). Because he could only eat McDonald's food for a month, Spurlock refused to take any medication at all. At one weigh-in, Spurlock ''lost'' 1&nbsp;lb. from the previous weigh-in, and a [[nutritionist]] hypothesized that he had lost [[muscle mass]], which weighs more than an identical volume of fat. At another weigh-in, a nutritionist said that he gained {{convert|17|lb|kg}} in 12 days.\n\nSpurlock's then-girlfriend, Alexandra Jamieson, attests to the fact that Spurlock lost much of his energy and [[libido|sex drive]] during his experiment. It was not clear at the time whether or not Spurlock would be able to complete the full month of the high-fat, high-[[carbohydrate]] diet, and family and friends began to express concern.\n\nOn Day 21, Spurlock has heart [[palpitations]]. His [[internist]], Dr. Daryl Isaacs, advises him to stop what he is doing immediately to avoid any serious health problems. He compares Spurlock with the protagonist played by [[Nicolas Cage]] in the movie ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]'', who intentionally drinks himself to death in a matter of weeks. Despite this warning, Spurlock decides to continue the experiment.\n\nOn March 2, Spurlock makes it to day 30 and achieves his goal. In thirty days, he has \"Supersized\" his meals nine times along the way (five of which were in [[Texas]], four in New York City). His physicians are surprised at the degree of deterioration in Spurlock's health. He notes that he has eaten as many McDonald's meals as most nutritionists say the ordinary person should eat in eight years (he ate 90 meals, which is close to the number of meals consumed once a month in an eight-year period).\n\n===Findings===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2014}}\nThe documentary's end text states that it took Spurlock five months to lose {{convert|20.1|lb|kg}} and another nine months to lose the last {{convert|4.5|lb|kg}}. His then-girlfriend Alex, now his ex-wife, began supervising his recovery with her \"[[detox diet]]\", which became the basis for her book, ''The Great American Detox Diet''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jamieson |first=Alex |title=The Great American Detox Diet |website=HowToBeFit.com |url=http://www.howtobefit.com/great-american-detox-diet.htm |access-date=May 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe movie ends with a [[rhetorical question]], \"Who do you want to see go first, you or them?\" This is accompanied by a cartoon tombstone, which reads \"Ronald McDonald (1954\u20132012)\", which originally appeared in ''[[The Economist]]'' in an article addressing the ethics of marketing to children.<ref name=film/><!--Spurlock, in audio commentary track-->\n\nA short epilogue was added to the film. It showed that the salads can contain even more calories than burgers if the customer adds liberal amounts of cheese and dressing prior to consumption. Also, it described McDonald's discontinuation of the [[Supersize|Super Size]] option six weeks after the movie's premiere, as well as its recent emphasis on healthier menu items such as salads, and the release of the new adult [[Happy Meal]].

He primarily criticized the dramatic and unscientific approach of ''Super Size Me'', saying Spurlock unnecessarily ate more than he had to and ignored his nutritionist's advice. Davis explained he would have been more interested had the documentary been about trying to eat as healthy as possible at McDonald's: \"You could choose low-fat options, but it would be impossible to get enough vegetables and fiber, and the low-fat meal would be incredibly bland, the product of a system that has worked to optimize food delivery and consistency and, in doing so, has invented foods so devoid of flavor that they require dressings, oils, beef tallow and goopy coatings to make them more than just textured blobs. The industry has worked hard to convince consumers that these odd, sweet flavors are not only good but also unique, recognizable parts of a brand. Spurlock doesn't attempt to convey this message, presumably because the affects{{sic}} of too few vegetables and too little fiber aren't as dramatic as speedy weight-and-cholesterol gains.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Davis |first=Robert |title=Super Size Me, directed by Morgan Spurlock |date=July 20, 2004 |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2004/07/super-size-me.html |magazine=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |access-date=2022-08-28}}</ref>\n\nMcDonald's UK responded that the author intentionally consumed an average of 5,000 calories per day and did not exercise, and that the results would have been the same regardless of the source of overeating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcdonalds.co.uk/pages/global/supersize.html |title=McDonald's UK position on 'Super Size Me' |date=August 2004 |website=McDonald's UK |access-date=April 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012135323/http://mcdonalds.co.uk/pages/global/supersize.html |archive-date=October 12, 2007 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter-claims===\nIn his reply documentary ''[[Fat Head]]'', Tom Naughton \"suggests that Spurlock's calorie and fat counts don't add up\" and noted Spurlock's refusal to publish the ''Super Size Me'' food log.
