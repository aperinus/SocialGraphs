It was included in the [[Animation show of shows|Animation Show of Shows]] in 2009.\n\nIn a CGSociety article, Sohn says his idea for the film came from watching ''[[Dumbo]]'' as a child: in the movie, a stork delivers Dumbo, leading a young Sohn to wonder where the birds got their babies from. His conclusion was that the babies came from clouds, hence flying animals being needed to deliver them.<ref>{{cite web|title=CGSociety - Peter Sohn |url=http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=4996 |publisher=The CGSociety |date=12 April 2009 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412064710/http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=4996 |archive-date=12 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nAll day long, cheerful clouds in the sky make cute and cuddly babies, such as human boys and girls, kittens, puppies, and other creatures, and give them to [[stork]]s for delivery to the expectant parents. However, one lonely gray cloud named Gus has the task of creating animals that are cute but not so cuddly. His delivery stork, Peck, gets the worst of it, being bitten by a [[crocodile]], butted by a [[bighorn sheep]], and pricked by a [[porcupine]]. When Peck sees that his next delivery is a baby [[shark]], he grows more than a little fearful and flies away.\n\nFeeling rejected, despondent, and angry, Gus unleashes a brief [[thunderstorm]], then starts crying with [[Downburst|rain pouring from below him]]. Peck, however, soon returns with a [[football helmet]] and [[Shoulder pads (sport)|shoulder pads]], created for him by another cloud to keep him safe (alluded to in an earlier scene, where the same cloud creates a baby that would grow to love football). Gus instantly cheers up and gives Peck an [[electric eel]] to deliver, which shocks him despite the protective equipment; this time, though, Peck remains in good (but slightly frazzled) spirits.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://www.pixar.com/partly-cloudy#partly-cloudy-main}}\n* {{IMDb title|1425244}}\n* {{bcdb title|id=112753|title=Partly Cloudy}}\n\n{{Pixar}}\n\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2009 computer-animated films]]\n[[Category:2009 short films]]\n[[Category:2009 3D films]]\n[[Category:2000s American animated films]]\n[[Category:2000s animated short films]]\n[[Category:3D animated short films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about birds]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Giacchino]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Sohn]]\n[[Category:Animated films without speech]]\n[[Category:Pixar short films]]\n[[Category:Viral videos]]\n\n\n{{2000s-Disney-animation-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
