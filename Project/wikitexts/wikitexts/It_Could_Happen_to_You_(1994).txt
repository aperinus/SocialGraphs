His wife Muriel works in a hairdressing salon and, unlike Charlie, is selfish, greedy and materialistic, constantly complaining about their situation in life. Waitress Yvonne Biasi, is bankrupt because her husband Eddie, whom she had not yet been able to afford to [[divorce]], took her [[credit card]] and spent $12,000 without her permission.\n\nCharlie meets Yvonne when she waits on him at the diner where she works. Since Charlie doesn't have enough money to pay the tip, he promises Yvonne to give her either double the tip or half of his prospective lottery winnings. He wins $4 million (in 21 annual payments) in the lottery the next day and keeps his promise, despite the protests of his wife. He and Yvonne become stars almost immediately.\n\nYvonne buys the diner she was working in. She sets up a table with Charlie's name at which people who cannot afford food can eat for free. In another development, Charlie becomes a hero for foiling an attempted robbery at a grocery store but gets wounded in the process, forcing him to take leave from the police force.\n\nAt a gathering on a chartered boat for the lottery winners and other members of high society, Muriel gets to know the newly rich Jack Gross. She flirts with him and later starts an affair. Meanwhile, Charlie and Yvonne spend a lot of time together, often giving gifts to passengers of the subway or to children, about which the media report. Muriel gets fed up with Charlie's constant donations and overall simplicity and throws him out of their apartment, asking for a divorce.\n\nThat same evening, Yvonne leaves her apartment after her husband shows up and threatens to stay until he gets $50,000 from her. Quite innocently, Charlie and Yvonne run into each other at the [[Plaza Hotel]] and, unintentionally, end up spending the night together.\n\nWhen Muriel and Charlie divorce, Muriel wants all the money that Charlie won for herself. Charlie doesn't mind giving his share of the money but Muriel also wants the money he gave Yvonne, which causes Charlie to take the case to court. The jury decides in Muriel's favor. Yvonne, feeling guilty at costing Charlie all his money, runs out of court in tears and tries to keep away from Charlie. But the cop, by now hopelessly in love with the waitress, finds her at the diner and tells her that the money means nothing to him, and they declare their love for each other. While ruminating about their future at the diner, they are gracious enough to provide a hungry and poor customer some soup, which he eats at the special table. The poor customer is none other than the disguised reporter Angel Dupree, who takes photos of the couple and in the next day's newspapers publicly praises their willingness to feed a hungry and poor man even in their darkest hour. Just as Charlie and Yvonne are giving up and moving out of town, the citizens of New York City, no doubt touched by the generosity of the couple, send \"the cop and the waitress\" thousands of letters with tips totaling about $600,000.\n\nAfter Charlie and Muriel get divorced, Muriel's new husband Jack Gross takes off with all her money, revealing himself to be a con man. She then moves in with her mother in [[The Bronx]] and goes back to her old manicure job. Yvonne's ex-husband Eddie ends up being a taxi driver. Charlie happily returns to the police force and Yvonne reclaims the diner. At the film's end, Charlie and Yvonne get married and begin their honeymoon by taking off from [[Central Park]] in a hot air balloon that bears the ''[[New York Post]]'' headline \"Cop Weds Waitress\", just before the closing credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Nicolas Cage]] as Charlie Lang\n*[[Bridget Fonda]] as Yvonne Biasi\n*[[Rosie Perez]] as Muriel Lang\n*[[Wendell Pierce]] as Bo Williams\n*[[Isaac Hayes]] as Angel Dupree\n*[[Stanley Tucci]] as Eddie Biasi\n*Victor Rojas as Jesu\n*[[Seymour Cassel]] as Jack Gross\n*[[J.E.

In March of that year, Officer Robert Cunningham, a regular patron and longtime friend of Penzo, suggested that the two split a lottery ticket, each of them choosing three of the six numbers, in lieu of his leaving her a tip. Penzo agreed, and though she subsequently forgot about it, when Cunningham discovered that the ticket had won a $6 million prize, he honored their verbal agreement and split the money evenly with Penzo.<ref name=ew/>\n\nBeyond this basic premise, the film is entirely fictional, with the backgrounds of the film's characters and the events depicted in the film subsequent to their lottery win bearing no resemblance to the actual lives of Penzo and Cunningham. As a result, neither Penzo nor Cunningham were required to authorize the film, nor were they entitled to collect royalties from its proceeds.<ref>David, Will. (2004, June 26). \"Lottery spouse dies in roof fall\", ''[[The Journal News]]''</ref>  The closing credits of the film include a disclaimer stating that although the film was inspired by actual events, at the time of production both Penzo and Cunningham were happily married to their respective spouses.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0110167|It Could Happen to You}}\n*{{mojo title|itcouldhappentoyou|It Could Happen to You}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|1054344-it_could_happen_to_you|It Could Happen to You}}\n\n{{Andrew Bergman}}\n{{Jane Anderson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:It Could Happen To You (Film)}}\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Comedy films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Carter Burwell]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Andrew Bergman]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jane Anderson]]\n[[Category:1994 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1994 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:Films about lotteries]]"}]}}}}
