The film was directed by [[Morten Tyldum]] and stars [[Aksel Hennie]], [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] and [[Synn\u00f8ve Macody Lund]]. Hennie portrays the successful but insecure corporate recruiter Roger Brown who lives a double life as an [[Art theft|art thief]] to fund his lavish lifestyle. He finds out that one of his job prospects is in possession of a valuable painting and sets out to steal it.\n\nReleased in Norway on 26 August 2011, ''Headhunters'' was a box office success, receiving positive reviews, and was nominated for multiple awards, including four [[Amanda Award]]s and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nIt is the highest-grossing Norwegian film in history.<ref>{{Cite web |date= October 27, 2011 |author= Christopher Rosen |title= The Norwegian Film That's a Bigger Success Than 'Harry Potter' and 'Transformers' |url= http://news.moviefone.com/2011/10/27/headhunters-norway-biggest-hit/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129105938/http://news.moviefone.com/2011/10/27/headhunters-norway-biggest-hit/ |archive-date=2014-11-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRoger Brown ([[Aksel Hennie]]), Norway's most successful headhunter, supports his lavish lifestyle by stealing paintings from his clients; his partner, Ove ([[:no:Eivind Sander|Eivind Sander]]), works at a surveillance company and deactivates security at the victims' homes, allowing Roger to swap the art for a counterfeit. Asked to dinner by his mistress, Lotte ([[Julie \u00d8lgaard]]), Roger declines and ends their relationship. Roger's wife and art gallery owner, Diana ([[Synn\u00f8ve Macody Lund]]), introduces him to Clas Greve ([[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]]), a former executive for [[global positioning system|GPS tech]] company HOTE, who wants to work for Pathfinder, for whom Roger is recruiting. Diana reveals that Clas has asked her to authenticate a lost [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] painting he inherited that is believed to be worth millions.\n\nRoger takes Clas to lunch to discuss the job, and soon learns Clas used to be a member of Pathfinder, a special forces unit that specialized in tracking people and winner of the European [[Military pentathlon]]. Despite his misgivings, Roger meets with Ove to work out details on stealing the painting. Roger manages to steal it from Clas' home, but he discovers Diana's cellphone beside Clas' bed. Later, after a seemingly successful meeting with Pathfinder executives, an upset Roger flippantly informs Clas that the company may be looking for someone else to fill the position.\n\nThe next morning, Roger finds Ove in his (Roger's) car, apparently dead from a poison syringe embedded in the car seat; when Roger dumps Ove in a lake, the water revives him, as he did not get a full dose of the poison. Driving Ove to his cabin, Roger puts him in bed and ignores his demands for medical attention, as he does not want the police involved. Ove pulls a gun in response, causing a shoot-out where Roger accidentally kills Ove. Finding Clas has followed him to Ove's cabin, Roger narrowly escapes after a scuffle. Trying to lose Clas' tracking devices, Roger switches his car for Ove's and throws his clothes in a lake, changing into Ove's spare uniform and fleeing to a farm where Ove used to stay. Clas tails Roger to the farm with his dog and murders the farmer, but Roger evades them. Trying to escape on a tractor, Roger is attacked by Clas' dog, which he kills by impaling it on the tractor's forks. Roger, believing Clas is chasing him, drives erratically and falls from the tractor, only to find his pursuer is a stranger wanting to help.\n\nWaking in a hospital, Roger learns the police think he is Ove, and arrest him for the farmer's murder when he tries to escape. Driving to the station, the officers pull over to block a truck reported stolen. Remembering that Clas developed a nanotechnology gel that is very difficult to remove, Roger realizes that he is being tracked through GPS gel rubbed in his hair by Diana, and Clas is driving the truck; despite Roger's protests, the officers ignore him, allowing Clas to ram the car off a cliff. Playing dead until Clas leaves the scene, Roger shaves his head and hides his hair on a body, then swaps clothes with a detective's disfigured body to fake his death.\n\nRoger turns to Lotte for help, only to discover she has always worked for Clas, who is still a HOTE executive and trying to steal Pathfinder's secrets. Lotte admits that she put the GPS gel in Roger's hair, and that she suggested dinner so she could introduce him to Clas; since Roger ended their affair, Clas used a counterfeit Rubens painting to meet Roger through Diana. When Roger lets his guard down, Lotte attacks him with a knife, causing Roger to shoot and kill her in self-defense. Roger returns home and admits everything to Diana, who apologizes for her affair with Clas. The next morning, Roger goes to a morgue to retrieve his cut hair, while Diana contacts Clas to resume their affair.\n\nWhile cleaning Ove's cabin of evidence, Roger is confronted by Clas, who was able to track the location transmitters in the cut hair. Clas gloats that Diana has returned to him, and tries to shoot Roger but fails. Roger fatally wounds Clas with Ove's gun, explaining that Diana only resumed their affair so she could load Clas' gun with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]]. Ove's home security records Clas involved in a shootout, though Roger stays in a camera blind spot near Ove. The footage, combined with evidence doctored by Roger, suggests Ove and Clas were art thieves who killed the farmer, Lotte, then finally each other after a dispute, and the police ignore the minor inconsistencies because they want the case closed. Later, Roger and a visibly pregnant Diana are shown selling their house, and Roger returns to work, giving the Pathfinder job to the client he rejected and robbed at the beginning of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aksel Hennie]] as Roger Brown\n* [[Synn\u00f8ve Macody Lund]] as Diana Brown\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Clas Greve\n* {{Interlanguage link|Eivind Sander|no}} as Ove Kjikerud\n* [[Julie \u00d8lgaard]] as Lotte Madsen\n* [[Reidar S\u00f8rensen]] as Brede Sperre\n* {{Interlanguage link|Kyrre Haugen Sydness|no}}as Jeremias Lander\n* Mads Mogeland as Joar Sunded\n* [[Baard Owe]] as Sindre Aa\n* Torgrim Mellum Stene as Atle Nerum\n* {{Interlanguage link|Mattis Herman Nyquist|no}} as Ferdinand\n* [[Nils J\u00f8rgen Kaalstad]] as Stig\n* {{Interlanguage link|Joachim Rafaelsen|no}} as Brugd\n* Gunnar Skramstad Johnsen as Eskild Monsen\n* Lars Skramstad Johnsen as Endride Monsen\n\n==Production and remake==\n{{Anchor|Production}} \nThe Swedish production company [[Yellow Bird (company)|Yellow Bird]] acquired the [[film rights]] to Jo Nesb\u00f8's 2008 novel ''Headhunters'' in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yellow Bird vil lage Jo Nesb\u00f8-film|url=http://rushprint.no/2009/5/yellow-bird-vil-lage-jo-nesbofilm/ |newspaper=Rushprint|date=12 May 2009|access-date=3 February 2013}}</ref> It was the first of Nesb\u00f8's novels to be turned into a film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Se Aksel Hennie i \"Hodejegerne\"|author=Kristoffer Pettersen Ramb\u00f8l and Liza Stokke|url=http://www.nrk.no/kultur-og-underholdning/1.7334814|newspaper=NRK|date=13 October 2010|access-date=3 February 2013}}</ref> The film was shot in and around [[Oslo]] on a budget of 30 million [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] over 40 days.<ref name=\"dagbladet\"/> The film lacked aerial shots that they needed but ran out of money and instead archive footage scenes from the Swedish film [[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] was used and was digitally altered to change the type of car.<ref name=\"aftenposten\" />\n\nA [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] remake of ''Headhunters'' was planned, with the British journalist and screenwriter [[Sacha Gervasi]] writing the screenplay.<ref>{{cite news|title=N\u00e5 skrives Hollywood-versjonen av \"Hodejegerne\"|author=Peder Ottosen |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/12/15/kultur/litteratur/film/jo_nesbo/19428673/|newspaper=[[Dagbladet]]|date=15 December 2011 |access-date=3 April 2012|language=no}}</ref> The rights to the English-language remake were sold to the American film studio [[Summit Entertainment]] in 2011 while the Norwegian film was still in production.<ref>{{cite news|title=Summit plans English-language remake of Norwegian thriller Headhunters|author=Jorn Rossing Jensen|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/summit-plans-english-language-remake-of-norwegian-thriller-headhunters/5033161.article|newspaper=[[Screen International]]|date=11 October 2011 |access-date=3 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/03/headhunters-remale-morten-tyldum-the-imitation-game-yellow-bird-1201715931/|title=Morten Tyldum Developing 'Headhunters' U.S. Remake With Yellow Bird|publisher=Deadline|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=March 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Anchor|Music|Soundtrack|Score}} \nTracks used in the movie include:<ref>[http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/headhunters Headhunters] Soundtrack (and confirmed with the soundtrack listing on the DVD)</ref>\n* \"Weathervane\" by Weathervane (writing name of [[Jimmy Gnecco]] and [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy]]) -
