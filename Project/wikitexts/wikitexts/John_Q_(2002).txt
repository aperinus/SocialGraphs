The film tells the story of John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington), a father and husband whose son is diagnosed with an [[enlarged heart]] and who finds out he is unable to receive a [[Organ transplantation|transplant]] because [[Health maintenance organization|HMO]] insurance will not cover it, before he decides to hold hostages at the hospital and force them to do it.\n\nThe film co-stars [[Robert Duvall]], [[Kimberly Elise]], [[Anne Heche]], [[James Woods]], and [[Ray Liotta]]. The film was shot in [[Toronto]],<ref name=\"torontoist\">{{cite web|title=Reel Toronto: John Q|url=http://torontoist.com/2009/07/reel_toronto_john_q.php|work=online news|publisher=Torontoist}}</ref> [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and [[Canmore, Alberta]], although the story takes place in [[Chicago]]. Shooting took place for 60 days from August 8 to November 3, 2000. The film was released on February 15, 2002. It received generally negative reviews from critics; however, the film grossed $102 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nA young woman is killed in a collision with a truck. Weeks earlier in Chicago, factory worker John Quincy Archibald and his wife Denise are behind with their financial payment. One day after church they rush their young son Michael to the hospital after he collapses at his baseball game, and are told by cardiologist Dr. Raymond Turner and administrator Rebecca Payne that Michael needs a heart transplant. The hospital requires $75,000 down payment of the procedure's $250,000 cost to place Michael on the organ transplant list. John discovers that his health insurance will not cover the surgery.\n\nJohn and Denise struggle to raise the money and the hospital prepares to send Michael home to die. Determined to save his son, John takes Dr. Turner and several patients and staff hostage at gunpoint in the ER. Police negotiator Lt. Frank Grimes makes contact with John, who demands Payne put Michael's name on the organ transplant list.\n\nGrimes clashes with his superior Chief Gus Monroe, while most of the hostages sympathize with John's plight and reflect on the flaws of [[Health care in the United States|America's healthcare system]]. One of the nurses revealed that Michael's condition could have been detected much earlier during routine checkup but the doctor ignored it to gain bonus from insurance company to keep his mouth shut to maintain their profit. Agreeing to release some of the patients, John is attacked by hostage Mitch, whose abused girlfriend Julie helps John subdue and handcuff Mitch. John frees expectant couple Steve and Miriam and immigrant mother Rosa with her infant son, who all declare their support for John to the news crews outside. Grimes and Payne reveal John's actions to Denise, and Payne places Michael on the list to perform the operation [[pro bono]].\n\nOverriding Grimes, Monroe has a SWAT sniper enter the ER via an air shaft, luring John into the line of fire with a phone call from Denise. John speaks with Michael as his condition worsens, while a news crew hacks the police surveillance feed and broadcasts John's conversation with his family. John discovers the hacked news footage just as the sniper fires, wounding him in the shoulder. John overpowers the sniper and uses him as a human shield as he reiterates his demands in front of a cheering crowd. As night falls, Michael is removed from the ICU and brought to the ER in exchange for the sniper's release, while Denise waits at the police command post.\n\nJohn reveals his intention to die by suicide to save Michael with his own heart, and also reveals that his gun was empty all along. He persuades Turner to perform the operation, and Julie and security guard Max bear witness to John's impromptu will. He says his goodbyes to Michael, and prepares to end his own life using the only bullet he brought, when Denise brings news that the heart of a recently deceased organ donor \u2013 the motorist from the beginning of the film \u2013 is on the way. Once the heart arrives, John releases the hostages, including patient Lester, who surrenders to police posing as John. John, posing as a surgeon, accompanies Michael to the operating room where Grimes, who noticed the switch, allows him to watch Michael's operation before arresting him.\n\nThree months later, John's actions have sparked national debate about healthcare, and in court his family, friends and all the hostages testify on his behalf at trial. John is ultimately acquitted of attempted murder and armed criminal action, but convicted of kidnapping and false imprisonment. His lawyer assures him that he will likely serve no more than two years. As John is escorted from the courthouse, Lester proclaims him as a hero, and now-healthy Michael gains eye contact with his father, saying \"Dad!\" and then, \"Thank you\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as John Quincy Archibald\n* [[Kimberly Elise]] as Denise Archibald\n* Daniel E.
