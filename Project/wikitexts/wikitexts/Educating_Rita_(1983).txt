The film stars [[Michael Caine]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] and [[Maureen Lipman]]. It won multiple major awards for best actor and best actress and was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]].\n\nCaine and Walters both won [[BAFTA Awards|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe]] awards for best actor and actress. The [[British Film Institute]] ranked ''Educating Rita'' the [[BFI Top 100 British films|84th greatest British film of the 20th century]].<ref>[http://www.cinemarealm.com/best-of-cinema/top-100-british-films/ ''British Film Institute - Top 100 British Films''] (1999). Retrieved 27 October 2017</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSusan (who initially calls herself Rita), a 26-year-old [[working-class]] hairdresser, is dissatisfied with the routine of her work and social life; she is reluctant to have a child, fearing it will permanently tie her to the same monotonous routine for life, and she yearns to escape to something more profound, without exactly knowing what that is. She seeks to better herself by signing up for and attending an [[Open University]] course in English Literature.\n\nSusan's assigned Open University professor, Frank Bryant, is jaded and has long ago openly taken to the bottle, describing his occupational ability as \"appalling but good enough for his appalling students\". Bryant's passion for literature is reignited by Rita, whose technical ability for the subject is limited by her lack of education but whose enthusiasm Frank finds refreshing. Frank initially has misgivings about Rita's ability to adapt to student culture, but is impressed by her verve and earnestness and is forced to re-examine his attitudes and position in life; Susan finds Frank's tutelage opens doors to a bohemian lifestyle and a new self-confidence.\n\nFrank's bitterness and cynicism return as he notices Susan beginning to adopt the pretensions of the university culture he despises. Susan becomes disillusioned by a friend's attempted suicide and realises that her new social niche is rife with the same dishonesty and superficiality she had previously sought to escape. The film ends as Frank, sent to Australia on a sabbatical, welcomes the possibilities of the change.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Dr. Frank Bryant\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Susan \"Rita\" White\n* [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] as Brian\n* [[Dearbhla Molloy]] as Elaine\n* [[Jeananne Crowley]] as Julia, Frank's girlfriend\n* Malcolm Douglas as Denny White, Rita's husband\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as Rita's father\n* Patricia Jeffares as Rita's mother\n* Maeve Germaine as Sandra, Rita's sister\n* [[Maureen Lipman]] as Trish, Rita's roommate\n* Gerry Sullivan as Security Officer\n* Pat Daly as Bursar\n* Kim Fortune as Collins\n* Philip Hurdwood as Tiger\n* Hilary Reynolds as Lesley\n* Jack Walsh as Price\n* [[Christopher Casson]] as Professor\n* [[Gabrielle Reidy]] as Barbara\n* Des Nealon as Invigilator\n* [[Marie Conmee]] as Customer in Hairdressers\n* Oliver Maguire as Tutor\n* [[Derry Power]] as Photographer\n* [[Alan Stanford]] as Bistro Manager\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nLewis Gilbert says it was difficult to raise finance for the film. \"Columbia wanted me to cast [[Dolly Parton]] as Rita\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/10/culture.features2 |title=Of human Bondage|date=9 March 2000|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Julie Walters, in her feature film debut, reprised her role from the stage production.\n\nThe film is set in an unnamed English university and port city: most of the working-class characters have [[Scouse]] accents. However, it was shot entirely in and around [[Dublin]], where minor adjustments were made to suggest the city is in the UK: in several street scenes, for example, British [[red telephone box]]es appear. [[Trinity College, Dublin]], is used as the setting for the university, and [[University College, Dublin]], in [[Belfield, Dublin|Belfield]], is used for Rita's summer school. The rooms used by Bryant as his office and tutorial room were those of the [[College Historical Society]] and the [[University Philosophical Society]], respectively; and while the building was considerably refurnished, the production chose to leave portraits of [[Douglas Hyde]] and [[Isaac Butt]] and committee photographs in the former, and a bust of [[John Pentland Mahaffy]] in the latter. No. 8 Hogan Avenue in [[Dublin 2]], near [[Grand Canal Dock]], was used for Rita's house in the film, and one in Burlington Road, [[Ballsbridge]], for Bryant's. The scene where Rita runs into her ex Denny and his new wife was filmed in the [[South Lotts]] area of [[Ringsend]]. The scene in France was filmed in [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth|Maynooth]], [[County Kildare]], and [[Pearse Station]] and [[Dublin Airport]] were used. The pub scene was shot in [[The Stag's Head]] on Dame Court in Dublin. However, the pub which Rita enters is the Dame Tavern which is opposite The Stag's Head. Filming also took place in [[Stoneybatter]], with Aughrim Street Church being used for the wedding scene. Stanhope Street School was used as a production base.<ref>{{cite web|title=Educating Rita film locations|url=http://www.reelstreets.com/index.php/component/films/?task=view&id=1716&film_ref=educating_rita&limitstart=0|publisher=Reelstreets.com|access-date=10 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n{{Anchor|Critics}}\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine in December 1982 lauded Walters' interpretation of Rita as \"[w]itty, down-to-earth, kind and loaded with common sense\". \"Rita,\" the review continues, \"is the antithesis of the humorless, stuffy and stagnated academic world she so longs to infiltrate.

He describes Walters's \"splendidly rich interpretation\" of Rita and characterises her \"reactions to the traditions of English lit[erature] [as] carry[ing] the caustic brilliance of true intelligence, a shattering of blithe pretension\".  Of Walters and Caine, Nathan opines, \"they make a beautifully odd couple, in a love story at one remove\". This reviewer depicts the director's effort as \"effective, and finally optimistic,\" and observes about the film that the playwright's \"angry message that people are trapped by their environment not their abilities, is salved by the sweetness of [Frank's and Rita's] final parting.\"  Nathan's \"verdict\" of the film is one of \"[c]harming, glittering characterisations that, though they don't run deep, nevertheless refresh.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Nathan |first= Ian| url= https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/educating-rita-review/ | title= Educating Rita |work= [[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |date= 1 January 2000 |access-date= 2 February 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"an awkward blend of intellectual pretension and cute obvious humour\" and \"the perfect play about literature for anyone who wouldn't dream of actually reading books\"; she wrote that \"the essentially two-character play has been opened up to the point that it includes a variety of settings and subordinate figures, but it never approaches anything lifelike\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Maslin |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F00E3D71138F932A1575AC0A965948260 |title=Educating Rita (1983) |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 September 1983 |access-date=7 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nFilm critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film two stars out of four, calling the film a \"forced march through a formula relationship\"; he said Russell's screen adaptation \"added mistresses, colleagues, husbands, in-laws, students and a faculty committee, [that were] all unnecessary\" and said the playwright/screenwriter \"start[ed] with an idealistic, challenging idea, and then cynically tr[ied] to broaden its appeal\".<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/educating-rita-1983 |url-status=live |archive-date=9 October 2012 |title=Educating Rita |date=28 October 1983 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=21 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\n''Educating Rita'' holds an 81% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on sixteen reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Educating Rita |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]  |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/educating_rita }}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
