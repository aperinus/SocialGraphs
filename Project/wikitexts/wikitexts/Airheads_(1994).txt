It tells the story of a band of loser musicians who stage a [[wikt:Special:Search/hijack|hijacking]] of a [[radio station]] in order to get [[airplay]] for their [[Demo (music)|demo recording]].\n\nThe film was met with negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nChazz, Rex, and Pip are in a Los Angeles hard rock band called \"The Lone Rangers\" who are continuously turned down as they try to get their demo tape heard by record producers like Jimmie Wing. After scolding him for being lazy, Chazz's girlfriend Kayla kicks him out of her apartment. The Lone Rangers decide to try to get the local rock station KPPX to play their reel-to-reel tape on the air and attempt to break-in through the back door. After several unsuccessful attempts, a station employee named Suzzi comes out to smoke and they keep the door from shutting behind her.\n\nOnce inside, laid back DJ Ian \"The Shark\" begins talking with them on the air. Station manager Milo overhears them and intervenes but Ian continues broadcasting. After Milo insults Rex by calling him \"Hollywood Boulevard trash,\" he and Chazz pull out realistic-looking water pistols filled with hot sauce and demand airplay. After setting up an old [[reel-to-reel]] for the demo, the tape begins to play but is quickly destroyed when the player malfunctions. The guys try to run, but Doug Beech had already called the police and they see the building is surrounded.\n\nThey negotiate with the police who are now tasked to find Kayla who has a cassette of the demo. Since the station never went off the air, news of the hostage crisis travels quickly and numerous hard rock/metal fans begin showing up outside the radio station interfering with police. A [[SWAT]] team has also arrived where Carl Mace prefers using force over negotiation tactics by Sergeant O'Malley. His team secretly passes a gun through a roof vent to Beech who has been hiding in the air ducts. During the crisis, it is revealed that Milo had secretly signed a deal to change KPPX's format to [[Adult Contemporary]] which includes having to fire Ian and most of the other employees. When this comes out, Ian and a few employees side with the band and turn against Milo.\n\nThe police find Kayla who arrives at the radio station to deliver the tape. However, the tape is damaged because she threw it out of the car earlier. Chazz and Kayla get into an argument that quickly escalates and results in the studio console being destroyed, dashing any hopes to play the tape on the air.\n\nAs some of the items the band demanded from police are brought into the station, the door shuts on Rex's plastic gun revealing it to be fake. Seeing this, some of the hostages run out with one telling the SWAT team the band's guns are not real. As the team assembles to storm the station, Beech corners the band from a low hanging air vent. Knowing he no longer will have a job at the station, Ian knocks down Beech's gun. This causes the weapon to wildly fire several rounds and the police are forced to back off. Ian picks up the gun but gives it to a somewhat confused Chazz in a final act of anti-establishment rebellion.\n\nJimmie Wing comes to the radio station and offers the band a contract. They reluctantly agree to the deal knowing they have no more options. Wing arranges an entire stage and sound system to be airlifted to the roof where the band will play their song for the now huge crowd outside. To the band's dismay, they find only the PA is real and everything else is just props. Refusing to [[lip sync]] as their tape is played, they instead destroy their instruments in protest to the delight of the crowd and [[stage dive]] into the hands of the cheering audience that O'Malley has his men let through.\n\nThe Lone Rangers are later seen playing a gig inside the prison where they are incarcerated as Kayla and Suzzi dance in the background. The concert is being shown live on [[MTV]]. Now their manager, Ian says on the phone to an unknown person that The Lone Rangers will start touring in six months or \"three months if they behave themselves\".\n\nA postscript states that The Lone Rangers served three months for kidnapping, theft, and assault with hot pepper sauce with their album ''LIVE IN PRISON'' going [[Music recording sales certification#Certification thresholds|triple platinum]].\n\n==Cast==\n;Main\n{{castlist|\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Chester \"Chazz Darby\" Ogilvie, the lead guitarist and lead vocalist of the Lone Rangers\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Rex, the bassist of the Lone Rangers\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Pip, the drummer of the Lone Rangers and the brother of Rex\n* [[Chris Farley]] as Officer Wilson, a police officer involved in dealing with the hostage crisis\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Sergeant O'Malley, the head of a SWAT team involved in dealing with the hostage crisis\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Milo Jackson, the station manager of KPPX\n* [[Judd Nelson]] as Jimmie Wing, a self-serving record executive at Palatine Records that has repeatedly denied Chazz\n* [[Michael Richards]] as Doug Beech, the accountant at KPPX\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Ian \"The Shark\", a laid back DJ at KPPX\n* [[Amy Locane]] as Kayla, Chazz's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Nina Siemaszko]] as Suzzi, a worker at KPPX\n* [[Marshall Bell]] as Carl Mace, a SWAT officer involved in dealing with the hostage crisis\n* [[Reg E.
