Khitruk had not seen the [[Winnie the Pooh (franchise)|Disney adaptations]] while working on his own. He created the prototype drawings of the characters together with Vladimir Zuikov, a fellow animator from ''[[Film, Film, Film]]''.<ref name=int/>\n\nKhitruk followed the original book by [[A. A. Milne]] and based his first two parts of the trilogy on the Pooh's love for honey. However, while Milne accentuated the relationships between a boy ([[Christopher Robin]]) and his favorite toy Pooh, Khitruk removed Christopher Robin and made Pooh the leading character; his narrator is a \"true\" narrator who has no relation to the story whatsoever. Pooh is balanced by the Piglet; they are best friends and are present in all parts of the story. While Pooh always takes the initiative, he often seeks advice and help from the Piglet.<ref name=comp/> The main reason to remove Robin was to exclude a vastly superior character (a human), and put all others at an equal level.<ref name=int/>\n\nKhitruk followed his style and drew all scenes in two dimensions. His animation was relatively simple and slowly paced compared to other Milne adaptations. Instead, Khitruk put much emphasis on the dialogues and timing \u2013 every move of his characters and every character line are intended to bring hidden details and irony to viewers of all ages.<ref name=comp/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vladimir Osenev]] as the narrator. Osenev was a serious stage actor, who first despised the \"childish\" text and softened only after seeing the final result. Khitruk cast him because of his [[timbre]] and sarcasm.<ref name=int2/>  \n* [[Yevgeny Leonov]] as [[Winnie-the-Pooh]]. Khitruk tried several prominent actors without success \u2013 he favored Leonov, yet thought that his voice was too low. The sound engineer Georgy Martynyuk found a solution in speeding up his voice records. The same technique was used for Savvina who played the Piglet.<ref name=int2/><ref name=savvina/> \n* [[Iya Savvina]] as [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]]. Knowing that Savvina is a big fan of the Winnie-the-Pooh story, Khitruk invited her to review his first draft, and in the process cast her as the Piglet. Savvina based her intonation on [[Bella Akhmadulina]].<ref name=int2/><ref name=savvina/>\n\n==Legacy and awards==\nIn 1976, Khitruk was awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] for the ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' trilogy.<ref name=award/> The animation characters, as designed by Khitruk's team, are featured on the [[:File:1988 CPA 5916.jpg|1988 Soviet]] and [[:File:Stamp of Russia 2012 No 1652 Winnie-the-Pooh.jpg|2012 Russian]] postal stamps; they are permanently painted on a [[:File:RIAN archive 417728 The first of the \"Fairy Streetcar\" project launched in Sokolniki.jpg|public streetcar]] running through the [[Sokolniki Park]], and their sculptures are installed in [[Ramenki District]] in Moscow.<ref name=sculpt/>\n\nWhen Khitruk visited the Disney Studios, [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], the director of ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]'' that won the 1968 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]], told him that he liked the Soviet version better than his own.<ref name=award/><ref name=disney/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Soyuzmultfilm]]\n* [[Winnie-the-Pooh]]\n* [[A.
