Frenger Jr. (who asks to be called \"Junior\"), a violent [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] recently released from a California prison, starts a new life in [[Miami]]. Before leaving the airport, he steals luggage and kills a [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] by breaking his fingers. Junior checks into a hotel and hooks up with Susie Waggoner, a naive part time prostitute who is a student at a community college. They become romantically involved and move in to a house together, with Susie blissfully unaware of Junior's criminal activities and harboring fantasies of living happily ever after.\n\nLater, while Susie is taking a bath and writing a [[haiku]], Junior decides to break into a nearby apartment. He steals an [[IMI Desert Eagle]] handgun, a coin collection and some pork chops. As he is doing this, he speaks aloud a haiku of his own: \"Breaking entering. The dark and lonely places. Finding a big gun\".\n\nAn investigation of the Hare Krishna murder leads grizzled policeman Sgt. Hoke Moseley to come knocking on their door. Moseley shares a home-cooked dinner with the couple, upon Susie's suggestion, and plays it cool while seemingly indicating to Junior that he's on to him. He overtly suspects Junior has been in prison and wants him to come to the police station for a lineup. Junior goes to Moseley's home the next day, assaults him and steals his gun, badge and dentures. Junior begins using the badge, demanding [[bribery|bribes]] as rewards after breaking up robberies, only to keep the loot for himself.\n\nWhile at a convenience store, Junior witnesses an armed robbery and decides to break it up. He lectures the gunman about avoiding a life of crime, but the gunman runs a truck over him. Junior complains to Susie that the \"straight life\" has made him too soft. Moseley tracks down the couple through a utility account opened up in Susie's name. He pretends to run into her at the grocery store, where they swap recipes. After she lies that she has left Junior, Moseley tells her that Junior is a murderer and that he and the police are looking for him.\n\nBack home, to test whether he will lie to her, Susie deliberately ruins a pie by putting an excessive amount of vinegar in it. To her disappointment, Junior compliments the dessert and eats it with gusto though his face gives it away somewhat. The next day, Junior asks Susie to drive him around town on errands. Their first stop is a pawn shop, which he robs. In the course of the robbery, Junior kills the pawnbroker, but not before she chops several of his fingers off.\n\nBadly injured, he limps to the car, but Susie drives away upon realizing what he's done. Moseley pursues him to the house, where he shoots and kills Junior. Being ironic with his last words, Junior tells Moseley, \"Susie's gonna get you, Sarge.\" Susie then arrives and Moseley asks why she stayed with him for so long. She explains that he was kind to her, ate everything she ever cooked and never hit her.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Frederick J. Frenger Jr.\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Sgt. Hoke Moseley\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Susie Waggoner\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as Sgt. Bill Henderson\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Ellita S\u00e1nchez\n* [[Obba Babatund\u00e9]] as Blink Willie\n* [[Shirley Stoler]] as Edie Wulgemuth\n* [[Paul Gleason]] as Sgt. Frank Lackley\n\n==Production==\nThe film was the first feature directed by [[George Armitage]] in over a decade. He later recalled:\n<blockquote>Bill Horberg, who was associate producer, brought the book to Fred [Ward], and Fred said: \"Oh, this is great.\" I don't know if Bill had money or not to option the book, but Fred did, and he optioned it. He brought it to Jonathan [Demme] and Gary Goetzman, he wanted Jonathan to direct it. Jonathan had just finished ''[[Married to the Mob]]'', which hadn't been released yet, and he had shot in Miami, and he said to Fred: \"Why don't you give it to Din [George Armitage]? Give it to George.\" And he did, and I loved it. He said \"Do you want to write the script and direct it?\" I said \"Absolutely, let's go.\" I had worked for [[Mike Medavoy]], who was now head of Orion Pictures, on ''[[Vigilante Force]]'', and he said: \"Sure, good.\" Fred, Jonathan, and Gary\u2014who would go on to produce a number of wonderful things for Tom Hanks's company, though this was his first film\u2014were amazingly helpful.<ref name=\"film\">[http://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-george-armitage/ Nick Pinkerton, \"Interview with George Armitage\", ''Film Comment'' 28 April 2015]</ref></blockquote>\nArmitage says the script omitted a key plot point in the novel, that the Hare Krishna killed by Fred was Susie's brother. \"It took 10 or 15 pages to explain that relationship, and it bothered me\u2014that kind of serendipity. And we were just sitting there talking: \"Why do we need to have that anyways?\" It really was just a matter of economy. In early drafts it was in. In the novel it works beautifully, because it's Willeford.\"<ref name=\"film\"/>\nAt one stage [[Gene Hackman]] was going to play Hoke and Fred Ward was to play Junior. Then Hackman dropped out and Alec Baldwin came in to read.\n\n<blockquote>He knocked us out, so I said: \"Fred, what do you think?\" He said: \"He's Junior. I'll be Hoke.\" And Alec was extraordinary. It rained a lot during the shoot, which would shut us down because you could hear the rain on the roof, it was too loud, so we'd have to wait it out. One day we were sitting around Junior and Susie's house, and Alec gets behind the camera and does about a five-minute impression of [[Tak Fujimoto]]. Then he moves over to the electrical department and does spot-on impressions of all of those guys. Everybody was awestruck. He also did an impression of me that was rather insulting, and very funny. What I wanted to do in that was have the audience go on that ride with Junior while he was running around and playing cop, and to really enjoy it\u2014and the audiences I saw it with did\u2014but then slowly I wanted to take it away from them, so that by the end they would feel a little bit guilty about having so much fun earlier on in the picture. However, it kind of backfired\u2014we did a preview in New Jersey, and the audience was horrified when Junior died, they practically rioted when Alec was killed \u2026 Alec had a little problem with that\u2014he wanted to be a little broader, I was afraid he was commenting on the character, but I must tell you: he was right. We didn't really agree on set, but then he gave me a call [years later] \u2026 and said: \"Hey, I'm glad you made me do this and that.\" I said: \"I'm glad you did what you did, too.\" It was a little broader than I would've asked him to play it, but I really like what he did.<ref name=\"film\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film's release was delayed to try to take advantage of Baldwin's success in ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'', which had been released two months earlier, but failed to do so, with an opening weekend gross of $3 million from 832 screens to place fourth for the weekend, behind ''The Hunt for Red October''.<ref name=\"mojo\"/><ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title='Turtles,' 'Woman' still b.o. champs; 'Blues' dull $3-mil, 'Lisa' looks lax}}</ref> It went on to gross $9.9 million in the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"mojo\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 85% based on 26 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Laced with hard-boiled thrills and pitch-black comedy, ''Miami Blues'' delivers a disarmingly off-kilter crime caper.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Miami Blues |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/miami_blues |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2022-11-01}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], it has a score of 72 out of 100 based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Miami Blues |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/miami-blues |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=2021-09-11}}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"C\" on a scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= MIAMI BLUES (1990) C |work= [[CinemaScore]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"''Miami Blues'' is best appreciated for the performances of its stars and for the kinds of funny, scene-stealing peripheral touches that keep it lively even when it's less than fully convincing.\"<ref name=\"Maslin\">{{cite news |date=20 April 1990 |last=Maslin |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Maslin |title=Review/Film; Cop, Thief and Prostitute in Miami |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/20/movies/review-film-cop-thief-and-prostitute-in-miami.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021121222/https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/20/movies/review-film-cop-thief-and-prostitute-in-miami.html |archive-date=2009-10-21 |url-status=live |url-access=registration }}</ref> \n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it 2 out of 4 and wrote: \"They're looking for the right tone in ''Miami Blues'', and they don't find it very often, but when they do, you can see what they were looking for.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web |date=April 20, 1990 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Miami Blues |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/miami-blues-1990 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0100143|Miami Blues}}\n* {{AllMovie title|32409|Miami Blues}}\n* {{AFI film|id=67368|title=Miami Blues}}\n* {{Mojo title|miamiblues}}\n\n{{George Armitage}}\n\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s heist films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:American police detective films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by George Armitage]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Gary Goetzman]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Gary Chang]]\n[[Category:Films set in Miami]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
