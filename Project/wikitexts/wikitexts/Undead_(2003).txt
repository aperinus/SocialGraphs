A number of strange meteorites are seen falling nearby, turning the local inhabitants into zombies. Rene and other survivors hide in the home of gun nut and [[Alien abduction|alien abductee]] Marion ([[Mungo McKay]]). Marion has a large cache of guns and a basement [[fallout shelter]], but he never had a chance to stock it with food or water.\n\nThe group ventures outside to scavenge, but encounter the zombies. Marion shoots one in the head and discovers that such is the way to keep the creatures down. They abandon the house, going to the garage to get Marion's van. They try to flee, only to find a huge barrier surrounding the entire town, which Marion blames on the [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] that had taken him. There is also a slightly [[Acid rain|acidic rain]] that falls at very regular intervals and the group is careful not to get wet.\n\nLater, they are confronted by glowing, hooded figures. One by one, the group is either killed or pulled up into the clouds until only Rene is left. The aliens stop her and she is sprayed with the rain-like chemical, which turns out to be a cure for the infection. The aliens are actually there to keep the zombie infection from spreading. The \"abducted\" are floating in [[suspended animation]] above the clouds to keep them safe. Their job done, the aliens leave, unaware that Wayne (Rob Jenkins), presumed dead, managed to escape by plane and will spread the infection after they left.\n\nThe townspeople are rushed to the hospital to treat the injured. Unfortunately, Wayne transforms into a zombie, first infecting Marion and then spreading the plague once again.\n\nThe film ends at Rene's farm where the survivors are staying. The final shot is of the farm with a fenced-in area nearby, containing the zombified residents of Berkeley. Rene stands guard with a [[Multiple-barrel firearm|four-barreled]] shotgun and a gas mask, waiting for the return of the aliens.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Felicity Mason]] as Rene\n*[[Mungo McKay]] as Marion\n*Rob Jenkins as Wayne\n*Lisa Cunningham as Sallyanne\n*Dirk Hunter as Harrison\n*Emma Randall as Molly\n*Noel Sheridan as Chip\n*Gaynor Wensley as Aggie\n*Eleanor Stillman as Ruth\n*[[Robyn Moore (Australian actor)|Robyn Moore]] as Officer in Locker Room\n*[[Robert Jozinovi\u0107]] as Man in Office\n*[[Steven O'Donnell (actor, presenter)|Steven O'Donnell]] as Featured zombie\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=December 2011}}\nThe film was given a 32% rating on the [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which delivered the verdict \"This low-budget homage to the zombie genre borrows heavily from superior predecessors and revels in a pile of its own campiness -- neither original nor watchable enough to entertain.\"<ref>{{rottentomatoes|undead_2003|Undead}}</ref> Another aggregator [[Metacritic]] gave it a \"generally unfavorable\" 34 out of 100.<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=Undead}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] said that \"''Undead'' is the kind of movie that would be so bad it's good, except it's not bad enough to be good enough.\"<ref>{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050707/REVIEWS/50620004/1001 |title=Undead |work=rogerebert.com |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=8 July 2005 |access-date=14 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[David Stratton]] reviewed the film for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said it was a \"precociously inventive horror pic,\" although \"the film's threatened humans aren't a very likeable bunch and a grievously overlong running time reps a definite downer.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Stratton |author-link=David Stratton |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117921024/ |title=Variety Reviews - Undead |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=16 June 2003 |access-date=14 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIt was awarded the Fipresci Prize at the 2003 [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] for \"Daring to be everything that Australian films are not supposed to be: part of a popular, disreputable genre.
