Judith and Benjamin make ends meet by working at a women's retail clothing store. Benjamin spends his spare time writing [[science fiction]] stories, and he has recently completed a story called ''Yeast Lords,'' which centers on a hero named Bronco, modeled after his long-dead father.\n\nAt various times, portions of ''Yeast Lords'' are seen as Benjamin imagines them. Bronco is obliquely masculine, and he valiantly struggles with a villain over yeast production.\n\nAt a two-day writing camp for aspiring fantasy and science fiction authors, Benjamin attends lectures by his idol, the prolific and pretentious writer Ronald Chevalier. Chevalier announces a contest for the writers, in which the winner's story will be published nationally. After encouragement from fellow camper Tabatha, Benjamin submits ''Yeast Lords''. Tabatha shows the story to her friend Lonnie Donaho who runs an ultra low-budget video production company. Lonnie gives Benjamin a post-dated check for $500 and begins adapting ''Yeast Lords'' into a film.\n\nAs Chevalier reviews the stories from the campers, he gets a call from his publisher, rejecting his latest manuscript. Panicked, he picks up Benjamin's story, and it sparks his imagination. Chevalier changes Purvis' Bronco into Brutus, an extremely effeminate and comically flamboyant hero, changes the other character names and title, but otherwise leaves the story intact. His publisher loves it, and the novel is rushed into production under the title ''Brutus and Balzaak.''\n\nPortions of Chevalier's version are now seen playing out alongside Benjamin's original vision of the story.\n\nAt the local premiere of Donaho's version of ''Yeast Lords'', Benjamin is nauseated to see how badly Donaho has adapted his work, and he abruptly leaves the film with Tabatha. They go to a bookstore where he discovers Chevalier's plagiarism after reading a paragraph from ''Brutus and Balzaak''. He confronts Chevalier at a local book signing, and assaults him with some merchandise Chevalier had offered him in exchange for keeping his theft quiet. Two policeman hustle him out of the store and he is placed in jail.\n\nJudith comes to visit her son in jail to give him his birthday present. She hands him a box of manuscripts, all officially bound by the Writers Guild of America. She explains that she has been registering all his stories with them since he was seven years old, thinking they would make a nice keepsake for his children. ''Yeast Lords'' is one of the registered stories.\n\nCopies of Chevalier's novel are unceremoniously dumped from store shelves and replaced with Benjamin's original novel.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as Benjamin Purvis\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Dr. Ronald Chevalier\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Judith Purvis\n* [[Halley Feiffer]] as Tabatha Jenkins\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Jim\u00e9nez]] as Lonnie Donaho\n* [[Josh Pais]] as Todd Keefe\n* [[Mike White (scriptwriter)|Mike White]] as Dusty\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Bronco/Brutus\n* [[Suzanne May]] as Vanaya/Venonka\n* [[Edgar Oliver]] as Duncan/Lord Daysius\n* [[Clive Revill]] as Cletus\n\n==Production==\nIn December 2007, ''[[JoBlo.com]]'' reported that [[Jared and Jerusha Hess]] had signed with [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] to produce ''Gentlemen Broncos'', based on a [[spec script]] they had written.
