It was directed by [[Joe Dante]] and written by [[Charles S. Haas]], with creature designs by [[Rick Baker]]. [[Zach Galligan]], [[Phoebe Cates]], [[Dick Miller]], [[Jackie Joseph]], and [[Keye Luke]] reprise their roles from the first film. New cast members include [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]], [[Robert Prosky]], [[Haviland Morris]], [[Robert Picardo]], and [[Christopher Lee]]; additionally, the film features [[Tony Randall]] providing the voice for one of the gremlins. The story continues the adventures of the creature Gizmo (once again voiced by [[Howie Mandel]]), who spawns numerous small monsters when wet. In the first film, Gizmo's offspring rampaged through a small fictional town. In ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'', Gizmo multiplies within a skyscraper in [[New York City]] after his owner died. The new creatures thus pose a serious threat to the city should they be able to leave the building, and the story revolves around the human characters' efforts to prevent this disaster.\n\nLike the first film, ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' is a live-action horror comedy film; however, Dante put effort into taking the sequel in new [[anarchic comedy film|anarchistic]] directions. Dante created the film to act almost as a parody of the original ''[[Gremlins]]'',<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/gremlins-2-new-batch-30-anniversary-joe-dante-a9563586.html/ The unforgettable satire: How Gremlins 2 made a mockery of Hollywood sequels \u2013 Independent]</ref> and it is meant to be more cartoon-like and less dark than the original. Its violence leans more towards slapstick, so the film received a [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] rating by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA). There are also a number of parodies of other films and stories, including the ''[[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]]'' films, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. When released into theaters on June 15, 1990 ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' was a [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]], grossing only $41.5 million on a budget of $30\u201350 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter his owner Mr. Wing dies, the ''mogwai'' Gizmo becomes the guinea pig of scientists at a lab in the Clamp Center, a state-of-the-art highrise building in [[Manhattan]], owned by eccentric billionaire Daniel Clamp. At the mercy of the chief researcher Dr. Catheter, Gizmo is rescued by his former owner Billy Peltzer and his fianc\u00e9e Kate, both of whom work elsewhere in the building. Clamp befriends Billy upon being impressed by his skills in concept design, sparking the interest of Billy's superior Marla Bloodstone. Gizmo is left in the office, where water spills on his head from a broken [[drinking fountain]] and spawns four new ''mogwai'', one of them being Mohawk, a reincarnation of Stripe. They cage Gizmo in the air vents and later eat at the building's food court after midnight, becoming gremlins.\n\nAfter Gizmo escapes from the vent, Mohawk captures and tortures him. The other gremlins set off the [[fire sprinkler]]s and spawn a gremlin army that throws the building into chaos. Billy attempts to lure the gremlins into the lobby, where sunlight will kill them; after Billy briefs Clamp on gremlin knowledge, Clamp exits through a secret tunnel to cover the front of the building in a giant sheet to trick the creatures. The gremlins drink genetic serums in the lab; one becomes the intelligent Brain Gremlin, another gremlin becomes female, and a third becomes a being of pure electricity and kills Dr. Catheter before Billy traps it in the building's telephone system. All the while, television host \"Grandpa Fred\" films the chaos, aided by a Japanese tourist named Mr. Katsuji.\n\nMurray Futterman, Billy's neighbor from Kingston Falls who is visiting [[New York City]] with his wife Sheila, is attacked by a bat-gremlin [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] immunized to sunlight by the Brain Gremlin with \"genetic [[sunscreen|sunblock]]\". After fending it off, Murray realizes that he is not crazy and has to help; when Clamp escapes the building using his secret route, Murray uses it to sneak inside to aid Billy. Billy and chief of security Forster team up, but the enamored female gremlin chases Forster off. Mohawk drinks a spider serum and transforms into a monstrous gremlin-spider hybrid. He attacks Kate and Marla, but Gizmo saves them by killing Mohawk with an ignited bottle of [[Correction fluid|white-out]].\n\nBilly's plan to kill the gremlins by flooding the lobby with sunlight fails when rain clouds block the sun. He instead directs Murray to spray the gremlins with a fire hose, then releases the electric one from the telephone to electrocute and melt them all. Clamp charges in with the police and press, but sees the conflict is resolved; thrilled by the result, he promotes Billy, Kate, Fred, and Marla and hires Mr. Katsuji as a cameraman. Billy and Kate then return home with Gizmo. Forster calls Clamp to notify him that he is trapped at the highest floor of the building. The female gremlin, the sole survivor of the horde, corners him and entices him to marry her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Zach Galligan]] as Billy Peltzer\n* [[Phoebe Cates]] as Kate Beringer\n* [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] as Daniel Clamp\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as [[Grandpa (The Munsters)|Grandpa Fred]]\n* [[Robert Picardo]] as Forster, Chief of Security\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Dr. Cushing Catheter\n* [[Haviland Morris]] as Marla Bloodstone\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Murray Futterman\n* [[Jackie Joseph]] as Sheila Futterman\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as Mr. Katsuji, A Japanese Tourist\n* [[Keye Luke]] as Mr. Wing, Gizmo's Elderly Owner\n* [[Kathleen Freeman]] as Marge \"Microwave Marge\", Hostess of A Cooking Program.\n* Don and Dan Stanton as Martin and Lewis, Dr. Catheter's Assistants\n* [[Jason Presson]] as Alex, The Yogurt Jerk\n* [[Belinda Balaski]] as The Mother In The Movie Theater.

Jones had retired from animation before returning to work on ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch''.<ref name=\"Hinson\">{{cite news|first=Hal|last=Hinson|title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 15, 1990}}</ref> Dante explained the animation at the beginning of the film was meant to \"set the anarchic tone.\"<ref name=DVD>{{cite video |people=DVD commentary |date=2002 |title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch |publisher=Warner Home Video }}</ref>\n\nThe first scene initiates the film, and features the classic ''Looney Tunes'' opening card, causing people to assume it is the short cartoon that usually plays before a movie begins; however, when Bugs appears through the rings on top of the Warner Bros. shield, Daffy interrupts the intro, and steals the shield from Bugs. Daffy attempts to recreate the opening with himself in Bugs' place, but the shield overshoots, causing the entire title card to fall apart. Daffy surrenders the stardom, claiming that since he will not star in the cartoon, they might as well just skip straight to the movie. Bugs is willing to do so, and spins Daffy off screen like a spinning top for the movie title to appear.\n\nThe DVD and Blu-ray include a longer version of the cartoon short. In it, Daffy is informed by Bugs that he has been promoted to executive and is subsequently put in charge writing the title of the movie. When Daffy mistakenly writes the title ''Gremlins 2'' as \"Gremlin Stew\", Bugs corrects the error. Daffy then attempts to rename the film ''The Return of Super-Daffy Meets Gremlins 2 Part 6: The Movie'', but Bugs rejects this for being too long, changing it back to ''Gremlins 2'' (rendered in the font of the official logo). Daffy then quits his new job and Bugs decides to add in the subtitle, saying it looks \"a little skimpy\". This material was removed from the film because early audiences expected a live-action film and were bewildered by the lengthy animated sequence.\n\nThroughout the film's closing credits, Daffy pops into frame sporadically and spouts off sarcastic comments. The last scene appears after the credits, and again features the ''Looney Tunes'' rings. This time, Porky comes out of the rings and tries to say his usual \"Th-th-th-that's all, folks!\" However, Daffy interrupts again and takes over. After Daffy says the slogan, the back of the Warner Bros. shield, with the words, \"Title Animation Written & Directed by Chuck Jones (with Chuck Jones' signature)\", smashes him. He peeks his head out to the left side and says, \"Fade out,\" and the segment ends.<ref name=\"additional commentary\">{{cite video |people=DVD commentary, Additional Scenes|date=2002 |title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch |publisher=Warner Home Video }}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nThe original ''Gremlins'' was a financial success, and [[Warner Bros.]] asked its director Joe Dante to make a sequel straight away. Dante declined, because he saw ''Gremlins'' as having a proper ending, and thus a sequel would only be meant to be profitable. Moreover, the original film was a taxing experience for Dante, and he wanted to move on. Work on ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' continued without him, as the studio approached various directors and writers. Storylines considered included sending the gremlins to cities like [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] or even the planet Mars. After these ideas fell through, the studio returned to Dante, who agreed to make the sequel after receiving the rare promise of having complete creative control over the movie; he also received a budget triple that of the original film. Dante later acknowledged that by this point too much time had passed between the films, thus possibly reducing public interest in a ''Gremlins'' sequel.<ref name=\"special\">{{cite video |people=DVD commentary; Special edition|date=2002 |title= Steven Spielberg presents ''Gremlins.''|medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video }}</ref>\n\n''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' was shot in New York City in June 1989 and released in 1990. As the filmmakers noted, this was a time when cable television, genetics, and [[frozen yogurt]] were becoming more common in popular culture, hence are all parodied in the movie.<ref name=DVD/>\n\n=== Plotting ===\nWith more control over the film, Dante engineered a project that he later referred to as \"one of the more unconventional studio pictures, ever.\" Dante included some material that he believed Warner Bros. would not have allowed had they not wanted a sequel to ''Gremlins''. Allowed to break a number of rules in filmmaking, he also later claimed it was the film into which he had put the most of his personal influence. Dante imagined ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' as a satire of ''Gremlins'' and sequels in general.<ref name=DVD/>\n\nScreenwriter Charlie Haas introduced the concept of moving the gremlins to New York City and a corporate head (Daniel Clamp) as Billy's boss. When the Warner Bros. executives grew concerned about the expense of portraying the gremlins attacking an entire city, Haas came up with the idea of confining the action within Clamp's \"smart building\". Haas also included a great deal of material in his screenplay that proved too elaborate to produce, including having a cow\u2013hamster hybrid running on a treadmill in the laboratory.<ref name=DVD/>\n\nIn keeping with Dante's desires to satirize the original film, the sequel has some [[meta-reference]]s and [[self-referential humor]]. These include a cameo appearance by film critic [[Leonard Maltin]]. He holds up a copy of the original ''Gremlins'' home video and denounces it, just as he had in reality; however, his rant is cut short when gremlins pounce on him. Partly for this scene, one academic called Dante \"one of contemporary cinema's great pranksters.\"<ref name=\"Kelly\">{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Christopher|date=Summer 2000\n|title=Toys in the Attic: The Unsung Pleasures (And Terrors) of 'Babe: Pig in the City'|journal=[[Film Quarterly]]|volume=53|issue=4|page=44\n|doi=10.1525/fq.2000.53.4.04a00050}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, when Billy is trying to explain the rules regarding the mogwai to staff in the building, the staff finds them quite absurd and derisively interrogates Billy on their precise meaning; at one point considering the [[thought experiment]] of a mogwai in a plane which crosses a time zone. This scene originates from the fact that the filmmakers themselves saw the rules as irrational, and some questions in the scene were based upon those raised by fans of the original film.<ref name=DVD/>\n\nAt one point in the film, Dante attempted to involve his audience in the story by making it seem as if the gremlins had taken control of the theatre where ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' was showing. The filmstrip appears to be broken by the gremlins, who then engage in [[shadow play|shadow puppetry]] over a white screen before replacing the reel with the vintage nudie film ''Volleyball Holiday''. [[Hulk Hogan]] then makes a cameo appearance as an audience member and intimidates the gremlins into running the rest of ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch''. This joke was inspired by a similar stunt in [[William Castle]]'s film ''[[The Tingler]]'' (1959). The studio feared that people might leave the theatre if they thought the film had broken; Dante therefore secured the inclusion of the sequence by assembling some people for a preview of the film. When the scene was shown, the real-life audience found it enjoyable and stayed in the theatre. Dante later described this scene as one of the most widely enjoyed jokes in ''Gremlins 2''.\n\nWhen the film made its debut on home video, the filmmakers replaced the scene to make it seem as if the viewer's VCR had been broken by the gremlins. In this version, the gremlins do their shadow puppetry over [[white noise]] before changing the VCR's channels. Their antics stop at a broadcast of ''[[Chisum]]'', where [[John Wayne]] forces the gremlins into continuing the film, although voice impersonation was needed since Wayne had been dead since 1979; actor [[Chad Everett]] was recommended by Wayne's son [[Patrick Wayne]].<ref name=DVD/> Notably, a clip from ''[[Falling Hare]]'', a film released in 1943 featuring Bugs Bunny and a gremlin, appears in this version.  Also featured is a clip of the opening titles of the [[KTHV]] local newscast at the time in Little Rock, Arkansas. These sequences occur in lieu of the Hulk Hogan sequence which also featured [[Paul Bartel]]; home video audiences would not see these sequences until the DVD and Blu-ray releases (which includes the reworked VHS scene as a bonus feature).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=4734 |title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch |publisher=Movie-Censorship.com |date=May 11, 2010 |access-date=March 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe original version of the film was longer, but executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] claimed that there were too many gremlins, and several scenes were cut as a result. One deleted scene portrayed three of the main gremlins, Daffy, Lenny, and George, sneaking into television host Grandpa Fred's studio and \"helping\" him host, acting on the premise that Grandpa Fred's show was intended to be scary (though this scene was later included in the tie-in novel).<ref name=\"additional commentary\"/>\n\n=== Casting ===\nSeveral actors from the original film returned to make ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'', including Galligan, Cates, and Dick Miller. Miller reprised his role as Billy's neighbor Mr. Futterman, who the gremlins severely injured (both physically and mostly mentally) in the first film, in an expanded role in this film. In the second, he plays a part in wiping out the creatures by dousing one in cement and using the building's fire hose against the others. [[Character actor|Character actress]] Jackie Joseph returned to play Mr. Futterman's wife, and there were also brief reappearances in the movie theatre sequence from [[Belinda Balaski]] as a complaining mother and [[Kenneth Tobey]] as the projectionist. Keye Luke also returned to play Mr. Wing, Gizmo's original owner. When Luke heard his character would die in ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'', he quipped, \"Remember, when you make ''Gremlins 3'', I'm a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]!\". [[Hoyt Axton]] was meant to return as Billy's father, the inventor. He would have appeared at the end of the film, having designed special clothing for Gizmo that would ensure Gizmo would never come into contact with water again. At the last moment, the filmmakers decided not to shoot the scene to reduce time.<ref name=DVD/>\n\nNew performers included [[Robert Picardo]], who had previously worked with Dante and producer [[Michael Finnell]] in films such as ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]'' (1981) and ''[[Innerspace]]'' (1987). He plays Forster, one of Billy's crueler bosses. [[Robert Prosky]] played Grandpa Fred, a television host, and his character was based upon [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]]'s character [[the Munsters|Grandpa Munster]]. Joe Dante has a brief cameo as the director of Grandpa Fred's show. [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] played Clamp (character based upon [[Donald Trump]] and [[Ted Turner]]) and brought to the role an enthusiastic innocence that overrode the fact that his character had been written as a [[villain]], which Dante thought lightened the film in general.<ref name=DVD/>\n\nChristopher Lee (who previously worked with Spielberg in ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'') played the [[mad scientist]] Dr. Catheter. Lee imagined his role as light-hearted; but Dante encouraged him to portray the scientist as [[evil]] to better match the atmosphere of the laboratory set. Lee was revered on the set for his experience.<ref name=DVD/> In a deleted scene, Dr. Catheter examines a [[bat]] injected with \"genetic sun-block\". He then says to his colleague, \"I'm told they sometimes feed on blood\"; this is a reference to Lee's performances as [[Dracula|Count Dracula]] in the ''[[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Horror]]'' films.<ref name=\"additional commentary\"/> Later, as the Bat Gremlin is transforming, Dr. Catheter experiences [[Deja-vu]] (the audience hears [[Dracula]] music). The doctor's first name, Cushing, is a reference to Lee's frequent Hammer co-star, and best friend, [[Peter Cushing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schlock-value.com |title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch |last=Anderson |first=Thomas  |date=January 6, 2019 |website=Schlock Value |access-date=December 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]], movie critic for ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', had given a negative review to the first ''Gremlins'' film. While Dante was initially hurt by the review, he invited Maltin to film a cameo as the movie critic of a fictional Clamp Cable Network show, ''The Movie Police.'' Maltin gives a snide review for the video re-release of the first film along the lines of his original review before being assaulted by gremlins, pleading, \"I was just kidding! It's a ten! A ten!\"\n\n=== Special effects ===\n[[Image:Gremlins2bat.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Director [[Joe Dante]] (left) holds a cardboard \"Bat Gremlin\", with actor [[Dick Miller]] (arms raised). A [[stop motion]] model replaced the cardboard gremlin in post-production.]]\nFor [[special effect]]s, the original film relied on [[Chris Walas]], who moved on to pursue a directing career. Dante turned to [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winner [[Rick Baker]] to create the effects for ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch''. Baker was not interested, as he saw ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' as too much work for a project in which he would not be the creator but rather a successor to Walas. He was eventually persuaded to accept the job when it was suggested he could make the gremlins and mogwai more diverse.<ref name=DVD/>\n\nIn the first film, when Gizmo multiplied, his off-spring closely resembled himself, except for the leader, Stripe. Here, the four mogwai Gizmo produces each possess their own distinct personalities and physical features. Additionally, each mogwai has a name, although the names were used in the script and never spoken aloud in the film. Two of the mogwais were George, black without a stripe and a caricature of [[Edward G. Robinson]], and Lenny, buck-toothed, named for the principal characters in ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', whom they resemble in both appearance and demeanor. Daffy was named for his manic behaviour, and the leader, Mohawk, for his [[mohawk hairstyle]]. Based on the original film's character, Stripe, [[Frank Welker]] also voices Mohawk. While both the mogwai and gremlin versions of Stripe had fur stripes, Baker hit upon the idea of giving the Mohawk mogwai a fur stripe and giving the Mohawk gremlin something scalier. Gizmo was also redesigned; the puppet was generally larger and its design was simplified. Dante commented Gizmo may look less real in ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'', but the result was that Gizmo could convey more [[anthropomorphism|emotion]].<ref name=DVD/>\n\nLater on, when the mogwai metamorphose into gremlins and multiply, they further diversify by running amok in the bio-lab and ingesting various drugs. One turns into a sunlight-resistant hybrid with a bat, thus becoming the Bat Gremlin. Mohawk becomes part-[[spider]]. One becomes part-vegetable (Vegetable Gremlin, as Dante named it), and another consumes a drug and turns into a female gremlin, referred to in at least one script as the \"Girl Gremlin\" and in the official trading card series and other promotional materials as \"Lady Gremlina\" with shiny red lips and mascara. Yet another has acid thrown onto his face, quickly presenting a mask of [[the Phantom of the Opera]].<ref name=DVD/>\n\nAs with the first, [[puppetry]] was involved, and some of the puppets were mechanical. An actor holding a puppet would have to have wires strapped to him. ''Gremlins 2'' also includes more [[stop motion]] animation than the first film; the Bat Gremlin was portrayed through some stop motion animation. Film technology since the original had improved, and as a result the creatures can be seen walking more. Gizmo is able to dance, although this scene took the longest to make. Because there are more gremlins in ''Gremlins 2'' than the original, additional filming lasted five months. Many of the effects had to be completed after the actors had finished their work.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nFor the gremlins' voices, [[Howie Mandel]] returned as the voice of Gizmo, while [[Tony Randall]] provided the voice of the Brain Gremlin, [[Frank Welker]] provided the voice for Mohawk, Mark Dodson provided voices for George, Lenny, and Daffy, Joe Dante provided voices for the Beanie Gremlin and the Witch Gremlin, Nancy McConnor provided the voice for the Bat Gremlin, while Kirk Thatcher provided voices for most of the gremlins, alongside Welker.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Gremlins 2: The New Batch\n| type         = Film score\n| artist       = Jerry Goldsmith\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = August 31, 1990; June 22, 2015 (25th Anniversary Edition)\n| recorded     = 1990\n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = Soundtrack\n| length       = 39:25 (original); 76:27 (Expansion)\n| label        = \n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\nAs with the first film, the music in ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' was composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who also has a cameo in the film alongside his wife. The song \"I'm Ready\" by [[Fats Domino]] was put into the film after singer [[Billy Idol]] denied the filmmakers the right to use the song \"[[Dancing with Myself]]\", so Joe Dante had to find a song that fit the beat that Gizmo was dancing to.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Appelo |first1=Tim |title=Uncovering the secrets of ''Gremlins 2'' |url=https://ew.com/article/1990/07/13/uncovering-secrets-gremlins-2/ |access-date=12 March 2022 |work=EW.com |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=13 July 1990 |language=en}}</ref> In the latter half of the film, Gizmo, inspired by the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' films and tired of the abuse he has suffered at the hands of the gremlins, takes revenge on Mohawk.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of {{RT data|score}} based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}. The site's consensus states; \"''Gremlins 2'' trades the spiky thrills of its predecessor for looney satire, yielding a succession of sporadically clever gags that add some flavor to a recycled plot.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gremlins_2_the_new_batch|title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date={{RT data|access date}}}}{{RT data|edit}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]], who had approved of the first film, observed that ''Gremlins 2'' was meant to satirize sequels. Nevertheless, he felt it did not manage to differentiate itself from the original enough and was not as good. He went on to claim that the film lacks a well-constructed plot, and once the gremlins arrived the film simply becomes a \"series of gags.\" He thus gave the film two and a half stars, out of a possible four.<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gremlins-2-the-new-batch-1990 |title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch |first=Roger |last=Ebert |access-date=October 26, 2022 }}</ref> Hal Hinson of ''The Washington Post'' caught on to how the ''Looney Tunes'' animation is meant to imply \"anarchic wit,\" but nevertheless felt both the cartoon short and the film itself are failures. He saw the beginning as too slow and, like Ebert, thought the film is too similar to the first. Hinson did, however, approve of the characterization of the gremlins and their version of \"New York, New York.\" He also noted that turning the gremlins against Clamp resembles anti-corporate \"poetic justice.\"<ref name=\"Hinson\"/>\n\nIn contrast, while one reviewer for ''Films in Review'', like Ebert, argued the film resembles the original and abandons its plot when the gremlins arrive, he also felt the film's appeal could be found partly in its self-consciousness of these facts and its in-jokes and satire. He also complimented Cates as \"wholesomely bewitching,\" and Galligan as \"a suitably naive foil for the scaly fiends.\"<ref name=\"Grant\">{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Edmond|date=October 1990\n|title=Gremlins 2|journal=Films in Review|volume=41|issue=10|pages=485\u2013487}}</ref>\nDesson Howe of ''The Washington Post'' also approved of the film, including its special effects and the parodies of Trump, Turner, genetics labs, cable television, and the film ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]''.<ref name=\"howe\">{{cite news|first=Desson|last=Howe|title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 15, 1990}}</ref>\nSome critics thought the film has qualities the original lacked, such as wit.

Glover and Picardo were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actor award.\n\nStill, the film did not perform as well at the box office as the original. ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch'' was released into US theatres on June 15, 1990, the same day as ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. In its first weekend it made $9,702,804, and it ultimately made $41,482,207.<ref name=\"mojo1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3109520897/weekend/|title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]\n|access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> It was thus only the thirty-first highest-grossing film of the year, behind a few other films in the comedy, horror or fantasy genre, such as ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' ($87,727,583), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' ($56,362,352), and ''[[Arachnophobia (film)|Arachnophobia]]'' ($53,208,180).

This may have been integral to the film's purpose. As one critic wrote, \"it's a savvy, off-the-wall comedy that acknowledges, yes, it is just one more silly rip-off sequel, produced to sell off the merchandise inspired by the first film.\"<ref name=\"Grant\"/> One reference the film makes to the original, an allusion to the merchandising surrounding Gizmo, drew criticism. Some critics saw the mention of merchandise as tasteless. This type of product placement has since become more common.<ref name=DVD/>\n\nThe new merchandise released alongside the film included PVC figures, plush, and other collectibles by the now-defunct Applause company in 1990. Much later, action figures by the [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]] (NECA Toys) based on characters such as the Brain and Mohawk gremlins were released. NECA also planned to release mogwais and gremlins from the film in late 2011 and 2012; with mogwai and gremlin versions of Daffy, Lenny and George, as well as a mogwai version of Mohawk. The Electric gremlin, flasher gremlin and the Phantom of the Opera gremlin were also planned to be released in action figure form by NECA. There were also newer versions of Gizmo released, including his Rambo look. Greta, a newer version of Mohawk and Mohawk in Spider form were also being planned.\n\nThere were also children's books like ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Movie Storybook'', by Michael Teitelbaum, published by Goldencraft in December 1990. [[Little Golden Books]] published ''Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Gizmo to the Rescue'' in July 1990.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000A1R4P Gremlins 12\" Roto-Cast Brain Action Figure by NECA], ''[[Amazon.com]]'', URL accessed May 22, 2006; [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030765950X Gremlins 2: The New Batch: Movie Storybook (Hardcover) by Michael Teitelbaum], ''Amazon.com'', URL accessed May 22, 2006; [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307125912 Gizmo To Rescue Look-Look Book (Gremlins 2 : the New Batch) (Paperback) by Jim Razzi, Gene Biggs, Kim Ellis (Illustrator)] ''Amazon.com'', URL accessed May 22, 2006.</ref> In the United Kingdom, [[William Heinemann Ltd.]] had published two tie-in picture books from Buzz Books in August 1990 which contains photographs and scenes taken from the film. They were titled ''Don't Get Wet'' and ''Midnight Feast''. Buzz Books had also released other picture books that are particularly suitable for children such as ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends]]'', ''[[Fireman Sam]]'', ''[[List of Tugs books|TUGS]]'', ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Animals of Farthing Wood (TV series)|The Animals of Farthing Wood]]'', ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny]]'', ''[[Joshua Jones (TV series)|Joshua Jones]]'' and ''[[Rupert Bear|Rupert]]''. [[David Bischoff]] wrote a novel based on the film published by [[Avon Books]] in June 1990. A unique aspect of the novel is how Bischoff adapts the sequence where the film breaks. In the novel, the Brain Gremlin subdues and locks Bischoff in his bathroom before taking the reins for a little bit to explain that the gremlins take over at this point in the film, his displeasure at Bischoff using the nickname \"Mr. Glasses\" instead of his official name, and begins a treatise on politics before Bischoff breaks his way out of the bathroom with an axe and subdues the Brain Gremlin. The novel then continues where the film picked up after the film break.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://shop.fangoria.com/new/nightmare-anniversary-gremlins-2-the-new-batch-of-merchandise |title=Gremlins 2: The New Batch \u2013 MobyGames |access-date=May 23, 2006 |author=Fangoria |author-link=Fangoria |work=Gremlins 2\" & The New Batch of Merchandise |publisher=Fangoria |page=1 |quote=Gremlins 2: The New Batch...
