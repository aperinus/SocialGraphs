The film also stars [[Maria Yi]], [[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]], [[Tony Liu]], and [[Nora Miao]].

It was the highest-grossing [[Hong Kong film]] up until Lee's next film, ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972).\n\n==Plot==\nCheng Chao-an is a Chinese man who moves to [[Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]], to live with his adopted family and to work in an ice factory. He meets his cousin Hsu Chie and Hsu's younger brother by accident when Hsu stands up to local street thugs who steal dumplings from his brother. Cheng refrains from getting involved despite being tempted to, as he swore to his mother to never participate in any fighting and wears a [[jade]] [[amulet]] around his neck as a reassurance of his pledge.\n\nCheng begins his work at the ice factory. When an ice block is accidentally broken, a bag of white powdery drugs falls out. Two of Cheng's cousins pick up the bag and are told to see the manager later that night. The factory is actually a front for a [[drug smuggling]] ring led by Hsiao Mi (a.k.a. the Big Boss). When Cheng's cousins refuse to join them, the manager sends his thugs to kill them and dispose of their bodies, thereby preserving the secret.\n\nHsu Chien and Ah Pei, another one of Cheng's cousins, go to Hsiao Mi's Mansion to find out what happened to the two cousins. Hsu doubts Hsiao's claims that he doesn't know anything and threatens to go to the authorities. Hsiao sets his gang on the duo as a result, and after a brutal battle, they are both killed as well and their bodies hidden. When the Chinese workers at the ice factory learn that Hsu is missing as well, they refuse to work, and start a riot against the Thai management, who are joined by a group of hired thugs.\n\nDuring the chaos, one of the thugs accidentally rips off and breaks Cheng's amulet. Enraged, Cheng jumps into the brawl and beats some of the thugs, causing them to flee. To reduce tensions, the ice factory manager makes Cheng a [[shop foreman|foreman]], inviting him to a dinner that night. This later causes much unease for Cheng's family and friends, who believe that Cheng is growing arrogant and spending more time reveling in his new position than helping to look for their brothers. They grow to resent him, all except Chiao Mei, his sister, who stands up for him.\n\nCheng gets drunk at the [[Formal dinner|dinner party]] and is seduced by Sun Wu Man, a prostitute who attended the dinner. She later warns Cheng that his life is in danger and reveals that Hsiao Mi is running a drug trafficking operation. Immediately after Cheng leaves, Hsiao's son, Hsiao Chiun, sneaks in and kills Sun by throwing a knife at her heart from behind. Cheng breaks into the factory and first finds the drugs before discovering a hand, the head of Sun, and the head of Hsu Chien in the ice blocks.\n\nCheng is surrounded by Hsiao Chiun and a group of his men. Cheng fights his way out, killing Hsiao Chiun and his gang in the process. He returns home to find that his remaining family members have been murdered, while Chiao Mei is missing. Mourning his loss by a river, he vows to exact his revenge at all costs, even if he dies. To this end, Cheng returns to the town brothel and makes love to another Thai prostitute. Learning of the Boss' location, Cheng leaves the prostitute with a sizable sum of money and departs, despite her attempts in talking him out of revenge.\n\nCheng subsequently storms Hsiao Mi's mansion to fight him and his men. One of Hsiao Mi's disgruntled slaves frees Chiao Mei, who was being held hostage by Hsiao Mi in a cramped room used as a [[prison cell]]. Chiao Mei runs away to get help from the Thai police. Cheng finally kills Hsiao Mi after a fierce fight, by deflecting the knife Mi throws at him with his shoe. Once he knows that Chiao Mei is safe (as she came running along with the police division), he surrenders to the police when they arrive at the mansion, and is arrested where the crowd walks back to the [[police vehicle]] to leave the mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bruce Lee]] as Cheng Chao-an ({{zh|first=t|t=\u912d\u6f6e\u5b89|cy=Zeng Ciu-On}}), a young man who, along with his uncle, travels from [[Guangdong]], [[China]] to [[Pak Chong District|Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]] to stay with his cousins.

In 1970, he was incapacitated for several months after damaging a sacral nerve in his lower back while weightlifting.<ref name=story>{{cite book| title= The Bruce Lee Story |first1= Linda |last1= Lee | first2= Tom |last2= Bleecker| publisher= Ohara Publications, Inc.| year= 1989 }}</ref> Money became tight as roles in Hollywood proved hard to come by, and wife Linda had to work evenings at an answering service to help pay the bills. Bruce was still keen to develop film and TV projects in Hollywood, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to accept a TV script project he had developed (the plotline of which was similar to, but not the same as, ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''), and production on ''[[Circle of Iron|The Silent Flute]]'' had to be suspended indefinitely after a three-week trip to India with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] to scout locations for the movie proved unproductive. In light of these recent events, Coburn suggested to Bruce that he try his luck in the increasingly growing Hong Kong film industry.\"<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew |first= Linda |last= Lee| year= 1975| publisher= Warner Paperback Library}}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1970, Bruce paid a visit to Hong Kong with his young son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]]. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had become famous there due to reruns of ''The Green Hornet'' on TV, and the enthusiastic reception he received took him by surprise. He was invited to appear on popular [[TVB|HKTVB]] chat show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'', where he was interviewed and gave a board-breaking demonstration.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nEncouraged by the interest in Hong Kong, Bruce asked his childhood friend [[Unicorn Chan]] to pass on his [[curriculum vitae|CV]] to [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], Hong Kong's largest film production company. They offered Bruce a long-term contract but only US$2,000 per film, which Bruce declined. Another offer appeared unexpectedly from [[Raymond Chow]], a film producer who had in 1970 left Shaw Brothers to form a new company, Golden Harvest.<ref name=OnlyI /> Chow, aware of the rejected offer from Shaw Brothers, had been impressed by Bruce's interviews on Hong Kong television and radio, and also by his confidence during a long-distance phone call. During that phone call, Lee determined the best action movie playing in Hong Kong and assured Chow that he could do much better.<ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web| title=''Bruce Lee the Legend'' |format=1983 Documentary film|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=TIsInQYekSU |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/TIsInQYekSU |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live| via= YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1971, Chow sent one of his producers Liu Liang-Hua (the wife of director Lo Wei) to Los Angeles to meet and negotiate with Bruce, who signed a contract to make two films for Golden Harvest for US$15,000 ($10,000 for ''The Big Boss'' and $5,000 on completion of a second film tentatively titled ''King of Chinese Boxers'' and which became ''[[Fist of Fury]]''). This eased the Lees' financial worries and permitted Linda Lee to quit her job.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nWith the contract signed, Chow hastily arranged a meeting with his Golden Harvest executives and an old friend called Ma Thien-Ek (Fatty Ma), a Thai businessman, film distributor and cinema owner. They knew that Shaw Brothers were making a [[Muay Thai]] boxing film in Thailand (''[[Duel of Fists]]''), and wanted to make their new film there, which would also help to keep costs down. Fatty Ma, an expert in Thai affairs, offered to help with locations and expenses.<ref name=mandarin>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Mandarin Superstar |first1= Steve |last1= Kerridge | first2= Darren |last2= Chua| publisher= On The Fly Productions Ltd| year= 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nVeteran Chinese novelist and screenwriter [[Ni Kuang]] was commissioned to create a script based loosely on Cheng Chi-Yong, a prominent Chinese figure in Thai society in the early 20th century. Ni Kuang changed the name of the character to Cheng Chao-an, after Chao'an county in eastern China, the home of Cheng Chi-Yong's ancestors. He also developed the idea of Cheng being sent by his mother to live and work with fellow Chinese migrants in Thailand, after his father had been killed in a fight. She gave her son a jade necklace symbolising peace, protection and good fortune, as a reminder to avoid trouble.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nIt was not unusual in Hong Kong cinema for the director to amend the script during filming, and The Big Boss was no exception. When Lo Wei replaced the original director in late July 1971, he was unhappy with the script and re-wrote it, without Bruce's knowledge. Lo later recalled, \"I wouldn't tell him I was re-writing the script for fear of affecting his morale. In my hotel room, he would often discuss the script with me which would leave me tongue-tied, so I would tell him I needed to rest, and as soon as he left I would be burning the midnight oil in order to get the script ready for the next day's filming.\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\n===Filming===\nBruce Lee flew from Los Angeles to [[Bangkok]] via Hong Kong on 12 July 1971. Raymond Chow, concerned about renewed interest from Shaw Brothers, had wanted him to fly directly to Bangkok, but Bruce refused, stopping in Hong Kong briefly to greet a friend and make a few phone calls.<ref name=story /> Bruce stayed in Bangkok for five nights, and it was here that he met most of the cast and crew and also Raymond Chow for the first time.<ref name=mandarin /> Filming commenced on 22 July in Pak Chong, a small town situated some 90 miles (150&nbsp;km) northeast of Bangkok, on the northern edge of the [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand's oldest reserve; it also serves as the gateway to the northeast ([[Isan]]) of Thailand from the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. Pak Chong would be Bruce's home for about four weeks, and he made no secret of his dislike for it in letters to wife Linda, describing it as a lawless, impoverished and undeveloped village. Due to the lack of fresh food, Bruce was losing weight due to a lack of proper diet, having to eat canned meat and supplement his diet with vitamins, which he had thankfully brought along. He occasionally lost his voice through trying to shout above the noise on set; mosquitoes and cockroaches were everywhere, and the tap water in the hotel was yellow.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /><ref name=Letters>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Letters of the Dragon |first= John |last= Little| year= 1998| publisher= Tuttle Publishing}}</ref> Bruce asked the hotel staff to put his mattress on the floor, as sleeping on the bed was uncomfortable due to his ongoing back problem.<ref name=mandarin /> He also needed lots of rest after a fight scene.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nWhen Bruce arrived in Pak Chong, rival film companies tried desperately to poach him away from Golden Harvest, including Shaw Brothers, with a new and improved offer. A film producer from Taiwan told Bruce to rip up his contract and promised to take care of any lawsuit. Bruce, a man of his word, had no intention of considering the offers, although it did add some extra tension on the film set.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI />\n\nShooting did not go smoothly at first. After just a few days, the \"uncertain\" original director, Wu Chia Hsiang, was replaced by Lo Wei (the husband of associate producer Liu Liang-Hua).<ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce was initially sceptical of Lo, describing him in letters to Linda as a \"fame lover\" and \"another so-so one with an almost unbearable air of superiority\".<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce badly cut his right hand while washing a thin glass, the wound requiring ten stitches<ref name=OnlyI /><ref name=Letters /> and a large plaster, which is very noticeable throughout the movie, especially the scenes filmed at the Thamrongthai ice factory, the first filming location used in Pak Chong. Fatty Ma had a contact who knew the owner of the factory, and arranged for Golden Harvest to film there for a few days.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nOne night, filming of the big fight in the ice house had to be stopped for an hour as Bruce had lost a contact lens, and dozens of people were on their hands and knees looking for it amongst thousands of ice chips. Eventually Bruce found it himself, leading Lo Wei to wonder if he had it in his pocket all along, and was deliberately being disruptive.<ref name=Biography>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: The Biography |first= Robert |last= Clouse| year= 1988| publisher= Unique Publications}}</ref>\n\nAside from the factory, other locations in Pak Chong used for filming include the Lam Ta Khong river (a tributary of the [[Mun River]]), and a local brothel (the Mitsumphun Hotel), which has since burnt down. The actual bedroom scenes however were filmed in a riverside bungalow owned by the nearby New Wan Chai Hotel (now the Rimtarninn), where the film crew stayed during filming, due to the bedrooms in the brothel being smelly and unhygienic. The prostitutes charged only fifteen Baht in Thai money per client, but the film crew paid them one to two hundred Baht each to appear as extras in the film.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nPerhaps the most iconic location seen in the film is the titular big boss's mansion<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/14%C2%B041'43.2%22N+101%C2%B024'20.5%22E/@14.6953245,101.4046127,446m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x311c29f4205485af:0x15be7cfc7ed1acb0!2sPak+Chong+Village,+Pak+Chong,+Pak+Chong+District,+Nakhon+Ratchasima+30130,+Thailand!3b1!8m2!3d14.729553!4d101.438016!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d14.695322!4d101.4056836?hl=en Geo coordinates]</ref> and gardens, which was a Buddhist temple situated on the main road called Wat Siri Samphan, built in 1963.<ref name=mandarin /> Like the ice factory, it is still in Pak Chong today and remains largely unchanged, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who have made the pilgrimage to Thailand to view the filming locations.<ref name=Pursuit>''In Pursuit of the Dragon'' (2012 documentary) by John Little.</ref>\n\nThere has been some speculation that Bruce was involved in a real fight on the set of The Big Boss, as depicted in the 1993 biopic ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Although no such fight actually took place, Bruce did interact extensively with a few of the Thai stuntmen (one of whom was a former [[Muay Thai]] bantamweight champion), and exchanged info and skills with them between takes. Bruce reportedly though seemed unimpressed and called their kicks \"telegraphed\", while the Hong Kong stunt team (Lam Ching-Ying, Billy Chan and his brother Peter Chan Lung) were initially unimpressed with Bruce, and doubted his abilities. Their opinion of him soon changed when Lam challenged Bruce in the hotel, and Bruce sidekicked him across the room.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAfter an eventful and at times chaotic first few days' filming in Pak Chong, by early August 1971 the filming had picked up speed, and was progressing well. Bruce and Lo Wei were collaborating, but they still clashed over a few of the scenes, in particular the use of trampolines and mattresses to propel people through the air, and also the scene where Bruce punches a man through a wooden wall, leaving a cartoonish outline in the wood.<ref name=JKDClub>''Bruce Lee in The Big Boss'' published by Bruce Lee JKD Club (1980)</ref> Bruce was also hesitant to go along with Lo Wei's ideas of filming risqu\u00e9 scenes of his character getting in bed with Thai ladies portraying prostitutes, although he eventually agreed to do them as Lo insisted it would add to his character's newfound image as a revenge-driven warrior.\n\nThe final scene filmed in Pak Chong was the climactic fight between Bruce and the boss (played by Han Ying Chieh, who also served as the fight choreographer), which proved to be problematic: Bruce endured \"two days of hell\" when he sprained his ankle from a high jump on a slipped mattress, and had to be driven to Bangkok to see a doctor, where he caught a virus in the hot and stuffy conditions. Close-ups were used to finish the fight, as Bruce struggled and had to drag his leg, which was covered up with, and contributed to, his character's worn out, exhausted appearance.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /><ref name=Letters />\n\nThe cast and crew spent the last twelve days in August filming further scenes in Bangkok, where Bruce enjoyed breakfast in bed at the Thai Hotel, a luxury he never had in Pak Chong.<ref name=story /><ref name=OnlyI /> The dinner party scene was filmed in the back room of the Poonsin Chinese Restaurant, close to the Thai Hotel.<ref name=mandarin /> A few scenes were filmed at the [[Chao Phraya River]] in [[Phra Pradaeng District]], including the opening scene in the film where Bruce and his uncle step off the ferry boat and walk through the busy pier. An old teak house in the east side of Phra Pradaeng district was used as the family home, while Nora Miao's scenes (and part of the opening fight sequence) were filmed on the quieter west side, which resembled rural Pak Chong.<ref name=mandarin /> At times filming was delayed by heavy rain.<ref name=Letters />\n\n''The Big Boss'' film crew returned to Hong Kong on 3 September, where there would be a further day of filming for insert shots including close-ups of Bruce avoiding the dogs and the \"leg-grappling\" scene during the fight with the boss (these were filmed at the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club).<ref name=mandarin /> The final scene filmed was the now deleted \"pushcart attack\" in the alleyway, at Wader Studio in Hong Kong, as Golden Harvest had not as yet moved into their famous studios on Hammer Hill Road.<ref name=mandarin />\n\n===Post-production===\nBruce viewed over three hours of unedited footage on 5 September, and was pleased with the results.<ref name=JKDClub /> The next day, he flew to the US to see his family and film further episodes of [[Longstreet (TV series)|''Longstreet'']]. While Bruce was in the US, the footage was sent for processing and editing. The editing was initially done by Golden Harvest editor Sung Ming, but because they were behind schedule, the renowned award-winning editor Chiang Hsing-Lung was also brought in to help. A veteran of over 170 movies, Chiang worked very quickly, and helped deliver the film on time. Since he was employed by Shaw Bros at the time, his involvement was kept secret, and he was uncredited.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nBruce returned to Hong Kong on 16 October with his family plus friend Robert Baker. They were greeted at [[Kai Tak Airport]] by several friends, news reporters and a large group of scouts from the Scout Association of Hong Kong. The next day, a private screening was held at Golden Harvest for cinema owners. Sung Ming then made further edits to appease the Hong Kong censors, for the film's general release at the end of October. On 22 October, Bruce and Robert Baker appeared on ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'' to promote the film.<ref name=mandarin />\n\n===Bruce Lee and JKD short film===\nWhile in Thailand, Bruce wrote to Linda regularly, telling her he missed her and the children, and was looking forward to seeing them in Hong Kong once filming had been completed. In return for their air fare (from their home in Los Angeles to Hong Kong), Golden Harvest wanted Bruce to make a short film for them called ''Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do'', which would run for approximately 15 minutes and be narrated by actress Nora Miao. According to Hong Kong press reports, Golden Harvest had originally planned for the short film to accompany the release of another upcoming film of theirs called ''The Hurricane'' (a.k.a. ''Gold Cyclone Whirlwind''), starring Nora and written and directed by Lo Wei. This would promote Nora and introduce Lee's skills to the Hong Kong public prior to the release of ''The Big Boss''. Nora, who was already in Thailand on vacation, joined the film crew in Bangkok in late August 1971, but the short film was not made, presumably because there was not enough time; she did however film a few brief scenes for ''The Big Boss'' in a cameo role as a roadside refreshment vendor.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nOn 23 October 1971, the film premiered at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong's Central district for a now legendary midnight screening.<ref name=mandarin /> Linda recalled in her 1975 book ''Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew'': \"Every dream that Bruce had ever possessed came true that night. The audience rose to its feet, yelling, clapping, cheering. It was almost impossible to leave the theatre; we were absolutely mobbed.\"<ref name=OnlyI /> The Lees also attended the official gala premiere on 3 November, which was a charity screening for the Scout Association of Hong Kong.

The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an's fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, would have given the film an \"[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|X]]\" rating. The first time this scene was shown in the US was when it played on cable channel [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] in July 2004.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film as a re-issue in 1978 and again re-issued it with ''Fist of Fury'' as a studio sanctioned double feature in February 1981. [[Miramax]] distributed ''The Big Boss'' on television & streaming (Hulu & Netflix) along with ''Bruce Lee, the Legend'' (1984), ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 300,000 viewers on [[Channel 5 (British TV channel)|Channel 5]] in 2008, making it the year's most-watched foreign-language film on Channel 5.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2009 |title=Statistical Yearbook 09 |pages=95 |publisher=[[UK Film Council]] |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/uk-film-council-statistical-yearbook-2009.pdf |access-date=21 April 2022 |via=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref>\n\nOn July 14, 2020, The Criterion Collection released a Blu-ray box set featuring ''The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, The Way of the Dragon, Enter the Dragon, Game of Death,'' and ''Game of Death II'' titled ''Bruce Lee: His Greatest Hits.''\n\n===Critical reception===\n''The Big Boss'' received mixed reviews from critics upon release. From the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' during the film's original Hong Kong run: \"This is probably the biggest thing to hit the Mandarin film business since the invention of fake blood ... Every cinema showing this film is packed to the fire exits.\"<ref name=Southchina>''South China Morning Post''. 7 November 1971.</ref> In a positive review for Singapore newspaper ''[[The Straits Times]]'', Arthur Richards wrote, \"It is a delightful study of [[Chinese martial arts]] mixed with [[karate]] and lightning kicks, Western-style ... An acceptable thriller of the James Bond calibre.\"<ref name=Straits>Richards, Arthur (5 December 1971). \"Fistful of thrills of the 007 calibre\". ''The Straits Times''.</ref>\nConversely, a negative review by Edgar Koh had appeared in another Singapore newspaper, New Nation, a few days earlier: \"Bruce Lee is certainly skilled in his job, not as an actor but as an exponent of his particular brand of fighting with fists and legs ... There are the stereotype good and bad, and the by now redundant theme of revenge. On top of this, it doesn't flow smoothly; the emotional mood, shallow though it is, is sometimes left out on a limb.\"<ref name=Nation>Koh, Edgar (2 December 1971). \"Skilful pugilism but it's repugnant cinema\". ''New Nation''.</ref>\n\nReviews were also mixed when the film was released (as ''Fists of Fury'') in the US in spring 1973. J. Oliver Prescott of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' wrote, \"Bruce Lee is the fastest foot in the East ... Now back in Hong Kong, he has become the hottest international movie star since [[Clint Eastwood]]. Unlike Eastwood\u2019s anti-hero, Bruce Lee is giving the American audiences what they apparently want now: a hero. Lee is Rex Allen, Lash Larue, Tom Mix, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry all rolled into one ... The characters are certainly simple: these are just plain Chinese country folk whose little disagreements develop overnight into Oriental rumbles equivalent to the Sharks and Jets in [[West Side Story]].\"<ref name=Tampa>Prescott, J. Oliver (12 June 1973). ''Tampa Bay Times''.</ref>\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"[[Kung fu movies]] began as a local phenomenon in Hong Kong a couple of years ago. The two I\u2019ve just seen, ''Fists of Fury'' (a.k.a. ''The Big Boss'') and ''Deep Thrust'' (a.k.a. ''[[Lady Whirlwind]]''), make the worst [[Spaghetti Western|Italian Westerns]] look like the most solemn and noble achievements of the early Soviet cinema.\"<ref name=NYT>Canby, Vincent (13 May 1973). ''The New York Times''.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated, \"Despite the silly plot, dreadful supporting cast and prim morality (or perhaps because of them), ''Fists of Fury'' is sometimes entertaining, with most of the credit due to Lee.\"<ref name=Variety>Variety.</ref>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a score of 69% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Big Boss (Tang shan da xiong) (1972) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_boss_1972 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=6 June 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Alternative versions==\n===Censorship and missing scenes===\n''The Big Boss'' has quite a long and complicated history of censorship and editing, with many scenes being trimmed or removed completely for various reasons, for different markets. The notorious \"handsaw in the split head\" shot was cut by the censors in Hong Kong shortly before the film was released there in October 1971. It was only shown in a private screening at Golden Harvest for the press, cinema owners and prospective buyers on 17 October,<ref name=mandarin /> but has not been seen since; all that survives are a few stills.\n\nFurther scenes were cut for the first overseas prints released in some territories in late 1971 and early 1972. The nudity and bloodshed was toned down, along with a few seemingly innocuous scenes, including the final one filmed (in a studio in Hong Kong), where Cheng Chao-An (Bruce Lee) and Hsu Chien (James Tien) are walking home after the fight near the gambling den; they enter a narrow alleyway and have to grab hands and leap onto a wall to avoid a cart which is hurled towards them. The only logical explanation for the cutting of this scene was that it was done to increase the pacing of the early part of the film, which placed more emphasis on James Tien than on Bruce Lee.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\">{{cite web|title=The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart|url=http://bruceleelives.co.uk/missingboss.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 August 2016|title=Original mandarin cut|date=21 August 2016|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was a reduction to the gruesome sequence in which the body of cousin Ah Wong is cut apart by the electric saw, and body parts are placed into the ice container.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nA small edit was made to the dinner party scene, where a drunken Cheng approaches the prostitute Wu Man (played by Malarin Boonak), and imagines her topless.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nThe scene where Cheng is sitting by the riverside following his discovery of the bodies at the family home, was shortened. When he stands and throws his bundle of belongings into the river, there were then shots of his murdered friends, followed by him angrily shaking his fist and shouting, \"Revenge!\"<ref name=mandarin/>\n\nThe next cut is another entirely deleted scene, and another popular one alongside of the \"saw-in-the-head\" scene. After Cheng runs down the road from the creek, rather than cutting to him arriving at the Big Boss's mansion like the mainstream cuts, he returns to the Thai brothel for a third time. Here, he picks up the prostitute in a red sweater-type dress (seen in the background the second time Cheng visits the brothel). Cheng and the prostitute go to her room; Cheng pushes her onto the bed, and the two begin to strip. Cheng stands behind the bed, completely nude, but also completely emotionless. The woman lies on the bed and Cheng walks (waist-high shot) towards the camera, blurring out the scene. Next, Cheng is shown putting on his shirt, while the woman remains in bed. He lays his remaining money on her stomach, even though he already paid to be with her. He then picks up a bag of crisps from the bedside table; he tries one, then leaves. This scene is symbolic and quite important, as in the previous scene Cheng discards his belongings in the river, and here he gives away his money and enjoys his final pleasures and one last meal before either being killed or arrested, a message which is now partially lost. A few seconds of this scene (including a shot of an apparently naked Bruce standing behind the bed) can be seen in the original trailer.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nOther missing scenes briefly visible in the same trailer show Hsu Chien re-enacting a fight for his co-workers in the family home; Cheng walking towards the Drinkstand Girl's (Nora Miao) roadside refreshment stall (the camera zooms in to show her smiling at him); a different head visible in the block of ice when Cheng is investigating the ice house; blood pouring from Hsu Chien's head after being stabbed by the boss's son. It is not known if these four scenes were in any print of the film.\n\nFurther quick shots of violence \u2013 mostly involving weapons such as iron chains, sticks, knives and an ice pick \u2013 were cut from the prints in the UK and a few other European countries. These cuts were inexplicably maintained for the \"pan and scan\" videos released in the 1980s and 1990s but waived for the UK DVD release by Hong Kong Legends in late 2000. Also restored, surprisingly, was the bloodier death scene of the big boss. However, the material cut in 1971 in Hong Kong has never been restored, and remains missing. It was last seen in December 1979 at a Bruce Lee film festival in Kilburn, London, organised by Kung-Fu Monthly poster magazine. The Mandarin print screened for over 1,700 fans came from Golden Harvest's London office, and was complete with the exception of the censored \"saw in the head\" shot.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nAn early Mandarin print containing some extra footage is rumoured to still exist, and is thought to be in the hands of a private collector. A DVD was to be released in 2004 called \"The Big Boss\": \"The Version You've Never Seen\" but release was cancelled due to copyright issues.\n\n===Alternative title confusion===\n{{See also|Fist of Fury#Title}}\nWhen ''The Big Boss'' was being prepared for American distribution, the U.S. release was to be re-titled ''The Chinese Connection'', a play on the popular ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', since both dealt with drug trafficking. The U.S. title of Lee's second film, ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural ''Fists''. However, the titles were accidentally reversed. ''The Big Boss'' was released as ''Fists of Fury'' and ''Fist of Fury'' became ''The Chinese Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate title confusion \u2013 The Big Boss (1972) \u2013 Chinese Kungfu Kaleidoscope|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|publisher=Cultural China|access-date=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|archive-date=21 August 2016}}</ref> Recent American TV showings and the official US DVD release from [[20th Century Fox]] have restored the original titles of all Bruce Lee films, though the descriptions do not match in some cases.\n\n===Alternative music scores===\nUnlike other Lee films, ''The Big Boss'' is unique in having not only two, but three completely different music scores. ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Game of Death]]'' all only feature one score with minor alterations.\n\nThe first music score for it was composed by Wang Fu-ling, who worked on films such as ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' and ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]''. This was made for the original Mandarin language version, and was also used in the English export version, in addition to the theatrical French and Turkish versions. Wang was the only one to receive credit, but it is also believed composer Chen Yung-yu assisted with the score. At least one cue from Japanese composer [[Akira Ifukube]]'s scores for the ''[[Daimajin]]'' trilogy of films was also utilised as stock music.\n\nThe second and most widespread of the music scores was by German composer [[Peter Thomas (composer)|Peter Thomas]]. This did not become widely known until 2005, when most of the music he composed for the film was published on [[iTunes]]. Thomas's involvement stems from a complete reworking of the English version of the film. The early version featured the expatriate voice actors living in Hong Kong who worked on the [[Shaw Brothers]]' films, and used Wang Fu-ling's score. It was decided to make a new English version that would stand out from the ones of other martial arts films. New actors were brought in to re-dub the film, and Thomas re-scored the film, abandoning Wang Fu-ling's music. The German dubbed version (German: Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li, English: The Deadly Fist of Cheng Li), premiering before the reworked English version, features his score.\n\nThe third score is the 1982 Cantonese release score, which primarily features music from [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] composer [[Joseph Koo]]. However, a good portion of Koo's music in the Cantonese version was originally created in 1974 for the Japanese theatrical release of ''The Big Boss'', which was half Koo's music and half Peter Thomas's. Golden Harvest simply took Koo's music from the Japanese version and added it to the Cantonese version. Aside from this, this version is most infamous for its use of the [[Pink Floyd]] music cues from \"[[The Grand Vizier's Garden Party]], Part 2\", \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\" and \"[[Obscured by Clouds]]\", as well as [[King Crimson]]'s \"[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part II|Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two]]\". Other music cues were taken from old horror films and B-movies, including ''[[I Was A Teenage Werewolf]]'' and [[How to Make a Monster (1958 film)|''How To Make A Monster'']].<ref name=BLR>Hart, Jason (2011). \"Unravelling the Cantonese Soundtrack\".

The film was directed by Chan Chue, who was an assistant director on the original film and also reprises his role as the villainous ice factory manager. ''The Big Boss Part II'' (not to be confused with ''Big Boss 2'' starring Dragon Lee and Bolo Yeung) was partly filmed at some of the Pak Chong locations used in the original film, including the ice factory and the Buddhist temple which is used as the villain's lair. The elusive film still exists, but has never been officially released on home media.<ref>[https://bruceploitation.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/whos-the-boss-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-complaining-and-love-the-big-boss-part-ii/ Who's The Boss?

Both of these films feature their respective actors, [[Bruce Li]] and [[Jason Scott Lee]], at one point acting as Lee on the set of ''The Big Boss''. Both films feature a variation of the rumour that Lee was challenged on the set by a Thai boxer. In ''Myth'', Lee was challenged on set and was caught in the middle of an ambush later on off the set. In ''Dragon'', Lee is challenged during an actual take during filming of ''The Big Boss'', wearing the trademark rolled up long sleeve white T-shirt, white sash, and black pants. Both of these are highly exaggerated accounts (not to mention that ''Dragon'' makes the mistake of saying that filming for ''The Big Boss'' began in July 1970 rather than in July 1971), as the story told is that Lee merely discusses martial arts with a Thai fighter on the set. Besides these two examples, a third Bruce Lee biopic, ''[[The Legend of Bruce Lee]]'', this time with [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] as Lee and filmed in mini-series form, was shown in Hong Kong in 2008 as part of China's hosting of the summer Olympics. Once again, this biopic shows Lee encountering a Thai boxer on the set of ''The Big Boss'', this time with the challenger being played by martial arts film veteran [[Mark Dacascos]]. Photos and behind-the-scenes video of this scene have appeared on various websites, including Dacascos's official site.\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS releases===\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 17 March 1997\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 1 October 2001\n*'''Part of a boxset'''\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''20th Century Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Named ''Fists of Fury'''''\n*'''Classification''': R, X (known in some video releases)\n*'''Color''': NTSC\n*'''Run time''': 99 minutes\n\n===DVD releases===\n'''''Universe (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai, Vietnamese\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, trailers for ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Legacy of Rage]]'', star files\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Mega Star (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:29:1)\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, synopsis, cast and Crew biographies\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Fortune Star \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate DVD Collection (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Released''': 29 April 2004\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (DTS 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Mandarin (DTS 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, celebrity interviews, unseen footage, ''Game of Death'' outtakes, ''Enter the Dragon'' alternate opening, 32-page booklet\n*Region 3, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:27:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': None\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 18 October 2005\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Manadarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, interview with Tung Wai, bonus trailers\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Special Collector's Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 6 November 2000\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': Commentary by Bey Logan, production photo gallery, animated biography showcase of Bruce Lee with voice over, original Mandarin trailer, Hong Kong promotional trailer, UK promotional trailer, bonus trailers\n*Region 2, PAL\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Platinum Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 23 October 2006\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': '''Disc 1''': Commentary by Andrew Staton and Will Johnston, bonus trailers;
