It stars [[Lorraine Bracco]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Joseph Mazzello]], [[Adam Baldwin]], and [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] and is narrated by [[Tom Hanks]].<ref>[https://www.videodetective.com/movie/radio-flyer-12214 Video Detective]</ref> Evans was to make his directorial debut on the film but was replaced by Donner. [[Michael Douglas]] and Evans were executive producers. Filming locations included [[Novato, California]], and [[Columbia Airport (California)|Columbia Airport]] in [[Columbia, California]].\n\n==Plot==\nMike (Tom Hanks) observes his two sons fighting, with one insisting that a promise doesn't mean anything. To help them understand that a promise does mean something, he tells them the story of his youth. In 1969, 11-year-old Mike (Elijah Wood), 8-year-old Bobby, their mother, Mary, and their [[German Shepherd]], Shane, relocate from [[New Jersey]] to [[Novato, California]] after their father/husband leaves them. There, Mary weds a new man named Jack MacKenzie, who the children call \"The King\". Unbeknownst to Mary, Jack is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who often gets drunk and beats Bobby. Jack also repeatedly plays [[Hank Williams]]\u2019s \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]]\" on his record player.\n\nSeeing that Mary has found happiness at last with Jack, Bobby swears Mike to secrecy about the abuse. Instead, the two boys seek adventures to occupy the time that would otherwise be spent with Jack; they recount the \"seven great abilities and fascinations\" of childhood while exploring their new surroundings and dealing with the neighborhood bullies. An unsupervised incident in the kitchen leads to Bobby being hospitalized by Jack, but Shane gets revenge on Jack by violently biting him on the arm. After spending time in jail, Jack is released following the death of his mother and returns to their house promising never to drink or abuse Bobby again; he violates his promise while the boys are at school and nearly kills Shane. As a result, the brothers devise a plan for Bobby to escape Jack once and for all. Mary also starts to catch on to Jack's true nature and finally requests a divorce.\n\nInspired by the urban legend of a boy named Fisher who attempted to fly away on his bicycle over a cliff nicknamed \u201cThe Wishing Spot\u201d, the two convert their [[eponym]]ous [[Radio Flyer]] toy wagon into an airplane in the hopes of sending Bobby and Shane away from harm. They draw up a schematic diagram with wings and an engine and scavenge numerous parts, secretly using Jack's tools to build the aircraft in their shed. The boys also raise money though various means, such as retrieving lost balls on a golf course and selling them back to the golfers. After leaving a farewell letter for their mother, the brothers take the device to the cliff at night, but Jack discovers their plan and attempts to stop them, prompting Shane to furiously attack him. Bobby then speeds down the hill alone (knocking out Jack with the wing of his plane) and triumphantly soars into the air as Mike and Shane look on. Mary arrives with police officer Jim Daugherty and Jack is arrested. Though Mike never sees Bobby again, he continues to receive postcards from him from places all over the world.\n\nBack in the present, Mike reiterates to his sons the importance of keeping a promise, and imparts a lesson about history being in the mind of the teller. He concludes his story by saying, \"That\u2019s how I remember it.\"\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Lorraine Bracco]] as Mary Marshall\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Officer Jim Daugherty\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Mike Marshall\n** [[Tom Hanks]] as Older Mike / Narrator (''uncredited'')\n* [[Joseph Mazzello]] as Bobby Marshall\n* [[Adam Baldwin]] as Jack \"The King\" MacKenzie (Jack's face is barely seen throughout the film)\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Bill \"Geronimo Bill\"\n* [[Garette Ratliff Henson|Garette Ratliff]] as Chad\n* [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]] as Ferdie\n\n==Production==\n[[David Mickey Evans]]'s script for ''Radio Flyer'' was a hot property around Hollywood, and [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Pictures]] started a bidding war around it in November 1989. Warners had eyes on it as a vehicle for veteran director [[Richard Donner]], while Columbia was buying it on behalf of [[Michael Douglas]]'s production outfit Stonebridge Entertainment, which had a major production deal with the latter studio. Just before Thanksgiving, Columbia paid Evans a huge sum for a first-time Hollywood screenwriter: $1.25 million. The deal also gave Evans the opportunity to direct even though he had no prior experience helming a film. Douglas, however, believed Evans had the vision to pull it off. This was the first film Columbia put into production under the ownership of [[Sony]], as well as one of the first films to be greenlit by the studio's new management, led by [[Peter Guber]] and [[Jon Peters]].<ref name=\"lat\">Rosenthal, Donna (October 28, 1990).

Under Evans's direction, the film starred [[Rosanna Arquette]] as the mother, [[Tomas Arana]] as Jack, and Luke Edwards and [[James Badge Dale]] as the children.<ref name=\"ew\"/> The budget was set at $17\u201318 million after Evans agreed to cut some expensive effects sequences.<ref name=\"ew\"/> However, Stonebridge executives found the dailies disappointing, and after 10 days of filming, Douglas shut down production, at a loss of $5 million. Douglas then recruited Richard Donner as the film's new director. With Evans's blessing, Donner accepted with a $5 million paycheck, while his wife, producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] came on board. Evans remained on the film as an executive producer. With the major players recast, ''Radio Flyer'' resumed production that October. Donner had Evans rewrite the script extensively to find a way to balance escapist fantasy and child abuse without alienating the audience.<ref name=\"lat\" /><ref name=\"ew\" />\n\nThe film's original ending featured a present-day coda where a now-adult Mike, played by [[Tom Hanks]], takes his children to the [[National Air and Space Museum]], where the Radio Flyer/Plane hybrid is displayed next to [[the Wright Brothers]]' flying machine.

The site's consensus is: \"Overlaying its whimsical concept onto a gritty story of domestic abuse, ''Radio Flyer'' is a family film that is too harrowing for children and too saccharine for their parents.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Radio Flyer (1992) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/radio_flyer |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2021-07-08 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] and [[Leonard Maltin]]<ref>[https://www.google.com/books/edition/Leonard_Maltin_s_2013_Movie_Guide/yzPADT7BTRcC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=radio%20flyer%20 Leonard Maltin's 2013 Movie Guide - Google Books]</ref> both criticized the film for presenting fantasy as a way of escaping [[child abuse]].
