It uses motifs of the [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] of [[Theseus]], the return of the [[Heracleidae|Heraclids]], the [[Minotaur]], and the [[Titanomachy]], but the plot does not resemble any coherent narrative originating from Greek mythology.\n\nPrincipal photography began in Montreal on April 5, 2010. The film was released in 2D and in [[3D film|3D]] (using the [[Real D 3D]] and [[Digital 3D]] formats) on November 11, 2011 by [[Relativity Media]], becoming a commercial success at the box office by grossing over $226 million. Premiering in [[Los Angeles]] on November 8, 2011, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising Tarsem's direction and visuals, acting, ensemble cast, action sequences, production and costume design, and music score, but criticized the film's storytelling and the lack of character development.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Marie|first=Fiona|date=April 9, 2010|title=''War of the Gods'' and ''Dawn of War'' Are ''Immortals''|work=[[FilmoFilia]]|url=https://www.filmofilia.com/war-of-the-gods-and-dawn-of-war-are-immortals-14804/|access-date=April 30, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Twelve Olympians]] imprisoned the [[Titans]] beneath Mount [[Tartarus]], losing the powerful Epirus Bow. King [[Hyperion (Titan)|Hyperion]] searches for the bow to release the Titans. Hyperion attempts to capture the virgin [[Sibyl|oracle]] [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], to use her dreams and visions to find it. He heard that a man named Theseus will slay him.\n\nVillagers prepare to flee Hyperion's army, among them [[Theseus]], a warrior trained by the Old Man, who says Theseus has been chosen by the gods. His mother Aethra was raped by Zeus, and Theseus was born, so they are \"outcasts\" forced to remain behind by Lysander and his Athenian soldiers. Theseus battles them until General Helios discharges Lysander for his actions. Lysander departs and offers his service and the village's location to Hyperion, who accepts, and maims Lysander as a traitor. Hyperion's forces attack Theseus' village, murdering Aethra, and capturing Theseus.\n\nThe Old Man is [[Zeus]]. He commands his fellow gods not to interfere in mortal affairs as gods. Unless the Titans are released, they must have faith in mankind's [[free will]] to defeat Hyperion. Theseus is manacled to the thief Stavros. Phaedra, held captive nearby, sees a vision of Theseus supporting Hyperion. Phaedra and her sisters, assaulted by Hyperion's guards, kill them, provoking a riot. She uses the chaos to escape with Theseus, Stavros, and other slaves. They pursue Hyperion, but are overwhelmed by Hyperion's forces when trying to seize a boat. Poseidon, unseen by Zeus dives from Olympus into the ocean causing a tidal wave that wipes out Hyperion's men. Afterward, Phaedra sees a vision of Theseus standing near a shrouded body. She says Theseus must return home to bury his mother, Aethra.\n\nThis done, Theseus discovers the Epirus Bow in nearby rock. He frees it, but is attacked by Hyperion's henchman the Beast, whose armour resembles a [[Minotaur]]. Theseus kills him and uses the Bow to kill his allies' captors before collapsing from poisoned scratches inflicted by the Beast. Phaedra tends Theseus and falls in love with him. She begs him to take her virginity, stripping her of the visions she deems a curse and they have sex. The group returns to Phaedra's temple. Hyperion and his forces are away at Mount Tartarus. They discover Hyperion was torturing Phaedra's sister oracles to force them to tell where Phaedra is but they refused. At the temple, Stavros and Theseus are lured into an ambush. The bow is seized by Hyperion's hyena. Ares directly intervenes to save Theseus, killing the attackers. Athena then provides them with horses to reach Mount Tartarus. Zeus suddenly descends and kills Ares for disobeying his law, he spares Athena's life because she did not physically interfere like Ares did. Before ascending with Athena, Zeus tells Theseus that he and his allies will receive no more aid from the gods as he must justify the faith that Zeus has in him alone.\n\nHyperion now has the Epirus Bow. Theseus, Stavros, and Phaedra gallop to Mount Tartarus. Theseus warns King Cassander of Hyperion's plans to destroy the kingdom's children, make their future generations his own descendants, and release the Titans, but Cassander dismisses the gods as myth, intending to negotiate peace. Next day, Hyperion uses the Bow to breach the city's immense wall, killing General Helios and the wall's defenders. Theseus rallies the Hellenic army and leads them against Hyperion's forces, killing Lysander. Hyperion storms through, kills Cassander, and before Stavros and Theseus can stop him, uses the Epirus Bow to blast open the mountain and free the Titans. The blast stuns the mortals and Hyperion drops the Bow. Stavros takes it up, but is slain. Zeus and the gods descend to battle the Titans, and urge Theseus to fight Hyperion. Zeus destroys the Epirus Bow with Ares' Warhammer. The gods prove more powerful than the Titans, but are overwhelmed, and all are killed except Zeus, and Poseidon, badly wounded. Theseus kills Hyperion, and Athena dies, begging Zeus to not abandon men. Zeus collapses Mount Tartarus on the Titans and ascends to Olympus with Athena's body and the mortally wounded Theseus. The collapsing mountain wipes out Hyperion's men.\n\nTheseus' story becomes legend. Phaedra has since given birth to Theseus' son [[Acamas (son of Theseus)|Acamas]] after being impregnated by him. The Old Man tells Acamas that he will fight against evil. Acamas sees the sky filled with Olympians and Titans, and Theseus, in battle.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as [[Theseus]], a mortal chosen by Zeus to fight evil.\n** [[Robert Naylor (actor)|Robert Naylor]] as Young Theseus.\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Stavros, a cunning slave and master thief who joins Theseus on his quest.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|date=June 27, 2008|title=New ''War'' follows ''300'' path|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[MRC (company)|MRC]]|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-war-follows-300-path-114687|access-date=April 30, 2021}}</ref>\n* [[Luke Evans]] as [[Zeus]], the God of the Sky and King of the Gods.\n** [[John Hurt]] as Old Man, a disguise used by Zeus to interact with mortals.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Soon|first=Coming|date=April 6, 2010|title=''Immortals'' is the Official Title for ''War of Gods''|work=[[Mandatory (company)|ComingSoon.net]]|publisher=Evolve Media|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/64835-immortals-is-the-official-title-for-war-of-gods|access-date=May 1, 2021}}</ref>\n* [[Isabel Lucas]] as [[Athena]], the Goddess of Wisdom.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|date=November 6, 2008|title=Casting begins for ''War'', ''Titans''|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/casting-begins-for-war-titans-1117995318/|access-date=May 1, 2021}}</ref>\n* [[Kellan Lutz]] as [[Poseidon]], the God of the Sea.<ref>{{Cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=March 22, 2010|title=Kellan Lutz is one of Relativity's ''God's''|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/markets-festivals/kellan-lutz-is-one-of-relativity-s-gods-1118016750/|access-date=May 1, 2021}}</ref>\n* [[Freida Pinto]] as [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], a virgin [[Oracle]] priestess who joins Theseus on his quest.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|date=February 23, 2010|title=''Slumdog Millionaire'' star Freida Pinto Cast in Tarsem's ''War of the Gods''|work=[[/Film]]|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/slumdog-millionaire-star-freida-pinto-cast-in-tarsems-war-of-the-gods/|access-date=April 30, 2021}}</ref>\n* [[Daniel Sharman]] as [[Ares]], the God of War.\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as King Hyperion, the King of Heraklion.
