The film's original script was loosely based on the 1954 [[science fiction]] short story \"[[The Golden Man]]\" by [[Philip K. Dick]]. The film tells the story of Cris Johnson, a small-time magician based in Las Vegas, who has limited precognition. His ability allows him to see into the very immediate future. His gift not only makes him a target of a highly motivated and heavily armed group of terrorists, but also puts him in the crosshairs of the FBI who want to recruit him to oppose those terrorists instead.\n\nThe film was released on April 25, 2007, in Belgium and France, and on April 27, 2007, in the United States by [[Paramount Pictures]]. With a production budget of $78 million, the film grossed $76 million worldwide, making it a [[box office flop]].\n\nIt was the first [[Revolution Studios]] film to be distributed by Paramount Pictures, followed by 2017's ''[[XXX: Return of Xander Cage]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nCris Johnson can [[precognition|see into his future]]. He can only see two minutes ahead, with the exception of a vision he once had of a woman walking into a diner. Knowing no details other than the time, he goes to the diner twice each day at 8:09 to await her arrival. He works as a small-time magician in Las Vegas, where he supplements his income with gambling, using his powers to win medium amounts against the house.\n\nCris draws the attention of NSA Agent Callie Ferris, who has figured out his ability and wants to stop Russian terrorists from detonating a [[nuclear weapon]]. Before she can approach Cris, his gambling draws the attention of casino security. Using his ability to forecast the actions of his pursuers, he eludes them and the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department|Las Vegas police]]. Ferris tracks Cris to his location, but he escapes after foreseeing her arrival. Later that night, the casino's security chief is approached by two of the terrorists, is interrogated about Johnson and is then killed.\n\nThe following morning, Cris is at the diner again when he sees Liz Cooper, the woman from his vision. It turns out that Cris can not only see the future, but also see how his actions can affect that future. When Liz's aggressive ex-boyfriend arrives, Johnson envisions all outcomes of his intervening, and then chooses the outcome that gets him \"in\" with Liz. Knowing that she is heading for [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], Cris tricks her into giving him a ride. Ferris follows, while the terrorists decide to kill him.\n\nWith the weapon tracked to Los Angeles, Ferris persuades her superiors to let her bring Cris in. The terrorists follow in the hope that the agents will lead them to Cris.\n\nCris and Liz have to spend the night in a motel. Ferris confronts Liz near the hotel. Claiming Cris is a dangerous [[psychopathy|sociopath]], Ferris asks Liz to drug Cris so that they can bring him in peacefully. Instead, Liz warns Cris, who tells her his secret. When she asks why he will not help the FBI stop the terrorists, he explains his limitations, noting the exception for events involving her. Cris tries to escape from the FBI but is captured after saving Ferris from logs tumbling down the side of a mountain. Unable to get to Cris, the terrorists kidnap Liz.\n\nThe NSA strap Cris to a chair and force him to watch television until he has a vision that can help. They expect him to see a report about the detonation of the bomb, but instead he envisions a broadcast from several hours in the future in which Liz is killed with a bomb vest while strapped to a wheelchair as bait for him. Cris escapes and races to the parking garage where she will be killed. Catching up to him, Ferris promises to help save Liz as long as Cris will help stop the bomb; she also sets up a plan to draw out the terrorists.\n\nCris helps the NSA track the terrorists to the port where they are based. When they arrive, Cris is able to walk right up to the terrorist leader while using his power to dodge bullets. After killing the terrorists and saving Liz, they find that the bomb has already been moved. Ferris shows Cris a [[seismograph]], hoping that he will see any tremors caused by explosions before they happen. As he stares at the screen he realizes that he has made a mistake and that he was too late: the bomb detonates out at sea and completely destroys the port, as well as the rest of the city.\n\nThe timeline reverts a full day to Cris and Liz in bed at the hotel in Arizona, before Ferris arrived. Because of Liz's involvement in events, Cris has now been able to envision everything that could happen leading to the nuclear explosion. \"Every time you look into the future, it changes.\"\n\nCris calls Ferris and offers to help prevent the nuclear disaster, then asks Liz to wait for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Cris Johnson / Frank Cadillac, The Magician\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as NSA Agent Callie Ferris\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Elizabeth Cooper\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Mr. Smith\n* [[Tory Kittles]] as NSA Agent Cavanaugh\n* [[Peter Falk]] as Irv\n* [[Jim Beaver]] as NSA Director Wisdom\n* [[Enzo Cilenti]] as Mr. Jones\n* [[Jason Butler Harner]] as Jeff Baines\n* [[Jose Zuniga]] as Security Chief Roybal\n* [[Sergej Trifunovi\u0107]] as Mr. White\n* [[Jack Ong]] as Man from Korea\n* [[Jessica Barth]] as Pretty Blonde\n* [[Bonita Friedericy]] as Cashier Girl\n* [[Paul Rae]] as Road Crew Foreman\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]] and Jason Koornick initially optioned the science fiction short story \"[[The Golden Man]]\" by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Goldman wrote a script treatment that he and Koornick presented to Nicolas Cage's production company, [[Saturn Films]], but Goldman ended up writing the screenplay on spec.\n\n===Original draft===\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2012}}\nThis first draft had more similarities to the short story, detailing the efforts of a government agency to capture and contain a [[precognitive]] [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]].<ref>http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/Next-GaryGoldman.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref>\n\nTo provide greater interaction between the opposing parties (as well as create a leading role), Cris was changed from a feral animal whose existence threatened humanity's into a more familiar and understandable social outcast. A romantic subplot was added: the character of Liz Cooper, who in this draft was not only destined to be the love of Cris's life, but a mutant as well (born in [[Love Canal]]) and the only woman he has ever met with whom he can have children, herself incapable of procreating with normal humans.\n\nAs the original short story had a distinct tone of racist paranoia, the motivation for the pursuit of Cris was changed from an ironclad policy of exterminating mutations to a manipulative [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) agent's obsessive search for unconventional assets in the [[war on terror]].\n\nThis script was filled with anti-authoritarian themes, with Cris often speaking clearly and eloquently of how he enjoys his independence. He states plainly that \"what I want is freedom. And you don't get it by giving it up.\"\n\nThe DHS is explicitly depicted as a completely unregulated, astoundingly powerful and unapologetically ruthless collection of fanatics, breaking laws without consideration and eager to [[torture]] and even murder innocent civilians to achieve their objectives. They discuss their plans in using Cris as if he were a piece of machinery, most of which consist of using him as a \"timescope\": that is, bolting him into a chair for the rest of his life so his only experiences are ones which are useful to them, a process which they believe would extend the range of his abilities. One agent suggests that they [[amputate]] his [[quadraplegic|arms and legs]], a suggestion his colleague considers humorous.\n\nHowever, his enemies are skilled tormentors and eventually they drive him to the breaking point: when the DHS learns that Liz is pregnant with his child, they coldly decide to have her executed at a pre-determined time, thus pre-emptively proving to Cris their determination to possess him. He attempts to secure Liz's safety, but the DHS captures her. In retaliation, he demolishes the Las Vegas DHS headquarters with a barrel of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4 explosive]] agents had seized earlier in a warrant-less search. He and Liz are the ''only'' survivors.\n\n===Saturn re-draft===\nSaturn Films had the script extensively rewritten and in the process almost completely eliminated its anti-authoritarian themes. Though Cris remained a meek social outcast, he is somewhat less sympathetic: he is portrayed as arrogant, as well as far more prone to applying violent solutions. The DHS's role was replaced with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Despite a scene in which Cris experiences his worst nightmare \u2013 spending the rest of his life strapped into a chair with his eyes wedged open \u2013 the authorities are portrayed as sympathetic and Cris as uncooperative and belligerent. Their insistence on his obedience is reduced to the point that the authorities offer their assistance in ''rescuing'' Liz (whom they neglect to arrest despite her efforts to sabotage Cris's capture) from the terrorists. This leads to the film's greatest variation from the original draft \u2013 a confrontation with the terrorists.  No clue is given as to the motivation for the terrorists' detonation of the nuclear device in Los Angeles.  The few terrorists who speak in the film with British, French and German accents, seem to be under the guidance of an unseen leader who has told them that they must kill Cris since \"he says that Cris is the only threat to the plan\". During the confrontation with the terrorists, Cris willingly supports the FBI with his abilities in a series of sequences similar to those in the original script, only with the authorities as allies instead of antagonists.\n\nThis was the script Saturn Films brought to the attention of [[Revolution Studios]]. Revolution Studios acquired the screenplay and in November 2004, Revolution Studios hired [[Lee Tamahori]] to direct the film, with Cage in the lead role. Filming was to begin in summer 2005.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=David S.|url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117913428.html?categoryid=10&cs=1|title=Revolution turns to Sci-Fi|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2004-11-11|access-date=2007-02-13}}</ref> In December 2005, Moore was cast as the federal agent who seeks people to help prevent future terrorism and uncovers Cage's character as a potential candidate.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=David S.|url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117914519.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Moore Mulls Her 'Next' Pic|work=Variety|date=2004-12-06|access-date=2007-02-13}}</ref> In November 2005, [[Initial Entertainment Group]] negotiated for rights of international distribution of ''Next'', which had a target release date of 2007.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Cohen |first1= David S.| last2=Laporte | first2 = Nicole|url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117932204.html |title=Initial's Boarding 'Next'|work=Variety|date=2005-11-02 | access-date=2007-02-13}}</ref> In February 2006, actress Jessica Biel was cast as the love interest of Cage's character.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Fleming| url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117938717.html |title=Biel Ready for 'Next' Project|work=Variety|date=2006-02-22|access-date=2007-02-13}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2006, [[Starz!|Starz!

Mountain locations used in production of the film included [[Crestline, California|Crestline]], [[Running Springs, California|Running Springs]] and [[Big Bear Lake]]. The hotel featured in the film, \"The Cliffhanger\", is actually a restaurant overlooking the City of [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]. In order to make the restaurant look more like a hotel, a facade was attached to the building.  The facade is the section of the motel where Johnson and Liz Cooper were staying. Interior shots were filmed elsewhere. Following the end of production, the facade was removed. However, remnants of the signage placed and the paint works conducted remain intact. Running Springs served for scenes shot in the town. Scenes (in which a vehicle was rolled off the side of a cliff) shot in Big Bear Lake were shot at a campground. Due to the terrain located on the side of the cliff the Cliffhanger is located on, the producers decided to finish the scenes at the campground in Big Bear Lake.<ref name=\"Next\">[[Paramount Pictures Corporation]], ''Next'' DVD</ref>\n\n''Next'' originally was to be distributed by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] (which had a deal with Revolution), set to be released on September 28, 2006, but that studio dumped it in January 2007, and [[Paramount Pictures]] subsequently picked it up and released the film on April 27, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|first=Brandon|last=Gray|url= https://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2302&p=.htm\n|title=''Disturbia'' Tops Idle Weekend |work= [[Box Office Mojo (website)|Box Office Mojo]] | publisher = [[Amazon.com]] |date=2007-04-29|access-date=2007-04-30}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n=== Box office  {{anchor|Release|Box office}} ===\nThe film opened at #3 at the U.S. box office, grossing $7.1 million in 2,725 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref name=\"mojoweek\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=next.htm |title=Next (2007) - Weekend Box Office |access-date=2007-09-11 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> In its eight-week run in the United States, it grossed a total of just $18 million and has a combined worldwide gross of $76 million.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> Compared to other films based on Philip K.
