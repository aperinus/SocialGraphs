It is a fictional representation of behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public [[radio show]] of the  [[A Prairie Home Companion|same name]]. The film received mostly positive reviews and was a moderate box-office success on a small budget. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Garrison Keillor]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Virginia Madsen]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Lily Tomlin]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], the long-running live radio variety show ''A Prairie Home Companion'' prepares for its final broadcast, unbeknown to the listening audience. The radio station's new parent company has scheduled the show's home, the storied [[Fitzgerald Theater]], for demolition, and dispatched \"the Axeman\" to judge whether to save the show.\n\nIn between musical acts, and under the watchful eye of [[Private investigator|PI]] Guy Noir ([[Kevin Kline]]), the show's denizens mingle and reminisce, including: the singing Johnson Girls, Yolanda ([[Meryl Streep]]), her sister Rhonda ([[Lily Tomlin]]), and daughter Lola ([[Lindsay Lohan]]); cowboy duo Dusty ([[Woody Harrelson]]) and Lefty ([[John C. Reilly]]); pregnant [[Production assistant|PA]] Molly ([[Maya Rudolph]]); the Stage Manager, Makeup Lady, and Sound Effects Man (real life [[A Prairie Home Companion#Cast|Radio Acting Co.]] members [[Tim Russell]], [[Sue Scott (actress)|Sue Scott]], and [[Tom Keith]]); and the show's creator and host, [[Garrison Keillor]] (often called \"GK\").\n\nThe show is visited by an otherworldly \"Dangerous Woman\" ([[Virginia Madsen]]) in a white trench coat revealed to be Lois Peterson, a listener who died in a car accident while listening to a past broadcast, now returned as the angel Asphodel; she lends comfort to the cast and crew for the show's ending and the death of the elderly Chuck Akers ([[L. Q. Jones]]) backstage.\n\nThe Axeman ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]) arrives and swiftly declares the show too old-fashioned to keep on the air. Asphodel escorts him from the theater to an untimely demise, but the show is still canceled.\n\nYears later, the former cast reunites at [[Mickey's Diner]] with plans for a farewell tour. Their lively conversation pauses as Asphodel enters the diner.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Garrison Keillor]] as Himself\n*[[Kevin Kline]] as [[Guy Noir]]\n*[[Meryl Streep]] as Yolanda Johnson\n*[[Lily Tomlin]] as Rhonda Johnson\n*[[Lindsay Lohan]] as Lola Johnson\n*[[Woody Harrelson]] as Dusty\n*[[John C.
