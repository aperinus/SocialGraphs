It is a remake of the 1939 film ''[[The Magnificent Fraud]]'', based on the unpublished short story entitled \"Caviar for His Excellency\" by [[Charles G. Booth]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows the exploits of film actor Jack Noah, who is filming in the small, fictional [[South American]] country of [[List of fictional countries|Parador]] when Paradorian President Alfonse Simms, a dictator, invites him and the cast and crew to the film at their palace. Simms seems delighted at Jack's imitation of him.\n\nSuddenly, Alfonse Simms dies of a heart attack. Not wanting to lose his position in power, the president's right-hand man, Roberto Strausmann, forces Jack to take the 'role of a lifetime'\u2014that of the dead president, as the two men look so much alike. Jack accepts, eventually winning over the people and even the dead president's mistress, Madonna (Braga). For over a year, the two bond, and she shows Jack how the people are suffering under the dictatorship, particularly at the iron hand of Roberto (the real power behind the scene) against the rebels.\n\nJack creates a plan where, in the middle of a show featuring Sammy Davis Jr, he (as Simms) is apparently gunned down by an assassin. Before dying, \"Simms\" accuses Roberto as the true enemy, leading to his death at the hands of the crowd. Inside a van, Jack escapes. Months later, he is telling the story to his friends, who do not believe him. Jack is happy to learn that Madonna led a revolution and is now the elected president of Parador.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Jack Noah / President Alphonse Simms\n* [[Lorin Dreyfuss]] as The Real Alphonse Simms\n* [[Raul Julia]] as Roberto Strausmann\n* [[S\u00f4nia Braga]] as Madonna Mendez\n* [[Dana Delany]] as Jenny\n* [[Jonathan Winters]] as Ralph\n* [[Fernando Rey]] as Alejandro\n* [[Michael Greene]] as Clint\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as Midge\n* [[Milton Gon\u00e7alves]] as Carlo\n* [[Charo]] as Madame Loop\n* [[Marianne S\u00e4gebrecht]] as Magda Feldmarck\n* [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] as Himself\n* [[Ike Pappas]] as Himself\n* [[Edward Asner]] as Himself\n* [[Reinhard Kolldehoff]] as Gunther Feldmarck\n\n==Production==\nThe film was adopted from a 1939 [[Robert Florey]]'s film ''[[The Magnificent Fraud]]'', which plot shares similarities with ''Moon Over Parador''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-09-09-ca-1679-story.html|last=Wilmington|first=Michael|title=Movie Review: The Loony Politics of 'Moon Over Parador'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 9, 1988|accessdate=July 15, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning, while both the President and Jack are in the scene, the President is played by Dreyfuss' older brother Lorin.\n\nDuring a scene where Jack has to address the crowd as the Paradorian President, he [[Ad libitum|ad-libs]] his lines and uses the lyrics for the song \"[[The Impossible Dream (The Quest)|The Impossible Dream]]\" from ''[[Man of La Mancha]]''. [[Sammy Davis Jr.]]'s rendition of Parador's [[national anthem]] is sung against the music for \"[[B\u00e9same Mucho]]\". The previous Paradorian National Anthem (\"O Parador\") is sung to the tune of \"[[O Christmas Tree]]\".\n\nDirector [[Paul Mazursky]] appears uncredited in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], playing Simms' mother. Mazursky's wife Betsy appears at a buffet table and asks, \"Por favor, is it safe to eat this lettuce here?\" His daughter, Jill, plays the assistant director of the second film crew to shoot in Parador.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 42%, based on 12 reviews, and an average rating of 4.8/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moon_over_parador|title=Moon Over Parador (1988)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=July 15, 2021}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"[an] elaborate farce\", but also said that \"[it] has moments of true hilarity emerging only fitfully from a ponderous production\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1987/film/reviews/moon-over-parador-1200427523/|title=Moon Over Parador|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 31, 1987}}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said:\n\n{{blockquote|Parador, the Caribbean dictatorship where Paul Mazursky's new film takes place, is definitely a nice place to visit. The carnivals are colorful, the music lively, and the natives are friendly - even the bottom-pinching dictator and the diabolical, scheming chief of police.\n\nHowever, for reasons that are difficult to pinpoint, Parador is not a particularly funny place. Though Mr. Mazursky's new ''Moon Over Parador'' has the makings of a clever satire, it never gets beyond the fond, gentle mood of an amusing travelogue.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|authorlink=Janet Maslin|title=Review/Film; A So-So Actor Gets His Best Role: Impersonating a Dictator|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 9, 1988|page=13}}</ref>}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n'''[[Golden Globe Award]]'''\n*Nominated, \"Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture\" - ''Raul Julia''\n*Nominated, \"Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture\" - ''S\u00f4nia Braga''\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Magnificent Fraud]]''\n*[[Dave (film)|''Dave'' (film)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0095654}}\n*{{AFI film|58959}}\n*{{TCMDb title|20295}}\n*{{Letterboxd film|moon-over-parador}}\n*{{Amg movie|33256}}\n\n{{Paul Mazursky}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moon Over Parador}}\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paul Mazursky]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Maurice Jarre]]\n[[Category:1988 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about actors]]\n[[Category:Films about Latin American military dictatorships]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Rio de Janeiro (city)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Salvador, Bahia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ouro Preto]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in South America]]\n[[Category:Films set in a fictional country]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films about lookalikes]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
