It stars the brothers [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]] and [[Marlon Wayans]], who were also both writers with Phil Beauman. The film was released in the United States on January 12, 1996.\n\nSimilar to ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', the film spoofs a number of [[African Americans|African-American]], [[Coming-of-age story|coming-of-age]], [[hood film]]s such as ''[[Juice (1992 film)|Juice]]'', ''[[Jungle Fever]]'', ''[[South Central (film)|South Central]]'', ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', ''[[New Jack City]]'', ''[[Dead Presidents]]'', ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'', and most prominently ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' and ''[[Menace II Society]]''. The film's title borrows phrases from some of those films, and cameos from the targets, in some cases appearing in similar roles or scenes as the films being parodied.\n\n== Plot ==\nAshtray, Tray for short, is sent to the inner city to live with his father. Tray gets an education about life on the streets from his psychotic, gun-toting cousin Loc Dog, pot-smoking foul-mouthed Grandma, underage Pops, and gang members Preach and Crazy Legs. At a picnic, Tray falls for the infamous Dashiki, who has seven kids, much to the distaste of ex-convict Toothpick, who happens to be her ex-boyfriend. When Ashtray and Loc Dog head out to buy some snacks, Toothpick and his crew, Al Dog and Sam, confront Ashtray and hold him at gunpoint until Loc Dog threatens them with a missile mounted in the back of his truck, whereupon Toothpick and his gang flee the scene.\n\nLoc Dog and Ashtray are harassed in a Korean store by the owners, and Loc Dog shoots at them when they make a remark about his mother. The two are then confronted by \"The Man\" (a mysterious white government figure), who kills the Koreans and tosses them his gun to frame them and leaves.\n\nMeanwhile, Ashtray and Loc Dog's Grandma ride to church and another elderly woman disses her, resulting in a breakdancing contest that Grandma wins.\n\nAshtray visits Dashiki where they engage in [[sexual intercourse]] and Dashiki immediately claims he has impregnated her. Feeling like he's not responsible enough to be the father, Dashiki kicks him out. Meanwhile, Toothpick and Al Dog jump a new member into their gang by doing [[Double Dutch (jump rope)|Double Dutch]] jump rope. Afterwards, Sam confronts Ashtray, Loc Dog, Preach, and Crazy Legs about Ashtray impregnating Dashiki. Loc Dog knocks him out as he, Ashtray and Preach proceed to punch & stomp him, flattening him (literally). The quartet decides to get protection from their friend Old School, who advises them to protect themselves and watch out for each other, until his mother walks out and tells him to clean his bedroom.\n\nMoments later, Toothpick performs a drive-by shooting in revenge for Sam's beating and Crazy Legs is injured. With Crazy Legs hospitalized, Tray decides to confront Dashiki and become a father to their newborn baby. Dashiki agrees to give Tray another chance and they decide to leave the \u2018hood as planned.\n\nAshtray then reads a bedtime story to his Pops (who is too young to go to a party) which causes him to ejaculate before going to sleep. At the party, Loc Dog meets Keisha, whom he then takes to his mail truck for drinks and sex, during which Keisha turns into a demonic monster and attacks Loc Dog, stripping him naked while he tries to run away screaming.\n\nAshtray and Loc Dog talk about Ashtray's departure as Toothpick and his gang prepare for another drive-by shooting. As Toothpick and Loc Dog clash, Ashtray is shot. As Loc Dog and Toothpick's gang continue to exchange gunfire, Grandma pops out of the dumpster and helps Loc Dog shoot at the Toothpick's car, with both of them shooting Al Dog and Sam, then flattening a tire, causing Toothpick to be flung from the car, landing on a cop car. Preach and Dashiki find Ashtray hurt, and he regains consciousness and kisses Dashiki. A woman finds Toothpick (she turns out to be his mother) and beats him with his shoe for stealing from her in the past. Afterwards, Toothpick and his gang are presumably arrested.\n\nAfterwards, everyone goes their separate ways: Ashtray and Dashiki marry and enjoy their lives, Loc Dog becomes the host of Death Comedy Jam (a parody of [[Def Comedy Jam]]) and opens and closes the show with extreme profanity, Preach and his crush settle down together, Crazy Legs becomes a dancer as he had always dreamed, and Grandma is, as Ashtray puts it, \"still Grandma\" (showing her smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Ashtray, the [[everyman]], trying to make his way through a confusing world, is sent by his mother to live in the [[ghetto]] where his father might teach him how to become a man.

When Loc Dog is firing his gun at the owners and not hitting them, The Man fires his gun once and hits a hanging light that falls on the owners and kills them. He then tosses his gun to an unwitting Ashtray and Loc Dog, who mistakenly catch it as he scratches their names off his list of black men whom he's framed for crimes and peels off a single glove (a reference to the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O. J.
