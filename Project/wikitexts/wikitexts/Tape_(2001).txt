It stars [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Robert Sean Leonard]], and [[Uma Thurman]]. The entire film takes place in [[Real time (media)|real time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-films-set-one-location |title=10 great films set in one location |work=BFI |accessdate=18 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe entire film is set inside a [[Lansing, Michigan]] motel room. Vince, a [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]] and [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighter]] who lives in [[Oakland, California]], rents the room in his hometown to support his old high school friend's entry into the Lansing Film Festival.\n\nHis friend, [[documentary film]]maker Jon Salter, joins Vince in his motel room and the two reminisce about their high school years. At first, the two are happy to see one another, but friction soon develops. Eventually, they get on the subject of Amy, Vince's former girlfriend. It appears that, while they dated for some time, Vince and Amy never had sex. However, after or at the point when their relationship had ended, Amy slept with Jon.\n\nVince claims Amy had told him that Jon had raped her. Vince becomes obsessed with, and eventually succeeds in getting a verbal confession from Jon. Immediately after Jon's admission, Vince pulls out a hidden [[tape recorder]] that had been recording their whole conversation, much to Jon's horror. Vince then tells Jon that he has invited Amy to dinner, and that she will be arriving shortly.\n\nEventually Amy does arrive and, even though all three of them feel awkward, they begin to talk. Amy explains that she is now an [[District attorney|assistant district attorney]] in the Lansing Justice Department. Eventually, the three discuss what actually happened between Jon and Amy that night at the party, 10 years in the past.\n\nJon asks Amy's forgiveness for raping her, but Amy claims that the encounter was consensual, leading Jon to believe that she is in denial or is toying with him. After Jon becomes annoyed that Amy is refusing to accept his apology, Amy calls the police. She asks for a [[police car|squad car]] to pick up one person in possession of drugs (Vince), and one for \u201csexual misconduct\u201d (Jon). After concluding her phone call, Amy warns the men that they only have about four minutes to make a run for it.\n\nIn order to prove to Amy that he is truly remorseful, Jon decides to stay and wait for the police. Vince, realizing that there is nowhere for him to run, flushes his narcotics down the toilet and destroys the tape containing Jon's confession. Soon after, Amy reveals that she didn't really call the police and leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Vince\n* [[Robert Sean Leonard]] as Jon Salter\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Amy Randall\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe reviews of the film have been generally favorable; it currently holds a 77% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 100 collected reviews, the critical consensus reads: \"''Tape''<nowiki/>'s stagebound feel is balanced by the engrossing [[psychodrama]] of its storyline, which allows a committed cast to shine.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Tape Movie Reviews, Pictures |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tape/ |accessdate=August 25, 2022 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> It has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tape reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/tape |accessdate=2009-10-19 |website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\nFilm critic [[Roger Ebert]] said \"''Tape'' made me believe that its events could happen to real people more or less as they appear on the screen, and that is its most difficult accomplishment\" and gave this film 3.5 stars out of 4, concluding that \"for audiences they are stimulating; for other filmmakers, instruction manuals about how to use the tricky new tools.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tape-2001 |title=Tape|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=November 16, 2001|accessdate=October 19, 2009}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"incisive\" and praised the cast for giving \"the most psychologically acute performances of their film careers\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Holden |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Holden |date=October 2, 2001 |title=FILM REVIEW; Cacophony In Three Parts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/02/movies/film-review-cacophony-in-three-parts.html |accessdate=January 23, 2010 |location=New York City |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] gave the film an A- and wrote \"in ''Tape'', Ethan Hawke releases his inner actor, and it's a kick to see.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |date=November 2, 2001 |title=Tape |url=https://ew.com/article/2001/11/02/tape-2/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |location=New York City |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |authorlink=Owen Gleiberman |accessdate=January 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0275719|Tape}}\n* {{mojo title|tape|Tape}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|tape|Tape}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Tape}}\n\n{{Richard Linklater}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tape (Film)}}\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:Camcorder films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2001 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Linklater]]\n[[Category:2001 independent films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Michigan]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Lionsgate films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:Films set in motels]]"}]}}}}
