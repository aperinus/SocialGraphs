It stars [[Courteney Cox]] as Sophie, a photographer whose life begins to unravel following a traumatic incident on November 7 that involved her boyfriend, played by [[James LeGros]]. The film co-stars [[Michael Ealy]], [[Nora Dunn]], [[Anne Archer]], [[Nick Offerman]], and [[Matthew Carey (actor)|Matthew Carey]].\n\nThe low-budget [[independent film]] was directed by [[Greg Harrison]], written by Benjamin Brand and Harrison, and produced by [[Danielle Renfrew]] and [[Gary Winick]]. [[Sony Pictures Classics]] released it to theaters in the United States on July 22, 2005, and while its award-winning [[digital video]] photography was praised, many reviews criticised the film's story for being too ambiguous and derivative of other pictures. Critics have compared it to the work of film-makers such as [[David Lynch]] and [[M. Night Shyamalan]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the evening of November 7, photographer Sophie Jacobs (Cox) and her attorney boyfriend Hugh (LeGros) go to dinner at a [[Chinese food|Chinese]] restaurant. As they travel home afterward, Sophie develops a craving for \"something sweet\" and stops their car at a convenience store. While Hugh is in the store buying some chocolate for Sophie, an armed man (Carey) arrives and holds up the store, shooting the store clerk, his son, and Hugh dead. He runs away as Sophie arrives.\n\nSophie sinks into a deep [[clinical depression|depression]], and cannot bring herself to erase Hugh's voice from their apartment's answering machine. She consults her [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]], Dr. Fayn (Dunn), about persistent headaches that she has been suffering from since his death. She tells Dr. Fayn that the headaches started to occur before the incident at the convenience store, and that she had been having an affair with a co-worker, Jesse (Ealy). After Hugh's death Sophie has dinner with her mother, Carol Jacobs (Archer), who accidentally knocks a glass over.\n\nDuring a college photography class that she teaches, Sophie sets up a slide projector for the students to showcase their best photographs. One slide in the slide show depicts the exterior of the convenience store on the evening of November 7. Sophie contacts Officer Roberts (Offerman), the head of the investigation into the shootings at the convenience store, who is as puzzled as she is as to who is responsible for the photos. Sophie's headaches continue, and she begins to hear strange noises coming from within her apartment building and mysterious voices on the phone. Later, Officer Roberts discovers that the photo of the convenience store was paid for with Sophie's [[credit card]].\n\nThe film presents two more different versions of these events, and Sophie must figure out which is real before she loses grip on her sanity, and her life. The second version suggests that Sophie was present at the shootings and was only spared because the shooter ran out of bullets, and the third suggests both Sophie and Hugh were killed. In the words of Cox, her character \"goes through three phases. First there's denial. Then she feels guilty and sad about the situation. Then she has to learn to accept it.\"<ref name=\"NYDailyNews-Jul2005\">Mills, Nancy.

Brand had served as an assistant to producer Danielle Renfrew on the film ''[[Groove (film)|Groove]]'' (2000), which Greg Harrison had directed. Brand, Renfrew and Harrison were friends, and were living in their hometown of [[San Francisco]] developing separate projects at \"mini-major\" studios which, according to Renfrew, were \"wallowing in [[development hell]]\".<ref name=\"DCFilmSociety\">Cooper, Caroline.

Retrieved September 21, 2010.</ref> Brand then read a newspaper story about a shooting during the robbery of a store, in which the robber had hidden the body of the proprietor behind the counter and then taken the proprietor's place at the counter as customers came in. Inspired by the story and its setting, as well as experiences in his own life (he had once been a teacher of photography at the Academy of the Arts), Brand wrote a screenplay and presented it to Renfrew and Harrison. They were both impressed; Harrison said it was \"fascinating ... kind of an abstract exercise in narrative, which I thought was exciting and bold\".<ref name=\"About.com\">Murray, Rebecca.

Harrison, who cited the \"terrible, terrible\" experience of coping with the death of a close friend as one of his personal inspirations for the film, focused their efforts on inserting a more profound element of emotion into the script; in his words they were \"trying to express the subjective experience of trauma\".<ref name=\"TCM\"/> Once they and Renfrew were satisfied with their work, the group began pitching the project to various production companies. Renfrew consciously chose to avoid taking the project to major Hollywood studios such as [[20th Century Fox]] or [[Warner Bros.]]; instead, she opted for \"smaller companies who were interested in doing something off of center\".<ref name=\"DCFilmSociety\"/> A breakthrough was achieved after a meeting with director [[Gary Winick]], who had established a company in [[New York City]] called InDigEnt. The company specialised in backing low-budget films shot on digital video such as ''[[Personal Velocity: Three Portraits|Personal Velocity]]'' (2002), ''[[Tadpole (film)|Tadpole]]'' (2002) and ''[[Pieces of April]]'' (2003). Greg Harrison's debut film ''Groove'' had impressed executives at the company, and John Sloss of Cinetic Media said, \"''November'' is exactly the kind of sharp and invigorating material that has made InDigEnt what it is\".<ref>Henderson, Chris.

Cox was a [[comedy|comic actress]] widely known for her role on the television [[sitcom]] ''[[Friends]]'' and had participated in only a handful of more serious productions. While the Garry Trudeau project was intended as a comedy, Harrison said he felt Cox was \"very capable of drama and was very willing and wanted to transcend her comedic persona\" when they had first met.<ref name=\"About.com\"/> The project did not enter production, but when Harrison began casting for ''November'', Cox became a prime candidate for the lead role. He offered her the part without an audition: \"Courteney's biggest challenge is redefining herself ... I knew I could bring something out of her that people haven't seen before\", he said.<ref name=\"NYDailyNews-Jul2005\"/> Cox, who said she is more similar to her character in ''November'' than her ''Friends'' character, [[Monica Geller]], said, \"I wanted to make ''November'' because it's fascinating, confusing, ambiguous, eerie and makes you think. There aren't that many movies where you leave the theater and want to talk about them\".<ref name=\"NYDailyNews-Jul2005\"/> She added, \"it was trying to take you through a woman's experience of tragedy and through all the stages.

Cox had a commitment to ''Friends'', which was in production in [[Los Angeles]], and the film's production costs did not allow the entire production team to relocate to northern California for the duration for the shoot. The film-makers were forced to shoot in Los Angeles, but Renfrew later expressed no regret in their decision: \"We wanted the story to take place in an anonymous urban area. And I think we were successful in doing that\".<ref name=\"DCFilmSociety\"/>\n\nProduction finally began on May 19, 2003, and took place on Cox's days off from her ''Friends'' shooting schedule. Renfrew's home in Los Angeles stood in for the apartment of Cox's character in the film. The budget did not allow the luxury of trailers, but with some persuading, neighbouring apartments were converted into staging areas.<ref name=\"LATimes-Aug2005\"/> For her role Cox donned glasses with thick frames, and had her hair cut by seven inches and a grey streak dyed into it. Harrison said, \"She's seen in the fashion world as glamorous, a pop icon from ''Friends'', so how to dress her down, and also make her body feel different.

Harrison intended the shifts between chapters of the film\u2014and Sophie's emotions\u2014to be signalled visually, and he instructed Schreiber to employ different colour casts accordingly. For the opening robbery scenes (which recur throughout the film), Schreiber purchased two [[Panasonic AG-DVX100]] cameras with [[white balance]] and [[color temperature]] controls. She used them with [[lighting gel]]s and [[sodium vapor lamp|sodium street lamps]] that surrounded the real-life convenience store where the crew was shooting to make the image appear green. A similar process was used in the second movement of the narrative, which was bathed in orange to represent Sophie's despair, while white expressed \"acceptance\" in the film's third and final act. To help achieve a blue colour cast for the first phase of the film (\"denial\"), Schreiber surrounded the shooting locations with machines that pumped smoke across the set. Cinematographer and [[Sundance Film Festival]] judge Frederick Elmes commented of Schreiber's work, \"She lit it and used colors in a way that the camera responded. And I don't think that's the kind of thing you do by accident. That's completely designed\".<ref>[http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/spring2004/features/lens_crafter.php \"Lens Crafter\"].

Of the tight schedule and production costs, Harrison said, \"I don't recommend shooting a movie that way and I don't want to do it again to be honest. It's really, really taxing\".<ref name=\"TheMovieChicks\"/>\n\nOnce shooting had wrapped, Harrison entered the editing room and constructed the film over the course of eighteen weeks, occasionally consulting colleagues such as [[Sarah Flack]] (editor of ''[[The Limey]]'' (1999) and ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' (2003)). Harrison, who had started out in the film industry as an editor, noted the strong involvement of key creative personnel throughout the pre-production, production and post-production stages, and called it \"kind of a more holistic approach to post-production\".<ref name=\"About.com\"/> He described the experience of editing the film alone (for the most part) as \"brutal\" and \"exhausting\",<ref name=\"TheMovieChicks\"/> but he said he was satisfied with his work nonetheless.
