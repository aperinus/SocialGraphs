Starring [[Michael Douglas]], [[Glenn Close]], and [[Anne Archer]], the film centers on a married man who has a weekend affair with a woman who refuses to allow it to end and becomes obsessed with him.\n\n''Fatal Attraction'' was released on September 18, 1987, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received positive reviews from critics, but generated controversy at the time of its release. The film became a huge box office success, grossing $320.1 million against a $14 million budget, becoming the [[1987 in film|highest-grossing film of 1987 worldwide]]. At the [[60th Academy Awards]], it received six nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Close), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Archer), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\n== Plot ==\nDaniel \"Dan\" Gallagher is a successful, happily-married [[Manhattan]] lawyer whose work leads him to meet Alexandra \"Alex\" Forrest, an [[Editing|editor]] for a [[Publishing|publishing company]]. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town for the weekend, Dan has an affair with Alex. Although it was initially understood by both as just a fling, Alex begins to cling to him.\n\nAfter leaving unexpectedly in the middle of the night, Dan reluctantly spends the following day with Alex after she persistently asks him over. When Dan attempts to leave again, she cuts her wrists in a manipulative ploy to force him to stay. He helps her bandage the cuts, stays with her overnight to make sure she is all right, and leaves in the morning. Although Dan believes the affair to be forgotten, Alex shows up at his office one day to apologize for her behavior and invites him to a performance of ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'', but he politely turns her down. She then continues to call him at his office until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls.\n\nAlex then phones Dan's home at all hours, claiming that she is [[pregnant]] and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. After he changes his home phone number, she shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her, which results in a scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored.\n\nDan moves his family to [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]], but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid onto his car, ruining the engine, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard: the sight of the family makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further when Dan approaches the police to apply for a [[restraining order]] against Alex (claiming that it is \"for a client\"). The lieutenant claims that he cannot violate her rights without [[probable cause]], and that the \"client\" has to own up to his [[adultery]].\n\nAt one point, while the Gallaghers are not home, Alex kills Ellen's pet rabbit, and puts it on their stove to boil; Beth finds the pot and screams in terror. After this, Dan admits the affair and Alex's supposed pregnancy to Beth. Enraged, she tells Dan to leave. Before he goes, Dan calls Alex to tell her that Beth knows about the affair. Beth gets on the phone and warns Alex that she will kill her if she persists. Without Dan and Beth's knowledge, Alex picks up Ellen from school and takes her to an amusement park. Beth panics when she cannot find Ellen. She drives around frantically searching and rear-ends a car stopped at an intersection which causes her to be injured and hospitalized. Alex drops Ellen off at home unharmed, asking her for a kiss on the cheek.\n\nDan barges into Alex's apartment and attacks her, strangling her and coming close to killing her. He stops himself, but as he does, she lunges at him with a kitchen knife. He overpowers her but decides to put the knife down and leave, while Alex is leaning against the kitchen counter, smiling. The police begin to search for her after Dan tells them about the kidnapping. Following Beth's release from the hospital, she forgives Dan, and they return home.\n\nBeth prepares a bath for herself when Alex suddenly appears with the kitchen knife and explains her belief that Beth is standing in the way of having Dan to herself, before proceeding to attack her. Dan hears the screaming, rushes in, wrestles Alex into the bathtub, and seemingly drowns her. She suddenly emerges from the water, swinging the knife, but Beth arrives with Dan's [[revolver]] and shoots Alex in the chest, finally killing her. The final scene shows police cars outside the Gallaghers' house. As Dan finishes delivering his statement to the police, he walks inside, where Beth is waiting for him. They embrace and proceed to the living room as the camera focuses on a picture of the family.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Michael Douglas - Streets.JPG|thumb|Michael Douglas portrays Daniel \"Dan\" Gallagher|203x203px]]\n\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Dan Gallagher - husband of Beth, father of Ellen, and a New York attorney who has an affair with Alex Forrest and later regrets it.\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Alex Forrest - who becomes obsessed with Dan after a very brief affair.\n* [[Anne Archer]] as Beth Rogerson Gallagher\n* Ellen Hamilton Latzen as Ellen Gallagher\n* [[Stuart Pankin]] as Jimmy\n* [[Ellen Foley]] as Hildy\n* [[Fred Gwynne]] as Arthur, Dan's boss\n* [[Meg Mundy]] as Joan Rogerson, Beth's mother\n* Tom Brennan as Howard Rogerson, Beth's father\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Martha, Dan's secretary\n* [[Mike Nussbaum]] as Bob Drimmer\n* [[J.

In Meyer's book ''The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood'', he explains that in late 1986 producer [[Stanley R. Jaffe]] asked him to look at the script developed by Dearden, and he wrote a four-page memo making suggestions, including a new ending. A few weeks later Meyer met with director [[Adrian Lyne]] and gave him some additional suggestions. Ultimately Meyer was asked to redraft the script on the basis of his suggestions, which ended up being the shooting script.\n\n=== Casting ===\nProducers [[Sherry Lansing]] and Stanley R. Jaffe both had serious doubts about casting Glenn Close because they did not think she could be sexual enough for the role of Alex.<ref name=\"Oxford Union\">{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDWDhntzc-w| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/qDWDhntzc-w| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live| title=Glenn Close Full Address & Q&A Oxford Union| author=Oxford Union| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2018-05-04| access-date=2018-08-18}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Barbara Hershey]] was originally considered for the role.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/movies/fatal-attraction-oral-history.html|title = 'Fatal Attraction' Oral History: Rejected Stars and a Foul Rabbit|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 14 September 2017|last1 = Fretts|first1 = Bruce}}</ref> Several actresses auditioned for the part, but they were almost all turned down.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Close was persistent, and after meeting with Jaffe several times in New York, she was asked to fly out to Los Angeles to read with Michael Douglas in front of Adrian Lyne and Lansing.

She was uncomfortable with the bunny boiling scene, which she thought was too extreme, but she was assured on consulting the psychologists that such an action was entirely possible and that Alex's behavior corresponded to someone who had experienced incestual sexual abuse as a child.<ref name=\"Oxford Union\"/>\n\n=== Alternate ending ===\nAlex Forrest was originally scripted slashing her throat at the film's end with the knife Dan had left on the counter, so as to make it appear that Dan had murdered her. After seeing her husband being taken away by police, Beth finds a revealing cassette tape that Alex sent Dan in which she threatens to kill herself. Upon realizing Alex's intentions, Beth takes the tape to the police, who clear Dan of the murder. The last scene shows, in flashback, Alex taking her own life by slashing her throat while listening to ''Madame Butterfly''.\n\nAfter doing test screenings, Joseph Farrell (who handled the test screenings) suggested that Paramount shoot a new ending.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/business/joseph-farrell-dies-at-76-used-market-research-to-shape-films.html|title=Joseph Farrell, Who Used Market Research to Shape Films, Dies at 76|first=Bruce|last=Weber|date=December 26, 2011|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-date=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707234314/https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/business/joseph-farrell-dies-at-76-used-market-research-to-shape-films.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-nov-07-tm-30884-story.html|title=SHADOW FORCE|date=November 7, 1999|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=December 10, 2020|archive-date=August 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808201509/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-nov-07-tm-30884-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2002 Special Edition DVD, Close comments that she had doubts about re-shooting the film's ending because she believed the character would \"self-destruct and commit suicide\".<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Close eventually gave in on her concerns, and filmed the new sequence after having fought against the change for two weeks.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Close has described how protective she was of her character, whom she \"never thought of as a villain\",<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IY8lxuo_yA&t=1s| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211117/3IY8lxuo_yA| archive-date=2021-11-17 | url-status=live| title=Fatal Attraction Reunion Interview| publisher=YouTube.com| date=2010-03-06| access-date=2018-08-18}}{{cbignore}}</ref> stating that: \"I wasn't playing a generality, I wasn't playing a clich\u00e9.
