The film was named after the 1966 hit single \"[[Sugar Town]]\" by [[Nancy Sinatra]].\n\nAnders was eager to make another film about the music industry after her earlier films ''[[Border Radio]]'' and ''[[Grace of My Heart]]''.  After her friend [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]] had left [[Duran Duran]] and was beginning to launch an acting career, she and Voss wrote the film fairly quickly, and cast several musical friends of hers in the convoluted plot.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 26, 1999, where it received a distribution deal with [[October Films]] and [[USA Films]].  ''Sugar Town'' was then shown in limited release in the United States in September of that year, before appearing at several overseas film festivals.\n\n==Plot summary==\nClive, Jonesey and Nick form an aging [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] built of refugees from other bands.  They and their producer Burt seek backing from Jane, a rich investor who will only help if the lead singer will sleep with her.\n\nLiz is a neurotic film production designer who has just hired a conniving young housekeeper and would-be singer named Gwen.  Liz searches hopelessly for a decent man while Gwen commits acts of shameless cruelty in the service of her ambition.\n\nBest friend to Liz is Clive's wife Eva, an older actress who is struggling to get good roles.  Clive and Eva's life is thrown into upheaval when a cult member shows up on their doorstep to drop off a surly 12-year-old \"love child\" that she claims Clive fathered.\n\nA subplot involves guitarist Carl, who is hired to travel away from his pregnant wife by a singer with ulterior motives, just as his [[Substance dependence|junkie]] brother emerges from [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] and comes to stay with the family.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n{{Cast listing|\n* Jade Gordon as Gwen\n* [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]] as Clive\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Eva\n* [[Michael Des Barres]] as Nick\n* [[Martin Kemp]] as Jonesy\n* [[Larry Klein]] as Burt\n* [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] as Carl\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Kate\n* [[Ally Sheedy]] as Liz\n}}\n\n===Supporting cast===\n{{Cast listing|\n* Marion Moseley as In Utero Baby\n* Veronica Nommenson as Violet\n* Elena Nommenson as Rose\n* Amelia Nommenson as Daisy\n* Nicholas Walker as Masseuse\n* Jeff McDonald\n* Catherine Munro as Groupie #1\n* Kristina Hayes as Groupie #2\n* Alyse Pozzo as Groupie #3\n* Richmond Arquette as Rick\n* [[Lumi Cavazos]] as Rosio\n* [[Michael E.

The filmmakers may have found such spontaneity liberating, but it harmed their project as much as helped it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sugar Town |work=www.chron.com |date=October 8, 1999 |url=https://www.chron.com/life/article/Sugar-Town-1677144.php |access-date=January 28, 2022 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Sugar Town'' received generally mixed reviews from critics.
