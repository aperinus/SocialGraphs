The [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|47th animated film produced by the studio]], it is loosely based on the 1990 children's book ''[[A Day with Wilbur Robinson]]'' by [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]]. The film follows the interactions between Lewis, an orphaned 12-year-old inventor desperate to be adopted, and Wilbur Robinson, a young time-traveler who is trying to prevent a mysterious bowler-hatted man from changing Lewis' story, and, by proxy, the entire future.\n\nDirected by [[Stephen Anderson (artist)|Stephen Anderson]], the film's voice cast includes Anderson, Daniel Hansen, Jordan Fry, Wesley Singerman, [[Angela Bassett]], [[Tom Selleck]], [[Harland Williams]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], [[Nicole Sullivan]], [[Adam West]], [[Ethan Sandler]], and [[Tom Kenny]]. ''Meet the Robinsons'' was released in standard and [[Disney Digital 3-D]] versions on March 23, 2007 in the United Kingdom and March 30, 2007 in the United States.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards the animation and story.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $169.3 million against a budget of $150 million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 10 Best Disney Movies That Bombed at the Box Office |url=https://observer.com/2020/05/best-disney-films-that-bombed-at-box-office-disney-plus-movies/ |access-date=July 18, 2022 |website=Observer}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nLewis is an aspiring 12-year-old inventor who grew up in an [[orphanage]]. His energy and eccentricity have been scaring off potential parents, so he works all night on a machine to scan his memory to locate his birth mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage when he was a baby. While taking the scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a [[bowler hat]] has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it has been sabotaged by Bowler Hat Guy and falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of his robotic bowler hat named Doris, steals the scanner.\n\nWilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis demands proof that Wilbur is telling the truth. Wilbur does so by taking them in a second time machine to the year 2037, which is highly advanced technologically. When they arrive, Lewis realizes he can simply use the time machine to meet his mother; the resulting argument makes them crash. Wilbur asks Lewis to fix the time machine, and Lewis agrees on the condition that Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis accidentally leaves, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinson family except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father and the inventor of the time's technologies, who is away on a business trip. Having followed Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris try to kidnap him, but the Robinsons beat them back. The Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he is from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust.\n\nThe Bowler Hat Guy and Doris approach Lewis, and offer to take him to his mother if he fixes the memory scanner. Once he does, they betray him and tie him up. The Bowler Hat Guy reveals that Cornelius Robinson is, in fact, Lewis's future self, and that he himself is an adult version of Lewis's roommate, Michael \"Goob\" Yagoobian. Because he was kept awake by Lewis's work on the scanner, Goob fell asleep during a [[Little League]] baseball game and failed to make an important catch, costing his team the championship. Goob became so withdrawn and bitter that he was never adopted and remained in the orphanage long after it closed. Doris is \"DOR-15\", one of Lewis's failed and abandoned inventions. They both blamed Lewis for their misfortunes and decided to ruin his life. Leaving Lewis in the future, they return to the past and enact their plan. However, it is revealed that Doris tricked everyone; once mass-produced, the Doris hats dispose of Goob and enslave humanity. Lewis repairs the second time machine, confronts Doris in the past, and destroys her by promising to never invent her, restoring the future to its utopian state. Wilbur tries to ask the adult Goob to join the family, but he has fled in remorse.\n\nBack in Wilbur's time, Lewis finally meets Cornelius face to face. Cornelius explains how the memory scanner started their successful career, and persuades Lewis to return to the science fair. Wilbur takes Lewis back, but makes one stop first: as he promised, he takes Lewis back to see the moment when his mother abandoned him.\n\nWilbur drops Lewis off in his own time and leaves. Lewis heads to the fair, en route waking up Goob just in time for him to make the winning catch. Back at the fair, Lewis asks for one more chance to demonstrate his scanner, which this time succeeds. He is adopted by Lucille, one of the science fair judges, and her husband Bud, who nicknames him \"Cornelius\" and takes him home.\n\nThe film ends with a quote which reiterates the message of not dwelling on failures and \"keep moving forward\", attributed to [[Walt Disney]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*Jordan Fry and Daniel Hansen as Lewis, a 12-year-old boy genius who struggles to become adopted.\n**[[Tom Selleck]] as Cornelius, Lewis' older self\n* [[Wesley Singerman]] as Wilbur Robinson, the 13-year-old son of Franny and Cornelius Robinson.\n* [[Stephen Anderson (artist)|Stephen Anderson]] as Bowler Hat Guy, Michael \u201cGoob\u201d Yagoobian\u2019s future self and Lewis\u2019s old roommate.\n**Matthew Josten as Michael \"Goob\" Yagoobian, the Bowler Hat Guy's younger self\n**Anderson also provided the voices of Grandpa Bud Robinson, Lewis\u2019s adoptive father; and Cousin Tallulah, the daughter of Fritz and Petunia Robinson, and Laszlo\u2019s sister.\n* [[Harland Williams]] as Carl, the Robinson family\u2019s robot.\n* [[Nicole Sullivan]] as Franny Robinson, the wife of Cornelius Robinson, mother of Wilbur Robinson, and the sister of Gaston and Art Robinson.\n**Jessie Flower as young Franny\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Mildred, the head of the Sixth Street Orphange.\n* [[Adam West]] as Uncle Art, a pizza delivery man with a superhero persona, Gaston and Franny\u2019s brother, and Wilbur\u2019s uncle.\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Lucille Krunklehorn, Lewis\u2019s adoptive mother.\n* [[Ethan Sandler]] as:\n**DOR-15 (Doris), a bowler hat designed by Cornelius Robinson to be a helping hat, but expanded beyond its intelligence for revenge.\n**Uncle Fritz, Petunia Robinson\u2019s husband, Bud and Joe Robinson\u2019s brother, and the father of Laszlo and Tallulah Robinson.\n**Aunt Petunia, a hand puppet who is the wife of Fritz Robinson and the mother of Laszlo and Tallulah Robinson.\n**Uncle Spike and Uncle Dimitri, a pair of twins who sit in potted plants in front of the Robinson household.

Ten months later, almost 60% of the film had been scrapped and redone.
