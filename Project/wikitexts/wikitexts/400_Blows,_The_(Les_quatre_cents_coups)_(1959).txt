Written by Truffaut and [[Marcel Moussy]], the film is about [[Antoine Doinel]], a misunderstood adolescent in Paris who struggles with his parents and teachers due to his rebellious behavior. Filmed on location in Paris and Honfleur, it is the first in a series of five films in which L\u00e9aud plays the semi-autobiographical character.\n\n''The 400 Blows''  received numerous awards and nominations, including the [[Cannes Film Festival]] Award for Best Director, the OCIC Award, and a [[Palme d'Or]] nomination in 1959, and was also nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] in 1960.

Misunderstood by his parents for playing truant from school and stealing, and tormented in school for discipline problems by his teacher (such as writing on the classroom wall, and later falsely explaining his absence as having been due to his mother's death), Antoine frequently runs away from both places. He finally quits school after his teacher accuses him of plagiarizing [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]]. (Antoine loves Balzac and in a school essay he describes \"the death of my grandfather\", in a close paraphrase of Balzac from memory.) He steals a Royal typewriter from his stepfather's workplace to finance his plans to leave home, but, having been unable to sell it, is apprehended while trying to return it.\n\n[[File:The Famous Final Frame of \"Les Quatre Cents Coups\".jpg|thumb|left|Antoine Doinel in the final scene]]\nThe stepfather turns Antoine over to the police and Antoine spends the night in jail, sharing a cell with prostitutes and thieves. During an interview with the judge, Antoine's mother confesses that her husband is not Antoine's biological father. Antoine is placed in an [[Youth detention center|observation center for troubled youths]] near the seashore (as his mother wished). A psychologist at the center probes reasons for Antoine's unhappiness, which the youth reveals in a fragmented series of monologues.\n\nWhile playing football with the other boys one day, Antoine escapes under a fence and runs away to the ocean, which he has always wanted to see. He reaches the shoreline of the sea and runs into it. The film concludes with a freeze-frame of Antoine, which, via an [[optical printer|optical effect]], zooms in on his face as he looks into the camera.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as [[Antoine Doinel]]\n* [[Albert R\u00e9my]] as Julien Doinel, Antoine's stepfather\n* [[Claire Maurier]] as Gilberte Doinel, Antoine's mother\n* [[Guy Decomble]] as Sourpuss, School teacher\n* Patrick Auffay as Ren\u00e9 Bigey, Antoine's best friend\n* [[Georges Flamant]] as Monsieur Bigey, Ren\u00e9's father\n* [[Pierre Repp]] as an English teacher\n* Daniel Couturier as Betrand Mauricet\n* [[Luc Andrieux]] as Le professeur de gym\n* Robert Beauvais as director of the school\n* {{ill|Yvonne Claudie|fr|Yvonne Claudie}} as Mme Bigey\n* {{ill|Marius Laurey|fr|Marius Laurey}} as L'inspecteur Cabanel\n* {{ill|Claude Mansard|fr|Claude Mansard}} as the examining magistrate\n* [[Jacques Monod (actor)|Jacques Monod]] as commissioner\n* Henri Virlojeux as the night watchman\n* [[Jeanne Moreau]] as a woman looking for her dog\n* [[Jean-Claude Brialy]] as a man trying to pick up a woman\n{{Div col end}}\n\nTruffaut also included a number of friends (fellow directors) in bit or background parts, including: himself and [[Philippe De Broca]] in the funfair scene;
