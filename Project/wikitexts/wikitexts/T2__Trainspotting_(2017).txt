Set in and around [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, it is based on characters created by [[Irvine Welsh]] in his 1993 novel ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' and its 2002 follow-up ''[[Porno (novel)|Porno]]''. A sequel to Boyle's 1996 film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', ''T2'' stars the original [[ensemble cast]], including leads [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Ewen Bremner]], [[Jonny Lee Miller]], and [[Robert Carlyle]], with [[Shirley Henderson]], [[James Cosmo]], and [[Kelly Macdonald]]. The film features a new character, Veronika, played by [[Anjela Nedyalkova]], and includes clips, music, and archive sound from the first film.\n\n''T2 Trainspotting'' was released in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2017, and worldwide throughout February and March 2017. It received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $42.1 million against a production budget of $18 million.\n\n==Plot==\nNearly 21 years after stealing a large sum of drug money from his friends and making a new life in [[Amsterdam]], 46-year-old [[Mark Renton]] suffers a [[heart attack]] in a gym. Though now two decades sober from heroin, he is undergoing divorce and imminent redundancy. Facing a [[mid-life crisis]] and depression, he decides to take a nostalgic trip back to [[Edinburgh]]. Daniel \"Spud\" Murphy has returned to a cycle of heroin addiction after separating from his wife, Gail, and losing custody of his teenage son, Fergus, whom he fathered shortly after Renton left. Simon \"Sick Boy\" Williamson abuses [[cocaine]], runs a failing pub and engages in blackmail schemes with his Bulgarian girlfriend, Veronika. Francis \"Franco\" Begbie is serving a lengthy prison sentence and attacks his lawyer after having his sentence extended for another five years.\n\nRenton visits Spud just in time to save him from a suicide attempt, offering to help him overcome his addictions. Renton visits Sick Boy at his pub, where Sick Boy attacks Renton, still furious from being ripped off. Afterward, Renton meets Veronika and pays Sick Boy back his original share of the money. Unimpressed, Sick Boy informs Veronika that he plans to take revenge.\n\nBegbie escapes from prison and returns to his estranged wife June's flat, meeting his college-bound son, Frank Jr., whom he forces to join him in burgling houses after ridiculing his son's choice of studying hotel management instead of committing crimes. He visits Sick Boy, who pretends to have heard of Renton living in Amsterdam and promises to provide Begbie with a false passport so he can travel to the Netherlands for revenge.\n\nRenton, Sick Boy, and Veronika fraudulently apply for a \u00a3100,000 EU business development grant to turn the pub's upper floor into the business venture he had promised Veronika, a brothel disguised as a sauna. Veronika, however, finds herself attracted to Renton, and they begin an affair. Meanwhile, Spud joins in the renovation and befriends Veronika, who inspires him to write his memoirs. One of Sick Boy's blackmail targets reports him to the police, and Renton seeks legal advice from his ex-girlfriend, Diane Coulston, now a solicitor. The proceeds of their crimes are quickly used up in legal fees and Sick Boy's cocaine addiction. Renton manages to escape from Begbie after a chance encounter at a nightclub, but Doyle, owner of a rival brothel, kidnaps him and Sick Boy, drives them to the countryside, and intimidates them into abandoning their scheme, leaving them to walk back to Edinburgh naked.\n\nBegbie visits Spud and, reading his memoirs, discovers that Renton left Spud his share of the money. Veronika arrives, and Begbie steals her phone, which he uses to text Renton and Sick Boy to come to the pub at midnight. Veronika takes Spud to her apartment and asks him to leave with her, promising him half of the \u00a3100,000. Spud fears he will spend it on heroin again, so she offers to give his share to Gail and Fergus. He helps transfer the money to Veronika's account by forging Renton's and Sick Boy's signatures. After reading another excerpt of Spud's writings about their encounter with Begbie's alcoholic father in the derelict [[Leith Central railway station]], Begbie visits June's flat for the last time, apologising to Frank Jr. for his abuse and telling him that he (Frank Jr.) will be a better man than Begbie or his father were.\n\nSpud arrives too late at the pub to warn Renton and Sick Boy of Begbie's ploy. Begbie knocks Sick Boy unconscious and chases Renton across the upstairs floor. He throws Renton through the floorboards, leaving him hanging by the neck from electrical wiring; Begbie tries to strangle him, but Sick Boy douses him with pepper spray and saves Renton. Begbie pulls out a sawn-off shotgun and tries to kill them both, but Spud hits him with a toilet bowl.\n\nThey leave Begbie in the boot of Sick Boy's car outside the prison. Veronika returns to her son in Bulgaria. Spud puts together his book of memoirs and mends his relationship with Fergus and Gail, who suggests the title \"Trainspotting.\" Renton and Sick Boy resume their old friendship. Renton moves back into his now-widowed father's home and embraces him in reconciliation before going to his bedroom and dancing to a remix of \"[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop song)|Lust for Life]]\".\n\n== Cast ==\n<!---  main per highlighted end credits order (kids attached), remainder per subsequent closing scroll --->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Mark \"Rent Boy\" Renton\n** Hamish Haggerty as young Renton\n** Ben Skelton as 9-year-old Renton\n** Connor McIndoe as 20-year-old Renton\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Daniel \"Spud\" Murphy\n** Aiden Haggarty as 9-year-old Spud\n** [[John Bell (Scottish actor)|John Bell]] as 20-year-old Spud\n* [[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Simon \"Sick Boy\" Williamson\n** Logan Gillies as 9-year-old Simon\n** James McElvar as 20-year-old Simon\n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as Francis \"Franco\" Begbie\n** Daniel Jackson as young Begbie\n** Daniel Smith as 9-year-old Begbie\n** Christopher Mullen as 20-year-old Begbie\n* [[Kelly Macdonald]] as Diane Coulston\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Gail Houston\n* [[James Cosmo]] as Mr Renton, Mark's father\n* [[Anjela Nedyalkova]] as Veronika Kovach\n* [[Steven Robertson]] as Stoddart, Begbie's lawyer\n* Elek Kish as Dozo\n* [[Simon Weir]] as Jailhoose\n* Bradley Welsh as Mr Doyle\n* [[Pauline Turner]] as June Begbie\n* Kyle Fitzpatrick as Fergus Murphy\n** Charlie Hardie as 9-year-old Fergus\n* Scot Greenan as Franco Begbie Jr.\n* [[Katie Leung]] as Nurse\n* Michael Shaw as 20-year-old Tommy\n* Elijah Wolf as 9-year-old Tommy\n{{div col end}}\n\nArchival footage included Eileen Nicholas as Mrs Renton and [[Kevin McKidd]] as Tommy MacKenzie from the first film.

Boyle also clarified that [[John Hodge (screenwriter)|John Hodge]] wrote an original screenplay for the sequel, and that the film would not be a strict adaptation of ''Porno''.

You couldn't call it ''T3'' because, although some of the other characters come into it, they're only featured just momentarily. It's a solo story. You could call that a spin-off. [''The Blade Artist''] is a great read.\" Carlyle was likewise open to an adaptation of ''The Blade Artist''. \"We've been talking about that, I am up for doing it\", he said at the ''T2'' premiere in Edinburgh. \"So maybe we ain't seen the end of Begbie just yet\".<ref name=\"thr-spinoff\" />\n\nBoyle stated he would be more interested in directing a true sequel rather than a spin-off, preferring to work with all of the principal actors. \"My affection is toward all four of them\", Boyle said. \"People regarded the first movie as being Renton's movie, and I never really saw it like that, though he does dominate because of the voice-over. I always saw it as an ensemble movie, so I'm still very much in that mode.\"<ref name=\"thr-spinoff\">{{cite web |date= 2017-03-19 |author= Ashley Lee |url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/trainspotting-third-film-spinoff-begbie-danny-boyle-says-986618|title=Why Danny Boyle Wants a 'Trainspotting' Spinoff Over a Third Film|publisher= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=19 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIrvine Welsh has also hinted that a ''Trainspotting'' television series is possible.<ref name=\"nme-tv\">{{cite web |date=9 November 2016 |author=Luke Morgan Britton |url= http://www.nme.com/news/film/irvine-welsh-teases-trainspotting-spin-off-tv-series-1837977|title=Irvine Welsh teases 'Trainspotting' spin-off TV series |publisher= NME |access-date=19 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2021, Carlyle confirmed that a Begbie spin-off series is in development.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peplow|first=Gemma|title=Trainspotting at 25: Robert Carlyle reveals details of new series following Begbie - as 'definitive' book marks film's 25th anniversary|url=https://news.sky.com/story/trainspotting-at-25-robert-carlyle-reveals-details-of-new-series-following-begbie-as-definitive-book-marks-films-25th-anniversary-12485039|work=Sky News|date=5 December 2021}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|2763304}}\n\n{{Trainspotting}}\n{{Danny Boyle}}\n{{Irvine Welsh}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2017 films]]\n[[Category:2017 black comedy films]]\n[[Category:2010s buddy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British black comedy films]]\n[[Category:British buddy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British crime comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British sequel films]]\n[[Category:DNA Films films]]\n[[Category:Films about heroin addiction]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on multiple works]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Danny Boyle]]\n[[Category:Films set in Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Hodge]]\n[[Category:Punk films]]\n[[Category:Scots-language films]]\n[[Category:Trainspotting]]\n[[Category:Film4 Productions films]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:English-language Scottish films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s British films]]"}]}}}}
