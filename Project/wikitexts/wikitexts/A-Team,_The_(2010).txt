Directed by [[Joe Carnahan]] and written by Carnahan, [[Brian Bloom]], and [[Skip Woods]], the film stars [[Liam Neeson]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Quinton Jackson]], [[Sharlto Copley]], and [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]. The film tells the story of a Special Forces team who, imprisoned for a crime they did not commit, escapes and sets out to clear their names. The film was produced by Cannell,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://movies.tvguide.com/movie-news/team-film-works-1002195.aspx | title = A-Team Hopes to Bring \"A\" Game to Silver Screen | work = yahoo TV | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101006020202/http://movies.tvguide.com/movie-news/team-film-works-1002195.aspx | archive-date = 2010-10-06 }}</ref> [[Tony Scott]], and (as executive producer) his brother [[Ridley Scott]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7856758.stm | title = Ridley Scott to remake The A-Team | work = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 2009-01-28 | access-date = 2009-10-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | date = 2009-01-27 | title = Fox assembles 'A-Team' | url = https://www.variety.com/VR1117999155.html | publisher = Variety | access-date = 2009-10-09 | first = Michael | last = Fleming}}</ref>\n\nThe film had been in development since the mid-1990s having gone through a number of writers and story ideas and being put on hold a number of times. Neeson, Cooper, and the rest of the cast joined in summer 2009, and filming took place around Canada later that year. The film was theatrically released on June 11, 2010, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and action sequences but criticized the script. A sequel was initially anticipated, but after the film underperformed at the box office, grossing $177 million worldwide against its $110 million budget, plans were scrapped.\n\n==Plot==\n[[John \"Hannibal\" Smith]] is held captive in Mexico by two [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Federal Police]] officers working for renegade General Javier Tuco. Hannibal escapes and sets out to rescue his friend [[Templeton Peck|Templeton \"Face\" Peck]], who is held captive at Tuco's ranch. Hannibal saves Face after enlisting former [[75th Ranger Regiment|Ranger]] [[B.A. Baracus]], driving to the rescue in BA's modified [[GMC Vandura]]. Pursued by Tuco, they stop at a nearby [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Hospital]] to recruit the services of their pilot [[Howling Mad Murdock]]. They flee in a medical helicopter, chased by Tuco, in a [[dogfight]] that leaves BA with a phobia of flying. The battle ends when they lure Tuco's helicopter into American airspace, where it is shot down by an [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22 Raptor]] for trespassing, killing Tuco and his men.\n\nEight years later in Iraq, Hannibal is contacted by CIA [[Special Activities Division]] operative [[Agent Lynch|Lynch]], who assigns them on a [[black operation]] to recover [[United States Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] plates and over $1 billion in cash slated to move out of Baghdad in an armored convoy. Hannibal's commanding officer, General Morrison, consents to the operation but Face's former girlfriend, [[Defense Criminal Investigative Service]] [[Captain (armed forces)|Capt.]] Charissa Sosa, tries to discourage the team against getting the plates. The mission is successful, but when the team returns to base, both the money and Morrison's vehicle are destroyed by soldier [[List of The A-Team characters#Brock Pike|Brock Pike]] and his men from the [[Private military company|private security firm]] Black Forest. Without Morrison (the only proof that they were authorized to act), Hannibal, Face, Murdock, and BA are [[court-martialled]], sentenced to ten years in separate prisons, and [[Military discharge|dishonorably discharged]]. Because the plates were her responsibility, Sosa also ended up court-martialed and is demoted to lieutenant.\n\nSix months later, Lynch visits Hannibal in prison and tells him that Pike may be trying to sell the plates with the help of an Arab backer. Hannibal, who has been tracking Pike on his own, makes a deal with Lynch: full reinstatement and clean records for his team in return for the plates. Lynch agrees and Hannibal escapes, breaking out Face, BA, and Murdock in the process. The team hijacks a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]], which is later destroyed by [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|Reaper]] [[UCAV]]s, but not before the team parachutes away in an [[M8 Armored Gun System|M8]] tank stashed aboard and make it to the ground safely. The team moves to reclaim the plates and are able to kidnap Pike's backer. It is revealed that the backer is actually General Morrison in disguise, who plotted with Lynch and Pike to steal the plates but teamed up with Pike to double-cross Lynch and fake his death. Lynch orders an airstrike to kill the team and Morrison, but the team manages to escape while Morrison dies in the explosion.\n\nHannibal arranges to meet Sosa onboard a [[container ship]] at the Los Angeles Port, saying he will hand over \"Morrison\" and the plates. Face then calls Sosa on a drop phone he planted on her at a train station earlier, and conspires a different plan with her. It all unfolds according to plan until Pike, who is now working with Lynch, blows up the container ship with a [[bazooka]] and chases Face to near death. BA (having converted to Buddhism while in prison) finally gives up his pacifist ways and confronts Pike before breaking his neck and spinal cord, killing him and saving Face's life. Hannibal leads Lynch into a container with Murdock, who, wearing a covered bullet-proof helmet filled with ketchup, is portraying Morrison. Lynch shoots at Murdock's head, and believing that he has killed Morrison, is later tricked into admitting that he stole the plates and is subsequently caught and arrested by Sosa for his crimes.\n\nCIA agents led by a separate \"Lynch\" come and claim custody of the original one. Despite their success and proving themselves innocent, the military still arrests the team for escaping from prison, also a crime; they and Sosa are angered by this, since it is only being done so Sosa's boss does not have to fill out paperwork. Sosa's boss even tries to cover their tracks because of their screw up. Sosa is reinstated to captain, but she promises to do all she can to set the team free and kisses Face as everybody is led into a prison van.\n\nIn the van, the team starts saying that the system has burned them again, but Hannibal tells them that there is always a way out of any situation, and turns towards Face, who smiles and says \"I don't want to steal your line, boss, but... I love it when a plan comes together\" and opens his mouth, revealing a handcuff key given to him by Sosa through the kiss.\n\nThe final scene includes a narration (spoken by [[Corey Burton]]) similar to the show's opening narration.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of The A-Team characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[John \"Hannibal\" Smith]]\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Templeton Peck|Templeton \"Face\" Peck]]\n* [[Quinton Jackson|Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson]] as [[B.A. Baracus|Bosco \"B.A.\" Baracus]]\n* [[Sharlto Copley]] as [[Howling Mad Murdock|H.M. \"Howling Mad\" Murdock]]\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as [[List of The A-Team characters#Charissa Sosa|Charissa Sosa]] <!-- \"Charisa\" per the official website, \"Charissa\" per the closing credits of the movie --><ref>{{cite web | date = 2009-10-16 | first = Jocelyn | last = Vena | url = http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/10/16/exclusive-jessica-biel-reveals-new-details-about-her-a-team-character/ | title = EXCLUSIVE: Jessica Biel Reveals New Details About Her 'A-Team' Character | work = MTV Movies Blog | publisher = [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] }} (Video)</ref>\n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as [[List of The A-Team characters#Lynch|Vance Burress / Agent Lynch]]<ref name=\"hollywoodinsider\" />\n** [[Jon Hamm]] as [[List of The A-Team characters#Lynch|Other Lynch]] (''uncredited'')\n* [[Brian Bloom]] as [[List of The A-Team characters#Brock Pike|Brock Pike]].
