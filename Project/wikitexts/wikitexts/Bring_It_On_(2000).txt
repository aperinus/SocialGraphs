Her boyfriend, Aaron, is at college at [[California State University, Dominguez Hills|Cal State Dominguez Hills]], and her [[cheerleading]] squad, the Toros, is aiming for a sixth consecutive national title. Torrance is elected the next team captain, replacing her highly successful predecessor, \"Big Red\" after she graduates. In her first practice as captain, teammate Carver is injured and forced to sit the rest of the season out. Torrance holds auditions for a replacement and gains Missy Pantone, a skilled gymnast who transferred from [[Los Angeles]] with her twin brother, Cliff.\n\nWhile watching the Toros practice, Missy accuses them of plagiarizing their cheers, which Torrance vehemently denies. Missy takes her to L.A. to watch the [[East Rancho Dominguez, California|East Compton]] Clovers, a squad Missy's previous high school frequently competed against, who perform an identical routine. Isis, the Clovers captain, confronts the two and demands to know what they are doing there. She reveals that Big Red videotaped the Clovers' routines and stole them for the Toros. The Clovers vow to beat the Toros in the national competition, which they could not afford to attend in previous years, and prove that they are better cheerleaders. Torrance worries that she is cursed with bad luck after she dropped the Spirit Stick during a dare at cheer camp over the summer, an object that is never supposed to touch the ground. Meanwhile, Torrance and Cliff begin to get to know each other and a mutual attraction grows between them as Aaron becomes more distant.\n\nAfter Torrance informs the Toros about the routines, the team votes in favor of using the current routine to win. Torrance agrees feeling there is no time to learn a new routine, while Missy reluctantly goes along with it. At the Toros' next home game Isis and her teammates perform the Toros' routine in front of the whole school, humiliating them. After advice from Aaron, Torrance recruits the team to raise money through a car wash and hire choreographer Sparky Polastri. Polastri puts the whole team on a diet and regularly belittles them, but the team learns the routine in time for competition. At Regionals the team scheduled before the Toros performs Sparky\u2019s routine, embarrassing the team who perform the same routine with little choice. Torrance speaks to a competition official and learns their choreographer has provided the routine for six other teams. As the defending champions, the Toros are granted their place in nationals in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], but Torrance is warned that a new routine will be expected. Big Red chastises Torrance for her inability to be a leader, and says that if she made any mistake as a squad leader it was not stealing cheers but rather announcing Torrance as her successor. Crushed by Big Red's words and her failure to lead the squad successfully, Torrance considers quitting.\n\nAaron recommends that Torrance step down from her position as captain and considers to sell her out to her team rivals Courtney and Whitney. When Cliff sees Torrance and Aaron together kissing, he severs his friendship with her. Torrance breaks up with Aaron after confronting him about being distant and not believing in her, as well as catching him cheating. She uses Cliff's previous encouragement and his personally made mixtape for her as inspiration for the team to have a real original routine. When the Toros learn that the Clovers are unable to get the funds to pay for nationals, Torrance asks her father's company to sponsor the team; Isis refuses, calling it \"guilt money\". Instead the Clovers write to a local talk show host from their neighborhood and get the funds needed to go to Florida. At nationals, both the Toros and the Clovers make it to finals, with Cliff making a surprise appearance in the audience to cheer the team on. Torrance and Isis give each other last-minute advice. Ultimately, the Clovers come out victorious with the Toros coming in second. Despite their loss, the Toros and Clovers leave with a newfound respect for each other, with Isis complimenting Torrance on leading the squad and Torrance admitting the Clovers were deserving of their victory. As the Toros celebrate another successful season, Cliff and Torrance share a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Torrance Shipman\n* [[Eliza Dushku]] as Missy Pantone\n* [[Jesse Bradford]] as Cliff Pantone\n* [[Gabrielle Union]] as Isis\n* [[Clare Kramer]] as Courtney\n* [[Nicole Bilderback]] as Whitney\n* [[Tsianina Joelson]] as Darcy\n* [[Rini Bell]] as Kasey\n* [[Nathan West]] as Jan\n* Huntley Ritter as Les\n* [[Shamari Fears]] as Lava\n* [[Natina Reed]] as Jenelope\n* Brandi Williams as LaFred\n* Richard Hillman as Aaron\n* [[Lindsay Sloane]] as \"Big Red\"\n* [[Bianca Kajlich]] as Carver\n* Paige Inman as Jessica\n* Holmes Osborne as Bruce Shipman\n* [[Sherry Hursey]] as Christine Shipman\n* [[Cody McMains]] as Justin Shipman\n* [[Ian Roberts (American actor)|Ian Roberts]] as Sparky Polastri\n* [[Ryan Drummond]] as Theatre Boy\n* [[Peyton Reed]] cameos as a [[Mime artist|mime]] (credited as \"Silencio Por Favor\").\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[Jessica Bendinger]], a former journalist and music video director, originally pitched the idea for the film, then titled ''Cheer Fever'', as \"''[[Clueless]]'' meets ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'' set at the National High School Cheerleading Championships\", saying she was obsessed with cheerleading competitions on [[ESPN]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |last=Myers |first=Scott |date=November 24, 2020 |title=Go Into The Story interview: Jessica Bendinger |url=https://gointothestory.blcklst.com/go-into-the-story-interview-jessica-bendinger-c9e4184da936 |access-date=March 31, 2022 |website=The Black List blog |language=en}}</ref> Bendinger said the idea combined her love for [[hip hop music]] and [[cheerleading]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe film\u2019s depiction of [[cultural appropriation]] was informed by Bendinger's experiences as a white writer covering hip hop artists at music magazine ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', a predominantly white publication.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Scheetz |first=Cameron |date=August 25, 2020 |title=Bring It On at 20: The filmmakers revisit its most memorable scenes |url=https://www.avclub.com/from-deliverance-to-ani-difranco-bring-it-on-s-filmmak-1844791819 |access-date=April 3, 2022 |website=[[The A.V.
