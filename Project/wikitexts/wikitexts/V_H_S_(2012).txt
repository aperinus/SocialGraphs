In other [[Old Italic script|Italic alphabets]] (Venetic, Lepontic), the letter could be represented as a zig-zagging line of any number between three and six strokes.\n\nThe Italic letter was also adopted into [[Elder Futhark]], as ''[[Sowil\u014d]]'' ({{script|Runr|\u16ca}}), and appears with four to eight strokes in the earliest runic inscriptions, but is occasionally reduced to three strokes ({{script|Runr|\u16cb}}) from the later 5th century, and appears regularly with three strokes in [[Younger Futhark]].\n\n===Long s===\n[[File:Schw\u00e4bische Bastarda 1496 Schriftprobe Priesters Tochter.png|thumb|Late medieval German script (Swabian [[bastarda]], dated 1496) illustrating the use of long and round ''s'': ''prie\u017fters tochter'' (\"priest's daughter\").]]\n{{main|Long s}}\n\nThe [[lower case|minuscule form]]  \u017f, called the [[long s|long ''s'']], developed in the early medieval period, within the [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]] and [[Carolingian minuscule|Carolingian]] hands, with predecessors in the [[half-uncial]] and [[Roman cursive|cursive]] scripts of [[Late Antiquity]]. It remained standard in western writing throughout the medieval period and was adopted in early printing with movable types. \nIt existed alongside minuscule \"round\" or \"short\" ''s'', which was at the time only used at the end of words.\n\nIn most Western orthographies, the \u017f gradually fell out of use during the second half of the 18th century, although it remained in occasional use into the 19th century.\nIn Spain, the change was mainly accomplished between 1760 and 1766. In France, the change occurred between 1782 and 1793. Printers in the United States stopped using the long ''s'' between 1795 and 1810. In English orthography, the London printer [[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]] (1745\u20131831) pioneered the change. His edition of Shakespeare, in 1785, was advertised with the claim that he \"ventured to depart from the common mode by rejecting the long '\u017f' in favor of the round one, as being less liable to error.....\"<ref>Stanley Morison, ''A Memoir of John Bell, 1745\u20131831'' (1930, Cambridge Univ.
