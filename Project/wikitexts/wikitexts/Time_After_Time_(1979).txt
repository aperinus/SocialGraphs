Filmed in [[Panavision]], it was the directing debut of Meyer, whose screenplay is based on the premise from [[Karl Alexander (writer)|Karl Alexander]]'s novel ''[[Time After Time (Alexander novel)|Time After Time]]'' (which was unfinished at the time) and a story by Alexander and Steve Hayes. The film presents a story in which British author [[H. G. Wells]] uses his [[Time travel|time machine]] to pursue [[Jack the Ripper]] into the 20th century.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1893 [[London]], popular writer Herbert George Wells displays a [[time travel|time machine]] to his skeptical dinner guests. After he explains how it works (including a \"non-return key\" that keeps the machine at the traveler's destination and a \"vaporizing equalizer\" that keeps the traveler and machine on equal terms), police constables  arrive at the house searching for [[Jack the Ripper]]. A bag with blood-stained gloves belonging to one of Herbert's friends, a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson, leads them to conclude that Stevenson might be the infamous killer. Wells races to his laboratory, but the time machine is gone.\n\nStevenson has escaped to the future, but because he does not have the \"non-return\" key, the machine automatically returns to 1893. Herbert uses it to pursue Stevenson to November 5, 1979, where the machine has ended up on display at a museum in [[San Francisco]]. He is deeply shocked by the future, having expected it to be an enlightened [[Socialism|socialist]] [[utopia]], only to find chaos in the form of [[airplane]]s, [[automobile]]s and a worldwide history of war, crime and bloodshed.\n\nAt an antique shop, Herbert exchanges some British bank notes for present day American money. Growing hungry after a day without food, he enters a [[McDonald's]] and is alternately puzzled and pleased with 1979 dining options, noting the similarity between 1890s pommes frites from France and modern French fries. Wells is still ruffled by the idea of dining without tableware.\n\nReasoning that Stevenson would also need to exchange his British money, Herbert asks about him at various banks. At the [[Chartered Bank of London]], he meets employee Amy Robbins, who says she had directed Stevenson to a local hotel.\n\nConfronted by his one-time friend Herbert, Stevenson confesses that he finds modern society to be pleasingly violent, stating: \"Ninety years ago, I was a freak. Today, I'm an amateur.\"\n\nHerbert demands he return to 1893 to face justice, but Stevenson instead attempts to wrestle the time machine's key from him. Their struggle is interrupted by a maid and Stevenson flees, getting hit by a car during the frantic chase. Herbert follows him to the hospital emergency room and mistakenly gets the impression that Stevenson has died from his injuries.\n\nHerbert meets up with Amy Robbins again and she initiates a romance. Stevenson returns to the bank to exchange more money. Suspecting that it was Amy who had led Herbert to him, he finds out where she lives.\n\nHerbert, hoping to convince her of the truth, takes a highly skeptical Amy three days into the future. Once there, she is aghast to see a newspaper headline revealing her own murder as the Ripper's fifth victim.\n\nHerbert persuades her that they must go back \u2013 it is their duty to attempt to prevent the fourth victim's murder, then prevent Amy's. However, they are delayed upon their return to the present and can do no more than phone the police. Stevenson kills again, and Herbert is arrested because of his knowledge of the killing. Amy is left alone, totally defenseless, and at the mercy of the \"San Francisco Ripper\".\n\nWhile Herbert unsuccessfully tries to convince the police of Amy's peril, she attempts to hide from Stevenson. When the police finally do investigate her apartment, they find the dismembered body of a woman. Now convinced of Herbert's innocence, the police release a now-heartbroken Wells. However, he is contacted by Stevenson, who had actually killed Amy's coworker (revealed to be the dead body in Amy's apartment) and taken Amy hostage in order to extort the time machine key from Wells.\n\nStevenson flees with the key \u2013 and Amy as insurance \u2013 to attempt a permanent escape in the time machine. Using Amy's car, driving the unfamiliar machine erratically, Herbert manages to follow them back to the museum. While Herbert bargains for Amy's life, she is able to escape. As Stevenson starts up the time machine, Herbert removes the \"vaporizing equalizer\" from it, causing Stevenson to vanish while the machine does not. As Herbert had explained earlier, this causes the machine to remain in place while its passenger is sent traveling endlessly through time with no way to stop; in effect, he is destroyed.\n\nHerbert proclaims that the time has come to return to his own time, in order to destroy a machine that he now knows is too dangerous for primitive mankind. Amy pleads with him to take her along, explaining she has no remaining ties in the 20th century. The film ends with the caption: \"H.G. Wells married Amy Catherine Robbins, who died in 1927. As a writer, he anticipated socialism, global war, space travel, and women's liberation. He died in 1946.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[H. G.

Mitchell\n* [[Kent Williams (actor)|Kent Williams]] as assistant\n* [[Patti D'Arbanville]] as Shirley\n* [[Joseph Maher]] as Adams\n\n==Production==\nAccording to Meyer from the commentary track for the DVD and Blu-ray release of the film, the author of the novel presented Meyer with 55 pages of his unpublished novel and asked Meyer to critique his work. Meyer liked the premise and immediately optioned the story so he could write a screenplay based on the material and develop the story his own way.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[Nicholas Meyer]] |year=2002 | title=''Time After Time'' audio commentary |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref>\n\nMcDowell was attracted to the material because he was looking for something different from the sex and violence in ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'', in which he played the title character.<ref name=\"MalcolmDVD\">{{cite AV media |people=[[Malcolm McDowell]] |year=2002 |title=''Time After Time'' audio commentary |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Home Video}}</ref>\n\nWhile preparing to portray Wells, McDowell obtained a copy of a 78 rpm recording of Wells speaking. McDowell was \"absolutely horrified\" to hear that Wells spoke in a high-pitched, squeaky voice with a pronounced [[East End of London|Southeast London]] accent, which McDowell felt would have resulted in unintentional humor if he tried to mimic it for the film. McDowell abandoned any attempt to recreate Wells's authentic speaking style and preferred a more \"dignified\" style.<ref name=\"MalcolmDVD\"/>\n\nAccording to David Warner, the studio wanted [[Mick Jagger]] for the role of John Leslie Stevenson but director Nicholas Meyer and producer Herb Jaffe fought for Warner to get the role.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://film.avclub.com/david-warner-on-twin-peaks-tron-titanic-time-bandits-1798265384 |title=David Warner on Twin Peaks, Tron, Titanic, Time Bandits, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II |last=Harris |first=Will |date=2017-07-26 |website=[[The A.V.

On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on 31 reviews.

She continued:{{blockquote|Mr. Meyer isn't a particularly skilled director; this is his first attempt, and on occasion it's very clumsy. But as a whizkid he's gone straight to the head of the class, with a movie that's as sweet as it is clever, and never so clever that it forgets to be entertaining. The satisfactions ''Time After Time'' offers are perhaps no more sophisticated than the fun one might have with an intricate set of electric trains. Still, fun of this sort isn't always easy to come by, not after one's age has climbed up into two digits. There's a lot to be said for an adult's movie with the shimmer of a child's new toy.<ref>{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Maslin |title=Screen: H.G.
