It is the first installment in ''The Art of War'' film series.  The film's title refers to the ancient Chinese [[The Art of War|text of the same name]] by war [[Military strategy|strategist]] [[Sun Tzu]]. The film was followed by two [[direct-to-video]] [[sequels]], ''[[The Art of War II: Betrayal]]'' and ''[[The Art of War III: Retribution]]''. The latter did not feature Snipes.\n\n==Plot==\nNeil Shaw is an [[Operative Professional|operative]] for the [[United Nations]]'s covert SAD, using espionage and quasi-ethical tactics to secure peace and cooperation. In Hong Kong, Shaw infiltrates a [[Chinese New Year]] party held by Chinese business mogul David Chan and covertly hacks an office laptop of a [[North Korea]]n Defense Minister, and blackmails him with the misappropriation of U.N. [[foreign aid|aid money]], in exchange for continuing negotiations with [[South Korea]]. Shortly after being discovered, Shaw fights his way out of the party and suffers a gunshot wound to his shoulder during extraction.\n\nSix months later, a shipping container full of dead [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] refugees from Hong Kong turns up on the New York docks on the week as [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s trade agreement with the U.S. Shaw's boss, Eleanor Hooks, suspects Chinese ambassador Wu's connection with the Chinese [[Triad society|Triad]], and assigns Shaw to plant a [[tracking device|bug]] on Wu during a banquet held by Chan. During the trade agreement banquet, Wu is gunned down, Chan is shot in the arm, and Shaw pursues a masked gunman. During the pursuit, Shaw's teammate Robert Bly corners the gunman but perishes, and Shaw is arrested by the [[NYPD]].  In the middle of a prison transfer, FBI agent Frank Capella's van is disabled by a roadside bomb, and an unconscious Shaw is captured by Triad members to be framed for the murder and disposed of. Shaw regains consciousness and frees himself from captivity, only to find his last remaining team member, Jenna Novak, murdered by a Chinese hitman. Shaw kills the hitman, recovers the audio file, and secures weapons and equipment from Novak's hidden armory.  Shaw seeks out Julia Fang's help after reading a news article stating Shaw's innocence. Shaw manages to save Fang from an ambush by a Chinese hitwoman at a hospital.\n\nWith Fang's aid, Shaw finds a Triad-owned bakery serving as a front for a Gentleman's club, setting up an unlikely alliance with Capella, as well as retrieving video footage of Chan's role in derailing the trade agreement.  Fang delivers the evidence to Hooks while Shaw confronts Chan at the same hotel serving as the banquet. Chan is shot dead by a masked gunman while being interrogated by Shaw. The pursuit ends when Shaw finds a scanner that is tuned to a tracking device embedded in Shaw's gunshot wound before being ambushed by Bly. Bly reveals himself as the assassin at the banquet, and also engineered the tracking device implant from an earlier basketball game injury. Hooks reviews the evidence and reveals that she and Chan were the masterminds behind the conspiracy. A disgusted Fang tries to leave but attempts to hide from Bly only to be locked in a bathroom.\n\nShaw eventually figures out Hooks's role behind the conspiracy and approaches Capella with his findings. Shaw surgically removes his tracking device and uses Capella's business card to give the Triads a business proposition. Shaw breaks into the U.N. building and enters into a shootout and hand-to-hand fight with Bly, where the latter dies after falling on a shard from a broken glass pane. The following day, Shaw calls Hooks in her limousine and lectures her on a lesson in [[karma]], revealing that Shaw's business proposition to the Triads was to assassinate Hooks for her betrayal. Shaw later has his death faked before reuniting with Fang in France but is monitored by an unknown spy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as SAD Agent Neil Shaw\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as UN Secretary-General Douglas Thomas\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as FBI Agent Frank Capella\n* [[Anne Archer]] as Eleanor Hooks\n* [[Marie Matiko]] as Julia Fang\n* [[Ron Yuan]] as Ming\n* [[Michael Biehn]] as SAD Agent Robert Bly\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as David Chan\n* [[Liliana Komorowska]] as SAD Agent Jenna Novak\n* [[James Hong]] as Ambassador Wu\n* [[Paul Hopkins (actor)|Paul Hopkins]] as FBI Agent Ray\n* [[Glen Chin]] as Defense Minister General Ochai\n* Bonnie Mak as Anna Li\n* Uni Park as Tina Chan\n* [[Fernando Chien]] as Zeng Zi\n* Paul Wu as \"Shades\"\n* Noel Burton as Alex Wingate\n* Mike Tsar as NYPD Lieutenant \n* Steven P.
