Before leaving on a business trip to [[Tokyo]], Mark's father Jack transports him from [[Arizona]] to his Uncle Wallace and Aunt Susan's house in [[Maine]], where he will stay during winter break. Mark is reintroduced after a decade to his extended family, including his cousins Connie and Henry. Mark and Henry get along initially and Henry seems to be nice and well-mannered. However, Henry displays an abnormal fascination with death, making Mark feel uneasy.\n\nHenry begins to display psychopathic behavior, which Mark is unable to address to Wallace and Susan due to Henry's threats. One of his violent actions is throwing a dummy off a bridge onto a highway, causing a massive vehicle pileup; he then plans to kill Connie. Afraid something might happen to her, Mark spends the night in her room. The next morning, Mark awakens to find Henry has taken Connie ice skating. At the pond, Henry purposely throws her towards thin ice, which collapses. Connie is rescued, but ends up in a coma. Despite not believing Mark initially, Susan becomes suspicious and interrupts Henry's attempt to suffocate Connie in her hospital bed. Susan then finds a rubber duck Henry has hidden in his shed\u2014it had once belonged to Henry's younger brother, Richard, and had been with him in the bathtub the night he drowned; the duck went missing after. When Susan confronts Henry, he coldly reminds her that the toy had belonged to him first. He then flips and kindly asks for the rubber duck back. After a violent tug-of-war, he takes the toy and throws it down the well.\n\nAs Susan and Mark grow closer, Henry insinuates he will kill Susan rather than let Mark continue to develop a relationship with her. When a fight breaks out between the two boys, Wallace locks Mark in the den. Henry asks a suspicious Susan to go for a walk with him, while Mark escapes and chases after them. Susan confronts Henry, asking him if he killed Richard, to which Henry sarcastically replies, \"What if I did?\" Realizing that Mark was right about her son's true nature, Susan tells Henry that he needs help, but he refuses and flees. Susan gives chase and upon arriving at a cliff, Henry pushes her over the edge. Susan gets caught onto a branch just before the sheer drop. As Susan dangles, Henry picks up a large rock about to drop on her, but Mark tackles him. Susan manages to climb back up just in time to grab hold of the boys as they roll over the edge, one in each hand. Henry holds on with both hands but Mark's one-handed grip begins to slip. With only enough strength to save one of them, Susan reluctantly releases Henry and he falls to his death. Susan pulls Mark up and they look down as Henry's corpse is washed away into the ocean.\n\nWhen Mark returns home to Arizona, he reflects upon Susan's choice to save him instead of Henry. He wonders if she would make the same choice again, but knows it is something he will never ask her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Mark Evans\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Henry Evans\n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as Susan Evans\n* [[David Morse]] as Jack Evans\n* [[Daniel Hugh Kelly]] as Wallace Evans\n* [[Jacqueline Brookes]] as Alice Davenport\n* Quinn Culkin as Connie Evans\n* [[Ashley Crow]] as Janice Evans\n* [[Rory Culkin]] as Richard Evans (pictured only)\n* Guy Strauss as Arizona Doctor\n* Keith Brava as Doctor in Blackport\n* Jerem Goodwin as Factory Worker\n* Andria Hall as Woman Reporter\n* Bobby Huber as Axe Man\n* Mark Stefanich as Ice Man\n* Susan Hopper as Woman at Rescue\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nFollowing the completion of his novel ''[[The Child in Time]]'', English novelist [[Ian McEwan]] was invited by 20th Century Fox to write a screenplay \"about evil \u2013 possibly concerning children.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> McEwan recalled, \"The idea was to make a low budget, high class movie, not something that Fox would naturally make a lot of money on.\" Despite being well received, the end result was deemed insufficiently commercial by the parties that commissioned it and it floated around Hollywood until being discovered by independent producer Mary Ann Page. Enthusiastic about the script, which was originally sent to her as a writing sample, Page tried to get the project off the ground for three and a half years.<ref name=\":0\" /> The film was briefly set up at [[Universal Studios]], during which [[Brian Gilbert (director)|Brian Gilbert]] was attached as director. In 1988, [[Michael Klesic]] was originally cast in the role of Henry Evans. The film was soon after put on hold due to a lack of funding.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing the successes of ''[[Home Alone]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', which demonstrated the box-office appeal of a movie about kids and of an \"extreme thriller\" respectively, Fox itself chose to revisit the project, which they now saw as viable. Director [[Michael Lehmann]] (''[[Heathers]]'') became attached, [[Laurence Mark]] was appointed as a co-producer and McEwan was called in for rewrites. [[Mary Steenburgen]] was cast as Susan and [[Jesse Bradford]] had replaced Klesic as Henry because he had grown too old to play the part.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news |last=Linfield |first=Susie |date=November 5, 1995 |title=Trouble in the House THAT Mac Built |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-11-05-tm-64948-story.html |access-date=August 7, 2022}}</ref> McEwan was optimistic about the project and by November 1991, sets were being built in Maine for a production that would cost approximately $12 million.

Fox agreed enthusiastically due to Culkin's bankability.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAs the movie was originally scheduled to shoot at the same time as ''Home Alone 2'', the start date for ''The Good Son'' was pushed back for a year, making Steenburgen no longer available and having her replaced by [[Wendy Crewson]] but also enabling [[Elijah Wood]]'s involvement. Director Lehmann and producer Mark conflicted with the imposition, leading both to leave the project. The demanding Culkin would go on to insist that Macaulay's sister, Quinn, receive a role in the film and vetted replacement director [[Joseph Ruben]] (''[[Sleeping with the Enemy]]'').<ref name=\":1\" /> Furthermore, the budget had risen to an estimated $20 million.<ref name=\":1\" /> McEwan found himself performing further rewrites that continued to simplify the story to satisfy Ruben's comparatively mainstream tastes and was ultimately unceremoniously removed from the project altogether when another screenwriter, Ruben's frequent collaborator [[David Loughery]], was commissioned. Despite this, McEwan was awarded sole writing credit in [[arbitration]] when he contested a shared credit.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news |last=Durrant |first=Sabine |date=1993-08-19 |title=FILM / 'I thought nothing could possibly go wrong.

In the novel, Henry's mother Susan eventually discovers that Henry is unable to understand emotions like love and sorrow, and that pleasure derived from selfish actions and the torment of others are the few things he truly feels. The book also concludes differently from the movie, ending with Mark returning to Uncle Wallace's home in Maine one year later.
