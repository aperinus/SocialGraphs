Brando portrays the lead character Rio, and [[Karl Malden]] plays his partner, \"Dad\" Longworth. The supporting cast features [[Pina Pellicer]], [[Katy Jurado]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] and [[Slim Pickens]].\n\nIn 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jurassic-park-the-shining-my-fair-lady-2018-additions-to-library-of-congress-national-film-registry/|title='\"Jurassic Park,\" \"The Shining,\" \"My Fair Lady\" among latest additions to National Film Registry|website=CBS News|date=December 12, 2018|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = \n | header    =  \n | image1    = One-Eyed Jacks 1961 (15).jpg\n | caption1  =  \n | image2    = One-Eyed Jacks 1961 (11).jpg\n | caption2  = [[Pina Pellicer]] with [[Marlon Brando]] (top) and [[Katy Jurado]] (bottom)\n}}\nRio, his mentor Dad Longworth, and a third man called Doc rob a bank of two saddlebags of gold in [[Sonora, Mexico]] in 1880. Mexican ''[[rurales]]'' (mounted police) catch them celebrating in a cantina and kill Doc. Dad and Rio escape, but Dad leaves Rio to be taken by the ''rurales''. Rio is arrested and spends five hard years in a Sonora prison. He escapes and travels to [[Monterey, California]], where Dad has become [[sheriff]]. Rio plans to kill Dad and rob the bank in Monterey with his new partners Chico Modesto and Bob Emory.\n\nPlans are sidetracked when Rio falls in love with Dad's beautiful stepdaughter, Louisa. Rio takes advantage of a ''fiesta'' (festival) to spend the night with her on the beach. Dad tries to punish Louisa for what happened, but backs down after intervention by his wife, Maria. Instead, he traps Rio, whips him in public, and smashes his gun hand to make sure Rio will never be able to beat him in a gunfight. While recovering from his wounds, Rio struggles with his conflicting desires to love the girl and to get revenge on her stepfather. He decides to forgo vengeance, fetch Louisa, and leave town.\n\nEmory and a partner kill Chico and pull off the bank job without Rio's knowledge. The heist goes wrong and a young girl is killed. Dad accuses Rio of the crime. Dad has one last private talk with Rio, again attempting to absolve himself for all he has done. Rio replies, \"You're a one-eyed jack around here, Dad, but I've seen the other side of your face\". Rio tells him he had been imprisoned for the last five years, but Dad calls it a lie.\n\n[[File:One-Eyed Jacks 1961 (1).jpg|thumb|Louisa (Pina Pellicer) visits Rio (Marlon Brando) in jail]]\nLouisa visits Rio in jail to tell him she is going to have his baby. He is then beaten by sadistic deputy Lon Dedrick, who desired and has been denied Louisa's affection. Maria confronts Dad and insists on being told the truth about the relationship between him and Rio, stating she knew something was wrong since the moment Rio arrived. She says she knows Dad wants to hang him purely out of guilt. Dad tells her she has no appreciation for everything he has done for her.\n\nLouisa attempts to smuggle a [[Derringer]] to Rio, but she is discovered by Dedrick, who carries her out of the jail, leaving the gun on a table. While they are out, Rio is able to get hold of the pistol. Pointing the unloaded gun at Dedrick when he returns, Rio bluffs his way out of jail in a tense confrontation. Rio takes Dedrick's revolver, beats him unconscious, and locks him in a cell. As Rio is making his escape, he is spotted by Dad, riding into town. Under fire, in the final showdown Rio shoots Dad dead.\n\nRio and Louisa ride out to the dunes and say a sentimental farewell. Now a hunted man, Rio tells Louisa that he might go to [[Oregon]], but will return for her in the spring.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Rio\n* [[Pina Pellicer]] as Louisa Longworth\n* [[Karl Malden]] as Dad Longworth\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Bob Emory\n* [[Katy Jurado]] as Maria Longworth\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Lon Dedrick\n* [[Larry Duran]] as Chico Modesto\n* [[Sam Gilman]] as Harvey Johnson\n* [[Timothy Carey]] as Howard Tetley\n* [[M\u00edriam Col\u00f3n]] as Redhead\n* [[Elisha Cook Jr.]] as Carvey\n* [[Rodolfo Acosta]] as Mexican Rurale Captain\n* Tom Webb as Farmer's Son\n* [[Ray Teal]] as Barney\n* [[John Dierkes]] as Chet\n* [[Philip Ahn]] as Uncle\n* [[Margarita Cordova]] as Nika, Flamenco Dancer\n* [[Hank Worden]] as Doc\n}}\n\n==Adaptation and development==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2014}}\n[[Rod Serling]], creator of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' television series, wrote an adaptation of the 1956 novel ''The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones'' by [[Charles Neider]], at the request of producer Frank P. Rosenberg. The book was a fictional treatment of the familiar [[Billy the Kid]] story, relocated from [[New Mexico]] to the [[Monterey Peninsula]] in [[California]]. The adaptation was rejected.\n\nRosenberg next hired [[Sam Peckinpah]], who finished his first script on 11 November 1957. Marlon Brando's Pennebaker Productions had paid $40,000 for the rights to ''Authentic Death'' and then signed a contract with [[Stanley Kubrick]] to direct for [[Paramount Pictures]]. Peckinpah handed in a revised screenplay on 6 May 1959. Brando later fired Peckinpah and hired [[Calder Willingham]] to further revise the film's script, but he too was eventually fired. [[Guy Trosper]] was brought on as a final replacement. Additionally, Stanley Kubrick\u2014for unknown reasons\u2014stepped down from directing the film just two weeks before starting production.<ref name=\"1966 Kubrick Interview by Jeremy Bernstein\">{{cite web |last1=Bernstein |first1=Jeremy |title=Stanley Kubrick 1966 Interview |url=https://youtube.com/OQOMNF27kLg?t=2432 |website=YouTube |access-date=25 January 2019}}</ref> Brando volunteered to direct in his stead.\n\nThe movie ultimately bore little resemblance to the Neider novel, and what remains has much more resonance with history than fiction. At various times, the two credited screenwriters and the uncredited Peckinpah have claimed (or had claimed for them) a majority of the responsibility for the film. When [[Karl Malden]] was asked who really wrote the story, he said: \"There is one answer to your question\u2014Marlon Brando, a genius in our time.\"<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.towntopics.com/jul0809/book.php| title= Karl Malden and Marlon Brando in One-Eyed Jacks: \"We Had the Very Best of Each Other\"| first=Stuart|last= Mitchner| date= July 8, 2009| publisher= [[Town Topics (newspaper)|Town Topics]]| location= Princeton, New Jersey | access-date=2014-02-16}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Pina Pellicer and Marlon Brando publicity photo (1961).jpg|thumb|Pina Pellicer and Marlon Brando behind the scenes of the film]]\nThe film was [[Paramount Pictures]]' last feature released in [[VistaVision]]. Cinematographer [[Charles Lang]] received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination in the Best Cinematography, Color category that year. Upon release, it made little money, leading to a string of unsuccessful films for Brando.\n\nMarlon Brando shot a total of five hours of additional footage, some of which was later destroyed. Later, other directors worked on the rest of the film after Brando walked away from the production.<ref name=\"tcmart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/88922%7c0/One-Eyed-Jacks.html |title=One-Eyed Jacks |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=2014-02-16}}</ref> He did not direct another film in his later years, but he did continue to act. In a 1975 ''Rolling Stone'' interview Brando said of directing, \"You work yourself to death. You're the first one up in the morning...
