It was originally supposed to be a [[sequel]] to ''[[The Young Master]]'' and even had the name ''Young Master in Love'' until it was changed to ''Dragon Lord''. The film was experimented by Chan with various elaborate [[stunt]] action sequences in a period setting, serving as a transition between Chan's earlier [[kung fu film|kung fu]] comedy [[period film]]s (such as ''[[Drunken Master]]'' and ''The Young Master'') and his later stunt-oriented modern action films (such as ''[[Project A (film)|Project A]]'' and ''[[Police Story (film series)|Police Story]]'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Dragon Lord|publisher=Love HK Film|url=http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/dragon_lord.htm|access-date=2011-04-14}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDragon ([[Jackie Chan]]) is the son of a Chinese aristocrat who is always getting in trouble, and likes to skip his lessons. \nDragon tries to send a love note to the girl he likes via a kite, but the kite gets away.
