It is the third and final installment in [[The Mighty Ducks (franchise)|''The Mighty Ducks'' trilogy]] and was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and distributed by [[Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/mighty-ducks/ |title=The 'Mighty Ducks' Trilogy: An Oral History |website=Time.com |date=2014-06-09 |access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[D2: The Mighty Ducks|After their victory at the Junior Goodwill Games]], youth ice-hockey team The Mighty Ducks and their captain Charlie Conway are awarded the junior varsity hockey scholarships to Eden Hall Academy, a prestigious [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Minneapolis]]-area prep school that Coach Bombay attended. Charlie struggles with his transition from childhood to adolescence; he thinks he was abandoned by Bombay when the latter informs him that he intends to take a job with the Junior Goodwill Games, which would leave him unable to coach the Ducks; one of the Ducks' enforcers, Dean Portman, also decided not to attend the school after hearing about Bombay's leaving and Jesse Hall also does not attend. Bombay informs Charlie prior to the start of classes that the team will be in good hands under the coaching of former NHL player Ted Orion.\n\nThe Ducks' start at the school begins inauspiciously; while the newer Ducks respectfully sit in at the headmaster's speech, the original teammates crash the ceremony on stage. The team then experiences many early struggles: playing in Coach Orion's new \"two-way hockey\" defensive style, Orion abandoning several Duck traditions and some of their youthful in-game 'trick' plays, losing Adam Banks who qualifies for Varsity, and off-ice conflicts with the Varsity team. The Ducks' struggles continue, culminating in a tie in their first game after having a huge lead. Eventually, when Coach Orion restricts the old Ducks uniform after an unsanctioned early morning match with the Varsity team to settle their differences, where Orion sternly declares \"The Ducks are dead.\", Charlie decides to leave the team to return to public schools and seek a hockey career. Fulton follows, but considers quitting hockey much to Charlie's dismay. Sometime later, he ultimately returns to the team without Charlie.\n\nAngry at Bombay's departure and at Orion's highly disciplined coaching style, Charlie's acting out alienates him from his mother, Hans (Gordon's old mentor and friend of the Ducks), and even his friends. Hans suddenly dies, and Bombay comes to Charlie's house the day after the funeral and takes him back to Eden Hall. He tells Charlie that Orion's career with the [[Minnesota North Stars]] ended when the team moved to [[Dallas Stars|Dallas]] and he stayed to care for his [[paraplegic]] daughter. Bombay tells Charlie [[The Mighty Ducks (film)|the background story on how he first came to coach the Ducks]] and says he told Orion that Charlie was the heart and soul of the team, and it was his hope that both Orion and Charlie would learn something from each other. Bombay also admits telling Orion that Charlie was the real \"Minnesota Miracle\" man. Emotionally touched by his words, finding new resolve, and feeling guilt-ridden over how he acted against Orion, Charlie agrees to rejoin the team.\n\nArriving at the team bus for the next game, Charlie tells Orion he wants to play \"two-way hockey\". Surprised but pleased, Coach Orion welcomes him back. Before they depart, Dean Buckley, the school's headmaster, informs the team that its board of trustees wants to revoke the Ducks' scholarships and offers Orion a chance to start anew with a team of his choice. Satisfied with the team, Orion balks at the news, threatening resignation. At a board meeting the following day, Bombay, who was an experienced lawyer before coaching the Ducks, acts as the Ducks' attorney and fights successfully for their case, threatening the board with an injunction and promising to win the resulting lawsuit if the board expels the Ducks, and the board reinstates the Duck's scholarships with much reluctance due to Bombay putting them in a no-win situation. The Varsity are furious that the Ducks won't be expelled, but agree to a wager with the Ducks regarding the JV-Varsity match: If the Warriors win, the Ducks are expelled, but if the Ducks win, the team name will be changed to the \"Mighty Ducks\".\n\nPrior to the annual JV\u2013Varsity game, Orion brings back the Duck jerseys, giving the team a renewed vigor. Throughout the game, the Varsity dominates on offense. However, the Ducks play good defense and manage to keep the game scoreless after two periods. During the second intermission, Dean Portman returns to the team (having finally accepted his scholarship), adding a needed spark. Late in the game, the Ducks get two penalties and must play 5 vs 3. During the time-out, Orion reinstates Charlie as captain and tells him to go for the win if the opportunity presents itself. With seconds left in the game, Charlie gets a breakaway and beats all the defensemen and goalie; he passes the puck back to Goldberg, now a defenseman, who scores into an wide-open net as time expires, securing a 1\u20130 victory for the Ducks.\n\nFollowing the victory, Charlie embraces Orion and spots Bombay who has attended the game, and they both look across the rink to a newly-presented Eden Hall banner with the Ducks' logo, as the Varsity lost the wager, leaving them to depart the ice in humiliated defeat. Bombay then departs the game amid a sea of cheering fans, with a smile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Gordon Bombay (Coach)\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Charlie Conway #96 (Player and 2nd Coach in Mighty Ducks 2)\n* [[Jeffrey Nordling]] as Coach Ted Orion (Eden Hall Warriors Coach for the Ducks)\n* [[David Selby]] as Dean Buckley (Eden Hall Warriors Dean)\n* Heidi Kling as Casey Conway (Charlie Conway's Mom)\n* Margot Finley as Linda (Charlie Conway's friend)\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as Hans (Gordon Bombay's friend and Sponsor)\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Fulton Reed #44 (1st Bash Brother and Player)\n* [[Shaun Weiss]] as Greg \"The Goalie\" Goldberg #33 (The Goalie)\n* [[Vincent Larusso]] as Adam Banks #99 (The Top Mighty Ducks Player)\n* [[Matt Doherty (actor)|Matt Doherty]] as Lester Averman #4 (Mighty Ducks Player)\n* [[Garette Ratliff Henson]] as Guy Germaine #00 (Mighty Ducks Player)\n* [[Marguerite Moreau]] as Connie Moreau #18 (Mighty Ducks Player)\n* [[Michael Cudlitz]] as Cole (Eden Hall Warriors Player and Bully)\n* Christopher Orr as Rick Riley (Eden Hall Warriors Player and Bully)\n* [[Aaron Lohr]] as Dean Portman #21 (Bash Brother 2 and Player)\n* [[Colombe Jacobsen]] as Julie \"The Cat\" Gaffney #6 (The Goalie)\n* [[Kenan Thompson]] as Russ Tyler #56 (Mighty Ducks Player)\n* [[Mike Vitar]] as Luis Mendoza #22 (Mighty Ducks Player)\n* [[Ty O'Neal]] as Dwayne Robertson #7 (Mighty Ducks Player)\n* Justin Wong as Ken Wu #16 (Mighty Ducks Player)\n* [[Scott Whyte]] as Scott \"Scooter\" Holland (Eden Hall Warriors Player)\n* [[Benjamin Salisbury]] as Josh, the sports announcer (Announcer)\n}}\n\n===Cameo appearance===\n[[Paul Kariya]], captain of the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (now Anaheim Ducks)]] when the film was released, makes a cameo appearance during the second intermission of the Ducks/Varsity Warriors game.\n\n===Departure===\n[[Brandon Quintin Adams|Brandon Adams]], who played Jesse Hall, is the only actor from the previous films to not reprise his role as a Duck, after appearing in the first two films of the trilogy.
