It is the eighth film in the [[List of James Bond films|''James Bond'' series]] produced by [[Eon Productions]], and the first to star [[Roger Moore]] as the fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]]. It was directed by [[Guy Hamilton]] and produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], while [[Tom Mankiewicz]] wrote the script. Although the producers had approached [[Sean Connery]] to return after ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971), he declined and a search for a new actor led to Moore being signed.\n\nThe film is based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1954 [[Live and Let Die (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The storyline involves a Harlem [[drug lord]] known as Mr. Big who plans to distribute two tons of [[heroin]] for free to put rival drug barons out of business and then become a monopoly supplier. Mr. Big is revealed to be the alter ego of Dr. Kananga, a corrupt [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] dictator, who rules San Monique, a fictional island where opium [[Poppy|poppies]] are secretly farmed. Bond is investigating the deaths of three British agents, leading him to Kananga, and he is soon trapped in a world of gangsters and [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] as he fights to put a stop to the drug baron's scheme.\n\n''Live and Let Die'' was released during the height of the [[blaxploitation|blaxploitation era]], and many blaxploitation [[archetype]]s and clich\u00e9s are depicted in the film, including derogatory racial epithets (\"[[honky]]\"), black gangsters, and [[pimpmobile]]s.<ref name=\"booklet\" /> It departs from the former plots of the James Bond films about [[Narcissistic personality disorder|megalomaniac]] super-villains, and instead focuses on [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]], a common theme of blaxploitation films of the period. It is set in African-American cultural centres such as [[Harlem]] and [[New Orleans]], as well as the [[List of Caribbean islands|Caribbean Islands]]. It was also the first James Bond film featuring an African-American [[Bond girl]] romantically involved with 007, [[Bond girl#Eon Productions films|Rosie Carver]], who was played by [[Gloria Hendry]].\n\nThe film was a box-office success and received generally positive reviews from critics. Its [[Live and Let Die (song)|title song]], written by [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Linda McCartney]] and performed by their band [[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]], was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. The plot summary is recommended to be 400-700 words. -->\nThree MI6 agents are killed under mysterious circumstances within 24 hours in the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations headquarters in New York City]], in [[New Orleans]], and the small [[Caribbean]] nation of San Monique, while monitoring the operations of the island's dictator, Dr. Kananga. James Bond, Agent 007, is sent to New York to investigate. Kananga is also in New York, visiting the United Nations. After Bond arrives, his driver is shot dead by Whisper, one of Kananga's men, while taking Bond to [[Felix Leiter]] of the CIA. Bond is nearly killed in the ensuing car crash.\n[[File:007Glastonspeedboats.jpg|thumb|left|[[Glastron]] speedboats in the Louisiana boat chase. The boat chase scene was filmed in the Bayou Des Allemands.]]\nThe killer's licence plate leads Bond to [[Harlem]] where he meets Mr. Big, a mob boss who runs a chain of restaurants throughout the United States, but he and the CIA do not understand why the most powerful black gangster in New York works with an unimportant island's leader. Bond meets [[Solitaire (James Bond)|Solitaire]], a beautiful [[tarot reader]] who has the power of the [[Obeah]] and can see both the future and remote events in the present. Mr. Big demands that his henchmen kill Bond, but Bond overpowers them and escapes with the help of CIA agent Strutter. Bond flies to San Monique, where he meets Rosie Carver, a local CIA agent. They meet up with Bond's ally, [[List of James Bond allies#Quarrel|Quarrel Jr.]], who takes them by boat near Solitaire's home. When Bond suspects Rosie of being a [[double agent]] for Kananga, Rosie tries to escape but is killed remotely by Kananga. Bond then uses a [[stacked deck]] of tarot cards that show only \"[[The Lovers]]\" to trick Solitaire into thinking that fate is meant for them; Bond then seduces her. Having lost her virginity and thus her ability to foretell the future, Solitaire realizes she would be killed by Kananga, so she agrees to cooperate with Bond.\n\nBond and Solitaire escape by boat and fly to New Orleans. There, Bond is captured by Mr. Big, who removes his [[Facial prosthetic|prosthetic face]] and reveals himself to be Kananga. He has been producing heroin and is protecting the poppy fields by exploiting the San Monique locals' fear of voodoo priest Baron Samedi, as well as the [[occult]]. As Mr. Big, Kananga plans to distribute the heroin free of charge at his restaurants, which will increase the number of addicts. He intends to bankrupt other drug dealers with his giveaway, then charge high prices for his heroin later in order to capitalise on the huge drug dependencies he has cultivated.\n\nAngry at her for having sex with Bond and that her ability to read tarot cards is now gone, Kananga turns Solitaire over to Baron Samedi to be sacrificed. Kananga's henchmen, one-armed Tee Hee and tweed-jacketed Adam, leave Bond to be eaten by [[crocodilia]]ns at his [[Crocodile farm|farm]] in the [[Deep South]] backwoods. Bond escapes by running along the animals' backs to safety. After setting the drug laboratory on fire, he steals a speedboat and escapes, pursued by Kananga's men under Adam's order, as well as [[List of James Bond allies#Sheriff J.W. Pepper|Sheriff J.W. Pepper]] and the [[Louisiana State Police]]. Most pursuers get wrecked or left behind, and Adam is killed in a boat crash by Bond.\n\nBond travels to San Monique and sets timed explosives throughout the poppy fields. He rescues Solitaire from the voodoo sacrifice and throws Samedi into a coffin of venomous snakes. Bond and Solitaire escape below ground into Kananga's lair. Kananga captures them both and proceeds to lower them into a shark tank. However, Bond escapes and forces Kananga to swallow a compressed-gas pellet used in shark guns, causing his body to inflate and explode.\n\nLeiter puts Bond and Solitaire on a train leaving the country. Tee Hee sneaks aboard and attempts to kill Bond, but Bond cuts the wires of his prosthetic arm and throws him out the window. As the film ends, a laughing Samedi is revealed to be perching at the front of the train.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:LALDcast.jpg|thumb|right|Promotional image of the cast of ''Live and Let Die''.

Hamilton did not want to use [[Mardi Gras]] since ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965) featured [[Junkanoo]], a similar festivity, so after more discussions with the writer and [[location scouting]] with helicopters, he decided to use two well-known features of the city, the [[jazz funeral]]s and the canals.<ref name=\"inside\" /><ref name=\"doc73\">{{Cite AV media |title=Bond 1973: The Lost Documentary |year=2000 |publisher=MGM/UA Home Video |medium=DVD |id=ASIN: B000LY209E}}</ref>\n\nTo develop a better feel of how Voodoo was practised, Saltzman and Broccoli escorted Hamilton, Mankiewicz, and production designer Syd Cain to scout New Orleans further and then the islands of the West Indies.

The farm was put into the script and also inspired Mankiewicz to name the film's villain after Kananga.<ref name=\"inside\" />\n\n[[Richard Maibaum]] later claimed he was asked to write the film, but declined, because he was too busy.

The main frontrunner for the role was [[Michael Billington (actor)|Michael Billington]].

Billington played a brief role in the pre-credit sequence of ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977). Moore tried not to imitate either Connery's or his own prior performance as [[The Saint (Simon Templar)|Simon Templar]] in ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'', and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore's persona by giving more comedic scenes and a light-hearted approach to Bond.<ref name=\"inside\" />\n\nMankiewicz had thought of turning Solitaire into a Black woman, and [[Diana Ross]] was his first choice.<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Inside Live and Let Die |type=booklet |year=2000 |publisher=MGM/UA Home Video}}</ref><ref name=\"tom\">{{cite book|first1=Tom|last1=Mankiewicz|author-link1=Tom Mankiewicz|first2=Robert|last2=Crane|title=My Life as a Mankiewicz: An Insider's Journey through Hollywood|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|year=2012|page=155|isbn=978-0-8131-6123-5}}</ref> Broccoli and Saltzman decided to stick to Fleming's description of a white woman and, after considering [[Catherine Deneuve]], cast [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], who was in the television series ''[[The Onedin Line]]''.<ref name=\"inside\" /> After Solitaire was cast with a white actress, the character of Rosie Carver was switched to be a Black woman and cast with [[Gloria Hendry]].{{sfn|Field|Chowdhury|2015|p=239}} [[Yaphet Kotto]] was cast while doing another movie for [[United Artists]], ''[[Across 110th Street]]'' (1972).<ref name=\"inside\" /> Kotto reported one of the things he liked in the role was Kananga's interest in the [[occult]], \"feeling like he can control past, present and future\".<ref name=\"doc73\" />\n\nMankiewicz created the character Sheriff J.
