The plot revolves around a private detective named John Shaft who is hired by a [[Harlem]] mobster to rescue his daughter from the [[Sicilian Mafia|Italian mobsters]] who kidnapped her. The film stars [[Richard Roundtree]] as Shaft, alongside [[Moses Gunn]], [[Charles Cioffi]], [[Christopher St. John]] and [[Lawrence Pressman]].\n\nThe film has themes of [[Black Power movement]], [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[masculinity]], and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

See [[Shaft (1971 film)#Production|'''Production''']].</ref> private detective [[John Shaft]] is informed that some gangsters are looking for him. He spots one of the men waiting for him in his office building, and ambushes him. At gunpoint, he brings him to his office, where the second gangster is already waiting. During a short fight, Shaft dodges one of them, who falls out of a window. The other one reveals that Bumpy Jonas, the leader of a Harlem-based organized crime family, wants Shaft brought uptown to Harlem for a meeting. At the police station, Lt. Vic Androzzi and a detective question Shaft about the gangster's death, which Shaft calls an \"accident\". Androzzi allows Shaft to return to the streets for 48 hours to gather more information. Shaft meets with Bumpy, who tearfully reveals that his daughter has been kidnapped. He asks Shaft to ensure her safe return, and Shaft agrees to help. Bumpy advises that Shaft should seek out Ben Buford, a black militant leader.\n\nShaft tracks down Buford, and a shootout ensues with an unknown assailant. Afterwards, Shaft is told by Androzzi that Shaft, not Ben, was the target, and that tensions brewing between the uptown hoods belonging to Bumpy Jonas and the downtown Mafiosi have culminated in other murders. Androzzi laments that the issue is seen as black-against-white to the general public and worries about the escalation into a full-blown [[race war]]. He also shows Shaft some pictures of Mafia men who just arrived in New York. Shaft and Ben meet with Bumpy and accuse him of setting up the shootout. After agreeing to pay $10,000 for each of Ben's men who died, Ben and Shaft join forces to find Bumpy's daughter.\n\nLater, Shaft surmises that mobsters are watching his apartment from a local bar. Shaft pretends to be a bartender and calls Androzzi to have the mobsters arrested. Shaft then confronts the arrested mobsters about Bumpy's daughter, and he sets up a meeting. When he gets home, Vic arrives and tells Shaft that the room at the station house was [[covert listening device|bugged]] and his superior wants to bring Shaft in for questioning regarding the kidnapping. Instead of taking him in, Androzzi leaves. Shaft is escorted by a Mafia member to the apartment where Marcy Jonas is being held, and Ben and two of his men tail them. Once there, a shootout ensues: two Mafia men are killed and Shaft takes a bullet in the shoulder. After receiving medical attention, Shaft tells Ben to round up his men and meet him at the hotel where Marcy has been taken. He calls Bumpy to tell him his daughter is fine, but that he needs [[taxicab]]s at the hotel for the getaway.\n\nAt the hotel, Shaft, Ben, and Ben's men dress as hotel workers and slowly infiltrate the hotel. Shaft gets to the roof of the hotel, and swings into the room where Marcy is kept. He kills the gangster guarding her and brings her outside. Meanwhile, Ben and his men kill the gangsters in the surrounding rooms, and exit. After the taxicabs take Marcy, Ben, and Ben's men away, Shaft calls Androzzi from a phone booth, telling him that his case has just busted open. Androzzi asks him to close it, and Shaft replies, in reference to an earlier scene, \"You're gonna have to close it yourself, shitty!\", then hangs up the phone and walks away laughing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Roundtree]] as [[John Shaft]]\n* [[Moses Gunn]] as \"Bumpy\" Jonas\n* [[Drew Bundini Brown]] as Willy\n* [[Charles Cioffi]] as Lieutenant Vic Androzzi\n* [[Christopher St. John]] as Ben Buford\n* Gwenn Mitchell as Ellie Moore\n* [[Lawrence Pressman]] as Tom Hannon\n* [[Victor Arnold (American actor)|Victor Arnold]] as Charlie\n* [[Tony King (actor)|Tony King]] as Davies\n* Sherri Brewer as Marcy Jonas\n* [[Rex Robbins]] as Rollie\n* [[Camille Yarbrough]] as Dina Greene\n* Margaret Warncke as Linda\n* Joseph Leon as Byron Leibowitz\n* [[Arnold Johnson (actor)|Arnold Johnson]] as Cul\n* [[Antonio Fargas]] as \"Bunky\"\n\n== Background ==\n''Shaft'' was adapted from Ernest Tidyman's novels by Tidyman and screenwriter John D.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993.</ref>\n\nThe screen detective genre in the late 1960s had been dominated by the big movies, big stars. [[Paul Newman]] had established his [[Harper (film)|Harper]] in 1966, (the character reprised 1975, in [[The Drowning Pool (film)|The Drowning Pool]]). Soon following, [[Frank Sinatra]]'s ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967), ''[[The Detective (1968 film)|The Detective]]'' (1968), ''[[Lady in Cement]]'' (1968) further set the quality. Industry knowledge suggested that the first of the [[Dirty Harry (film series)|Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry]] productions was also slated for a 1971 release. Gordon Parks's directorial debut of a major entertainment production was set on a course for an appreciation of comparisons. The instinctive cultural polymath knew where a coup of casting was his by necessity to play.\n\nAlthough black in the source novel, Tidyman's original draft screenplay had Shaft as white.

He sold the movie rights to ''Shaft'' by showing the galley proofs to the studio (the novel had not yet been published).  Tidyman was honored by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] for his work on the ''Shaft'' movies and books.\n\n== Major themes ==\n{{synthesis|section|date=May 2016}}\n{{tone|section|date=May 2016}}\n\n=== Portrayal of race ===\n''Shaft'' played a crucial part in the development of African-American advancement in Hollywood.\nIn the creation of ''Shaft'', there was a significant African-American presence, with director Parks, editor [[Hugh A. Robertson]], and musical composer [[Isaac Hayes]] playing crucial roles. On the other hand, white men controlled the other important aspects of ''Shaft'''s production. Scenarist and writer Tidyman, writer Black, producer Freeman, and executive producers Silliphant and Lewis<ref name=\":2\" /> were all white men who heavily influenced the making of ''Shaft''. In an analysis of ''Shaft'', Stanly Corkin stated, \"Further, the reception of the idea of blackness also becomes various, defined by any number of subject positions, and again, those cannot be fixed to any particular racially defined place of origin.\" In other words, the perception of race depends on the viewer and thus differs between individuals. Since different representations of race appeal to different people, the film's white creators fabricated its representation of blackness in order to appeal to African American and white audiences alike. MGM was struggling financially during the making of this film, so making a profitable film was a necessity. \"Under the devious guise of providing the Black American with a new and positive image of his/her life, these films confer upon the viewer, Black or White, little more than a pretended glamour and sophistication, the empty, repetitive wasteland of ancient Hollywood traditionalism.\"<ref name=\":6\">Clayton Riley, \"Shaft Can Do Everything\u2014I Can Do Nothing\", ''The New York Times'', August 13, 1972. D9.</ref>\n\nParks' decision to cast Roundtree rather than a white actor, for whom the role was written, instantly altered the presentation of race in the film.<ref name=\":3\" /> Critics, however, believed the plot was not altered enough to accommodate the change in racial dynamics. \"Mark Reid, for example, argues that Shaft is a product of the (white) studio imagination and merely a 'black-skinned replica' of the white action hero commonly found in the detective genre.\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nOne way that Shaft's blackness was showcased was through his attire. Shaft was \"stylistically racialized: [He] wears clothes and affects manners that are associated with being black\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Shaft was known for his elegant garb, as he was frequently draped in leather coats and turtlenecks throughout the film. Although his smooth, classy look evoked a greater interest from viewers, it in no way represented fashion typical of the black community in that era.\n\nFurther, Shaft relies upon a group of militant [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]] in helping him complete his mission to save Bumpy's daughter. The inclusion of a group so strongly identified with the [[Black Power movement]] was clearly an effort to appeal to black audience members. However, the film presented the black nationalists as a group that failed to further the black cause, raised no awareness of the black struggle, and displayed them simply as a hired team of assailants to assist Shaft on his mission.\n\nThe filming of ''Shaft'' partly in the neighborhood of Harlem also allowed the black viewer to have a deeper connection to this film. The writers portrayed Shaft as a man who clearly had a good relationship with this neighborhood, yet rejected it once he became wealthy, moving to the predominantly white area of Greenwich Village. Traditional black thought in this era was that African Americans who had been prosperous financially should invest in and give back to the communities from which they came. Instead, \"the implication is that the wise black (Shaft) will want to sever ties with the people of Harlem and find a place among whites.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> This point further indicates the false portrayal of race in ''Shaft'', as a true black action hero of his time period would have been more loyal to his neighborhood.\n\nThe result of this inauthentic portrayal of blackness in early 1970s blaxploitation films like ''Shaft'' had an effect on black audiences viewing them. Instead of the collective nature of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and Black Power movement in the 1960s, these films helped to usher in a decade of self-indulgence, material gain, and drug consumption.<ref name=\":4\" /> \"Equally important, Riley points out that the narratives about, and images of, blacks in these new films are no more than thematic templates reworked with black casts and updated stereotypes that reconfirm white expectations of blacks and serve to repress and delay the awakening of any real political consciousness.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Black power through masculinity ===\nAlthough ''Shaft'' was a depiction of blackness by white creators, the movie touched on several themes that reflected the ideals of the Black Power movement. Some of the actions taken by Shaft highlighted the positive aspects of this movement, while others brought out some of its less progressive facets.\n\nA noticeable quality of Roundtree's character was his commanding presence and the control that he displayed in almost every situation he faced throughout the film. In the Black Power movement, leaders ardently fought to gain greater presence and control for their people, because even after [[desegregation]], African Americans were still greatly excluded from the economic, political, and cultural systems engrained in white American society. Shaft was depicted as a character that had achieved a high level of personal freedom, confidence, and control in his life, which was exciting for African American viewers. At the beginning of the film, Shaft was approached by two police officers seeking information. As the officers were depending upon his information, Shaft dictated the conversation from a position of power. Spatially, he also was much taller than the officers, further boosting his position of control. Shaft's economic independence was a crucial part of his persona. Once bankrolled by Bumpy, Shaft was often seen giving money to others, which showed that he had substantial financial security. He also had a beautiful apartment located in Greenwich Village, where rent would have been expensive. The Black Power movement frequently stressed the importance of upward [[social mobility]].\n\nAnother prominent characteristic of this movement was its strong focus on [[masculinity]]. This emphasis on the male effort to improve black life was accompanied by [[Sexism|sexist]] beliefs by many leading activists. Their sexist views were felt to be a reaction to the hierarchical power structure already prevalent in society. Having been subjugated by white people for years, African-American men in turn treated women as beneath them. \"Robyn Wiegman argues that the members of the Black Power Movement defined the politics of race within 'a metaphorics of phallic power,' which developed out of male activists' desire to counter cultural articulations of black male inferiority, and that this perspective is readily seen in the writings of influential figures such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Huey P. Newton|Huey Newton]], [[Eldridge Cleaver]], and [[Amiri Baraka]].\"<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nShaft directly embodied this ideal of extreme black masculinity through displays of hypersexuality and misogyny. \"Although Shaft lacked power in the racial sphere, by virtue of being a heterosexual male in a patriarchal system, he still maintains a semblance of power in relation to women.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> From the very beginning of the film, Shaft's sexuality was highlighted as an important characteristic of his persona.

In one episode Will denies that Shaft is a fictional character and claims he is real, parodying how young children deny that the cartoon characters they love are not real. \"The Wedding Show (Psyche!)\", a [[List of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episodes (season 5)|fifth-season episode]], includes a ''Shaft''-themed wedding for Will and his fianc\u00e9e, Lisa.\n\nIn The Simpsons episode 'One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish', Bart and Lisa sing the theme song from \"Shaft\" by Isaac Hayes. The censors originally objected to Bart and Lisa singing the theme from \"Shaft\", but the producers had to show a clip from the Academy Awards when that song was nominated and performed on television to let the censors know it was suitable to show.\n\nIn ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', in the fifth season Halloween episode 5, surgical resident Dr. Peter Benton dresses up as John Shaft and reveals to British surgical intern and previous trauma fellow Dr. Elizabeth Corday that when he was a kid he wanted to be Shaft.\n\nIn the ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' presentation of ''[[Mitchell (film)|Mitchell]]'', [[Joel Robinson|Joel]] and the robots perform a variation of Isaac Hayes' \"Shaft\" theme during that film's opening credits. In ''[[Good Eats]]'', [[Alton Brown]] performs a parody of the film's theme song about [[puff pastry]].  In the final ''[[Father Ted]] ''episode \"[[Going to America]]\", the song is played by an elated Ted, perking up a depressive priest in the process.\n\nIt was noted by [[Quentin Tarantino]] during the 2012 Comic-Con panel that Broomhilda von Shaft and Django Freeman from his movie ''[[Django Unchained]]'' are intended as the great-great-great-great grandparents of John Shaft, from the ''Shaft'' movie series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/django-unchained-a-shaft-prequel-so-says-quentin-tarantino-comic-con/|title='Django Unchained' A 'Shaft' Prequel?
