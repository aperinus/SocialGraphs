A. Rey]] and [[Margret Rey]]. It was directed by [[Matthew O'Callaghan]], written by Ken Kaufman and produced by [[Ron Howard]], [[David Kirschner]], and Jon Shapiro. Featuring the voices of [[Will Ferrell]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[David Cross]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Joan Plowright]], and [[Dick Van Dyke]], it tells the story of how the Man with the Yellow Hat, a tour guide at a museum, first befriended a curious monkey named George and started going on adventures with him around the city.\n\nIt is the first theatrically-released animated film from [[Universal Pictures]] since 1995's ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]'', the first theatrical animated film from [[Universal Animation Studios]] (making this Universal's first in-house theatrical animated film), and the first animated film from [[Imagine Entertainment]].{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} The film had languished in [[development hell]] at Imagine Entertainment since at least 1992, but it is possible that it was conceived years before. The film employs a notable blend of traditional animation and CGI scenery and objects that make up 20% of its environment. The soundtrack was composed by [[Heitor Pereira]] and features several songs by musician [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]].\n\n''Curious George'' was released in the United States by [[Universal Pictures]] on February 10, 2006. It was met with generally positive reviews and grossed $70 million worldwide against a budget of $50 million. Even though its mild success in the box office, Curious George made about 48 million dollars in DVD sales in the home market. It received five sequels, although all but one of them were released as [[direct-to-video]] films. A second theatrical ''Curious George'' film is in development, with [[Andrew Adamson]] set to direct.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Film plots should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nTed is a museum tour guide who gives weekly presentations to schoolteacher Maggie Dunlop and her students. Ted's boss, Mr. Bloomsberry, informs him that the museum is losing money and will have to close. Mr. Bloomsberry's son, Junior, plans to have the museum demolished and replaced with a commercial parking lot. Ted impulsively volunteers to find the Lost Shrine of Zagawa, a legendary 40-foot African [[Cult image|idol]], hoping that it will attract visitors. After the owners of a clothing store trick Ted into buying one of their bright yellow suits, he boards a [[cargo ship]] to Africa.\n\nIn the African jungle, Ted finds the idol, but it is only three inches tall. He sends a photograph of it to the museum, but the photograph's angle leads Mr. Bloomsberry to believe that the idol is even larger than he thought. Ted also encounters a happy and mischievous lonely monkey and gives him his yellow hat. Not wanting to be left alone, the monkey follows him and boards the cargo ship. Ted returns home and finds advertisements for the shrine all over the city.\n\nUpon reaching Ted's apartment building, the monkey makes his way to the [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]] and vandalizes the walls of Ted's neighbor, Miss Plushbottom, with paint. Due to the building's strict no-pet policy, Ted is evicted by Ivan, the doorman. At the museum, Ted reveals the idol's actual size to Mr. Bloomsberry and is kicked out by Junior after the monkey accidentally destroys an [[Apatosaurus]] skeleton. After a failed call to the [[animal control service]] to try to get rid of the monkey, Ted and the monkey are forced to sleep outside in a park. The next morning, Ted follows the monkey into the zoo, where Maggie and her students name the monkey George after a statue of [[George Washington]]. George floats away on helium balloons that are popped by [[bird control spikes]], but he is saved by Ted.\n\nAt the home of Clovis, an inventor, George discovers that an [[overhead projector]] makes the idol appear huge. Ted borrows Clovis' truck to take the projector to the museum to show Mr. Bloomsberry, but when Junior overhears Bloomsberry telling Ted he is proud of him and is like the son he never had, he proceeds to pour some of his [[latte]] on the projector in an attempt to ruin Ted's plan, causing it to break, and frames George by giving him the rest (which causes Ted to think George ruined the plan). With his plan derailed, Ted sadly informs the public that the museum will permanently close and allows animal control to take George back to Africa.\n\nLater, Ted speaks with Maggie, who helps him to understand what is important in life. He sneaks onto the ship and reunites with George in the cargo hold. George notices that the idol reveals a [[pictogram]] when exposed to light, and Ted realizes that it is a map to the real idol, which they find in the jungle.\n\nThe real idol is displayed in the museum, which reopens with new interactive exhibits (thanks to Clovis and his inventions). Junior gets a job as a valet and finds joy in his father finally being proud of him. Ivan, who has grown fond of George, invites Ted to move back into his apartment. Ted and Maggie share a romantic moment, but are interrupted by George, who has activated Clovis' rocket. Ted jumps in and they circumnavigate the globe.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Curious George|George]], a curious tailless monkey.
