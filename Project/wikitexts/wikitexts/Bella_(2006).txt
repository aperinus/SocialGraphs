Set in New York City, the film is about the events of one day and the impact on the characters' lives.\n\n==Plot==\nIn New York City, Jos\u00e9 works as a cook in a Mexican restaurant owned by his stern chef brother, Manny. The establishment is getting ready for the noon rush. Nina, the waitress, arrives late for the second day in a row and Manny fires her on the spot. As Nina leaves, she drops her [[teddy bear]]; Jos\u00e9 retrieves it and chases her into the subway to hand it back. When asked why she was late, she tells him she is pregnant and was ill from [[morning sickness]]. Jos\u00e9 offers her a stroll around the city, which she accepts. He takes Nina to Manny's colleague's restaurant to recommend her for a waitressing position. While they dine to wait for the response, Nina tells him she does not intend to proceed with her pregnancy and is seriously considering an abortion partly because the father is uninterested in supporting her and she is broke.\n\nNina agrees to go with him to the beach but Jos\u00e9 says he has to go back to the restaurant and get his wallet. When he returns, Manny rebukes him for flaking at work for Nina. After Jos\u00e9 argues with his brother over his oppressive demeanor, Manny fires him. Jos\u00e9 then boards a train with Nina to his home. During the trip he persuades Nina to give up the unborn child for adoption, but she argues in favor of [[bodily integrity|autonomy over her body]]. Jos\u00e9 takes her to his parents' house and introduces her to his family. He takes Nina into the garage and shows her his old car which, a few years ago, he reveals he had been driving with his manager during the peak of his career as a soccer player, and accidentally hit and killed a little girl. His manager frantically suggested fleeing the crime, but he instead chose to take responsibility. Jos\u00e9 was then sentenced to four years in prison for [[involuntary manslaughter]]. After being released, he tried unsuccessfully multiple times to reconcile with the girl's single mother, and the tragedy has since left him [[Major depressive disorder|depressed]] and suicidal.\n\nJos\u00e9's parents invite Nina to have dinner, during which time she finds out that Manny was adopted. They tell her she is always welcome to stay at their house. Jos\u00e9 takes Nina to the nearby beach, where she tells him how her father's death when she was twelve caused her and her mother severe emotional pain. Because she had no siblings and spent her childhood taking care of her emotionally crippled mother, she tells Jos\u00e9 how fortunate he is to have a loving family, and hopes someday she would meet a man who loves her and is as capable of raising a family as her father was. The next day, before they each go their own way, Nina says she needs a friend to be there for her the next week. Jos\u00e9 walks back to the restaurant and reconciles with Manny.\n\nSeveral years later, Jos\u00e9 is seen playing on a beach with a young girl. When Nina arrives she meets what is implied to be her daughter, Bella, whom she had considered aborting but then gave over for Jos\u00e9 to adopt. Mother and daughter exchange gifts, Nina tearfully giving Bella the teddy bear her father had gifted her as a child, while Bella hands Nina a [[seashell]]. Afterward, all three stroll down the beach together.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Eduardo Ver\u00e1stegui]] as Jos\u00e9\n* [[Tammy Blanchard]] as Nina\n* [[Manny P\u00e9rez]] as Manny\n* [[Ali Landry]] as Celia\n* [[Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez]] as Eduardo\n* [[Ang\u00e9lica Arag\u00f3n]] as Jos\u00e9's Mother\n* [[Ewa Da Cruz]] as Veronica\n* Alexa Gerasimovich as Luchi\n* [[Sophie Nyweide]] as Bella\n* [[Herbie Lovelle]] as The Blind Homeless Man\n\n==Production==\n''Bella'' marks the feature directorial debut for [[Alejandro Gomez Monteverde]], who co-wrote its original screenplay with Patrick Million.
