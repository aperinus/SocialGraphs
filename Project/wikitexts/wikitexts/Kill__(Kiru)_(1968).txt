He meets Hanjir\u014d Tabata (Etsushi Takahashi) a farmer who wants to become a samurai to escape his powerless existence. Genta and Tabata wind up on opposite sides of clan intrigue when seven members of a local clan assassinate their chancellor. Although the seven, led by Tetsutar\u014d Oikawa (Naoko Kubo) rebelled with the support of their superior, Ayuzawa (Shigeru K\u014dyama), he turns on them and sends members of the clan to kill them as outlaws.\n\n==Style==\nThe film is a comically exaggerated exploration of what it is to be a samurai.  The characters either give up samurai status or fight to attain it, and samurai are seen behaving both honorably and very badly. The film has a parodic tone, with numerous references to earlier samurai films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=313&eid=440&section=essay|title=Kill!|website=Criterion.com}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as Genta (Hy\u014dd\u014d Yagenta)\n*[[Etsushi Takahashi]] as Hanji (Hanjir\u014d Tabata)\n*[[Yuriko Hoshi]] as Chino Kajii\n*[[Naoko Kubo]] as Tetsutar\u014d Oikawa\n*[[Shigeru K\u014dyama]] as Ayuzawa\n*[[Akira Kubo]] as Monnosuke Takei\n*[[Seishir\u014d Kuno]] as Daijir\u014d Masataka\n*[[Tadao Nakamaru]] as Sh\u014dda Magobei\n*[[Eijir\u014d T\u014dno]] as Moriuchi Hy\u014dgo\n*[[Shin Kishida]] as Jurota Arao\n*[[Atsuo Nakamura]] as Tetsutaro\n*[[Ryosuke Kagawa]] as Mizoguchi\n*[[Takeo Chii]] as Yoshida Yaheiji\n*[[Susumu Kurobe]] as Ayusawa Kinzaburo\n*[[Isao Hashimoto]] as Konosuke Fujii\n*[[Yoshio Tsuchiya]] as Matsuo Shiroku\n*[[Hideyo Amamoto]] as Shimada Gendaiu\n\n==Release==\n''Kill!'' was released theatrically in Japan on 22 June 1968 where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=250}} It was released in the United States by Frank lee International with English subtitles in August 1968.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=250}}\n\n==Reception==\nAlong with ''[[Human Bullet]]'' and ''[[Judge and Jeopardy]]'', ''Kill!'' gave art director [[Iwao Akune]] the award for Best Art Direction at the [[Mainichi Film Concours]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=250}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Galbraith IV |first=Stuart |title=The Toho Studios Story: A History and Complete Filmography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7o8pq6G_dYC |access-date=October 29, 2013 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=978-1461673743}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0063186}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1968/cr001540.htm|title=\u65ac\u308b (Kiru)|access-date=2007-07-18|language=ja|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/390-kill-pardon-my-dust ''Kill!: Pardon My Dust''] an essay by Howard Hampton at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/397-kill-rebel-samurai-cinema ''Kill!: Rebel Samurai Cinema''] an essay by [[Chris D.]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Kihachi Okamoto}}\n\n[[Category:1968 films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kihachi Okamoto]]\n[[Category:1960s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Samurai films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Masaru Sato]]\n[[Category:Toho films]]\n[[Category:1960s Japanese films]]\n\n\n{{1960s-Japan-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
