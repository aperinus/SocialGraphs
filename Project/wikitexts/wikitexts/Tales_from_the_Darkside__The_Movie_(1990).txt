The film depicts a kidnapped paperboy who tells three stories of horror to the [[suburban]] [[witch]] who is preparing to eat him.\n\n==Plot==\n===Intro===\nBetty, an affluent suburban housewife and modern-day [[Witchcraft|witch]], plans a dinner party for her fellow witches. The main dish is to be Timmy, a young boy whom she has captured and chained up in her pantry. To stall her from stuffing and roasting him, the boy tells her three horror stories from a book she gave him, titled <nowiki>''Tales from the Darkside''</nowiki>.\n\n===''Lot 249''===\nA graduate student, Edward Bellingham, has been cheated by two classmates, Susan, and Lee, who framed him for theft to ruin his chances of winning a scholarship for which they were competing. As revenge, Bellingham reanimates a mummy and uses it to murder them both. Susan's brother Andy kidnaps Bellingham, forces him to summon the mummy, then destroys it and burns its remains and what he believes to be the reanimation parchment. He considers killing Bellingham, but in the end cannot bring himself to commit real murder. However, Bellingham brings Susan and Lee back from the dead (having switched the reanimation parchment with a similar one) and dispatches them to Andy's dorm, where they greet the terrified Andy by saying that Bellingham sends his regards.\n\n===''Cat from Hell''===\nDrogan, a wealthy old man who uses a wheelchair, brings in a hitman named Halston for a bizarre hire: kill a [[black cat]], which Drogan believes is murderously evil. Drogan explains that there were three other occupants of his house before the cat arrived: his sister, Amanda, her friend Carolyn, and the family's butler, Richard Gage. Drogan claims that one by one, the cat killed the other three, and that he is next. Drogan's [[pharmaceutical company]] killed 5,000 [[Cat|cats]] while testing a new drug, and he is convinced that this black cat is here to [[Karma|exact cosmic revenge]].\n\nHalston does not believe the story, but is more than willing to eliminate the cat since Drogan is offering $100,000. But when Drogan returns to the house to see if the deed is done, he finds that the cat has killed Halston by climbing down his throat. The cat emerges from the hitman's corpse and jumps at Drogan, giving him a fatal heart attack.\n\n===''Lover's Vow''===\nPreston is a struggling [[artist]]. He lives in a studio with a [[skylight]], through which a large stone [[gargoyle]] on the neighboring building, peers down. Preston's agent calls, asking to meet with him at a bar a few blocks away. The agent tells Preston that his artwork is unpopular and not selling. Dejected, Preston drinks heavily and at the end of the night, the bar owner who is a friend of his, offers to walk him home.\n\nAlong the way, Preston stops to relieve himself in a back alley, when his friend sees and shoots at a [[gargoyle]] monster. The creature attacks, severing his hand and then decapitating him. Terrified, Preston tries to run away, but the creature corners him and speaks, agreeing to spare his life if he swears never to reveal what he has seen. The monster scratches Preston's chest, saying \"Cross your heart?\", then vanishes.\n\nPreston runs into another alley where he bumps into a lone woman named Carola. She claims to have become lost while going to meet friends and was searching for a taxi. Preston convinces her to call a taxi from his apartment, where Carola cleans the gargoyle-inflicted wound on his chest, and they have sex with each other.\n\nPreston's life soon improves, and his struggling art career becomes wildly successful, mostly thanks to Carola's connections. They eventually marry and have two children. Preston is still tormented by memories of the gargoyle though, and his vow of silence weighs heavily on him. On the tenth anniversary of him first meeting Carola, Preston breaks down and tells her about the monster. Carola appears uncomfortable by his revelation and then emits a heartbroken wail, \"You promised you'd never tell!\", revealing herself as the creature that killed his friend.\n\nWith Preston's vow broken, Carola can no longer remain human and begins transforming back into a gargoyle. Their children are screaming in the bedroom as they also transform into gargoyles. Carola, now fully transformed, wraps her wings around Preston and the couple proclaim their love for each other, but with the vow broken, Carola is still reluctantly forced to kill him by biting his neck, before flying away with her gargoyle children. The final scene shows the three gargoyles now turned to stone and sitting upon the building ledge, staring down at the city with sorrowful expressions.\n\n===Epilogue===\nBetty remarks that Timmy saved the best story (\"Lover's Vow\") for last, but he says that the next one is best, and has a happy ending. She replies that it is too late as she has to start cooking him, and that none of the stories in the book have happy endings. As Betty advances on Timmy, he narrates his own actions: throwing some marbles on the floor, causing her to slip and fall on her butcher's block and impaling her on her own tools. Timmy releases himself and pushes her into her own oven. The film ends with Timmy helping himself to a cookie and breaking the fourth wall by saying \"Don't you just love happy endings?\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n;Wraparound Story\n*[[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]] as Betty\n*[[Matthew Lawrence]] as Timmy\n\n;Lot 249\n*[[Steve Buscemi]] as Edward Bellingham \n*[[Julianne Moore]] as Susan Smith\n*[[Christian Slater]] as Andy Smith\n*[[Robert Sedgwick (actor)|Robert Sedgwick]] as Lee\n*Donald Van Horn as Moving Man\n*Michael Deak as Mummy\n*[[George Guidall]] as Museum Director\n*[[Kathleen Chalfant]] as Dean\n*[[Ralph Marrero]] as Cabbie\n\n;Cat from Hell\n*[[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as Drogan\n*[[David Johansen]] as Halston\n*Paul Greeno as Cabbie\n*[[Alice Drummond]] as Carolyn\n*[[Dolores Sutton]] as Amanda\n*[[Mark Margolis]] as Gage\n\n;Lover's Vow\n*[[James Remar]] as Preston\t\n*[[Rae Dawn Chong]] as Carola\n*[[Robert Klein]] as Wyatt\n*Ashton Wise as Jer\n*Philip Lenkowsky as Maddox\n*Joe Dabenigno as Cop #1\n*Larry Silvestri as Cop #2\n*Donna Davidge as Gallery Patron\n*[[Nicole Leach|Nicole Rochelle]] as Margaret\n*Daniel Harrison as John\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe first segment is an adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1892 short story, \"Lot No. 249\"; written by Michael McDowell.\n\nThe second segment is an adaptation of Stephen King's 1977 short story \"The Cat from Hell\"; written by George A.
