After a brush with fame and success in the 1970s, Pena's fortunes faded as he dealt with career and health problems.\n\nWhile listening to [[shortwave radio]], Pena heard a broadcast of [[overtone singing|throat singing]], the Tuvan art of manipulating overtones while singing to make higher frequencies more distinguishable, essentially making it possible to sing two notes at once. Pena, over the course of several years, taught himself to throat sing to a very impressive degree. He eventually attended a concert of throat singing and after the concert impressed one of the throat singers, [[Kongar-ol Ondar]], who invited him to visit [[Tuva]], a republic of the [[Russian Federation]] and a formerly independent country from 1921 to 1944 under the name of the [[People's Republic of Tannu Tuva]] and the home of throat singing, to sing in the triennial throat singing festival held there.\n\nThe entire journey, as well as the extraordinary mix of cultures and music, is captured in the documentary.\n\n==Production==\nThe Belic brothers shot the film with two Hi8 camcorders and edited it themselves. They were allowed to edit the film during nighttime at a professional editing facility. It took them three and a half years to finish the film after they shot it. All this time they lived on $500 a month in an apartment above an auto repair shop.<ref name=\"FindingTheirTuva\">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2003-10-10/181055/|title=Finding Their Tuva}}</ref> [[Christopher Nolan]], a longtime friend of the brothers, is credited for his \"editorial assistance.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.genghisblues.com/ ''Genghis Blues'' official movie site]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0187859|title=Genghis Blues}}\n*[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=genghisblues.htm Genghis Blues (1999) at Box Office Mojo]\n*[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/04/movies/film-how-a-creole-singer-wowed-them-in-shangri-la.html How a Creole Singer Wowed Them in Shangri-La]\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Throat singing]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about blind people]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Roko Belic]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about singers]]\n[[Category:Tuva]]\n[[Category:1999 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Camcorder films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
