The film stars [[Sean Connery]] and [[Lorraine Bracco]], and features an acclaimed score by veteran composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe [[pharmaceutical company]] Aston Laboratories sends biochemist Dr. Rae Crane into the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonian rainforest]] to locate researcher Robert Campbell, after his wife and research partner abandon him. Crane is bringing equipment and supplies, but Campbell is upset the research partner is not forthcoming. He tries to send Crane home, but she demurs, as she has been assigned to determine whether Campbell's research deserves continued funding.\n\nCampbell has found a \"[[cure for cancer]]\", but attempts to synthesize the compound have failed. With supplies of the successful serum running low, Campbell isolates a derivative of a species of flower from which the formula can be synthesized and with Crane's help is determined to find its source. Campbell earns the title \"medicine man\" of the village by giving a boy with a stomach ache Alka Seltzer, insulting the real medicine man and driving him deep into the forest. A [[logging]] company is building a road headed straight for the village, threatening to expose the native population to potentially lethal foreign pathogens, as has happened before. In fact, Campbell's wife left him because he could not forgive himself for the tragedy.\n\nA small boy appears with malignant neoplasms and Campbell, Crane, the boy, and his father set out in search of Campbell's predecessor, a medicine man from whom Campbell once acquired his knowledge of flowers. Upon encountering Campbell's entourage, the medicine man flees in fear. Though he is reluctant to pursue the man further, Crane convinces him circumstances demand that he must. Campbell rescues Crane from a fall, then locates the medicine man, whom he is compelled to fight in order to heal the medicine man's wounded pride and gain further necessary information. Unfortunately, the medicine man reveals that the flowers have no \"juju\"\u2014power to heal. Father and son agree to return another time. Back at the village, Crane initially refuses to allow Campbell to inoculate the boy with the last of the serum until more can be synthesized. But when the boy's condition worsens, she gives in and the boy is inoculated.\n\nThe next morning, the boy is better but the village is in tumult. The logging road is nearly finished. Campbell appeals to the company's workers to halt construction until he can conclude his research, but it refuses. In desperation and after new samples fail to contain the missing compound, Crane runs the chromatograph one more time and accidentally discovers that the source of the cure is not the flower but a species of rare ant [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to the rainforest. Campbell demands the construction stop. A fight results and a bulldozer catches fire, destroying the village and the research station along with many acres of rainforest.\n\nThe next day, Crane promises to send Campbell new equipment and the research assistant he'd originally requested. She is about to return home when she meets the medicine man. He symbolically passes on his mantle to Campbell, and Crane accepts an invitation to continue working with him in exchange for recognition for co-discovering the source of the compound.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Dr. Robert Campbell\n* [[Lorraine Bracco]] as Dr. Rae Crane\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Wilker]] as Dr. Miguel Ornega\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Lavat]] as Government Man\n\n==Production==\n[[Tom Schulman]]'s script was purchased for $2.5 million with a further $1 million spent on rewrites by Sally Robinson and [[Tom Stoppard]].<ref name=AFI/>\n\nProduction started March 4, 1991 in the Mexican jungle near [[Catemaco]] and was completed in July.<ref name=AFI/> Connery and Bracco both complained of conditions on set.<ref name=AFI/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Medicine Man\n| type       = [[Film score]]\n| artist     = [[Jerry Goldsmith]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = February 4, 1994\n| recorded   = 1994\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 50:09\n| label      =\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe music for ''Medicine Man'' was composed and conducted by veteran composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]].
