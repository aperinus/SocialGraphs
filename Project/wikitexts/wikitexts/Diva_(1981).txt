It eschewed the [[Realism (arts)|realist]] mood of 1970s French cinema and instead adopted a colourful, melodic style, later described as ''[[cin\u00e9ma du look]]''.\n\nThe film made a successful debut in France in 1981 with 2,281,569 admissions, and had success in the U.S. the next year, grossing $2,678,103.<ref name=\"JPBox Office\"/> ''Diva'' became a [[Cult film|cult classic]] and was internationally acclaimed.\n\n==Plot==\nA young Parisian postman, Jules, is obsessed with opera, and particularly with Cynthia Hawkins, a beautiful and celebrated American soprano who has never allowed her singing to be recorded. Jules attends a recital at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes du Nord]] in Paris, where Hawkins sings the [[aria]] \"''Ebben? Ne andr\u00f2 lontana''{{-\"}} from the opera ''[[La Wally]]''. He illicitly makes a high-quality [[bootleg recording]] of her performance using a [[Nagra]] professional [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape-recorder]]. Afterwards, he steals the gown she was wearing from her dressing room.\n\nLater, Jules accidentally comes into possession of an [[compact cassette|audio cassette]] with the recorded testimony of a [[prostitute]], Nadia, which exposes a senior police officer, ''[[Commissaire divisionnaire]]'' Jean Saporta, as being the boss of a drug trafficking and prostitution racket. Nadia drops the cassette in the bag of the postman's [[moped]] moments before she is killed by Saporta's two henchmen\u2014''L' Antillais'' and ''Le Cur\u00e9'' (\"The West Indian\" and \"The Priest\").\n\nTwo police officers are now after Jules, seeking Nadia's cassette, although they only know that it incriminates a prominent gangster and not that the gangster is actually their superior. Jules is also being hunted by Saporta's two murderous henchmen. A third party seeking him is two Taiwanese men, who are after his unique and valuable recording of Cynthia Hawkins. Jules seeks refuge from all these pursuers with his new friends, the mysterious [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] Serge Gorodish and his young Vietnamese-French muse, Alba.\n\nFeeling guilty, Jules returns Cynthia Hawkins' dress. She is initially angry, but eventually forgives him. Cynthia is intrigued by the young Jules' adoration and a kind of romantic relationship develops, expressed by the background of the piano instrumental, ''Promenade Sentimentale'' by [[Vladimir Cosma]], as they walk around Paris in the [[Jardin des Tuileries]] early one morning. The Taiwanese try to [[blackmail]] Cynthia into signing a [[recording contract]] with them. Although they do not yet possess Jules' recording of her performance, they claim they do and threaten to release it as a [[Copyright infringement|pirate]] record if she does not cooperate; she indignantly refuses.\n[[File:Lighthouse of Gatteville-7873.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Phare de Gatteville]]'', a lighthouse on the Normandy coast, was the filming location for the safehouse Jules was taken to by Gorodish and Alba<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/d/Diva.html |title=Diva film locations |publisher=movie-locations.com |access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref>]]\nJules is spotted and chased by the two police officers, but he escapes by riding his moped through the [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] system. He takes refuge in the apartment of a prostitute he knows, but flees when he realizes she is part of Saporta's criminal network\u2014he leaves just before  ''L' Antillais'' and ''Le Cur\u00e9'' arrive. The enforcers chase him on foot and Jules is shot and wounded, but Gorodish rescues Jules just before ''Le Cur\u00e9'' can kill him. Gorodish and Alba drive Jules to a [[safe house]] outside Paris, a remote lighthouse, in Gorodish's antique [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]].\n\nGorodish plans an elaborate scheme. Now in possession of the recording that incriminates Saporta, Gorodish uses it to blackmail him. Commissaire Saporta pays off Gorodish, but places a [[remote control]] [[bomb]] under his car. The Taiwanese blackmailers are also pursuing Gorodish and immediately steal the tape and his car. Saporta sets off the explosion, inadvertently killing the two Taiwanese, but not Gorodish. Gorodish drives away in a second Traction Avant that he had hidden in advance.\n\nLater, Jules returns to Paris to give Cynthia his bootleg recording and lift the threat of blackmail from her. But he is abducted from outside her hotel by ''L'Antillais'' and ''Le Cur\u00e9'' who were lying in wait for him; they take him to his loft apartment with the intention of killing him there. Police officer Paula, who has been keeping Jules' apartment under surveillance, saves him by killing ''Le Cur\u00e9'' and wounding ''L'Antillais''. Saporta then appears, kills his surviving henchman, and attempts to kill Jules and Paula, intending to make it look like his dead henchman shot them. Once again Gorodish saves the day by turning out the lights and making Saporta fall down an elevator shaft in the dark.\n\nIn the film's final scene, Jules plays his tape of Cynthia's performance for her and she expresses her nervousness over hearing it because she \"never heard [herself] sing.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Andr\u00e9i]] as Jules\n* [[Wilhelmenia Fernandez]] (billed as Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez) as Cynthia Hawkins\n* [[Richard Bohringer]] as Gorodish\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] as ''Le Cur\u00e9'' (\"The Priest\")\n* [[G\u00e9rard Darmon]] as ''L'Antillais''\n* Thuy An Luu as Alba\n* [[Jacques Fabbri]] as Jean Saporta\n* Anny Romand as Paula, Police officer\n* Patrick Floersheim as ''Zatopek'', Police officer\n* Chantal Deruaz as Nadia\n* [[Roland Bertin]] as Weinstadt\n* Jean-Luc Porraz as Mermoz\n* [[Laure Duthilleul]] as Mermoz's friend\n* [[Dominique Besnehard]] as record store employee\n* [[Isabelle Mergault]] as game girl\n\n==Soundtrack==\nHighlights of the soundtrack include the aria ''Ebben?
