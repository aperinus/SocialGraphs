The film is the sequel to the 1977 film ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''.\n\nThe film was originally released in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia and several other, mainly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], countries as '''''Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again'''''.\n\nThe plot centers on Bo \"Bandit\" Darville ([[Burt Reynolds]]) and Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow ([[Jerry Reed]]), transporting an elephant to the [[Republican National Convention|GOP National Convention]], with Sheriff [[Buford T. Justice]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) once again in hot pursuit.\n\n== Plot ==\nBig Enos Burdette is in a literal [[Negative campaigning|mudslinging]] campaign against John Conn for [[Governor of Texas]]. After failing to get the outgoing governor's endorsement, Big Enos overhears him on the phone ordering a crate in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] to be delivered in nine days to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] National Convention in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. Burdette schemes to earn the governor's endorsement and have the crate delivered to the convention in his name, and tracks down Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow and offers him and Bo \"Bandit\" Darville $200,000 to do the run. Cledus takes the Burdettes to Bandit to make the offer in person, but Bandit has become a heavy drinker since breaking up with Carrie (\"Frog\"), and is drunk when the Burdettes arrive and double the payoff to $400,000. Cledus accepts on Bandit's behalf, but adds that Big Enos should give them half in advance, to which they agree. Cledus is ecstatic, but Bandit begins to miss Carrie.\n\nCledus calls Carrie, who is back in Texarkana and again about to marry Junior when Cledus calls offering her $50,000 to help out; she agrees and again becomes a runaway bride. Though she still has feelings for Bandit, when Carrie arrives she initially intones she is only in it for the money, and she and Cledus work on getting Bandit off the booze and back into shape. She then trades in Junior's car for a new [[Pontiac Firebird#Firebird Trans Am|Trans Am]]. The group arrive at the pier in Miami only to find out the manifest is quarantined for three weeks. They return later that night to steal it, only to find the \"package\" is a live elephant (the [[Republican Party (United States)|G.O.P.]] mascot) which Cledus names \"Charlotte\" after his aunt. When Bandit removes a splinter from Charlotte's foot, she takes a liking to him.\n\nSoon after the trio start off for Dallas, they are accosted for the first of several times by Sheriff Justice, but Bandit outwits him and they escape. En route, they stop at a remote fuel station and notice something wrong with Charlotte. Moments later, an ambulance pulls in with an Italian [[Gynaecology|gynecologist]] in the back; \"Doc\" is initially reluctant to help, but when his driver speeds off unknowingly leaving him stranded, he asks to hitch a ride with them, agreeing to watch Charlotte.\n\nDoc later finds that Charlotte is pregnant and due to give birth any time, but Bandit is determined to stay on schedule. Entering Louisiana, Doc says that Charlotte is almost in labor and needs to be off her feet. Cledus chooses they all need a break and they go to a nearby nightclub where [[Don Williams]] is headlining.  When Carrie sees Bandit scribbling on a napkin a picture of Charlotte cradled by suspended netting to keep her off her feet, she angrily leaves, but not before telling Bandit that she will come back only when he likes himself again. Later that night, a drunken Bandit makes his drawing a reality, and Doc agrees that his idea will work.\n\nBuford intends to call for help from his brothers Reggie, a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mountie Sergeant]] in Quebec, and Gaylord, an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] Texas State Patrolman. Later, as Bandit and Cledus enter Texas, Buford lures the Bandit into a trap: a mass of 40 Texas Patrol and Mountie cruisers pursuing him across a desert basin. Bandit orders Cledus to get to Dallas, but he enlists a large convoy of his trucker pals and comes to Bandit's rescue instead, wrecking nearly all of the cruisers in a giant [[demolition derby]] while Doc and Charlotte watch from the sidelines. The two escape by crossing a makeshift trailer bridge with Buford and his brothers in pursuit. Two of the trucks pull away, resulting in Gaylord and Reggie's cruisers crashing in the ensuing gap before they can cross, but Buford is still in pursuit, though his cruiser is barely functioning.\n\nCledus begs Bandit to stop at a safari reserve, where Charlotte finally gives birth to her baby. Bandit is ready to load them both back up in the truck, but Cledus refuses and then knocks Bandit down when he insults him. When he sees Charlotte in tears, Bandit finally comes to his senses and apologizes.\n\nBandit later finds Carrie and tells her that he likes himself now, and that he does not want to be without her. He then tells her that he has not yet taken Charlotte to Dallas, but they can still make it. Carrie is overjoyed when she sees Charlotte's baby, and Bandit asks Charlotte's permission for him and Carrie to get hitched, to which Charlotte trumpets her approval; Doc, now riding in the cab with Cledus and Fred, also voices his approval, and they all drive away with Charlotte and her baby in tow in circus carts, with Buford still in pursuit, now driving a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Bo \"The Bandit\" Darville\n* [[Jackie Gleason]] as [[Buford T.

Football players [[Joe Klecko]] and [[Terry Bradshaw]] also appear in both films.\n\nIt is the first film to feature director [[Hal Needham]]'s \"Blooper Reel Credit Crawl\" at the end, in that a collection of bloopers and outtakes from the film showed on one side of the screen while the closing credits slowly scrolled up the other side. ''Cannonball Run'', also directed by Needham, used this same technique.\n\nBuford's brothers were both portrayed by Gleason; \"Reggie\" was a Canadian version of \"Reginald Van Gleason III\", a popular character from Gleason's [[The Jackie Gleason Show|television show]].\n\nThe film was written and produced before it was announced that the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] would be held in [[Detroit]] rather than Dallas.\n\nMany of the movie's scenes take place in northern [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]], especially at Burt Reynolds' ranch in [[Jupiter, Florida]].\n\nAlthough the Bandit again sticks to a [[Pontiac Trans Am]], this time a 1980 Turbo model with five color decals unlike 1981's single color decals, the Snowman switches to a 1980 [[GMC General]], silver with blue trim with the same mural on the trailer as in the original film. This \"new rig\" suggests that the pair were successful in the \"double or nothing\" wager offered by the Burdettes at the end of the first film, where they were persuaded to drive from [[Atlanta]] to [[Boston]] and back in 18 hours to buy [[clam chowder]] and bring it to the Burdettes.\n\nA world-record automobile jump was captured on film during the \"roundup sequence\", when stuntman Gary Davis jumped a [[Dodge Monaco|1974 Dodge Monaco]] over 150 feet. Davis suffered compressed vertebrae as a result of a hard landing.\n\nThe roundup sequence in the desert shows many new [[Pontiac Le Mans]] sedans decorated as police cars being destroyed. The cars were originally ordered by a car rental agency in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], who refused to accept the delivery when they discovered the cars were not equipped with air conditioning. Pontiac took the cars back and eventually gave them to the producers to be used in the film.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Smokey and the Bandit 2:<br />Original Soundtrack\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1980\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     = 31:59\n| label      = [[MCA Records]]\n| producer   = [[Jerry Kennedy]] <br />[[Snuff Garrett]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n'''''Smokey and the Bandit 2: Original Soundtrack''''' was released on [[LP record|vinyl]], [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] and [[8-track tape]] by [[MCA Records]] in 1980.\n\n===Track listing===\n{{Track listing\n| total_length    = 31:59\n| title1          = Texas Bound and Flyin{{'-}}\n| note1           = [[Jerry Reed]]\n| writer1         = [[Jerry Reed|Jerry R.
