It stars [[Miho Nikaido]] (\u4e8c\u968e\u5802 \u7f8e\u7a42 Nikaid\u014d Miho) and is known by two alternate titles, ''Topaz'' and ''Sex Dreams of Topaz''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

The story follows {{Nihongo|Ai|\u611b||lit. \"love\"}}, the submissive and lovesick prostitute who goes about her trade with misery and is being abused by hedonists and criminals while trying to find some sort of appeasement away from the fact that her lover is currently married.\n\n==Plot==\nAi, a timid 22-year-old college student in [[Tokyo]], works as a prostitute for an exclusive [[escort agency]] that caters to wealthy, perverted men. To please her clients, Ai has to play out elaborate fantasy scenarios involving sexual humiliation and light [[sadism and masochism|sadomasochism]]/[[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]].\n\nThe first two-thirds of the film consists in large part of four erotic sequences involving [[sodomy]], sadomasochism, submission and bondage. Including [[dildo]]s and mirrors\u2014one with a perverted male [[Dominant (BDSM)|dominant]], one with a promiscuous female dominant. The other two involve erotic [[asphyxiation]] with, again, one episode in which a necrophiliac attempts to partially asphyxiate the female protagonist and the other in which a drug addicted man is the recipient to the female protagonist. Other acts of fetishes and paraphilias are involved in some of the scenarios.\n\nThe last third of the film consists of Ai's attempt to find her ex-lover, a famous Gallery artist.\n\nThe actual story however, revolves around Ai's attempt to place herself in the world and understand her life in an attempt to make her own way forward.\n\nThis is played out through the juxtaposition of the false closeness of the paid relationships with her decadent clients against her unrequited love for the gallery artist who has ended his relationship with her. The viewer can see that Ai is desperately grasping at this relationship as real in contrast to the simulated fetish relationships of her clients and we learn that she wishes to tell him of her continued love even though he has moved on and been married.\n\nAi shows an emotional connection to one of her clients, another sex worker who is a female dominant and who Ai clearly admires. Throughout the movie this person is the only person with whom Ai has a free open conversation. This woman delivers a monologue which defines her view of the sex trade as empowering and which is a sentinel defining concept to place the movie itself in a social context. This speech comes at a time when Ai appears to be having difficulties accepting her role as an escort and Ai is shown listening with rapt attention.\n\nAi confides to this client that she has unrequited love for the gallery artist and Ai's client tells her that she must live life to the fullest otherwise she will be filled with regrets. She tells Ai that she must confront this part of her life then she can move forward as her future will be hers.\n\nAt the beginning of the movie we are introduced to Ai's quest to find herself and her direction, She visits a fortune-teller, played by artist Yayoi Kusama, who advises her to find a \"pink stone\", and then \nfashion it into a ring.\n\nThe fortune teller also advises Ai to put a telephone directory under her television and to avoid a gallery in the east. Ai's view of the ring is important enough that when she later loses the ring she risks her life to recover it.\n\nThroughout the movie Ai looks at a photo of what appears to be her as a child with her mother and which in context represents innocence before life became complicated. Ai appears to refer to it to ground herself perhaps pondering how the happy child has transformed in to what she has become.\n\nTaking the advice of her female client, and an unidentified drug which her client gave her to provide her with the courage of lions, she becomes dangerously inebriated and fails in an attempt to meet her ex lover,\n\nShe is rescued from the police by one of the artist's neighbors who is said to have once been a great singer but is now crazy. This woman met Ai only a few minutes earlier and told her that she used to be friends with the Gallery artist but it is over and that she considers Ai to be her \"best friend\".\n\nAi who is now sitting dirty and battered, looks at the photo of herself and her mother and destroys it signifying her move away from innocence and her past. In the next scene now clean, she studies the pink stone on her hand and has the faintest trace of a smile twitch across the corner of her mouth. She pulls her hair back as she looks at herself in the mirror and goes off to her usual routine which is also now her new life, externally the same as her old life but internally different as she has taken control, found herself with the future now belonging to her.\n\nThroughout the film, Ai's movements have been timid and stiff and her posture demure. After the credits there is a sequence of her dancing on stage boldly and fluidly thus finalizing her growth in to her new future.\n\nThere are at least two versions of ''Tokyo Decadence'', with the shorter one edited more for pacing than for [[censorship]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}{{clarify|date=July 2012}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Sadism and masochism in fiction]]\n*[[Ai No Shinsekai]]\n*[[New Tokyo Decadence \u2013 The Slave]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Nathaniel |title=DVD Delirium: The International Guide to Weird and Wonderful Films on DVD; Volume 1 Redux |orig-year=2002 |year=2006 |publisher=FAB Press |location=[[Godalming]], England |isbn=1-903254-39-6 |pages=697\u2013698}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0105622|title=Tokyo Decadence}}\n\n{{Ry\u016b Murakami}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:1990s pornographic films]]\n[[Category:BDSM in films]]\n[[Category:Censored films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ry\u016b Murakami]]\n[[Category:Pink films]]\n[[Category:1990s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
