Animation]] after the merger of [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] with [[Turner Broadcasting System]] on October 10, 1996. Turner Feature Animation had also produced the animated portions of Turner's ''[[The Pagemaster]]'' (1994). It is also the only Turner Feature Animation production to be co-produced by [[Warner Bros. Feature Animation]].\n\nThe film was the [[directorial debut]] of former Disney animator [[Mark Dindal]], and features the voices of [[Scott Bakula]], [[Jasmine Guy]], Matthew Herried, [[Ashley Peldon]], [[John Rhys-Davies]], [[Kathy Najimy]], [[Don Knotts]], [[Hal Holbrook]], [[Betty Lou Gerson]] (in her final film role), [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]], [[George Kennedy]] and Dindal. Its musical numbers were written by [[Randy Newman]] and includes [[Gene Kelly]]'s contributions as [[Choreography|choreographer]], before his death in 1996. The film was Kelly's final film project and is dedicated to his memory.\n\nSimilar to other Warner Bros. films at the time, it was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $3 million domestically due to lack of marketing and promotion. Despite this, the film received generally positive reviews, with praise for its animation, humor, characters, voice performances and musical numbers.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn 1939, in a world where humans and [[anthropomorphic]] animals coexist, Danny, an optimistic 18-year-old cat from [[Kokomo, Indiana]], travels to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] in hopes of starting an acting career there. After meeting a young penguin named Pudge, Danny is selected by agent Farley Wink to feature in a film that is in production at Mammoth Pictures called ''Li'l Ark Angel'', alongside Wink's secretary, a beautiful yet cynical female white cat named Sawyer. Upon joining fellow animals; Tillie the hippo, Cranston the goat, Frances the fish, and T.W the tortoise, Danny is dismayed on learning how minor his role is and tries to weasel his way into more time in the spotlight. Danny unwittingly ends up angering Darla Dimple, a popular yet [[spoiled child|spoiled]] [[child actress]] and star of the film; she promptly assigns her 36-foot tall [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]-like gorilla butler Max to intimidate Danny into no longer trying to enlarge his part.\n\nDanny learns from the studio's mascot Woolie that human actors are normally given more important roles than animals, whereas animals themselves end up getting minor and often thankless roles to the point of having little to no leverage in show business. Longing for the spotlight, Danny tries to make a plan that will encourage humans to provide animal actors with better scenarios; Danny's ideas include assembling a massive cluster of animals and putting on a musical performance for the humans.\n\nLater, Danny is given advice by Darla on how to interest and satisfy audiences. He takes this information to heart and groups the animals for an audition on the Ark, hoping to attract the humans' attention. However, Darla, fearing that the animals will jeopardize her spotlight, has Max help her flood the stage with 100,000 gallons of water while L.B. Mammoth, the head of Mammoth Pictures, and Flanigan, the film's director, are giving an interview, getting the animals blamed and dismissed for the collateral damage. The animals are depressed at being barred from acting in Mammoth Pictures, especially Danny, who was convinced by Darla that she was trying to help the animals. Woolie advises Danny to return to Kokomo. Later that night, everyone is at a diner, upset with Danny for ruining everything for them, while Sawyer sings a song about Danny trying to keep their dreams alive. Overhearing Sawyer singing, Tilly suggests Sawyer to follow Danny. Sawyer arrives to the bus stop, just seconds after Danny left, finding his hat and to-do list behind.\n\nHowever, after a comment from the bus driver and seeing Pudge wander the streets, Danny stops the bus and comes up with another plan. He secretly invites Sawyer, Woolie, Tillie, Cranston, Frances and T.W. to the premiere of ''Lil' Ark Angel''. After the screening and a battle with Max that sends Max flying away on a Darla Dimple balloon, Danny calls the audience's attention, only to be mocked by Darla. However, upon bringing Sawyer and the others backstage to help him and Pudge and after convincing them not to give up on their dreams no matter what the humans have said or done, the eight animals put on a musical performance that entertains and impresses the viewers. Meanwhile, Darla tries to sabotage the show by tampering with the set and special effects equipment, but her attempts instead cause her to enhance the performance.\n\nDarla furiously yells at the animals for foiling her plan when her voice is amplified over the theater's sound system due to a boom mic she had been tangled up with, unintentionally revealing the truth about the incident to the audience, including L.B. and Flanigan. Darla tries to hide her true colors by kissing and hugging Danny, but Pudge sends her down a trapdoor. The animals achieve their dreams for larger roles, Danny and Sawyer admit their feelings for each other, and Darla is demoted to a janitor.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Scott Bakula]] as Danny (speaking/singing), an ambitious, optimistically na\u00efve 18-year-old [[orange tabby]] from Kokomo, Indiana, who wishes to become a famous Hollywood star.\n* [[Jasmine Guy]] as Sawyer (speaking), a beautiful, but disenchanted sarcastic [[Turkish Angora]] [[secretary]] of Farley Wink and Danny's love interest, later girlfriend.\n** [[Natalie Cole]] as Sawyer's singing voice.\n* Matthew Herried as Peabo \"Pudge\" Pudgemyer, a little [[penguin]] and Danny's first friend who looks up to him as a big brother.

She conceals her anger and sinister nature from her fans and superiors through a facade of sweetness and innocence, and is willing to do anything to maintain her star status. She is referred to as \"America's sweetheart, lover of children and animals!\" Darla is a parody of [[Shirley Temple]] and [[Norma Desmond]].\n** [[Lindsay Ridgeway]] provides Darla's singing voice.\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Tillie Hippo (speaking/singing), a happy-go-lucky [[hippopotamus]] who tries to find the best in every situation.\n* [[John Rhys-Davies]] as Woolie the Mammoth, the aging [[African elephant]] who portrays the [[mascot]] for Mammoth Pictures. He originally came to Hollywood to write and perform music where he acts as a [[mentor]] to Danny upon befriending him.

He serves as the direct force that Darla physically lacks as a child. \n* [[Frank Welker]] as Farley Wink, a human agent for animals and Sawyer's boss, who talks quickly. He thinks Sawyer is cute despite the fact that she dislikes him.\n* [[David Johansen]] as [[Bus driver|Bus Driver]], a man whose insults towards the animals getting fired from Mammoth Studios inspire Danny with his last plan to give the animals their long-awaited stardom.\n* Larry Scholl (uncredited) as [[King Kong|Kong]], a [[gorilla]] who appears while Danny and Sawyer are going to the set of ''Li'l Ark Angel'' at Mammoth Studios.

Kershner felt the style would appeal to a wide audience. An old Hollywood backdrop also inspired the premise of anthropomorphic animals being allegories of those who did not look and/or sound mainstream struggling to gain attention in Hollywood in the early 20th century.<ref name = \"AboutProd\"/> \n\nKirschner contacted [[Mark Dindal]] to be director of the project a year after the two met and while Dindal was working on ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'' (1991).<ref name = \"AboutProd\"/> Around the same time, Brian McEntee joined as art director, [[Randy Newman]] joined as composer, and [[Gene Kelly]] joined as dance consultant.<ref name=\"AboutProd\"/> Dindal, Kirschner, and McEntee noticed the improving animation technology and were excited to see how it would be incorporated with [[traditional animation]] in ''Cats Don't Dance''; McEntee himself worked on [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)#Animation|the computer-animated ballroom scene]] in ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991).<ref name=\"AboutProd\"/> The team watched old musical films for reference before asking Kelly, who instantly joined due to his interest in the story.<ref name=\"AboutProd\"/> One meeting took place at Kelly's house between him and Dindal, and he vividly remembered how the films he starred in were choreographed.<ref name=\"AboutProd\"/> \n\nDuring production, management at Turner Feature Animation changed repeatedly and each head that came in attempted to take drastic revisions, including updating the setting to the 1950s rock-and-roll era. \"It's pretty hard to try and keep what you have finished so far, and then suddenly transition into a different period of time or introduce a different character or have a completely different ending that doesn't seem to fit the beginning you have,\" said Dindal.<ref name=\"cdd\" />\n\nDindal's portrayal of Max was initially a [[Studio recording#The process|scratch track]] and was never intended to be heard on the film. Dindal wanted Max to be voiced by a professional actor, but as the film started running out of money, he kept his own vocals in.<ref name=\"cdd\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nSteve Goldstein composed much of the score. For the film, [[Randy Newman]] composed songs inspired by the classic songs of the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]], including \"Danny's Arrival Song\", \"Little Boat On The Sea\", \"Animal Jam Session\", \"Big and Loud\", \"Tell Me Lies\", and \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\", while the opening and ending pop song \"Our Time Has Come\" was written by [[Martin Page]] and the end credits song \"I Do Believe\" was written by Simon Climie and Will Downing.
