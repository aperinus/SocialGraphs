The list had the vaguest parameters, and included as many as 57,000 to 91,000 non-felons, who were overwhelmingly people of color.<ref name=rhetoric/> On election day, these people were turned away at the polls.<ref name=billsmedia/> Since 90% of African Americans vote Democratic, this effectively reduced the number of votes for Democratic candidate [[Al Gore]].<ref name=rhetoric/>\n\n''Unprecedented'' also examines the Florida recount and the [[hanging chad]] controversy.<ref name=billsmedia/> It faults Gore for demanding a recount of only certain counties, instead of the whole state;<ref name=chicago/> and also presents evidence that the Republican Party paid staffers to create a disturbance and end the recount prematurely.<ref name=bostonglobe/>\n\nThe film then takes aim at the December 2000 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision that gave [[George W. Bush]] the presidency.<ref name=billsmedia/> The film documents  conflicts of interest that should have resulted in the recusal of two of the SCOTUS justices.<ref name=bostonglobe/>\n\nFinally, it explores the problems with electronic voting machines.<ref name=rhetoric/> It argues that the companies that make these machines do not allow audits of the machines (allegedly because of copyright and trademark issues), which leaves them wide open for fraud.<ref name=billsmedia/> The machines also do not give paper receipts, so there is no physical evidence in case of the need for a recount.<ref name=bostonglobe/>\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nIn the festival circuit, the film won eleven awards, including the Grand Festival award at the Berkley Film and Video Festival; the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary, and the Director's Award at the New York International Film Festival.<ref name=rhetoric/> It enjoyed a limited theatrical release<ref name=progressive/> and was broadcast internationally on cable.<ref name=unprecent>{{cite web | publisher=Unprecedented.org | url= http://www.unprecedented.org/UnprecedentedBroadcast.htm }}</ref> The DVD sold extremely well on [[Amazon.com]], coming in at 68 on their 2004 sales rank.<ref name=progressive/>  Liberal advocacy group [[MoveOn]] sold 25,000 copies in three days.<ref name=moviemaker>{{cite web | last=Thompson | first= Rustin| title=Robert Greenwald | publisher=MovieMaker | date= September 23, 2004 | url= http://www.moviemaker.com/articles-directing/robert-greenwald-2919/ }}</ref> ''Unprecedented'' was also viewed at screenings in homes and communities across the country, and was available streaming on the Internet.<ref name=moviemaker/>\n\nThis multi-tiered distribution model was revolutionary at the time.
