Its screenplay, by [[James Ivory]], who also co-produced, is based on the [[Call Me by Your Name (novel)|2007 novel of the same title]] by [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]]. The film is the final instalment in Guadagnino's thematic \"Desire\" trilogy, after ''[[I Am Love (film)|I Am Love]]'' (2009), and ''[[A Bigger Splash (2015 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' (2015). Set in 1983 in northern Italy, ''Call Me by Your Name'' chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, [[Elio Perlman]] ([[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]]), and Oliver ([[Armie Hammer]]), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father Samuel ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), an archaeology professor. The film also stars actresses [[Amira Casar]], [[Esther Garrel]], and [[Victoire Du Bois]].\n\nDevelopment began in 2007 when producers [[Peter Spears]] and [[Howard Rosenman]] [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] the rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory had been chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino had joined the project as a [[Location scouting|location scout]], and eventually became sole director and co-producer. ''Call Me by Your Name'' was financed by several international companies, and its [[principal photography]] took place mainly in the city and {{Lang|it|[[comune]]}} of [[Crema, Lombardy]], between May and June 2016. Cinematographer [[Sayombhu Mukdeeprom]] used [[35 mm movie film|35 mm film]], as opposed to employing [[digital cinematography]]. The filmmakers spent weeks decorating [[Villa Albergoni]], one of the main shooting locations. Guadagnino curated [[Call Me by Your Name: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|the film's soundtrack]], which features two original songs by American singer-songwriter [[Sufjan Stevens]].\n\n[[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired <!-- US-only? -->distribution rights to ''Call Me by Your Name'' before its premiere at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2017. The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on November 24, 2017, and went on general release on January 19, 2018. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Ivory's screenplay, Guadagnino's direction, Mukdeeprom's cinematography, and the performances of Chalamet, Hammer, and Stuhlbarg. The film garnered [[List of accolades received by Call Me by Your Name|a number of accolades]], including many for its screenplay, direction, acting, and music. It received four nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for 22-year-old Chalamet (the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Youngest nominees 2|third-youngest]] nominee in the category), and winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The screenplay also won at the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], and the [[70th Writers Guild of America Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the summer of 1983. [[Elio Perlman|Elio]], a 17-year-old Jewish Italo-French boy, lives with his parents in rural [[Northern Italy]]. Elio's father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old Jewish American graduate student, Oliver, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective [[bibliophile]] and a musician, initially thinks he has little in common with Oliver, who appears confident and carefree. Elio spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with his childhood friends, Chiara and Marzia. During a volleyball match, Oliver touches Elio's back but Elio brushes it off. However, Elio later finds himself jealous upon seeing Oliver pursue Chiara.\n\nElio and Oliver spend more time together, going for long walks into town, and accompanying Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio is increasingly drawn to Oliver, even sneaking to Oliver's room to smell his clothing. Elio eventually confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him they cannot discuss such things. Later, in a secluded spot, the two kiss for the first time. They do not speak for several days.\n\nElio goes on a date with Marzia and the two have sex. Elio leaves a note for Oliver to end their silence. Oliver writes back, asking Elio to meet him at midnight. Elio agrees and they sleep together for the first time. After, Oliver says to Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine\". The morning after, Elio cries about how little time he and Oliver have left together. Marzia confronts Elio after not hearing from him for three days. He responds coldly.\n\nAs the end of Oliver's stay approaches, Elio's parents, who appear to be aware of the bond between the two, recommend that he and Oliver visit [[Bergamo]] together before Oliver returns to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Elio, heartbroken after Oliver's departure, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio's feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio's father, observing his deep sadness, tells him he was aware of his relationship with Oliver and confesses to having had a similar relationship in his own youth. He urges Elio to learn from his grief and grow instead of moving on too quickly.\n\nDuring [[Hanukkah]], Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married to a woman he has been seeing for a few years. An upset Elio calls Oliver by his name and Oliver responds with his; Oliver also says that he remembers everything. After the call, Elio sits down by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reflecting, as his parents and staff prepare the holiday dinner.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Oliver\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as Elio Perlman\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Mr. Perlman{{efn|Mr. Perlman's first name is not given in the film's credits or in the source novel.
