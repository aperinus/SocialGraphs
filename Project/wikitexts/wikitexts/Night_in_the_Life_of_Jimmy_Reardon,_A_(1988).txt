It is based upon the novel ''Aren't You Even Gonna Kiss Me Goodbye?'', also by William Richert. The story centers on a high school graduate who must decide if he wants to go to [[business school]] at the request of his father, or go his own way and find a full-time job, while also deciding on who he wants to be in life and if he should leave his house.\n\n''A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon'' was filmed in 1986 and released in early 1988. The released film deviates considerably from the original [[director's cut]], which is now available under the title ''Aren't You Even Gonna Kiss Me Goodbye?''.\n\n== Plot summary ==\nIn a wealthy [[Chicago]] suburb during the early 1960s, middle-class Jimmy Reardon hangs out with his upper-class best friend, Fred Roberts, and sleeps with Fred's snobby girlfriend, Denise Hunter. He spends his time writing poetry and drinking coffee while he decides what to do after high school. His parents won't help him pay for tuition unless he attends the same business college as his father did, but Jimmy doesn't want to follow that path. Instead, he focuses on coming up with enough money for a plane ticket to go to [[Hawaii]] with his wealthy yet chaste girlfriend, Lisa Bentwright. On the night of a big party, Jimmy is given the task of driving home his mother's divorced friend, Joyce Fickett, who conveniently seduces him. Since he is late picking up Lisa, she goes to the dance with the rich Matthew Hollander, instead. Jimmy crashes the family car and then shares a rapprochement with his father.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[River Phoenix]] as Jimmy Reardon\n* [[Ann Magnuson]] as Joyce Fickett\n* [[Meredith Salenger]] as Lisa Bentwright\n* [[Ione Skye]] as Denise Hunter\n* [[Louanne Sirota]] as Suzie Middleberg\n* [[Matthew Perry]] as Fred Roberts\n* [[Paul Koslo]] as Al Reardon\n* [[Jane Hallaren]] as Faye Reardon\n* [[Jason Court]] as Mathew Hollander\n* [[James Deuter]] as Mr. Spaulding\n* [[Marji Banks]] as Emma Spaulding\n* [[Margaret Moore (actor)|Margaret Moore]] as Mrs. Bentwright\n* [[Anastasia Fielding]] as Elaine\n* [[Kamie Harper]] as Rosie Reardon\n* [[Johnny Galecki]] as Toby Reardon\n* [[Alan Goldsher]] as Musician #2\n\n== Release ==\nOn August 19, 1987, 20th Century Fox had acquired domestic theatrical distribution rights of the film from production company [[Island Records|Island Pictures]], with plans for a broad release early next year, and the possibility of other titles following in the future, which was originally granted to Island an August 28, 1987 date, but the screenings were cancelled, and the film caught the attention of Fox executives, whose production company Island Pictures already had done a video agreement with [[CBS/Fox Video]] to handle home video domestic distribution rights to its titles.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Greenberg |first=James |date=1987-08-19 |title=Fox To Release 'Jimmy Reardon', Island Cedes To Major Handling |pages=4, 32 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe film barely broke even at the box office, grossing a little over $6.2 million dollars against a $5 million dollar budget.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl728204801/weekend/ | title=A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon }}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a 33% rating based on 6 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/night_in_the_life_of_jimmy_reardon |title = A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon |website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> ''[[Time Out London|Time Out]]'' magazine wrote: \"While the film has the charm of rose-tinted retrospect and is often very funny, the pacing is wrong (it seems much longer than it is) and the sex scenes fail to convince.\"<ref>{{cite web |author1=EP |title=A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/63346/a_night_in_the_life_of_jimmy_reardon.html |website=[[Time Out London]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215921/https://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/63346/a_night_in_the_life_of_jimmy_reardon.html |archive-date=26 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' stated that the film has been \"Unjustly ignored by the vast majority of the critics and public\".<ref>[https://www.tvguide.com/movies/a-night-in-the-life-of-jimmy-reardon/review/2000029201/ ''TV Guide'']</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0095736|title=A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon}}\n* {{tcmdb title|443354|A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon}}\n* {{Amg movie|35276|A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Night In The Life Of Jimmy Reardon}}\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1988 drama films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:1980s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Bill Conti]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films directed by William Richert]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
