It follows a [[psychopath]] recently released from [[prison]] and is loosely based on real-life [[mass murderer]] [[Werner Kniesek]]. Though relatively obscure, the film was acclaimed for its camera work, score, and [[Erwin Leder]]'s performance. It was banned all over Europe for extreme violence in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McKendry|first1=Rebekah|title=Banned!: 10 Horror Movies You Weren't Supposed to See|url=http://www.blumhouse.com/2017/01/05/banned-10-horror-movies-you-werent-supposed-to-see/|website=blumhouse.com|access-date=28 June 2017|date=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAn unnamed [[serial killer]] is eager to kill again following his release from prison, driven by a desire to see the fear in the eyes of his victims. He stops by a diner, where he is tempted to attack two girls sitting at the counter but is unable to act on this inclination in public. In a taxi afterwards, he prepares to kill the female driver but is forced to flee when the driver becomes suspicious and stops the car. The killer comes across a house during his escape and breaks in. Inside, he finds an intellectually disabled man who uses a wheelchair. He mistakes the killer for his own father. Soon, the man's mother and sister arrive at the house, and the killer hides before eventually attacking them, taping the daughter to a doorknob and strangling the mother. He ties up the mother before dragging the son to the upstairs bathroom and drowning him in the bathtub.\n\nThe killer then returns downstairs to find that the mother is dead or near death. The daughter pleads with the killer to give her mother her medication; the killer complies, wishing to prevent the mother from dying before what he had planned. His attempts to revive her are futile and he pushes the wheelchair she is in into a wall in a rage.\n\nThe killer finds the daughter attempting to escape and chases her down. He stabs her to death, [[Vampirism|drinks her blood]], and vomits on her (the blood having acted as an [[emetic]]). He wakes up on her body the following morning, partially undressed and covered in blood. He decides to leave in the family's car and take the bodies with him in the trunk, intending to show the bodies to his new victims to frighten them (he also brings the family's dog, alive, in the passenger seat). The killer rear-ends another car during his frantic escape, and there are several witnesses to the incident.\n\nHe returns to the diner, the same patrons from earlier there once again, and as he feeds the dog, he is apprehended by the police, who ask for his registration. He then willingly opens the trunk of the car, reveling in the fear the sight of the bodies causes in the onlookers. The film ends as a voice-over of a medical record declares that the killer was driven by a sadistic tendency caused by his unstable childhood.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Steven|title=The Anti-Hannibal Hannibal|url=http://www.ce-review.org/01/22/kinoeye22_schneider.html|website=Central Europe Review|access-date=28 June 2017|date=18 June 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Erwin Leder]] as K., The Psychopath\n* Silvia Ryder as Daughter\n** Karin Springer as Daughter's voice\n* Edith Rosset as Mother\n** Josefine Lakatha as Mother's voice\n* Rudolf G\u00f6tz as Son\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Home media===\nIn 2012, ''Angst'' was released on Blu-ray in France under the title of ''Schizophrenia''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Angst Blu-ray (France)|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Angst-Blu-ray/42335/|website=blu-ray.com|access-date=28 June 2017}}</ref> In 2015, American distributor Cult Epics released the film on Blu-ray, DVD, and digitally, as well as giving the film a limited theatrical re-release in the United States.<ref>{{Citation|title=Angst Blu-ray|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=16941|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nDennis Schwartz from ''Ozus' World Movie Reviews'' gave the film a grade of A\u2212, commending the film's cinematography, score, and  Leder's performance.
