Boaz explains that, during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], the other soldiers in his unit knew he would not be able to shoot a human, so they gave him the job of shooting the dogs when they infiltrated a village at night so the animals would not alert the villagers to their presence, and he vividly remembers each of the 26 dogs he killed. Ari is surprised to find that, although he had also fought in the conflict during his stint as an infantry soldier in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], he recalls nothing of his deployment. Troubled by this, later that night he has a vision of his younger self and two other soldiers bathing at night in the water just off the coast of [[Beirut]] under the light of flares descending over the city. He recognizes the vision as being connected to the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]], but he cannot remember enough to put this fragment in context.\n\nEarly the next morning, Ari rushes off to see a childhood friend, who is a professional therapist. His friend advises him to seek out others who were in Beirut at the time of the massacre to gain a better understanding of what happened and, hopefully, revive his own memories. The friend further explains that, given the nature of human memory, the vision might not be an exact record of what actually occurred, though it certainly deals with matters of great importance to Ari's inner world.\n\nAri interviews friends and other soldiers who served in the war, as well as a psychologist specializing in [[PTSD]] and Israeli TV reporter [[Ron Ben-Yishai]], who was in Beirut covering the war when the massacre took place. Eventually, Ari's memories start to come back into focus, and he remembers that he \"was in the second or third ring\" of soldiers involved in the massacre, as his unit fired flares into the sky at night in support of the Israeli-allied [[Lebanese Christian]] [[Kataeb Party|Phalange]] militia while they perpetrated the massacre. While he did not know what the militia was up to until after they were finished, he concludes that the holes in his memory were a [[defense mechanism]], since his younger self had felt as responsible for the massacre as those who actually carried it out. The film ends with the animation dissolving into actual news footage of the aftermath of the massacre.\n\n==Cast==\nMost of the interview subjects look very similar in real life and in the film, but two of Ari Folman's friends asked that he have an actor rerecord their interviews and have the animators not base the design of their character on their actual appearance.\n* Ari Folman, an Israeli filmmaker who recently finished his [[military reserve]] service. Some twenty years before, he served in the IDF during the Lebanon War.\n* Boaz Rein-Buskila (voiced by Miki Leon), an accountant and Israeli Lebanon War veteran suffering from nightmares.\n* [[Ori Sivan]], an Israeli filmmaker who previously co-directed two films with Folman and is his long-time friend.\n* Carmi Can'an (voiced by [[Yehezkel Lazarov]]), an Israeli Lebanon War veteran who once was Folman's friend and now lives in the [[Netherlands]]. Carmi chose to be a combat soldier to prove his masculinity, but, in response to Folman's remark that he was expected to excel in science, testifies that, after the war, \"he could be nobody\".\n* Ronny Dayag, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran and high food engineer. During the war, he was a Merkava tank crewman. Dayag testifies that, as the only survivor of an ambush on his unit, he suffers from [[survivor's guilt]].\n* Shmuel Frenkel, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran who was in Ari Folman's infantry unit. By interviewing Frenkel, Folman learns he had repressed the fact that, at one point, his company were confronted by and killed a boy who had an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]. The title of the film comes from a scene in which the unit is under heavy fire and Frenkel forcefully takes another soldier's [[FN MAG|MAG]], goes into the open, and fires wildly, in \"some sort of trance\" as he \"waltzes\" between enemy bullets with [[Bashir Gemayel|Bashir's]] image on posters in the background.\n* Zahava Solomon, an Israeli psychologist and researcher in the field of [[psychological trauma]]. Zahava provides professional analysis for some events in the movie, using clinical terms. For example, she explains that Folman's confrontation with the boy with the RPG was forgotten because his brain used a defence mechanism called [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]. She further illustrates the mechanism with an example of a past patient of hers, who was a photographer in that war. At some point, his dissociation ceased to work and he lost his mind. \n* [[Ron Ben-Yishai]], an Israeli journalist who was the first to cover the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]].\n* Dror Harazi, an Israeli Lebanon War veteran. During the war, he commanded a tank that was stationed outside the [[Shatila refugee camp]] during the massacre.\n\n==Title==\n[[File:Chopin-waltz-op-64-no-2-in-c-sharp-minor.oga|thumbnail|Chopin's Waltz in C-sharp minor, Op. 64 no. 2, performed by L. Faulkner]]\nThe film takes its title from a scene in which Shmuel Frenkel, one of the interviewees and the commander of Folman's infantry unit at the time of the film's events, grabs a [[FN MAG|general purpose machine gun]] and \"dances an insane [[waltz]]\" (to the tune of [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Waltz in C-sharp minor, Op. 64, No. 2 (Chopin)|Waltz in C-sharp minor]]) amid heavy enemy fire on a Beirut street festooned with huge posters of [[Bachir Gemayel|Bashir Gemayel]]. The title also refers to Israel's short-lived political waltz with Bashir Gemayel as president of Lebanon.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98634515 | title=Dancing With Memory, Massacre In 'Bashir' | publisher=NPR | access-date=17 August 2019 | archive-date=17 August 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817181253/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98634515 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe film took four years to complete. It is unusual, as it is a feature-length [[Documentary film|documentary]] that, excluding one short segment of archival news footage at the end, consists entirely of [[animation]]. Stylistically, it combines [[classical music]], 1980s music, realistic graphics, and surrealistic scenes together with illustrations similar to [[comics]].\n\nThe animation, with its dark hues representing the overall feel of the film, uses a unique style invented by [[Yoni Goodman]] at the Bridgit Folman Film Gang studio in Israel. The technique is often confused with [[rotoscoping]], an animation style in which the drawings are done over live footage, but is actually a combination of [[Adobe Flash]] cutouts and classic animation.<ref>[http://www.dgdesignnetwork.com.au/dgdn/dg-magazine-131/waltz-with-bashir/ Waltz with Bashir] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622195620/http://www.dgdesignnetwork.com.au/dgdn/dg-magazine-131/waltz-with-bashir/ |date=22 June 2009 }}, [http://www.dgdesignnetwork.com.au DG Design] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225103623/http://www.dgdesignnetwork.com.au/ |date=25 February 2009 }}</ref> Each drawing was sliced into hundreds of pieces that were moved in relation to one another to create the illusion of movement.
