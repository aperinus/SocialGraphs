Filmed before a live audience at [[FirstOntario Concert Hall|Hamilton Place]], in [[Hamilton, Ontario]] in 1981, Cosby gives the audience his views ranging from marriage to parenthood. The film also showcases Cosby's conversational style of stand-up comedy. For most of the performance, Cosby is seated center-stage, only getting up to emphasize a joke.\n\nMany of the comedic routines presented in the film were precursors to Cosby's most popular sitcom, ''[[The Cosby Show]]''. An [[Himself (Bill Cosby album)|album of the same name]] was also released on [[Motown Records]].<ref name=\"amg\" /> The film was well regarded by comedians and critics, with some calling it \"the greatest stand up concert movie ever.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/humor/201306/bill-cosby-himself-30th-anniversary-june-2013 |title=Comedians Salute the Stand-Up Comedy Classic Bill Cosby: Himself |work=GQ }}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nNearly all of Cosby's routine concerns the trials and tribulations of parenting, frequently illustrated with anecdotes involving his own family. Occasionally, he compares these with stories from his childhood. Other themes include grandparents, going to the dentist (in which monologue he uses his \"Mushmouth\" speech pattern to imitate a dental patient anesthetized by Novocaine) and people who drink too much or take drugs.\n\n==Production==\nWritten, directed, and produced, by Bill Cosby, ''Himself'' is a live comedy performance film.<ref name=\"Canby\" /> It was made from the highlights of four shows at <!-- DO NOT RENAME, that's what it was called then -->[[FirstOntario Concert_Hall|Hamilton Place]] Performing Arts Center, Ontario in May 1981.<ref>{{cite web |date=2 March 1997 |title=SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO : New adventure in Robin's 'Hood' on TNT; a 1981 Cosby concert on Showtime |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-03-02-tv-33846-story.html |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |quote=1981, during a concert taped before a live audience in Ontario, Canada.

He said it was \"overlong\" and he found many of the anecdotes were not interesting. Nusair found Cosby's physical comedy to be an unnecessary distraction, from his excellent storytelling. He concludes that the show \"would probably be best enjoyed by those who are already fans of Cosby's unique style of comedy, as the movie isn't always accessible to newcomers.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=October 25, 2004 |title=Bill Cosby \"Himself\" (1982) - A Review by David Nusair |url=https://www.reelfilm.com/billcos.htm |website=Reelfilm.com }}</ref>\n\nRob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com reviewed the show in 2015 and gave it 3 out of 5, but was critical of Cosby for his judgmental style \"Too much of the film is Cosby passing judgment, as if comedy weren't good enough anymore; he also has to tell us a thing or two.\" He notes that by that point Cosby's reputation had been irrevocably damaged but \"Face it, he was always a dick.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Movie Review - Bill Cosby: Himself - eFilmCritic |url=https://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=2025&reviewer=416 |website=www.efilmcritic.com}}</ref> Josiah Hesse of [[Vulture.com]] reviewed the film in 2015 with the intention of trying to appreciate the work on its own terms, but despite calling it \"one of the greatest specials of all time\" and \"the nucleus of modern standup\" found it impossible to separate the work from the man and appreciate it objectively.<ref>{{cite web |date=9 September 2015 |first=Josiah |last=Hesse |title=I Tried To Watch Cosby's 'Himself' Objectively, and Failed |url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/09/i-tried-to-watch-cosbys-himself-objectively-and-failed.html |website=Vulture.com |publisher=[[New York Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n[[Rolling Stone]] listed it at #7 in its list of the 25 Best Stand-Up Specials.<ref>{{cite web |date=29 July 2015 |title=Divine Comedy: 25 Best Stand-Up Specials and Movies |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/divine-comedy-25-best-stand-up-specials-and-movies-70696/mitch-hedberg-comedy-central-presents-1998-228975/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref>\n\n== Home media ==\nThe film also saw success on home video, and by 1989 had already sold 350,000 units and was the number #1 best seller according to trade journal Home Video Publisher.
