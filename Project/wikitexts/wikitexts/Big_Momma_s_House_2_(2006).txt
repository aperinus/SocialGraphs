The film was directed by [[John Whitesell]] and starring [[Martin Lawrence]] reprising his role as [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Malcolm Turner, along with [[Nia Long]], [[Zachary Levi]], [[Mark Moses]], [[Emily Procter]], [[Kat Dennings]] and [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] in supporting roles. Like [[Big Momma's House|its predecessor]] and [[Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son|successor]], the film was panned by critics.\n\nUnlike the first film, ''Big Momma's House 2'' takes on a [[family friendly]] tone compared to the original film's more mature target [[demographic]].  The film was released theatrically on January 27, 2006, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It was a box office success and grossing $141.5 million against a budget of $40 million. A sequel ''[[Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son]]'', was released on February 18, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nSix years after meeting her during an investigation, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Malcolm Turner is now married to Sherry Pierce and the stepfather of her son Trent, and assumes a desk job to be close to her as they await the arrival of their first child. However, news reaches him that his friend Doug Hudson was killed, while working undercover in [[Orange County, California]]. Malcolm learns that Doug was investigating former military intelligence specialist Tom Fuller, who now works for the National Agenda Software corporation, and had discovered he was creating a computer worm that could provide backdoor access to government databases. Although he asks to assist, his boss refuses to let him interfere in the investigation being conducted by agents Liliana Morales and Kevin Keneally. Discovering Morales is sending an agent undercover to secure the job of nanny within Tom's family, Malcolm decides to take advantage of this, lying to Sherry that he must go out-of-state for a conference.\n\nMalcolm reprises his role as Sherry's estranged grandmother Hattie Mae Pierce - known affectionately as Big Momma - and secures the nanny job by exposing flaws in the other candidates. While he keeps his eyes on Tom, Malcolm learns that the Fuller family has problems: Tom's wife Leah is very strict on chores; eldest daughter Molly seeks to be someone she is not; youngest daughter Carrie strives to do well as a cheerleader; and toddler son Andrew has a habit of jumping off of tall objects. Although he finds evidence that Tom is working alongside a notorious hacker, Sherry tracks him down after discovering he lied to her and is heartbroken to discover he is working on a case. The matter is then made worse when Morales discover him interfering in her case, and allows him to assist as long as he maintains his cover and retains Kevin as his partner. After Leah threatens to fire Big Momma for her handling of her chores, Malcolm spends the night cleaning the house to win back her favor.\n\nAfter an attempt to capture the hacker fails, Malcolm and Kevin recruit assistance from child hacker Stewart to access Fuller's workstation at Agenda. While they secure the means, Malcolm receives a call from a frightened Molly at a nightclub, and goes to find her as Big Momma. Soon after, men working for Agenda's CEO Anthony Bishop take both of them hostage in order to coerce Tom to assist in a business deal involving the computer worm. Malcolm soon frees the pair before going to rescue Tom, while Molly calls for the FBI. Discovering that Bishop plans to kill Tom as part of the deal he made with his customer, Malcolm saves his life and ensures Bishop cannot escape before the FBI arrives. Although shocked to discover Malcolm's real identity, Tom is thankful to him when he informs Morales that he was being coerced by his boss under the threat of having his family killed for refusing.\n\nWhile the case is ended and he has made amends with Sherry, Malcolm decides stay in California and maintain his cover in order to assist Carrie, after helping her team improve themselves for an upcoming cheerleading championships. Helping them to successfully win, Malcolm eventually departs, leaving behind a letter from Big Momma explaining to the Fullers to enjoy their time together. He returns home to reunite with Sherry, Trent, and their newly born son named Doug.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Malcolm Turner / Hattie Mae \u2018Big Momma\u2019 Pierce\n* [[Nia Long]] as Sherry Pierce-Turner\n* [[Zachary Levi]] as Agent Kevin Keneally\n* [[Mark Moses]] as Tom Fuller\n* [[Emily Procter]] as Leah Fuller\n* [[Kat Dennings]] as Molly Fuller\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as Carrie Fuller\n* Preston Shores, Trevor Shores as Andrew Fuller\n* [[Marisol Nichols]] as Agent Liliana Morales\n* [[Jascha Washington]] as Trent Pierce\n* [[Sarah Joy Brown]] as Agent Constance Stone\n* [[Kevin Durand]] as Oshima\n* [[Cameron Daddo]] as Casal\n* [[Christopher Jones (actor, born 1982)|Christopher Jones]] as Anthony Bishop\n* [[Josh Flitter]] as Stewart\n* [[Max Van Ville]] as Chad\n* [[Rhoda Griffis]] as Mrs. Gallagher\n* [[Kirk B.R.
