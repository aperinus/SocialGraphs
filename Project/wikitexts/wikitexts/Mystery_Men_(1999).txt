Macy]], [[Greg Kinnear]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Paul Reubens]], [[Kel Mitchell]], [[Wes Studi]], [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Lena Olin]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Claire Forlani]], and [[Tom Waits]].\n\nThe film details the story of a team of lesser [[superhero]]es with unimpressive powers who are required to save the day. ''Mystery Men'' received generally positive reviews from critics, but was a [[box-office bomb]], only making a little over $33 million worldwide against a $68 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn Champion City, the amateur [[superhero]] team of Mr. Furious, the Shoveler and the Blue Raja attempt to make a name for themselves, but their inexperience, infighting, and dubious abilities generally result in defeat and frustration. While trying to stop a robbery in progress, they are upstaged by the city's powerful and arrogant superhero, Captain Amazing. However, Amazing's crime fighting prowess has practically made his job obsolete. Without any worthy adversaries (most are either dead, in exile, or in jail), his corporate sponsors are beginning to withdraw support.\n\nTo create a need for his services, Amazing uses his [[alter ego]], billionaire lawyer Lance Hunt, to argue for the release of his nemesis, [[supervillain]] Casanova Frankenstein, from an [[insane asylum]]. However, the plan backfires; once released and reunited with his henchman Tony P and his Disco Boys, Casanova Frankenstein blows up the asylum, easily outwits and captures Amazing, and prepares to unleash the \"Psycho-frakulator\", which lethally bends reality, on the city.\n\nOn a stakeout of Casanova Frankenstein's mansion, Mr. Furious observes Amazing's capture and informs his team. After an unsuccessful rescue attempt, the three realize that they need more allies. Through word-of-mouth and auditions they recruit Invisible Boy, the Spleen, and the Bowler. The emboldened team ambush Casanova's limousine, but merely succeed in annoying him. While drunk from celebrating their \u201cvictory,\u201d the team is nearly killed in retaliation by Tony P and the Disco Boys. They are saved by the Sphinx, an enigmatic superhero who agrees to train them. The Sphinx's unconventional team-building exercises and [[antimetabole]] rhetoric annoy Mr. Furious, who quits the group, but the others flourish under his tutelage. Knowing that they will still be outgunned, the group seek out Doc Heller, who specializes in non-lethal weaponry, to equip them for their battle. Furious, encouraged by his new girlfriend, Monica, rejoins the team.\n\nThe team break into Casanova's mansion during a summit of several of the city's gangs; but, while attempting to free Captain Amazing, they inadvertently set off the Psycho-frakulator and kill him. Without Amazing, the team despairs of saving the city, but the Shoveler delivers a pep talk that succeeds in uniting and inspiring them. This pep talk alludes to the [[St Crispin's Day Speech|St Crispin\u2019s Day Speech]] from Henry V by Shakespeare.  With new resolve, the team assaults the mansion again. This time, through a mix of surprise, teamwork, maximizing their quasi-superpowers, and Heller's quirky weapons, they subdue Casanova Frankenstein's henchmen. But Casanova Frankenstein holds Monica hostage and activates the Psycho-frakulator, which begins to wreak havoc upon the city. While the team works to disable the device, Mr. Furious takes on Casanova Frankenstein, unleashes his inner rage and fights effectively for the first time. Casanova Frankenstein is thrown into the core of the Psycho-frakulator and killed by its reality-bending powers. The rest of the team helps The Bowler to destroy the device and escape the mansion as it implodes.\n\nThe team is swarmed by reporters who want to know the group's name. As they argue possible names among themselves, one reporter states, \"Well, whatever you may call them, Champion City will forever owe a debt of gratitude to these 'Mystery Men',\" but the others are too busy arguing to hear it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Roy / Mr. Furious, a superhero whose power is his rage.\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Jeffery / The Blue Raja, a superhero who uses cutlery, but never knives, with great accuracy.\n* [[William H.

Because everybody kind of wanted to personalize their part, and try to make it as funny as possible. So yeah, that was welcome. That was the idea we had going in, to just have everybody kind of get together and try to make it as funny as we could. Especially in the context of a big action, special effects type movie. You know, a lot of the time what gets lost is the specific character stuff, and the small moments that really have to work for the whole thing to work. So that's what we were concentrating on as much as possible. And it's good if everybody's on board with that, you know what I mean?
