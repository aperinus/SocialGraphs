It is the sequel to the 1992 film ''[[Sister Act]]'', and is loosely based on the life of Crenshaw High School choir instructor [[Iris Stevenson]]. The story sees [[Whoopi Goldberg]] reprising her role as Deloris van Cartier, as she finds herself coming to the aid of her nun friends who need her help to save her old school.

During her latest performance, she is reunited with her friends, Sisters Mary Patrick, Mary Robert, and Mary Lazarus, who are in the audience. They have come to Las Vegas to beg her assistance.\n\nDeloris meets with another old friend, the Reverend Mother, who explains that the convent nuns now teach at the St. Francis Academy in [[San Francisco]]. Coincidentally, Deloris attended this school in her childhood. The school faces closure unless its reputation can be improved. The nuns ask her to reprise her persona as Sister Mary Clarence and become the new music teacher. She reluctantly agrees.\n\nAt the school, Mary Clarence meets the school's staff of friars, led by the humble but inept Father Maurice, and the [[diocese]] administrator, Mr. Crisp, who wants the school to close, so he may receive early retirement. She attends her first music class, meeting the rowdy teenagers, who attend the class with the expectation of receiving an easy \"A\". Mary Clarence butts heads with ringleader, Rita Louise Watson. Rita walks out when Mary Clarence informs the students that they will have to earn their grades. The other students stay to avoid failure. When they break into spontaneous, synchronized singing, Mary Clarence is inspired to turn them into a [[choir]]. Initially, the students are dismayed and object to her proposal.\n\nMary Robert overhears Rita's talented singing. She recommends that Mary Clarence convince Rita to return to class. Students, nuns and friars work to restore the school's decrepit music room, and the class begins to practice extensively. They perform \"Oh, Happy Day\" before the whole school, led by Ahmal, a talented vocalist. The nuns discover numerous trophies, revealing the school won the All-State Choir Championship multiple times in the past, and decide to enter them once again. Father Maurice allows it, as long as they raise the money themselves and each student has a signed parental permission slip.\n\nRita's strict but well-meaning mother Florence refuses to let her attend, believing a musical career is a dead end as her husband died trying to chase fame. However, Rita forges her mother's signature to attend, leaving an apology note for her disobedience, prompting Florence to drive to Hollywood to see the competition. Mr. Crisp discovers a magazine in the school library with Deloris Van Cartier on the cover. Recognizing her as Mary Clarence, he warns Father Maurice of the sham. The choir has already left for the competition, so the friars pile into their old van and race to confront Mary Clarence.\n\nBackstage at the competition, the choir are intimidated by the other entrants and consider quitting, but Mary Clarence inspires them to persevere. The friars arrive, and Father Maurice decides to support the choir upon seeing their enthusiasm. The other friars trap Mr. Crisp in a closet to prevent him from interfering. The choir takes to the stage, Rita performing a solo before the choir perform an [[urban contemporary gospel]] rendition of \"[[Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee|Joyful, Joyful]]\", with [[hip hop]] choreography.\n\nThe choir wins the competition. Impressed with the performance, the school's local [[diocese]] agrees to keep the school open. To thwart Mr. Crisp, the Reverend Mother states that the competition entry was his idea, and that the diocese must have another \"hot spot\" position for him...\"we cannot let such a prize bull be put out to pasture\".\n\nRita and Florence make amends, while the choir learns Mary Clarence is actually a professional singer. They ask her if she is a Las Vegas [[showgirl]], to which she claims she has never been such, but is a \"headliner\".\n\nThe end credits feature the film's cast performing \"[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] \u2013 Deloris Van Cartier / Sister Mary Clarence\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] \u2013 Sister Mary Patrick\n* [[Wendy Makkena]] \u2013 Sister Mary Robert\n* [[Mary Wickes]] \u2013 Sister Mary Lazarus\n* [[Lauryn Hill]] \u2013 Rita Louise Watson\n* [[Maggie Smith]] \u2013 Reverend Mother\n* [[Barnard Hughes]] \u2013 Father Maurice\n* [[James Coburn]] \u2013 Mr. Crisp\n* [[Michael Jeter]] \u2013 Father Ignatius\n* [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]] \u2013 Florence Watson\n* [[Robert Pastorelli]] \u2013 Joey Bustamente\n* [[Thomas Gottschalk]] \u2013 Father Wolfgang\n* [[Brad Sullivan]] \u2013 Father Thomas\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] \u2013 Maria\n* [[Ryan Toby]] \u2013 Wesley Glen \"Ahmal\" James\n* Ron Johnson \u2013 Richard \"Sketch\" Pincham\n* Tyse Saffuri \u2013 Choir Member\n* [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] \u2013 Margaret\n* Devin Kamin \u2013 Frankie\n* Christian Fitzharris \u2013 Tyler Chase\n* [[Tanya Blount]] \u2013 Tanya\n* Mehran Marcos Sedghi \u2013 Marcos\n* [[Erica Campbell (musician)|Erica Atkins]] \u2013 Competing Choir\n* [[Deondray Gossett]] \u2013 Classroom Kid\n* [[Monica Calhoun]] \u2013 Classroom Kid\n* [[Deedee Magno Hall]] \u2013 Classroom Kid\n* David Kater \u2013 Classroom Kid\n* Valeria Andrews \u2013 Classroom Kid\n* [[Riley Weston]] \u2013 Classroom Kid\n* [[Pat Crawford Brown]] \u2013 Choir Nun\n* Sheri Cladd \u2013 Uncredited Nun\n* [[Alexandrea Martin]] \u2013 Classroom Kid\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was not as successful as ''[[Sister Act]]''.
