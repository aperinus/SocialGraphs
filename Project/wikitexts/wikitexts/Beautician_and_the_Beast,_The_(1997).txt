It tells the story of a New York City [[beautician]] who is hired, under the false assumption that she is a science teacher, to tutor the four children of a dictator of a fictional [[Eastern European]] nation, played by [[Timothy Dalton]]. The film deals with the theme of cultural differences, and takes inspiration from other stories like ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. Produced by Drescher's company High School Sweethearts in partnership with [[Paramount Pictures]], ''The Beautician and the Beast'' was her first starring role in a film.\n\nDrescher chose Graff to write the screenplay because of his familiarity with her style of humor. She pitched and sold the project as a vehicle to transition her career in television to film. Filming took place during the fall of 1996 in [[Greystone Mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], and [[Sychrov Castle]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. Kwapis consulted with [[dialect coach]] Francie Brown to create the [[fictional language]] Slovetzian used in the film. [[Cliff Eidelman]] composed the soundtrack which features the [[London Metropolitan Orchestra]].\n\n''The Beautician and the Beast'' was released on February 7, 1997, to generally negative reviews. Critics panned the story as more appropriate for a [[sitcom]] rather than a feature film, and called it a poor example of the romantic comedy genre. Drescher and Dalton received mixed reviews for their performances; Drescher was nominated for the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]]. ''The Beautician and the Beast'' was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing roughly $11.5 million against a production budget of $16 million.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with an [[Animation|animated]] sequence in which a prince [[Suspended animation in fiction|awakens]] a princess with a kiss, though she rejects his romantic advances and runs away. The scene shifts to [[live action]] [[beautician]] Joy Miller, who teaches at a New York City [[Beauty School|beauty school]]. One of her students accidentally sets the classroom ablaze by igniting [[hair spray]] with a cigarette. She escorts her class and some caged animals to safety, prompting the ''[[New York Post]]'' to run a headline praising Joy as a hero. Ira Grushinsky, a diplomat from the [[Eastern European]] country Slovetzia, mistakes Joy for a science teacher after seeing a newspaper photo. He hires her as a tutor for the four children of Boris Pochenko, Slovetzia's dictator. However, she misinterprets his job offer as teaching hairstyling. Although she has never heard of the country, she accepts the job despite her initial hesitation. After arriving at Slovetzia, Ira is surprised to discover Joy's true identity, but she convinces him to keep it a secret.\n\nDespite making a bad first impression with Boris, Joy gets along with his children Katrina, Karl, Masha, and Yuri. While teaching them about life outside Slovetzia, she also helps them to gain confidence in themselves. She learns about Katrina's relationship with Alek, the leader of the youth rebellion, and encourages Karl to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. Joy frequently clashes with Pochenko, who is disturbed by her independence and his inability to frighten her. Joy and Katrina go to a [[nightclub]] which also operates as a base for those planning the rebellion; [[Prime Minister]] Leonid Kleis follows the pair and arrests Alek.\n\nGrowing closer to Joy, Boris confesses to her that he wants to change his reputation as a \"beast\" among [[Western world|Western nations]]; she encourages him to form closer relationships with his citizens and shaves his mustache. During a trip to a factory, Joy realizes that Slovetzia lacks [[trade union]]s and encourages the workers to hold a [[General strike|strike]]. She also arranges a secret meeting between Katrina and Alek in his cell. Despite Leonid's advice to fire Joy, she convinces Boris to hold a party for visiting emissaries during a summit meeting to debut his new image; he places her in charge of the preparations. As part of the summit, Boris considers releasing Alek despite Leonid's disapproval. On the day of the event, Joy reveals her identity to Boris, but he does not care about her credentials. He thanks her for bringing happiness to him and his family.\n\nDuring the party, Leonid confronts Joy about her role in Katrina's secret meetings with Alek and threatens to have her arrested for [[treason]]. Following Boris' decision to keep Alek in jail, Joy informs him that she had set up meetings between Alek and Katrina; he argues with Joy over her meddling in Slovetzia's political affairs. She quits and returns to New York City. Over the course of several weeks, Leonid quietly takes over administrative duties and signs death sentences in Boris' name. When Ira informs Boris that Leonid is usurping his power, he strips Leonid of his duties and arrests him on charges of treason. Boris reunites with Joy in New York City and informs her that he has freed Alek and agreed to hold free elections in Slovetzia. Boris kisses Joy after admitting his feelings for her.\n\n==Cast==\nCast list adapted from [[Rotten Tomatoes]]:<ref name=\"SourceRT\">{{Cite web |title=The Beautician and the Beast |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beautician_and_the_beast/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205024937/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beautician_and_the_beast/ |archive-date=December 5, 2017}}</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Fran Drescher]] as Joy Miller, a beautician from New York City.
