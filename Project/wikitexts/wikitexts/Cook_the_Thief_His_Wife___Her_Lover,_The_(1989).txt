An international co-production of the United Kingdom and France, the film's graphic violence and [[Nudity in film|nude]] scenes, as well as its lavish [[cinematography]] and [[Formalist film theory|formalism]], were noted at the time of its release.\n\n== Plot ==\nEnglish [[gangster]] Albert Spica has taken over the high-class Le Hollandais restaurant, which is managed by French [[chef]] Richard Boarst. Spica makes nightly appearances at the restaurant with his retinue of thugs. His oafish behavior causes frequent confrontations with the staff and his own customers, whose patronage he loses but whose money he seems not to miss.\n\nForced to accompany Spica is his reluctant yet elegant wife, Georgina, who soon catches the eye of a quiet regular at the restaurant: bookshop owner Michael. Under her husband's nose, with the help of the restaurant staff, Georgina carries on an affair with Michael. Ultimately Spica learns of the affair, forcing Georgina to hide out at Michael's book depository. Boarst sends food to Georgina through his young employee Pup, a [[boy soprano]] who sings while working. Spica tortures the boy before finding the bookstore's location written in a book the boy is carrying. Spica's men storm Michael's bookshop while Georgina is visiting the boy in hospital. They torture Michael to death by force-feeding him pages from his books. Georgina discovers his body when she returns.\n\nOvercome with rage and grief, she begs Boarst to cook Michael's body, and he eventually complies. Together with all the people that Spica wronged throughout the film, Georgina confronts her husband finally at the restaurant and forces him at gunpoint to eat a mouthful of Michael's cooked body. Spica obeys, gagging. Georgina then shoots him in the head, calling him a cannibal.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Richard Bohringer]] as Richard Boarst, \"The Cook\": The head chef of \"Le Hollandais\".

Due to the content, the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] gave Miramax a choice of either an [[X rating]] or go unrated (adults only) for theatrical release. Unrated was chosen in light of the X rating being more associated with pornographic films. Two versions of the film were released on [[VHS]] in the 1990s. One was an R-rated cut running 95 minutes (mainly for large video store chains); the other was the original version.\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics.

The album includes the first commercially released recording of Nyman's composition \"Memorial\".\n\nThere is some music not included on the soundtrack album: the love theme for Michael and Georgina, which is \"Fish Beach\" from ''[[Drowning by Numbers]]'', the song performed as a show in the restaurant, sung by actress and singer Flavia Brilli, or a doubly pulsed variation of \"Memorial\" that occurs about halfway through the film. Edits of \"Memorial\" appear throughout the film, with the entire twelve-minute movement accompanying the final scene and end credits, but one variation is uniquely created for the film.\n\n== References to Flemish Baroque painting ==\n[[File:Frans Hals - Banket van de officieren van de Sint-Joris-Doelen.jpg|thumb|''The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616'' by Frans Hals]]\n\nThe filming is inspired by [[Flemish Baroque painting]] as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] or [[Anthony van Dyck]].
