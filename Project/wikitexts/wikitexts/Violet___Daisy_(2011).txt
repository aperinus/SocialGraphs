Fletcher|Geoffrey Fletcher]] in his directorial debut. The film stars [[Saoirse Ronan]], [[Alexis Bledel]], [[Danny Trejo]], [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]], and [[James Gandolfini]] in one of his last acting roles before his death on June 19, 2013. Supporting roles are performed by [[John Ventimiglia]], [[Danny Hoch]], and [[Tatiana Maslany]]. ''Violet & Daisy'' follows two teenage assassins named Violet and Daisy who accept what they think will be a quick-and-easy job, until an unexpected target throws them off their plan.\n\n''Violet & Daisy'' was released on September 15, 2011, at the Toronto International Film Festival and was given a limited theatrical release on June 7, 2013. Geoffrey S. Fletcher credits ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', and ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'' as inspiration for this film.\n\n''Violet & Daisy'' was also adapted for the stage and performed at [[The New School]] in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nViolet ([[Alexis Bledel]]) and Daisy ([[Saoirse Ronan]]) are a pair of gum-chewing young assassins who casually snuff out crime figures in New York City, distracted only by the fact that a concert by their favorite pop idol Barbie Sunday has suddenly been canceled.\n\nDetermined to raise cash to buy a pair of the newest Barbie Sunday dress, the duo takes on a new hit job offered to them by their handler Russ ([[Danny Trejo]]). The target is a mysterious unnamed loner ([[James Gandolfini]]) who stole from rival boss, Donnie. A sudden and unexpected empathy after finding out about their quite unusual mark's pancreatic cancer and the estrangement from his daughter leads the two girls into an unexpected journey of self-examination, catapulting the junior enforcers into a world beyond their deadly routine, all while encountering dangerous foes such as rival boss Donnie's crew of hitmen and rapists or the legendary assassin simply known as Number 1 ([[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]]), who's said to have once killed three ninjas with a fingernail file.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as Daisy\n* [[Alexis Bledel]] as Violet\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as The Guy\n* [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] as Number 1\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Russ\n* Lynda Gravatt as Dolores\n* [[Tatiana Maslany]] as April\n* [[Cody Horn]] as Barbie Sunday\n* [[John Ventimiglia]] as Man #1\n* Stu \"Large\" Riley as Man #2\n* Neville Archambault as Man #3\n* [[Danny Hoch]] as Man #4\n* Tuffy Questell as Kidnapped Man\n* Nick Choksi as Desk Officer\n* Gary Hope as Hardware Store Cashier\n* Chris Columbo as Hardware Store Perp\n* Bettye Fletcher as Doll Hospital Matron \n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\n[[Bruce Willis]] was considered for the role of The Guy before [[James Gandolfini]] was cast.
