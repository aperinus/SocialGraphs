(novel)|the 1984 novel]] by former [[U.S. Secret Service]] agent [[Gerald Petievich]], who co-wrote the screenplay with Friedkin. The film features [[William Petersen]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[John Pankow]] among others. [[Wang Chung (band)|Wang Chung]] composed and performed the [[To Live and Die in L.A. (soundtrack)|original music soundtrack]]. The film tells the story of the lengths to which two Secret Service agents go to arrest a [[Counterfeit#Counterfeiting of money|counterfeiter]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plots are 400 to 700 words only-->\nAfter a terrorist assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]], Richard Chance and Jimmy Hart are [[United States Secret Service]] agents assigned as [[counterfeiting]] investigators in its [[Los Angeles]] field office. Chance has a reputation for reckless, impulsive behavior and, unbeknownst to his superiors in the Service is also corrupt, while Hart is three days away from retirement. Alone, Hart stakes out a warehouse in the desert thought to be a print house of [[counterfeiter]] and [[artist]] Eric \"Rick\" Masters. After Masters and Jack, his bodyguard, kill Hart, Chance explains to his new partner, John Vukovich, that he will take Masters down no matter what.\n\nThe two agents attempt to get information on Masters by putting one of his criminal associates, attorney Max Waxman, under [[surveillance]]. Vukovich falls asleep on watch, and consequently they fail to catch Masters in the act of murdering Waxman who had crossed him. While Vukovich wants to go by the book, Chance becomes increasingly reckless and unethical in his efforts to catch Masters. Chance relies on his sexual-[[extortion]] relationship with parolee/informant Ruth for information, while Vukovich meets privately with Masters' associates, including attorney Bob Grimes whom he attempts to turn. Grimes, acknowledging a potential conflict of interest that could ruin his legal practice, agrees to set up a meeting between his client and the two agents posing as doctors from Palm Springs interested in Masters' counterfeiting services. Masters is reluctant to work with them, but ultimately agrees to print them $1 million worth of fake bills.\n\nIn turn, Masters demands $30,000 in [[down payment|front money]], which is three times the authorized agency limit for buy money. To get the cash, Chance persuades Vukovich to aid him in robbing Thomas Ling, a man whom Ruth previously told Chance is bringing in $50,000 cash to purchase stolen diamonds. Chance and Vukovich intercept Ling at [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] and seize the cash in an industrial area under [[Vincent Thomas Bridge]]. Ling's cover people follow them and while  observing the robbery, open fire and accidentally kill Ling. Chance and Vukovich try to evade them through the streets, freeways and even one of the flood control channels, before a final escape by going the wrong way on the freeway. The next day, the end of their daily briefing includes an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] bulletin that Ling was its undercover agent, kidnapped, robbed and murdered while on a [[sting operation]]. Only a generic description of the assailants and their vehicle is given. While Chance and Vukovich did not kill Ling, Vukovich is nonetheless consumed by guilt, while Chance is apathetic and focused solely on getting Masters. Unable to persuade Chance to come clean about their role in Ling's death, Vukovich meets with Grimes, who advises him to turn himself in and testify against Chance in exchange for a lighter sentence. Vukovich refuses to implicate his partner. Chance sets up the buy with Masters, who seems to hint he is aware of the heist.\n\nChance and Vukovich meet with Masters for the exchange. After inspecting the counterfeit million, the agents attempt to arrest Masters and Jack, but Jack pulls a shotgun. Jack and Chance fatally shoot each other, and Masters escapes. Vukovich gives chase, going to a warehouse a previous informant had told him about. By the time he arrives, Masters has set fire to everything inside, destroying all evidence. Vukovich confronts Masters and during a brief struggle, Masters asks Vukovich why he did not take Grimes' advice to turn his partner in, revealing that Grimes was working on Masters' behalf all along. While Vukovich is stunned at the revelation, Masters grabs a board and knocks him unconscious. Masters then covers Vukovich with shredded paper and is about to set him on fire when Vukovich comes round and shoots Masters. Masters drops his lighter and accidentally sets himself ablaze. Vukovich shoots the burning man, continuing to pull the trigger of his empty gun as Masters burns alive.\n\nDressed more casually, Vukovich visits Ruth as she packs up to leave L.A. He mentions Chance's death, suggesting she had known all along that Ling was FBI and she had played Chance. He knows Chance left her with the remaining cash, the agency now wants back, but Ruth says she needed it to pay debts. Vukovich declares that Ruth is now working for him, turning into the same \"whatever it takes\" agent that his partner was, and stopping her efforts to escape her shady life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[William Petersen]] as Secret Service Agent Richard Chance\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Eric \"Rick\" Masters\n* [[John Pankow]] as Secret Service Agent John Vukovich\n* [[Debra Feuer]] as Bianca Torres\n* [[John Turturro]] as Carl Cody\n* [[Darlanne Fluegel]] as Ruth Lanier\n* [[Dean Stockwell]] as Bob Grimes\n* [[Steve James (actor)|Steve James]] as Jeff Rice\n* [[Robert Downey Sr.]] as Senior Secret Service Agent Thomas Bateman\n* [[Michael Greene]] as Secret Service Agent Jimmy Hart\n* Jack Hoar as Jack\n* [[Christopher Allport]] as Max Waxman\n* [[Valentin de Vargas]] as Judge Filo Cedillo\n* [[Dwier Brown]] as Dr. Newman\n* Michael Chong as Thomas Ling / FBI Special Agent Raymond Fong\n* [[Gerald Petievich]] as Himself\n* [[Jane Leeves]] as Serena\n* Jacqueline Giroux as Claudia Leith\n* [[Dar Robinson]] as FBI Special Agent Conrad\n* [[Thomas F.

Half a page into his reading, Friedkin told him he had the part. The actor was drawn to the character of Chance as someone who had a badge and a gun and how it not only made him above the law, but also \"above life and death in his head\".<ref name= \"Arick\"/> The actor found the experience of being this character and making the film \"amazing\" and \"intoxicating\".<ref name= \"Arick\"/> He called fellow Chicago actor John Pankow and brought him to Friedkin's apartment the day after being cast as Chance, recommending him for the role of Vukovich. The director agreed on the spot.<ref name= \"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|226}}\n\nFormer [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and author Gerald Petievich, who wrote the book the film is based on, appears in a cameo as a fellow Secret Service agent.\n\n===Screenplay===\nThe basic plot, characters, and much of the dialogue of the film is drawn from Petievich's novel, but Friedkin added the opening terrorist sequence, the car chase, and clearer, earlier focus on the showdown between Chance and Masters.<ref name=\"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|230}} Petievich said that Friedkin wrote a number of scenes but when there was a new scene or a story in need to be changed, he wrote it. The director admits that Petievich created the characters and situations and that he used a lot of dialogue but that he wrote the screenplay, not Petievich.<ref name= \"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|230}}\n\n===Principal photography===\nThe director wanted to make an independent film and collaborate with people who could work fast, like cinematographer [[Robby M\u00fcller]] and his handpicked crew who were non-union members.<ref name= \"Arick\"/> Friedkin shot everything on location and worked quickly, often using the first take to give a sense of immediacy. He did not like to rehearse but would create situations where the actors thought they were rehearsing a scene when actually they were shooting a take. Friedkin did this just in case he got something he could use. To this end, he let scenes play out and allowed the actors to stay in character and improvise.<ref name= \"Arick\"/> For example, during the scene where Chance visits Ruthie at the bar where she works, Friedkin allowed Petersen and actress Darlanne Fluegel to devise their own blocking and told M\u00fcller, \"Just shoot them. Try and keep them in the frame. If they're not in the frame, they're not in the movie. That's their problem.\"<ref name=\"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|231}}\n\nThe shot of Petersen running along the top of the dividers between the terminal's moving sidewalk at the Los Angeles International Airport got the filmmakers into trouble with the airport police.<ref name= \"Arick\"/> The airport had prohibited this action, mainly for Petersen's safety, as they felt that their insurance would not have covered him had he hurt himself. The actor told Friedkin that they should do the stunt anyway so the director proposed that they treat it like a rehearsal but have the cameras rolling and shoot the scene, angering airport officials.<ref name= \"Arick\"/>\n\nThe counterfeiting montage looks authentic because Friedkin consulted actual counterfeiters who had done time. The \"consultant\" actually did the scenes that do not show actor Willem Dafoe on camera to give this sequence more authenticity<ref name= \"Arick\"/> even though the actor learned how to print money.<ref name= \"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|233}} Over one million dollars of counterfeit money was produced but with three deliberate errors so that it could not be used outside the film. The filmmakers burned most of the fake money but some leaked out, was used, and linked back to the production. The son of one of the crew members tried to use some of the prop money to buy candy at a local store and was caught.<ref name=\"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|234}} Three FBI agents from Washington, D.C. interviewed 12\u201315 crew members including Friedkin, who screened the workprint for them. He offered to show the film to the Secretary of the Treasury and take out anything that was a danger to national security. That was the last he heard from the government.<ref name= \"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|234}}\n\nThe wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway sequence was one of the last things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot.<ref name= \"Arick\"/> At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped-down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago.<ref name= \"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|234}} He fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator [[Buddy Joe Hooker]] that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed-out reactions were real.<ref name= \"Arick\"/> Three weekends were spent on sections of the [[Terminal Island Freeway]] near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase.<ref name=\"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|234\u2013235}} With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.<ref name=\"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|235}}\n\nAdding to the chaotic feeling of the chase, Friedkin staged it so that the freeway traffic flow was reversed. That is that the normal traffic in the scene has the drivers driving on their left in the left hand lanes (as in Britain) while the cars driving against the flow were driving on their right (as would be usual in North America).\n\nIn reference to a sex sequence between [[William Petersen]] and [[Darlanne Fluegel]], director William Friedkin revealed to have told the actors to \"make it as real as possible. Make it real\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Counterfeit World: Making To Live and Die in L.A. |work=www.youtube.com |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjmQE1AwPqY |access-date=19 February 2022 }}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nAs early as the day he cast Petersen, Friedkin thought about killing off Chance towards the end of the film, but according to editor Bud Smith, Vukovich was supposed to be the one who was killed.<ref name=\"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|232}} The climactic scene in which Chance is killed was not very well received by MGM executives, who found it to be too negative.<ref name= \"Arick\"/> To satisfy the studio heads, he shot a second ending, in which Chance survives the shotgun blast and, presumably as an internal punishment, he and Vukovich are transferred to a remote Secret Service station in Alaska, and watch their boss Thomas Bateman being interviewed on television.<ref name= \"Arick\"/> Friedkin previewed the alternate ending and kept the original.<ref name=\"Segaloff1990\"/>{{rp|233}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box-office===\n''To Live and Die in L.A.'' premiered in the United States on November 1, 1985 in 1,135 screens where it grossed $3.6 million on its opening weekend behind ''[[Death Wish 3]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=November 5, 1985|page=2|title='Wish 3,' 'Elm St. 2' Nat'l B.O.

William Friedkin's evident attempt to fashion a West Coast equivalent of his 1971] ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' is engrossing and diverting enough on a moment-to-moment basis but is overtooled...Friedkin keeps dialog to a minimum, but what conversation there is proves wildly overloaded with streetwise obscenities, so much so that it becomes something of a joke\".<ref name= \"Variety\">{{cite news|title=''To Live and Die in L.A.''|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 1, 1985|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117795772.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 |access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn his scathing review for the ''Washington Post'', Paul Attanasio wrote \"''To Live and Die in L.A.'' will live briefly and die quickly in L.A., where God hath no wrath like a studio executive with bad grosses.

This picture is so gritty that it's hard to root for anybody -- since the good guys are as foul-mouthed, avaricious, and sadistic as the bad guys! For a crack Secret Service agent and a master counterfeiter, both Dafoe and Petersen act pretty dumb; Friedkin delivers one of the most spectacular car chases since his own ''[[The French Connection (film)|French Connection]]'', along with a galvanizing score by [[Wang Chung (band)|Wang Chung]], but even that's not enough to counteract the bad taste this film leaves behind.\"<ref>Maltin's TV, Movie, & Video Guide</ref>\n\nJay Scott, in his review for ''The Globe and Mail'', wrote \"Pity poor Los Angeles: first the [[San Andreas fault]] and now this.
