Parkes]] and directed by [[John Badham]]. The film, which stars [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Dabney Coleman]], [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]], and [[Ally Sheedy]], follows David Lightman (Broderick), a young [[Security hacker|hacker]] who unwittingly accesses a United States military [[supercomputer]] programmed to simulate, predict and execute [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] against the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n''WarGames'' was a critical and box-office success, costing $12&nbsp;million and grossing $125&nbsp;million worldwide. The influential film was nominated for three [[56th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring a series of surprise nuclear attack drills, a significant percentage of [[United States Air Force]] Strategic Missile Wing controllers prove unwilling to carry out orders for a missile launch. These results convince John McKittrick, head of the systems engineering team at [[NORAD]], that the launch control centers should be fully automated and require no human input. Control is given to a NORAD supercomputer known as the WOPR (War Operation Plan Response, pronounced \"whopper\"), programmed to continuously run war simulations and learn over time.\n\nDavid Lightman, a bright but unmotivated [[Seattle]] high school student and hacker, uses his [[IMSAI 8080]] computer to access the school district's computer system and change his grades. He does the same for his friend and classmate, Jennifer Mack. Later, while [[war dialing]] numbers in [[Sunnyvale, California]], to find a computer game company, he connects with a system that does not identify itself. He accesses a list of games that starts with chess, checkers, backgammon, and poker, as well as titles such as \"Theaterwide Biotoxic and Chemical Warfare\" and \"Global Thermonuclear War\", but cannot proceed further without a password. Two hacker friends explain the concept of a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] password and suggest tracking down the Falken referenced in \"Falken's Maze\", the first game listed. Discovering that its creator was Stephen Falken, an early [[Artificial intelligence|artificial-intelligence]] researcher, David is able to guess the password: the name of Falken's deceased son, Joshua.\n\nUnaware that the Sunnyvale phone number connects to the WOPR at the [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]], David initiates a game of Global Thermonuclear War, playing as the [[Soviet Union]] and targeting American cities. The computer starts a simulation that briefly convinces NORAD military personnel that actual Soviet nuclear missiles are inbound. While they defuse the situation, the WOPR nonetheless continues the simulation to trigger the scenario and win the game, as it does not understand the difference between reality and simulation. It continuously feeds false data on Soviet military deployment to NORAD, pushing them to escalate the [[DEFCON]] level toward a retaliation that will start [[World War III]].\n\nDavid learns the true nature of his actions from a news broadcast, and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[special agent]]s arrest him and take him to NORAD. He realizes that the WOPR is behind the NORAD alerts but fails to convince McKittrick, who believes he is working for the Soviets. Told that he will be charged with [[espionage]], David escapes NORAD by joining a tour group and, with Jennifer's help, travels to an [[Oregon]] island where Falken is living under an assumed name. David and Jennifer find that Falken has become despondent, believing that nuclear war is inevitable and as [[Solved game|futile]] as a game of [[tic-tac-toe]] between two experienced players. The teenagers convince Falken that he should return to NORAD to stop the WOPR.\n\nThe WOPR stages a massive Soviet [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|first strike]] with hundreds of missiles, submarines, and bombers. Believing the attack to be genuine, NORAD prepares to retaliate. Falken, David, and Jennifer persuade military officials to cancel a planned [[second strike]] and ride out the attack. When the targeted American bases report no enemy attacks or casualties, NORAD attempts to cancel the strike but cannot, as changes to the program have been locked out. The WOPR initiates a [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] [[brute-force attack]] to obtain the missile launch codes, intending to carry out the strike itself since humans are no longer in the control centers to implement the [[two-man rule]]. All attempts to log in and order the WOPR to cancel the countdown fail. The staff dismiss the idea of disconnecting it since the computers in the silos would carry out their last instructions and launch, resulting in a [[fail-deadly]] situation and the start of World War III.\n\nFalken and David direct the computer to play tic-tac-toe against itself. This results in a long string of draws, forcing the computer to learn the concept of futility and no-win scenarios. The WOPR obtains the launch codes, but before launching, it cycles through all the nuclear war scenarios it has devised, finding that all of them lead to the annihilation of humanity. Shutting down the simulation, the WOPR informs Falken of its conclusion about nuclear war: \"A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.\" It relinquishes control of NORAD and the missiles and asks, \"How about a nice game of chess?\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as David Lightman\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Dr. John McKittrick\n* [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as Stephen Falken and the voice of WOPR\n* [[Ally Sheedy]] as Jennifer Mack\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as General Jack Beringer\n* [[Juanin Clay]] as Patricia Healy\n* [[Dennis Lipscomb]] as Lyle Watson\n* [[Kent Williams (actor)|Kent Williams]] as Arthur Cabot\n* Joe Dorsey as Colonel Joe Conley\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as Beringer's Assistant\n* [[William Bogert]] as Mr. Lightman\n* [[Susan Davis (actress)|Susan Davis]] as Mrs. Lightman\n* Irving Metzman as Paul Richter\n* [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]] as Captain Jerry Lawson\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Lieutenant Steve Phelps\n* [[Alan Blumenfeld]] as Mr. Liggett\n* [[James Tolkan]] as Mr. Wigan\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Jim Sting\n* [[Eddie Deezen]] as Malvin}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nDevelopment on ''WarGames'' began in 1979, when writers Walter F. Parkes and [[Lawrence Lasker]] developed an idea for a script called ''The Genius'', about \"a dying scientist and the only person in the world who understands him\u2014a rebellious kid who's too smart for his own good\". Lasker was inspired by a television special presented by [[Peter Ustinov]] on several geniuses, including [[Stephen Hawking]]. Lasker said, \"I found the predicament Hawking was in fascinating\u2014that he might one day figure out the [[unified field theory]] and not be able to tell anyone, because of his progressive [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. So there was this idea that he'd need a successor. And who would that be? Maybe this kid, a juvenile delinquent whose problem was that nobody realized he was too smart for his environment.\" The concept of computers and hacking as part of the film was not yet present.<ref name=\"wired\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/16-08/ff_wargames?currentPage=all |title=WarGames: A Look Back at the Film That Turned Geeks and Phreaks Into Stars |access-date=May 1, 2009 |author=Brown, Scott |date=July 21, 2008 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712221432/http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/16-08/ff_wargames?currentPage=all |archive-date=July 12, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''The Genius'' began its transformation into ''WarGames'' when Parkes and Lasker met [[Peter Schwartz (futurist)|Peter Schwartz]] from the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]]. \"There was a new subculture of extremely bright kids developing into what would become known as hackers,\" said Schwartz.

Badham did 12 to 14 takes of the first shot to loosen the actors up.

After concluding that there's no way to win, the machine gives up and cancels the missile launch.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\n[[Be-Rad Entertainment]] released a [[tile-matching video game]], \"WarGames: WOPR\", for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=WarGames: WOPR for iOS|website=[[iTunes]]|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wargames-wopr/id528382306}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WarGames: WOPR for Android|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.berad.wargames}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe film's music was composed and conducted by [[Arthur B.
