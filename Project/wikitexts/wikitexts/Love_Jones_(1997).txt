Shortly before his set, he meets Nina Mosley, a gifted [[photographer]]. They exchange small talk, and Darius makes his interest clear when he retitles his love poem \"A Blues For Nina\". A mutual attraction is sparked between them. Darius runs into Nina for the second time at the record store and asked her out for  drinks. Nina told him it was bad timing, but Darius was not taking no for an answer. He talks his friend Sheila into letting him copy Nina's address from the check she wrote, goes to another record store to get the CD she was for and then shows up at her place unexpectedly to deliver the CD and ask her out for a second time. They have sex on the first date, but neither Darius or Nina are sure what to do next. Nina has just gotten out of a relationship and is unsure if she still cares for her old boyfriend; Darius, meanwhile, is unsure about whether or not to admit that he really cares for Nina.\n\nJust as Darius dares to begin believing that Nina could be \"the one,\" Nina's ex-beau Marvin invites her to join him in New York to try to work things out. After a night with Darius, Nina tells him that she is going to New York because of unfinished business. More as a test of Darius' feelings than as an earnest attempt to resolve things with Marvin, Nina leaves, only to return to find that Darius has been fooling around with another woman. At this, Nina steps out with Darius' self-satisfied buddy Hollywood, sparking a blowup between the men and a reconciliation between the lovers, which does not last, requiring yet another separation and subsequent attempt to set things right.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Larenz Tate]] as Darius Lovehall\n* [[Nia Long]] as Nina Mosley\n* [[Isaiah Washington]] as Savon Garrison\n* [[Lisa Nicole Carson]] as Josie Nichols\n* [[Bill Bellamy]] as Hollywood\n* [[Leonard Roberts]] as Eddie Coles\n* Bernadette Speakes as Sheila Downes (as Bernadette L.

Many love stories contrive to get their characters together at the end. This one contrives, not to keep them apart, but to bring them to a bittersweet awareness that is above simple love. Some audience members would probably prefer a romantic embrace in the sunset, as the music swells. But ''Love Jones'' is too smart for that.\" He also noted on the acting: \"It's hard to believe that Tate--so smooth, literate and attractive here--played the savage killer O-Dog in ''[[Menace II Society]]''. Nia Long was Brandi, one of the girl friends, in ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. ''Love Jones'' extends their range, to put it mildly\".<ref>{{cite news |date=1997 |author=Roger Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert | title=Love Jones | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/love-jones-1997 | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\n\n[[James Berardinelli]], writing for ReelReviews, also awarded the film three out of four stars, writing that \"There are several reasons why this film works better than the common, garden-variety love story. To begin with, the setting and texture are much different than that of most mainstream romances. The culture, in which post-college African Americans mingle while pursuing careers and relationships, represents a significant change from what we're used to. The Sanctuary, the intimate Chicago nightclub where Darius and Nina meet, is rich in its eclectic, [[blues]]y atmosphere. And ''Love Jones''{{'}}s dialogue is rarely trite. When the characters open their mouths, it usually is because they have something intelligent to say, not because they're trying to fill up dead air with meaningless words\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/l/love_jones.html|title=Review: Love Jones|website=Reelviews.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/celebrities/news/2017/03/14/love-jones-quotes.html|title=11 Quotes From 'Love Jones' That Are Still Relevant 20 Years Later|publisher=|via=Huffington Post}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] by [[New Line Home Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Love-Jones-VHS-Larenz-Tate/dp/0780619439|title=Love Jones [VHS]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=March 7, 2022}}</ref> It later received a standalone [[DVD]] release,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Love-Jones-Jay-Stern/dp/B00000JGHO/|title=Love Jones (DVD)|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=March 7, 2022}}</ref> as well as a New Line \"double feature\" DVD release, the latter of which also included the 1996 film ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Love-Jones-Thin-Line-Between/dp/B001K98MGE|title=Love Jones/Thin Line Between Love and Hate (DBFE) (DVD)|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=March 7, 2022}}</ref>\n\nA [[4K resolution|4K]] restoration of the film was released on [[Blu-ray]] by [[the Criterion Collection]] on March 29, 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/31501-love-jones|title=love jones (1997)|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|access-date=March 7, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Film|Chicago|Illinois|United States}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0119572}}\n* {{Allmovie|154547|Love Jones}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:African-American films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Chicago]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:1997 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
