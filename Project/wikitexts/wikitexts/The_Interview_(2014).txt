The screenplay was written by [[Dan Sterling]], based on a story he co-wrote with Rogen and Goldberg. The film stars Rogen and [[James Franco]] as journalists who set up an interview with [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] ([[Randall Park]]), and are then recruited by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to assassinate him. The film is inspired by a 2012 ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' documentary.\n\nRogen and Goldberg developed the idea for ''The Interview'' in the late 2000s, with [[Kim Jong-il]] as the original assassination target. In 2011, after [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|Jong-il's death]] and Jong-un's succession as the [[Supreme leader of North Korea|North Korean leader]], Rogen and Goldberg redeveloped the script with the focus on Jong-un's character. ''The Interview'' was first announced in March 2013, at the beginning of pre-production. [[Principal photography]] was in [[Vancouver]] from October to December 2013. The film was produced by [[Columbia Pictures]], [[LStar Capital]] and Rogen and Goldberg's [[Point Grey Pictures]], and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony Pictures Releasing]].\n\nIn June 2014, the North Korean government threatened action against the United States if Sony released the film. As a result, Sony delayed the release from October to December and reportedly re-edited the film to make it more acceptable to North Korea. In November, the computer systems of Sony were [[Sony Pictures hack|hacked]] by the \"[[Lazarus Group|Guardians of Peace]]\", a North Korean cybercrime group.<ref>[[Gabi Siboni]] and David Siman-Tov, [http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20646%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Dudi%20for%20web.pdf Cyberspace Extortion: North Korea versus the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820031432/http://www.inss.org.il/uploadImages/systemFiles/No.%20646%20-%20Gabi%20and%20Dudi%20for%20web.pdf |date=August 20, 2016 }}, [[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|INSS]] Insight No. 646, December 23, 2014.</ref> The group also threatened [[terrorist attacks]] against theaters showing the film.

It received mixed reviews for its humor and subject matter, although a few critics praised the performances of Rogen, Franco, Park and [[Diana Bang]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words-->\n\nDave Skylark is the host of the [[talk show]] ''Skylark Tonight'', where he interviews celebrities (including [[Eminem]] and [[Rob Lowe]]) about personal topics. After Skylark and his crew celebrate producer Aaron Rapaport's 1,000th episode, Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticizes the show as not being a real news program. He voices his concern to Skylark, urging change. Skylark agrees and later discovers [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Jong-un]] is a fan of their show, prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview for him. Traveling to the outskirts of [[Dandong]], [[China]], to receive instructions from chief propagandist Sook-yin Park, Rapaport accepts the interview on behalf of Skylark.\n\nFollowing Rapaport's return, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Lacey shows up, requesting they assassinate Kim with a [[transdermal patch|transdermal strip]] of [[ricin]] via handshake to prevent the country from launching a [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear missile]] at the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the strip inside a pack of gum. Upon arrival in [[Pyongyang]], they are greeted by Sook and taken to the [[Residences of North Korean leaders|presidential palace]]. They are introduced to Kim's personal security officers Koh and Yu who are immediately suspicious of the duo; when Koh finds the strip, mistaking it for gum and chewing it. After making a secret request for help, Lacey airdrops them two more strips via a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]], but to get it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a [[Siberian tiger]] and hide the container in his rectum before getting caught by security, who don't find the container.\n\nThe next day, Skylark meets Kim and spends the day playing [[basketball]], hanging out, riding in his personal [[T-54|tank]] and partying with alcohol and [[Kippumjo|escorts]]. Kim convinces Skylark that he is misunderstood as both a cruel dictator and a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] from the ricin, accidentally shooting Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty, discarding one of the ricin strips and thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After a dinner mourning the deaths of the bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's true brutal self as he [[Korean conflict|threatens war]] against [[South Korea]] and everyone who tries to undermine him. Skylark leaves and discovers that a nearby grocery store is [[Potemkin village|fake]], realizing Kim has been lying to him. At the same time, during an attempt to seduce Rapaport (who still has the ricin strip), Sook reveals she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. Skylark returns and tries to get Sook's support to assassinate Kim, but she disagrees, suggesting to instead ruin his [[North Korean cult of personality|cult of personality]] and show the North Korean people the dire state of the country. The trio secretly devise a plan to expose him on air and arm themselves with guns. Before the broadcast begins, Kim gives Skylark a [[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel|puppy]] as a symbol of their friendship.\n\nDuring the internationally televised interview with Kim, Skylark addresses increasingly sensitive topics (including the country's [[North Korean famine|food shortage]] and US-imposed [[Sanctions against North Korea|economic sanctions]]) and challenges his need for [[Kim Jong-il|his father]]'s approval. Meanwhile, Sook and Rapaport take over the control booth to fend off guards trying to cut off the broadcast. Despite his initial resistance, Kim eventually cries uncontrollably, soiling himself after Skylark sings [[Firework (song)|\"Firework\"]] by [[Katy Perry]] (knowing of Kim's fondness of her music), ruining his reputation. Enraged at Skylark's betrayal, Kim shoots him and vows to get revenge by launching a nuclear missile. Skylark, whose bulletproof vest saves him, regroups with Rapaport and Sook to escape (alongside the puppy) with the help of a guard. The trio hijacks Kim's tank to get to their pickup point, killing several more guards in the process. Kim chases the group in a helicopter but is shot down and killed by Skylark before he can launch the missile.\n\nWith the missile launch thwarted, Sook guides Skylark and Rapaport to an escape route, explaining that she has to return to Pyongyang to maintain security. The two are later rescued by [[SEAL Team Six]] members disguised as [[Korean People's Army]] troops. Back in the US, Skylark writes a book about his experience in North Korea, Rapaport returns to work as a producer (and maintains contact with Sook via [[Skype]]), while North Korea becomes a denuclearized [[democracy]] with Sook as an [[Transitional government|interim]] leader.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Franco]] as Dave Skylark\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Aaron Rapaport\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Agent Lacey\n* [[Randall Park]] as [[Kim Jong-un]]\n* [[Diana Bang]] as Sook-yin Park\n* [[Timothy Simons]] as Malcolm\n* Reese Alexander as Agent Botwin\n* [[Anders Holm]] as Jake\n* [[Charles Chun|Charles Rahi Chun]] as General Jong\n* [[Ben Schwartz]] as Darryl\n\nThe film also features [[cameo appearance]]s from [[Eminem]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Bill Maher]], [[Seth Meyers]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], [[Song Kang-ho]], [[Brian Williams]] and [[Scott Pelley]].
