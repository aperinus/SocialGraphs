Directed by [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]], the film stars [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Jane March]].\n\nThe cast also features [[Ruben Blades]], [[Lesley Ann Warren]], [[Brad Dourif]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J. O'Connor]] and [[Scott Bakula]]. It is one of two well-known works by director Rush, the other being ''[[The Stunt Man]]'' 14 years before.\n\n''Color of Night'' flopped at the box office and won a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] as the worst film of 1994. It later, however, became one of the 20 most-rented films in the United States home video market in 1995.<ref>''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' vol 108 #1 p.54.</ref> [[Maxim (magazine)|''Maxim'']] magazine also singled the film out as having the best sex scene in film history.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://telepixtvcgi.warnerbros.com/reframe.html?http://telepixtvcgi.warnerbros.com/dailynews/pop/12_00/12_06a.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120628224513/http://telepixtvcgi.warnerbros.com/reframe.html?http://telepixtvcgi.warnerbros.com/dailynews/pop/12_00/12_06a.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 28, 2012|title=Top Sex Scenes of All-Time|date=December 6, 2000|access-date=July 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Extra (U.S. TV program)]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, [[Kino Lorber]] (under license from [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Disney]]) released a [[special edition]] Blu-ray of the film; it contains an audio commentary by director Richard Rush.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kinolorber.com/product/color-of-night-1994-2-disc-special-edition-blu-ray|title=Color of Night (1994) (2-Disc Special Edition)|via=www.kinolorber.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Bill Capa, a [[New York City|New York]] [[psychologist]], falls into a deep [[major depressive disorder|depression]] after Michelle, an unstable patient, dies by [[suicide]] in front of him by jumping from his office window. The sight of the bloody body clad in a bright green dress causes Bill to suffer from [[somatic symptom disorder|psychosomatic]] [[color blindness]], taking away his ability to see the color red. Bill travels to [[Los Angeles]] to stay with a friend, fellow therapist Dr. Bob Moore, who invites him to sit in on a [[group psychotherapy|group therapy]] session. However, Bob is violently murdered in the office and Bill is plunged into the mystery of his friend's death.\n\nLt. Hector Martinez considers everyone in Moore's therapy group, including Bill, as suspects in the murder. Bill continues to live in Bob's house and begins an [[affair]] with Rose, a beautiful but mysterious young woman who comes and goes.  Bill takes the therapy group, which includes: Clark, a temperamental [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|OCD]] sufferer; Sondra, a [[hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] and [[kleptomania]]c; Buck, a [[suicide|suicidal]] ex-cop; Casey, who paints [[Sadomasochism|sado-masochist images]]; and Richie, a 16-year old with [[gender dysphoria]] and a history of drug use.\n\nAfter Casey is found violently murdered, Bill becomes the target of several attempts on his life. He discovers that all but one of his patients have been romantically involved with Rose. He eventually [[plot twist|learns]] that \"Richie\" is really Rose, and the murders were the work of her deranged brother, Dale. They once had an actual brother named Richie, who was [[child sexual abuse|molested]] by his [[Child and adolescent psychiatry|child psychiatrist]] along with Dale.\n\nAfter Richie committed suicide, Dale abused Rose into playing the part of their brother. Rose began to re-emerge during therapy and, under [[dissociative identity disorder|another personality]] named \"Bonnie\", started relationships with the other patients. Dale proceeded to kill them, fearing that they would soon link Rose to Richie.\n\nBill confronts them and is overpowered by Dale, who is about to kill him with a [[nail gun]] but is instead killed by Rose. Deeply [[psychological trauma|traumatized]], she then tries to commit suicide. Bill is able to stop her, bookending the story with two suicide attempts, one at the beginning, resulting in Bill's loss of color vision, and one at the end, thwarted and resulting in his regaining it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Bruce Willis]] as Dr. Bill Capa\n*[[Jane March]] as Rose\n*[[Ruben Blades]] as Hector Martinez\n*[[Lesley Ann Warren]] as Sondra Dorio\n*[[Scott Bakula]] as Bob Moore\n*[[Brad Dourif]] as Clark\n*[[Lance Henriksen]] as Buck\n*[[Kevin J.

Vajna was concerned about the film's commercial prospects and demanded a recut, something Rush refused. Nonetheless, Vajna mandated he had [[wikt:final cut|final cut]] per contractual obligation, and insisted on testing his own version of the film. After both versions were given a number of test screenings, Vajna determined that his cut would be released and fired Rush in April 1994.\n\nThis ultimately escalated into a battle between Rush and Vajna that received  coverage in the Los Angeles trades. Rush commented that his version tested higher than Vajna's cut; his statements were defended in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and by film critic Bill Arnold, who attended a test screening of Rush's version in [[Seattle, Washington]]. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', meanwhile, defended Vajna, stating that Rush stubbornly refused any input from the studio. The [[Directors Guild of America]] attempted to intervene on the matter.\n\nThe battle ultimately ended when Rush suffered a near-fatal heart attack and became hospitalized. Months later, after Rush recovered, he compromised with Vajna that the producer's cut would be released theatrically and that the director's cut would see a video release.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-23/entertainment/ca-49372_1_final-cut | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Claudia | last=Eller | title=Who's Got the Right to 'Color' Final Cut? : Director Richard Rush and Producers Battle Over Fate of Bruce Willis Thriller | date=April 23, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/1994/film/news/color-of-night-stuck-in-dga-arbitration-120479/ | work=Variety | first=Leonard | last=Klady | title='Color of Night' stuck in DGA arbitration | date=April 25, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Arnold|first1=William|title=Director's cut changes meaning of 'Color of Night'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19950209&id=v11IAAAAIBAJ&pg=6109,2296989|access-date=July 11, 2017|work=Toledo Blade|date=February 9, 1995}}</ref>\n\nEventually, four versions were released:<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=82693|title=Color of Night (Comparison: International Theatrical Version - Unrated Director's Cut) - Movie-Censorship.com|website=www.movie-censorship.com}}</ref>\n*The R-Rated theatrical release from the USA\n*The international theatrical release\n*The R-Rated Director's Cut\n*The Unrated Director's Cut\n\n(Among them, international theatrical release version also contains numerous scenes that are not included in the Unrated Director's Cut.)<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at number 4 at the US box office, grossing $6,610,488 its opening weekend playing at a total of 1,740 theaters.<ref>{{cite news | date = August 23, 1994 | first = David J.|last=Fox | title = Weekend Box Office : 'Forrest Gump' in Top Spot--Again | newspaper =[[Los Angeles Times]] | url= https://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-23/entertainment/ca-30121_1_forrest-gump | access-date = January 11, 2011 }}</ref> The film grossed only $19,750,470 in the United States and Canada<ref name=\"The Numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1994/0CONI.php |title=Color of Night - Box Office Data, DVD Sales, Movie News, Cast Information |publisher=The Numbers |access-date=December 20, 2012}}</ref> but grossed $27 million internationally for a worldwide total of $46.7 million<ref name=worldwide/> compared to its $40 million production budget.\n\n===Critical response===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively reported that 22% of 51 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.4/10.
