It received generally positive reviews and led to a [[Cube (film series)|series of films]]. An American remake, currently on hold, is in development at [[Lionsgate]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://screenrant.com/cube-movie-remake-cubed/|title='Cube' Reboot 'Cubed' Being Developed by Lionsgate|date=30 April 2015|work=Screen Rant|access-date=27 May 2017|language=en-US|archive-date=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516233754/http://screenrant.com/cube-movie-remake-cubed/|url-status=live}}</ref> and a [[Cube (2021 film)|Japanese remake]] was released in 2021.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.-->\nIn a pre-credits sequence, a man (Alderson) enters into a cube-shaped room all coloured in red, thinking the room is safe, he doesn't realise a metal wire mesh had swung right through him, dies in a gory manner as he is shown sliced up into pieces, as the bloodied mesh resets back to place.\n\nFive desperate people \u2013 Quentin, Worth, Holloway, Leaven, and Rennes \u2013 meet in another identical room. None of them knows how or why they have arrived. Quentin, who had been exploring, warns everyone that some rooms contain traps. Rennes, an [[escape artist]] of seven prisons, assumes the traps are triggered by [[motion detector]]s. He tests each room by throwing one of his boots first. The maze is beset by frequent tremors. Leaven notices numbers inscribed into the narrow passageways between rooms. Rennes enters a room that he thinks to be safe and is killed by an acid spray trap. This indicates that each trap is triggered by different sensors.\n\nQuentin believes each person was chosen to be there. He is a divorced police officer, Leaven is a young [[mathematics]] student, and Holloway is a [[free clinic]] doctor. Worth cagily describes himself as an office worker. Leaven hypothesizes that any room marked with a [[prime number]] is a trap, and they find an intellectually disabled man named Kazan, whom Holloway insists they bring along. Quentin injures his leg in a trapped room deemed safe by Leaven's calculations. Tensions rise over personal conflicts and the mystery over the maze's purpose. After being provoked by Quentin, Worth admits that he designed the maze's outer shell (also shaped like a cube) for a shadowy and uncaring bureaucracy. He guesses that its original purpose has been forgotten; they have been imprisoned within the maze simply to put it to use.\n\nWorth's knowledge of the outer shell's dimensions allows Leaven to determine that each side of the Cube is 26 rooms across, making 17,576 rooms in total. She realizes that the numbers indicate the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of each room. The group moves toward the nearest edge as determined by her theory, but each of the rooms near the outer wall is trapped. Rather than backtrack, they travel silently through a room with a sound-activated trap. After Kazan makes a sound and nearly causes Quentin's death, Quentin threatens Kazan and clashes with Holloway, who defends Kazan and insinuates that Quentin may have been an abusive husband who likes young girls.\n\nWhen the group reaches the edge, they find a bottomless abyss separating the maze from the outer shell. Holloway volunteers to scout the gap using a rope made out of the group's clothes. Holloway tries to swing towards the outer wall, but another tremor causes the group to lose grip of the rope. Quentin grabs Holloway, but drops her to her death.\n\nQuentin has become more unhinged. He attempts to persuade Leaven to join him in abandoning the others and makes a sexual advance on her. She rejects him. Worth intervenes. Quentin beats him savagely and drops him into another room through a floor hatch. There, the group finds Rennes's corpse, indicating that they have wandered in circles. Worth realizes that the rooms move throughout the Cube, causing the tremors. Leaven deduces that traps are not tagged by prime numbers, but by [[Prime power|powers of prime numbers]]. Kazan is revealed as an [[Savant syndrome|autistic savant]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v158816/review|title=''Cube'' review|work=[[AllMovie]]|first=Derek|last=Armstrong|access-date=12 June 2017|quote=The wild card in the equation, as if there needed to be one, is Andrew Miller's autistic man.|archive-date=11 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811222840/http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v158816/review|url-status=live}}</ref> who can mentally calculate [[Integer factorization|prime factorization]]s. With his help, Leaven guides the group to the bridge room that will lead them out of the maze. Worth ambushes and apparently kills Quentin, leaving him behind. Kazan opens the final hatch, revealing a bright white light, but Worth declines to leave the Cube as he has lost his will to live.\n\nAs Leaven tries to convince the guilt-stricken Worth to join her, Quentin reappears to stab and kill her with a hatch lever. He mortally wounds Worth while Kazan flees. As Quentin moves to kill Kazan, Worth pins Quentin in the narrow passageway as the rooms shift again. Quentin is torn apart by the machination. Worth crawls back to Leaven's corpse to die next to her.\n\nKazan wanders out into the bright light, his fate left unknown.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe cast is of Canadian actors who were relatively unknown in the United States at the time of the film's release.<ref name=\"record_11sep98\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/104362811 |title=A deadly puzzle |newspaper=The Record |page=133 |date=September 11, 1998}}</ref> Each character's name is connected with a real-world prison.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He cost-reduced his pitch with a single set reused as many, with the actors moving around a virtual maze.<ref name=\"toc_8oct98\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/104302526 |title=Director escapes own maze |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen |page=50 |date=October 8, 1998}}</ref> As the most expensive element, a set with a cube and a half was built off the floor, to allow the surroundings to be lit from behind all walls of the cube.<ref name=\"tc_5sep99\"/> In 1990, Natali had had the idea to make a film \"set entirely in hell\", but in 1994 while working as a storyboard artist's assistant at Canada's [[Nelvana]] animation studio, he completed the first script for ''Cube''. The initial draft had a more comedic tone, surreal images, a cannibal, edible moss growing on the walls, and a monster that roamed the Cube. Roommate and childhood filmmaking partner Andre Bijelic helped Natali strip the central idea to its essence of people avoiding deadly traps in a maze. Scenes outside the cube were deleted, and the identity of the victims changed. In some drafts, they were accountants and in others criminals, with the implication that their banishment to the Cube was part of a penal sentence. One of the most important dramatic changes was the removal of food and water for a more urgent escape.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cube: Inside the Making of a Cult Film Classic|last=Berman|first=A.S.|publisher=BearManor Media|year=2018|isbn=978-1629332918|pages=25\u201327, pp. 47\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAfter writing ''Cube'', Natali developed the short film, ''[[Elevated (film)|Elevated]]''. It is set in an elevator to show investors how ''Cube'' would hypothetically look and feel. Cinematographer Derek Rogers developed strategies for shooting in the tightly confined elevator, which he later reused on a [[Toronto]] soundstage for ''Cube''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/darkhours.html |title=CBC.ca |publisher=CBC.ca |date=15 November 2005 |access-date=21 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211014753/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/darkhours.html| archive-date=11 February 2006| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nCasting started with Natali's friends, and budget limitations allowed for only one day of script reading prior to shooting.

A space of {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} is between the inner cube and the outer shell. Each room is labelled with three identification numbers such as \"517 478 565\". These numbers encode the starting coordinates of the room and the X, Y, and Z coordinates are the sums of the digits of the first, second, and third number, respectively. The numbers also determine the movement of the room. The subsequent positions are obtained by cyclically subtracting the digits from one another, and the resulting numbers are then successively added to the starting numbers.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Polster | first1 = Burkard | last2 = Ross | first2 = Marty | title = Math Goes to the Movies | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2012 | location = Baltimore | pages = 85\u201396 | chapter = 6 Escape from the Cube | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4IfyzQuEJ3wC&pg=PA85 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4IfyzQuEJ3wC | isbn = 978-1-4214-0484-4 | access-date = 20 September 2016 | archive-date = 1 January 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140101055805/http://books.google.com/books?id=4IfyzQuEJ3wC | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nOnly one cube set was actually built, with each of its sides measuring {{convert|14|ft|m}} in length, with only one working door that could actually support the weight of the actors.

Another partial cube was made for shots requiring the point of view of standing in one room and looking into another.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Emmer | first1 = Michele | last2 = Manaresi | first2 = Mirella | title = Mathematics, Art, Technology, and Cinema | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 2003 | location = Berlin, Heidelberg | pages = 172\u2013180 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JKynT5lRdSgC&q=cube+natali&pg=PA173 | isbn = 978-3-540-00601-5 | access-date = 4 October 2020 | archive-date = 2 May 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210502053026/https://books.google.com/books?id=JKynT5lRdSgC&q=cube+natali&pg=PA173 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nThe small set created technical problems for hosting a 30-person crew and a 6-person cast, becoming \"a weird fusion between sci-fi and the guerrilla-style approach to filmmaking\".<ref name=\"np_18jul99\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/106334604 |title=Award-winning 'Cube' makes U.S. TV debut on Sci-Fi channel |newspaper=News-Press |page=176 |date=18 July 1999}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nDuring post production, Natali spent months \"on the aural environment\", including appropriate sound effects of each room, so the Cube feels like a haunted house.<ref name=\"smh_26feb99\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Cube'' was shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 9 September 1997<ref name=\"cube-cc\" /> and released in Ottawa and Montreal on 18 September.<ref name=\"cube-cc\" /> A theatrical release occurred in Spain in early 1999,<ref name=\"tvs_15jul99\"/> while in Italy a release was scheduled for July 1999<ref name=\"lp_5jul99\"/> and an opening in Germany was set for later that year.<ref name=\"tc_5sep99\"/> In the Japanese market, it became the top video rental at the time,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/106334311 |title=Vincenzo Natali is feeling the love |newspaper=National Post |page=20 |date=26 June 2002}}</ref> and exceeded expectations, with co-writer Graeme Manson suggesting people in Japan had a better understanding of living in boxes so resonated better with the Japanese audience, as they were likely \"more receptive to the whole metaphor underlying the film\".<ref name=\"tvs_15jul99\"/>\n\nThe film's television debut in the United States was on 24 July 1999 on the [[SyFy|Sci-Fi]] channel.<ref name=\"np_18jul99\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn its home country of Canada, the film was a commercial failure, lasting only a few days in Canadian theatres.

The [[ensemble cast]] does an outstanding job on the cinematic equivalent of a bare stage... Everyone has his or her own theory about who is behind this peculiar imprisonment... The weakness in ''Cube'' is the dialogue, which sometimes turns remarkably trite... The strength is the film's understated but real tension.
