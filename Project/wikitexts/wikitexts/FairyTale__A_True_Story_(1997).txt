It is loosely based on the story of the [[Cottingley Fairies]]. Its plot takes place in 1917 in England, and follows two children who take a photograph soon believed to be the first scientific evidence of the existence of fairies. The film was produced by [[Icon Productions]] and was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the United States and by [[Warner Bros.]] internationally.<ref name=\"tcm.com\"/><ref name=\"filmbankmedia.com\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nEarly 20th-century Europe was a time and a place rife with conflicting forces, from the battlefields of [[World War I]] to the peaceful countryside of rural England. Scientific advances such as [[electric light]] and photography appeared magical to some; [[spiritualism]] was championed by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] while his friend [[Harry Houdini]] decried false mediums who prey upon grieving families. [[J.M. Barrie]]'s [[Peter Pan]] charmed theatergoers of all ages. Young Frances Griffiths, whose father is [[missing in action]], arrives by train to stay with her cousin Elsie Wright in rural [[City of Bradford|Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]].\n\nPolly Wright, Elsie's mother, is deep in mourning for her son Joseph, a gifted artist who died at the age of ten, and she keeps Joseph's room and art works intact. Elsie is not allowed to wear colours or to play with his toys, but she has taken the unfinished fairy-house he built up to her garret bedroom where her doting father, Arthur, regales her with [[fairy tales]]. He is a bit of a local hero, responsible for the electrification of the local mill, where children as young as Elsie go to work. He is also an amateur photographer and chess player. When Frances arrives she and Elsie discover a shared fascination with fairies, whom they encounter down at the \"beck\", a nearby brook. They abscond with Arthur's camera one afternoon to take pictures of the fairies, hoping to give Polly something to believe in. When she comes home after attending a meeting of the [[Theosophical Society]], where she hears stories of angels and all sorts of ethereal beings, she finds Arthur reviewing the prints in disbelief, but she thinks they are real. She takes them to Theosophist lecturer E.L. Gardner, who has them analysed by a professional and then brings them to the attention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The photos are pronounced genuine, or at least devoid of trickery.\n\nNo one except Houdini believes that young children could be capable of photographic fraud, and Conan Doyle himself arrives at the girls' home with Houdini, Gardner and two new cameras. Arthur catches Houdini poking around and tells him point-blank that he doesn't believe that the fairies are real, but that no trickery took place in his [[darkroom]] either. Abetted by the buffoonish Gardner, Elsie and Frances soon come up with two more photos and Conan Doyle has the story published in ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', promising everyone's names will be changed. But a newsman soon identifies the beck in [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]], tracing the girls through the local school and besieging the family. Hundreds of people invade the village in automobiles and on foot, and the fairies flee the obstreperous mobs. By way of apology to the fairies, the girls finish Joseph's fairy-house and leave it in the forest as a gift.\n\nThe girls are invited to London by Conan Doyle, where they embrace their celebrity and see Houdini perform. In a quiet moment backstage Houdini asks Elsie if she wants to know how he does his tricks, and she wisely declines. And when a reporter asks, he declaims, \"Masters of illusion never reveal their secrets!\" Back in [[Yorkshire]], while the girls and Polly are away, Arthur has a chess match with a local champion reputed to be mute, and the newsman breaks into their house. He discovers a cache of paper dolls in the form of fairies in a portfolio in Joseph's room, but he is frightened away by the apparition of a young boy, leaving the evidence behind. Arthur wins his match, wringing a shout from his opponent, and another myth is debunked. After the children return home, the fairies reappear, and finally, Frances' father comes home as well.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]\n* [[Florence Hoath]] as [[Elsie Wright]]\n* Elizabeth Earl as [[Frances Griffiths]]\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as [[Harry Houdini]]\n* [[Paul McGann]] as Arthur Wright\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Edward Gardner\n* [[Phoebe Nicholls]] as Polly Wright\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as [[Peter Pan]]\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Sergeant Major Griffiths\n* [[Don Henderson]] as Sydney Chalker\n\n==Background==\nIn 1920 Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], the creator of [[Sherlock Holmes]], who had developed a strong belief in spiritualism in the last third of his life, was commissioned by the [[Strand Magazine]] to write an article on fairies, and it was while preparing this article that he first heard of the [[Cottingley Fairies]].\nIn 1922 he published ''The Coming of the Fairies'',<ref name=doyle_1920_fairies>*{{citation |last=Conan Doyle |first=Arthur |title=The Coming of the Fairies |year=2006 |orig-year=1922 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=978-0-8032-6655-1}}</ref> which included numerous photographs and extensive discussion.\nMagician [[Harry Houdini]] publicly exposed the many fraudulent mediums he discovered during his search for a genuine medium who could help him communicate with his late mother.\nThe two maintained a friendship for several years, exchanging several letters about supernatural phenomena.\n\n==Filming and production==\nMuch of the film was shot on location in the Cottingley, [[Bingley]] and [[Keighley]] in the [[City of Bradford]].<ref name=\"Bradford Premiere\">{{Cite web|date=9 February 1998|title=A Premiere Performance|url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/8079855.a-premiere-performance/|url-status=live|access-date=4 April 2021|website=Bradford Telegraph and Argus|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Bradford Film Heritage\">{{Cite web|title=Fairy Tale: A True Story|url=https://www.bradfordfilmheritage.com/portfolio/fairy-tale-a-true-story/|url-status=live|access-date=4 April 2021|website=Bradford Film Heritage|language=en-GB}}</ref> Filming locations include [[Cottingley Town Hall]], Cottingley Beck, and [[Keighley railway station]] along with the rest of the [[Keighley and Worth Valley Railway]].<ref name=\"Bradford Film Heritage\" /> The cinematography was by [[Michael Coulter]], with art direction by [[Sam Riley]].
