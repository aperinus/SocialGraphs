The film revolves around a surveillance expert and the moral dilemma he faces when his recordings reveal a potential murder. Coppola cited the [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] thriller ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) as a key influence. Since the film was released to theaters just a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as president, though, he felt that audiences interpreted the film as being a reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]].\n\n''The Conversation'' premiered at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Palme d'Or]], the festival's highest prize, and  was theatrically released on April 7, 1974 by [[Paramount Pictures]] to critical acclaim but box office disappointment, grossing $4.2 million on a $1.6 million budget. The film  received three nominations at the [[47th Academy Awards]]; [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]].\n\nIn 1995, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-06-06|publisher=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSurveillance expert Harry Caul, who runs his own company in San Francisco, is obsessed with his own privacy. His apartment is almost bare behind its triple-locked door and burglar alarm, he uses pay phones to make calls and claims to have no home telephone, and his office is enclosed in a chain-link cage in a corner of a much larger warehouse. He has no friends, his girlfriend Amy knows little about him, and his sole hobby is playing along to jazz records on a tenor saxophone alone in his apartment.\n\nCaul insists that he is not responsible for the content of the conversations he records or the use to which his clients put his surveillance activities. But he is wracked by guilt over a past wiretap job that was followed by the murders of three people. His sense of guilt is amplified by his devout Catholicism.\n\nCaul, his colleague Stan, and some freelance associates have been tasked with bugging the conversation of a couple as they walk through crowded Union Square in San Francisco. Against a cacophony of background noise, the couple discusses fears that they are being watched and mention a discreet meeting at a hotel room in a few days. The challenging task of recording this conversation is accomplished by having a number of surveillance operatives located in different positions around the square. After Caul has merged and filtered the different tapes, the final result is a sound recording in which the words themselves are clear, but the meaning is ambiguous.\n\nWhen the client is not in his office, Caul refuses to leave the tape with his client's assistant, Martin Stett. The assistant warns him against getting involved, telling him that the tapes are \"dangerous.\u201d Feeling increasingly uneasy about what may happen to the couple once the client hears the tape, Caul repeatedly plays the tape, gradually refining the recording. Using a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]], he reveals a key phrase hidden under the sound of a street musician: \"He'd ''kill'' us if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul avoids handing in the tape to the aide of the man who commissioned the surveillance. Afterward, he is  increasingly pressured by the client's aide and realizes that he is followed, tricked, and bugged. The tape of the conversation is eventually stolen from him while his guard is down. He goes to the client (\"the Director\") to find he has received the tapes and learns that the woman in the recording is the client's wife, apparently having an affair with the other man in the tapes.\n\nCaul books a hotel room next to one mentioned in the recording of the conversation. He uses equipment to overhear the client in a heated argument with his wife. When he goes to the balcony to curiously watch the events through the windows, he sees what he believes to be the wife being murdered and retreats in shock. He later breaks into the hotel room to find no sign of a murder scene save for the toilet, which overflows with bloody toilet paper.\n\nCaul attempts to confront the client at his office in the Embarcadero Center, but the client is absent. While departing, Caul notices the wife, alive and unharmed, in a limousine. He learns that his client was killed in an \"accident\" and discovers the truth; the couple he heard in Union Square was talking about killing the woman's husband, and the murder Caul witnessed was actually that of his client and not the wife. The man in the recording actually said, \"He'd kill ''us'' if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul gets a phone call from Stett, who plays a recording of Caul's saxophone playing from seconds earlier and tells him not to look any further into the matter, adding, \"We'll be listening to you.\" Caul frantically searches for a listening device, tearing up his apartment, to no avail. He sits amid the wreckage playing his saxophone, the only thing in his apartment left intact.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Gene Hackman]] as Harry Caul\n*[[John Cazale]] as Stan\n*[[Allen Garfield]] as William P. \"Bernie\" Moran\n*[[Cindy Williams]] as Ann\n*[[Frederic Forrest]] as Mark\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as Martin Stett\n*[[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Paul\n*[[Elizabeth MacRae]] as Meredith\n*[[Teri Garr]] as Amy Fredericks\n*Mark Wheeler as Receptionist\n*[[Shields and Yarnell|Robert Shields]] as the Mime\n*Phoebe Alexander as Lurleen\n*[[Robert Duvall]] as The Director<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/02/26/the_conversation_1974_review.shtml |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Hilditch |first=Nick |date=27 February 2002 |access-date=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCoppola has cited [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) as a key influence on his conceptualization of the film's themes, such as surveillance versus participation, and perception versus reality. \"Francis had seen [it] a year or two before, and had the idea to fuse the concept of ''Blowup'' with the world of audio surveillance.\"{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=152}}\n\nOn the [[DVD]] commentary, Coppola says he was shocked to learn that the film used the same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon Administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola has said this is the reason the film gained part of the recognition it has received, but that this is entirely coincidental. Not only was the script for ''The Conversation'' completed in the mid-1960s (before the Nixon Administration came to power), but the spying equipment used in the film also was discovered through research and the use of technical advisers, and not, as many believed, by revelatory newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. Coppola also noted that filming of ''The Conversation'' had been completed several months before the most revelatory Watergate stories broke in the press. Since the film was released to theaters just a few months before Richard Nixon resigned as president, Coppola felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fall-out.\n\nThe original cinematographer of ''The Conversation'' was [[Haskell Wexler]]. Severe creative and personal differences with Coppola led to Wexler's firing shortly after production began, and Coppola replaced him with [[Bill Butler (cinematographer)|Bill Butler]]. Wexler's footage on ''The Conversation'' was completely reshot, except for the technically complex surveillance scene in Union Square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/71469/The-Conversation/articles.html |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Stafford |first=Jeff |access-date=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> This was the first of two Oscar-nominated films where Wexler would be fired and replaced by Butler, the second being ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975), where Wexler had similar problems with [[Milo\u0161 Forman]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Townsend |first=Sylvia |title=Haskell Wexler and the Making of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' |date=19 December 2014 |url=http://worldcinemaparadise.com/2014/12/19/haskell-wexler-and-the-making-of-one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest/ |access-date=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Murch]] served as the supervising editor and sound designer. Murch had more or less a free hand during the editing process, since Coppola was already working on ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' at the time.{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=157}} Coppola noted in the DVD commentary that Hackman had a very difficult time adapting to the Harry Caul character because he was so much unlike himself. Coppola says that Hackman was at the time an outgoing and approachable person who preferred casual clothes, whereas Caul was meant to be a socially awkward loner who wore a rain coat and out-of-style glasses. Coppola said that Hackman's efforts to tap into the character made the actor moody and irritable on set, but otherwise Coppola got along well with his leading man. Coppola also notes on the commentary that Hackman considers this one of his favorite performances.\n\n''The Conversation'' features a piano score composed and performed by [[David Shire]]. The score was created before the film was shot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/soundtracks/database/?id=2939 |title=discussion of soundtrack |access-date=22 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020115151208/http://www.soundtrack.net/soundtracks/database/?id=2939 |archive-date=15 January 2002}}</ref> On some cues, Shire used ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'' techniques, taking the taped sounds of the piano and distorting them in different ways to create alternative tonalities to round out the score. The score was released on CD by [[Intrada Records]] in 2001.<ref>Intrada Special Collection Volume 2</ref>\n\n===Inspiration===\nThe character of Harry Caul was inspired by surveillance technology expert Martin Kaiser, who also served as a technical consultant on the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0435187/bio |title=Martin Kaiser |website=IMDb |access-date=22 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.martykaiser.com/odyssey2.htm |title=Odyssey of an Eavesdropper |first1=Martin |last1=Kaiser |first2=Bob |last2=Stokes |website=Martykaiser.com |access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref>  According to Kaiser, the final scene of the film\u2014in which Caul is convinced he is being eavesdropped in his apartment, cannot find the listening device, and consoles himself by playing his saxophone\u2014was inspired by the passive [[covert listening device]]s created by [[L\u00e9on Theremin]], such as [[The Thing (listening device)|the Great Seal bug]]. \"He couldn't find out where [the bug] was because it was the instrument itself.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb-bdHGBcUY#t=45m00s | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211118/bb-bdHGBcUY| archive-date=2021-11-18 | url-status=live|title=The Last HOPE: TSCM - A Brief Primer on Electronic Surveillance and 'Bug' Detection (Complete) |publisher=GBPPR2 |date=22 September 2011 |access-date=22 May 2017 |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nCoppola also based Caul on the protagonist of [[Hermann Hesse|Herman Hesse]]'s 1927 novel ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'', Harry Haller, a \"total cipher\" who lives alone in a boarding house. Coppola also made Caul religious, originally intending the character to have a confession scene; Coppola has said that the practice of confession is \"one of the earliest forms of the invasion of privacy--earliest forms of surveillance.\"<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-02|last =  Suton |first = Koraljka      |title='The Conversation': Francis Ford Coppola's Paranoia-Ridden Tale of Surveillance, Guilt and Isolation|url=https://cinephiliabeyond.org/the-conversation/|access-date=2022-06-11  |website=Cinephilia & Beyond     | archive-url =    https://web.archive.org/web/20191230123341/https://cinephiliabeyond.org/the-conversation/| archive-date = 2019-12-30          |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film had a $1,600,000 budget and grossed $4,420,000 domestically.\n\n===Critical response===\nAccording to the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 96% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10.
