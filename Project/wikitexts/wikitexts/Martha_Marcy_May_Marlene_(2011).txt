The plot focuses on a young woman suffering from delusions and [[paranoia]] after returning to her family from an abusive [[cult]] in the [[Catskill Mountains]].\n\n==Plot==\nA 22-year-old woman named Martha has been living as a member of a [[cult]] in the [[Catskill Mountains]] for some time. The leader of the cult, Patrick, granted her the name Marcy May upon her initiation. Eventually, she decides to flee and escapes into the woods, arriving at a nearby town. In a diner restaurant, she is confronted by Watts, a cult member, who attempts to persuade her to return, but when she refuses, he lets her leave. Martha calls her sister Lucy, who picks her up and takes her to the vacation lake house in [[Connecticut]] that she shares with her husband, a successful and wealthy architect named Ted.\n\nWhile staying with Lucy and Ted at the lake house, Martha begins exhibiting strange behavior by [[Nude swimming|skinny dipping]] in a public lake, sleeping all the time, not eating, and arguing with her sister and brother-in-law about how to live, specifically arguing over the need for career and possessions. Lucy reveals she abandoned Martha and is now attempting to get her back into her life, while she and Ted are also trying to have their own child. One night, Martha climbs into bed with Ted and Lucy while they are having sex, angering Ted. Martha then attempts to phone the cult, but hangs up when one of the female members answers using the [[code name]] \"Marlene Lewis\".\n\nIn [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, Martha recalls a series of disturbing events that led to her escape the cult: Martha became an actual member through her friend, Zoe, that was also part of the cult. Upon her integration, she was drugged and raped by Patrick in an initiation ritual, which she later facilitated for other incoming female members. Patrick would later urge her to kill a cat, which she refused to do. She subsequently began participating in burglaries with the other cultists, including one where they murdered a homeowner who walked in on them. After witnessing the murder, Martha had a mental breakdown before Patrick forcefully subdued her and berated her for her failing to follow the cult's ideals.\n\nLucy and Ted host a party at their home, inviting numerous friends from the city. Martha is visibly nervous during the gathering and has a psychotic episode when she misidentifies the bartender as a cult member, and needs to be sedated. Ted attempts to convince Lucy to send Martha to a psychiatric hospital, an idea Lucy rejects.\n\nLater that night, Martha has a nightmare, concerning her moments with Patrick, and suffers a [[panic attack]]. Ted tries to calm her down, but Martha kicks him down the staircase. Lucy threatens to send Martha to a psychiatric hospital, to which Martha angrily responds that Lucy will be a terrible mother. The next day, Lucy and Martha somewhat reconcile, and Martha goes swimming. She sees a man watching her across the shore and leaves the water. When Martha departs the house with Lucy and Ted, she looks behind from the backseat of the car as another driver follows them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Elizabeth Olsen]] as Martha/Marcy May/\"Marlene Lewis\"\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Patrick\n* [[Sarah Paulson]] as Lucy\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as Ted\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as Watts\n* [[Christopher Abbott]] as Max\n* Michael Chmiel as Scruffy man\n* [[Maria Dizzia]] as Katie\n* [[Julia Garner]] as Sarah\n* [[Louisa Krause]] as Zoe\n}}\n\n==Production==\nSean Durkin started writing script of ''Martha Marcy May Marlene'' in 2007.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news |last=Lodge |first=Guy |date=October 31, 2011 |title=Interview: Sean Durkin on confronting his fears in 'Martha Marcy May Marlene' |work=[[Uproxx]] |url=https://uproxx.com/hitfix/interview-martha-marcy-may-marlene-director-sean-durkin/ |access-date=July 14, 2022}}</ref> When researching his script, Durkin read about what he calls \"the big ones\" of cults: [[Jonestown]], the [[Manson family]], the [[Unification Church of the United States]] and [[David Koresh]]. He realised he wanted to make something more experiential than political and downplayed the ideology and goals of the cult.<ref>{{cite news |title=Interview: Sean Durkin |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/interview-sean-durkin |access-date=2022-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123191059/http://www.timeout.com/london/film/interview-sean-durkin |archive-date=2013-01-23}}</ref>\n\nWhile researching, Durkin became fascinated by how someone gets into the farm or commune or group, and made a short film of the name ''Mary Last Seen'' about it starring [[Brady Corbet]], who plays cult recruiter Watts in both the short and feature films. ''Mary Last Seen'' won the award for best short film at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]] [[Directors' Fortnight]]. While ''Mary Last Seen'' was about how someone gets into the cult, ''Martha Marcy May Marlene'' was about what happens to someone when they get out of it. Durkin made the short to show the world Martha was in, and also with the intent to send it out with the script for ''Martha Marcy May Marlene'' to potential investors.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Mary Last Seen'' was selected for the [[Sundance Film Festival]], and Durkin was given a distribution deal with [[Fox Searchlight]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Benardello |first=Karen |date=2012-02-26 |title=Press Conference Interview With The Cast And Crew Of Mary Last Seen |work=wegotthiscovered.com |url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/interview-cast-crew-mary/ |access-date=2022-07-14}}</ref>\n\nDurkin and [[cinematographer]] Jody Lee Lipes were inspired by the films ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[3 Women]]'', ''[[Klute]]'', ''[[Interiors]]'', and ''[[Margot at the Wedding]]''.
