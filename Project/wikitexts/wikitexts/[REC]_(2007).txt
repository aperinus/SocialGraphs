While they are recording, the firehouse receives a call about an old woman, Mrs. Izquierdo, who is trapped in her apartment and screaming. \u00c1ngela and Pablo accompany two of the firefighters, \u00c1lex and Manu, to the apartment building on [[Rambla de Catalunya]], where two police officers are waiting. As they approach, the old woman becomes aggressive and attacks one of the officers, biting his neck. As they carry the injured officer downstairs, they find the building residents gathered in the lobby. The police and military have sealed off the building and trapped them inside.\n\nAs people begin to panic, \u00c1lex, who remained upstairs with the old woman, is thrown over the staircase railings and critically injured. Mrs. Izquierdo then kills a girl, and the remaining officer, Sergio, is forced to shoot her. \u00c1ngela and Pablo begin interviewing the residents. One of the interviewees is a sick little girl named Jennifer. Her mother Mari Carmen claims she has [[tonsillitis]], and says her dog, Max, is at the vet because he is sick as well. A health inspector in a [[hazmat suit]] arrives and attempts to treat the injured until they suddenly become extremely aggressive. After the injured are locked in the building's textile warehouse, the health inspector explains that they are infected with a virus similar to [[rabies]], and that the disease was traced back to a dog in the apartment building, and \u00c1ngela realizes it must be Max. When the residents confront Mari Carmen, Jennifer turns, bites her mother's face and flees upstairs. Sergio handcuffs Mari Carmen to the stairs and proceeds upstairs with Manu and Pablo. They find Jennifer but she bites Sergio, who tells the others to leave him. Manu and Pablo find the remaining residents running upstairs as the infected in the warehouse have broken down the door. Gradually, the rest of the apartment's residents are bitten and infected.\n\n\u00c1ngela, Pablo, and Manu, the three survivors, set out to find a key that will allow them to escape from the building via a large drain in the basement that is connected to the sewers. The apartment's infected residents start rushing them and Manu is bitten outside the apartment with the key, forcing \u00c1ngela and Pablo to take refuge in the [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]]. They discover a tape recorder which explains that the penthouse owner, an agent of [[Holy See|the Vatican]], was charged with the task of isolating an enzyme carried by a young [[Portugal|Portuguese]] girl named [[Tristana Medeiros]], whose symptoms suggest a [[demonic possession]]. As the agent attempted to treat Medeiros, the enzyme mutated and became contagious. The agent then sealed Tristana in the house to die of starvation. An infected boy within the attic damages the light on Pablo's camera, requiring Pablo to activate the camera's [[Night-vision device|night vision]]. A now-ghoulish Tristana emerges and searches the penthouse for food. \u00c1ngela and Pablo try to escape, but Pablo is killed by Tristana and drops the camera. \u00c1ngela then picks it up and looks through the screen. Seeing Tristana eating Pablo, she panics, trips, and drops the camera. The camera continues to record as \u00c1ngela is dragged into the darkness screaming.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Manuela Velasco]] as [[\u00c1ngela Vidal]]: a reporter for ''While You're Sleeping''\n*Pablo Rosso as Pablo: Angela's cameraman, who records the events in the apartment\n*Ferr\u00e1n Terraza as Manu: A firefighter dispatcher\n*David Vert as \u00c1lex: A firefighter dispatcher\n*Jorge-Yaman Serrano as Sergio: A young cop and the Older Policeman's partner\n*Vicente Gil as Older Policemen: A senior cop and Sergio's partner\n*Carlos Vicente as Guillem Marim\u00f3n: A doctor who resides in the building\n*Carlos Lasarte as C\u00e9sar: A tenant in the building\n*Mar\u00eda Lanau as Mari Carmen: Jennifer's mother and Max's owner\n*Claudia Silva as Jennifer: Mari's daughter and Max's owner\n*Martha Carbonell as Mrs. Izquierdo: The first infected tenant in the building\n*Akemi Goto as Japanese Woman: A [[Japanese people in Spain|Japanese immigrant]] who is married to the Chinese Man\n*Chen Min Kao as Chinese Man: A [[Chinese people in Spain|Chinese immigrant]] who is married to the Japanese Woman\n*Mar\u00eda Teresa Ortega as Grandmother: An Elderly resident in the apartment, and the Grandfather's wife\n*Manuel Bronchud as Grandfather: An Elderly resident in the apartment, and the Grandmother's husband\n*[[Javier Botet]] as [[Tristana Medeiros]]: A young woman who becomes Patient Zero for the virus.
