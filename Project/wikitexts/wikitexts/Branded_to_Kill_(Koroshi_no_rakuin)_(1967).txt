The story follows contract killer Goro Hanada as he is recruited by a mysterious woman named Misako for a seemingly impossible mission. When the mission fails, he is hunted by the phantom Number One Killer, whose methods threaten his life and sanity.\n\n''Branded to Kill'' was designated by its production company and distributor, [[Nikkatsu]], as a low-budget [[B movie]]. Dissatisfied with the original script, the studio called in Suzuki to rewrite and direct the film shortly prior to the start of production. Suzuki came up with many of his ideas for the project the night before or on the set while [[Filmmaking|filming]], and welcomed ideas from his colleagues; the screenplay is credited to Hachiro Guryu, a writing collective that consisted of Suzuki and seven other writers, including his frequent collaborators [[Takeo Kimura]] and [[Atsushi Yamatoya]]. Suzuki gave the film a [[Satire|satirical]], anarchic and visually eclectic bent, which the studio had previously warned him away from. The brief turnaround Suzuki was given to make ''Branded to Kill'' meant that post-production on the film was completed only a day before its pre-scheduled release on June 15, 1967.\n\nThe initial critical and commercial failure of ''Branded to Kill'' prompted Nikkatsu to ostensibly fire Suzuki for making \"movies that make no sense and no money\".<ref name=\"Branded to Kill DVD\"/> In response, Suzuki successfully sued Nikkatsu, and garnered support from student groups, like-minded filmmakers and the general public, causing a major controversy throughout the Japanese film industry. Suzuki was [[blacklist]]ed and did not make another feature film for a decade, but became a [[countercultural]] icon.<ref name=\"Sato\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s, ''Branded to Kill'' had gained a strong international [[cult following]]; film critics and enthusiasts now regard it as an [[Absurdism|absurdist]] [[masterpiece]].<ref name=\"Volcano\"/> It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as [[Jim Jarmusch]], [[John Woo]], [[Park Chan-wook]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]], and composer [[John Zorn]].<ref name=\"Zorn\">{{cite web\n| last = John\n| first = Zorn\n| title = Branded to Kill\n| publisher = Criterion\n| date = February 1999\n| url = http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/47-branded-to-kill\n| access-date = 2015-11-04}}</ref> ''Branded to Kill'' inspired a loose 1973 ''[[List of Nikkatsu Roman Porno films|Roman Porno]]'' [[remake]] directed by Yamatoya, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|\u611b\u6b32\u306e\u7f60|ja|3=\u611b\u6b32\u306e\u7f60|lt=Trapped in Lust}}'', and a loose 2001 sequel, ''[[Pistol Opera]]'', directed by Suzuki for Nikkatsu. The company has also hosted two major [[retrospective]]s spotlighting his career.\n\n==Plot==\nGoro Hanada, the Japanese underworld's third-ranked hitman, and his wife, Mami, fly into [[Tokyo]] and are met by Kasuga, a former hitman-turned-taxi driver. Hanada agrees to help Kasuga return to the underworld, and the three go to a club owned by [[yakuza]] boss Michihiko Yabuhara. The two men are hired to escort a client from Sagami Beach to [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]]. After the meeting, Yabuhara seduces Mami.\n\nDriving their client towards his destination, Hanada spots an ambush and dispatches several gunmen. Panicking, Kasuga attacks one of the ambushers, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, resulting in both of their deaths. Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots. Rushing back, he finds the client safe, while three additional ambushers have been shot through their foreheads. At another ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire; the client shoots Sakura dead. On his way home, Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a [[Death drive|deathwish]], gives him a ride. At home, Hanada has rough sex with Mami, fuelled by his [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for smelling boiling rice.\n\n[[Image:Annu Mari and Jo Shishido in Branded to Kill.jpg|300px|thumb|left|alt=A shirtless man shouts at a woman.

Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second through a pipe drain when he leans over a sink, and blasts his way into the third's office, escaping on an advertising balloon. Misako then offers him a near-impossible contract to kill a foreigner. During the job, a [[butterfly]] lands on the barrel of his rifle, causing him to miss the target and kill a bystander. Misako tells Hanada that he will lose his rank and be killed. Preparing to leave Japan, he is shot by Mami, who sets fire to their apartment and flees. Hanada escapes, his belt buckle having stopped the bullet.\n\nReunited, Hanada and Misako alternate between failed attempts by him to seduce her and them to kill each other; she succumbs to his advances when he promises to kill her. Afterwards, Handa realizes he loves Misako and is unable to kill her. Confused, he wanders the streets and passes out. The next day, he finds Mami at Yabuhara's club. She tries to seduce him, then fakes hysteria and tells him Yabuhara paid her to kill him and that the three men he had killed had stolen from Yabuhara's diamond smuggling operation, and the foreigner was an investigator sent by the supplier. Unmoved, Hanada kills her, gets drunk and waits for Yabuhara to return. Yabuhara arrives already dead with a bullet through his forehead.\n\nHanada returns to Misako's apartment, where a projected film shows her bound and tortured, and directs him to a [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], where he will be killed the following day. Hanada submits to the demand, but kills the assassins instead. The former client arrives, revealing himself to be the legendary Number One Killer. He intends to kill Hanada but, in thanks for his work, allows him a truce. As Handa holes up in Misako's apartment, Number One taunts him with threatening phone calls and forbids him to leave the apartment. Eventually, Number One moves in with the now-exhausted Hanada under the pretext that he is deciding how to kill him. They set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One suggests they eat out one day, but disappears during the meal.\n\nAt the apartment, Hanada finds a note and another film from Number One, stating he will be waiting at a [[gym]]nasium with Misako. Hanada arrives at the gym, but Number One does not show. As Hanada prepares to leave, a tape recording explains that Number One exhausts his targets before killing them. Tying a headband across his forehead, Hanada climbs into a boxing ring. Number One appears and shoots him. The headband stops the bullet and Hanada returns fire; Number One manages to shoot him several times before dying. As Hanada triumphantly declares himself the new Number One, Misako enters the gym. Hanada instinctively shoots her dead, again declares himself Number One, then falls out of the ring.<ref name=\"Yakuza Book\">{{cite book|last=Schilling |first=Mark |title=The Yakuza Movie Book: A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films |url=http://www.stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |date=September 2003 |isbn=1-880656-76-0 |pages=98\u2013104 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017060352/http://stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html |archive-date=October 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Shishido]] as Goro Hanada, the Number Three Killer: a hitman with a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for the smell of boiling rice.

Author Stephen Teo proposed that the antagonistic relationship between Hanada and Number One may have been analogous of Suzuki's relationship with studio president Ky\u016bsaku Hori. He compared Hanada's antagonizers to those who had been pressuring Suzuki to rein in his style over the previous two years. Teo cited Number One's sleeping with his eyes open and urinating where he sits, which the character explains as techniques one must master to become a \"top professional.\"<ref name=\"Teo\"/>\n\nThe film was shot in black and white Nikkatsuscope (synonymous with [[CinemaScope]] at a 2.35:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]). Due to the wide frame, moving a character forward did not produce the dynamic effect Suzuki desired. Instead, he relied on spotlighting and [[chiaroscuro]] imagery to create excitement and suspense. Conventional framing and [[film grammar]] were disregarded in favour of spontaneous inspiration. In editing, Suzuki frequently abandoned continuity, favouring abstract jumps in time and space as he found it made the film more interesting.<ref name=\"Branded to Kill DVD\"/> Critic David Chute suggested that Suzuki's stylistics had intensified\u2014in seeming congruence with the studio's demands that he conform:\n\n{{Blockquote|You can see the director reusing specific effects and pointedly cranking them up a notch.

The story would have concerned Noda (set to have been played by Shishido), an unranked member of the assassin's guild Hanada belongs to, being tasked by a woman named Ruiko with killing her husband, a formerly-ranked killer who has since disgraced the organization. Noda would have soon discovered that he and Ruiko's husband share similar killing methods, as both would leave their victims with eerie grins upon their deaths. According to Yamatoya, ''Branded to Kill Continued'' would have ''\"crank[ed] up\"'' the surrealist qualities of the original film, and given meaning to the ''Branded'' of the film's title (with the grins on Noda's victims acting as his \"brand\"); the film's climax would have taken place on an abandoned island and depicted a shootout against a computer.

Directed by Yamatoya from a script by fellow Hachiro Guryu member Y\u014dz\u014d Tanaka, the film was produced independently of Nikkatsu (in contrast to other ''Roman Porno'' films) by [[Genjiro Arato]], who also played the lead role of Hoshi and would later produce the three films comprising Suzuki's Taish\u014d Roman Trilogy, ''[[Zigeunerweisen (film)|Zigeunerweisen]]'' (1980), ''[[Kagero-za]]'' (1981) and ''[[Yumeji]]'' (1991).<ref name=\"arrow-22\">{{Cite AV media notes\n| title       = Trapped in Lust, Hachir\u014d Gury\u016b and the Case of the Missing Auteur\n| year        = 2014\n| page        = 22\n| author      = Sharp, Jason\n| type        = booklet\n| publisher   = Arrow Films\n| id          = FCD942\n}}</ref> Sharp has described ''Trapped in Lust'' as \"a brilliant testament to the fact that, rather than mere cheap exploitation, the [[adult film]] genre was regarded as liberating, daring and anti-authoritarian, and that interesting and intelligent things could be realised with it\".
