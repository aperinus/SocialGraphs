It is based on a [[Dave Robicheaux]] [[Heaven's Prisoners (novel)|homonymous novel]] by [[James Lee Burke]]. [[Harley Peyton]] and [[Scott Frank]] wrote the screenplay.\n\nThe film was followed by ''[[In the Electric Mist]]'' (2009), starring [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Dave Robicheaux. In the sequel, Robicheaux still lives in [[Louisiana]] and has come out of retirement as an [[Iberia Parish]] sheriff's detective.\n\n==Plot==\nA former police detective and [[Vietnam veteran]] in [[New Orleans]] and a recovering [[alcoholic]], Dave Robicheaux, is living a quiet life in the [[swamp]]lands of [[Louisiana]] with his wife Annie. The couple's tranquility is shattered one day when a drug [[smuggler]]'s plane crashes in a lake, right before their eyes.\n\nRobicheaux succeeds in rescuing a lone survivor from drowning, a young [[El Salvador|Salvador]]an female, whom Annie quickly pulled up onto the boat to administer [[Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation|mouth-to-mouth]] by covering the little girl\u2019s nostrils with her right cheek while breathing into her airway. With the arrival of a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] officer named Dautrieve and an inherent connection to Bubba Rocque, the leading [[Drug lord|drug kingpin]] in the area and Robicheaux's longtime friend from [[New Iberia]], Dave becomes involved in solving the case and consequently finds himself, his wife, and their new adoptive daughter Alafair in danger.\n\nRobicheaux is assaulted by two thugs as a warning. With help from his former girlfriend Robin, an [[exotic dancer]] who still has feelings for him, he continues to investigate. His longtime acquaintance Bubba denies any involvement, but Dave warns him and Bubba's sultry wife Claudette that he is going to find out who is behind all this and do something about it. He tracks down one of the men who attacked him, Eddie Keats, and splits his head open with a pool cue in Keat's own bar. Killers come to the Robicheaux home late one night. Robicheaux is unable to prevent his wife Annie from being killed. He falls off the wagon and neglects the young girl they adopted. Robin comes to stay with them.\n\nClearing his head, Robicheaux seeks vengeance against the three killers. He first goes after a large man called Toot, chasing him onto a [[streetcar]] and causing his death. Bubba and Claudette reassure a local mob boss named Giancano that they will not let this vendetta get out of hand, and Bubba gets into a fistfight with Robicheaux, falsely suspecting him of an affair with Claudette. Eddie Keats is found dead before Robicheaux can get to him. Going after the last and most dangerous of the killers, Victor Romero, he knows that someone else must be giving them orders.\n\nHe finds Romero and kills him. Then, going to Bubba's home, Robicheaux discovers that it is Claudette who planned the hit. After overhearing Claudette confessing her plan to take over the drug business, Bubba appears and shoots Claudette, and Robicheaux calls in the crime. When he returns home, Robin has left forever, and all Robicheaux has left in his life is his daughter Alafair.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as [[Dave Robicheaux]]\n* [[Kelly Lynch]] as Annie Robicheaux\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Robin Gaddis\n* [[Teri Hatcher]] as Claudette Rocque\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as Bubba Rocque\n* [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as Minos P.

I was standing on the balcony and I walked past these huge glass doors. Out of the corner of my eye I saw about 20 men and women in their seventies, just standing, staring at me as I walked past them completely naked. All I could do was burst into laughter. They were on a museum tour - caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Is it a bimbo? Is it a dame?
