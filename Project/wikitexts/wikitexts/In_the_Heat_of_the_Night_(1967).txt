It is based on [[John Ball (novelist)|John Ball]]'s 1965 [[In the Heat of the Night (novel)|novel of the same name]] and tells the story of Virgil Tibbs, a Black police [[detective]] from [[Philadelphia]], who becomes involved in a murder investigation in a small town in [[Mississippi]]. It stars [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Rod Steiger]], and was produced by [[Walter Mirisch]]. The screenplay was written by [[Stirling Silliphant]].\n\nAt the [[40th Academy Awards]] the film was nominated for seven Oscars, winning five including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Steiger. The quote \"They call me ''Mister Tibbs!''{{-\"}} was listed as number 16 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]'', a list of top film quotes. The film also appears on AFI's ''[[100 Years...100 Movies]]'', a list of the [[100 greatest movies]] in [[American cinema]]. In 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=preserve>{{Cite press release|title=Librarian of Congress Adds 25 Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-02-176/librarian-of-congress-adds-25-films-to-national-film-registry/2002-12-17/|agency=Library of Congress|date=December 17, 2002|access-date=May 1, 2020|archive-date=February 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205102818/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-02-176/librarian-of-congress-adds-25-films-to-national-film-registry/2002-12-17/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--As per WP:MOS-FILMS, the plot summary must not exceed 700 words-->\nWealthy industrialist Phillip Colbert moves to [[Sparta, Mississippi]], to build a factory. Late one night, police officer Sam Wood discovers Colbert's murdered body lying in the street. Wood finds [[Virgil Tibbs]], a black man with a fat wallet, at the train station and arrests him. Police chief Gillespie accuses him of murder and robbery but soon learns Tibbs is a top homicide detective from [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. Tibbs wants to leave town on the next train, but his boss suggests he stay in Sparta to help with the murder investigation. Though Gillespie, like many of Sparta's white residents, is racist, he and Tibbs reluctantly agree to work together.\n\nA doctor estimates that Colbert had been dead for less than an hour when his body was found. Tibbs examines the body and concludes the murder happened earlier than the doctor thought, the killer was right-handed, and the victim had been killed elsewhere and moved to where Wood found his body.\n\nGillespie arrests another suspect, Harvey Oberst, who protests his innocence. The police plan to beat him to extract a confession, but Tibbs reveals Oberst is left-handed and has witnesses to confirm his [[alibi]].  Frustrated by the ineptitude of the local police but impressed by Tibbs, Colbert's widow threatens to halt construction of the factory unless Tibbs leads the investigation, so the town's leading citizens are forced to comply with her demand.\n\nTibbs initially suspects the murderer is plantation owner Endicott, a genteel racist and one of the town's most powerful citizens, who publicly opposed Colbert's new factory. When Tibbs interrogates him, Endicott slaps him in the face. Tibbs slaps him back, so Endicott sends a gang of thugs after him. Gillespie rescues him and tells him to leave town to save himself, but Tibbs is convinced he can solve the case.\n\nTibbs asks Wood to re-trace his patrol car route during the night of the murder; Gillespie joins them. After questioning why Wood partially detours from his patrol route, Tibbs finds that Wood enjoys passing by the house of 16-year-old Delores Purdy, with its bright lights and unobscured windows, to watch her undress. Gillespie discovers that Wood made a sizable deposit to his bank account the day after the murder. He arrests Wood, despite Tibbs's protests that he is not the murderer. Tibbs tells Gillespie that the murder was committed at the site of the planned factory, which clears Wood because he could not have driven both his and Colbert's cars back into town.\n\nDelores' brother Mr. Purdy, a hostile local, brings her to the police station and files [[statutory rape]] charges against Wood for getting her pregnant. When Tibbs insists on being present during Delores' questioning, Purdy is offended that a black man is present during her interrogation and soon afterwards gathers a mob to attack Tibbs.\n\nTibbs pressures illegal abortionist Mama Caleba to reveal that she is about to provide an abortion for Delores. When she arrives and sees Tibbs, Delores runs away. Tibbs follows her and confronts her armed boyfriend, Ralph, a cook at a local roadside diner. Purdy's mob also arrives and holds Tibbs at gunpoint.\n\nTibbs tells Purdy to check Delores' purse for the money Ralph gave her for an [[abortion]], which he got from killing and robbing Colbert. Purdy realizes Tibbs is right when he examines the purse. After Purdy confronts him for getting his sister pregnant, Ralph shoots Purdy dead. Tibbs grabs Ralph's gun as Gillespie arrives on the scene. Ralph is arrested and confesses to the killing of Colbert. After [[hitchhiking]] a ride with Colbert and asking him for a job, Ralph attacked him at the construction site of the new factory, intending only to knock Colbert unconscious and rob him, but instead accidentally killing him.\n\nTibbs boards a train bound for Philadelphia, as Gillespie, having carried his suitcase, respectfully bids him farewell.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Virgil Tibbs\n* [[Rod Steiger]] as Gillespie\n* [[Warren Oates]] as Sam Wood\n* [[Lee Grant]] as Mrs. Colbert\n* [[Larry Gates]] as Endicott\n* [[James Patterson (actor)|James Patterson]] as Mr. Purdy\n* [[William Schallert]] as Mayor Schubert\n* [[Beah Richards]] as Mama Caleba\n* [[Peter Whitney]] as Courtney\n* [[Kermit Murdock]] as Henderson\n* [[Larry D.

He died two months after the film's release.\n\n==Production==\nAlthough the film was set in [[Sparta, Mississippi]], most of the movie was filmed in [[Sparta, Illinois]], where many of the film's landmarks can still be seen.\n\nJewison, Poitier, and Steiger worked together and got along well during the filming, but Jewison had problems with the Southern authorities, and Poitier had reservations about coming south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] for filming. Despite their reservations, Jewison decided to shoot part of the film in [[Dyersburg]] and [[Union City, Tennessee|Union City]], Tennessee anyway, while the rest was filmed in Sparta, [[Chester, Illinois|Chester]] (Harvey Oberst chase scene), and [[Freeburg, Illinois|Freeburg]] (Compton's diner), Illinois.\n\nThe scene of Tibbs slapping Endicott is not present in the novel. According to Poitier, the scene was almost not in the movie. In the textbook ''Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA'', Poitier states: \"I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll make this movie for you if you give me your absolute guarantee when he slaps me I slap him right back and you guarantee that it will play in every version of this movie. I try not to do things that are against nature.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Sanders |first=Vivienne |title=Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA, 1850\u20132009 |location=London |publisher=Hodder Education |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-471-83825-5}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=May 2021}} [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]], in his book, ''Pictures at a Revolution''. states that copies of the original draft of the screenplay clearly depict the scene as filmed, which has been confirmed by both Jewison and Silliphant. Nevertheless, Poitier is correct that Tibbs' slapping of Endicott was not originally envisioned. After Endicott's slap, Silliphant's initial [[step-outline]] reads: \"Tibbs has all he can do to restrain himself. The butler drops his head, starts to pray. 'For him, Uncle Tom', Tibbs says furiously, 'not for me!{{' \"}} Tibbs' counter slap first appears in Silliphant's revised step-outline.<ref name=Heetebrij>{{cite journal |last=Heetebrij |first=Geert |url=https://christianscholars.com/subversive-christian-allegory-in-in-the-heat-of-the-night-1967/ |title=Subversive Christian Allegory in in the Heat of the Night (1967) |date=April 15, 2020 |journal=Christian Scholar's Review |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=249\u201362 |access-date=April 30, 2020 |archive-date=May 10, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200510144843/https://christianscholars.com/subversive-christian-allegory-in-in-the-heat-of-the-night-1967/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nTibbs urging the butler to pray for Endicott was part of Silliphant's adaptation of ''In the Heat of the Night'' as a subversive Christian allegory, featuring Tibbs as the messianic outsider who confronts the racist establishment of Sparta.<ref name=Heetebrij />\n\nThe film is also important for being the first major Hollywood film in color that was lit with proper consideration for a black person. [[Haskell Wexler]] recognized that standard strong lighting used in filming tended to produce too much glare on dark complexions and rendered the features indistinct. Accordingly, Wexler adjusted the lighting to feature Poitier with better photographic results.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=221}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name = In the Heat of the Night\n| type =

films like ''[[The Chase (1966 film)|The Chase]]'' and ''[[Hurry Sundown (film)|Hurry Sundown]]'', which offered confused visions of the South, ''In the Heat of the Night'' depicted a tough, edgy vision of a Southern town that seemed to hate outsiders more than itself, a theme reflecting the uncertain mood of the time, just as the [[civil rights movement]] attempted to take hold. Canadian director Jewison wanted to tell an anti-racist story of a white man and a black man working together in spite of difficulties. Jewison said that this film proved a conviction he had held for a long time: \"It's you against the world. It's like going to war. Everybody is trying to tell you something different and they are always putting obstacles in your way.\"\n\nA particularly famous line in the film comes immediately after Gillespie mocks the name \"Virgil\": <blockquote>Gillespie: \"That's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia! What do they call you up there?\"<br> (An annoyed) Tibbs: \"They call me '''''Mister''''' Tibbs!\"</blockquote> This reply was later listed as number 16 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]'', a list of top film quotes, and was also the title of the [[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!|movie's sequel]].\n\nAnother important scene that surprised audiences at the time occurs when Tibbs is slapped by Endicott. Tibbs responds by immediately slapping him back. In a [[San Francisco]] pre-screening, Jewison was concerned when the young audience was laughing at the film as if it were a comedy. The audience's stunned reaction to the slapping scene convinced Jewison that the film was effective as drama.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=288\u201390}} That scene helped make the film so popular for audiences, finally seeing the top black film actor physically strike back against bigotry, that the film earned the nickname, ''[[Superspade]] Versus the Rednecks''.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=336}} During the film's initial run, Steiger and Poitier occasionally went to the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]] in [[New York City|New York]] to amuse themselves seeing how many black and white audience members there were, which could be immediately ascertained by listening to the former cheering Tibbs's retaliatory slap and the latter whispering \"Oh!\" in astonishment.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=335\u20136}}\n\n===Critical response===\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Jewison for crafting \"a film that has the look and sound of actuality and the pounding pulse of truth.\" He further praised Steiger and Poitier for \"each giving physical authority and personal depth\" to their performances.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/08/03/archives/screen-in-the-heat-of-the-night-a-racial-drama-poitier-plays.html |title=Screen: 'In the Heat of the Night,' a Racial Drama |work=The New York Times |page=26 |url-access=subscription |date=August 3, 1967 |access-date=May 6, 2021 |archive-date=May 7, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210507123548/https://www.nytimes.com/1967/08/03/archives/screen-in-the-heat-of-the-night-a-racial-drama-poitier-plays.html |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine wrote that \"almost everything in this movie is good\u2014the sharply drawn minor characters, the careful plotting, the wonderful rightness of each scene's setting, mood and dialogue.
