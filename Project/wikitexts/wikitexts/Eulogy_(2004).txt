An [[international co-production]] between companies from [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], and [[Cinema of the United States|the United States]], the film follows a dysfunctional family as secrets come to light at the funeral of the family's patriarch.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with Kate Collins ([[Zooey Deschanel]]) walking up to a house. She knocks and a woman answers the door. Kate explains that although she doesn't know her she has a long story to explain.\n\nThe story begins with the death of her grandfather, Edmund Collins ([[Rip Torn]]). The movie then goes on to show how all the family members found out about the death, and how they came together for the funeral. As the Collins family joins their widowed mother/grandmother, Charlotte Collins ([[Piper Laurie]]), the family's dysfunctions and idiosyncrasies come to light. Kate's father, Daniel Collins ([[Hank Azaria]]), is an \"[[Pornographic film|obscure foreign film]]\" actor whose career peaked at age 8 when he appeared in a peanut butter commercial. Kate's uncle, Skip Collins ([[Ray Romano]]), is an overly hormonal father of overly hormonal twin sons (Fred and Ted) who managed to run their mother out of their family. Kate's aunt, Lucy Collins ([[Kelly Preston]]), and her girlfriend Judy Arnolds ([[Famke Janssen]]) are both criticized throughout the movie because of their relationship. Most of this criticism comes from Kate's other aunt, Alice Collins ([[Debra Winger]]). The bossy, intimidating Alice has managed to both raise her three children and drive her husband into submissive silence, because of her persistent talking and badgering. Once they all arrive at the only family home  Kate is told by Charlotte that her grandfather wished for her to give the [[eulogy]] at the funeral.\n\nAfter a family dinner that goes south when Lucy and Judy announce that they are getting married, tired of the family feuding, Charlotte tries to commit suicide by overdosing on a medication. While the family sits in the waiting room they run into Samantha ([[Glenne Headly]]), a nurse at the hospital who is also an old friend of Alice's. After having her stomach pumped and after rejoining the family, Charlotte tries again by jumping out of a moving van on a bridge and although she does not die, she is seriously injured and spends the remainder of the movie in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the film, Kate continually tries to come up with a eulogy while dealing with a previous romance with Ryan ([[Jesse Bradford]]), from whom she ran away after being caught by Ryan's mother who came home while Ryan and Kate were having sex. Kate gets reacquainted with Ryan (after trying to dodge him several times around town) and their relationship reignites.\n\nAt Edmund's [[Will (law)|will reading]], it is revealed that Edmund has three families that don't know about each other. This explains Edmund's inability to keep names and number of children straight over the years before also dropping the bomb that he was up to his \"prostate in debt\". Kate is tasked with finding and telling the other two families of Edmund's demise.\n\nUltimately, per Edmund's will, he is placed in a casket and floated out on a local lake in a boat. Ted and Fred, having previously filled the casket with [[gasoline]], start shooting fiery arrows from a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] at the casket. During this time Kate finally gives her eulogy. One of the arrows eventually hits the casket and a moment later the casket, completely unexpectedly, explodes in a fiery explosion and completely demolishes the boat, body, and casket in a splintery mess.\n\nThe movie ends with Kate talking to the woman from the beginning of the film. The woman explains she is not actually the person she was looking for but rather her neighbor.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Kate Collins\n** Natasha Sheridan as young Kate\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Daniel Collins\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Judy Arnolds\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Lucy Collins\n* [[Ray Romano]] as Skip Collins\n* [[Debra Winger]] as Alice Collins\n* [[Jesse Bradford]] as Ryan Carmichael\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as Samantha\n* [[Piper Laurie]] as Charlotte Collins\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Edmund Collins\n* [[Rance Howard]] as Lance Sommers\n* [[Paget Brewster]] as Aunt Lily\n* [[Eric Pierpoint|Eric Peirpoint]] as Mr. Carmichael\n* [[Sherman Howard]] as Funeral director\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] as Parson Banke\n* [[Denise Dowse]] as Judge\n* [[Claudette Nevins]] as Barbara Collins\n* Curtis and Keith Garcia as Fred and Ted Collins\n* Matthew Feder as Alice's silent son\n* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] and Jordan Moen as Alice's silent daughters\n* [[Michael Panes]] as Adult film director\n* [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]] as Adult film cameraman\n* [[Vincent Castellanos]] as Adult film actor\n* [[Brian Posehn]] as Video store clerk\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* Daniel Baur\t...\tco-producer\n* Kirk D'Amico\t...\tproducer\n* [[Lucas Foster]]\t...\tproducer\n* Shelly Glasser\t...\texecutive producer\n* [[Steven Haft]]\t...\tproducer\n* Bo Hyde\t...\texecutive producer\n* Stefan Jonas\t...\texecutive producer\n* Gerd Koechlin\t...\tassociate producer\n* [[Richard Barton Lewis]]\t...\tproducer\n* [[Jonas McCord]]\t...\texecutive producer\n* Kendall Rhodes\t...\texecutive producer (as Kendall Morgan)\n* Rory Rosegarten\t...\texecutive producer\n* Andreas Thiesmeyer\t...\tassociate producer\n* Jeanne Van Cott\t...\tco-producer\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was released in 22 venues on October 15, 2004, and earned $41,788 in its first weekend, ranking #51 in the North American box office and seventh among the week's new releases.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2004&wknd=42&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for October 15-17, 2004 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=October 18, 2004 | accessdate=November 24, 2016}}</ref> At the end of its run, two weeks later on October 28, the film grossed $75,076 domestically and $14,705 overseas for a worldwide total of $89,781.<ref name=mojo>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=eulogy.htm | title=''Eulogy'' (2004) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=October 28, 2004 | accessdate=November 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''Eulogy'' received generally negative reviews from critics.
