Stylization does not dictate capitalization. --> is a 2015 American [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] directed by [[Jonathan Demme]] and written by [[Diablo Cody]], about a woman who leaves her family to become a rock star and later gets a chance to make amends. The film stars [[Meryl Streep]], [[Mamie Gummer]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[Sebastian Stan]], [[Rick Springfield]], and [[Audra McDonald]]. The film marks Streep and Kline's third collaboration after ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982) and ''[[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|A Prairie Home Companion]]'' (2006). It was Demme's final narrative film before his death in April 2017.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on October 13, 2014, in [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[TriStar Pictures]] financed, and released the film on August 7, 2015. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of the cast but criticised its screenplay and execution, and grossed $41 million against its $18\u201330 million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\nRicki chased her dreams of becoming a famous rock star by abandoning her family. She gets a chance to put things right when her ex-husband Pete asks her to visit Indianapolis and help their estranged daughter Julie through a difficult time.\n\nRicki has a rock band that plays a regular gig at a small bar, when she is not working as a cashier to make ends meet. Julie recently attempted suicide because her husband cheated on her and is divorcing her. Despite being broke, Ricki comes to Indianapolis to help her daughter, but Julie is hostile. Likewise, her two sons are hostile and unwelcoming. One has come out as gay and the other recently became engaged, though no one told their mother. Still, Ricki gets through to Julie. \n\nRicki's ex-husband's second wife, Maureen, returns unexpectedly, confronting Ricki with some hard truths. She wasn't there for her children when they needed her and Maureen was. Ashamed, Ricki returns to her band in California angry and bitter, insulting her guitarist who is in love with her. He makes her realize he cares and they make love. Maureen sends Ricki an invitation to the son's wedding as an olive branch, but Ricki can't afford to go. Her boyfriend sells his best guitar to pay for the tickets. \n\nDespite her attempts at reconciliation, she's clearly still an outsider. The wedding guests look askance at Ricki when she gets up to toast the bride and groom. As her gift, having no money, she has her band take over and play for the guests. Her son and his bride start the wedding dance and slowly the guests join in.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Linda Brummel / Ricki Rendazzo \n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Pete Brummel\n* [[Mamie Gummer]] as Julie Brummel\n* [[Audra McDonald]] as Maureen Brummel\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as Joshua Brummel\n* Nick Westrate as Adam Brummel\n* [[Rick Springfield]] as Greg\n* [[Ben Platt]] as Daniel\n* [[Charlotte Rae]] as Oma Brummel, Pete's mother\n* [[Rick Rosas]] as Buster\n* [[Bernie Worrell]] as Billy\n* [[Joe Vitale (musician)|Joe Vitale]] as Joe \n* [[Gabriel Ebert]] as Max\n* [[Carmen Carrera]] as Ricki's lead hairstylist\n* [[Keala Settle]] as Bar Patron\n* [[Beau Sia]] as Desmond\n* [[Hailey Gates]] as Emily\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Diablo Cody]] based the script in part on her mother-in-law Terry Cieri, who has fronted a New Jersey bar band for years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.app.com/story/entertainment/arts/2015/07/23/meet-jersey-rocker-behind-meryl-streeps-new-film/30563585/ |title=Meryl Streep plays Toms River mom in new film |first=Alex |last=Biese |work=[[Asbury Park Press]] |date=July 24, 2015 |access-date=July 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/08/meryl-streep-ricki-and-the-flash |title=Meet the Woman Who Inspired Meryl Streep's ''Ricki and the Flash'' Character |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |first=Julie |last=Miller |date=August 5, 2015 |access-date=September 11, 2015}}</ref> Cody said, \"I watched her on stage so many times, and I thought to myself, 'This woman's life is a movie.'{{-\"}}<ref name=\"LearningGuitar\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/meryl-streep-learning-guitar-diablo-721337|title=Meryl Streep Learning Guitar for Diablo Cody Movie|date=August 1, 2014|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last1=Abramovitch|first1=Seth|access-date=October 17, 2014}}</ref> Cody specifically wrote the role of Ricki with Streep in her mind noting that actresses over 50 in Hollywood typically don't get complicated parts.<ref name=\"LearningGuitar\" />  Ricki's daughter is played by Streep's daughter, [[Mamie Gummer]]<ref name=Kline-Gummer>{{cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title=Kevin Kline, Mamie Gummer in Negotiations to Join Meryl Streep in 'Ricki and the Flash'|url=https://www.thewrap.com/kevin-kline-mamie-gummer-in-negotiations-to-join-meryl-streep-in-ricki-and-the-flash/|access-date=October 17, 2014 |publisher=[[TheWrap]] |date=June 17, 2014}}</ref> marking the third film the two have made together, after 1986's ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]'' and 2007's ''[[Evening (film)|Evening]]''.\"<ref name=\"LearningGuitar\" />\n\n''Ricki and the Flash'' was dedicated to \"'''Rick the Bass Player'''\", which is the stage name for [[Rick Rosas]] who played \"Buster\", the Flash's bass player in the film, and who died in November 2014.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming was first set to begin on October 1, 2014, in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"LearningGuitar\" /> [[Principal photography]] officially began on October 13, 2014, in [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Meryl Streep filming 'Ricki and the Flash' in Rye, NY|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2014/10/15/meryl-streep-filming-ricki-and-the-flash-in-rye-ny/|access-date=October 17, 2014|publisher=onlocationvacations.com|date=October 15, 2014}}</ref> On October 14, Streep was spotted filming some scenes at Numi & Co.
