It stars [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]], along with the voices of [[Frank Langella]] and [[Tommy Lee Jones]]. It depicts two factions of toys which turn sentient after being programmed with a military microprocessor, putting in danger when one faction ultimately turns lethal.\n\nReleased on July 10, 1998, in the United States, the film received mixed reviews, but grossed $87.5 million on a $40 million budget. ''Small Soldiers'' marks the last on-screen film role of [[Phil Hartman]], who was murdered two months before the film's American premiere, and is dedicated in his memory. It was also the final film role of [[Clint Walker]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT guidelines before adding material. The plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nTop defense contractor GloboTech Industries acquires the Heartland Toy Company and as part of the move, Globotech CEO Gil Mars commissions Heartland toy designers Larry Benson and Irwin Wayfair to develop [[smart toy|actual live action toys]] capable of \"playing back\". Mars selects Larry's Commando Elite for the project and Irwin's Gorgonites for their enemies, rejecting Irwin's initial concept of the Gorgonites as [[educational toys|learning toys]]. Faced with a tight three-month deadline for the toys' release, Larry forgoes safety testing, then uses Irwin's password and chooses GloboTech's X1000 microprocessor to activate the toys.\n\nTeenager Alan Abernathy signs off for a shipment of inventory at his family's toy store without his father's consent. He and delivery driver Joe activate Archer and Chip Hazard. Alan's neighbor and love interest, Christy Fimple, buys Chip Hazard for her brother Timmy's birthday. Alan returns home to discover Archer in his backpack. Meanwhile, the Commando Elite apparently attack the Gorgonites in the toy store. Alan calls the company and files a complaint. Later, when Larry and Irwin listen to Alan's message on the answering machine, Irwin shockingly discovers the X1000 was designed for smart munitions guidance; a Globotech engineer reveals the artificial intelligence circuit is designed to learn over time within the confines of the software's programming, but issues with electromagnetic pulse shielding halted mass production.\n\nThe Commando Elite pursue Alan to his home and attempt to interrogate and kill Archer in the kitchen. Alan intervenes and is wounded by Nick Nitro, whom he partially destroys by shoving in the garbage disposal. His parents, Stuart and Irene, arrive in the kitchen, having heard the sounds of the scuffle. Alan attempts to explain what is going on, but with Archer not supporting his explanation, neither believe him. The next day, Alan and Archer find the Gorgonites in a dumpster at the store. The Gorgonites were mistakenly made with Irwin's initial software, giving them very friendly and inquisitive personalities. At home, Alan learns that the Gorgonites seek to find their home Gorgon, which they mistakenly believe to be in [[Yosemite National Park]]. Through tapping the Abernathys' phone line, the Commando Elite learn of Alan's interest in Christy, tie up and gag Timmy, sedate and subdue the Fimples and use the destroyed Nick Nitro's AI chip to engineer Christy's Gwendy fashion dolls as reinforcements. The Commando Elite then hold Christy hostage to force Alan into surrendering the Gorgonites.\n\nAlan and Archer sneak into the Fimples' house to save Christy, but the Gwendy dolls subdue Alan. Archer frees Christy from her bonds, and together they save Alan and destroy the Gwendys before escaping. The Commando Elite pursue them in improvised vehicles, but all except Chip Hazard are destroyed in a crash. Alan, Christy, and Archer return to Alan's house, only to find both their families waiting for them, believing that Alan kidnapped Christy and immobilized the Fimples. This time, Stuart and Irene believe Alan and Christy's account of the Gorgonites and the Commando Elite, but Phil and Marion, Christy's parents, remain skeptical. Irwin and Larry arrive and talk to Alan about his voicemail, but Chip Hazard then attacks the house with a new force of Commando Elite from a hijacked recall shipment by Joe and with more improvised vehicles and weapons. The Commando Elite attack the Gorgonites and the humans, causing the house's electricity supply to short out.\n\nInspired by Irwin's advice to create an EMP blast, Alan heads out to force an overload of the power lines. Christy, Irwin, and Larry head to the Fimples' house to turn on all electronic items inside and wedge the circuit breakers open for a larger surge. The Gorgonites emerge and fight back against the Commando Elite. Chip Hazard flies to the top of the power line pole to stop Alan, where he battles and defeats Archer, but Alan thrusts him into the power transformers just as Larry and Irwin activate the breakers, triggering the EMP blast, which destroys him along with the remaining Commando Elite.\n\nMars arrives in his helicopter during the police and fire department clean-up the next day. He pays Joe and both families for damages, as well as buying their silence from the media, and orders Larry and Irwin to repurpose the Commando Elite for military use before they head back to the Heartland Toy Company. Among the craziness of the aftermath, Alan and Christy part on highly amicable terms, having agreed to start a relationship with each other. Alan later discovers that the Gorgonites have evaded the EMP blast by hiding underneath the Fimples' large satellite dish. The Abernathys bring the Gorgonites to Yosemite National Park, where Alan sends them out in a large toy boat from his father's store to find their home of Gorgon.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Christy Fimple\n* [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] as Alan Abernathy\n* [[Jay Mohr]] as Larry Benson\n* [[Phil Hartman]] as Phil Fimple\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Stuart Abernathy\n* [[Denis Leary]] as Gil Mars\n* [[Ann Magnuson]] as Irene Abernathy\n* [[David Cross]] as Irwin Wayfair\n* [[Wendy Schaal]] as Marion Fimple\n* [[Jacob Smith (actor)|Jacob Smith]] as Timmy Fimple\n* [[Alexandra Wilson]] as Ms. Kegel\n* [[Dick Miller]] as Joe\n* [[Robert Picardo]] as Ralph Quist\n* Jonathan Bouck as Brad\n* [[Belinda Balaski]] as Neighbor\n* [[Rance Howard]] as Husband\n* [[Jackie Joseph]] as Wife\n{{div col end}}\n\n''Small Soldiers'' was Hartman's last on-screen role before his death and the film is dedicated to his memory.<ref>{{cite news|title=1998's top closing moments|work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|date=1998-12-06|page=Arts 1|author=Philpot, Robert}}</ref>\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Archer\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Chip Hazard\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Brick Bazooka\n* [[Jim Brown]] as Butch Meathook\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Kip Killigan\n* [[Clint Walker]] as Nick Nitro\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Link Static\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Slamfist/Scratch-It\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Insaniac/Troglokhan\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Punch-It\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as Ocula\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] and [[Christina Ricci]] as Gwendy Dolls\nExcluding Jones and Dern, the Commando Elite are voiced by cast members from the 1967 film ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]''.

The film was the last role for Walker before his retirement from acting.\n\n==Production==\nOn making the film, director [[Joe Dante]] recalled, \"Originally I was told to make an edgy picture for teenagers, but when the sponsor tie-ins came in the new mandate was to soften it up as a kiddie movie. Too late, as it turned out, and there are elements of both approaches in there. Just before release it was purged of a lot of action and explosions.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brew|first=Simon|title=The Den of Geek interview: Joe Dante|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/gremlins/13227/the-den-of-geek-interview-joe-dante|publisher=The Den of Geek|access-date=January 9, 2016|date=February 21, 2008}}</ref> On the film's special effects, Dante stated, \"We were planning to use a lot of [[Stan Winston]]'s puppets\u2014he had made some very elaborate puppets that could do a lot of things.

It peaked at 103 on the ''Billboard 200''. The film score was composed and conducted by veteran composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]]. In addition, a [[Small Soldiers (video game)|video game based on the film]] was developed by [[Danger Close Games|DreamWorks Interactive]] and released by [[Electronic Arts]] on September 30, 1998. [[Kenner Products]] (a subsidiary of [[Hasbro]]) produced a line of toys, which featured the Gorgonites and the Commando Elite. [[Burger King]] teamed up with the film to promote their new product, the Rodeo Burger. They created a line of kids' meal toys tied to the film. They were met with some controversy after the film received a PG-13 rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA). Burger King executives claimed this caught the company by surprise as they were led to believe the film would receive no higher than a PG rating. According to [[Joe Dante]], the MPAA gave the film a PG-13 rating due to the scene in which the Commando Elite put drugs in Phil and Marion's drink. While the pamphlet accompanying the toys included the disclaimer \"While toys are suitable for children of all ages, the movie ''Small Soldiers'' may contain material that is inappropriate for younger children,\" some restaurants accepted an exchange for Mr. Potato Head toys.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Neville|first1=Ken|title=\"Small Soldiers,\" Big Controversy|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/36690/small-soldiers-big-controversy|website=E Online| date=10 July 1998 |access-date=12 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/582385-small-soldiers-squad-commander|title=Small Soldiers: Squad Commander for PC \u2013 GameFAQs|website=gamefaqs.gamespot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Abrams|first1=Simon|title=Like Going to Church: Joe Dante on \"The Movie Orgy\"|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/like-going-to-church-joe-dante-on-the-movie-orgy|website=rogerebert.com|access-date=February 1, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Cancelled remake==\nA remake of ''Small Soldiers'' was in development by [[20th Century Fox]] called ''Toymageddon''.
