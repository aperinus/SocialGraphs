It tells the story about the crew members of the titular nature show heading to [[Ecuador]] to investigate a [[Bigfoot]] sighting in order to keep the show from being cancelled. The film received negative reviews and was a [[box office bomb]], making less than $7 million against a $20 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nPeter Gaulke is the host of an unsuccessful [[nature program]] called ''Strange Wilderness'' which was originally hosted by Peter's late father.\n\nOne day, Peter and his sidekick/[[Production sound mixer|soundman]] Fred Wolf are told by network head Ed Lawson about the negative aspects of ''Strange Wilderness'' since the death of Peter's father like low ratings, poor content, inappropriate footage, referring to all [[indigenous peoples]] as [[Pygmy peoples|pygmies]] aside from the littering, and bad things happening to people in footage like an alligator attack on someone and a guy at a peace rally who was on fire. Unless something big happens, ''Strange Wilderness'' will be cancelled in two weeks.\n\nPeter brainstorms ideas to keep ''Strange Wilderness'' on the air with Fred, [[equipment manager]] Lynn Cooker, driver Danny Gutierrez, [[Camera operator|camera man]] Junior, and his father's old friend/original cameraman Milas. Bill Calhoun, his dad's friend, brings him photos of [[Bigfoot]] hiding in [[Ecuador]] and a map to his cave. Sky Pierson, the host of a more successful wildlife show, has offered $1,000 for the map. Unable to pay this, Peter tells Bill that he will have it in a week at his mountain cabin.\n\nPeter, Fred, Lynn, Danny, and Junior start preparing for the long trip. They also bring in two more people like Whitaker, a former car mechanic now [[Animal training|animal handler]], and Cheryl, a travel agent.\n\nStopping to shoot footage of [[sea lion]]s, Danny dresses up as a seal for better angles, gets [[Shark attack|attacked by a shark]], and ends up hospitalized. Outside the hospital, Peter and Fred get into trouble with a local gang, get their front teeth knocked out, and have to go to a dentist. These incidents cause more funds being drained.\n\nThey arrive at Bill's cabin only to learn he already sold the map to Pierson. However, Bill makes a copy of the map from security cameras. He also enlists the help of renowned tracker Gus Hayden, but they are unable to pay him. While urinating in the bushes, Peter is attacked by a mother [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], ending up with his penis inside its mouth. They rush him to a hospital to remove it from his penis. A wildlife ranger and a conservationist that \"own\" the turkey stop the doctor from cutting the turkey's head off, offering a $5,000 reward for the bird's return.\n\nContinuing their journey, they eventually reach Ecuador. There, they meet up with Dick, an explorer and a friend of Bill who takes them to Gus Hayden.\n\nThe next morning however, they wake up to find that Gus has left, stolen their equipment, and Cheryl is missing. Though hesitant and with Peter not willing to give up, Dick agrees to lead the group through the jungle. During the night, Cheryl catches up with them and explains she saw Gus stealing their equipment and pretended to run off with him so she could get the map back.\n\nThe next day while crossing the river, Dick is attacked and eaten by [[piranha]]s. Coming across Pierson's camp, they find he and his team have been killed by local [[Pygmy peoples|pygmies]]. The group then gathers the equipment and eventually reach Bigfoot's cave. While filming, a confused Bigfoot steps out and gets gunned down by the scared group. Not sure how to end the show in a good way later that night, Cooker comes up with the idea of showing Bigfoot committing suicide.\n\nThe surviving members return to the studio to show Lawson their footage where they tried to resuscitate Bigfoot. Lawson berates them for their ridiculousness and cancels ''Strange Wilderness''. This leads to a fight within the group.\n\nOne year later, Peter gets a visit from Milas who encourages him to revive ''Strange Wilderness''. Peter gets everyone back together and they make an episode about the shark attack using footage of them vomiting into the shark's mouth at the scene of the incident as well as Danny getting his arm bitten by that shark. Peter and Fred show it to Lawson. Impressed with the footage, Lawson states to Pete that people love shark attacks. With Pierson dead, Lawson puts ''Strange Wilderness'' back on the air.\n\nA postscript states that ''Strange Wilderness'' became successful again and dominated the 3:00 AM slot. Six months later, Peter's group went searching for the [[Loch Ness Monster]] where hilarity occurred in [[Scotland]]. They remain friends to this day.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Peter Gaulke, the host of ''Strange Wilderness''.\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Fred Wolf, the [[Production sound mixer|soundman]] for ''Strange Wilderness'' and Peter's sidekick.\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Lynn Cooker, the [[equipment manager]] for ''Strange Wilderness''.\n* [[Kevin Heffernan (comedian)|Kevin Heffernan]] as Whitaker, a former car [[mechanic]] that becomes the [[Animal training|animal handler]] for ''Strange Wilderness''.\n* [[Ashley Scott]] as Cheryl, a travel agent that gets involved with ''Strange Wilderness''.\n* [[Peter Dante]] as Danny Gutierrez, an RV driver.\n* [[Harry Hamlin]] as Sky Pierson, the host of a rival nature TV show.\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Gus Hayden, an animal tracker.\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as Bill Calhoun, an old friend of Peter's father.\n* [[Justin Long]] as Junior, a [[Camera operator|camera man]] for ''Strange Wilderness''.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Ed Lawson, the head of the TV studio K-Pip that broadcasts ''Strange Wilderness''.\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Milas, an old friend of Peter's dad and the original camera man on ''Strange Wilderness''.\n* [[John Farley (actor)|John Farley]] as a mountain doctor\n* [[Oliver Hudson]] as TJ, an animal handler.\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Dick, an explorer who is friends with Gus.\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as the voice of a ranger in a helicopter\n* [[Kevin Alejandro]] as Hispanic Man #1\n* [[Jake Abel]] as conservationist\n* [[Jim Meskimen]] as Park Ranger Don, a park ranger who interrupts one of Peter's filming activities for ''Strange Wilderness'' because he did not have a permit to film in the forest.\n* David Mattey as [[Bigfoot]], a Cryptid that was sighted in Ecuador.\n* Jennifer Perks as Debra\n* Meg Wolf as Judy, a K-Pip receptionist.\n* Molly Wolf as Little Girl\n* [[Bill Burrud]] as Peter Gaulke's father (archive footage)\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2020}}\n''Strange Wilderness'' received highly negative reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it a 2% approval rating, based on 48 reviews with an average rating of 2.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"''Strange Wilderness'' is a laugh-free comedy that's both aimless and overly crass.\" Only one review counted for the website was positive, who was [[Donald Clarke (writer)|Donald Clarke]] of ''[[The Irish Times]]'', who wrote \"Strange Wilderness features a scene in which Steve Zahn has to have a turkey surgically removed from his genitals. The film also sees Harry Hamlin cut in half by pygmies and finds time for Ernest Borgnine to scowl at the camera.
