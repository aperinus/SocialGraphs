The film was directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]], written by [[Walter Hill]], and stars [[Steve McQueen]], [[Ali MacGraw]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Al Lettieri]], and [[Sally Struthers]]. The plot follows imprisoned mastermind robber Carter \"Doc\" McCoy (McQueen), whose wife Carol (MacGraw) conspires for his release on the condition they rob a bank in [[Texas]]. A double-cross follows the crime and the McCoys are forced to flee for [[Mexico]] with the police and criminals in hot pursuit.\n\n[[Peter Bogdanovich]], whose ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' impressed McQueen and producer [[David Foster (film producer)|David Foster]], was originally hired as the director of ''The Getaway''. Thompson came on board to write the screenplay, but creative differences ensued between him and McQueen and he was subsequently fired along with Bogdanovich. Writing and directing duties eventually went to Hill and Peckinpah, respectively. [[Principal photography]] commenced on February 7, 1972, on location in Texas. The film reunited McQueen and Peckinpah, both of whom had previously worked together on the relatively unprofitable ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' which was released the same year.\n\n''The Getaway'' premiered on December 13, 1972. Despite the negative reviews it received upon release, numerous retrospective critics gave the film good reviews. A box office hit earning over $36 million, it was [[1972 in film|the eighth highest-grossing film of 1972]], and was one of the most financially successful productions of Peckinpah's and McQueen's careers. [[The Getaway (1994 film)|A film remake of the same name]] starring [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Kim Basinger]] was released in 1994.\n\n==Plot==\nFour years into his ten-year sentence for armed robbery, Carter \"Doc\" McCoy is denied parole from a Texas prison. When his wife Carol visits him, he tells her to do whatever is necessary to make a deal with Jack Beynon, a corrupt businessman in [[San Antonio]], to free him. Beynon uses his influence and obtains Doc's parole on the condition that he plan and take part in a bank robbery with two of his henchmen, Rudy Butler and Frank Jackson. The robbery initially goes as planned, until Frank kills a security guard. Rudy then attempts a double-cross, shooting Frank in the groin as they drive away and kicking him out of their moving car, killing him. At their designated meeting place, Rudy tries to draw on Doc, but Doc anticipates Rudy's double-cross and shoots Rudy several times. Doc and Carol take the $500,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.5|1972|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) and leave. Rudy, having secretly worn a [[bulletproof vest]], is only wounded.\n\nDoc meets with Beynon, not realizing he had arranged a double-cross wherein Carol would sneak into the meet and kill Doc; however, Carol turns her gun on Beynon and shoots him dead. Doc, having just been taunted by Beynon before Carol shot him, realizes that Carol had sex with Beynon to secure his parole. He angrily gathers up the money and, after a bitter quarrel, the couple flees for the border at [[El Paso]].\n\nRudy forces rural veterinarian Harold Clinton and his wife Fran to treat his injuries, then kidnaps the pair to pursue Doc and Carol. Beynon's brother Cully and his team also track the McCoys down. At a train station, a [[confidence trick|con man]] swaps locker keys with Carol and steals their bag of money. Doc follows him onto a train and forcibly takes it back, although the con man has already pocketed a packet of the money. The injured con man and a train passenger\u2014a boy whom Doc had rebuked for squirting him with a [[water gun]]\u2014are taken to the police station, where they identify Doc's mug shot.\n\nCarol buys a car, and the McCoys drive to an electronics store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches off the radio set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting the news of the earlier incidents they were involved in. When all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, he leaves immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun from a neighboring store, and shoots up the police car so that they can flee.\n\nThe mutual attraction between Rudy and Fran, the veterinarian's wife, leads to them having consensual sex on two occasions in front of her husband, who is tied up in a chair. Humiliated, the vet hangs himself in the motel bathroom. Rudy and Fran move on, barely acknowledging the suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a [[safe house]] because Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading to the same place. When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is working alone and cannot leave the desk. Doc realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is surprised to see Rudy alive. He sneaks up behind Rudy, knocks him out, and does the same to Fran.\n\nBeynon's brother and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues in the halls, stairwell, and elevator and all but one of Cully's men are killed; Doc allows him to run away. Rudy comes to, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With the police on the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck and force the driver, a cooperative old cowboy, to take them to Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 ({{Inflation|US|30000|1972|r=-4|fmt=eq}}) for his truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple continue into Mexico, having gotten away with their crimes, and the remainder of the money.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Steve McQueen]] as Carter \"Doc\" McCoy\n* [[Ali MacGraw]] as Carol McCoy\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Jack Beynon\n* [[Sally Struthers]] as Fran Clinton\n* [[Al Lettieri]] as Rudy Butler\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as The Cowboy\n* [[Richard Bright (actor)|Richard Bright]] as The Thief\n* [[Jack Dodson]] as Harold Clinton\n* [[Dub Taylor]] as Laughlin\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as Frank Jackson\n* [[Roy Jenson]] as Cully\n* John Bryson as The Accountant, Beynon's Brother<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0117461/?ref_=tt_cl_t12 John Bryson]</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Sam Peckinpah.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A black-and-white still photograph of a smiling Caucasian middle-aged man with a thin moustache and blonde hair. He is wearing a shirt and shades; a piece of wire is tucked beneath his right ear from the inside of his shirt.|Director [[Sam Peckinpah]] on the set of ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969)]]\n\n[[Steve McQueen]] had been encouraging his publicist [[David Foster (film producer)|David Foster]] to enter the film industry for years, as a [[film producer|producer]].{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=219}} His first attempt was ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), with McQueen starring alongside [[Paul Newman]], but [[20th Century Fox]], particularly its president, [[Richard D. Zanuck]], did not want Foster as part of the deal. Rather, Zanuck hired producer [[Paul Monash]] since he was the studio's profit maker, resulting in McQueen's departure from the project, which then fell apart.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=220}} While McQueen was making ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]'' (1971) Foster acquired the rights to [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]]'s crime novel ''[[The Getaway (novel)|The Getaway]]''. Foster sent McQueen a copy of the book urging him to do it. The actor was looking for a \"good/bad guy\" role and saw these qualities in the novel's protagonist, Doc McCoy.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=220}}\n\nFoster looked for a director and [[Peter Bogdanovich]] came to his attention.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=221}} Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'' (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was reached.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=221}} However, [[Warner Bros.]] approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972), starring [[Barbra Streisand]], with the stipulation that he had to start right away. The director wanted to do both, but the studio refused. When McQueen heard this, he became upset and told Bogdanovich that he was going to get someone else to direct ''The Getaway''.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=222}}\n\nMcQueen had recently worked with director [[Sam Peckinpah]] on ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972) and enjoyed the experience,{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=222}} but the film proved to be unsuccessful. He said: \"Out of all my movies, ''Junior Bonner'' did not make one cent. In fact, it lost money.\"{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=219}} McQueen recommended that Foster approach Peckinpah. Like McQueen, Peckinpah was in need of a box office hit and accepted immediately. The filmmaker had read the novel when it was originally published and had talked to Thompson about making a film adaptation when he was starting out as a director.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=222}}\n\nAt the time, Peckinpah wanted to make ''[[Emperor of the North Pole]]'' (1973), a story set during the [[Great Depression]] about a [[brakeman]] obsessed with keeping homeless people off his train.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=154}} The film's producer made a deal with [[Paramount Pictures]]' production chief [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]], allowing Peckinpah to do his personal project if he first directed ''The Getaway''. The director was soon dismissed from ''Emperor'' and told that Paramount was not making ''The Getaway''.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=154}}\n\nA conflict arose with Paramount over the film's budget.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=226}} Foster had thirty days to set up a new deal with another studio, or Paramount would own the exclusive rights. He was inundated with offers and accepted one from [[First Artists|First Artists Productions]], because McQueen would receive no upfront salary, just ten percent of the gross receipts from the first dollar taken in on the film. This would become very profitable if the film was a box office hit.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=226}}\n\n===Writing===\n[[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] was hired by Foster and McQueen to adapt his novel.

Hill said Bogdanovich wanted to turn the material into a more [[Hitchcock]]-type thriller, but he had only written the first twenty-five pages when McQueen fired the director. Hill finished the script in six weeks, then Peckinpah came on board.<ref name=\"mcgilligan\">{{cite news|url=http://filmint.nu.hemsida.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Walter-Hill-Interview2.pdf |last=McGilligan |first=Patrick |title=Walter Hill: Last Man Standing |pages=14 |work=[[Film International]] |publisher=Intellect Ltd. |date=June 2004 |access-date=November 28, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708145144/http://filmint.nu.hemsida.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Walter-Hill-Interview2.pdf |archive-date=July 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nPeckinpah read Hill's draft, and the screenwriter remembered that he made few changes: \"We made it non-period and added a little more action.\"{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=224}} On Thompson's novel, Hill said:\n\n{{Blockquote|text=I didn't think you could do Thompson's novel. I thought you had to make it more of a genre film. Thompson's novel is strange and paranoid, has this fabulous ending in an imaginary city in Mexico, criminals who bought their freedom by living in this kingdom. It's a strange book. It's written in the fifties, takes place in the fifties, but it is really a thirties story. I did not believe that if you faithfully adapted the novel the movie would get made, or that McQueen would get the part. There was a brutal nature to Doc McCoy that was in the book that I thought you weren't going to be able to go that far and get the movie made.

As soon as Peckinpah came on to direct, he wanted to cast [[Stella Stevens]] with whom he had worked on ''[[The Ballad of Cable Hogue]]'' (1970), with [[Angie Dickinson]] and [[Dyan Cannon]] as possible alternatives. Foster suggested [[Ali MacGraw]], a much in-demand actress after the commercial success of ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' (1970).{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=224}} She was married to Robert Evans, who wanted her to avoid being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in [[preppy]] roles, and set up a meeting for her with Foster, McQueen, and Peckinpah about the film.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=225}} According to Foster, she was scared of McQueen and Peckinpah because they had reputations as \"wild, two-fisted, beer guzzlers\".{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=225}} McQueen and MacGraw experienced a strong instant attraction. \"He was recently separated and free,\" she said, \"and I was scared of my overwhelming attraction to him.\"{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=225}} MacGraw was paid $300,000 plus German distribution rights.<ref name=FAP>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 11, 1972|page=3|title=Hoffman Tie With First Artists Prod.

Due to his friendship with Bright, Peckinpah cast him as the con man.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=234}} [[Al Lettieri]] was brought to Peckinpah's attention for the role of Butler by producer [[Albert S. Ruddy]], who was working with the actor on ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972). Like Peckinpah, Lettieri was a heavy drinker which caused problems while filming due to his unpredictable behavior.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=235}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] of ''The Getaway'' began in [[Huntsville, Texas]], on February 7, 1972. Peckinpah shot the opening prison scenes at the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]], with McQueen surrounded by actual convicts.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=227}} Other shooting locations included Texas towns such as [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]],{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=232}} [[San Antonio]] {{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=239}} and [[El Paso]].{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=241}}\n\nMcQueen and MacGraw began an affair during production.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|pp=228}} She would eventually leave her husband Evans and become McQueen's second wife. Foster was worried that their relationship could have a potentially negative impact on the film by causing a scandal.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=230}} MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=240}} According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: \"After we had completed ''The Getaway'' and I looked at what I had done in it, I hated my own performance. I liked the picture, but I despised my own work.\"{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=241}}\n\nPeckinpah's intake of alcohol increased dramatically while making ''The Getaway'', and he was fond of saying, \"I can't direct when I'm sober.\"{{sfn|Weddle|1994|pp=444\u2013450}} He and McQueen got into occasional heated arguments during filming. The director recalled one such incident on the first day of rehearsal in San Marcos: \"Steve and I had been discussing some point on which we disagreed, so he picked up this bottle of champagne and threw it at me. I saw it coming and ducked. And Steve just laughed.\"{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=237}} McQueen had a knack with props, especially the weapons he used in the film. Hill remembered, \"You can see Steve's military training in his films. He was so brisk and confident in the way he handled the guns.\"{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=238}} It was McQueen's idea to have his character shoot and blow up a squad car in the scene where Doc holds two police officers at gunpoint.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=238}}\n\nUnder his contract with First Artists, McQueen had [[final cut privilege]]s on ''The Getaway''. When Peckinpah found out, he was upset. Richard Bright said that McQueen chose takes that \"made him look good\" and Peckinpah felt that the actor had played it safe: \"He chose all these ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' shots of himself. He's playing it safe with these pretty-boy shots.\"{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=241}}\n\n===Music===\nPeckinpah's longtime composer and collaborator [[Jerry Fielding]] was commissioned to [[film score|score]] ''The Getaway''. He had worked previously with the director on ''Noon Wine'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1970), and ''Junior Bonner''. After the film's second preview screening, McQueen was unhappy with the music and used his clout to hire [[Quincy Jones]] to rescore the film.{{sfn|Terrill|1993|p=241}} Jones's music had a jazzier edge and featured [[harmonica]] solos by [[Toots Thielemans]] and vocals by [[Don Elliott]], both of whom had been his associates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Burlingame |first1=Jon |title=Q's cues, and all that jazz |url=https://variety.com/2013/music/news/q-s-cues-and-all-that-jazz-1118066603/ |access-date=June 22, 2017 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  |date=March 1, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922023651/http://variety.com/2013/music/news/q-s-cues-and-all-that-jazz-1118066603/ |archive-date=September 22, 2013 }}</ref> Peckinpah was unhappy with this action and took out a full-page ad in ''[[Daily Variety]]'' on November 17, 1972, which included a letter he had written to Fielding thanking him for his work.
