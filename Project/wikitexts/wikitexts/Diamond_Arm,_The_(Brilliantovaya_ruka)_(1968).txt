The film was directed by director [[Leonid Gaidai]] and starred several famous Soviet actors, including [[Yuri Nikulin]], [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]], [[Anatoli Papanov]], [[Nonna Mordyukova]] and [[Svetlana Svetlichnaya]]. ''The Diamond Arm'' has become a Russian [[cult film]] and is considered by many Russian contemporaries to be one of the finest comedies of all time. It was also one of [[List of highest-grossing films in the Soviet Union|the all-time leaders at the Soviet box office]] with over 76,700,000 theatre admissions in the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]]. The plot of the film was based on a real-life news item about Swiss smugglers who tried to transport jewels in an orthopedic cast.\n\n==Plot==\nThe boss of a [[black market]] ring (known only as \"The Chief\") wants to smuggle a batch of jewelry from a foreign state into the Soviet Union by hiding it inside the [[orthopedic cast]] of a courier. The Chief sends a minor henchman named Gennadiy 'Gesha' Kozodoyev (played by Mironov) to serve as the courier. Kozodoyev travels to [[Turkey]] via a tourist cruise ship. The local co-conspirators do not know what the courier looks like; they only know that he is supposed to say a code word to identify himself. Due to a mix-up, they mistake Kozodoyev's fellow passenger from the cruise ship, the \"ordinary Soviet citizen\" Semyon Gorbunkov (played by Nikulin) for the courier. They place a cast around his arm and put the contraband jewels inside the cast. Upon the cruise ship's return to the Soviet Union, Gorbunkov lets the police know what happened, and the police captain, who is working undercover as a taxi driver, uses Gorbunkov as bait to catch the criminals. Gesha and Lyolik (another of Chief's henchmen, played by Papanov) attempt to lure Gorbunkov into situations where they can quietly, without a [[wetwork]], remove the cast and reclaim the contraband jewels.\n\nOn one such occasion, Gesha invites Gorbunkov to a fancy restaurant with the intention of getting Gorbunkov drunk enough for Lyolik to subdue him. However, both Gesha and Gorbunkov become drunk and Gorbunkov is taken home by the police after he and Gesha cause a scene. Gorbunkov's wife begins to suspect either that he has been recruited by foreign intelligence after finding a large amount of money and a gun loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]] in Gorbunkov's possession (previously given to him by the police), or that he is having an affair. Gorbunkov explains that he is working with the Soviet police on a secret mission, but cannot divulge any details. The Chief sends Anna Sergeyevna, a female operative, to help retrieve the cast. Anna Sergeyevna invites Gorbunkov to her hotel room under the pretense of wanting to sell Gorbunkov a gown and spikes his drink with a sleeping pill. As Gorbunkov is about to pass out, his building's nosy superintendent who had followed Gorbunkov brings his wife into the hotel room before either Lyolik or the police can get to him.\n\nGorbunkov awakens the next morning to find that his wife has assumed that his story was all a cover up for an [[affair]], and has left with the children. The police in the meantime have deduced that Gesha is involved with the smuggling scheme surrounding the cast, and ask Gorbunkov to mention to Gesha that he is planning to travel to another city and will have his cast removed there. Gesha reports this to the Chief, who sends Lyolik disguised as a taxi driver to pick up Gorbunkov. Gorbunkov assumes that Lyolik is also an undercover policeman, and gives away the fact that he has been in contact with the police the entire time. Lyolik plays along and tells Gorbunkov that he has been authorized to remove the cast a day early at a safehouse along the way to Dubrovka. As Lyolik is about to remove the cast, Gorbunkov deduces that Lyolik is actually a criminal and attempts to escape. Lyolik and Gesha chase Gorbunkov and with the help of the Chief himself, they capture Gorbunkov. Upon removing Gorbunkov's cast, they realize that the police had removed the diamonds in the cast a long time ago. The criminals kidnap Gorbunkov and attempt to flee as the police track them down in a helicopter and capture them. Gorbunkov is reunited with his family, with the police having explained the situation to his wife. Gorbunkov goes on vacation with his family, albeit now with a broken leg as a result of the kidnapping.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yuri Nikulin]], Semyon Semyonovich Gorbunkov, an economist at the State Institute for the Planning of Fisheries\n* [[Nina Grebeshkova]], Nadia, Gorbunkov's wife\n* [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]], Gennadiy Kozodoyev, aka Gesha, a model, Chief's assistant\n* [[Anatoli Papanov]], Lyolik, Chief's assistant, an auto mechanic and a tough guy with Belarusian accent\n* [[Nonna Mordyukova]], Varvara Pliushch, upravdom (building superintendent)\n* [[Svetlana Svetlichnaya]], Anna Sergeyevna, a [[femme fatale]]\n* [[Stanislav Chekan]], Mikhail Ivanovich, Captain, then Major of [[militsiya]]\n* [[Vladimir Gulyaev]], Volodya, Lieutenant of [[militsiya]]/Volodya's twin\n* [[Andrei Fajt]], salesman of lottery tickets, visitor of the restaurant \"Weeping willow\"\n* [[Nikolay Trofimov]], Colonel of [[militsiya]]\n* Nikolay Romanov, Chief of crime gang\n* [[Alexander Khvylya]], Boris Savelyevich, maitre d'hotel of the restaurant \"Weeping Willow\"\n* Tatyana Nikulina, tour guide\n* Maksim Nikulin, boy with a net (not credited)\n* [[Leonid Gaidai]], alcoholic's voice and the hand that chokes Kozodoyev in his dream (uncredited)\n* [[Igor Yasulovich]], dog owner\n* [[Roman Filippov]], visitor from [[Kolyma]]\n* Viktoria Ostrovskaya, prostitute\n\n==Production==\nAmerican cars can be spotted in the Oriental city street scenes (which were actually shot in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], USSR): a 1954 [[Chevrolet 210]], a 1955 [[Buick]] and a 1951 [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Super 88]]. This would have been an extremely rare sighting because the United States had sanctions on the USSR and did not sell cars within the [[Eastern Bloc]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n;The Island of Bad Luck\nThe ironic \"The Island of Bad Luck\" (\"\u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\") became popular after the film's release. It was sung in the movie by the Kozodoyev during the cruise as he strums a guitar while relaxing on the ship's deck. The song is thematic, as it presages the bad luck that Kozodoyev experiences throughout the entire film. The song was recorded by Mironov himself. This is not uncommon, as many Russian actors of that time were proficient in singing, as well as dancing.\n\n;The Song About Hares\nThe metaphorical \"Song About Hares\" (\"\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0439\u0446\u0435\u0432\") also became a popular song during the late 1960s. It tells the story of a group of personified [[hare]]s harvesting a mythological ''tryn'' herb (in Russian: ''tryn-trava'') at night and proclaiming that they are not afraid of any predators, be they wolves or owls. The hares boldly sing a refrain which begins with \"We don't care!\" (\"A \u043d\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e!\"), which is actually the meaning of \"tryn-trava\". The song was performed in the movie by the protagonist Semyon Gorbunkov after a heavy dose of [[vodka]] at the [[restaurant]]. Later, the scene was even depicted on a [[Postage stamp|stamp]] dedicated to the actor [[Yuri Nikulin]]. Recorded by Nikulin himself.\n\n;Help Me\nThe third and final popular song from this film was \"Help Me\" (\"\u041f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u043c\u043d\u0435\") was performed by [[Aida Vedishcheva]], a Soviet era singer best known for her performance of songs for films produced in the 1960s. The [[Tango music|tango]]-styled parodic song is about love and passion, and is played in the background during a scene when a femme fatale hired by the Chief's henchmen attempts to seduce and drug Gorbunkov.\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{YouTube|B-iVfLX2tvY|''The Diamond Arm'' (full movie in HD)|link=no}} (official upload by Mosflim)\n* {{amg movie|168580}}\n* {{IMDb title|0062759}}\n* [http://video.kylekeeton.com/2010/03/russian-video-diamond-arm-movie.html The Diamond Arm (with English subtitles)]\n\n{{Leonid Gaidai}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diamond Arm}}\n[[Category:1968 films]]\n[[Category:Slapstick films]]\n[[Category:Mosfilm films]]\n[[Category:1960s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Russian crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Leonid Gaidai]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Aleksandr Zatsepin]]\n[[Category:Films set in Istanbul]]\n[[Category:Films set in Russia]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Baku]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Moscow Oblast]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Sochi]]\n[[Category:Soviet crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Russia]]\n[[Category:1960s heist films]]\n[[Category:1968 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Azerbaijan]]\n[[Category:Films about organized crime in Russia]]\n[[Category:Films set on boats]]"}]}}}}
