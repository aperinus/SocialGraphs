Following his 1946 version of ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'', Lean re-assembled much of the same team for his adaptation of [[Oliver Twist|Dickens' 1838 novel]], including [[film producer|producers]] [[Ronald Neame]] and [[Anthony Havelock-Allan]], [[cinematographer]] [[Guy Green (filmmaker)|Guy Green]], [[production designer|designer]] [[John Bryan (art director)|John Bryan]] and [[film editor|editor]] Jack Harris. Lean's then-wife, [[Kay Walsh]], who had collaborated on the screenplay for ''Great Expectations'', played the role of [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]]. [[John Howard Davies]] was cast as Oliver, while [[Alec Guinness]] portrayed [[Fagin]] and [[Robert Newton]] played Bill Sykes ([[Bill Sikes]] in the novel).\n\nIn 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] placed it at 46th in its [[BFI Top 100 British films|list of the top 100 British films]]. In 2005 it was named in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.\n\n== Plot ==\nA young woman in labour makes her way to a parish [[workhouse]] and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist ([[John Howard Davies]]) by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: [[beadle]] Mr. Bumble ([[Francis L. Sullivan]]) and matron Mrs. Corney ([[Mary Clare]]). When Oliver is nine, the hungry children [[Drawing straws|draw straws]]; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of [[gruel]] (\"Please sir, can I have some more?\").\n\nFor his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry ([[Gibb McLaughlin]]), from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping.\n\nOliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger ([[Anthony Newley]]), a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin ([[Alec Guinness]]), an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow ([[Henry Stephenson]]), a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. A witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin ([[Amy Veness]]).\n\nMeanwhile, Fagin is visited by the mysterious Monks ([[Ralph Truman]]), who has a strong interest in Oliver. He sends Monks to Bumble and Mrs. Corney ([[Mary Clare]]) (now Bumble's domineering wife); Monks buys from them the only thing that can identify Oliver's parentage, a locket containing his mother's portrait.\n\nBy chance, Fagin's associate, the vicious Bill Sykes ([[Robert Newton]]), and Sykes' kind-hearted girlfriend (and former Fagin pupil) Nancy ([[Kay Walsh]]) run into Oliver on the street and forcibly take him back to Fagin. Nancy feels pangs of guilt and, seeing a poster in which Mr. Brownlow offers a reward for Oliver's return, contacts the gentleman and promises to deliver Oliver the next day. The suspicious Fagin, however, has had the Dodger follow her. When Fagin informs Sykes, the latter becomes enraged and murders her, believing that she has betrayed him.\n\nThe killing brings down the wrath of the public on the gang \u2013 particularly Sykes who attempts to make his escape by taking Oliver hostage. Clambering over the rooftops, and with climbing rope hung around his neck, Sykes is shot by one of the mob and is accidentally hanged as he loses his footing. Mr. Brownlow and the authorities rescue Oliver. Fagin and his other associates are rounded up. Monks' part in the proceedings is discovered, and he is arrested. He was trying to ensure his inheritance; Oliver, it turns out, is Mr. Brownlow's grandson. For their involvement in the Monks' scheme, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble lose their jobs at the workhouse. Oliver is happily reunited with his newly found grandfather and Mrs. Bedwin, his search for love ending in fulfillment.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=32em}}\n* [[Robert Newton]] as [[Bill Sikes|Bill Sykes]]\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as [[Fagin]]\n* [[Kay Walsh]] as [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]]\n* [[Francis L.

Even more significantly, the finale to the Lean adaptation has eclipsed Dickens's own finale in the popular memory of the story; the climax atop the roof of Fagin's lair is breathtaking.\"\n\nSongwriter [[Lionel Bart]] acknowledged that Lean's film \"played a role in his conception\" of the musical ''[[Oliver!]]''<ref name=\"Napolitano\" /> Lean biographer Stephen Silverman referred to the 1968 film version of ''[[Oliver!
