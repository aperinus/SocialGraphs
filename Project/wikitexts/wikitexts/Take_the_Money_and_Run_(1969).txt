He begins a life of crime at a young age. As a child, Virgil is a frequent target of bullies, who take his glasses and stamp on them on the floor.  As an adult, Virgil is clumsy and socially awkward, and both police and judges discipline him by stamping on Virgil's glasses.\n\nVirgil falls in love with a young lady, Louise ([[Janet Margolin]]), a laundry worker. They marry and later have a baby.\n\nVirgil attempts to rob a bank, but is arrested when he is embroiled in an argument about the handwriting on a demand note he hands to a cashier.  He is sent to prison, but attempts an escape using a bar of soap carved to resemble a gun.  Unfortunately for him, it is raining outside and his gun dissolves. He ''does'' escape, but by accident.  Joining a mass breakout plan, Virgil is the only inmate not warned that the scheme had been called off.\n\nOutside but unemployed, Virgil finds no way to support himself and his family.  Eventually, he is rearrested and sent to a [[chain gang]], where he is undernourished (the single meal of the day is a bowl of steam) and brutally tortured (consigned to a steam box with an insurance salesman).\n\nVirgil again escapes but is eventually captured when attempting to rob a former friend who reveals he is now a cop. He is sentenced to 800 years, but remains optimistic knowing that \"with good behavior, I can get that cut in half\". In the last scene, he is shown carving a bar of soap and asking the interviewer if it is raining outside.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Virgil Starkwell\n* [[Janet Margolin]] as Louise\n* [[Marcel Hillaire]] as Fritz the Director\n* Jacquelyn Hyde as Miss Blair\n* [[Lonny Chapman]] as Jake the Convict\n* [[Jan Merlin]] as Al the Bank Robber\n* [[James K Anderson|James Anderson]] as Chain Gang Warden\n* [[Howard Storm (director)|Howard Storm]] as Fred\n* [[Mark Gordon (actor)|Mark Gordon]] as Vince\n* Micil Murphy as Frank\n* Minnow Moskowitz as Joe Agneta\n* Nate Jacobson as The Judge\n* Grace Bauer as Farm House Lady\n* Ethel Sokolow as Mother Starkwell\n* [[Dan Frazer]] as Julius Epstein the Psychiatrist\n* Henry Leff as Father Starkwell\n* Mike O'Dowd as Michael Sullivan\n* [[Louise Lasser]] as Kay Lewis<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web |title=Full cast and crew for Take the Money and Run |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065063/fullcredits |access-date=May 11, 2012 |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115222152/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065063/fullcredits |url-status=live }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThis was the second film directed by Woody Allen, and the first with original footage (after ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'', which consisted of visuals taken from a Japanese [[James Bond]] knockoff). He had originally wanted [[Jerry Lewis]] to direct, but when that did not work out, Allen decided to direct it himself. Allen's decision to become his own director was partially spurred on by the chaotic and uncontrolled filming of ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (1967), in which he had appeared two years previously. This film marked the first time Allen would perform the triple duties of writing, directing, and acting in a film. The manic, almost slapstick style is similar to that of Allen's next several films, including ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971) and ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973).\n\nAllen discussed the concept of filming a documentary in an interview with Richard Schickel:\n\n{{blockquote|''Take the Money and Run'' was an early pseudo-documentary. The idea of doing a documentary, which I later finally perfected when I did ''[[Zelig]]'' was with me from the first day I started movies. I thought that was an ideal vehicle for doing comedy, because the documentary format was very serious, so you were immediately operating in an area where any little thing you did upset the seriousness and was thereby funny. And you could tell your story laugh by laugh by laugh... The object of the movie was for every inch of it to be a laugh.<ref>{{cite book |title=Woody Allen: A Life in Film |first=Richard |last=Schickel |publisher=[[Ivan R.

The regular cast and crew were stamped each day with a special ink that glowed under ultra-violet light so the guards could tell who was allowed to leave the prison grounds at the end of the day. (One of the actors in the San Quentin scenes was Micil Murphy, who knew the prison well: he had served five and a half years there, for armed robbery, before being paroled in 1966.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}})\n\nAllen initially filmed a downbeat ending in which he was shot to death, courtesy of special effects from A.D. Flowers. Reputedly the lighter ending is due to the influence of Allen's editor, [[Ralph Rosenblum]], in his first collaboration with Allen.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened on August 18, 1969 at the 68th St. Playhouse in New York City<ref name=AFI/> and grossed a house record $33,478 in its first week and even more in its second week with $35,999.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Holiday Hypo; Crowds Out, Hall 240G; 'Bonnie'-'Bullitt' Mated Reissue, 44G; New York Gives 'Alice's' 67G in 2|date=September 3, 1969|page=9}}</ref>\n\nBy 1973, the film had earned rentals of $2,590,000 in the United States and Canada and $450,000 in other countries.
