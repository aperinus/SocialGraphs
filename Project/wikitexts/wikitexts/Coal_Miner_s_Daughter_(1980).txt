It follows the story of country music singer [[Loretta Lynn]] from her early teen years in a poor family and getting married at 15 to her rise as one of the most influential country musicians. Based on Lynn's 1976 biography of the same name by [[George Vecsey]], the film stars [[Sissy Spacek]] as Lynn. [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Beverly D'Angelo]] and [[Levon Helm]] are featured in supporting roles. [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Roy Acuff]], and [[Minnie Pearl]] make cameo appearances as themselves.\n\nA film on Lynn's life was intended to be made since the release of the biography. Production for the film began in March 1979, and Lynn herself chose Spacek to portray her on screen after seeing a photograph of her, despite being unfamiliar with her films. The film's soundtrack featured all Lynn's hit singles, which were all sung by Spacek, as well as [[Patsy Cline]]'s \"[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]\" sung by D'Angelo. The soundtrack reached the top 40 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' chart and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\n[[Universal Pictures]] released ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' theatrically on March 7, 1980. The critical consensus on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"a solidly affecting story.\"  The film grossed $67.18 million in North America against a budget of $15 million, becoming the [[1980 in film|seventh highest-grossing film of 1980]]. The film received seven nominations at the [[53rd Academy Awards]], including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], with Spacek winning [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. At the [[38th Golden Globe Awards]], it garnered four nominations and won two; [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]]  (for Spacek).\n\nThe film is considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected to be preserved in the United States [[National Film Registry]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Tartaglione|first=Nancy|title=National Film Registry Adds 'Purple Rain', 'Clerks', 'Gaslight' & More; 'Boys Don't Cry' One Of Record 7 Pics From Female Helmers|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/national-film-registry-2019-record-female-directors-boys-dont-cry-purple-rain-clerks-gaslight-platoon-full-list-1202806279/|magazine=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 11, 2019|access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Women Rule 2019 National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-19-116/women-rule-2019-national-film-registry/2019-12-11/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1945, 13-year-old Loretta Webb is one of eight children of Ted Webb, a [[Van Lear, Kentucky|Van Lear]] coal miner raising a family with his wife in the midst of grinding poverty in [[Butcher Hollow, Kentucky]] (pronounced by locals as \"Butcher Holler\").\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 15, Loretta marries 22-year-old Oliver \"Mooney\" (aka Doo, short for Doolittle) Lynn, becoming a mother of four by the time she is 19. The family moves to northern Washington State, where Doo works in the forest industry and Loretta sings occasionally at local honky-tonks on weekends. After some time, Loretta makes an occasional appearance on local radio.\n\nBy the time Loretta turns 25, [[Norm Burley]], the owner of [[Zero Records]], a small Canadian record label, hears Loretta sing during one of her early radio appearances. Burley gives the couple the money needed to travel to Los Angeles to cut a demo tape from which her first single, \"[[I'm a Honky Tonk Girl]],\" is made. After returning home from the sessions, Doo suggests he and Loretta go on a promotional tour to push the record. Doo shoots his own publicity photo for Loretta, and spends many late nights writing letters to show promoters and to radio disc jockeys all over the South. After Loretta receives an emergency phone call from her mother telling her that her father had died, she and Doo hit the road with records, photos, and their children. The two embark on an extensive promotional tour of radio stations across the South.\n\nEn route, and unbeknownst to the couple, Loretta's first single, \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl,\" hits the charts based on radio and jukebox plays, and earns her a spot on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. In the summer of 1961, after 17 straight weekly performances on the Opry, she is invited to sing at [[Ernest Tubb Record Shop]]'s [[Midnite Jamboree]] after her performance that night. Country superstar [[Patsy Cline]], one of Loretta's idols, who had recently been hospitalized from a near-fatal car wreck, inspires Loretta to dedicate Patsy's newest hit \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\" to the singer herself as a musical get-well card. Cline listens to the broadcast that night from her hospital room and sends her husband Charlie Dick to Ernest Tubb Record Shop to fetch Loretta so the two can meet. A close friendship with Cline follows, which abruptly was ended by Cline's death in a [[1963 Camden PA-24 crash|plane crash]] on March 5, 1963.\n\nThe next few years are a whirlwind. The stress of extensive touring, keeping up her image, overwork, and trying to keep her marriage and family together cause Loretta a nervous breakdown, which she suffers onstage at the beginning of a concert. After a year off at her ranch in [[Hurricane Mills, Tennessee]], Loretta goes back on the road, returning to establish herself as the \"First Lady of Country Music.\"\n\nThe film closes with Loretta recounting the story of her life through her 1970 hit song \"[[Coal Miner's Daughter (song)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]\" to a sold-out audience.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as [[Loretta Lynn]]\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as [[Oliver Lynn|Doolittle Lynn]]\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as [[Patsy Cline]]\n* [[Levon Helm]] as Ted Webb\n* [[William Sanderson]] as Lee Dollarhide\n* Phyllis Boyens as Clara Ramey Webb, Loretta's mother\n* Bob Hannah as [[Charlie Dick]]\n* [[Grant Turner (radio host)|Grant Turner]] as [[Grand Ole Opry]] announcer (uncredited)\n* [[Ernest Tubb]] as himself\n* [[Roy Acuff]] as himself\n* [[Minnie Pearl]] as herself\n* [[Bob Elkins]] as Bobby Day\n}}\n\n==Production==\nLynn personally chose Spacek to portray her, making the decision based on a photograph of the actress despite being unfamiliar with her films, a story Spacek recounts in a [[Audio commentary|DVD audio commentary]] for the collector's edition of the film. Initially, Spacek was reluctant to participate, and asked to do her own singing in the film in hopes of scaring the studio from pursuing her for the role. At the time that Lynn prematurely announced on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' that \"Sissy Spacek is going to play me,\" the actress was torn between friends who advised her to do Lynn's film and those who advised her to choose instead a [[Nicolas Roeg]] project due to start filming at the same time. Talking it over with her mother-in-law that evening, Spacek was advised to pray for a sign, which she did. She and her husband subsequently went for a drive in his mother's car, where the radio was tuned to a classical music station that changed formats at sunset every evening. As the couple pulled out of the parking garage, the title line of the song \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" came from the radio.<ref name=\"dvdcomm-apted\">Sissy Spacek and Michael Apted. Feature commentary track, ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' 25th Anniversary/Collector's Edition, 2005.</ref>\n\nIn her 2012 memoir ''My Extraordinary Ordinary Life'', Sissy Spacek states that she became fast friends with Loretta Lynn and worked to emulate her unique accent and speech patterns by spending an afternoon tape-recording the singer while she told stories of her life, some of which made it into the script. She then listened to the tapes and repeated the lines until she captured her own version of Lynn. Though Spacek had started out as a singer, the producers considered dubbing Loretta's vocals over her performance. Lynn encouraged them to allow Spacek to do all of her own singing in the film and helped the actress learn to sing and play guitar in her style. The film's soundtrack featured Spacek's singing all of Lynn's hits sung in the movie, including \"Coal Miner's Daughter.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Spacek|first=Sissy|title=My Extraordinary Ordinary Life|publisher=Hyperion|year=2012|isbn=9781401304270|location=New York|pages=185\u2013187}}</ref>\n\nThe locations included [[Blackey, Kentucky|Blackey]], [[Eolia, Kentucky|Eolia]], [[Flat Gap, Kentucky|Flatgap]], Bottom Fork, [[Redfox, Knott County, Kentucky|Redfox]] in [[Knott County, Kentucky|Knott]] and [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher Counties]] in Kentucky; and [[Pardee, Virginia|Pardee]], a former coal camp on the Virginia side of [[Black Mountain (Kentucky)|Black Mountain]].
