Starring [[Sean Connery]], [[Ursula Andress]], [[Joseph Wiseman]], and [[Jack Lord]], it was adapted by [[Richard Maibaum]], [[Johanna Harwood]], and [[Berkely Mather]] from the 1958 [[Dr. No (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]], a partnership that continued until 1975. It was followed by ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia With Love]]'' in 1963. In the film, [[portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]] is sent to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]] to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of [[Dr. Julius No]], who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] with a radio beam weapon. \n\nAlthough it was the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, ''Dr. No'' was the sixth of Fleming's series, beginning with ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. The film makes a few references to threads from earlier books, and later books in the series as well, such as the criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]], which was not introduced until the 1961 novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''. Produced on a low budget, ''Dr. No'' was a financial success. While the film received a mixed critical reaction upon release, it has gained a reputation over time as one of the series' best instalments.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF INSTALMENTS - this is an article written in British English and retains the correct spelling --> ''Dr. No'' also launched a genre of secret agent films that flourished in the 1960s. The film spawned a [[Dr. No (comics)|comic book adaptation]] and [[Dr. No (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] as part of its promotion and marketing.\n\nMany aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in ''Dr. No''. The film begins with an introduction to the character through the [[Gun barrel sequence|view of a gun barrel]] and a highly stylised main title sequence, both of which were created by [[Maurice Binder]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Spies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gwzj |access-date=3 April 2020 |series=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |series-link=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |network=BBC |station=BBC Four |date=2 April 2020 |series-no=2 |number=3 |time=13:26 |archive-date=9 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200509033929/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gwzj |url-status=live }}</ref> It also introduced [[James Bond Theme|the iconic theme music]].

When news of Strangways' death reaches [[M (James Bond)|M]], the head of MI6, he assigns intelligence officer [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]] to investigate the matter, and determine if it is related to Strangways' cooperation with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] on a case involving the disruption of rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] by [[Radar jamming and deception|radio jamming]]. When Bond arrives in Jamaica, he is accosted by a man claiming to be a chauffeur sent to collect him, but is really an enemy agent sent to kill him. Bond turns the tables on the agent, but before he can interrogate him, the agent kills himself by biting into a [[cyanide]]-laced cigarette. After visiting Strangways' house, Bond confronts a boatman with whom Strangways was acquainted. The boatman, named [[Quarrel (James Bond)|Quarrel]], reveals that he is aiding the CIA and introduces Bond to their agent [[Felix Leiter]], who is also investigating Strangways' death.\n\nBond learns from Felix that the CIA traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica (which was a [[Crown Colony|British colony]] until 1962), and that Strangways was helping to pinpoint its exact origin. Quarrel reveals that before Strangways died, the pair collected mineral samples from an island called Crab Key, where people are forbidden to go. Upon finding a receipt from a local geologist, Professor R. J. Dent, Bond makes inquiries with him about the samples and Crab Key, but is suspicious of his answers when he claims the samples checked out as normal. Following the meeting, Dent travels to Crab Key to meet its reclusive owner, for whom he works, to inform him of Bond's visit. Under strict instructions, Dent attempts to have Bond killed with a [[tarantula]]. However, Bond kills the spider and sets a trap for Dent. When the geologist arrives, Bond holds him at gunpoint, revealing that he believed Dent was asked to check Strangways' samples to see if they were [[radioactive]], before killing him.\n\nAfter checking Quarrel's boat with a [[Geiger counter]], Bond determines that Strangways must have suspected that the radio jamming was coming from Crab Key, and so persuades Quarrel to take him out there. The following day, after arriving, Bond meets [[Honey Ryder]], a shell diver. When armed guards arrive in a boat, Bond and Quarrel take Ryder with them and escape into the swamp. At nightfall, the group encounter a [[flame tank]] disguised as a [[dragon]] to deter locals, which kills Quarrel. Bond and Ryder are captured and taken to a hidden base, whereupon they are swiftly put into decontamination due to the swamp being contaminated with radioactivity. After being led to private quarters set up for them, they are rendered unconscious with drugged coffee.\n\nUpon awakening, the pair are escorted to dine with the base's owner, Dr. Julius No: a Chinese-German criminal scientist who has [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] metal hands due to radiation exposure. Bond learns that No was a former member of a Chinese crime organization [[Tong (organization)|tong]], until he stole $10&nbsp;million in gold, and now works for the secret organisation  [[SPECTRE]] (Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion). The radio jamming being conducted by No is being planned to disrupt the [[Project Mercury]] space launch at Cape Canaveral using a radio beam, which he states will be a demonstration of SPECTRE's power. When Bond refuses to join SPECTRE, No has Ryder taken away and Bond beaten and imprisoned. However, Bond manages to escape his cell through an air vent and disguises himself as a worker, before infiltrating the base's control centre.\n\nBond discovers that the radio beam being prepared to disrupt the launch is powered by a nuclear [[pool reactor]], and overloads it as the launch commences. Dr. No attempts to stop him, but falls into the reactor pool and is boiled to death. As the base's personnel evacuate, Bond frees Ryder before the two escape the island by boat, moments before the base is destroyed. Felix finds the pair adrift at sea after their boat runs out of fuel, and has them towed to safety by a [[Royal Navy]] ship. However, as Ryder passionately kisses him, Bond lets go of the tow rope to embrace her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], a British MI6 agent, codename 007.\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as [[Honey Ryder]], a local shell diver, making a living by selling Jamaican seashells to dealers in Miami.\n** Andress' spoken dialogue was dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]],<ref name=\"Dr. No 1962 - Cast\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/455547/credits.html |title=Dr. No (1962) \u2013 Cast |website=[[Screenonline]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=9 June 2011 |archive-date=4 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804165906/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/455547/credits.html |url-status=live }}</ref> and her singing voice was dubbed by [[Diana Coupland]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6136408.stm |title=Actress Diana Coupland dies at 74 |date=10 November 2006 |work=BBC News |access-date=7 June 2011 |archive-date=16 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816001618/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6136408.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> Both were uncredited.\n* [[Joseph Wiseman]] as [[Julius No|Dr. Julius No]], a reclusive member of [[SPECTRE]]\n* [[Jack Lord]] as [[Felix Leiter]], a [[CIA]] operative sent to liaise with James Bond while he is in Kingston.

It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear-projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr. No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's [[Portrait of the Duke of Wellington]], which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery \u2013 this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday \u2013 and I painted a Goya over the weekend.

Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\" /> [[Johanna Harwood]] and thriller writer [[Berkely Mather]] then worked on Maibaum's script.{{sfn| McGilligan |1986|p=286}} Terence Young described Harwood as a [[script doctor]] who helped put elements more in tune with a British character.<ref name=comm/> Harwood stated in an interview in a ''Cinema Retro'' special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; she said both her screenplays for ''Dr. No'' and her screenplay for ''From Russia with Love'' had followed Fleming's novels closely.<ref>Johanna Harwood interview, ''Movie Classics'' # 4, Solo Publishing, 2012</ref>\n\nDuring the series' decades-long history only a few of the films have remained substantially true to their source material; ''Dr. No'' has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a [[giant squid]], and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a [[centipede]]; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a [[bauxite]] mine instead of a [[guano]] quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt [[NASA]] space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Turks Island]]; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation that was not to be introduced in the books until ''Thunderball''.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} The introduction of Dr. No's disruptions of NASA launches was added because of a perception that the [[United States]] was falling behind the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Space Race]]. Additionally, although the series would be associated with the [[Cold War]], Saltzman and Broccoli introduced SPECTRE as a substitute for the [[Soviet Union]] to avoid commenting on the international political situation.<ref name=\":0\" /> Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent, and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\nSometimes episodes in the novel retained in the film's altered narrative introduce elements of absurdity into the plot. Bond's \"escape\" from his cell via the air shaft, for instance, originally conceived as a ruse of Dr. No's to test Bond's skill and endurance, becomes an authentic break-out in the film.

Sean Connery introduces [[James Bond]] to the film world with his trademark statement, \"Bond, James Bond.\"|alt=Video clip from the film, set in a casino.

There is the \"most important gesture [in]&nbsp;... the way he lights his cigarette before giving her the satisfaction of an answer. 'Bond, James Bond'.\"{{sfn|Comentale|Watt|Willman|2005|p=45}} Once Connery says his line, [[Monty Norman]]'s [[James Bond Theme|Bond theme]] plays \"and creates an indelible link between music and character.\"{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=142}} In the short scene introducing Bond, there are portrayed \"qualities of strength, action, reaction, violence \u2013 and this elegant, slightly brutal gambler with the quizzical sneer we see before us who answers a woman when he's good and ready.\"{{sfn|Comentale|Watt|Willman|2005|p=45}} [[Raymond Benson]], author of the continuation Bond novels, has stated that as the music fades up on the scene, \"we have ourselves a piece of classic cinema\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=170}}\n\nFollowing the release of ''Dr. No'', the quote \"Bond&nbsp;...

It was later reprinted in the United States by [[DC Comics]] as part of its ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |title=Secrets Behind the Comics |last=Evanier |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Evanier |date=3 December 2006 |publisher=NewsFromme.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208081002/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |archive-date=8 February 2012 |access-date=20 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=33%|salign=right|It is because of [Ken Adam] that people believe criminal masterminds operate from the insides of dormant volcanoes and travel between their sumptuously decorated lairs on chrome-plated monorails.
