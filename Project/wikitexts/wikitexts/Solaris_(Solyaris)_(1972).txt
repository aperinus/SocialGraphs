He spends his last day on Earth with his elderly father and retired pilot Burton. Years earlier Burton had been part of an exploratory team at Solaris but was recalled when he described strange happenings, including seeing a four-meter-tall child on the surface of the water on the planet. These were dismissed as [[hallucinations]] by a panel of scientists and military, but now that the remaining crew members are making similarly strange reports, Kris' skills are needed.\n\nUpon his arrival at Solaris Station,<ref name=\"solaris-1961\">{{cite book |last=Lem |first=Stanislaw |author-link=Stanislaw Lem |title=Solaris (ebook \u2013 2011 English translation) |url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1qTr-6G2E7cC&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en_US&pg=GBS.PT6.w.1.7.48 |year=1961 |work=[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]] [[Bill Johnston (translator)]] |publisher=Premier Digital |isbn=9781937624668 |access-date=July 28, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"solaris-1972\">{{cite web |last1=Lem |first1=Stanislaw |last2=Tarkovsky |first2=Andrei |author-link1=Stanislaw Lem |author-link2=Andrei Tarkovsky |title=Solaris \u2013 1972 (film script \u2013 English subtitle times => \"00:31:52,985\" + \"00:44:05,350\" \u2013 [zipped SRT-file]) |url=http://dl.opensubtitles.org/en/download/sub/4583354 |year=1972 |work=Solaris (1972 film) |access-date=July 28, 2013 }}</ref> a [[Space station|scientific research station]], none of the three remaining scientists greet Kelvin, and he finds the space station in strange disarray. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian, has killed himself. The two surviving crewmen\u2014Snaut and Sartorius\u2014are erratic. Kelvin also catches fleeting glimpses of others aboard the station who were not part of the original crew. He also finds that Gibarian left him a rambling, cryptic farewell video message, warning him about the strange things happening at the station.\n\nAfter a fitful sleep, Kelvin is shocked to find Hari, his wife who died ten years earlier, sitting in his sleeping quarters. She is unaware of how she got there. Terrified by her presence, Kelvin launches the replica of his wife into outer space. Snaut explains that the \"visitors\" or \"guests\" began appearing after the scientists conducted radiation experiments, directing [[X-rays]] at the swirling surface of the planet, in a desperate attempt to understand its nature.\n\nThat evening, Hari reappears in Kelvin's quarters. This time he calmly accepts her and they fall asleep together in an embrace. Hari panics when Kelvin briefly leaves her alone in the room, and injures herself attempting to escape. But before Kelvin can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. Sartorius and Snaut explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. Sartorius theorizes that the visitors, also called \"guests\", are composed of \"neutrino systems\" rather than atoms, but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of a device known as \"the annihilator\". Later, Snaut proposes beaming Kelvin's [[Neural oscillation|brainwave]] patterns at Solaris in hopes that it will understand them and stop the disturbing apparitions.\n\nIn time, Hari becomes more human and independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence without panic. She learns from Sartorius that the original Hari had committed suicide ten years earlier. Sartorius, Snaut, Kelvin and Hari gather together for a birthday party, which evolves into a philosophical argument, during which Sartorius reminds Hari that she is not real. Distressed, Hari kills herself again by drinking [[liquid oxygen]], only to painfully resurrect after a few minutes. On the surface of Solaris, the ocean begins to swirl faster into a funnel.\n\nKelvin falls ill and goes to sleep. He dreams of his mother as a young woman, washing away dirt or scabs from his arm. When he awakens, Hari is gone; Snaut reads her farewell note, in which she explains how she petitioned the two scientists to destroy her. Snaut then tells Kelvin that since they have broadcast Kelvin's brainwaves into Solaris, the visitors have stopped appearing and islands have started forming on the planet's surface. Kelvin debates whether to return to Earth or remain on the station.\n\nKelvin appears to be back on Earth at the family home seen at the beginning of the film. He sinks to his knees and embraces his father. The camera slowly cranes away to reveal that they are not back on Earth but actually on an island on the surface of Solaris's ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Donatas Banionis]] as Kris Kelvin (voiced by [[Vladimir Zamansky]])\n**Raimundas Banionis as young Kelvin\n* [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] as Hari\n* [[J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet]] as Dr. Snaut (voiced by [[Vladimir Tatosov]])\n* [[Vladislav Dvorzhetsky]] as Henri Burton\n* [[Nikolai Grinko]] as Kelvin's Father\n* [[Olga Barnet]] as Kelvin's Mother<ref>{{Cite web|title=\u041c\u0425\u0422 \u0438\u043c. \u0410. \u041f. \u0427\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430: \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442|url=https://mxat.ru/actors/barnet/|access-date=2021-01-12|website=mxat.ru}}</ref>\n* [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]] as Dr. Sartorius\n* [[Sos Sargsyan]] as Dr. Gibarian\n* [[Aleksandr Misharin (screenwriter)|Aleksandr Misharin]] as Commissioner Shanahan\n* Bagrat Oganesyan as Professor Tarkhe\n* Tamara Ogorodnikova as Anna, Kelvin's Aunt\n* Tatyana Malykh as Kelvin's Niece\n* Vitalik Kerdimun as Berton's Son\n* [[Yulian Semyonov]] as Conference Chairman\n* Olga Kizilova as Dr. Gibarian's guest\n* Georgiy Teykh as Professor Messenger\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nIn 1968 the director Andrei Tarkovsky had several motives for cinematically adapting [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' (1961). First, he admired Lem's work. Second, he needed work and money, because his previous film, ''[[Andrei Rublev (movie)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966), had gone unreleased, and his screenplay ''A White, White Day'' had been rejected (in 1975 it was realised as ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]''). A film of a novel by Lem, a popular and critically respected writer in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], was a logical commercial and artistic choice.<ref name=wpowell>{{cite book | last = Tarkovsky | first = Andrei | author2=edited by William Powell | title = Collected Screenplays | publisher = Faber & Faber | year = 1999 | location = London}}</ref> Another inspiration was Tarkovsky's desire to bring emotional depth to the [[science-fiction]] genre, which he regarded as shallow due to its attention to technological invention; in a 1970 interview, he singled out [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1968 film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' as \"phoney on many points\" and \"a lifeless schema with only pretensions to truth\".<ref name=\"oc\">{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Colin |title=Andrei Tarkovsky Calls Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' a 'Phony' Film 'With Only Pretensions to Truth' |url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/07/andrei-tarkovsky-calls-kubricks-2001-a-space-odyssey-a-phony-film-with-only-pretensions-to-truth.html |website=[[Open Culture]] |access-date=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nTarkovsky and Lem collaborated and remained in communication about the adaptation. With [[Fridrikh Gorenshtein]], Tarkovsky co-wrote the first screenplay in the summer of 1969; two-thirds of it occurred on Earth. The [[Mosfilm]] committee disliked it, and Lem became furious over the drastic alteration of his novel. The final screenplay yielded the shooting script, which has less action on Earth and deletes Kelvin's marriage to his second wife, Maria, from the story.<ref name=wpowell/> In the novel Lem describes science's inadequacy in allowing humans to communicate with an alien life form, because certain forms, at least, of sentient [[extra-terrestrial life]] may operate well outside of human experience and understanding. In the movie, Tarkovsky concentrates on Kelvin's feelings for his wife, Hari, and the impact of [[outer space]] exploration on the [[human condition]]. Dr. Gibarian's monologue (from the novel's sixth chapter) is the highlight of the final library scene, wherein Snaut says: \"We don't need other worlds. We need mirrors\". Unlike the novel, which begins with Kelvin's [[Interstellar travel|spaceflight]] and takes place entirely on Solaris, the film shows Kelvin's visit to his parents' house in the country before leaving Earth. The contrast establishes the worlds in which he lives \u2013 a vibrant Earth versus an austere, closed-in space station orbiting Solaris \u2013 demonstrating and questioning space exploration's impact on the human psyche.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lem | first = Stanis\u0142aw | title = Solaris | publisher = Harvest Books | date = November 2002 | isbn = 978-0-15-602760-1 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/solaris00lems_0 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|A detail of ''The Hunters in the Snow'' (1565) by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], a thematic reference]]\n\nThe set design of ''Solaris'' features paintings by the [[Old Masters]].

Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the [[All-Union State Institute of Cinematography|State Institute of Cinematography]]. It was she who had introduced the novel ''Solaris'' to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970, but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director [[Larisa Shepitko]], who cast her in ''You and I''. Half a year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Bondarchuk as Hari after all.<ref>{{cite video | people = Bondarchuk, Natalya | title = Natalya Bondarchuk Interview | medium = DVD | publisher = Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\nTarkovsky cast Lithuanian actor [[Donatas Banionis]] as Kelvin, the Estonian actor [[J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet]] as Snaut, the Russian actor [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]] as Sartorius, the Ukrainian actor [[Nikolai Grinko]] as Kelvin's father, and [[Olga Barnet]] as Kelvin's mother.
