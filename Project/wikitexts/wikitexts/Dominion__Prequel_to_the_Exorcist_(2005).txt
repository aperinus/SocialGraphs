The film serves as an alternative [[prequel]] to ''[[The Exorcist]]'' (1973) and is the fifth installment in [[The Exorcist (film series)|''The Exorcist'' series]]. The film stars [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Clara Bellar]], [[Gabriel Mann]] and [[Billy Crawford]].\n\nThe official prequel to ''The Exorcist'' before being retooled to turn into ''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'', as [[Morgan Creek Productions]] executives feared the already completed film would be unsuccessful, it received a limited release in the United States on May 20, 2005, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], after ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' became a financial and critical disappointment. The film was not well-received by critics, although it received better reviews than ''Exorcist: The Beginning''.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1944, a Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] lieutenant named Kessel forces the parish priest of a small village in [[Netherlands in World War II|occupied Holland]], Father [[Lankester Merrin]], to participate in arbitrary executions in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, in exchange for sparing the village.\n\nIn 1947, Merrin, whose faith was shattered by the incident, is an archaeologist in Derati, a remote area in the [[Turkana region]] of [[British Kenya]] excavating a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] church built around the 5th century\u2014long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. He meets up with Father Francis, and Major Granville, the British military officer overseeing the dig. Making their way to Derati with Chuma, Merrin's translator and guide, Merrin introduces Francis to Rachel, a doctor and Emekwi, an enthusiastic convert who provides accommodation for the two men. As they tour the dig site, Merrin and Francis notice the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been deliberately buried immediately after its construction was completed.\n\nOn the site, Merrin meets a disabled young outcast named Cheche. Although dissuaded by Chuma, Merrin brings the boy to Rachel for medical treatment. Once the door is uncovered, Merrin, Francis, and Chuma go inside the church. A hidden passageway leads them to a crypt containing a demonic idol\u2014an ancient sanctuary where human sacrifice was performed. Merrin deduces that the church was expressly built to seal this underground temple. On their way back, they are confronted by local elders, who demand Merrin stop digging.\n\nFrancis contacts Granville to send a detachment to guard the dig against potential robbers, despite Merrin's objections. Two British soldiers attempting to loot some precious stones from the church are then found dead the next day (one without his head; the other crucified to the altar head downward). Despite the Christian symbolism used in the murders and the testimony of local warrior Jomo that the two men were affected by a strange madness, Granville, blaming the Turkana, goes to town in an uncharacteristic fit of rage demanding the purported culprits be given up, shooting a young woman in cold blood when the locals protest. Determined to stop the 'Christian evil' from spreading, Jomo breaks into the mission school and slaughters the students, including one of Emekwi's sons before he is shot on the spot by British soldiers.\n\nFrancis has a disturbing realization that Cheche's unusual recovery is not a divinely wrought miracle as he had first thought and considers [[Baptism|baptizing]] him to save his soul; the boy accepts on the condition that it be held at the church. Meanwhile, a shaken and guilt-ridden Granville commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth. The Turkana elders demand that the church be reburied and Francis\u2014who they hold responsible for the spread of the 'Christian evil' and the arrival of the British troops\u2014and Cheche be handed over to them to be killed but are turned down. Francis, assisted by Rachel, baptizes Cheche at the church, but the demon inside the boy attacks them. Realizing an exorcism is in order, Francis leaves quickly to fetch his copy of the [[Roman Ritual]]. An earthquake erupts and seals the entrance to the church.\n\nThe next morning, Merrin and the British find Francis tied to a tree naked, shot with arrows. The dying Francis reveals to Merrin that Cheche is possessed and begs him to perform an exorcism. Another earthquake shifts the rocks, unblocking the church entrance just enough to allow Merrin to go inside. At the underground temple, Merrin finds Rachel\u2014who runs away under a trance\u2014and the possessed Cheche. After donning Francis' vestments, Merrin returns to the church to begin the exorcism. The demon offers Merrin a chance to rewrite his past, at which Merrin (in a hallucination) finds himself back in 1944 Holland: when he refuses to cooperate, Kessel instead has Merrin ''and'' all the villagers killed for his defiance.\n\nWhen Merrin comes back to his senses, the demon mocks the futility of his attempt to change what happened. An [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] appears in the sky as the evil spirit's influence causes the entranced Rachel to attempt to kill herself, Emekwi to violently beat his wife, and the Turkana to charge into battle against the British. The exorcism eventually succeeds and the demon leaves Cheche's body, causing him to regress to his former condition.\n\nWith the demon exorcised, life in Derati returns to normal and the British detachment leaves. One of the local elders, however, warns that the demon will pursue Merrin. Merrin bids farewell to Rachel and Cheche before leaving for [[Rome]], having now regained his faith.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Father Lankester Merrin]], a half-Dutch, half-English parish priest and scholar from Holland undergoing a crisis of faith ever since he was forced to participate in an arbitrary execution of his parishioners by the Nazis during World War II. He has subsequently devoted his time to archaeology after the war. Skarsg\u00e5rd reprises the same role in ''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]''.\n* [[Gabriel Mann]] as Father Francis, an idealistic missionary to the area appointed to ensure the sanctity of the excavated church is respected. He looks up to Merrin (having studied his works at the seminary) and tries to make him regain his faith in God.\n* [[Clara Bellar]] as Rachel Lesno, a doctor in the town hospital who had undergone a harrowing experience in a Nazi concentration camp.\n* [[Billy Crawford]] as Cheche, a physically-handicapped boy shunned and abused by the locals before Merrin gets him medical attention. He starts to recover from his disabilities once the demon possesses him, ultimately achieving physical perfection before the demon is exorcised.\n* [[Julian Wadham]] as Major Granville, a British army officer overseeing the Derati dig. A kindly man well-liked by his own troops, he begins to exhibit an uncharacteristic loss of temper after the mysterious deaths of two of his men in the church.\n* [[Ralph Brown]] as Sergeant Major Harris, Granville's second-in-command. Unlike Granville, he is less kindly disposed towards the Turkana.\n* [[Israel Aduramo]] as Jomo, a local warrior who constantly observes the archaeological site. \n* Andrew French as Chuma, a local serving as an interpreter and guide for Merrin and the British.\n* Eddie Osei as Emekwi, a hotel owner and Christian convert who provides Merrin and Francis accommodations during their stay in Derati. He offers his two sons, James and Joseph, to Francis as students for his planned missionary school. Their death at the hands of Jomo leads him to question his faith.\n* [[Antonie Kamerling]] as Lieutenant Kessel, the SS officer who forces Merrin to decimate the villagers under his wing in retaliation for the murder of one of his men.\n* [[Mary Beth Hurt]] (uncredited) as the [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|voice of possessed Cheche]].\n\n==Production==\nProducer James G.

Specifically, Schrader was not given enough money to conduct ADR, to bring cinematographer Vittorio Storaro back to perform the film's color timing (forcing him and Silano to approximate it themselves), nor to commission an original score for the entire film. Instead, the score was developed piecemeal, with fourteen minutes (including a central theme) being composed without payment by Angelo Badalamenti. The final twenty minutes of the film were scored by the American metal band [[Dog Fashion Disco]] (the unusual choice stemming from Schrader's son's affection for the group), while the balance of the score - about an hour's worth - was recycled from Trevor Rabin\u2019s work for the Harlin version. In addition to contributing compositions, Dog Fashion Disco also \"finessed\" the score as a whole to give it a unity despite its disparate sources.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://captainhowdy.com/2005/03/exclusive-interview-with-paul-schrader/\n|title=Exclusive interview with Paul Schrader|first=Erik|last=Myers|date=14 October 2005|publisher=Captain Howdy|access-date=2005-03-24}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2005, after a private screening in New York, the film was titled ''Paul Schrader's Exorcist: The Original Prequel''.

Club]] wrote that \"Skarsg\u00e5rd [gives] a quietly mesmerizing performance\", and that \"Schrader's movie isn't particularly scary, but it's more substantive than ''The Exorcist'' and its sequels, because it takes demon possession out of head-spinning literalism and considers evil as something more real and commonplace\".<ref>[https://www.avclub.com/content/node/18808/ Review] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521033925/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/18808/ |date=May 21, 2008}}, Scott Tobias, The A.V.

You keep waiting for someone or something to show up and seize control of the picture, but it never really happens until the final confrontation, which feels like it might as well come from a different movie. It's not blood or gore that's missing, its context; ''Dominion'' is too polite and urbane to frighten\".<ref>[http://dvd.ign.com/articles/662/662157p1.html Review], Brent Simon, IGN, October 27, 2005</ref>\n\nDirector Erik Kristopher Myers, who was the first to ever review the film in 2005, wrote: \"The curious thing about the ''[[Exorcist]]'' franchise is that you have three films following the same narrative thread, but none of the chapters feel as though they belong to a greater whole. Each one plays too differently from the previous installment, destroying any sense of genuine continuity beyond names or locations. [[Schrader]]\u2019s film is the first to synthesize the elements of each one, whether intentionally or otherwise, and presents us with an ''[[The Exorcist|Exorcist]]'' that owes as much to [[William Friedkin|Friedkin]] as it does to [[John Boorman|Boorman]] and [[William Peter Blatty|Blatty]]. At the same time, it also manages to achieve its own identity while still being directly linked to ''The Exorcist'', ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'' and ''[[The Exorcist III]]''. No other film in the series has a genuine marriage to each of its partners the way that Schrader\u2019s does\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=pages/The-Exorcist/35650298912|date=2005-05-20|title=Dominion: The First Review|url=http://captainhowdy.com/2005/05/dominion-the-first-review/|access-date=2021-05-24|website=CaptainHowdy.com|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on DVD October 25, 2005 by [[Warner Home Video]] and included [[deleted scenes]], photo gallery, and an [[audio commentary]] by director Paul Schrader.\n\nOn October 10, 2006, the film was released with ''[[The Exorcist]]'', ''The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen'', ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'', ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' and ''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'' in a box set titled ''The Exorcist: The Complete Anthology''.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray as part of the Blu-ray version of ''The Exorcist: The Complete Anthology'' on September 23, 2014.
