It stars [[Mark Patton]], [[Kim Myers]], [[Robert Englund]] as [[Freddy Krueger]], and [[Robert Rusler]]. It is the second installment in the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]]. The film follows [[Jesse Walsh]], a teenager who begins having recurring nightmares about Freddy Krueger after moving into the former home of [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] from the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|first film]].\n\n''Freddy's Revenge'' was released on November 1, 1985, and grossed $30 million at the domestic box office on a budget of $3 million. It received mixed reviews from critics upon release, with many comparing it unfavorably to its predecessor. However, it has enjoyed later success as a [[cult film|cult classic]], with critics having reassessed the film's [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] themes and subject material. It was distributed by [[New Line Cinema]]. The film was followed by ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nFive years after [[Freddy Krueger]]'s [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|apparent defeat]], the Walshes have moved into Nancy Thompson's former home. Their teenage son, Jesse, has a nightmare about being stalked by Krueger driving a school bus. He wakes up and attributes the dream to the unusual heat in the room. Jesse goes to school with his friend Lisa, whom he is interested in romantically, but is too shy to flirt with her. After getting into a fight with a boy named Grady during gym class, Coach Schneider has them stay after class and they become friends. Lisa comes to visit Jesse after school and they discover Nancy Thompson's diary detailing her nightmares, which are strikingly similar to Jesse's. Small fires happen around the house, which culminates in the spontaneous combustion of their pet birds. Jesse's father accuses him of sabotage.\n\nThe following night, Jesse has a nightmare where he encounters Freddy, who tells him to kill for him. The dreams grow more intense and Jesse unsuccessfully attempts different measures to keep himself awake. He eventually begins wandering the streets at night. One night, he is caught by Schneider ordering a drink in a [[gay bar]] and is made to run laps at school as punishment. After sending Jesse to the showers, Schneider is attacked by an unseen force that drags him to the showers. Jesse vanishes into the steam and Freddy emerges, killing Schneider by slashing his back. Afterwards, Jesse is horrified to see the glove on his hand. He is escorted home by police after being found wandering the streets naked, and his parents begin to suspect that Jesse may be on drugs or mentally disturbed. Lisa takes Jesse to an abandoned factory where Freddy Krueger worked, but they find nothing there.\n\nThe following night, Jesse goes to Lisa's pool party and kisses her in the cabana, but his body begins to change and he leaves in a panic. He goes to Grady's house, confesses to killing Schneider, and instructs Grady to watch him as he sleeps and to stop him if he tries to leave. When Grady eventually falls asleep, Freddy emerges from Jesse's body and kills Grady. Freddy then changes back to Jesse, who finds himself looking at Freddy's laughing reflection in Grady's mirror. He flees before Grady's parents enter the room. Returning to Lisa's house, Jesse tells her what is going on. Lisa realizes that Jesse's terror is giving Freddy his strength, but he cannot stop fearing him and transforms again. Freddy locks Lisa's parents in their bedroom and attacks her, but realizes he cannot harm her due to Jesse's influence. Freddy goes outside where he begins to slaughter the partygoers. Lisa's father emerges with a shotgun, but Lisa stops him from shooting Freddy, who escapes in a ball of flame.\n\nLisa drives to the factory, facing sudden nightmares and having to control her fear before confronting Freddy. She pleads with Jesse to fight Freddy, but Freddy's hold is too strong. When Lisa confesses her love for Jesse and kisses Freddy, Jesse begins to fight back. Freddy combusts and turns to ash, from which Jesse emerges.\n\nLater, as Jesse, Lisa, and Lisa's friend Kerry are taking the bus to school. Jesse begins to notice similarities to his original nightmare and panics. After Lisa calms Jesse down, Kerry says that it is all over just before Freddy's clawed arm bursts through her chest. Freddy laughs as the bus drives into the field, just as in Jesse's first nightmare.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of cast members of the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series|List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters}}\n* [[Mark Patton]] as [[Jesse Walsh]]\n* [[Kim Myers]] as Lisa Webber\n* [[Robert Rusler]] as Ron Grady\n* [[Clu Gulager]] as Ken Walsh\n* [[Hope Lange]] as Cheryl Walsh\n* [[Marshall Bell]] as Coach Schneider\n* [[Melinda O.

I came up with a plot that had a new family move into the house, a teenage boy, his pregnant mother and a stepfather the boy didn't get along with. It was a real bloody, scary idea, much more physical and realistic because the dream reality stuff was less central to these movies then. My story was more of a possession scenario with Freddy getting inside the mother's womb, controlling the fetus.

In a 2020 interview he explained that he had \"no interest in making horror films\" and that his initial feeling was to turn Robert Shaye down. After realizing that ''A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge'' could put him on the map as a director, he said yes.<ref name=\"Haanen\" />\n\nThe intro scene with Jesse's nightmare of Freddy driving the bus was carried over from the previous film; Craven was vehemently against Freddy appearing in person as the driver of the car in the epilogue scene, as he felt the storyline for Nancy, Tina, Rod and Glen should be self-contained in the first film. The compromise between him and Shaye was therefore to use the idea of Freddy driving the vehicle for the sequel, but not for any characters from Craven's film.<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Fangoria]] | issue=57 | date=September 1986 | title=Wes Craven's Deadly Doubleheader | pages=50\u201353, 64 | author=[[Lee Goldberg]] & David McDonnell}}</ref> The character of Lisa Webber was named Lisa Poletti in the script.<ref name=\"neversleepagain\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Never-Sleep-Again-Street-Blu-ray/dp/B00G6TPQ1C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394065427&sr=8-1&keywords=never+sleep+again |title=Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy [Blu-ray&#93;: Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp, Wes Craven, Lisa Wilcox, Alice Cooper, Andrew Kasch, Daniel Farrands, Thommy Hutson |website=Amazon.com |access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> On Wes Craven's suggestions, Chaskin put more emphasis on Lisa in the film than he originally intended; he explains that Craven \"suggested that we shift the focus from Jesse the male lead.

Freddy emerges from Jesse's stomach in the same forced-birth technique that made the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' films]] legendary.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Welcome to Our Nightmares: Behind the Scene with Today's Horror Actors|last=Norman|first=Jason|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=978-0-78647-986-3}}</ref>\n\nMark Patton has claimed the film's gay subtext was increasingly emphasised through script rewrites as production progressed. \"It just became undeniable\" he told ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' in 2016. \"I'm lying in bed and I'm a [[piet\u00e0]] and the candles are dripping and they're bending like phalluses and white wax is dripping all over. It's like I'm the center of a [...] ''[[bukkake]]'' video.\" He has felt betrayed since he knew the filmmakers were aware he was gay, but [[closeted]]. They had considerable leverage over him in having him perform a role that, combined with his performance as a gay teen in ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'' the year before, led to him being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as gay. The role called attention to what he was trying to avoid discussing and would have forestalled him getting any significant roles in 1980s Hollywood.<ref name=\"Buzzfeed article\" />\n\nIn particular, Patton blames Chaskin, who he says claimed the subtext arose from how Patton played the part. \"I love when [he] uses the word 'subtext,'\" he complained. \"Did you actually go to a freshman English course in high school? This is not subtext.\" In 2016 he said Chaskin \"sabotage[d]\" him. \"Nobody ever affected my confidence\u2014the boys that threw rocks at me, nobody\u2014but this man did.\" Chaskin denied for years that there was a gay subtext in his screenplay. Instead, at one point, he told a reporter that Patton had simply played the part \"too gay\". The emotional stress of the film led Patton to leave acting shortly afterwards for a career in [[interior decorating]].<ref name=\"Buzzfeed article\" />\n\nWhile Chaskin has tried to reach out and apologize to Patton over the years, with limited success, he maintains that Patton's \"interpretations of Jesse were choices that he made ... I have to believe that he 'got it' and that was how he decided to play it.\" In 2010, Chaskin finally admitted it was a deliberate choice on his part. \"[[Homophobia]] was skyrocketing and I began to think about our core audience\u2014adolescent boys\u2014and how all of this stuff might be trickling down into their psyches,\" he explained. \"My thought was that tapping into that angst would give an extra edge to the horror.\"<ref name=\"Buzzfeed article\" />\n\nOne scene that would have made the gay subtext more apparent was toned down. Englund was actually prepared to insert one of his hand's knife blades into Jessie's mouth instead of merely caressing his lips with it as he does in the finished film, but Patton did not feel comfortable with it. The film's makeup artist suggested to Patton that he not do the scene that way to protect his image.<ref name=\"Buzzfeed article\" />\n\nIn a February 2010 interview with [[Attitude (magazine)|''Attitude'' magazine]], Englund said \"... the second ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' is obviously intended as a [[bisexuality|bisexual]] themed film. It was early '80s, pre-[[AIDS]] paranoia. Jesse's wrestling with whether to [[coming out|come out]] or not and his own sexual desires was manifested by Freddy. His friend is the object of his affection. That's all there in that film. We did it subtly but the casting of Mark Patton was intentional too, because Mark was out and had done ''Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.attitude.co.uk/news/viewnews.aspx?newsid=1144|title=Hollywood Monster|author=Todd|first=Matthew|date=February 2, 2010|work=[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904162007/http://www.attitude.co.uk/news/viewnews.aspx?newsid=1144|archive-date=September 4, 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=April 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn an article written by Brent Hartinger for ''[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton.com]]'', he notes that a \"frequent debate in gay pop culture circles is this: Just how 'gay' was 1985's ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge'' (the first ''Elm Street'' sequel)? The imagery in the movie makes it seem unmistakably gay \u2014 but the filmmakers have all along denied that that was their intention.\" During his interview segment for the 2010 documentary film ''[[Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy]]'', David Chaskin admitted that the gay themes were intentional, something he had denied until that point.\n\nIn a 2020 interview director [[Jack Sholder]] said he never had any discussions with Chaskin or anybody at New Line about a gay subtext in the script during production. He did add that in his view the movie was about \"repressed sexual angst that every teenager experiences\" and that \"that angst can express itself in the question: Am I gay?\". He also pointed out that Mark Patton did not pick up on any gay subtext when he read the script, but that it was pointed out to him by one of the crew members. Sholder concluded by saying: \"Looking back on it, there were a whole bunch of decisions, starting with casting Mark that really\u2026 If you look at some of the exegeses as to why it\u2019s the gayest horror film of all time, some of it is people reading stuff into things, some of it was intentional and some of it was stuff that people added that fed into that idea.\"<ref name=\"Haanen\">{{Cite interview |date=2020 |interviewer=Roel Haanen |title=Jack Sholder interview |url=https://www.flashbackfiles.com/jack-sholder-interview |website=THE FLASHBACK FILES |access-date=2021-03-10 }}</ref>\n\nOthers in the cast and crew have said that they were unaware of any such themes at the time they made the film, but that a series of creative decisions on the part of director Jack Sholder unintentionally brought Chaskin's themes to the forefront. In an interview Sholder said, \"I simply didn't have the self-awareness to realize that any of this might be interpreted as gay\". [[Openly gay|Now-out]] Mark Patton said, \"I don't think that [the character] Jesse was originally written as a gay character.
