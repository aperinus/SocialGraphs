Jip is suffering from [[Sexual dysfunction|sexual anxiety]] brought on by a series of unsuccessful liaisons.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/16/human_traffic_1999_review.shtml|title=BBC (UK TV Station) Film Reviews: March 2001|access-date=9 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"IMDBQuotes\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188674/quotes|title=IMDB Film Database \u2013 Human Traffic Memorable Quotes|website=[[IMDb]] |access-date=11 January 2010}}</ref> Koop, Jip's best friend, is jealous of his girlfriend Nina's happy and care-free nature. Nina is being [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] in a job she had no choice but to take after having failed a college interview. Lulu, Jip's best female friend and \"dropping partner\", has suffered infidelity in her last 3 relationships. Moff, the newest member of the group having met Jip at a warehouse party after moving from [[London]] to Cardiff, is an unemployed [[slacker]] who works as a small-time dealer, despite his father being a senior policeman. The five friends become very close, take drugs such as [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and [[cocaine]], and \"live for the weekend\".\n\nThe film follows the antics of the five friends as well as various characters they meet along the way. They go to pubs and clubs on Friday, taking along Nina's 17-year-old brother Lee whose waning enthusiasm for his first drugs experience is played out in a debate between Jip and a doctor. Jip gives up his ticket to Lulu, whom he has talked into coming out and is forced to talk his way into the club as the group are a ticket short. The club scene is then examined through a series of cameos including two attempts by older journalists to understand the club scene. The ensemble then joins a [[house party]], where Lulu and Jip finally kiss and attempt unsuccessfully to make love; whereas the established couple, Koop and Nina, fight over Koop's perceptions about her behaviour. Later, as expected by the group, \"what goes up must come down\" sets in as the effects of their drug use begin to hit home leaving them coping with feelings of [[anxiety]] and [[paranoia]]. They recover Lee from a group of younger partygoers he has spent the night with and make their way home.\n\nOn returning home, some of the group's issues are mended whilst some are thrown into sharper relief. Jip makes love to Lulu, overcoming his sexual problems. Koop and Nina's argument is resolved. Lee has made it through the weekend without any of his concerns being realised.  Moff, however, is still caught up in the paranoia caused by his extensive drug use. He argues with his parents again and is seen walking alone around Cardiff feeling [[Depression (mood)|depressed]]. However, Moff joins his friends for an end of the weekend drink and having raged about his obsession with drugs is soon joking about his addiction with his friends. The film finishes with Jip and Lulu kissing in the street.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Simm]] as Jip\n* [[Lorraine Pilkington]] as Lulu\n* [[Shaun Parkes]] as Koop\n* [[Danny Dyer]] as Moff\n* [[Nicola Reynolds]] as Nina\n* [[Andrew Lincoln]] as Felix\n* Dean Davies as Lee\n* [[Richard Coyle]] as Andy\n\n==Cameo appearances==\n*When Jip first picks up Koop in his car, the DJ heard on the radio is [[Pete Tong]], the film's musical adviser,<ref name=\"BBC\"/> who has a weekly Friday night radio show on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref name=\"Pete Tong\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v|title=BBC Official Website \u2013 Pete Tong|access-date=9 January 2010}}</ref>\n*\"Pablo Hassan\", manager of the Asylum club, is played by prominent DJ [[Carl Cox]].<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref name=\"CarlCox\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carlcox.com/|title=Carl Cox Official Website|access-date=9 January 2010}}</ref>\n*Director Kerrigan appears in several scenes as \"Ziggy Marlon\",<ref name=\"IMDB1\"/> the [[Jungle music|Junglist dancer]] in Koop's record shop who asks, \"Any jungle in, guy?\", as an early aficionado of 'TomToms', the precursor to the Asylum club, (the main club venue for the film), and in a later scene driving with Nina's brother on their way to the house party, as well as several other brief appearances throughout the film.

Kerrigan based much of the film on his own exploits,<ref name=\"GuardianReview\"/> and eventually took over in a director capacity. In an edition of UK [[gay]] lifestyle magazine ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'', actor [[Danny Dyer]] spoke about the film being partly inspired by the 1995 [[BBC]] [[television drama]] ''[[Loved Up]]'' (which also featured an early appearance from [[Lena Headey]]), and which had similar themes to the film.\n\n===Locations===\nMuch of the film was shot in [[Cardiff]], where the film also takes place. Nina's workplace, a fictionalised [[McDonald's]], was filmed at UCI 12 Cinemas (Now an Odeon Cinema), Atlantic Wharf Leisure Village, Hemingway Road. The public house during the Friday night scene was shot at the Firedrake & Firkin Pub, 39\u201341 Salisbury Road, Cathays, Cardiff. The Emporium nightclub on Cardiff High Street was used as the exterior of the fictional \"Asylum\" club, and the former club X, Charles Street stood in as the interior. The Philharmonic public house on St Mary's Street is where the Sunday pub scene was filmed, and Jip and Lulu's Sunday night walk home was also filmed in St Mary's Street.<ref name=\"CardiffLocations\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188674/locations|title=Human Traffic (1999)|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Alienation===\nInter-generation alienation is a significant theme of the film including being directly referenced in a pub scene in which the main, minor and bit players sing a revised version of the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem of the United Kingdom]] 38 minutes into the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Many of the characters have family troubles which cause conflict with family members. Jip's mother is a prostitute; Koop's father lives in a fantasy world under residential psychiatric care since his wife left him. Moff still lives at home and is shown as being in continual tension with his father and embarrassed when he is caught masturbating by his mother. The family relationships of the female leads are explored in less detail, although one scene portrays Lulu giving only limited details of her weekend to an uncle and aunt who are dressed as clergy. At least one contemporary review suggests that these relationships are not adequately explored in the film.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n===Work and unemployment===\nThe film is also indifferent to the work ethic. Jip works at a clothing retail outlet and is comedically represented as a '[[wage slavery|wage slave]]'; particularly in a scene where he is shown being anally raped by his boss, who has a barcode on his forehead and forcibly covers Jip's mouth with a \u00a320 note. Nina has similar misgivings about her job at a fast-food restaurant where all the employees are shown bodypopping robotically and she quits her work following sexual harassment. Moff argues with his father about preferring to be unemployed whilst Lulu is shown not enjoying her college experience.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Drugs and the counter culture===\nAll the characters identify strongly with the 1990s counter-culture: all are drug users to a greater or lesser extent; Jip idolises [[Bill Hicks]]; Koop dreams of being a DJ; Moff's bedroom is festooned with anti-establishment posters. Lulu gives an extended speech about her individuality whilst Nina revels in becoming unemployed.\n\nJip concludes his narration by saying \"We're all fucked up in our own way, y'know, but we're all doing it together. We're freestylin' on the buckle wheel of life, trapped in a world of internal dialogue. Like Bill Hicks said: 'It's an insane world, but I'm proud to be part of it.'\"\n\nAlthough there is significant dialogue about drug use contained in the film (specifically [[MDMA]] (ecstasy), [[marijuana]], and one sarcastic discussion about [[heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]]), the only drug use by main characters is a scene where Jip and Koop are having an intimate conversation at a house party and they are seen cutting up a line of white powder. They are never actually shown snorting it, but nonchalantly rub it into their gums during a discussion. Later at the same party Nina and Lulu are seen sharing a spliff on a balcony and Ernie, one of the protagonist's in Howard Marks' monologue 'Spliff Politics' is also seen smoking a large spliff.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film generated mixed reviews, garnering 59% positive reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/human_traffic|title=Human Traffic (2000)|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> Film critic Colm Keaveny proclaimed this film to be Danny Dyer's \"finest hour\", and [[Irish people|Irish]] critic James Murphy called Dyer's performance \"truly remarkable\". The film garnered 11 international awards and was nominated for a BAFTA.<ref name=\"Guardian2\"/> [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two and a half stars, describing it as \"a writer's film if there ever was one\".<ref>{{cite book | last=Maltin | first=Leonard | year=2009 | page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780451227645/page/511 511] | title=Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide | url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780451227645 | url-access=registration | isbn=978-1-101-10660-0 | publisher=Signet Books }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Human Traffic (soundtrack)}}\nAn important part of this film is the soundtrack; which includes some of the most famous contemporary dance music producers of the time. These include [[Armand Van Helden]], [[CJ Bolland]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Jacknife Lee]], [[Pete Heller]], [[Ferry Corsten]], [[Carl Cox]], [[Dillinja]], [[Felix Da Housecat]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[Aphrodite (artist)|Aphrodite]], [[Death in Vegas]], [[Primal Scream]], [[Liquid Child]], [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], [[The Age of Love (Age of Love song)|Age of Love]], [[Energy 52]], [[Brainbug]] and [[Lucid (band)|Lucid]]. The incidental music and scratching from the scene 'Puffin' the Herb' was by [[Mad Doctor X]]\n\n==American version==\nThe version of the film released in the United States was heavily edited to remove certain British cultural references and terminology that it was presumably felt American audiences would be unable to identify with or understand. These are mostly in the form of re-dubbed dialogue, such as Jip saying that he and Lulu \"recently became dropping partners\" being changed to \"clubbing partners\"; Nina's speech to the journalists in which she says she is looking forward to getting into some \"hardcore [[This Morning (TV series)|Richard and Judy]]\" becoming \"hardcore ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]''\"; and Jip's allusion to ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' with \"he who dares, Rodders,\" being rendered as \"he [[Who Dares Wins]]\".\n\nOther material was simply cut, including Lulu dumping her boyfriend; most of Koop's conversation with his father in the [[psychiatric hospital]]; and the 1991 \"Summer of Love\" flashback sequence. As a result of various cuts, the US version runs to 84m 14s, compared to the original 99m 21s, losing just over 15 minutes of footage, in addition to the numerous re-dubs. Certain scenes also feature different music from the original UK version.\n\n==''Human Traffic Remixed''==\nOn 21 October 2002, distributors [[2 Entertain|VCI]] announced the DVD release of ''Human Traffic Remixed'', promising a \"modernised\" soundtrack with new contemporary (2002) tracks, previously cut scenes, and \"state-of-the-art [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects.\" On 18 October ''The Guardian'' revealed that rather than being a \"[[director's cut]]\", it was the work of producer [[Allan Niblo]], Kerrigan's tutor and \"mentor\" at film school. Niblo removed from the titles all shots of the 1994 anti-[[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act]] demonstration and subsequent riot, thus eliminating the implicit political element of the original. He also cut the more anti-royalist second verse of the spoof national anthem, and all references to Moff, played by Dyer, being a casual drug dealer. Dyer went on to star in other Niblo produced films, notably ''[[The Football Factory (film)|The Football Factory]]''. He added previously deleted scenes about Jip's internal struggles over his mother's prostitution, and another where the female leads play aliens, creating a film slightly less concerned with the politics and active promulgation of the Class-A Ecstasy & MDMA drug culture endemic in the 1990s, and more about coming of age struggles informed by a passive participation in it.\n\nKerrigan only learnt about the project two weeks before the release was due.<ref name=\"Kamera\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kamera.co.uk/reviews_extra/human_traffic.php|title=Kamera Review \u2013 Human Traffic|access-date=11 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504064656/http://www.kamera.co.uk/reviews_extra/human_traffic.php|archive-date=4 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> He explained: \"I joke about it. How I signed over the copyright (to Niblo) for a pound and then never even saw the pound. When I finished I was \u00a325,000 in debt. I've never made a penny from the film. Legally I don't have a leg to stand on, but I signed the contract because I was very naive and very broke. Now I'm just broke.\" No longer able to afford living in London, where he had moved after the film's release, Kerrigan was preparing to return to his native Cardiff. Although shot on a budget of \u00a3340,000 and UK box office taking of \u00a32.5 million, Niblo maintained that the film had not made a profit, stating: \"the investment is still unrecouped.\" John Simm was highly critical of the new release, describing it as \"cynical exploitation\" and complained of Niblo's attempts to get him to appear in a [[sequel]] when he had only been paid a nominal fee for the first film. Simm said that he only appeared in ''Human Traffic'' because of Kerrigan's involvement.<ref name=\"Guardian2\"/> While the original 99m 21s cinema version runs to 95m 21s on video<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/human-traffic-2|title=HUMAN TRAFFIC &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=www.bbfc.co.uk}}</ref> due to [[576i#PAL speed-up|PAL speed-up]], the ''Remixed'' version runs to 95m 30s<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/human-traffic-remixed-2002-0|title=HUMAN TRAFFIC REMIXED &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=www.bbfc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Loved Up|Loved Up (1995 film)]]'', a BBC TV drama exploring clubbing and drug culture\n*''[[Go (1999 film)|Go]]'', a US film about rave culture released the same year\n*''[[Groove (film)|Groove]]'', a US film about rave culture released a year later\n*''[[Sorted (film)|Sorted]]'', a UK film about trance culture released a year later\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.miramax.com/movie/human-traffic}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0188674}}\n* {{Amg movie|180287|Human Traffic}}\n\n{{Media in Cardiff}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2021}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:British comedy films]]\n[[Category:Cool Cymru]]\n[[Category:Films about drugs]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cardiff]]\n[[Category:Films set in Wales]]\n[[Category:Irish comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language Irish films]]\n[[Category:Vertigo Films films]]\n[[Category:Stoner films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Matthew Herbert]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
