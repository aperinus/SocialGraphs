The film was both a major critical and commercial success, grossing $245.7 million against a budget of $135 million. At the [[84th Academy Awards]], the film won [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], making it the first non-[[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] or [[Pixar]] film to win since 2006's ''[[Happy Feet]]'', and the last one to win until 2018's ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Reuters]]|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/27/us-oscars-rango-idUSTRE81Q09K20120227 |title='Rango' wins Oscar for best animated feature film|date=February 27, 2012|first= Lisa|last=Richwine|access-date=February 7, 2018| archive-date=December 11, 2017| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171211054844/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oscars-rango/rango-wins-oscar-for-best-animated-feature-film-idUSTRE81Q09K20120227|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA pet [[chameleon]] becomes stranded in the [[Mojave Desert]] after his [[Vivarium|terrarium]] accidentally falls from his owners' car. He is told by a [[nine-banded armadillo]] named Roadkill, who is seeking the mystical \"Spirit of the West\", of an [[American frontier|Old West]] desert town called \"Dirt\" where water comes in through a mysterious rite on Wednesdays. Seeing no other options, the chameleon heads out into the desert, where he narrowly avoids being eaten by a vicious [[red-tailed hawk]] before meeting Beans, a [[desert iguana]], who takes him to Dirt.\n\nAsked about his identity, the chameleon presents himself to the townsfolk as a tough drifter named Rango and quickly runs afoul of [[Gila monster]] outlaw Bad Bill, who challenges him to a shootout. The hawk interrupts the duel and chases Rango, who accidentally knocks over an empty water tower, crushing the hawk to death. In return, the town's elderly [[desert tortoise]] mayor appoints Rango as the town's new sheriff. Meanwhile, the townsfolk worry that with the hawk dead, the infamous [[gunfighter|gunslinger]] Rattlesnake Jake (who fears predators such as said hawk) will return.\n\nBeans explains to Rango that Dirt is in the midst of a drought and its only water supply, stored in a water cooler bottle at the town bank, is nearly empty. She demands Rango investigate where the water is gone and in doing so he inadvertently helps a gang of bank robbers, led by a [[Mole (animal)|mole]] named Balthazar, to steal the water supply. Rango organizes a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] that finds the banker, Johannes Merrimack III, dead in the middle of the desert from drowning. The posse tracks the robbers to their hideout, where they fight Balthazar's bat-riding clan over the stolen water bottle before discovering it to be empty. The robbers profess that they found it empty, but the posse still takes them into custody.\n\nAfter being questioned by Rango about his buying of the land around Dirt, the mayor summons Rattlesnake Jake, who runs Rango out of town after forcing him to admit his lies to the townsfolk. Dejected, Rango returns to the highway where he passes out while trying to cross to the other side. He tells his story to the Spirit of the West, an elderly [[Man with No Name]], who advises he go back to Dirt and set things right, telling him that \"No man can walk out on his own story\". With the aid of Roadkill and mystical moving [[Yucca schidigera|yuccas]], Rango discovers an emergency shut-off valve in a water pipeline to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]], which the mayor has been manipulating to cause the water shortage so he could buy the land for himself.\n\nRango returns to Dirt and challenges Jake to a duel, a diversion to allow the yuccas restore the town's water and allow Rango to make his resolve clear to Jake. However, the mayor forces Rango to surrender by threatening Beans' life before attempting to drown the duo inside the bank's vault. He then prepares to shoot Jake with Rango's gun, but finds Rango has taken its only bullet, which he uses to shatter the vault's glass door, freeing himself and Beans. Impressed, Jake salutes Rango for proving his heroism before dragging the mayor out of town. The citizens of Dirt celebrate the return of their water supply and Rango is recognized as their hero.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Rango, an eccentric but intelligent and heroic [[chameleon]].<ref name=firstlook /> His actual name is unknown, but he calls himself Rango throughout the film.
