(film)|Are We There Yet?]]'' The screenplay is by Hank Nelken. It was produced by [[Revolution Studios]] and [[RKO Pictures]] and distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia]], Canada, but is set in [[Newberg, Oregon]], United States.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo years after the events of the [[Are We There Yet? (film)|first film]], Nick Persons has married Suzanne and moved her children, Kevin and Lindsey into his apartment, as well as purchasing a 2007 [[Cadillac Escalade]] after he accidentally burnt up his [[Lincoln Navigator]] SUV. He has also sold his sports memorabilia store to his friend, Marty.\n\nThe family has also bought a [[Berger Picard]] pet dog and named it Coco. Kevin and Lindsey have both matured since the previous events. While getting ready for an interview with [[Magic Johnson]] to launch a sports magazine, Suzanne tells Nick that she is pregnant and they later find out that they will be having twins. Needing more space, Suzanne and Nick go check out a house in the suburbs.\n\nThey meet Chuck Mitchell Jr., a local real estate agent/contractor, and after some talking, Nick decides to buy the house. The family then packs up their things and moves into the house, with Lindsey and Kevin (mostly the former) being against the move. However, as it turns out, Nick failed to get the house inspected first, and they soon find a mold infestation. While trying to resolve the mold issue, Chuck discovers even more problems with the house, and Nick becomes angry with him as he almost destroys it trying to fix them all.\n\nMeanwhile, Lindsey sneaks out to go to a party with Chuck\u2019s teenage employees, and when Nick finds out, he grounds her. Nick finally decides to fire Chuck, which causes all those working on the house to quit out of loyalty to Chuck, and Suzanne to take the kids and move into the guest house. After taking some time to think, Nick decides to fix the house on his own and also to apologize to Chuck, especially when he was told that his wife, a famous country singer, died a few years ago. Chuck responds by bringing his friends back to help.\n\nWhen Suzanne goes into labor, with the hospital half-an-hour away, Nick, Kevin, and Lindsey have to deliver the babies. Chuck tries to get there, but his truck breaks down and he is forced to power walk down to the house. While she's still in labor, Nick gets a call from Magic Johnson. After Suzanne gives birth to identical twin boys, the movie ends six months later with a big BBQ in their backyard, at which Nick debuts his new magazine titled ''Are We Done Yet?'', based on his experience building the house.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Nick Persons\n* [[Nia Long]] as Suzanne Persons\n* [[John C.
