The title is taken from a pre-[[Comics Code Authority]] 1950s [[EC Comics]] magazine [[Weird Science (comics)|of the same name]], the rights to which were acquired by the film's producer [[Joel Silver]]. The [[Weird Science (song)|title song]] was written and performed by American [[New wave music|New Wave]] band [[Oingo Boingo]].\n\n==Plot==\nNerdy social outcast students Gary Wallace and Wyatt Donnelly of Shermer High School (the same fictional high school used in ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'') are humiliated by senior jocks Ian and Max for swooning over their cheerleader girlfriends Deb and Hilly. Rejected and disappointed at their direction in life and wanting more, Gary convinces the uptight Wyatt that they need a boost of popularity in order to get their crushes away from Ian and Max. Alone for the weekend with Wyatt's parents gone, Gary is inspired by the 1931 classic ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' to create a virtual woman using Wyatt's computer, infusing her with everything they can conceive to make the perfect dream woman.\n\nAfter hooking electrodes to a doll and hacking into a government computer system for more power, a power surge creates Lisa, a beautiful and intelligent woman with unlimited magical powers. Promptly, she conjures up a pink [[Cadillac_Eldorado#1959|1959 Cadillac Eldorado]] [[convertible]] to take the boys to a [[dive bar]] in [[Chicago]], using her powers to manipulate people into believing Gary and Wyatt are of age.\n\nThey return home drunk and happen upon Chet, Wyatt's mean older brother, who extorts money from him to buy his silence. Lisa agrees to keep herself hidden from him, but she realizes that Gary and Wyatt, while extremely sweet, are very uptight and need to unwind. After another humiliating experience at the mall when Max and Ian pour an [[The Icee Company|Icee]] on Gary and Wyatt in front of a crowd, Lisa tells the bullies about a party at Wyatt's house, of which Wyatt had no prior knowledge, before driving off in a [[Porsche 928]] she conjured for Gary.\n\nDespite Wyatt's protests, Lisa insists that the party happen anyway in order to loosen the boys up. She goes to meet Gary's parents, Al and Lucy, who, to Gary's embarrassment, are shocked and dismayed at the things she says and her frank manner. After she pulls a gun on them (later revealed to Gary to be a [[Water gun|water pistol]]), she alters their memories so that Lucy forgets about the conflict; however, Al forgets that they had a son altogether.\n\nAt the Donnelly house, the party has spun out of control while Gary and Wyatt take refuge in the bathroom, where they resolve to have a good time, despite having embarrassed themselves in front of Deb and Hilly. In Wyatt's bedroom, Ian and Max convince Gary and Wyatt to recreate the events that created Lisa, but it fails. Lisa chides them over their misuse of the magic to impress their tormentors. She also explains that they forgot to connect the doll; thus, with the bare but live electrodes resting on a magazine page showing a [[Pershing II]] [[medium-range ballistic missile]], a real missile appears, crashing through the house.\n\nMeanwhile, Wyatt's grandparents arrive and confront Lisa about the party, but she freezes them and hides them in a cupboard. Lisa realizes that the boys need a challenge to boost their confidence and has a gang of [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]] [[Outlaw motorcycle club|bikers]] invade the party, causing chaos and sending the boys running.\n\nWhen the bikers take Deb and Hilly hostage, Wyatt and Gary decide to confront the bikers, causing Deb and Hilly to fall in love with them. The bikers leave, and the next morning, Chet discovers the house in disarray, including a localized snowstorm in his room, and the missile. Lisa tells the boys to escort the girls home while she talks to Chet alone. Gary and Wyatt proclaim their feelings, and both girls reciprocate their feelings to the boys.\n\nReturning to the house, the boys discover Chet, now transformed into a talking mutant blob. He apologizes to Wyatt for his behavior. Upstairs, Lisa assures them that Chet will soon return to normal, and, realizing that her purpose is complete, hugs both Gary and Wyatt before de-materializing. As she leaves, the house is magically cleaned and everything transformed back to normal, including Chet. Wyatt's parents return home, completely unaware that anything odd has happened.\n\nLater at Gary and Wyatt's high school, Lisa turns up as the new gym teacher, thus continuing her mission to look out for the two boys.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Gary Wallace\n* [[Ilan Mitchell-Smith]] as Wyatt Donnelly\n* [[Kelly LeBrock]] as Lisa\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Chet Donnelly\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Ian\n* [[Robert Rusler]] as Max\n* [[Suzanne Snyder]] as Deb\n* [[Judie Aronson]] as Hilly\n* [[Vernon Wells (actor)|Vernon Wells]] as Lord General\n* Jennifer Balgobin as Biker Girl\n* Jeff Jensen as Metal Face\n* [[Britt Leach]] and Barbara Lang as Al and Lucy Wallace, Gary's parents\n* [[Ivor Barry]] and Ann Coyle as Henry and Carmen Donnelly, Wyatt and Chet's grandparents\n* Doug MacHugh and [[Pamela Gordon (actress)|Pamela Gordon]] as Mr. and Mrs. Donnelly, Wyatt and Chet's parents\n* [[Michael Berryman]] as Mutant Biker\n* [[John Kapelos]] as Dino\n* [[D'Mitch Davis]] as The Bartender\n* [[Chino 'Fats' Williams]] as Bar Patron\n* [[Steve James (actor)|Steve James]] as Guy at Table (uncredited) \n* [[Jill Whitlow]] as Susan, the perfume salesgirl\n* [[Wallace Langham]] (as Wally Ward) as Art\n* [[Renee Props]] as Member of The Weenies\n* Kym Malin as Girl playing piano\n\n==Production==\nModel [[Kelly Emberg]] was initially cast as Lisa, but she left after two days due to \"creative differences\".
