Starring [[Queen Latifah]], [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Sophie Okonedo]], and [[Paul Bettany]], the film was directed by [[Gina Prince-Bythewood]] and produced by [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] and [[Will Smith]], with [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as the [[executive producer]].\n\n''The Secret Life of Bees'' is noted for [[Queen Latifah]]'s critically acclaimed performance as August Boatwright. The film was released in the United States on October 17, 2008, and in the United Kingdom on December 5, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1964 [[South Carolina]], Lily lives on a peach orchard with her abusive, widowed father T. Ray. 10 years earlier, the four-year-old Lily accidentally shot her mother as she was attempting to leave T. Ray. In the present day, her 14th birthday is approaching, and she celebrates the signing of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] with her father\u2019s Black hired help, Rosaleen. On the night before her birthday, Lily sneaks away into a nearby cornfield where she has secretly buried a few mementos of her mother, including a jar labeled \u201cBlack Madonna Honey, Tiburon, SC.\u201d She places the picture of her mother on her stomach to feel closer to her as she lays back in the cornfield. She suddenly hears T. Ray calling for her and quickly buries her mothers belongings and tries to quickly button her shirt. She is caught hastily buttoning her shirt by T. Ray who assumes she was out there with a boy and punishes her by having her kneel on a pile of grits for an hour.\n\nOn her birthday, Rosaleen takes Lily into town under the pretense of Lily getting measured for a bra, but also to give Rosaleen the opportunity to register to vote. The pair encounter a group of racists who beat Rosaleen after she stands her ground against their intimidation, and she is arrested. T. Ray retrieves Lily and takes her back home, but she runs away and breaks Rosaleen out of the hospital, where she\u2019s being treated for her wounds while she awaits jail. They head for Tiburon, with Lily hoping to figure out more about her mother\u2019s past.\n\nIt takes two days for Lily and Rosaleen to reach Tiburon and find their way to the home of August Boatwright and her sisters May and June. August has used her skills as a [[beekeeper]] to build a successful business. Despite the unlikeliness of Lily's lies about hers and Rosaleen\u2019s circumstances, and June\u2019s suspicions, August takes them in, agreeing to trade room and board for their labor. Lily becomes an apprentice beekeeper and later discovers May's \u201c[[Western Wall|wailing wall]]\u201d, tucked full of little notes about events that have distressed the brittle and sensitive May, as well as May\u2019s twin sister April, who died in childhood. She also learns about August\u2019s leadership of a small group of women who pray to the life-size statue of a [[Black Madonna]] in the Boatwright\u2019s living room for guidance.\n\nIn time Lily grows close to Zach, the teenage son of one member in the prayer group and August's assistant beekeeper/godson. Lily and Zach try to watch a movie together, but when they disregard racial barriers, sitting together in the \"colored\" section, gets Zach kidnapped by a group of townspeople. June and August hide the news from May to try and protect her, but Zach's mother reveals the news to her accidentally. Out of grief, May drowns herself to escape the pain of feeling the world's hatred, though in her suicide note she predicts Zach will be returned alive, and he is found the next day.\n\nWith May's funeral comes some reconciliation and truth. June agrees to wed her long-time boyfriend who she had previously repeatedly rejected. Rosaleen is asked to be part of the household family, and August says they will call her July. Lily, who already believes she killed her mother, now blames herself for Zach's kidnapping and May's death. She has a breakdown, convinced her mother didn\u2019t want her, feeling unloved and unlovable, and resigns herself to leave before she causes any more harm. Before she\u2019s able to go, August challenges her outlook, and tells Lily about her mother, whom August cared for as a child in [[Virginia]] and later sheltered from the abuse of T. Ray.\n\nMeanwhile, T. Ray has figured out where Lily is by using a map she had pinned on her bedroom wall. He comes to Tiburon to take Lily home with him. However, Lily refuses to leave, and August, June, and Rosaleen form a phalanx of support. Lily confronts T. Ray about her mother, and he reveals he lied to her; her mother really did come back for her. With angry reluctance, T. Ray leaves her to be raised by the Boatwrights.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as August Boatwright\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as Lily Owens\n* [[Jennifer Hudson]] as Rosaleen \"July\" Daise-Boatwright \n* [[Alicia Keys]] as June Boatwright\n* [[Sophie Okonedo]] as May Boatwright\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as T.
