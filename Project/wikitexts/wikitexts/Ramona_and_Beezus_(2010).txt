[https://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSTRE51515A20090206 \"Young actresses cast for 'Beezus and Ramona.'\"] [[Reuters]], 2009-02-05.</ref> It was directed by [[Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum|Elizabeth Allen]], co-produced by [[Dune Entertainment]], [[Denise Di Novi|Di Novi Pictures]], and [[Walden Media]], written by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay, and produced by [[Denise Di Novi]] and [[Alison Greenspan]] with music by [[Mark Mothersbaugh]]. The film stars [[Joey King]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]], [[Bridget Moynahan]], [[Ginnifer Goodwin]], [[Josh Duhamel]], and [[Sandra Oh]]. Though the film's title is derived from ''[[Beezus and Ramona]]'', the first of Cleary's Ramona books, the plot is mostly based on the sequels ''[[Ramona Forever]]'' and ''[[Ramona's World]]''.\n\n''Ramona and Beezus'' was released by [[Fox 2000 Pictures]] on July 23, 2010, and grossed $27 million.<ref name=\"bom\" /> The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the acting of King and Gomez.\n==Plot==\nThe adventurous and creative third-grader Ramona Quimby often finds herself in trouble at school and at home, usually with her best friend, Howie. When her father Robert loses his job and the family falls into severe debt, Ramona's efforts to earn money end up backfiring in humorous ways. She repeatedly embarrasses her older sister, Beatrice, calling her by her family nickname, \"Beezus\", in front of Beatrice's crush, the paperboy Henry.\n\nAlthough an executive in a company since Beezus's birth, Robert quarrels with Dorothy (his wife and the girls' mother) when he considers pursuing a creative career.\n\nMeanwhile, Ramona's visiting aunt Bea is one of the few who accepts her despite all her eccentricities. After a car-painting accident involving Bea's old flame Hobart, Ramona gives up her money-making schemes. The next day, she ruins her school portrait by cracking a raw egg in her hair and making a face when the photographer asks her to say \"Peas\" instead of \"Cheese\". Ramona's worries increase the following day, when her classmate Susan reveals that after her own father lost his job, her parents divorced and her father moved to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]. The news makes Ramona physically sick, and Robert has to pick her up early from school, interfering with a sudden job interview. Instead of being angry, Robert decides to spend the rest of his day drawing a mural with Ramona.\n\nWhile Ramona and Beezus attempt to make dinner for their parents, the pan catches fire while Beezus is on the phone with Henry. During the ensuing argument, Henry overhears that Beezus loves him. Still upset, Ramona goes to feed her cat Picky-Picky but is devastated to find him dead. The girls' private funeral for their friend helps them reconcile. A job offer for Robert in [[Oregon]] leads Ramona's parents to decide to sell their house. As the family touches up the garden during an open house, Ramona inadvertently initiates a water fight with the neighbors, which floods the neighbors' backyard and exposes a box that Hobart buried there years ago. The box contains mementos of Bea and Hobart's teenage romance, and in light of their rekindling relationship, he proposes to her. Hesitantly, Bea accepts, and the family begins planning the impromptu wedding.\n\nFurious her aunt broke her promise not to get \"reeled in\", Ramona rushes home, seeking solace in the attic. The fragile floorboards break, leaving her legs dangling from the ceiling during the open house. After they clear out, Robert scolds her for her lack of maturity. Feeling unwanted, Ramona decides to run away. Unable to convince her not to leave, her mother helps her pack. Opening the heavy suitcase at a bus stop, Ramona discovers that her mother intentionally made it heavy to keep Ramona from getting far. Inside, Dorothy packed a book of Robert's sketches of Ramona. Her family finds her soon afterward and everyone is happily reunited.\n\nAt Bea and Hobart's wedding, Ramona saves the day when she finds the wedding ring Howie dropped. During the reception, Beezus and Henry share a kiss and dance together, risking it as they were moving. Robert gets another job offer, this one at Ramona's school, as Mrs. Meachum recommended him as the new art teacher after she saw the mural that he and Ramona made. Ramona is delighted they will not have to move and that her parents reconcile. Before Bea and Hobart leave for their honeymoon in [[Alaska]], Ramona gives Bea a locket with her school picture, and Bea says Ramona is \"extraordinary\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Joey King]] as [[Ramona Geraldine Quimby]]\n* [[Selena Gomez]] as [[Beezus Quimby|Beatrice Ann \"Beezus\" Quimby]]\n* [[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]] as Robert Quimby\n* [[Bridget Moynahan]] as Dorothy Quimby\n* [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Aunt Beatrice \"Bea\"\n* [[Josh Duhamel]] as Hobart\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Mrs. Meacham\n* [[Hutch Dano]] as [[Henry Huggins]]\n* [[Sierra McCormick]] as [[Susan Kushner]]\n* [[Jason Spevack]] as [[Howie Kemp]]\n* Aila and Zanti McCubbing as Roberta Day Quimby\n* [[Janet Wright]] as Howie's Grandmother\n* Patti Allan as Mrs. Pitt\n* [[Lynda Boyd]] as Triplet mother\n* Andrew McNee as Mr. Clay\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File: Elizabeth Allen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum|Elizabeth Allen]] is the film\u2019s director.]]\nIn 2009, it was announced that [[Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum|Elizabeth Allen]] would direct a film adaptation of the [[Ramona (book series)|Ramona series of novels]] written by [[Beverly Cleary]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Siegel |first1=Tatiana |title=Gomez stars in \u2018Beezus and Ramona\u2019 |url=https://variety.com/2009/film/news/gomez-stars-in-beezus-and-ramona-1117999655/ |website=Variety |date=6 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=11 May 2019 |last1=Beresford |first1=Trilby |title=\u2018Ramona and Beezus\u2019 Director Talks Hidden Difficulties for Mothers, Myth of \"Cutthroat\" Women in Entertainment |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ramona-beezus-director-talks-hidden-difficulties-mothers-film-1209681/ |website=The Hollywood Reporter |quote=which just so happened to be one of my favorite childhood books [Beezus and Ramona by Beverly Cleary] so naturally, that was a perfect fit.}}</ref> The film, ''Ramona and Beezus'', would be released in cinemas on July 23, 2010.
