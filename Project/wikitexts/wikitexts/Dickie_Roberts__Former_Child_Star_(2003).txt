In addition, the movie shows Dickie interacting with numerous former child stars, played by over two dozen actual former stars lampooning their careers, such as [[Leif Garrett]], [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]], [[Corey Feldman]], [[Emmanuel Lewis]], [[Dustin Diamond]], and [[Danny Bonaduce]].\n\n==Plot ==\nDickie Roberts is a very young actor who shot to fame on a 1970s television [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] called ''The Glimmer Gang'' with his [[spoonerism]] catchphrase \"This is Nucking Futs!\". His career subsequently halted in the years following the show's cancellation.\n\nUnable to find another acting gig due to his eccentric habits, a now older Dickie has been reduced to parking cars at a [[Morton's Restaurant Group|Morton's restaurant]] and appearing on ''[[Celebrity Boxing]]'', where he suffers a humiliating first-round defeat to [[Emmanuel Lewis]]. In the public eye and to his girlfriend Cyndi, who leaves him on the roadside after a car problem, Dickie is a washed-up loser.\n\nAfter talking to his old friend [[Leif Garrett]], Dickie is absolutely convinced a new [[Rob Reiner]] movie in the works titled ''Mr. Blake's Backyard'' will be his comeback. Even after his agent Sidney Wermack fails to land him an audition, Dickie persists. While on duty at Morton's, he [[joyride (crime)|joyrides]] in a customer's vehicle and drops into an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting where he pesters [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] to connect him with Reiner. After he is kicked out as he's not an alcoholic, Dickie fakes being drunk and mistakingly wanders into a [[Lamaze]] class [[Brendan Fraser]] is taking with his wife. Fraser finds Dickie's entrance to the class hilarious and ridiculous, and agrees to help him out by calling Reiner on his behalf.\n\nReiner bluntly tells Dickie that the part is not within his abilities because it requires knowing how a regular person lives. Unfortunately, he didn't have a normal childhood (he grew up in the limelight, and his emotionally abusive mother Peggy abandoned him once he stopped earning money). Desperate to prove to Reiner he is right for the part, Dickie manages to sell his raunchy [[autobiography]] for $30,000. With the money, he pays a family to \"adopt\" him for a month to properly prepare the role.\n\nOnce Dickie hires his \"family\", things get off to a rocky start, as George, the bread-winning father, insists that they need the money, despite the reservations of the other family members. Grace, the mother, comes to pity their new \"son\" and gradually provides him with surrogate guidance. Dickie begins to realize a lesson he read in the script for ''Mr. Blake's Backyard'': \"Sometimes all of the things you need are in your own backyard\".\n\nDickie learns much about himself and life in general, and begins to act less immaturely and more as a third parent. He helps the son Sam secure a date and helps the daughter Sally join the [[pep squad]]. Cyndi returns to him and he even earns the admiration of George, who turns out to be inept at fidelity.\n\nSidney lands an audition for Dickie by donating one of his kidneys to Reiner after the director is savagely beaten by a psychotic driver whom Dickie provoked while unknowingly driving Reiner's vehicle. Dickie gets the part, proving that \"In Hollywood, sometimes your dreams can come true...again\". After learning that George ran off with Cyndi, Dickie gives up the part to take George's place with the family he has come to love as his own. An ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'' story on Dickie, aired not long after, reveals that Dickie has since started his own sitcom starring all of his old friends, as well as his new family (including Grace, whom he has married).\n\nThe closing credits are a send-up on Relief albums listed as \"To help former child stars\" and includes many references to old television sitcoms where Dickie, Leif, their mutual friends, [[Florence Henderson]], [[Marion Ross]], and other former very young stars sing \"Child Stars on Your Television\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Spade]] as Dickie Roberts, a former child star looking to make a comeback.\n** Nicholas Schwerin portrays a younger Dickie.\n* [[Mary McCormack]] as Grace Finney, a woman who reluctantly allows Dickie to live with her family during his audition.\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Sidney Wermack, Dickie's agent.\n* [[Craig Bierko]] as George Finney, Grace's husband who agrees to let Dickie stay with them without consulting her. \n* [[Alyssa Milano]] as Cyndi, Dickie's former girlfriend.\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as himself, he is working on a film ''Mr. Blake's Backyard'' that Dickie wants to get a part in.\n* [[Scott Terra]] as Sam Finney, the son of Grace and George.\n* [[Jenna Boyd]] as Sally Finney, the daughter of Grace and George and the sister of Sam.\n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Peggy Roberts, the mother of Dickie\n* [[Michael Buffer]] as himself, he was the ring announcer on ''[[Celebrity Boxing]]''.\n* [[John Farley (actor)|John Farley]] as a referee on ''[[Celebrity Boxing]]''.\n* [[Fred Wolf (writer)|Fred Wolf]] as Dickie's Corner Man\n* [[Joey Diaz]] and [[Kevin Grevioux]] as Emmanuel's Entourage\n* [[Spencer Garrett]] and [[Hal Sparks]] as Publishers\n* [[Rachel Dratch]] as Rob Reiner's Secretary\n* [[Retta]] as Sad Eye Sadie\n* [[Ian Gomez]] as Strange Man\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Mrs. Gertrude\n* [[Ambyr Childers]] as Barbie\n* [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]] as Maitre D'\n* [[Kevin Farley]] as Valet\n* [[Sasha Mitchell]] as Angry Driver\n* [[Erin Murphy]] as Brittany\n* [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] as himself, he is encountered by Dickie at an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting.\n* [[Dick Van Patten]] as himself\n* [[Jann Carl]] as herself\n* [[Peter Dante]] as himself\n* [[Jonathan Loughran]] as himself\n* [[Florence Henderson]] as herself, she partakes in the \"Child Stars on Your Television\" song.\n* [[Marion Ross]] as herself, she partakes in the \"Child Stars on Your Television\" song.\n* [[David Soul]] as himself (archive footage), he was said to be the father of Dickie through Peggy.\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as himself (uncredited), Dickie encounters him at a Lamaze class with his wife.\n\n===Former child star cameos===\n\n* [[Emmanuel Lewis]] as himself, he pairs off against Dickie in ''[[Celebrity Boxing]]''.\n\n===\"Child Stars on Your Television\" song===\n* [[Willie Aames]]\n* [[Fred Berry]]\n* [[Todd Bridges]]\n* [[Gary Coleman]]\n* [[Jeff Conaway]]\n* [[Tony Dow]]\n* [[Corey Feldman]]\n* [[Corey Haim]]\n* [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]\n* [[Barry Livingston]]\n* [[Mike Lookinland]]\n* [[Maureen McCormick]]\n* [[Eddie Mekka]]\n* [[Jeremy Miller]]\n* [[Erin Moran]]\n* [[Haywood Nelson]]\n* [[Jay North]]\n* [[Ron Palillo]]\n* [[Butch Patrick]]\n* [[Paul Petersen]]\n* [[Adam Rich]]\n* [[Rodney Allen Rippy]]\n* [[Ernest Lee Thomas]]\n* [[Charlene Tilton]]\n\n===Dickie's friends===\n* [[Danny Bonaduce]]\n* [[Dustin Diamond]]\n* [[Corey Feldman]]\n* [[Leif Garrett]]\n* [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]] as himself, he appears as a friend of Dickie who doubts that Brendan Fraser would hook him up with Rob Reiner.\n\n==Production==\n[[Fred Wolf (writer)|Fred Wolf]] and [[David Spade]] originally wrote a skit in the '90s for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' about a child star rampage, spoofing ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', for when [[Macaulay Culkin]] was hosting, but it was cut. The idea was later pitched to [[The WB]], but they turned it down. It was eventually totally rewritten and turned into this movie, originally written as a [[dark comedy]] with more references to drug use by child stars.\n\nSally's \"''Brick wall, waterfall''\" routine was something Jenna Boyd was doing on the set between takes. The filmmakers liked it and worked it into the script \u2013 twice.\n\nThe crew built an actual treehouse in the back yard of the house used for the exterior scenes of the Finney's home. The real homeowners liked it so much, they requested that the producers to leave it up after filming.\n\n===Lawsuit===\nParamount Pictures was sued for [[trademark]] infringement and dilution after this film was released.
