It features [[Steve Carell]] as the titular 40-year-old [[virgin]] Andy, an employee at an electronics store. [[Paul Rudd]], [[Romany Malco]], and [[Seth Rogen]] play co-workers who resolve to help him lose his virginity, and [[Catherine Keener]] stars as Andy's love interest, Trish.\n\nWatching Carell's performance in ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]'' (2004) inspired Apatow to cast him in the lead role for the film, and they wrote ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'' together. It was based on a sketch Carell created with [[The Second City]] where a man aged 40 hides a secret. Filming took place in [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Fernando Valley, California]], from January to April 2005.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States on August 19, 2005, through [[Universal Pictures]]. It received positive reviews from critics, with Carell being highlighted for his performance, and grossed over $177&nbsp;million worldwide on a $26&nbsp;million budget. He won accolades from the [[Golden Schmoes Awards]] and [[MTV Movie & TV Awards]] for this role while Keener received awards from the [[Boston Society of Film Critics]] and [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]]. ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'' was named by the [[American Film Institute]] one of 2005's Top 10 Films.\n\n==Plot==\nAndy Stitzer is a shy 40-year-old introvert who works as a stock supervisor at electronics store Smart Tech. He gave up trying to have sex after various failed attempts and lives alone in an apartment with a collection of action figures and video games. When a conversation at a poker game with his co-workers David, Jay, and Cal turns to past sexual exploits, they learn that he secretly is still a [[virgin]].\n\nAndy is mortified upon discovering the next day that everyone else at work has learned about the secret, including their boss Paula, who is attracted to him and later privately offers to take his virginity. He almost quits work in humiliation before David consoles him and recommends trying again to have sex. David, Jay, and Cal become determined to help Andy achieve this. They all give differing advice on how to interact with women.\n\nDavid invites him to join them for a [[speed dating]] event and unsuccessfully tries to reconnect with his ex-girlfriend Amy there. Jay drags Andy to various social events, books a painful chest [[waxing]] appointment, and sets him up with a prostitute, which all end with embarrassing results. Cal advises Andy to simply be confident and ask women questions instead of talking about himself. He practices this on a bookstore clerk named Beth, who quickly becomes intrigued by him. David gives Andy his pornography collection, encouraging him to masturbate.\n\nAndy eventually gets a date with a customer named Trish Piedmont. At the end of their first date, they almost have sex but are interrupted by her teenage daughter Marla. Trish suggests they postpone having sex, and Andy enthusiastically agrees; they decide to abstain until their twentieth date. Their relationship flourishes over the following weeks. She encourages Andy's dream of starting a business and helps fund it by selling his collectibles. After Marla argues with Trish over wanting birth control, Andy takes her to a group information session at a [[sexual health clinic]], where she is mocked for being a virgin. Andy admits his own virginity to defend her, earning him Marla's respect.\n\nMeanwhile, David suffers an emotional breakdown at work over his obsession with Amy and takes a vow of [[celibacy]], which leads to Paula giving his sales duties to Andy for the day and later promoting him to floor manager due to his high sales quota. As Cal takes on Andy's previous role, he hires a woman named Bernadette to work at the store, hoping to match her with David so he can move on from Amy. After Jay's girlfriend Jill breaks up with him due to his infidelity, he concedes to Andy that sex can ruin a relationship. Following a reconciliation with Jill, Jay later invites Andy and the others to a nightclub to celebrate her pregnancy.\n\nTrish tries to initiate sex with Andy on their twentieth date and becomes upset when he resists. They argue, and Andy leaves to meet his friends at a nightclub. He gets drunk and leaves with Beth to have sex at her apartment. Cal gets David and Bernadette to hook up, while Marla convinces Trish to reconcile with Andy. At Beth's, Andy sobers up and decides to leave without having sex, just as his friends arrive and encourage him to go back to Trish.\n\nAndy returns to his apartment to find Trish waiting for him. She has found David's porn collection; he tries to explain, but she flees in alarm and disgust, fearing Andy may be a [[sexual deviant]]. While pursuing her on his bike, Andy collides with her car, flying through the side of a billboard truck. She rushes to his side, and Andy finally confesses that he is a virgin. Trish is relieved and accepting, and they profess their love for each other. They eventually marry in a lavish ceremony with everyone in attendance, having generated roughly $500,000 from the sales of his action figures to pay for it, before having sex for the first time. The film ends with a musical sequence where all the characters sing and dance to \"[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Steve Carell 2010.jpg\n | alt1 = Image of Steve Carell wearing a black bow-tie with his tuxedo standing on the red carpet at the 2017 Academy awards.
