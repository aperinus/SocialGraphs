Produced by [[Michael Bay]] and [[Platinum Dunes]], it is a [[remake]] of [[Wes Craven]]'s [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|1984 film of the same name]], as well as the ninth overall installment of the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]]. The film is set in a [[Fictional location|fictitious town]] in [[Ohio]] and centers around a group of teenagers living on one street who are stalked and murdered in their dreams by a disfigured man named [[Freddy Krueger]]. The teenagers discover that they all share a common link from their childhood that makes them targets for Krueger.\n\n''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was originally to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', where the writers took the best elements from each of the films in the original series and created a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline but tried to create a scarier film. To that end, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring back his darker nature. The writers developed the character to be a child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead. Freddy's physical appearance was changed with the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] to be closer to that of a burn victim.\n\nBecause of the positive experiences Platinum Dunes' producers had in the area, ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was filmed primarily in Illinois. Craven expressed his displeasure when he was not consulted on the project. [[Robert Englund]], who portrayed Freddy in the previous eight films, voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role of Freddy.\n\n''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' had its world premiere at Hollywood on April 27, 2010, and was theatrically released in North America on April 30, 2010, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[New Line Cinema]]. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized its writing, acting, and the film's lack of depth and empathetic characters, but praised Bayer's direction and faithfulness to the 1984 film. Despite this, it grossed over $63 million at the domestic box office and over $117 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--STOP. Wikipedia is not a substitute for watching a movie, and plot summaries should not contain every minor detail. They are here to SUMMARIZE the basic events. For a horror movie, we don't need to explain how every single character was killed, and what everyone is doing that isn't relevant to the overall plot. Thank you. !-->\nWhile at the Springwood Diner, Dean Russell falls asleep at the table and meets a severely burned man in seared clothes wearing a bladed gardener's glove on his right hand. In the dream, the burned man cuts Dean\u2019s throat; in reality Dean cuts his own throat as his friends [[Tina Gray (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Kris Fowles|Kris Fowles]] and [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Notes|Nancy Holbrook]] look on. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children but cannot recall knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to have nightmares about the burned man and then refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die like Dean. Jesse Braun, Kris' ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. Covered in Kris' blood, Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having nightmares about the same man \u2014 [[Freddy Krueger]].\n\nJesse is arrested by the police under suspicion of murdering Kris and is killed by Krueger when he falls asleep in his jail cell. As her friends die, Nancy questions everyone's connection to each other, given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years. Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith discover that they attended the same preschool. Nancy's mother Gwen reluctantly tells Nancy and Quentin about Krueger, the preschool's groundskeeper who was accused of [[child sexual abuse|molesting the children]], including Nancy. Gwen explains that Nancy was his favorite and that she came home one day and told her mother about the things Krueger did to her in a secret location. Gwen alerted the other parents, including Quentin's father Alan, but she tells the teenagers that Krueger escaped before he was arrested. Refusing to believe her mother's story, Nancy attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school but discovers that all of them have been killed. Following Jesse's death, only she and Quentin are left. Meanwhile, Quentin falls asleep during his swim practice and sees a flashback to the parents, led by Alan, tracking Krueger down and burning him alive.\n\nAs a result of their [[insomnia]], Nancy and Quentin have sporadic [[microsleep]]s and become [[hypnagogia|hypnagogic]], causing them to dream and hallucinate randomly. To try to stop Krueger, they decide to go to the preschool to learn what they can. On the way, Nancy is attacked by Krueger when she hallucinates, during which she pulls a piece of Krueger's sweater out of the dream world into reality. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital, where he steals [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] to help them stay awake. Nancy and Quentin eventually make it to the preschool and uncover Krueger's hidden room to find proof of his crimes; they realize that Krueger, now a [[vengeful ghost]], wants revenge on them for disclosing his abuse. Nancy decides to pull Krueger out of the dream world and kill him in the real world. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she grabs Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked.\n\nKrueger goes after Nancy and explains that he deliberately left her for last so that she would be comatose. Quentin awakens and uses the adrenaline to wake Nancy, who then pulls Krueger into reality. They fight and Nancy uses a broken paper cutter blade to kill him before she torches the room with Krueger's body inside. She and Quentin escape and are rescued by the police officers and firefighters, who are unable to find Krueger's remains. After Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital, Krueger suddenly appears in the mirror's reflection. While Nancy screams, Krueger kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror and disappearing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of cast members of the Nightmare on Elm Street series|List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Notes|Nancy Holbrook]]\n** Kyra Krumins as young Nancy\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as [[Freddy Krueger|Fred \"Freddy\" Krueger]]\n* [[Kyle Gallner]] as Quentin Smith\n* [[Katie Cassidy]] as [[Tina Gray (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Kris Fowles|Kris Fowles]]\n** Julianna Damm as young Kris\n* [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]] as Jesse Braun\n** Bayden Coyer as young Jesse\n* [[Kellan Lutz]] as Dean Russell\n** Max Holt as young Dean\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Alan Smith \n* [[Connie Britton]] as Dr. Gwen Holbrook\n* Lia Mortensen as Nora Fowles\n* [[Kurt Naebig]] as Mr. Russell\n* Jennifer Robers as Mrs. Russell\n* [[Christian Stolte]] as Mr. Braun\n* [[Andrew Fiscella]] as a Prison Inmate\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn 2008, [[Michael Bay]] and his [[Platinum Dunes]] production company began the process of rebooting the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise with a remake of [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|the original 1984 film]].<ref name=\"NightAnno\">{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979807.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=New Line sets up new 'Nightmare'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=January 29, 2008|access-date=January 29, 2008|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120529175832/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979807?refCatId=13|archive-date=May 29, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Producer Brad Fuller explained that they would follow the same tactic from their [[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|''Friday the 13th'' remake<!--STOP.

Bayer recognized that Craven attempted to put more meaning into his films and that the character of Freddy Krueger affected the lives of a generation of people. For Bayer, remaking ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was about bringing that feeling to a new generation with a new spin on the character and story.<ref name=\"Bayerint\"/>\n\nFuller and Form likened the new film to their [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|2003 remake of ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'']] but instead of a remake, they saw it as more of a reimagining.<ref name=\"setpreview\">{{cite news|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11115|title=Set Visit Preview: A Nightmare on Elm Street|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=CraveOnline|date=July 21, 2009|access-date=July 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723081206/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11115|archive-date=July 23, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The pair also explained that ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' would have a different tone than their ''Friday the 13th'' remake.

It's why we thought that we could reach an especially broad audience with a new film, since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture.\"<ref name=\"LAint\"/> Overall, Bayer wanted to create a film in \"a darker world\" that made the audience ask, \"What makes a monster?\"\u2014is it a monster because of its physical appearance, someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove, or is it a monster because of something deeper within the man himself.<ref name=\"Rotint\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nWesley Strick was initially hired to pen a script for a new ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' because he had impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the 1995 film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''. Eric Heisserer was subsequently hired to provide a rewrite of Strick's script before the film moved into production.<ref name=\"LAint\"/> When Bayer came on board he received a script that reflected the combined efforts of Strick and Heisserer and which still \"needed to be tinkered with\". Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into \"[Freddy] as a person [and] how he became the thing he was\". Bayer expressed that unlike the ''Friday the 13th'' remake that picked the best parts from the first four films, the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' remake was coming straight from the first film.<ref name=\"Bayerint\"/>\n\nFor the remake, Freddy was brought back to his darker roots and away from the comical character he had become in later ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy did have one-liners but they come from a darker sense of humor and were not intended to be as campy as in previous films. Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester was used because if Freddy killed children, as in the original, it would have been easy for the teenage characters to figure out using the Internet what had happened.<ref name=\"Bloodint\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19996|title=Producer Brad Fuller Talks 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'|author=Chris Eggertsen|date=April 28, 2010|work=Bloody Disgusting|access-date=April 29, 2010|publisher=The Collective}}</ref> In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps because the dream-reality sequences could become repetitive.
