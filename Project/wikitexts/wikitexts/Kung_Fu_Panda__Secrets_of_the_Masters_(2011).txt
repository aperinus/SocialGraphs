Although, [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] and [[Victor Garber]] didn't reprise their roles from the sequel.\n\n==Synopsis==\nUnder the pretense of an emergency in the dead of night, Master [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]] ([[Jack Black]]) leads Master [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Tigress|Tigress]] ([[Angelina Jolie]]) and Master [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Mantis|Mantis]] ([[Seth Rogen]]) into breaking into the new Masters' Council exhibit in tribute of Masters [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Thundering Rhino|Thundering Rhino]], [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Storming Ox|Ox]], and [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Croc|Croc]]. Even though Tigress and Mantis are annoyed at the deception, Po engages their interest in the story of how the trio of masters first met.\n\nLong ago in the city of Jinzhou, where Kung Fu was practiced for the sport of [[street fighting]], Rhino ([[Paul Scheer]]), Ox ([[Dennis Haysbert]]) and Croc ([[Tony Leondis]]) were small-time pit fighters who attracted the attention of Grand Master [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Grand Master Oogway|Oogway]] ([[Randall Duk Kim]]), who, seeing their talent and focus, wished them to find something worthy to fight for. As the trio fought themselves to a standstill, two of the villainous [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Wu Sisters|Wu Sisters]] were freeing their leader and eldest sister Su Wu ([[Sumalee Montano]]). To recapture them, Oogway persuades Rhino, Ox and Croc into helping him find the sisters at Hubei Volcano. However, to his disappointment, Oogway has to appeal to them with vague prospects of being put on a path to riches to get that cooperation.\n\nWhile the Wu Sisters plot to unite the various criminal gangs to seize control of [[China]], Master Oogway has to brush off each of his compatriot's petty proposals during the journey to abandon the others for their benefit. At camp, Oogway eventually discovers that while Croc and Ox are motivated by narcissism and greed respectively, Rhino has a deep-seated need to win his dad Master [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Flying Rhino|Flying Rhino]]'s respect. To that, Oogway suggests to all of them that their current goals will only keep them wanting more, and \"changing course\" can lead to better lives for all. Before the trio can comprehend Oogway's point, a messenger bird from the Sisters arrives to reveal their plan and Oogway has the company set off immediately.\n\nTo encourage them to change their ways, Master Oogway secretly leads the trio into an extremely dangerous path across the Bridge of Mists and forces them to cooperate in order for them all to safely pass to illustrate his point of selflessness. However, when the trio finally learn that Oogway was being metaphorical about his promise of riches actually meaning \"emotional riches\", their protests accidentally get them trapped on a river of lava. Oogway manages to get them to safe ground, but he falls over a lava fall, leaving them with only the advice \"Remember the path\" to guide them now.\n\nDispirited at their loss, the trio try to find their way home. However, they encounter a rabbit village devastated by the Wu Sisters and its citizens' desperately try to hire them for protection. Moved by the villagers' plight, the trio decline the fee and resolve to stop the Wu Sisters for the sake of a higher ideal.\n\nThus motivated, the trio interrupt the Sister's summit. When the former street fighters reveal that they're doing this purely for honor, they intimidate the various visiting gangs into retreating while the Wu Sisters fight alone. Even though the Wu Sisters prove too much to fight individually, Rhino, Ox and Croc manage to combine their talents to defeat them in a coordinated attack. At the moment of their victory, Master Oogway (who somehow survived) reappears, having captured the rest of the gangs and praising his fellows for being worthy warriors who have found a higher purpose.\n\nThe scene returns to the exhibit in the morning, where Master Po concludes the story of how the new masters formed the Masters' Council in Gongmen City. Unfortunately, Master [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Shifu|Shifu]] ([[Dustin Hoffman]]) discovers them, Po initially thinking he is an exhibit. While not being furious, he still sets Po to work to repair the roof he damaged breaking in before the exhibit opens in 20 minutes (using a trowel that Po thinks is a legendary weapon). Unfortunately, Po manages to accidentally lock himself in a sarcophagus that once served as Su Wu's prison cell and is trapped, so he decides to take a power nap instead, leaving the roof unfixed.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Kung Fu Panda characters}}\n* [[Jack Black]] as [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po]]\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Tigress\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[List of Kung Fu Panda characters#Master Shifu|Shifu]]\n* [[Randall Duk Kim]] as Oogway\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Mantis\n* [[Todd Berger]] as Pig Server\n* David Cowgill as Flying Rhino\n* [[Donald Fullilove]] as Gorilla Guard #1\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Young Storming Ox\n* Joseph Izzo as Little Birdie\n* [[Tony Leondis]] as Young Croc\n* [[Edie Mirman]] as Mother Bunny\n* [[Sumalee Montano]] as Su Wu / Wing Wu / Wan Wu\n* [[Michelle Ruff]] as Money Bunny\n* [[Paul Scheer]] as Young Thundering Rhino\n* [[Paul C.
