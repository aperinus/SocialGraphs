However, as with its predecessors ''[[Futureworld]]'', ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', this was an example of \"CGI representing CGI\", and only depicted on CRT screens in the film, rather than being used as a special effect. The model had no skeletal or facial movements and was not a character. ''Looker'' was also the first film to create [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] (3D) shading with a computer,<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/visualeffects10.html Visual and Special Effects Film Milestones] from [[Filmsite.org]]</ref> months before the release of the better-known ''[[Tron]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nDr. Larry Roberts (Finney), a [[Beverly Hills]] [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]], is puzzled when four beautiful [[model (person)|models]] working in television [[Television advertisement|commercials]] request [[cosmetic surgery]] to make changes so minor as to be imperceptible to the naked eye. When these models later start dying under mysterious circumstances, he discovers they are all linked to the same advertisement research firm.\n\nThe Digital Matrix research firm rates advertising models using a scoring system to measure the combined visual impact of various physical attributes in television commercials. In an experiment to increase their scores, some models are sent to Dr. Roberts to get cosmetic surgery to maximize their visual impact. Though the models are physically perfect after the surgery, they still are not as effective as desired, so the research firm decides to use a different approach. Each model is offered a contract to have her body [[3D body scanning|scanned]] digitally to create 3D computer-generated models, then the 3D models are animated for use in commercials. The contracts seem to be incredibly lucrative for the models; once their bodies are represented digitally, they get a paycheck for life, never having to work again, since their digital models are used for all their future work in commercials.\n\nHowever, when these same models start dying under mysterious circumstances, Roberts becomes suspicious and decides to investigate Digital Matrix. He has a strong interest in investigating the deaths: he is considered a prime suspect by the police (from evidence planted at the scene of one of the murders) and his most recent patient, Cindy (Susan Dey), with whom he begins a romantic relationship. Cindy is the last of the models to be digitally scanned.\n\nDuring his investigation, Roberts discovers some advanced [[technology]] that the Digital Matrix corporation is using to [[Hypnosis|hypnotize]] consumers into buying the products they advertise. He also discovers a light pulse device, the Light Ocular-Oriented Kinetic Emotive Responses (L.O.O.K.E.R.) gun, that gives the illusion of invisibility by instantly mesmerizing its victims into losing all sense of time.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Dr. Larry Roberts\n* [[James Coburn]] as John Reston\n* [[Susan Dey]] as Cindy Fairmont\n* [[Leigh Taylor-Young]] as Jennifer Long\n* [[Dorian Harewood]] as Lieutenant Masters\n* [[Darryl Hickman]] as Dr. Jim Belfield\n* [[Terri Welles]] as Lisa Convey\n* [[Terry Kiser]] as commercial director\n\n==Production==\nCrichton started thinking about the subject of the film in 1975.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Fact, Fiction Intertwined By Crichton|author=Warga, Wayne.|date=Mar 1, 1981|work=Los Angeles Times|page=m22}}</ref> He says he went to a Los Angeles computer company to find out how they could create copies in commercials without looking too ridiculous and discovered a company in Texas was already doing it, called [[tomography]].<ref>{{cite news |date=6 February 1981 |last=Buckley |first=Tom |title=AT THE MOVIES; How Resnais made a success with science.

They really pissed that film away. They had Albert Finney running around in a security guard's uniform throughout the film. It didn\u2019t make any sense. It could have been a good picture. It was about how television controls. It was about how commercials manipulate people to buy products, politicians, whatever. But, they cut the film up for a television print. I don't know why they did that. They spent some bread on the picture too. It was a $12 million production.
