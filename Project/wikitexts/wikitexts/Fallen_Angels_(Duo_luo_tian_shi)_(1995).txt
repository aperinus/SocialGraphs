It features two intertwined storylines\u2014one tells the story of a hitman wishing to leave the criminal underworld ([[Leon Lai]]), the prostitute he starts a relationship with ([[Karen Mok]]), and his agent, who is infatuated with him ([[Michelle Reis]]). The other story is of a [[muteness|mute]] ex-convict on the run from the police  ([[Takeshi Kaneshiro]]) and a mentally unstable woman dumped by her boyfriend ([[Charlie Yeung]]). Set in 1995 pre-Handover [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], ''Fallen Angels'' explores the characters' loneliness, their alienation from the situations around them, and yearning for connections in a hectic city.\n\nWong initially wrote ''Fallen Angels'' as the third story of its predecessor, ''[[Chungking Express]]'' (1994), but split them into two separate movies due to their cumulative length. Similar to ''Chungking Express'', ''Fallen Angels'' features a fragmented narrative that emphasises mood and atmosphere over structure. Whereas its predecessor incorporates bright daytime colours, ''Fallen Angels'' consists of scenes exclusively shot at night and using darker colours alongside bright neons. Wong considered the two movies to be complementary counterparts exploring contemporary Hong Kong. Cinematographer [[Christopher Doyle]] extensively used [[wide-angle lens]] to distort the characters' faces on the screen, conveying their isolation from the surrounding world. Doyle also creates distorted tension in scenes of extreme violence with frantic, out-of-focus visuals. The soundtrack extensively uses [[Trip hop]] and [[pop music|pop]] songs to convey mood and maintain an \u201curban environment\u201d that plays with popular culture.\n\n''Fallen Angels'' was released in September 1995. Upon release, [[film critics]] commented that its styles resembled those deployed in ''Chungking Express''; many lamented that Wong had become self-indulgent, though as time went on critics began to be more appreciative of the film. At the [[15th Hong Kong Film Awards]] in 1996, it won three awards: Best Supporting Actress for Mok, Best Cinematography for Doyle, and Best Original Score for Roel A. Garcia and [[Frankie Chan]]. Retrospectively, critics commented that though ''Fallen Angels'' was not as groundbreaking as its predecessor, it remained one of Wong's most captivating films cementing his trademark styles. The film's abstract, non-conventional style, the context in which it was made, and its use of [[pastiche]] and [[intertextuality]] with regards to both popular culture and its predecessor ''Chungking Express'' have led to the movie being described as a [[Postmodernist film|postmodern film]] and as suggesting a postmodern reading.\n\nThe movie has since its release encompassed a large cult following, and is also the last film Wong fully shot in his native Hong Kong before embarking on more ambitious international productions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-01-23 |title=How Wong Kar-wai's 'Restoration' of \"Fallen Angels\" Spoils Pre-1997 Hong Kong |url=https://www.cinemaescapist.com/2021/01/fallen-angels-restoration-wong-kar-wai/ |access-date=2022-09-18 |website=Cinema Escapist |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie is composed of two stories that intersect with each other at differing times throughout the films, especially when some of the characters happen to be in the same place at the same time. \nThe stories merge at the end of the film. Both stories take place in 1995 in British Hong Kong.\n\n===First Story===\n\nThe story opens with the internal monologue of a [[contract killing|hit man]] named Wong Chi-ming (Leon Lai) and a woman he calls his \"partner\u201d (Michelle Reis). The two are sitting next to each other in the first scene, a scene covered in smoke and a black-and-white grainy filter. They exchange few words as they smoke cigarettes - suggesting the two share a distant and un-emotional relationship.\nAfter the hitman says his lines in response to the partner's question (\"Are we still partners?\")  suggesting in his response \"Partners should never be emotionally involved with each other.\", the scene cuts into the story.\n\nFrom the beginning, it becomes obvious the pair, despite being business partners for nearly 3 years (\u201c155 weeks\u201d), hardly know each other and rarely see each other, exchanging their plans for their kills over letters and faxes. It seems that the two have agreed to maintain a strictly professional relationship, whether that is the true desires of both of them or not. Despite this, the hitman's assistant, a provocatively dressed woman in short PVC skirts/dresses, fishnet stockings and [[Suspenders (British)|suspenders]], chokers, luxury handbags and high-heeled shoes that create the impression she is a prostitute or a club-goer rather than a hitman's assistant, cleans the hitman's crammed apartment near an underground railway, buys him some groceries (mainly beer) and faxes him blueprints of the places where he is to commit his murders. Obsessed with Wong in a romantic way and infatuated with his mysterious nature, she even goes through his trash, trying to get to know what kind of person he is. It is very clear that she has developed feelings for him despite his insistence on keeping to business. This emotionless approach to contract killing works well for the two in their first kill of the night, going smoothly and seamless. However, on the bus he runs into someone who recognises him from a more innocent time, a cheery old classmate called Ah-Hoi who is about to get married. Wong wryly notes in voiceover: \"Even if you're a killer, you still have classmates from grade school around.\" \nThe old classmate tries to sell him an insurance policy, but the hitman won't get one because it only reminds him that he wouldn't have anyone to name as a beneficiary; this reminds him that he is living an entirely solitary existence, travelling from place to place, in a non-functioning relationship with his assistant, engaging in contract killing.\n\nWong, a hitman who works for different clients, however appears to not care much for the consequences of his bloody deeds and even suggests at his lack at planning as a reason for his enjoyment of contract killing, suggesting this also as a reason for his \u201cpartner\u201d. Since her \u201cpartner\u201d keeps to himself, she frequents the bar he goes to just to sit in his seat and daydream about him. After playing a piece of music on the bar's jukebox, the hitman's assistant and her daydreaming about Wong prompts her to masturbate in the apartment's bed in an attempt to relieve her sexual frustration in not seeing him. Afterwards, the hitman's assistant encounters Ho Chi-mo, a mute ex-convict on the run from the police (Takeshi Kaneshiro) in her apartment building, the dense and chaotic [[Chungking Mansions]]. (This encounter is discussed in the \u201cSecond Story\u201d section). During their second killing of the night, the Hitman and his assistant notably put more emotion on the job, wandering around the area in a way that suggests they are looking around for each other. The job is successful, but results in a bloody mess and Wong injures his arm in the process.\n\nIncreasingly frustrated by the monotone, futile life of contract killing following his encounter with his old classmate, as well as a lack of free will, Wong considers ending his career as a hitman. However he wishes not to upset his partner, and so two weeks after he is injured, he asks to see his assistant, but does not show up to her visible annoyance. Certain that she will show up at the bar in a couple of days looking for him, he asks the bartender to leave a piece of music on the Jukebox called [[Forget Him (Teresa Teng song)|\u201cForget Him\u201d (\u5fd8\u8a18\u4ed6)]] with the number \u201c1818\u201d. The lyrics in this song tell her to forget the hitman, as he wishes for her to do. After listening to the music on the jukebox, understanding from the lyrics that the hitman wants her to forget him, the hitman's assistant is heartbroken and cries alone by the bar. Meanwhile, Wong has a late night meal at McDonald's where he encounters an eccentric, mischief-making prostitute nicknamed \u201cBlondie\u201d (Karen Mok) for her dyed blonde hair, who sits next to him and invites him into her apartment. While they spend time together, captured in crazy and wild scenes, the scene is juxtaposed against the hitman's assistant with her glamorous make-up all smudged, as she masturbates again to calm her upset nerves, smokes a cigarette on the apartment's bed and breaks down crying.\n\nWhile spending time with the hitman, Blondie has illusions that he is the ex-lover who left her for another woman (likely the hitman's assistant). Whether this is truth or not is never explicitly confirmed. Meanwhile, the hitman's assistant, travelling late at night on Hong Kong's [[MTR]] subway network, briefly walks past Blondie in a subway station, in which the two turn back and look at each other, each woman detecting Wong's scent on the other. The hitman's assistant showing visible rage in her expression, suggesting she knows about the relationship and is enamoured with rage and jealousy.\n\nAfter Wong and his assistant meet again in a darkly-lit scene, he tells her he wants to terminate their business relationship. She asks that he do her one more favour - another killing job. By this point, a clear emotional rift is present between the two. Afterwards, Wong decides to break up his relationship with Blondie, leaving her heart broken and in an emotional outburst where she bites him in the pouring rain and screams: \u201cI've left my mark, okay? You may forget my face, but you won't forget my bite.\u201d However, an apathetic man, the hitman does not feel guilty for breaking her heart. \"For her, I'm just a stopover on the journey of her life,\" he states. \"I hope she reaches her destination soon.\u201d With all emotion possible now placed on the cold line of work that is contract killing, the hitman sets out for his final killing job. Meanwhile, the hitman's assistant makes a phone call that gives away Wong's location to rivals - revealing the job to be a set-up. With a heavily tense atmosphere present from Wong, a notable departure from Wong's usual insistence on emotional matters staying out of professional work, Wong drinks alcohol and braces himself in the bathroom for a tense showdown, however Wong is killed while attempting to carry out the job. Wong however is pleased that he has finally been able to achieve free will; that is, the free will to make his own decisions and die.\n\n===Second Story===\n\nThe hitman\u2019s assistant lives in the same building, the dense and chaotic [[Chungking Mansions]], with Ho Chi-mo (Takeshi Kaneshiro), an ex-convict who has escaped prison and is on the run from the police. Recognising their shared backgrounds in criminality, she helps him elude the police when they search for him. Ho is mute and still lives with his father. For work, he breaks into other people's businesses at night and sells their goods and services, often forcibly to unwilling customers. He keeps running into the same girl at night, Charlie. Every time they meet, she cries on his shoulder and tells him the same sob story. Her ex-boyfriend, Johnny, left her for a girl named Blondie. She enlists his help in searching for Blondie. Ho Chi-mo falls in love. Later, she stands him up and he changes his ways, beginning a friendship and work relationship with a restaurant manager. He begins to film things around him with a video camera. His father passes away; he falls back into abusive habits, going so far as to cut off the hair of a man whose family he in the past forced to eat an excessive amount of ice cream. He and Charlie do not come into contact for a few months, but they run into each other while he is masquerading as a business owner. She is in a stewardess uniform and in a new relationship. She does not acknowledge him.\n\n===Ending===\n\nSometime later, with the intense blue of the very early morning hours drenching the dingy caf\u00e9 in which she is sitting, the hitman\u2019s assistant is sitting alone by herself. A woman usually associated with the grunge glamour in which she dresses, the agent appears a dishevelled mess, with no make-up. She comments on how, having decided to never again be personally involved with her partners in the aftermath of Wong\u2019s death, she has been suffering in a suggested long period of depression. Close to her in the same caf\u00e9, by chance, Ho-Chi mo is also sitting by himself when he is beaten up into a bloodied mess by a local gang, which the hitman\u2019s agent observes, suggesting that in the aftermath of his father\u2019s death, Ho Chi-mo has returned to his previous abusive habits. The two are clearly shadows of their former selves; these developments are regressions for these characters-\u2014real \u2018fallen angels\u2019. After he is beat up, the hitman\u2019s assistant realises the ex-convict is feeling the same sense of loss as her, with a silent spark between them that they both feel. After helping him get up from being beaten up, the ex-convict offers the assistant a ride home on his motorbike. He comments that while there\u2019s no chemistry - they\u2019d let too many chances pass them by - there is still some kind of connection. As they ride through early-hours Hong Kong in an alternation of frenetic camerawork and pixillated slo-mo, they cross through the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in scenes evocative of those of Ho Chi-mo and Charlie earlier in the film, into the Hong Kong skyline, with its morning light being the first and only instance of daytime in the movie; suggesting there is \u2018light at the end of the tunnel\u2019 for the both of them. The hitman\u2019s assistant comments that even though it\u2019s just a moment and that she hasn\u2019t been close to a man in ages, she enjoys the warmth he brings in this moment, suggesting there is emotional redemption in sight for these \u2018fallen angels\u2019.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Leon Lai]] as Wong Chi-ming, the hitman\n* [[Michelle Reis]] as the Hitman\u2019s agent/assistant\n* [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]] as Ho Chi-mo, the mute ex-convict (He Zhiwu in Mandarin)\n* [[Charlie Young (actress)|Charlie Yeung]] as Charlie\n* [[Karen Mok]] as Situ Hui-Ling, known as \u201cBlondie\u201d\n* Chan Fai-hung as Man forced to eat ice cream\n* Chan Man-lei as Ho Chi-mo's father\n* Toru Saito as Sato, the Japanese restaurant owner\n* Benz Kong as Ah-Hoi, the hitman\u2019s childhood classmate\n\n==Development and production==\nOriginally conceived by Wong as the third story for 1994's ''[[Chungking Express]]'' involving a lovesick hitman, it was cut after he decided that it was complete without it, and that the tone of the more demented content was not suited for the more light-hearted ''Chungking Express.'' Wong Kar-wai also explained that he had had so much pleasure in making the first story of ''Chungking Express'' that he felt he had made the film too long, and so he decided to skip the third story in releasing ''Chungking Express''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Brunette |first=Peter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vu7kAgAAQBAJ |title=Wong Kar-wai |date=2005-03-22 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-09547-4 |language=en}}</ref> After the release of ''Chungking Express'', Wong noted that the story of a lovesick hitman still interested him, and so he decided to develop it into ''Fallen Angels''. Wong also decided to \u201cgender-reverse\u201d the attributes of the roles in his new film, with the gun-wielding attributes of [[Brigitte Lin]] in ''Chungking Express'' being manifested in the hitman Leon Lai would play, while the sneaking-in of [[Faye Wong]] in ''Chungking Express'' to other apartments was reversed by Takeshi Kaneshiro\u2019s character sneaking into shops and businesses in ''Fallen Angels''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Brunette |first=Peter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vu7kAgAAQBAJ |title=Wong Kar-wai |date=2005-03-22 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-09547-4 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nHe instead decided to develop the story further into its own feature film and borrowed elements of ''Chungking Express'', such as themes, locations and methods of filming. Wanting to also try to differentiate it from ''Chungking'' and to try something new, Wong decided along with cinematographer [[Christopher Doyle]] to shoot mainly at night and using extreme wide-angle lenses, keeping the camera as close to the talents as possible to give a detached effect from the world around them.\n\nMany of the plot devices are related to those deployed in its predecessor ''Chungking Express''.{{sfn|Ma|2010|p=134}} The wide-angle distortion of images creates an effect of distance-in-proximity, conveying the characters' solitude.{{sfn|Mazierska|Rascaroli|2000|p=17}} The visuals are frantic, out-of-focus, and neon-lit.{{sfnm|1a1=Bowman|1y=1998|2a1=Clemens|2a2=Pettman|2y=2004|2p=134}} Rather than relying on dialogues, the story is narrated through characters' voiceovers.{{sfn|Payne|2001|p=}} The film's use of pop songs has also received extensive commentary.{{sfn|Louie|2010|pp=232\u2013233}}\n\nThere is also the use of different film stocks throughout the film and also a number of scenes where the film switches to black and white inserts covered in a grainy 'noise' effect. There is also a constant sense of Doyle's camera being present that is never disguised, with meticulous use of hand-held camera movement in the film. This 'follows' the characters as they move through a scene. The film also makes use of \u201cclaustrophobic\u201d shots involving fast and slow camera movements in a frenetic pace interpolated within crowded, chaotic locations in Hong Kong.  The film\u2019s colours are also distorted, with a distinctive green filter reminiscent of 1990s [[grunge]] aesthetics.\n\nA particularly heavy theme of Fallen Angels is the city of Hong Kong itself, with \u201cbedazzling shots\u201d of sites associated with 1990s Hong Kong such as neon-lit billboards and now-closed [[Kai Tak Airport]], as well as the city's visual landscape and 1990s uncertainty and anxieties present in its population at the time because of the looming handover of Hong Kong to China overwhelming the mood and feel of the film. Fallen Angels as such has been described as a \"time capsule\" of Hong Kong's mid-to-late-20th-century cultural golden age before [[Handover of Hong Kong|its handover to China in 1997.]] Wong himself stated that the movie's main character is the \"city itself\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-01-23 |title=How Wong Kar-wai's 'Restoration' of \"Fallen Angels\" Spoils Pre-1997 Hong Kong |url=https://www.cinemaescapist.com/2021/01/fallen-angels-restoration-wong-kar-wai/ |access-date=2022-09-18 |website=Cinema Escapist |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview, Wong had this to say:{{Blockquote|...To me, Chungking Express and Fallen Angels are one film that should be three hours long. I always think these two films should be seen together as a double bill. In fact, people asked me during an interview for Chungking Express: \"You've made these two stories which have no relationship at all to each other, how can you connect them?\" And I said, 'The main characters of Chungking Express are not [[Faye Wong]] or [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]], but the city itself, the night and day of Hong Kong. Chungking Express and Fallen Angels together are the bright and dark of Hong Kong.\" I see the films as inter-reversible, the character of Faye Wong could be the character of Takeshi in Fallen Angels; [[Brigitte Lin]] in Chungking could be Leon Lai in Fallen Angels. All of their characters are inter-reversible. Also, in Chungking we were shooting from a very long distance with long lenses, but the characters seem close to us.}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nTypical for a Wong Kar-wai film, ''Fallen Angels'' extensively uses pop songs, featuring a largely [[Trip hop]] soundtrack that appealed to the widespread popularity of Trip hop in 1994-1995.{{sfn|Louie|2010|pp=232\u2013233}} Wong Kar-wai initially wished to use the music of English Trip hop band [[Massive Attack]], however discovered it was too expensive, and so asked his composer in Hong Kong (Frankie Chan) to compose something similar in style.<ref>{{Cite web |title=BOMB Magazine {{!}} Wong Kar-wai |url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/wong-kar-wai-1/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=BOMB Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> As such, one track that is played prominently throughout the film is \"Because I'm Cool\" by Nogabe \"Robinson\" Randriaharimalala. It is a re-orchestration of [[Karmacoma]] by [[Massive Attack]], and samples the song. Also featured in the ''Fallen Angels'' soundtrack is a [[dream pop]] version of \"[[Forget Him (Teresa Teng song)|Forget Him]]\" sung by [[Shirley Kwan]], a reworking of the classic by [[Teresa Teng]], and one of the very few \"contemporary\" [[Cantopop]] songs ever used by Wong Kar-wai in his films. In the film, the song is used by the hitman to indirectly communicate the message to his assistant that he wants her to \u201cforget him\u201d, and is also used in the scenes afterwards in the [[McDonald's|McDonald\u2019s]] restaurant, where it plays over the restaurant\u2019s speakers as the hitman and Blondie encounter each other, a scene juxtaposed by the misery and sadness of the assistant crying. In contrast to Wong\u2019s other films such as ''Chungking Express'', ''Fallen Angels\u2019'' soundtrack displays more \u2018ethereal pieces\u2019,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-07-09 |title=A guide to Wong Kar-wai through his best soundtracks |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/wong-kar-wai-guide-best-soundtracks/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref> featuring the 1994 avant-garde/experimental ambient piece \"[[Bright Red|Speak My Language]]\" by American avant-garde artist [[Laurie Anderson]]. The song is used in scenes where the hitman\u2019s assistant visits the bar that the hitman frequents and masturbates in his room out of sexual frustration.{{sfn|Clemens|Pettman|2004|p=132}} The song, a moody track speaking of the living and the dead, is emblematic of the film\u2019s highly bleak outlook. In the ending scene, the [[The Flying Pickets|Flying Pickets]] version of \u201c[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]\u201d is used,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBYFCAAAQBAJ&q=fallen+angel+wong+kar+wai+only+you&pg=PA451 |title=A Companion to Wong Kar-wai |date=2016-01-26 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons Ltd. |isbn=9781118424247 |editor1-last=Nochimson |editor1-first=Martha P. |edition=2016 |location=West Sussex |page=451 |access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref> described as the only track in the film to express hopefulness, as the hitman\u2019s assistant and the ex-convict find a chance to escape from the film\u2019s seemingly perpetual night, and as they end the film seeking emotional redemption in their shared loss and the sunrise that emerges over the Hong Kong skyline.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-07-09 |title=A guide to Wong Kar-wai through his best soundtracks |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/wong-kar-wai-guide-best-soundtracks/ |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref> The film\u2019s official soundtrack was originally released on CD in 1995 but has since been occasionally re-released.\n\n==Critical reception==\nFallen Angels was released in September 1995, premiering at the [[1995 Toronto International Film Festival]], where it received considerable critical success<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth |title=Wong Kar-wai \u2013 Senses of Cinema |url=https://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/great-directors/wong/ |access-date=2022-09-18 |language=en-US}}</ref> and became the focus of the festival for its notable visual style.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Director Wong Karwai |url=http://en.chinaculture.org/library/2008-01/18/content_79112_3.htm |access-date=2022-09-18 |website=en.chinaculture.org}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] gave ''Fallen Angels'' three stars out of a possible four. Ebert said the film appealed to a niche audience including art students, \"the kinds of people you see in the Japanese animation section of the video store, with their sleeves cut off so you can see their tattoos\", and \"those who subscribe to more than three film magazines\", but would prove unsuitable for an average moviegoer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fallen-angels-1998|title=Fallen Angels|author=Roger Ebert|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=19 June 1998|access-date=2 May 2020}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film relied more on style than substance and wrote: \"Although the story takes a tragic turn, the movie feels as weightless as the tinny pop music that keeps its restless midnight ramblers darting around the city like electronic toy figures in a gaming arcade.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/07/movies/film-festival-review-better-a-broken-heart-than-shot-in-the-heart.html | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Holden | access-date=2 May 2020 | title=FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; Better a Broken Heart Than Shot in the Heart | date=7 October 1997}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Village Voice]]'', [[J.
