Beatrice Prior is warned that she is Divergent and thus will never fit into any one of the factions. She soon learns that a sinister plot is brewing in the seemingly perfect society.\n\nDevelopment of ''Divergent'' began in March 2011 when [[Summit Entertainment]] picked up the film rights to the novel with [[Douglas Wick]] and [[Lucy Fisher]]'s production company [[Red Wagon Entertainment]]. [[Principal photography]] began April 16, 2013, and concluded on July 16, 2013, with reshoots taking place from January 24\u201326, 2014. Production mostly took place in Chicago.\n\n''Divergent'' was released on March 21, 2014, in the United States. The film received mixed reviews: although its action sequences and performances, notably Woodley's, were praised, critics deemed its execution and handling of its themes to be generic and unoriginal, and compared it unfavorably to other [[young adult fiction]] adaptations.

The remaining population, the Factionless, have no status or privilege. Upon turning 16, children undergo a [[human serum albumin|serum]]-induced psychological aptitude test which indicates their best-suited faction, but can choose any faction as their permanent group at the subsequent Choosing Ceremony.\n\nBeatrice Prior was born into Abnegation, which runs the government. Her father Andrew serves on the ruling council along with Abnegation's leader Marcus Eaton. After her test results show equal attributes of multiple factions (Abnegation, Erudite, and Dauntless), marking her as Divergent, her [[proctor]] Tori Wu, a Dauntless woman, records her results as Abnegation, warns her to conceal her true results, and says that because Divergents can think independently and sense any serums injected into them, the government feels they threaten the existing social order.\n\nThe next day, at the Choosing Ceremony, Beatrice's brother Caleb chooses Erudite, while, after some hesitation, she chooses Dauntless. Afterwards, she meets Christina, Al, and Will, three other faction transfers to Dauntless. Christina and Al are from Candor, and Will is from Erudite. Eric Coulter, a brutal Dauntless leader, reminds the initiates that anyone not meeting the faction's high expectations of commitment and fearlessness will become Factionless. Beatrice volunteers to jump from a tall building into a dark hole and lands into a net. When Four, a transfer initiates' instructor, asks her name, she shortens it to \"Tris\", shedding her earlier identity.\n\nTris initially struggles in Dauntless training and ranks far below the cutoff after the first evaluation, but with Four's help, she slowly improves. Eric matches her against her nemesis, Candor transfer Peter Hayes, in a fight, who soundly defeats her. Unwilling to miss the most important test, Capture The Flag, she leaves the infirmary, joins the other initiates, secures her team's victory, and makes the final cut. In the next phase of training, the initiates face their worst fears in psychological simulations. Tris's divergence allows her to creatively solve the tests, but Four warns her to hide her abilities and to solve them as a normal Dauntless would, as Divergents can also manipulate tests and serums. Tris visits Caleb, who tells her that Erudite plans to overthrow Abnegation. When she returns, Al, Peter, and their fellow Candor transfer Drew attack her before Four rescues her. The next day, Al begs Tris to forgive him but she refuses and calls him a coward. He later kills himself by jumping into \"The Chasm,\" rather than live with the shame.\n\nTo prepare her for the final test, Four takes Tris into his own fear simulations, where she learns he is Tobias Eaton, and his father Marcus used to beat him as a child. Tris then passes her test and officially joins Dauntless. The other Dauntless are injected with a serum from Erudite, supposedly for tracking but actually for [[mind control]]. The next morning, the Dauntless prepare to execute Abnegation under Erudite's orders. As the new serum fails on Divergents, Tris must blend in to avoid suspicion. She finds Four, who identifies as Divergent. When the Dauntless move to raid Abnegation, the pair separate from the group and attempt to locate her parents, but Eric, realizing Four is not under control, captures both of them, taking Four into custody and ordering Tris's execution. Her mother Natalie appears and saves her but is shot and killed as they attempt escape.\n\nTris finds her father hiding with Caleb, Marcus, and several Abnegation members. The group sneaks into Dauntless headquarters, where Tris encounters Peter and forces him to lead them to Erudite's control center. Her father sacrifices himself in a shootout, and Tris goes in alone to find Four, now under stronger mind control designed for Divergents. Knowing his fears, she manages to wake him from the mind control, and both enter the central control room, where Erudite's leader Jeanine Matthews nearly has Dauntless execute the entire Abnegation faction. Tris uses a sample of the mind control serum on her to force her to cancel the program. The group escapes the compound and boards a train out of the complex.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Divergent characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Shailene Woodley - Flickr - nick step (2).jpg\n| width1 = 171\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Theo_James_Divergent_premiere.jpg\n| width2 = 161\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Shailene Woodley]] (''left'') and [[Theo James]] (''right''), who play the lead roles in the film\n}}\n\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Shailene Woodley]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Tris Prior|Tris Prior]], a 16-year-old girl formerly of  Abnegation who joins Dauntless\n** Elyse Cole as 10 year old Tris\n* [[Theo James]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Tobias \u201cFour\u201d Eaton|Tobias \u201cFour\u201d Eaton]], a Dauntless instructor who becomes Tris' boyfriend\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Natalie Prior|Natalie Prior]], Tris' mother\n* [[Jai Courtney]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Eric|Eric Coulter]], the ruthless leader of Dauntless \n* [[Ray Stevenson]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Marcus Eaton|Marcus Eaton]], the city council leader of Abnegation and Four's father\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Christina|Christina]], a new member of Dauntless and a friend of Tris\n* [[Miles Teller]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Peter Hayes|Peter Hayes]], a member of Dauntless who was an original member of Candor\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Andrew Prior|Andrew Prior]], Tris' father and a member of Abnegation\n* [[Ansel Elgort]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Caleb Prior|Caleb Prior]], Tris' brother who is a member of Erudite\n* [[Maggie Q]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Tori Wu|Tori Wu]], Tris' test administrator \n* [[Mekhi Phifer]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Max|Max]]\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Jeanine Matthews|Jeanine Matthews]], the leader of Erudite faction \n* [[Ben Lloyd-Hughes]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Will|Will]]\n* [[Christian Madsen]] as [[List of Divergent characters#Al|Albert]]\n* Amy Newbold as [[List of Divergent characters#Molly Atwood|Molly Atwood]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn March 2011, [[Summit Entertainment]] picked up the rights for ''Divergent'' with [[Douglas Wick]] and Lucy Fisher's production company Red Wagon Entertainment.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2011/03/18/twilight-divergent/|title=Summit Entertainment's Post-'Twilight' Plans Are 'Divergent'|access-date=June 6, 2013}}</ref> [[Neil Burger]] was announced as the director on August 23, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Limitless-Director-Neil-Burger-Drops-Uncharted-Drake-Fortune-Talks-Divergent-32625.html|title='Limitless' Director Neil Burger Drops 'Uncharted: Drake's Fortune', Is In Talks For 'Divergent'|first=Eric|last=Eisenberg|website=CinemaBlend|date=August 23, 2012|access-date=February 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828041239/https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Limitless-Director-Neil-Burger-Drops-Uncharted-Drake-Fortune-Talks-Divergent-32625.html|archive-date=August 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Evan Daugherty]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Vanessa Taylor]], said, \"I get hung up on the toughness of the movie but of equal importance is the love story between Tris and Four.
