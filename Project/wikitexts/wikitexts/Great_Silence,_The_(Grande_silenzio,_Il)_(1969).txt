An Italian-French [[International co-production|co-production]], the film stars [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]], [[Klaus Kinski]], [[Vonetta McGee]] (in her film d\u00e9but) and [[Frank Wolff (actor)|Frank Wolff]], with [[Luigi Pistilli]], [[Mario Brega]], [[Marisa Merlini]] and [[Carlo D'Angelo]] in supporting roles.\n\nConceived by Corbucci as a [[political cinema|politically-charged]] [[allegory]] inspired by the deaths of [[Che Guevara]] and [[Malcolm X]], the film's plot takes place in Utah prior to the [[Great Blizzard of 1899]]. It pits a [[muteness|mute]] [[gunslinger]] (Trintignant), fighting in the defence of a group of outlaws and a vengeful young widow (McGee), against a group of ruthless [[Bounty hunter|bounty killer]]s led by \"Loco\" (Kinski) and the corrupt banker Henry Pollicut (Pistilli). Unlike most films of the genre, which were filmed in the [[Province of Almer\u00eda|Almer\u00eda province]] of Spain to double for areas such as Texas and Mexico, ''The Great Silence'' was primarily filmed on location in the [[Dolomites|Italian Dolomites]].\n\nDistributed in most territories by [[20th Century Fox]], ''The Great Silence'' was theatrically released to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries. Controversial for its bleak and dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a [[cult following]] in the wake of its release. The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001, when it was made available on DVD by [[Fantoma Films]] and [[Image Entertainment]]; in Britain, it was first shown in 1990 on the [[BBC2]] program ''[[Moviedrome]]''.\n\nHaving received several theatrical re-releases, most notably in 2012 and 2017, ''The Great Silence'' is now widely regarded by fans and authorities on Spaghetti Westerns as one of the greatest films of the genre, and is acknowledged as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise has gone to the acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, [[Ennio Morricone]]'s score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the [[Western film]] genre. Retrospective critics and scholars of Corbucci's Westerns have also deemed ''The Great Silence'' to be the second film in the director's \"Mud and Blood\" trilogy, which also includes ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Specialists (1969 film)|The Specialists]]'' (1969).<ref name=\"specialists\">{{Cite AV media notes\n| title       = Western Excess: Sergio Corbucci and ''The Specialists''\n| year        = 2020\n| page        = 8\n| author      = Hughes, Howard\n| type        = booklet\n| publisher   = Eureka Entertainment\n| id          = EKA70382\n}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nHenry Pollicut and two other [[Bounty hunter|bounty killer]]s murder a man named Gordon and his wife. To prevent Gordon's son from giving them away, one of the killers slices the boy's throat, rendering him permanently mute. Pollicut becomes a corrupt [[Utah]] banker and judge of peace.\n\nYears later in 1898, Gordon's son, now going by the moniker \"Silence\", operates on a principle whereby he provokes his enemies into drawing their weapons first so he can kill them in self-defense with his [[Mauser C96]]. A severe blizzard has swept the frontier, bringing privation to the town of Snow Hill. As a result, much of the community is forced to steal in order to survive. Pollicut, seeking to make a profit by attaining their property after they are killed, places prices on the thieves' heads, attracting the attention of a bounty killer gang led by \"Loco\". As they prey on the outlaws, Silence works with the bandits and their allies to fight against the killers.\n\nOne of the outlaws, James Middleton, leaves the safety of the group to be with his wife, Pauline. James is subsequently killed by Loco when he takes Pauline hostage. Vengeful, Pauline writes to Silence, requesting him to kill Loco. Meanwhile, the newly-elected Governor, hoping to have order maintained before declaring an amnesty regarding the outlaws, assigns the righteous but bumbling soldier Gideon Burnett as the sheriff of Snow Hill. On his way, Burnett encounters the outlaws, who steal his horse for food. After getting lost in the snow, he finds a stagecoach travelling to Snow Hill, on which he meets Silence, and later, Loco. Upon arrival, Silence meets Pauline, who promises to raise his reward.\n\nPauline attempts to sell her house to Pollicut, who demands that she becomes his mistress \u2013 his reason for putting a bounty on her husband. Pauline bitterly refuses. Silence leaves for the town saloon, and attempts to provoke Loco into drawing. Instead, Loco savagely beats him before Silence fights back. Angered, Loco attempts to shoot him, but he is stopped by Burnett, who arrests him for attempted murder and prepares to take him to a prison in [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]]. Before leaving, Burnett requests that the townspeople provide food for the outlaws. Meanwhile, Pauline becomes romantically and sexually involved with Silence while tending his wounds.\n\nBurnett and Loco stop by a frozen lake to allow Loco to relieve himself, but he springs a trap, shooting the ice surrounding Burnett and leaving him to die in the freezing water. Loco rides to his hideout and convinces the rest of his gang to confront Silence. Determined to take Pauline by force, Pollicut attempts to rape her as his henchman, Martin, tortures Silence by burning his right hand. Silence overpowers Martin and kills Pollicut. Loco and his gang arrive to look for Silence, just as the outlaws appear at the edge of town to collect the provisions, having been previously advised to do so by Burnett. Deciding to use them to draw out Silence, the gang herds the bandits into the saloon and captures Pauline. Loco tells Pauline to have Silence duel with him \u2013 if Silence wins, the outlaws will be set free; if he wins, they will be killed.\n\nDespite Pauline's pleas that the duel is a trap, Silence stands outside the saloon. A killer shoots his left hand, greatly impairing his speed and marksmanship. Loco then stands in the doorway, ready to face the weakened Silence. As Silence begins reaching for his Mauser, Loco reaches for his [[Colt Single Action Army]] \u2013 but as Silence draws, another wounding shot is fired. Loco fires at Silence's head, killing him. Distraught, Pauline attempts to shoot Loco herself, but swiftly dies as well. The bounty killers turn their guns on the outlaws, massacring the entire group. As Loco and his men prepare to collect their bounties, he takes Silence's Mauser from Pauline's hands. The killers ride out of Snow Hill into the morning sun. A title card explains that Loco's actions resulted in widespread public condemnation of bounty killing, and a memorial was erected in Snow Hill to honor those who died by his greed.<ref name=\"TitleCard\" />\n\n===Alternate endings===\n====Happy ending====\nDue to the bleak nature of the original finale, Corbucci was obliged to shoot an alternate ending to appease his producers, who wanted the film to have a \"seasonal\" appeal due to its intended [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas holiday]] release. Production histories of ''The Great Silence'' previously suggested that this [[Happy ending|\"happy\" ending]] was shot specifically for the North African and Asian markets, although there is no evidence to suggest that this ending was seen in either region.<ref name=\"FM Book\" /> Some of the footage shot for this ending did, however, appear in the film's trailers.<ref name=ItalianTrailer>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VMhLqSTvy0 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/5VMhLqSTvy0 |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=THE GREAT SILENCE \u2013 TRAILER |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2015-11-07}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=\"DVD trailer\">{{cite video\n  | title = The Great Silence (Original theatrical trailer)\n  | medium = DVD\n  | publisher = [[Fantoma Films]]\n  | location = Los Angeles\n  | date = 1968\n}}</ref> Because it was believed that no audio elements for this ending had survived, early DVD releases of the film, such as the American release from Fantoma Films, feature it without sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=12471|title=DVD review at dvdtimes.co.uk|access-date=2006-10-29}}</ref> Later releases, such as the Film Movement Blu-ray, include the ending with synchronized Italian audio.<ref name=\"FM Book\">{{Cite AV media notes\n| title       = The Great Silence (Ending the Silence)\n| author     = Simon Abrams\n| year        = 2018\n| page        = 4-5\n| type        =booklet\n| publisher   = [[Filmmovement.com|Film Movement]]\n| id          = B07BZC5KDP\n}}</ref>\n\nIn this ending, Loco draws his gun without waiting to be prompted by Silence. Suddenly, Burnett, having survived falling into the frozen lake, rides into town on horseback and shoots Loco in the head, allowing Silence to kill the remaining bounty killers. Burnett frees the outlaws as Pauline takes the bandages on Silence's burnt right hand off, revealing a gauntlet that he used for protection, before applying bandages to his wounded left hand. As Burnett takes the thieves to the local jail to await their amnesty, he asks Silence to become his deputy, which he accepts with a smile.\n\n====Ambiguous ending====\nCorbucci also delivered another, lesser-known ending to his producers. This version serves as a recut of the intended ending with additional footage not seen in the theatrical version. It was never publicly released until it was included among the special features of Film Movement's Blu-ray.<ref name=\"FM Book\" />\n\nThis ending depicts Silence being shot by Loco's henchman in both of his hands before he can draw his gun; wounded, he collapses to the ground as Pauline watches in shock. Appearing to show a change of heart, Loco gestures to his men to leave the saloon. As a result, the fates of Silence, Pauline and the outlaws are left unknown.\n\n====Analysis====\nIn reviewing the alternate endings, film critic Simon Abrams believes that the producers' rejection of both of the above endings was justified, describing them as \"emotionally dissatisfying conclusions for Corbucci's otherwise harrowing anti-fable\". While finding the \"ambiguous\" ending's failures in its lack of answers for the fates of its characters, he considers the \"happy\" ending \"amusing\" due to its attempt to overhaul the film's pre-established tone. He also considers the latter to be of interest to fans of [[Sergio Leone]]'s films due to Silence's gauntlet serving as a possible reference to [[Man with No Name|Joe]]'s use of a bullet-proof sheet of metal in ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''.<ref name=\"FM Book\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as Gordon/\"Silence\" (\"Silenzio\" in the Italian version)\n*[[Klaus Kinski]] as \"Loco\" (\"Tigrero\" in Italian)\n*[[Vonetta McGee]] as Pauline Middleton\n*[[Frank Wolff (actor)|Frank Wolff]] as Sheriff Gideon Burnett (Corbett in Italian)\n*[[Luigi Pistilli]] as Henry Pollicut\n*[[Mario Brega]] as Martin, Pollicut's Assistant\n*[[Carlo D'Angelo]] as the Governor of Utah\n*[[Marisa Merlini]] as Regina, the Saloon Madam (R\u00e9gine in Italian)\n*[[Raf Baldassarre]] as Sanchez's Brother (Bobo Schultz in Italian)\n*Spartaco Conversi as Walter, Outlaw Leader\n*[[Remo De Angelis]] as Fake Sheriff in Flashback\n*Jacques Dorfmann (as Jacques Toulouse on French prints) as Miguel, Young Outlaw\n*Loris Loddi as Young Silence in Flashback (uncredited)\n*[[Bruno Corazzari]] as Charlie (uncredited)\n*Fortunato Arena as Outlaw (uncredited)\n*Benito Pacifico as Stagecoach Driver (uncredited)\n*Mimmo Poli as Barman (uncredited)\n*Claudio Ruffini as Bounty Killer (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n'''<small>Sources:<ref name=Hughes /><ref>R\u00e8ge, p. 333</ref></small>'''\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{Quote box|width=32em|align=left|quote=Every time I make a Western, I say \"This is the last\".

Having returned to [[Rome]] after completing principal photography on the [[Eurospy film]] ''[[Death on the Run]]'' in [[Athens]], he decided that another Western, set during a blizzard \u2014 reportedly an homage to two other \"snow Westerns\", [[Andr\u00e9 de Toth]]'s ''[[Day of the Outlaw]]'' and [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''<ref name=Western /> \u2014 would provide a similar change of pace. He had previously considered snowed-in valleys as the setting of ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'', although the prior film took place in muddy conditions due to time and budget constraints.<ref name=Cox>Cox, p. 216-28</ref> According to actor and producer [[Lars Bloch]], this also gave Corbucci an opportunity to visit resorts within the [[Dolomites]], thus allowing him to go on a skiing holiday while making a film.<ref name=CoxIntro>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/50101903|work=[[Vimeo]]|access-date=November 20, 2015|title=Alex Cox intro for Corbucci's THE GREAT SILENCE}}</ref> The project was a co-production between the Rome-based production company Adelphia Compagnia Cinematografica and the Paris-based studio [[Les Film Corona]].<ref name=Hughes /><ref name=Corona>{{cite web|url=http://en.unifrance.org/movie/4518/the-great-silence|work=[[uniFrance Films]]|access-date=October 27, 2016|title=The Great Silence}}</ref>\n\nCasting English-speaking lead actors in [[Spaghetti Western]]s was a growing practice because it was believed to allow international marketability. [[Marcello Mastroianni]] had conceived the idea of a mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had always wanted to appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English.<ref name=Hughes>Hughes, p. 215-26</ref> When Corbucci first met [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]], who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by [[Franco Nero]] (who had previously played the title character of ''Django''),<ref name=\"AC\">{{cite video| title = The Great Silence (Alex Cox discusses The Great Silence)| medium = DVD| publisher = [[Fantoma Films]]| location = Los Angeles| date = 1968}}</ref> he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute.<ref name=Western>Giusti, p. 228-9</ref> At the time, Trintignant was known for his role in the critically acclaimed [[romantic drama]] ''[[A Man and a Woman]]'',<ref name=Hughes /> and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer [[Robert Dorfmann]], who was a friend of his.<ref name=\"box\" /> Silence was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.<ref name=Cox />\n\n===Casting===\nCorbucci hired established German actor [[Klaus Kinski]] to play Loco, a character who was partially intended to emulate Gorca, the [[vampire]] played by [[Boris Karloff]] in [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[Black Sabbath (film)|Black Sabbath]]'', which served as a major stylistic influence on ''The Great Silence''.<ref name=Hughes /> Other cast members were established [[character actor]]s in or outside the Spaghetti Western genre, including [[Luigi Pistilli]], [[Mario Brega]], [[Marisa Merlini]], [[Raf Baldassare]], [[Carlo D'Angelo]], Spartaco Conversi and [[Bruno Corazzari]] (an actor often compared to Kinski).<ref name=Hughes /> [[Frank Wolff (actor)|Frank Wolff]], usually known for playing serious or villainous characters, was [[playing against type|cast against type]] in the semi-comical role of Sheriff Burnett.<ref name=Hughes /> [[File:Silence and Pauline.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] and [[Vonetta McGee]] on the Elios Film set during the filming of ''The Great Silence''.]] [[Vonetta McGee]], a then-unknown [[pre-law]] [[San Francisco State College]] dropout and amateur actress who had moved to Rome to find work at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]], was cast as Pauline in her first film role. After appearing in Corbucci's film and [[Luigi Magni]]'s ''[[Faustina (1968 film)|Faustina]]'', McGee was invited to return to America by [[Sidney Poitier]], where she became a major actress in the [[blaxploitation]] genre.

Several Snow Hill scenes were shot on a set specifically built for the film, with log cabins and alpine roofs. Many of the surrounding hills were used for various set-pieces, including Loco's gang's hideout, the way station, the stagecoach route and the Snow Hill graveyard.<ref name=Hughes /> According to his autobiography ''[[All I Need is Love|Kinski Uncut]]'', Kinski had an on-set affair with actress \"Sherene Miller\" during the Cortina shoot, while his wife Brigitte and daughter [[Nastassja Kinski|Nastassja]] enjoyed sledding in the snow.<ref name=Hughes /> Production then moved to southern areas of Italy; Silence's flashback to his childhood was shot at [[Bracciano Lake]], near [[Manziana]] in Lazio. The Elios Film town set in Rome, which had previously been used by Corbucci in ''Django'', was used for several Snow Hill scenes (including the final duel).<ref name=Hughes /><ref name=Cox /><ref name=\"AC commentary\">{{cite video\n  | title = The Great Silence (Alternate \"Happy\" Ending with Commentary by [[Alex Cox]])\n  | medium = DVD\n  | publisher = [[Fantoma Films]]/[[Image Entertainment]]\n  | location = Los Angeles\n  | date = 1968\n}}</ref>\n\nMost of the Snow Hill scenes filmed at Elios were shot at night so that the fake \"snow\" looked more convincing; 26 tons of [[shaving cream]] was used to give the street a snowbound look.<ref name=Hughes /><ref name=Cox /><ref name=\"AC commentary\" /> For the daylight scenes, the Elios set was swathed in fog, to disguise the fact that the surrounding countryside had no snow.<ref name=WesternItalian>{{cite video\n  | title = [[Run, Man, Run]] (Western, Italian Style)\n  | medium = DVD\n  | publisher = [[Blue Underground]]\n  | location = Los Angeles\n  | date = 1968\n}}</ref> Camera [[overexposure]] was also occasionally used to avoid continuity errors.<ref name=Michael>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaeldvd.com.au/Reviews/Reviews.asp?ID=8746 |title=The Great Silence (Grande silenzio, Il) (1968) |publisher=Michael D's Region 4 DVD Info Page |access-date=2015-10-31}}</ref> The film's costumes were designed by Enrico Job (the husband of director [[Lina Wertm\u00fcller]]), and were influenced by [[hippie#Art and fashion|hippie fashion]] styles, including [[Scarf|muffler]]s, [[shawl]]s, and outfits made of [[fur]] and leather; Corbucci was known for standing heavily against the hippie [[subculture]].<ref name=Cox /><ref name=\"AC commentary\" /> Like other Spaghetti Westerns, the film was shot without direct sound to allow for post-production dubbing in multiple languages;<ref name=WesternItalian /> to further accommodate this, Corbucci claimed that he would often direct actors to perform in \"numerological diction\", a technique also used by [[Federico Fellini]], which required actors to count off numbers in their native language instead of performing lines.<ref name=WesternItalian /><ref>Betti, 185.</ref>\n\nAccording to McGee, Corbucci was \"the nicest man\" during production, and \"never tried to put the make on\" her. The actress attributed this to the frequent presence of his wife Nori on the set, noting that \"they were such a happy couple. They made it a great environment to work in.\"<ref name=Obit /> However, at one point while filming, Wolff had to be restrained from strangling Kinski when the latter insulted his [[Jewish]] heritage by telling him \"I don't want to work with a filthy Jew like you; I'm German and hate Jews.\" Following the incident, Wolff refused to speak to Kinski unless required to by the script. Kinski later declared that he insulted Wolff because he wanted to help him get into character.<ref name=Western />\n\n''The Great Silence'' was one of several Spaghetti Westerns produced between 1967 and 1968, along with [[Enzo G. Castellari]]'s ''[[Kill Them All and Come Back Alone]]'' and ''[[One Dollar Too Many]]'', [[Sergio Sollima]]'s ''[[Run, Man, Run]]'' and [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', to be showcased in Patrick Morin's [[made-for-television]] documentary ''Western, Italian Style''. During the making of the film, Corbucci and Trintignant were interviewed; Corbucci discussed the nature of violence in his films and Spaghetti Westerns in general (comparing the use of violence in such films to the [[James Bond in film|James Bond franchise]]), while Trintignant spoke of the unusual nature of his role and how he would practice drawing his gun \u2013 by pulling a sock (substituting for the gloves Silence wears in the film) off his hand and reaching for a long-stemmed [[artichoke]] in his pocket.<ref name=WesternItalian />\n\n===Post-production===\nFollowing the film's completion, ''The Great Silence'' was, as per standard procedure for a Spaghetti Western, edited in its final, completed form and dubbed into five languages: Italian, French, Spanish, German and English. Subtitled versions were created for foreign markets outside of the dubbed versions.<ref name=Hughes /> The English-language version was written by John Davis Hart and Lewis E. Ciannelli (the son of [[Eduardo Ciannelli]]) and recorded at Via Margutta Studios in Rome under Ciannelli's direction.<ref name=BFI /> Among the voice actors for the English version were [[Carolyn De Fonseca]], [[Edward Mannix]], [[Ted Rusoff]] and [[Mel Welles]].<ref name=\"DVDCompareReview\" />\n\nAlthough Hart and Ciannelli's dub script remains relatively faithful to the original Italian dialogue, the meaning of numerous lines and scenes were changed; Ciannelli in particular frequently embellished the dialogue of films in the dubbing stage, such as ''[[Arizona Colt]]''. Much of the dialogue concerning the outlaws, such as a remark made by Walter, the leader of the bandits, about their forthcoming [[amnesty]], as well as Loco's conversation with Burnett about the morality of the thieves, were rewritten to imply that most of the outlaws were being persecuted not simply because of their poverty, but for also practising [[Mormonism]]. Several of the characters' names were also changed from Corbucci's originals, for example, \"Tigrero\" became \"Loco\", \"Sheriff Gideon Corbett\" changed to \"Sheriff Gideon Burnett\", and \"Bobo Schultz\" was renamed \"Sanchez\".<ref name=Cox />\n\nFilm historian Howard Hughes suggests that, despite the implications of a large budget as a result of an international cast, as well as elaborate set and costume designs, there are several aspects that suggest otherwise. These include several continuity errors and revealing mistakes present throughout the film, and a variance in the quality of the [[film stock]]. In comparison to the [[Technicolor]]/[[Techniscope]] presentation most Spaghetti Westerns were filmed in, ''The Great Silence'' was filmed in the standard European [[widescreen]] format and printed in [[Eastmancolor]].<ref name=Hughes />\n\n==Interpretations and themes==\n\n===Character and environment subversion===\n''The Great Silence'' has been interpreted by various film critics and historians as a subversion of various conventions of the [[Western (genre)|Western film genre]]. Corbucci, who made his left-wing views either the subtext or subject of several of his films, wrote the film's story as an [[allegory]] highlighting the corruptions stemming from [[authoritarian]] forms of [[capitalism]], which are personified by the sadistic, greedy bounty killers led by Loco (who use the bounties to fuel their desires for violence and money while acting under the law), as well as the schemes of the banker Pollicutt. This is partially in line with the \"Classical Plot\" of both American Westerns (such as ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'') and certain Spaghetti Westerns (such as ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''), in which, according to Will Wright, a \"lone stranger rides into a troubled town and cleans it up, winning the respect of the townsfolk and the love of the schoolmarm.\"<ref name=Offscreen1 /> As a result of his sympathetic portrayal of the outlaws and the demoniac characterization of the people who hunt them, Corbucci's presentation of bounty killers is far more negative than such figures in [[Sergio Leone]]'s films \u2013 the closing title card of ''The Great Silence''<ref name=\"TitleCard\">{{cite AV media|title=The Great Silence|quote='''Closing title card''': The massacres of 1898, year of the Great Blizzard, finally brought forth fierce public condemnation of the bounthy [''[[sic]]''] killers, who, under the guise of false legality, made violent murder a profitable way of life.

That is why the bounty killers appeared.}}</ref>\n\nA key aspect of the film that differentiates its stylistic choices from other Westerns is its setting \u2013 a snow-bound Utah that contrasts with the desert plains seen in most Western films, American or Italian. The bleakness of the winter landscape complements the dark and pessimistic tone of the film, while providing motivation for the characters, as the living conditions and chances of survival are made more dire. The snowy backdrop isolates the events of the story by providing very little visible geographical detail, and \"fair metaphors for the enclosed, cruel world herein\" are created.<ref name=Cox /><ref name=Offscreen1 />\n\n===Subversion of protagonist===\n[[File:GreatSilenceCinematographyExamples.png|thumb|Silence rides through a valley in a scene that is referenced in the opening of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[The Hateful Eight]]''.<ref name=Hateful>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/158649742|work=[[Vimeo]]|access-date=March 26, 2016|title=THE HATEFUL EIGHT \u2013 Movie References}}</ref> [[Silvano Ippoliti]]'s cinematography frequently relies on tonal contrasts between different areas of the landscape.<ref name=Hughes />]]\nIn his analysis of the film, Donato Totaro compares Silence to other Spaghetti Western protagonists, and analyses him in [[Freudian]] terms \u2013 he is dressed in black (like Corbucci's previous creation, [[Django (character)|Django]]), is extremely fast and accurate with his gun, and is [[anti-heroic]], sharing some of his characteristics with Loco (both will kill other people on the grounds that they will receive payment). However, unlike other \"[[Stoicism|strong and silent]]\" Spaghetti Western characters, such as Django or Joe from ''A Fistful of Dollars'', Silence is completely mute, giving him a sense of vulnerability and sensitivity. In contrast to the [[Colt Single Action Army]] revolvers used by his fellow Spaghetti Western protagonists and the other characters in the film, Silence's choice of weapon is a [[Semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic]] [[Mauser C96]] \u2013 its rapid rate of fire gives him an unfair advantage over his opponents, therefore his marksmanship comes in part from technological, not physical, prowess. Like Django and Joe before him, Silence's hands are injured prior to the climax, greatly impeding his marksmanship. However, a further link to the bounty killers he fights is established \u2013 due to his throat being cut by their kind, Silence frequently shoots the thumbs of his enemies off, rendering them unable to use a gun. Also, unlike Django and Joe, neither his will to survive nor his advanced weaponry can save Silence in the final duel against Loco. The latter then delivers a \"symbolic [[castration]]\", as described by James Newton, upon the hero by taking the Mauser for himself after killing him.<ref name=Cox /><ref name=Offscreen1>{{cite web|url=http://offscreen.com/view/great_silence |title=Turning the Western on its head: Simple subversion in Sergio Corbucci's The Great Silence (1968) |publisher=Offscreen |access-date=2015-10-28}}</ref><ref name=Offscreen2>{{cite web|url=http://offscreen.com/view/guns-morality-and-death |title=The Great Silence: Guns, Morality and Death |publisher=Offscreen |access-date=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\n===Pauline's role===\n''The Great Silence'', as with many of Corbucci's Westerns, is known for its depictions of [[wiktionary:strong-willed|strong-willed]] female characters, namely the mother of the young outlaw Miguel (who requests Silence to kill Loco's compatriot Charlie), Regina, the saloon [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] who Sherriff Burnett falls for, and Pauline.<ref name=Cox /> Because she seeks vengeance for the death of her husband through Silence, falls for him through shared pain and loneliness, and supports him until they are both killed by Loco, Pauline plays a vital part in the film's narrative. She is also shown to be readily in control of her sexuality, as seen in her refusals to become Pollicut's mistress and her seduction of Silence as she tends to his wounds. Pauline is also African-American, and her interracial [[Sex in film|love scene]] with Silence has been seen as highly subversive, both in the context of Western films and commercial cinema as a whole.<ref name=Offscreen1 /><ref name=Offscreen2 /> Corbucci later commented:<ref name=Cox />\n{{cquote|text=People don't go to the cinema to see love scenes. [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]] was right when he said the most embarrassing thing, for a filmmaker, is to point a camera at a couple kissing. Nothing is more banal than a kiss. Generally you can't have love scenes in stories which are [[Action film|action-based]] \u2013 though in ''The Great Silence'' I shot quite a beautiful love scene between a black woman and a mute. There was something very beautiful and very morbid about it. This was the only love scene I ever included in a film of this genre, where the women are generally bizarre.}}\n\n===Deaths of protagonists===\nThe deaths of Silence, Pauline and the outlaws at the hands of Loco and his gang are a culmination of the subversive elements of ''The Great Silence'' and its [[anti-authoritarian]] stance. Killing sympathetic or leading characters was not a new tactic to Corbucci \u2013 the title character of his second Western, ''[[Minnesota Clay]]'', was seemingly killed at the end of the film's American prints.<ref name=Cox /> However, the political context of the later film plays a major factor in the presentation of its thematic concerns: when interviewed by the German magazine ''Film'', Corbucci revealed that he had dedicated ''The Great Silence'' to the memories of [[Che Guevara]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]], as he believed that their assassinations (all three happening while he was making the film) served to further their causes and resulted in widespread condemnations of violence.<ref>{{cite magazine\n| last       = Devena\n| first      = Mario\n| date       = May 1969\n| title      = Gespr\u00e4ch mit Sergio Corbucci\n| url        = http://monnomestpersonne1973.blogspot.com/2016/12/le-grand-silence-1968-2.html?m=0\n| magazine   = Film #4\n| access-date= January 20, 2019\n}}</ref>[[Alex Cox]] elaborates:<ref name=Cox /><ref name=Offscreen2 />\n\n{{cquote|Corbucci's widow, Nori, told [producer] Katsumi Ishikuma that her husband had the deaths of [Guevara] and [[Malcolm X]] in mind when he conceived ''The Great Silence''&nbsp;...

What further separates the deaths of the heroes and the anti-authoritarian position of ''The Great Silence'' from [[George A. Romero|Romero]] and Hopper's films is that, unlike ''Night of the Living Dead'' and ''Easy Rider'', which were produced without the restrictions of well-established genre conventions, Corbucci's film also subverts and comments on the genre that it is part of;<ref name=Offscreen1 /> in contrast to the relatively rare circumstances of the face-to-face [[gunfight at the O.K.

It's easy to see why. The film, like most Italian westerns, is incredibly bleak and pessimistic; but worse, it has the most horrible ending of any film I've ever seen&nbsp;... The beginning of ''The Big Silence'' is a little ragged, but bear with it. Once you're aboard the stagecoach with Trintignant and Klaus Kinski \u2013 who plays the politest murderer out west \u2013 you're in for an amazing ride.

Although praising the locations, as well as the performances of Kinski and Trintignant, Morricone's score, the realistic approach to the story and [[Silvano Ippoliti]]'s cinematography, he felt that the characterizations were lacking, adding that Corbucci's direction often \"drifts and falters\" and lacks the \"operatic grandeur\" of Leone's films. Erickson also expressed that the film's ending was unsurprising given the [[nihilism|nihilistic]] nature of the rest of the film, but noted that he would have been more shocked by it had he seen the film upon its 1968 theatrical release.<ref name=DVDTalk />\n\nIn his analysis of the Spaghetti Western genre, Alex Cox described ''The Great Silence'' as Corbucci's \"tightest, most relentless Western; his best and his bleakest. It's shot in his trademark messy, over-edited, [[Dolly zoom|jerky-zoom]] style, and its [[telephoto]] [[close-up]]s are frequently out of focus. Yet it is incredibly beautiful\". He voiced praise for Ippoliti's strategy of \"shooting through things\" (a marked improvement over his work on ''[[Navajo Joe]]''), the tight script, the strong female characters and the [[Tragedy|tragic]] nature of the ending, rooted in Corbucci's pessimism towards the deaths of radical political leaders. Performance-wise, he described Sheriff Burnett and Regina, the film's equivalent of the \"cute/funny\" characters that had appeared in Corbucci's earlier Westerns, as \"tolerable\" due to their senses of [[dark humour]] and morality, and praised McGee, Pistilli and Brega's acting. Cox also felt that Kinski's Loco was the actor's finest appearance in a Western, and that Trintignant's performance, which might have seemed [[doll]]-like in the hands of actors such as [[Franco Nero]], [[John Phillip Law]] and [[Terence Hill]], was pulled off \"''flawlessly''. His character's moral quandary, and decision to sacrifice himself, are perfectly conveyed\". Noting that Corbucci seemed proud of ''The Great Silence'' \u2013 \"a great work, a great Spaghetti Western, a great Western, a classic of [[Transgressive fiction|transgressive]] cinema\" \u2013 Cox believes that Zanuck's withholding of the international release and its poor domestic performance were key factors in the decline in quality of Corbucci's output following its release.<ref name=\"Cox\" />\n\n===Reception of US theatrical run===\nDuring its North American 2017-2018 theatrical run, ''The Great Silence'' received enthusiastic notices from several reviewers, who tended to note its influence on Tarantino's work. ''[[The New York Times]]''' [[A. O. Scott]] felt that the film's \"brazen mixing of incompatible elements that defies categorization, imitation or even sober critical assessment.
