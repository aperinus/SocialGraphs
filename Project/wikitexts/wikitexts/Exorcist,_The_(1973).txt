It stars [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Max von Sydow]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Kitty Winn]], [[Jack MacGowran]] (in his final film role), [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]] and [[Linda Blair]]. It follows the [[Spirit possession|demonic possession]] of a young girl and her mother's attempt to rescue her through an exorcism conducted by a pair of [[Catholicism|Catholic]] priests.\n\nThe book was a bestseller, but Blatty, who also produced, and Friedkin, his choice for director, had difficulty casting the film. Unable to hire major stars of the era, they cast relative unknowns Burstyn, Blair and Miller (author of a hit play with no film acting experience), choices vigorously opposed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Brothers]] executives. [[Principal photography]] was also difficult. Friedkin insisted on realism, going to northern [[Iraq]] to film the prologue despite political instability in the region, relying on live special effects and casting real priests and medical personnel in the film. Crew also recalled that he was temperamental, often firing people without warning. A fire destroyed most of the set, some crewmembers died, and Blair and Burstyn suffered accidental long-term back injuries; he also deliberately made cast members uncomfortable, going as far as refrigerating the set where the exorcism scenes took place to temperatures well below zero so their breath would be visible. Production took twice as long as scheduled and cost almost three times the initial budget; some deaths and accidents that occurred have led to a belief that the film was cursed.\n\n''The Exorcist'' was released in 24 theaters in the United States and Canada in late December 1973. Audiences flocked to it despite mixed reviews, waiting in long lines during winter weather, many more than once; the sold out shows were even more profitable for Warners since they had booked it into those theaters under [[four wall distribution]] rental agreements, the first time a major studio had done that. Some viewers suffered adverse physical reactions, fainting or vomiting to scenes in which the protagonist undergoes a realistic [[cerebral angiography]] and later violently masturbates with a crucifix. Heart attacks and a [[miscarriage]] were reported among viewers; a psychiatric journal published a paper on \"cinematic neurosis\" triggered by the film. Many children were allowed to see it, leading to charges that the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA ratings board]] had accommodated Warner Bros by giving the film an R-rating instead of the X-rating they thought it deserved, in order to ensure its commercial success. Several cities attempted to ban it outright or prevent children from attending.\n\nThe cultural conversation around the film, which also encompassed its treatment of Catholicism (and, in the years since, its apparent anti-feminism), helped it become the first horror film to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]],<ref name=\"Susman\">{{Cite news |last=Susman |first=Gary |date=December 26, 2013 |title='The Exorcist': 25 Things You Didn't Know About the Terrifying Horror Classic |work=[[Moviefone|Moviefone.com]] |url=http://news.moviefone.com/2013/12/26/the-exorcist-facts/ |url-status=dead |access-date=August 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227173317/http://news.moviefone.com/2013/12/26/the-exorcist-facts/ |archive-date=December 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=strangemag/> one of 10 for which it was nominated, and winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]].

As Merrin prepares to leave Iraq, he encounters a large statue of Pazuzu and observes two dogs fighting in the desert.\n\nIn [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], actress Chris MacNeil works on a film directed by her friend Burke Dennings. For the duration of filming, Chris lives in a well-appointed house with her daughter [[Regan MacNeil|Regan]] and two servants, Karl and Willi Engstrom. Her personal assistant, Sharon Spencer, spends a great deal of time at the house as well. Georgetown-based priest [[Damien Karras]] visits his elderly Greek immigrant mother in New York. He confides to a colleague that he feels unfit in his role as counselor to other priests, citing a crisis of faith. Chris hears noises in the attic, and Regan tells her of an [[imaginary friend]] named \"Captain Howdy\". In a local church, a statue of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is found desecrated.\n\nChris hosts a party. Karras' friend Father Dyer, a guest, explains Karras' role as a counselor, mentioning that Karras's mother died recently. Regan appears and urinates on the carpet. After Chris puts Regan to bed, her bed shakes violently. Dyer consoles Karras, and Karras expresses guilt at not having been with his mother when she died. Karras dreams of his mother, a Saint Joseph medallion and\u2014briefly\u2014a demonic face.\n\nRegan becomes violent. She is subjected to several medical tests which fail to find anything physically wrong with her. During a [[house call]], a demon [[Spirit possession|possesses Regan's body]]; the possessed Regan exhibits abnormal strength. One night, Chris finds the house empty except for a sleeping Regan. Dennings is found dead at the foot of [[Exorcist steps|an outdoor staircase]] beneath Regan's window. Homicide detective William Kinderman questions Karras, confiding that Dennings' body was found with its head turned backward.\n\nRegan's condition worsens, and her body becomes covered with sores. A doctor mentions exorcism as a remote option, suggesting a possible psychological benefit. Kinderman visits Chris, explaining that the only plausible explanation for Dennings' death is that he was pushed from Regan's window. As Kinderman leaves, the possessed Regan stabs her genitals with a crucifix. To Chris' horror, the possessed Regan turns her head backwards and speaks in Dennings' voice. The possessed Regan is confined to her bedroom.\n\nChris seeks out Karras, who visits Regan. Over two meetings, the possessed Regan claims to be [[Satan|the Devil himself]], [[Vomiting|projectile vomits]] into Karras' face, [[Speaking in tongues|speaks in tongues]], and reacts violently when tap water is sprinkled on her, which Karras had claimed was [[holy water]]\u2014a point against genuine possession. The demon says it will remain in Regan until she is dead. Desperate, Chris confides that the possessed Regan killed Dennings. At night, Regan's nanny calls Karras to the house. They witness the words \"help me\" materialize on Regan's skin. Still ambivalent, Karras nevertheless concludes that an exorcism is warranted. His superior grants permission on the condition that an experienced priest leads the ritual while Karras assists. Merrin, having performed an exorcism before, is summoned.\n\nMerrin arrives at the house, warning Karras that the demon uses a psychological attack. As the priests read from the [[Roman Ritual]], the demon curses them. It focuses on Karras, verbally attacking his loss of faith and guilt over the circumstances of his mother's death. The priests rest momentarily and Merrin, shaking, takes [[nitroglycerin]]. Karras enters the bedroom where the demon appears as his mother. Showing weakness, Karras exclaims that the demon is not his mother. Merrin excuses Karras and continues the exorcism by himself. Karras assures Chris that Regan will not die and re-enters the room, finding Merrin dead. Karras beats the possessed Regan and demands that the demon take him instead. The demon rips a medallion of Saint Joseph from Karras' neck and begins to possess him, freeing Regan. Karras [[autodefenestration|hurls himself out the window]], tumbling down the stairs outside. Chris and Kinderman enter the room. Chris embraces the healed Regan, and Kinderman surveys the violence and confusion. Outside, Dyer administers the [[last rites]] as Karras dies.\n\nThe MacNeils prepare to leave, and Father Dyer says goodbye. Despite having no memory of her ordeal, Regan is moved by the sight of Dyer's [[clerical collar]] to kiss him on the cheek. As the MacNeils leave, Chris gives Dyer the medallion found in Regan's room.\n\n===Director's cut ending===\nIn 2000, \"The Version You've Never Seen\" or the \"Extended Director's Cut\", was released. In the ending of this version, when Chris gives Karras' medallion to Dyer, Dyer places it back in her hand and suggests that she keep it. After she and Regan drive away, Dyer pauses at the top of the stone steps before walking away and coming across Kinderman, who narrowly missed Chris and Regan's departure; Kinderman and Dyer begin to develop a friendship.<ref name=\"collins\">{{Cite web |last=Collins |first=Brian |date=May 8, 2012 |title=Collins' Crypt: The Exorcist Director's Cut Vs.

Some relatively minor changes were made, but the film depicts everything that could be verified by those involved.

He and Blatty reached a deal that gave him six months to get a studio to commit to filming ''The Exorcist''. Monash soon secured a deal to that effect with [[Warner Bros.]], who paid $641,000 (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|641000|1971|r=-3}}}} in modern dollars{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}).<ref name=\"CF Curse story\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fort |first=Benjamin |year=1974 |title=''The Exorcist'' |url=https://archive.org/details/Castle_of_Frankenstein_022_whole_Vol6n2_1974c2cChersUsedRazor-DREGS |magazine=[[Castle of Frankenstein]] |volume=6 |issue=22 |pages=34 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> Blatty recalled that studio head [[John Calley]] had been reading the book at his home, alone, in his bedroom, and found his dog unusually unwilling to join him on the bed. He tried to drag the dog onto the bed but the animal resisted vigorously. When he finally succeeded, he found the book was hot to the touch.<ref name=\"Daily Telegraph article\" />\n\nBlatty and Monash had agreed to be co-producers. But Monash wanted changes to the story Blatty opposed, such as setting it somewhere else, making Kinderman less colorful and Chris something other than a film actress, getting rid of the prologue and even Father Merrin's character. Hearing rumors that Monash was planning something behind his back, Blatty was able to sneak into his office at Warners and surreptitiously copy some papers from Monash's files that lent credence to those rumors. When he shared those papers with the studio, he became the film's sole producer.{{sfn|Blatty|2015|p=32\u201333}}\n\n===Writing===\n\nBlatty's screenplay follows the plot of his novel closely, but narrows the story's focus. Subplots like the desecration of the churches (and the relationship between Karras and Kinderman that develops from the latter's investigation), Karras's efforts to get the Church bureaucracy to approve the exorcism, and the ongoing medical investigations of Regan's condition, are acknowledged in the film but to a much lesser degree than they are in the novel. Similarly, characters such as Chris's household staff, Dennings, and Regan's father, play a much smaller role, and the overall time frame of the plot is condensed.<ref name=\"Looper story\">{{Cite web |last=Kench |first=Sam |date=April 29, 2022 |title=How ''The Exorcist'' Differs From The Book |url=https://www.looper.com/847611/how-the-exorcist-differs-from-the-book/ |access-date=September 13, 2022 |website=Looper |publisher=[[Static Media]]}}</ref><ref name=\"ScreenRant story\">{{Cite web |last=Hurych |first=Amanda |date=September 22, 2019 |title=10 Things In The Exorcist That Only Make Sense If You Read The Books |url=https://screenrant.com/10-things-in-the-exorcist-that-only-make-sense-if-you-read-the-books/ |access-date=September 13, 2022 |website=[[Screen Rant]]}}</ref>\n\n\"I compressed the first third of my book into only 33 pages\" of script, Blatty wrote later. He eliminated the subplot with Karl's daughter Elvira, despite its reinforcement of Merrin's belief that some good will always eventually come of any evil since at the end of the novel she goes into treatment for her heroin addiction. \"I hated to do that\", he admitted. \"But there simply wasn't time and the subplot had to go.\" For the same reason he greatly reduced the suggestions that Karras was responsible for both Denning's death and the desecrations in the chapel, hints he felt many readers had missed anyway.{{sfn|Blatty|2015|p=34}}\n\nSome scenes, particularly those with sexual content, were toned down for the movie since an actress of approximately Regan's age was expected to be playing the part. The scene where Regan masturbates with a crucifix was, in the book, more prolonged and explicit, with Regan seriously injuring herself yet attaining orgasm.<ref name=\"Looper story\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRant story\" /> The film also excludes the detail from the book that when possessed, Regan experiences constant diarrhea, requiring that she wear a diaper and giving her room a strong odor.<ref name=\"Tor story\">{{Cite web |last=Schnelbach |first=Leah |date=October 24, 2017 |title=''The Exorcist'' TV Series Subverts Its Own Troubled Franchise |url=https://www.tor.com/2017/10/24/the-exorcist-tv-series-subverts-the-franchise-through-diversity-queerness-and-feminism/ |access-date=September 13, 2022 |website=[[Tor.com]]}}</ref> One of the film's religious advisers, Father John Nicola, who had opposed including both the crucifix scene and the desecration, nevertheless advised that the language used by Pazuzu when possessing Regan should be even more profane than it was in the book, to an extent he considered more realistic; it was changed accordingly.<ref name=\"America article\" />\n\nBlatty also made the screenplay unambiguous about Regan's condition. In his novel every symptom and behavior she exhibits that might indicate possession is counterbalanced with a reference to an actual case where the same phenomena were found to have natural, scientific causes. Beyond Karras' initial professional skepticism, that perspective is absent from the film.<ref name=\"Looper story\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRant story\" />\n\nWhen Friedkin came onto the project as director, Blatty expected that, as directors usually do, he would propose some changes to the story. But Friedkin did not, insisting on following the novel closely. According to Blatty, Friedkin even asked him, in one scene, to restore some slight changes to his dialogue to what it had originally been in the book.<ref name=\"America article\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Linda Blair and Ellen Burstyn in The Exorcist.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Blair and Burstyn as Regan and Chris MacNeil.]]\nThe film's lead roles, particularly Regan, were not easily cast. Although many major stars of the era were considered for the role, with [[Stacy Keach]] signed to play Father Karras at one point, Blatty and Friedkin ultimately went with less well-known actors, to the consternation of the studio.<ref name=\"adams\" />\n\n====Chris and Father Karras====\nThe studio wanted [[Marlon Brando]] for the role of [[Lankester Merrin]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Coffin |first=Patrick |date=December 1, 2013 |title=The Unbearable Frightness of Being |url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2753/the_unbearable_frightness_of_being.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617082158/http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2753/the_unbearable_frightness_of_being.aspx |archive-date=June 17, 2015 |access-date=June 16, 2015}}</ref> Friedkin immediately vetoed this by stating it would become a \"Brando movie\".

He originally went to talk to Miller solely about the [[lapsed Catholic]]ism in the play, as background for the film. Since Miller had not read the novel, Friedkin left him a copy.<ref name=\"adams\">{{Cite web |last=Ryan Adams |date=April 29, 2013 |title=William Friedkin on casting The Exorcist |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/2013/04/29/william-friedkin-on-casting-the-exorcist/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604131538/http://www.awardsdaily.com/2013/04/29/william-friedkin-on-casting-the-exorcist/ |archive-date=June 4, 2016 |access-date=May 6, 2016 |website=Awards Daily}}</ref>\n\nThree [[A-list]] actresses of the time were considered for Chris. Friedkin first approached [[Audrey Hepburn]], who said she was willing to take the role but only if the movie could be shot in [[Rome]], where she had moved with her husband. Since that would have raised the costs of the movie considerably, created language barriers and made it impossible to work with crew members Friedkin was comfortable with, like [[cinematographer]] [[Owen Roizman]], he looked next to [[Anne Bancroft]]. She, too, was willing but asked if production could be delayed nine months as she had just gotten pregnant. Again, Friedkin declined her request as he could not wait that long; he also did not think the material was something she would want to be working on while tending to a newborn, which would also pose its own challenges. [[Jane Fonda]], next on the list, purportedly derided the film and turned it down.<ref name=\"adams\" /><ref name=\"THR podcast 7:30\">{{Cite podcast |url=https://simplecast.com/s/1aa3ff6f?t=7m30s |title=William Friedkin: The Exorcist |website=It Happened in Hollywood |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |host=Seth Abramovitch and Chip Pope |date=October 1, 2018 |time=7:30\u20139:20 |access-date=February 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329025151/https://simplecast.com/s/1aa3ff6f?t=7m30s |archive-date=March 29, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBlatty suggested his friend [[Shirley MacLaine]] for the part, but Friedkin was hesitant to cast her, given her lead role in another possession film, ''[[The Possession of Joel Delaney (film)|The Possession of Joel Delaney]]'', two years before.<ref name=\"adams\" /> After meeting [[Carol Burnett]] at a party, Friedkin believed she had the range beyond her comic television persona, and Blatty agreed, but the studio was not so eager to have her in the role.<ref name=\"Friedkin THR memoir excerpt\" /> [[Ellen Burstyn]] received the part after she phoned Friedkin and emphatically stated that she was \"destined\" to play Chris, discussing her own Catholic upbringing and later rejection of it.

However, no other alternatives emerged, and Ashley relented.<ref name=\"adams\" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Emery |first=Robert J. |url=https://archive.org/details/directorsintheir00emer/page/258 |title=The directors: in their own words |publisher=TV Books |year=2000 |isbn=1575001292 |volume=2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/directorsintheir00emer/page/258 258] |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nWith Burstyn now set in the part, Friedkin received a surprise return call from Miller. He had read the novel, and told the director \"that guy is me\", referring to Father Karras. Miller had had a Catholic education, and had studied to be a [[Jesuit]] priest himself for three years at [[Catholic University of America]] (also in Washington) until experiencing a [[spiritual crisis]], as Karras does at the beginning of the story. Friedkin thanked him for his interest but told him Keach had already been signed.<ref name=\"adams\" />\n\nMiller, who had done some stage acting but had never been in a film, asked to at least be given a [[screen test]]. After taking the train to Los Angeles since he disliked flying, Friedkin had the playwright and Burstyn do the scene where Chris tells Karras she thinks Regan might be possessed. Afterwards, he had Burstyn interview Miller about his life with the camera focusing on him from over her shoulder, and finally asked Miller to say [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] as if for the first time.<ref name=\"adams\" />\n\nBurstyn felt that Miller was too short for the part, unlike her boyfriend at the time, whom Friedkin had auditioned but passed on. The director felt the test was promising but, after viewing the footage the next morning, realized Miller's \"dark good looks, haunted eyes, quiet intensity, and low, compassionate voice\", qualities which to him evoked [[John Garfield]], were exactly what the part needed.

[[William O'Malley (Jesuit)|Father William O'Malley]], another Jesuit priest who taught English and [[theology]] at [[McQuaid Jesuit High School]] outside [[Rochester, New York]], had become acquainted with Blatty through his criticism of the novel.

Blatty assumed the two would soon reconcile. Two days later, according to Blatty, he was summoned to a meeting with not only Friedkin but his agent and seven studio lawyers who told Blatty he could not under any circumstances fire the director. After that, Blatty recalled to [[Peter Biskind]], he informed the studio he could no longer have any responsibility for controlling the film's budget, which he had believed to be his primary role as the film's producer; he and Friedkin did reconcile and got along well for the rest of the picture. Production costs soon exceeded the film's initial $4.2 million (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|4200000|1972|r=-3}}}} in modern dollars{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) budget.{{sfn|Biskind|1999|p=216\u201317}}\n\nFriedkin went to great lengths manipulating the actors, reminiscent of the old Hollywood directing style, to get the genuine reactions he wanted.<ref name=\"fear\" /> Later, Friedkin was unsatisfied with O'Malley's performance as Dyer ministers to the dying Karras at the end of the film, telling him he was doing it \"by the numbers\". O'Malley protested that it was 2:30&nbsp;a.m. and he had just administered last rites to his friend for the 15th time.

Since the demon's presence was, in the book, accompanied by the stench of Regan's near-continuous diarrhea, to ensure an equally distasteful odor on set the director would hide rotten meat or eggs on the set. While it worked initially, \"[t]he problem was the crew and the cast all got sick so we had to stop shooting\", she said.<ref name=\"New Statesman Dietz article\" />\n\nCrewmembers found Friedkin demanding and sometimes difficult to work with. One of the first shots for the movie when production began in New York was bacon being cooked in a griddle. The shot begins as a close-up and then pulls back. A wall had been built opposite the stove, leaving almost no space for the [[Camera dolly|dolly]], so Friedkin had shooting halted while it was removed. After that, he decided he did not like the way the bacon curled as it was being cooked, so the prop master was sent to look for preservative-free bacon, difficult to find at the time, further delaying the scene. Another crewmember recalls returning after three days of sick leave to find Friedkin still shooting the same scene.{{sfn|Biskind|1999|p=217}}\n\nDietz recalls that shooting took so long because Friedkin reshot most of the film. Even scenes that had been difficult to stage and film the first time, such as Regan's bed shaking, were redone. \"People were literally placing bets on what he would re-shoot next.\"<ref name=\"New Statesman Dietz article\" />\n\nAs Blatty had with him, Friedkin also fired and rehired crew regularly. One crewmember recalls seeing the director shake hands warmly with someone, and then seconds later tell a second person to \"get this guy outta here\".

In a 1974 interview with ''[[American Cinematographer]]'', the magazine of the [[American Society of Cinematographers]], Roizman discussed ''The Exorcist'' at length.<ref name=\"Roizman interview\">{{Cite interview |last=Roizman |first=Owen |subject-link=Owen Roizman |interviewer=Herb A.

They agreed that, like their earlier film, they wanted the next one to look as if shot with [[available light]]. But this time they would eschew ''Connection''{{'}}s documentary look. The MacNeil house was, unlike house interiors in horror films such as ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', designed to look normal and inviting. \"What we tried to do, by means of the lighting, was to give it a kind of ominous feeling\u2014as if some lurking, mysterious thing were hanging over it. That's about as far as we went with photographic style.\"<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\nWhile much of the filming took place in the set for Regan's bedroom, there were some other parts of the house set that presented challenges when filming. Roizman said the {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} ceiling of the basement set left no room for conventional lighting setups. \"There was really no place at all to put lights and, in doing any sort of pan around or dolly shot, we would have been fighting ourselves had we tried to use conventional lighting units.\" But the crew was able to make those shots work by replacing the ceiling's practical light bulbs with [[photoflood]]s.<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\n\"Friedkin demanded complete realism\", Roizman recalled. \"He wanted to see pictures with glass in them, mirrors on the walls and all of the other highly reflective surfaces you would naturally find in a house, we never tried to cover anything up, as we would normally do for expedience in shooting.\" This realism meant that the kitchen set, with much stainless steel and glass, was \"virtually impossible\" to light beyond the practical ceiling fixtures and whatever other lights they could manage to sneak in and hide. \"[W]e'd walk in, hit the switch and shoot\u2014through not much choice.\"<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\nOne shot early in the film seemed simple when seen but, according to Roizman, required intense preparation and rehearsal. In it, Sharon greets the doctors and escorts them upstairs to Regan's room. The camera starts the scene at the top of the staircase, follows the actors from there as they walk towards it, tracks backward in front of them as they walk up to it towards the room around two corners and then turns again to let the actors pass, [[panning (camera)|pan]] right and follow Karen as she goes to the door. It was necessary first to build a specialized chair for the camera operator on a track along the ceiling, then the [[Grip (job)|grips]] had to move the camera in sync with the actors without causing any bumps. It was then necessary to light the scene while avoiding any crew shadows, which they did with photofloods and [[striplight]]s through overhead [[muslin]]. \"If I were to do that shot over again, I would probably underexpose a bit more to accentuate the shadows, but, all in all, the shot worked very well\" said Roizman<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\n===Filming and locations===\n[[File:Exorcist steps.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Exorcist steps|\"''Exorcist'' steps\"]], looking north, Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]]\nThe film's opening sequences were filmed in and near the city of [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]], a country with whom [[United States\u2013Iraq relations#Kurdish intervention, 1972\u20131975|the U.S. did not then have diplomatic relations]], and was also experiencing civil unrest that later grew into [[Second Iraqi\u2013Kurdish War|civil war]]; Warners feared that Friedkin and his crew might not be able to return.

Following the novel, Friedkin wanted the bedroom set to be cold, cold enough that the actors' breath could be seen.{{efn|Friedkin recalled that, in Hollywood's [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic years]], film productions that wanted to shoot interior scenes where it was cold enough to see actors' breath, such as ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' or ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'', would build sets at the [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] Ice Palace, a large ice factory which had closed long before ''The Exorcist'' went into production.<ref name=\"Friedkin DGA interview\">{{Cite interview |last=Friedkin |first=William |subject-link=William |interviewer=Jeffrey Ressner |title=Devil's Playground |url=https://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/0803-Fall-2008/Shot-to-Remember-The-Exorcist.aspx |access-date=September 20, 2022 |work=DGA Quarterly |publisher=[[Directors Guild of America]] |place=Los Angeles |date=Fall 2008}}</ref>}} A refrigeration system, which Friedkin describes as an [[air conditioning]] system powerful enough for a restaurant,<ref name=\"Friedkin DGA interview\" /> was installed at a cost of $50,000 (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|50000|1972|r=-3}}}} in modern dollars{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}})<ref name=\"AFI\" /> that could lower the temperature within to {{cvt|-20|F}},<ref name=\"America article\" /><ref name=\"Roizman interview\" /> cold enough that a thin layer of snow fell within it one humid morning, so the characters' breath would be visible.<ref name=\"fleshfarm\">{{Cite web |title=Friedkin's \u2013 The Exorcist |url=http://www.thefleshfarm.com/exorcist/exorcist1.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620121320/http://www.thefleshfarm.com/exorcist/exorcist1.htm |archive-date=June 20, 2012 |access-date=August 2, 2012 |publisher=Thefleshfarm.com}}</ref> Since the set lighting warmed the air, it could only remain cold enough for three minutes of filming at a time.<ref name=\"1996 Washington Post article\">{{Cite news |last=Slovick |first=Matt |date=1996 |title=The Exorcist |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/features/dcmovies/exorcist.htm |url-status=live |access-date=March 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930073703/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/features/dcmovies/exorcist.htm |archive-date=September 30, 2018}}</ref> It broke down frequently,<ref name=\"AFI\" /> and Friedkin was only able to complete five shots each day; the complete scene thus took a month to film, in continuity, the order they were written in the script.<ref name=\"Friedkin DGA interview\" />\n\nOriginally it was hoped that the room would not have to be chilled to that point, but at just below freezing, while the actors' breath ''was'' visible, the filming equipment warmed the set enough to quickly negate that. Going down to {{cvt|0|F}} worked, but according to Roizman Friedkin decided on the maximum in order to improve the actors' performance. \"An actor on his knees for 15 minutes at 20 below zero is really going to feel cold. It worked out very well.\"<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\nHaving gotten the actors' breath to appear, the next challenge was filming it. This required [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlighting]] the actors, which while it is easy enough to do in still photography is much harder while filming a movie. \"[W]ith the actors moving all the time, it got to be a bit difficult. It was always a matter of finding a place to hide the backlight and finding a way to keep it off of the actors\", Roizman said.<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\nBlair wore green contact lenses meant to give her eyes a bestial appearance for scenes where Regan is possessed. To accentuate them, the crew used a soft light with its [[Stage lighting accessories#Barn doors|barn doors]] nearly closed to throw a narrow strip of light across her eyes. \"It's probably a 75 mm lens, because we used that a lot\", Friedkin recalls.<ref name=\"Friedkin DGA interview\" />\n\nIt was easier to film some of the other supernatural manifestations, such as the bed rocking and the curtains blowing, in Regan's room since the walls and ceiling of the set were wild, or capable of being moved to accommodate a camera, until the scene where the ceiling cracks and it was necessary to use a hard one afterwards. The scene where Regan [[levitation|levitates]] as the priests chant \"The power of Christ compels you!\", for which a hole was cut in the ceiling for the rig to go through, was the most challenging.<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" /> the {{convert|80|lb|kg|adj=on}} Blair wore a [[bodysuit]] under her nightgown to which hooks for monofilament wires had been attached.<ref name=\"Friedkin DGA interview\" />\n\nRoizman said that while he had filmed similar scenes many times in television commercials, painting the wires to match the background so they would not show on camera was difficult on ''The Exorcist'' because of the changes in background. \"We had to practically paint them frame by frame\", he told the magazine. While most directors would have been satisfied to use editing to smooth out the scene, Friedkin wanted it in longer takes.<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" /> So effective was that painting that, when Friedkin returned to the film to prepare it for optical media release in the late 2000s, he found it unnecessary to apply any digital editing to that scene.<ref name=\"Friedkin DGA interview\" />\n\nFriedkin decided that he did not want any scenes in the movie to have \"any kind of spooky lights that you typically saw in horror films.\" So all the lights in the bedroom come from a visible source.<ref name=\"Friedkin DGA interview\" /> This was challenging because at one point one of the lamps lighting it falls on the floor; changing the way it had to be lit to preserve the impression of available light. At other times they flicker and dim, supposedly due to Pazuzu's influence. Lastly, at the end of the sequence, Friedkin wanted the lighting's mood to change, to \"have an ethereal quality\u2014a very soft, glowing, cool sort of thing\" without any apparent change in its sources. \"We tried, at that point, to work with absolutely no shadows in the room, using just [[Reflector (photography)#Bounce lighting|bounce light]]\u2014and I think we achieved the correct overall effect.\"<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\nSince it was so necessary to hide the lights with such a small room and so many people in it both on and off camera, Roizman and his crew mostly used \"inkies\", small [[incandescent light|incandescent]] bulb lights usually used to accentuate objects within the frame, \"hidden wherever we could find a place for one. We were constantly controlling them with [[dimmer]]s, so that if someone got too close to one, we'd take it down.\" He recalls his [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] at one point controlling four of them; as a joke he put sheet music in front of the man one day. Due to the low light used, it was necessary to use wide [[aperture]] settings in most of the interiors, not just Regan's room. \"I shot 90 percent of the picture wide open, as usual.\"<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\nThe room's color scheme also worked to create the impression of black and white. The walls were a [[Taupe#Taupe gray|gray taupe]], Regan's bedding a neutral beige, and the priests wore black. White, according to Roizman, would have been too dominant. \"In toning everything down like this, the only real color in the room became the skin tones\u2014an effect which I personally like very much\", he said. \"This sequence has an almost black and white feeling; yet, there is subtle color there.\"<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\n====Father Merrin's arrival scene====\nFather Merrin's arrival scene was filmed on [[Max von Sydow]]'s first day on set. The scene where he steps out of a cab and stands in front of the MacNeil residence, silhouetted in a misty streetlamp's glow and staring up at a beam of light from a bedroom window, is one of the most famous scenes in the movie, used for [[onesheet|film posters]] and home media release covers. It was inspired by [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]]'s 1954 painting ''[[The Empire of Light|Empire of Light]]'' (''L'Empire des lumi\u00e8res'').<ref>{{Cite web |last=Faherty, Allanah |date=January 14, 2015 |title=I Never Knew That These Artworks Inspired Some of the Scariest Horror Movies of All Time! |url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2583497 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604035619/http://moviepilot.com/posts/2583497 |archive-date=June 4, 2016 |access-date=May 6, 2016 |website=Movie Pilot}}</ref>\n\nFriedkin wanted to evoke visually the language Blatty used in the novel for this scene, likening Merrin to \"a melancholy traveler frozen in time\", standing next to a streetlight in the fog when he gets out of the cab. He gave the crew a full day to light the scene, using mainly arc lights and tripod-mounted \"troopers\", and boosting the brightness of the existing streetlamps. \"After a great deal of trial and error, we filmed on the second night.\"<ref name=\"Friedkin DGA interview\" />\n\nRoizman said of all the nighttime exterior shots in the film, Merrin's arrival was \"the trickiest\".<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" /> In order to get the beam of light the way Friedkin wanted it, the crew had to take the window frame out of the [[facade]] they had attached to the house for filming, put it behind the window and then put the spotlight in between the window and frame.{{sfn|Kermode|2008|p=130}} \"[I]t was difficult to get that bright of a glow from a shaded window and we also had to hold a fog effect all the way down the street\", Roizman said. \"Of course\u2014wouldn't you know\u2014just as we were ready to shoot, the wind came up, which made it more difficult to keep the fog settled in.\" By working quickly, he and the camera crew were able to get the shot,<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" /> with Friedkin finding the first take satisfactory.{{sfn|Kermode|2008|p=130}} At the time Roizman recounted this, the film had not yet been released and, based on [[dailies]] he had seen during production (which he allowed were not shown under the best possible conditions), he might have overlit the scene out of fear of missing detail. \"However, with proper printing, I'm sure it will come out dark enough.\"<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\n====Head spinning====\n\nThe scenes where the possessed Regan's head rotates 180 degrees so that she appears to be looking directly backwards drew significant notice from audiences and critics when the film was released. \"All I can tell you is that the way you think I did it is not the way we did it,\" Friedkin told ''Castle of Frankenstein'' at the time.<ref name=\"CF Friedkin interview\" /> Today it is known that that scene, like others in the film, relied on effects performed live in front of the camera rather than added in post-production.

Then Roizman noted that unlike the other characters in the scene, it did not exhale, so its breath was not visible in the chilled air, and a tube was added for simulated breathing, which produced the requisite clouds of vapor.<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\n====Crucifix scene====\n\nThe scene where the possessed Regan masturbates with a crucifix was filmed with Dietz playing the character since Blair was too young. To make it seem bloody, she struck it against a sponge soaked in stage blood that had been taped to her stomach. Dietz and Friedkin had a lengthy discussion before filming it about exactly how she was to move her arm. \"[H]is method wasn't correct, well, anatomically speaking\", she recalls. \"We had this long discussion about the right way to jerk off and I showed him why a woman has to churn her wrist [more than a man does].\"<ref name=\"New Statesman Dietz article\" />\n\nAs they were arguing about this, a photographer visiting the set was taking pictures of the two of them. When Friedkin saw this, he went over to the photographer, removed their film from the camera, and tore it up, then cleared the set so the two could consider the sensitive discussion privately. Dietz was appreciative of this display of control on his part. \"He knew how to create an environment where horror actors would be at their best.\"<ref name=\"New Statesman Dietz article\" />\n\n\"This particular scene is the most thought about and talked about scene for the obvious reason that it programs two things that are generally not programmed up-front in the human mind ... sex and religion\", Friedkin said at the time. It lasts only 50 seconds, yet to many viewers seems much longer, he noted. He had filmed much more, but ultimately decided, on his own without previewing it or consulting anyone, that it was about \"how much I could take\".

It was shot with limited time available on a Saturday afternoon, in one of the actual rooms used for the procedure. \"The space was cramped and there was really no room for rigging lighting equipment, so I decided to shoot the whole thing with available light, which, in this case, meant [[fluorescent light]].\" Unlike most of the other interiors in the film, that was more than enough light to be adequate and he was able to use a narrower aperture. Roizman's crew changed the light bulbs in the hallways so they would be the same color as those in the examining room. He was so pleased with the resulting footage that, for a later scene shot at a medical complex on [[Long Island]], where they had more space and control, they again used the existing fluorescent lighting with just some [[color correction]] filters in the camera and exterior light from the shades to compensate. \"[T]here was virtually no correction necessary in the lab, and the results were the best that I've ever had with fluorescents.\"<ref name=\"Roizman interview\" />\n\n====\"Spider-walk\" scene====\n[[Stuntwoman]] Ann Miles performed the spider-walk scene in November 1972, after having practiced it for two weeks.<ref name=\"2018 ADG story\">{{Cite news |last=Horn |first=Deborah |date=October 8, 2018 |title=Arkansas native reflects on a storied career as a stuntwoman, model, actress, wig stylist and Playboy Bunny |work=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] |url=https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/oct/08/miles-of-talent-20181008/ |url-access=subscription |access-date=October 8, 2022}}</ref> Vercoutere had designed a special harness, but she did not need it; as a former college gymnast at [[Florida State University|Florida State]] she was already a skilled enough contortionist to do the scene<ref name=\"ADG story\">{{Cite news |last=Martin |first=Philip |date=September 11, 2015 |title=Miles from famous |work=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] |location=[[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] |url=https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/sep/11/miles-from-famous-20150911/ |access-date=October 8, 2022}}</ref> on the first take.<ref name=\"2018 ADG story\" /> Friedkin cut it over Blatty's objection just prior to the premiere, since he thought it appeared too early in the film for such a drastic effect on Regan to be visible.

This confusion may have arisen from Vercourtere's website, where he credited her and described the harness he had designed that she supposedly wore to make the scene possible. He blamed the inability to erase it from the film for its exclusion. Miles has recalled that in reality Hager, her [[Double (filmmaking)|lighting double]],<ref name=\"2018 ADG story\" /> was unable to perform the scene even with the harness, which Vercourtere had hoped to bring to market afterwards.

In one scene from the film, Max von Sydow is actually wearing more makeup than Linda Blair, as Friedkin wanted some very detailed facial close-ups. At the time of shooting, von Sydow was 44, made up to look 30 years older. Many viewers did not realize he was made up at all, which [[Alan McKenzie]] calls \"a tribute\" to Smith;<ref>Alan McKenzie, [https://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Tricks-Trade-Alan-McKenzie/dp/0831742402 ''Hollywood Tricks of The Trade''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102038/http://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Tricks-Trade-Alan-McKenzie/dp/0831742402 |date=March 4, 2016}}, p.122</ref> critic [[Pauline Kael]], whose review of the film in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' was generally unfavorable, called it \"one of the most convincing aging jobs I've ever seen\"<ref name=\"New Yorker review\">{{Cite magazine |last=Kael |first=Pauline |author-link=Pauline Kael |date=January 7, 1974 |title=Back at the Ouija Board |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/01/07/1974-01-07-059-tny-cards-000304797 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |volume=49 |pages=59\u201360 |access-date=October 10, 2022 |url-access=subscription |number=46}}</ref> According to Friedkin, it took four hours to apply the makeup every morning. \"Dick Smith just happens to be the best in the world\", he says. He said that if there was a regular Academy Award for makeup, Smith would have received it.<ref name=\"CF Friedkin interview\" />\n\nFor the look of the possessed Regan, Friedkin and Smith drew their inspiration from the crucifix scene. If she had injured herself masturbating with it, they reasoned, it was likely that under Pazuzu's control she might also have [[self-harm|deliberately scourged]] her face. \"[So we] decided to have the makeup grow out of self-inflicted wounds to the face that become gangrenous so that there was an organic reason for the change in her facial features, which might certainly be demonic possession, or self-immolation\", Friedkin later explained.<ref name=\"Friedkin Vice interview\" />\n\nA [[latex]] stomach was built for the scene where the words \"HELP ME\" appear to be written on the possessed Regan's body. The letters were scratched in, and then heated to make them disappear. This part of the process was filmed and then run backward in the edit so the letters seemed to be appearing in the finished film.<ref name=\"CF Friedkin interview\" />\n\nThe scene in which the demonic entity leaves Father Karras was originally achieved by filming Miller in possession makeup, then stopping the camera and shooting him again with makeup removed. This creates a noticeable jump in Karras' position as he is unpossessed. The 25th anniversary video smooths over the jumpy transition with a subtle computer [[morphing]] effect, an update was not featured in prints used for Warner's 75th anniversary at film festivals.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\n==Post-production==\n\n===Editing===\n\n[[Bud S. Smith|Bud Smith]], who had gotten to know Friedkin while he was working on ''[[Putney Swope]]'' and other films with [[Robert Downey Sr.]] during the production of ''The French Connection'', recalls Friedkin calling and asking him to work on ''The Exorcist'' after shooting was done. Friedkin had already hired three other editors (Jordan Leonduopoulos, credited as \"supervising editor\", Norman Gay and [[Evan Lottman]]), but told Smith he would be the lead editor. Seeing how much film there was to edit, he asked Friedkin if he could take one large rack of footage and try cutting it. It was the Iraq sequence at the beginning of the film, and after Friedkin disliked his first attempt, Smith worked through a weekend to recut the footage to a rhythm based on the sound of a [[blacksmith]] hammering an [[anvil]] near where Father Merrin is having his tea, a change that the director liked more.<ref name=\"Smith podcast\">{{Cite podcast |url=https://library.nashville.org/podcasts/legends-film-podcast/legends-film-bud-smith |title=Legends of Film: Bud Smith |publisher=[[Nashville Public Library]] |host=William Chamberlain |date=August 29, 2014 |time=10:40\u201312:40 |access-date=September 25, 2022}}</ref>\n\nWhile working on the film, Smith also created a [[trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for the film known as the \"flash face\" trailer. After starting with Merrin's arrival scene and a voiceover broadly explaining what is happening, it cuts to a montage of faces from various scenes in the film, still, all appearing in all-white against a black background, which quickly swells to almost all white and then fades back to nearly black, making a [[strobe]]-like effect, as tense string music plays, ending after almost a minute and a half with the title. Friedkin said in 2018 that Warners declined to use it as they feared it would scare audiences too much. He considers it the best trailer made for the film.<ref name=\"2018 Friedkin trailer tweet\">{{Cite web |last=Friedkin |first=William |date=March 24, 2018 |title=Replying to @scottderrickson |url=https://twitter.com/williamfriedkin/status/977747488709926913 |access-date=September 26, 2022 |website=[[Twitter]] |quote=This was created by Bud Smith, the film's editor.

During principal photography, the editor then hired had never worked on a movie before and was forbidden from making any cuts to the raw footage. After shooting wrapped, he hired Lottman and closely supervised his work as he began editing. \"It was all about power,\" Lottman said. \"He wanted to be in control of the film.\" All four shared the Academy Award nomination the film received for its editing.<ref name=\"C&B article\">{{Cite web |last=Pelan |first=Tim |date=December 26, 2020 |title=Rats in the Attic: William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' |url=https://cinephiliabeyond.org/rats-in-the-attic-william-friedkins-the-exorcist/ |access-date=September 21, 2022 |website=Cinephilia & Beyond}}</ref>\n\nFriedkin's final cut was 140 minutes long; despite his insistence that it was perfect, Warners insisted he trim the film to much closer to two hours to allow for more showings each day. Blatty was willing to fight for the whole film as it was, but over his objections Friedkin cut roughly 10\u201312 minutes. Some of the excluded scenes were among Blatty's favorites, including the original ending, with Dyer and Kinderman connecting and agreeing to go to the movies together at some point, and a scene where Karras and Merrin take a break from the exorcism and discuss the demon's motivation for possessing Regan on the MacNeil stairs. These scenes had been in Blatty's novel, and he believed that in the movie they made it clearer at the end that good had triumphed and what was at stake. Friedkin also cut the \"spider-walk\" scene early in the film, where the possessed Regan walks downstairs on her hands feet, her face looking upwards, and harasses her mother's guests.<ref name=\"Den of Geek\">{{Cite web |last=Kaye |first=Don |date=February 3, 2022 |title=The Exorcist: How One Deleted Scene Can Change A Movie's Meaning |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-exorcist-deleted-scene-change-movies-meaning/ |access-date=September 28, 2022 |website=[[Den of Geek]]}}</ref>\n\n===Sound effects===\nSpecial sound effects for the film were created by [[Ron Nagle]], Doc Siegel, [[Gonzalo Gavira]], and Bob Fine.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kermode |first=Mark |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLiUKCPQWj8C&pg=PA125 |title=The Exorcist |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-85170-967-3 |edition=2nd revised |series=BFI Modern Classics |page=125 |author-link=Mark Kermode |access-date=August 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428033752/https://books.google.com/books?id=jLiUKCPQWj8C&pg=PA125 |archive-date=April 28, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> Nagle spent two weeks recording animal sounds, including bees, dogs, hamsters, and pigs; these were incorporated into the multilayered mix of the demon's voice.<ref name=\"Marriott\">{{Cite book |last=Marriott |first=James |title=Horror Films |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0753509418 |series=Virgin Film |author-link=James Marriott (author)}}</ref> Gavira achieved the sound effect of Regan's head rotating by twisting a leather wallet.<ref name=\"Marriott\" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=January 12, 2005 |title=Exorcist effects man Gavira dies |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4167805.stm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923202428/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4167805.stm |archive-date=September 23, 2016 |access-date=August 16, 2020 |website=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>\n\nFriedkin was personally involved in the sound mixing, which took four months. It was the last aspect of the film completed prior to release, finished only right before deadline. Jim Nelson, who Friedkin had hired to supervise the mixing, recalls the director being particularly demanding during this time, treating his then-girlfriend, who was among those assisting in the process, \"like a dog\". Nelson himself recalls going from \"having a seven-year contract as his associate producer to the guy he hated most in the world\u2014in two minutes\" after Friedkin overheard him telling Calley on the phone that the sound editors were \"basically finished\". Friedkin also used the time to solicit opinions on sections of the film from anyone uninvolved, particularly one janitor in the building, and if he liked it, he decided that portion of the film was done.{{sfn|Biskind|1999|p=222}}\n\n===Alleged subliminal imagery===\n''The Exorcist'' was also at the center of controversy due to its alleged use of [[Subliminal message|subliminal imagery]] introduced as special effects during the production of the film. [[Wilson Bryan Key]] wrote a whole chapter on the film in his book ''Media Sexploitation'', alleging repeated use of subliminal and semi-subliminal imagery and sound effects. Key observed the use of the [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu]] face (which Key assumed was Jason Miller in death mask makeup). He claimed that the safety padding on the bedposts was shaped to cast phallic shadows on the wall and that a skull face is superimposed into one of Father Merrin's breath clouds. Key also wrote much about the sound design, identifying the use of pig squeals, for instance, and giving his opinion of the subliminal intent.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nA detailed 1991 article in ''[[Video Watchdog]]'' examined the phenomenon, providing still frames with several uses of subliminal \"flashing\" throughout the film. Friedkin told the authors, \"I saw subliminal cuts in a number of films before I ever put them in ''The Exorcist'', and I thought it was a very effective storytelling device ... The subliminal editing in ''The Exorcist'' was done for ''dramatic'' effect \u2014 to create, achieve, and sustain a kind of dreamlike state.\"<ref name=\"Lucas\">{{Cite magazine |last1=Lucas |first1=Tim |author-link=Tim Lucas |last2=Kermode |first2=Mark |author-link2=Mark Kermode |date=July 1991 |title=The Exorcist: From the Subliminal to the Ridiculous |magazine=[[Video Watchdog]] |issue=6 |pages=20\u201331}}</ref> In an interview for a 1999 book about the film, Blatty addressed the controversy by explaining that, \"There are no subliminal images. If you can see it, it's not subliminal.\"{{Sfn|McCabe|1999|p=138}}\n\n===Titles===\nThe editing of the [[title sequence]] was the first major project for the [[film title design]]er [[Dan Perri]]. Friedkin had sought him out after seeing his work on ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'', before ''The Exorcist'' was even completed. \"It took a long time to design the simplicity of what we wound up using due to experimenting as the film changed shape\". Perri recalled. \"As [Friedkin] was tightening and evolving the story it would affect how the opening took place.\"<ref name=\"Perri article\" />\n\nWhen Friedkin played for Perri the music he wanted to use over the opening titles, preceded by a brief pan from the MacNeil household, as the light goes out in Regan's room, to the street, then a brief shot of the head of the Virgin Mary statue in the chapel, that pushed the title designer further in the direction of having the titles be very simple. \"On screen, the fewer the elements, the more important each becomes. So we're dealing with two elements: a screen that's black and type, the name of the film.\" The only other elements besides the title that had to be at the beginning of the film were the studio's name, and Blatty's and Friedkin's. The latter two were not on the best of terms at the time, according to Perri<ref name=\"Perri article\" /> (Blatty had sued Friedkin and the studio almost two months before the film's release to make sure his name was included in the opening credits<ref name=\"AFI\" />), which affected how he styled their names in the credits: \"[Legally], their names had to be the same size but where Bill Blatty has three names, of course they had to be the same size.\" Perri first showed Friedkin a version in which both of them had their names in two-line stacks, but later changed it so Friedkin's name was on one line, to distinguish him slightly.<ref name=\"Perri article\" />\n\nFor the words themselves Perri chose to keep the [[Weiss (typeface)|Weiss Initials]] [[typeface]] that had been used on the cover of Blatty's novel. The consensus among the filmmakers was that the words had to be red. But choosing an exact shade took some more time. \"When it's exposed against black it tends to, what's called, bloom. It swells, it glows, it's very hard to control. I had to do a lot of exposure tests just to get the right red that wouldn't bloom.\"<ref name=\"Perri article\" />\n\nPerri's input into the film's opening continued after those credits, as the music abruptly shifts to an [[Ululation|ululating]] male voice and the scene to the archeological dig site in northern Iraq. Friedkin told him he wanted the film to begin with a sunrise, even though he had not filmed one while there on location. The closest shot he had was one filmed at midday, of the sun in an orange sky, with rising heat visible. \"I suggested that we create an implied sunrise and that's what's in the film now\", Perri says, \"a very, very long fade in, like a 30-second fade in of the sun in the sky but in black and white. It very slowly dissolves into color\" That image gave the film the sense of beginning it had lacked.<ref name=\"Perri article\" />{{efn|Film scholar Kendall R. Phillips observes that that shot imparts to the film a subtle apocalyptic mood. \"The sun appears first in an equally bright sky, but the sky soon changes, becoming darker\", he writes. \"The state of the cosmos has changed in these opening moments. Something dark has entered the world; a shadow has encompassed humanity.\"<ref name=\"Projected Fears\">{{Cite book |last=Phillips |first=Kendall |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Projected_Fears_Horror_Films_and_America/axFSjNH1oRkC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PP113&printsec=frontcover |title=Projected Fears: Horror Films and American Culture |date=2005 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=9780313017964 |page=113 |access-date=October 7, 2022}}</ref><p>Colleen McDannell, in ''Catholics In The Movies'', notes that the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] vocalization heard on the soundtrack at this point is the ''[[adhan]]'', the Muslim call to prayer, its words proclaiming the greatness of God.

Friedkin himself delivered the demon's new, censored dialogue because he was unwilling to work with McCambridge again. The lines \"Your mother sucks cocks in hell, Karras, you faithless slime!\" and \"Shove it up your ass, you faggot!\" were redubbed as \"Your mother still rots in hell\" and \"Shut your face, you faggot\". Several of Chris' lines were redubbed by Burstyn, replacing \"Jesus Christ\" with \"Judas Priest\" and omitting the expletive \"fuck\". Moments in which Regan masturbates with a crucifix and forces her mother's head into her crotch are removed, along with most of the character's profanity. There is also a brief alternative shot shortly after Merrin arrives at the MacNeil house of Regan's face morphing into the demon's white visage (theatrical versions show only the beginning of the transformation). In some network versions Regan is not masturbating but having another fit.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nIn both the TV-PG and TV-14 rated network edits, the image of the obscenely defiled statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] is intact, appearing on-screen for several more seconds in the TV-14 version.

Many priests reported being called to minister to parishioners, some of whom had [[lapsed Catholic|lapsed in their faith]], who had been distraught by the film. A man in [[Denver]] walked out of a showing into the nearby [[Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception (Denver)|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]] half-naked and so disturbed that it took two priests, several attendants and the police to get him into it. A teenage girl in New Jersey stayed up all night with her parents [[Rosary-based prayers|saying the Rosary]] with her parents after seeing the film but still needed to reassured by a priest before she could sleep; even some priests themselves had similar issues. Many parishes reported callers who believed that they or a loved one was possessed and inquiring about how to arrange an exorcism. The Rev. Richard Woods, a professor at [[Loyola University of Chicago|Loyola of Chicago]], said most of the calls he got were from lapsed Catholics for whom the film resurfaced their [[Catholic education|religious education]] prior to [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]].{{efn|McDannell notes that, during the two [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] Karras says in the film, he mixes old and new elements of the liturgy, which had been revised considerably during Vatican II. She also speculates that the film's Jesuit advisors were behind the change from the black vestments he wears for his mother's funeral Mass in the novel to the white [[chasuble]] he dons for the scene in the film, to reflect the council's change in emphasis from the tragedy of death to the hope of eternal life.{{sfn|McDannell|2007|p=218\u201319}}}} \"It stirs up memories of all those descriptions of hell that you got from nuns,\" he said.<ref name=\"NYT Church story\">{{Cite news |last=Fiske |first=Edward B. |date=January 28, 1974 |title='Exorcist' Adds Problems For Catholic Clergymen |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/28/archives/-exorcist-adds-problems-for-catholic-clergymen-hit-film-the.html |access-date=October 10, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, ''[[The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]]'' published a paper by a psychiatrist documenting four cases of what he called \"cinematic [[neurosis]]\" triggered by viewing the film.

One writer at ''Castle of Frankenstein'' took note of Friedkin's pride in the movie's sound, which theaters played at maximum volume, and wondered if some of the low frequencies had induced or amplified feelings of dread or uneasiness in patrons.<ref name=\"CF general story\" /> Another writer there blamed the reactions on the mainstream audience's general unfamiliarity with horror cinema and its conventions. \"We have all no doubt heard of people who stood in line for four hours to see this movie, then threw up in mid-film and walked out,\" he wrote. \"I can't say for sure, but my guess is that these people hadn't gone to see a monster movie since 1935.\"<ref name=\"CF Roen\">{{Cite magazine |last=Roen |first=Paul |year=1974 |title=''The Exorcist'' |url=https://archive.org/details/Castle_of_Frankenstein_022_whole_Vol6n2_1974c2cChersUsedRazor-DREGS |magazine=[[Castle of Frankenstein]] |volume=6 |issue=22 |pages=32 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\n\"''The Exorcist'' ... was one of the rare horror movies that became part of the national conversation\", wrote [[Jason Zinoman|Zinoman]] almost 40 years later: \"It was a movie you needed to have an opinion about\". Three separate production histories were published. Journalists complained that coverage of the film and its controversies was distracting the public from the ongoing [[Watergate scandal]].<ref name=\"Shock Value\" /> Much of the coverage focused on the audience which, in the words of film historian William Paul, \"had become a spectacle equal to the film\". Paul cited an [[Associated Press]] cartoon in which a couple trying to purchase tickets to the film was told that while the film itself is sold out, \"we're selling tickets to the lobby to watch the audience.\" He did not think any other film's audience has received as much coverage as ''The Exorcist''{{'}}s.<ref name=\"Laughing Screaming\" />\n\n===Religious response===\n\n\"One of the best things that could happen is if the Pope denounces it\", Friedkin told an interviewer the month after ''The Exorcist'' was released. Some of the film's content, such as the crucifix scene, involved acts and utterances that were specifically sacrilegious from a Catholic perspective. Officially the Church, whose influence over the content of films had declined following the demise of the [[Hays Office]] and the associated Production Code a few years earlier,{{efn|Chambers notes that this often extended to depictions of medical procedures, rarely shown as a result, and thus some of the nauseating effect of the angiography scene on audiences was due to this: \"[The film] provided a scientific realism that film-makers had rarely presented, or had been censored from presenting to audiences, prior to this moment in cinematic history.\"<ref name=\"Religious response article\" />}} had bemoaned Warners' decision to release it immediately following Christmas. The [[National Legion of Decency#United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Office for Film and Broadcasting|United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office for Film and Broadcasting]], through its publication the ''Catholic Film Newsletter'' rated the film A-IV, suitable for adults only with reservations, and gave it a generally negative review that faulted the film for suggesting exorcisms were common and possibly encouraging belief in the occult and [[Satanism]].<ref name=\"Religious response article\" />\n\nIndividual priests familiar with the underlying theology also faulted the film. A priest who, like Karras, was a Jesuit and psychiatrist at Georgetown said that while he believed in the Devil \"there is no shred of evidence from the Bible that he can possess an individual.\" Woods, the Loyola of Chicago professor, who had written a book about the Devil, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Karras and Merrin were incompetent exorcists. \"They departed from the ritual in the most stupid and reckless manner,\" he said. \"They tried to fight the Demon hand to hand instead of relying on the power of God.\" [[Eugene Kennedy]], another Loyola priest and psychologist, described the film's view of the battle of good and evil as \"immature ... Being a Christian and a mature person means coming to terms with our own capacity for evil, not projecting it on an outside force that possesses us.\"<ref name=\"NYT Church story\" />\n\nCritics of the movie's depiction of Catholicism were not limited to the Church. \"Surely it is the religious people who should be most offended by this movie\", wrote Kael, incredulous that Georgetown and several priests facilitated the production:<ref name=\"New Yorker review\" />\n{{blockquote|Others can laugh it off as garbage, but are American Catholics willing to see their faith turned into a horror show? Are they willing to accept anything just as long as their Church comes out in a good light? Aren't those who accept this picture getting their heads screwed on backward?}}\n\nKael had nonetheless also described ''The Exorcist'' as \"the biggest recruiting poster the Catholic Church has had since the sunnier days of ''[[Going My Way]]'' and ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]''\" since the film \"says that [it] is the true faith, feared by the Devil, and that its rituals can exorcise demons.\"<ref name=\"New Yorker review\" />{{efn|Kennedy as well had compared the film to ''Going My Way'', although derisively.<ref name=\"NYT Church story\" />}} A later historian has found that the Church was not as critical of the film as media coverage at the time suggested. Privately it considered the film to be faith-affirming.<ref name=\"Religious response article\" /> In 2008, Colleen McDannell, editor of ''Catholics In The Movies'', wrote that \"''The Exorcist'' is a horror movie that believes in its villain and, even worse, recruits its villain as a witness to Catholic truth.\"{{sfn|McDannell|2007|p=208}}\n\nIn February 1974, the Jesuit magazine ''[[America (magazine)|America]]'' ran several commentaries and responses by priests to the film, some of which reiterated criticisms already made. The editors allowed Blatty to publish a response later that month. He praised some of the commentators' points, \"[b]ut I am truly dismayed at the misconceptions held, not only by critics, but also defenders of the novel and film. And when I see that they are Jesuits, whom I thanked on the acknowledgement page of my novel for 'teaching me to think,' I can only conclude that the fault must be mine, and that what I thought obvious, was not.\"<ref name=\"Blatty America response\">{{Cite magazine |last=Blatty |first=William Peter |author-link=William Peter Blatty |date=April 5, 2019 |title=William Peter Blatty on why there is good in 'The Exorcist' |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2019/04/05/william-peter-blatty-why-there-good-exorcist |magazine=[[America (magazine)|America]] |volume=220 |access-date=October 11, 2022 |number=8}}</ref>\n\nThe changes to the film's ending from the novel, Blatty agreed, might have made it harder to perceive that \"the mystery of goodness\" was the theme of the work, since it appeared to many viewers, including some of those who had written in the magazine, that the film ended with the demon triumphant through the deaths of the priests even if it had been successfully exorcised from Regan. The ending of the novel made this theme clearer, but even in the film he saw Karras's suicide as a sacrificial act of love that reaffirmed his faith in death. Blatty also corrected the misapprehension, common at the time, that the spirit possessing Regan was Satan, noting that it was explicitly named as [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu]] in the novel, and implied strongly in the film to be him. \"True, Regan tells Fr. Karras, 'And I'm the devil.'\" he conceded. \"But what constrains us to believe her? Believe that and you perforce must believe everything the demon has to say, including the accusation that Fr. Merrin is a homosexual.\" Lastly he responded to Woods' criticism of the absence of temptation as a theme in the film by saying that he chose not to explore that because not only did he see that focus as \"naive, mistaken and an excuse for evasion of confrontation with personal guilt\" but that he instead saw the Devil's greatest weapon against humanity to be \"the inducement of despair.\"<ref name=\"Blatty America response\" />\n\n[[Protestantism in the United States|American Protestant]] groups also took note of the ''Exorcist'' phenomenon and its religious implications. At first their response was negative.

Since many theaters would not show such films, and newspapers would not run ads for them, the X rating greatly limited a non-pornographic film's commercial prospects.<ref name=\"Shock Value\" />\n\nWhile Friedkin wanted more blood and gore in ''The Exorcist'' than had been in any Hollywood film previously, he also needed the film to have an R rating (children admitted only with an adult) to reach a large audience.<ref name=\"Shock Value\" /> He believes that part of the reason for Warners' decision to open the film in limited release was the studio's certainty that the film would be rated X, severely attenuating its commercial prospects.<ref name=\"2015 THR article\" /> Before release, Aaron Stern, the head of the MPAA ratings board, decided to watch the film himself before the rest of the board did. He then called Friedkin and said that since ''The Exorcist'' was \"an important film\", he would allow it to receive an R rating without any cuts.<ref name=\"Shock Value\" />\n\nSome critics, both anticipating and reacting to reports of the film's effect on children who might be or had been taken to see it, questioned the R rating. While he had praised the film, Roy Meacham, a critic for [[Metromedia]] television stations based in [[Washington, D.C.]], wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in February 1974 that he had strongly cautioned that children should not be allowed to see it even with an adult, a warning his station repeated for several days. Nevertheless, some had, and he had heard of one girl being taken from the theater in an ambulance.<ref name=\"Meacham NYT piece\">{{Cite news |last=Meacham |first=Roy |date=February 3, 1974 |title=How Did 'The Exorcist' Escape an X Rating? |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/03/archives/how-did-theexorcist-escape-an-x-rating-movies.html |url-status=live |access-date=March 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301140301/https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/03/archives/how-did-theexorcist-escape-an-x-rating-movies.html |archive-date=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Washington, the film drew strong interest as well since it was a rare film set in the area that did not involve government activity.<ref name=\"Washingtonian Blatty article\" /> The children Meacham saw leaving showings, he recalled, \"were drained and drawn afterward; their eyes had a look I had never seen before\". He suggested that the ratings board had somehow yielded to pressure from Warner not to give the film an X rating, and was skeptical of MPAA head [[Jack Valenti]]'s claims that since the film had no sex or nudity, it could receive an R. After a week in Washington's theaters, Meacham recalled, authorities cited the crucifix scene to invoke a local ordinance that forbid minors from seeing any scenes with sexual content even where the actors were fully clothed; police warned theaters that staff would be arrested if ''any'' minors were admitted to see ''The Exorcist''.<ref name=\"Meacham NYT piece\" />\n\n\"The review board [has] surrendered all right to the claim that it provides moral and ethical leadership to the movie industry\", Meacham wrote. He feared that, as a result, communities across the country would feel it necessary to pass their own, perhaps more restrictive, laws regarding the content of movies that could be shown in their jurisdictions: \"For if the movie industry cannot provide safeguards for minors, authorities will have to.\"<ref name=\"Meacham NYT piece\" /> In ''The New Yorker'', [[Pauline Kael|Kael]] echoed his insinuations that the board had yielded to studio pressure in rating the film R: \"If ''The Exorcist'' had cost under a million or been made abroad, it would almost certainly be an X film. But when a movie is as expensive as this one, the [board] doesn't dare give it an X\".<ref name=\"Shock Value\" /><ref name=\"New Yorker review\" />\n\nTwo communities, [[Boston]] and [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]], attempted to prevent the film from being shown outright in their jurisdictions. A court in the former city blocked the ban, saying the film did not meet the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s standard of obscenity.<ref name=\"Today show piece\">{{Cite news |last=Hartl |first=John |date=August 19, 2004 |title=Original 'Exorcist' was an event |work=[[Today (American TV program)|Today]] |publisher=[[NBC]] |url=http://www.today.com/id/5675185/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/original-exorcist-was-event/ |url-status=live |access-date=March 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306174912/http://www.today.com/id/5675185/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/original-exorcist-was-event/ |archive-date=March 6, 2019}}</ref> Nonetheless, in Boston the authorities told theaters they could not admit any minors despite the R rating.<ref name=\"Shock Value\" /> In Mississippi, the theater chain showing the movie was convicted at trial, but [[Mississippi Supreme Court|the state's Supreme Court]] overturned the conviction in 1976, finding that the state's obscenity statute was [[Vagueness doctrine|too vague]] to be enforceable in the wake of the Supreme Court's 1972 ''[[Miller v.

''Times'' critic [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] reported that a 16-year-old girl in California said that not only was she sold a ticket to see the film unaccompanied, others who seemed even younger were able to do so as well.<ref name=\"Van Gelder NYT article\" /> On the other hand, another ''Times'' writer, [[Judy Lee Klemesrud]], said she saw no unaccompanied minors, and indeed very few minors, when she went to see the film in [[Manhattan]]. Nevertheless, \"I think that if a movie ever deserved an X rating simply because it would keep the kids out of the theater, it is ''The Exorcist''\".<ref name=\"Klemesrud NYT article\" />\n\nIn 1974, Stern's tenure as chairman of the MPAA ratings board ended. His replacement, [[Richard Heffner]], asked during the interview process about films with controversial ratings, including ''The Exorcist'', said: \"How could anything be worse than this? And it got an R?\" After he took over as head, he would spearhead efforts to be more aggressive with the X rating, especially over violence in films.<ref name=\"Shock Value\" />\n\n===Viewing restrictions in United Kingdom===\n\n''The Exorcist'' was released in London in March 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Exorcist (1973) Release Info |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070047/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210315015531/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070047/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt |archive-date=March 15, 2021 |access-date=November 13, 2018 |website=IMDB.com}}</ref> The film drew protests around Britain from the [[Nationwide Festival of Light]] (NFL), a Christian public action group concerned with the influence of media on society, and especially on the young.

The U.S. women's liberation movement had enjoyed some early gains in legislatures and courts, and commentators have seen the film, in a which a single working mother and her apparently uncontrollable daughter are ultimately rescued by [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] authority, as a reaction against feminism specifically.<ref name=\"A.V.

Emergent female sexuality is equated with demonic possession.\" For the male authority figures in ''The Exorcist'', whether priests or physicians, Regan must be restored to her innocence through abusive and violent means if necessary, the aspect of the film that he notes led [[John Boorman]] to decline the directing job.{{sfn|Biskind|1999|p=223}}\n\nFor Breihan, this was because the film itself was reactionary: \"''The Exorcist'' seems like a transgressive work of art, but it's built on reverence of tradition. It has trust in institutions\" he writes. \"[It] almost sneers at the politics of the \u201960s and at the way Hollywood embraced them.\" In the film's most overtly political scenes, those showing the shooting of the film Chris is making, she dismisses its take on student protest as \"the Walt Disney version of the [[Ho Chi Minh]] story\". In the only scene she is shown shooting, her character, a faculty member at the fictional college, grabs a megaphone and counsels a group of protesters against taking over the building and shutting down classes, telling them, \"if you want change, you have to work within the system.\"<ref name=\"A.V. Club piece\" />  \n\nLike Biskind, many feminist critics have taken particular note of the film's focus on the female body as the site of horror in the film. \"When her body changes, Regan becomes ''someone else''; someone sexual, whose desire is a dark visitor, hollowing her out and corrupting her from within\" writes [[Jude Ellison Doyle]] in ''[[Dead Blondes and Bad Mothers|Dead Blondes and Bad Mothers: Monstrosity, Patriarchy and the Fear of Female Power]]''. \"To become a woman is to become the worst thing on Earth, the enemy of all that is pure or holy.\"<ref name=\"Doyle book\">{{cite book |last1=Doyle |first1=Jude Elliott |title=Dead Blondes and Bad Mothers: Monstrosity, Patriarchy and the Fear of Female Power |date=2019 |publisher=[[Melville House Publishing]] |location=Brooklyn, New York |isbn=9781612197920 |page=19 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Dead_Blondes_and_Bad_Mothers/tPd8DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA19&printsec=frontcover |access-date=October 24, 2022}}</ref> \n\nAustralian film studies professor [[Barbara Creed]], in her seminal 1993 work ''[[Barbara Creed#The Monstrous-Feminine|The Monstrous-Feminine]]'', which inaugurated [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] [[feminist film theory]], counters the prevailing feminist take on ''The Exorcist'' by insisting that Pazuzu is female{{sfn|Creed|1993|p=132}} and thus the possession of Regan is itself a feminist act, exposing \"the inability of the male order to control the woman whose perversity is expressed through her rebellious body\",{{sfn|Creed|1993|p=139}} as she navigates an incestuous desire for her mother.{{sfn|Creed|1993|p=143}} Ilkka M\u00e4yr\u00e4 argues that this reading \"to my mind, almost completely ignores the most important aspects of the particular conflicts that empower the demonic in this work\", since it seems to be based largely on a female actress voicing the demon,{{efn|Ilkka M\u00e4yr\u00e4 also points out that Creed mistakenly believes Regan to be on the verge of her 13th birthday, rather than her 12th as clearly stated in both novel and film, and also elides that Blatty based the story on an account of a possessed boy.{{sfn|Ilkka M\u00e4yr\u00e4|1999|p=156\u201357}}}} ignores the novel entirely as well as indications of its maleness in the film, such as the clearly phallic Pazuzu figure shown both in Iraq and Regan's bedroom, along with images of ailing masculinity such as Merrin's frailty. \"The demonic in ''The Exorcist'' can not be reduced to the conflict between sexes, even if the female body and sexuality (both male and female) play special roles in it.\"{{sfn|Ilkka M\u00e4yr\u00e4|1999|p=156\u201357}}    \n\n[[University of Toronto]] professor S. Trimble writes that the film tapped into \"white American fears of nightmare futures\" that could be brought about by the women's liberation, [[gay liberation]] and [[Black Power]] movements, which all challenged the established social order of the 1970s. As a film about \"a revolting girl revolting against the little-girl box in which she was stuck\" and army of men trying to put her back, ''The Exorcist'' fits into a tradition of horror movies that used gender-bending to create a monster, Trimble notes.<ref>{{cite book |title=It Came From the Closet|chapter-url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/It_Came_from_the_Closet/gxhaEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT15&printsec=frontcover |pages=9\u201319 |first=S. |last=Trimble |chapter=A Demon-Girl's Guide to Life |editor-first=Joe |editor-last=Vallese |publisher=The Feminist Press |location=New York City |year=2022 |isbn=9781952177798 |oclc=1325677846}}</ref>\n\nAs a graduate student, [[Texas State University|Texas State]] religious studies professor Joseph Laycock<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Joseph Laycock: Associate Professor\u2014Philosophy|url=https://faculty.txst.edu/profile/1922193|publisher=[[Texas State University]]|access-date=October 26, 2022}}</ref> wrote that the popular embrace of ''The Exorcist'' also pointed to reactionary popular trends in American religion. \"''The Exorcist'' is a depiction not of ecclesiastical Catholicism but of ''folk piety''\", which he also describes as extra-ecclesiastical religion, pursued by the lay masses, \"incorporat[ing] beliefs about divine or supernatural intervention in the realm of everyday experience\", as tolerant of [[Ouija boards]] and practices from other spiritual traditions as it was devout in its Catholic faith.{{sfn|Laycock|2009|p=3}} In the early 1970s, established organized religion in America, primarily but not exclusively the Roman Catholic Church, had increasingly turned towards the rational as the country became more secular: \"The authentic folk piety depicted in ''The Exorcist'' likely appealed to audiences [at the time] because it was a welcome alternative to rationalized religion and a cultural myth of universal secularization.\"{{sfn|Laycock|2009|p=23}}\n\n==Litigation==\n\nLawsuits among the creators of ''The Exorcist'' began even before the film was released, and have continued into the 21st century. In early November 1973, ''THR'' reported that Blatty had sued the studio and Friedkin, over both the credits and Friedkin banning him from the set. Friedkin said that he had only barred him from post-production. A week later [[Noel Marshall]], the film's executive producer, said Blatty had withdrawn his complaint against the studio but still planned to sue Friedkin; he eventually settled for the \"William Peter Blatty's ''The Exorcist''\" line in the opening credits.<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\nThe next round of disputes involved Friedkin and Dietz. In February 1974 she claimed that he had forced her to sign a [[nondisclosure agreement]] concerning her work in the film. While Friedkin had, in earlier publicity for the film, denied any use of a double for Blair, by the end of the month Dietz was saying that she had neither claimed to have been Blair's only double for the possession scenes nor talked about it to the media. The [[Screen Actors Guild]] ruled her contract was not binding, but then Dietz declined to [[Arbitration in the United States|arbitrate]] the matter.<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\nAround the same time, Warners paid Friedkin $4 million, his 10 percent share of the film's profits by that point. A year later, Friedkin sued the studio, claiming it had withheld another $8.5 million he was due under those terms. By 1978 it was reported that Friedkin had settled that suit, but by then Blatty was involved in litigation against Warners, claiming that the $15 million he had received from the studio as his share of the profit was still $1.5 million short.<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\nIn 2001, following the release of the extended version, which restored 11 minutes of footage and did well critically and commercially, Blatty and Friedkin sued Warners in federal court, alleging that they had been cheated out of profits they had been led to believe they would receive in return for helping promote the film. Specifically, they had been induced to do so by a promise of a share of the sale of the cable TV rights, which the studio gave to [[Turner Network Television]] and [[Turner Broadcasting System]] for free. Warners called the suit \"ludicrous\"<ref>{{Cite news |date=May 24, 2001 |title=Friedkin, Blatty sue studio over Exorcist reissue |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/may/24/news |access-date=September 30, 2022}}</ref> Later that year, they filed an additional suit in state court, alleging that Warners had further defrauded them by selling broadcast rights to [[CBS]] at a discount, by claiming itself as the sole author of the new version of the film when registering it with the [[United States Copyright Office|U.S. Copyright Office]] and by failing to honor an oral agreement with Friedkin to share the profits.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Shprintz |first=Janet |date=December 23, 2001 |title=Friedkin, Blatty sue WB over 'Exorcist' |url=https://variety.com/2001/biz/news/friedkin-blatty-sue-wb-over-exorcist-1117857722/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=September 30, 2022}}</ref>\n\nNine years later, Blatty brought suit against Warners again, asking for the opportunity to inspect the studio's records and accounts, to see whether the studio had properly paid him what it owed. He argued that his deal with the studio made him a co-owner of the film property and thus he had unique rights to access those records. \"[Warner Bros.] has asserted that Blatty must 'stand in line' with profit participants in [Warners'] other works who seek to audit [Warners],\" his complaint read, \"but who do not share Blatty's status as a co-owner.\"<ref name=\"2010 THR story\">{{Cite news |last=Belloni |first=Matt |date=December 21, 2010 |title='Exorcist' writer sues for access to Warner Bros. records |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/exorcist-writer-sues-access-warner-64236/ |access-date=September 30, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Copyright infringement claims===\n\nWithin a year of ''The Exorcist''{{'}}s release, two films were quickly made that appeared to appropriate elements of its plot or production design.

Federal judge [[David W.

He saw the story, in which Kinderman investigates a [[serial murder|string of murders]] that seem to have been committed by a possessed, resurrected Father Karras, as not so much a sequel to ''The Exorcist'' but an exploration of the same themes within the same fictional universe by some of the original's minor characters.

But Morgan Creek insisted on calling it ''The Exorcist III'' even though the story lacked any exorcism scenes (one was added after [[principal photography]], with [[Nicol Williamson]] cast in the role). Blatty directed, with [[George C. Scott]] taking over for the deceased [[Lee J. Cobb]] as Kinderman, [[Ed Flanders]] replacing O'Malley as Dyer and Miller returning as Karras or his double. [[Brad Dourif]] played the film's serial killer, and [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] the chief psychiatrist at the hospital where the film is mostly set.

Robinson, producer of ''Exorcist III'', had commissioned the development of a [[prequel]] story, one telling the story of a younger Father Merrin's first confrontation with the demon. As with the preceding three films in the franchise, making the film presented many problems once it was [[Green-light|greenlighted]] seven years later. Novelist [[Caleb Carr]] was hired to rewrite [[William Wisher Jr.]]'s original script, with [[John Frankenheimer]] set to direct and [[Liam Neeson]] to star as Merrin, but when cameras began rolling in late 2002 [[Paul Schrader]] was in the director's chair making his first horror film in two decades, now a [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] vehicle, as Frankenheimer had died and Neeson was no longer interested.

He and Schrader feuded for the rest of the year over how to edit it, until Robinson finally decided to hire [[Renny Harlin]] to reshoot most of the film with a new cast save Skarsg\u00e5rd. Shortly after beginning principal photography in [[Rome]], Harlin was struck by a car, breaking his leg severely enough to require surgery and stopping production for two weeks; he would finish the remaining six weeks on crutches. The cost of making both films combined to over $100 million.<ref name=\"LAT prequel story\" />\n[[File:Renny Harlin 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Renny Harlin, in 2017]]\nHarlin's version, heavy on action and horror, was released in August 2004 as ''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'', and failed with critics and at the box office. Blatty called watching it \"the most humiliating professional experience of my life\", blaming not Harlin but Morgan Creek. He had watched it with Schrader, who said its poor quality made it likely that the studio would try to save face by releasing his version, and returned to do the editing. It got a limited release in May 2005 as ''[[Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist]]'', a version Blatty found much more enjoyable.<ref name=\"NYT Dominion story\" />\n\nThe 2016 [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV series ''[[The Exorcist (TV series)|The Exorcist]]'' followed two priests investigating possible cases of demonic possession and performing exorcisms when necessary.
