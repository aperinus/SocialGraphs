The film stars [[Anthony Franciosa]] as American author Peter Neal, who \u2013 while in [[Rome]] promoting his latest murder-mystery novel \u2013 becomes embroiled in the search for a serial killer who may have been inspired to kill by his novel. [[John Saxon]] and [[Daria Nicolodi]] co-star as Neal's agent and assistant respectively, while [[Giuliano Gemma]] and Carola Stagnaro appear as detectives investigating the murders. [[John Steiner]], [[Veronica Lario]], and [[Mirella D'Angelo]] also feature in minor roles. The film has been described as exploring themes of [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]] and sexual aberration, and has strong [[metafiction]]al elements; some commentators consider ''Tenebrae'' to be a direct reaction by Argento to criticism of his previous work, most especially his depictions of murders of women.\n\nAfter Argento had experimented with pure supernatural horror with 1977's ''[[Suspiria]]'' and 1980's ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'', ''Tenebrae'' represented the filmmaker's return to the ''giallo'' horror subgenre, which he had helped popularize in the 1970s. Argento was inspired by a series of incidents which saw an obsessed fan telephone the director to criticize him for the damaging psychological effects of his previous work. The telephone calls culminated in death threats towards Argento, who channelled the experience into the writing of ''Tenebrae''. The director also wanted to explore the senselessness of killings he had seen and heard about while staying in Los Angeles in 1980, and his feeling at the time that true horror came from those who wanted \"to kill for nothing\".<ref name=\"jones\"/>\n\nShot on location in Rome and at Elios Studios, ''Tenebrae'' utilized mostly modern-looking locations and sets, allowing Argento to realize his vision that the film reflects a near-future with a diminished population; the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome. Employing director of photography [[Luciano Tovoli]], Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark, realistic lighting featured in television police shows at the time; production designer Giuseppe Bassan created supporting environments that were cold and austere, with sharp angles and modernistic spaces. Several former members of Italian rock band [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] provided ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s music, a synth-heavy score inspired by rock and disco music.\n\n''Tenebrae'' was a modest success in Italy; it reached theatres with little controversy after Argento made cuts to one of the most violent scenes. However, in the United Kingdom, it was added to the infamous list of \"[[video nasty|video nasties]]\" and banned from sale until 1999. The film's theatrical distribution in the United States was delayed until 1984 when it was released in a heavily censored version under the title '''''Unsane''''', which received a mostly negative critical reception. The original version later became widely available for reappraisal, and has come to be considered one of Argento's best films by many fans and critics.\n\n==Plot==\nPeter Neal, an American writer of violent horror novels, visits Italy to promote his latest work, ''Tenebrae''. He is accompanied by his literary agent, Bullmer and his assistant, Anne. Neal is unaware that he has also been followed to Rome by his embittered ex-fianc\u00e9e, Jane. Just before Neal arrived in Rome, Elsa, a young female shoplifter, was murdered with a razor by an unseen assailant. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal is soon contacted by the police in the form of Detective Germani and his partner, Inspector Altieri.\n\nMore killings take place. Tilde, a lesbian journalist, is murdered at her home along with her lover Marion. Maria, the young daughter of Neal's landlord, is later hacked to death with an axe after discovering the killer's lair. Neal notices that TV interviewer Cristiano Berti has an unusually intense interest in his work. That night, Neal and his Italian assistant Gianni go to watch Berti's house. Gianni approaches the house alone to get a better view and sees Berti get hacked to death with an axe. However, Gianni is unable to see the murderer's face, and returns to Neal, only to find the novelist has been knocked unconscious on the lawn.\n\nGermani discovers that Berti was obsessed with Neal's novels, and believes the killings will stop now that Berti is dead. However, Bullmer, who is having an affair with Jane, is stabbed to death while waiting for his lover in a public square. Gianni is haunted by the thought that he missed the importance of something he saw at Berti's house. He returns to the house and suddenly remembers that he had heard Berti confessing to his attacker: \"I killed them all, I killed them all!\" Before Gianni can share this detail with anyone, he is strangled to death from the back seat of his car.\n\nJane sits at her kitchen table with a pistol when a figure leaps through her window and hacks off one of her arms. The wound sprays blood over the kitchen walls before Jane falls to the floor. The killer continues to hack at her until she is dead, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving his murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated him when he was a youth in [[Rhode Island]]. The memory tormented Neal and inflamed his previously repressed lust for blood, driving him insane.\n\nInspector Altieri arrives at the house and Neal kills her. Germani and Anne arrive soon afterwards; surrounded, Neal sees that he cannot escape and seemingly slits his throat in front of them. Finding the telephone out of order, Germani and Anne go outside to report the incident from the car radio. Germani returns to the house where he gets murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits inside for Anne to return, but when she opens the door, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills Neal. The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain screaming repeatedly.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Anthony Franciosa]] as Peter Neal\n*[[John Saxon]] as Bullmer\n*[[Daria Nicolodi]] as Anne\n*[[Giuliano Gemma]] as Detective Germani\n*[[Christian Borromeo]] as Gianni\n*[[Mirella D'Angelo]] as Tilde\n*[[Veronica Lario]] as Jane McKerrow\n*[[Ania Pieroni]] as Elsa Manni\n*[[Eva Robins]] as Girl on Beach\n*Carola Stagnaro as Detective Altieri\n*[[John Steiner]] as Christiano Berti\n*[[Lara Wendel]] as Maria Alboretto\n*Mirella Banti as Marion\n\n==Analysis==\n\n===Influences===\nAccording to the film historian and critic [[Bill Warren (film historian and critic)|Bill Warren]], ''Tenebrae'' is a typical example of the ''giallo'' film genre: \"visually extremely stylish, with imaginative, sometimes stunning cinematography\", it presents \"mysterious, gruesome murders, often in picturesque locations; at the end, the identity of the murderer is disclosed in a scene destined to terrify and surprise.\"<ref name=\"avr\">{{cite web|url= http://www.avrev.com/dvd/revs/tenebrae.html|title=Tenebrae DVD Review|date=11 November 2005|access-date=22 April 2006|first=Bill|last=Warren|publisher=Audio Video Revolution|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111054714/http://www.avrev.com/dvd/revs/tenebrae.html|archive-date=11 November 2005}}</ref> These narrative and visual strategies had been introduced years before Argento made his first thriller, 1970's ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]]''&mdash;most critics point to [[Mario Bava]]'s ''[[La ragazza che sapeva troppo|The Girl Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1963) as the original ''giallo''.{{sfn|Olney|2013|p=9}}{{sfn|Schneider|2003|p=136}}\n\nBy the time Argento made ''Tenebrae'', he had become the acknowledged master of the genre, to the point where he felt confident enough to be openly self-referential to his own past, referencing the \"reckless driving humor\" from ''[[The Cat o' Nine Tails]]'' (1971) and the hero from ''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage''.<ref name=\"Lucas2\">{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Tim|title=Review of ''Tenebrae'' Laserdisc|journal=[[Video Watchdog]]|date=January 1999|issue=49|pages=68\u201372}}</ref> The scene in which [[Veronica Lario]]'s character, Jane, returns home directly references ''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage'' with its large sculpture in the entrance hallway.<ref name=\"c9\"/>\n\nWarren and Alan Jones cite a scene where a character is killed in a public square as evoking the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]];<ref name=\"c9\"/><ref name=\"avr\"/> Thomas Rostock agrees that the editing of the sequence is in a Hitchcockian vein, while the lighting is more influenced by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]].<ref name=\"r9\"/> The film critic and author [[Maitland McDonagh]] argues that Argento's influences for ''Tenebrae'' were far broader than just his own films or previous Italian thrillers. She refers to the strong narrative in the film as an example of \"the most paranoid excesses of ''[[film noir]]''.\" McDonagh suggests that [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956 film)|Beyond a Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1956) (\"in which a man convicted of murder on false evidence&nbsp;... is in fact guilty of the murder\") and [[Roy William Neill]]'s ''[[Black Angel (1946 film)|Black Angel]]'' (1946) (\"in which a man who tries to clear a murder suspect does so at the cost of learning that he himself is the killer\") both use such a similar plot twist to ''Tenebrae'' that Argento may have used them as partial models for his story.{{sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=164}}\n\n[[Kim Newman]] and [[Alan Jones (film critic)|Alan Jones]] suggest that the mysteries of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Rex Stout]], and [[Agatha Christie]] were all obvious influences on ''Tenebrae'', and there are many references to these authors throughout the film.<ref name=\"c2\"/> One example is the use of a quote from [[Sherlock Holmes]] in Conan Doyle's novel ''[[The Sign of the Four|The Sign of Four]]'' (1890): \"How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?\" A variation of this quote is delivered many times in ''Tenebrae''. Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]], the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' (1901\u20131902).<ref name=\"c6\"/> Neal is seen to be reading this novel in an early scene.<ref name=\"r2\"/> The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in that film.<ref name=\"r3\"/>\n\n===Themes===\nCritics have identified various major [[Theme (literature)|themes]] in ''Tenebrae''. In interviews conducted during the film's production, the usually somewhat reticent Argento offered his candid views on the thematic content of the film. As biographer Maitland McDonagh noted in ''Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento'', \"Argento has never been more articulate and/or analytical than he was on the subject of ''Tenebrae''.\"{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=162}} Film scholar William Hope considers the film to be devoid of classical narrative progression and states that the characters \"lack a narrative function or purpose, existing only to be killed in a spectacular fashion, their death hardly moving the narrative on at all. Traditional cause and effect are seemingly forgotten or actively ignored\".{{sfn|Hope|2005|p=119}} According to James Gracey, author of a book about Argento's work, with ''Tenebrae'' Argento \"explores some of his most reoccurring themes and preoccupations, such as [[Freudian psychology]], [[sexual deviancy]], repressed trauma, [[voyeurism]], audience spectatorship, and the fetishisation of violence and death.\"<ref name=\"quiet\">{{cite magazine|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/10531-tenebrae-dario-argento-30-years-on|last=Gracey|first=James|date=31 October 2012|title=30 Years On: ''Tenebrae'' Revisited|magazine=[[The Quietus]]|access-date=5 July 2015}}</ref> Water is often associated visually with Neal. In almost all his scenes his appearance is followed or accompanied by a shot of water.<ref name=\"r5\"/> Later, this device is used repeatedly as a clue to the ultimate killer's identity \u2013 Neal himself.<ref name=\"r12\"/>\n\n===Dark doubles===\n[[File:Giermani to Neal.ogv|thumb|275px|alt=Head-on to the camera, Detective Giermani stoops to pick up some evidence from the floor. Neal is revealed to be stood behind him, previously unseen with their silhouettes having perfectly matched in the shot|The reveal of Peter Neal standing behind Detective Giermani emphasizes Argento's theme of \"dark doubles\", with the film constantly doubling or mirroring objects, locations, events and characters.<ref name=\"r1\"/> This scene is one of many that sets up a character with his or her doppelg\u00e4nger, on both a visual and narrative level.<ref name=\"r3\"/> The moment is also one of ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s most stylistically influential; the reveal of a killer \u2013 previously silhouetted by another \u2013 has been copied and referenced in many subsequent thrillers,<ref name=\"c11\"/> including [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Raising Cain]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"brian\"/>]]\nAccording to Argento expert Thomas Rostock, ''Tenebrae'' is filled with rhyming imagery that relates to the film's exploration of \"the dual nature of [the] two active murderers\" using doubles, inversions, reflections and \"re-reflections\". Every major character has at least one double, and the theme extends to objects, locations, actions, and events \u2013 major and minor.<ref name=\"r1\"/> The doubling or mirroring of incidents and objects includes telephone booths, aircraft, homeless men, otherwise-meaningless public brawls in the background, car accidents, typewriters (literally side-by-side), keys, handkerchief, hands caught in doors and the characters themselves.<ref name=\"r10\">{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 10}}</ref> Rostock cites several scenes where characters are set up in the frame with their doppelg\u00e4ngers \u2013 one such is the first meeting of Peter Neal and Anne with Detectives Giermani and Altieri.<ref name=\"r3\"/> McDonagh notes that Argento emphasizes the doubling between Neal and Giermani: \"Giermani&nbsp;... is made to reflect Neal even as Neal appropriates his role as investigator&nbsp;... the detective/writer and the writer/detective each belittles his other half, as though by being demeaned this inverted reflection could be made to go away.\" McDonagh also observes that, in what is arguably the film's most potent shock, Neal at one point really does make Giermani \"go away\", virtually replacing him on screen \"in a shot that is as schematically logical as it is logically outrageous.\"{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=181}} Earlier, Neal killed a woman who \u2013 to his and the audience's surprise \u2013 was not Anne, but Altieri.<ref name=\"r1\"/> ''Tenebrae'' itself is split almost exactly into two parts. The first half belongs to the murders of Berti; the second to those of Neal. The two are set up as mirrors of one another. Berti's killings with a razor are clinical, with \"lingering sexualized aggressiveness\", whereas Neal's (with an axe) are crimes of passion committed for personal reasons or out of necessity; they are swift and to the point.<ref name=\"r2\"/>\n\nKevin Lyons observes, \"The plot revolves around the audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer (about whom we learn very little, itself unusual for Argento) to the eminently likeable hero, surely the film's boldest stroke.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eofftv.com/review/t/tenebre_review.htm |title=Tenebre Review |date=11 September 2003 |access-date=22 April 2006 |first=Kevin |last=Lyons |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Film and Television |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020060441/http://www.eofftv.com/review/t/tenebre_review.htm |archive-date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> While noting that the device is \"striking\", McDonagh comments that this transmission of guilt occurs between two dark doubles who are severely \"warped\" individuals. She suggests that \"Neal and Berti&nbsp;... act as mirrors to one another, each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other.\"{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=180}} Berti's obsession with Neal's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the writer, while Neal seems to think that his own violent acts are simply part of some kind of \"elaborate fiction\". When the bloody Neal is confronted by Giermani immediately after having killed numerous people, Neal screams at him, \"It was like a book&nbsp;... a book!\"{{Sfn|Gracey|2010|p=81}}\n\n===Metafiction===\nThe moment in which the first half of the movie transitions into the second is punctuated by the rising score and [[camera pan]] to an ostensibly meaningless point of reflected light on an ornament. According to Rostock, the meaning behind this movement is clear: it marks the spot when Berti's spree ends and Neal's rampage begins.<ref name=\"r7\"/> Argento uses the shift in focus to comment on the shaping of the film itself, until that moment a typical, \"clich\u00e9d and remote\" ''giallo''. Neal, previously passive, begins to control what happens in his own story, which is more personal with \"weight and meaning\". According to Rostock, this structure allows Argento equal scope to play with the narrative while commenting upon it, all without having to deviate from the advancement of the plot.<ref name=\"r8\">{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 8}}</ref> According to Kim Newman, the use of a sculpture as a weapon makes literal one of the themes of the film: \"art that kills people\".<ref name=\"c9\"/> Rostock concurs, saying that as the film is a commentary on art, the only weapon that can end the narrative is art itself.<ref name=\"r12\"/>\n\nAccording to Gracey, many have compared Argento with the character of Peter Neal, speculating that he serves as an alter-ego for the director.{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=78}} Gracey refers to ''Tenebrae'' as a \"reflexive commentary on [the director's] earlier work.\"{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=81}} The director himself saw the film in the same light, claiming it was a reaction to accusations that \"[he] was a misogynist&nbsp;... a criminal&nbsp;... a murderer.\" Argento resolved to include all these aspects of his previous films into ''Tenebrae''.<ref name=\"unsane\"/> A scene in which a woman criticizes the lead character's books as \"sexist\", featuring \"women as victims, cipers, male heroes [and] macho bullshit\" echoes criticisms of Argento's own work.<ref name=\"jones\"/> Kim Newman calls the confrontation scene \"essentially autobiographical\",<ref name=\"c3\"/> and refuting these accusations Argento said that his films were instead an attempt to tackle his dark side, to \"let it speak\". With ''Tenebrae'' in particular, he felt he was making a joke or playing a game with his critics, creating a front or mystique about himself.<ref name=\"unsane\"/> Rostock also believes Argento is having fun and sending up this perception.<ref name=\"r6\"/> Newman agrees that Argento used ''Tenebrae'' to address his own public image, the notion that someone who creates art as \"sick and twisted\" as his, must himself be sick and twisted. With ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s reveal that the author is the killer, Newman argues that Argento is saying, \"What if I were?\"<ref name=\"c9\">{{harvnb|Newman|Jones|2011|loc=chapter 9}}</ref>\n\n===\"Aberrant\" sexuality===\nAs in many of Argento's films, which allegedly tend to eroticize the murder of beautiful women,{{Sfn|Armstrong|Charity|Hughes|Winter|2007|page=25}} gender, sexuality, and power are major issues foregrounded by the film.{{sfn|Grant|2015|p=254}} The fictional novel within the film is described as being \"about human perversion and its effects on society\".{{sfn|Gallant|2000|p=184}} Male and female sexual deviancy is a central theme, with the victims being sexually liberated women who the first killer \u2013 conservative TV presenter Cristiano Berti \u2013 refers to as \"filthy, slimy perverts\".<ref name=\"quiet\"/> The first victim is a sexually promiscuous shoplifter, and his next two are the lesbian reporter and her bisexual lover. Berti murders the comparatively normal Maria only because she inadvertently discovers his twisted compulsion.{{sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=170}} His \"moral crusade\" is inspired by \u2013 and in his mind given credibility by \u2013 Neal's novel. Neal's own motivations for becoming a killer are revealed in \"Freudian flashbacks\". As summarized by McDonagh, these flashbacks \"expose how the misogyny evident in his books actually stems from being sexually humiliated by a beautiful woman in his youth.\"<ref name=\"quiet\"/> McDonagh also notes that ''Tenebrae'' expands on the themes of sexuality and [[transvestitism]] found in Argento's earlier films, ''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage'', ''The Cat o' Nine Tails'', ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' (1972), and ''[[Deep Red]]'' (1975), but believes that ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s \"overall sensuality sets it apart from Argento's other ''gialli''.\" She says that the film's sexual content and abundant nudity make it \"the first of Argento's films to have an overtly erotic aspect\", and further notes that \"''Tenebrae'' is fraught with free-floating anxiety that is specifically sexual in nature.\"{{sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=170}} Gracey notes that in several scenes the victims gaze directly into the camera, which demonstrates Argento's \"preoccupation with voyeurism and spectacle\".{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=82}}\n\nMcDonagh noted that two sexually charged flashbacks are key to understanding ''Tenebrae''. These distinct but strongly related memory fragments are introduced repeatedly throughout the film, usually immediately following a murder sequence. Although the flashbacks are never fully explained, the first one reveals a beautiful young woman's sexual humiliation of a teenage boy, presumed to be Peter Neal. The young woman is mostly topless during this first sequence, and she humiliates the young man by jamming the heel of one of her shiny red shoes into his mouth while he is held down by a group of gleeful boys on a pale-white beach. The second flashback shows the vicious revenge-murder of the woman some time later. McDonagh notes that all of the [[Fetishism|fetishistic]] imagery of these flashbacks, combined with the sadistic details of the murder sequences in the main narrative, \"set the parameters of ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s fetishistic and fetishicized<!-- sic? --> visual vocabulary, couched in terms both ritualistic and orgiastically out of control&nbsp;... Peter Neal indulges in sins of the flesh and ''Tenebrae'' revels in them, inviting the spectator to join in; in fact, it dares the viewer not to do so.\"{{sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=173}}\n\n===Vision impairment===\nThe protagonists in Argento's ''giallo'' films almost always suffer from vision impairment of some kind.<ref name=\"Flanagan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.contamination.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/articles/tenebrae.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526111931/http://www.contamination.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/articles/tenebrae.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-05-26|date=Winter 1999\u20132000|title=\"Aberrant\" Sexuality in Tenebrae|access-date=22 April 2006|first=Paul|last=Flanagan|publisher=Contamination Horror Index}}</ref> It is these characters' chronic inability to find the missing pieces of a puzzle. The puzzle being the solution of a murder (or series of murders) that generally provides much of the films' narrative thrust. Most obviously is the blind Franco Arno ([[Karl Malden]]) in ''The Cat o' Nine Tails'', who must use his heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied to him by his niece to solve a mystery. In ''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage'', Sam Dalmas ([[Tony Musante]]) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that something seems to be \"missing\"; as the film's surprise ending makes clear, he did not \"miss\" anything, but simply misinterpreted what happened in front of his eyes. In ''Deep Red'', Marcus ([[David Hemmings]]) has a similar problem in both seeing and ''not'' seeing the murderer at the scene of the crime, and does not realize his mistake until it is almost too late. This recurring theme, according to [[Douglas E. Winter]], creates \"a world of danger and deception, where seeing is not believing\".{{sfn|Golden|1992|pp=268\u2013288}}\n\nFlanagan observes that in ''Tenebrae'', Argento offers two characters who suffer from impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning to the scene of the crime, he suddenly remembers everything and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of [[Agatha Christie]], [[Mickey Spillane]], [[Rex Stout]], and [[Ed McBain]], but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet \u2013 he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.<ref name=\"Flanagan\"/>\n\n===An imaginary city===\nIn an interview that appeared in ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Argento noted that the film was intended as near-[[science fiction]], taking place \"about five or more years in the future&nbsp;... ''Tenebrae'' occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people with the result that the remainder are wealthier and less crowded. Something has happened to make it that way but no one remembers, or wants to remember&nbsp;... It isn't exactly my ''[[Blade Runner]]'', of course, but nevertheless a step into the world of tomorrow.

Seizing on the director's additional comment, \"...&nbsp;I dreamed an imaginary city in which the most amazing things happen\", she notes that the film's \"fictive space couldn't be less 'real'\", with its \"vast unpopulated boulevards, piazzas that look like nothing more than suburban American malls, hard-edged [[Bauhaus]] apartment buildings, anonymous clubs, and parking garages.\"{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=166}} The [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district of Rome, where much of ''Tenebrae'' was filmed, was built in preparation for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 World's Fair]] and intended by then-Prime Minister of Italy [[Benito Mussolini]] to be a celebration of twenty years of [[fascism]].

The first in the trilogy, ''[[Suspiria]]'' (1977), had turned the director into what Alan Jones called \"a horror superstar\", but ''Inferno'' had proven a difficult follow-up. Argento had become unwell while writing the film, and his ill health continued into filming. In addition, Argento's relationship with ''Inferno''{{'}}s co-producer [[20th Century Fox]] had soured the director on \"Hollywood politics\", so when ''Inferno'' was not well-received upon release, Argento put the ''Three Mothers'' trilogy on hold.<ref name=\"jones\">{{cite AV media|title=Dario Argento's ''Tenebrae'' |type=DVD booklet|last=Jones|first=Alan|publisher=[[Arrow Films]]|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> ''Inferno'' also flopped commercially.<ref name=\"c1\"/> According to James Gracey, Argento \u2013 under pressure and feeling \"the need to once again defy expectations\" \u2013 returned to the ''giallo'' genre and began work on ''Tenebrae''.{{sfn|Gracey|2010|pp=77\u201378}} Argento later stated that he wanted to \"put on film a gory roller-coaster ride packed with fast and furious murders\" and that he \"shouldn't resist what [his] hardcore audience wanted\".<ref name=\"jones\" /> He added that he had also become irritated that in the years since his last ''giallo'' so many other directors had made films derivative of his own genre-defining works.<ref name=\"unsane\" />\n\nArgento said that ''Tenebrae'' was directly influenced by two distressing incidents that occurred in 1980.<ref name=\"jones\"/> On a break from filmmaking after ''Suspiria''{{'}}s surprise success, Argento was spending time in Los Angeles, where an obsessed fan telephoned him repeatedly,{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=78}} to talk about ''Suspiria''{{'}}s influence on him.<ref name=\"r5\"/> According to Argento, the calls began pleasantly enough but before long became more insistent, eventually menacing.<ref name=\"unsane\">{{cite AV media | people=Waddell, Calum (Director) | date=2011 | title=The Unsane World of ''Tenebrae'': An Interview with Dario Argento | medium=Documentary | publisher=Arrow Films}}</ref> The fan claimed that he wanted \"to harm Argento in a way that reflected how much the director's work had affected him\",{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=78}} and that because the director had \"ruined his life\", he in turn wanted to ruin Argento's.<ref name=\"unsane\"/> Although no violence came of the threat, Argento said he found the experience understandably terrifying and felt unable to write.{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=157}} At the advice of his producers, Argento fled to the coastal city of Santa Monica, where he felt safe enough to resume writing. However, after a few weeks, the fan found Argento and resumed his calls, issuing more threats. The director decided to return to Italy.<ref name=\"unsane\"/> Argento felt the escalating nature of the fan's threats were \"symptomatic of that city of broken dreams\" with its \"celebrity stalkers and senseless crime\". The second incident occurred during Argento's stay at [[The Beverly Hilton]], where a Japanese tourist was shot dead in the hotel lobby. Later hearing of a drive-by shooting outside a local cinema, Argento reflected on the senselessness of the killings: \"To kill for nothing, that is the true horror of today&nbsp;... when that gesture has no meaning whatsoever it's completely repugnant, and that's the sort of atmosphere I wanted to put across in ''Tenebrae''.\"<ref name=\"jones\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nArgento reportedly offered the lead role of Peter Neal to [[Christopher Walken]], but eventually, it went to [[Anthony Franciosa]].<ref name=\"jones\"/> Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as he was capable of bringing more to the role than the script asked of him.

She said the role required little energy or imagination, but liked the novelty of playing neither killer nor victim.<ref name=\"scream\"/> Newman and Alan Jones agreed that Nicolodi had very little character to play, as written.

The director intended that the film be set in the near future and wanted the lighting to help create a \"cold, stark and semi-futuristic look\".{{sfn|Gracey|2010|p=79}} Argento explained that this approach was also an attempt to imitate what he saw as the \"realistic manner of lighting\" used in television police shows. The director explained that he was adopting \"a modern style of photography, deliberately breaking with the legacy of [[German Expressionism]]. Today's light is the light of neon, headlights, and omnipresent flashes&nbsp;... Caring about shadows seemed ridiculous to me and, more than that, reassuring.\"{{Sfn|McDonagh|1994|p=167}} Argento filmed half-empty streets and shops where he could, in an attempt to reflect a futuristic setting where a disaster had diminished significantly the population of his imaginary city.<ref name=\"unsane\"/> Tovoli used [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] 5247 film stock (125 [[Film speed#ASA|ASA]] speed rating) for daylight scenes, and Kodak 5293 (250 ASA) for night shoots. Tovoli rated both at 300 ASA to ensure controlled [[Exposure (photography)|overexposure]] of the negative during filming, for the benefit of under-developing in the lab and less colour loss.

One example he gave was the scene where his character bends to pick up some evidence from the floor, only to reveal Neal behind him having perfectly matched his position relative to the camera. This moment was not scripted but resulted from Argento's noticing the actors' similar build while they were stood, one behind the other in front of him.<ref name=\"r12\">{{harvnb|Rostock|2011|loc=chapter 12}}</ref>\n\n====Crane shot====\n{{Quote box|quote=\"The crane shot&nbsp;... should be one of the most memorable moments in cinema&nbsp;...

To introduce the scene, Argento and Tovoli employed the use of a [[Crane shot|Louma crane]] to film a several minutes-long [[tracking shot]].

According to McAllister, ''Tenebrae''{{'}}s distributor begged Argento to cut the shot down because it was \"meaningless\".<ref name=\"ironwolfe\"/> Newman and Jones agreed that the shot added nothing to the film's plot, but called it \"meaninglessly brilliant\".<ref name=\"c4\"/>\n\n===Title===\nSome European publicity materials for the film, including posters and lobby card sets, advertised the film as ''Tenebre'', and the 1999 Anchor Bay DVD release uses that same title.<ref name=\"Felix\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/33592/tenebre/|title=Tenebrae|last=Felix |first=Justin|date=27 May 2008|access-date = 26 April 2011|publisher=DVD Talk}}</ref> However, on the print itself, during the opening credits, the title is clearly ''Tenebrae''.

The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music, and he decided on a more electronic sound for ''Tenebrae''. Simonetti described the score as an [[electronica]]/rock hybrid, with the main theme including disco elements. So it would not be difficult to accommodate Argento's preference for long takes, Simonetti, Pignatelli and Morante made sure to play each song for 3\u20134 minutes.<ref name=\"goblin\"/> Recording the score, Simonetti used the [[Roland Jupiter-8]], Roland [[Vocoder]] Plus and [[Minimoog]] synthesizers, as well as a piano, electric piano, the [[Oberheim DMX]] drum machine, the [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine, and [[Roland MC-4 Microcomposer|Roland MC-4]] music sequencer.
