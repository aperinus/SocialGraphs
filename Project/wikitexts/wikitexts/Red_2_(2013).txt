It was based on the limited [[Red (WildStorm)|comic book series of the same name]], created by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Cully Hamner]], and published by the [[DC Comics]] imprint [[Homage Comics|Homage]]. The film stars [[Bruce Willis]], [[John Malkovich]], [[Mary-Louise Parker]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Lee Byung-hun]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], and [[Helen Mirren]], with [[Dean Parisot]] directing a [[screenplay]] by Jon and Erich Hoeber. ''Red 2'' was released on July 19, 2013.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->Three years after the events of the previous film, ex-CIA operative Frank Moses tries to lead a normal life with girlfriend Sarah Ross. He dismisses Marvin Boggs\u2019 claims that enemies are still after them; Marvin drives off and his car explodes. Although Frank is unconvinced Marvin is dead, Sarah convinces him to attend Marvin's funeral where he delivers a tearful eulogy. Government agents interrogate Frank at an [[FBI]] [[Yankee White]] facility. Corrupt agent Jack Horton and a team of [[private military contractors]] ambush the facility; he threatens to torture Sarah until Frank gives him the information he needs. Frank evades Horton, and with the help of the still living Marvin, goes on the run with Sarah.\n\nMarvin explains he and Frank have been targeted as members of Operation Nightshade, a clandestine operation during the Cold War to smuggle a nuclear weapon into Russia. Horton convinces international agencies that Frank and his associates are terrorists on the run. Frank\u2019s old ally Victoria notifies him that she has been contracted by [[MI6]] to kill the fugitives. Another top contract killer, Han Cho-Bai, is also hired, seeking revenge against Frank.\nFrank, Marvin, and Sarah steal Han's plane and fly to Paris to find \"The Frog\", with the Americans and Han in pursuit. They are met by Katja Petrokovich, a Russian secret agent with whom Frank had a relationship, who is also investigating Nightshade. They interrogate the Frog and Sarah, hoping to one-up Katja, seduces him.\n\nThe Frog gives them the key to his security box, which Katja takes after drugging Frank; Marvin, anticipating her double-cross, provided Frank with a similar key to give her. Marvin, Frank, and Sarah search the box themselves and find documents pointing to physicist Dr. Edward Bailey as the creator of the Nightshade bomb. They discover Bailey is alive, held for thirty-two years in a [[Supermax prison|maximum security]] asylum for the criminally insane in London. Victoria, alerted by Marvin, ambushes the trio, but helps fake their deaths and infiltrate the asylum. They find the hyperactive Bailey, incapacitated by mind-fogging drugs, and bring him to Marvin\u2019s safehouse, where Bailey remembers the location of the bomb.\n\nIn Moscow, Bailey concludes he hid the bomb in the Kremlin. There, the team locates the suitcase bomb, powered by [[red mercury]]. Katja stops them, but Frank persuades her to join their mission. They escape, but a call from Victoria, who has broken out of MI6 confinement for failing to kill him, reveals that Bailey was imprisoned because he wanted to detonate the bomb. Holding Frank at gunpoint, Bailey confirms Victoria's message, admitting he made a deal to give Horton the bomb. He fatally shoots Katja, frames Frank, and leaves with the bomb. Horton reneges on their deal, intending to torture Bailey for all his secrets, but Bailey deploys a nerve gas and escapes to the Iranian embassy in London. In pursuit, Frank is attacked by Han. Reaching a standoff, Frank urges Han to join him in stopping Bailey; Han relents, and the five enact a plan to recapture the bomb.\n\nSarah seduces the Iranian ambassador and takes him hostage. Marvin poses as a potential defector, causing a diversion in the embassy that allows the team to enter disguised as plumbers. They learn the bomb\u2019s location, but Bailey has already triggered the timer and killed Horton. Bailey takes Sarah hostage and flees to Han\u2019s plane to escape the imminent explosion. Frank, Marvin, Victoria, and Han give chase, but Marvin\u2019s attempts to disarm the suitcase bomb cause the timer to count down even faster. Frank boards the plane and confronts Bailey with the suitcase; he forces Frank to leave with Sarah and the suitcase. They rejoin the others and wait for the suitcase to detonate as the plane takes off \u2013 high in the sky, it explodes. Frank reveals that he hid the bomb aboard the plane and confronted Bailey with the empty case. Han angrily demands $30 million for his plane and $20 million for not killing Frank.\n\nThe film ends as Sarah enjoys herself on a mission in Caracas with Frank and Marvin.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Frank Moses\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Marvin Boggs\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Victoria Winslow\n* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Sarah Ross\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Dr. Edward Bailey \n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Major General Katja Petrokovich\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Ivan Simanov\n* [[Lee Byung-hun|Byung-hun Lee]] as Han Cho Bai, an assassin and former [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|NIS]] agent\n* [[David Thewlis]] as The Frog\n* [[Neal McDonough]] as Jack Horton, a corrupt US intelligence agent\n* [[Garrick Hagon]] as Davis, a high ranking corrupt member of the [[US Intelligence Community]]\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Philips, [[Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service]]\n* [[Philip Arditti]] as Arman, the [[List of Iranian Ambassadors to the United Kingdom|Iranian Ambassador to the United Kingdom]]\n* Jong Kun Lee as Han's father\n* Mitchell Mullen as Wade\n* Martin Sims as Blackwell\n* Tristan D.
