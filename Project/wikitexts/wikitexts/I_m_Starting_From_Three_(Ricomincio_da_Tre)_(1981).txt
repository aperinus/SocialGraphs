There he meets a beautiful girl, Marta, and they fall in love. Gaetano sets at Marta's and is later joined by his old friend Lello, a clumsy and rotund boy, albeit very funny in his friendship with the protagonist.\n\nOne night at Marta's, while reading a manuscript, Marta reveals to be pregnant, and she's not sure that Gaetano is the child's father: Marta had a relationship with a teenager boy, and she sincerely tells the whole story to Gaetano, that gets sad and embittered, and goes back to Naples, officially for his sister's wedding, actually to clear his mind about the facts. There he discovers himself very in love with Marta and rejoins her back in Florence, accepting her child even if he's not sure of being the natural father.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Massimo Troisi]]: Gaetano\n* [[Fiorenza Marchegiani]]: Marta\n* [[Lello Arena]]: Lello\n* [[Marco Messeri]]: The Madman \n* [[Lino Troisi]]: Ugo, Gaetano's father  \n* [[Renato Scarpa]]: Robertino \n* [[Jeanne Mas]]: Jeanne\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0081427}}\n\n{{Massimo Troisi}}\n\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:Commedia all'italiana]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Massimo Troisi]]\n[[Category:Italian comedy films]]\n[[Category:1981 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1981 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
