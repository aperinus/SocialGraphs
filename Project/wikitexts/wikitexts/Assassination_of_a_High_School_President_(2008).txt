Although Funke claims he is a great writer, he has never finished an article for his school newspaper. Editor-in-chief Clara Diaz assigns Funke to do an article on Paul Moore, the student council president and star of the school's basketball team. Funke is unable to get a story out of Paul and is bullied by Paul's friends.\n\nPrincipal Kirkpatrick discovers that the upcoming [[SAT]] booklets have been stolen from a safe in his office. Kirkpatrick rounds up the \"usual suspects\" of misfits, including Funke. The group is innocent, but Kirkpatrick warns them to watch their step.\n\nWhen senior Francesca Facchini solicits Funke's help tracking down the stolen SATs, Funke slowly uncovers a story. His investigation links Paul to the crime, which he writes in an article for the school paper. Kirkpatrick forces Paul to open his locker and the SATs fall out.\n\nFunke becomes one of the most popular kids at school. Clara decides to submit his article to Northwestern, which earns him a scholarship to the summer program. Funke wins the respect of everyone, from Principal Kirkpatrick to Francesca, who asks him to a school dance.\n\nPaul confronts Funke, proclaiming his innocence, stating that he was already accepted to [[Cornell]] on a sports scholarship and did not need the SATs. Funke begins to wonder if he is just a pawn in a conspiracy, and he investigates Paul's shady friends, all members of the student council. He discovers their involvement with drug dealing. The council had actually stolen the SATs along with other tests throughout the year, modifying the marks of the best students to make them doubt their test-taking abilities and turn to the council for \"[[Amphetamine|study drugs]]\". Paul was not in on the crime, so group ringleader Marlon Piazza had Paul framed to avoid being caught, while Marlon's step-sibling and sex partner, Francesca, led Funke along to keep him from finding out the truth.\n\nFunke confronts the council in the principal's office. Marlon threatens to have Funke thrown out the window and frame it as a suicide, but his threat and confession are heard on the school's intercom system, which Bobby had secretly activated. Kirkpatrick rushes into the office, followed by Francesca. Francesca attempts to gain Funke's trust, only to be shut down and left to her punishment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Reece Thompson]] as Robert \"Bobby\" Funke (pronounced as Funk by himself, and Funky by the rest of the school)\n*[[Mischa Barton]] as Francesca Fachini\n*[[Bruce Willis]] as Principal Jared T.

Calpin attended [[Scranton Preparatory School]] in Scranton, Pennsylvania, while Jakubowski attended [[Fenwick High School (Oak Park, Illinois)|Fenwick High School]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]. The look of the school and style of dress were drawn from these high schools. The school mascot (Friar) and the school emblem (cross of the Dominican Order) was derived from Fenwick. The movie was shot on location at [[Bayonne High School]] in [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]], [[New Jersey]].<ref>Sullivan, Al. \"Movie stars seen around Hudson County\" ''[[The Union City Reporter]]''; September 23, 2007; Page 8</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was scheduled for a February 17 limited theatrical release, followed by a wide release on March 27. The release date was not met as its distributor [[Yari Film Group]]'s releasing division filed for bankruptcy. This attracted a response in the media urging a theatrical release, and to avoid a [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] release by [[Sony]], who own the home video distribution rights. Several journalists advised that the film should at least receive a limited theatrical release, and encouraged fans to support the film on social networking sites such as [[Facebook]].<ref>[http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/03/12/is-assassination-of-a-high-school-president-going-direct-to-dvd/ Help Save Assassination of a High School President From Going Direct To DVD] Slash. 12 March 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/news/activism-brilliant-high-school-assassination-foiled-by-studio-collapse.php Activism: Brilliant High School \u2018Assassination\u2019 Foiled by Studio Collapse, Needs Our Help] Film School Rejects. 13 March 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.aintitcool.com/node/40414 Is ASSASSINATION OF A HIGH SCHOOL PRESIDENT getting shafted?
