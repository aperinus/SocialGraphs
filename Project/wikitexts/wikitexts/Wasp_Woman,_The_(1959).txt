Filmed in [[black-and-white]], it stars [[Susan Cabot]], [[Anthony Eisley]], [[Michael Mark (actor)|Michael Mark]], and [[Barboura Morris]]. The film was originally released by [[Filmgroup]] as a [[double feature]] with ''[[Beast from Haunted Cave]]''.<ref>http://www.goldenageofscifi.info/1959/wasp_woman.html</ref><ref>December 24, 1959 issue of ''The Plain Speaker'' from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, Page 37</ref> To pad out the film's running time when it was released to television two years later, a new prologue was added by director [[Jack Hill]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn Hill's prologue, a scientist, Dr. Eric Zinthrop ([[Michael Mark (actor)|Michael Mark]]), is fired from his job at a honey farm for experimenting with wasps.\n\nThe founder and owner of a large [[cosmetics]] company, Janice Starlin ([[Susan Cabot]]), is disturbed when her firm's sales begin to drop after it becomes apparent to her customer base that she is aging. Zinthrop has been able to extract enzymes from the [[royal jelly]] of the [[queen (insect)|queen]] [[wasp]] that can reverse the aging process. Janice agrees to fund further research, at great cost, provided she can serve as his human subject. Displeased with the slowness of the results, she breaks into the scientist's laboratory after hours and injects herself with extra doses of the formula. Zinthrop becomes aware that some of the test creatures are becoming violent and goes to warn Janice, but before he can reach anyone, he gets into a car accident. He is thus temporarily missing and Janice goes through great trouble to find him, eventually taking over his care.\n\nJanice continues her clandestine use of the serum and sheds 20 years in a single weekend, but soon discovers that she is periodically transformed into a murderous, wasp-like creature. Eventually, Zinthrop throws a jar of [[carbolic acid]] at her face, and another character, using a chair, pushes her out of a high window, and falls to her death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Susan Cabot]] as Janice Starlin\n* [[Anthony Eisley|Fred Eisley]] as Bill Lane\n* [[Barboura Morris]] as Mary Dennison\n* [[William Roerick]] as Arthur Cooper\n* [[Michael Mark (actor)|Michael Mark]] as Dr. Eric Zinthrop\n* [[Frank Gerstle]] as Les Hellman\n* [[Bruno VeSota]] as Night Watchman\n* Roy Gordon as Paul Thompson\n* Carolyn Hughes as Jean Carson\n* [[Lynn Cartwright]] as Maureen Reardon\n* [[Frank Wolff (actor)|Frank Wolff]] as Delivery Man\n* Lani Mars as Secretary\n* Philip Barry as Delivery Man\n* [[Roger Corman]] as Hospital Doctor (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:SusanCabotinWaspWoman1960 PDUS.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Susan Cabot as the Wasp Woman]] \nIt was originally known as ''Insect Woman''.\n\nThe Wasp Woman has the head and hands of a wasp but the body of a woman\u2014exactly the opposite of the creature shown on the film's theatrical release poster (which does not appear in the film).\n\nThe film was made for an estimate budget of $50,000.<ref>Alan Frank, ''The Films of Alan Frank: Shooting My Way Out of Trouble'', Bath Press, 1998 p 65</ref>\n\nIn 1962,<ref name=waddell-p11>{{cite book| first=Calum | last=Waddell | title=Jack Hill: The Exploitation and Blaxploitation Master, Film by Film| url=https://archive.org/details/jackhillexploita00wadd| url-access=limited| publisher= [[McFarland & Company]] | year = 2009 | isbn=  978-0786436095 | page =[https://archive.org/details/jackhillexploita00wadd/page/n19 11]}}</ref> director Hill added 11 minutes to the film for its eventual [[television syndication]] release.<ref name=seattletimes>{{cite news | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960620&slug=2335436 | title=Not Yet Over The Hill -- Director of Campy 'Sisters' in Comeback| first= John | last= Hartl | work=[[The Seattle Times]] | date=June 20, 1996 | access-date=November 1, 2014 | archive-date= November 1, 2014| url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141101154926/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960620&slug=2335436}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was the third released by Filmgroup.
