[[Aidan Quinn]] also stars, and it was directed by [[Jeremiah S. Chechik]].\n\nThe film is perhaps best known for Depp's humorous [[physical comedy]] routines (which are based on [[silent film]] comics [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Harold Lloyd]]) and for popularizing, in the United States, the song \"[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)]]\" by [[The Proclaimers]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://toponehitwonders.com/pop/im-gonna-be-500-miles-the-proclaimers/ |title=I'm Gonna be (500 Miles) - the Proclaimers &#124; |access-date=2015-04-04 |archive-date=2017-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329030250/http://toponehitwonders.com/pop/im-gonna-be-500-miles-the-proclaimers/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Benny & Joon'' was shot primarily on location in [[Spokane, Washington]], while the train scenes at the beginning were shot near [[Metaline Falls]], Washington.\n\n==Plot==\nBenjamin \"Benny\" Pearl and his mentally ill sister Juniper \"Joon\" Pearl live together following the accidental death of their parents. Joon joins a poker game at the house belonging to a friend of Benny's named Mike, and loses a bet that commits Mike's eccentric cousin Sam to live with the Pearls. Benny is initially angry, but after an evening with Sam at the local diner and then coming home the next day to find Sam has cleaned the house, Benny decides Sam should stay.\n\nJoon aids Sam (who is illiterate) when he is struggling with writing to his mother, and the two go to the local diner where Ruthie is working. She takes them on an errand, and then takes them home. After Ruthie stays for dinner, her car won't start, and Benny drives her home, where they set a dinner date. Meanwhile, left alone, Joon and Sam kiss. Benny and Ruthie have a fun date, but Benny abruptly ends it because he wants to get home to Joon. Sam goes to a video store to try to apply for a job there. Benny, Joon, and Sam go to a park, where Sam starts doing tricks with his hat, attracting an appreciative crowd. Benny stays at the park to reflect and sends Joon home with Sam, where they make love. Sam then tells Joon he loves her, which Joon reciprocates.\n\nWhen Benny makes suggestions to Sam about his comedy routines, Joon becomes agitated and makes Sam explain that he and Joon are romantically involved. An angry Benny throws Sam out, yells at Joon, and shows her a pamphlet about a group home that would be a better home for her. Joon starts hitting Benny and screaming, and he pushes her away. Feeling bad, Benny leaves to get her some pudding. While Benny is away, Sam arrives. They pack suitcases and get on a bus, but Joon soon begins to hear voices in her head and argues with them, in great distress. Sam tries to soothe her, but she becomes more agitated. The bus is stopped, and two paramedics restrain Joon. When Benny arrives at the hospital, the doctor tells him Joon does not want to see him. He finds Sam in the waiting room, and they argue. Sam goes to stay with Ruthie. Meanwhile, Benny begins to feel guilty about his treatment of Joon.\n\nBenny finds Sam, now working at the video store, and asks for his help. They go to the hospital. Benny apologizes to Joon, persuades her to consider getting her own apartment, and tells her that Sam has come back for her. Joon tells the doctor that she would like to try living in her own apartment. The siblings reconcile and Sam and Joon are reunited. Later, Benny brings roses to Ruthie. He takes another bouquet to Joon's apartment but leaves the flowers in the doorway when he sees Sam and Joon are busy making grilled cheese sandwiches with a clothing iron.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Sam\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Juniper \"Joon\" Pearl\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Benjamin \"Benny\" Pearl\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Ruthie\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Eric\n* [[C.C.H.

But ''Benny and Joon'' succeeds in remaining blithe and sunny, directed by Jeremiah Chechik (''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'') with a commercial liveliness and a suitable sense of the absurd. The film's greatest asset is the obvious conviction of its actors, who never condescend to their roles. Mr. Depp may look nothing like Buster Keaton, but there are times when he genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face, bringing Keaton's mannerisms sweetly and magically to life. As Mr. Depp and the rest of the film makers surely must have known, an impersonation like that is an all-or-nothing proposition. Ms. Masterson, a remarkably incisive and determined actress, never sentimentalizes Joon despite many ripe opportunities to do exactly that. She remains fierce, funny and persuasive even when the film conveniently soft-pedals the reality of Joon's situation. Mr. Quinn, often in the position of playing straight man to the other two leads, still makes Benny a touchingly sincere and sympathetic figure.}}\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Benny & Joon'' holds an approval rating of 76% based on 41 reviews, with an average score of 5.80/10.<ref>{{cite web | title=Benny & Joon | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/benny_and_joon| website=Rotten Tomatoes | publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=September 11, 2020 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 57 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Benny & Joon |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/benny-joon |website=[[Metacritic]] }}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title=BENNY AND JOON (1993) |work= [[CinemaScore]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nIn spite of its \"commercially improbable story\", the film became a [[sleeper hit]], evidence of the resurgence of date movies \"after a decade dominated by [[action film]] and [[horror film]]s.\"<ref name=\"ew930507\">{{cite magazine| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306282,00.html | title=A Perfect Mismatch | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | author-link=Ryan Murphy (writer) | first=Ryan |last= Murphy | date=May 7, 1993| quote=After a decade dominated by action films, the sleeper success of ''Benny & Joon'' \u2014 an oddball romance starring Masterson and Depp as seemingly ill-matched lovers who find each other a perfect fit \u2014 is the latest evidence that movies made for couples are finding their niche once again. | access-date=2011-09-29}}</ref> In the first two weeks of a [[limited release]], ''Benny & Joon'' grossed $8 million.
