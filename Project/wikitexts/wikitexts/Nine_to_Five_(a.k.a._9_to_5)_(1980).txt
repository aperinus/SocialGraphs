Both work under the egotistical, sexist Vice President Franklin Hart, whom Violet once trained and who spreads the false rumor that he and his attractive married secretary, Doralee Rhodes, are having an affair.\n\nWhen Hart turns down Violet for a promotion, Violet reveals to Doralee the rumor about the affair, leading both women to take the afternoon off drinking at a local bar. Judy joins them after learning of the dismissal of a friendly co-worker.\n\nUnable to think of a way to improve their situation, they spend the evening smoking [[marijuana]] at Doralee's house and fantasizing about how they would get revenge on Hart: Judy would shoot him like a hunter does a deer, Doralee would [[hog tie]] him and roast him over a slow fire, while Violet would poison his coffee.\n\nThe next day, a frustrated Violet accidentally puts rat poison in Hart's coffee, but before he can drink it, his desk chair malfunctions and he blacks out after hitting his head on a [[credenza]]. Violet realizes her mistake and thinks the poisoned coffee caused Hart to black out. She and Judy meet Doralee at the hospital just in time to overhear a doctor pronounce a man dead from poisoning.\n\nThinking the dead man is Hart, Violet steals the body to prevent the performing of an autopsy, but while arguing with Judy and Doralee, she crashes her car, damaging a [[Fender (vehicle)|fender]]. When Doralee retrieves a tire iron from the trunk to fix the fender, she discovers the body is not Hart and they return it to the hospital.\n\nThe next morning, Hart shocks the women when he arrives for work as usual. In the ladies room, Doralee explains that Hart hit his head, but did not drink the coffee. Relieved that nothing will come out of the night's events, the ladies agree to meet for happy hour at the end of the day. However, Hart's loyal administrative assistant, Roz, overhears their conversation and reports everything back to Hart.\n\nHart summons Doralee to his office and offers her a choice: if she spends the night with him, he will not report her, Judy, and Violet for attempted murder. Doralee refuses and when Hart refuses to hear her out, she ties him up and stuffs a scarf he had given her as a gift in his mouth to keep him quiet. Hart eventually gets loose, which leads Judy to shoot at him with Doralee's handgun.\n\nUltimately, the women discover Hart has been selling Consolidated inventory and pocketing the proceeds, so they blackmail him into keeping quiet. When they are told that invoices Violet ordered that should prove Hart's crimes will not arrive for 4\u20136 weeks, they confine Hart to his bedroom wearing a hang gliding suit tied to a remote controlled garage door opener.\n\nWhile Hart is out of the office, they implement several programs that are popular with the workers, including an in-office day care center, equal pay for men and women, flexible hours, and a job sharing program where employees can work part time.\n\nDays before the invoices arrive, Hart's adoring wife returns from a cruise and frees him, giving him the time to buy back the inventory he sold. Before Hart can report Judy, Doralee, and Violet to the police, the chairman of the board, Russell Tinsworthy, arrives to meet with Hart. He congratulates him on his improvements to the office which have resulted in a 20% increase in productivity. As a result, he invites Hart to join him on a multiyear project in Brazil and Hart reluctantly is forced to accept.\n\nViolet, Judy, and Doralee celebrate their success. Violet is eventually promoted to vice president, Judy leaves Consolidated to marry the Xerox representative, and Doralee also leaves to become a [[Country music|country western]] singer. Hart is kidnapped by a tribe of [[Amazons]] and is never heard from again.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, highlighted \"And\" Hayden after the lead four per closing credits scroll, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jane Fonda]] as Judy Bernly, a new employee for whom Consolidated is her first job after being a housewife.

A very old friend of mine had started an organization in Boston called \"Nine To Five\", which was an association of women office workers. I heard them talking about their work and they had some great stories. And I've always been attracted to those 1940s films with three female stars.<ref name=\"fonda\"/></blockquote>\nFonda said the film was at first going to be a drama, but \"any way we did it, it seemed too preachy, too much of a feminist line.

They call themselves \"office wives\". They have to put gas in the boss's car, get his coffee, buy the presents for his wife and mistress. So when we came to do the film, we said to Colin [Higgins], OK, what you have to do is write a screenplay which shows you can run an office without a boss, but you can't run an office without the secretaries!<ref name=\"fonda\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Filming locations==\nThe home of Franklin Hart is located at 10431 Bellagio Road in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nine To Five |url=https://www.itsfilmedthere.com/2013/03/nine-to-five.html |access-date=2022-07-30 |website=itsfilmedthere.com |language=en}}</ref> According to commentary included in the DVD release of the film, the home was, at the time, owned by the Chandler family, publishers of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref>20th Century Studios DVD release, ''9 to 5 (Sexist, Egotistical, Lying Hypocritical Bigot Edition - Widescreen'') ([[Audio commentary]]). 4 April 2006.</ref> The Consolidated offices were presumably in the Pacific Financial Center located at 800 W 6th Street, at South Flower Street in Los Angeles.

She wrote the song on set by clicking her nails together and forming the beat. The song went to number one for two weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as the U.S. country singles charts, and was nominated for several awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].
