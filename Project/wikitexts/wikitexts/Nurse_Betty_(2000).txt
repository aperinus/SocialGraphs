She has no idea that her husband Del, a car salesman, is having a sexual affair with another woman. She also doesn't know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs. When Betty calls to ask about borrowing a [[Buick LeSabre]] for her birthday, Del tells her to take a different car. She manages to sneak the car for herself, anyway, although unbeknownst to her, a large stash of drugs are hidden in the LeSabre's trunk. Two [[hitman|hitmen]], Charlie and Wesley, come to Betty and Del's house. Charlie threatens to [[scalping|scalp]] Del if he doesn't reveal where the drugs are, and Del reveals that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of the LeSabre; afterwards, Wesley still scalps Del after misunderstanding Charlie's silent communication. Betty witnesses the murder and enters a [[fugue state]], assuming the identity of a character in ''A Reason to Love'' who is a nurse.\n\nThat evening, Sheriff Eldon Ballard, local reporter Roy Ostery, and several policemen examine the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase. She seems oblivious to the murder, even with the investigation going on right in her house. At the police station, a psychiatrist examines her. Betty spends the night at her friend's house, sleeping in a child's bedroom. In the middle of the night, she gets into the LeSabre and drives off. She stops at a bar in [[Williams, Arizona|Williams]], [[Arizona]], where the bartender talks about her vacation in [[Rome]]; Betty tells her that she was once engaged to a famous surgeon (describing the lead character from ''A Reason to Love''). Meanwhile, the two hitmen are in pursuit, having realized that Betty has the car with the drugs. As they search, Charlie's heart begins to soften towards Betty, to Wesley's consternation.\n\nIn [[Los Angeles]], Betty tries to get a job as a nurse while looking for her long-lost \"ex-fianc\u00e9\". She is turned down because she has no r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or references, but when she saves a young shooting victim's life with a technique she learned from the show, the hospital offers her a job in the pharmacy but forbids her to touch any more patients. Despite her position, Betty becomes popular with patients and their families. She ends up living with Rosa, the older sister of the young man she helped earlier, in gratitude for saving his life. Rosa is also a legal secretary and offers to help Betty find her surgeon boyfriend. She learns from a colleague that \"David\" is a soap opera character, and goes to the pharmacy window to confront Betty. Thinking her friend is jealous, Betty is impervious to the revelation.\n\nBetty's lawyer supplies tickets to a charity function where George McCord, the actor portraying David, will be appearing. Betty meets George at the function. George is inclined to dismiss her as an overimaginative fan, but something about her compels him to talk to her. He begins to think that Betty is an actress determined to get a part on ''A Reason to Love'', so he decides to play along. After three hours of her \"staying in character\", he takes her home. George begins falling in love with Betty, and he and his producer decide to bring her onto the show as a new character: Nurse Betty. When Betty arrives on set, she falls out of her fantasy world back into real life. After two failed takes, she realizes that she is on a set and that the people she thought were real are just characters. George confronts her and Betty walks out.\n\nBack at Rosa's house, Betty is telling her roommate what happened when the two hitmen walk in and take Betty and Rosa hostage at gunpoint. Charlie and Wesley tie up the two women and are subsequently interrupted by Roy and Sheriff Ballard, who have also tracked down Betty. A standoff ensues until Ballard pulls a gun from an ankle holster and shoots Wesley dead, who is revealed to be Charlie's son. Charlie decides not to kill Betty and commits [[suicide]] in the bathroom. George offers Betty a job on the show. She appears in 63 episodes and takes a vacation in Rome. Betty later plans to pursue nursing as a career.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Charlie\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Betty Sizemore\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Wesley\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as George McCord (Dr. David Ravell)\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as Del Sizemore\n* [[Tia Texada]] as Rosa Hernandez\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as Roy Ostery\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Sheriff Eldon Ballard\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Lyla Branch\n* [[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Sue Ann Rogers\n* [[Elizabeth Mitchell]] as Chloe Jensen\n* [[Harriet Sansom Harris]] as Ellen\n* [[Sheila Kelley (American actress)|Sheila Kelley]] as Joyce\n* [[Sung-Hi Lee]] as Jasmine\n* [[Steven Gilborn]] as Blake\n* [[Christopher McDonald (actor)|Christopher McDonald]] (''[[deleted scene]]'') as Duane Cooley\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n''Nurse Betty'' received very positive reviews from critics and has a rating of 83% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 131 reviews with an average rating of 7.2/10.
