Conceived and produced by Madhouse founders [[Masao Maruyama (film producer)|Masao Maruyama]] and [[Rintaro]], it adapts [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Taku Mayumura]] featured in the 1986 collection of the same Japanese title<ref name=book>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4041357470 |title=\u8ff7\u5bae\u7269\u8a9e (\u89d2\u5ddd\u6587\u5eab) &#124; \u7709\u6751 \u5353 &#124;\u672c &#124; \u901a\u8ca9 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2022-08-07}}</ref> and is [[Executive producer|executive produced]] by publisher [[Haruki Kadokawa]].\n\nThe 50 minute-long film has three segments, each under a different [[screenwriter]] and [[film director]]: Rintaro's \"Labyrinth Labyrinthos,\" an exploration into the maze of a little girl's mind, [[Yoshiaki Kawajiri]]'s \"Running Man,\" focusing on a deadly [[Auto racing|auto race]], and [[Katsuhiro Otomo|Katsuhiro \u014ctomo]]'s \"Construction Cancellation Order,\" a cautionary tale about man's dependency on technology. In addition to original music by [[Godiego]]'s [[Mickie Yoshino]], two prominently feature famous pieces of Western [[classical music]]: the first of [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Gymnop\u00e9dies (Satie)|Gymnop\u00e9dies]]'' and the \"[[Toreador Song]]\" of [[Georges Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' in \"Labyrinth\" and \"[[Morning Mood]]\" from [[Edvard Grieg]]'s [[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|''Peer Gynt'' score]], in an ironic manner, in \"The Order.\"\n\nThe film premiered on September 25, 1987, at that year's T\u014dky\u014d International Fantastic Film Festival. Other than festival screenings, Japanese distributor [[Toho]] originally relegated the film [[direct-to-video]], releasing a VHS on October 10, 1987, but did eventually give it a general cinema release in Japan, on April 15, 1989. In English, the film was licensed, [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] and released theatrically (as a [[double feature]] with the first ''[[Silent M\u00f6bius]]'' film) and to VHS in [[North America]] by [[Streamline Pictures]], the license later being taken up by the now also out of business [[ADV Films]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lenburg |first1=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=2009 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-6600-1 |edition=3rd |page=205}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Labyrinth Labyrinthos ===\nThe short follows Sachi ([[Hideko Yoshida]]/[[Cheryl Chase (actress)|Cheryl Chase]]), a girl locked in a game of [[hide-and-seek]] with her cat [[Cicerone]]. Her search leads her to an old [[longcase clock]] which doubles as a doorway to a [[labyrinth]] world. The world is filled with supernatural oddities and characters, such as cardboard working class citizens, an invisible dog, a skeleton-led train and a weird circus. Eventually, Sachi and Cicerone arrive at a [[circus]] tent where a viewing screen is displayed, leading to the following segments.\n\n=== Running Man ===\nZack Hugh ([[Banj\u014d Ginga]]/[[Jeff Winkless]]) is the titular \"Running Man,\" the undefeated champion of the \"Death Circus\" racing circuit and has raced for 10 years. Competitors race in high-speed [[Formula One]]-like craft, and spectators bet on the lives of these people for huge winnings. A [[Philip Marlowe|Marlowe-esque]] reporter ([[Masane Tsukayama]]/[[Michael McConnohie]]) is sent to interview the mysterious Zack outside of the track and watches one of his races. He soon discovers Hugh has telekinetic abilities which he uses to destroy the other racers, after quietly observing him in the dark, chronically over-using a training interface inside his penthouse. As the race ends in his favor, the monitors in the pit display \"LIFE FUNCTIONS TERMINATED.\"  Mysteriously, though seemingly dead, Hugh continues around the track and is overtaken by a spectral racer. He attempts to employ the same strategy, straining to destroy the opponent, but in truth it is against his own mind. The force of the telekinesis is directed inward which rapidly tears both Hugh and his car apart. The Death Circus is permanently shut down afterwards; the reporter believing the event's true draw was the spectators' need to see how long Hugh could beat death.\n\n=== Construction Cancellation Order ===\nA revolution in the fictional [[South America]]n country of the Aloana Republic has resulted in a new government being installed; this new government refuses to accept a contract detailing the construction of Facility 444. The company responsible for the construction has begun to lose millions, so [[salaryman]] Tsutomu Sugioka ([[Y\u016b Mizushima]]/[[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]]) is sent to stop production. The work is completely automated, carried out by robots programmed to finish the job no matter the consequences and led by a robot identified as 444-1 ([[Hiroshi \u014ctake]]/[[Jeff Winkless]]). Witnessing the destruction of several robots and Robot 444-1's refusal to cease operations, Tsutomu begins to lose his patience and is nearly killed by 444-1 who was programmed to eliminate anything that poses a threat to the project. He retaliates by destroying 444-1 and follows its powercord that leads to the energy source of the robots in an attempt to finally end the production.  Unknown to Tsutomu, the old government has been restored and they have agreed to honor the contract once more.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Labyrinth Labyrinthos ===\n{{Nihongo|''Labyrinth Labyrinthos''|\u30e9\u30d3\u30ea\u30f3\u30b9\uff0a\u30e9\u30d3\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8\u30b9|Rabirinsu Rabirintosu}} is written for the screen and directed by Rintaro, with [[Model sheet|character design]] and [[Animation director|animation direction]] by [[Atsuko Fukushima]], [[Key frame|key]] animation by Manabu \u014chashi, Reiko Kurihara and Fukushima and [[Art director|art direction]] by Yamako Ishikawa.<ref name=credits /> It serves as the anthology's \"top-level\" story, a [[framing device]] that leads into the other two works.\n\n=== Running Man ===\n{{Nihongo|''Running Man''|\u8d70\u308b\u7537|Hashiru Otoko}} is written for the screen and directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, with character design and animation direction by Kawajiri, mechanical design by Takashi Watabe and Satoshi Kumagai, key animation by Shinji Otsuka, Nobumasa Shinkawa, Toshio Kawaguchi and Kengo Inagaki and art direction by Katsushi Aoki.<ref name=credits /> The segment also appeared on [[List of Liquid Television episodes#Season 2 (1992)|Episode 205]] of ''[[Liquid Television]]'' with a different voice actor, Rafael Ferrer, than [[Michael McConnohie]]'s Streamline dub.\n\n=== Construction Cancellation Order ===\n{{Nihongo|''Construction Cancellation Order''|\u5de5\u4e8b\u4e2d\u6b62\u547d\u4ee4|K\u014dji Ch\u016bshi Meirei}} is written for the screen and directed by [[Katsuhiro \u014ctomo]], with character design by \u014ctomo, animation direction by [[Takashi Nakamura]], key animation by [[K\u014dji Morimoto]], Nakamura, \u014ctomo and Kunihiko Sakurai and art direction by Takamura Mukuo.<ref name=credits /> This segment's depiction of South America as a dangerous, unstable place is comparable to other depictions in the Japanese media during the 1980s such as [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s 1987 [[Comics|comic]] ''[[Gringo (manga)|Gringo]]''.\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a 2021 list of the \"100 best anime movies of all-time\", ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine ranked ''Neo Tokyo'' at #10, writing \"though for the most part absent of any real thematic connectivity, ''Neo-Tokyo'' is a concise and powerful example of the dizzying heights of technical mastery and aesthetic ambition anime can achieve when put in the hands of the medium's most inimitable creators.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Egan|first=Toussaint|last2=DeMarco|first2=Jason|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/best-anime-movies/the-100-best-anime-movies-of-all-time/|title=The 100 Best Anime Movies of All Time|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=27 April 2021|accessdate=24 May 2021}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Anime and manga|Speculative fiction}}\n* ''[[Robot Carnival]]''\n* ''[[Memories (1995 film)|Memories]]''\n* ''[[Short Peace]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Amg movie|269556|Neo Tokyo}}\n* {{anime News Network|film|2044|Neo Tokyo}}\n* {{IMDb title|0185481|Neo Tokyo}}\n\n{{Katsuhiro Otomo}}\n{{Rintaro}}\n{{Yoshiaki Kawajiri}}\n{{Madhouse films}}\n\n[[Category:1987 anime films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk films]]\n[[Category:Films based on multiple works]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Katsuhiro Otomo]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Rintaro]]\n[[Category:Films set in South America]]\n[[Category:Japanese anthology films]]\n[[Category:Japanese auto racing films]]\n[[Category:Japanese animated science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Madhouse (company)]]\n[[Category:Animated films about auto racing]]\n[[Category:Animated anthology films]]\n[[Category:Japanese robot films]]\n[[Category:Films about telekinesis]]\n[[Category:Toho animated films]]\n[[Category:ADV Films]]"}]}}}}
