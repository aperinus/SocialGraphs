Directed by [[Doug Liman]] with a screenplay written by [[Christopher McQuarrie]] and the writing team of [[Jez Butterworth|Jez]] and [[John-Henry Butterworth]], its story is adapted from the 2004 Japanese [[light novel]] ''[[All You Need Is Kill]]'' by [[Hiroshi Sakurazaka]]. The film takes place in a future where most of Europe is occupied by an alien race. Major William Cage (Cruise), a [[public relations officer]] with limited combat experience, is forced by his superiors to join a [[landing operation]] against the aliens, only to find himself experiencing a [[time loop]] as he tries to find a way to defeat the invaders.\n\nIn late 2009, {{nowrap|[[3 Arts Entertainment]]}} purchased the rights to ''All You Need Is Kill'' and sold a [[spec script]] to the American studio [[Warner Bros.]] The studio produced ''Edge of Tomorrow'' with the involvement of {{nowrap|3 Arts}}, the novel's publisher [[Viz Media]], and Australian production company [[Village Roadshow]]. Filming began in late 2012, taking place in England: at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|WB Studios in Leavesden]], outside London, and other locations, such as London's [[Trafalgar Square]] and the coastal [[Saunton Sands]]. A total of nine companies handled the [[visual effects]].\n\nWarner Bros. spent over $100 million advertising ''Edge of Tomorrow''. It was released in cinemas on the weekend of {{nowrap|May 30}}, 2014, in 28 territories, and 36 additional territories a week later. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the plot, direction, action sequences, and performances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/tom-cruise-best-movies-of-the-decade-imdb/10/?v=6&n=f|title=Edge Of Tomorrow - 7.9|date=2019-12-06|website=SCREENRANT|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref> It grossed over $370.5 million worldwide in its theatrical run.<ref name=\"bom\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2015, aliens called \"Mimics\" arrive in [[Germany]] via an asteroid and swiftly conquer most of [[continental Europe]]. By 2020, the United Defense Force (UDF), a global military alliance established to combat the alien threat, finally achieves a victory over the Mimics at [[Verdun]] using newly developed [[Powered exoskeleton|mech-suits]]. In Britain, the UDF plans a major invasion of France, and General Brigham orders recently attached [[Public affairs (military)|public affairs]] officer Major William \"Bill\" Cage to cover it. Cage, having no combat experience, objects and threatens to blame Brigham if the invasion fails. Brigham has Cage arrested and sent to [[Heathrow Airport]], now a military base. Cage awakens to find Brigham has demoted him to a [[private (rank)|private]] and falsely labelled him a [[deserter]]. He is assigned to Master Sergeant Farell and the misfit J-Squad, all of whom dislike and belittle him.\n\nFarell and J-Squad are quickly killed by the Mimics, who were somehow aware of their planned invasion and ambushed them. Cage uses a [[M18 Claymore mine|Claymore mine]] to kill an unusually large blue Mimic but is mortally wounded by the explosion and covered in the alien's blood. Cage jolts awake to find himself back at Heathrow, reliving the previous morning. His attempts to warn Farell against the invasion are ignored and he experiences the loop of dying on the beach and waking at Heathrow repeatedly. During one loop, Cage tries to save Sergeant Rita Vrataski, a celebrated hero of the battle of Verdun. She realizes Cage can loop time and orders him to find her the next time he wakes up.\n\nCage reawakens and locates Vrataski, who takes him to Dr. Carter, an expert in Mimic biology. He explains that the Mimics are a [[superorganism]] in which the \"Omega\" controls the [[cerebrum]], while the \"Alphas\" behave as the [[Ganglion|ganglia]] through which the Omega controls ordinary Mimics; if an Alpha is terminated, the Omega resets the day and adjusts its tactics until the battle is won. Cage inadvertently \"hijacked\" their ability to reset time through his exposure to an Alpha's blood. Vrataski had this ability at Verdun, using it to win the battle before she was wounded and received a [[blood transfusion]], losing the power. She tells Cage to locate and kill the Omega to end the alien invasion.\n\nOver many more loops, Vrataski trains Cage to excel in combat. After a frustrating lesson, Cage escapes to London, only to discover that the Mimics will attack there next after the invasion. After seeing visions of a dam in Switzerland where the Omega is hiding and spending many loops figuring how to escape the invasion and reach the dam, Cage grows closer to Vrataski, but she is only interested in the mission. Cage flies to the dam alone upon reaching a point where Vrataski is killed no matter what they do. The Omega is not there and he is ambushed by an Alpha who attempts to strip him of his ability to reset time, but Cage deliberately drowns himself.\n\nCage and Vrataski infiltrate the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)#Property portfolio|Ministry of Defence]], where Cage convinces Brigham to give him Carter's prototype device (which he had confiscated from him and had him sent to a [[psych ward]]) that can locate the Omega, but they are pursued by [[military police]] on leaving. During the ensuing car chase, Cage uses the device and discovers the Omega is under the [[Louvre Pyramid]] in Paris. Cage is seriously injured during capture and wakes up in a hospital to find he has been given a blood transfusion and has lost the ability to loop time.\n\nVrataski frees Cage and they recruit J-Squad to help destroy the Omega before the invasion begins. They fly to Paris, where the soldiers sacrifice themselves so that Cage and Vrataski can reach the Louvre. Before luring away an Alpha standing between them and the submerged Omega, Vrataski kisses Cage to thank him for getting her as far as he did. The Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, but he manages to drop a belt of grenades that destroys the Omega.\n\nAs a dying Cage floats down into the Omega's blood, he awakens en route to his first meeting with Brigham, who announces on TV that Mimic activity has ceased following a mysterious energy surge in Paris. Cage goes to Heathrow, now a Major again, and sees that all of J-Squad is alive. He later finds Vrataski, who doesn't recognize him; Cage laughs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Tom Cruise by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| width1 = 171\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = EmilyBluntTIFFSept2012.jpg\n| width2 = 161\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Tom Cruise]] (''left'') and [[Emily Blunt]] (''right''), who play the lead roles in the film\n}}\n\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Major William Cage\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Sergeant Rita Vrataski\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Master Sergeant Farell\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as General Brigham\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Dr. Noah Carter\n* [[Jonas Armstrong]] as Skinner\n* [[Tony Way]] as Kimmel\n* [[Kick Gurry]] as Griff\n* [[Charlotte Riley]] as Nance\n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Ford\n* [[Dragomir Mrsic]] as Kuntz\n* [[Masayoshi Haneda]] as Takeda\n* [[Madeleine Mantock]] as Corporal Julie Montgomery\n* [[Harry Landis]] as Old Man 3\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Crew==\n[[File:Doug Liman avp 2014.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Doug Liman in front of a steel beam.|Director Doug Liman at the Paris premiere of the film]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Doug Liman]] \u2013 director<ref name=\"warnerbros\">{{cite web | url=http://html5.warnerbros.com/us/edgeoftomorrow/synopsis.html | title=Edge of Tomorrow - Story | work=warnerbros.com | publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] | accessdate=March 31, 2022 }}</ref>\n* [[Christopher McQuarrie]] \u2013 co-writer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* [[Jez Butterworth]] \u2013 co-writer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* [[John-Henry Butterworth]] \u2013 co-writer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* [[Erwin Stoff]] \u2013 producer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* Tom Lassally \u2013 producer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* Jeffrey Silver \u2013 producer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* [[Gregory Jacobs]] \u2013 producer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* Jason Hoffs \u2013 producer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* [[Dion Beebe]] \u2013 cinematographer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* Oliver Scholl \u2013 production designer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* [[Kate Hawley]] \u2013 costume designer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* James Herbert \u2013 editor<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* Laura Jennings \u2013 editor<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* [[Christophe Beck]] \u2013 composer<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n* [[Nick Davis (special effects)|Nick Davis]] \u2013 visual effects supervisor<ref name=\"warnerbros\" />\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n[[Viz Media]] published ''[[All You Need Is Kill]]'' in North America in 2009 as one of four translated Japanese science fiction novels that initiated its [[Viz Media#Haikasoru|Haikasoru]] imprint.<ref name=\"HaikasoruPR\">{{cite press release |url=https://www.viz.com/news/newsroom/v/1196 |title=Viz Media Launches Landmark Imprint Haika Soru to Published Acclaimed Japanese Science Fiction Novels |publisher=Viz Media |date=2009-01-29 |access-date=2009-06-14}}</ref> After drawing the interest of producer Erwin Stoff,<ref name=\"notes\">{{cite press release |title=Edge of Tomorrow production notes |publisher=Warner Bros. |url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=18395 |date=May 31, 2014 |access-date=October 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203614/http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=18395 |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> his company {{nowrap|3 Arts}} Entertainment [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] the novel that same year. {{nowrap|3 Arts}} collaborated with the publisher's filmmaking subsidiary Viz Productions, headed by Jason Hoffs.
