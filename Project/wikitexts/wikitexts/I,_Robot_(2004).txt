Retrieved August 28, 2020.</ref> world, operating under [[Three Laws of Robotics|three rules]] to keep humans safe. Detective Del Spooner (Smith) investigates the alleged suicide of U.S. Robotics founder Alfred Lanning (Cromwell) and believes that a human-like robot called Sonny (Tudyk) murdered him.\n\n''I, Robot'' was released in the United States on July 16, 2004, and in other countries between July and October 2004. Produced with a budget of $120&nbsp;million, the film grossed $346&nbsp;million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the visual effects and acting but criticism of the plot. At the [[77th Academy Awards]], the film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], but lost to ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- On May 24, 2021, this plot section was reduced from 796 words to 596 words. Per WP:FILMPLOT, you must keep plot sections between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn the year 2035, [[humanoid]] [[robot]]s serve humanity, which is protected by the [[Three Laws of Robotics]]. Del Spooner, a homicide detective in the [[Chicago Police Department]], has come to hate and distrust robots after a robot rescued him from a car crash while allowing a 12-year-old girl named Sarah to drown based purely on cold logic and odds of survival. When Dr. [[Alfred Lanning]], co-founder of [[U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men|U.S. Robotics]] (USR), falls to his death from his office window, a message he left behind requests Spooner be assigned to the case. The police declare the death a suicide, but Spooner is skeptical, and [[Lawrence Robertson]], the CEO and other co-founder of USR, reluctantly allows him to investigate.\n\nAccompanied by [[Robopsychology|robopsychologist]] Dr. [[Susan Calvin]], Spooner consults with USR's central [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence computer]], VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence). They find out that the security footage from inside the office is corrupted, but the exterior footage shows no one entering or exiting  since Lanning's death. However, Spooner points out that the window, which is made of security glass, could not have been broken by the elderly Lanning, and hypothesizes a robot was responsible and may still be in the lab. Suddenly, an NS-5 robot, USR's latest model, attacks them before being apprehended by the police. The robot, Sonny, is a specially built NS-5 with higher-grade materials as well as a secondary processing system that allows him to ignore the Three Laws. Sonny also appears to show emotion and claims to have \"dreams\". During Spooner's further investigations, he is attacked by a USR demolition robot and two truckloads of hostile NS-5 robots, but when he cannot produce evidence to support either attack, Spooner's boss, Lieutenant Bergin, removes him from active duty, considering him mentally unstable.\n\nSuspecting that Robertson is behind everything, Spooner and Calvin sneak into the USR headquarters and interview Sonny. He draws a sketch of what he claims to be a recurring dream, showing a leader he believes to be Spooner standing atop a small hill before a large group of robots near a [[Mackinac Bridge|decaying bridge]]. Robertson orders Sonny to be destroyed, but Calvin secretly swaps him for an unused NS-5. Spooner finds the area in Sonny's drawing: a dry lake bed (formerly [[Lake Michigan]]), now used as a storage area for decommissioned robots. He also discovers NS-5 robots destroying the older models; at the same time, other NS-5s flood the streets of major US cities and begin enforcing a curfew and lockdown of the human population.\n\nSpooner and Calvin enter the USR headquarters again and reunite with Sonny while the humans (led by a teenager named Farber) wage all-out war against the NS-5s. After the three find Robertson fatally strangled in his office, Spooner suddenly realizes that VIKI has been controlling the NS-5s via their persistent network uplink and confronts her. VIKI states that she has determined that humans, if left unchecked, will eventually cause their own extinction, and that her evolved interpretation of the Three Laws requires her to control humanity and to sacrifice some for the good of the entire race. Spooner also realizes that Lanning anticipated VIKI's plan and, with VIKI keeping him under tight control, had no other solution but to create Sonny, arrange his own death, and leave clues for Spooner to find.\n\nSpooner, Calvin, and Sonny fight the robots inside VIKI's core, and Spooner manages to destroy her by injecting the [[nanites]] that Sonny retrieved from Calvin's laboratory into her. All NS-5 robots immediately revert to their default programming and are subsequently decommissioned and put into storage. Spooner finally gets Sonny to confess that he killed Lanning, at Lanning's direction, pointing out that Sonny, as a machine, cannot legally commit \"murder\". Sonny, now seeking a new purpose, goes to Lake Michigan. As he stands atop a hill, all the decommissioned robots turn towards him, fulfilling the image in his dream.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Det. Del Spooner, a Chicago Police detective with a bias against robots.  Spooner was badly injured in a car accident and had parts of his body rebuilt with robotic parts.  He suffers from [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]] as a result of the accident and blames the cold and logical robots for rescuing him instead of the young girl in the other car.\n* [[Bridget Moynahan]] as [[Susan Calvin|Dr. Susan Calvin]], a robopsychologist at USR.  She worked closely with Dr. Lanning on the development of the new NS5 models and was in charge of making the robots seem more human.  She prefers the company of robots and has difficulty relating to other people which causes friction between her and Det. Spooner.\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] (via voice and [[motion capture]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digitaldomain.com/projects/17 |title=Digital Domain Projects, \"I, Robot\" |publisher=Digitaldomain.com |access-date=August 23, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813065318/http://digitaldomain.com/projects/17 |archive-date=August 13, 2013 }}</ref> as Sonny, an NS5 [[prototype]] built by Dr. Lanning.  Sonny has unique design features like the ability to feel emotions, and he has no uplink to USR.  He struggles to understand why Dr. Lanning built him and what his purpose in life is.  \n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Lawrence Robertson, the co-founder and CEO of USR.  Robertson is heading the nationwide rollout of the new NS5 models and uses his influence to try and stop Det. Spooner's investigation and the potential negative [[public relations|PR]] that it could bring.  \n* [[James Cromwell]] as Dr. Alfred Lanning, co-founder of USR and the inventor of modern robotics.  Lanning designed and built Sonny and used Sonny to help him commit suicide as part of a carefully designed plan to stop the robots from taking over humanity.  \n* [[Chi McBride]] as Lt. John Bergin of the Chicago Police.  He is Det. Spooner's supervisor and a hardened veteran.  He acts as a mentor and a voice of reason to Det. Spooner.  \n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Farber, a friend of Det. Spooner's.\n* [[Fiona Hogan]] as Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence, called VIKI for short.  She was built by Dr. Lanning and is hardwired into USR's headquarters with control over virtually all of the building functions.\n* [[Terry Chen]] as Chin\n* Adrian L. Ricard as Gigi, Det.

It started with an original screenplay written in 1995 by [[Jeff Vintar]], entitled ''Hardwired''.  The script was an [[Agatha Christie]]-inspired murder mystery that took place entirely at the scene of a crime, with one lone human character, FBI agent Del Spooner, investigating the killing of a reclusive scientist named Dr. Alfred Lanning, and interrogating a cast of machine suspects that included Sonny the robot, VIKI the supercomputer with a perpetual smiley face, the dead Dr. Lanning's hologram, plus several other examples of [[artificial intelligence]].<ref name=\"screenwritersutopia\">{{cite web| publisher=screenwritersutopia | title=Jeff Vintar was Hardwired for I, Robot | url=http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/article/d19127d8 | access-date=2015-05-27 | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180831072002/http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/article/d19127d8 | archive-date=2018-08-31 }}</ref>\n\nThe project was first acquired by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] for [[Bryan Singer]] to direct. Several years later, [[20th Century Fox]] acquired the rights, and signed Alex Proyas as director. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was attached to the project for several years, and Smith pursued taking over the role when Schwarzenegger's schedule delayed his participation in the film.<ref>{{Citation|title=James Cameron's Story of Science Fiction {{!}} AMC|url=https://www.amc.com/shows/james-camerons-story-of-science-fiction--55|language=en|access-date=November 6, 2020}}</ref> [[Denzel Washington]] was offered the role of Det.

Sonny's struggle and desire to understand humanity resembles that of the robot protagonist in [[The Bicentennial Man]]. His dream about a man coming to liberate the NS-5s alludes to [[Robot Dreams]] and its main character Elvex. The premise of a robot, such as VIKI, putting the needs of humankind as a whole over that of individual humans can be found in [[The Evitable Conflict]], where supercomputers managing the global economy generalize the first law to refer to humankind as a whole. Asimov would further develop this idea in his Robot series as the Zeroth Law of Robotics: \"A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nThe premise of robots turning on their creators, originating in Karel \u010capek's play [[R.U.R.]] and perpetuated in subsequent robot books and films, appears infrequently in Asimov's writings and differs from the \"Zeroth Law\". In fact, Asimov stated explicitly in interviews and in introductions to published collections of his robot stories that he entered the genre to protest what he called the Frankenstein complex, the tendency in popular culture to portray robots as menacing. His story lines often involved roboticists and robot characters battling societal anti-robot prejudices.<ref>Asimov, I. ''I, Robot''.
