It stars [[Adam Sandler]] as the title character, an unsuccessful ice hockey player who discovers a newfound talent for golf. The screenplay was written by Sandler and his writing partner [[Tim Herlihy]], in their second feature collaboration after the previous year's ''[[Billy Madison]]''; the film also marks the first of multiple collaborations between Sandler and Dugan. The film was released in theaters on February 16, 1996, by [[Universal Pictures]]. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, ''Happy Gilmore'' was a commercial success, earning $39&nbsp;million on a $12&nbsp;million budget. The film won an [[MTV Movie Award]] for \"[[MTV Movie Award for Best Fight|Best Fight]]\" for Adam Sandler versus [[Bob Barker]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nHappy Gilmore is a short-tempered, unsuccessful ice hockey player who lacks skills other than fighting and a powerful [[slapshot]] he learned from his late father. After yet another failed tryout, Happy learns that his grandmother owes the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] $270,000 in back taxes; she has 90 days to pay off the debt, or her house will face foreclosure. Happy sends his grandmother to live in a retirement home, where its residents are mistreated, temporarily until he can pay for her house.\n\nTwo movers repossessing Happy's grandmother's furniture challenge him to a long-drive contest using his grandfather's old golf clubs. With an unorthodox, slapshot-style swing, Happy hits a ball some 400 yards, winning $40 from the movers. Inspired, he starts hustling golfers at the driving range to make quick money. There, he meets Chubbs Peterson, a club pro and former tour star who lost a hand in an alligator attack. Chubbs urges Happy to enter a local tournament where the winner will earn an automatic spot on the [[PGA Tour|professional golf tour]]; desperate to take back his grandmother's house, Happy accepts after Chubbs informs him of the significant prize money involved.\n\nHappy wins the local tournament and a spot on the tour, quickly becoming a fan favorite thanks to his long drives and unorthodox antics, such as asking the crowd to cheer during his swing instead of staying quiet. He also meets arrogant pro Shooter McGavin, who disapproves of his lack of [[golf etiquette]]. Though Happy has a powerful drive, his putting is terrible, and his bad behavior draws the attention of tour Commissioner Doug Thompson. Public relations head Virginia Venit convinces Thompson not to expel Happy from the tour, citing higher television ratings and attendance and new sponsorship offers; she promises to help Happy with his anger issues. With Virginia's help, Gilmore begins to improve his performance and behavior, and the two form a romantic connection.\n\nDuring the [[Pepsi]] pro-am event, Happy plays poorly when Shooter hires a [[heckler]], Donald, to antagonize him, and he and his celebrity partner, [[Bob Barker]], get into a fistfight. Happy is fined $25,000 and given a one-month suspension from the tour, jeopardizing his chances to save his grandmother's house until Virginia secures him an endorsement deal with [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]. However, the house is put up for auction where Shooter spitefully outbids Happy. Shooter offers it to Happy on the condition that he agrees to quit golf. Happy initially accepts, but Virginia talks him out of it, telling him that his grandmother would rather see Happy be successful. Happy strikes a deal with Shooter for the upcoming [[Tour Championship]]: if Happy wins, Shooter will return the house, but if Shooter wins, Happy will quit. Happy seeks out Chubbs, who helps him improve his short game by practicing at a miniature golf course. As thanks, Happy presents Chubbs the head of the alligator that bit off his hand, but a startled Chubbs falls out of a window to his death.\n\nNow determined to win the Tour Championship for both Chubbs and his grandmother, Happy plays well and leads at the end of the third round. Desperate to win the Tour Championship, which he has never done before, Shooter once again calls on Donald. On the final day, Happy seems unstoppable until Donald drives his car onto the course and hits Happy, who sustains a shoulder injury, impairing his long-drive ability and his focus. Shooter takes the lead, but Happy, after his grandmother arrives to tell him that the house is not important to her and she just wants him to be happy, rallies to tie Shooter after 17 holes. On the 18th hole, a television tower damaged earlier by Donald falls over and blocks the green, but Happy miraculously uses the fallen tower as a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] to sink his putt for the win. Enraged over Happy's victory, Shooter tries to steal the winner's gold jacket but is assaulted by a mob of fans, led by Happy's imposing ex-boss Mr. Larson. Happy takes back his grandmother's house, sees a vision of a two-handed Chubbs with [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the alligator waving at Happy as he waves back. He then celebrates with his grandmother, Virginia, and his caddy Otto.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Happy Gilmore, a high-strung former hockey player, who discovers a unique talent for golf and joins the pro golf tour to win money to save his grandmother's house.
