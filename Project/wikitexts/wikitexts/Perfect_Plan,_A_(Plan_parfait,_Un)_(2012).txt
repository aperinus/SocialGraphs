Written by Laurent Zeitoun and Yoann Gromb, and based on a story by Philippe Mechelen, the film is about a woman in love who tries to break her [[family curse]] of every first marriage ending badly by dashing to the altar with a random stranger before marrying her boyfriend.\n\n==Plot==\nIsabelle is prepared to marry Pierre, the man she has loved for the past ten years, but first must overcome a curse that afflicts the female members of her family: all their first marriages are unhappy. She comes up with the perfect plan: marry a stranger, get a quick divorce to avoid the curse, and be happily married forever the second time. She flies to Copenhagen and finds the perfect pigeon in Jean-Yves, an editor for the ''Guide du Routard'', but her plans are complicated when he believes that she is in love with him. When an arranged marriage falls through, she tracks down Jean-Yves again in hopes she can somehow marry him and divorce him without too much trouble. She ends up following him with divorce papers, which he eventually signs after hearing her talking to her sister on the phone. She then explains the family curse and they spend the next day hanging out. After leaving, she realises she loves him, breaks off her engagement, and she and Jean-Yves live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Diane Kruger]] as Isabelle \n* [[Dany Boon]] as Jean-Yves \n* [[Alice Pol]] as Corinne\n* [[Robert Plagnol]] as Pierre \n* [[Jonathan Cohen (actor)|Jonathan Cohen]] as Patrick \n* Bernadette Le Sach\u00e9 as Solange \n* [[\u00c9tienne Chicot]] as Edmond \n* [[Laure Calamy]] as Val\u00e9rie\n* Malonn L\u00e9vana as Louise \n* Olivier Claverie as Lawyer Maillard\n* [[Damien Bonnard]] as Romain\n\n==Production==\n''A Perfect Plan'' was filmed on location in [[Moscow]], Russia and [[Antwerp]], Flanders, Belgium.<ref name=\"imdblocations\">{{cite web|title=Locations for Un plan parfait |work=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1986843/locations |accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an approval rating of 33%, based on 18 reviews, with an average score of 5/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_perfect_plan|title=A Perfect Plan (Un plan parfait) (2012)\n|website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\nIn his review in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Jordon Mintzer wrote that the film \"works best as a portrait of two opposites who come together out of empathy, rather than out of love.\"<ref name=\"hollywood\">{{cite web|last=Mintzer |first=Jordan |title=Fly Me to the Moon (Un plan parfait): Film Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2 November 2012 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/fly-me-moon-plan-parfait-385921 |accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref> In his review in ''[[The Montreal Gazette]]'', T'Cha Dunlevy felt that the film \"may have worked on paper, but the execution leaves much to be desired\".<ref name=\"gazette\">{{cite web|last=Dunlevy |first=T'cha |title=Review: Un plan parfait |work=The Montreal Gazette |date= |url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Review+plan+parfait/8455438/story.html |accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nUpon its theatrical release, ''A Perfect Plan'' earned $16 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|title=Un Plan Parfait |work=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&country=FR&id=_fUNPLANPARFAIT01 |accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=1986843}}\n\n{{Pascal Chaumeil}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Perfect Plan, A}}\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:2012 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2012 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2010s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Pascal Chaumeil]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Klaus Badelt]]\n[[Category:2010s French films]]"}]}}}}
