It follows a [[primatology|primatologist]] who must team up with George, an [[Albinism|albino]] [[western lowland gorilla]] who turns into a raging creature of enormous size and growing into bigger and larger sizes as a result of a rogue experiment, to stop two other mutated animals from destroying [[Chicago]].\n\nThe film is the third collaboration between Peyton and Johnson, following ''[[Journey 2: The Mysterious Island]]'' (2012) and ''[[San Andreas (film)|San Andreas]]'' (2015).

The film was released in the United States on April 13, 2018, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], in 2D, [[RealD 3D]] and [[IMAX]]. The film had grossed over $428 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, but positive reception from audience, with praise for its performances (particularly Johnson and Morgan), action sequences and visual effects, but criticism of its screenplay, pacing and storyline.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rampage-reviews-what-critics-are-saying-1101890| title= Rampage Reviews: What The Critics are Saying|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=April 11, 2018|access-date=April 12, 2018|last=Shanley|first=Patrick}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine| url= https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/12/rampage-reviews/amp/| title= Here's What Critics are Saying about Rampage|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 12, 2018|access-date=April 12, 2018|last=Holub|first=Christian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/rampage-review-roundup-the-rock-cant-save-this-ludicrous-trash-2018-4|title=Critics are tearing apart The Rock's new movie 'Rampage,' calling it bland and ludicrous trash|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=April 12, 2018|access-date=April 12, 2018|last=Clark|first=Travis}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words -->\nAthena-1, a [[space station]] owned by gene-manipulation company Energyne, is destroyed after a [[laboratory rat]] mutates and wreaks havoc. Kerry Atkins, the lone surviving crew member, manages to escape in the escape pod when the station implodes, along with [[pathogen]] canisters that Energyne [[CEO]] Claire Wyden orders her to retrieve, but the pod disintegrates upon re-entry, killing her and leaving a trail of debris across the United States. One canister is swallowed by an [[American crocodile]] in the [[Everglades]] and another lands in a [[Wyoming]] forest where a [[wolf]] is exposed to the pathogen.\n\nPrimatologist Davis Okoye, a former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] soldier and member of an anti-poaching unit, works at the [[San Diego Zoo Safari Park|San Diego Wildlife Sanctuary]]. He has befriended a rare [[Albinism in animals|albino]] [[western lowland gorilla]] named George that he saved from [[poaching|poachers]] who killed his mother and communicates with him using [[sign language]]. One of the canisters crash-lands in George's habitat and he is exposed to the pathogen.\n\nAs George grows considerably larger and becomes more aggressive, Davis is contacted by [[Genetic engineering|genetic engineer]] Dr. Kate Caldwell, who explains that the pathogen was developed by Energyne to rewrite genes on a massive scale. She had hoped to advance research on [[CRISPR]] as a potential cure for diseases, but discovered Energyne's plans to use it as a [[biological weapon]] and was falsely incarcerated, during which her terminally ill brother died. George escapes from captivity and goes on a rampage at the preserve. George calms down, but is soon captured by a government team led by Agent Harvey Russell and put on a [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III]] airplane. Meanwhile, Claire and her brother Brett oversee a [[mercenary]] team's attempt to capture the mutated wolf, Ralph, which goes awry, and the entire team is slaughtered.\n\nClaire, hoping to capture Ralph and use George to cover up her plot, uses a massive transmitter atop the [[Willis Tower]] to lure the animals \u2013 engineered to respond aggressively to a certain [[radio frequency]] \u2013 to Chicago, unconcerned about the massive risk to civilian lives this poses. George reacts violently to the sound and crashes the plane, though Davis, Kate, and Russell parachute to safety. George survives the crash and joins Ralph as they make their way to [[Chicago]], while Davis and Kate are aided by Russell in stealing a military helicopter in pursuit.\n\nThey arrive to find George and Ralph rampaging through the city as the [[United States Armed Forces|military]] struggles to contain them. The situation worsens when the mutated crocodile, Lizzie, joins the duo, causing even more casualties. Planning to steal an [[antidote]] to turn the animals back to normal, Davis and Kate infiltrate Energyne's base of operations at the tower and take several vials of it, but are caught by the Wydens as Claire reveals that the antidote only eliminates the animals' enhanced aggressiveness rather than reversing the other effects and shoots Davis, but he survives. When George climbs to the top of the tower, Claire orders Davis to distract it while she attempts to escape with Kate at gunpoint. Kate slips a vial into Claire's handbag and pushes her toward George, who devours the terrorist along with the vial, returning him to his normal personality. Down below, Russell takes incriminating evidence from Brett, who is crushed to death by falling debris. As the damaged tower topples, Davis and Kate survive by crash-landing a helicopter on the [[Kluczynski Federal Building|Federal Plaza]].\n\nDavis stays to help George defeat the other animals, while Kate and Russell rush to prevent the military from deploying a [[GBU-43/B MOAB|MOAB]] against them. George battles against Ralph, whom Davis tricks into advancing towards Lizzie, who decapitates him using her jaws. Lizzie chases Davis, but George intervenes in time for Davis to incapacitate her using [[grenade]]s. However, Lizzie survives and overpowers George, who is impaled by a [[rebar]]. Davis distracts Lizzie using a fallen [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|Apache attack helicopter]], but is nearly killed before George pierces Lizzie through the eye with the same rebar, killing her.\n\nWith the threat neutralized, the airstrike is aborted. In the aftermath, George and Davis, joined by Kate and Russell, help clear the city of debris and rescue civilians.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Humans===\n<!--- Cast per tombstone closing credits, \u201cAnd\u201d credit (Morgan) after the two leads, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Davis Okoye, a former US Army Special Forces soldier as well as primatologist and head of an anti-poaching unit.<ref name=\"JohnsonRampage\"/>\n* [[Naomie Harris]] as Katherine \"Kate\" Caldwell, a disgraced genetic engineer who teams up with Okoye.<ref>{{cite news |title=Naomie Harris stuns in Gucci alongside Dwayne Johnson at Rampage premiere |url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/naomie-harris-stuns-in-gucci-alongside-dwayne-johnson-at-rampage-premiere-36798554.html |date=April 14, 2008 |access-date=April 14, 2018 |author=Press Association Reporter |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]}}</ref>\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Claire Wyden, the CEO of Energyne, the company responsible for the pathogen that caused George, Lizzie and Ralph's mutations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/rampage-interview-jeffrey-dean-morgan-malin-ackerman-rampage-watchmen/ |title=Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Malin Akerman & Naomie Harris on 'Rampage' and HBO's 'Watchmen' Series |last=Foutch |first=Haleigh |date=April 13, 2018 |access-date=April 14, 2018 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]]}}</ref>\n* [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] as Harvey Russell, a government agent who works for the \"[[CIA|Other Government Agency]]\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Alexander |first=Bryan |date=12 April 2018 |title='Rampage' star Jeffrey Dean Morgan gets emotional about loss, love and baby girl George |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/04/11/rampage-walking-dead-jeffrey-dean-morgan-emotional-baby-girl-george/501876002/ |access-date=22 May 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Jake Lacy]] as Brett Wyden, Claire's dimwitted brother.\n* [[Joe Manganiello]] as Burke, the leader of a private military group.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movieweb.com/rampage-movie-2018-set-photo-joe-manganiello-costume/ |title=Joe Manganiello Reveals His Monster-Fighting Rampage Costume |last=Gallagher |first=Brian |date=May 24, 2017 |access-date=April 14, 2018 |work=[[MovieWeb]] |publisher=Watchr Media}}</ref>\n* [[Marley Shelton]] as Kerry Atkins, a scientist and astronaut.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=White |first=James |date=February 10, 2017 |title=Joe Manganiello And Marley Shelton Headed For Rampage |url=https://www.empireonline.com/people/dwayne-johnson/joe-manganiello-marley-shelton-headed-rampage/ |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |access-date=April 14, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[P.
