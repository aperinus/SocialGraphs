The film is about a middle-aged male professor named Humbert who rents a room in the house of the widow Charlotte Haze and becomes sexually attracted to her [[adolescent]] daughter Dolores, also called \"Lo\" or \"Lolita\".\n\nLyne's film is more overt with many of the novel's darker elements compared to [[Lolita (1962 film)|Stanley Kubrick's 1962 version]], which used suggestion and innuendo for comic purposes.\n\nThe film had difficulty finding an American distributor<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news | title = 'Lolita': Revisiting a Dangerous Obsession | first = Caryn | last = James | url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/tv-lolita-review.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1998-07-31 | access-date = 2010-03-28 }}</ref> and premiered in Europe before being released in the United States.

He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze ([[Melanie Griffith]]), largely because he is sexually attracted to her 14-year-old daughter Dolores ([[Dominique Swain]]), also called \"Lo\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \"[[Lolita (term)#Nymphet|nymphet]]s\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and marries Charlotte only to be near her daughter.\n\nCharlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed, with Humbert eventually telling Lo about her mother's death. Charlotte's death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \"[[Lolita (term)|Lolita]]\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various [[Motor inn|motels]] before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending Beardsley Prep School, an [[Single-sex education|all-girls]] [[Catholic school]]. Humbert must conceal the nature of his relationship with Lolita from everyone \u2013 strangers they encounter when traveling as well as the administration at Beardsley. He presents his relationship with Lo to the world as a father and daughter. Over time, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence and realization of their relationship, fuels a constant tension that leads to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty ([[Frank Langella]]), who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name.\n\nThree years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Her husband, Richard, knows nothing about her past. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually [[Stalking|tracked]] young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for [[child pornography]]. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films.\n\nAfter his visit with Lo, Humbert tracks down Quilty and murders him. After being chased by the police, Humbert is arrested and sent to prison. He dies in prison in November 1950 due to a [[coronary thrombosis]], and Lo dies the next month on Christmas Day from childbirth complications.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Professor Humbert Humbert\n** [[Ben Silverstone]] as young Humbert\n* [[Dominique Swain]] as Dolores \"Lolita\" Haze\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Clare Quilty\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Charlotte Haze\n* [[Suzanne Shepherd]] as Miss Pratt\n* [[Keith Reddin]] as Reverend Rigger\n* [[Erin J.

Harris|James Harris]] and was directed by Kubrick.\n\nThe screenplay for the 1997 version, more faithful to the text of the novel than the earlier motion picture, is credited to [[Stephen Schiff]], a writer for ''[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', and other magazines. Schiff was hired to write it as his first movie script, after the film's producers had rejected commissioned screenplays from the more experienced screenwriters and directors [[James Dearden]] (''[[Fatal Attraction]]''), [[Harold Pinter]], and [[David Mamet]].<ref name = Gale>According to Gale, in ''Sharp Cut'', Pinter was paid for his work but he asked to have his name removed from the credits, as permitted by his contract.: \"In November 1994 Pinter wrote that 'I've just heard that they are bringing another writer into the ''Lolita'' film. It doesn't surprise me.' Pinter's contract contained a clause to the effect that the film company could bring in another writer, but that in such a case he could withdraw his name (this was also the case with [the film] ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]''\u2014he had insisted on this clause since the experience with revisions made to his ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|Handmaid's Tale]]'' script\" (352).</ref><ref name = Hudgins>Hudgins observes: \"During our 1994 interview, Pinter told [Steven H.] Gale and me that he had learned his lesson after the revisions imposed on his script for ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', which he has decided not to publish. When his script for ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)#Background and production notes|Remains of the Day]]'' was radically revised by the [[James Ivory (director)|James Ivory]]\u2013[[Ismail Merchant]] partnership, he refused to allow his name to be listed in the credits\"; Hudgins adds: \"We did not see Pinter's name up in lights when Lyne's ''Lolita'' finally made its appearance in 1998. Pinter goes on in the March 13 [1995] letter [to Hudgins] to state that 'I have never been given any reason at all as to why the film company brought in another writer,' again quite similar to the equally ungracious treatment that he received in the ''Remains of the Day'' situation. He concludes that though he never met Nabokov, 'indeed I knew \"Lolita\" very well and loved it.'&nbsp;\" (125). Hudgins also observes that Schiff was brought in after the efforts by Dearden (October 21, 1991), Pinter (September 26, 1994), and Mamet (March 10, 1995) and that Schiff \"has no previous scripts to his credit\" (124).</ref><ref>In his 2008 essay published in ''The Pinter Review'', Hudgins discusses further details about why \"Pinter elected not to publish three of his completed filmscripts, ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]'', and ''Lolita'',\" all of which Hudgins considers \"masterful filmscripts\" of \"demonstrable superiority to the shooting scripts that were eventually used to make the films\"; fortunately (\"We can thank our various lucky stars\"), he says, \"these Pinter filmscripts are now available not only in private collections but also in [[The Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library|The Pinter Archive at the British Library]]\"; in this essay, which he first presented as a paper at the 10th Europe Theatre Prize symposium, Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, held in Turin, Italy, in March 2006, Hudgins \"examin[es] all three unpublished filmscripts in conjunction with one another\" and \"provides several interesting insights about Pinter's adaptation process\" (132).</ref> According to Schiff:\n\n{{blockquote|Right from the beginning, it was clear to all of us that this movie was not a \"remake\" of Kubrick's film. Rather, we were out to make a new adaptation of a very great novel. Some of the filmmakers involved actually looked upon the Kubrick version as a kind of \"what not to do.\" I had somewhat fonder memories of it than that, but I had not seen it for maybe fifteen years, and I didn't allow myself to go back to it again.<ref name = hye>\"[https://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/schiff1.htm An Interview with Stephen Schiff]\" by Suellen Stringer-Hye, [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]] Libraries, 81996</ref>}}\nSchiff added that Kubrick's film might better have been titled ''Quilty'', since the director had \nallowed the character of Quilty to \"take over the movie\".<ref>Schiff : \"Kubrick...made a film that might better have been titled Quilty. Very much in the thrall of [[Peter Sellers]], he allowed Quilty to take over the movie, with Sellers improvising vast swatches of dialogue. If you look at the Kubrick movie today, the Sellers stuff still seems amazingly energetic and funny and alive; the rest of the story plods by comparison. The other strange choice in the Kubrick film, of course, is [[Sue Lyon]], who, even though she was only fifteen when she played Lolita--the same age as our Dominique Swain--could easily have passed for a twenty-year-old [[porno star]]. Dominique can easily pass for a twelve-year-old, which we all think is a very good thing.\" From the Schiff interview by Suellen Stringer-Hye, 1996</ref>\n\nLyne states in the DVD commentary that he prefers location shooting even though it is more difficult in some respects; and that the home of Charlotte Haze was filmed in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].\n\n==Release==\n''Lolita'' premiered in the United States on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on August 2, 1998. Due to the difficulty in securing a distributor, the film received a [[Limited release|limited theatrical run]] in the US on September 25, 1998, in order to qualify for awards.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Accordingly, the film took in a gross income of $19,492 in its opening weekend.
