It stars [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]], [[Brenton Thwaites]], [[Chadwick Boseman]], [[\u00c9lodie Yung]], [[Courtney Eaton]], [[Rufus Sewell]], [[Gerard Butler]], and [[Geoffrey Rush]].

While the film's production budget was {{nowrap|$140 million,}} the parent company [[Lionsgate]]'s financial exposure was less than $10 million due to tax incentives and pre-sales. The Australian government provided a tax credit for 46% of the film's budget. When Lionsgate began promoting the film in November 2015, it received backlash for its predominantly [[Whitewashing in film|white cast playing Egyptian deities]]. In response, Lionsgate and director Proyas apologized for ethnically inaccurate casting.\n\nLionsgate released ''Gods of Egypt'' in theaters globally, starting on {{nowrap|February 25}}, 2016, in 2D, [[RealD 3D]], and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]], and in the United States, Canada, and 68 other markets on {{nowrap|February 26}}. It grossed a total of $150 million against a $140 million budget, becoming a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]] and losing the studio up to $90 million. It received five nominations at the [[37th Golden Raspberry Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|Horus#Conflict between Horus and Set}}\n\nIn an alternative ancient Egypt where the [[ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] live among the mortals, King [[Osiris]] is killed by his jealous brother [[Set (mythology)|Set]] during the coronation of Osiris's son [[Horus]]. Set then defeats Horus and takes his eyes, proclaiming himself the new king and commanding mankind to pay riches to pass into the afterlife.\n\nOne year later, with most of Egypt enslaved by Set, Zaya, a slave to Set's chief architect Urshu, gives plans for Set's pyramid to her lover, Bek. Using them, Bek infiltrates Set's treasure vault and steals one of Horus's eyes, but he and Zaya are caught by Urshu, who kills Zaya as she and Bek escape. Bek takes her body to the exiled Horus along with the eye, promising to help find the other if he brings Zaya back from the dead.\n\nThey visit the [[Solar deity#Solar vessels and Sun chariots|divine vessel]] of Horus's grandfather [[Ra]]. Neutral about the conflict with Set, and at war with the shadow beast [[Apep|Apophis]] that threatens to devour the world, Ra does not restore Horus\u2019s power, but allows him to take a vial of divine waters to weaken Set. Ra explains that Horus\u2019s loss of his powers is the result of not fulfilling his destiny, which Horus believes means avenging his parents' deaths.\n\nSet asks [[Hathor]] to take him to the underworld, but she refuses and joins up with Bek and Horus. They hatch a plan to infiltrate Set's pyramid, recruiting [[Thoth]] to solve the riddle of the guardian [[Sphinx#Egypt|sphinx]]. Overcoming the pyramid's entryway and the sphinx's riddle, they reach the source of Set's power. Before they can use the divine water they are ambushed by Set, who destroys the divine water and takes Thoth's brain, but Horus saves Hathor and Bek. Hathor calls on [[Anubis]] to take Bek to the underworld and offers her bracelet as Zaya's payment for passage to the afterlife, sacrificing herself as doing so exiles her to the underworld.\n\nAbsorbing Thoth's brain, Osiris's heart, Horus's eye and wings from [[Nephthys]], Set confronts Ra aboard his [[solar barge]]. Ra explains Set's mistreatment were tests to prepare him to take Ra's place as defender of the world against Apophis. Dismayed, Set decides to destroy the afterlife to become immortal, using his new powers to overpower Ra. Taking Ra's spear and casting him off the barge, Set frees Apophis to consume the mortal and underworld realms.\n\nAs Apophis attacks the [[Book of Gates|gate to the afterlife]] are closed. Zaya, having refused Hathor's gift for not wanting an afterlife without Bek, encourages Bek to return to the mortal world and help Horus stop Set. As Horus battles Set atop an [[obelisk]], Bek removes Horus's other eye from Set's armor, mortally wounding himself in the process and falling from the great height. Regaining his power to transform, Horus saves Bek from falling over retrieving his eye and flies him to safety, realizing that his true destiny was to protect his people. With renewed strength, Horus outmaneuvers and kills Set. Finding Ra wounded in the aether, Horus returns his spear, allowing Ra to repel Apophis and Anubis to reopen the gates.\n\nA child returns Horus's other eye and the god lays a dying Bek in Osiris's tomb beside Zaya. For his deeds, Ra offers to bestow Horus with any power, Horus asks that Bek and Zaya be brought back to life. Ra grants his wish and the other gods are restored, except Horus's parents, who had already passed into the afterlife. Horus is crowned king and declares access to the afterlife will be paid with good deeds in life. Bek is made [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|chief advisor]] and gives Horus Hathor's bracelet; Horus leaves to rescue her from the underworld.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as [[Horus]], the Egyptian God of Air and Hathor's lover<ref name=\"characters\">{{cite web | url=http://www.godsofegypt.movie/story | title=Gods of Egypt &#124; Story | work=godsofegyptmovie.com | publisher=[[Lionsgate]] | access-date=January 12, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203022231/http://www.godsofegypt.movie/story | archive-date=December 3, 2015 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as [[Set (mythology)|Set]], the Egyptian God of the Desert, brother of Osiris, husband of Nephthys.<ref name=\"characters\"/>\n* [[Brenton Thwaites]] as Bek, a  young thief who allies with Horus<ref name=\"characters\"/>\n** [[Lindsay Farris]] as the voice of an older Bek, who narrates the film\n* [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Thoth]], the Egyptian God of Wisdom<ref name=\"characters\"/>\n* [[\u00c9lodie Yung]] as [[Hathor]], the Egyptian Goddess of Love and Horus's lover<ref name=\"characters\"/>\n* [[Courtney Eaton]] as Zaya, Bek's lover<ref name=\"characters\"/>\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as [[Ra]], the Egyptian God of the Sun, father of Osiris and Seth, grandfather of Horus<ref name=\"characters\"/>\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as Urshu, Set's architect<ref name=\"characters\"/>\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as [[Osiris]], the Egyptian God of the Afterlife, who is the king of Egypt and the father of Horus, brother of Set and husband of Isis<ref name=\"characters\"/>\n* Goran D.

He cited \"creative license and artistic freedom of expression\" to cast the actors he found to fit the roles. He said \"white-washing\" was a justified concern but for his fantasy film, \"To exclude any one race in service of a hypothetical theory of historical accuracy ... would have been biased.\" Proyas said that films \"need more people of color and a greater cultural diversity\" but that ''Gods of Egypt'' \"is not the best one to soap-box issues of diversity with\". He argued that the lack of English-speaking Egyptian actors, production practicalities, the studio's requirement for box office draws, and Australia having guidelines limiting \"imported\" actors were all factors in casting for the film. He concluded, \"I attempted to show racial diversity, black, white, Asian, as far as I was allowed, as far as I could, given the limitations I was given. It is obviously clear that for things to change, for casting in movies to become more diverse many forces must align. Not just the creative.
