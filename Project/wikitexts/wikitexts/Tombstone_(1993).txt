It depicts several Western outlaws and lawmen, such as [[Wyatt Earp]], [[William Brocius]], [[Johnny Ringo]], and [[Doc Holliday]]. \n''Tombstone'' was released by [[Hollywood Pictures]] in theatrical wide release in the United States on December 25, 1993, grossing $73.2 million worldwide.

They then proceed to massacre the assembled policemen in retribution for killing two of their fellow gang members. Shortly before being shot, a local priest warns them that their acts of murder and savagery will be avenged, referencing the biblical [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|fourth horseman]].\n\nWyatt Earp, a retired peace officer with a notable reputation, reunites with his brothers [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] and [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], Arizona, where they venture on toward [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] to settle down. There they encounter Wyatt's long-time friend Doc Holliday, who is seeking relief in the dry climate from his worsening [[tuberculosis]]. [[Josephine Earp|Josephine Marcus]] and Mr. Fabian are also newly arrived with a traveling theater troupe. Meanwhile, Wyatt's common-law wife, [[Mattie Blaylock]], is becoming dependent on [[laudanum]]. Wyatt and his brothers begin to profit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon when they have their first encounter with the Cowboys.\n\nAs tensions rise, Wyatt is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys, though he is no longer a lawman. Curly Bill begins shooting at the sky after a visit to an opium den and is told by [[Fred White (marshal)|Marshal Fred White]] to relinquish his firearms. Curly Bill instead shoots the marshal dead and is forcibly taken into custody by Wyatt. The arrest infuriates [[Ike Clanton]] and the other Cowboys. Curly Bill stands trial but is found not guilty due to a lack of witnesses. Virgil, unable to tolerate lawlessness, becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits. This leads to a [[gunfight at the O.K. Corral]], in which Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers are killed. Virgil and Morgan are wounded, and the allegiance of county sheriff [[Johnny Behan]] with the Cowboys is made clear. As retribution for the Cowboy deaths, Wyatt's brothers are ambushed; Morgan is killed, while Virgil is left handicapped. A despondent Wyatt and his family leave Tombstone and board a train, with Ike Clanton and Frank Stilwell close behind, preparing to ambush them. Wyatt sees that his family leaves safely, and then surprises the assassins. He kills Stilwell but lets Clanton live to send a message: Wyatt announces that he is a U.S. marshal and that he intends to kill any man he sees wearing a red sash. Wyatt, Doc, a reformed Cowboy named [[Sherman McMasters]], [[Texas Jack Vermillion]], and [[Jack Johnson (posseman)|Turkey Creek Jack Johnson]] form a [[Earp Vendetta Ride|posse to seek revenge]].\n\nWyatt and his posse are ambushed in a riverside forest by the Cowboys. Wyatt walks into the creek, miraculously surviving the enemy fire, and kills Curly Bill along with many of his men. Curly Bill's second-in-command, [[Johnny Ringo]], becomes the new head of the Cowboys. When Doc's health worsens, the group is accommodated by [[Henry Hooker]] at his ranch. Ringo lures McMasters into the Cowboys' clutches under the pretense of parley and then sends a messenger (dragging McMasters' corpse) to tell Wyatt that he wants a showdown to end the hostilities; Wyatt agrees. Wyatt sets off for the showdown, not knowing that Doc has already arrived at the scene. Doc confronts a surprised Ringo, who was expecting Wyatt, and challenges him to a duel to finish their \"game,\" which Ringo accepts (Doc and Ringo have already had a couple of stand-offs in Tombstone that were ultimately broken up). Wyatt runs when he hears a gunshot, only to encounter Doc, who has killed Ringo. They then press on to complete their task of eliminating the Cowboys, although Clanton escapes their vengeance by renouncing his red sash. Doc is sent to a sanatorium in Colorado, where he dies of his illness. At Doc's urging, Wyatt pursues Josephine to begin a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as [[Wyatt Earp]]\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[Doc Holliday]]\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as [[Virgil Earp]]\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as [[Morgan Earp]]\n* [[Powers Boothe]] as [[William Brocius|\"Curly Bill\" Brocius]]\n* [[Michael Biehn]] as [[Johnny Ringo]]\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Henry Hooker]]\n* [[Jason Priestley]] as [[Billy Breakenridge]]\n* [[Jon Tenney]] as Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]]\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as [[Ike Clanton]]\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as [[Billy Clanton]]\n* [[Dana Delany]] as [[Josephine Earp|Josephine Marcus]]\n* [[Paula Malcomson]] as Allie Earp\n* [[Lisa Collins]] as Louisa Earp\n* [[John Philbin]] as [[Tom McLaury]]\n* [[Dana Wheeler-Nicholson]] as [[Mattie Blaylock]]\n* [[Joanna Pacu\u0142a]] as [[Big Nose Kate]]\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Sherman McMaster]]s\n* [[Harry Carey Jr.]] as Marshal [[Fred White (marshal)|Fred White]]\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Johnny Tyler\n* [[Tomas Arana]] as [[Frank Stilwell]]\n* [[Paul Ben-Victor]] as Florentino \"Indian Charlie\" Cruz \n* [[Frank Stallone]] as Ed Bailey\n* [[Robert John Burke]] as [[Frank McLaury]]\n* [[Billy Zane]] as Mr. Fabian\n* [[John Corbett]] as Johnny Barnes\n* [[Buck Taylor]] as [[Jack Johnson (posseman)|\"Turkey Creek\" Jack Johnson]]\n* [[Terry O'Quinn]] as Mayor [[John Clum]]\n* Peter Sherayko as [[Texas Jack Vermillion|John \"Texas Jack\" Vermillion]]\n* Wyatt Earp III as [[Billy Claiborne]]\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as Narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot primarily on location in Arizona.

All the mustaches in the movie were real. Val Kilmer practiced for a long time on his quick-draw speed and gave his character a [[Gentry|genteel]] [[Southern United States|Southern]] accent. Two locations were used to make the town of Tombstone look bigger. The scene in which Wyatt throws an abusive card dealer ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]) out of a saloon was to show that Wyatt was a man who used psychology to intimidate. Thornton's lines in the scene were ad-libbed, as he was only told to \"be a bully\".<ref name=\"DVD\">[[George P. Cosmatos|Cosmatos, George P.]] et al.

[[James Berardinelli]] writing for [[ReelViews]] offered a negative review, recalling how he thought, \"The first half of ''Tombstone'' isn't an example of great filmmaking, but it is engaging. There's a sense of growing inevitability as events build to the shoot-out at the OK Corral. The melodramatic \"serious\" moments are kept to a minimum, and the various gunfights are choreographed with style and tension. Then, at the one-hour ten-minute mark, the Clanton gang and the Earps square off. From there, things get progressively worse. Not only is the last hour anticlimactic, but it's dull. Too many scenes feature lengthy segments of poorly-scripted dialogue, and, in some cases, character motivation becomes unclear. The gunplay is more repetitious than exciting. The result\u2014a cobbled-together morass of silly lines and shoot-outs\u2014doesn't work well.\"<ref name=\"Berard\">{{Cite web |last=Berardinelli |first=James |author-link=James Berardinelli |date=December 25, 1993 |title=Review: Tombstone |url=https://preview.reelviews.net/movies/t/tombstone.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224091256/https://preview.reelviews.net/movies/t/tombstone.html |archive-date=February 24, 2021 |access-date=March 17, 2011 |website=[[ReelViews]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Holden]] writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' saw the film as being a \"capacious Western with many modern touches, the Arizona boom town and site of the legendary O.K.
