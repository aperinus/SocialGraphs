The screenplay, written by [[Gregory Allen Howard]], is based on the true story of coach [[Herman Boone]], portrayed by [[Denzel Washington]], and his attempt to integrate the T. C. Williams High School (now [[Alexandria City High School]]) football team in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]], in 1971. [[Will Patton]] portrays Bill Yoast, Boone's assistant coach. Real-life athletes [[Gerry Bertier]] and Julius Campbell are portrayed by [[Ryan Hurst]] and [[Wood Harris]], respectively.\n\nThe film was co-produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer|Jerry Bruckheimer Films]] and released by [[Buena Vista Pictures Distribution|Buena Vista Pictures]]. On September 19, 2000, the film's soundtrack was released by [[Walt Disney Records]]. It features songs by several recording artists including [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Hollies]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[James Taylor]], [[The Temptations]], and [[Cat Stevens]].\n\n''Remember the Titans'' had a budget of $30 million and premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on September 29, 2000. It grossed an estimated $115.6 million in the U.S., and $136.7 million worldwide.

C. Williams High School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], [[Herman Boone]], a black head coach who was supposed to lead the black high school's football team, is assigned to the coaching staff under current white head coach Bill Yoast, who previously led the white high school and has been nominated for the Virginia High School Hall of Fame. In an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that, despite racial segregation in public schools [[Brown v. Board of Education|now long since abolished]], all other high schools are \"white only\", the school district decides to change course and name Boone the head coach. He refuses, believing it unfair to Yoast, but relents after seeing what it means to the black community. Yoast is then offered an assistant coach's job by the school board and initially refuses but reconsiders after the white players pledge to boycott the team if he does not participate. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and takes up the position of defensive coordinator under Boone, to his daughter Sheryl's dismay.\n\nSoon after, the black students trying out for the team have a meeting in the gymnasium with Boone, but this turns into a fiasco when Yoast and several white students interrupt it. After this, Boone takes Yoast aside and explains how he will run the team and that black and white does not matter to him, leaving Yoast with renewed faith in Boone. On August 15, the players gather and journey to [[Gettysburg College]], where their training takes place. Early on, the black and white team members frequently clash in racially motivated conflicts, including some between captains Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell. However, through forceful coaching and rigorous athletic training by Boone\u2014which includes an early morning run to the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] and a motivational speech\u2014the team achieves racial harmony and comes out a unified team. After returning from football camp, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be dismissed. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice before slowly gaining support from the community. Gerry even has his best friend Ray removed from the team because of his racism following a game where Ray intentionally missed a block which consequently led to the near-season-ending injury of starting quarterback Jerry \"Rev\" Harris.\n\nJust before the state semi-finals, Yoast is told by the chairman of the school board that he will be inducted into the Hall of Fame after the Titans lose one game, implying he wants Boone to be dismissed. During the game, it becomes apparent that the referees are biased against the Titans; upon seeing the chairman and other board members in the audience looking on with satisfaction, Yoast realizes that they have rigged the game. He then marches onto the field and warns the head referee that, if not officiated fairly, he will go to the press and expose the scandal. After this, the Titans soon shut out their opponents and advance to the state championship, but Yoast is told by the infuriated chairman that his actions in saving Boone's job have resulted in his loss of candidacy for Hall of Fame induction.\n\nWhile celebrating the victory, Bertier is severely injured in a car accident when he drives through an intersection against an oncoming truck; the Titans wait in the hospital for his recovery. Although Bertier is now unable to play due to being paralyzed from the waist down, the team goes on to mount a comeback in the fourth quarter and win the state championship. Bertier would remain a paraplegic for the rest of his life.\n\nTen years later, Bertier dies in another automobile accident caused by a drunk driver after having won the gold medal in [[shot put]] in the [[Paralympic Games]]. It is then revealed that it is his funeral the former football coaches and players are attending, where Julius, while holding the hand of Bertier's mother, leads the team in a mournful rendition of \"[[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye]].\"\n\nIn the epilogue, descriptions show the players' and coaches' activities after the events in 1971. Coach Boone coached the Titans for five more seasons, and later retired, and Coach Yoast would assist Boone for four more years, retiring from coaching in 1990. The two coaches became good friends. After Bertier's death, the gymnasium at T.C. Williams High was renamed after him. Julius would work for the city of Alexandria and remain friends with Bertier until his death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as [[Herman Boone]]\n* [[Will Patton]] as Bill Yoast\n* [[Wood Harris]] as Julius Campbell\n* [[Ryan Hurst]] as [[Gerry Bertier]]\n* [[Donald Faison]] as Petey Jones\n* [[Craig Kirkwood]] as Jerry \"Rev\" Harris\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Louie Lastik\n* [[Kip Pardue]] as [[Ronnie Bass|Ronnie \"Sunshine\" Bass]]\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Sheryl Yoast\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Alan Bosley\n* [[Burgess Jenkins]] as Ray Budds\n* [[Nicole Ari Parker]] as Carol Boone\n* [[Kate Bosworth]] as Emma Hoyt\n* Earl C.

Practice scenes were filmed at Clarkston High School in [[Clarkston, Georgia|Clarkston Georgia]]. All home games were filmed in [[Dallas, Georgia]] at Paulding County High School. Additionally, some of the championship game scenes were filmed at the [[Sprayberry High School]] football stadium in East Marietta, Georgia.\n\n===Historical accuracy===\n{{More citations needed\n|section| date = July 2016\n}}\n\nAs with any movie that is not a [[documentary film]] but is rather \"based on a true story\", it has strayed from the actual events that had occurred on many occasions to add new dramatic elements of teamwork, commitment, and friendship to the film.\n\n* Alexandria Schools were racially integrated in 1965, and T.C. Williams was created by merging three racially integrated schools.<ref>Shapiro, Len; Pollin, Andy (December 16, 2008). The Great Book of Washington DC Sports Lists.

However, despite the movie showing multiple close games, most games were actually blowouts, with 9 of their thirteen wins being [[shutout]]s.<ref name=\":0\">The Titans had a solid football team for many years after 1971 and won most of their games by large margins. \n{{Cite web|url=http://www.chasingthefrog.com/reelfaces/rememberthetitans.php|title=Remember the Titans True Story - Real Gerry Bertier, Bill Yoast, Herman Boone|website=ChasingtheFrog.com|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>\n* In the movie, Coach Boone states, \"We are not like all the other schools in this conference, they're all white. They don't have to worry about race. We do.\" This is false as well; all the schools the Titans faced were integrated years before.\n* While the team is at camp, it shows Coach Boone waking them up at three in the morning to go for a run. This did not occur; neither did his speech at Gettysburg.<ref name=\":0\" /> The team did go on a tour of Gettysburg, although it was not as dramatic as portrayed in the film. In the film on the tour of Gettysburg, Coach Boone said it was the scene where 50,000 men died. There were approximately 46,000 casualties and 8,000 deaths in this battle.\n* Ronnie \"Sunshine\" Bass was far from being the only one with long hair at the time. Even Gerry Bertier had long hair. But in interviews Bass said \"I'll say for the record my hair was never that long.\" He also says the kiss with Gerry never happened.\n* The climax of the movie is a fictionalized 1971 AAA state championship football game between T. C. Williams and [[George C. Marshall High School]]. The dramatic license taken in the movie was to convert what was actually a mid-season match-up between T. C. Williams and Marshall into a made-for-Hollywood state championship. In reality, the Marshall game was the toughest game T. C. Williams played all year. As depicted in the movie, the real Titans won the Marshall game on a fourth down come-from-behind play at the very end of the game. The actual state championship (against [[Andrew Lewis High School]] of [[Salem, Virginia|Salem]]) was a 27\u20130 blowout, played at [[Victory Stadium]] in [[Roanoke, VA]].<ref name=tlfbc>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-bdjAAAAIBAJ&pg=2448%2C47580569 |newspaper=Observer-Reporter |location=Washington, MA |last=Rose |first=Tom |title=This legendary football coach won't forget the Titans |date=November 24, 2002 |page=C1}}</ref>\n* Bertier's car accident took place on December 11, 1971, after (rather than a few days before) the season-ending State Championship game. Bertier had been at a banquet honoring the team for their undefeated season. After the banquet, Bertier borrowed his mother's new [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)#1971|1971 Chevrolet Camaro]]. Bertier lost control of the Camaro and crashed (the movie shows him getting broadsided). The cause of the accident was determined to be a mechanical failure in the engine mounts.<ref name=tlfbc/>\n* The \"where are they now\", shown during the film's closing credits, omits the fact that Sheryl Yoast died in 1996 of an undetected heart condition at the age of 34, and that she was ''not'' an only child as she had three sisters. Her oldest sister Bonnie was in college, her second oldest Angela went to a different high school, and her younger sister Deidre was only three years old in 1971.\n* The \"where are they now\" also omits the primary cause of Boone's retirement: He was fired from the school due to allegations of player abuse and coach complaints.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadspin.com/remember-the-titans-is-a-lie-and-this-man-wants-you-to-1609473834|title=Remember The Titans Is A Lie, And This Man Still Wants You To Know It|website=Deadspin}}</ref><ref name=\"WAPO\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1979/06/02/boone-axed-at-williams/dfb9ba46-620a-49c5-8957-a28f166509ac/|title=Boone Axed At Williams|last=Huff|first=Donald|date=June 2, 1979|work=The Washington Post|access-date=September 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nOn September 19, 2000, the soundtrack was released by [[Walt Disney Records]]. The film score was orchestrated by musician [[Trevor Rabin]] and features music composed by various artists. From the instrumental score, Rabin's track \"Titans Spirit\", was the only cue (of the 12 composed) added to the soundtrack. It is also the only piece of music on the soundtrack album not to have been previously released.\n\n\"Titans Spirit\" is a seven-minute instrumental. It has been used on numerous sports telecasts, particularly those on [[NBC]], which has utilized the score during its [[closing credits]] for each [[Olympic Games]] since 2002, as well as the final closing credits montage ending their 12-year [[NBA on NBC|run of NBA coverage]] in 2002. The song was also played as veteran [[New York Mets]] players crossed home plate during the closing ceremonies at [[Shea Stadium]], and as the [[New York Yankees]] were awarded their rings from their [[2009 World Series]] championship. The [[New Jersey Devils]] also used this song during the jersey number retirement ceremonies for [[Scott Stevens]], [[Ken Daneyko]], [[Scott Niedermayer]], [[Martin Brodeur]] and [[Patrik Eli\u00e1\u0161]]. In 2018, at the conclusion of the [[2018 Stanley Cup playoffs|Stanley Cup playoffs]], the song was used during the [[Washington Capitals]]' [[Stanley Cup]] celebration as captain [[Alexander Ovechkin]] lifted the Cup in [[Las Vegas]].\n\nIt was also used during the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] to accompany the celebration and fireworks at [[Invesco Field]] after future president [[Barack Obama]] gave his nomination acceptance speech, and was also used immediately following [[Barack Obama election victory speech 2008|his victory speech]] upon winning the [[US Presidential Election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1856561,00.html?iid=tsmodule | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108054818/http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1856561,00.html?iid=tsmodule | url-status=dead | archive-date=November 8, 2008 | work=Time | title=Barack Obama Wins Big: 'Change Has Come to America' | date=November 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Remember the Titans: An Original Walt Disney Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = film\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = September 19, 2000\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[R&B]], [[pop rock]]\n| length     = 46:21\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = ''Remember the Titans: An Original Walt Disney Motion Picture Soundtrack''\n| total_length    = 46:21\n| title1          = [[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]\n| length1         = 2:23\n| title2          = [[Spirit in the Sky]]\n| length2         = 4:02\n| title3          = [[Peace Train]]\n| length3         = 4:08\n| title4          = [[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye]]\n| length4         = 4:05\n| title5          = [[Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress]]\n| length5         = 3:17\n| title6          = [[I Want to Take You Higher]]\n| length6         = 2:44\n| title7          = [[Up Around the Bend]]\n| length7         = 2:42\n| title8          = [[Spill the Wine]]\n| length8         = 4:05\n| title9          = [[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\n| length9         = 5:10\n| title10         = [[Act Naturally]]\n| length10        = 2:21\n| title11         = [[Express Yourself (Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band song)|Express Yourself]]\n| length11        = 3:53\n| title12         = Titans Spirit\n| length12        = 7:25\n}}\n\n==Release==\n\nFollowing its release in theaters, the [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[widescreen]] and [[Pan and scan]] edition of the motion picture was released on VHS and DVD in the United States on March 20, 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dvd-remember-the-titans-denzel-washington/4426547?ean=786936156232 |title=Remember the Titans (2000) - DVD Widescreen |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]] |access-date=March 6, 2013}}</ref> A Special Edition widescreen format of the film was released on March 20, 2001, along with a widescreen Director's cut on March 14, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dvd-remember-the-titans-denzel-washington/4426547?ean=786936701852 |title=Remember the Titans All Available Formats & Editions |publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]] |access-date=March 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA restored widescreen hi-definition [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] version was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on September 4, 2007.
