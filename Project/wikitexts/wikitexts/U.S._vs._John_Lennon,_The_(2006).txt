The film also details the attempts by the Nixon administration to deport Lennon from the US to end his anti-war and anti-Nixon campaigns. The film had its world premiere at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and its North American premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].  It was released in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles, California]] on 15 September 2006, and had a nationwide release on 29 September. A [[The U.S. vs. John Lennon (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] composed of John Lennon tracks was released by [[Capitol Records]] and [[EMI]] on 26 September 2006.\n\nThe film makes extensive use of archival footage of Lennon and [[Yoko Ono]], and includes an interview conducted by anti-war reporter [[Gloria Emerson]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121026094702/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-136457138.html Lions Gate tunes in Lennon documentary], ''[[Daily Variety]]'', September 2, 2005.</ref>\n\nThe U.K. release was on December 8, 2006, 26 years to the day after the death of John Lennon. The DVD was released on February 13, 2007 in the United States. The film made its [[cable television]] debut in the U.S. on August 18, 2007 on [[VH1 Classic]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nThe film explores the political activism that Lennon became strongly involved in with the Beatles, and after the band ended.\n\nJohn Lennon is established as being a potential political threat to the American government, and therefore much of the film covers the theme of 'silencing' him and other popular figures that became involved in anti-war activism. Throughout the film the audience can see both sides of the situation: the audience sees the protests and events Lennon and Yoko Ono organised, such as the famous \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\" rally and concepts such as [[bagism]] and [[bed-in|bed peace]].\n\nWe also see the increasing fear experienced by the US government and [[CIA]]. This build-up of paranoia and fear for control led to the eventual [[deportation]] notice sent to John Lennon's house, informing him that 'his temporary stay in the USA was now over'. The film debunks and exposes the somewhat bizarre behaviour of the CIA and police department over John Lennon and other contemporary figures' behaviour, referring also to different modern issues like [[drug abuse]].\n\nThe film features a montage of various mediums. There are videos of performances of songs and interviews of Lennon at the time, recordings of Yoko Ono both present and from the late 1960s and 1970s, as well as a basic story structure of retelling the story of John Lennon's attempts to spread a message of [[peace]] around the United States and, on a wider scale, the entire [[Western world]] during the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nThe DVD \"Extras\" contain a further 54 minutes of interview segments within ten topic sections, the highlight with Yoko Ono reading her letter written in 2000, to the Parole Board, whom at the time were considering the case of John Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[John Lennon]]\n*[[Tariq Ali]]\n*[[Carl Bernstein]]\n*[[Noam Chomsky]]\n*[[Walter Cronkite]]\n*[[Mario Cuomo]]\n*[[Angela Davis]]\n*[[John Dean]]\n*[[David Fenton]]\n*[[Ron Kovic]]\n*[[G.
