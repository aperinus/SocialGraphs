She was abandoned by her birth parents and then spent most of her childhood being raised by Stanley ([[S.A. Griffin]]), a foster father who never really loved Lisa after her adopted mother died.\n\nOne day, Lisa gets word that Stanley has died. Alone in her apartment, after attempting to feed her now dead pet fish, she breaks down and cries uncontrollably. The next day at work, Lisa gets an unexpected delivery of flowers from a secret admirer. Puzzled, she presses the delivery man for information on who might have sent her the flowers. He says the sender wants to remain anonymous. Lisa asks her friends for names and visits the flower shop to no avail.\n\nAfter getting to know each other better, the florist confesses that he sent them. Lewis ([[Christian Slater]]) runs a flower shop and often takes long walks through the neighborhood at night, trying to lose memories of his deceased wife and child. He saw Lisa crying in her window and hoped the roses would cheer her up. Before long, Lisa and Lewis begin dating but each has emotional issues to resolve before their story can have a happy ending.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Lewis Farrell<ref name=Ebert />\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Lisa Walker<ref name=Ebert />\n* [[Pamela Adlon]] as Kim (Credited as Pamela Segall)<ref name=Ebert />\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Danny<ref name=Ebert />\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Mrs. Farrell\n* [[Mary Alice]] as Alice\n* [[Desiree Casado]] as Amelia\n* [[Kenneth Cranham]] as Simon\n* [[Ally Walker]] as Wendy\n* [[S.A.
