It was [[Screenwriter|written]] and [[Film director|directed]] by [[Kazuaki Kiriya]]. It is one of only a few films (''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Immortal (2004 film)|Immortal]]'' (both 2004) and ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005), among others) to be shot entirely on a \"[[digital backlot]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nA fifty-year war between the Eastern Federation and Europa ends, with the Federation taking control of the continent of [[Eurasia]]. A [[resistance movement]] rises in Zone 7 and the Federation mobilizes its military. However, the war and heavy industry have exhausted the Federation and polluted the [[Natural environment|environment]].\n\nDr. Azuma presents his discovery of [[Stem Cell|Neo Cells]], human cells that, in theory, can be converted to regenerate human tissue.  The Neo Cells are only found in the [[genome]] of \"a primitive ethnic group.\" He states that he can develop the Neo Cells for human use, but is quickly denounced. But Kaoru Naito, from Nikko Hairal Inc., offers Dr. Azuma sponsorship. Azuma is persuaded when Naito insinuates that accepting will also help Dr. Azuma cure his wife, Midori.\n\nA photo shoot at the Azuma Residence follows, commemorating Tetsuya's (Azuma's son) engagement to his girlfriend, Luna. They argue about Tetsuya joining the military. One year later, Tetsuya is deployed to Eurasia Zone 7. He kills civilians, and is killed by a [[booby trap]].\n\nAzuma invites Luna's father, Dr. Kozuki, to his lab. They are rivals, since Azuma's cell research makes Kozuki's armor research redundant. However, although organs have been grown from the Neo Cells, they are not usable. Meanwhile, Midori, now almost blind, is visited by Tetsuya's [[ghost]]. Shortly after she is told of his death. His body is sent to Azuma's lab.\n\nTetsuya's ghost sees the body. A lightning bolt strikes the facility and stimulates the Neo Cells, causing the limbs and organs to restructure  into humans. Naito calls for the military to kill them. But a few escape and encounter Midori in her car, which they hijack.\n\nAzuma carries Tetsuya's body into his lab. Tetsuya is [[Resurrection|resurrected]], but his condition is unstable, and he is brought to Kozuki's residence.  Kozuki puts him in prototype battle armor.\n\nThe Neo humans travel to Zone 7, sheltering in a derelict castle, where they discover a robot army. Calling themselves \"Neo-Sapiens,\" they vow revenge and reactivate the robots to wage war upon humanity.\n\nKozuki's residence is attacked and Tetsuya is awakened. He kills a female Neo-Sapien, Saguree, but cannot save Kozuki. He escapes with Luna but is confronted by a robot battalion. After eliminating them, Tetsuya battles the leader, Burai, only to lose consciousness. When he comes to, he and Luna go to Zone Seven, but the route is [[contaminated]], and Luna falls ill.\n\nTetsuya is found in the forest by a doctor and led to a nearby village in Zone Seven, where the doctor treats Luna. It is revealed the people of Zone Seven aren't terrorists at all, but have been slaughtered for decades because of the government's discriminatory policies. The doctor, in conversation, informs Tetsuya of a local legend of a protective deity named \"Casshern\"-a deity whose statue makes numerous appearances in the movie. Tetsuya fights Barashin as the village comes under attack by the military and Neo-sapiens, and it is here that he first refers to himself as Casshern. While both suffer injuries in the fight, Casshern is the victor and Barashin is killed. Fighting Barashin has caused Tetsuya to lose Luna, who escaped with a non-verbal Neo-sapien and eventually found her way to a train full of captured villagers from Zone Seven. Here, Luna and the Neo-sapien are confronted by a bereaved scientist who blames the Neo-Sapiens for the loss of his daughter. Luna is rescued by Dr. Azuma, but the Neo-Sapien is injured.\n\nA [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] takes place and General Kamijo's son takes over, while in the laboratory Naito reveals that Neo Cells are not what they seem. The Neo Cells were acquired from the slaughtered \"original humans\" of Zone Seven for the purposes of prolonging General Kamijo and his cohorts' lives, and the Neo Cell culture did not in fact create the Neo-Sapiens. It simply rejoined the body parts that were harvested from the victims of Zone Seven after being struck by the stone lightning bolt. Even though Dr. Azuma had been spearheading the macabre experiments, he is unable to explain what has happened. As they talk, the stone lightning bolt crumbles and Casshern appears to fall from the sky into the laboratory, which is now in ruins.\n\nBurai arrives with an airship and abducts Luna, Casshern and the dying Neo-Sapien, leaving a now fatally wounded Naito, Dr. Azuma and General Kamijo's son alone. Burai gives his reasons for hating humanity, and Casshern finds his mother, but she's apparently dead. Burai launches a giant machine that appears to be set to self-destruct, which slaughters countless soldiers. Casshern uses all his strength to stop the machine, although it still detonates, albeit away from any urban or heavily populated area.\n\nIn the finale, the General's son kills Burai with a grenade after revealing he was human all along, and it is learned that Tetsuya, during his military service, slaughtered Burai's family. Casshern stops his father from resurrecting his mother, so Dr. Azuma retaliates by shooting Luna in the head. Luna is revived by the blood of Burai, only after Casshern kills his father.  The souls of the dead come onto Casshern as he and Luna embrace each other.  Luna rips out Tetsuya's containment suit and a pillar of light fires through space and crashing down onto another planet. The film ends with a montage of the characters in happier times.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Yusuke Iseya]] as Tetsuya Azuma/Casshern\n*[[Kumiko As\u014d]] as Luna Kozuki\n*[[Akira Terao]] as Professor Kotaro Azuma\n*[[Kanako Higuchi]] as Midori Azuma\n*[[Fumiyo Kohinata]] as Professor Kozuki\n*[[Hiroyuki Miyasako]] as Akubon\n*[[Jun Kaname]] as Barashin\n*[[Hidetoshi Nishijima (actor)|Hidetoshi Nishijima]] as Lieutenant-Colonel Kamijo\n*[[Mitsuhiro Oikawa]] as Kaoru Naito\n*[[Susumu Terajima]] as Sakamoto\n*[[Hideji \u014ctaki]] as President Kamijo\n*[[Tatsuya Mihashi]] as Professor Furoi\n*[[Toshiaki Karasawa]] as Burai\n*[[Ry\u014d (actress)|Ry\u014d]] as San Ikegami\n*[[Mayumi Sada]] as Saguree\n*[[Tetsuji Tamayama]]\n*[[Gor\u014d Naya]] as Narrator\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is loosely based on a 1973 [[anime]] television series, ''[[Casshan|Shinz\u014d Ningen Kyash\u0101n]]'' (translated as \"Neo-Human Casshern\" and known as just ''Casshan'' in the United States) from animation studio Tatsunoko Productions.

The US release is a full 24 minutes shorter than the original. It features both a [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 and [[Dolby Digital]] stereo Japanese soundtrack, as well as English subtitles. The subtitles are almost universally criticized by fans for being enormously incomplete. On several occasions they are lacking entirely; when they do appear they often completely differ from the dialogue or oversimplify it to such a degree that key plot elements and the overall force of the story are diminished.\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[Casshan|''Casshern'' (anime)]]\n* ''[[Casshern Sins]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0405821|title=Casshern}}\n* {{Amg movie|303671|Casshern}}\n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Shamoon | first1 = D. | doi = 10.1353/mec.0.0039 | title = If Casshern Doesn't Do It, Who Will? | journal = Mechademia | volume = 4 | pages = 323\u2013326 | year = 2009 | doi-access = free }}\n\n{{Casshern}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese superhero films]]\n[[Category:Casshern]]\n[[Category:2000s dystopian films]]\n[[Category:Go Fish Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Shir\u014d Sagisu]]\n[[Category:Japanese post-apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:Japanese science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Shochiku films]]\n[[Category:Tokusatsu films]]\n[[Category:Resurrection in film]]\n[[Category:2004 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Live-action films based on animated series]]\n[[Category:Films about coups d'\u00e9tat]]\n[[Category:Japanese films about revenge]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
