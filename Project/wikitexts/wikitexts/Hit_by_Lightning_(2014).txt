Seth is constantly trying to get him to be his wingman.\n\nTearing him away from his two black cats and hockey on TV, Ricky and Seth go to his restaurant, trying to pick up women by pretending to be looking for actresses for an upcoming film. Going to the wedding of the only other guy from their class who hadn't married, Ricky asks god to find him someone before he's hit by lightning or killed by terrorists.\n\nSoon after Ricky sees a pop-up ad for E-Happily, he spontaneously signs up. The next day, the 27 y.o. busboy tells him he met his fianc\u00e9e on the same site. Finally getting a response to his profile, he meets with Seth, telling him he found a match although admittedly he has no idea what she looks like.\n\nSkeptical, Seth goes to the restaurant where Ricky is meeting Danita. They get along well, she appreciates his humor, is also a cat person, they both like hockey and have similar interests. He finally feels he has met his ideal woman ([[St\u00e9phanie Szostak]]).\nThey sleep together, and she tells him he was the only person willing to meet her without a photo.\n\nSeth shows up at Ricky's, seeking details. Shocked, he reiterates that Danita's a ten, and he's a four, so she must have a major flaw. Meeting for lunch, when he says she's perfect, she runs off, upset. Ten days later he's still in a funk. Seth tries to get him to go out and prowl.\n\nFinally Danita calls. Meeting for lunch, she tells Ricky she signed up to E-Happily because of his profile, his openness. However, one significant problem arises: she's been miserably married for nine years to an obsessive, abusive husband ([[Jed Rees]]), so she says she can never see him again.\n\nDanita invites Ricky to an open-air screening of a movie in the cemetery. She doesn't want to stop seeing him, so she states matter-of-factly that they must kill her husband so they can be together. Ricky is so smitten he agrees.\n\nVisiting Seth at work, Ricky tells him about needing to kill Danita's obsessive husband. He insists they rewatch ''Body Heat'', so Ricky rethinks doing it. As it doesn't work, upon Seth's insistence, they go to the ex-rabbi turned author Ben's book signing which doesn't dissuade Ricky either.\n\nFinally, Seth convinces Ricky to go and spy on the couple, as he has seen they go to a nearby restaurant chain every Saturday night. Recognizing Seth from the book signing, Ben invites them to join their table for dinner. When told Ricky has an unfinished novel, he offers to read it. Later on, Danita calls Ricky and upon discovering the guys went to spy on them, she hangs up, disappointed.\n\nSeth signs up to E-Happily, and soon gets engaged. Meanwhile, Danita shows at Ricky's, confessing she may have initially planned to use him to murder Ben, but had sincerely fallen for him. Upset, he asks her to leave. Then, he asks her to swear on one of her cats that she loves him.\n\nThey plan on getting Ricky into their house under the guise of Ben proofing his book. Danita mentions the plot of the book is based the actual story of him killing his first wife. After dinner, Ben takes them on a drive to the cemetery, as he had spied on them there when they saw the movie there together. Both men pull their guns, but Ricky shoots him dead when Ben barrages him with insults.\n\nSeth turns up to help dispose of the body. For the next two weeks Danita and Ricky secretly meet up in the catholic church, the suddenly she leaves town. Nine months later, Ricky's cop cousin tells him a mass murderer confessed to killing Ben Jacobs. Again at the cemetery movie showing, Danita shows up, explaining she left because the police wouldn't leave her alone. The serial killer news brought her back.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as Ricky Miller\n* [[Will Sasso]] as Seth\n* [[St\u00e9phanie Szostak]] as Danita Jacobs\n* [[Jed Rees]] as Rabbi Ben Jacobs\n* [[Chantal Chamandy]] as Tracey\n* Alexis Maitland as Ashlee\n* Richard Roy Sutton as Dylan\n\n==Production==\nWhen interviewed by [[CJAD]] radio of [[Montreal]], Chantal Chamandy spoke toward the production of this film. One year after creation of her production company Chantal Chamandy Entertainment, Chamandy began production on the film ''Hit By Lightning''. The film was shot over a 17-day period during summer 2013 in a studio in metro Ottawa, locations through the city, as well as locations in Los Angeles. The film was budgeted at [[Can$]]1 million provided by private funding and through [[Telefilm Canada]], and had no cost overruns. Ricky Blitt had written the script and was invited to Montreal by Chamandy to direct the film as his directorial debut. Jon Cryer was production's first choice for the lead role, and he accepted the role after discussing the script with Blitt.<ref name=\"Hollywood Trend Report\"/> The film is described by Cryer as \"sort of a mixture of ''[[Body Heat]]'' meets ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]''.<ref name=\"Global News\"/>\n\n{{blockquote|1=What I loved about the script was that it was a romantic comedy with a new twist. It's a really sweet story but it has a real darkness to it. I haven't done a romantic comedy in a long, long time and it took a lovely script to make me do this kind of thing again|2=Jon Cryer<ref name=\"Hollywood Trend Report\"/>}}\n\nWill Sasso was production's first choice for the supporting role of Seth. After he and Cryer had met and discussed it, they clicked and he also came immediately aboard. Casting was completed within six months. To take advantage of Canadian tax credits, most of the project was filmed in Ottawa, and post-production and music scoring was done in Montreal.\n<ref name=CJAD>{{cite news|last1=Rand|first1=Aaron|title=CJAD speaks with 'Hit By Lightning' Producer Chantal Chamandy|url=https://soundcloud.com/hit-by-lightning/cjad-speaks-with-hit-by|access-date=August 20, 2014|format=radio interview|publisher=[[CJAD]]|date=July 22, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Hollywood Trend Report\">{{cite news|last1=Shatilla|first1=Ann|title=On Cryer in Starring Role in the New Romantic Comedy ''Hit By Lightning'' Opening Oct 31|url=http://www.hollywoodtrendreport.com/categories/tvtrends.html|access-date=August 20, 2014|work=Hollywood Trend Report|date=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821172117/http://www.hollywoodtrendreport.com/categories/tvtrends.html|archive-date=August 21, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Hit By Lightning festival banner.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Film's banner poster at the [[Just For Laughs Festival]]]]\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Just For Laughs Festival]] on July 23, 2014 in [[Montreal]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=staff|title=Hit By Lightning \u2013 Film World Premiere|url=http://comedypro.hahaha.com/Category/jon-cryer/|website=hahaha.com|publisher=[[Just For Laughs Festival]]|date=July 9, 2014|access-date=August 20, 2014}}</ref> and is slated for [[Video on demand|VOD]] release in both Canada and the United States on October 31, 2014.<ref name=\"Journal International\">{{cite news|last1=Benjebria|first1=Laurine|title=Hit by Lightning, la com\u00e9die qui se moque des clich\u00e9s hollywoodiens|url=http://www.lejournalinternational.fr/Hit-by-Lightning-la-comedie-qui-se-moque-des-cliches-hollywoodiens_a1977.html|access-date=August 20, 2014|language=French|work=Le Journal International|date=July 30, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Hollywood Trend Report\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 11% of nine surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 3.1/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hit_by_lightning/|title=Hit By Lightning (2014)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=May 7, 2020}}</ref>  [[Metacritic]] rated it 31/100 based on eight reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hit-by-lightning|title=Hit by Lightning|work=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=November 30, 2014}}</ref>  Sheri Linden of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it \"a flat, awkward mashup\" of [[romantic comedy]] and [[thriller (genre)|thriller]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/hit-by-lightning-film-review-740133|title='Hit by Lightning': Film Review|last=Linden|first=Sheri|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 28, 2014|access-date=November 30, 2014}}</ref>  Ben Kenigsberg of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as \"a laugh-deprived ''Seinfeld'' episode\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/movies/hit-by-lightning-directed-by-ricky-blitt.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0|title=The Perils of Online Dating|last=Kenigsberg|first=Ben|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 30, 2014|access-date=November 30, 2014}}</ref>  Martin Tsai of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that it \"manages to make dark comedy fresh by combining two formulas.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hit-by-lightning-movie-review-20141031-story.html|title=Review 'Hit by Lightning' fuses comedy with film noir|last=Tsai|first=Martin|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 30, 2014|access-date=November 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|2402619}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hit By Lightning}}\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n[[Category:2014 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2010s comedy thriller films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy thriller films]]\n[[Category:Canadian black comedy films]]\n[[Category:Canadian romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Canadian comedy thriller films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ottawa]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:2014 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]\n[[Category:2010s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
