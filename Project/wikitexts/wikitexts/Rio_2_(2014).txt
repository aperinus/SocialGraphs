It is the sequel to the 2011 [[computer-animated]] film ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' and the second installment of the ''Rio'' franchise. The title refers to the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], where the first film was set and ''Rio 2'' begins, though most of its plot occurs in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. The film stars [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[will.i.am]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[George Lopez]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[Rodrigo Santoro]], and [[Jake T. Austin]] reprising their roles from the first film with new members including [[Bruno Mars]], [[Andy Garcia]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Rachel Crow]], [[Kristin Chenoweth]], [[Amandla Stenberg]], [[Pierce Gagnon]], and [[Miguel Ferrer]] (in his final theatrical film before his death in 2017).\n\n''Rio 2'' was released internationally on March 20, 2014,<ref name=Cast /> and on April 11, 2014,<ref name=\"Cast\" /> in American theaters by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $498 million worldwide, against a production budget of $103 million, and received mixed reviews from critics, garnering praise for the animation, voice acting and songs, but criticism for the story and writing. The film is dedicated to the memory of screenwriter [[Don Rhymer]], who died on November 28, 2012. This was Blue Sky Studios' first and only follow-up film outside the [[Ice Age (franchise)|''Ice Age'']] franchise. This was also the final ''Rio'' film to be produced by Blue Sky Studios before its closure on April 10, 2021.<ref name=\"Deadline0902\" /> A third film is in development.<ref name=\"rio3\" />\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\n{{Long plot|date=August 2022}}\nThree years after the events of the [[Rio (2011 film)|first film]],  Blu and Jewel are raising their three children \u2014 Carla, Bia, and Tiago \u2014 in the city but Jewel is disappointed to see her children becoming too domesticated like their father. Meanwhile, Linda and Tulio are on an expedition in the Amazon and, after a fall down a waterfall, discover a Spix's macaw that loses one of its feathers. When words about the encounter were broadcast through television, Jewel believes that they should go to the Amazon to help find the blue macaws. While the kids are ecstatic, Blu is uncertain, but he is pressured into going along. Rafael, Nico and Pedro also decide to come along to scout talent for Carnival. Luiz tries to follow, but is unknowingly left behind by the birds. Blu brings a [[fanny pack]] full of supplies, including a [[Satellite navigation device|GPS]], much to Jewel's chagrin.\n\nBig Boss, the leader of a group of [[illegal logging|illegal loggers]], discovers Linda and Tulio's expedition to find the macaws and orders his henchmen to hunt them down. At the same time, Nigel plots to exact revenge on Blu along with his new comrades, an [[anteater]] named Charlie and a [[poison dart frog]] named Gabi. After they arrive at the jungle, Blu, his family, and their friends initially find nothing. However, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in an uncharted section of the Amazon. There, Jewel is reunited with her long-lost father, Eduardo, paternal aunt Mimi, and childhood friend, Roberto. Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blu, but thanks him for bringing Jewel back home. Having lost their previous habitat to arson from the illegal loggers Eduardo is anti-human, and  brushes off Blu's suggestion to expose the sanctuary to Linda and Tulio to ensure their protection.\n\nWhile searching for the macaws, Linda and Tulio are eventually captured by the loggers. Meanwhile, Blu does his best to fit in with the flock, as his family are doing, but his continued reliance on human tools prevent him from connecting with anyone. Meanwhile, in another attempt to get closer to Blu, a disguised Nigel wins a talent show to become a performer for a Carnival show that Rafael, Pedro, Nico and Carla are hosting. When Blu tries to pick a Brazilian nut for Jewel, he accidentally tries to get it in the territory of the Spix macaw's enemies, the [[scarlet macaw]]s, led by the hostile Felipe. Blu inadvertently causes war between the two tribes for food when he accidentally swats Felipe with a branch. The war turns out to be a [[Association football|football (soccer)]] match, but Blu accidentally costs the flock their territory when he scores on his team's own goal.\n\nAfter an argument with Jewel, Blu ultimately decides that he will leave Linda and his human roots behind him for the sake of his family, but when he witnesses the loggers\u2019 destruction of the forest, he returns to the flock and rallies them, finally gaining Eduardo's trust. With Blu's knowledge of human technology and help from the scarlet macaws, the flock disable the loggers' machinery. During the fight, Eduardo flies into a tractor and gets knocked onto the ground. As the tractor attempts to kill him, Linda tackles the machine in another tractor and wins. As Eduardo is on the ground between the tractors, Tulio picks him up and lets him fly away. Big Boss tries blowing up the trees with dynamite instead, but Blu thwarts him. Big Boss tries to stop Blu, but Nigel intervenes, wanting Blu to himself, leaving Big Boss to encounter an anaconda. Nigel then attacks Blu in a final attempt to get revenge, but Gabi, while trying to help, accidentally knocks Nigel out with a porcupine's quill filled with her poison. However, Bia reveals that Gabi isn't a poison dart frog at all, but a species of tree frog, and an overjoyed Gabi lovingly smothers a dismayed Nigel and drags him away, while Charlie leaves. The anaconda is shown with a bloated belly, wearing Big Boss\u2019s hat and spitting out his signature lollipop.\n\nWith the flock now under Linda and Tulio's protection, Blu and Jewel decide to live in the Amazon with their kids, though still agreeing to visit Rio in the summer. Eduardo drops his anti-human stance by wearing a fanny pack of his own, and accepts Blu into the flock. Nigel and Gabi are sent to Rio for study, Nico and Pedro's Carnival show called ''Amazon Untamed'' goes on, and Luiz arrives at the Amazon for a visit.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Anne Hathaway 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Anne Hathaway]] at the film's screening at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]] on April 26, 2014]]\n\n<!-- MAIN CAST AS IDENTIFIED IN FILM CREDITS AND IN CREDIT ORDER -->\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Blu, a male [[Spix's macaw]] from [[Moose Lake, Minnesota|Moose Lake]] who was born in Rio de Janeiro and Jewel's mate.<ref name=\"Cast\">{{cite news|author=20th Century Fox Film|first='Rio 2' Coming to 2014|date=February 11, 2016|title=Twentieth Century Fox Animation Announces RIO 2 Casting|newspaper=Business Wire|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170211005613/en/Twentieth-Century-Fox-Animation-Announces-RIO-2|url-status=dead|access-date=February 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170211005613/en/Twentieth-Century-Fox-Animation-Announces-RIO-2|archive-date=June 30, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Jewel, a female Spix's macaw from Rio de Janeiro and Blu's mate.<ref name=Cast/>\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Nigel, a sadistic [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] and Gabi's love interest who seeks revenge on Blu for crippling his ability to fly.<ref name=Cast/>\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]]<ref name=Cast/> as Gabi, a [[poison dart frog]] who is Nigel's sidekick.
