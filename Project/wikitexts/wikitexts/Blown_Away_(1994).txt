Dove hides that he is really Liam McGivney, a former member of a Northern Ireland terrorist cell. He had been friends with Gaerity, but when Gaerity tried to set off a bomb that would have killed numerous civilians, he interceded, ending in the death of his girlfriend (Gaerity's sister), and leading to Gaerity's imprisonment. Devastated, McGivney moved to Boston and took on a new identity, hoping to find atonement in saving others by defusing bombs. Only Dove's uncle, retired Boston police officer Max O'Bannon, is aware of his past and encourages Dove to retire early, feeling he has done his penance.\n\nGaerity sees Dove on TV and makes his way to Boston, taking residence in an abandoned casino boat. He takes a job as a janitor at the police station to learn more about Dove's present life and his co-workers. Gaerity sets up bombs specifically designed to kill the rest of the bomb squad: the first victim, Blanket, is killed by a bomb placed under a bridge on the night of Dove's wedding to his fiancee Kate. Later, at the site of a fake bomb threat, technicians Rita and Cortez are killed by an explosive hidden in their [[bomb disposal robot]]. Dove receives a call from Gaerity and realizes that Kate and his stepdaughter Elizabeth are in danger. He rushes home and finds no bomb, but his dog, \"Boomer,\" has been killed.  He explains his true past to Kate, and convinces her and Elizabeth to go into hiding at Max's seaside cottage. Gaerity's third bomb almost kills rookie technician Anthony Franklin, who has linked Dove's former life to Gaerity, but Dove rescues him and Franklin promises Dove any assistance he can offer.\n\nMax decides to try to stop Gaerity himself, trying to get close to him at an Irish bar, but instead ends up captured by him, and latched into a makeshift bomb. Dove tracks down Max, and goes to retrieve his tools, but Max, realizing that Gaerity had created the bomb to kill both of them, intentionally triggers the bomb while Dove is away, sacrificing himself. In analyzing the bomb's debris, Dove finds a roulette ball that points to the abandoned ship, where he finds Gaerity. Gaerity reveals that he has set up another bomb in Kate's car and arms it via radio signal, then activates a [[Rube Goldberg]]-esque mechanism to trigger an even larger set of explosives that will destroy the ship.  Dove engages with Gaerity in a large m\u00eal\u00e9e fight throughout the ship. Dove gains the upper hand, and handcuffs himself to Gaerity, preventing him from leaving, preparing to die to keep his secret and prevent any more deaths. Dove is saved by Franklin at the last second, having followed Dove to the ship, and the two escape in time before the ship explodes, killing Gaerity in the process.\n\nThe two race back to the city, hoping to stop Kate before she starts the car. They arrive too late but are able to catch up to Kate, and Dove jumps into her car. He finds the complex bomb and manages to defuse it in time. As they recover, Franklin tells Dove he knows his past identity but will keep it a secret if he can take credit for taking down Gaerity; Dove agrees and gives Franklin his beeper before leaving with Kate and Lizzie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Lieutenant Jimmy Dove / Liam McGivney\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Ryan Gaerity\n* Brendan Burns as Gaerity's Cellmate Kevin\n* Faleena Hopkins as Gaerity's Sister \n* [[Suzy Amis]] as Kate Dove\n* Lucinda Weist as Nancy\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as Officer Max O'Bannon (Ret.)\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Officer Anthony Franklin\n* Stephi Lineburg as Lizzie\n* [[John Finn]] as Captain Fred Roarke\n* [[Caitlin Clarke]] as Officer Rita\n* Christofer de Oni as Officer Robby Cortez (as Chris de Oni)\n* Loyd Catlett as Officer \"Bama\"\n* [[Ruben Santiago-Hudson]] as Officer Blanket\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Bomb Squad Class Member\n* Ed O'Keefe as Press Photographer (uncredited)\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Francis, The Barkeeper\n* Chris O'Neill as Boyle\n* Woody as Boomer (Trainer, Studio Animal Services as Paul Calabria)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nStephen Hopkins, who agreed to do the film after completing ''[[Judgment Night (film)|Judgment Night]]'', told his agent, \" 'I don't want to make a movie about a bomb squad!'

There's some politically incorrect things about this film I like which aren't usually allowed in these kind of films.
