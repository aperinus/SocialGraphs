The film takes its title from [[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones song)|the song of the same name]], featured on the band's 1972 album ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' A [[Shine a Light (The Rolling Stones album)|soundtrack album]] was released in April 2008 on the [[Universal Music Group|Universal]] label. This is also the last movie by Paramount Classics, as the company merged into its sister company [[Paramount Vantage]] after the movie was released.\n\n== Production ==\nScorsese filmed the Rolling Stones at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] on October 29 and November 1, 2006, but the performance footage used in the film is all from the second show. The music was recorded, mixed and co-produced by [[Bob Clearmountain]]. The audio recording was done on the Silver Truck with David Hewitt. The concert footage is preceded by a brief semi-fictionalized introduction about the preparations for the shows, and is intercut with historical news clips and archival interviews with band members.\n\nThe shows, which were added to the tour schedule for the purposes of the film shoot, featured a different set list than was typical of other shows on the tour (see below), and were noted for their star-studded crowds, including former [[United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] and his wife, [[Hillary Clinton]], who was then a [[United States senator]], and former President of [[Poland]] [[Aleksander Kwasniewski]].<ref name=\"moviesrock\">{{cite web |last=Glazer |first=Mitch |title=Soul Survivors |publisher=Conde Nast |year=2007 |url=http://www.moviesrock2007.com/article-soul-survivor.php#article-body |access-date=2008-04-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511032451/http://www.moviesrock2007.com/article-soul-survivor.php#article-body |archive-date=2008-05-11}}</ref><ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite web |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |title=Stones Roll with Scorsese in Shine a Light |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 30, 2008 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-stones30mar30,0,1437315.story |access-date=2008-04-02 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080401045251/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-stones30mar30,0,1437315.story<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-04-01}}</ref>\n\nThe performances benefitted the [[Clinton Foundation]], a charity founded by Bill Clinton, who gave a short speech at the October 29 performance. The film also shows [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], [[Buddy Guy]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] performing with the Stones.\n[[File:Rolling Stones Berlinale Filmfestspiele 2008 Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|The Rolling Stones (from left to right: Charlie Watts, Ron Wood, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger) at the Berlin Film Festival (Filmfestspiele Berlin/Berlinale) in 2008 for the world premiere of the concert documentary.]]\n\nPrior to the October 29 show, 83-year-old [[Ahmet Ertegun]], a co-founder and executive of [[Atlantic Records]] and chairman of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and museum, was backstage in a VIP social area, the \"Rattlesnake Inn,\" when he tripped and fell, striking his head on the concrete floor. He was rushed to the hospital, and died on December 14, 2006. The film was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAccording to keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]]'s tour diary, [[Mick Jagger]] had been ill with throat problems, forcing a postponement of the Stones scheduled [[Atlantic City]] concert and the October 31 Beacon Theater show was moved to November 1, to allow Jagger to recuperate.\n\n== Performances ==\n[[File:Shine a Light World Premiere Berlinale.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right: Mick Jagger, Martin Scorsese, Keith Richards, Ron Wood, Charlie Watts and Berlinale director Dieter Kosslick before the world premiere of ''Shine a Light''.]]\nMost of the performance footage was culled from the second night of filming. \"The first night we had [[Bill Clinton]] there,\" Charlie Watts recalled. \"I don't know why the Clinton bit's in the movie\u2026 That was a bit dull, because they weren't really rock 'n' roll people. But Mick was on fire. You can tell in the third song when Lisa Fisher, the singer, does a shimmy with him and you see the look on her face.
