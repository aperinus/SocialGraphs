After the latest raid, during which Calvera kills a villager, the village leaders decide they have had enough. On the advice of the village elder, they decide to fight back. Taking their few objects of value, three villagers ride to a town just inside the [[United States]] border hoping to barter for weapons. They are impressed by Chris Adams, a veteran [[Cajun]] [[gunslinger]], and approach him for advice. Chris suggests they instead hire gunfighters to defend the village, as \"men are cheaper than guns.\" At first agreeing only to help them recruit men, Chris eventually decides to lead the group. Despite the meager pay offered, he finds five willing gunmen.\n\nThey are the gunfighter Vin Tanner, who has gone broke after a round of [[gambling]] and resists local efforts to recruit him as a store clerk; Chris's friend Harry Luck, who assumes Chris is hiding a much bigger reward for the work; the [[Irish Mexican]] Bernardo O'Reilly, who has fallen on hard times; Britt, an expert in both knife and gun who joins purely for the challenge involved; and the dapper, on-the-run gunman Lee, plagued by nightmares of fallen enemies and haunted that he has lost his nerve for battle. On their way to the village, they are trailed by the hotheaded Chico, an aspiring gunfighter whose previous attempts to join Chris had been spurned. Impressed by his persistence, Chris invites him into the group.\n\nArriving at the village, they work with the villagers to build fortifications and train them to defend themselves. They note the lack of women in the village until Chico stumbles upon Petra and discovers the women were hidden in fear that the gunmen would rape them. The gunmen begin to bond with the villagers, and Petra pursues Chico. When Bernardo points out that the gunmen are being given the choice food, the gunmen share it with the village children.\n\nThree of Calvera's men are dispatched to reconnoitre the village; due to a mistake by Chico, the seven are forced to kill all three rather than capture at least one. Some days later Calvera and his bandits arrive in force. The seven and the villagers kill another eight of their cohorts in a shootout and run them out of town. The villagers celebrate, believing Calvera will not return. But Chico infiltrates Calvera's camp and learns that Calvera must return, as his men are short of food.\n\nSome fearful villagers thereupon call for the gunfighters to leave. Even some of the seven waver, but Chris insists that they stay, even threatening to kill anyone who suggests giving up the fight. The seven ride out to make a surprise raid on Calvera's camp, but find it abandoned. Returning to the village, they are caught by Calvera and his men, who have colluded with some of the villagers to sneak in and take control. Calvera spares the seven's lives, believing they have learned the simple farmers are not worth fighting for and fearing reprisals from the gunfighters' \"friends\" across the border. Preparing to depart, Chris and Vin admit they have become emotionally attached to the village. Bernardo likewise gets angry when the boys he befriended call their parents cowards. Chico declares that he hates the villagers; when Chris points out he grew up as a farmer as well, Chico angrily responds that it is men like Calvera and Chris who made the villagers what they are.\n\nThe seven gunmen are escorted some distance from the village, where their weapons are returned to them. They debate their next move and all but Harry, who believes the effort will be futile and suicidal, agree to return and fight.\n\nThe gunmen infiltrate the village and a gunfight breaks out. Harry, who has had a change of heart, returns in time to save Chris's life but is himself fatally shot. Harry pleads to know what they were fighting for, and Chris lies about a hidden gold mine to let Harry believe he died for a fortune; Harry smiles before dying. Lee finds the nerve to burst into a house where several villagers are being held, shooting their captors and releasing the prisoners to join the fight, but is gunned down as he leaves the house. Bernardo, shot protecting the boys he befriended, tells them as he dies to see how bravely their fathers fought. Britt dies after shooting at many bandits but exposing himself from cover. Chris shoots Calvera, who asks him, \"You came back... to a place like this? Why? A man like you? Why?\" He dies without receiving an answer. The remaining bandits take flight.\n\nThe three surviving gunmen ride out of town. As they stop atop a hill overlooking the village, Chico parts company with them, realizing he wants to stay with Petra. Chris and Vin bid farewell to the village elder, who tells them that only the villagers have really won, whereas the gunslingers are \"like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.\" As they pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris admits, \"The Old Man was right. Only the farmers won. We lost. We'll always lose.\"<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/m/magnificent-seven-script-transcript.html Transcript of script].

To compensate, McQueen took numerous opportunities to upstage Brynner and draw attention to himself, including shielding his eyes with his hat, flipping a coin during one of Brynner's speeches, and rattling his shotgun shells. Brynner would often build up a little mound of earth to make himself look as tall as McQueen, only to have McQueen kick the dirt out of place when he passed by.{{sfn|Brynner|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mAllHF9-7ZYC&pg=PA95 95]}} When newspapers started reporting about a rivalry, Brynner issued a press statement saying, \"I never feud with actors.

Along with the readily recognized main theme and effective support of the story line, the score also contains allusions to twentieth-century symphonic works, such as the reference to Bartok's [[Concerto for Orchestra]], second movement, in the tense quiet scene just before the shoot out. The original soundtrack was not released at the time until reused and rerecorded by Bernstein for the soundtrack of ''Return of the Seven''. [[Electric guitar]] [[cover version]]s by [[Al Caiola]] in the U.S. and [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]<ref>p.14 ''Billboard'' February 27, 1961</ref> in the U.K. were successful on the popular charts.<ref>Cusic, Don (2011).

In 2005, the score for ''The Magnificent Seven'' was listed at {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 8 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores|list of the top 25 American film scores]].\n\n===In other media===\nBernstein's score has frequently been quoted in the media and popular culture. Starting in 1963, the theme was used in commercials in the U.S. for [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro cigarettes]] for many years. A similar-sounding (but different) tune was used for [[Victoria Bitter]] beer in Australia, as was a similar-sounding (but different) tune for the introduction to the National Geographic television show. The theme was included in a scene of the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''.\n\nOther uses include in the 2004 documentary film ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''; in the 2005 film ''[[The Ringer (2005 film)|The Ringer]]''; in the 2015 film ''[[Hardcore Henry]]''; as entrance music for the British band [[James (band)|James]], as well as episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' that had a \"[[Western (genre)|Western]]\" theme (mainly in the episode titled \"[[Dude, Where's My Ranch?]]\"). The opening horn riff in [[Arthur Conley]]'s 1967 hit \"[[Sweet Soul Music]]\" is borrowed from the theme. Canadian band [[Kon Kan]] use the opening bars of the theme in their single \"[[I Beg Your Pardon]]\". [[Celtic Football Club]] (Glasgow, Scotland) used the theme music whenever [[Henrik Larsson]] scored a goal. The 2008 [[J-pop]] song \"[[\u014cgoe Diamond]]\" by [[AKB48]] also used part of the main theme.\n\nThe ''[[Cheers]]'' episode \"Diane Chambers Day\" (season 4, episode 22) revolves around the bar denizens being invited to watch ''The Magnificent Seven'', and ends with them singing an a cappella version of the theme.\n\nThe Mick Jones 1980s band [[Big Audio Dynamite]] covered the song as \"Keep off the Grass\" (although this cover was not officially released). In 1995, [[the KLF]] also did a [[drum and bass]] cover of the main title as \"[[The Magnificent (song)|The Magnificent]]\"; it was released under the group alias [[One World Orchestra]] on the charity compilation ''[[The Help Album]]''.\n\nIn 1992, the main theme of ''The Magnificent Seven'' came into use on a section of the Euro [[Disneyland Railroad]] at [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Paris]]. Portions of the theme play as the train exits the [[Grand Canyon]] [[diorama]] tunnel behind [[Phantom Manor]], enters [[Frontierland]], and travels along the bank of the [[Rivers of America (Disney)|Rivers of the Far West]].\n\nThe \"Main Title\" was used as an intro tune on many nights of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s 2012 [[Wrecking Ball Tour]].
