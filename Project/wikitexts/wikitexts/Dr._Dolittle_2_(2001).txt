It was written by Larry Levin, one of the co-writers of ''Dr. Dolittle'', and directed by [[Steve Carr]]. The film stars [[Eddie Murphy]] in the main role, [[Kristen Wilson]], [[Jeffrey Jones]], and [[Kevin Pollak]].\n\nIt tells the story of Dr. Dolittle as he tries to help the animals protect their forest from unscrupulous human developers. He decides to populate the forest with a species of animal that the law protects, and enlists the help of Ava (voiced by [[Lisa Kudrow]]), a lone Pacific western bear living in the condemned forest. To provide her with a mate, Dolittle turns to Archie (voiced by [[Steve Zahn]]), a wise-cracking circus-performing bear.\n\nThis is the last ''Dr. Dolittle'' film to feature Eddie Murphy in the lead role, before [[Kyla Pratt]] assumed the lead role in future films, starting with ''[[Dr. Dolittle 3]]'' in 2006. It is also the last ''Dr. Dolittle'' film to feature Raven-Symon\u00e9 as Charisse Dolittle.\n\n==Plot==\nThree years after the events of the [[Dr. Dolittle (film)|first film]], veterinarian Dr. John Dolittle's ability to talk to animals has made him famous, and he travels the world performing his skills. Returning home from France, he gives his daughter Maya a [[chameleon]] named Pepito, and punishes his other daughter Charisse for doing poorly in school, confiscating her phone for a week. Charisse's boyfriend Eric joins the family for Charisse's 16th birthday party, where an [[opossum]] and a [[raccoon]] named Joey tell John that their boss, the God[[beaver]] ([[Crime boss#Italian Mafia|Godfather]] of the rodent mafia), wants to see him. John meets the Godbeaver and agrees to save the forest from being cut down by mating an endangered female Pacific western bear with a male.\n\nAt a circus, John persuades Archie, the sole surviving Pacific western male, to accompany him to the forest and become a real bear. John takes his family on a month-long vacation to the forest, where he makes a deal with the sole surviving Pacific western female bear named Ava, who is involved with a male Kodiak bear named Sonny. She agrees not to make any decisions for a month after John promises to turn Archie into a bear she will love.\n\nStruggling to train Archie, who is used to the pampered lifestyle, John hires the local forest creatures to chaperone Charisse and Eric, and neglects his wife Lisa. After assuring Archie that he will find a way to win Ava's heart, John attempts to win Lisa back by dancing in their cabin, with every animal in the forest watching, but Lucky the dog accidentally ruins it.\n\nArchie attempts to get Ava's attention by imitating John singing, but falls from a tree branch. Humiliated, he refuses to leave his new-found cave, but becomes frustrated with John's insults and knocks him into a muddy hole, finally listening to his \"inner bear\". Later, Archie spends the day with Ava, whose relationship with Sonny is declining. Lucky tries to woo a female wolf, successfully urinating around her territory, but is interrupted by one of her packmates before she agrees to go out with him. Meanwhile, Sonny forces Ava to leave Archie.\n\nLogging magnate Joseph Potter and his lawyer Jack Riley attempt to make a deal with John to spare some parts of the forest, until Archie tells John he has prepared his \"big finish\" to win Ava and goes after a beehive at the edge of a tall hill, ignoring John's warnings and the attacking bees who also attack a nearby Riley. He manages to get the hive, finally winning Ava's heart and the respect of the other forest animals. Ava then dumps Sonny, finally having had enough of his rudeness to Archie.\n\nIn a game of hide and seek with Ava, Archie is shot by a tranquilizer dart from Riley. John learns that Archie had somewhat destroyed the back of a restaurant. After getting information from a weasel, John visits Archie in jail, telling him that he may be too dangerous to go free and will be sold to a Mexican circus, ending John's chance of saving the forest. John realizes that Charisse has developed her father's gift of talking to animals, reigniting his determination to save the forest. He rallies the animals of the forest not to give up without a fight and free Archie. Charisse, Eric, and Maya rebel against the loggers with the aid of wolves, while word of Archie's predicament spreads, leading animals around the world to go on strike.\n\nAt Potter Wood Industries, Mr. Potter and Riley are attacked by the animals. While Riley takes the brunt from the birds, wolves, and bees, Mr. Potter is cornered by Ava and Joey, forcing him to finally start negotiating with John and the animals. As the negotiations go on, the strike continues to grow with several animal pros like race horses and [[Shamu (SeaWorld show)|Shamu]] getting in on the act. Finally, a deal is made and the Dolittles and animals accept, freeing Archie and saving the entire forest outside San Francisco.\n\nJohn and Charisse become closer, talking with and helping animals together, while Archie and Ava mate and have two cubs who try to take after their father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Doctor Dolittle|Dr. John Dolittle]], a doctor who can talk to animals.\n* [[Kristen Wilson]] as Lisa Dolittle, the wife of John.\n* [[Jeffrey Jones]] as Joseph Potter, a logging magnate and head of Potter Wood Industries.\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Jack Riley, Potter's lawyer.\n* [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] as Charisse Dolittle, the daughter of John who later learns to talk to animals.\n* [[Kyla Pratt]] as Maya Dolittle, the daughter of John.\n* [[Lil Zane]] as Eric, Charisse's boyfriend and pizza delivery man.\n* [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]] as Eldon, Eric's father.\n* Elayn J.
