The plot follows an orphaned Japanese schoolgirl whose life is destroyed when her brother is killed by a son of a [[Ninja]]-[[Yakuza]] clan. When her hand is cut off, she replaces it with a makeshift machine gun and seeks revenge.\n\nSpecial effects were completed by [[Yoshihiro Nishimura]], who went on to direct ''[[Tokyo Gore Police]]''. It was initially released in the United States on May 23, 2008 before premiering in Japan on August 2, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nAmi Hy\u016bga is an average high school girl whose world comes crashing down when her brother Yu and his friend Takeshi Sugihara are killed by bullies, led by Sho Kimura. As Ami tracks down Sho, she discovers that the bullies are associated with a ninja-yakuza family. She goes after the clan for revenge, but they brutally overpower her, cutting off her left arm. Ami escapes and seeks shelter with Takeshi's parents, Suguru and Miki Sugihara, two kindly mechanics who fit her with a multi-barrelled [[machine gun]] prosthetic. Ami and Miki (who uses a [[chainsaw]]) pursue the clan, massacring them one by one. Their victims' families, meanwhile, band together to get revenge.\n\nEventually, they reach the yakuza's hiding place. As the fight continues, Miki loses her right foot and eventually dies. Ami loses her machine gun during her fight with Sho's father Ry\u016bgi Kimura, but gets Miki's chainsaw. Finding Sho with hostages to keep Ami at bay, his mother Violet Kimura manages to disarm Ami while attempting to kill her with her drill bra. Noticing one of the hostages wet himself, Ami takes advantage and trips Violet onto the urine, electrocuting her. She then kills Sho. Feeling she has nothing left to live for, she attempts to commit [[suicide]]. At that moment, Ami hears noise behind her and turns, sword at the ready.\n\n==Production==\nAccording to writer and director Iguchi, the idea for ''The Machine Girl'' went back to a simple idea he had about a one-armed girl in a bikini looking for revenge. The idea for the machine gun arm came later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.net/site/view/when-machine-girl-director-noboru-iguchi-speaks-youd-best-listen-or-this-gi/|title=When MACHINE GIRL Director Noboru Iguchi Speaks You'd Best Listen Or This Girl Will Smack You Hard!|publisher=[twitchfilm.net]|accessdate=2009-07-26|last=Brown|first=Todd|date=February 12, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904005449/http://twitchfilm.net/site/view/when-machine-girl-director-noboru-iguchi-speaks-youd-best-listen-or-this-gi/|archivedate=September 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Minase Yashiro]]  &ndash; Ami Hyuga\n* [[Asami Miyajima]] &ndash; Miki Sugihara\n* [[Noriko Kijima]] &ndash; Yoshie\n* [[Honoka]] &ndash; Violet Kimura\n* Y\u016bya Ishikawa &ndash; Suguru Sugihara\n* Kentar\u014d Shimazu &ndash; Ry\u016bgi Kimura\n* Ryosuke Kawamura &ndash; Yu Hyuga\n* Nobuhiro Nishihara &ndash; Sho Kimura\n* Taro Suwa &ndash; Kimura gang member\n\n===English dub Version===\nThe English dubbed version was dubbed at [[NYAV Post]] in the [[United States]] and [[Philippines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dvdsamling.dk/dvd/index.php?mediaid=631595073980&action=show|title=The Machine Girl|publisher=[dvdsamling.dk]|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref>\n\n*[[Brina Palencia]] &ndash; Ami Hyuga\n*[[Carrie Keranen]] &ndash; Miki Sugihara\n*Kevin T.
