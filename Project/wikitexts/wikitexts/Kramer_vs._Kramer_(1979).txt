The film stars [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Jane Alexander]], and [[Justin Henry]].\nIt tells the story of a couple's [[divorce]], its impact on their young son, and the subsequent evolution of their relationship and views on parenting.\n\nThe film explores the psychology and fallout of divorce and touches upon prevailing or emerging social issues such as [[Gender role#Changing roles|gender roles]], [[women's rights]], [[feminism]], [[fathers' rights movement|fathers' rights]], [[work-life balance]], and [[Single parent#Impact on parents|single parents]].\n\n''Kramer vs. Kramer'' was theatrically released on December 19, 1979, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It was a major critical and commercial success, grossing over $173 million on an $8 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1979 in the United States and Canada and receiving a leading nine nominations at the [[52nd Academy Awards]], winning five (more than any other film nominated that year); [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Hoffman), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Streep), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Workaholic]] [[New York City]] [[advertising]] executive Ted Kramer has just signed a very important account and been promoted. Sharing the good news with his wife Joanna, he learns that she is leaving him and their son Billy. Ted and Billy initially resent one another as Ted no longer has time for his increased workload, and Billy misses his mother. Ted and Billy eventually learn to cope and bond.\n\nTed's business associate Phyllis Bernard accepts Ted's invitation to dinner and they end up sleeping together in his apartment. A groggy Phyllis wakes to go to the bathroom when Billy comes into the corridor at the same moment and sees her naked. She covers herself with her hands and makes small talk with the innocently oblivious Billy.\n\nTed befriends his neighbor Margaret Phelps, in whom Joanna had confided. As a fellow single parent, she and Ted become kindred spirits. As the two sit in the park watching their children play, Billy falls off the [[jungle gym]] resulting in a gash to his face. Ted runs several blocks through traffic carrying Billy to the hospital, where he comforts his son during treatment.\n\nFifteen months after walking out, Joanna returns from California to claim Billy, and a [[child custody|custody battle]] ensues. Neither Ted nor Joanna are prepared for the brutal [[character assassination]]s their lawyers unleash. While  on the witness stand, Margaret is compelled to confirm she had advised an unhappy Joanna to leave Ted, though she also attempts to tell Joanna that her husband has profoundly changed. Ted's firing from his job and Billy's accident are brought up to discredit Ted.\n\nThe court awards custody to Joanna. Ted wants to appeal, saying he will pay any price, but when his lawyer advises that the price would be to put Billy on the stand he says he cannot do that and decides not to contest custody.\n\nOn the morning that Joanna is to collect Billy, Ted and Billy make breakfast together. Joanna calls on the intercom asking Ted to come down to the lobby alone. In the lobby she tells Ted how she had been wishing she had painted Billy's new room like his old one so he'd think he was waking up at home. She then realized Billy's true home is with Ted. She loves Billy very much and won't be taking him with her. She asks if she can go up and talk to Billy, and Ted says he'll wait downstairs. She enters the elevator wiping away tears and asks how she looks. Ted says \"Terrific\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Ted Kramer\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Joanna (Stern) Kramer\n* [[Justin Henry]] as Billy Kramer\n* [[Jane Alexander]] as Margaret Phelps\n* Petra King as Petie Phelps\n* Melissa Morell as Kim Phelps\n* [[Howard Duff]] as John Shaunessy\n* [[George Coe]] as Jim O'Connor\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Phyllis Bernard\n* [[Howland Chamberlain]] as Judge Atkins\n* Dan Tyra as Court Clerk\n\n==Production==\nProducer [[Stanley R. Jaffe]] and writer and director [[Robert Benton]] read [[Avery Corman]]'s source novel and were so moved by the story that they bought the rights to make it into a movie. [[Dustin Hoffman]] was the only actor they envisioned in the lead role of Ted Kramer. \n\nHoffman, himself going through a divorce at the time, initially turned down the role. He has since stated that at that time he had wanted to quit film acting and return to the stage due to his depression and distaste for Hollywood. While Jaffe and Benton were courting Hoffman, [[James Caan]] was offered the role but turned it down as he was concerned the film would be a flop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hub.contactmusic.com/james-caan/news/caan-rues-the-bad-choices-that-prompted-him-to-turn-down-movies|title = Caan Rues the Bad Choices That Prompted Him to Turn Down Movies|date = 12 September 2005}}</ref> [[Al Pacino]] was offered the role but felt that it was not for him.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miUmXrLj7B8C&q=%22al+pacino%22+and+%22kramer+vs+kramer%22&pg=PA71|title = Al Pacino|isbn = 9781416955566|last1 = Grobel|first1 = Lawrence|date = 22 April 2008}}</ref> [[Jon Voight]] turned down the role. Hoffman met with Jaffe and Benton at a [[London]] hotel during the making of ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' and was convinced to accept the role. Hoffman has credited Benton and this film for rejuvenating his love of film acting and inspiring the emotional level of many scenes. Hoffman was reminded of his love for children and \"got closer being a father by playing a father.\"\n\nBenton and Jaffe selected [[Justin Henry]] to play Billy. Hoffman worked extensively with Henry, then 7 years old, in each scene to put him at ease. Benton encouraged Henry to improvise to make his performance more natural. The famous ice cream scene where Billy defies Ted by skipping dinner and eating ice cream was all improvised by Hoffman and Henry. Hoffman contributed many personal moments and dialogue; Benton offered shared screenplay credit but Hoffman declined.\n\n[[Kate Jackson]] was offered the role of Joanna Kramer but had to turn it down as producer [[Aaron Spelling]] was unable to rearrange the shooting schedule of the TV series ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', in which Jackson was starring.<ref name=\"Spelling\">{{cite book |last1=Spelling |first1=Aaron |author-link1=Aaron Spelling |last2=Graham |first2=Jefferson |author-link2=Jefferson Graham |title=A Prime-Time Life: An Autobiography |year=1996 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-14268-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/aaronspellingpri00spel/page/112 112] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/aaronspellingpri00spel/page/112 }}</ref> The part was offered to [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Ali MacGraw]], before [[Meryl Streep]] was cast.\n\nStreep was initially cast as Phyllis (the role eventually taken by [[JoBeth Williams]]), but she was able to force her way into auditioning for Joanna in front of Hoffman, Benton, and Jaffe.
