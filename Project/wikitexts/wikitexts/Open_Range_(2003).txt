The film was the final on-screen appearance of Jeter, who died before it was released, and the film was dedicated to Jeter's memory, as well as to Costner's parents, Bill and Sharon.\n\nThe film was a box office success and was critically favored.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Montana]] in 1882, \"Boss\" Spearman is a seasoned [[open range]] cattleman, who, with hired hands Charley Waite, Mose, and Button, is driving a herd cross-country. Charley is a former Union soldier who served in a \"special squad\" during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and feels immense guilt over his past as a killer of both enemy soldiers and civilians.\n\nBoss sends Mose to the nearby town of Harmonville for supplies. The town is controlled by ruthless [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrant and rancher Denton Baxter, who hates open-rangers for using his land to feed their herds. Mose is badly beaten and jailed by the town's corrupt marshal, Poole, after defending himself in a fight with some of Baxter's men. The only Harmonville inhabitant willing to openly defy Baxter is Percy, the livery stable owner.\n\nBoss and Charley become concerned when Mose does not return. They retrieve him from the jail but not before Baxter gives them an ultimatum to leave the area before nightfall. Mose's injuries are so severe that Boss and Charley take him to the local physician, Doc Barlow. There they meet his assistant, Sue. Charley is attracted immediately but assumes that Sue is the doctor's wife and chooses not to stay the night even after being invited.\n\nAfter catching masked riders scouting their cattle, Boss and Charley sneak up on their campsite, disarm, and humiliate them. At the same time, other riders trash their camp and shoot Mose and Charley's dog Tig dead. Button is badly injured after being shot in the chest. Charley and Boss vow to avenge their friend. They leave Button at the doctor's house and go into town; with help from Percy, they capture Poole and his deputies, subdue them with [[chloroform]] stolen from the Barlows, and lock them up in their own jail.\n\nCharley learns that Sue is the doctor's sister, not his wife. He declares his feelings for her, and she gives him a locket for luck. Charley leaves a note with Percy, in which he states that if he should die, money from the sale of his saddle and gear are to be used to buy Sue a new [[tea set]], having accidentally destroyed her previous set while suffering a [[post-traumatic stress disorder|flashback to his war days]].\n\nBoss and Charley are pitted against Baxter and his men. Before the fight begins, Charley confesses to Boss that his full name is Charles Postlewaite, and he asks Boss to reciprocate. Boss says his real name is Bluebonnet Spearman, but makes Charley swear not to tell anyone. As Baxter and his men approach, Charley confronts them and shoots Butler, the hired gunman who killed Mose. An intense gun battle erupts in the street, with Boss, Charley and Percy outnumbered before the townspeople begin to openly fight against Baxter. Baxter's men, Poole and his deputies, and the local saloonkeeper are killed off one-by-one and Baxter ends up wounded and alone, trapped in the jailhouse. Boss shoots open the jailhouse door and engages him in a brief close-quarters gunfight which leaves Baxter mortally wounded.\n\nSue's brother tends to the wounded townspeople while the dead are buried, and the town is cleaned up. Charley speaks to Sue in private, telling her he must leave. She counters that she has a \"big idea\" about their future together and that she will wait for him to return. He does return, and proposes to Sue, who accepts. After Button has recovered, Charley and Boss decide to retire from the cattle business after delivering their current herd and settle down in Harmonville, taking over the saloon.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n<!-- Characters are in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Boss Spearman / Bluebonnet Spearman\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Charley Waite / Charles Travis Postelwaite\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Sue Barlow\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Denton Baxter\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Percy\n* [[Diego Luna]] as Button\n* [[James Russo]] as Marshal Poole\n* [[Abraham Benrubi]] as Mose Harrison\n* [[Dean McDermott]] as Doc Barlow\n* [[Kim Coates]] as Butler\n* [[Herbert Kohler Jr.]] as Cafe Man\n* [[Peter MacNeill]] as Mack\n* Cliff Saunders as Ralph\n* Patricia Stutz as Ralph's Wife\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Wylie\n* [[Ian Tracey]] as Tom\n* Rod Wilson as Gus\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Inspiration===\nKevin Costner grew up reading the western romance novels of [[Lauran Paine]] and ''Open Range'' is based on Paine's 1990 novel ''The Open Range Men''. Screenwriter Craig Storper wanted to make a movie about \"the evolution of violence in the West.\" Storper continues: \"These characters don't seek violence... But the notion that it's sometimes necessary... is the Western's most fundamental ideal.\"<ref name=\"amctv1\">{{cite web |author=amctv.com |url=https://www.amc.com/talk/2012/06/story-notes-trivia-open-range|title=Story Notes for Open Range|publisher=AMC |access-date=2020-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224151547/http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2012/06/story-notes-trivia-open-range.php |archive-date=2012-12-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nRobert Duvall was the only actor that Costner had in mind for the role of Boss Spearman. Costner said that if Duvall had turned down the part, he might not have made the movie at all. Duvall accepted the role immediately, and Costner gave him top billing. Duvall got bucked off a horse and broke six ribs while practicing his riding for this role.<ref name=\"amctv1\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Cinematographer]] [[J.

Against a budget of $22 million it finished its theatrical run with $58.3 million in North America and $10 million from foreign markets for a total of $68.3 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Open Range (2003)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=openrange.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mostly positive reviews, receiving a 79% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 184 reviews, with an average rating of 6.80/10.

Kevin Carr of FilmThreat.com said on the gun action in ''Open Range'': \"After ''[[The Matrix]]'' redefined action in the late 1990s, every crummy action sequence tries to repeat the power of '[[bullet time]]' often with little success.
