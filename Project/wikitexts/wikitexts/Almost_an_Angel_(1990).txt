Following a fellow inmate's suggestion, he decides to switch to [[bank robbery]] instead, with a special twist of his own design: first by having the security cameras record TV shows he would connect them to with a modified remote control, then entering disguised as a celebrity; the confusion over this unexpected appearance would serve to confound a detailed description.\n\nTerry's first heist (disguised as [[Willie Nelson]]) is successful, but shortly afterwards he witnesses a young boy about to be run over by a van; he impulsively pushes the child away and is himself hit. While in the hospital, he has a nebulous experience (which may have been caused by ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'' playing on the room's TV) in which he meets God ([[Charlton Heston]]) who introduces himself as Terry's 'probation helper'. Though Terry has lived a sinful life, his last deed, impulsive as it was, has earned him a second chance to save his soul\u2014by doing God's work as an [[angel]] in training.\n\nAfter reawakening, Terry tries another bank hold-up disguised as [[Rod Stewart]], but a stroke of luck occurs and a gang of amateur robbers interfere. As they escape, one of the thugs tries to shoot Terry, but gun was loaded with blanks by one of the other thugs. Thinking himself to be an immortal angel now, Terry reconsiders his ways, seeks advice in a church, and then he follows several 'signs' to another town. In a bar, he meets Steve Garner ([[Elias Koteas]]), an embittered young man confined to a wheelchair by a terminal sickness. To bring Steve out of his self-pity, Terry engages him in a fist-fight on equal terms, sitting fixed on a stool. Steve, taken with Terry's acceptance of him as a person, strikes up a friendship with Terry and offers him a place to stay at the youth center for children and teens, which he runs with his sister Rose ([[Linda Kozlowski]]).\n\nRose is at first suspicious about Terry, but Terry proves himself by slyly intimidating two drug dealers into leaving the center's premises and helping out as much as he can, and Rose gradually falls in love with him. The center itself, however, is in financial difficulties, since its backer George Bealeman ([[Parley Baer]]), while claiming himself to be a faithful Christian, refuses to provide any more funds. Since he has no angel's powers, Terry uses his technical know-how to convince Bealeman otherwise: by recording and re-editing a segment from [[Televangelism|TV evangelist]] Rev. Barton's (Ben Slack) telecast (which Bealeman watches reverently), and fitting the cross at the rooftop of the center's church with lighting effects, triggered by his universal remote.\n\nAt the evening where Bealeman drops by, however, two police detectives close in on Terry. Steve, who happens to overhear them, rushes off in his wheelchair to warn Terry. However, a sack of glass bottles Steve is carrying breaks and his femoral artery is cut causing him to bleed out. Just after Bealeman has left, he arrives at the center, and while Rose runs to calls an ambulance, Steve delivers his warning. Afraid of death, Steve feels lost, but is reassured he will find a place in Heaven when Terry uses the remote to trigger the lighted cross, creating a sign from God. No longer afraid of death, Steve dies in the arms of Terry and Rose.\n\nTerry then announces that he has to leave, and trying to comfort Rose, he reveals that he is \"almost an angel\". Rose is understandably skeptical, but after Terry leaves, she checks his universal remote which he had left her as a keepsake, only to discover that it contains no batteries. As she stares up at the cross, it nevertheless begins to shine brilliantly on its own. Rose runs after Terry and calls out to him. Distracted, Terry slips and falls right before a speeding truck and is about to be run over. Rose is shocked to witness that the truck passes right through him, proving he has made himself an angel. Having passed his test, Terry continues on his quest to do God's work (though not without promising to return), and Rose is left comforted at last.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Hogan]] as Terry Dean  \n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Steve Garner  \n* [[Linda Kozlowski]] as Rose Garner  \n* Doreen Lang as Mrs. Garner  \n* [[Douglas Seale]] as Father  \n* Ruth Warshawsky as Irene Bealeman  \n* [[Parley Baer]] as George Bealeman  \n* [[Michael Alldredge]] as Sergeant Freebody  \n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Detective Bill  \n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Teller  \n* Travis Venable as Bubba  \n* Robert Sutton as Guido  \n* Ben Slack as Reverend Barton, TV Evangelist  \n* Troy Curvey, Jr. as Tom, The Guard  \n* Eddie Frias as Young Guard Trainee\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[God]]\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a commercial failure.<ref>{{cite news |title= New Year Opens With a Bang at Box Office Movies: At least $128 million in tickets were sold over the five-day period.
