It is the sequel to Klane's 1989 comedy ''[[Weekend at Bernie's]]''. [[Andrew McCarthy]], [[Jonathan Silverman]] and [[Terry Kiser]] reprise their roles. The film was panned by critics and was a modest success at the box office, grossing $12.7 million against a $7 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nLarry Wilson ([[Andrew McCarthy]]) and Richard Parker ([[Jonathan Silverman]]) are at a [[Manhattan]] morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax ([[Terry Kiser]]). Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's [[credit card]]. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel ([[Barry Bostwick]]), the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the {{USD|2 million}} that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes that they are lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt.\n\nOver dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a [[safe deposit box]] in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the $2&nbsp;million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu ([[Novella Nelson]]) is hired by mobsters to find the $2 million Bernie stole. She sends two servants\u2014Henry ([[Steve James (actor)|Steve James]]) and Charles ([[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]])\u2014to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a [[voodoo doll|voodoo]] ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy [[adult movie theatre|porno theater]] for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the [[Grand Central\u201342nd Street station|42nd Street\u2013Grand Central]] subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their [[boombox]].\n\nLater that night, Larry and Richard sneak into their office building to check Bernie's account, only to find that Bernie is the only one that can open it. They are soon arrested by officers for breaking and entering. After their release, they find Bernie (whom they believe is still dead), stuff him into a suitcase, bring him with them to the Virgin Islands, and put him into a small refrigerator in their hotel room. Unbeknownst to the two, Hummel is following them to recover the embezzled cash. The guys successfully use Bernie to open his safety deposit box but they only find a map. Meanwhile, Larry befriends a lovely native girl named Claudia ([[Troy Beyer]]), and gives her the map. Later, he and Richard are captured by Henry and Charles, who take them to Mobu. With one of the mobsters holding a gun to his head, she forces Richard to drink a poisonous concoction of a potion and tells them they must find the map by sundown to get the antidote.\n\nWhen Larry, Richard, and Claudia are reunited, they are shocked to discover that Bernie is moving and realize he is leading them towards the $2 million. To keep him moving, they put a [[Walkman]] with headphones on his head. As Bernie finds a large chest underwater, their resulting excitement causes Larry to accidentally shoot Bernie in the head with a [[speargun]], destroying the headphones. They attempt to bring Bernie back to the surface but he will not let go of the chest, which is too heavy to hoist out of the water. They end up attaching Bernie to a horse carriage with music playing. It seems to work at first, but when they go downhill, the carriage goes out of control. Eventually, the carriage ends up at Mobu's place. Bernie hits a large tree branch and spins into a somersault before knocking out Mobu. The crash also causes Bernie to drop the chest on the ground and it breaks open. Larry tries to scoop up the money but is caught by Hummel (now slightly unhinged upon seeing the undead Bernie walk) and he gives the $2 million to him. With Mobu out of commission, Claudia's father, a medical doctor, says that he can cure Richard if he can get the blood of a virgin (which Larry confesses he can provide). The mobsters and Mobu are arrested.\n\nLarry confesses to Richard that he returned the $2&nbsp;million to the insurance company, but only after learning Bernie actually stole $3&nbsp;million. Larry and Richard use some of the remaining million to purchase a yacht crewed by attractive women.  Meanwhile  Bernie is last seen leading Henry and Charles, who have been transformed into goats by voodoo, through a carnival parade to an unknown fate.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Lawrence \"Larry\" Wilson\n* [[Jonathan Silverman]] as  Richard Parker\n* [[Terry Kiser]] as Bernie Lomax\n* [[Troy Byer]] as Claudia\n* [[Barry Bostwick]] as Arthur Hummel\n* [[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]] as Charles\n* [[Steve James (actor)|Steve James]] as Henry\n* [[Novella Nelson]] as Mobu\n* [[Gary Dourdan]] as Cartel Man\n* [[Stack Pierce]] as Claudia's Dad\n* [[Constance Shulman]] as Tour operator\n\n== Production ==\n''Weekend at Bernie's II'' was filmed in 1992 in the Territory of the Virgin Islands of the United States and in New York City. The cast and crew, who were mainly from the Los Angeles area, were on location when the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots of April 1992]] broke out and they stated in a St. Thomas interview that they were worried for their loved ones. The Bernie dummy used in the film had been on display for the film's debut shortly before the riot's outbreak, and was robbed of its painter's hat and $400 sunglasses.<ref>TV Guide, May 11th, 1992</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Weekend at Bernie's II'' earned mostly negative reviews from critics, earning a 10% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 29 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"It would appear to be all but impossible to make a worthwhile sequel to a comedy about a corpse's exploits\u2014odds ''Weekend at Bernie's II'' never comes close to beating.\"<ref>{{rottentomatoes|weekend_at_bernies_ii}}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade of \"C+\" on scale of A+ to F.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\n[[Hal Hinson]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote: \"If the premise of the first film was mindless and repetitive, it's doubly so this second time around.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Hal Hinson |title='Weekend at Bernie's II' (PG) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/weekendatberniesiipghinson_a0a833.htm |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=July 10, 1993}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a grade \"F\".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Weekend At Bernie's II |url=https://ew.com/article/1993/07/23/weekend-bernies-ii/ |magazine=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>\n\nDavid Rooney of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it \"a mildly diverting farcical caper.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=17 February 1993 |last=Rooney |first=David |title=Weekend at Bernie's II |url=https://variety.com/review/VE1117900455 |website=Variety }}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film 3 out of 5 and praised Terry Kiser for his performance: \"Through it all, Mr. Kiser, who says not a word, exudes the foolish amiability of a partygoer who is beyond plotzed and is living in a private world of his own.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=10 July 1993 |last=Holden |first=Stephen |title=Review/Film; Bon Vivant Still Lives.

The movie is featured in the staff picks shelf at a video rental store, under \"Gene's Picks\".  [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] recommends it to [[Elaine Benes|Elaine]] (as \"a hilarious premise\") instead of a staff pick by \"arthouse goon\" Vincent. Elaine rents it, only to be disappointed and eventually yell \"Bernie's dead, you morons!\" at the television while watching it.\n\nSimilarly, in an episode of ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' a character who needs to establish an alibi is too embarrassed to say which film he had been watching. The team assume he was watching a porn film, but he eventually admits it was ''Weekend at Bernie's II'', to which film geek [[Anthony DiNozzo|Agent DiNozzo]] says, \"Even worse.\"<ref>NCIS, season 3, episode 13 - Deception, January 17, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe movie is referenced in the ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' episode \"[[How Lily Stole Christmas]]\" when [[Ted Mosby|Ted]] attempts to insult [[Lily Aldrin|Lily]] for having a poor sense of humor. \"Remember that time we heard her laughing, and we thought she was watching ''Weekend at Bernie's'' but it turned out she was watching ''Weekend at Bernie's II''!\" This movie is also referenced in the ''How I Met Your Mother'' episode \"[[Weekend at Barney's]]\".\n\n''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' references this movie in the episode \"Most Wanted\", where the main characters watch a commercial for the movie ''Weekend at Bernie's Part 7'', which features the tag line \"Bernie's still dead, and he's stiffer than ever!\" Bernie is shown being visibly decaying at this point.\n\nSimilar to ''Beavis'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' would also parody the premise of the ''Bernie's'' series in their episode \"Rixty Minutes\", wherein in an alternate universe, the titular characters', respectively, son-in-law and dad Jerry Smith (in said universe a popular movie director, star, and celebrity altogether because he had not gotten together with his wife, Beth), is revealed to have written and directed a film entitled ''Last Will and Testimeow: Weekend at Dead Cat Lady's House II'', wherein a group of cats is seen attempting to act as their owner after they die in their sleep. This includes dating, making out with, and ultimately engaging in sexual intercourse with their owner's estate holder, despite, as in ''Beavis'', the body visibly fighting to keep from decomposition, to the point one cat has to open the mouth, which is not only rotting, but is seen to have maggots inside. This would be the last film \"directed\" by Jerry, as at its release party, Jerry suffered a nervous breakdown, reportedly evoked by a stack of magazines in the bathroom at the party (one of which featured Beth on the cover). He subsequently cut off his big toe, as well as most of his hair, stole the woman's motor scooter (\"paying\" them with what was later revealed to be worthless R2D2 coins), and rode all the way to Beth's house, where they proceed to have an intimate talk and reunite in-universe.\n\nOn ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', specifically the Season 5 episode ''The [[ASAP Ferg]] Show'', the titular host, Andre, \"reenacted\" the ''Bernie's'' series by walking around with someone dressed as, and acting dead like, Bernie, going up to random people and letting them know (despite a majority of people not having any interest); he even specifically mentioned the sequel by name.\n \n===Movin' Like Bernie===\nInspired by the movement of the film's namesake, a style of dance was created called \"Movin' Like Bernie\". Homemade films went viral on the Internet, from children to soldiers serving overseas.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjpxKNK6mzo  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/PjpxKNK6mzo| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=Soldiers Movin' Like Bernie 2 |via=[[YouTube]] |date=2012-01-26 |access-date=2012-07-07}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Even professional athletes began performing the dance, including [[Baltimore Ravens]] running back [[Ray Rice]] after scoring a touchdown during a nationally-televised January 2011 game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].<ref>[http://theschoolphilly.com/2011/01/15/ray-rice-does-the-bernie-after-td/ Ray Rice Is Movin\u2019 Like Berney] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121103504/http://theschoolphilly.com/2011/01/15/ray-rice-does-the-bernie-after-td/ |date=January 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe 2012 [[Oakland Athletics]] adapted \"Movin' Like Bernie\" into their celebration routines after [[Coco Crisp]] played the song for third baseman [[Brandon Inge]] in the team's clubhouse before a game.
