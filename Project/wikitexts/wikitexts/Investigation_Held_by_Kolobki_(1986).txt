Previously, Karbophos had been the owner of Baldakhin, but due to his abuse of the elephant, it fled from him. The renowned [[Kolobok|Kolobki]] brothers\u2014a detective duo\u2014take up the investigation.\n\nAt a souvenir shop, Karbophos obtains a certificate for a porcelain elephant that he purchases (and then promptly breaks). He attempts to use said certificate to board a aeroplane with Baldakhin.\n\nHowever, the Kolobki brothers manage to arrive in the nick of time, and lure the elephant away with [[cod-liver oil]]. Karbophos is eventually shot with a balloon gun, and flies away. The Kolobki brothers and Baldakhin (along with a turncoat ex-servant of Karbophos) then walk through the city.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}<!-- For guidelines please see WP:FILMCAST -->\n* [[Leonid Bronevoy]] as ''Chief'' (in the first two shorts)\n* [[Michael Evdokimov]] as ''Chief'' (in the second two shorts)\n* Aleksey Ptitsin as ''Colleague''\n* Stanislav Fedosov as all of the other characters\n\n== Pilot Brothers ==\n{{Main|List of Pilot Brothers characters|List of Pilot Brothers cartoons and programs|List of Pilot Brothers games}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* On August 9, 2018, an English version of the cartoon was posted on the Gosteleradiofond YouTube channel.<ref>{{YouTube|5MaYpgPvGXY|\u0421\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u041a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0431\u043a\u0438. \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 1 \u0438 2.
