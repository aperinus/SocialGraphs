[[Independent film|Independently]] produced on a [[Low budget film|low budget]], it is Jackson's first feature film. Jackson and friends take on most of the key roles, both on and off-screen. The plotline sees [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] invade the fictional [[New Zealand]] village of Kaihoro to harvest humans for their intergalactic [[fast food]] [[Franchising|franchise]], where they face off against a four-man [[paramilitary]] force. The film provided Jackson with the leverage necessary to advance in the film industry.\n\nSince its release, ''Bad Taste'' has become a [[cult film]] and has received generally positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Astro Investigation and Defence Service (AIDS) sends their agents, Derek, Frank, Ozzy, and Barry to investigate the disappearance of the entire population of the town of Kaihoro. They find the town has been overrun by man-eating space aliens disguised as humans in blue shirts. Barry kills one of the aliens and is attacked by others. After Derek notifies Frank and Ozzy, he begins torturing Robert, an alien they caught earlier. Robert's screaming attracts a number of aliens in the area. Derek kills the would-be rescuers, but he is attacked by Robert and falls off a cliff ledge, to his presumed death.\n\nMeanwhile, a charity collector named Giles is passing through Kaihoro. He is attacked by Robert, but escapes in his car. He stops at a nearby house for help. Another alien answers the door and captures Giles. He later wakes up in a tub of water filled with vegetables and is told he is about to be cooked and eaten. Derek also wakes up to find that he landed in a seagull's nest. He also finds that his brain is leaking out the back of his head, so he stuffs it back in and uses a hat to hold it in place.\n\nThat night, Frank, Ozzy, and Barry infiltrate the aliens' house and find a room filled with bloody cardboard boxes. They kill a nearby alien and Frank wears its shirt to infiltrate an alien meeting. He finds out that the residents of Kaihoro have been harvested for alien fast food and also hears of their recent hostage. Robert vomits into a bowl, which the aliens dine on, including the disguised (and disgusted) Frank. He escapes and tells the others of the plan. They sneak out to save Giles as the aliens sleep.\n\nAt sunrise, they try to leave but are attacked by the aliens, which quickly dissolves into a gunfight. Derek emerges and his hat is shot off due to the ensuing gunfire, and he starts losing more of his brain, so he uses his belt as a headband. He grabs a chainsaw from the boot of his car and heads for the alien house. As the boys leave with Giles, the alien leader (Lord Crumb) and his followers transform into their true form and follow. Ozzy uses a rocket launcher to blow up Frank's car, which has been overrun by aliens.\n\nFrank and Ozzy hunt for Lord Crumb and kill many aliens along the way. Meanwhile, Derek kills an alien with his chainsaw and replaces the missing parts of his brain with its brain. An alien prepares to shoot Frank and Ozzy, but it is beheaded by Derek after he bursts through the wall behind it. Frank and Ozzy are shocked to see him alive.\n\nAfter they escape the house, Lord Crumb shoots Ozzy in the leg and Frank fires his rocket launcher at the leader, but it misses and almost hits Derek, finally taking out a sheep in a nearby meadow. Derek is knocked out by Lord Crumb and the house transforms into a giant [[spacecraft|space ship]], which blasts off into space with Derek still aboard.\n\nOn board, Derek looks out the window to see that he is leaving Earth. Crumb is then killed by Derek, who ambushes him and cuts through the alien with his chainsaw. Derek proclaims into his phone: \"I'm coming to get you bastards!\" He then puts on the alien leader's skin, laughing maniacally as he rockets towards the alien planet. On Earth, the rest of the group drive away into the sunset in Derek's car.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* Terry Potter as Ozzy / 3rd Class Alien\n* [[Pete O'Herne]] as Barry / 3rd Class Alien\n* [[Peter Jackson]] as Derek / Robert\n* Mike Minett as Frank / 3rd Class Alien\n* Craig Smith as Giles Copeland/ 3rd Class Alien\n* Ken Hammon as 3rd Class Alien\n* Costa Botes as 3rd Class Alien\n* Doug Wren as Lord Crumb\n** Dean Lawrie as Lord Crumb SPFX double / 3rd Class Alien\n** [[Peter Vere-Jones]] as Lord Crumb's voice\n\n==Production==\nMuch of the film was shot in and around Jackson's home suburb of [[Pukerua Bay]] in northern [[Wellington]], using a 25-year-old 16mm [[Bolex]] camera.<ref name=onscreen>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/good-taste-made-bad-taste-1988|title=Good Taste Made Bad Taste|work=[[NZ On Screen]]|date=1988|access-date=4 February 2019}}</ref> Originally begun as a 20-minute short film called ''Roast of the Day'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nzfilm.co.nz/films/bad-taste|title=Bad Taste|publisher=[[New Zealand Film Commission]]| access-date= 5 February 2018}}</ref> ''Bad Taste'' was shot primarily on weekends over the course of four years, at an initial cost of around $25,000. Toward the end of the shoot the [[New Zealand Film Commission]] invested around [[NZ$]]235,000 into the film to ensure its completion. Heavily influenced by special effects pioneer [[Tom Savini]], Jackson incorporated many absurdly [[splatter film|gory]] [[special effects]].<ref name=nzonscreen>{{cite web|title=Bad Taste|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/bad-taste-1988/background#critique_0|publisher=nzonscreen.com|access-date=5 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nPeter Jackson himself plays two acting roles. In one early scene halfway down a cliff, careful editing, utilising shots taken months apart, makes it possible for the two characters, Derek and the alien Robert (both played by Jackson), to fight one another.<ref name=onscreen/>\n\n''Bad Taste'' begins Jackson's penchant for using the [[Morris Minor]] in his films - Giles drives a Morris Minor. Subsequently, every car in ''[[Meet the Feebles]]'' is a Morris Minor (including a [[limousine]]) and several are seen in ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]''.\n\nA combination of blank firing firearms and homemade weapon props were used in the film. Most of the firearm props were made using recycled aluminium and wood. The actors also had to shake them to simulate the [[recoil]]. A flash and sound effect was added later during post production.<ref name=onscreen/>\n\nAll the alien masks in the film were baked in Peter Jackson's mother's oven.<ref name=onscreen/>\n\nKaihoro, the name of the town whose inhabitants are butchered, is a [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] word coined by Jackson and his crew early in the shooting of the film. It has two parts - \"kai\" which means food and \"horo\" which means town or village. [[Foodtown]] is also the name of a New Zealand chain of grocery stores. Kai horo in Te Reo Maori means 'greedy' - but is made up of the words Kai (food) and horo (quickly) which, loosely translated, could be said to mean 'fast food', a play on the fate of the villagers.\n\nThe sheep in the film was to have played a larger role as a running gag, being surprisingly aggressive and chasing \"The Boys\" at various points throughout. This was reduced to the single sheep/rocket launcher moment of the final scene.\n\n==Release==\nThe film sold to many countries after playing in the market at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]]. \nDespite its wide acclaim, the film failed to impress at the 1989 [[New Zealand film and television awards|NZ Film and Television Awards]], winning no awards. As well as this, a [[TVNZ]] executive spoke out the next day about whether or not the film industry needed films like ''Bad Taste''. The film did however still win favour among the country's cult film audiences.<ref name=\"nzonscreen\"/>\n\nIn France, the film received 29,339 admissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=6161|title=Bad Taste (1987)|work=JPBox-Office.com|language=fr|access-date=3 January 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Bad Taste'' received generally positive reviews. Kim Newman of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film three stars out of five, with praise being directed to the special effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/bad-taste-review/|title=Bad Taste (1987) Review|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=1 January 2000|access-date=29 December 2020}}</ref> For [[AllMovie]], Jason Buchanan wrote that ''Bad Taste'' was \"amazingly resourceful\", but that it moves at such a \"hyperactive\" pace that \"it's nearly impossible to draw a breath, much less take a moment to laugh at the revoltingly hilarious exploits.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/bad-taste-v3751/review|title=Bad Taste (1987) {{!}} Review|work=[[AllMovie]]|first=Jason|last=Buchanan|access-date=29 December 2020}}</ref> In a much less positive review, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' summarised that although \"the film had its moments\", it was not a worthwhile watch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/movies/bad-taste|title=Bad Taste 1987, directed by Peter Jackson|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|access-date=29 December 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film holds a 71% approval rating on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 21 reviews with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 6.40/10.

The film had to be trimmed for release in Australia at the time, as the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|OFLC]] felt the gore too excessive. When released on home video in Australia, the words \"BANNED IN QUEENSLAND\" was proclaimed on the cover. The uncut version was released by [[Universal Home Entertainment]] on [[DVD]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refused-classification.com/censorship/films/bad-taste-1987.html |title=Bad Taste (1987)|website=Refused-Classification.com |date=2013-08-27 |access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref>\n\nApart from the uncut version, there is a heavily cut [[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft|FSK 18]]-rated and an even more censored [[Freiwillige Selbstkontrolle der Filmwirtschaft|FSK 12]]-rated version in Germany available on DVD.
