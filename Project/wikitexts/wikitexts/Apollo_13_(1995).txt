The screenplay by [[William Broyles Jr.]] and [[Al Reinert]] dramatizes the aborted 1970 [[Apollo 13]] lunar mission and is an adaptation of the 1994 book ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13]]'', by astronaut [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Jeffrey Kluger]]. The film depicts [[astronaut]]s Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] aboard Apollo 13 for America's fifth crewed mission to the Moon, which was intended to be the third to land. En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of much of its oxygen supply and electrical power, which forces [[NASA]]'s flight controllers to abort the [[Moon landing]] mission and improvise scientific and mechanical solutions to get the three astronauts to Earth safely.\n\nHoward went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing [[NASA]]'s assistance in astronaut and flight-controller training for his cast and obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a [[reduced-gravity aircraft]] for realistic depiction of the [[weightlessness]] experienced by the astronauts in space.\n\nReleased to cinemas in the United States on June 30, 1995,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=apollo13.htm |title=Apollo 13 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date=30 June 1995 |access-date=11 September 2016 |archive-date=November 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116194505/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=apollo13.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> ''Apollo 13'' received critical acclaim and was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (winning for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]).<ref name=\"Oscar\">{{cite web |url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org |title=Academy Awards, USA: 1996 |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |access-date=8 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723203650/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ |archive-date=July 23, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The film also won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]], as well as two [[British Academy Film Awards]]. In total, the film grossed over $355&nbsp;million worldwide during its theatrical releases.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nOn July 20, 1969, astronaut [[Jim Lovell]] hosts a party where guests watch [[Neil Armstrong]]'s televised first steps on the Moon from [[Apollo 11]]. Lovell, who orbited the Moon on [[Apollo 8]], tells his wife Marilyn that he will return to the Moon to walk on its surface.\n\nThree months later, as Lovell is conducting a VIP tour of NASA's [[Vehicle Assembly Building]], his boss [[Deke Slayton]] informs him that his crew will fly [[Apollo 13]] instead of 14, swapping flights with [[Alan Shepard]]'s crew. Lovell, [[Ken Mattingly]], and [[Fred W. Haise, Jr.|Fred Haise]] train for their mission. Days before launch, Mattingly is exposed to [[rubella|German measles]], and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, [[Jack Swigert]]. Lovell resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband dying in space, and tells Lovell she will not go to [[Kennedy Space Center]] to see him off for an unprecedented fourth launch. She later changes her mind and surprises him.\n\nOn launch day, Flight Director [[Eugene F. Kranz|Gene Kranz]] in Houston's [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] gives the [[launch status check#Apollo missions|go for launch]]. As the [[Saturn V]] rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a [[S-II|second stage]] engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its Earth [[parking orbit]]. After the third stage fires again to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert performs the maneuver to turn the [[Apollo command and service module|Command Module]] ''Odyssey'' around to [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]] with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] ''Aquarius'' and pull it away from the spent rocket.\n\nThree days into the mission, by order of Mission Control, Swigert turns on the [[liquid oxygen]] stirring fans. An electrical short causes a tank to explode, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling. The other tank is soon found to be leaking. [[Flight controller#EECOM|Consumables manager]] [[Sy Liebergot]] convinces Kranz that shutting off two of ''Odyssey''{{'}}s three [[fuel cell]]s offers the best chance to stop the leak, but this does not work. With only one fuel cell, mission rules dictate the Moon landing be aborted. Lovell and Haise power up ''Aquarius'' to use as a \"lifeboat\", while Swigert shuts down ''Odyssey'' to save its battery power for the return to Earth. Kranz charges his team with bringing the astronauts home, declaring \"[[failure is not an option]]\". Consumables manager [[John Aaron]] recruits Mattingly to help him improvise a procedure to restart ''Odyssey'' for the landing on Earth.\n\nAs the crew watches the Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost dream of walking on its surface, then turns his crew's attention to the business of getting home. With ''Aquarius'' running on minimal electrical power and rationed water supply, the crew suffers from freezing conditions, and Haise develops a [[urinary tract infection]]. Swigert suspects Mission Control is concealing the fact they are doomed; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; but Lovell squelches the argument. As ''Aquarius''{{'}}s [[carbon dioxide]] filters run out, concentration of the gas approaches a dangerous level. Ground control improvises a [[Rube Goldberg machine|\"Rube Goldberg\" device]] to make the [[Apollo command module|Command Module]]'s [[Square peg in a round hole#Literal cases|incompatible]] filter cartridges work in the Lunar Module. With ''Aquarius''{{'}}s navigation systems shut down, the crew makes a vital course correction manually by steering the Lunar Module and controlling its engine.\n\nMattingly and Aaron struggle to find a way to power up the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, and finally read the procedure to Swigert, who restarts ''Odyssey'' by drawing the extra power from ''Aquarius''. When the crew jettisons the [[Apollo service module|Service Module]], they are surprised by the extent of the damage, raising the possibility that the [[ablative heat shield]] was compromised. As they release ''Aquarius'' and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, no one is sure that ''Odyssey''{{'}}s heat shield is intact. \n\nThe tense period of radio silence due to [[ionization blackout]] is longer than normal, but when the astronauts report all is well, the world watches ''Odyssey'' [[splashdown|splash down]] and celebrates their return. As helicopters bring the crew aboard the [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']] for a hero's welcome, Lovell's voice-over describes the cause of the explosion, and the subsequent careers of Haise, Swigert, Mattingly, and Kranz. He wonders if and when mankind will return to the Moon.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = Tom Hanks 2016.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Hanks\n| image2    = Kevin Bacon SDCC 2014.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Bacon\n| image3    = Bill Paxton 2014 retouched.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Paxton\n| image4    = Gary Sinise 2011 (cropped).jpg\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = Sinese\n| image5    = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| alt5      =\n| caption5  = Harris\n| footer    =\n}}\n'''Apollo 13 crew:'''\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Commander [[Jim Lovell]].\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as backup / prime Command Module Pilot [[Jack Swigert]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41798850/the_record/ |title=America's Derring-Do Resurrected |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |newspaper=[[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] |location=Hackensack, New Jersey| date=June 30, 1995 |page=43 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=September 27, 2021 |archive-date=June 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630021803/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/41798850/page-43/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Lunar Module Pilot [[Fred Haise]]\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as prime / grounded Command Module Pilot [[Ken Mattingly]]\n\n'''Other astronauts:'''\n* Mark Wheeler as Apollo 11 Commander [[Neil Armstrong]]\n* Larry Williams as Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]]\n* [[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]] as Apollo 12 Commander [[Pete Conrad]]\n* Ben Marley as Apollo 13 backup Commander [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]]\n* [[Brett Cullen]] as [[Capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) 1 (a composite astronaut)\n* [[Ned Vaughn]] as CAPCOM 2 (a composite astronaut)\n\n'''NASA ground personnel:'''\n* [[Ed Harris]] as White Team [[Flight controller#Flight Director|Flight Director]] [[Gene Kranz]].

Two individual Lunar Modules and two Command Modules were constructed for filming. Composed of some original Apollo materials, they were built so that different sections were removable, which allowed filming to take place inside them. Space Works also built modified Command and Lunar Modules for filming inside a [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|Boeing KC-135]] [[reduced gravity aircraft|reduced-gravity aircraft]], and the pressure suits worn by the actors, which are exact reproductions of those worn by the Apollo astronauts, right down to the detail of being airtight. When suited up with their helmets locked in place, the actors were cooled by and breathed air pumped into the suits, as in actual Apollo suits.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes2\" />\n\nThe [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center]] consisted of two control rooms on the second and third floors of Building 30 at the [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. [[NASA]] offered the use of the control room for filming, but Howard declined, opting instead to make his own replica.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\" /><ref name=\"DVDProductionNotes\" /> Production designer Michael Corenblith and set decorator Merideth Boswell were in charge of the construction of the Mission Control set at Universal Studios. It was equipped with giant rear-screen projection capabilities, and a complex set of computers with individual video feeds to all the flight controller stations. The actors playing the flight controllers could communicate with each other on a private audio loop.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes2\" /> The Mission Control room built for the film was on the ground floor.<ref name=\"DVDProductionNotes\" /> One NASA employee, a consultant for the film, said the set was so realistic that he would leave at the end of the day and look for the elevator before he remembered he was not in Mission Control.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\" /> The recovery ship [[USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)|USS ''Iwo Jima'']] had been scrapped by the time the film was made, so her sister ship, [[USS New Orleans (LPH-11)|''New Orleans'']], was used instead.<ref name=\"DVDProductionNotes\" />\n\nTo prepare for their roles in the film, Hanks, Paxton, and Bacon all attended the [[U.S. Space Camp]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. While there, astronauts Jim Lovell and [[David Scott]], commander of [[Apollo 15]], did actual training exercises with the actors inside a simulated [[Apollo command and service module#Command_module_(CM)|Command Module]] and [[Lunar Module]]. The actors were also taught about each of the 500 buttons, toggles, and switches used to operate the spacecraft. The actors then traveled to [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston where they flew in the KC-135 to simulate weightlessness in outer space. \n\nEach member of the cast performed extensive research for the project to provide an authentic story.

This was surgically corrected four years later and he was returned to flight duty in May of 1969; Manned Spacecraft Center management felt he needed more training time for a lunar mission.<ref>{{cite book|title=Deke!

In reality, Mission Control ''did not'' order the shutdown; Haise found the cells were already dead, because of starvation due to the damage to the oxygen system.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lovell |first=James A. |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-13-1.html |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |date=July 28, 1975 |publisher=NASA |editor-last=Cortright |editor-first=Edgar M. |chapter=3.1 \"Houston, We've Had a Problem\"}}</ref>\n\nThe film depicts Swigert and Haise arguing about who was at fault. The show ''The Real Story: Apollo 13'' broadcast on the Smithsonian Channel includes Haise stating that no such argument took place and that there was no way anyone could have foreseen that stirring the tank would cause problems.<ref>[http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/the-real-story/apollo-13/679/141246 ''The Real Story: Apollo 13''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515223536/http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/the-real-story/apollo-13/679/141246 |date=May 15, 2015 }}, Season 4, Episode 3, 2012.

According to audio of the air-to-ground communications, the actual words uttered by Swigert were \"Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here\". Ground control responded by saying, \"This is Houston. Say again, please.\" Jim Lovell then repeated, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Apollo 13 Technical Air-to-Ground Voice Transmission Transcription |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a13/AS13_TEC.txt |website=NASA.gov |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |access-date=2 July 2022 |date=April 1970}}</ref>\n\nOne other incorrect dialogue is after the re-entry blackout. In the film, Tom Hanks (as Lovell) says \"Hello Houston... this is ''Odyssey''... it's good to see you again.\" In the actual re-entry, the Command Module's transmission was finally acquired by a [[Sikorsky SH-3D Sea King]] recovery helicopter which then relayed communications to Mission Control. CAPCOM astronaut [[Joe Kerwin]] (not Mattingly, who serves as CAPCOM in this scene in the film) then made a call to the spacecraft \"Odyssey, Houston standing by. Over.\" Swigert, not Lovell, replied \"Okay, Joe,\" and unlike the film, this was well before the parachutes deployed; the celebrations depicted at Mission Control were triggered by visual confirmation of their deployment.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://apollo13.spacelog.org/05:22:46:03/#log-line-513963|title= Apollo 13's re-entry transcript on Spacelog|access-date= February 19, 2013|archive-date= December 5, 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131205065914/http://apollo13.spacelog.org/05:22:46:03/#log-line-513963|url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe tagline \"Failure is not an option\", stated in the film by Gene Kranz, also became very popular, but was not taken from the historical transcripts. The following story relates the origin of the phrase, from an e-mail by Apollo 13 [[Flight Dynamics Officer]] Jerry Bostick:\n<blockquote>As far as the expression \"Failure is not an option,\" you are correct that Kranz never used that term. In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on \"What are the people in Mission Control really like?\" One of their questions was \"Weren't there times when everybody, or at least a few people, just panicked?\" My answer was \"No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution.\" I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, \"That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option. Now we just have to figure out who to have say it.\" Of course, they gave it to the Kranz character, and the rest is history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceacts.com/notanoption.htm|title=Origin of Apollo 13 Quote: \"Failure Is Not an Option.\"|publisher=SPACEACTS.COM|access-date=4 April 2010|archive-date=January 23, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123160551/http://www.spaceacts.com/notanoption.htm|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the film, Flight Director Gene Kranz and his White Team are portrayed as managing all of the essential parts of the flight, from liftoff to landing. Consequently, the actual role of the other flight directors and teams, especially [[Glynn Lunney]] and his Black Team, were neglected. In fact, it was Flight Director Lunney and his Black Team who got Apollo 13 through its most critical period in the hours immediately after the explosion, including the mid-course correction that sent Apollo 13 on a \"free return\" trajectory around the Moon and back to the Earth. Astronaut Ken Mattingly, who was replaced as Apollo 13 Command Module Pilot at the last minute by Swigert, later said:\n<blockquote>If there was a hero, Glynn Lunney was, by himself, a hero, because when he walked in the room, I guarantee you, nobody knew what the hell was going on. Glynn walked in, took over this mess, and he just brought calm to the situation. I've never seen such an extraordinary example of leadership in my entire career. Absolutely magnificent. No general or admiral in wartime could ever be more magnificent than Glynn was that night. He and he alone brought all of the scared people together.  And you've got to remember that the flight controllers in those days were\u2014they were kids in their thirties. They were good, but very few of them had ever run into these kinds of choices in life, and they weren't used to that. All of a sudden, their confidence had been shaken. They were faced with things that they didn't understand, and Glynn walked in there, and he just kind of took charge.<ref>Ken Mattingly, quoted in ''Go, Flight! The Unsung Heroes of Mission Control, 1965-1992'', Rick Houston and Milt Heflin, 2015, University of Nebraska Press, p. 221</ref></blockquote>\n\nA [[Audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary track]], recorded by Jim and Marilyn Lovell and included with the Signature Laserdisc and later included on both DVD versions,<ref name=\"DVDInfo\" /> mentions several inaccuracies included in the film, all done for reasons of [[artistic license]]:\n{{Quote box|quote=We were working and watching the controls during that time. Because we came in shallow, it took us longer coming through the atmosphere where we had ionization. And the other thing was that we were just slow in answering.|source=\u2014Jim Lovell, on the real reason for the delay in replying after Apollo 13's four-minute re-entry into Earth's atmosphere<ref name=\"nytlovell\"/>|width=45%|align=right|salign=right}}\n* In the film, Mattingly plays a key role in solving a power consumption problem that Apollo 13 faced as it approached re-entry. Lovell points out in his commentary that this was actually a composite of several astronauts and engineers\u2014including [[Charles Duke]] (whose rubella led to Mattingly's grounding)\u2014all of whom worked to solve that problem.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>\n* When Swigert is getting ready to dock with the LM, a concerned NASA technician says: \"If Swigert can't dock this thing, we don't have a mission.\" Lovell and Haise also seem worried. In his DVD commentary, the real Jim Lovell says that if Swigert had been unable to dock with the LM, he or Haise could have done it. He also says that Swigert was a well-trained Command Module Pilot, and no one was really worried about whether he was up to the job,<ref name=\"nytlovell\"/> but he admitted that it made a nice subplot for the film. What the astronauts were really worried about, Lovell says, was the expected rendezvous between the Lunar Module and the Command Module after Lovell and Haise left the surface of the Moon.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>\n* A scene set the night before the launch, showing the astronauts' family members saying their goodbyes while separated by a road, to reduce the possibility of any last-minute [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of disease, depicted a tradition that did not begin until the [[Space Shuttle program]].<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>\n* The film depicts Marilyn Lovell accidentally dropping her wedding ring down a shower drain. According to Jim Lovell, this did occur,<ref name=\"nytlovell\"/> but the drain trap caught the ring and his wife was able to retrieve it.<ref name=\"DVDLovellCommentary\"/>  Lovell has also confirmed that the scene in which his wife had a nightmare about him being \"sucked through an open door of a spacecraft into outer space\" also occurred, though he believes the nightmare was prompted by her seeing a scene in ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', a 1969 film they saw three months before Apollo 13 launched.<ref name=\"nytlovell\">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/garden/at-the-movies-with-jim-lovell-in-space-no-room-for-fear.html | first= Lena | last= William | date= 19 July 1995 | title= In Space, No Room For Fear | newspaper= The New York Times | access-date= 30 September 2011 | archive-date= February 22, 2017 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170222210328/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/garden/at-the-movies-with-jim-lovell-in-space-no-room-for-fear.html | url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', a 1998 docudrama mini-series based around the Apollo missions\n* ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', a 2013 film about astronauts stranded in Earth orbit\n* [[Survival film]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Include-NASA}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Apollo 13 (film)}}\n{{wikiquotepar|Apollo 13 (film)|the film Apollo&nbsp;13}}\n* {{IMDb title|0112384|Apollo 13}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|67523|Apollo 13}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|134963|Apollo 13}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|apollo_13|Apollo 13}}\n* {{Mojo title|apollo13|Apollo 13}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''Apollo 13''\n|list =\n{{Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Film}}\n{{Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture}}\n{{ScreenActorsGuildAward CastMotionPicture 1995\u20132000}}\n}}\n{{Ron Howard}}\n{{Brian Grazer}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Solar System|Space|Spaceflight|Film}}\n\n[[Category:1990s historical films]]\n[[Category:1995 drama films]]\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:Adventure films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:American aviation films]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:American historical drama films]]\n[[Category:American space adventure films]]\n[[Category:American survival films]]\n[[Category:Apollo 13]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (films)]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about astronauts]]\n[[Category:Films about the Apollo program]]\n[[Category:Films about space hazards]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ron Howard]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Brian Grazer]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Horner]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1967]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1969]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1970]]\n[[Category:Films set in Florida]]\n[[Category:Films set in Houston]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Houston]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Sound Mixing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose editor won the Best Film Editing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Imagine Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:IMAX films]]\n[[Category:Jim Lovell]]\n[[Category:Science docudramas]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American docudrama films]]\n[[Category:Fred Haise]]\n[[Category:Jack Swigert]]\n[[Category:Deke Slayton]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
