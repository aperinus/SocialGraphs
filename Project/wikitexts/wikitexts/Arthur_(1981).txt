Arthur is heir to a portion of his family's vast fortune, but only if he marries the [[Upper class|upper-class]] Susan Johnson, the daughter of a business acquaintance of his father. He does not love Susan, but his family feels that she will make him finally grow up. During a shopping trip in [[Manhattan]], accompanied by his valet, Hobson, Arthur witnesses a young woman, Linda Marolla, shoplifting a necktie. He intercedes with the store security guard on her behalf, and later asks her for a date. Despite his attraction to her, Arthur remains pressured by his family to marry Susan.\n\nWhile visiting his grandmother, Martha, Arthur shares his feelings for Linda, but is warned again that he will be disowned if he does not marry Susan. Hobson, who has been more like a father to him than Arthur's real father, realizes that Arthur is beginning to grow up, and secretly encourages Linda to attend Arthur's engagement party. Hobson confides in Linda that he senses Arthur loves her. Linda crashes the party, held at the estate of Arthur's father, and she and Arthur eventually spend time alone together, which is tracked by both families. Hobson is later hospitalized, and Arthur rushes to his side, vowing to care for the person who has long cared for him. After several weeks, Hobson dies, and then Arthur, who has been sober the entire time, goes on a [[Binge drinking|drinking binge]]. On his wedding day, he visits the diner where Linda works and proposes to her. At the church, he jilts Susan, resulting in her abusive father, Burt Johnson, attempting to stab Arthur with a cheese knife, though he is prevented by Martha.\n\nA wounded Arthur announces in the church that there will be no wedding then passes out soon after. Later, Linda attends to his wounds, and they discuss living a life of poverty. A horrified Martha tells Arthur that he can have his fortune, because no Bach has ever been [[working class]]. Arthur declines, but at the last minute, he talks privately to Martha. When he returns to Linda's side, he tells her that he declined again \u2013 Martha's dinner invitation, he means \u2013 but he did accept $750 million. Arthur's pleased [[chauffeur]] Bitterman drives the couple through Central Park.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Dudley Moore]] as Arthur Bach\n* [[Liza Minnelli]] as Linda Marolla\n* [[John Gielgud]] as Hobson\n* [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]] as Martha Bach\n* [[Jill Eikenberry]] as Susan Johnson\n* [[Stephen Elliott (actor)|Stephen Elliott]] as Burt Johnson\n* [[Thomas Barbour (actor)|Thomas Barbour]] as Stanford Bach\n* [[Ted Ross]] as Bitterman\n* [[Barney Martin]] as Ralph Marolla\n* [[Paul Gleason]] as Executive\n* [[Phyllis Somerville]] as Saleslady\n* [[Lou Jacobi]] as Plant store owner\n* [[Justine Johnston]] as Aunt Pearl\n* [[Irving Metzman]] as Store security guard\n* [[Anne De Salvo]] as Gloria\n* [[Lawrence Tierney]] as Man in Diner Demanding Roll\n* [[Mark Margolis]] (''uncredited'') as Wedding guest\n* [[Gordon Press]] as Change Maker\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nGordon originally wrote the [[title character]] with an American actor in mind.
