It is set in a small town where a new [[psychologist]] ([[Loren Dean]]) gives offbeat advice to the [[neuroticism|neurotic]] residents. Both the psychologist and the town are named Mumford, a coincidence that eventually figures in the plot. The film co-stars [[Hope Davis]], [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], [[Alfre Woodard]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Martin Short]], [[David Paymer]], [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]], [[Ted Danson]], and [[Zooey Deschanel]] in her film debut.\n\n==Plot==\nAs a relative newcomer to an Oregon town that bears his name, Dr. Mumford ([[Loren Dean]]) seems charming and skillful to his neighbors and patients. His unique, frank approach to [[psychotherapy]] soon attracts patients away from the two therapists ([[David Paymer]] and [[Jane Adams (actress, born 1965)|Jane Adams]]) already working in the area.\n\nSoon he is treating a variety of conditions, ranging from the obsession of one man ([[Pruitt Taylor Vince]]) with erotic novels to an unhappily married woman ([[Mary McDonnell]]) and her compulsive shopping. Mumford befriends a billionaire computer mogul ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]) and a cafe waitress ([[Alfre Woodard]]) and attempts to play matchmaker. He also begins to fall for a patient ([[Hope Davis]]) who suffers from [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].\n\nTogether with an attorney ([[Martin Short]]) whom Mumford had rejected as a patient because of his [[narcissism]], the rival therapists conspire to find skeletons in Mumford's closet, hoping to destroy his reputation. Meanwhile, Mumford's inherent likability causes his life to become intertwined with much of the rest of the town.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Dr. Mumford\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Sofie Crisp\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Skip Skipperton\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Lily\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] as Althea Brockett\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Henry Follett\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Nessa Watkins\n* [[Martin Short]] as Lionel Dillard\n* [[David Paymer]] as Dr. Ernest Delbanco\n* [[Jane Adams (actress, born 1965)|Jane Adams]] as Dr. Phyllis Sheeler\n* [[Kevin Tighe]] and [[Dana Ivey]] as Mr. and Mrs. Crisp\n* [[Ted Danson]] as Jeremy Brockett\n* [[Jason Ritter]] as Martin Brockett\n* [[Elisabeth Moss]] as Katie Brockett\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Himself\n* [[Simon Helberg]] as College Roommate\n\nThe film also includes future ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' contestant and winner [[Kelly Monaco]] in a small nonspeaking role.\n\n==Reception==\n''Mumford'' was met with mixed reviews. Many critics expressed a general approval, but questioned the unpleasant back story (which contrasted with the overall tone of the film). The film has a 57% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 5.92/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Memorable moments are few and far between.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mumford |title=Mumford (1999) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date= May 20, 2019 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mumford |title=Mumford Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=April 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave a favorable review: \"There are no earth-shaking payoffs here. No dramatic astonishments, vile betrayals or sexual surprises. Just the careful and loving creation of some characters it is mostly a pleasure to meet. And at its deepest level, profoundly down there below the surface, it is something more, I think: an expression of Kasdan's humanist longings, his wish that people would listen better and value one another more. It is the strangest thing, how this movie sneaks up and makes you feel a little better about yourself.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mumford-1999|title=Mumford (1999) |author-link= Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com |access-date= 2019-02-11 }}</ref>\n\nThe film, based on a $28 million budget,<ref name=\"numbers\" /> was a commercial failure, earning only $4,555,459 in the US.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mumford.htm | title=Mumford (1999) |website= [[Box Office Mojo]] | access-date= February 1, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0140397|Mumford}}\n* {{amg movie|180741|Mumford}}\n* {{mojo title|mumford|Mumford}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|mumford|Mumford}}\n\n{{Lawrence Kasdan}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films about psychiatry]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lawrence Kasdan]]\n[[Category:Touchstone Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Newton Howard]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
