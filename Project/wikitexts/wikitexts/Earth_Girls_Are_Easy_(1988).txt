It has been a long time since they have had female companionship, and they receive a broadcast showing human females. They are titillated by these \"hairless\", shapely creatures, and when they discover that the broadcast came from Earth, they set off and land in [[Southern California]].\n\n[[Valley girl]] Valerie Gail is a [[manicure|manicurist]] at the \"Curl Up & Dye\" [[hair salon]]. When she becomes dissatisfied with the lack of sexual affection from her fianc\u00e9, medical doctor Ted Gallagher, she decides to seduce him by dressing up in lingerie and setting up some romantic touches at home. Instead, she catches him cheating on her with his nurse. She kicks him out and refuses to see him again. The next day, she is sunbathing when the aliens' spaceship crash lands in her pool. She befriends them and calls her [[surf bum]] friend Woody to come drain the pool so the aliens can work on their ship and get it flying again. Meanwhile, she brings them into her home, and, though there is a [[language barrier]] at first, the aliens prove to be quick learners and absorb [[American pop culture]] and language by watching television.\n\nWanting them to blend into their surroundings, Valerie takes them to her friend Candy Pink at the salon. After shaving off the aliens' fur, they turn out to be human-looking and attractive. They all go out and party at Los Angeles nightclubs, where their looks, athleticism, and incredibly long tongues soon catch the eyes of every woman in the place. Valerie and Mac begin to fall for each other and go back to Valerie's house. There, they find out that they are anatomically compatible and have sex.\n\nThe next day, the pool is drained, and Zeebo and Wiploc are working on their ship when Woody stops by and offers to take them to the beach. They agree, and after accidentally holding up a convenience store, Zeebo and Wiploc are soon driving down an L.A. freeway the wrong way, in reverse, with the police in pursuit. Mac finds out his crew mates are in trouble and goes to help, but gets arrested along with Woody in a case of mistaken identity. Valerie smashes the police vehicle to get arrested, too, so she can go with Mac.\n\nThe police pursuit ends in a crash, and Zeebo and Wiploc are taken to the emergency room. There, they are examined by Ted, who discovers they have two hearts. While he is envisioning achieving fame and fortune from his discovery, Valerie and Mac elude the police and enter the emergency room disguised as a doctor and a nurse; they manage to convince Ted he is delusional. They then escape back to Valerie's house where work continues on the space ship. Meanwhile, Valerie and Ted reconcile and plan to go to [[Las Vegas]] to get married immediately.\n\nMac is heartbroken and prepares the ship for take-off. Valerie comes out to say good-bye, followed by Ted, who discovers the ship. While she is struggling to keep him from calling the authorities, Valerie comes to the realization that Mac is the one she truly loves. She gets on the space ship, and they take off.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Valerie Gail\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Mac\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Wiploc\n* [[Damon Wayans]] as Zeebo\n* [[Julie Brown]] as Candy Pink\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Woody\n* [[Charles Rocket]] as Dr. Ted Gallagher\n* [[Larry Linville]] as Dr. Bob\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Dr. Rick\n* [[Nedra Volz]] as Lana\n* Diane Stilwell as Robin\n* [[Angelyne]] as Herself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter the release of Julie Brown's 1984 album ''[[Goddess in Progress]]'', [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] began writing a musical comedy based on the song \"Earth Girls Are Easy\" starring Brown. The film was to have a screenplay written by Brown, Terrence McNally, and [[Charlie Coffey (writer)|Charlie Coffey]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |title=Earth Girls Are Easy |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58037-EARTH-GIRLSAREEASY?sid=32af6ef9-64b6-43ef-ba65-51a1f60d9bc9&sr=15.542492&cp=1&pos=0 |access-date=2022-06-11 |website=AFI Catalog}}</ref> Originally the film was slated to go into production in 1986 but the studio lost confidence in the project when director [[Julien Temple]]'s previous film, ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'', proved to be a dismal box office failure. The role of Valerie Gail was offered to some of the era's box-office draws such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Molly Ringwald]], but when they rejected it, Warner Bros. dropped the project. Several other studios expressed interest in producing the movie, but none wanted Temple to direct. Ultimately, French bank [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]] agreed to finance the film with Temple at the helm (if $4 million was shaved off of the film's estimated $14 million budget) and the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] agreed to distribute it.<ref name=afm>{{cite book|last=Rebello|first=Stephen |title=Grounded By Earth Girls And Lawyers, American Film Magazine|publisher=Billboard Publications, Inc.|date=November 1988|pages=39}}</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography was finally underway in late 1987 and Temple brought his own ideas to the project, including peppering the background with then modern sounding pop songs, featuring an homage to ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' and using iconic model/actress [[Angelyne]] in a brief cameo (the director declared her \"the patron Saint of Los Angeles\").<ref name=afm2 /> However, Temple's studious eye for detail caused delays on the set,<ref name=afm2>{{cite book|last=Rochlin|first=Margy |title=Has Julien Temple Gone Hollywood?|work= American Film Magazine|publisher=Billboard Publications, Inc.|date=November 1988|pages=32, 35, 38}}</ref> and according to producer Tony Garnett, \"The first cut we had of the picture was a problem.\"<ref name=afm /> The film underwent more than five months of post-production tinkering, including the removal of numerous scenes and the production number \"''[[I Like 'em Big and Stupid]]''\" (a different version of the song plays in the club scene;

Based on the movie's screenplay and written by Charlie Coffey and Michael Herrmann, Julie Brown reprised her role of Candy, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] took over the role of Valerie, [[Marc Kudisch]] assumed the role of Ted and [[Hunter Foster]] was cast as Mac. Although costumes and props were utilized, there were no sets and the actors carried their scripts around the stage\u2014these stagings were merely devised to find investors for the show.\n\nThe play did not feature any original songs; the performers sang renditions of 1980s pop songs along with several numbers from the film. The play followed the film's story and scenes pretty closely, but a lot of new dialogue was written, a few characters were omitted and there were some other slight deviations. Audio and video recordings of the September 30, 2002 staging are circulating, and several video clips from this performance have surfaced on YouTube.\n\nDespite positive reaction, the timing of the initial staging was bad (coming mere days after the [[September 11 attacks]]), and even after subsequent readings, the show never attained the investors needed to become a full-blown production.<ref name=rialto>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkinbroadway.com/rialto/past/2002/9_13_02.html|title=''Talkin Broadway: What's New at the Rialto?''|access-date=2009-11-29|work = talkingbroadway.com}}</ref>\n\n===Cast===\n{{col div}}\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Valerie Gail\n* [[Julie Brown]] as Candy Pink\n* [[Marc Kudisch]] as Dr. Ted Gallagher\n* [[Hunter Foster]] as Mac\n* [[Deven May]] as Wiploc\n* Lisa Capps as Nurse/Ensemble\n* Roxanne Barlow as Security Guard/Ensemble\n* Steve Wilson as Security Guard/Ensemble\n{{col div end}}\n\n===Musical numbers===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"[[(Shake That) Cosmic Thing]]\" \u2013 [[The B-52's]] (heard on radio)\n* \"Earth Girls Are Easy\" \u2013 The N (heard on radio)\n* \"[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]\" \u2013 Valerie\n* \"Brand New Girl\" \u2013 Candy, Valerie & Ensemble\n* \"[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|(Let's Get) Physical]]\" \u2013 Ted and Nurse\n* \"[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]\" \u2013 Valerie\n* \"[[California Girls]]\" (partial) \u2013 Mac and Wiploc\n* \"[[Funkytown]]\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"[[I Like 'em Big and Stupid]]\" \u2013 Candy\n\n{{col-break}}\n;Act II\n* \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" \u2013 Mac\n* \"[[Atomic (song)|Atomic]]\" \u2013 Valerie\n* \"[[Roam]]\" \u2013 Entire Cast\n* \"[[Just Like Fred Astaire]]\" \u2013 Mac & Valerie\n* \"'Cause I'm a Blonde\" \u2013 Candy\n* \"Should Have Known Better\" \u2013 Ted\n* \"Moonblind\" \u2013 Mac and Valerie\n* \"Scary Kisses\" \u2013 Valerie, Mac & Cast\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* [http://film.virtual-history.com/film.php?filmid=5804 ''Movie stills''] at Film.virtual-history.com\n\n{{Julien Temple}}\n\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1988 independent films]]\n[[Category:1988 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1988 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s romantic musical films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic musical films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction romance films]]\n[[Category:De Laurentiis Entertainment Group films]]\n[[Category:Films about extraterrestrial life]]\n[[Category:Films based on songs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Julien Temple]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in the San Fernando Valley]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Charlie Coffey (writer)]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Julie Brown]]\n[[Category:Science fiction musical films]]\n[[Category:Vestron Pictures films]]"}]}}}}
