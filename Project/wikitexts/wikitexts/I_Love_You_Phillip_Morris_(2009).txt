He spent his early adult years in [[Virginia Beach]] as a police officer. He plays the organ at church, has unenthusiastic sex with his wife, Debbie, and spends his off-hours searching for his biological mother, who had placed him for adoption as a child. Steven locates his biological mother, but she rejects him.\n\nHe then quits the police force and moves to Texas and works for [[Sysco]], the family business.\n\nAfter a car crash on the way from a homosexual tryst, Steven leaves his family and life behind, though he keeps in touch with his wife and young daughter, and explores the world as his true self \u2013 a gay man. He moves to [[Miami]], where he finds a boyfriend, Jimmy, and they adopt a luxurious [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. To keep themselves in the style to which they have become accustomed, Steven becomes a con man. He is pursued by the police, and, after jumping off a parking garage, is sent to prison, where he falls in love with inmate Phillip Morris.\n\nSteven cannot bear to be separated from Phillip. After being released, he helps get Phillip freed from prison by posing as a lawyer, then attains wealth by fraudulently acquiring a position as Chief Financial Officer of a large medical management company called USAMM.\n\nSteven is eventually caught embezzling. While in the police car, he reminisces about Jimmy in Florida, dying of [[AIDS]]. He asks the police for Phillip's [[insulin]] and injects himself. He goes back to prison, where Phillip is also sent as an accomplice and angrily tells Steven he never wants to see him again. Months later, Phillip learns from another inmate that Steven is dying of AIDS. Heartbroken, Phillip calls Steven while he is in the infirmary and confesses that, while he is still upset with Steven for lying to him, he still loves him. Phillip is later told that Steven has died.\n\nSometime later, Phillip is taken to meet with his lawyer and finds Steven waiting for him. Steven describes how he faked dying of AIDS, to be allowed to see Phillip again, and promises never to lie to him again. He runs one last con to break Phillip out of prison, only to be caught when he runs into an old co-worker.\n\nThe end of the movie explains that the real-life Phillip was released from prison in 2006; but Steven was given a life sentence and is in 23-hour lockup, only having one free hour a day to shower and exercise, which the film implies to be because an official involved in the sentencing had a brother-in-law who was conned by Russell.\n\nThe last scene shows Steven laughing joyfully while running across the prison yard, guards in pursuit, in another attempt to be with Phillip.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[Steven Jay Russell]]\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Phillip Morris\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Jimmy\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Debbie\n* [[Antoni Corone]] as Lindholm\n* [[Brennan Brown]] as Larry Birkheim\n* [[Michael Showers (actor)|Michael Showers]] as Gary\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Houston Cop\n* [[Annie Golden]] as Eudora Mixon\n* [[Griff Furst]] as Mark\n* Michael Mandel as Cleavon\n* Phillip Morris (in an uncredited cameo) as a lawyer during Steven's sentencing\n\n==Production==\nAfter original difficulty finding a U.S. distributor, likely due to its explicit gay sexual content, the film was re-edited.<ref>Toby McDonald, \"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article5908016.ece McGregor gay film too risque for cinema],\" ''Times Online'', March 15, 2009.</ref>  In May 2009, it was announced by [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] that Consolidated Pictures Group had acquired the rights for distribution.<ref>Michael Fleming, \"[https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003478.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 Consolidated loves 'Phillip Morris'],\" ''[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'', May 11, 2009.</ref>\n\nPortions of the film were filmed at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] (also known as Angola) in [[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]].

The advertising campaign (posters, trailers and TV commercials) was accused of minimizing the homosexual themes of the film to present it as a simple comedy, removing the romantic relationship between Steve and Phillip in the film with the aim of attracting a larger audience. [[Ewan McGregor]] was removed from the billing list in the trailer. Lucky Red later claimed to have purchased from its distributor and production company [[EuropaCorp]] as a \"softer\" version of the original, in which most of the homosexual sex scenes between the protagonists Steve and Phillip were removed.<ref>[http://www.cineblog.it/post/21421/il-caso-colpo-di-fulmine-il-mago-della-truffa-cineblog-intervista-la-lucky-red Il caso Colpo di fulmine -
