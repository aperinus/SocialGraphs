It is loosely based on the 2016 [[non-fiction]] [[Hidden Figures (book)|book of the same name]] by [[Margot Lee Shetterly]] about African American female [[mathematician]]s who worked at [[NASA]] during the [[Space Race]]. The film stars [[Taraji P. Henson]], [[Octavia Spencer]], [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]], [[Kevin Costner]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Jim Parsons]], [[Mahershala Ali]], [[Aldis Hodge]], and [[Glen Powell]].\n\nPrincipal photography began in March 2016 in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] and wrapped up in May 2016. Other filming locations included several other locations in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], including [[East Point, Georgia|East Point]], [[Canton, Georgia|Canton]], [[Monroe, Georgia|Monroe]], [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], and [[Madison, Georgia|Madison]].\n\n''Hidden Figures'' had a limited release on December 25, 2016, by [[20th Century Fox]], before going wide in North America on January 6, 2017. It received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances, particularly those of Henson and Spencer, the writing, direction, cinematography, emotional tone, and historical accuracy, although some argued it featured a [[White savior narrative in film|white savior narrative]]. The film was a commercial success, grossing $236 million worldwide against its $25 million production budget. ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' noted it as one of the most profitable releases of 2016, and estimated that it made a net profit of $95.5 million.<ref name=\"profit\" />\n\nThe film was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the top ten films of 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/2016/ |title=National Board of Review Announces 2016 Award Winners |publisher=[[National Board of Review]] |date=November 29, 2016 |access-date=November 29, 2016}}</ref> and received various awards and nominations, including three nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. It also won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Katherine Johnson]] works at the [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]] in 1961, alongside her colleagues [[Mary Jackson (engineer)|Mary Jackson]] and [[Dorothy Vaughan]]. All of them are [[African-American]] women; the unit is [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated by race]] and [[sex segregation|sex]]. White supervisor Vivian Mitchell assigns Katherine to assist Al Harrison's [[Space Task Group]], given her skills in [[analytic geometry]]. She becomes the first Black woman on the team; head engineer Paul Stafford is especially dismissive.\n\nMary is assigned to the space capsule [[heat shield]] team, where she immediately identifies a design flaw. Encouraged by her team leader Karl Zielinski, a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] [[Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]], Mary applies for a NASA engineer position. She is told by Mitchell that, regardless of her mathematics and physical science degree, the position requires additional courses. Mary files a petition for permission to attend all-white [[Hampton High School (Virginia)|Hampton High School]], despite her husband's opposition. Pleading her case in court, she wins over the local judge by appealing to his sense of history, allowing her to attend night classes.\n\nKatherine meets African-American [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] Lt. Col. Jim Johnson, who voices skepticism about women's mathematical abilities. He later apologizes and begins spending time with Katherine and her three daughters. The [[Mercury Seven|Mercury 7]] astronauts visit Langley, and astronaut [[John Glenn]] goes out of his way to greet the West Area women. Katherine impresses Harrison by solving a complex [[mathematical equation]] from redacted documents, as the [[Soviet Union]]'s successful launch of [[Yuri Gagarin]] increases pressure to send American astronauts into space.\n\nHarrison confronts Katherine about her \"breaks,\" unaware that she is forced to walk half a mile (800 meters) to use the nearest bathroom. She angrily explains the discrimination she faces at work, which leads Harrison to knock down the \"Colored Bathroom\" sign and abolish bathroom segregation. He allows Katherine to be included in high-level meetings to calculate the space capsule's re-entry point. Stafford makes Katherine remove her name from reports, insisting that \"[[computer (occupation)|computers]]\" cannot author them, and her work is credited solely to Stafford.\n\nInformed by Mitchell that there are no plans to assign a \"permanent supervisor for the colored group,\" Dorothy learns NASA has installed an [[IBM 7090]] electronic computer that threatens to replace human computers. When a librarian scolds her for visiting the whites-only section, Dorothy takes a book about [[Fortran]] and teaches herself and her West Area co-workers programming. She visits the computer room, successfully starts the machine, and is promoted to supervise the Programming Department; she agrees to do so if thirty of her co-workers are transferred as well. Mitchell finally addresses her as \"Mrs. Vaughan\".\n\nMaking final arrangements for [[Mercury-Atlas 6|John Glenn's launch]], the department no longer needs human computers; Katherine is reassigned to the West Area and marries Jim. On the day of the launch, discrepancies are found in the IBM 7090 calculations, and Katherine is asked to check the capsule's landing coordinates. She delivers the results to the control room, and Harrison allows her inside. After a successful launch and orbit, a warning indicates the capsule's heat shield may be loose. Mission Control decides to land Glenn after three orbits instead of seven, and Katherine supports Harrison's suggestion to leave the retro-rocket attached to help keep the heat shield in place. ''[[Friendship 7]]'' lands successfully.\n\nThough the mathematicians are ultimately replaced by electronic computers, a textual [[epilogue]] reveals Mary obtained her engineering degree and became NASA's first female African-American engineer; Dorothy continued as NASA's first African-American supervisor; and Katherine, accepted by Stafford as a report co-author, went on to calculate the trajectories for the [[Apollo 11]] and [[Space Shuttle]] missions. In 2015, she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. In 2016, NASA dedicated the [[Langley Research Center]]'s Katherine Johnson Computational Building in her honor.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Taraji P.

Lavishly engaging from start to finish, ''Hidden Figures'' may be able to catch the most inopportune movie-goer off guard and cause them to fall for its undeniable and classic storytelling.
