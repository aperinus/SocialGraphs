The film, set in a mansion at the end of the 19th century, is about three sisters and a servant who struggle with the terminal cancer of one of the sisters (Andersson). The servant (Sylwan) is close to her, while the other two sisters (Ullmann and Thulin) confront their emotional distance from each other.\n\nInspired by Bergman's mother, Karin \u00c5kerblom, and his vision of four women in a red room, ''Cries and Whispers'' was filmed at [[Taxinge-N\u00e4sby Castle]] in 1971. Its themes include faith, the [[Feminine psychology|female psyche]] and the search for meaning in suffering, and academics have found Biblical allusions. Unlike previous Bergman films, it uses saturated colour, [[crimson]] in particular.\n\nAfter its premiere in the United States, distributed by [[Roger Corman]] and [[New World Pictures]], the film was released in Sweden and screened out of competition at the [[1973 Cannes Film Festival]]. Following two unsuccessful films by Bergman, ''Cries and Whispers'' was a critical and commercial success. It received five [[46th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including one for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (rare for a foreign-language film). Cinematographer [[Sven Nykvist]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]], and ''Cries and Whispers'' won the [[Guldbagge Award for Best Film]] and other honours.\n\nThe film inspired stage adaptations by [[Ivo van Hove]] and [[Andrei \u0218erban]] and influenced later cinema. It was commemorated on [[Postage stamps and postal history of Sweden|Swedish postage stamps]] referring to a scene in which Andersson and Sylwan replicate the ''[[Piet\u00e0]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a large 19th-century mansion with red walls and carpets, Agnes is dying of [[uterine cancer]].{{efn|Agnes' illness is identified as cancer of the womb by numerous authors.{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=147}}{{sfn|Tapper|2017|pp=100-101}}{{sfn|Luko|2015}} }} Her sisters, Maria and Karin, arrive at their childhood home and take turns with the maid, Anna, watching over Agnes. Anna, more religious than the sisters, prays after she lost her young daughter. When Agnes' doctor David visits, he sees his former lover Maria. Maria remembers their [[adultery|affair]] and her failed marriage with her husband Joakim, who stabbed himself non-fatally in response to the adultery. David tells her that she has become more indifferent. Agnes remembers their mother, who neglected and teased her and favoured Maria, with greater understanding and recalls sharing a moment of sorrow with her. While Agnes' sisters remain emotionally distant, Anna comforts the suffering Agnes by baring her breasts and holding her at night.\n\nAgnes dies after a long period of suffering, and at her wake the priest says that her faith was stronger than his own. Maria tells Karin that it is unusual for them to avoid touching each other or having a deep conversation. She tries to touch Karin, who recoils at the gesture. Karin recalls an earlier occasion at the mansion, where, struggling with [[self-harm]], she mutilated her genitals with a piece of broken glass to repel her husband Fredrik. Karin later dines with Maria, saying that Anna was devoted to Agnes and probably deserves a memento. She says she resents Anna's seeming familiarity with her and Maria, speaks of her own [[Suicide crisis|suicidal tendencies]], and confesses her hatred of Maria and her flirtatiousness and shallow smiles. The sisters reconcile after the argument, touching each other.\n\nIn a dream sequence, Agnes briefly returns to life and asks Karin and then Maria to approach her. Karin, repelled by the invitation, says that she still has life and does not love Agnes enough to join her. Maria approaches the [[undead]] Agnes but flees in terror when she grabs her, saying that she cannot leave her husband and children. Anna re-enters the room and takes Agnes back to bed, where she cradles the dead Agnes in her arms.\n\nThe family decides to send Anna away at the end of the month, with Fredrik refusing to award her with any additional severance pay, and the maid rejects her promised memento. Maria returns to Joakim, and Karin cannot believe Maria's claim that she does not remember their touch. Anna finds Agnes' diary with an account of a visit with Maria, Karin and Anna, with a shared, nostalgic moment on a [[Swing (seat)|swing]]. Agnes wrote that \"come what may, this is happiness.\"\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Viskningar och rop kl\u00e4nning.jpg|thumb|alt=Long, white dress in a museum|[[Ingrid Thulin]]'s dress as Karin.

He decided to shoot ''Cries and Whispers'' in Swedish rather than English (as his previous film, ''[[The Touch (1971 film)|The Touch]]'', had been) and finance it through his production company, Cinematograph. Although he used 750,000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] of his savings and borrowed 200,000 SEK, he also asked the [[Swedish Film Institute]] for help with the film's 1.5-million SEK budget. This attracted some criticism, since Bergman was not an up-and-coming director in the greatest need of subsidy.<ref name=criesandwhispersbergmanfoundation>{{cite web |title=Cries and Whispers |url=http://ingmarbergman.se/en/production/cries-and-whispers |publisher=The Ingmar Bergman Foundation |access-date=28 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815061546/http://ingmarbergman.se/en/production/cries-and-whispers |archive-date=15 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{sfn|Steene|2005|p=44}} To save money, the main actresses and Nykvist returned their salaries as loans and were nominal co-producers.{{sfn|Gado|1986|pp=397\u2013399}}\n\nIn his book, ''Images'', Bergman wrote: \"Today I feel that in ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''\u2014and later in ''Cries and Whispers''\u2014I had gone as far as I could go.

Rice quoted Bergman as saying that he had moved beyond that theme. Rice wrote that ''Cries and Whispers'', following ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]'' (1963) and ''Persona'' (1966), was based more on psychology and [[individuation]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Cries and Whispers: The Complete Bergman |journal=The Massachusetts Review |last=Rice |first=Julian C. |date=Winter 1975 |volume=16 |number=1 |page=147}}</ref> Academic Eva Rueschmann said that [[psychoanalysis]] was an obvious tool with which to study the film, given the subconscious links between its characters.{{sfn|Rueschmann|2000|p=128}}\n\n===Family and detachment===\n[[File:1903 Ludwig Richter.jpg|thumb|alt=Elaborate ink-on-paper drawing of Hansel and Gretel and a witch|Illustration of \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\" by [[Ludwig Richter]]; like ''Cries and Whispers'', the fairy tale suggests familial abandonment.]]\nProfessor [[Egil T\u00f6rnqvist]] examined the film's title. The young Maria whispers to her mother, and Karin and Maria whisper to each other as they bond. According to T\u00f6rnqvist, \"The cries relate to the opposite emotions: anguish, impotence, loneliness\".{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=152}}{{efn|name=\"Title\"|Bergman claimed the title was derived from a description of the music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].<ref name=\"Nyrerod\"/> Editor [[Ken Dancyger]] alternatively related the title to the sounds one makes when one dies.{{sfn|Dancyger|2013|p=385}} }} Professor Emma Wilson described the family's predicament, with Karin feeling endangered by touch and Maria seeking an \"erotic\" touch. However, Maria is repelled by Agnes' decay and her dead body.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=112}} Rueschmann explained Karin's repulsion to touch as a result of her degree of isolation and restraint.{{sfn|Rueschmann|2000|p=141}} The scene where Anna cradles Agnes suggests that touch and sensation are soothing, despite the \"opaque\" question of their relationship, which may be comparable to sisterhood.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=112}}\n\nThe [[magic lantern]] show the sisters enjoy is \"[[Hansel and Gretel]]\", which reveals Agnes' feelings of abandonment and her mother's favouring of Maria; according to Rueschmann, the [[Brothers Grimm]] story of sibling unity contrasts the sisters' estrangement.{{sfn|Rueschmann|2000|p=140}}{{efn|name=\"Lantern\"|Bergman recalled receiving his own [[magic lantern]] at age 10, from his aunt.{{sfn|Steene|2005|p=32}} In his autobiography, he described it as personally significant, and also depicted a magic lantern in ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'' (1982).{{sfn|Sitney|2014|p=49}}}} Cinema historian [[P.&nbsp;Adams Sitney]] wrote that  Hansel and Gretel's parents abandoned them in the forest (symbolism), and Agnes' cancer is the equivalent of the witch in the Brothers Grimm tale.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Color and Myth in Cries and Whispers |journal=Film Criticism |last=Sitney |first=P. Adams |date=Spring 1989 |volume=13 |issue=3 |page=40}}</ref> Karin's cutting of her vulva means that her husband will not have sex with her, and the [[red wine]] symbolises blood from the womb. T\u00f6rnqvist wrote that Karin's transfer of blood from her vulva to her mouth means that she will neither have sex nor speak, and preventing communication reinforces loneliness.{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=157}} Sitney wrote that the family is most united when reading [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', which describes \"male solidarity and chicanery, threatened by female plots for marriage\".{{sfn|Sitney|2014|pp=48-49}} According to Frank Gado, detachment returns after Agnes' funeral. Anna is dismissed without warmth or sympathy, and the men deny her monetary rewards despite years of service. Maria also rejects \"sentimental appeals\" from Karin.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=420}}\n\nFilm scholar [[Marc Gervais]] wrote that ''Cries and Whispers'' has no definitive solution of whether suffering and death have any meaning, citing the pastor who expresses his own doubts and fears when he eulogises Agnes. Gervais likened this to the protagonist of Bergman's earlier ''[[Winter Light]]'', Bergman's own conflicted feelings and his relationship to his father, [[Erik Bergman (Lutheran minister)|Erik]], a minister of the [[Church of Sweden]].{{sfn|Gervais|1999|pp=120-121}}{{efn|Earlier with his 1963 film ''[[Winter Light]]'', which had a clergyman protagonist struggling with his faith while seeing suffering in the world, Bergman took the rare step of sharing the screenplay with Erik, and boasted that the latter read it three times. Bergman was possibly trying to communicate that he understood Erik, though the name of the character, Ericsson (son of Erik), may indicate the character represents Bergman more than his father.{{sfn|Gado|1986|pp=281-282}} }} According to Gervais, the ending presents Bergman's solution: a touch, on certain occasions, can make life worthwhile.{{sfn|Gervais|1999|p=121}} T\u00f6rnqvist compared the ending to that of Bergman's 1957 ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''; it \"points to the past, to a paradisaic existence in ''this'' life, to the communion inherent in childhood that has later been lost\".{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=152}}\n\n===Sex and gender roles===\nCritic Marco Lanzagorta wrote, \"Undeniably, ''Cries and Whispers'' is a film about the world of women, and is very open in terms of the gender and sexual politics that it portrays\".<ref name=\"Lanzagorta\"/> The story fits Bergman's motif of \"warring women\", seen earlier in ''The Silence'' and ''Persona'' and later in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'' (1978).{{sfn|Orr|2014|p=67}} The film inspired essays about Bergman's view of women.{{sfn|Steene|2005|p=889}} Patricia Erens wrote, \"Bergman's women in such films as ''Persona'' and ''Cries and Whispers'' are not simply objects of abuse, but creatures through whom Bergman can express his own subjective fears, his many frustrations and failures at preserving autonomy of self and control of reality\".{{sfn|Erens|1979|p=100}}\n\nFeminists critiqued the film.{{sfn|Steene|2005|p=889}} In ''[[Film Quarterly]]'', Joan Mellen acknowledged that Bergman used his female characters as mouthpieces and his women signify \"the dilemma of alienated, suffering human beings\".<ref name=\"Mellen\">{{cite journal |title=Bergman and Women: Cries and Whispers |journal=[[Film Quarterly]] |last=Mellen |first=Joan |date=Autumn 1973 |volume=27 |issue=1 |page=2|doi=10.2307/1211448 |jstor=1211448 }}</ref> In Bergman's films, women and men fail to find answers to their dilemmas; according to Mellen, the men are unanswered or cannot care for anyone but themselves. However, she wrote that Bergman's women fail because of their biology and an inability to move past their sexuality: \"Bergman insists that because of their physiology, women are trapped in dry and empty lives within which they wither as the lines begin to appear on their faces\".<ref name=\"Mellen\"/> Critic [[Molly Haskell]] assigned ''Cries and Whispers'' to Bergman's later filmography, which differed from his earlier works in their view of women. Women in his early films lived in harmony with each other and had more-complete lives; Bergman used the women in ''Cries and Whispers'' and his later films as \"projections of his soul\", revealing his \"sexual vanity\".{{sfn|Haskell|2016|p=315}} According to Haskell, Bergman attacked his female characters for the attributes he gave them: Karin's repression and Maria's sexuality.{{sfn|Haskell|2016|p=315}}\n\nAcademic Laura Hubner agreed with ''[[CineAction]]'' essayist Varda Burstyn's view that ''Cries and Whispers'' depicts the suppression of women, but it does not endorse the suppression and the film opposes patriarchy.{{sfn|Hubner|2007|p=136}}<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Cries and Whispers Reconsidered |magazine=[[CineAction]] |last=Burstyn |first=Varda |date=January 1986 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=33\u201345}}</ref> Rueschmann traced the emotional estrangement to the women's mother, who reacts to the era's [[gender role]]s with \"boredom, anger and frustration\". According to Rueschmann, her daughters assume (or reject) her position and harm themselves in the process.{{sfn|Rueschmann|2000|p=136}} Agnes' confinement to bed may reflect gender roles and expectations for women about sex, childbirth and death.{{sfn|Rueschmann|2000|p=139}} Author Birgitta Steene disputed what she called Mellen's [[Marxist feminist]] analysis, cross-referencing Bergman's realistic and metaphorical films to say that they are not the product of a sexist outlook.{{sfn|Steene|2005|p=889}}\n\nRueschmann quoted Bergman as saying his \"ceaseless fascination with the whole race of women is one of [his] mainsprings. Obviously such an obsession implies ambivalence; it has something compulsive about it\".{{sfn|Rueschmann|2000|p=128}} However, he doubted that there was much difference between men and women: \"I think that if I had made ''Cries and Whispers'' with four men in the leading roles, the story would have been largely the same\".{{sfn|Tapper|2017|p=50}}\n\n==={{anchor|Myth and Biblical allusions}}Mythical and biblical allusions===\n[[File:LaPieta-MichelAnge detalle.jpg|thumb|alt=Michelangelo's sculpture of Mary holding the dead Jesus|Michelangelo's ''Piet\u00e0''; Agnes' death is reminiscent of Jesus' Passion.]]\nAlthough Agnes' apparent resurrection may reflect Anna's fear (or desire), Emma Wilson wrote that it blurred the line between life and dream and might involve supernatural activity.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=115}} Bergman explained the scene:\n{{blockquote|Death is the ultimate loneliness; that is what is so important. Agnes's death has been caught up halfway out into the void. I can't see that there's anything odd about that. Yes, by Christ there is!
