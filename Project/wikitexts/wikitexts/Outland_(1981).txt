Conditions on Io are difficult; gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, and the spacesuits are cumbersome with limited air. Shifts are long but significant bonuses are paid. The general manager, Mark Sheppard, boasts that productivity has broken all records since he took over. Carol, O'Niel's wife, feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io and leaves with their child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Tarlow, a miner, suffers an attack of [[stimulant psychosis]]{{spaced ndash}}he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit{{spaced ndash}}resulting in death by [[explosive decompression]]. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode and dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus, O'Niel investigates the deaths.\n\nAnother incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone, his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a [[shotgun]]. {{anchor|PDE}}O'Niel and Lazarus discover that Sagan had traces of polydichloric euthimal, a powerful [[amphetamine]]-type drug in his bloodstream, which would allow the miners to work continuously for days at a time until they [[Occupational burnout|burn out]] and turn psychotic after approximately ten months of use. O'Niel uncovers a drug distribution ring run by a corrupt Sheppard and sanctioned by now repentant Montone.\n\nUsing surveillance cameras, O'Niel finds and captures Nicholas Spota, one of Sheppard's dealers, who is murdered before he can be questioned. Montone is found garrotted.  In a meat locker, O'Niel finds the latest shipment of drugs, which was shipped from the space station. He is then attacked there by another dealer, Russell Yario. O'Niel knocks him out, then destroys the shipment of drugs. When Sheppard finds out, he threatens O'Niel and contacts his drug distributor, asking him to send in professional [[contract killer|hitmen]]. O'Niel is prepared, having been monitoring Sheppard's communications.\n\nO'Niel waits for the arrival of the hitmen on a supply shuttle from the other side of Jupiter. Realizing what is coming and with only Dr. Lazarus willing to help him, O'Niel sends a message to his family promising to return to Earth when his \"job is done\". O'Niel ambushes the hitmen one by one. Lazarus helps him kill the first by trapping him in a pressurized corridor; O'Niel activates a bomb, causing an explosive decompression that kills the hitman. The second is killed in a glass greenhouse structure of the outpost when O'Niel tricks him into shooting a window, causing it to break open and blow him out to his death by explosive decompression.\n\nO'Niel is then confronted and attacked by Sheppard's inside man - one of his own deputies, Sgt. Ballard. The two fight outside the outpost near the satellite structure until O'Niel pulls Ballard's oxygen hose, suffocating him as he pushes him into an electrical generation station, vaporizing him on impact. O'Niel then confronts the surprised Sheppard inside the outpost's recreation bar, knocking him out with one punch. It is implied Sheppard will now be brought to justice or murdered by his own associates. O'Niel, however, has already contacted his superiors about Sheppard's associates, some of whom are Con-Am executives, and shortly before his departure receives a communication that warrants have been issued for their arrests. O'Niel bids farewell to Lazarus and leaves on the shuttle to join his wife and son on the journey back to Earth.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Marshal William T.

Everybody said, 'You can't do a Western; Westerns are dead; nobody will do a Western'. I remember thinking it was weird that this genre that had endured for so long was just gone. But then I woke up and came to the conclusion \u2013 obviously after other people \u2013 that it was actually alive and well, but in outer space. I wanted to make a film about the frontier. Not the wonder of it or the glamour of it: I wanted to do something about [[Dodge City]] and how hard life was. I wrote it, and by great fortune Sean Connery wanted to do it. And how many chances do you get to work with Sean Connery?<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/features/peter-hyams-film-by-film/p3 \"Peter Hyams Film by Film\" ''Empire''] accessed 30 July 2014</ref></blockquote>\nThe film was developed at Universal by Hyams and producer Richard Roth. Universal turned it down then Roth, who had a development deal at [[20th Century Fox]] under Alan Ladd Jr, took the project to Ladd's new company, The Ladd Company.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n''Outland'' was filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]], Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, UK, with an initial budget of $12 million.<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news |last=Champlin |first=Charles |title=By Jupiter, The Ladd Co.

This was later changed because many people read it as the number 10, or \"Lo\" (\"low\"). Principal photography took place starting with the miniature models in May 1980 and with the actors beginning in June 1980. Post-production for the film was completed in February 1981.<ref>{{cite web |title=Outland (1981) Production archive |url=http://mondoprop.blogspot.com/2010/02/outland-1981-production-archive.html |website=Mondo Prop |access-date=12 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Outland'' was pioneering as the first motion picture to use [[Introvision]],<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/company/co0065961/ IntroVision] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> a variation on [[Front projection effect|front projection]] that allows foreground, mid-ground and background elements to be combined in the camera, as opposed to using optical processes such as bluescreen matting. This enabled characters to convincingly walk around miniature sets of the mining colony.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music to ''Outland'' was composed and conducted by veteran composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had previously worked with writer/director [[Peter Hyams]] on the science fiction thriller ''[[Capricorn One]]'' (1978) and had recently provided the soundtrack to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (which had a similar style to ''Outland'', reflecting isolation, remoteness and fear). The soundtrack to ''Outland'' has been released three times on disc; 19 November 1993 through [[GNP Crescendo Record Co.|GNP Crescendo]] (with his score to ''[[Capricorn One]]''), June 2000 through [[Warner Music Group]], and a two-disc extended edition released 15 June 2010 through ''[[Film Score Monthly]]''.<ref>[http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/outland.html ''Outland''] soundtrack review at [[Filmtracks.com]].

It opened strongly with [[United States dollar|$]]3,059,638 in weekend box office receipts in the U.S. According to the ''New York Times'' on its opening weekend the film was \"sensational in Los Angeles and on New York's East Side\" but \"played poorly in many small cities.

But the conventions that worked for ''High Noon'' break down in the high-tech atmosphere of ''Outland'' and the story seems trite and dinky\".<ref name=ArnoldG-WP-1981 />\n\nIn ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Michael Blowen was more favorable: \"The parallels between ''Outland'' and [[Fred Zinneman]]'s 1952 western ''High Noon'' are apparent. Writer-director Peter Hyams has transported the characters and motifs from the dusty frontier town of [[Gary Cooper]] to the frontiers of space. While Hyams keeps the story barreling along, he also develops a corollary anti-capitalist theme. Io is an outpost for exploitation, and it doesn't make any difference whether the miners are digging gold in the [[Colorado]] hills or titanium on Jupiter's moon, the greed of the corporate class will prevail. ''Outland'' marks the return of the classic western hero in a space helmet. His outfit has changed and his environment has expanded but he's still the same. When Connery stares down the barrel of that shotgun, you'd better smile\".<ref name=BlowenM-BG />\n\nDesmond Ryan at ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' called it: \"A brilliant sci-fi Western. In many ways, Hyams has made a film that is more frightening than ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', because he surmises that space will change us very little and the real monsters we are liable to encounter will be in the next space suit.\"<ref name=DesmondR-PI>{{cite news | last=Desmond | first=Ryan | title=REVIEW: ''Outland'': A Brilliant Sci-Fi Western | newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date=22 May 1981 }}</ref>\n\nChristopher John reviewed ''Outland'' in ''[[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]]'' #10 and commented that \"''Outland'' is a good movie, and not just for science fiction fans.
