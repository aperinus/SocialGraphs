The film tells the story of a successful writer named Harry Block, played by Allen, who draws inspiration from people he knows in real life, and from events that happen to him, sometimes causing these people to become alienated from him as a result.\n\nThe central plot features Block driving to a university from which he was once thrown out, in order to receive an honorary degree. Three passengers accompany him on the journey: a prostitute, a friend, and his son, whom he has kidnapped from his ex-wife. However, there are many [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, segments taken from Block's writing, and interactions with his own fictional characters. ''Deconstructing Harry'' received moderately positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nOne night, Lucy gets a taxi to the home of author Harry Block. She has just read Harry's latest novel. In the novel, the character Leslie is having an affair with her sister's husband Ken. Lucy is angry because the novel is patently based on her and Harry's own affair; as a result, everyone knows about it. Lucy pulls a gun out of her purse, saying she will kill herself. She then turns the gun on Harry and begins firing. She chases him out onto the roof. Harry insists that he has already been punished: his latest girlfriend Fay has left him for his best friend Larry. To distract Lucy, Harry tells her a story he is currently writing: a semi-autobiographical story of a sex-obsessed young man named Harvey who is mistakenly claimed by Death.\n\nIn therapy, Harry realizes he has not changed since he was a sex-obsessed youth. Harry discusses the honoring ceremony at his old university, taking place the next day; he is particularly unhappy that he has nobody with whom to share the occasion. After the session, Harry asks his ex-wife Joan if he can take their son Hilliard to the ceremony. She refuses, stating that Harry is a bad influence on Hilliard. She is also furious at Harry for the novel he wrote. In it, the character Epstein marries Helen, but the marriage begins to crumble after the birth of their son.\n\nHarry runs into an acquaintance, Richard, who is worried about his health. After accompanying Richard to the hospital, Harry asks him to come to the university ceremony. Richard appears uninterested.  Harry then goes to meet his ex-girlfriend Fay, who reveals that she is now engaged. Harry begs Fay to get back together with him. He asks Fay to accompany him to his ceremony, but it clashes with Fay's wedding, scheduled the following day.\n\nThat night, Harry sleeps with a prostitute, Cookie. Harry then asks Cookie to accompany him to his ceremony.\n\nIn the morning, Richard unexpectedly arrives to join Harry and Cookie on the journey. On a whim, Harry decides to \"kidnap\" his son Hilliard. Along the way, they stop at a carnival, then at Harry's half-sister Doris's. Doris, a devoted [[Jew]], is upset by Harry's portrayals of Judaism in his stories, as is her husband. During the journey, Harry also encounters his fictional creations Ken and Helen, who force him to confront some painful truths about his life. Just before arriving at the university, Richard dies peacefully in the car.\n\nWhile filming, Harry's fictional alter ego, Mel literally slides out of focus, becoming blurred.  The university's staffers gush over Harry, asking what he plans to write next. He describes a story about a man (based on himself) who journeys down to Hell to reclaim his true love (based on Fay) from [[the Devil]] (based on Larry).  Harry and the Devil engage in a verbal duel as to who is truly the more evil of the two.  Harry gets as far as arguing that he is a kidnapper before the story is interrupted by the arrival of the police.  Harry is arrested for kidnapping Hilliard, for possessing a gun (it was Lucy's), and for having drugs in the car (belonging to Cookie).\n\nLarry and Fay come from their wedding to bail Harry out of jail. Harry reluctantly gives them his blessings. Back at his apartment, a miserable Harry fantasizes that the university's ceremony is taking place. The film ends with Harry getting over his writer's block by starting to write a book about a man who, like him, can only function in art, not in his life.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Woody Allen]] as Harry Block\n*[[Richard Benjamin]] as Ken, Harry's Character\n*[[Kirstie Alley]] as Joan, Harry's second wife\n*[[Billy Crystal]] as Larry, Harry's friend / The Devil\n*[[Judy Davis]] as Lucy, Jane's sister\n*[[Bob Balaban]] as Richard\n*[[Julie Kavner]] as Grace\n*[[Elisabeth Shue]] as Fay Sexton, Harry's last girlfriend\n*[[Tobey Maguire]] as Harvey Stern, Harry's character\n*[[Jennifer Garner]] as Woman in the elevator, Harry's character\n*[[Paul Giamatti]] as Prof. Abbott\n*[[Stanley Tucci]] as Paul Epstein, Harry's character\n*[[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Leslie, Harry's character\n*[[Mariel Hemingway]] as Beth Kramer\n*[[Robin Williams]] as Mel, Harry's Character\n*[[Hazelle Goodman]] as Cookie Williams\n*[[Eric Bogosian]] as Burt, Harry's brother-in-law\n*[[Demi Moore]] as Helen, Harry's character\n*[[Caroline Aaron]] as Doris Block, Harry's sister\n*[[Eric Lloyd]] as Hilliard Block, Harry's son\n*[[Amy Irving]] as Jane, Harry's third wife\n*[[Viola Harris]] as Elsie\n*[[Victoria Hale (actress)|Victoria Hale]] as Woman in Shoestore \n*[[Hy Anzell]] as Max Pincus, Harry's character\n*[[Shifra Lerer]] as Dolly Pincus, Harry's character\n\n===Casting===\n\nWoody Allen offered the role of Harry Block to [[Elliott Gould]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Dennis Hopper]] and [[Albert Brooks]], all of whom turned it down.

The rough outline of the plot of ''Deconstructing Harry'', that of an academic on a long drive to receive an honorary award from his old university while reflecting upon his life's experiences, essentially mirrors that of Bergman's ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''.<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971224/REVIEWS/712240301/1023 |title=Deconstructing Harry :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=1997-12-24 |access-date=2012-09-01 |archive-date=2012-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815161637/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19971224%2FREVIEWS%2F712240301%2F1023 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Also, the film is similar to Fellini's ''[[8\u00bd]]'', in that it is about an artist struggling with his current relationships and remembering his old ones, interspersed with dream sequences, as well as his work being based on events from his life.\n\nIt is acknowledged by some critics that Allen based the name of Harry Block on Antonius Block ([[Max von Sydow]]), the protagonist from Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]''.<ref name=\"desser\"/> Some critics, including [[Roger Ebert]], have suggested that the character of Harry Block is based on real-life author [[Philip Roth]] and not on Allen himself.<ref name=\"ebert\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{IMDb title|0118954}}\n*{{AllRovi movie|158645}}\n*{{Mojo title|deconstructingharry}}\n*{{Rotten-tomatoes|deconstructing_harry}}\n\n{{Woody Allen}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1990s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films with atheism-related themes]]\n[[Category:American satirical films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about death]]\n[[Category:Films about Jews and Judaism]]\n[[Category:Films about prostitution in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films distributed by Disney]]\n[[Category:Hollywood Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American nonlinear narrative films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy road movies]]\n[[Category:American comedy road movies]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Woody Allen]]\n[[Category:Films about adultery in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Letty Aronson]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Jean Doumanian]]\n[[Category:1997 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
