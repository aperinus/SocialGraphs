La Sindrome di Stendhal)'' is a 1996 Italian [[Giallo film]] written and directed by [[Dario Argento]] and starring his daughter [[Asia Argento]], with [[Thomas Kretschmann]] and [[Marco Leonardi]]. It was the first Italian film to use [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117658/trivia |title=The Stendhal Syndrome |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> It was a critical and commercial success in Italy, grossing \u20a45,443,000 [[Italian lira]] ([[United States dollar|US]] $3,809,977).\n\nThe title refers to a psychological condition in which a subject enters a [[fugue state]] induced by the presence of art. Argento said he experienced Stendhal syndrome as a child. While touring [[Athens]] with his parents young Dario was climbing the steps of the Parthenon when he was overcome by a trance that caused him to become lost from his parents for hours. The experience was so strong that Argento never forgot it; he immediately thought of it when he came across [[Graziella Magherini]]'s book about the syndrome, which would become the basis of the film.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nDetective Anna Manni travels to [[Florence]] on the trail of a serial rapist and murderer, Alfredo Grossi. While visiting a museum, Anna is overcome by [[Stendhal syndrome]], a condition which causes the sufferer to become overwhelmed when viewing great works of art. When Alfredo learns of Anna's disorder, he uses it to disable her before he kidnaps her and subjects her to a brutal and sadistic sexual attack. Although she manages to escape, Anna is left deeply [[psychological trauma|traumatized]]. Alfredo continues to track her movements and is able to capture her again. This time, however, Anna turns the tables on her abductor, breaking free of his grasp, badly wounding him in the process, and knocking him into a river.\n\nWhile the police, believing Alfredo to be dead, search the river for his body, Anna meets and soon falls in love with Marie, a young French art student. Anna also takes sessions with a psychologist in an effort to come to terms with her own deep-seated emotional trauma. That trauma is intensified when Anna begins to receive phone calls from the supposedly-dead Alfredo. When Marie is found murdered, Anna's psychologist, concerned about her mental state, visits her at home. While he is there, a colleague of Anna's, Marco, calls to notify her that Alfredo's body has in fact been found. This leads to the psychologist realizing the truth, and he confronts Anna with the reality that she herself is Marie's murderer. Marco arrives at Anna's apartment, only to find that she has killed her psychologist as well. As he attempts to take Anna's gun from her, she confesses that Alfredo is now inside her, ordering her to do terrible things, whereupon she murders Marco. The police arrive on the scene and ultimately arrest her after she wanders the streets.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Asia Argento]] as Det. Anna Manni\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Alfredo Grossi\n* [[Marco Leonardi]] as Marco Longhi\n* [[Luigi Diberti]] as Insp.

''Profondo Argento: The Man, the Myths & the Magic'' (FAB Press, 2004), p. 229. {{ISBN|190325423X}}.</ref> [[Thomas Kretschmann]] was cast as Alfredo Grossi because he had previously worked with Asia on the film ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1994) and she recommended him to her father.<ref>Jones, Alan. ''Profondo Argento: The Man, the Myths & the Magic''. (FAB Press, 2004), p. 231. {{ISBN|190325423X}}.</ref>\n\nThe opening scene was shot in [[Florence]] at Italy's famed [[Uffizi Gallery]]. Dario Argento is the only director ever granted permission to shoot there.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe work that Anna literally steps into is a painting by [[Rembrandt]], depicting 17th century policemen and titled ''[[The Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]''. The painting that causes Anna to faint in the museum is ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]].\n\nThe footage of Anna underwater after she faints in the gallery was shot in the sea.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The huge grouper fish that Anna kisses was a remote model that was being pulled through the water by cables attached to a small float on the ocean's surface.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Mere moments after wrapping the underwater shoot, the fish stopped working.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis would be the last fiction feature film for acclaimed director of photography [[Giuseppe Rotunno]]. The following year he shot a documentary on [[Marcello Mastroianni]] before retiring.\n\nGraffiti artists were brought in to cover the walls of Alfredo's underground lair with graffiti. In one night the group created over one hundred square feet of graffiti-covered walls at the location.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis is the second of (to date) five films in which Argento has directed his daughter, Asia, the four others being: ''[[Trauma (1993 film)|Trauma]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1998 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' and ''[[Dracula 3D]]''. She also had roles in ''[[Demons 2]]'' and ''[[The Church (1989 film)|The Church]]'', both of which her father produced.\n\nArgento planned on making a sequel to ''The Stendhal Syndrome'' which would follow detective Anna Manni on another case. However, Asia was unavailable so the character's name was changed (to Anna Mari) and [[Stefania Rocca]] was cast. The resulting film is 2004's ''[[The Card Player]]''.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Versions ===\n\nThe Italian release was around two minutes longer than the English export version, including an additional scene where Anna calls the husband of one of Alfredo's victims and another where she meets Marie's mother, played by Veronica Lazar (whose name is included in the credits of all versions, even those in which she does not appear). These scenes were eventually made available to international audiences on home video but remain in Italian, as dubs in other languages were never created.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Stendhal Syndrome |url=https://www.mondo-digital.com/stendhal.html |website=Mondo Digital |accessdate=2 July 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n\nThe film carries a 77% 'Fresh' rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 13 reviews<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stendhal_syndrome/ |title=The Stendhal Syndrome - Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> indicating positive reviews, and was nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Home Video Release.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117658/awards?ref_=tt_awd |title=The Stendhal Syndrome - Awards |accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nResponse from critics was mixed, with ''[[AllRovi|AllMovie]]''{{'}}s Jason Buchanan calling the film \"a sadistic and disturbing psychological exploration\", but one that is \"ultimately a victim of its own excess and the director's tendency to overcomplicate a fairly simple storyline.\" Buchanan praised the film's \"stunningly visual opening sequence\" and [[Ennio Morricone]]'s \"hauntingly hypnotic score\" but criticized how \"the seemingly meandering plot grinds to a halt just as it should truly shine.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-stendhal-syndrome-v135853/review |title=The Stendhal Syndrome - Review - AllMovie |last=Buchanan |first=Jason |work=[[AllRovi|AllMovie]] |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s David Rooney gave the film a mixed review, praising the film's \"exhilarating\" opening sequence and Giuseppe Rotunno's \"cool and elegant\" cinematography, but lamented that \"[a]s with much of the director\u2019s work, large sections of plot are pure hokum, and the gradual slackening of both pace and suspense in a sluggish second half only underlines the increasing silliness.\"<ref name=Rooney>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/the-stendhal-syndrome-1200445110/ |title=Review: 'The Stendhal Syndrome' |accessdate=20 September 2016 |author=Rooney, David |date=4 February 1996 |work=Variety }}</ref>\n\n[[Maitland McDonagh]] gave a mostly positive review, writing that \"this isn't a return to the baroque heights of ''[[Opera (1987 film)|Opera]]'' and ''[[Tenebrae (film)|Tenebrae]]''.

A new special edition [[DVD]] of the film was released by [[Blue Underground]] on 30 August 2007. Blue Underground went on to release a Blu-ray in 2008 containing, for the first time in an English-friendly release, the uncut original version, including the additional Italian-only scenes (still in Italian, with English subtitles). The company re-released the film in 2017 as a three-disc limited edition.\n\nFor its initial release in the United Kingdom, eleven cuts, primarily to the rape scenes, violence and some dialogue, totalling 2 minutes 47 seconds, were made by the distributor before submission to the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] for a video certificate. However, the uncut version was initially released. Since this had not been submitted to the British Board of Film Classification, this version was withdrawn and re-released.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stendhal Syndrome (The) AKA La Sindrome Di Stendhal (1996) |url=http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=1609 |website=Rewind |publisher=DVD-Compare |accessdate=2 July 2020}}</ref> The 2005 UK DVD release, by Arrow Pictures, had all previous cuts waived and represents the full-length English version, although like all English releases it omits the two scenes then exclusive to the Italian version.
