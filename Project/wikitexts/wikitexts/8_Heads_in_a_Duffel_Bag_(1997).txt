It was the [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of screenwriter [[Tom Schulman]]. In 1998 the film won the [[Brussels International Festival of Fantastic Film]]'s Silver Raven award.\n\n==Plot==\nTommy Spinelli ([[Joe Pesci]]) is a [[Made man|wiseguy]] hired by Benny and Rico, a pair of dimwitted [[hitmen]], to transport a [[duffel bag]] full of severed heads across the United States to [[crime boss]] \"Big Sep\" (as proof of the deaths). While on a [[commercial flight]], his bag is accidentally switched with that of Charlie Pritchett ([[Andy Comeau]]), a friendly, talkative, young American tourist who is going to [[Mexico]] to see his girlfriend Laurie ([[Kristy Swanson]]) and her parents, Dick and Annette ([[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Dyan Cannon]]).\n\nSpinelli harasses Charlie's friends Ernie ([[David Spade]]) and Steve ([[Todd Louiso]]) for information, while Charlie and Laurie attempt to get rid of their rather unfortunate [[luggage]].\n\nAfter Charlie meets with Laurie and her parents at the [[airport]] with the wrong bag, they go to their rooms at the resort in [[Acapulco]], Mexico.\nSoon, Annette mistakenly thinks that Charlie might be a [[serial killer]] on the run once she sees a head in his bag while hiding a gift for him inside the bag. Her husband thinks it's all a [[delusion]] brought on by her [[alcoholism]].\n\nAt first, Charlie and Laurie try to bury the heads in the [[desert]], but a group of thugs steals their car. Then Charlie comes up with an idea that he will give back the heads without anyone noticing, by pretending he forgot to turn in his report back at his [[college]]. In turn, everyone packs up for the airport.\nAt the airport, Charlie accidentally puts a severed head in Dick's carry-on bag, causing him to get arrested. They never leave Acapulco since they have to come up with a new plan to save Dick.\n\nMeanwhile, Tommy, Ernie and Steve start to look for replacement heads, after Charlie tells Tommy he lost one. They start to look in a [[cryonics]] [[Laboratory|lab]], where they store bodies and severed heads, much to Tommy's approval. After getting the replacement heads, Tommy and the others get on a [[Airplane|plane]] and head to Mexico. Tommy threatens Charlie that if he loses more heads, he'll replace them with Charlie's friends and family. After hearing of the airport incident, Benny and Rico decide to collect the heads for themselves.\n\nWhen Fern, Dick's mother, arrives in Mexico, Tommy takes her and the others hostage as he helps Charlie find more heads. They find out that a [[coyote]] took one of the heads from the stolen car. Tommy also realizes that Benny and Rico are going to kill him if he doesn't get the heads across the border in time. Charlie comes up with a plan to save both their lives.\n\nCharlie and Laurie take a severed head to the airport to prove her father's innocence. Benny and Rico try to intervene, but end up getting arrested. It is revealed that Tommy and Charlie set them up. Charlie thanks him for his help, as Tommy departs to [[Hawaii]]. Steve goes insane and starts running around the airport, telling security guards that a severed head is his \"best friend\".\n\nCharlie and Laurie get married, with her mother and father present, Steve is in a [[straitjacket]], Ernie is a [[brain surgeon]], Fern is also present after being thrown out of a moving van when she started to bad-mouth Tommy, and Tommy is enjoying his retirement.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Tommy Spinelli\n* [[Andy Comeau]] as Charlie Pritchett\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as Laurie Bennett\n* [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as Dick Bennett\n* [[Dyan Cannon]] as Annette Bennett\n* [[David Spade]] as Ernie Lipscomb\n* [[Todd Louiso]] as Steve\n* [[Anthony Mangano]] as Rico\n* Joe Basile as Benny\n* Ernestine Mercer as Fern Bennett\n* Howard George as \"Big Sep\"\n\n==Production==\nIn April 1993, it was announced Tom Schulman would write an original idea for [[Caravan Pictures]] that would serve as his directorial debut.<ref name=\"SchulmanDirectForCaravan\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/schulman-to-direct-for-caravan-106239/|title=    Schulman to direct for Caravan  |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 21, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office disappointment, earning a total of $4 million worldwide against a production budget of $3 million.<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web |title=8 Heads in a Duffel Bag (1997) - Financial Information |url=https://the-numbers.com/movie/8-Heads-in-a-Duffel-Bag#tab=summary |website=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] }}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 10% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|8_heads_in_a_duffel_bag}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 15 out of 100 based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/8-heads-in-a-duffel-bag |title= 8 Heads in a Duffle Bag Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=December 27, 2020}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title=8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG (1997) C |work= [[CinemaScore]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nLeonard Klady of [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] wrote: \"There's a germ of a very funny idea in \"8 Heads in a Duffel Bag\" that extends well beyond its offbeat title.
