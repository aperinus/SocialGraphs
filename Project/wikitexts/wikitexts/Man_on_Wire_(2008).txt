The film chronicles [[Philippe Petit]]'s 1974 high-wire walk between the Twin Towers of New York's [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]. It is based on Petit's 2002 book, ''To Reach the Clouds'', released in paperback with the title ''Man on Wire''. The title of the film is taken from the police report that led to the arrest (and later release) of Petit, whose performance lasted for almost an hour. The film is crafted like a [[heist film]], presenting rare footage of the preparations for the event and still photographs of the walk, alongside re-enactments (with [[Paul McGill (actor)|Paul McGill]] as the young Petit) and present-day interviews with the participants, including Barry Greenhouse, an insurance executive who served as the inside man.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/movies/25wire.html |title = Walking on Air Between the Towers |access-date = 16 June 2015 |date = 25 July 2008 |author = A.O.

After months of discussion, Petit agreed, with the condition that he could actively collaborate in the making of the film.\n\nIn an interview conducted during the run of ''Man on Wire'' at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], director [[James Marsh (director)|James Marsh]] explained that he was drawn to the story, in part, because it immediately struck him as \"a [[heist movie]]\", though, as Jean Fran\u00e7ois, one of Petit's collaborators, said, \"It may have been illegal...but it wasn\u2019t wicked or mean.\"<ref name=\"MOW prod\">[http://www.c-e-m.org/wp-content/uploads/manonwire_notasproducao.pdf ''Man on Wire'', Magnolia Pictures]</ref> Marsh also said that, as a New Yorker, he saw the film as a gift to the city after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and hoped to hear people say after seeing the film that they would always think of Petit and his performance when recalling the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]'s twin towers.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.zoom-in.com/sundance/podcasts/on_the_circuit_man_on_wire |title = On The Circuit: Man on Wire &#124;
