Before moving in officially, he meets the concierge, who shows the apartment to him, and also shows him where Simone fell. He visits Simone in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Simone's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella, who has also come to visit. Stella is overwhelmed with emotion and begins talking to Simone, who looks towards her visitors and screams monstrously. The matron insists they leave, having already informed Trelkovsky that he may not speak to Choule. Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's ''[[Enter The Dragon]]''), where Stella fondles him.\n\nOutside the theatre they part ways. Later, Trelkovsky calls up the hospital to enquire about Simone, and is told she has died.\n\nAs Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised repeatedly by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy, for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He discusses this with his friends, who do not find things strange and belittle him for not standing up to his neighbours. He visits the apartment of one of his work friends, who plays a marching band record at a spitefully loud volume. A neighbour politely asks him to turn down the music, as his wife is ill and trying to sleep. Trelkovsky turns the record down, but his friend tells the neighbour that he will play his music as he wants, and that he does not care about his sick wife.\n\nHe receives a visit from one Georges Badar, who secretly loved Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. He receives a postcard that Badar had posted before realising Simone had died. Frequenting the nearby caf\u00e9 which Simone also patronised, he is recognized as the new tenant of her apartment. The owner pressures him into having Simone's regular order, which is then always given to him without being ordered, against his preferences. They are always out of his preferred choice of cigarette, [[Gauloises]], so he develops a habit of ordering [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboros]], which Simone used to order. Nobody has any idea why Simone was suicidal.\n\nTrelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge continue to berate him for making too much noise, and his landlord warns him not to inform the police of the burglary. Suffering from fever and bad dreams, he wakes up one morning to find his face made up. He buys a wig and women's shoes and goes on to dress up (using Simone's dress which he had found in a cupboard) and sit still in his apartment in the dead of night. He suspects that Zy and neighbors are trying to subtly change him into the last tenant, Simone, so that he too will kill himself. He becomes hostile and paranoid in his day-to-day environment (snapping at his friends, slapping a child in a park) and his mental state progressively deteriorates. He has visions of his neighbors playing football with a human head, finds the toilet covered in hieroglyphs, and looking across the courtyard, sees himself standing at his apartment window, looking into the bathroom with binoculars. Trelkovsky runs off to Stella for comfort and sleeps over, but in the morning after she has left for work, he concludes that she too is in on his neighbors' plot, and proceeds to vandalise and burgle her apartment before departing.\n\nAt night he is hit by an elderly couple driving a car. He is not injured too seriously, but receives a sedative injection from the doctor due to his odd behavior \u2013 he perceives the elderly couple as his landlord Zy and wife, and accuses them of trying to murder him. The couple returns him to his apartment. A deranged Trelkovsky dresses up again as a woman and throws himself out of the apartment window in the manner of Simone Choule, before what he believes to be a clapping, cheering audience composed of his neighbors. The suicide attempt wakes up his neighbors, who call the police and attempt to restrain him. He crawls away from them back to his apartment, and jumps out the window a second time moments after the police arrive.\n\nIn the final scene, Trelkovsky is bandaged up in the same fashion as Simone Choule, in the same hospital bed. From his perspective, we see his and Stella's own visit to Simone. Trelkovsky then lets out a monstrous scream as Simone did in the earlier scene.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Roman Polanski]] \u2013 Trelkovsky\n* [[Isabelle Adjani]] \u2013 Stella\n* [[Melvyn Douglas]] \u2013 Monsieur Zy\n* [[Jo Van Fleet]] \u2013 Madame Dioz\n* [[Bernard Fresson]] \u2013 Scope\n* [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]] \u2013 Georges Badar\n* [[Shelley Winters]] \u2013 The Concierge\n* [[Lila Kedrova]] \u2013 Madame Gaderian\n* Patrice Alexsandre \u2013 Robert\n* Romain Bouteille \u2013 Simon\n* [[Josiane Balasko]] \u2013 Viviane\n* [[Claude Dauphin (actor)|Claude Dauphin]] \u2013 Husband at the accident\n* [[Claude Pi\u00e9plu]] \u2013 Neighbor (as Claude Pieplu)\n* [[Jacques Monod (actor)|Jacques Monod]] \u2013 Cafe Owner\n* Jean-Pierre Bagot \u2013 Policeman\n* Jacques Rosny \u2013 Jean-Claude\n* [[Michel Blanc]] \u2013 Scope's Neighbor\n* [[Eva Ionesco]] \u2013 Bettina, Mme Gaderian's Daughter\n* [[Albert Delpy]] \u2013 Neighbour\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough typically labelled as the third part of Polanski's so-called \"Apartment Trilogy\", this came about more by luck than by design. The film adaptation was originally to have been made by British director [[Jack Clayton]], who was attached to the project around seven years before Polanski made it. According to Clayton's biographer Neil Sinyard, Clayton originally tried to make the film ca. 1969 for [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]], from a script by [[Edward Albee]], but this version never made it into production after the relationship between Albee and the studio soured. Paramount bought the rights on Clayton's advice in 1971. Clayton returned to the project in the mid-1970s, and a rough draft script by [[Christopher Hampton]] was written while Clayton was preparing ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]''. By the time Clayton had delivered ''Gatsby'' to Paramount in March 1974, he had learned from [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]] that Polanski was interested in the project and wanted to play the lead role. While Clayton was occupied preparing foreign language versions of ''Gatsby'' for the European market, Paramount studio head [[Barry Diller]] began negotiations with Polanski. Although Clayton later insisted that he was never specifically asked if he was still interested, and never said \"no\" to it, Diller wrongly assumed that Clayton had lost interest and transferred the project to Polanski, without asking Clayton. When he found out, Clayton called Diller in September 1974, expressing his dismay that Diller had given another director a film which (Clayton insisted) had been specifically purchased by the studio for him, and for doing so without consultation.<ref>Neil Sinyard, ''Jack Clayton'' (Manchester University Press, 2000), p. 212</ref>\n\nWhile the main character is clearly paranoid to some extent, the film does not entirely reveal whether everything takes place in his head or if the strange events happening around him exist at least partially, contrary to the previous entries in Polanski's \"apartment trilogy.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film.com/dvds/story/roman-polanskis-apartment-trilogy-still/21687948 |title=Roman Polanski's Apartment Trilogy Still As Artful As Ever |work=Film.com |first=Amanda Mae |last=Meyncke |date=2 July 2008 |access-date=29 November 2008 |archive-date=9 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009165214/http://www.film.com/dvds/story/roman-polanskis-apartment-trilogy-still/21687948 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/07/movie-directo-5.html |date=25 July 2007 |title=Rush Hour 3: Ratner Casts Polanski as Sadistic Cop |work=Variety.com |first=Anne |last=Thompson |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218130807/http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/07/movie-directo-5.html |archive-date=18 February 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/209-A-POLANSKI-GUIDE-TO-URBAN-LIVING.html |title=A Polanski Guide To Urban Living |work=Cinemaretro.com |date=19 August 2009 |access-date=2 October 2021 |archive-date=18 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418220209/http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?%2Farchives%2F209-A-POLANSKI-GUIDE-TO-URBAN-LIVING.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Overview ===\n\nIn his review of the film for ''The Regrettable Moment of Sincerity'', Adam Lippe writes: \"Many would attest that ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' is Polanski's most personal work, given the obvious [[Holocaust]] subject matter, but look beneath the surface, and when the window curtains are drawn aside, Polanski's ''The Tenant'' shines brightest as the work closest to his being.\"<ref name=\"lippe\">Lippe, Adam.

However, the film cannot be viewed as purely driven by a Kafkaesque motif because of the numerous references to Trelkovsky's delirium and heavy drinking. This allows for more than one interpretation.\n\nMost of the action occurs within a claustrophobic environment where dark, ominous things occur without reason or explanation to a seemingly shy protagonist, whose perceived failings as a tenant are ruthlessly pursued by what Trelkovsky himself views as an increasingly cabalistic conspiracy. Minor infringements are treated as serious breaches of his tenancy agreement, and this apparent persecution escalates after he refuses to join his neighbours in a prejudiced campaign to oust a mother with a disabled child.\n\n\"The scheming plots over matters of extraordinary pettiness and inexplicable conspiracies that go on among the neighbours to gang up on others make ''The Tenant'' probably the first Kafkaesque horror film.\"<ref name=\"moira\">Scheib, Richard.

Trelkovsky is viewed with suspicion by almost every other character simply because he has a foreign name. For example, when he tries to report a robbery to the French police he is treated sceptically and told that as a foreigner he should not make trouble. Both the director and the protagonist are outsiders who strive ineffectually for acceptance in what they see as a corrupt and mysterious world.\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \"Trelkovsky exists. He inhabits his own body, but it's as if he had no lease on it, as if at any moment he could be dispossessed for having listened to the radio in his head after 10 P.M.

In the end, it is of little importance who is normal and who is insane. The individual's paranoia equals our well-ordered world's desire to persecute. Nobody can help Trelkovsky - he can't even help himself. In a disenchanted, jaded world with its fixed social order, the individual and one's autonomy have but one fate: Either submission and internalization of people's rules - or insanity. Which is no real choice. Here, the individual is always on the brink of annihilation, about to lose itself.\"<ref>\"Der Titel des Films reicht bis an eine Interpretation heran, die so lauten k\u00f6nnte: Da kam einer in diese wohl geordnete Welt, und man gab ihm die Chance, sich einen Platz zu \"mieten\".

Just like in ''The Shining'', the audience is slowly brought to accept the supernatural by what at first seems a slow descent into madness, or vice versa: \"The audience's predilection to accept a proto-supernatural explanation ''[...]'' becomes so pronounced that at Trelkovsky's break with sanity the viewer is encouraged to take a straightforward hallucination for a supernatural act.\"<ref>Smuts, Aarons (2002).

Timothy Brayton of ''Antagony & Ecstasy'' likens this eternally looping cycle of ''The Tenant'' to the film's recurring [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] motifs:\n\n{{blockquote|\"There is a recurrent motif of Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] that remains unexplained in the film. Ancient Egyptian religious belief, it is important to note, was based on the notion that all things are the same all throughout history: not the same as [[Hinduism]]'s conception that everything has happened before and will happen again, but more the belief that everything is always happening. The best I can come up with is to suppose that Trelkovsky, whether in his mind or in reality, is always the same as Simone. He does not become her, so much as we finally reach a point where the distinction between the two of them is no longer important. Either way, the result is the same: there is no Trelkovsky.

Is poor Trelkovsky haunted by ghosts or does he turn insane? Does a (mysteriously) hostile environment drive him to commit suicide, or do the necessities of a cold reality break a tender soul? Could Trelkovsky be identical to Simone Choul from the beginning? Are we even witnessing Simone Choul's very own death hallucination, with Trelkovsky as nothing but a figment of her dying mind?\"<ref>''\"Was passiert im 'Mieter'? Sucht Geisterspuk den armen Trelkovsky heim oder verf\u00e4llt er schlicht dem Irrsinn? Treibt ihn seine ihm feindlich gesinnte (warum?) Umwelt in einen Freitodversuch oder zerbricht der sch\u00fcchterne, in sich gekehrte junge Mann an der kalten Realit\u00e4t? Ist Trelkovsky etwa mit Simone Clouche identisch?

As Brogan Morris writes in ''Flickering Myth'': \"One of Roman Polanski's recurring motifs has always been the horror of the apartment space. It was as recently as his last film, ''[[Carnage (2011 film)|Carnage]]'', and in a crucial sequence of his masterful ''The Pianist'': it's from an apartment window which Szpilman can do nothing but watch atrocities unfold outside. The fascination is there most obviously, though, in Polanski's 'Apartment Trilogy' ''[...]''. And ''The Tenant'', a blackly comedic meta-horror, is perhaps Polanski's ultimate use of the apartment as a claustrophobic, paranoid zone of terror.\"<ref>Morris, Brogan (2013).

November 2013</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|\"''The Tenant'' also makes an interesting film to read in term of Roman Polanski's own life \u2013 he, like the character he plays, is a Pole who went to live in Paris very shortly after the film was made. His other horror films \u2013 ''Repulsion'', ''Rosemary's Baby'' \u2013 like ''The Tenant'', see the apartment as a home of paranoia and madness. You could extend the analogy further and compare ''Repulsion'', ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Tenant'' to Polanski's ''The Pianist'', where [[Adrien Brody]]'s protagonist, a Jew living in Poland under Nazi occupation, is reduced to hiding a pitiful, starving existence hiding in cubbyholes and the bombed-out ruins of buildings where he cannot be sure whether the people he encounters are friend or foe or will betray him. Polanski himself grew up in the Krakow ghettos as a Jewish child under the Nazi occupation and survived by hiding in the countryside and with other families after his parents were taken to the concentration camps, so perhaps one can see the very personal nature of the recurrent themes of isolation, paranoia and the feeling that the apartment is an alien world in his work.\" |Richard Scheib (Moira: Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review)| ''THE TENANT (Le Locataire)<ref name=\"moira\" />}}\n\n=== Sexual deviance and repression ===\n\nRelated to the aforementioned Kafkaesque guilt and the theme of identity loss, another theme that appears throughout the film is that of sexual deviance and Trelkovsky's increasing trespassing of traditional [[gender role]]s, as he more and more turns into an echo of former tenant Mademoiselle Choule.  [[Germany|German]] reviewer Andreas Staben writes: \"And again, ''[Polanski]'' tells of sexual repression, and in Polanski's astounding, unpretentious performance, Trelkovsky's escape into the identity of Simone Choule appears as a consequential closure of all three films ''[of the Apartment Trilogy]''. Other than was maybe the case still with ''Repulsion'', there can be no talk whatsoever of a psycho-pathological case study anymore: Here, the individual is entirely wiped out and all that remains is the horror of facing a pure void.\"<ref>''\"Und wieder erz\u00e4hlt er auf von sexueller Repression, wobei Trelkovskys Flucht in die Identit\u00e4t Simone Choules in Polanskis erstaunlicher, g\u00e4nzlich unmanirierter Darstellung als konsequenter Endpunkt aller drei Filme erscheint. Von einer psychopathologischen Fallstudie kann hier anders als vielleicht noch bei ''Ekel'' endg\u00fcltig keine Rede mehr sein: Das Individuum wird aufgel\u00f6st und es bleibt nur der Schrecken angesichts des blanken Nichts.\"'' Staben, Andreas.

''[...]'' ''[T]''he confusion of sexual roles is more pronounced here than anywhere else in ''[Polanski's]'' work. The slightly decadent and fetishistic, but innocent, bedtime games of ''[[Cul-de-sac (1966 film)|Cul-de-sac]]'' have developed into the signs of a basic confusion concerning sexual identity. T.'s acquisition of feminine costume and habits speaks to a repressed and disturbing need. He is not attracted to women, in fact cannot perform sexually when Stella (Isabelle Adjani) takes him home. In this respect he is again the counterpart of Simone Schoul who, he is told, was never interested at all in men. As he is drawn more completely into the idea of becoming this woman, T. pauses to speculate about what defines ''him''. If a man loses an arm, he wonders, does the arm or the remaining body define his selfhood? How much can a man lose, change, or give away and still remain 'himself'? Or, to paraphrase the advertisers, does the cigarette make the man?\"|Norman Hale (Movietone News, no. 52, October 1976, p. 38-39)|Review: Tenant<ref>Hale, Norman (1976).
