Winter and Reeves reprised their roles in two sequels: ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]'' (1991) and ''[[Bill & Ted Face the Music]]'' (2020).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2688, humanity exists as a [[utopian]] society due to the inspiration of the [[music]] and [[philosophy]] of the Two Great Ones, Bill S. Preston, Esq., and \"Ted\" Theodore Logan. One of the citizens, Rufus, is tasked by the leaders to travel back to [[San Dimas, California]], in 1988 using a [[phone booth]]-shaped [[time machine]] to ensure that the young Bill and Ted, two dim-witted high school students, successfully pass history class. Should they fail, Ted's father, police Captain Logan, plans to ship Ted to a [[military school]] in Alaska, ending Bill & Ted's fledgling band, Wyld Stallyns, and altering history.\n\nRufus finds the two teens at a [[Circle K]] convenience store, struggling to finish their history report, in which they must describe how historical figures would view the present San Dimas. Rufus offers his help before another phone-booth time machine arrives and future versions of Bill and Ted step out. After assuring the present-day Bill and Ted that Rufus's claims are true and that they can trust him, they disappear in the time booth.\n\nRufus shows Bill and Ted how to operate the time booth, taking them back to 1805 where they find [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] leading his forces against Austria. As Rufus, Bill and Ted return to the present, Napoleon is thrown by a cannonball explosion into their wake, and is dragged through the Circuits of Time along with them. Rufus explains that time will continue to progress normally for Bill and Ted and that they cannot miss their class presentation the next day; he then departs, leaving the empty time booth for them. As they discuss where to go next, they discover Napoleon stuck in a nearby tree, inspiring them to abduct historical figures and take them to the present for their school presentation. They leave Napoleon with Ted's younger brother Deacon before they go.\n\nThey befriend [[Billy the Kid]] in the Wild West, and [[Socrates]] in ancient Greece, before stopping in 15th-century England, where they fall in love with Princesses Joanna and Elizabeth. Their father, the king, tries to have them executed, but Billy and Socrates help them escape. The booth, which is slightly damaged in the process, takes them to the far future, where they find a society that reveres them and their future band. They are inspired to complete their report with \"extra credit\" by abducting [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]]. After a brief stop in prehistoric times to repair the booth, they program it to return to the present, but end up outside the Circle K the night before, where Rufus was first introducing himself. They convince their earlier selves of Rufus's trustworthiness before he reminds them how to get to the next day.\n\nWhen they arrive, they learn that Deacon has abandoned Napoleon at a bowling alley. They leave the other historical figures at the mall to learn about San Dimas while they seek out Napoleon at Waterloop, a local water park. The historical figures get into trouble at the mall and are arrested by Captain Logan.\n\nBill and Ted execute an escape plan based on using the time booth in the future to set up what they need in the present. They break their historical friends out of jail, then present each of them to the assembled school using stage lighting effects and rousing music. Their \"report\" brings the school to their feet, cheering, and they pass the course.\n\nSome time later, Rufus returns, accompanied by the two princesses, whom he has rescued from [[Arranged marriage|pre-arranged marriages]]. He says that they will also be part of Wyld Stallyns, and that the four of them will change the world with their music. He asks to jam with them\u2014but on hearing their fledgling attempts to play, he turns to the movie audience and assures them, \"They ''do'' get better.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=400|align=right\n|image1=Keanu_Reeves_Fantastic_Fest_2014.jpg\n|image2=Alex_winter_2013.jpg\n|image3=George carlin headshot 2008.jpg\n|footer=Keanu Reeves (left), Alex Winter (center), and George Carlin (right)}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Ted \"Theodore\" Logan\n* [[Alex Winter]] as Bill S.

The core plot was similar, with Bill and Ted on the verge of failing their history class, ruining their plans to form a band. However, it deviated from the film version when they borrowed a van from their 28-year-old friend Rufus. While driving the van, they end up in [[Nazi Germany]]; and after some hijinks, bring [[Adolf Hitler]] back to present-day San Dimas before continuing to collect other historical figures.

Alongside Reeves, 24 actors were called back and auditioned in various pairs to find a good chemistry.

Herek stated that their intention was to have [[Eddie Van Halen]] as Rufus, given the frequency of [[Van Halen]] references in the screenplay, but this was not possible because of the low budget for the film. They started looking at other actors who would fit the rock motif, making a short list that had included [[Ringo Starr]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Charlie Sheen]].<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> They soon recognized that no one on this list was a comedian, except for perhaps Starr. Producers [[Scott Kroopf]] and Bob Cort had just finished filming ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' which co-starred [[George Carlin]], and with the film's production nearly complete, were able to get him to complete filming.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe Three Most Important People in the utopian society were envisioned to be portrayed by the band members of [[ZZ Top]]. However, Solomon had connections to the [[E Street Band]], [[The Tubes]] and [[The Motels]], and were able to get [[Clarence Clemons]], [[Fee Waybill]], and [[Martha Davis (musician)|Martha Davis]], respectively, for the Most Important People.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe film's writers, Solomon and Matheson, appear in the film's ice cream scene as the \"stupid\" and \"ugly\" waiters, respectively.

Coronado's auditorium was torn down during 2005-07 renovations, but its unique roof and intricate exterior mosaic, seen in an opening scene when Bill and Ted leave school in a red Mustang, was saved and moved, piece by piece, to the new auditorium. The interior shots of the auditorium were filmed inside the [[East High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|East High School]] auditorium, which was in Phoenix on 48th Street just north of Van Buren. East High School was demolished in 2002 as part of a redevelopment project.  The production also shot a sequence on the Western Street on the back lot of Southwestern Studio in [[Carefree, Arizona]].\n\nThe scenes at the \"Waterloo\" water park are a combination of [[establishing shot]]s at [[Raging Waters]] in San Dimas and shots with the actors at [[Golfland Sunsplash]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Because of the limited budget, they could not close down the waterparks for filming, and thus, all those in the background of these shots were paying customers to the waterparks on those days.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> The bowling alley was a Fair Lanes-branded alley at that time but is now the [[AMF Bowling Center|AMF]] Tempe Village Lanes on Rural Road at [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]], three miles south of [[Arizona State University]]. The mall was Phoenix [[Metrocenter Mall (Phoenix, Arizona)|Metrocenter]], between Peoria and Dunlap Avenues at [[Interstate 17]]. It closed on June 30, 2020.

Winter called the experience of filming these booths difficult because in order to come up with the desired effects, the filming required multiple people to stand inside the booth, which was on a [[gimbal]] in front of a [[green screen]]. Numerous equipment and prop failures ensued, and Reeves has called it \"a death ride canoe from the worst carny ride you've ever been on\".<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nInitially, the film had ended with Bill & Ted giving their report within a small classroom, passing their class, and then going to the prom with the rescued princesses. The production team recognized this felt underwhelming, and created the larger auditorium presentation as to give a better sense of scale, with a sound and light show to make it more dramatic setting.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe initial cut of the film was 2 hours and 25 minutes long, and was pruned significantly. One such filmed scene was a lengthy choreographed song number that would have led off the film, starting with Bill & Ted dancing via air-guitaring on their way to school and ended up getting bullied by jocks once they arrived.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> In February 2020, Winter found some stills from the filmed version of the scene on an old hard drive and shared them on the Internet with some additional details on its production. Winter believed that [[Kenny Ortega]] had been involved in establishing the choreography based on the time period and his recollection. Winter said neither he nor Reeves could dance prior to shooting this scene, so the scene was rehearsed for roughly an hour a day across several weeks concurrent to other parts of filming.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\">{{cite magazine | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/alex-winter-bill-ted-excellent-adventure-lost-scene-interview-955329/ | title = Alex Winter Breaks Down Lost 'Bill and Ted' Dance Sequence, 30 Years Later | first= Krow | last = Grow | date = February 20, 2020 | access-date = February 23, 2020 | magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> Winter identified other scenes that he recalled filming that had been cut, including a scene involving a prom, and a running gag involving the pudding cups and the \"John the Serf\" character that remained in the film's credits.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> While they had tried to find the film reels with this cut footage, Winter said that with the fate of DEG following the film, it is likely lost.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/>\n\nThe picture had been planned for a 1988 release, and filming and production had completed on schedule.

The story of two Californian slackers with a time machine who, for complicated reasons, have to assemble assorted celebrities from history in order to pass a high-school project, it is chiefly remembered for bringing Keanu Reeves to the attention of a mass audience. Classicists, however, will always cherish it as the only film ever to combine the music of Van Halen with Greek philosophy. When Bill and Ted embark on their quest, what should be their first destination if not classical Athens, and who should be the very first 'historical dude' bundled into their time machine if not a bald-headed man in a sheet whom they persist in calling 'Soh-kraytz'?\"<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\">{{cite news |last= Holland |first= Tom | author-link= Tom Holland (author)| title= The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life by Bettany Hughes \u2013 review |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/hemlock-cup-bettany-hughes-review| date= 24 October 2010|newspaper= [[The Observer]] |location=London| access-date= 29 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\n''(It should be noted Holland inaccurately names Socrates as the first historical figure Bill and Ted encounter, when it was actually Billy the Kid.)''</blockquote>\n\nHolland continued: \n<blockquote>Even to metalheads, then, the philosophy of ancient Greece serves as something that is both primal and emblematic of civilisation as a whole. Socrates, in particular, the 'lover of wisdom' who insisted that the most fundamental presumptions of his countrymen should be subjected to experimental investigation, and who ended up being made to drink hemlock for his pains, has always been admired as the very fountainhead of rationalism. Yet when it comes to identifying what he taught and believed, there is a problem, on which ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'', rather unexpectedly, puts its finger. Socrates, transplanted to 1980s California, can only communicate with his abductors by gesturing and gurning \u2013 since Bill and Ted, it goes without saying, speak not a word of ancient Greek. Even the miracle of time travel, it appears, cannot serve to alter what is, for any historian, a most awkward fact: that it is impossible to be certain of what Socrates actually said.<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1989\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = {{flatlist|\n* [[Glam metal]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Strange Things Are Afoot: Bill And Ted Set To Return As Dad Rockers|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2018/05/08/609497035/strange-things-are-afoot-bill-and-ted-set-to-return-as-dad-rockers|access-date=2021-04-23|website=NPR.org|language=en|quote=The original films' soundtracks were hair-metal worship at its finest}}</ref>\n* [[pop rock]]\n* [[funk]]\n}}\n| length     = 40:32\n| label      = [[A&M Records]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe film's soundtrack was released in 1989.<ref>{{Citation|title=Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure - Original Soundtrack {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bill-teds-excellent-adventure-mw0000199013|language=en|access-date=2021-07-16}}</ref> The tracks are as follows:\n\n# \"[[Play with Me (song)|Play with Me]]\" by [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]]\n# \"The Boys and Girls Are Doing It\" by Vital Signs\n# \"Not So Far Away\" by [[Glen Burtnik]]\n# \"Dancing with a Gypsy\" by [[Tora Tora]]\n# \"Father Time\" by [[Shark Island (band)|Shark Island]]\n# \"[[Breakaway (Big Pig song)|Breakaway]]\" by [[Big Pig]]\n# \"Dangerous\" by [[Shark Island (band)|Shark Island]]\n# \"Walk Away\" by Bricklin \n# \"In Time\" by [[Tribe After Tribe|Robbie Robb]] featuring Stevie Salas\n# \"Two Heads Are Better Than One\" by [[Nelson (band)|Power Tool]]\n\nThese tracks are ordered for the album differently than they are in the movie.
