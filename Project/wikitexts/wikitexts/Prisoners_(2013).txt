After police arrest a young suspect and release him, the father of one of the daughters takes matters into his own hands. The film was a financial and critical success, grossing US$122 million worldwide. It was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2013#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2013]], and at the [[86th Academy Awards]], it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn Pennsylvania, carpenter Keller Dover and his family visit their neighbors the Birches for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. That evening, the families' daughters, Anna and Joy, disappear. [[Detective]] Loki arrests Alex Jones, a man driving the RV pointed out by Keller's son. Loki then visits Alex's home where he lives with his aunt Holly, after getting no information via interrogation. Loki then later reveals to the Dovers that Alex is [[intellectually disabled]] with an IQ of a 10 year old and no physical evidence has been found in the RV or his home. \n\nLoki investigates local [[sex offender]] and former priest Patrick Dunn, where he finds a corpse in a hidden cellar. Dunn reveals he killed the man after he [[Sacrament of Penance|confessed]] to murdering sixteen children. The following day, Alex is released. Convinced of his guilt, Keller assaults Alex outside the police station, during which Alex says \"They didn't cry 'til I left them\". Based on this, Keller kidnaps and holds Alex captive in his childhood home. Joy's father Franklin reluctantly accompanies Keller in interrogating and [[torturing]] Alex over the course of several days; his wife Nancy convinces Franklin to stop, but decides not to turn in Keller. \n\nLoki visits the previous owner of the empty home the RV was seen parked in front of, Mrs. Milland. She tells him that her son Barry was kidnapped 26 years prior and was never found. During a [[vigil]] for Anna and Joy, Loki chases and fails to apprehend a hooded figure who then burglarizes the Dover and Birch residences; Keller's wife Grace, who has relapsed into a prescription drug addiction, notices this. Suspicious of Alex's disappearance, Loki follows Keller to the building but leaves when the hooded man, Bob Taylor, is located. Loki detains Taylor and discovers the walls in his home are covered in maze drawings. He stumbles upon several locked crates filled with snakes and bloody clothing. Taylor confesses to the kidnappings and draws mazes in his interrogation room. Frustrated, Loki assaults him, but Taylor gains control of another officer's gun and commits [[suicide]].\n\nThe Dover and Birch families identify photos of the bloodied clothing as their children's. Keller visits Holly to apologize for assaulting Alex. He learns she and her late husband adopted Alex after their son died of [[cancer]]. Meanwhile, Loki notices a resemblance between one of Taylor's mazes and a necklace belonging to the corpse in Dunn's basement. He is informed that most of the bloody clothes were store-bought and soaked with pig blood. He also finds Taylor's footprints below a window at the Dover house, along with Anna's sock.\n\nJoy is found and reunited with her parents, and is hospitalized; the two children were drugged and staged an escape, but Anna was caught. When Keller asks Joy for information, she remembers little, but says she saw him there. Keller realizes she saw him at Holly's house and flees. Loki travels to Keller's building to find him, but instead finds Alex.\n\nKeller arrives at Holly's and she holds him at gunpoint. She reveals that she and her husband abducted children of Christian families as a \"war on God\" to avenge their son's death and make similar families feel the same crisis of faith. Alex (Barry Milland) was their first abduction and Taylor their second. Holly drugs Keller and imprisons him in a hidden pit in her yard, where he finds his daughter's emergency whistle. Loki arrives at Holly's house to inform her Alex has been found. Seeing a photo of her late husband with the maze necklace, he realizes that Holly is the kidnapper and searches for her, finding her in process of giving Anna an injection. Loki kills Holly in a shootout, and rushes Anna to the hospital while wounded.\n\nAnna and Joy visit Loki in the hospital to thank him. Grace acknowledges that Keller will be arrested if found, but insists he is a good man. Later, Loki returns to Holly's house, where he faintly hears Keller blowing the whistle.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as Keller Dover\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Detective Loki<!-- The character's first name is never mentioned--nor is he created by it\u2013-and therefore is not relevant. -->\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Nancy Birch\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Grace Dover \n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Franklin Birch\n* [[Melissa Leo]] as Holly Jones\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Alex Jones\n* [[Dennis Christopher]] as Mr. Jones\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as Ralph Dover\n*[[Brad James]] as Officer Carter\n* [[Zo\u00eb Soul]] as Eliza Birch\n* Erin Gerasimovich as Anna Dover\n* Kyla-Drew Simmons as Joy Birch\n* [[Wayne Duvall]] as Captain Richard O'Malley \n* [[Len Cariou]] as Father Patrick Dunn \n* [[David Dastmalchian]] as Bob Taylor\n* Jeff Pope as Elliot Milland\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAaron Guzikowski wrote the script based on a short story he wrote, involving \"a father whose kid was struck by a hit-and-run driver and then puts this guy in a well in his backyard\".
