Pan takes Goku Jr. to the cemetery to pay their respects to her grandfather and tries to train him to be a warrior, but he has no confidence. At school, he is bullied by classmate Puck and his gang. Upset that Goku Jr. does not stand up for himself, Pan faints and is hospitalized. \n\nGoku Jr. recalls the story of the magical wish-granting Dragon Ball and hopes to use it to heal Pan. The next morning, he encounters Puck and his gang and reveals to them that he is going to Mount Paozu but is ridiculed. Angry, Goku Jr. unleashes some of his power and knocks out the bullies. After following the road for hours, a truck driver gives Goku Jr. a ride but later steals his belongings when he exits the truck to relieve himself. Goku Jr. encounters Puck yet again at a roadside grocery store, who agrees to accompany him so he can watch him be eaten by a monster at Mount Paozu. To acquire supplies for the long journey, Puck steals a cart full of food from the grocery store. Goku Jr. tells Puck about his quest to heal Pan, and though Puck doesn't believe in the Dragon Balls, he decides to help on the off chance it could work, saying he admired Pan's strength.  \n\nAfter encountering and overcoming obstacles along the way, Goku Jr. and Puck are halted by a long wooden bridge which looks dangerously unstable. Puck crosses the bridge first, followed by Goku Jr. who crosses nervously and stumbles due to strong winds. Puck struggles to save Goku Jr., who dangles from a rope above the deep trench below. The bridge collapses, causing Puck to fall into the trench. Goku Jr. manages to cross the ravine and continues his journey alone.\n\nAfter traveling another great distance, Goku Jr. encounters a hostile [[pig]]-like [[demon]]. A [[brown bear]], thankful to Goku Jr. for helping her cub earlier, fights the demon. Goku Jr. becomes enraged and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He easily defeats the demon and passes out. When he comes to, he has no memory of the transformation. He then arrives to the summit of Mount Paozu, where he finds an old house. Inside, he discovers the four-star Dragon Ball and mistakenly believes that only one ball is needed to grant the wish. He tries and fails to make his wish to save Pan. In anger, he shouts at the Dragon Ball and throws the ball away. The Dragon Ball rolls to the feet of Goku Jr.'s ancestor, Goku, who explains that he has to collect all seven to make a wish. Goku informs his descendant that he is strong and brave despite what he thinks of himself. Suddenly, a helicopter descends with Pan and Puck inside. Goku Jr. becomes excited to see everyone alive and well, exclaiming that the Dragon Ball granted his wish. He turns to where Goku stood, and is stunned to see that he has vanished until Goku's voice tells him that it was actually his bravery that restored his grandma and Puck's life.\n\nIn a final farewell, Goku wishes Goku Jr. good luck who boards the helicopter with newfound strength and the four-star Dragon Ball.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
