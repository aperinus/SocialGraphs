It is the third installment of the ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]'' film series. This was intended to be the last film in the franchise, ending it as a [[trilogy]], but a stand-alone [[direct to video]] sequel, ''[[House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute]]'', was released six years later. This is also [[Chris Tucker]]'s debut on film as well as the first film in the series that [[Martin Lawrence]] does not reprise his role as Bilal, nor was he mentioned. Also absent in ''House Party 3'' are three of the members of the R&B group [[Full Force]], who played the bullies in the first two films.\n\n==Plot==\nChristopher, a.k.a. Kid is marrying his girlfriend Veda, while his best friend Peter, a.k.a. Play is dipping his fingers into the music business and attempting to manage a roughneck female [[Rap music|rap]] act called Sex as a Weapon. Play books the ladies for a concert with heavy-hitting promoter Showboat, but when they decide to fire Play and hire a new manager, he has to figure out how to deliver them to the show or face the wrath of Showboat's female security force. Kid and Play talk about their dream to one day open a store to sell their favorite sandwich.\n\nThings eventually begin to spiral out of control for the two, as Play is also planning the bachelor party while trying to keep Kid's three younger cousins from [[Detroit]] (who ironically call themselves Immature) in line, and Kid's ex-girlfriend Sydney has come back to town, which is news that doesn't please Veda at all. To complicate matters more Kid's cousins hijack his bachelor party in retaliation for not letting them perform at it (moving it from the rented hotel ballroom to their Aunt Lucy's house) The party at the ballroom is a bust as Play's cousin Stinky invites very obese women to the party (he's attracted to heavyset women). Meanwhile, Showboat has been out looking for Kid & Play for his money but gets sidetracked briefly by Kid's mischievous cousins. Embarrassed by the poor turnout at his party Kid bails into the corridor and runs into Sydney (who is there for her grandparents' anniversary party). Sydney congratulates Kid and tells him that Veda is good for him. As they hug and part ways Veda comes out of the elevator and sees them hugging. She immediately jumps to the conclusion that Kid slept with her but her Cousin Janelle (who had been dogging Kid and the pending marriage throughout the film) comes to his defense and tell Veda she is wrong to assume Kid cheated. At the same time Play (who also disagreed with Kid getting married) tells Kid he is wrong for wanting to break off the marriage since he's convinced Veda doesn't trust him.\n\nAfter Kid and Veda make up they get a phone call from Kid's Uncle Vester about the party Immature is throwing and head back to his Aunt Lucy's house to find an out of control party in progress (unbeknownst to Aunt Lucy who was up in her room). Just as Kid starts to curse his cousins out Play stops him and convinces him to celebrate his bachelor party here. At that moment Showboat arrives with his female hitmen and are about to attack Kid & Play when he hears Kid's cousins performing at the party, Kid picks up on this and immediately informs Showboat that they were a new act he and Play were working on. Sex as a Weapon arrives and tells Showboat that they didn't like what was done to the three blind rappers earlier in the film (they were stiffed on the pay for a show) so they opted to come back to Kid & Play giving Showboat two new acts instead of just one. Showboat  pays up and everything is seemingly coming back into their control. Even Immature knows how much of an irritation they were so in that resolve they opt to give Kid half of the cash from the party. This cash, however is taken by Aunt Lucy who revealed that she knew all along that there was a party going on and that the money would be just enough to clean her house after it was over. After the drama has settled, Kid & Play enjoy the party and perform one last time together rapping to the crowd along with Sex as A Weapon.\n\nThe next day Kid and Veda finally tie the knot. Play gifts Kid with a brand new Jeep, telling him that their production company is going to be huge. He accepts the Jeep as he and Veda ride off into the sunset.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n\n* [[Christopher \"Kid\" Reid]] as Christopher \"Kid\" Robinson, Jr.\n* [[Christopher Martin (entertainer)|Christopher \"Play\" Martin]] as Peter \"Play\" Martin\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Sylvester \u201cUncle Vester\u201d Robinson\n* [[The Real World: Los Angeles|David Edwards]] as James \"Stinky\" Martin\n* Angela Means as Veda Pratt\n* [[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]] as Sidney\n* [[Chris Tucker]] as Johnny Booze\n* [[Anthony Johnson (actor)|Anthony Johnson]] as Butcher\n* [[Ketty Lester]] as Aunt Lucy\n* [[Khandi Alexander]] as Janelle\n* [[Marques Houston]] as Marques \"Batman\" Houston\n* [[Young Rome|Jerome \"Young Rome\" Jones]] as Jerome \"Romeo\" Jones\n* Don Santos as Don \"Half-Pint\" Santos\n* [[Michael Colyar]] as Showboat\n* [[Reynaldo Rey]] as Mr. Pratt\n* Simply Marvalous as Mrs. Pratt\n* [[TLC (group)|TLC]] as Sex as a Weapon\n* [[Shireen Crutchfield]] as Shireen\n* Freez Luv as Caterer\n* [[Chuckii Booker]] as piano player in the hotel lobby band\n* [[Gilbert Gottfried]] as Luggage Clerk\n}}\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Main|House Party 3 (soundtrack)}}\nA soundtrack containing hip hop and R&B music was released in January 1994 by [[Select Records]].
