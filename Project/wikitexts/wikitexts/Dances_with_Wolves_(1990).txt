Dunbar is wounded in battle at St. David's Field in [[Tennessee]]. The surgeon intends to [[amputate]] Dunbar's leg; choosing death in battle instead, he takes a horse and rides up to and along the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] lines. Confederate forces fire repeatedly at him and miss, and the [[Union Army]] takes advantage of the distraction to mount a successful attack. Dunbar receives both a citation for bravery and medical care that allows him to keep his leg. He is subsequently awarded Cisco, the horse that carried him during his suicide attempt, and his choice of posting. Dunbar requests a transfer to the western [[American Frontier|frontier]], so he can see it before it disappears.\n\nDunbar is transferred to [[Fort Hays]], a large fort commanded by Major Fambrough, who despises Dunbar's enthusiasm.  He agrees to post Dunbar to the furthest outpost under his jurisdiction, [[Fort Sedgwick]], and raises a glass to Dunbar's exit. Unbeknownst to Dunbar, Fambrough, who is severely [[mentally ill]] and has been issuing arbitrary orders with no records kept, kills himself almost immediately after Dunbar's departure. Dunbar travels with Timmons, a mule-wagon provisioner. They arrive to find the fort deserted. Despite the threat of nearby native tribes, Dunbar elects to stay and man the post himself.\n\nHe begins rebuilding and restocking the fort, preferring the solitude, recording many of his observations in his diary. Timmons is killed by [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] on the journey back to Fort Hays. The deaths of both Timmons and Fambrough leave the army unaware of Dunbar's assignment, and no other soldiers arrive to reinforce the post.\n\nDunbar encounters his [[Sioux]] neighbors when they attempt to steal his horse and intimidate him. Deciding that being a target is a poor prospect, he seeks out the Sioux camp and attempts dialogue. On his way, he comes across Stands with a Fist. Captured from her white family, she was adopted and assimilated as the daughter of the tribe's medicine man Kicking Bird. She is ritually mutilating herself in mourning for her late Sioux husband. Dunbar brings her back to the Sioux to recover. Though the tribe is initially hostile, some of the members soon begin to respect him.\n\nDunbar gradually establishes a rapport with Kicking Bird, the warrior Wind in His Hair, and the youth Smiles a Lot, initially visiting each other's camps. The language barrier frustrates them, and Stands with a Fist acts as an interpreter, although with difficulty. She only remembers a little English from her early childhood before the rest of her family was killed during a Pawnee raid.\n\nDunbar discovers that the stories he had heard about the tribe were untrue, and he develops a growing respect and appreciation for their lifestyle and culture. Learning their language, he is accepted as an honored guest by the Sioux after he tells them of a migrating herd of buffalo and participates in the hunt. When at Fort Sedgwick, Dunbar befriends a wolf he dubs \"Two Socks\" for its white forepaws. Observing Dunbar and Two Socks chasing each other, the Sioux give him the name \"Dances with Wolves\". During this time, Dunbar also forges a romantic relationship with Stands with a Fist and supplies the tribe with firearms to help defend the village from an attack by the rival Pawnee tribe. Dunbar eventually wins Kicking Bird's approval to marry Stands with a Fist and abandons Fort Sedgwick.\n\nBecause of the growing threat from the Pawnee and the U.S., Chief Ten Bears decides to move the tribe to its winter camp. Dunbar decides to accompany them, but must first retrieve his diary from Fort Sedgwick, as he realizes that it would provide the army with the means to find the tribe. When he arrives, he finds the fort reoccupied by the U.S. Army. Because of his Sioux clothing, the soldiers open fire, killing Cisco and capturing Dunbar, arresting him as a traitor.\n\nTwo officers interrogate him, but Dunbar cannot prove his story, as a corporal has found his diary and kept it to use as toilet paper. Having refused to serve as an interpreter to the tribes, Dunbar is charged with desertion and transported back east as a prisoner. Soldiers of the escort shoot Two Socks when the wolf attempts to follow Dunbar, despite Dunbar's attempts to intervene.\n\nEventually, the Sioux track the convoy, killing the soldiers and freeing Dunbar. They assert that they do not see him as a white man, but as a Sioux warrior called Dances with Wolves. At the winter camp, Dunbar decides to leave with Stands with a Fist because his continuing presence would endanger the tribe. As they leave, Smiles a Lot returns the diary, which he recovered during Dunbar's liberation, and Wind in His Hair shouts to Dunbar, reminding him that he is Dunbar's friend, a contrast to their original meeting where he shouted at Dunbar in hostility.\n\nU.S. troops are seen searching the mountains, but cannot locate Dunbar or the tribe, while a lone wolf howls in the distance.\n\nAn epilogue states: \"Thirteen years later\u2014their homes destroyed, their buffalo gone\u2014the last band of free Sioux submitted to white authority at [[Fort Robinson]], Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains was gone, and the American frontier was soon to pass into history.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Lt. John J.

The novel was rejected by numerous publishers, but finally was published in paperback in 1988.

The project was turned down by several studios due to the Western genre no longer being popular, following the disastrous box office of [[Heaven's Gate (film)|''Heaven's Gate'']] (1980), as well as the length of the script.
