It was followed by four sequels: ''[[Magnum Force]]'' in 1973, ''[[The Enforcer (1976 film)|The Enforcer]]'' in 1976, ''[[Sudden Impact]]'' in 1983, and ''[[The Dead Pool]]'' in 1988. \n\nIn 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/national-film-registry-matrix-404536 |title='Dirty Harry' Among Films Enshrined in National Film Registry |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=December 19, 2012 |access-date=December 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-12-226/cinematic-firsts-enshrined-in-2012-film-registry/2012-12-19/|title=2012 National Film Registry Picks in A League of Their Own|website=Library of Congress|access-date=April 27, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=June 5, 2020|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. Current word count is 648.--> \nA psychopathic [[sniper]], later referred to as \"Scorpio\", shoots a woman while she swims in a rooftop pool. He leaves behind a threatening letter demanding he be paid $100,000 or he will kill more people. The note is found by [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]] [[Dirty Harry (character)|Inspector Harry Callahan]]. The [[Mayor of San Francisco|mayor]] teams up with the police to track down the killer, although to stall for time, he agrees to Scorpio's demand over Callahan's objections. During his lunch break, Harry foils a bank robbery. He shoots one robber dead, and holds another at gunpoint with his [[Smith & Wesson Model 29]] revolver, bluffing him to surrender with an [[ultimatum]]:\n\n<blockquote>I know what you're thinking: 'Did he fire six shots or only five?'  Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a [[.44 Magnum]], the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk? </blockquote>\n\nHarry is assigned a rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez, against his opposition to working with another inexperienced police officer. Meanwhile, Scorpio is spotted by a police helicopter near [[Saints Peter and Paul Church, San Francisco|Saints Peter and Paul Church]] as he is staking out potential victims, but escapes. Harry and Gonzalez are unsuccessful in finding him, and Harry is beaten after being mistaken for a [[peeping tom]]. After assisting in preventing a suicide, Harry and Gonzalez learn that Scorpio has murdered a 10-year-old African-American boy. Based on his letter, the police think that Scorpio's next victim will be a [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] priest, and set a trap for him. \n\nScorpio eventually arrives, kills a police officer in the shootout that follows, and flees. The next day, the police receive another letter in which Scorpio claims to have kidnapped a teenager named Ann Mary Deacon. He threatens to kill her if he is not given a [[ransom]] of $200,000. Harry is assigned to deliver the money, wearing a radio earpiece so Gonzalez can secretly follow him. Scorpio instructs Harry via payphones to run around the city. They meet at the [[Mount Davidson (California)|Mount Davidson]] cross, where Scorpio beats Harry and admits he intends to kill him and let Ann Mary die. Gonzalez intervenes, and gets shot in the chest. Harry uses a concealed knife to stab Scorpio in the leg, but he escapes. \n\nGonzalez tells Harry he's not cut out for police work and plans to become a teacher instead. Harry learns of Scorpio's hospital visit and a doctor reveals to him that the killer lives in a room at [[Kezar Stadium]]. Harry finds him there and chases Scorpio, shooting him in the leg. Harry [[torture]]s Scorpio into confessing where Ann Mary is being held, but the police only find her corpse. The [[district attorney]] reprimands Harry for his conduct, explaining that because Harry obtained his evidence against Scorpio (namely a rifle in Scorpio's possession) illegally, all of it is inadmissible in court and Scorpio is to be released as a free man. An outraged Harry continues to shadow Scorpio on his own time. Scorpio pays a man $200 to beat him severely and frames Harry for it, forcing Harry to stop following him.\n\nScorpio steals a pistol from a liquor store owner and hijacks a school bus. He contacts the police with another ransom demand that includes a flight out of the [[Charles M. Schulz\u2013Sonoma County Airport|Santa Rosa airport]]. Harry waits for him, then jumps onto the roof of the bus from an overpass. Scorpio crashes the bus into a dirt mound and flees to a nearby [[quarry]], where he takes a hostage before Harry wounds him with a fast-draw. Harry aims his revolver and reprises his ultimatum about losing count of his shots. Scorpio reaches for his gun, but Harry shoots and kills him with his last bullet and removes his police badge, throws it in the nearby water, and walks away.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Inspector [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]]\n* [[Harry Guardino]] as Lieutenant Al Bressler\n* [[Reni Santoni]] as Inspector Chico Gonzalez\n* [[John Vernon]] as the Mayor of San Francisco\n* [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andy Robinson]] as 'Scorpio'\n* [[John Larch]] as Chief of Police Paul Dacanelli\n* [[John Mitchum]] as Inspector Frank DiGiorgio\n* [[Mae Mercer]] as Mrs. Russell\n* Lyn Edgington as Norma Gonzalez\n* [[Ruth Kobart]] as Marcella Platt, school bus driver\n* [[Woodrow Parfrey]] as Mr. Jaffe\n* [[Josef Sommer]] as District Attorney William T.

Reineke\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nThe script, titled ''Dead Right'', by the husband-and-wife team of [[Harry Julian Fink]] and [[R. M. Fink|Rita M. Fink]], was originally about a hard-edged [[New York City]] police inspector, [[Harry Callahan (character)|Harry Callahan]], who is determined to stop Travis, a serial killer, even if he has to skirt the law and accepted standards of policing, blurring the distinction between criminal and cop, to address the question as to how far a free, democratic society can go to protect itself.<ref name=\"Hughes49\">Hughes, p. 49.</ref><ref name=\"McGilligan205\">McGilligan (1999), p. 205.</ref> The original draft ended with a police sniper, instead of Callahan, shooting Scorpio. Another earlier version of the story was set in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Four more drafts of the script were written.\n\nAlthough Dirty Harry is arguably Clint Eastwood's signature role, he was not a top contender for the part. The role of Harry Callahan was offered to [[John Wayne]] and [[Frank Sinatra]],<ref>Munn, Michael, ''John Wayne: The Man Behind The Myth'', pp. unknown</ref> and later to [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Steve McQueen]], and [[Burt Lancaster]].<ref name=\"Hughes49\" /> In his 1980 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', [[George C. Scott]] claimed that he was initially offered the role, but the script's violent nature led him to turn it down. When producer [[Jennings Lang]] initially could not find an actor to take the role of Callahan, he sold the film rights to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]]. Although ABC wanted to turn it into a television film, the amount of violence in the script was deemed excessive for television, so the rights were sold to Warner Bros.<ref>Eliot (2009), p. 134.</ref>\n\nWarner Bros. purchased the script with a view to casting Frank Sinatra in the lead. Sinatra was 55 at the time and since the character of Harry Callahan was originally written as a man in his mid-to-late 50s (and Eastwood was then only 41), Sinatra fit the character profile. Initially, Warner Bros. wanted either [[Sydney Pollack]] or [[Irvin Kershner]] to direct.<ref name=\"McGilligan205\" /> Kershner was eventually hired when Sinatra was attached to the title role, but when Sinatra eventually left the film, so did Kershner.<ref name=\"Eliot133\" />\n\n[[John Milius]] was asked to work on the script when Sinatra was attached, along with Kershner as director. Milius claimed he was requested to write the screenplay for Sinatra in three weeks.<ref>{{cite web|last=P|first=Ken|title=An Interview with John Milius|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/401/401150p8.html|publisher=IGN|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608140015/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/401/401150p8.html|archive-date=June 8, 2010}}</ref> [[Terrence Malick]] wrote a draft of the film (dated November 1970) in which the shooter (also named Travis) was a vigilante who killed wealthy criminals who had escaped justice.<ref>Malick, Milius & Fink, ''Dirty Harry'' November 1970 Script.</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nDetails about the film were first released in film industry trade papers in April. After Sinatra left the project, the producers started to consider younger actors for the role. Burt Lancaster turned down the lead role because he strongly disagreed with the violent, [[Consequentialism|end-justifies-the-means]] moral of the story. He believed the role and plot contradicted his belief in collective responsibility for criminal and social justice and the protection of individual rights.<ref>Buford, Kate; ''Burt Lancaster: An American Life''.</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2017}} [[Marlon Brando]] was considered for the role, but was never formally approached. Both Steve McQueen and [[Paul Newman]] turned down the role.<ref name=\"Hughes49\" /> McQueen refused to make another \"cop movie\" after ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968). Believing the character was too \"right-wing\" for him, Newman suggested that the film would be a good vehicle for Eastwood.<ref name=\"Eliot133\">Eliot (2009), p. 133.</ref>\n\nThe screenplay was initially brought to Eastwood's attention around 1969 by Jennings Lang. Warner Bros. offered him the part while still in post-production for his directorial debut film ''[[Play Misty for Me]]''. By December 17, 1970, a Warner Bros. studio press release announced that Clint Eastwood would star in as well as produce the film through his company, Malpaso.\n\nEastwood was given a number of scripts, but he ultimately reverted to the original as the best vehicle for him.<ref>Richard Schickel commentary, ''Dirty Harry'' Two-Disc Special Edition DVD.</ref> In a 2008 [[MTV]] interview, Eastwood said \"So I said, 'I'll do it,' but since they had initially talked to me, there had been all these rewrites. I said, 'I'm only interested in the original script'.\" Looking back on the 1971 Don Siegel film, he remembered \"[The rewrites had changed] everything. They had Marine snipers coming on in the end. And I said, 'No. This is losing the point of the whole story, of the guy chasing the killer down. It's becoming an extravaganza that's losing its character.' They said, 'OK, do what you want.' So, we went and made it.\"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=June 20, 2008|title=Clint Eastwood Talks About How He Ended Up In 'Dirty Harry,' Whether He'd Return to the Iconic Role|first=Josh|last=Horowitz|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1589746/clint-eastwood-reveals-how-ended-up-dirty-harry.jhtml}}</ref>\n\nScorpio was loosely based on the real-life [[Zodiac Killer]], an unidentified serial killer who had committed five murders in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] several years earlier.<ref>Hughes, p. 52.</ref> Elements of [[Gary Steven Krist]] were also worked into the characterization, as Scorpio, like Krist, kidnaps a young girl and buries her alive while demanding ransom. In a later [[novelization]] of the film, Scorpio was referred to as \"Charles Davis\", a former mental patient from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] who murdered his grandparents as a teenager.<ref>Rock, Philip, ''Dirty Harry''.</ref> There are significant differences between the book and the film. Among the differences are: Scorpio's point of view&nbsp;\u2014 in the book he uses astrology to make decisions (including being inspired to abduct Ann Mary Deacon); Harry working on a murder case involving a mugger before he is assigned to Scorpio; the omission of the suicide jumper; and Harry throwing away his badge at the end.\n\n[[Audie Murphy]] was initially considered to play Scorpio, but he died in a [[1971 Colorado Aviation Aero Commander 680 crash|plane crash]] before his decision on the offer could be made.<ref name=\"Hughes50\">Hughes, p. 50.</ref> When Kershner and Sinatra were still attached to the project, [[James Caan]] was under consideration for the role of Scorpio.<ref name=\"Hughes50\" /> The part eventually went to a relatively unknown actor, [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andy Robinson]]. Eastwood had seen Robinson in a play called ''Subject to Fits'' and recommended him for the role of Scorpio; his unkempt appearance fit the bill for a psychologically unbalanced hippie.<ref name=\"McGilligan207\">McGilligan (1999), p. 207.</ref> Siegel told Robinson that he cast him in the role of the Scorpio killer because he wanted someone \"with a face like a choirboy\". Robinson's portrayal was so memorable that after the film was released he was reported to have received several death threats and was forced to get an unlisted telephone number. In real life, Robinson is a [[pacifism|pacifist]] who deplores the use of firearms. Early in principal photography on the film, Robinson would reportedly flinch in discomfort every time he was required to use a gun. As a result, Siegel was forced to halt production briefly and sent Robinson for brief training in order to learn how to fire a gun convincingly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anecdotage.com/index.php?aid=18673 |title=Anecdotage.Com |publisher=Anecdotage.com |date=September 29, 2012 |access-date=December 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316110530/http://anecdotage.com/index.php?aid=18673 |archive-date=March 16, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMilius says his main contribution to the film was \"a lot of guns.

And the children all end up like a graduation picture, and the teacher is saying, \"What is that object under Andy Robinson?\" and a cop says, \"That's a claymore mine.\" Teacher asks, \"What's a claymore mine?\" And we hear the voice of Harry say, \"If he sets it off, they're all spaghetti.\" Chief says, \"That's enough, Harry.\" Everybody said, \"That's too much, John; we can't have Milius doing this kind of stuff.\" I wanted the guy to be just totally outrageous all the time, and he is.

His face is clearly visible throughout the shot. Eastwood also directed the suicide-jumper scene.\n\nThe line, \"My, that's a big one,\" spoken by Scorpio when Callahan removes his gun, was an [[Ad libitum|ad-lib]] by Robinson. The crew broke into laughter as a result of the [[double entendre]] and the scene had to be re-shot, but the line stayed.\n\nThe final scene, in which Callahan throws his badge into the water, is a homage to a similar scene from 1952's ''[[High Noon]]''.<ref name=\"Eliot138\">Eliot (2009), p. 138</ref> Eastwood initially did not want to toss the badge, believing it indicated that Callahan was quitting the police department. Siegel argued that tossing the badge was instead Callahan's indication of casting away the inefficiency of the police force's rules and bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Eliot138\" /> Although Eastwood was able to convince Siegel not to have Callahan toss the badge, when the scene was filmed, Eastwood changed his mind and went with Siegel's preferred ending.<ref name=\"Eliot138\" />\n\n=== Filming locations ===\nOne evening Eastwood and Siegel had been watching the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in [[Kezar Stadium]] in the last game of the season and thought the eerie Greek [[amphitheater]]-like setting would be an excellent location for shooting one of the scenes where Callahan encounters Scorpio.<ref>McGilligan (1999), p. 206</ref>\n\n'''In [[San Francisco, California]]'''\n* [[555 California Street]], The Bank of America Building\n* California Hall, 625 [[Polk Street]] (formerly the [[California Culinary Academy]])\n* [[San Francisco City Hall]], 1 Dr. Carlton B.
