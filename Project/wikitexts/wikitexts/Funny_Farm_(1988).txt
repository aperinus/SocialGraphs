The film was [[Film adaptation|adapted]] from a 1985 comedic novel of the [[Funny Farm (novel)|same name]] by [[Jay Cronley]]. The movie was filmed on location in Vermont, mostly in [[Townshend, Vermont]]. It was the final film directed by [[George Roy Hill]].\n\n==Plot==\nAndy Farmer (Chase) is a [[New York City]] sports writer who moves with his wife, Elizabeth (Smith) to the seemingly charming town of Redbud, [[Vermont]], so he can write a novel. They do not get along well with the residents, and other quirks arise such as being given exorbitant funeral bills for a long-dead man buried on their land years before they acquired the house. \n\nMarital troubles soon arise from the quirkiness of Redbud as well as the fact that Elizabeth was critical of Andy's [[manuscript]], while writing her own manuscripts for children's books. Andy's publisher stops into town to personally see the manuscript of the novel after letters informing him of his deadline go unanswered. To avoid having to return the advance that the publisher gave him, Andy takes one of Elizabeth's manuscripts and passes it off as his own.  After Elizabeth receives a call from Andy's publisher praising the work on \"his children's book\", she leaves Andy out of anger.\n\nThey soon decide to [[divorce]] and sell their home. To expedite the sale, the Farmers offer the town's residents a $15,000 donation to Redbud, and $50 cash each if they help make a good impression on their prospective home buyers. To that end, the citizens remake Redbud into a perfect [[Norman Rockwell]]-style town. Their charade dazzles a pair of prospective buyers, who make the Farmers an offer on the house; however, Andy declines to sell, realizing that he genuinely enjoys small-town living. \n\nHe and Elizabeth decide to stay together in Redbud, much to the chagrin of the locals, who are now angry that they lost their promised money. Though the mayor does not hold the Farmers liable for the $15,000, as the sale of their house did not occur, Andy decides to pay everyone in Redbud their $50, which helps improve his standing among the townspeople. The film ends with Andy taking a job as a sports writer for the Redbud newspaper, and Elizabeth, now pregnant with their first child, having written multiple children's stories.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chevy Chase]] as Andy Farmer\n*[[Madolyn Smith]] as Elizabeth Farmer\n*[[Kevin O'Morrison]] as Sheriff Ledbetter\n*[[Alice Drummond]] as Ethel Dinges\n*[[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Crocker\n*[[Glenn Plummer]] as Mickey\n*[[Joseph Maher]] as Michael Sinclair\n*[[Bill Fagerbakke]] as Lon Criterion\n*[[Nick Wyman|Nicholas Wyman]] as Dirk Criterion\n*[[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as Gus Lotterhand\n*[[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]] as Crum Petree\n*[[Brad Sullivan]] as Brock\n[[William Duell]] as the old character\n*[[Jack Gilpin]] as Bud Culbertson\n*Caris Corfman as Betsy Culbertson\n\n==Production==\nScreenwriter Jeffrey Boam said he \"loved\" the book. \"It was exactly the kind of movie I always wanted to write,\u201d said Boam. \u201cIt needed a lot of work because it wasn\u2019t told in the fashion that could be filmed, but I loved the idea of working with Chevy.

He does what he does. He made the movie classy, and I think a lot of Chevy\u2019s fans were let down because it wasn\u2019t as raucous and vulgar as they might have expected.\"<ref name=\"boam\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Funny Farm'' received mixed reviews at the time of its release. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 62% rating, based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1007990-funny_farm/|title=Funny Farm (1988) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=July 7, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called the film \"good-natured even when it's not funny,\" and went on to say that its best jokes are recycled from other, better, films.<ref>{{cite web | first=Vincent | last=Canby | title=Review/Film; Rusticicity For Chevy Chase | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/03/movies/review-film-rusticicity-for-chevy-chase.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 3, 1988 | access-date=April 8, 2017}}</ref> In a negative review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Michael Wilmington said \"''Funny Farm'' \u2013 a weak-fish-out-of-water comedy about a New York City couple who see their rural paradise turned into a rustic hell\u2013is a movie with a doubly deceptive title.

Ebert called the film a \"small miracle,\"<ref>{{cite web | first=Roger | last=Ebert | title=Funny Farm | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/funny-farm-1988 | work=RogerEbert.com | publisher=Ebert Digital LLC | date=June 3, 1988 | access-date=April 8, 2017}}</ref> while Siskel said it was \"the best film Chase has made\" and compared it to the films of [[Preston Sturges]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Gene | last=Siskel | title=Chevy Mettle | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-06-12/entertainment/8801060929_1_funny-farm-chevy-chase-vacation-movies | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=June 12, 1988 | access-date=April 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe film grossed $25 million on a $19 million budget, making it a modest box office success, but was seen as an overall disappointment especially considering Chevy Chase's popularity as a comic actor in the 1980s with a handful of box office hits. It was released during a very busy summer movie season. The Tom Hanks comedy ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'', now considered a classic comedy, opened the very same day and became one of the year's highest grossing films while ''[[Crocodile Dundee II]]'' was in its second week of release and also became one of the year's biggest hits. Other releases throughout the summer including ''[[Coming to America]]'', ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', and ''[[Die Hard]]'' all were very high-grossing films giving ''Funny Farm'' a slim chance of high box office results in comparison.\n\nWith the success of ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'' the following year, ''Funny Farm'' did eventually gain a cult following and is now regarded by critics and Chevy Chase fans as one of his best films.\n\nThen-[[U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] viewed this film at [[Camp David]] on June 11, 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sreference/films-viewed-by-president-and-mrs-reagan |title = Films Viewed by President and Mrs. Reagan {{!}} Ronald Reagan}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Christmas films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0095188|title=Funny Farm}}\n*{{Mojo title|funnyfarm|Funny Farm}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|1007990-funny_farm|Funny Farm}}\n\n{{George Roy Hill}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Funny Farm (Film)}}\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1988 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Elmer Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by George Roy Hill]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in Vermont]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vermont]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jeffrey Boam]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
