It stars [[Martin Freeman]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Mos Def]], [[Zooey Deschanel]], [[Bill Nighy]], [[Anna Chancellor]], [[John Malkovich]], and the voices of [[Stephen Fry]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Thomas Lennon]], [[Richard Griffiths]], [[Ian McNeice]], [[Bill Bailey]] and [[Alan Rickman]]. Adams co-wrote the screenplay with [[Karey Kirkpatrick]] but died in 2001, before production began; the film is dedicated to Adams. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $100 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nOne Thursday morning, [[Arthur Dent]] discovers that his house is to be immediately demolished to make way for a bypass. He tries delaying the bulldozers by lying down in front of them. [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]], a friend of Arthur's, convinces him to go to a pub with him. Over several pints of beer, Ford explains that he is an alien from the vicinity of [[Betelgeuse]], and a journalist working on the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (fictional)|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', a universal guide book. Ford warns that the Earth is to be demolished later that day by a race called [[Vogon]]s, to make way for a [[Hyperspace (science fiction)#The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|hyperspace]] bypass.\n\nAs the Vogon fleet arrives in orbit to destroy Earth, Ford rescues Arthur by stowing aboard one of the Vogon ships. The pair are shortly discovered and thrown out an airlock, only to be picked up by the starship ''Heart of Gold''. They find Ford's \"semi-cousin\" [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], the newly elected president of the Galaxy. He has stolen the ship along with [[Trillian (character)|Tricia \"Trillian\" McMillan]], an Earth woman whom Arthur had met previously, and [[Marvin the Paranoid Android]], a [[Major depressive disorder|clinically depressed]] robot.\n\nZaphod seeks the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything to match with the disappointing answer given by the supercomputer [[List of minor The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy characters#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]: \"[[42 (number)|42]]\". He believes that the answer lies on the planet Magrathea, only accessible using the ''Heart of Gold''{{'s}} improbability drive through trial and error.\n\nOn one attempt, they arrive at Viltvodle VI, where Zaphod's opponent, [[List of minor The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy characters#Humma Kavula|Humma Kavula]], resides. Kavula offers the coordinates for Magrathea in exchange for Zaphod recovering the Point-of-View gun, a gun created by Deep Thought that makes anyone it blasts temporarily see things from the shooter's perspective. Trillian is captured by the Vogons as they depart, and the three mount a rescue effort on the Vogon homeworld. Before her rescue, Trillian learns that Zaphod signed the order for the destruction of Earth, thinking that the Vogon with the permission form just wanted his autograph.\n\nThe group escapes the Vogons, followed by Galactic Vice-President [[List of minor The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy characters#Questular Rontok|Questular Rontok]] and the Vogons. They arrive at Magrathea, but trigger its automated missile defense systems. Arthur re-activates the improbability drive to transform the missiles into a bowl of petunias and a whale, allowing them to land safely on the planet. Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian enter a portal to arrive at Deep Thought, though Arthur and Marvin are stranded outside the portal. They learn from Deep Thought that after coming up with the Answer \"42\", its creators had Deep Thought design another computer to come up with the Question, that being Earth. They recover the Point-of-View gun, though Trillian uses it on Zaphod to show him her resentment for his accidental destruction of the Earth. They are captured by unknown entities.\n\nMeanwhile, on Magrathea, Arthur is met by [[Slartibartfast]], one of the planet builders. Slartibartfast takes Arthur to a pocket dimension inside the planet where he shows that a new version of Earth is near completion. Slartibartfast takes Arthur to his recreated home, where inside, the others are enjoying a feast provided by the [[Interdimensional being|pan-dimensional beings]] who commissioned Arthur's original Earth, and who resemble a pair of mice. With Arthur, who was on Earth up until the last minutes, the mice think they can discover the Question by removing his brain. Arthur manages to escape and crush the mice under a teapot; they disappear without a trace.\n\nSuddenly, Questular and the Vogons arrive outside the home and open fire. The group takes shelter in a caravan, but Marvin, left alone, uses the Point-of-View gun to make the entire Vogon force too depressed to continue fighting. The Vogons are taken away, while Zaphod reunites with Questular. Arthur decides to explore the galaxy with Ford and Trillian, allowing Slartibartfast to finalise the new Earth without him. The Heart of Gold crew decides to visit [[the Restaurant at the End of the Universe]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening tombstone stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], the President of the Galaxy\n* [[Mos Def]] as [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]], the \"semi-cousin\" of Zaphod\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]], an Earth woman\n* [[Martin Freeman]] as [[Arthur Dent]], a man who gets roped into Zaphod's quest\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as [[Slartibartfast]], a planet builder\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as [[Marvin the Paranoid Android|Marvin]], an android who is clinically depressed\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Questular, the Vice-President of the Galaxy\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as voice of Marvin\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as voice of Deep Thought, a super-computer\n* [[Stephen Fry]] as Narrator\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Humma Kavula, Zaphod's opponent from the planet Vildvodle VI\n\nIn addition, [[Bill Bailey]] voices the whale, [[Ian McNeice]] voices Kwaltz, [[Richard Griffiths]] voices Jeltz and [[Thomas Lennon]] voices Eddie the computer.

Douglas Adams had been approached by one unnamed producer and separately by the [[American Broadcasting Company]] network during the 1970s to turn the book into a film, but Adams refused both offers, as he feared they wanted to turn the work into \"''Star Wars'' with jokes\".<ref name=\"dwc\"/> In 1982, Adams signed an option for the film with producers [[Ivan Reitman]], [[Joe Medjuck]] and [[Michael C. Gross]], and completed three scripts for them. As part of the rewrites, Medjuck and Gross offered the idea of bringing in either [[Bill Murray]] or [[Dan Aykroyd]] to play Ford Prefect. However, Aykroyd separately proposed a different story to Reitman, which led to this project becoming the basis for ''[[Ghostbusters]]''. This left Adams flustered about the film's development in making sure there was the necessary commitment to the project. However, the event did serve the idea of making Prefect an American as to better draw in that audience.<ref name=\"dwc\"/>\n\nMovement on the film was quiet until around 2001, when director [[Jay Roach]], using the clout he had gained from ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' and ''[[Meet the Parents]]'', secured a new deal with Adams and production through [[Disney]].<ref name=\"dwc\"/> Adams wrote a new script, and Roach sought talent like [[Spike Jonze]] to direct, [[Hugh Laurie]] to play Arthur, and [[Jim Carrey]] as Zaphod, but then Adams died on 11 May 2001. Neither Roach nor the film's executive producer [[Robbie Stamp]] wanted to see their work go for naught after Adams' death. Roach brought in [[Karey Kirkpatrick]] to complete the screenplay based on Adams' final draft, submitted just before his death. Kirkpatrick used what notes Adams had left, finding that Adams was willing to go off the book's narrative to adapt to the film. He considered his screenplay something in the spirit that Adams had set out based on the whole of Adams' work.<ref name=\"dwc\">{{cite web | url = https://thedoctorwhocompanion.com/2017/03/09/star-wars-with-jokes-the-guide-to-the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-movie/ | title = Star Wars with Jokes: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Movie  | first=  Andrew | last= Reynolds | date = 9 March 2017 | access-date = 11 February 2019 | work = The Doctor Who Companion }}</ref>\n\nSome time after Adams' death, Roach decided to drop out of the project, and, on recommendation from Jonze \u2013 one of several directors asked to do the film \u2013 Roach turned to director [[Garth Jennings]] and producer [[Nick Goldsmith]], collectively known as [[Hammer & Tongs]], to take up the work.<ref name=\"dwc\"/><ref name=\"nytdargis\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nIn a [[Slashdot]] interview, Stamp stated the following about the cast:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/articles/05/04/26/1952248.shtml?tid=97&tid=133&tid=214 |title=HHG2G Exec. Producer Robbie Stamp Answers |publisher= [[Slashdot]] |date= 26 April 2005 |access-date=4 June 2011}}</ref>\n* The hardest character to cast was \"the voice of the Guide itself and in the end came back to somebody who was one of the people Douglas himself had wanted, namely Stephen Fry.\"\n* \"Douglas himself is on record as saying that as far as he was concerned the only character who had to be British, indeed English, was [[Arthur Dent]].\"\nStamp also commented on how large a role the studio and screenwriters other than Adams played in making the film:\n* \"I think that a lot of fans would be surprised to know just how much of a free hand we have been given in the making of this movie. I know how easy it is to see every decision to cut a scene as 'studio' pressure but it was always much more to do with pacing and rhythm in the film itself.\"\n* \"The script we shot was very much based on the last draft that Douglas wrote... All the substantive new ideas in the movie... are brand new Douglas ideas written especially for the movie by him... Douglas was always up for reinventing ''HHGG'' in each of its different incarnations and he knew that working harder on some character development and some of the key relationships was an integral part of turning ''HHGG'' into a movie.\"\n\n===Filming===\nShooting was completed in August 2004, and the film was released on 28 April 2005 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and on the following day in Canada and the United States. The pre-title sequence was shot in [[Loro Parque]], [[Puerto de la Cruz]], [[Tenerife]].\n\n===Marketing===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nThe film trailer featured voice over work by [[Stephen Fry]] as the Guide, describing the ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''{{'}}s entry on movie trailers.\n\nAn audio collection called \"Additional Guide Entries\", read by Fry, was released to iTunes to promote the film. The entries were set to music by [[Joby Talbot]] and written by Tim Browse and Sean Soll\u00e9 (with the exception of the ''How to be Cool'' entry, which was also co-written by Yoz Grahame).\n\nThe \"Hitchhiker's Guide to Technology\" claims that if you make yourself a cup of tea and attempt to get an object working and the tea goes cold before you finish, you are dealing with technology. Other guides include the ''Hitchhiker's Guide to Blogging'' the ''Hitchhiker's Guide to Deadlines'', and the ''Hitchhiker's Guide to How to be Cool'' which discusses how an individual can truly be cool, instead of by following crowds, but concludes by suggesting the listener attend a showing of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''. The ''Guide to Websites'', which only appeared on the official UK movie website, described a website as \"a wonderful new invention that allows people you neither know nor care about to inform you what they had for breakfast this morning, without all that tedious mucking about in the postal system\". The ''Guide to Fanboys'', written by [[Touchstone Pictures]]' copywriters as part of their promotion, only ever appeared as website text. Though released at the same time as the iTunes entries, it was never intended to be recorded and is otherwise unconnected with the Fry/Talbot/Browse works.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reaction===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 60% of 200 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.09/10.  The site's consensus reads: \"A frantic and occasional funny adaptation of Douglas Adams' novel.

But it doesn't do justice to the open-ended inventiveness of the original.
