The story was developed by [[Wes Craven]] and [[Bruce Wagner]] and is the third installment in the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]] and stars [[Heather Langenkamp]], [[Patricia Arquette]], [[Laurence Fishburne|Larry Fishburne]], [[Priscilla Pointer]], [[Craig Wasson]], and [[Robert Englund]] as [[Freddy Krueger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/patricia-arquette/person/55374/summary.html|title=Patricia Arquette|author=TV.com|date=September 21, 2011|website=TV.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402031344/http://www.tv.com/patricia-arquette/person/55374/summary.html|archive-date=April 2, 2011|url-status=live|access-date=July 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Dream Warriors'' was theatrically released on February 27, 1987, and grossed $44.8 million domestically on a budget of over $4 million. It received mostly positive reviews from critics and is considered by many to be one of the best films in the ''Elm Street'' series.\n\nThe film was preceded by ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'' (1985) and followed by ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'' (1988).\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1987, a year after the events of [[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge|the previous film]], teenager [[Kristen Parker]] dreams [[Freddy Krueger]] is chasing her. He attacks her in her bathroom after she thinks she already awoke, making it look like she slit her wrist in the real world.\n\nBelieving Kristen to be suicidal, her mother admits her to Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital, where she is placed under the care of Dr. Neil Gordon. At the hospital, Kristen fights the orderlies who try to sedate her because she fears falling asleep. The new intern therapist, [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]], calms her down and befriends her by reciting part of Freddy's [[nursery rhyme]]. Nancy is introduced to the rest of Dr. Gordon's patients: Phillip, a habitual sleepwalker; Kincaid, a tough kid from the streets who is prone to violence; Jennifer, a hopeful television actress prone to cigarette burns; Will, who uses a wheelchair due to a prior suicide attempt; Taryn, a recovering drug addict; and Joey, the youngest, who is too traumatized to speak. One night, Freddy attacks Kristen in her dreams, but she unwittingly pulls Nancy into her dream, allowing them to escape.\n\nKristen reveals that she has been able to pull people into her dreams since she was young. Over the next two nights, Freddy throws Phillip off a roof and kills Jennifer by smashing her head into a television. In their next group session, Nancy reveals to the remaining patients that they are 'the last of the Elm Street kids,' the surviving children of those who banded together and burned Krueger to death many years ago. Both Nancy and Neil encourage them to try group [[hypnosis]] so that they can experience a shared dream and discover their dream powers. In the dream, Joey wanders off and is captured by Freddy, leaving him comatose in the real world; Nancy and Neil are relieved of duty. A nun, Sister Mary Helena, tells Neil that Freddy is the son of a young woman on the hospital staff who was accidentally locked in a room with hundreds of mental patients who raped her continually, and that the only way to stop him is to lay his bones to rest.\n\nHe and Nancy ask her father, officer Donald Thompson, where the bones are hidden, but he is uncooperative. Nancy rushes back to the hospital when she learns that Kristen has been sedated. Neil stays behind to convince Donald to help them. Nancy and the others again engage in group hypnosis to reunite with Kristen but are all separated by Freddy. Taryn and Will are killed by Freddy while Kristen, Nancy, and Kincaid find one another. The trio rescue Joey but are unable to defeat Freddy because he has become too powerful due to the souls he's absorbed. Sensing that his remains have been found, Freddy appropriates his own skeleton and kills Donald before incapacitating Neil. Freddy returns to attack the others but Joey uses his dream power voice to repel him. Donald tells Nancy that he is crossing over but he is revealed to be Freddy and stabs Nancy in the stomach, and tosses her aside. Freddy, believing that Nancy is dead, comes upon Kristen in order to kill her but a still-alive Nancy stabs him with his own glove. Neil manages to recover and purifies Freddy's bones, killing him. After Nancy dies, Kristen manages to awaken everyone and return them to the real world. During the patients' funeral, Neil finds Amanda Krueger's [[tombstone]] and discovers that she is Sister Mary Helena. That evening, he goes to sleep with the Malaysian doll Nancy gave him and Kristen's papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 house nearby, and suddenly Kristen's house lights up from the inside, suggesting that Freddy is not completely defeated.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of cast members of the Nightmare on Elm Street series|List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters}}\n* [[Heather Langenkamp]] as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]]\n* [[Craig Wasson]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Neil Gordon|Dr. Neil Gordon]]\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as [[Kristen Parker]]\n* [[Ken Sagoes]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Roland Kincaid|Roland Kincaid]]\n* [[Robert Englund]] as [[Freddy Krueger]]\n* [[Rodney Eastman]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Joey Crusel|Joey Crusel]]\n* [[Jennifer Rubin (actress)|Jennifer Rubin]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Taryn White|Taryn White]]\n* [[Bradley Gregg]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Phillip Anderson|Phillip Anderson]]\n* [[Ira Heiden]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Will Stanton|Will Stanton]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne|Larry Fishburne]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Max Daniels|Max Daniels]]\n* [[Penelope Sudrow]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Jennifer Caulfield|Jennifer Caulfield]]\n* [[John Saxon]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Donald Thompson|Donald Thompson]]\n* [[Priscilla Pointer]] as Dr. Elizabeth Simms\n* [[Clayton Landey]] as Lorenzo\n* [[Brooke Bundy]] as Elaine Parker\n* [[Nan Martin]] as [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Amanda Krueger|Sister Mary Helena]] \n* Stacey Alden as Nurse Marcie\n* [[Dick Cavett]] as Himself\n* [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] as Herself\n* [[Paul Kent (actor)|Paul Kent]] as Dr. Carver\n\n== Production ==\n===Development===\nFollowing the critical failure of ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge'', New Line Cinema was unsure if they would continue with the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3439820/new-line-nearly-pulled-plug-nightmare-elm-street-sequel-exclusive/|title=New Line Nearly Pulled the Plug After the 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' Sequel (Exclusive)|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=May 31, 2017|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531184137/https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3439820/new-line-nearly-pulled-plug-nightmare-elm-street-sequel-exclusive/|archive-date=May 31, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref> [[Wes Craven]], who wrote and directed the original ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'', did not participate in the first sequel. He had not wanted the original to evolve into a franchise but co-wrote the screenplay for the third installment with the intention that it would end the series. The success of ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors'' prompted a continuation of the series.\n\nCraven's very first concept for the film was to have Freddy Krueger invade the real world: Krueger would haunt the actors filming a new ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' sequel. New Line Cinema rejected the [[metafiction|metacinematic]] idea, but years later, Craven's concept was brought to the screen in ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scriptophobic.ca/2018/07/17/the-dangers-of-sitting-too-close-to-the-tv-in-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-3-dream-warriors-1987/|title=The Dangers of Sitting Too Close to the TV in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987)|first=Paul|last=Farrell|publisher=Scriptophobic|date=July 17, 2018|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref> Craven himself would be unavailable for directing, as he was tied up with filming ''[[Deadly Friend]]'' around the same time.<ref name=\"neversleepagain\">{{cite AV media | url=https://www.amazon.com/Never-Sleep-Again-Street-Blu-ray/dp/B00G6TPQ1C/ | title=Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy | type=documentary | format=Blu-ray | people=Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp, Wes Craven, Lisa Wilcox, Alice Cooper, Andrew Kasch, Daniel Farrands, Thommy Hutson | website=Amazon.com | date=May 4, 2010 | access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nBefore it was decided what script would be used for the film's story, both John Saxon and Robert Englund wrote their own scripts for a third ''Nightmare'' film; in Saxon's script called ''How the Nightmare on Elm Street All Began'', which would have been a [[prequel]] story, Freddy would ultimately turn out to have been innocent, or at least set up for the murders by [[Charles Manson]], who along with his [[Manson Family|followers]] would have been the main culprit of the murders; Freddy would be forced by the mob of angry parents to make a confession of the crimes, which would enrage them further.

Later it would be discovered that the common link between the youths was that they dreamed of Freddy Krueger. Since suicide was a taboo social issue, the storyline was abandoned.

Nancy was not a dream expert nor any kind of mental health professional. Kristen (named Kirsten in this script) only stayed in the institution for a short while, she had a father and her mother was named Alice. Neil's last name was Guinness and his character was much younger. Dr. Simms' last name was Maddalena, Taryn was African-American, Joey was the one who built the model of a house and had trouble getting around (although he did not use a wheelchair), and Philip was a thirteen-year-old. Will's name was originally Laredo, he had long hair, did not use a wheelchair, and was the one who made the clay puppets. This script also described the ranch house where Krueger was born and that is the house that shows up in the kids' dreams rather than the Elm Street house.<ref name=\"dworiginal\">{{Cite web|url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Files/nightmare-on-elm-street-3-wes-craven-script.pdf|last1=Craven | first1=Wes | author1-link=Wes Craven | last2=Wagner | first2=Bruce | author2-link=Bruce Wagner | title=A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (original script)|date=June 16, 1986|via=Nightmare on Elm Street Companion|access-date=May 18, 2019}}</ref>  Wes Craven specifies the house in his original script to be \"an architectural portal to [Freddy's dreamscape].

Krueger was missing and Nancy wanted to find him. When she finds him, Nancy learns that Krueger is obsessed with finding the house where he was born so he could burn it down. In the original script, there is a romance between Nancy and Neil and they have sex. There are scenes and lines that are reminiscent of the first film. There is no mention that Krueger's mother had been a nun or that Freddy was born of rape. Both Joey and Kincaid are killed. The deaths in this script were more grotesque; Krueger was not as talkative and he was more vulgar. Freddy is killed by Nancy by using his own glove, not by holy water, and she sees through his shapeshifting trick even though she still dies.<ref name=\"dworiginal\" />\n\nOn  ''[[Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy]]'', director Chuck Russell states that Craven's original script was darker and more profane, while [[Rachel Talalay]] thought that the script seemed like a \"20 million dollar script\".<ref name=\"neversleepagain\" /> Discussing the more humorous elements in the film, Russell stated, \"I looked at what [series creator] Wes Craven did and said, 'This is absolutely great and terrifying.' But I felt that by the time I came along on ''3'', the way to go was to make the whole idea of dreams and nightmares into a carnival and go further into the dreams and make Freddy Krueger more outrageous and add more of an element of dark humor.
