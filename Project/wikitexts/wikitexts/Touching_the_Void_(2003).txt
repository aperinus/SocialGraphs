The plot concerns [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]] and [[Simon Yates (mountaineer)|Simon Yates]]' near-fatal descent after making the first successful [[mountaineering|ascent]] of the West Face of [[Siula Grande]] in the [[Cordillera Huayhuash]] in the [[Peru]]vian [[Andes]], in 1985. It is based on Simpson's 1988 [[Touching the Void (book)|book of the same name]].\n\nCritically acclaimed, ''Touching the Void'' was listed in [[PBS]]'s \"100 Greatest Documentaries of All Time\". ''[[The Guardian]]'' described it as \"the most successful documentary in British cinema history\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/30/touching-the-void-best-british |title=Touching the Void &#124; Film  |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1985, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, both experienced mountaineers, successfully ascended the previously unclimbed West Face of [[Siula Grande]] in Peru. After leaving the summit their descent by way of the North Ridge proves unexpectedly difficult in, at times, stormy weather conditions. Shortly after the pair leave the summit Yates falls through a cornice and plummets down the 4500&nbsp;ft face they had just climbed but his fall is arrested by their climbing ropes. After a [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac]] high on the peak, the pair continue their descent the following morning but then Simpson falls whilst climbing down an ice cliff on the ridge and, landing awkwardly, suffers a badly broken leg. The pair commence a self-rescue with Yates lowering Simpson with ropes down a steep, 3000&nbsp;ft, snow and ice slope while the weather deteriorates into a fierce storm. The total length of rope the pair have is 300&nbsp;ft so the lowering process has to be undertaken in a series of repeat manoeuvres. The pair had almost reached the relative safety of the glacier when Yates inadvertently lowers Simpson over the edge of a large cliff, leaving him suspended on the rope in mid-air. Yates arrests his partner's fall, but cannot see the predicament he is in, nor hear him over the howling wind.\n\nUnable to pull Simpson back up the cliff and gradually losing traction in the loose snow, Yates realizes, after about an hour and a half, that he is gradually being pulled from his un[[belay]]ed stance and will eventually fall in excess of 150 feet to his almost certain death. Yates decides that the only option available to him to avoid being pulled from the cliff is to cut the rope connecting him with Simpson. After surviving a sub-zero and stormy night on the mountain Yates completed his descent to the surface of the glacier but cannot find his partner concluding that Simpson must have fallen to the large crevasse at the base of the cliff. He inspects the opening of the crevasse to the extent that he can without falling in himself and calls out to try and communicate with Simpson. Receiving no response Yates concludes Simpson must be dead and he returns to the base camp alone, where he stays to recuperate from his ordeal.\n\nSimpson, however, survived the fall and is now trapped in the large [[crevasse]]. He manages to lower himself further into the dark abyss and finds an exit leading to the surface of the glacier. He then spends three days crawling and hopping back to base camp across the glacier and [[moraines]], despite his broken leg, frostbite, and severe dehydration. Exhausted and delirious, Simpson reaches camp only a few hours before Yates and Richard Hawking (a non-climber who was the third member of the expedition) intend to leave and return to civilization.\n\nThe main docudrama ends when Simpson reaches base camp to find Yates and Hawking still in residence and his safety is then assured. The DVD contains two additional documentary features.  ''What Happened Next'' documents what happened after Simpson reached base camp and how he was evacuated to hospital in [[Lima]] by his two companions and his subsequent return to England.  ''Return to Siula Grande'' documents the making of the film in 2002 and the thoughts and reactions of Simpson, Yates and Hawking when they return to the scene of their epic adventure.\n\n==Production==\nThe film stars [[Brendan Mackey]] as Joe Simpson, [[Nicholas Aaron]] as Simon Yates, and [[Ollie Ryall]] as Richard Hawking, and combines dramatizations together with interviews with Simpson, Yates, and Hawking. Simpson and Yates doubled as their younger selves for long-distance shots of the snow-fluted [[couloir]]s of Siula Grande.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1909886/making-cut|title=Making the Cut|last=Wieners|first=Brad|website=Outside Online|access-date=2016-04-23}}</ref> The film was directed by [[Kevin Macdonald (director)|Kevin Macdonald]].\n\nWhen they collaborated on the making of the film in 2002, Simpson and Yates had hardly seen one another for 10 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/8824399/Joe-Simpson-interview-Im-not-an-easy-person-to-be-with.html|title=Joe Simpson interview: 'I'm not an easy person to be with'|date=15 October 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref><ref>Simon Yates interviewed in 2002 as part of the documentary ''The Return to Siula Grande'' which was supplied as an extra feature on the DVD of the film ''Touching the Void'', 2003</ref>\n\n==Response==\nDuring the making of the film, the director and producers invited Yates and Simpson to return to Siula Grande in 2002 for the first time since the events of 1985. Simpson, despite finding the return emotionally difficult and experiencing [[post-traumatic stress syndrome]] on his return, eventually said that he was happy with the film and its portrayal of the events. Yates, on the other hand, reported having no unresolved issues relating to his and Simpson's adventure in 1985 nor to returning to Siula Grande to make the film. Yates decided to have nothing further to do with the production of the film once he had returned to England.<ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite video|title = Touching the Void Region 1 Special Features|medium = DVD|publisher = MGM|date = 2004}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the film's end notes, Yates received criticism from some members of the mountaineering community in Britain for cutting the rope on his partner during the descent. According to interviews with Yates however, the climbing community (including Simpson) has largely always sided with him on that matter, and he accused the film of being selectively edited and one-sided.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.9news.com.au/9stories/touching-the-void-climber-says-director-burned-him-with-onesided-story/e985ec90-1d56-41ed-a7ad-fdb3cd76ace1|title='Touching the Void' climber says director burned him with one-sided story|publisher=9News|date=14 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Saunokonoko|access-date=1 September 2020}}</ref> Simpson has stated that his initial motivation in commencing the writing of the book was to set out the facts of the adventure in response to what he saw as unfair criticism of Yates.\n\nThe film received largely positive reviews, with 94% of critics' reviews being positive on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].\n\n===Awards===\n''Touching the Void'' won [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film]] at the [[57th British Academy Film Awards]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3491989.stm  \"No Disaster for 'Touching the Void '.\" BBC News. 16 February 2004.] Accessed 2014-01-16.</ref>\n\nPeter Knegt at ''Indiewire'' called it one of the \"10 incredible documentaries that weren't nominated for an Oscar\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/for-your-consideration-10-incredible-documentaries-that-werent-nominated-for-an-oscar | last=Knegt | first=Peter | title=10 Incredible Documentaries That Weren't Nominated for an Oscar | publisher=Indiewire.com | date=21 November 2011 | access-date=2014-01-16}}</ref>\n\nThe BBC1's Film 2011 included Brendan Mackey's performance as Joe Simpson in their \"Top Five Actors\" who \"Should Have Won an Oscar\", along with [[Ingrid Bergman]] (for ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''), [[Anthony Perkins]] (for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''), [[Ralph Fiennes]] (for ''[[Schindler's List]]'') and [[Jeff Bridges]] (for ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x7l47|title=BBC One \u2013 Film 2011 with Claudia Winkleman|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nThe film was released in theaters on 23 January 2004 and grossed $96,973 in the opening weekend.
