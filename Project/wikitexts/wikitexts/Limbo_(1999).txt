The drama features [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[David Strathairn]], Vanessa Martinez and [[Kris Kristofferson]].<ref>{{AFI film|id=61213|title=Limbo}}.</ref> It is the first theatrical film to be released and distributed by [[Screen Gems]].\n\n==Plot==\nPort Henry, Alaska, is a town undergoing stress as the local economy switches from an industrial one based on the canning and paper industries towards a tourism-based model. Joe Gastineau is a former high school basketball star and fisherman who quit fishing after some undisclosed tragedy. He now works as a handyman, particularly for Frannie and Lou, a lesbian couple who own the local resort hotel. Joe is friends with teenager Noelle De Angelo who also works for Frankie and Lou. At an event which they are working, Noelle's mother Donna, a lounge singer, breaks up with her live in boyfriend and asks Joe for help in moving. The two become close and eventually begin a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Joe gets the chance to return to fishing when Frankie and Lou ask him to work a fishing boat which they have acquired as collateral from local fisherman Harmon. Donna has a strained relationship with her daughter Noelle, due mainly to Noelle's disapproval of her mother's lifestyle. This is exacerbated when Donna begins dating Joe, who Noelle had a crush on. Donna overhears the story of why Joe quit fishing: he had been involved in a deadly sinking which claimed the lives of all of his boatmates, including the brother of local bush pilot and small-time criminal \"Smilin Jack\" Johannson.\n\nWhen Joe's dissolute half-brother Bobby shows up, he asks Joe to help crew his boat to pick up a client. Joe brings along Donna and Noelle. They dock for the night in an isolated bay and Bobby reveals the truth: he is involved in marijuana smuggling and had dumped a load overboard when he was spooked by the police. Now they are going to meet Bobby's partners to settle his debt. That night, men sneak onto the boat and kill Bobby. Joe, Donna, and Noelle flee to a nearby island where the men begin to hunt them. They take shelter in an abandoned cabin and try to survive. As they do they grow closer and Noelle finds a diary written by a teenage girl who had lived in the cabin with her family. She spends the nights reading segments of the diary to Joe and Donna. Eventually Donna looks at the diary and discovers that it is blank after the portion her daughter Noelle had read during the first two evenings. Noelle had made up most of its contents, expressing her own feelings. They maintain a signal fire and scrape some food from the seashore.\n\nAfter a week and a half a seaplane piloted by Smilin' Jack Johannson lands. He says that he is looking for supplies, his radio is busted, and that he doesn't have enough fuel to fly them out. He tells Joe that he was hired by a couple of men to look for three people roughing it. When told of Bobby's murder, he expresses sympathy and promises to return the next day and rescue them. Joe, who does not trust Jack, sees the radio was removed, and remains unsure of whether the seaplane return will bring rescue or the men who killed his brother. A stressful few days of rain prevent any flights' return. One morning Joe, Donna, and Noelle gather on the beach as a seaplane flies towards them, larger than the one belonging to Jack.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as Donna De Angelo\n* [[David Strathairn]] as \"Jumpin Joe\" Gastineau\n* Vanessa Martinez as Noelle De Angelo\n* Herm\u00ednio Ramos as Ricky\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as \"Smilin Jack\" Johannson\n* Dawn McInturff as Audrey\n* [[Casey Siemaszko]] as Bobby Gastineau\n* [[Kathryn Grody]] as Frankie\n* Tom Biss as Baines\n* [[Rita Taggart]] as Lou\n* [[Leo Burmester]] as Harmon King\n* Michael Laskin as Albright\n* Jimmy MacDonell as Randy Mason\n* M\u00e9rit Carlson-van Dort as Stacy\n* Monica Brandner as Corky\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Limbo'' received generally positive reviews from critics. [[Roger Ebert]] lauded the film and its story structure, writing, \"What I liked so much about this story structure is that it confounded my expectations at every step. I expected the story to stay in Juneau, but it didn't. When it took a turn toward adventure, I thought the threat would come from nature\u2014but it comes from men. After the three characters are stranded, I expected\u2014I don't know what, maybe ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]''-style improvisation. But Sayles gradually reveals his buried theme, which is that in a place like the Alaskan wilderness you can never be sure what will happen next. And that optimism, bravery and ingenuity may not be enough.\"<ref>{{cite web | last=Ebert | first=Roger | title=Limbo | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/limbo-1999 | work=RogerEbert.com | publisher=Ebert Digital LLC | date=June 4, 1999 | accessdate=May 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Null]] lambasted the ending, writing, \"I can forgive many things. But using some hackneyed, whacked-out, screwed-up '''non'''-ending on a movie is unforgivable. I walked a half-mile in the rain and sat through two hours of typical, plodding Sayles melodrama to get cheated by a complete and total copout finale.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Null |first=Christopher |year=n.d. |title=Limbo |url=http://movies.amctv.com/movie/1999/Limbo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314091721/http://www.amc.com/movie/1999/Limbo |archive-date=March 14, 2016 |accessdate=August 4, 2013 |website=AMC |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]}}</ref>\n\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that the film has a 72% fresh rating, based on thirty-nine reviews.<ref>{{rottentomatoes|id=limbo_1999|title=Limbo}}.</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n'''Wins'''\n* [[Seattle International Film Festival]]: Golden Space Needle Award; Best Director, John Sayles; 1999.\n* [[National Board of Review]]: Special Recognition, for excellence in filmmaking; 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1999 Archives |url=https://nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/1999/ |access-date=2022-11-01 |website=National Board of Review |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n'''Nominations'''\n* [[1999 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]: [[Palme d'Or]], John Sayles; 1999.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5333/year/1999.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Limbo|accessdate=August 4, 2013|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n* [[Independent Spirit Awards]]: Independent Spirit Award; Best Male Lead, David Strathairn, Best Supporting Female, Vanessa Martinez; 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |title=36 Years of Nominees and Winners |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/SA_SubForm_etc/2021_SA_ALLNomineesWinners_063021.pdf |access-date=November 1, 2022 |website=Film Independent Spirit Awards}}</ref>\n* Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards: Sierra Award; Best Actress, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio; 2000.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nMary Elizabeth Mastrantonio performed four of the nine songs on the soundtrack, which also features \"Lift Me Up\", an original song by [[Bruce Springsteen]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Limbo Soundtrack (1999) |url=https://www.soundtrack.net/album/limbo-1999/ |access-date=2022-11-01 |website=www.soundtrack.net}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AFI film|id=61213|title=Limbo}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0164085|title=Limbo}}\n* {{Allmovie title|id=179999|title=Limbo}}\n* [http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/limbo-script-transcript-john-sayles.html ''Limbo''] screenplay at Script-O-Rama\n* [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/film/movie/contents/limbo.pdf ''Limbo''] analysis at [[University of Warwick]], ''Movie: A Journal of Film Criticism'', Issue 1, 2010, \"Limbo: Frustrated Narration\", by Deborah Thomas\n* {{YouTube|uwJEOAi9G1M|''Limbo'' film trailer}}\n\n{{John Sayles}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 drama films]]\n[[Category:American adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Sayles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Alaska]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:1999 independent films]]\n[[Category:Screen Gems films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Sayles]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mason Daring]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
