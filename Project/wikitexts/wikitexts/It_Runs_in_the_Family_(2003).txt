[[Diana Douglas]] ({{n\u00e9e}} Dill), real-life mother to Michael Douglas and ex-wife of Kirk, plays Kirk's character's wife. [[Joel Douglas]], second son of Kirk and Diana, was the associate producer.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story involves the highly successful New York City Gromberg family. Each member has their own set of problems. The father-son relationship difficulties are highlighted. Mitchell Gromberg is dealing with health problems resulting from a stroke. His son Alex works as a lawyer in the firm that his father founded, but he questions the usefulness of his work and his place in the family. Alex's son, Asher, does not take college seriously and seems lost. The youngest son is 11 year old Eli, who is extremely intelligent, while being socially awkward and is entering a difficult pre-adolescent time.\n\nAlex indulges in a thoughtless and careless brief romantic fling with Suzie at the soup kitchen where they volunteer. Psychologist wife Rebecca discovers panties and it threatens their marriage. When Evelyn Gromberg, Mitchell's wife and Alex's mother dies, the family comes together to heal. At Evelyn's funeral in suburban New York, Rebecca tells Alex that she knows about his romantic fling. Alex, Mitchell and Asher go fishing to talk about old wounds but nothing gets resolved.\n\nAt college Asher is discovered with illegal drugs. Although devastated, Rebecca and Alex are supportive parents and vow to get help for Asher. He wants his girlfriend Peg protected. Mitchell's older brother Stephen dies. Alex and Mitchell give him a fine send-off and farewell. Back at home Alex is forced to sleep on the living room couch but Rebecca agrees to reconciliation terms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Michael Douglas]] as Alex Gromberg\n*[[Kirk Douglas]] as Mitchell Gromberg\n*[[Rory Culkin]] as Eli Gromberg\n*[[Cameron Douglas]] as Asher Gromberg\n*[[Diana Douglas|Diana Dill]] aka Diana Douglas as Evelyn Gromberg\n*[[Bernadette Peters]] as Rebecca Gromberg\n*[[Michelle Monaghan]] as Peg Maloney\n*[[Geoffrey Arend]] as Malik\n*[[Sarita Choudhury]] as Suzie\n*[[Irene Gorovaia]] as Abby Staley\n*[[Annie Golden]] as Deb\n*Mark Hammer as Stephen Gromberg\n*[[Audra McDonald]] as Sarah Langley\n*[[Josh Pais]] as Barney\n*[[Louie Torrellas]] as Jeremy\n*[[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Mitchell's Doorman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn his role as producer, Michael Douglas suggested his mother (Diana Dill), Rory Culkin, and Bernadette Peters for their roles.
