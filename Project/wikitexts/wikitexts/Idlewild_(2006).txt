The film stars [[Andr\u00e9 3000]] and [[Big Boi]] of the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo [[Outkast]], and the film features musical numbers that were written, produced and chiefly performed by the group. ''Idlewild'' contrasts the group's [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[Funk music|funk]], and [[Soul music|soul]] sound against a story based on a [[juke joint]] in the fictional [[Great Depression in the United States|Depression]]-era town of Idlewild, Georgia in 1935.\n\nDistributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], the film is an [[HBO Films]] co-production alongside [[Mosaic Media Group]] and Forensic Films. It features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Terrence Howard]], [[Paula Jai Parker]], [[Paula Patton]], [[Cicely Tyson]], [[Ben Vereen]], [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Ving Rhames]], [[Macy Gray]], [[Faizon Love]], [[Bruce Bruce]], [[Malinda Williams]], [[Jackie Long]] and [[Bill Nunn]]. ''Idlewild'' received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $12 million worldwide. It was nominated for six [[Black Reel Awards]].\n\n== Plot summary ==\n{{long plot|date=October 2015}}\nThe film follows Percival and Rooster, who have been close friends since childhood. In 1935, Percival works at his father Percy Senior's morgue during the day and plays piano at a local club called Church at night. Rooster becomes a singer at the club and a [[Rum-running|bootlegger]]; he also marries Zora, with whom he has five children.\n\nOn a night Rooster is performing, gangsters Spats, Trumpy, Ace, and Rose attend to talk about a deal they have with the club. Angel Davenport, a singer from St. Louis who has a contract with the club, arrives backstage. Angel is actually Sally B. Shelley, an aspiring singer who stole the contract from the real Davenport.\n\nRooster and Rose have sex in a car in a warehouse. When they hear people coming into the building, Rose jumps out of the car, gets dressed, and confronts Spats, Trumpy and Ace, who have just arrived. She then runs off, and Trumpy kills Spats and Ace to get the business for himself.\n\nRooster runs into Trumpy while taking his family shopping, and Trumpy explains that the debt owed by Ace is now Rooster's problem. He has to come up with this money by selling liquor at Church bought from Trumpy's \"suppliers.\" Rooster goes to Rose's house to warn her, but she is already packed up and ready to leave. Rose drives away in a taxi, being watched by one of Trumpy's henchmen.\n\nMeanwhile, Rooster begins to have more problems at the club and forces Angel to sing. After she has an attack of stage fright, Percival calms her and gives her a song that he wrote. The song is a hit, Angel becomes an overnight star, and she and Percival fall in love.\n\nRoosters's wife Zora grows tired of his cheating and moves with their children to her mother's house. Angel gets a record deal in Chicago and asks Percival to go with her, but he reluctantly declines, as he feels obligated to his father. When Angel finds out that Percival knows who she really is, she pledges her love to him and persuades him to go to Chicago.\n\nRooster devises a plan to buy liquor from bootlegger GW and his partner. One day, as Rooster is making his rounds to pick up [[Moonshine|hooch]] from GW, he sees a car on the road that seems to be stuck. He approaches the car and sees an old woman, Mother Hopkins, and her grandchildren. Rooster gives them all the money he has, and Mother Hopkins tells Rooster that he is an angel, giving him a bible before he leaves. Rooster walks into the abandoned house of the two bootleggers and sees that Trumpy's henchmen have beaten up GW and killed his partner.\n\nRooster is caught and brought to Trumpy, and GW is shot to death. During a fight between Rooster and Trumpy's henchmen, a shot at Rooster is blocked by the bible in his jacket. After Rooster escapes, Trumpy follows him to the club, where Angel and Percival have also decided to stop before going to Chicago. Rooster and Trumpy fight and, just as he is about to shoot Rooster, Percival shoots and kills Trumpy. Percival then notices that Angel has been shot and runs to her aid, though she dies shortly afterward.\n\nA grieving Percival prepares Angel for her burial, dressing her in a wedding gown and slipping a ring on her finger. Afterward, he attempts to commit suicide by hanging himself in his room, but is interrupted when Rooster rings the doorbell. Percival is consoled and gives Angel's Chicago bound-ticket to Rooster, who reunites with his wife and children. Percival then begins to make records and tour in clubs throughout America, to great success.\n\nThe film ends with pictures of Percival and Angel, hung next to a picture of Percival's mother in her coffin.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andr\u00e9 3000]] as Percival \"Percy\" Jenkins Jr.\n* [[Big Boi]] as \"Rooster\"\n**[[Bobb'e J.

The [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk music|funk]], and [[soul music|soul]] stylings of the song score are intentionally [[Anachronism|anachronistic]], a choice made to complement the film being set in 1935. Elements of 1930s-era [[blues]] and [[jazz music]] are however featured prominently in many of the musical numbers. The film's dance numbers, choreographed by [[Hinton Battle]], also feature many period dances, primarily the [[Lindy Hop]] and [[jitterbug]].\n\nMost of the songs in ''Idlewild'' had already been featured on the OutKast albums ''[[Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast]]'' and ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', essentially making it a [[jukebox musical]]. Seven of the songs from the film, along with several unreleased songs, were released by [[LaFace Records]] as an [[OutKast]] album entitled ''[[Idlewild (Outkast album)|Idlewild]]'' at the time of the film's release.\n\n===Musical numbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"20\"|#\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"200\"|Song title\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"200\"|Character(s)/<br />Performer(s)\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"200\"|Songwriters\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" width=\"200\"|Album\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|1\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"Greatest Show on Earth\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Taffy<br /> <small>([[Macy Gray]] featuring OutKast)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|[[Andr\u00e9 Benjamin]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''[[Idlewild (Outkast album)|Idlewild]]''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|2\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" |\"Makes No Sense at All\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Percival<br /> <small>(Andr\u00e9 3000)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Idlewild''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|3\n|align=\"left\"\" valign=\"top\"|\"Bowtie\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Rooster<br /> <small>([[Big Boi]] featuring [[Sleepy Brown]] and [[Jazze Pha]])</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Antwan Andre Patton, Patrick Brown, Phalon Alexander\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|4\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"Chronomentrophobia\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Percival<br /> <small>(Andr\u00e9 3000)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Idlewild''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|5\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"The Rooster\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Rooster<br /> <small>(Big Boi)</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Antwan Andre Patton, Carlton \"Carl Mo\" Mahone, Donnie Mathis\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''Speakerboxxx/The Love Below''\n|-\n|align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"|6\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|\"Movin' Cool (The After Party)\"\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Percival & Angel<br /> <small>(Andr\u00e9 3000 and Paula Patton, dubbed by [[Debra Killings]])</small>\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin, Antwan Andre Patton, [[Mr. DJ|David Sheats]], [[Joi (singer)|Joi Gilliam-Gipp]]\n|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|''[[Big Boi and Dre Present...
