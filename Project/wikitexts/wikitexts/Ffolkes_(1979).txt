It was directed by [[Andrew V. McLaglen]] and adapted by [[Jack Davies (screenwriter)|Jack Davies]] from his novel, ''Esther, Ruth and Jennifer''.<ref name=\"IMDB\"/>\n\nThis film was a vehicle for both Moore and Perkins to try to escape [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]]. Previously, Moore had been practically typecast as a [[Womanizing|womanising]], happy-go-lucky [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]] in such series as ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]], [[The Persuaders!]]'' and [[James Bond]]. In contrast to those parts, he portrays a bearded, eccentric, arrogant, cat-loving [[misogynist]] with master [[Military strategy|strategist]] skills.\n\n==Plot==\nEccentric and cat-loving [[counter-terrorism]] consultant Rufus Excalibur ffolkes is asked by [[Lloyd's of London]] to develop a contingency plan, should any of the [[North Sea oil]] installations it insures be threatened. Months later, a [[North Sea]] supply ship named ''Esther'' takes on board a group of men posing as reporters who are to visit the oil production platform ''Jennifer''. The leader of this group, Lou Kramer, hijacks the ship; the gangsters attach [[limpet mine]]s to the legs of ''Jennifer'' and its accompanying oil drilling rig, ''Ruth'', then issue a ransom demand for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]25&nbsp;million to the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]].<ref name=\"IMDB\"/> ''Esther'''s crew tries to fight back, but is thwarted by Kramer's vigilance, and two of their number end up dead.\n\nWhen the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] and her staff consult Lloyd's, where both platforms are insured, about providing the ransom, the CEO informs them about ffolkes, and after some initial hesitation he is hired to take out the terrorists and retake the platforms. ffolkes enacts his plan by traveling to ''Jennifer'' as the aide of Admiral Brindsen, who was tasked by the Prime Minister to supervise the operation. With ''Ruth'' out of ''Esther'''s sight, ffolkes first asks the [[British Admiralty|admiralty]] to prepare a fake explosion in order to distract Kramer from blowing up ''Ruth'' and to buy them more time, then arranges for having Brindsen and himself brought aboard the supply ship to take out the terrorist leaders from within while his men board from underwater. However, Kramer distrusts ffolkes and has him removed from ''Esther''.\n\nWith his original plan thus upset, ffolkes persuades the Prime Minister to have the ransom helicopter drop off a bomb on ''Esther'' in case his team fails to take out Kramer's gang in time. Then he approaches the ship from underwater, and despite some mishaps he manages to thwart the activation of the detonators, leaving Kramer for dead, and prevent the bomb drop on ''Esther''. Kramer, mortally wounded, makes one last attempt to blow up ''Jennifer'', but is stopped by ffolkes and dies. Following the successful conclusion of the mission, ffolkes is rewarded for his service with three kittens named after ''Esther'', ''Ruth'' and ''Jennifer''.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Roger Moore]] as Rufus Excalibur ffolkes{{efn|1=ffolkes is an old English name that is correctly spelled with two lower-case f's.
