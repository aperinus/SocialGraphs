It stars [[Geoffrey Rush]] as de Sade, [[Kate Winslet]] as laundress Madeleine \"Maddie\" LeClerc, [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Abb\u00e9 de Coulmier|Abb\u00e9 du Coulmier]], and [[Michael Caine]] as [[Antoine-Athanase Royer-Collard|Dr. Royer-Collard]].\n\nWell received by critics, ''Quills'' garnered numerous accolades for Rush, including nominations for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor#2000s|Oscar]], BAFTA and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]]. The film was a modest art house success, averaging $27,709 per screen its debut weekend, and eventually grossing $17,989,277 internationally. Cited by historians as factually inaccurate, ''Quills'' filmmakers and writers said they were not making a biography of de Sade, but exploring issues such as [[censorship]], [[pornography]], [[sex]], art, mental illness, and religion.<ref name=\"Interview1\">{{cite news | author=Lemons, Steven|title=A Conversation with Philip Kaufman|work=Salon.com|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/11/27/kaufman_4/ |date=2000-11-30|access-date=2016-02-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''Quills'' begins in Paris during the [[Reign of Terror]], with the incarcerated [[Marquis de Sade]] penning a story about the libidinous Mademoiselle Renard, a ravishing young aristocrat who meets the imprisoned sadist.\n\nSeveral years later, the Marquis is confined to the asylum for the insane at [[Charenton (asylum)|Charenton]], overseen by the enlightened [[Abb\u00e9 de Coulmier|Abb\u00e9 du Coulmier]]. The Marquis has been publishing his work through laundress Madeleine \"Maddy\" LeClerc, who smuggles manuscripts through an anonymous horseman to a publisher. The Marquis' latest work, ''[[The Misfortunes of Virtue|Justine]]'', is published on the black market to great success. Emperor [[Napoleon|Napol\u00e9on I Bonaparte]] orders all copies of the book to be torched and the author shot, but his advisor, Delben\u00e9, tempers this contentious idea with one of his own: send [[psychiatry|alienist]] Dr. [[Antoine-Athanase Royer-Collard|Royer-Collard]] to assess Charenton and silence the Marquis. Meanwhile, the Abb\u00e9 teaches Madeleine to read and write, while they resist their growing mutual attraction. Madeleine reads the Marquis de Sade's stories to her fellow workers. Whilst Madeleine is fascinated with the Marquis de Sade she remains reluctant to give in to his advances. The Abb\u00e9 and Marquis converse on the Marquis' inappropriate advances on young women.\n\nRoyer-Collard arrives, informing the Abb\u00e9 that the Marquis' \"therapeutic writings\" have been distributed for public consumption. He presents the Abb\u00e9 with the ultimatum of silencing the Marquis or Charenton will be shut down by order of the Emperor. The Abb\u00e9 rejects Royer-Collard's offers of several aggressive archaic \"treatments\" and asks to speak with the Marquis himself, who promptly swears obedience (winking at Madeleine through a peephole). Royer-Collard takes his leave for the time being and travels to the Panthemont Convent in Paris to retrieve his promised bride, the underage orphan Simone. They are given a run-down chateau by the Emperor, with a handsome young architect, Prioux, on hand for its renovation. On their wedding night, Royer-Collard violently rapes her, and afterward keeps her as a virtual prisoner in their home.\n\nThe hasty marriage incites much gossip at the asylum, prompting the Marquis to write a farce to be performed at a public exhibition, which Royer-Collard and Simone attend. The audacious play, a parody of the good doctor's own misogynist domination of his virginal bride, is titled \"''The Crimes of Love''\". The performance is interrupted when the inmate Bouchon molests Madeleine off-stage, prompting her to hit him in the face with an iron. The Abb\u00e9 is seen publicly comforting Madeleine. Royer-Collard shuts down the public theater and demands that the Abb\u00e9 do more to control the Marquis, or he will inform the ministry that the inmates are running the asylum. Infuriated, the Abb\u00e9 confiscates the Marquis' quills and ink. The Marquis's wife visits him and he takes out his frustration at not being able to write on her; she retaliates by asking a surprised Royer-Collard that the Marquis be entombed forever.\n\nThey discuss that the ill-gotten gains from the Marquis's books could be used to effect his salvation, in other words, provide forms of restraint. The lack of writing implements results in more subversive behaviour from the Marquis, including a story written in wine on bedsheets and in blood on clothing. This results in further deprivation, eventually leaving the Marquis naked in an empty cell. Charlotte, one of the maids, reveals that Madeleine has been helping the Marquis. Madeleine is whipped on the order of Royer-Collard until the Abb\u00e9 stops him by offering himself instead. The Abb\u00e9 decides that Madeleine must be sent away. That night she visits his chamber to beg him to reconsider sending her away and confesses her love for him in the process, prompting him to kiss her passionately. They abruptly break away at the realization of what they are doing. Madeleine runs off and Charlotte catches the Abb\u00e9 calling after her.\n\nMeanwhile, Simone purchases a copy of ''Justine'', seduces Prioux, and the young lovers run off to England together. She leaves behind a letter explaining her actions and her copy of ''Justine''. Upon finding this, Royer-Collard refocuses attention upon the Marquis as the source of his troubles and embarks upon a quest for revenge by having him tortured. About to be sent away from Charenton for her role in assisting the Marquis, Madeleine begs a last story from him, which is to be relayed to her through the asylum patients. Bouchon, the inmate at the end of the relay, is excited by the story, breaks out of his cell, and attacks Madeleine. Royer-Collard hears Madeleine's screams but chooses to ignore them and she is killed by Bouchon. The asylum is set afire by the [[pyromania]]c Dauphin and the inmates break out of their cells.\n\nMadeleine's body is found in the laundry vat by her blind mother and the Abb\u00e9. The Abb\u00e9 is devastated by Madeleine's death and Bouchon is captured and imprisoned inside an [[iron maiden]]. The Abb\u00e9 blames the Marquis for Madeleine's death and confronts him; the Marquis claims he had been with Madeleine in every way imaginable, only to be told she had died a virgin, provoking an uncharacteristically emotional outpouring of grief. The Abb\u00e9 has the Marquis' tongue cut out as punishment for Madeleine's death, but is stricken with remorse and [[self-flagellation|whips himself]]. The Abb\u00e9 then has a dream in which Madeleine returns to life and they have sex, but ultimately it ends with him holding her corpse. The Marquis' health declines severely, but he remains perverse as ever, decorating his dungeon with a story, using his feces as ink. As the Marquis lies dying, the Abb\u00e9 reads him the [[last rites]] and offers him a crucifix to kiss. The Marquis defiantly swallows the crucifix and chokes to death on it.\n\nA year later, the new Abb\u00e9 arrives at Charenton and is given the grand tour by Royer-Collard. During the tour, they meet the maid Charlotte, and through the exchange between herself and Royer-Collard, it is apparent that there is a connection. The asylum has been converted into a print shop, with the inmates as its staff. The books being printed are the works of the Marquis de Sade. At the end of the tour, the new Abb\u00e9 meets his predecessor, who resides in the Marquis' old cell. Yearning to write, he begs paper and a quill from the new Abb\u00e9, and tries to strangle Royer-Collard when he ventures too close the peephole. The Abb\u00e9 is herded off by Royer-Collard before he can hear any more from his predecessor. However, the peephole opens, and Madeleine's mother thrusts paper, quill, and ink through. The Abb\u00e9 begins to scribble furiously, with the Marquis providing the narration.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as the [[Marquis de Sade]]; Director [[Philip Kaufman]] encouraged Rush to portray the Marquis as something of a dissolute rock star holed up in the [[The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company|Ritz Carlton]].<ref name=\"Interview1\"/> Rush used [[Francine du Plessix Gray]]'s 1998 biography ''At Home with the Marquis de Sade: A Life'' as a reference and had previously acted in a production of ''[[Marat/Sade]]''.<ref name=\"Rush Interview\">{{cite news | author=Sragow, Michael|title=A demented peacock|work=Salon.com|url= http://www.salon.com/2000/11/30/rush_6/ |date=2000-11-30|access-date=2016-02-16 }}</ref>\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Madeleine \"Maddy\" LeClerc; Screenwriter [[Doug Wright]] called Winslet the \"patron saint\" of the movie for being the first big name to back it,<ref>{{cite news| author=Thomas, Rebecca| title=Quills Ruffling Feathers | publisher=BBC News Online|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1081669.stm| date=2000-12-28| access-date = 2007-03-27}}</ref> expressing interest as early as April 1999.<ref>{{cite news| author=Fleming, Michael| title=Winslet, Rush eye Quills | publisher=Variety|url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117493348.html?categoryid=13&cs=1| date=1999-04-16| access-date = 2007-03-27}}</ref>\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Abb\u00e9 de Coulmier|Abb\u00e9 du Coulmier]]; Before settling on Joaquin Phoenix, casting directors considered [[Jude Law]], [[Guy Pearce]], and [[Billy Crudup]] for the role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premieremag.com/Premiere/Article/New/0,2050,182_4494_1,00.html|title=News You're Not Supposed to Know (October): Phoenix Rising|access-date=2007-03-21|work=Premiere Magazine: Short Takes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001019040242/http://www.premieremag.com/Premiere/Article/New/0,2050,182_4494_1,00.html|archive-date=19 October 2000|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Caine]] as [[Antoine-Athanase Royer-Collard|Dr. Royer-Collard]]; Kaufman drew comparisons between Royer-Collard and [[Kenneth Starr]], particularly the publication of de Sade's works at the Charenton Printing Press and the release of Starr's report online.<ref name=\"Interview1\"/>\n* [[Billie Whitelaw]] as Madame LeClerc\n* [[Stephen Marcus]] as Bouchon\n* [[Amelia Warner]] as Simone\n* [[Stephen Moyer]] as Prioux\n* [[Jane Menelaus]] as Ren\u00e9e Pelagie\n* [[Ron Cook]] as [[Napoleon|Napol\u00e9on I Bonaparte]]\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Delben\u00e9\n* [[Elizabeth Berrington]] as Charlotte\n* [[Tony Pritchard]] as Valcour\n* Michael Jenn as Cleante\n* [[Edward Tudor-Pole]] as Franval\n\n==Production==\nThe interior set of the [[Charenton (asylum)]] in ''Quills'' was built at [[Pinewood Studios]], where most of the filming took place.

Schaeffer, whose ''The Marquis de Sade: A Life''<ref name=\"Timeline-overview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neilschaeffer.com/sade/timeline/index.htm |title=The Marquis de Sade: Timeline (1804\u20131814) |access-date=2007-04-03 |work=Neil Schaeffer's Life and Times of the Marquis de Sade |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426195257/http://www.neilschaeffer.com/sade/timeline/index.htm |archive-date=26 April 2007}}</ref> was used by Director Philip Kaufman as reference,<ref name=\"Interview1\"/> in a review published in ''[[The Guardian]]'', criticized the film for historical inaccuracies and for simplifying de Sade's complex life.<ref name=\"Schaeffer Article\">{{cite news | author=Schaeffer, Neil|title=Perverting de Sade|work=[[The Guardian]]|url= http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/biography/story/0,,421539,00.html |date=2001-01-13|access-date=2007-04-01 }}</ref>\n\nSchaeffer relates that de Sade's initial incarceration \"had nothing to do with his writing\" but with sexual scandals involving servants, prostitutes, and his sister-in-law. He also criticized the opening scene's implication that the reign of terror caused the \"sanguinary streak\" of de Sade's writing, when \"his bloodiest and best work, ''[[120 Days of Sodom]]'', was written in the Bastille \u2013 obviously before the revolution\" and not at Charenton, as suggested by the film. In contrast to the film, the historical de Sade was \"not at the height of his literary career nor of his literary powers\" while at Charenton, nor did he cut the \"tall, trim figure of the Australian actor Geoffrey Rush\" but was of middling height and, at the time, of a \"considerable, even a grotesque, obesity\".<ref name=\"Schaeffer Article\"/>\n\nThe manuscripts smuggled out of the asylum were not the novel [[The Misfortunes of Virtue|''Justine'']], which features prominently in the film but was published thirteen years before de Sade's incarceration at the asylum. De Sade's smuggled works were not particularly outrageous, mostly consisting of conventional novels and a number of plays he worked on throughout his life in hopes of having them performed. Most of these were soundly rejected by publishers. De Sade was, in fact, involved in the theater productions at Charenton, though none like the play featured in ''Quills.'' The plays performed were popular, conventional Parisian dramas.<ref>These productions were also the inspiration for the 1963 play and 1967 film [[Marat/Sade]]. {{cite web |url=http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=MARAT |title=MGM.com's Official Marat/Sade Synopsis|access-date=2007-04-10 |work=MGM Vault}}</ref> The government shut the Charenton theater down on 6 May 1813, years before the [[Antoine-Athanase Royer-Collard|real Dr. Royer-Collard]] had any influence at Charenton.<ref name=\"Schaeffer Article\"/><ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web |url= http://www.neilschaeffer.com/sade/timeline/1804-1814.htm |title=The Marquis de Sade: Timeline (1804\u20131814) |access-date=2007-04-03 |work=Neil Schaeffer's Life and Times of the Marquis de Sade}}</ref>\n\nSchaeffer criticized also the film's treatment of de Sade's personal relations regarding his wife (who had formally separated from him after the revolution), the chambermaid (who did not serve as a liaison to a publisher but with whom he had a sexual relationship from her early teens until shortly before his death), and his \"companion of many years\" who had a room at Charenton (and actually smuggled out the manuscripts) but is ignored by the film. Furthermore, \"De Sade's hideous death in the movie is nothing like the truth, for he died in his sleep, in his 74th year, as peacefully as any good Christian\".<ref name=\"Schaeffer Article\"/><ref name=\"Timeline\"/>\n\nAccording to Kaufman, Doug Wright did not have the rights to the original translations and therefore had to create and write the passages of de Sade's work that are included in the original play and the film. He applied the vocabulary used in the translations to the passages to imitate de Sade's style but the archaic language comes across as funny to a modern viewer whereas in the 1700s, as stated by Kaufman, these words were \"incendiary\".<ref name=\"Interview1\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite book|last=Sanello|first=Frank|year=2002|title=Reel V.
