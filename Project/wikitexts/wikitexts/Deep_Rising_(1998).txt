Meanwhile, the ''Argonautica'', a luxury [[cruise ship]] built and owned by Simon Canton, is undertaking its maiden voyage when a saboteur disables the ship's navigation and communication systems. A large object rises from beneath and rams the vessel, leaving it dead in the water, and the panicking passengers are attacked and slaughtered by unseen creatures.\n\nFinnegan's boat collides with a [[speedboat]] shaken loose during the collision, at which point the mercenaries take over and reveal they intend to rob the ''Argonautica'''s passengers and vault, before sinking the ship with [[torpedo]]es stowed aboard the boat. The group boards the ship, leaving Leila and Billy behind to repair the boat, where they are both killed by the creatures. The group reaches the ballroom only to find blood and no sign of the passengers. Finnegan and Joey go to the ship's workshop to scavenge parts to repair the boat. Meanwhile, T-Ray goes off to investigate strange noises and is torn to shreds by the creature. Mamooli contacts Hanover, but is dragged off by the creature; as Joey and Finnegan flee, they run into Trillian, a passenger who was imprisoned for stealing. Meanwhile, Hanover's group reaches the vault and Vivo opens it, only to be mistakenly killed by Canton, who was hiding inside the vault along with Captain Atherton and three other passengers. Mason and Mulligan panic and accidentally kill the passengers.\n\nCanton and Atherton explain to the mercenaries that the ship has been attacked by unknown creatures that killed everyone else on board. Under questioning, Canton is found to be the saboteur, having hired the mercenaries to sink the unprofitable ship so that he could [[insurance fraud|collect on the insurance]]. The group is attacked by creatures resembling giant spike-covered tentacles, which eat Atherton. Canton theorizes that the creatures are an extreme evolution of the [[Ottoia]], which drain their victims of their bodily fluids and then eject the carcasses. The survivors flee, but Mason is grabbed and kills himself by detonating a grenade. Mulligan elects to stay behind in the crew's galley until a rescue party can arrive. While arguing with the others, a creature slips in through the range hood; Mulligan scares it off but is ambushed and devoured by another.\n\nIn a running battle, the survivors find themselves being herded towards the bow of the ship, where they find a \"feeding ground\" full of bloody [[skeletal remains]]. Attempting to rid himself of any witnesses to his insurance scam, Canton misleads the others to the bow while he moves towards an exit route. The creatures break through the hull, flooding the lower decks and separating the survivors. Hanover wounds Joey in an attempt to slow the creatures, but Joey escapes. Joey later finds Hanover being devoured by one of the creatures. As an act of mercy, he leaves Hanover a gun, but Hanover wastes his only shot trying to kill Joey and is consumed.\n\nFinnegan and Trillian spot an island and return to Finnegan's boat, but \u2014 having lost the engine parts \u2014 find it useless as a means of escape. Joey returns and begins improvised repairs, and Finnegan sets the boat's [[autopilot]] to crash into the ''Argonautica'' and detonate the torpedoes. Trillian returns to the cruise ship and locates a [[jet ski]] with the fuel they can use to reach the island, but Canton arrives armed with a flare gun. Canton asks Trillian to join him or hand over the keys, but she flees and he chases her. Finnegan pursues Canton to the ballroom on the main deck, saving Trillian. The creatures smash through the main deck and are revealed to be tentacles of a vast deep-sea monster \u2014 the Octalus{{citation needed|reason=Where is this stated?|date=February 2022}} \u2014 rather than individual entities. The Octalus grabs hold of Finnegan, who shoots it in the eye, blinding it and freeing himself, and he and Trillian escape on a jet ski. Canton flees the ''Argonautica'' by jumping onto Finnegan's boat, but he breaks his leg doing so. Crippled, he is unable to disable the autopilot and dies as the boat crashes into the ''Argonautica'', detonating the missiles and destroying both ships and the Octalus.\n\nFinnegan and Trillian reach the island, where they find and reunite with Joey, whom they thought had died. As the three are catching their breath, a loud roar echoes from the forest; the camera pulls back, revealing the island to have an active volcano in the distance and something huge crashing through the trees towards the beach. Finnegan is then heard asking \"Now what?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Treat Williams]] as John Finnegan\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Trillian St. James\n* [[Anthony Heald]] as Simon Canton\n* [[Kevin J.
