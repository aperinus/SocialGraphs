It is a variation on the [[Cinderella]] formula, where the [[fairy godmother]] is not the means to a better life for the [[heroine]], but rather the [[archenemy|nemesis]]. Rather than doing so out of malice, though, the fairy godmother hopes to teach the heroine that life has more of importance than financial security.\n\n==Plot==\nJessica \"Jessie\" Montgomery ([[Ally Sheedy]]) is a bratty, hard-partying rich girl in her mid-20s. Jessie's self-indulgent lifestyle (along with a lack of respect for anything or anybody, even herself) has been wearing thin on her father Charles ([[Tom Skerritt]]), a widowed [[philanthropist]]. When Jessie's boyfriend Brent ([[Jason Beghe]]) breaks up with her, out of frustration with her immaturity and utter lack of values, she could not care less. Then, Jessie is arrested for drug possession and [[DWI]] with a suspended license (she also attempts to bribe her arresting officers). Charles blames himself for his daughter's downward spiral: Jessie's mother died only a few years after the girl was born; instead of laying down the law, he spoiled Jessie rotten...often leaving her in the care of his valet Woodrow ([[Theodore Wilson]]) and other family retainers. Now, hearing that his daughter has been busted and her car impounded, he wishes aloud (ostensibly to Woodrow, but also to himself) that he had never had a daughter. Outside, a star falls. Jessie's identity is magically erased, leaving her fully clothed, but with no resources or possessions, and no family or friends.\n\nEnter Stella Winston ([[Beverly D'Angelo]]), a fairy godmother who has been \"assigned\" to the Montgomery family. Stella pays Jessie's bail and explains what has happened as a result of Charles' wish. Being Jessie, she does not believe a word Stella says. When she walks to her father's mansion, neither he nor any of the servants recognize her; neither does Jimmy, the family dog. When Jessie breaks into the mansion, she is promptly chased out and has to flee when the cops show up.\n\nWandering the streets, Jessie trips over some girls with whom she recently partied. They insist they have never seen Jessie before in their lives, and shove her away. She once again encounters Stella...who spells out all of Jessie's faults and suggests the girl find a job to provide for herself. Having never worked a day in her life (she [[dropping out|dropped out]] of junior college after \"six years\"), Jessie nonetheless succeeds in finding employment as a live-in [[maid]] for an eccentric Malibu family: Stan Starkey ([[Dick Shawn]]), his wife Georgette ([[Valerie Perrine]]), and their daughter Brie ([[Rain Phoenix]]). A few years ago, the Starkeys won several million dollars in the [[lottery]]; they now aspire to break into the [[music industry]] as [[talent agent]]s.\n\nGradually, Jessie bonds with the Starkeys' other retainers: cook Audrey ([[Merry Clayton]]), a failed singer; fellow maid Maria (Bego\u00f1a Plaza); and chauffeur Nick ([[Michael Ontkean]]), an aspiring songwriter. Jessie learns the true meaning of friendship, hard work, and self-respect...while falling in love with Nick. When she helps Nick and Audrey break into the music business, Jessie's old life is returned to her; her dad and everyone else recognize her again. However, being a better and more mature person, Jessie continues her relationship with Nick; the ending implies that they ultimately get married.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ally Sheedy]] \u2013 Jessie Montgomery\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] \u2013 Stella Winston\n* [[Michael Ontkean]] \u2013 Nick McGuire\n* [[Valerie Perrine]] \u2013 Georgette Starkey\n* [[Dick Shawn]] \u2013 Stan Starkey\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] \u2013 Charles Montgomery\n* [[Merry Clayton]] \u2013 Audrey James\n* Bego\u00f1a Plaza \u2013 Maria\n* [[Rain Phoenix]] \u2013 Brie Starkey (as Rainbow Phoenix)\n* [[Theodore Wilson]] - Woodrow\n* [[Jason Beghe]] - Brent\n* [[Katey Sagal]] - Louise\n* [[Victoria Catlin]] - Alicia Nolin\n* [[Khandi Alexander]] - Hooker in Jail\n* [[Henry Woolf]] - Jailer\n*[[Robert Jaffe (producer)|Robert Jaffe]] - Miles\n* George Chala Sr - Gas Station owner (Uncredited)\n\n==Reception==\nReviews were negative.
