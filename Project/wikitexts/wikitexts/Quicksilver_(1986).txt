The film, which was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], also stars [[Jami Gertz]], [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]], [[Louie Anderson]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], and [[Rudy Ramos]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=May 2015}}\nJack Casey ([[Kevin Bacon]]) is a young [[floor trader]] on the [[Pacific Exchange]] who loses all of his company's and family's savings on a risky trade. Deflated and disenchanted with his profession, he quits his job and becomes a [[bicycle messenger]]. Casey has to deal with his parents and his girlfriend, who are disappointed with his new job. Along with the colorful characters that work with him, he saves a troubled young woman named Terri ([[Jami Gertz]]) from a gang.\n\nAlthough frustrated, Casey enjoys the freedom that comes with his lower responsibility. He also uses his education and business acumen to help his co-workers. When some of them are involved in dangerous or difficult matters, Casey must decide whether he should become involved. Those matters lead to a sinister web of murder and intrigue.\n\nIn the final section of the film, Casey returns to the floor of the exchange for a day, buying shares of a plummeting penny stock and holding on until it recovers. He thus restores his family's fortune and enables his bike-messenger friend, Hector (Paul Rodriguez), to afford the hot dog stand he has dreamed of. Terri is again menaced by drug dealer Gypsy but is rescued by Casey's fellow bike messengers. In retaliation against Gypsy, Casey engages in an extended car-versus-bike confrontation that ends with Gypsy driving off the end of an uncompleted highway. The film flashes forward to Casey applying for 'normal' jobs and Terri deciding to become a paramedic, and the pair buying hot dogs from Hector.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Jack Casey\n* [[Jami Gertz]] as Terri\n* [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]] as Hector Rodriguez\n* [[Rudy Ramos]] as 'Gypsy'\n* Andrew Smith as Gabe Kaplan\n* [[Gerald S.
