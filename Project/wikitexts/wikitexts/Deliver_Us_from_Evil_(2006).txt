After being convicted of child molestation in 1993 and serving seven years in prison, he was [[Deportation|deported]] to his native [[Ireland]], where Berg interviewed him in 2005. Additionally, the film presents trial documents, videotaped [[Deposition (law)|deposition]]s with O'Grady and other members of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Los Angeles Archdiocese]] (including Monsignor Cain and [[Roger Mahony]]), and interviews with survivors of O'Grady's abuse, activists, [[theologians]], [[psychologists]], and lawyers. Taken together, the material suggests that Church officials were aware of O'Grady's crimes many years before his conviction, but took steps to conceal them to protect him and the Church.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/09/AR2006110900530.html | first=Desson|last=Thomson | author-link=Desson Thomson | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | title=An Unassuming Face of 'Evil' | date=November 10, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/10/27/DDGBALVTPI1.DTL&type=movies | first=Ruthe|last=Stein | title=The bitter wake of a pedophile protected by the church | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=October 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was well-received by critics.

A profoundly disturbing chronicle of a wolf in sheep's clothing, the film builds a clear-eyed case against [[pedophile]] priest Oliver O'Grady, and the Catholic bureaucracy that protected him.
