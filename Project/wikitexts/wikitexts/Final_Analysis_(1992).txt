Diana suggests Isaac meet her sister, Heather Evans, who may be able to shed light on her neuroses. Heather tells him that Diana was [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by their father after their mother left. She reveals to him that she is unhappily married to gangster Jimmy Evans. Isaac confesses that he finds her irresistible, and the two have sex. Afterwards, Heather divulges that their father died in a fire, which Diana was suspected of starting.\n\nAt a restaurant with Jimmy, Heather has an episode of \"[[Episodic dyscontrol syndrome|pathological intoxication]]\" after drinking wine and is taken to the hospital. After recovering, she sneaks away with Isaac to an abandoned lighthouse. While climbing the stairs, she drops her purse and lets loose a metal dumbbell handle, which she claims she keeps for protection.\n\nIsaac's friend, defense attorney Mike O'Brien, informs him that Jimmy is under federal investigation for several financial crimes, and warns him to stay away from Heather. Isaac nevertheless follows her and Jimmy to a restaurant and confronts Jimmy. Claiming she feels ill, Heather leaves the restaurant, and gets a ride home from Isaac. Later that night, she drinks cough medicine, which brings on another episode. As Jimmy forces a kiss on her, she grabs one of his metal dumbbells and hits him over the head, killing him.\n\nHeather is arrested for murdering Jimmy. Isaac hires Mike to represent her, and enlists expert on pathological intoxication to testify on her behalf. Heather is found [[not guilty by reason of insanity]]. She is sentenced to confinement at to a psychiatric facility, where she will be evaluated. Isaac assures Heather she will be released soon.\n\nIsaac listens to a colleague's speech on one of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s patients who had persistent dreams of arranging flowers, the same dream Diana had described to him during a session; Isaac realizes that Diana fabricated those stories. He talks to a courthouse guard who recognized Heather before her trial, and he recalls that she had been a spectator in the courthouse whenever Isaac testified as an expert witness. Mike tells Isaac that Jimmy's brother recently died, making Heather the beneficiary of Jimmy's $4 million [[life insurance]] policy. Isaac goes to the hospital to confront Heather, who admits to the ruse and threatens to incriminate him with the dumbbell she used to murder Jimmy, which has Isaac's fingerprints on it. Police detective Huggins, who suspects Isaac of killing Jimmy, warns him that he is being watched. Isaac tells Heather that he has reported her crime to two assistant district attorneys who want to interview her. She agrees, confident that [[double jeopardy]] will protect her.\n\nDuring the evaluation, Heather fabricates a story about Isaac killing Jimmy. At Heather\u2019s request, Diana joins her, but fails to bring the dumbbell; the investigators, meanwhile, are revealed to be psychiatrists. Heather loses her temper and threatens both Isaac and Diana, and has to be sedated. Isaac meets with Diana, who assures him that she dropped the dumbbell into the bay, but Isaac does not trust her. Isaac enlists Pepe Carrero, a former client, to follow Diana when she visits her sister.\n\nAlthough Heather wants Diana to deliver the dumbbell to Huggins, Diana is too nervous to go through with it. Heather coerces her to switch clothes in the bathroom, allowing Heather to escape the hospital as \"Diana\". Pepe follows Heather, and tries to steal the dumbbell, but she shoots him in the chest. She telephones Huggins and arranges to meet him at a marina. Before going to the hospital, Pepe directs Isaac to the marina, where Isaac takes the dumbbell from Heather. She kidnaps him and Huggins and forces the latter to drive away from the marina.\n\nA rainstorm hits, and Huggins crashes into the ocean. Isaac escapes the sinking car and Heather follows him to the lighthouse. As she chases Isaac onto the balcony, he deduces that Heather was the one who was raped by her father, not Diana, and she must have started the fire that killed him. Huggins appears to arrest Heather, who tries to shoot him. Isaac pulls her over the edge of the balcony, however, sending her falling to her death. Diana is tried as Heather\u2019s accomplice, but is found not guilty. She then goes on a date with a wealthy man, posing as Heather.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=40em}}\n\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Dr. Isaac Barr\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Heather Evans\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Diana Baylor\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as Jimmy Evans\n* [[Keith David]] as Detective Huggins\n* [[Paul Guilfoyle]] as Mike O'Brien\n* [[Robert Harper (actor)|Robert Harper]] as Dr. Alan Lowenthal\n* Agustin Rodriguez as Pepe Carrero\n* Rita Zohar as Dr. Grusin\n* [[George Murdock (actor)|George Murdock]] as Judge Costello\n* [[Shirley Prestia]] as D.A.

He wrote, \"I'm a sucker for movies that look and feel like this.

Kathleen Maher of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' wrote, \"Joanou, with his puppy dog devotion to ''noir'' thrillers and Hitchcock, is hoping to get it all right by painting by the numbers. He's mixed parts of ''[[Double Indemnity]],'' ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]],'' and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]],'' but the result doesn't even live up to ''[[Dead Again]]''...\" Maher was also critical of the two leads: \"That Basinger and Gere are going to wind up in bed is no secret, but their courtship is excruciating, full of why-are-they-whispering scenes. At least Basinger gets better as she gets going, but Gere reverts to that shell-shocked acting style he adopts when lost at sea.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Kathleen|last=Maher|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/1992-02-14/139193/|title=Final Analysis|newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=February 14, 1992|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref> Rita Kempley, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', called the film \"an implausible psycho thriller\" and said director Joanou \"doesn't have any of his own ideas.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/finalanalysisrkempley_a0a298.htm|first=Rita|last=Kempley|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|title=''Final Analysis,'' an implausible psycho thriller|date=February 7, 1992|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film has an approval rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] of 56% based on 27 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/final_analysis/|title=''Final Analysis''|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 13, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n====Nominations====\n* [[MTV Movie Awards]]\n** [[MTV Movie Award for Most Desirable Female|Most Desirable Female]], Kim Basinger (lost to [[Linda Hamilton]] for ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'')\n* [[Golden Raspberry Awards]]\n** [[Razzie Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]] - Kim Basinger (also for ''[[Cool World]]''; lost to [[Melanie Griffith]] for ''[[Shining Through]]'' and ''[[A Stranger Among Us]]'')\n** [[Razzie Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] - Charles Roven, Paul Junger Witt, and Tony Thomas (lost to ''Shining Through'')\n** [[Razzie Award for Worst Screenplay|Worst Screenplay]] - Wesley Strick (also story) and Robert Berger (story) (lost to ''[[Stop! or My Mom Will Shoot]]'')\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AFI film|id=59243|title=Final Analysis}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0104265| title=Final Analysis}}\n* {{Allmovie title|id=17277|title=Final Analysis}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|id=final_analysis|title=Final Analysis}}\n* {{YouTube|xWiUQhvxjG4|''Final Analysis'' film trailer}}\n* {{Mojo title|finalanalysis}}\n\n{{Phil Joanou}}\n\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1992 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1992 thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s erotic thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American erotic thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]\n[[Category:Incest in film]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:American psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about psychiatry]]\n[[Category:Films about sisters]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Phil Joanou]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Charles Roven]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Fenton]]\n[[Category:Works set in lighthouses]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
