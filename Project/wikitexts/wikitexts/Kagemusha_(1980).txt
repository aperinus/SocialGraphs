It is set in the [[Sengoku period]] of [[Japanese history]] and tells the story of a lower-class criminal who is taught to impersonate the dying ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' [[Takeda Shingen]] to dissuade opposing lords from attacking the newly vulnerable clan. ''Kagemusha'' is the Japanese term for a [[political decoy]], literally meaning \"shadow warrior\". The film ends with the climactic 1575 [[Battle of Nagashino]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rayns|first=Tony|title=Talking with the Director|series=[[Criterion Collection]]|year=2006|publisher=[[Criterion Collection]]|page=13}}</ref>\n\nThe film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]] (tied with ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]''). It was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and received other honours. In 2009 the film was voted at No. 59 on the list of ''The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time'' by Japanese film magazine [[Kinema Junpo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mubi.com/topics/greatest-japanese-films-by-magazine-kinema-junpo-2009-version|title=Greatest Japanese films by magazine Kinema Junpo (2009 version)|access-date=2011-12-26|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711021342/http://mubi.com/topics/greatest-japanese-films-by-magazine-kinema-junpo-2009-version|archive-date=July 11, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[Sengoku period]], [[Takeda Shingen]], ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of the [[Takeda clan]], meets a thief his brother [[Takeda Nobukado|Nobukado]] spared from [[Crucifixion#Japan|crucifixion]] due to the thief's uncanny resemblance to Shingen; the brothers agree that he would prove useful as a double, and they decide to use the thief as a ''kagemusha'', a political decoy. Later, while the Takeda army [[Battle of Mikatagahara|lays siege]] to a castle belonging to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], Shingen is shot while observing the battlefield. He then orders his forces to withdraw and commands his generals to keep his death a secret for three years before succumbing to his wound. Meanwhile, Shingen's rivals [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and [[Uesugi Kenshin]] each contemplate the consequences of Shingen's withdrawal, unaware of his death.\n\nNobukado presents the thief to [[Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen|Shingen's generals]], proposing to have him impersonate Shingen full-time. Although the thief is unaware of Shingen's death initially, he eventually finds Shingen's preserved corpse in a large jar, having believed it to contain treasure. The generals then decide they cannot trust the thief and release him. Later, the jar is dropped into [[Lake Suwa]], which spies working for the Tokugawa and Oda forces witness. Suspecting that Shingen has died, the spies go to report their observation, but the thief, having overheard the spies, returns to the Takeda forces and offers to work as a ''kagemusha''. The Takeda clan preserves the deception by announcing that they were simply making an offering of [[sake]] to the god of the lake, and the spies are ultimately convinced by the thief's performance.\n\nReturning home, the ''kagemusha'' successfully fools Shingen's [[retinue]] by imitating the late warlord's gestures and learning more about him. When the ''kagemusha'' must preside over a clan meeting, he is instructed by Nobukado to remain silent until Nobukado brings the generals to a consensus, whereupon the ''kagemusha'' will simply agree with the generals' plan and dismiss the council. However, Shingen's son [[Takeda Katsuyori|Katsuyori]] is incensed by his father's decree of the three year subterfuge, which delays his inheritance and leadership of the clan. Katsuyori thus decides to test the ''kagemusha'' in front of the council, as the majority of the attendants are still unaware of Shingen's death. He directly asks the ''kagemusha'' what course of action should be taken, but the ''kagemusha'' is able to answer convincingly in Shingen's own manner, which further impresses the generals.\n\nSoon, in 1573, Nobunaga mobilizes his forces to attack [[Azai Nagamasa]], continuing his campaign in central [[Honshu]] to maintain his control of [[Kyoto]] against the growing opposition. When the Tokugawa and Oda forces launch an attack against the Takeda, Katsuyori begins a counter-offensive against the advice of his generals. The ''kagemusha'' is then forced to lead reinforcements in the [[Battle of Takatenjin]], and helps inspire the troops to victory. In a fit of overconfidence however, the ''kagemusha'' attempts to ride Shingen's notoriously temperamental horse, and falls off. When those who rush to help him see that he does not have Shingen's battle scars, he is revealed as an impostor, and is driven out in disgrace, allowing Katsuyori to take over the clan. Sensing weakness in the Takeda clan leadership, the Oda and Tokugawa forces are emboldened to begin a full-scale offensive into the Takeda homeland.\n\nNow in full control of the Takeda army, Katsuyori leads a counter-offensive against Nobunaga in [[Battle of Nagashino|Nagashino]]. Although courageous in their assault, several waves of Takeda cavalry and infantry are cut down by volleys of [[Tanegashima (gun)|gunfire]] from Oda arquebusiers deployed behind wooden stockades, effectively eliminating the Takeda army. The ''kagemusha'', who has followed the Takeda army, desperately takes up a spear and charges toward the Oda lines before being shot himself. Mortally wounded, the ''kagemusha'' attempts to retrieve the ''[[f\u016brinkazan]]'' banner, which had fallen into a river, but succumbs to his wounds in the water where his body is carried away by the current.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:KAGEMUSHA 2.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Kurosawa's own artwork]]\n[[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] are credited at the end of the film as [[executive producer]]s in the international version. This is because they persuaded [[20th Century Fox]] to make up a shortfall in the film's budget when the original producers, [[Toho Studios]], could not afford to complete the film. In return, 20th Century Fox received the international distribution rights to the film. Coppola and Kurosawa appeared together in [[Suntory]] whisky commercials to raise money for the production.<ref>Conrad, David A. (2022). ''Akira Kurosawa and Modern Japan'', 195 McFarland & Co.</ref>\n\nKurosawa originally cast the actor [[Shintaro Katsu]] in the title role. Katsu left the production, however, before the first day of shooting was over; in an interview for the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD, executive producer [[Francis Ford Coppola|Coppola]] states that Katsu angered Kurosawa by arriving with his own camera crew to record Kurosawa's filmmaking methods. It is unclear whether Katsu was fired or left of his own accord, but he was replaced by [[Tatsuya Nakadai]], a well-known actor who had appeared in a number of Kurosawa's previous films. Nakadai played both the ''kagemusha'' and the lord whom he impersonated.\n\nKurosawa wrote a part in ''Kagemusha'' for his longtime regular actor [[Takashi Shimura]], and ''Kagemusha'' was the last Kurosawa film in which Shimura appeared. However, the scene in which he plays a servant who accompanies a western doctor to a meeting with Shingen was cut from the foreign release of the film. The [[Criterion Collection]] [[DVD]] release of the film restored this scene as well as approximately another eighteen minutes in the film.\n\nAccording to Lucas, Kurosawa used 5,000 extras for the final battle sequence, filming for a whole day, then he cut it down to 90 seconds in the final release. Many special effects, and a number of scenes that filled holes in the story, landed on the \"[[cutting-room floor]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as {{nihongo|[[Takeda Shingen]]|\u6b66\u7530 \u4fe1\u7384}} and the {{nihongo|Kagemusha|\u5f71\u6b66\u8005}}\n* [[Tsutomu Yamazaki]] as {{nihongo|[[Takeda Nobukado]]|\u6b66\u7530 \u4fe1\u5ec9}}, Shingen's younger brother.\n* [[Kenichi Hagiwara]] as {{nihongo|[[Takeda Katsuyori]]|\u6b66\u7530 \u52dd\u983c}}, Shingen's son and heir.\n* [[Jinpachi Nezu]] as {{nihongo|Tsuchiya Sohachiro|\u571f\u5c4b \u5b97\u516b\u90ce}}, chief bodyguard for Takeda Shingen and the Kagemusha.\n* [[Hideji \u014ctaki]] as {{nihongo|[[Yamagata Masakage]]|\u5c71\u7e23 \u660c\u666f}}, the Takeda's most experienced general.\n* [[Daisuke Ryu]] as {{nihongo|[[Oda Nobunaga]]|\u7e54\u7530 \u4fe1\u9577}}, one of Shingen's chief rival for control of Japan.\n* [[Masayuki Yui]] as {{nihongo|[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]|\u5fb3\u5ddd \u5bb6\u5eb7}}, Nobunaga's strongest ally.\n* [[Kaori Momoi]] as {{nihongo|Otsuyanokata|\u304a\u6d25\u5f25\u306e\u65b9}}, one of Shingen's concubines.\n* [[Mitsuko Baisho]] as {{nihongo|Oyunokata|\u65bc\u3086\u3046\u306e\u65b9}}, another one of Shingen's concubines.\n* [[Hideo Murota]] as {{nihongo|[[Baba Nobuharu]]|\u99ac\u5834 \u4fe1\u6625}}, one of the chief generals in the Takeda Clan's army.\n* [[Takayuki Shiho]] as {{nihongo|[[Nait\u014d Masatoyo]]|\u5185\u85e4 \u660c\u8c4a}}, another important general in the Takeda Clan's army.\n* [[K\u014dji Shimizu]] as {{nihongo|[[Atobe Katsusuke]]|\u8de1\u90e8 \u52dd\u8cc7}}\n* [[Noburo Shimizu]] as {{nihongo|[[Hara Masatane]]|\u539f \u660c\u80e4}}\n* [[Sen Yamamoto]] as {{nihongo|[[Oyamada Nobushige]]|\u5c0f\u5c71\u7530 \u4fe1\u8302}}\n* [[Shuhei Sugimori]] as {{nihongo|[[K\u014dsaka Masanobu]]|\u9ad8\u5742 \u660c\u4fe1}}\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as {{nihongo|Taguchi Gyobu|\u7530\u53e3\u5211\u90e8}}\n* Eiichi Kanakubo as {{nihongo|[[Uesugi Kenshin]]|\u4e0a\u6749 \u8b19\u4fe1}}, Shingen's other chief rival for control of Japan.\n* Francis Selleck as Priest\n* [[Jir\u014d Yabuki]] as Equestrian\n* [[Kamatari Fujiwara]] as Doctor\n\n==Release==\n''Kagemusha'' was released theatrically in Japan on April 26, 1980, where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=322}} It was released in the United States theatrically on October 6, 1980, where it was distributed by [[Twentieth Century Fox]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=322}} The theatrical version in the United States had a 162-minute running time.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=322}} It was released on home video in the United States with a 180-minute running time in 2005.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=322}}\n\n===Box office===\n''Kagemusha'' was the number one Japanese film on the domestic market in 1980, earning {{\u00a5|2.7 billion}} in [[Theatrical rental|distribution rental]] income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eiren.org/toukei/1980.html|title=Kako haiky\u016b sh\u016bny\u016b j\u014di sakuhin 1980-nen|publisher=Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan|language=ja|access-date=4 February 2011}}</ref> It earned {{US$|8 million|long=no}} within ten days of release at 217 Japanese theaters.<ref>{{cite news |title=Japanese TV Shows Abound in Violence |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/763557255/ |access-date=19 April 2022 |work=[[Abilene Reporter-News]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |date=31 May 1981 |page=31 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> The film grossed a total of {{\u00a5|5.5 billion}} ({{US$|26 million|long=no}}) in Japanese [[box office]] gross receipts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kagemusha |url=https://www.tohokingdom.com/movies/kagemusha.htm |website=Toho Kingdom |access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nOverseas, the film grossed {{US$|4 million|long=no}} in the United States<ref name=\"BOM\">{{Mojo title|kagemusha}}</ref> (equivalent to over {{US$|14 million|long=no}} adjusted for inflation in 2021)<ref>{{cite web |title=Kagemusha (1980) -
