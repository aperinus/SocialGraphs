Macy]]. It was released nationwide in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on March 2, 2007. It was the last film by [[Tollin/Robbins Productions]].\n\nIt was the last Touchstone Pictures film to be distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, after [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] retired the Buena Vista moniker across their company's divisions in the same year and also the theatrical distribution label became [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nDoug Madsen, Woody Stevens, Bobby Davis, and Dudley Frank are disillusioned middle-aged [[Everyman|everymen]] in a [[Cincinnati]] [[suburb]]. Doug is a [[dentist]] with trouble bonding with his son Billy; Dudley is a single [[Programmer|computer programmer]] afraid to talk to women; Bobby is a henpecked [[plumber]] disrespected by his wife Karen and daughters; and Woody is a wealthy [[lawyer]] married to a [[supermodel]].\n\nThey escape their routine lives on weekends by riding in their [[motorcycle club]], the Wild Hogs.\n\nWoody's wife is [[Divorce|divorcing]] him, rendering him [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]]. He convinces his friends to take a road trip to [[California]]. At a bar they encounter the Del Fuegos, an [[outlaw biker gang]] headed by Jack Blade. Feeling disrespected by the Wild Hogs, Jack steals Dudley's bike, so he has to travel in a [[sidecar]].\n\nWoody suggests they return to the bar to get Dudley's bike back but no one joins him. He secretly retrieves the bike and cuts the fuel lines of the gang's bikes, falsely telling the others he threatened a lawsuit. The Del Fuegos attempt to pursue the Wild Hogs to no avail. Jack's dropped cigarette ignites the leaking fuel and burns the bar down. The Wild Hogs run out of gas and push their bikes to [[Madrid, New Mexico]], where they are initially mistaken for the Del Fuegos. They learn that the Del Fuegos have been terrorizing the town, and Dudley falls in love with the [[diner]] owner Maggie.\n\nTwo Del Fuegos, however, spot them, reporting their location to Jack. He tells them not to harm the Wild Hogs until he gets there, leaving them unable to fight back when Bobby confronts the pair and scares them off. The Wild Hogs are hailed as heroes and celebrate into the night.\n\nThe next day, the Wild Hogs' departure is interrupted by the arrival of the Del Fuegos. Jack threatens to wreck the town unless the Wild Hogs pay for their bar. Woody admits to the others what he did to get Dudley's bike back, as well as his real reason for the trip - his bankruptcy. Jack and the Del Fuegos take over Maggie's diner and threaten to burn it but Dudley confronts them; he is held hostage.\n\nAfter failing to rescue Dudley, the Wild Hogs then decide to fight four of the members; the Wild Hogs are badly beaten but refuse to give up. The townspeople band together and just as Jack threatens to take on the rest of the town, Damien Blade, Jack's father and the founder of the Del Fuegos, arrives. He lectures Jack for his behavior. He says the bar is heavily insured and says it is a good opportunity for the gang to ride the open road as intended.\n\nDoug's and Bobby's wives arrive, and Doug reconciles with Billy. Karen orders Bobby to return with her, but he convinces her to let him finish the ride. The Wild Hogs arrive in [[Southern California]] where everyone except Dudley crashes into a surfboard. During the credits, it is revealed that the Wild Hogs called ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' to give the Del Fuegos a new bar. The Del Fuegos react in joy while the Wild Hogs watch the event on television.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Dr. Doug Madsen\n* [[John Travolta]] as Woody Stevens\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Bobby Davis\n* [[William H.
