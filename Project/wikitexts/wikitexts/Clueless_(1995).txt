The film was followed by a spin-off [[Clueless (TV series)|television sitcom]], and [[Clueless (novels)|series of books]].\n\n==Plot==\nCher Horowitz lives in a [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] mansion with her wealthy father Mel, a gruff [[litigator]]; her mother died during a [[liposuction]] procedure when Cher was a baby. She is attractive, stylish, good-natured and popular. She attends Bronson Alcott High School with her best friend Dionne Davenport, who is also wealthy and beautiful. Cher and Dionne are both named after \"great singers of the past who now do infomercials.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://imsdb.com/scripts/Clueless.html|title=Clueless}}</ref> Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray Duvall, a relationship which Cher believes  is a pointless endeavour for Dionne, who ought to be dating more mature guys. Josh, Cher's [[Social conscience|socially conscious]] stepbrother, visits her during a break from college. They spar continually but playfully. She mocks his idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain and superficial, saying that her only direction in life is \"toward the mall\".\n\nAfter receiving a poor grade, Cher decides to play matchmaker to a hard-grading teacher at her school, Mr. Hall, with another of her teachers, Miss Geist. She orchestrates a romance between them so Hall relaxes his grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad grade on her report card. After seeing their newfound happiness, Cher realises that she enjoys doing good deeds. She then decides to give back to the community by \"adopting\" a \"clueless\" new girl at school, Tai Frasier. \n\nCher and Dionne give Tai a makeover, which provides her with confidence and a sense of style. Cher tries to extinguish the attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable but clumsy [[slacker]], and to steer her towards Elton, a handsome and popular student. However, he has no interest in Tai and instead tries to [[make out]] in his car with Cher after a party; she rebuffs him. Elton leaves Cher at a car park out of spite and she is mugged at gunpoint. Josh picks her up and the two begin to bond.\n\nFashion-conscious new student Christian attracts Cher's attention at school and becomes her target boyfriend. When she goes to a party with him, Josh gets jealous and follows her to the party \"just to take care of her.\" When Christian comes over to watch some movies at her home, she tries to seduce him, but he deflects her advances. Murray subsequently tells Cher and Dionne that Christian is gay. Despite the failure of her romantic overtures, Cher remains friends with him, primarily due to her admiration of his good taste in art and fashion.\n\nCher's privileged life takes a negative turn when Tai's newfound popularity strains their relationship. Her frustration escalates after she fails her driving test and cannot change the result. When Cher returns home in a depressed mood, Tai confesses her feelings for Josh and asks her for help in pursuing him. Cher says she is not right for Josh, leading to a quarrel which results in Tai calling her \"a virgin who can't drive\". Feeling \"totally clueless\", Cher reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life. After thinking about why she is bothered by Tai's romantic interest in Josh, Cher finally realises that she is actually in love with him. \n\nIn response to her epiphany, Cher begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including captaining the school's [[Pismo Beach]] disaster relief effort. She accepts an invitation by Travis to a skating tournament where she reconciles with Tai. Cher and Josh eventually follow through on their feelings for one another, culminating in a tender kiss. Ultimately, her friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified, Tai and Travis begin dating, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist get married, and Cher catches the wedding bouquet \u2013 helping Josh win a $200 bet. They then embrace and kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n{{See also|List of Clueless characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n<!--- Order per end credits --->\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Cher Horowitz\n* [[Stacey Dash]] as Dionne Davenport\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Tai Frasier\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Josh Lucas\n* [[Donald Faison]] as Murray Duvall \n* [[Elisa Donovan]] as Amber Mariens\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as Travis Birkenstock\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as Elton Tiscia\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Melvin \"Mel\" Horowitz\n* Aida Linares as Lucy\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Wendell Hall\n* [[Twink Caplan]] as Miss Toby Geist\n* [[Justin Walker (actor)|Justin Walker]] as Christian Stovitz\n* Sabastian Rashidi as Paroudasm\n* Herb Hall as Principal\n* [[Julie Brown]] as Coach Millie Stoeger\n* Susan Mohun as Heather\n* [[Nicole Bilderback]] as Summer Han\n* Ron Orbach as DMV Tester\n* Sean Holland as Lawrence\n* [[Roger Kabler]] as College Guy\n* [[Jace Alexander]] as Robber\n* Josh Lozoff as Logan\n* [[Joseph D.

Spunky, carefree, entitled, perpetually single, and matchmaker extraordinaire, both Cher and Emma enjoy the satisfaction of helping those who are without love find a perfect match. This is first seen within the first fifteen minutes of the film when both she and Dionne pair their English teacher with the school's Debate teacher. However, this is more prominently reflected when Cher does everything in her power to pair her newest friend Tai. While both Emma and Cher mean well in their matchmaking attempts, neither of them realizes the depths of her actions nor her feelings towards Josh/Mr. Knightley until Tai/Harriet asks her to set her up with Josh/Mr. Knightley.\n* '''Josh/Mr. Knightley''': Cher's former stepbrother, whom she finds utterly repulsive. At the beginning of the movie, she states that she has no positive feelings towards Josh in the slightest. The two bicker continually. However, as the movie progresses, Josh is shown to be more caring and considerate towards Cher, becoming defensive towards her choices of men and in life. In the novel, Mr. Knightley is the brother of Emma's sister's husband and is Emma's only critic. Cher/Emma and Josh/Mr. Knightley eventually realize they are in love.\n* '''Tai/Harriet Smith''': Tai, representative of the young, fair, and socially awkward Harriet Smith, is a newcomer to Bronson Alcott High School. Soon after, she is swept off her feet by both Cher and Dionne as they help her (unintentionally) become the most popular girl in school, to Cher's dismay. At the beginning of the film, Tai is attracted to Travis, a well-meaning, skateboard-riding, pot-smoking social recluse. Harriet is likewise attracted to humble farmer Robert Martin. Each is pressured by Cher/Emma to reject her lower-status potential lover, instead being pushed towards Elton/Mr Elton. Disastrously for Cher, Tai then falls for Josh. Emma is likewise horrified when Harriet falls in love with Mr. Knightley. In both cases, this leads to the heroine examining her own true feelings.\n* '''Mel Horowitz/Mr. Henry Woodhouse''': Similarly to ''Emma'', Mr. Horowitz is a well known and respected man within his circle of friends, though there is one major difference between both characters: while Mr. Horowitz is shown to have little to no care for his health, Mr. Woodhouse is considered to be a valetudinarian. Both characters are shown to love their daughters greatly while not always being so forward in their affection.\n* '''Christian/Frank Churchill''': The initially appealing love interest of Cher, whom she convinces herself she must be in love with, similar to Frank Churchill in the book. In the book, Churchill is not available to Emma because he is secretly already engaged; in the film, Christian is not available to Cher because he is gay. Both characters engage in surface-level flirting with the heroine and make her consider her own feelings.\n* '''Travis/Robert Martin''': A stoner and skater who has a mutual attraction with Tai; however, their attempts at courtship are derailed for a time by Cher's attempt to set Tai up with Elton. Travis is an underachiever, is constantly late for class and often receives poor grades. In the book, Emma considers Martin, a farmer, to be beneath Harriet.\n* '''Elton Tascia/Mr. Elton''': Elton is a popular student whom Cher attempts to fix up with Tai. As is the case with the Elton from the book, he is not interested in Tai/Harriet and mistakenly believes that Cher/Emma is interested in him.\n* '''Amber/Mrs. Elton''': Cher's antagonist, who is implied to be dating Elton after Cher turns down his advance, similar to Mr. Elton taking a wife after Emma rejects him.\n* '''Miss Geist/Miss Taylor''' and '''Mr. Hall/Mr. Weston''': The initial targets of Cher's/Emma's matchmaking.\n\n==Home media==\n''Clueless'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] on December 19, 1995 by [[Paramount Home Video]].
