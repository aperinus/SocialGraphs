The film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], alongside [[Rupert Grint]] and [[Emma Watson]] as Harry's best friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. Its story follows Harry's fifth year at [[Hogwarts]] School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as the [[Ministry of Magic]] is in denial of [[Lord Voldemort]]'s return.

It has been noted as a case of [[Hollywood accounting]], as Warner Bros. claimed the film lost $167 million, despite its total gross.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nWhile staying at the Dursleys, [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] are attacked by [[Dementors]]. Harry repels them using a Patronus spell. The Ministry of Magic detects the underaged Harry using magic and expel him from Hogwarts, though he is later exonerated.\n\nThe [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)|Order of the Phoenix]], a secret organization founded by [[Albus Dumbledore]], informs Harry that the [[Ministry of Magic]] is oblivious to [[Lord Voldemort]]'s return. At the Order's headquarters, Harry's godfather, [[Sirius Black]], mentions that Voldemort seeks an object he previously lacked; Harry believes it to be a weapon.\n\nMinister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] has appointed [[Dolores Umbridge]] as [[Hogwarts]] new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor. Umbridge's refusal to teach defensive spells causes her and Harry to clash. Harry is forced to write lines for \"lying\" about Voldemort. A magic quill etches the words into his hand as he writes. Ron and Hermione are outraged, but Harry refuses to tell Dumbledore, who has distanced himself from Harry. As Umbridge gains more control over the school, Ron and Hermione help Harry form \"[[Dumbledore's Army]]\", a secret group to teach students defensive spells. Umbridge recruits [[Slytherin]]s for an Inquisitorial Squad to spy on the other students. Meanwhile, Harry and [[Cho Chang]] develop romantic feelings for each other.\n\nOne night, Harry envisions [[Arthur Weasley]] being attacked at the Ministry, seeing it from the attacker's perspective. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore has [[Severus Snape]] teach Harry [[Occlumency]] to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. During a lesson, Harry sees Snape's memories of how his father, James, bullied and tormented Snape in school. The connection between Harry and Voldemort further isolates Harry from his friends. Meanwhile, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], Sirius' deranged [[Death Eater]] cousin, escapes [[Azkaban]] prison along with nine other [[Death Eaters]]. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad expose Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore, falsely accused of forming it, escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Harry believes Cho betrayed Dumbledore's Army to Umbridge, ending their budding relationship. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress.\n\nHarry experiences a vision that Voldemort is torturing Sirius. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rush to Umbridge's office to alert the Order via the Floo Network. Umbridge catches them and, as she is about to severely punish Harry, Hermione claims Dumbledore has hidden a \"secret weapon\" in the Forbidden Forest. She and Harry lead Umbridge to where [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] giant half-brother, [[Grawp]] is kept. The [[centaurs]] confront them and kidnap Umbridge after she insults and attacks them. Harry, Hermione, Ron, [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] and [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] fly to the Ministry of Magic on [[Thestral]]s to save Sirius.\n\nThe six enter the Department of Mysteries and recover the object that Voldemort is after, a bottled prophecy labeled with Harry's name. Death Eaters, including [[Lucius Malfoy]] and Bellatrix Lestrange, ambush them. Lucius reveals that Harry's vision of Sirius being tortured was a ruse to lure him there. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, and a fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters ensues. The Death Eaters overpower the students and force Harry to surrender the prophecy. When Harry hands it to Lucius, Sirius and [[Remus Lupin]] arrive with Order members [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and [[Mad-Eye Moody]]. As they attack the Death Eaters, Lucius drops the prophecy, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, Bellatrix kills Sirius.\n\nVoldemort appears, but moments before he can kill Harry, Dumbledore arrives. A violent duel erupts, destroying much of the Atrium, while Bellatrix escapes. The two wizards are evenly matched, so Voldemort possesses Harry's body, wanting Dumbledore to sacrifice him. The love Harry feels for his friends and family quickly drives out Voldemort. Ministry officials arrive before Voldemort [[Apparition (Harry Potter)|disapparates]]; Fudge admits that Voldemort has returned and resigns in disgrace. Umbridge is dismissed and Dumbledore returns as Hogwarts headmaster. Dumbledore explains he had distanced himself from Harry to prevent Voldemort exploiting their connection. He also reveals the prophecy. As he grieves Sirius' death, Harry tries coming to terms with the prophecy: \"Neither can live while the other survives.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]: A 15-year-old British [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] famous for surviving his parents' murder at the hands of Voldemort as an infant, who now enters his fifth year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]]: Harry's best friend at Hogwarts.\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]]: Harry's [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Muggle-born|Muggle-born]] best friend and the brains of the trio.\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]: one of Voldemort's most loyal [[Death Eater]]s and the cousin of Sirius Black.\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]]: the half-giant Gamekeeper and [[Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher at Hogwarts and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Lord Voldemort]]: leader of the Death Eaters, a dark wizard intent on conquering the Wizarding World.\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Albus Dumbledore]]: the legendary Hogwarts headmaster and leader of the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]].\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as [[Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]]: Ex-[[Auror]] and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as [[Vernon Dursley]]: Harry's Muggle uncle.\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Lucius Malfoy]]: a falsely pardoned senior Death Eater.\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Sirius Black]]: Harry's godfather and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Severus Snape]]: the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Potions|Potions]] teacher at Hogwarts and the Head of [[Slytherin]]\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as [[Petunia Dursley]]: Harry's Muggle aunt.\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Minerva McGonagall]]: the [[Transfiguration (Harry Potter)|Transfiguration]] teacher at Hogwarts and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n* [[Imelda Staunton]] as [[Dolores Umbridge]]: the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher and a plant from the corrupt [[Ministry of Magic]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4360000/newsid_4365800/4365880.stm |title=Top actress \"will play Umbridge\" |work=BBC |date=21 October 2005 |access-date=23 October 2006}}</ref>\n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Remus Lupin]]: Harry's ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as [[Sybill Trelawney]]: the [[Divination]] teacher at Hogwarts.\n* [[Julie Walters]] as [[Molly Weasley]]: the Weasley matriarch and a mother figure to Harry, also a member of the Order of the Phoenix.\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- Do Not Add Any More Cast -->\n[[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] appears as Molly Weasley's husband, Arthur, a member of the Order of the Phoenix.
