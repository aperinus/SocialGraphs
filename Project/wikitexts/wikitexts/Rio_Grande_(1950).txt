It is the third installment of Ford's \"cavalry trilogy\", following two [[RKO Pictures]] releases: ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948) and ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949). Wayne plays the lead in all three films, as Captain Kirby York in ''Fort Apache'', then as Captain Nathan Brittles in ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'', and finally as a promoted Lieutenant Colonel Kirby Yorke in ''Rio Grande'' (scripts and production billing spell the York[e] character's surname differently in ''Fort Apache'' and ''Rio Grande''). ''Rio Grande'''s supporting cast features [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Claude Jarman Jr.]], [[Harry Carey Jr.]], [[Chill Wills]], [[J. Carrol Naish]], [[Victor McLaglen]], [[Grant Withers]], the Western singing group the [[Sons of the Pioneers]] and [[Stan Jones (songwriter)|Stan Jones]].  \n\n==Plot==\nLieutenant Colonel Kirby Yorke (Wayne) is posted on the [[Texas]] frontier with the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiment]] to defend settlers against attacks by marauding [[Apache]]s. Colonel Yorke is under considerable pressure due to the Apaches using [[Mexico]] as a sanctuary from pursuit, and by a serious shortage of troops in his command. The action of the movie is set in the summer of 1879 (\"fifteen years after the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|Shenandoah]]\").\n\n[[Suspense|Tension]] is added when Yorke's son (whom he has not seen in 15 years), [[Trooper (rank)|Trooper]] Jefferson Yorke ([[Claude Jarman Jr.]]), is one of 18 recruits sent to the regiment. He had flunked out of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], but immediately enlisted as a private in the Army. In a private \"father-son\" meeting in the commanding officer's tent, Trooper Yorke informs his father that he does not expect, nor want, any special treatment because he is his son. He asks that he be treated like any other soldier\u2014to which the colonel agrees. By his willingness to undergo any test and trial, Jeff is befriended by a pair of older recruits, Travis Tyree ([[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]]) (who is on the run from the law) and Daniel \"Sandy\" Boone ([[Harry Carey Jr.]]), who take him under their wings.\n\nWith the arrival of Yorke's estranged wife, Kathleen ([[Maureen O'Hara]]), who has come to take the underage Yorke home by buying him out of his enlistment, further tension is added. During the Civil War, Yorke had been forced by circumstances to burn Bridesdale, his wife's plantation home in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. Sergeant Major Quincannon ([[Victor McLaglen]]), who put the torch to Bridesdale, is still with Yorke and is a constant reminder to Kathleen of the episode. In a showdown with his mother, Jeff refuses her attempt to buy him out of the Army by reminding her that not only the commander's signature is required to discharge him, but his own is needed, as well, and he chooses to stay in the Army. The tension brought about in the struggle over their son's future (and possibly the attentions shown to her by Yorke's junior officers) rekindles the romance the couple once felt for each other.\n\nThe Apaches attack the fort one night. Many of them are killed by the awakened troopers, but they succeed in freeing their leader, who had been captured at the start of the movie.\n \nTwo [[U.S. Marshal|U.S. marshals]] from Texas arrive at the post with a warrant for Trooper Tyree's arrest on a manslaughter charge. Confined to the post hospital, with the connivance of the regimental surgeon ([[Chill Wills]]) and Sergeant Major Quincannon, he breaks jail, steals Colonel Yorke's horse, and goes on the run, intending to stay away until the marshals leave.\n\nYorke is visited by his former [[American Civil War|Civil War]] commander, [[Philip Sheridan]] ([[J. Carrol Naish]]), now Commanding General of the Military Division of the Missouri, the headquarters responsible for pacifying the Great Plains. Sheridan has decided to order Yorke to cross the [[Rio Grande]] into Mexico in pursuit of the Apaches and kill them all, an action with serious political implications, since it violates the sovereignty of another nation.\n\nIf Yorke fails in his mission to destroy the Apache threat, he will have to face a court-martial. Sheridan, in quiet acknowledgment of what he is asking Yorke to risk, promises that if it comes to that, \"the members of the court will be the men who rode down the Shenandoah with us\" during the Civil War. Yorke accepts the assignment.\n\nYorke leads his men toward Mexico, only to learn that a wagonload of children from his fort, who were being taken to [[Fort Bliss, Texas|Ft. Bliss]] for safety \u2013 ironic in that the fort was named for a famous mathematician, [[William Wallace Smith Bliss]], and it was failing mathematics that caused Jefferson Yorke to flunk out of West Point \u2013 has been captured by the Apaches. Tyree trails the Apaches to their hideout in Mexico, and then rejoins his regiment with the information and a plan to rescue the children. After permitting three troopers\u2014Tyree, Boone, and Jeff\u2014to infiltrate the ruined church in the Mexican village where the Apaches have taken the children, Yorke leads his regiment in an all-out attack. The cavalrymen rescue all of the children unharmed, though Colonel Yorke is wounded by an arrow that he orders Jeff to remove. He is taken back to the fort by his victorious troops, where Kathleen meets him and holds his hand as he is carried on a [[travois]] into the post.\n\nAfter Colonel Yorke recovers, Tyree, Boone, Jeff, Navajo Scout Son of Many Mules, and Corporal Bell are decorated. At the ceremony, when one of the Texas marshals reappears, Trooper Tyree is given a furlough to continue his run from the law, stealing General Sheridan's horse for the purpose. As the troops pass in review (with the regimental band playing ''[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]'' at the General's request to please Mrs. Yorke), the movie closes.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Rio Grande (1950) - publicity still 1.jpg|thumb|262px|[[John Wayne]], [[Maureen O'Hara]] and [[Claude Jarman Jr.]] in ''Rio Grande'' ]]\n{{Div col}}\n<!-- No Role listing in film-->\n<!-- Starring-->\n* [[John Wayne]] as Lieutenant Colonel Kirby Yorke\n* [[Maureen O'Hara]] as Kathleen Yorke\n<!-- Co-starring-->\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Trooper Travis Tyree\n* [[Claude Jarman Jr.]] as Trooper Jefferson Yorke\n* [[Harry Carey Jr.]] as Trooper Daniel \"Sandy\" Boone\n* [[Chill Wills]] as Dr. Wilkins, Regimental Surgeon\n<!-- With -->\n* [[J.

Instead, he wanted to film the Ireland-set [[Romance film|romantic]] [[Comedy drama|comedy-drama film]] ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' with Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, but [[Herbert Yates]], the studio president of [[Republic Pictures]], insisted that Ford first make ''Rio Grande'' with the same pairing of Wayne and O'Hara because he thought the script of ''The Quiet Man'' was weak and that the story was of little general interest. Yates insisted that ''Rio Grande'' be made before ''The Quiet Man'', to offset the anticipated losses on that film.<ref>''The Quiet Man'' 60th Anniversary Edition, Special Features: Maltin, Leonard, \"The Making of The Quiet Man,\" 1992.</ref> When ''The Quiet Man'' was eventually released in 1952, though, it vastly out performed ''Rio Grande'' by grossing $3.8 million in its first year and giving Yates and Republic Pictures one of the top-10 hits of the year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first= Tag|title=John Ford: The Man and his Films|url=https://archive.org/details/johnfordmanhisfi0000gall|url-access=registration|publisher=University of California Press|year= 1986|page=[https://archive.org/details/johnfordmanhisfi0000gall/page/499 499]}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nThe script for ''Rio Grande'' was written by Irish-born screenwriter [[James Kevin McGuinness]].

Wayne and O'Hara also starred together in ''[[McLintock!]]'' (1963) and ''[[Big Jake (film)|Big Jake]]'' (1971).
