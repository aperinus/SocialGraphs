Based on [[Giles Foden]]'s [[The Last King of Scotland|1998 novel]], it depicts the dictatorship of Ugandan President [[Idi Amin]] through the perspective of a fictional Scottish doctor. The film stars [[Forest Whitaker]] and [[James McAvoy]] in these respective roles, with [[Kerry Washington]], [[Simon McBurney]], and [[Gillian Anderson]] in supporting roles. The title of the film refers to Amin's claim of being the [[King of Scotland]].\n\nA British and German co-production, the film was released in the United States on 27 September 2006 and in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2007. It grossed $48.4 million on a $6 million budget and received positive reviews, with acclaim for Whitaker's performance. Whitaker won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], among other accolades.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1970, Nicholas Garrigan graduates from medical school at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|University of Edinburgh]]. With dull prospects at home, he decides to seek adventure abroad by working at a Ugandan missionary clinic run by Dr. David Merrit and his wife, Sarah. Garrigan becomes attracted to Sarah, who enjoys the attention but refuses to engage in an [[extramarital affair]].\n\nMeanwhile, General [[Idi Amin]] overthrows incumbent president [[Milton Obote]] in a ''[[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]].'' Amin gives a well-received speech, but Sarah is  pessimistic, noting that similar enthusiasm had once been shown for Obote. \n\nGarrigan is called to a minor car accident where he treats Amin's hand. During the incident, Garrigan takes a gun and shoots a mortally wounded cow because no one else has the presence of mind to put it out of its misery. Amin is impressed by his quick action and initiative. Fond of [[Scotland]] as a symbol of resilience and admiring of the Scottish people for their resistance to the English, Amin is delighted to discover Garrigan's nationality and exchanges his military shirt for Garrigan's Scotland shirt. Later, Amin invites Garrigan to become his personal physician and take charge of modernising the country's healthcare system.\n\nGarrigan soon becomes Amin's trusted confidant and is relied on for much more than medical care, such as matters of state. Although Garrigan is aware of violence around [[Kampala]], he accepts Amin's explanation that cracking down on the opposition will bring lasting peace to the country.\n\nGarrigan discovers that the polygamous leader has ostracised the youngest of his three wives, Kay, because she has given birth to an epileptic son, Mackenzie. When treating Mackenzie, Garrigan and Kay form a relationship and have sex, but Kay tells him he must find a way to leave Uganda.\n\nEventually, Garrigan begins to lose faith in Amin as he witnesses the increasing paranoia, murders, and xenophobia. Amin replaces Garrigan's [[British passport]] with a Ugandan one to prevent him from escaping, which leads Garrigan to frantically seek help from Stone, the local [[British Foreign Office]] representative. Garrigan is told the British will help him leave Uganda if he uses his position to assassinate Amin, but Garrigan refuses.\n\nIn 1972, Amin orders the [[expulsion of Asians from Uganda]] over the protest of Garrigan. This creates a [[labor shortage]] that divebombs Uganda's economy.\n\nKay informs Garrigan that she has become pregnant with his child. Aware that Amin will murder her for infidelity if he discovers this, she begs Garrigan for a secret abortion. Delayed by Amin's command that he attend a press conference with Western journalists, Garrigan fails to meet Kay at the appointed time. She concludes she has been abandoned and seeks out a primitive abortion in a nearby village, where she is apprehended by Amin's forces. Garrigan finds her dismembered corpse on an autopsy table and falls retching to his knees, finally confronting the inhumanity of Amin's regime, and decides killing him will end it all.\n\n[[Operation Entebbe|A hijacked aircraft is flown]] to [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]] by pro-[[Palestinians|Palestinian]] hijackers seeking asylum. Amin, sensing a major publicity opportunity, rushes to the scene, taking Garrigan along. At the airport, one of Amin's bodyguards discovers Garrigan's plot to poison Amin under the ruse of giving him pills for a headache. Garrigan is beaten by Amin's henchmen before Amin arrives and discloses he is aware of the relationship with Kay. As punishment, Garrigan's chest is pierced with meat hooks before he is hanged by his skin.\n\nAmin arranges a plane for the release of non-[[Israel]]i passengers, and the torturers leave Garrigan unconscious on the floor while they relax in another room. Garrigan's medical colleague, Dr. Junju, takes advantage of the opportunity to rescue him. He urges Garrigan to tell the world the truth about Amin's regime, asserting that the world will believe Garrigan because he is white. Junju gives Garrigan his own jacket, enabling him to mingle unnoticed with the crowd of freed hostages and board the plane. When the torturers discover Garrigan's absence, Junju is killed for aiding in the escape. While Amin is being informed of Garrigan's escape, which he is too late to prevent, Garrigan boards the plane and tearfully remembers the people of Uganda.\n\nAn [[epilogue]] reveals that the Entebbe incident ruined Amin's reputation in the international community, and in 1979 he made a foolhardy decision to [[Uganda\u2013Tanzania War|invade Tanzania]], which promptly counterattacked and captured Kampala, overthrowing him. He lived the rest of his life in exile in Saudi Arabia until his passing in 2003.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as [[Idi Amin]]\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Dr. Nicholas Garrigan\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Kay Amin\n* [[Gillian Anderson]] as Sarah Merrit\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Stone\n* [[David Oyelowo]] as Dr. Junju\n* Stephen Rwangyezi as Jonah Wasswa\n* [[Abby Mukiibi Nkaaga]] as Masanga\n* Adam Kotz as David Merrit\n* [[David Ashton (actor)|David Ashton]] as Garrigan Sr.\n* [[Barbara Rafferty]] as Mrs. Garrigan\n* Sam Okelo as Bonny\n* Sarah Nagayi as Tolu\n* Chris Wilson as Perkins\n* Apollo Okwenje Omamo as Mackenzie Amin\n* Louis Asea as Campbell Amin\n* Joanitta Bewulira-Wandera as Malyamu Amin\n* Consodyne Buzabo as Nora Amin\n* Shabir Mir as Zumba\n* [[Cleopatra Koheirwe]] as Joy\n* [[Michael Wawuyo]] as [[Andrew Mukooza]]\n* [[Martina Amati]] as Italian Journalist\n* [[Angela Kalule]] as Nightclub singer{{Div col end}}\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\nWhile the character of Idi Amin and some of the events surrounding him in the film are mostly based on fact, Garrigan is a fictional character. Foden has acknowledged that one real-life figure who contributed to the character Garrigan was English-born [[Bob Astles]], who worked with Amin.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Interview with Giles Foden|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/boldtype/1298/foden/interview.html|access-date=13 October 2014|publisher=Random House}}</ref> Another real-life figure who has been mentioned in connection with Garrigan is Scottish doctor [[Wilson Carswell]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Pells, Rachael|date=10 October 2014|title=Douglas Carswell profile|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/douglas-carswell-profile-a-prolific-blogger-who-makes-his-own-jam-9786266.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220618/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/douglas-carswell-profile-a-prolific-blogger-who-makes-his-own-jam-9786266.html |archive-date=18 June 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|access-date=13 October 2014|publisher=independent.com}}</ref> Like the novel on which it is based, the film mixes fiction with real events to give an impression of Amin and [[Second Republic of Uganda|Uganda under his rule]]. While the basic arc of Amin's rule is followed, the events in the film depart from both actual history and the plot and characters in Foden's novel.\n\nIn real life and in the book, Kay Amin was impregnated by her lover, who was a Ugandan physician (given a different name in the book than in real life). She died during a botched abortion performed by him, who subsequently committed suicide.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"The myths surrounding Idi Amin.\"|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin9.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528211152/http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin9.php|archive-date=28 May 2007|access-date=2007-04-16|df=dmy-all}} ''Daily Monitor'', accessed 12 December 2009.</ref>  Astles said in a lengthy interview for ''The Times'' with the journalist [[Paul Vallely]] that her body was dismembered by her lover so it could be hidden and was then sewn back together on Amin's orders.<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview with Paul Vallely|newspaper=The Times|url=http://paulvallely.com/archive/?p=2682}}</ref> Amin never had a son named Campbell.\n\nContrary to the wording of the film's coda stating, \"48 hours later, Israeli Forces stormed Entebbe and liberated all but one of the hostages\", three hostages died during [[Operation Entebbe]]. The body of a fourth hostage, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, who was killed by [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] officers at a nearby hospital in retaliation for Israel's actions, was eventually returned to Israel.<ref>{{cite news|date=4 June 1979|title=Body of Amin Victim Is Flown Back to Israel|page=A3|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/04/archives/body-of-amin-victim-is-flown-back-to-israel.html}}</ref> The [[murder of Dora Bloch]] is depicted accurately in the book but not mentioned at all in the film.

Whitaker also won awards from the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]], [[New York Film Critics' Circle]], [[Los Angeles Film Critics' Association]],  [[National Board of Review]], [[National Society of Film Critics]], and many other critics awards, for a total of at least 23 major awards, with at least one more nominations. As of 2022, Whitaker from ''The Last King of Scotland'' and [[Helen Mirren|Mirren]] from ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'' are the only two lead performances for portraying real-life leaders, and is the only lead actor to ever sweep the rarest achievements known as \"[[List of Big Four Critic's Award winners and nominees#Best Actor|The Big Four]]\" critics awards ('''[[Los Angeles Film Critics Association|LAFCA]]''', '''[[National Board of Review|NBR]]''', '''[[New York Film Critics Circle|NYFCC]]''', '''[[National Society of Film Critics|NSFC]]''') as well as win the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Globe]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role|SAG]], and [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor|Critic's Choice]] at the same year.\n\nThe film received a 2007 [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]] and the BAFTA award for Best Adapted Screenplay, in addition to receiving nominations for Best Film (lost to ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'' also written by Peter Morgan). McAvoy was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he lost to [[Alan Arkin]] from ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'' (which was directed by music video directors [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris]]).\n\nThe film was received well in Uganda, where it premiered two days before Whitaker won the Best Actor Academy Award.<ref>Sarah Grainger (18 February 2007).
