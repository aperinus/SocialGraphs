Filming began in July 1998 and ended in spring 2001. It was shot using in-flight cameras, most of the footage is aerial, and the viewer appears to be flying alongside birds of successive species, especially [[Canada geese]]. They traverse every kind of weather and [[landscape]], covering vast distances in a flight for survival. The filmmakers exposed over 590 miles of film to create an 89-minute piece. In one case, two months of filming in one location was edited down to less than one minute in the final film.\n\nMuch of the aerial footage was taken of \"tame\" birds. The filmmakers raised birds of several species, including [[stork]]s and [[pelican]]s, from birth. The newborn birds [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] on staff members, and were trained to fly along with the film crews. The birds were also exposed to the film equipment over the course of their lives to ensure that the birds would react the way the filmmakers want. Several of these species had never been imprinted before. Film was shot from [[ultralight aviation|ultralights]], [[paraglider]]s, and [[hot air balloon]]s, as well as [[truck]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[motorboat]]s, remote-controlled [[robot]]s, and a [[French Navy]] warship. Its producer says that ''Winged Migration'' is neither a documentary nor [[fiction]], but rather a \"natural tale\".<ref name=\"makingof\">\"Making of\" special feature on the DVD</ref>\n\nThe film states that no [[special effect]]s were used in the filming of the birds, although some entirely [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] segments that view Earth from outer space augment the real-life footage.\n\nThe film's soundtrack by [[Bruno Coulais]] was recorded by Bulgarian vocal group [[Bulgarka Junior Quartet]] in Bulgarian, as well as [[Nick Cave]] in English and [[Robert Wyatt]]. The vocal effects include sequences in which panting is superimposed on wingbeats to give the effect that the viewer is a bird.\n\n'''Release date'''\n\n*\tFrance  2001/12/12                    \n*\tBelgium  2001/12/12\n*\tSwitzerland  2001/12/13...(German speaking region)\n*\tGreece  2001/12/14\n*\tSouth Korea  2002/03/29\n*\tGermany  2002/04/04\n*\tNetherlands  2002/04/18\n*\tHong Kong  2002/06/20\n*\tRussia  2002/06/21...(Moscow Film Festival)\n*\tCzech Republic  2002/07/8...(Karlovy Vary Film Festival)\n*\tCzech Republic  2002/07/18\n*\tCanada  2002/09/08...(Toronto Film Festival)\n*\tTurkey  2002/09/13\n*\tIsrael  2002/09/19\n*\tHungary  2002/09/19\n*\tSpain  2002/09/27\n*\tItaly  2002/11/15\n*\tLithuania  2002/12/27\n*\tPoland  2003/04/04\n*\tJapan  2003/04/05...(Tokyo)\n*\tUSA  2003/04/5...(Philadelphia International Film Festival)\n*\tSlovenia  2003/04/17\n*\tUSA  2003/04/18...(Limited)\n*\tNorway  2003/05/02...(Kristiansand International Children's Film Festival)\n*\tCanada  2003/05/30\n*\tAustralia  2003/06/19\n*\tNorway  2003/06/20\n*\tNew Zealand  2003/07/13...(Auckland International Film Festival)\n*\tMexico  2003/07/25\n*\tDenmark  2003/08/15...(Copenhagen International Film Festival)\n*\tFinland  2003/09/05\n*\tUK  2003/09/05\n*\tDenmark  2003/09/12\n*\tSweden  2003/ 11/07\n*\tIceland  2004/01/23...(French Film Festival)\n*\tArgentina  2004/07/29\n*\tChile  2005/03/31\n*\tIreland  2011/07/10...(Galway Film Fleadh)\n\n==Reception==\n''Winged Migration'' has an overall approval rating of 95% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 132 reviews, and an average rating of 8.2/10.
