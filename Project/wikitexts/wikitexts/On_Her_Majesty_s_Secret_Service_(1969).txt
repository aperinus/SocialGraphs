It is based on the [[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|1963 novel]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. Following [[Sean Connery]]'s decision to retire from the role after ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', Eon selected [[George Lazenby]], a model with no prior acting credits, to play the part of [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]. During filming, Lazenby announced that he would play the role of Bond only once.\n\nIn the film, Bond faces [[Blofeld]] ([[Telly Savalas]]), who is planning to hold the world to ransom by a threat to render all food plants and livestock infertile through the actions of a group of brainwashed \"angels of death\". Along the way Bond meets, falls in love with, and eventually marries [[Tracy Bond|Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo]] ([[Diana Rigg]]).\n\nIt is the only Bond film to have been directed by [[Peter R. Hunt]] (with this serving as his [[directorial debut]]), who had served as a [[film editor]] and [[second unit director]] on previous films in the series. Hunt, along with producers [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], decided to produce a more realistic film that would follow the novel closely. It was shot in [[Switzerland]], England, and Portugal from October 1968 to May 1969. Although its cinema release was not as lucrative as its predecessor ''You Only Live Twice'', ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' was still one of the top-performing films of the year.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vinceguerra |first1=Thomas |title=As James Bond, He Only Lived Once |url=https://nyti.ms/2Zr6XOQ |access-date=29 December 2019 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 December 2019}}</ref> Critical reviews upon release were mixed, but the film's reputation has improved greatly over time and is now regarded as one of the strongest entries in the series as well as one of the most faithful adaptations of a Fleming novel.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vinciguerra |first=Thomas |date=27 December 2019|title=50 Years Later, This Bond Film Should Finally Get Its Due |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/movies/on-her-majestys-secret-service-james-bond-lazenby.html |access-date=21 July 2020 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJames Bond saves a woman on the beach from committing suicide by drowning, and later meets her again in a casino. The woman, [[wikt:contessa|Contessa]] [[Tracy Bond|Teresa \"Tracy\" di Vicenzo]], invites Bond to her hotel room to thank him, but when Bond arrives he is attacked by an unidentified man. After subduing the man, Bond returns to his own room and finds Tracy there; she claims she was unaware of the attacker's presence. The next morning, Bond is kidnapped by several men, including the one he fought, who take him to meet Marc-Ange Draco, the head of the European crime syndicate [[Unione Corse]]. Draco reveals that Tracy is his only daughter and tells Bond of her troubled past, offering Bond one million pounds if he will marry her. Bond refuses, but agrees to continue romancing Tracy if Draco helps him track down [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], the head of [[SPECTRE]].\n\nUpon returning to [[London]], [[M (James Bond)|M]] relieves Bond of his mission to assassinate Blofeld. Furious, Bond dictates a letter of resignation to [[Miss Moneypenny|Moneypenny]], which she alters into a request for leave. Bond heads for Draco's birthday party in Portugal. There, Bond and Tracy begin a whirlwind romance, and Draco directs the agent to a law firm in [[Bern]], Switzerland. Bond breaks into the office of Swiss lawyer Gumbold and learns that Blofeld is corresponding with London [[College of Arms]] genealogist [[List of James Bond allies#Sir Hilary Bray|Sir Hilary Bray]], attempting to claim the title Count Balthazar de Bleuchamp.\n\nPosing as Bray, Bond goes to meet Blofeld, who has established a clinical allergy-research institute atop [[Piz Gloria]] in the [[Swiss Alps]]. Bond meets 12 young women (later referred to by Blofeld as his \"angels of death\"), who are patients at the institute's clinic, apparently cured of various allergies. After dinner, Bond goes to the room of one patient, Ruby, to seduce her. At midnight, while still with Ruby, Bond discovers the women go into a sleep-induced hypnotic state while Blofeld implants subliminal audio instructions. In fact, they are being [[mind control|brainwashed]] to distribute [[bacteriological warfare]] agents throughout the world.\n\nBond tries to trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland so that MI6 can arrest him without violating Swiss sovereignty. Blofeld refuses and Bond is eventually caught by henchwoman Irma Bunt. Blofeld reveals that he identified Bond after his attempt to lure him out of Switzerland, and tells his henchmen to take the agent away. Bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down from Piz Gloria while Blofeld and his men give chase. Tracy finds Bond in the village of [[Lauterbrunnen]], and they escape Bunt and her men after a car chase. A blizzard forces them to a remote barn, where Bond professes his love to Tracy and proposes marriage to her, which she happily accepts. The next morning, as the chase continues on skis, Blofeld sets off an [[avalanche]]. Tracy is captured, while Bond is buried but manages to escape.\n\nBack in London at M's office, Bond is informed that Blofeld intends to hold the world at ransom by threatening to destroy its agriculture using his brainwashed women, demanding amnesty for all past crimes, and that he be recognised as the current Count de Bleuchamp. M tells 007 that the ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond instead enlists Draco and his forces to attack Blofeld's headquarters, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a [[bobsleigh]], with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld is ensnared by tree branches.\n\nBond and Tracy marry in Portugal, then drive away in Bond's [[Aston Martin DBS]]. When Bond pulls over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car, Blofeld and Bunt commit a [[drive-by shooting]] of the couple's car. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[George Lazenby]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], MI6 agent, code number 007 \u2014 with the double zero denoting that an agent was \u201clicensed to kill\u201d on behalf of the government.\n* [[Diana Rigg]] as Countess [[Tracy Bond|Tracy di Vicenzo]], a vulnerable countess and Marc-Ange Draco's daughter, who captures Bond's heart.\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] (also known as ''Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp''), Bond's nemesis, leader of [[SPECTRE]] and in hiding.[[File:On Her Majesty's Secret Service (7).jpg|thumb|upright|Telly Savalas on location]]\n* [[Gabriele Ferzetti]] as [[Marc-Ange Draco]], Head of the Unione Corse, a major crime syndicate and Tracy's father.\n* [[Ilse Steppat]] as Irma Bunt, Blofeld's henchwoman who assists in the attempts to eliminate Bond.\n* [[Lois Maxwell]] as [[Miss Moneypenny]], M's secretary.\n* [[George Baker (British actor)|George Baker]] as [[List of James Bond allies in On Her Majesty's Secret Service#Film Biography 2|Sir Hilary Bray]], Herald in the London [[College of Arms]], whom Bond impersonates in Piz Gloria.

The position was consolidated when Lazenby accidentally punched a [[professional wrestler]], who was acting as [[stunt coordinator]], in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=82}} Lazenby was offered a contract for seven films; however, he was convinced by his agent [[Ronan O'Rahilly]] that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s, and as a result he left the series after the release of ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' in 1969.<ref name=\"OHMSS documentary\" />\n\nFor [[Tracy Draco]], the producers wanted an established actress opposite neophyte Lazenby.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=199}} [[Brigitte Bardot]] was invited, but after she signed to appear in ''[[Shalako (film)|Shalako]]'' opposite Sean Connery, the deal fell through,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=83}} and [[Diana Rigg]]\u2014who had already been the popular heroine [[Emma Peel]] in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''\u2014was cast instead.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=69}} Rigg said one of the reasons for accepting the role was that she always wanted to be in an [[epic film]].<ref name=\"OHMSS documentary\" /> Hunt and Maibaum admired [[Donald Pleasence]]'s performance as Blofeld in ''You Only Live Twice'' but wanted to recast the character.
