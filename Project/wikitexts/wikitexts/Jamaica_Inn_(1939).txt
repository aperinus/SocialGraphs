It is the first of three of du Maurier's works that Hitchcock adapted (the others were her novel ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'' and short story \"[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]\"). It stars [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Maureen O'Hara]] in her first major screen role. It is the last film Hitchcock made in the United Kingdom before he moved to the United States.<ref name=\"JIHitchcockGuide\">{{cite web|url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-jamaica-inn-1939|title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: Jamaica Inn (1939)|website=Brenton Film}}</ref>\n\nThe film is a [[period piece]] set in [[Cornwall]] in 1820, in the real [[Jamaica Inn]] (which still exists) on the edge of [[Bodmin Moor]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in 1820 (at the start of the reign of [[King George IV]], as mentioned by Pengallan in his first scene).\n\nOver and above its function as a hostelry, Jamaica Inn houses the clandestine rural headquarters of a gang of cut-throats and thieves, led by innkeeper Joss Merlyn. They have become [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wreckers]]. They are responsible for a series of engineered shipwrecks in which they extinguish coastal warning beacons, causing ships to run aground on the rocky [[Cornwall#Coastal areas|Cornish coast]]. They then kill the surviving sailors and steal their cargo.\n\nOne evening, a young Irish-woman, Mary Yellan, is dropped off by coach near the inn, at the home of the local squire and [[justice of the peace]], [[Sir#United Kingdom and Commonwealth|Sir]] Humphrey Pengallan. She requests the loan of a horse so she can ride to Jamaica Inn to re-unite with her Aunt Patience (the wife of Joss Merlyn). Despite Pengallan's warnings, she intends to live at Jamaica Inn with her late mother's sister. It transpires that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the wrecking gang; he learns from his well-to-do friends and acquaintances when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be caused, and fences the stolen cargo. He uses the lion's share of the proceeds to support his lavish lifestyle and passes a small fraction of them to Joss and the gang.\n\nIn another part of the inn, the gang convenes to discuss why they get so little money for their efforts. They suspect Jem Trehearne, a gang member for only two months, of embezzling goods. They hang him from one of the rafters of the inn, but when they leave, Mary cuts the rope and saves his life. Trehearne and Mary flee the gang, narrowly avoiding capture by swimming for their lives. The next morning, they row a boat ashore to seek the protection of Pengallan, unaware that he is the gang's benefactor. Trehearne reveals to Pengallan that he is actually an undercover law-officer on a mission to investigate the wrecks. Pengallan is alarmed but maintains his composure and pretends to join forces with Trehearne. Mary overhears their conversation and goes to the inn to warn Patience that she must flee in order to avoid being arrested as an accomplice. However, Patience refuses to leave her husband.\n\nMeanwhile, Pengallan learns of a ship full of precious cargo which is due to pass the local coastline. He informs Joss and the gang, who go to the beach, and there extinguish the coastal warning beacon, as they wait for the ship to appear. However, Mary re-lights the warning beacon, and the ship's crew avoid the treacherous rocks and sail by unharmed. The gang angrily resolves to kill Mary as revenge for preventing the wreck, but Joss, who has developed a reluctant admiration for her, rescues her and the two escape by horse-cart. Joss is shot in the back and collapses when they reach Jamaica Inn. As Patience is about to tell Mary that Pengallan is the secret leader of the wrecking gang, Pengallan shoots and kills Patience from off-camera. Joss dies of his wound as well. Pengallan then takes Mary hostage, ties and gags her, and tells her that he plans to keep her now that she has no one else in the world. He drives her, still tied up and covered by a heavy cloak, to the harbour, where they board a large ship going to France.\n\nBack at Jamaica Inn, Trehearne and a dozen soldiers take Joss's gang into custody. Trehearne then rides to the harbour to rescue Mary and capture Pengallan, who attempts to escape. During the chase, he climbs to the top of the ship's mast, from which he jumps to his death, shouting \"Make way for Pengallan!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Charles Laughton]] as Sir Humphrey Pengallan\n* [[Leslie Banks]] as Joss Merlyn\n* [[Maureen O'Hara]] as Mary Yellen\n* [[Robert Newton]] as James 'Jem' Trehearne - Sir Humphrey's Gang\n* [[Marie Ney]] as Patience Merlyn\n* [[Horace Hodges]] as Butler (Chadwick)\n* [[Hay Petrie]] as Groom (Sam) \n* [[Frederick Piper]] as Agent (Davis)\n* [[Herbert Lomas (actor)|Herbert Lomas]] as Tenant (Dowland)\n* [[Clare Greet]] as Tenant (Granny Tremarney)\n* [[William Devlin (actor)|William Devlin]] as Tenant (Burdkin)\n* [[Emlyn Williams]] as Harry the Pedlar - Sir Humphrey's Gang\n* [[Jeanne de Casalis]] as Sir Humphrey's friend\n* [[Mabel Terry-Lewis]] as Lady Beston\n* [[A.

Laughton initially was cast as Joss, but he cast himself in the role of the villainous Pengallan, who originally was a hypocritical preacher but was rewritten as a squire because unsympathetic portrayals of the clergy were forbidden by the [[Production Code]] in Hollywood.<ref name=\"Complete\">{{cite book\n  | last = Harris\n  | first = Richard A.\n  |author2=Michael S.

This forced Hitchcock to reveal that Pengallan was a villain in league with the smugglers earlier in the film than Hitchcock had initially planned.<ref name=\"leitch\" />\n\nLaughton's acting was a problem point as well for Hitchcock.

Laughton also demanded that Maureen O'Hara be given the lead after watching her screen test (her acting in the screen test was sub par, but Laughton could not forget her eyes). After filming finished, Laughton brought her to Hollywood to play [[Esm\u00e9ralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]] opposite his [[Quasimodo]] in the hit 1939 version of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', after which she became an international star.<ref name=JIHitchcockGuide/>\n\nOn release, the film was a substantial commercial success and in March 1939 Hitchcock moved to Hollywood to begin his contract with [[David O. Selznick]]. Thus ''Jamaica Inn '' was his last  picture made in Britain until the 1970s.<ref name=\"BFI\" /><ref name=\"allmovie\">{{cite web|last=Brenner |first=Paul |title=The Lady Vanishes |work=Allmovie |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v28077 |access-date=30 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Credits===\n* Director - [[Alfred Hitchcock]]\n* Producer - [[Erich Pommer]] \n* Writers - [[Sidney Gilliat]] (screenplay and dialogue), [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]] (screenplay), [[J.

The film's light-hearted, often camp, banter and portly landlord, were seen as being too far removed from the darker characters, sinister inn and coastline depicted in du Maurier's story. Today it is often considered to be one of Hitchcock's \"lesser\" works.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book\n| last = Spoto\n| first = Donald\n| title = The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock\n| publisher = Da Capo\n| year = 1999\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/184 184\u2013185]\n| isbn = 0-306-80932-X\n| url-access = registration\n| url = https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/184\n}}</ref><ref name=\"GriffinNadel2012\">{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Susan|last2=Nadel|first2=Alan|title=The Men Who Knew Too Much: Henry James and Alfred Hitchcock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TswioBdI-5MC&pg=PA204|access-date=5 October 2012|date=1 March 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976442-6|page=204}}</ref> Hitchcock expressed his disappointment with the film even before it was finished, stating that it was a \"completely absurd\" idea.<ref name=\"McDevittJuan2009\">{{cite book|last1=McDevitt|first1=Jim|last2=Juan|first2=Eric San|title=A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks With the Master of Suspense|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&pg=PA113|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6388-0|page=113}}</ref> However, the film still garnered a large profit (US$3.7 million, a huge success at the time) at the box office.<ref name=\"leitch\">{{cite book\n  | last = Leitch\n  | first = Thomas\n  | title = The Encyclopedia of Alfred Hitchcock: From Alfred Hitchcock Presents to Vertigo\n  | publisher = Facts on File\n  | date = 31 May 2002\n  | url = http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~muffin/jamaica_irony.html\n  }}</ref>\nDaphne du Maurier was not pleased with the finished production and for a while she considered withholding the film rights to ''Rebecca''.<ref name=\"BFI\" /> In 1978, film critic [[Michael Medved]] gave ''Jamaica Inn'' a place in his book ''[[The Fifty Worst Films of All Time]]''.<ref>Michael Medved: ''[[The Fifty Worst Films of All Time]]''</ref> but this was based on a viewing of a poor quality and incomplete US print, the only copy available at the time.<ref name=JIHitchcockGuide/>\n\n==Copyright and home video status==\n''Jamaica Inn'', like all of Hitchcock's British films, is copyrighted worldwide<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide#slaying-the-public-domain-myth|title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: Slaying the public domain myth|website=Brenton Film}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-dial-c-for-copyright|title=Alfred Hitchcock: Dial \u00a9 for Copyright|website=Brenton Film}}</ref> but has been heavily [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]] on home video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/bootlegs-galore-the-great-alfred-hitchcock-rip-off|title=Bootlegs Galore: The Great Alfred Hitchcock Rip-off|website=Brenton Film}}</ref> Despite this, various licensed, restored releases have appeared on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and [[video on demand]] services from Network Distributing and [[Arrow Films]] in the UK, the [[Cohen Film Collection]] in the US and many others.<ref name=JIHitchcockGuide/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0031505|title=Jamaica Inn}}\n* {{YouTube|id=5dVyesI-0e8|title=''Jamaica Inn''}}\n* {{Amg movie|25773|Jamaica Inn}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=1010889-jamaica_inn|title=Jamaica Inn}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=79665}}\n* {{AFI film|id=4648|title=Jamaica Inn}}\n* [https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-jamaica-inn-1939 ''Alfred Hitchcock Collectors\u2019 Guide: Jamaica Inn'' at Brenton Film]\n\n{{Alfred Hitchcock}}\n{{Launder and Gilliat}}\n{{Charles Laughton}}\n{{Alma Reville}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1939 films]]\n[[Category:1939 adventure films]]\n[[Category:1930s crime films]]\n[[Category:British adventure films]]\n[[Category:1930s English-language films]]\n[[Category:British black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Daphne du Maurier]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Films set in hotels]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1810s]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Associated British Studios]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alfred Hitchcock]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by J.
