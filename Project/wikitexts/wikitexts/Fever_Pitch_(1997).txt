Firth plays Paul Ashworth, the character based on Hornby, a teacher at a school in south Hertfordshire and his romance with Sarah Hughes ([[Ruth Gemmell]]), a new teacher who joins Ashworth's school. The film culminates with the real life events of Arsenal's match against title rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[Liverpool F.C. 0\u20132 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|final game of the season]] on 26 May 1989, with a [[last-minute goal]] by [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] giving Arsenal the 2\u20130 win they needed to secure the title.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Paul Ashworth\n* [[Ruth Gemmell]] as Sarah Hughes\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Steve\n* [[Neil Pearson]] as Mr. Ashworth\n* [[Lorraine Ashbourne]] as Mrs. Ashworth\n* [[Holly Aird]] as Jo\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Ray\n* Emily Conway as Sasha \n* Richard Claxton as Robert Parker\n*[[Annette Ekblom]] as Robert's Mother\n* Andy Raines as Football Referee\n* [[Mike Ingham]] as Radio Announcer\n* [[Ken Stott]] as Ted, the Headmaster\n\n==Production==\nThe film also stars [[Neil Pearson]] as Paul's father and [[Mark Strong]] as Steve, Paul's best friend. Nick Hornby has a cameo as a beaten opposition manager in a school football match. Parts of the film were shot on location in the surroundings of [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]]; as the [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] at Highbury had since been replaced, the scenes of fans on the terraces were instead filmed at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]'s [[Craven Cottage]] stadium.\n\n==Remake==\nIn 2005, the film was remade in an American version also entitled ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' starring [[Jimmy Fallon]] and [[Drew Barrymore]], with the [[2004 World Series]] [[Boston Red Sox]] replacing Arsenal.  To avoid confusion, this 2005 remake is known as ''The Perfect Catch'' in the UK.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/69348/fever-pitch|title=Fever Pitch|website=The Guardian|access-date=26 December 2019}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0119114|title=Fever Pitch}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1099980_fever_pitch}}\n\n{{Nick Hornby}}\n{{Arsenal F.C.}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fever Pitch (1997 Film)}}\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Arsenal F.C. mass media]]\n[[Category:British romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Film4 Productions films]]\n[[Category:British association football films]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n[[Category:Films about fandom]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1988]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1989]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Nick Hornby]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Nick Hornby]]\n[[Category:Films \u00e0 clef]]\n[[Category:Films based on autobiographies]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
