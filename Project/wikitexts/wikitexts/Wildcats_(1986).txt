When her wish is finally granted, Molly leaves her job coaching girls' track at an affluent high school (Prescott High School) to take over a football team at an inner-city [[Chicago]] high school (Central High School)\u2014the kind of place where guard dogs are needed to patrol the campus. At first the new coach's idealism and optimism are suffocated with racial and gender prejudice, but eventually her overriding spirit begins to whip her unruly team into shape. Molly hustles teenage criminal and former star football player Levander \u2018Bird\u2019 Williams into rejoining the team and adds the massive and comedic Phillip Finch. At the same time, she must also struggle to win a battle for the custody of her two young daughters. The real test for Molly comes when her Central High team faces Prescott in the city championship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Molly McGrath\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Verna McGrath\n* [[Robyn Lively]] as Alice Needham\n* Brandy Gold as Marian Needham\n* [[James Keach]] as Frank Needham\n* [[Jan Hooks]] as Stephanie Needham\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Dan Darwell\n* [[Nipsey Russell]] as Principal Ben Edwards\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Levander \"Bird\" Williams\n* [[Tab Thacker]] as Phillip Finch\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Trumaine\n* [[Jsu Garcia|Nick Corri]] as Cerulo\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Krushinski \n* Willie J.
