The film stars [[Jack Black]], [[Joan Cusack]], [[Mike White (filmmaker)|Mike White]], and [[Sarah Silverman]]. Black plays struggling [[Rock music|rock]] [[guitarist]] Dewey Finn, who is fired from his band and subsequently poses as a [[substitute teacher]] at a prestigious [[College-preparatory school|prep school]]. After witnessing the musical talent of the students, Dewey forms a band of fourth-graders to attempt to win the upcoming [[Battle of the Bands]] and use his winnings to pay his rent.\n\n''School of Rock'' was released on October 3, 2003, by [[Paramount Pictures]], grossing $131 million worldwide on a $35 million budget. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Black's performance and humor. Disregarding inflation, it was the highest-grossing music-themed comedy of all time until the release of ''[[Pitch Perfect 2]]'' in 2015.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=musiccomedy.htm|title=List of Top Grossing Music Comedy Films, 1984-Present|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=August 7, 2014}}</ref> A stage [[School of Rock (musical)|musical adaptation]] opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in December 2015,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-school-of-rock-musical-broadway-2015-20141218-story.html|title='School of Rock' musical opening on Broadway in 2015|date=December 18, 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref> and a [[School of Rock (TV series)|television adaptation]] for [[Nickelodeon]] premiered on March 12, 2016.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be between 400-700 words. -->\nRock band No Vacancy performs at a nightclub three weeks before auditioning for the [[Battle of the Bands]]. Guitarist Dewey Finn creates on-stage antics, including a stage dive that abruptly ends the performance. The next morning, Dewey's roommate Ned Schneebly and Ned's domineering girlfriend, Patty Di Marco, inform Dewey he must either pay his overdue share of the rent or move out. When Dewey meets No Vacancy at a rehearsal session, he is informed that he has been fired from the band and replaced by another guitarist, Spider. Later, while trying to sell some of his equipment, Dewey answers a phone call from Rosalie Mullins, the principal of the Horace Green [[College-preparatory school|prep school]], inquiring for Ned about a short-term position as a substitute teacher. Desperate for money, Dewey impersonates Ned and is hired. On his first day at the school, Dewey, who does not know how to spell \"Schneebly\", adopts the name \"Mr. S\" and spends the day behaving erratically, much to the students' confusion.\n\nThe next day, after observing the students' talent in music class, Dewey devises a plan to form a new band to audition for Battle of the Bands. He casts Zack Mooneyham as lead guitarist, Freddy Jones as drummer, cello player Katie on bass, pianist Lawrence on keyboards, and himself as lead vocalist and guitarist. He assigns the rest of the class to various roles of co-lead and backup singers, groupies, and roadies, with overachiever Summer Hathaway as band manager. The project takes over normal lessons, but helps the students to embrace their talents and overcome their insecurities. He reassures Lawrence, who is worried about not being cool enough for the band, Zack, whose overbearing father disapproves of rock, and Tomika, an overweight girl who is too self-conscious to audition for co-lead and backup singer despite having a powerful voice. During one lesson, he assures the kids that rock and roll can help them stand up for themselves. Band \"groupies\" Michelle and Eleni, with Summer's approval, pitch the band name \"The School of Rock\".\n\nTwo weeks into his hiring, Dewey sneaks the key band members out of school to audition for Battle of the Bands while the rest of the class stay behind to maintain cover. The group is rejected because the bill is full, but are accepted after Summer tricks the staff into thinking that the kids are terminally ill. The next day, Rosalie decides to check on Dewey's teaching progress, forcing Dewey to teach the students actual academic material. The day before Battle of the Bands, a parents' night takes place at the school, during which the parents question Dewey's teaching methods. That same night, Ned receives a paycheck from the school via mail and realizes that Dewey impersonated him. He, Patty, and the police arrive at the school and confront him. When Rosalie arrives, Dewey reveals his true identity, admits he is not a licensed teacher and then flees. Back at home, disappointed with Dewey for impersonating him, Ned tells Dewey that he should move out.\n\nThe next morning, the parents angrily confront Rosalie at her office. Not wanting their hard work to go to waste, the kids sneak out of the school. When the new substitute discovers that the kids are missing, Rosalie and the parents race to Battle of the Bands, but are forced to buy tickets in order to enter. A school bus comes to pick up Dewey, who leads the kids to the competition and decides that they should play a song Zack had written earlier. Meanwhile, having had enough of being constantly pushed around, Ned finally stands up to Patty, and goes to see the School of Rock perform. Initially dismissed as a gimmick, the band wins over the entire crowd. Much to Dewey's disappointment, No Vacancy wins, but the audience chants for School of Rock and demands an encore. While upset at the deception, the parents admit to being impressed by the kids' talent and confidence on stage, alongside Rosalie becoming ecstatic.\n\nSome time later, an after-school program known as the School of Rock opens. Dewey continues to coach the students he played with before, while Ned, who has rediscovered his passion for rock music, teaches beginners.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Jack Black]] as Dewey Finn (lead and backing vocals, rhythm guitar), an energetic, down-on-his-luck guitarist slacker who becomes a substitute teacher.\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Rosalie \"Roz\" Mullins, the overworked principal of the Horace Green prep school who secretly loves rock music.\n* [[Mike White (filmmaker)|Mike White]] as Ned Schneebly, Dewey's responsible but submissive roommate and best friend, who formerly dreamed of being a rock star, but gave up.\n* [[Sarah Silverman]] as Patty Di Marco, Ned's domineering girlfriend\n* [[Miranda Cosgrove]] as Summer \"[[Tinker Bell|Tinkerbell]]\" Hathaway (band manager), the class factotum\n* Joey Gaydos Jr. as Zack \"Zack-Attack\" Mooneyham (lead guitar)\n* Kevin Clark as Freddy \"Spazzy McGee\" Jones (drums)\n* Rivkah Reyes{{efn|name=Reyes|Credited as Rebecca Brown; ''School of Rock'' was released before Reyes came out as non-binary and changed their name.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=rivkahreyes|last=reyes|first=rivkah|title=hi.

Sammy James Jr. of the band [[The Mooney Suzuki]] penned the title track with screenwriter Mike White, and the band backed up Jack Black and the child musicians on the soundtrack recording of the song. The film's director, Richard Linklater, scouted the country for talented 13-year-old musicians to play the rock and roll music featured on the soundtrack and in the film. The soundtrack includes \"[[Immigrant Song]]\" by [[Led Zeppelin]], a band that has a very long history of denying permission for use of their songs in film and television. Linklater came up with the idea to shoot a video on the stage used at the film's ending, in which Jack Black begs the band for permission with the crowd extras cheering and chanting behind him. The video was sent directly to the living members of Led Zeppelin ([[Jimmy Page]], [[Robert Plant]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]), who granted permission for the song.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lawrence.com/news/2003/oct/02/black_diamond/|title= Black diamond: Jack Black hits all the right notes in 'School of Rock'|last=Niccum|first=Jon|work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=October 2, 2003|access-date=August 12, 2020}}</ref> The video is included on the DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n===Songs featured in the film===\n# \"[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)]]\" by [[AC/DC]] (Dewey uses the lyrics in a speech to the class)\n# \"Fight for Your Love\" by No Vacancy*\n# \"Stay Free\" by [[The Clash]]\n# \"[[Touch Me (The Doors song)|Touch Me]]\" by [[The Doors]] (Dewey sings this to Lawrence, who plays the keyboard part)*\n# \"[[Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?]]\" [[Ramones]] cover by [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]\n# \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]*\n# \"[[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]]\" by AC/DC\n# Guitar [[riff]]s Dewey plays to Zack:\n## \"[[Iron Man (song)|Iron Man]]\" by [[Black Sabbath]]\n## \"[[Smoke on the Water]]\" by [[Deep Purple]]\n## \"[[Highway to Hell (song)|Highway to Hell]]\" by AC/DC \n# \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\" by [[The Who]]*\n# \"[[The Greatest Love of All]]\" by [[George Benson]] (Dewey mentions the lyrics as his reason for no testing)\n# \"[[Roadrunner (Jonathan Richman song)|Roadrunner]]\" by [[The Modern Lovers]]\n# \"[[Bonzo Goes to Bitburg|My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)]]\" by Ramones*\n# \"The Wait ([[Killing Joke]] cover)\" by [[Metallica]]\n# \"In the Ancient Times\" by School of Rock\n# \"Sad Wings\" by [[Brand New Sin]]\n# \"Mouthful of Love\" by [[Young Heart Attack]]\n# \"Black Shuck\" by [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]] (on the CD soundtrack release this is switched to another Darkness track \"Growing On Me\" due to the amount of foul language in \"Black Shuck\".)\n# \"[[Immigrant Song]]\" by [[Led Zeppelin]]*\n# \"[[Set You Free (The Black Keys song)|Set You Free]]\" by [[The Black Keys]]*\n# \"[[Edge of Seventeen]]\" by [[Stevie Nicks]]*\n# \"Ballrooms of Mars\" by [[T.
