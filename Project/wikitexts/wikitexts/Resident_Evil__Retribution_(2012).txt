It is also the third to be written and directed by Anderson after the [[Resident Evil (film)|first film]] and [[Resident Evil: Afterlife|previous installment]]. The film focuses on [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] (Milla Jovovich) captured by the [[Umbrella Corporation]], forcing her to make her escape from an underwater facility in the [[Extreme North]], used for testing the T-virus.\n\nWritten and directed by Anderson, ''Retribution'' was planned to be filmed [[back to back film production|back to back]] with the sixth installment, but Anderson decided to focus on the fifth film. Filming took place in [[Toronto, Ontario]] from mid-October to December 23, 2011. The film has many returning actors and characters, along with new characters from the video games not featured in the previous films, including [[Leon S. Kennedy]], [[Ada Wong]], and [[Barry Burton]].<ref name=\"sept14\"/>\n\nThe film was released in 2D, [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]]<ref name=\"Plot\">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/121/1216176p1.html|title=Resident Evil: Retribution Title Tweak|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 9, 2012|access-date=January 9, 2012}}</ref> to a box-office success, grossing over $240 million worldwide, and received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the characters, plot and acting, while praising the 3D, visual effects and [[stage combat|fight choreography]]. The [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] for the film was released on December 21, 2012, in the U.S. A sixth film, ''[[Resident Evil: The Final Chapter]]'', was released in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and the riders on the Umbrella Corporation freighter ''Arcadia'' are attacked by a fleet of [[tiltrotor]]s led by Alice's brainwashed former ally, [[Jill Valentine]]. Alice is captured during the attack while the fates of [[Chris Redfield]], [[Claire Redfield]], and [[K-Mart (Resident Evil)|K-Mart]] are left ambiguous. An Alice clone awakens in the suburbs, living with her husband, Todd, and her deaf daughter, Becky. Zombies attack, revealing the suburbia as Raccoon City during the [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|contamination incident]]. Alice and Becky drive away from the undead with the help of [[Rain Ocampo]]; as they escape, they are hit by a truck, knocking Rain unconscious. Alice hides Becky inside another house but is killed by a zombified Todd. Meanwhile, the captured Alice awakens in an underground facility and is interrogated by Jill. During a power failure, Alice escapes her cell, rearms, and finds herself in a simulation of [[Shibuya Crossing|Shibuya Square, Tokyo]]. Fighting her way against zombies, she enters a control room filled with dead Umbrella employees and encounters [[Ada Wong]], one of [[Albert Wesker]]'s top agents.\n\nWesker appears on a screen, explaining that both no longer serve Umbrella, and the power outage was staged by him. Wesker also reveals that the [[Red Queen (Resident Evil)|Red Queen]], one of Alice's arch-enemies, was reactivated after the [[Resident Evil (film)|Hive incident]] and now controls Umbrella. He continues that the facility is underwater, formerly a Soviet naval outpost in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka, Russia]], designed by Umbrella for manufacturing clones and creating simulated outbreaks to show the effect of the [[T-virus]]. Ada and Alice aim to rendezvous with a rescue crew organized by Wesker, which includes [[Leon S. Kennedy]], [[Barry Burton]], and Luther West, Alice's [[Resident Evil: Afterlife|former ally]]. Leon's team plants explosives near the entrance of the facility, which will detonate in two hours to ensure its destruction. The group plans to meet with Alice and Ada in the Raccoon City suburbia area. In a [[New York City]] simulation, Alice and Ada defeat two Executioners; Leon's team enters a [[Moscow]] simulation but is surrounded by a heavily armed [[Las Plagas]] undead horde.\n\nIn the suburban setting, Alice and Ada encounter Becky, who mistakes Alice for her clone mother, and is instantly attached to her. They also find Jill and the clones of Alice's deceased allies: [[List of Resident Evil film characters#James Shade/One|James \"One\" Shade]], \"evil\" Rain Ocampo, and [[Carlos Oliveira (character)|Carlos Oliveira]], who are sent to capture them. During a shootout, Ada gives Alice her [[smart glasses]] and grappling hook so that she and Becky can find their way out, before Ada is separated. The two encounter the \"good\" clone of Rain in the Moscow simulation. Alice gives her a weapon to help keep Becky safe. She then rescues Leon's surviving crew from the barrage of Las Plagas zombies and a giant [[Licker (Resident Evil)|Licker]]. Once united, the group reaches the submarine pens in the facility exit, but are ambushed by Jill's team. During the ensuing fight, Becky is captured by the Licker, and \"good\" Rain is killed. Alice rescues Becky and kills the Licker. Barry sacrifices himself holding the Umbrella operatives off long enough to ensure the others' escape. The explosives at the entrance go off: Leon and Luther escape rapid flooding, while Alice and Becky survive through the ventilation system.\n\nOn the surface, their snowmobile is knocked over by Jill's [[Oscar-class submarine|submarine]]. Jill and \"evil\" Rain confront the group, holding Ada as a hostage. During the ensuing fight, Alice is able to tear the mind-controlling scarab off Jill's chest, returning her to normal. Meanwhile Rain\u2014now enhanced with superhuman strength and healing, thanks to the Las Plagas parasite\u2014joins the fight, kills Luther, and knocks out Leon. Realizing she is too powerful to fight, Alice shoots the ice under Rain, who is dragged underwater by swimming zombies from the undersea installation. Alice, Jill, and the remaining survivors travel to Wesker's headquarters, a heavily barricaded and fortified [[White House]], staffed by the remainders of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]]. Alice meets Wesker in the [[Oval Office]], where he injects her with another strand of the T-virus, returning her superhuman abilities. On the roof, he explains that the Red Queen is trying to wipe out humanity, and all of the remaining uninfected humans are in the base. The U.S. Military and remaining Umbrella Corp. soldiers start defending the White House against enormous hordes of T-virus abominations.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Resident Evil film characters}}\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and her clones.

S. Anderson was in discussion with Screen Gems of filming the 5th and 6th film [[back to back film production|back to back]]. But Anderson later decided to just focus on ''Resident Evil: Retribution''.<ref name=\"collider1\" /> Anderson returned as writer and director, [[Glen MacPherson|Glen McPherson]] serves as director of photography, Kevin Phipps as [[production designer]],<ref name=\"sept14\" /> and [[Nick Powell (musician/composer)|Nick Powell]] as both a fight choreographer and second-unit director.<ref name=\"collider1\" />\n\n===Influences===\nWhen Ada and Alice encounter each other the first time they recreate a scene from the game ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' in their brief fight. Another element they featured was the [[Las Plagas|Las Plagas parasite]]. Las Plagas plays a part in the film and allows the undead to \"run around, ride motorbikes, and shoot machine guns.\"<ref name=\"ColliderDetails\" /> An action scene inspired by ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' where the characters are driving a [[Hummer]] while being chased by zombies is featured, but for the film the Hummer was changed to a [[Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Rolls Royce Phantom]].<ref name=\"ColliderDetails\" /> The metal bug on Jill Valentine's chest can be seen in ''Resident Evil 5''.\n\nAside from the video games, writing for the film was heavily influenced by science-fiction films. \"I think ''[[Inception]]'' had a huge impact on everyone,\" says Bolt, \"and I think ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' is an important film to Paul. Everybody knows, because he talks about it enough, the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' series]], ''[[Blade Runner]]'', all these things are inspirations.\"\n\nMakeup effects supervisor Paul Jones stated that he wanted the makeup on the zombies to look realistic. He took inspiration from [[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|''Day of the Dead'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/resident-evil-5-retribution-set-visit |title=RESIDENT EVIL 5 RETRIBUTION Set Visit |date=January 19, 2012 |publisher=Collider.com |access-date=2012-07-07}}</ref>\n\nThe film's fight sequences were influenced by [[Asian cinema]]. \"We watched a lot of [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai]] movies this time around because of the movies (Powell) has done,\" says Anderson. \"He did ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' as well. He has worked with a lot of Japanese stuntmen and he has worked with a lot of [[Hong Kong]] stuntmen. But we felt the area that hadn't been mined by western cinema much was that whole kind of high impact Thai style of fighting. So we just watched a lot of action sequences from a lot of Thai movies. There were moves and just a general feel that we thought we could infuse the movie with. You know, that kind of bone crunch where you really feel the impact. We tried to bring that into the movie, which is also good for 3D because obviously 3D makes it harder to sell those kind of fake phony punches because you see the distance between the fist and the face. So that kind of Thai style of fighting where you actually make contact is a lot stronger.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/jeremy-bolt-don-carmody-robert-kulzer-resident-evil-5-retribution-interview |title=Producers Jeremy Bolt, Don Carmody, and Robert Kulzer RESIDENT EVIL 5 RETRIBUTION Interview |publisher=Collider.com |date=2012-01-19 |access-date=2012-07-07}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Milla Jovovich & Paul W.
