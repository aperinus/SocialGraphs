The film marks Van Damme's third collaboration with director Sheldon Lettich (who wrote ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]'' and directed ''[[Lionheart (1990 film)|Lionheart]]'') and second collaboration with [[Bolo Yeung]] (the first being ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]'' in 1988). ''Double Impact'' was released in the United States on August 9, 1991.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Hong Kong]] during the year 1966, business partners Paul Wagner and Nigel Griffith open the [[Victoria Harbour]] [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel|Tunnel]]. Paul attends with his wife Katherine and their identical twin infant sons, Chad and Alex. After the celebration, the family is followed home by their bodyguard, Frank Avery, whom they dismiss. Once he leaves, a [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] hit squad follows them. A shootout ensues, in which Paul is killed. Katherine begs the Triads to spare the twins but is killed by Moon, the top henchman. Their maid is able to escape with Alex and Frank eventually saves Chad; the maid leaves Alex at a Hong Kong orphanage and Frank raises Chad in France.\n\n25 years later in 1991, Chad and Frank are running a successful martial arts dojo in [[Los Angeles]] when Frank tells a surprised Chad about a new \"business\" in Hong Kong. The two go to a mahjong parlor and a woman, mistaking Chad for Alex, takes him back to Alex's room. When Alex arrives, he knocks out Chad for being with his girlfriend, Danielle Wilde.\n\nFrank tells them they are identical twin brothers and they need to join together to take down Griffith and get their part of the royalties from the tunnel, but Chad and Alex initially do not get along with each other. Alex takes them out on his boat to sell smuggled [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] and cigarettes to some Chinese buyers, but the [[Hong Kong Police]] arrive and Chad dumps the cars to escape the cops faster. Back in Hong Kong, some thugs kidnap and beat up Chad (mistaking him for Alex) when he refuses to work for their leader, Raymond Zhang. Danielle, who works for Griffith, begins checking his private files for information, but she is being watched closely by Griffith's bodyguard, Kara.\n\nAlex takes Chad and Frank to an abandoned hotel on an [[Lantau island|island]] to conduct their operations. With intelligence from Danielle, they attack a drug operation and blow it up. Next, they attack a club frequented by Zhang by pretending to bring him Cognac smuggled from France, which is actually just crates of bombs, although they fail to kill Zhang. Danielle continues to search for information but is caught and sexually molested by Kara. Danielle later calls the hideout revealing she has found something, but her phone is tapped by Griffith. Unable to find Alex and Frank who are out gathering firewood, Chad takes the boat to rescue Danielle by himself. However, Alex becomes paranoid and begins drinking heavily while imagining Chad and Danielle having sex. Chad brings Danielle home, but Kara follows them in a [[Eurocopter AS350 \u00c9cureuil|helicopter]] and discovers their hideout. When they return, Alex attacks Chad in a drunken rage before the brothers angrily part ways for the night.\n\nThe next morning Chad and Alex awaken to see Triads landing on the beach and, although they kill several, Frank and Danielle are captured. They capture one Triad who reveals that Frank and Danielle have been taken to Zhang's boat at a pier. Chad and Alex board and fight their way through the ship; Chad kills Moon (who beat him when he was kidnapped earlier) and he and Alex rescue Frank and Danielle. Afterwards, the twin brothers split up: Chad pursues Griffith and Alex chases Zhang. Alex eventually kills Zhang when he falls to his death from atop a crane. Chad and Danielle are chased through a maze of shipping containers until Griffith threatens to crush Chad with a forklift holding a container. Chad jumps into the water, sneaks around into the forklift, and drops the container on Griffith, killing him. Alex, Chad, Danielle and Frank reunite after the ordeal and appear to set aside their differences.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Alex Wagner / Chad Wagner \n** Alicia Stevenson as Baby Chad Wagner\n** Paul Aylett as Baby Alex Wagner\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Frank Avery\n* Alonna Shaw as Danielle Wilde\n* [[Alan Scarfe]] as Nigel Griffith\n* [[Philip Chan (actor)|Philip Chan]] as Raymond Zhang\n* [[Bolo Yeung]] as Moon\n* [[Corinna Everson]] as Kara\n* [[Peter Malota]] as Bodyguard With Spurs\n* Evan Lurie as Klimax Klub Bouncer\n* Andy Armstrong as Paul Wagner\n* Sarah-Jane Varley as Katherine Wagner\n* Wu Fong Lung as Chinese Nanny\n* Eugene Choy as Mr. Chen, Private Investigator\n* Kwok-Kai Ng as Mr. Nguyen, Triad Boss\n* David Lea as Karate Student\n* [[Julie Strain]] as One of Chad's Students\n* [[Shelley Michelle]] as One of Chad's Students\n* Jennifer Stone as Klimax Klub Hostess\n* Rita Lau as Hostess With Frank\n* [[John Shum|John Sham]] as a [[Hong Kong Police Force|HKPF Officer]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nVan Damme was reportedly paid $600,000 for the movie.<ref name=WallaceD>Wallace, David.

He went on to say: \"the story makes no sense and is often more laughable than exciting.\" Whilst adding that this \"probably won't deter fans,\" Hicks noted \"more gunplay here than in most Van Damme efforts, which may or may not be an improvement.\" \"Van Damme's idea of a love scene is a soft-lens, soft-core moment as he and newcomer Alonna Shaw roll around nude in a paranoid fantasy sequence. So much for romance.\"<ref name=Deseret1/>\n\nCaryn James, of ''[[The New York Times]]'' , said: \"there is plenty of gunfire and karate kicks and explosives set off by remote control. Chad gets bomped in the head more often than Alex. There are some Van Damme-style showdowns with various villains, with whirls and tricks that seem to owe something to the [[Three Stooges]]. There are golden oldies like smashing someone in the head with a whisky bottle and kicking him in the crotch. As it turns out, two Jean-Claude Van Damme's are pretty much the same as one. Fans who like their action unadultered by story, character or acting know where to find it.\"<ref name=CJames1>James, Caryn.

[This] will hurt their careers in the long run, since martial arts movies are limited by their formulas, and the heroes are supplied with almost ritualistic plot patterns.\" Ebert believed both would make \"splendid villains in more ambitious movies.\"<ref name=Ebert1>[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]].
