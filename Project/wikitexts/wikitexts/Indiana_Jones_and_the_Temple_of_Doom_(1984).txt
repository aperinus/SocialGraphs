It is the second installment in the [[Indiana Jones|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]], and a [[prequel]] to the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', featuring [[Harrison Ford]] who reprises his role as the title character. [[Kate Capshaw]], [[Amrish Puri]], [[Roshan Seth]], [[Philip Stone]], and [[Ke Huy Quan]] star in supporting roles. In the film, after arriving in [[British Raj|India]], [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a [[Thuggee]] cult practicing [[child slavery]], [[black magic]], and ritual [[human sacrifice]] in honor of the goddess [[Kali]].\n\nNot wishing to feature the [[Nazis]] as the villains again, executive producer and story writer [[George Lucas]] decided to regard this film as a prequel. Three [[plot device]]s were rejected before Lucas wrote a [[film treatment]] that resembled the final storyline. As [[Lawrence Kasdan]], Lucas's collaborator on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', turned down the offer to write the script, [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]], who had previously worked with Lucas on ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973), were hired as his replacements.\n\n''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' was released on May 23, 1984, to financial success but initial reviews were mixed, criticizing its darker elements, strong violence and gore, as well as Capshaw's performance as Willie Scott. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about ''[[Gremlins]]'', Spielberg suggested that the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) alter its [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]], which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] rating.<ref name=\"Parker\" />{{efn|name=fn1|Contrary to popular belief, ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and ''Gremlins'' were both released in the U.S. with a PG (not PG-13) rating,<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=indiana+jones+and+the+temple+of+doom&x=16&y=11 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |access-date=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG |archive-date=January 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128082721/https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=indiana+jones+and+the+temple+of+doom&x=16&y=11 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gremlins (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=GREMLINS&x=0&y=0 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |access-date=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG |archive-date=January 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127205822/https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=GREMLINS&x=0&y=0 |url-status=live }}</ref> although controversy surrounding the two films did lead to the subsequent creation of the PG-13 rating.

A sequel, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', followed in 1989.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1935, Indiana Jones survives a murder attempt by [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Lao Che|Lao Che]], a crime boss in [[Shanghai]] who has hired him to retrieve the remains of [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] [[Nurhaci]]. With his young orphaned [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Chinese]] sidekick, [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Short Round|Short Round]], and the nightclub singer, [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Willie Scott|Willie Scott]], in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on a [[cargo aircraft]], unaware that the plane is owned by Lao Che. While the three of them are asleep, the pilots dump the fuel and escape via parachute, leaving the plane to crash over the [[Himalayas]]. The three narrowly manage to survive by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft.\n\nThey ride down the mountain slopes and fall into a raging river, eventually arriving at the village of Mayapore in northern [[British Raj|India]]. The villagers plead for their aid in retrieving the [[lingam|sacred stone (shivalinga)]] stolen from their shrine, along with their missing children, by evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. Indy agrees to do so, hypothesizing that the stone is one of the five Sankara stones given by the gods to help humanity fight evil.\n\nThe trio receive a warm welcome at Pankot Palace and are allowed to stay for the night as guests, attending a lavish, but revolting, banquet hosted by the young [[Maharajah]]. The officials rebuff Indy's theory that the [[Thuggee]] cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin. After Indy kills him, he discovers a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue and sets out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps.\n\nThe trio reach an underground temple where the Thuggees worship [[Kali]] with human sacrifice. They discover that the Thuggees now possess three of the Sankara stones and have enslaved the children to search for the last two, hidden in the palace catacombs. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured. Thuggee high priest Mola Ram forces Indy to drink a potion that puts him into a trance-like state in which he mindlessly serves the cult. Willie is prepared for sacrifice, while Shorty is put to work in the mines with the other children. Shorty escapes and returns to the temple, where he first frees Indy and, later, the Maharajah from the effects of the potion by burning them with a torch. Indy saves Willie and retrieves the stones. After freeing the children, Indy fights a hulking overseer who gets killed by a rock crusher.\n\nThe trio escape from the temple in a [[mine cart|railroad cart]] through the mines, pursued by Thuggees, and barely escape Mola Ram's attempt to flood them out. They are again ambushed by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge above a crocodile-infested river. Indy cuts the bridge, causing several of the henchmen to fall to the crocodiles and leaving the survivors to hang on for their lives. As Mola Ram and Indy struggle, Indy invokes the name of [[Shiva]], causing the stones to glow red-hot and burn through Indy's satchel. Two of them fall out; Mola Ram tries to catch the third, but burns his hand and falls from the bridge and into the river, where he, too, is eaten by the crocodiles. Indy catches the stone safely and climbs up just as a company of [[British Indian Army]] riflemen, sent by the Maharajah, arrive and open fire against the Thuggees to drive them away; the surviving Thuggees are soon cornered and arrested by more soldiers. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return safely to Mayapore with the stone and the missing children.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Indiana Jones characters}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]: An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] adventurer who is asked by a desperate Indian village to retrieve a mysterious stone and rescue the missing village children.

In flight, he fell asleep and all of the other passengers on the plane bailed out and parachuted to safety, leaving him to escape alone using an inflatable raft to slide down a [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] slope to Marion's bar.

Made by [[Barbara Matera (costume designer)|Barbara Matera]] out of original 1920s and 1930s beads, the dress was one of a kind. The opening dance number was actually the last scene to be shot, but the dress did feature in some earlier location shots in Sri Lanka, drying on a nearby tree. Unfortunately an [[elephant]] had started to eat it, tearing the whole back of the dress. Consequently, some emergency repair work had to be done by Matera with what remained of the original beads, and it was [[costume design]]er [[Anthony Powell (designer)|Anthony Powell]] who had to fill in the insurance forms. As to the reason for damage, he had no option but to put \"dress eaten by elephant\".<ref name=making/>\n\nIn a 2003 documentary on the making of the film (first released when the original trilogy made its debut on DVD), costume designer Anthony Powell stated that only one evening dress was made for Capshaw due to the limited amount of original 1920s and 1930s beads and sequins (story above). However, there have been more than one of these dresses on display at the same time in different countries, so this story cannot be entirely true \u2013 from late 2014, a dress was on display at the Hollywood Costume exhibition in Los Angeles (exhibition ran from October 2, 2014 \u2013 March 2, 2015). At the very same time, the travelling \"Indiana Jones: Adventure of Archaeology\" exhibition was on display in Edmonton in Canada (October 11, 2014 \u2013 April 6, 2015) and there featured another of the red and gold dresses. It has also been confirmed by an embroiderer working at Barbara Matera Ltd. at the time, that three dresses were in fact made initially: one for Kate, one for the stunt double, and one \"just in case\".{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nProduction designer [[Norman Reynolds]] could not return for ''Temple of Doom'' because of his commitment to ''[[Return to Oz]]''.

He wrote that \"it's based on an ancient cult that existed in India and was recreated like a fantasy. If you recall those imaginary places like Pankot Palace, starting with Shanghai, where the plane breaks down and the passengers use a raft to jump over it, slide down a hill and reach India, can this ever happen? But fantasies are fantasies, like our [[Panchatantra]] and folklore. I know we are sensitive about our cultural identity, but we do this to ourselves in our own films. It's only when some foreign directors do it that we start cribbing.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Puri |first1=Amrish |title=The Act of Life of Amrish Puri: An Autobiography |date=June 18, 2013 |publisher=Stellar Publishers |page=260 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n== Impact ==\nIn response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about ''[[Gremlins]]'', Spielberg suggested that the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) alter its [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]] by introducing an intermediary between the PG and R ratings.
