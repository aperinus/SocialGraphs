Marcus, who lost his faith after the birth of his ill son, is accustomed to performing fake exorcisms on \"possessed\" individuals. He accepts an exorcism request sent by farmer Louis Sweetzer, who claims his livestock are being slaughtered by his daughter Nell; Louis suspects that Nell is possessed by [[Satan]].\n\nMarcus arrives and claims Nell is possessed by [[Abalam]], a powerful demon. He persuades the family that he has driven out the demon and leaves, believing he and his crew have cured her of a mental state that was misdiagnosed as [[Demonic possession|possession]]. That night, Nell appears in Marcus's motel room, visibly unwell. Marcus takes Nell to the hospital for tests, which conclude that she is in perfect physical condition. Marcus goes to see Louis's former pastor, Joseph Manley, who informs Marcus that he has not seen Nell for three years. In the morning, Louis takes Nell home but chains her to the bed after she cuts her brother Caleb's face with a knife.\n\nMarcus frees Nell from her restraints and later finds her trying to drown a doll while seemingly sleepwalking. When the hospital calls back to inform that Nell is pregnant, Iris accuses Louis of [[incest]], which Marcus rejects. That night, Nell steals their camera and goes into her father's barn, where she brutally smashes a cat to death. Iris and Daniel discover her morbid paintings; in addition to the death of the cat, they depict Marcus standing before a large flame with a crucifix, Iris dismembered, and Daniel decapitated. Marcus confronts Louis about Nell's pregnancy; Louis insists that Nell is a virgin and has been impregnated by the demon. Offended at Marcus's insistence that a demon is not involved, Louis demands that the crew leave and alludes to intending to kill Nell. The crew tries to escape with Nell, who attacks Marcus before Louis threatens to shoot her. Marcus offers to attempt a second exorcism to dissuade him as Nell begs Louis to kill her.\n\nDuring the exorcism, \"Abalam\" agrees to release Nell only if Marcus can remain silent for ten seconds. Each second, Nell breaks one of her fingers. After three, Marcus yells for Abalam to stop; Abalam asks Marcus if he wants a \"[[Fellatio|blowing job]]\". Marcus challenges that a demon would know the actual name of the sex act and concludes that Nell is not possessed, but a disturbed and ashamed girl. Nell anguishes over losing her virginity to a boy named Logan, which Louis again rejects. Marcus and the crew meet Logan, who explains that he is gay and the only contact he had with Nell was a brief conversation at Manley's house six months ago; the crew realizes Manley was lying about having not seen Nell. They return to the Sweetzer farmhouse, which they find empty and covered with numerous [[occult]] and [[counterculture|countercultural]] symbols on its walls.\n\nThe group follows the sound of voices into the woods, where they see a large fire and a congregation of hooded cultists led by Manley. Louis is tied up, gagged and blindfolded while hooded figures pray around an altar, atop which Nell is bound. She gives birth to an inhuman child. Manley throws the child into the fire, which causes the fire to grow rapidly as demonic roars emanate. Marcus, his faith restored, grabs his cross and rushes towards the fire to combat the evil. Iris and Daniel flee, and Iris is subdued by members of the congregation and killed with an axe. Daniel continues to run before Caleb decapitates him and the camera falls.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Patrick Fabian]] as Cotton Marcus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=14489|title=Horror Movies: Reviews, Trailers, News - Shock Till You Drop|website=ComingSoon.net|access-date=2010-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820142224/http://shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=14489|archive-date=2012-08-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Ashley Bell (actress)|Ashley Bell]] as Nell Margaret Sweetzer<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18031|title=AFM '09: First Ever Images From Eli Roth's 'Cotton'!! - Bloody Disgusting|website=Bloody-disgusting.com|date=8 November 2009}}</ref>\n* [[Iris Bahr]] as Iris Reisen<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18060|title=Hi-Res Look at Creepy Possessed Girl in Eli Roth's 'Cotton'! - Bloody Disgusting|website=Bloody-disgusting.com|date=10 November 2009}}</ref>\n* [[Louis Herthum]] as Louis Sweetzer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/11/10/first-look-first-photo-from-eli-roths-exorcism-film-cotton|title=First Look: First Photo from Eli Roth's Exorcism Film Cotton}}</ref>\n* [[Caleb Landry Jones]] as Caleb Sweetzer<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37710/trailer-debut-lionsgates-the-last-exorcism|title=New Vamps Trailer and One-Sheet Lack Bite - Dread Central|website=Dreadcentral.com|date=22 September 2012}}</ref>\n* Tony Bentley as Pastor Manley<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20195|title=Back-breaking One Sheet Debut For 'The Last Exorcism'! - Bloody Disgusting|website=Bloody-disgusting.com|date=13 May 2010}}</ref>\n* Shanna Forrestall as Mrs. Marcus<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37576/two-new-images-the-last-exorcism|title=Two New Images: The Last Exorcism - Dread Central|website=Dreadcentral.com|date=19 May 2010}}</ref>\n* Becky Fly as Becky<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38130/the-last-exorcism-goes-viral-visit-church-st-marks-online|title=New Stitches Stills and UK Trailer - Dread Central|website=Dreadcentral.com|date=5 October 2012}}</ref>\n* Denise Lee as Nurse<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20355|title=The Devil Finds New Host in 'The Last Exorcism' Trailer Debut! - Bloody Disgusting|website=Bloody-disgusting.com|date=26 May 2010}}</ref>\n* Logan Craig Reid as Logan<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20651|title=Viral Marketing Campaign Begins For 'The Last Exorcism' - Bloody Disgusting|website=Bloody-disgusting.com|date=22 June 2010}}</ref>\n* Adam Grimes as Daniel Moskowitz\n* Jamie Alyson Caudle as Satanic Worshipper<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17595|title='Cotton' to Be Shown to Sundance, Full Casting Released - Bloody Disgusting|website=Bloody-disgusting.com|date=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n* Allen Boudreaux as Satanic Worshipper<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37491/wicked-new-one-sheet-the-last-exorcism|title=Snow White and the Huntsman (Blu-ray / DVD) - Dread Central|website=Dreadcentral.com|date=17 September 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was slated to be a part of the [[South by Southwest]] Film Festival 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20264|title=Possession at Full Mass in New Hi-Res 'Last Exorcism' Images - Bloody Disgusting|website=Bloody-disgusting.com|date=18 May 2010}}</ref> On February 12, 2010, [[Lionsgate]] purchased the rights for the US distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shockya.com/news/2010/02/14/lionsgate-acquires-us-rights-for-the-last-exorcism/|title=Lionsgate Acquires US Rights for The Last Exorcism|date=14 February 2010}}</ref> and pulled the film from the festival.
