When an accident and a false accusation leads to Ben-Hur's arrest, Messala, who has become corrupt and arrogant, makes sure Ben-Hur and his family are jailed and separated.\n\nBen-Hur is sentenced to slave labor in a Roman war [[galley]]. Along the way, he unknowingly encounters [[Jesus]], the carpenter's son who offers him water. Once aboard ship, his attitude of defiance and strength impresses a Roman admiral, Quintus Arrius, who allows him to remain unchained. This actually works in the admiral's favor because when his ship is attacked and sunk by pirates, Ben-Hur saves him from drowning.\n\nArrius then treats Ben-Hur as a son, and over the years the young man grows strong and becomes a victorious [[chariot]] racer. This eventually leads to a climactic showdown with Messala in a chariot race, in which Ben-Hur is the victor. However, Messala does not die, as he does in the more famous [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|1959 adaptation]] of the novel.\n\nBen-Hur is eventually reunited with his mother and sister, who have developed [[leprosy]] but are miraculously cured by [[Jesus Christ]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfilmguide.com/indexde51.html |title=Plot Summary for Ben Hur |publisher=Classic Film Guide |access-date=January 26, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027001341/http://classicfilmguide.com/indexde51.html |archive-date=October 27, 2010}}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n==Cast==\n\n{{col-begin|width=60%}}\n{{col-break}}\n'''Main'''\n* [[Ramon Novarro]] as [[Judah Ben-Hur|Ben-Hur]]\n* [[Francis X.

In 1922, two years after the play's last tour, the Goldwyn company purchased the film rights to ''Ben-Hur''. The play's producer, Abraham Erlanger, put a heavy price on the screen rights. Erlanger was persuaded to accept a generous profit participation deal and total approval over every detail of the production.\n\nChoosing the title role was difficult for [[June Mathis]]. [[Rudolph Valentino]] and dancer [[Paul Swan (dancer)|Paul Swan]] were considered until [[George Walsh]] was chosen. When asked why she chose him, she answered it was because of his eyes and his body.

Additional recastings (including Ramon Novarro as Ben-Hur) and a change of director caused the production's budget to skyrocket. After two years of difficulties and accidents, the production was eventually moved back to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in [[Culver City, California]] and production resumed in the spring of 1925. [[B.

''Ben Hur'' went on to become MGM's highest-grossing film, with rentals of $9 million worldwide. Its foreign earnings of $5 million were not surpassed at MGM for at least 25 years.  Despite the large revenues, its huge expenses and the deal with Erlanger made it a net financial loss for MGM.
