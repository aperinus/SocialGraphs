A parody of and homage to [[science fiction film|science-fiction film]]s and [[Science fiction on television|series]], especially ''[[Star Trek]]'' and [[Trekkie|its fandom]], the film depicts the cast of a fictional cult television series, ''Galaxy Quest'', who are drawn into a real interstellar conflict by actual aliens who think the series was an accurate documentary. It stars [[Tim Allen]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Tony Shalhoub]], [[Sam Rockwell]], and [[Daryl Mitchell (actor)|Daryl Mitchell]]. The film was a modest box office success and positively received by critics: it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] and the [[Nebula Award for Best Script]]. It was also nominated for 10 [[Saturn Award]]s, including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Parisot, [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Weaver, and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Rickman, with Allen winning [[Saturn Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].<ref name=\"Hugo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2000-hugo-awards/ |title=2000 Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |access-date=April 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164748/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2000-hugo-awards/ |archive-date=May 7, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Nebula\">{{cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Nebula2001.html |title=The Locus Index to SF Awards: 2001 Nebula Awards |work=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |access-date=December 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231030/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Nebula2001.html |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''Galaxy Quest'' eventually achieved [[Cult following|cult status]], especially from ''Star Trek'' fans for its affectionate parody, but also from more mainstream audiences as a [[comedy film]] in its own right.<ref name=\"7th\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/diehard-star-trek-fans-rank-the-best-and-worst-movies|title=Diehard Star Trek Fans Rank the Best and Worst Movies|work=IGN|date=August 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Geek.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/geek-cetera/we-almost-got-galaxy-quest-2-with-the-original-cast-returning-but-1651671/|title=We almost got Galaxy Quest{{nbsp}}2 with the original cast returning, but{{nbsp}}...|work=[[Geek.com]]|access-date=July 27, 2017|archive-date=April 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401083331/https://www.geek.com/geek-cetera/we-almost-got-galaxy-quest-2-with-the-original-cast-returning-but-1651671/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"io9\">{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/33-secrets-you-probably-never-knew-about-the-making-of-1759220814|title=33 Secrets You Probably Never Knew About the Making of Galaxy Quest|publisher=io9 |access-date=July 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeveral ''Star Trek'' cast and crew members praised the film.

Though the series' conceited former star, Jason Nesmith, thrives on the attention, the other cast members\u2014Gwen, Alexander, Fred, and Tommy\u2014resent him and, to varying degrees, the states of their careers.\n\nAt a convention, Jason is approached by a group calling themselves Thermians, led by Mathesar, who request his help. Jason thinks they want him for a promotional appearance and agrees. The next morning, when the Thermians pick him up, Jason is hung over and does not grasp that the Thermians are aliens and that he has been transported to a working re-creation of the bridge of the NSEA ''Protector'', the starship from ''Galaxy Quest.'' Believing he is on a set and must perform in character, he confronts the Thermians' enemy, the evil warlord Sarris, who demands the \"Omega 13\", a secret superweapon mentioned in the final scene of the series, which has never been used and whose capabilities are unknown. Giving perfunctory orders, Jason manages to temporarily defeat Sarris.\n\nAfter the grateful Thermians transport him back to Earth, Jason realizes the experience was real. He attempts to convince the other cast members, but is rebuffed. When the Thermian Laliari appears and requests Jason's help again, the cast, thinking it is a job, join him, including their handler Guy, who played an ill-fated [[redshirt (stock character)|redshirt]] in one episode of the series. Aboard the ''Protector'', the cast learns that the Thermians, who possess no concept of fiction, believe episodes of ''Galaxy Quest'' are true \"historical documents\". Inspired by the crew's adventures, they have based their society on the virtues espoused by the show and manufactured a functioning replica of the ''Protector''.\n\nSarris returns and attacks the ''Protector'' again, and the ship barely escapes through a magnetic minefield; however, the ship's power source, a beryllium sphere, is severely damaged. The humans must travel to the surface of a nearby planet for a new sphere, which they snatch from ferocious, childlike aliens. When the humans return to the ''Protector'', they discover that Sarris has seized the ship and demands the \"Omega 13\" device. Jason confesses that he is not the commander and shows Sarris the ''Galaxy Quest'' \"historical documents\". Sarris understands they are just actors and forces Jason to explain to a disillusioned Mathesar.\n\nSarris activates the ''Protector'''s [[self-destruct]] mechanism and returns to his ship, leaving the Thermians and the cast members to die. The humans formulate a plan to abort the self-destruct and defeat Sarris' remaining troops on the ship. Jason communicates with Brandon, a ''Galaxy Quest'' superfan on Earth, and his network of friends with intimate knowledge of the show. They talk Jason and Gwen through the ship's core and help them abort the self-destruct sequence. Meanwhile, Alexander leads the Thermians against Sarris' forces and they take back control of the ''Protector''. With renewed confidence, the crew challenges Sarris and draws his ship into the magnetic minefield. This time, the ''Protector'' drags the magnetic mines into Sarris' vessel, destroying it.\n\nThe ''Protector'' approaches Earth to bring the humans home, but Sarris, who escaped his ship's destruction, ambushes them on the bridge and fatally wounds several crew members. Jason manages to activate the \"Omega 13\", which creates a 13-second time warp to the past, giving Jason and Mathesar a chance to disarm Sarris before he repeats his attack.\n\nThe ''Protector'''s bridge separates from the main vessel to land the humans on Earth, while the main section of the ship carries Mathesar and the remaining Thermians into interstellar space. Guided by Brandon and his friends acting as beacons, the ''Protector'' bridge crashes into a ''Galaxy Quest'' convention, coming to a stop on the main stage. The dazed cast emerges to the cheers of their fans, but Sarris reemerges to imperil them again. Jason shoots and destroys Sarris, and the ecstatic crowd assumes it was all a massive display of special effects. The cast basks in the adoration of Brandon, his pals, and their fans.\n\nSome time later, ''Galaxy Quest'' is revived as a sequel series, ''Galaxy Quest: The Journey Continues'', with the cast reprising their roles alongside Guy and Laliari as new cast members.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 400\n| perrow    = 3\n| footer    = The actors playing the original ''Protector'' crew on ''Galaxy Quest'', from left to right: (top) [[Tim Allen]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Alan Rickman]], (bottom) [[Tony Shalhoub]], [[Sam Rockwell]], and [[Daryl Mitchell (actor)|Daryl Mitchell]]\n| image1    = Tim Allen 2012.jpg\n| image2    = Sigourney Weaver by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| image3    = Alan Rickman cropped and retouched.jpg\n| image4    = Tony Shalhoub.jpg\n| image5    = Sam Rockwell Shankbone 2009 Tribeca.jpg\n| image6    = DarylMitchellEmmysSept09.jpg\n\n}}\n<!--Cast per closing credits order and roles, stop just before \"Fan #1\"-->\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Jason Nesmith, who played Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, the commander of the NSEA ''Protector'' and main character of the series.\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Gwen DeMarco, who played Lieutenant Tawny Madison, the ship's communications officer and the only officer aboard who can give orders to the ship's computer.\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as Alexander Dane, who played Dr. Lazarus, the ship's science officer and a member of the Mak'tar, an alien species known for their super intelligence and psionic powers.\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Fred Kwan, who played Tech Sergeant Chen, the ship's chief engineer.\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Guy Fleegman, the cast's handler at conventions, who also played a \"[[Redshirt (stock character)|redshirt]]\" (a short-lived minor character) in a single episode, simply referred to as \"Crewman #6\".

Gordon, who did not read ''Captain Starshine'' until after the film was completed, started from the premise of washed-up actors from a sci-fi series involved with real extraterrestrials.<ref name=MTV/> Gordon's initial drafts added elements of humor to Howard's script, such as the ''Protector'' scraping the walls of the space dock when Laredo pilots the real ship for the first time. Gordon became more confident in his script when he completed the scene where Nesmith confesses to the Thermians, which he felt he nailed.<ref name=MTV/> He submitted his first draft to DreamWorks in 1998, and it was immediately greenlit.<ref name=MTV/>\n\nMark Johnson wanted [[Dean Parisot]] to direct; Parisot had directed another film Johnson produced, ''[[Home Fries (film)|Home Fries]]''. However, DreamWorks favored [[Harold Ramis]] because of his prior experience, and hired him in November 1998.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Fleming |title=Ramis preps for blastoff on 'Galaxy Quest' |url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/ramis-preps-for-blastoff-on-galaxy-quest-1117488013/ |work=Variety |date=November 1, 1998 |access-date=January 23, 2016}}</ref> Ramis wanted [[Alec Baldwin]] for the lead role, but Baldwin turned it down. [[Steve Martin]] and [[Kevin Kline]] were also considered, but Kline turned it down for family reasons. Ramis did not agree with the casting of Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith, and left the project in February 1999. Parisot took over as director within three weeks.<ref name=MTV /> Allen said that the version of the film pitched to him by Ramis and Katzenberg felt more like ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and that they wanted an action star to do comedy, rather than a comedian to do an action film.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\">{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dreamworks-screwed-up-why-galaxy-quest-wasnt-a-bigger-hit-1264866| title = DreamWorks \"Screwed Up\": Why Cult Classic 'Galaxy Quest' Wasn't a Bigger Hit | first = Byron | last =Burton | date = December 24, 2019 | access-date = December 30, 2019 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> Sigourney Weaver, who had previously worked with Ramis on ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', said that he also wanted actors who had not appeared in science fiction roles before, a choice she thought odd since veterans of the genre would know what was humorous.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> After seeing the film, Ramis said he was ultimately impressed with Allen's performance.<ref name=MTV />\n\n=== Casting ===\nFollowing Parisot's assignment as director, Allen was quickly cast as Nesmith,<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> and had to choose between ''Galaxy Quest'' and ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]''. The ''Bicentennial Man'' role went to [[Robin Williams]].<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/><ref name=\"io9\"/> Allen said he was a big sci-fi fan and had hoped the role would launch a second part of his career as a sci-fi actor.<ref name=\"io9\"/><ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> Some of Allen's sci-fi knowledge was put to use during production: for example, when the crew is about to land on an alien planet, Allen brought up the issue of a breathable atmosphere with Johnson and Parisot; this became dialogue for Fleegman and Kwan in the movie.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> About his role, Allen said he based his performance more on [[Yul Brynner]]'s [[Ramesses II]] from the 1956 ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', and less on [[William Shatner]] as [[James T. Kirk|Captain James Kirk]] from ''Star Trek''.<ref name=\"io9\"/>\n\n[[Alan Rickman]] was selected to be Alexander Dane, who played the alien Dr. Lazarus. Rickman had been interested in the part not so much for the sci-fi elements, but because of the humor. He said \"I love comedy almost more than anything. This really is one of the funniest scripts I've read,\" and that \"actors are probably the only professionals who send themselves up. We actually have a sense of humor about ourselves.\"<ref name=\"starlog 2000\">{{cite magazine | title = Galaxy Quest | first = Bill |last = Warren | date = January 2000 | magazine = [[Starlog]] }}</ref> While the original script made Dane a [[Order of the British Empire|ceremonial knight]], Rickman suggested the title would be too much for the character, and this was dropped, though he remained listed as \"Sir Alex Dane\" in the credits.<ref name=\"io9\"/><ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/> Rickman also provided input into the [[prosthetic]] piece that Dane would use to play Lazarus, saying \"it was important for it to be good enough to convince the aliens who believe we're the real thing, but also cheesy enough to imagine that it was something he applied himself\".<ref name=\"io9\"/> Rickman's sense of drama came into play during initial reads and script revisions. Rockwell said that Rickman \"was very instrumental in making sure the script hit the dramatic notes, and everything had a strong logic and reason behind it\".<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> The scene where Dane, as Dr. Lazarus, gives a final, powerfully emotional speech to Quellek, played by [[Patrick Breen]], utilized Rickman's sense of drama, according to Rockwell.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> Rickman was initially annoyed with Allen's excitement over his role,<ref name=\"io9\"/> but eventually the whole cast bonded over the film.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> Dr. Lazarus' catchphrase, \"By Grabthar's Hammer\", was written as a temp line in Gordon's script; Gordon planned to replace \"Grabthar\" with something less comical, but the line stuck as the production crew started using it around their offices and had it printed on t-shirts.<ref name=\"MTV\"/>\n\nWeaver had loved the script since her first read when Ramis was the director, stating \"that great sort of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' story of these people feeling so incomplete in the beginning, and then during the course of this adventure, they come out almost like the heroes they pretended to be in the first place\".<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/> She particularly loved the part of Madison: \"to me she was what a lot of women feel like, including myself, in a Hollywood situation.\"<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> In addition, she had long wanted to work with both Allen and Rickman.<ref name=\"io9\"/> Once Parisot replaced Ramis, Weaver lobbied Parisot to cast her, insisting that Madison needed to be blonde and have large breasts to capture the humor of a sci-fi production.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> She admitted she was surprised when she actually got the role.<ref name=\"io9\"/> Weaver said that this role, given some of her personal insecurities, was closer to \"telling the truth about myself and science fiction\" compared to her performance as Ripley in the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' films.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> She wore a blonde wig (which she kept after production) and an enhanced bosom, which many of the crew said gave Weaver a totally new personality. Weaver often left the set in costume and returned to her hotel to admire herself,  saying that she \"loved being a starlet\".<ref name=\"MTV\"/>\n\n[[Tony Shalhoub]] originally auditioned for Guy Fleegman until [[Sam Rockwell]] won the role. Shalhoub was then cast as Fred Kwan instead.<ref name=\"io9\"/> Shalhoub and Parisot worked together to develop the Kwan character, loosely basing him on [[David Carradine]], who was a non-Asian in an Asian role in the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' television series. There had been an urban legend that Carradine frequently acted in his show while [[Substance intoxication|under the influence of drugs]]. While Shalhoub could not directly portray a \"stoner\" in a PG-13 film, he subtly used that direction, which Rockwell described as a \"failed Scientologist\".<ref name=MTV /> Shalhoub insisted that Kwan should always be shown eating to reference the stoner stereotype.<ref name=MTV />\n\nRockwell, who wanted to develop a more serious dramatic acting career, initially considered declining the role after he was cast. He eventually recognized that several successful dramatic actors had done comedy roles early on, and Rockwell's friend [[Kevin Spacey]] convinced him to take the part.<ref name=MTV /><ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> He was the last of the main actors to be cast.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> Rockwell fashioned Fleegman after cowardly characters from other films, such as [[John Turturro]]'s Bernie in ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'', [[Bill Paxton]]'s Private Hudson in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', and [[Michael Keaton]]'s \"Blaze\" in ''[[Night Shift (1982 film)|Night Shift]]''. Rockwell drank a lot of coffee before certain scenes to help create the over-excitement and jitters associated with the character.<ref name=MTV /> Rockwell's character's name, Guy Fleegman, is a homage to Guy Vardaman, a little-known actor who worked extensively on ''Star Trek'' either as a [[stand-in]] or in bit roles.<ref name=\"io9\"/> Rockwell and Shalhoub improvised some dialog to contrast Fleegman as an alarmist while Kwan was always nonchalant.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/>\n\n[[Daryl Mitchell (actor)|Daryl Mitchell]] had worked with Parisot on ''Home Fries'', and Parisot felt he was the perfect choice to play Webber.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> [[David Alan Grier]] was the second choice for Webber.<ref name=MTV />\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 300\n| perrow    = 2\n| footer    = ''Galaxy Quest'' was the feature-film debut for both [[Justin Long]] (left) and [[Rainn Wilson]].\n| image1    = Justin Long2.jpg\n| image2    = Rainn Wilson 2011 Shankbone.JPG\n}}\n\n[[Justin Long]] was cast as Brandon, and it was Long's first feature-film role.<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/> Long had just completed a pilot for a television show under casting director Bonnie Zane, who suggested Long to her sister [[Debra Zane]], the casting director for ''Galaxy Quest''.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> Long said he was nervous auditioning as an unknown actor at the time, competing against [[Kieran Culkin]], [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] and [[Tom Everett Scott]].<ref name=\"MentalFloss\"/> Parisot had given Long a copy of ''[[Trekkies (film)|Trekkies]]'', a film about the ''Star Trek'' fandom, to help prepare for the character.<ref name=\"thr dec2019\"/> Long based his character on a combination of [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]'s Scotty J. from ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and the [[Comic Book Guy]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref name=MTV />    [[Paul Rudd]] auditioned for a role.<ref name=MTV />\n\nOne of the first \"Thermians\" to audition was [[Enrico Colantoni]].

J. Abrams]] cast of ''Star Trek''.\" To that end, Scheer's initial scripts called for two separate cast sets that would come together by the end of the first season of the show, though he did not confirm if this included any of the original film's cast.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.slashfilm.com/galaxy-quest-tv-show/ | title = 'Galaxy Quest' TV Show Continues the Story of the Original Cast, Will Address How Fandom Has Changed | first = Ben | last = Pearson | date = November 14, 2017 | access-date = February 19, 2018 | work = [[/Film]] }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Amy Powell as president of Paramount Television in July 2018, Scheer said the ''Galaxy Quest'' series had been put on hold while Paramount's management was being re-established, but anticipated the show would continue forward after that.

The script had been near completion for production by 2016 but with Rickman's death, it would have to undergo major rewrites as the core story focused on the relationship between Nesmith and Dane (Allen and Rickman's characters, respectively). A central plot element was to have the ''Protector'' and its crew affected by [[time dilation]] during space flight, which Allen considered a boon for the uncertain production of the film. While Allen said there were no immediate efforts for the sequel's production, he and the other cast and crew keep circulating the idea and believe it would be easy to restart the effort.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://ew.com/movies/galaxy-quest-2-tim-allen/ | title=Tim Allen gives a Galaxy Quest 2 update: 'It's a fabulous script' | first= James | last = Hibberd | date = January 15, 2021 | access-date = January 15, 2021 | magazine = [[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Georgia Pritchett]] stated in a June 2021 interview that she and [[Simon Pegg]] were working on developing a ''Galaxy Quest'' television series.<ref>{{cite news | last=Maxwell | first=Dominic | date=June 25, 2021 | title=Georgia Pritchett: 'In Succession we take powerful people, dig deep and find their humanity' | work=[[The Times (London)|The Times]] | pages=T2\u20136, 7 | url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/georgia-pritchett-in-succession-we-take-powerful-people-dig-deep-and-find-their-humanity-jkg837qv9 | access-date=June 30, 2021 }}</ref>\n\n=== Documentary ===\n''Never Surrender: A Galaxy Quest Documentary'' was produced by the web site [[Wikia|Fandom]] in 2019 to celebrate the film's 20th anniversary.
