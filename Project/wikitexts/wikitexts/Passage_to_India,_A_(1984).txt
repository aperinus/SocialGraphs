The screenplay is based on the 1960 [[A Passage to India (play)|play of the same name]] by [[Santha Rama Rau]], which was in turn based on the [[A Passage to India|1924 novel of the same name]] by [[E. M. Forster]].\n\nSet in the 1920s during the period of the [[British Raj]], the film tells the story of the interactions of several characters in the fictional city of Chandrapore, namely Dr Aziz, Mrs Moore, Adela Quested, and Richard Fielding. When newcomer to India, Adela, accuses Aziz of an attempted rape within the famed Marabar Caves, the city is split between the British elite and the native underclass as the budding friendship between Aziz and Fielding is tested. The film explores themes of racism, imperialism, religion, and the nature of relationships both friendly and marital.\n\nThis was the final film of Lean's prestigious career, and the first feature film he had directed in fourteen years, since ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'' in 1970. Receiving praise as Lean's finest since ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''A Passage to India'' received eleven nominations at the [[57th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Lean, and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for [[Judy Davis]] for her portrayal as Adela Quested. [[Peggy Ashcroft]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her portrayal as Mrs Moore, making her, at 77, the oldest actress to win the award, and [[Maurice Jarre]] won his third Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nAdela Quested is sailing from England to [[British Raj]] India with Mrs. Moore, the mother of Quested\u2019s intended bridegroom, Ronny Heaslop, Mrs. Moore's son from her first marriage. Heaslop is the City [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|magistrate]] in Chandrapore, the anglicized spelling of Chandrapur. Adela intends to see if she can make a go of it.\n\nThe ladies are disappointed to find that the British community is very much separated from the Indian population and culture with a growing [[Indian independence movement]] in the 1920s. They are encouraged when the local [[school superintendent]] Richard Fielding, introduces them to the eccentric elderly [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]] scholar Professor Narayan Godbole. Mrs. Moore meets by chance another Indian local, Dr Aziz Ahmed, a widower who is surprised by her kindness and lack of prejudice. Aziz offers to host an excursion to the local [[Marabar Caves]].\n\nThe initial exploration of the caves shows that the size of the party should be limited when Mrs. Moore suffers from claustrophobia and the noise from the large entourage echoes exponentially inside the caves. Mrs. Moore encourages Adela and Aziz to continue their exploration of the caves alone with just one guide.\n\nThey reach the caves at a higher elevation some distance from the group and, before entering, Aziz steps away to smoke a cigarette. He returns to find Adela has disappeared. Shortly afterwards, he sees her running headlong down the hill, disheveled. She is picked up by the doctor's wife, Mrs. Callendar, and taken to the Callendars' home. Adela is bleeding and delirious. Dr. Callendar medicates Adela with a hypodermic syringe.\n\nUpon his return to Chandrapore, Dr. Aziz is accused of attempting to rape Adela inside the caves, is jailed awaiting trial, and the incident becomes a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]''. Mrs. Moore firmly believes Aziz did not commit any offence and departs India for England. Seemingly enjoying her passage at sea, Mrs. Moore suddenly suffers an apparent heart attack and dies.\n\nIn court, Adela is questioned by the prosecutor, who is stunned when Adela replies that Dr. Aziz never entered the cave, where the supposed attempt took place. It becomes clear to Adela that her earlier signed accusation of attempted rape was false, so she recants. Aziz is freed and celebrated for his innocence. Adela is abandoned to her own devices by the British, except for Mr. Fielding, who assists her to safety at the college. She plans to return to England at the earliest moment. Aziz [[Non-cooperation movement|rids himself of his western associations]] and vows to find a new job in another Indian state; he opens a clinic in the [[Dal Lake|lake area near Srinagar]], [[Kashmir]].\n\nMeanwhile, through Adela, Fielding has married Stella Moore, Mrs. Moore's daughter from her second marriage. Aziz eventually reconciles with Fielding, and Aziz writes to Adela asking her to forgive him for taking so long to come to appreciate the courage she exercised when she withdrew her accusation in court.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Judy Davis]] as Adela Quested\n*[[Peggy Ashcroft]] as Mrs. Moore\n*[[Victor Banerjee]] as Dr. Aziz Ahmed\n*[[James Fox]] as Richard Fielding\n*[[Alec Guinness]] as Professor Narayan Godbole\n*[[Nigel Havers]] as Ronny Heaslop\n*[[Michael Culver]] as Major McBryde\n*[[Clive Swift]] as Major Callendar\n*[[Art Malik]] as Ali\n*[[Saeed Jaffrey]] as Advocate Hamidullah\n*[[Ann Firbank]] as Mrs. Callendar\n*[[Roshan Seth]] as Advocate Amrit Rao\n*[[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] as Collector Turton\n*Antonia Pemberton as Mrs. Turton\n*Sandra Hotz as Stella\n*H.S.

Forster]] began writing  ''[[A Passage to India]]''  during a stay in India from late 1912 to early 1913 (he was drawn there by a young Indian Muslim, Syed Ross Masood, whom he had tutored in Latin), completing it only after he returned to India as secretary to a maharajah in 1921. The novel was published on 6 June 1924.<ref name=\" Phillips 405\">Phillips, ''Beyond The Epic '', p.405</ref> It differs from Forster's other major works in the overt political content, as opposed to the lighter tone and more subdued political subtext in works such as ''[[Howards End]]'' and ''[[A Room With a View]]''.\n\n''A Passage to India'' deals with the delicate balance between the English and the Indians during the [[British Raj]].<ref name=\" Phillips 406\">Phillips, ''Beyond the Epic '', p.406</ref> The question of what actually happened in the caves remains unanswered in the novel. ''A Passage to India'' sold well and was widely praised in literary circles. It is generally regarded as Forster's best novel, quickly becoming a classic of [[English literature]].<ref name=\" Phillips 403\">Phillips, ''Beyond the Epic '', p.403</ref>\n\nOver many years several film directors were interested in adapting the novel to the big screen, but Forster, who was criticised when the novel was published, rejected every offer for the film rights, believing that any film of his novel would be a travesty. He feared that whoever made it would come down on the side of the English or the Indians, and he wanted balance. However he did allow Indian author [[Santha Rama Rau]] to adapt it for the theatre in 1957.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WX2wCwAAQBAJ&q=comedy+theatre+a+passage+to+india+1960&pg=PA132|title=E. M. Forster|first=J. H.|last=Stape|date=18 December 1992|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349128501|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n[[David Lean]] had read the novel and saw the play in London in 1960, and, impressed, attempted to purchase the rights at that time, but Forster, who rejected Santha Rama Rau's suggestion to allow Indian film director [[Satyajit Ray]] to make a film, said no.<ref name=\" Phillips 407\">Phillips, ''Beyond the Epic '', p.407</ref>\n\nFollowing Forster's death in 1970, the governing board of fellows of King's College at Cambridge inherited the rights to his books. However, Donald Parry, his executor, turned down all approaches, including those of [[Joseph Losey]], [[Ismail Merchant]] and [[James Ivory (director)|James Ivory]], and [[Waris Hussein]], who after adapting Santha Rama Rau's play for the BBC in the 1960s now wanted to make a feature film. Ten years later, when Professor [[Bernard Williams]], a film enthusiast, became chief executor, the rights for a film adaptation became available.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n===Development===\nProducer [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|John Brabourne]], also known as John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne, whose father had been [[Governor of Bombay]] and later [[Governor of Bengal]], and who was married to the daughter of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]], the last viceroy, had sought the film rights for twenty years.<ref name=\" Phillips 407\"/> He and his business partner, [[Richard Goodwin (producer)|Richard Goodwin]], had produced [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1968) and films based on [[Agatha Christie]]'s mysteries, including the 1974 ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]].'' In March 1981, Brabourne and Goodwin obtained the rights to make a film adaptation of ''A Passage to India''.<ref name=\" Phillips 407\"/> The contract stipulated that Santha Rama Rau write the screenplay and it reserved the right to approve the director.\n\n\"Forster gave us a verbal go-ahead\", remembered Goodwin later, \"but my partner (John Brabourne) and I never got it in writing. So it was another 10 years before the Forster estate arranged the sale of film rights\".<ref name=\"times\"/> [[Lindsay Anderson]] later claimed he turned down a chance to direct the film of the novel.<ref>LINDSAY ANDERSON BREWS SOME CHAOS\nNew York Times17 Jan 1982: A.19.</ref>\n\nBrabourne, an admirer of the film ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', wanted David Lean to direct the film. Lean was ready to break his 14-year hiatus from filmmaking following mostly negative reviews received for ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'' in 1970. Since then, Lean had fought to make a two-part epic telling the true story of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]], for which he could not obtain financing (the budget was an estimated $50 million), and had given some thought about doing a film adaptation of ''[[Out of Africa]]'', from the book by [[Isak Dinesen]], which [[Sydney Pollack]] ultimately directed in 1985. By September 1981, Lean was approved as director and Santha Rama Rau completed a draft of the script.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nThe contract stipulated that Santha Rama Rau would write the screenplay. She had met with E. M. Forster, had successfully adapted ''A Passage to India'' as a play, and had been charged by the author with preserving the spirit of the novel. However, Lean was determined to exercise input in the writing process. He met with Rau in [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire]], and over ten days they talked about the novel and discussed the script.\n\nThe initial script pleased neither the producer, John Brabourne, nor Lean. They considered it too worldly and literary, the work of a playwright, and unsuitable for a film. Most of the scenes took place indoors and in offices while Lean had in mind to film outdoors as much as possible. With India in the title of the film, he reasoned, audiences would expect to see many scenes filmed of the Indian landscape. Lean commented: \"We are blessed with a fine movie title, ''A Passage to India''. But it has built in danger; it holds out such a promise. The very mention of India conjures up high expectations. It has sweep and size and is very romantic\". Lean did not want to present a poor man's pre-independence India when for the same amount of money he could show the country's visual richness.\n\nDuring 1982, Lean worked on the script. He spent six months in New Delhi, to have a close feeling for the country while writing. As he could not stay longer for tax reasons, he then moved to Zurich for three months, finishing it there.  Following the same method he had employed adapting [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'', he went through Rau's original script and his copy of the novel, picking out the episodes that were indispensable and passing over those that did not advance the plot. Lean typed out the whole screenplay himself, correcting it as he went along, following the principle that scripts are not written, but rewritten.\n\n===Casting===\nThe director cast Australian actress [[Judy Davis]], then 28, as the naive Miss Quested after a two-hour meeting. When Davis gave her interpretation of what happened in the caves \u2014 \"She can\u2019t cope with her own sexuality, she just freaks out\" \u2014 Lean said that the part was hers. Davis had garnered international attention in [[Gillian Armstrong]]'s ''[[My Brilliant Career (film)|My Brilliant Career]]'' (1979) and had appeared in ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'' (1982) as a young [[Golda Meir]].\n\nLean wanted [[Celia Johnson]], star of ''[[Brief Encounter]]'', to play Mrs Moore, but she turned down the part and died before the film was released. The director then offered the part to [[Peggy Ashcroft]], a stage actress who had appeared in films only sporadically. She was not enthusiastic when Lean asked her to be Mrs Moore. \"Mr Lean, I\u2019m 75 years old\", she protested. \"So am I\", he replied. Although she had recently worked in India on the TV miniseries ''[[The Jewel in the Crown (TV series)|The Jewel in the Crown]]'', she said, \"I thought, 'Oh dear, I really don\u2019t want to do it', but it's very difficult to turn down a Lean film\".\n\n[[Satyajit Ray]], who had hoped to direct his adaptation of ''A Passage to India'', recommended 38-year-old Bengali actor [[Victor Banerjee]] for the role of Dr Aziz. The character required a combination of foolishness, bravery, honour and anger. After some hesitation, Lean cast Banerjee, but the director had to overcome the restrictions of British equity to employ an Indian actor. Lean got his way, and the casting made headlines in India. \"It was a matter of national pride that an Indian was cast instead of an Asian from England\" observed Banerjee.\n\n[[Peter O'Toole]] was Lean's first choice to play Fielding. The role eventually went to [[James Fox]]. Despite having quarrelled with Lean in the 1960s about a proposed film about Gandhi that ultimately was scrapped, [[Alec Guinness]] agreed to portray Professor Godbole. The relationship between the two men deteriorated during filming, and when Guinness learned that much of his performance was left on the cutting room floor due to time constraints, he saw it as a personal affront. Guinness would not speak to Lean for years afterwards, patching things up only in the last years of Lean's life.<ref>Read, Piers Paul, ''Alec Guinness: The Authorized Biography''.</ref> [[Nigel Hawthorne]] was cast as Turton but fell ill and was replaced on-set by [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]].\n\n===Financing===\nFinancing the film was difficult. EMI provided some initial money, but Lean paid his own expenses scouting locations and writing the screenplay. Eventually the budget was raised from EMI, Columbia and HBO.<ref name=\"los\">LEAN'S 14-YEAR PASSAGE TO LOVE\nMann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 10 April 1983: w21.</ref>\n\nIn December 1984, Thorn EMI offered investors the chance to invest in several films by issuing \u00a336&nbsp;million worth of shares. The films were ''A Passage to India'' (1984), ''[[Morons from Outer Space]]'', ''[[Dreamchild]]'', ''[[Wild Geese II]]'' and ''[[The Holcroft Covenant (film)|The Holcroft Covenant]]''<ref>Walker 1985 p286</ref> (all 1985).<ref>Producer splits cost of films The Guardian 10 January 1985: 4.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place from November 1983 to June 1984.\n\nThe [[Marabar Caves]] are based on the [[Barabar Caves]], some 35&nbsp;km north of [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], in [[Bihar]]. Lean visited the caves during pre-production, and found them flat and unattractive; concerns about bandits were also prevalent. Instead he used the hills of [[Savandurga]] and Ramadevarabetta some tens of kilometers from [[Bangalore]], where much of the principal filming took place; small cave entrances were carved out by the production company.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Makins|first=Tim|date=3 August 2007|title=The Marabar Caves - page 1|url=https://www.mapability.com/travel/p2i/marabar.php|access-date=17 October 2020|website=A Passage To India}}</ref> Other scenes were filmed in [[Ramanagaram]] ([[Karnataka]]) and [[Udhagamandalam]] ([[Tamil Nadu]]) and in [[Srinagar]] ([[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]]). Some interiors were shot at [[Shepperton Studios]] in Surrey and in [[Bangalore Palace]].\n\n===Music===\nThe film's score was composed by longtime Lean collaborator Maurice Jarre. According to Jarre, the director told him, \"Maurice, I want you to write music right from your groin for this very long scene in the cave. This isn't a story of India, it's a story of a woman. I want you to write music that evokes awakening sexuality\".<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\nJarre wrote 45 minutes of music in two and a half weeks. He said, \"David talks to me in images. A film artist never asks for an oboe to cover up a bad scene; a film artist doesn't think of music as medicine for a sick movie. David talks to me as he would talk to an actor.\"<ref name=\"times\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nLean's final film opened to tremendous praise worldwide, and became a critics' favourite of 1984.\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"[Lean's] best work since ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' and perhaps his most humane and moving film since ''[[Brief Encounter]]''. Though vast in physical scale and set against a tumultuous Indian background, it is also intimate, funny and moving in the manner of a film maker completely in control of his material \u2026 Though [Lean] has made ''A Passage to India'' both less mysterious and more cryptic than the book, the film remains a wonderfully provocative tale, full of vivid characters, all played to near perfection.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Canby|first=Vincent|date=14 December 1984|title=The Screen: 'Passage to India,' by David Lean|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/14/movies/the-screen-passage-to-india-by-david-lean.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524153542/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/14/movies/the-screen-passage-to-india-by-david-lean.html|archive-date=24 May 2015|access-date=21 August 2019|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' observed that \"Forster's novel is one of the literary landmarks of this century, and now David Lean has made it into one of the greatest screen adaptations I have ever seen \u2026 [He] is a meticulous craftsman, famous for going to any length to make every shot look just the way he thinks it should.

While adhering to perhaps 80 per cent of the book's incident, Lean veers very wide of the mark over E.M. Forster's hatred of the British presence in India, and comes down much more heavily on the side of the British. But he has assembled his strongest cast in years \u2026 And once again Lean indulges his taste for scenery, demonstrating an ability with sheer scale which has virtually eluded British cinema throughout its history. Not for literary purists, but if you like your entertainment well tailored, then feel the quality and the width.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Passage to India 1984, directed by David Lean &#124; Film review|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/a-passage-to-india|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311004704/http://www.timeout.com/london/film/a-passage-to-india|archive-date=11 March 2016|access-date=21 August 2019|website=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Channel 4]] said, \"Lean was always preoccupied with landscapes and obsessed with the perfect shot \u2013 but here his canvas is way smaller than in ''Lawrence of Arabia'', for instance \u2026 Still, while the storytelling is rather toothless, ''A Passage to India'' is certainly well worth watching for fans of the director's epic style.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Passage to India Movie Review (1984) from Channel 4 Film|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=106941&section=review|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807235850/http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=106941|archive-date=7 August 2007|access-date=12 March 2009|website=[[Channel 4]]}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''A Passage to India'' holds a rating of 77% from 26 critics, with an average rating of 7.20/10.
