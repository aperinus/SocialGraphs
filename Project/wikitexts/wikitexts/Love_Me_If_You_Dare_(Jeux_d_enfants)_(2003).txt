It stars [[Guillaume Canet]] and  [[Marion Cotillard]] as best friends Julien Janvier and Sophie Kowalsky who begin playing a [[game of dares]] as children and find themselves unable to stop as they grow older, even when the game threatens to destroy their lives.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins where a little girl, Sophie, is being bullied by other children. Only a bus driver and a boy, Julien, help her collect her books that the others have thrown into a puddle.\n\nTo cheer Sophie up, Julien gives her a small tin box, a gift from his fatally ill mother. Because it is important to him, he asks her to lend it back to him from time to time. As Julien wants the box back at the moment he gave it to her, Sophie demands proof of how important it is to him. Julien disengages the handbrake of the bus without hesitation, and the bus full of children rolls down a hill. Their game has begun: the box changes its owner after each completed dare.\n\nBetween the son of wealthy Belgian parents and the daughter of poor Polish immigrants a lasting friendship develops. As children, they misbehave in school, wreak havoc on a wedding, and request silly tasks of each other.  As teenagers, their romantic relationships with others suffer as a result of their dares. Meanwhile, the two friends ignore any consequences or punishment during their game.\n\nWhile they are always looking for the next kick, a love is slowly evolving between the protagonists. Not wanting to admit it, they divert their attention from it by even more extreme dares.\n\nAs young adults, Julien tells Sophie that he wants to get married, only later revealing that he means to someone else.  The climax is reached when Sophie interrupts Julien's wedding, after which he is cast out by his father and Sophie is nearly killed during another game. Julien returns to marry his wife, and Sophie declares that they will not see each other for ten years.\n\nTen years pass, and Julien is married with two children.  Sophie has also married her husband, a famous soccer star. A successful Julien admits that he has not forgotten Sophie, though he assumes that she has forgotten him.  On the night of Julien's tenth wedding anniversary, Sophie sends a message to him, indicating that the game is back on.  Julien and Sophie meet for a brief moment in the midst of another dare, yet it is enough to remind Julien that their game is \"better than life itself.\"  After a dramatic accident, Julien and Sophie finally reunite, despite the protestations of their spouses.\n\nThe film has two [[alternate ending]]s, which are shown consecutively. In the first, Julien and Sophie decide as an ultimate dare to finally share their dream together, their \"dream of an eternal love\" \u2013 the pair embrace while they stand in a construction pit that is about to be filled with concrete. The couple kiss as they are pulled beneath the cement, and both drown in the sludge. The other ending has the now aged Julien and Sophie spending time together in a garden and carrying on playing their game with milder dares. However, the opening scene of the film (an overhead view of a building site and a pit filled with concrete in which the upper side Julien's tin box rests partially sunk) replays, suggesting that the two friends actually did bury themselves and drown beneath the concrete.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Guillaume Canet]] &ndash; Julien Janvier\n**[[Thibault Verhaeghe]] &ndash; 8 year old Julien\n**[[Robert Willar]] &ndash; 80-year-old Julien\n*[[Marion Cotillard]] &ndash; Sophie Kowalsky\n**[[Jos\u00e9phine Lebas-Joly]] &ndash; 8 year old Sophie\n**[[Nathalie Nattier]] &ndash; 80-year-old Sophie\n*[[G\u00e9rard Watkins]] &ndash; Julien's father\n*[[Gilles Lellouche]] &ndash; Sergei Nimov Nimovitch\n*[[Emmanuelle Gr\u00f6nvold]] &ndash; Julien's mother\n*[[Julia Faure]] &ndash; Sophie's sister\n*[[Laetizia Venezia]] &ndash; Christelle Louise Bouchard\n*[[\u00c9lodie Navarre]] &ndash; Aur\u00e9lie Miller\n*[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Geerts]] &ndash; Igor\n*[[Manuela Sanchez]] &ndash; Teacher\n*[[Philippe Drecq]] &ndash; School headmaster\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Jeux d'enfants\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Phillippe Rombi]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{start date|2003|09|9}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Universal International|Universal Music Group]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = Music from the Movies\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4|4}} [http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=1923 link]\n| noprose = yes\n}}\n\nThe song \"[[La Vie en Rose]]\" permeates the film and dominates much of the soundtrack. Several distinct versions are used, including the [[\u00c9dith Piaf]] original, covers by [[Donna Summer]], [[Louis Armstrong]], the Brazilian [[A cappella]] group Trio Esperan\u00e7a, and French pop artist [[Zazie]], as well as a handful of instrumental cuts. Coincidentally, Marion Cotillard went on to win an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for her portrayal of Piaf in the film ''[[La Vie en Rose (film)|La Vie en Rose]]'', also called ''[[La M\u00f4me]]''. Additionally, Cotillard was subsequently cast in ''[[Inception]]'', a science-fiction thriller where Piaf's song, \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" plays a key role.\n\nA piano arrangement, Ouverture by Philippe Rombi, can also be heard throughout the film.\n\n===Track listing===\n#Ouverture \u2013 5:05\n#Love Theme \u2013 2:29\n#Solitude / L'Escalier du Temps \u2013 2:22\n#Beethov' Fantaisie / Cap Ou Pas Cap? \u2013 1:22\n#Jeux d'enfants \u2013 2:12\n#Les Lunettes Magiques \u2013 1:51\n#Derniers Instants \u2013 2:41\n#Premier Baiser \u2013 2:20\n#Declaration / Separation \u2013 2:30\n#Invitation \u2013 5:15\n#[[La Vie en Rose]] (Trio Esperan\u00e7a) \u2013 2:33\n#10 Ans Plus Tard \u2013 2:23\n#Mieux Que La Vie (Poursuite) \u2013 2:23\n#La Vie en Rose ([[Donna Summer]]) \u2013 4:56\n#Le Meilleur et le Pire \u2013 1:49\n#Sous la Pluie \u2013 3:30\n#Pour Toujours (Love Theme) \u2013 1:49\n#La Vie en Rose ([[Louis Armstrong]])-3:24\n#La Vie en Rose ([[Zazie]]) \u2013 3:54\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from North American critics.
