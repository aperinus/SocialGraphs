The [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|26th Disney animated feature film]], the film was directed by [[John Musker]], [[Ron Clements]], Dave Michener, and [[Burny Mattinson]] (in their feature directorial debuts). The main characters are all [[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]]s living in [[19th-century London|Victorian London]].\n\nBased on the children's book series ''[[Basil of Baker Street]]'' by [[Eve Titus]] and [[Paul Galdone]], it draws heavily on the tradition of [[Sherlock Holmes]] with a heroic mouse who consciously emulates the detective. Titus named the main character after actor [[Basil Rathbone]], who is best remembered for [[Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes#Film|playing Holmes in film]] (and whose voice, sampled from a 1966 reading of \"[[The Red-Headed League]]\"<ref name=\"usatoday\" /> was the voice of Holmes in this film, 19 years after his death). Sherlock Holmes also mentions \"Basil\" as one of his aliases in the [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] story \"[[The Adventure of Black Peter]]\".\n\n''The Great Mouse Detective'' was released to theaters on July 2, 1986, to positive reviews and financial success, in sharp contrast to the box office underperformance of Disney's previous animated feature film, ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' (1985).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 693 words. -->\nIn London in June 1897, a young mouse named Olivia Flaversham is celebrating her birthday with her widowed [[wikt:toymaker|toymaker]] father, Hiram. Suddenly, a bat with a crippled wing and a [[peg leg]] burst into Flaversham's workshop, kidnapping Mr. Flaversham. Olivia searches to find the famed Great Mouse Detective named Basil of Baker Street but gets lost. A surgeon named Dr. David Q. Dawson, who has just returned from a lengthy service of the Mouse Queen's 66th Regiment in Afghanistan, meets Olivia and escorts her to Basil's residence. Upon their arrival, Basil is initially indifferent, but when Olivia mentions the bat that abducted her father, Basil realizes that Olivia saw Fidget, the assistant of Professor Ratigan, a villain that Basil has attempted to arrest for years. It is then revealed that Ratigan kidnapped Hiram to create a [[clockwork]] [[robot]], which mimics the Queen of the Mice so that Ratigan can rule England. Flaversham initially refuses to participate in the scheme but capitulates when Ratigan threatens to harm Olivia. Ratigan plans to usurp the Queen and become \"supreme ruler of all mousedom.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Fidget appears through the window, and they attempt to chase him. Basil, along with Dawson and Olivia, take Toby, [[Sherlock Holmes]]' pet [[Basset Hound]], to track down Fidget's scent, where they locate him in a toyshop stealing clockwork mechanisms and toy soldiers' uniforms. Fidget ambushes Olivia and captures her. Basil and Dawson pursue Fidget but are easily outsmarted. While searching the shop, Dawson discovers Fidget's checklist, to which Basil does some chemical tests to discover the list came from a riverfront near the [[Thames]]. Basil and Dawson disguise themselves as sailors and head to a tavern called the \"Rat Trap.\" They find Fidget and follow him to Ratigan's headquarters but are caught in an ambush by Ratigan. Ratigan has them tied to a spring-loaded mousetrap connected with a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] laid out to kill them both. Ratigan sets out for [[Buckingham Palace]], where his henchmen hijack the royal guards' roles and kidnap the Queen. Basil deduces the trap's weakness and escapes along with Dawson and Olivia just in time.\n\nAt Buckingham Palace, Ratigan forces Flaversham to operate the toy Queen, while the real one is taken to be fed to Felicia, Ratigan's pet cat. The toy Queen declares Ratigan the ruler of all Mousedom, and he announces his dictatorial plans for his new \"subjects.\" After Basil, Dawson, and Olivia save Flaversham and the real Queen, they restrain Fidget and Ratigan's other henchmen, while Toby chases Felicia, leading to Felicia, thinking she escaped Toby by jumping onto a high stone fence, only to be mauled by the royal guard dogs waiting on the other side. Basil seizes control of the mechanical queen, making it denounce Ratigan as a fraud while breaking it into pieces. The crowd, enraged by Ratigan's [[treason]], turns on him, and he escapes on his [[dirigible]] with Fidget, holding Olivia hostage. Basil, Dawson, and Flaversham create their craft with a matchbox and some small [[helium]]-filled balloons, held together by the [[Union Jack]]. Ratigan tosses Fidget overboard to lighten the load, and he attempts to drive the dirigible himself. Basil jumps onto the dirigible to confront Ratigan, causing it to crash straight into the [[Big Ben]] clocktower.\n\nInside the clocktower, where Ratigan still holds Olivia hostage, Basil manages to get Ratigan's cape stuck on some gears. He rescues Olivia and safely delivers her to Flaversham. Ratigan breaks free and attacks Basil, eventually knocking him to the dirigible. When the [[striking clock|clock strikes 10:00]], the bell hits for the loudest sound, causing Ratigan to fall to his death, taking Basil with him. However, Basil grabs a part of Ratigan's dirigible and saves himself. Back at Baker Street, Basil and Dawson recount their adventures. After the Flavershams leave the house, a distraught new client arrives and solicits Basil and Dawson's help, with Basil noting that Dawson is his trusted associate, prompting Dawson to remain and assist Basil.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Barrie Ingham]] as Basil, a mouse detective.\n*[[Vincent Price]] as Professor Ratigan, Basil's nemesis. He and Basil are long-established arch-enemies.\n*[[Val Bettin]] as Major Dr. David Q. Dawson, previously of the Queen's [[66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot|66th Regiment]] in [[Afghanistan]]. He eventually becomes Basil's associate, friend, and personal biographer. Dawson also serves as the film's narrator.\n*[[Susanne Pollatschek]] as Olivia Flaversham, an eight-year-old Scottish mouse who seeks Basil's help in finding her toymaker father.\n*[[Candy Candido]] as Fidget, Ratigan's bumbling [[bat]] right-hand henchman. He has a crippled wing and a peg leg, and, as a result of the former, he cannot fly. During the final battle, Ratigan betrays Fidget by throwing him off the side of his flying machine and he falls into the [[Thames]]. He is revealed to have survived the fall in the book. Candido also voices a reprobate in the pub. Candido previously voiced several characters in previous Disney films throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.\n*[[Alan Young]] as Hiram Flaversham, Olivia's affectionate Scottish father. He works as a toymaker and is kidnapped by Fidget to make the Queen Mousetoria robot for the evil Ratigan. Young previously voiced [[Scrooge McDuck]] in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''.\n*[[Frank Welker]] as Toby, Basil's loyal [[basset hound]]. He technically belongs to [[Sherlock Holmes]], who lives above Basil. (In the Sherlock Holmes canon, Toby (who is not a basset but \"half [[spaniel]] and half [[lurcher]]\") is owned by a [[Minor Sherlock Holmes characters#Toby|Mr. Sherman]], a \"[[Taxidermy|bird-stuffer]]\" and owner of a menagerie, who willingly lends him to Holmes whenever requested.) Much of Toby's barking sound were archived dog sounds from previous Disney films such as ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', ''[[Old Yeller (film)|Old Yeller]]'', ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', and ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''. He also voices Felicia, Ratigan's large and pompous pet cat. Ratigan calls upon her by ringing a special bell to dispose of traitors or anyone who makes him angry. She is chased by Toby, only to be mauled by Royal Guard Dogs during the climax of the film. \n*Diana Chesney as Mrs. Judson, Basil's housekeeper. She adores Basil but gets very annoyed when he mistreats her good pillows by shooting them with a [[pistol]].\n*[[Eve Brenner]] as Queen Mousetoria, the mouse Queen of the United Kingdom, whom Ratigan attempts to depose. \n*[[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]], the famous human detective who lives above Basil. His voice is taken from the 1966 Caedmon Records recording of the Sherlock Holmes story \"[[The Red-Headed League]]\".<ref name=\"usatoday\" /> \n*[[Laurie Main]] as [[Doctor Watson|Dr. Watson]], the medical associate/partner of Sherlock Holmes, who also lives above Basil. Unlike Rathbone, voice samples of [[Nigel Bruce]] were not used for the voice of Watson as he had died in 1953.<ref name=\"usatoday\" /> \n*[[Wayne Allwine]], [[Tony Anselmo]], [[Walker Edmiston]] and [[Val Bettin]] as Ratigan's Thugs\n*[[Melissa Manchester]] as Miss Kitty Mouse, who appears in \"Let Me Be Good To You\"\n\n==Production==\nThe idea of doing an animated film about Sherlock Holmes with animals was first discussed during the production of ''[[The Rescuers]]''. Veteran layout artist Joe Hale is credited with suggesting to adapt the children's book series ''[[Basil of Baker Street]]'' by [[Eve Titus]], but the project fell into development limbo because of the similarities to ''The Rescuers''.<ref name=\"usatoday\" /> In 1982, Ron Clements proposed adapting the children's book series into an animated feature and, along with story artist Pete Young, it was pitched to Disney President [[Ron W. Miller|Ron Miller]] who approved the project.{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=51}} Earlier in his career, Clements created a 15-minute Sherlock Holmes animated short recorded on [[Super 8 film]].{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=176}} Because the animators were displeased with the direction ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' was heading, ''Basil of Baker Street'' was approved as an alternative project.<ref name=\"usatoday\">{{cite news|last=Korkis|first=Jim|title=How Basil Saved Disney Feature Animation: Part One|url=http://travel.usatoday.com/alliance/destinations/mouseplanet/post/2011/02/How-Basil-Saved-Disney-Feature-Animation-Part-One/144296/1|work=[[USA Today]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712004433/http://travel.usatoday.com/alliance/destinations/mouseplanet/post/2011/02/How-Basil-Saved-Disney-Feature-Animation-Part-One/144296/1|date=February 23, 2011|archive-date=July 12, 2014|access-date=June 22, 2016}}</ref>{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=65}}\n\n[[Burny Mattinson]] and John Musker were assigned as the original directors while Dave Michener was also added as co-director. Miller became the producer for the film. The first idea for the victim was for Olivia\u2014then an older and potential love interest whom Dawson falls for, but Miller suggested the character be \"a little girl, someone they [the audience] can feel sorry for.\" One of the dropped characters was a stool pigeon who always hung around Buckingham Palace and tipped Basil off about the skullduggery. The writers dropped the characters deciding for Basil to figure it out for himself.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=176}}\n\nWith the departure of Miller in 1984, the board of directors appointed [[Michael Eisner]], who had resigned from [[Paramount Pictures]], to become the new CEO. Eisner recruited former production head [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] to become studio chairman over Disney's film division. Following a story reel screening of ''Basil'', Eisner and Katzenberg complained about the slow pacing of the story and ordered for rewrites before animation would commence. Although the intended release was set for Christmas 1987,<ref>{{cite news|last=Culhane|first=John|author-link=John Culhane|title='The Great Mouse Detective' Gives Clues to the Future of Disney Animation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/movies/the-great-mouse-detective-gives-clues-to-the-future-of-disney-animation.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=H12|date=July 27, 1986|access-date=June 22, 2016}}</ref> [[Michael Eisner]] slashed the projected production budget at $24 million in half where it was green-lit at $10 million and moved the release date up to July 1986 giving the production team one year to complete the film.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pp=70\u20131, 84}} To replace Miller who had been producer, Feature Animation chairman [[Roy E.
