Moses is unaware that his best friend, Rock Keats, is actually [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] undercover cop Jack Carter, who befriended him to infiltrate Colton's gang.\n\nCarter has Moses include him in Colton's next drug shipment, secretly planning to arrest Colton and take in Moses, whom he has come to care about, unharmed. Carter's undercover status is revealed before he can enact his plan, however, and a hurt Moses pulls a gun on him. During the raid on Colton's warehouse, an out of control crane hits Moses in the back, causing him to accidentally shoot Carter in the head. He then flees the state, and is subsequently found and arrested.\n\nCarter miraculously survives and makes a full recovery with the aid of his physical therapist, Dr. Traci Flynn, with whom he falls in love. Moses is brought into custody, and he agrees to testify against Colton, but the trial is set to take place at the other side of the country. Carter's superior officer, Capt. Jensen, orders him to personally transfer Moses to the courtroom.\n\nCarter harbors resentment against Moses, and tensions escalate once the simple transfer goes awry. Colton learns through bribed federal agents and LAPD officers of Moses' attempt to testify against him. As they flee from Colton's men, Carter and Moses slowly mend their friendship, and are successful in returning to Carter's precinct. However, Colton apparently holds Flynn hostage, and blackmails Carter into turning Moses over to save Flynn.\n\nCarter and Moses pretend to comply with Colton, and shoot their way through Colton's guards. It is later revealed that Flynn is on Colton's payroll, and is responsible for leaking Carter's and Moses' whereabouts to him. Moses takes a bullet in the shoulder to save Carter's life, giving him time enough to arrest Flynn, then shoots Colton dead. Moses gives the incriminating documents on Colton to Carter, who allows him to escape. He heads to [[Mexico]] to become a bullfighter, with Carter and Moses' mother later accompanying him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Archie Moses\n* [[Damon Wayans]] as Detective Jack Carter / Rock Keats\n* [[James Caan]] as Frank Colton\n* [[Robert Swenson|Jeep Swenson]] as Bledsoe\n* [[James Farentino]] as Captain Will Jensen\n* [[Kristen Wilson]] as Dr. Traci Flynn\n* Larry McCoy as Detective Sulliman\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Detective Jones\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as DEA Agent Finch\n* [[Mark Roberts (TV producer)|Mark Roberts]] as Charles\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as FBI Agent Darryl Gentry\n* Mark Castella as Disneyland cop\n* Andrew Shaifer as Cop at airport\n* [[Monica Potter]] as Biker's woman\n* [[Jonathan Loughran]] as Rookie cop\n* [[Steve White (actor)|Steve White]] as Veteran cop\n\n==Production==\nReflecting on the film years later, director Ernest Dickerson spoke to [[DVD Talk]] of his regretful experiences making the film:\n\n{{blockquote|There's a movie I did a couple years ago called ''Bulletproof''.
