It is a [[remake]] of the 1960 film [[The Magnificent Seven|of the same name]], itself an adaptation of the 1954 Japanese film ''[[Seven Samurai]]''. The film stars [[Denzel Washington]], [[Chris Pratt]], [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Lee Byung-hun]], [[Manuel Garcia-Rulfo]], [[Martin Sensmeier]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], and [[Haley Bennett]]. It was the final film of composer [[James Horner]], who died the previous year after composing part of the score; his friend [[Simon Franglen]] completed the music. [[Principal photography]] began on May 18, 2015, in the north of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].\n\n''The Magnificent Seven'' premiered on September 8, 2016, at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]], and was released in the United States on September 23, 2016, by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] through its [[Columbia Pictures]] label, in conventional and [[IMAX]] theatres.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37307798|title=Toronto 2016: Magnificent Seven diversity 'not a statement', says director|first=Tim|last=Masters|work=BBC News |date=September 9, 2016}}</ref> The film received mixed reviews from critics, where the cast, action sequences and the score were praised, but the story and screenplay received criticism. It was a moderate success, grossing $162 million worldwide on a production budget of $90 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1879, [[robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]] and gold-mining tycoon Bartholomew Bogue, accompanied by an army of hired guns, forcefully seizes control of the [[American frontier]] town of Rose Creek. He enslaves the residents as cheap labor for his mine. When the residents denounce him at the town church, Bogue has the church torched and several citizens murdered, including farmer Matthew Cullen, to intimidate the rest. Matthew's widow Emma and her friend Teddy leave to hire [[bounty hunter]]s to help liberate the town. Their first recruit is Sam Chisholm, a famous [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]], who expresses interest only after hearing of Bogue's involvement.\n\nChisholm then recruits several other men: gambler and trick-shooter Joshua Faraday; pardon-seeking outlaw Vasquez; former [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] marksman Goodnight \"Goody\" Robicheaux; his friend Billy Rocks, a knife-thrower who hustles gunfighters for Robicheaux; and legendary game hunter Jack Horne. During their journey they add an additional member, a [[Comanche]] warrior named Red Harvest.\n\nThe Seven enter Rose Creek and eliminate twenty-two Blackstone \"detectives\" hired to guard the town. Chisholm apprehends the corrupt sheriff, Mr. Harp, and sends him away to inform Bogue that they now control his holdings in Rose Creek. Chisholm tells the terrified townspeople that he guesses they only have seven days before Bogue's men arrive. Some flee but most are determined to fight for their town. The seven liberate the men held at the mine, taking the explosives stockpiled there and spending the next week fortifying the town and training them to shoot. Meanwhile, Bogue shoots Harp dead for his failure, and orders his Comanche enforcer, Denali, and his right-hand man McCann to take back Rose Creek. Robicheaux, haunted by his experiences in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and fearing his own death if he kills again, leaves the town the night before Bogue's arrival; Emma volunteers to take his place.\n\nThe next morning, Bogue's army attacks Rose Creek, with most of them quickly getting killed by various traps, explosives, and ambushes prepared by the Seven. As the battle rages on, Faraday is wounded by McCann, who is killed by Vasquez; the defensive line collapses, and Robicheaux returns to join the battle, warning the others just as Bogue and his remaining men start firing a [[Gatling gun]] from a hill leading into the town, killing many of the townspeople and even their own mercenaries.\n\nRealizing they are outgunned, the Seven evacuate the survivors to the burnt-out church and mount a [[last stand]]. Horne protects a wounded Teddy from gunfire, but is killed by Denali, who is later killed by an enraged Red Harvest. Robicheaux and Billy are killed by a second round of gunfire while covering Faraday as he makes a [[Suicidal attack|suicidal charge]] up the hill and destroys the Gatling gun with [[dynamite]], leaving Bogue with only two men left. Chisholm confronts them and easily guns down the two remaining mercenaries, before disarming Bogue by blasting the gun out of his hand. A wounded Bogue retreats into the church, where Chisholm reveals that his family was [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] in 1867 by ex-Confederate soldiers, who were hired by Bogue to drive [[Homestead Acts|homesteaders]] out of [[Kansas]]. After imploring Bogue to repent, Chisholm begins to [[garrote]] him; Bogue tries to pull a hidden small-caliber, top-break revolver, but Emma shoots him dead.\n\nThe townspeople return to Rose Creek and thank Chisholm, Vasquez, and Red Harvest for their service as they ride off. Faraday, Robicheaux, Billy, and Horne are buried near the town and honored as heroes. Emma, in [[Voice-over|voice-over narration]], reflects fondly on the noble sacrifice that made them \"magnificent\".\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Denzel Washington 2013.jpg\n| width1 = 157\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Chris Pratt 2018.jpg\n| width2 = 172\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Denzel Washington]] (''left'') and [[Chris Pratt]] (''right''), who play the lead roles in the film\n}}\n\n=== The Seven ===\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Sam Chisholm, a [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshal]] warrant officer from [[Wichita, Kansas]], and the leader of the Seven.

Now we can trade our conscience for a bucket of popcorn.
