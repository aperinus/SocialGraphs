It is a [[remake]] of the 1951 [[Angels in the Outfield (1951 film)|film of the same name]]. It stars [[Danny Glover]], [[Tony Danza]] and [[Christopher Lloyd]], and features several future stars, including [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] (in the lead), [[Adrien Brody]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], and [[Neal McDonough]]. It was followed by two [[made for TV]] sequels, ''[[Angels in the Endzone]]'' and ''[[Angels in the Infield]]''. It was released less than a month before the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|1994 MLB Baseball Strike]], which forced the league to cancel the playoffs and the [[World Series]].\n\n== Plot ==\nYoung foster child Roger Bomman and his friend, J.P., love to sneak into baseball games of the struggling [[Los Angeles Angels|California Angels]]. Still in limited contact with his widowed father, Roger asks when they will be a family again. His father replies sarcastically, \"I'd say when the Angels win the pennant.\" Taking his father's words literally, he prays for [[God]] to help the Angels win. In a game against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] which Roger and J.P. attend, he sees a group of [[angel]]s led by Al helping the team. Although he can see them quite clearly, everyone else can only explain the seemingly impossible acts as freak occurrences. Roger's unique ability to see which players are receiving help from angels leads their skeptical manager George Knox to keep him around as a [[good luck charm]] and consultant. Due to the much-needed help, the Angels start to win games and make a surprising second-half surge to the top of their [[division (sport)|division]].\n\nRoger's father permanently gives up [[child custody|custody]] of him, believing it is in Roger's best interest. As Roger laments his loss, an equally distraught J.P. accidentally reveals to antagonistic sportscaster Ranch Wilder that Roger has the ability to see angels, and that George has been winning through the advice Roger gave him. Hoping to destroy George's career in baseball due to a long-time mutual hatred between them, Ranch informs the press of this, and their owner Hank Murphy threatens to relieve George of his management responsibilities. Roger comes clean to his caretaker Maggie Nelson about his special ability, and at a press conference, they and the entire team defend George in front of the press. Moved by their faith, Murphy allows him to remain as the Angels' manager.\n\nDuring the final game of the season against the rival [[Chicago White Sox]], none of the angels show up to help the team. Later on, Al appears to Roger and explains that championships must be decided without the angels' intervention. He also says that he is there to check on pitcher Mel Clark, who only has months to live due to his years of smoking and will become an angel himself. Mel struggles in the ninth inning but perseveres after encouragement from George, his team, and the fans in attendance. The Angels ultimately win the game on their own and clinch the division title and the pennant. Murphy fires Ranch because of his denigration of the team. George adopts Roger and J.P., as he wants to try to be a father. J.P. sees Al and says, \"I knew it could happen.\" Al flies off and says, \"We're always watching\".\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Danny Glover]] as George Knox (Angels Manager)\n*[[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Roger Bomman\n*[[Brenda Fricker]] as Maggie Nelson (Foster Mom)\n*[[Tony Danza]] as Mel Clark (Angels Pitcher)\n*[[Christopher Lloyd]] as Al \"The Boss\" Angel\n*[[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Hank Murphy (Angels Owner)\n*[[Jay O.

The film did, however, premiere at the Pirates' home stadium at the time, [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/movies/20030124video0124fnp3.asp| access-date=August 21, 2009| title=Multi Media: Adrien Brody going darker and deeper| date=January 24, 2003| first=Barbara| last=Vancheri| publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=12 July 1994 |title=Believing in angels |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t2lGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zugMAAAAIBAJ&dq=danny%20glover%20pittsburgh&pg=6319,2844707 |access-date= |website=[[The Daily Gazette]]}}</ref> The premiere would be the only reference to the Pirates, due to both teams playing in separate leagues (Angels in the [[American League]], Pirates in the [[National League]]) and the film being released three years before the start of [[interleague play]].
