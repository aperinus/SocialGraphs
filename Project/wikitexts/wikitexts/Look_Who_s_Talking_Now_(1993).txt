James and Mollie are still in love with each other and miss each other while they are apart. As Mollie becomes more tired, Daphne realizes that she needs to become more independent.\n\nRocks helps her learn how to go outside by herself and use her sense of smell to track people or things. The two dogs start becoming friends. On Christmas Eve, Samantha tricks James into coming to fancy cabin in the woods by saying that she wants to introduce him to a prospective client. She stalls for time until James cannot leave because of a snowstorm. James calls Mollie to tell her that he cannot make it home for Christmas.

He finds Samantha's cabin, and James realizes that Mollie has set out to find him. He confronts Samantha about her lies and quits his job, then goes with Rocks to track down his family. Samantha picks the vase up off the table and tries to throw it at him but he shuts the door so it hits the door and shatters instead.
