With a puzzling structure, the story is told through a series of flashbacks presented from four different perspectives.\n\n== Plot ==\nJustin, a ten-year-old boy living in a small town in the [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] region, is awaken in the middle of the night. His mother, Mireille is crying and his widower grandfather, Victor, tells the boy that his father, Ivan, is dead. The next day, Alex, Justin's uncle and Ivan's younger brother, arrives for the funeral accompanied by a young woman, Juliette. Justin notice the tension between the adults. He takes his father's gun and hides it. The story flashes backward and forward to explain what led up to Ivan's death.\n\nAlex, who has rebelled against his family by becoming a cop, works in the deprived La Duchere district of [[Lyon]]. He begins with his encounter, a year before Ivan's death, when he first meets Juliette, who is brought to his office when she was arrested for shoplifting. He lets her off. He sees her again one day when he visits the sleazy nightclub run by his older brother, Ivan. Ivan is a crime boss and runs a popular club with a drag revue, funding his business through a stolen-auto ring headed up by Jimmy, who is Juliette's brother. The encounter between the siblings on opposite sides of the law is tense, they barely get along. Ivan is happy to show Alex that he is doing much better than him on the wrong side of the law. After their second encounter Alex and Juliette start a tortured affair beginning to meet regularly for sex. He is not in love with her, and their relationship is complicated by the young woman's emotional and sexual involvement with Marie, a professor of philosophy. Alex spies on Marie. Ivan hears about Juliette's relationship with Alex and threatens her. Ivan and his gang, including Juliette, plan the theft of cars in a railway deposit.\n\nThe heist at the railway marshaling yard goes disastrously wrong when Ivan is shot dead. Juliette, who had been coerced into participating, against Jimmy's wishes, is distraught by Ivan's death.  Emotional imbalance and self-destructive, Juliette tries to commit suicide twice, first while staying with her brother and later while visiting Marie, after Ivan's death. Marie has her interned in a psychiatric hospital to recuperate. Alex asks Marie for the address of Juliette's clinic, but she has disappeared. In search of Juliette, Marie visits her housing estate apartment. After Ivan's cremation, Alex makes an effort to connect with his nephew without much success. On a local fair, Justin threatens Alex with a gun. Justin learns the truth about his father's death from his grandfather Victor.\n\nMarie visits Alex, who tells her Juliette was involved in the heist and that he is trying to find her. Alex and Marie develop an uneasy friendship as they bid, from a distance, to protect Juliette. Later Alex visits Marie and finds she has become a recluse, writing a book about Juliette. He tells her Juliette is safe because the police are looking for a boy. Later Alex hears that Marie has committed suicide as he receives her manuscript and the tapes of Juliette's voice in the post. Alex goes to see Juliette in [[Marseilles]], but leaves her alone when he sees she is well from a distance. She has built a new life for herself and works in a bookshop. Justin has taken after his father and grandfather and does not like his uncle. By contrast, Justin gets along very well with Jimmy. Jimmy decides to marry Ivan's widow, Mireille.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Auteuil]] as Alex\n* [[Catherine Deneuve]] as Marie Leblanc\n* [[Laurence C\u00f4te]] as Juliette Fontana\n* [[Beno\u00eet Magimel]] as Jimmy Fontana\n* [[Didier Bezace]] as Ivan\n* Julien Rivi\u00e8re as Justin\n* [[Ivan Desny]] as Victor\n* Fabienne Babe as Mireille\n* R\u00e9gis Betoule as R\u00e9gis\n* Pierre Perez as Fred\n* Naguime Bendidi as Nabil\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film premiered in May 1996 at the 49th [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4691/year/1996.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Thieves |accessdate=18 September 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> It was released in [[France]] on 21 August 1996  and in [[the United States]] on 25 December that same year.\n \n''Thieves'' received widespread praise from film critics. It is generally considered, with ''[[My Favorite Season]]'' and ''[[Wild Reeds]]'', among T\u00e9chin\u00e9's best films.<ref name = \" Marshall 1\">Marshall, ''Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9'', p. 1</ref>  Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]]  reports that 82% of 11 critics have given the film a positive review, holding an average score of 7/10.<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\">{{cite web |title = Thieves |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1076146-thieves/ |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate = 8 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn line film critic [[James Berardinelli]] called the film  \"strong and keenly-insightful \".<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\"/> [[Roger Ebert]] from [[the Chicago Sun-Times]] wrote that \"T\u00e9chin\u00e9 involves us in a subtle, gradual process of discovery; each piece changes the relationship of the others.

Its fragmented structure has been compared to a [[William Faulkner]]'s novel, particularly to ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929).<ref name = \" Marshall 52\">Marshall, ''Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9'', p. 52</ref>  The narrative \u2014 consisting of a prologue, five sections, and an epilogue \u2014 leaps around in time and switches between the viewpoints of Justin, Alex, Marie, and Juliette. ''The Sound and the Fury'' unfolds over four days, likewise, switching narrative perspectives. Both ''The Sound and the Fury'' and ''Thieves'' also have a central female character who is loved obsessively by two of the narrators: Faulkner's novel has Caddie, who is loved by her brothers Benjy and Quentin, and T\u00e9chin\u00e9's film has Juliette, who is the love interest of both Alex and Marie.<ref name = \" Marshall 53\">Marshall, ''Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9'', p. 53</ref>  The divided time structure emphasize the interlapping relationships between the characters.<ref name = \" Marshall 54\">Marshall, ''Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9'', p. 54</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe original score for the film was written by [[Alain Sarde]], regular composer in T\u00e9chin\u00e9's films.<ref name=\" Marshall 157\"/> The sound track includes an eclectic mix of artist and styles like : Cheb Mami, [[Liza Minnelli]], The Archies  and [[Mozart]].<ref name = \" Marshall 149\">Marshall, ''Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9'', p. 149</ref> \n* ''Douha Alia'' [[Cheb Mami]]\n* ''Baadini'' [[Rachid Taha]]\n* ''Sous le soleil de Bodega'' [[Les N\u00e9gresses Vertes]]\n* ''Sugar Sugar'' [[The Archies]]\n* ''The Magic Flute'' [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]\n* ''Tonite'' [[Les Rita Mitsouko]]\n* ''La Valse Petite'' [[La Tordue]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Thieves|url=http://ww.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=9042/ |work = Soundtrack collector |accessdate = 8 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Home media ==\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] on 4 March 2011 in the [[United States]] by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]] as a [[DVD-R]] manufactured on demand.
