Set in May of the year 1944, it tells the story of a group of [[war pigeons]] during [[World War II]]. The film is based on a story by George Webster, and inspired by true stories of hundreds of pigeons that helped the soldiers in the war.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn May 1944, five years after the declaration of [[World War II]], three Royal Homing Pigeon Service [[war pigeon]]s are flying across the [[English Channel]] with the [[White Cliffs of Dover]] in sight, carrying vital messages to [[Great Britain]]. Despite the poor weather conditions the pigeons have nearly reached their destination. They are, however, suddenly ambushed and attacked by a [[Nazi German]] enemy [[peregrine falcon]] named General Von Talon; two of the pigeons are instantly killed, yet the third, Mercury, is taken as a [[prisoner of war]].\n\nElsewhere, a small [[Common Wood Pigeon|wood pigeon]] named Valiant is watching an [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] propaganda film in his local bar (an overturned rowing boat) in West Nestington. He is best friends with Felix, an old [[seagull]] with a peg leg and the local barman. Wing Commander Gutsy, a [[war hero]], flies into the bar, informing everyone that signups are scheduled the next day in [[Trafalgar Square]], London. Valiant flies off to London, bidding his mother and Felix goodbye. In London, Valiant meets an unhygienic [[slacker]] pigeon named Bugsy, who is being hunted by two magpie thugs, after having tricked them at a [[shell game]]. In order to escape the thugs, he signs up with Valiant.\n\nThe recruits, Valiant, Bugsy, Lofty, an intellectual red pigeon, and Toughwood and Tailfeather, two muscular but dim-witted twin brothers, form Royal Homing Pigeon Service Squad F, and are sent to a [[recruit training]] facility. Under the command of Sergeant Monty, who declares that he will toughen them up for the RHPS, the training begins. Meanwhile, Von Talon and his henchmen, Cufflingk and Underlingk, try numerous attempts to discover the message's departure location. However, Mercury refuses to tell, despite the tortures inflicted upon him, such as irritating him with yodeling music and injecting him with [[truth serum]], before Mercury accidentally reveals the location: Saint-Pierre.\n\nValiant develops a crush on Victoria, the camp's nursing dove. Eventually, Gutsy arrives and tells the Sergeant that the recruits need to leave the next morning, despite their training being vastly incomplete. Bugsy, however, decides not to go on the \"highly dangerous\" mission and flees the camp that night. Next morning Valiant and the others prepare to leave, and start to board a [[Handley Page Halifax]] bound for occupied [[France]], but not before Bugsy shows up at the last second. The journey quickly becomes dangerous, as the plane is caught in an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft attack]]. Their plane sustains heavy damage and the pigeons soon have to bail out, in boxes equipped with parachutes. The pigeons are dropped from the plane; however, a technical malfunction causes Gutsy's box to fail to deploy. The plane crash-lands nearby, but then explodes, presumably killing Gutsy.\n\nIn France, the pigeons meet Charles de Girl and Rollo, two mice from the [[French Resistance]], Mouse Division, who lead them to Saint-Pierre, where they receive the message they have been ordered to deliver. They soon come under attack by Von Talon's henchmen, resulting in Bugsy and the message being captured. Von Talon takes the message from Bugsy and decides to lock him up and kill him later, planning to personally deliver the message to [[Der Fuehrer]] [[Adolf Hitler|himself]]. Valiant and the troops follow Bugsy to the falcon's bunker, where they discover that Gutsy has survived the plane crash. Valiant takes advantage of his small size and sneaks into the bunker through the gun barrel, retrieves the message, and frees Bugsy and Mercury. Unfortunately, the falcons witness the escape and give chase. As Gutsy, Bugsy, Mercury, Toughwood, Tailfeather and Lofty fight off Cufflingk and Underlingk, Valiant flies to London to deliver the message, followed by Von Talon.\n\nAfter a climactic chase, Valiant hides until he is caught by Von Talon. With the help of Felix and the resident pigeons, Valiant outwits Von Talon by getting a giant hook caught on his medals, leaving him to be beaten by the [[water wheel]]. Valiant delivers the message, and upon its arrival in the war room, a change of plans is made; the Allied fleet [[Normandy landings|will land in Normandy]]. After receiving the [[Dickin Medal]], Squad F returns to the local bar in West Nestington, where Valiant reunites and shares a romantic kiss with Victoria. A message is then displayed commending the animals that saved thousands of lives during World War II.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Valiant, a plucky and optimistic wood pigeon. Although he is the smallest of the war pigeon squad, he is the bravest.\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Bugsy, a slovenly but friendly pigeon who becomes Valiant's close friend\n* [[Pip Torrens]] as Lofty Thaddeus Worthington, a red scholarly pigeon\n* Dan Roberts as Tailfeather \n* [[John Cleese]] as Mercury\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Victoria, a beautiful and kind nursing dove and Valiant's love interest.\n* [[John Hurt]] as Felix, an old seagull with a peg leg and Valient's friend.\n* [[Annette Badland]] as Elsa, Valiant's doting mother who at first doesn't want her \"little egg\" to go to war, but lets Valiant go to be the hero he needs to be.\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Sergeant Monty, the gruff drill sergeant who puts the recruits through strainious training to prepare for fighting against Von Talon.\n* [[Hugh Laurie]] as Wing Commander Gutsy,\n* [[Tim Curry]] as General Von Talon, a cruel German [[peregrine falcon]] and the main antagonist of the film. He stands out with a big eyepatch over his left eye.\n* [[Rik Mayall]] as Cufflingk, \n* [[Sharon Horgan]] as Charles de Girl\n* [[Jonathan Ross]] as Big Thug\n\n== Themes == \n''Valiant'' takes the [[Second World War]] as its backdrop, and thus the film has various factual references to World War II. McGregor himself called it \"a good old-fashioned [[War film|war movie]].\"<ref name=\"Valiant DVD\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Valiant |title-link=Valiant (film) |orig-year=2005 |others=Gary Chapman |type=Making of Featurette |publisher=[[Vanguard Animation]] |location=London |id=EDV9307 |year=2005}}</ref> The film's use of World War II imagery is apparent throughout; for instance, the villainous characters in the film hold obvious links to the [[Nazis]], although Nazism is never specifically mentioned, nor are Nazi symbols ever overtly visually depicted \u2013 edited symbols are, however, discreetly inserted. For example, General Von Talon wears a large [[Reichsadler]] badge that depicts the German eagle, taken from the [[coat of arms of Germany]]. Yet this version, unlike the Hoheitszeichen (Nazi Germany's national insignia), has the eagle grasping two bones,<ref name=\"Valiant DVD\" /> whereas the Hoheitszeichen depicts the eagle clutching a [[swastika]]. Furthermore, the film's primary [[antagonist]], Von Talon, holds specific links to [[Adolf Hitler]].
