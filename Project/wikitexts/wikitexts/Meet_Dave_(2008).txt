It is a golf-ball-sized metal ball that flies through the window and lands in his fishbowl, quickly draining the water along with the goldfish. He decides to show it at his school's science class presentation.\n\nThree months later, a massive fireball crashes into the water near [[Liberty Island]]. It is revealed to be a spaceship that resembles a human, controlled by 100 tiny humanoid aliens. Its Captain pilots the spaceship from the command deck located in its head, with the help of his second-in-command Number 2, and researcher Number 3. The spaceship looks very human, and displays numerous superpowers, but the aliens don't know how to make the \"ship\" act like a human. A superstitious cop named Dooley desperately searches for the alien.\n\nThe aliens need to save their planet, Nil, from an energy crisis. They need salt, which they plan to take by draining the Earth's [[ocean]]s using the metal ball, so they have to recover the ball. After the spaceship is hit by Josh's single mother, Gina Morrison while driving, the Captain decides to befriend Gina and Josh. He tells them his name is Dave Ming Chang, based on a quick scan of common Earth names. At Gina's home the crew see their missing ball in a photograph taken at the science presentation. After having breakfast with Gina, \"Dave\" goes to Josh's school where he pretends to be a substitute teacher and eventually is able to talk to Josh alone. Josh tells him that the ball was taken from him by a bully. With Josh's help, Dave takes the metal ball back from the bully.\n\nThe Captain (via Dave) spends some time with Josh and Gina and realizes that humans are more advanced than they originally thought. The crew observes humans displaying feelings and love, such as witnessing Gina's painting or a homeless man offering to share his blanket with Dave when he sleeps in a doorway. The Captain decides to cancel the plan to drain the oceans because it would destroy life on Earth. The police track Dave down using the impression of his face found in the dirt at the crash site and they arrest him. After spending so much time on Earth, most of the crew begin to exhibit new \"feelings\", adopting Earth's culture, mannerisms and general laid-back attitude. Number 2 decides that the Captain and the rest of the crew's changing behavior is unacceptable and takes command of the \"ship\", imprisoning the Captain. Under Number 2's command, Dave breaks out of the police station and another attempt is made to arrest him. Number 3, who has become infatuated with the Captain, becomes jealous of Gina. She first cooperates in the command change but later agrees with the Captain's view on humans. Both are caught by Number 2 and they are expelled from the spaceship. In the meantime, Number 17, a young, fun-loving alien, jumps out of the \"ship\" while [[Drunkenness|drunk]] from the alcohol Dave has imbibed. The Captain apologizes to Number 3 for ignoring her. He admits that he too loves her and wants to be with her. Back at the police station, Dooley discovers Number 17 in his coffee and interrogates him to find out where Dave is going.\n\nNumber 2 takes Dave to the harbor, where he tries to throw the metal orb into the ocean, but is stopped by the Captain and Number 3, both of whom managed to gain reentry back onto the ship. They convince the rest of the crew that the real Captain is in charge again. Reinstated, he orders Number 2 to be stuck in the ship's \"butt\" forever. The metal orb meanwhile slips out of Dave's hand and rolls into the ocean. The Captain attempts to retrieve the orb but is told that they only have enough power to either retrieve it or return home. The Captain decides to save the Earth and the rest of the crew agrees. The ball, thrown in the ocean by Number 2, is retrieved. Dave powers down while Dooley and his partner catch up and point their guns at him. With no power, Dave's shields are disabled, leaving the crew defenseless. Josh tries to tell the police officers that Dave is harmless but is ignored. He then grabs Dooley's taser which he uses on Dave, recharging him. The Captain and Number 3 reveal themselves to the police officers who stand down. The Captain says goodbye to Josh and Gina saying he now understands love. Number 17 is then returned to Dave by Dooley. About to fly away, a team from the FBI arrives and throws a net over Dave. While the FBI agents wrestle the body down, \"Dave's\" crew evacuates to one of the ship's \"lifeboat\" shoes, activate the engines, detaches the shoe and heads home to Nil, leaving behind both the ship and Number 2. While in the lifeboat, the Captain asks for Number 3's hand in marriage. She accepts and they kiss.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Dave Ming Chang and The Captain (Number 1)\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Gina Morrison\n* [[Gabrielle Union]] as Number 3\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Number 2\n* [[Marc Blucas]] as Mark Rhodes\n* [[Scott Caan]] as Officer Dooley\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Number 17\n*[[Yvette Nicole Brown]] as Betty, an Old Navy Saleswoman.\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Officer Stevie Knox\n* Austyn Lind Myers as Josh Morrison\n* [[Pat Kilbane]] as Number 4 / Johnny Dazzles<ref>{{Cite book |last=Greenberg |first=Rob |url=http://www.scriptdrive.net/attachment.php?aid=4129 |title=Starship Dave |last2=Corbett |first2=Bill |date=2007}}</ref>\n* Tariq Bah as Marcus Grill\n* [[Miguel A.

The concept was eventually dropped and Corbett, along with other MST3K alumni, instead developed the online mini-series ''[[Edward the Less|The Adventures of Edward the Less]]'' for the site. Corbett later revived the idea for a movie and discussed it with friend and fellow writer [[Rob Greenberg]], who would become his screenwriting partner for the project. Although both writers acknowledged several other \"little people inside big people\"<ref name=\"Rifftrax\">{{Cite web |last=Corbett |first=Bill] |author-link=Bill Corbett |date=July 10, 2008 |title=Meat, Dave? |url=http://blog.rifftrax.com/2008/07/10/meat-dave/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505142443/http://blog.rifftrax.com/2008/07/10/meat-dave/ |archive-date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=February 2, 2009 |website=[[RiffTrax]]}}</ref> movies had been made in the past, Corbett thought the aspect of an entire ''[[Star Trek]]'' like crew operating a human being bore some originality.<ref name=\"Rifftrax\" />\n\nDuring filming, ''Meet Dave'' was transferred from [[Paramount Pictures]] (which released many of Murphy's early films) to [[20th Century Fox]] (which released ''[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'').<ref name=\"Rifftrax\" />\n\n''Meet Dave'' was written under the title ''Starship Dave'', but studio executives insisted on a title change in part because of the poor box office performance of ''[[The Adventures of Pluto Nash]]'', a 2002 science-fiction comedy that also starred [[Eddie Murphy]]. Corbett said the executives also wanted the title changed because they felt having any semblance of science-fiction in the title would isolate a large percentage of audiences. Corbett unsuccessfully argued against the new title, which he described as \"beyond generic\" and said was repetitive of a comedy released earlier in the year called ''[[Meet Bill]]''.<ref name=\"Rifftrax\" />\n\nAlthough the project as it was originally conceived appealed to both children and slightly older audiences, the final script aimed for a much more solidly family-based audience. Corbett and Greenberg wrote the original draft and some subsequent drafts and, although they were given the sole writing credit, Corbett said other writers \"have romped through the script as well,\"<ref name=\"Rifftrax\" /> including one unnamed writer who spent one week adding material after the final draft was submitted. A large amount of improvising and rewriting was also done on the set, and Corbett and Greenberg had little creative control during filming. Corbett said most of the people they worked with were pleasant and some of the notes from the studio were helpful, but that ''Meet Dave'' ultimately suffered from a \"too-many-cooks thing.\"<ref name=\"Rifftrax\" />\n\nFilming was expected to begin in March 2007.
