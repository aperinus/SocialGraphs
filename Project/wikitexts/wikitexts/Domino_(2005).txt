An international co-production between France, the United States, and the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"bfi\">{{cite web|title=Domino (2005)|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8ad83b48|website=British Film Institute|access-date=23 June 2017}}</ref> the film is inspired by [[Domino Harvey]], the English daughter of stage and screen actor [[Laurence Harvey]], who became a [[Los Angeles]] [[bounty hunter]].\n\nIts plot flashes back as Domino ([[Keira Knightley]]), fashion model turned bounty hunter, narrates how a $10 million robbery came about 36 hours before. Supporting actors include [[Mickey Rourke]], [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]], [[Delroy Lindo]], [[Mena Suvari]] [[Mo'Nique]], [[Lucy Liu]], and [[Christopher Walken]]. The film is dedicated to Harvey, who died at age 35 from an overdose of [[fentanyl]] on June 27, 2005, a few months before the film was released.\n\n==Plot==\nDomino Harvey, a [[bounty hunter]], has been arrested by the [[FBI]], investigating the theft of $10 million from an armored truck. She is interviewed by criminal psychologist Taryn Mills and tells her everything she knows about the case. Domino explains her profession and the events leading up to the theft with Mills occasionally prompting her to give more detail.\n\nDomino is a former model living in Los Angeles who becomes a bounty hunter when, after being kicked out of college, she notices a newspaper advertisement for a bounty hunter training seminar. Her colleagues are Ed Moseby, Choco and Afghan driver Alf. They are employed by Claremont Williams III, a [[bail bondsman]] who also runs an [[Armored car (valuables)|armored car]] business, and whose [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], Lateesha Rodriguez, works for the California [[Department of Motor Vehicles]]. Lateesha's granddaughter Mica is suffering from a blood disease and needs an operation that costs $300,000. Claremont sets up the robbery of $10 million from Drake Bishop, the owner of the [[The Strat (Las Vegas)|Stratosphere Hotel and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas]] and a client of Claremont. His bounty hunters would return the stolen money and collect a $300,000 finder's fee from Bishop.\n\nLateesha has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket at the DMV. A teenager named Frances arrives at the DMV and asks Lateesha for fake licenses for himself, his brother, and two of their friends. The FBI are tipped about Lateesha's racket. They threaten to send her to jail unless she gives them information about Frances, whom they have been surveilling. Lateesha throws them off the trail by saying that Frances, his brother, and his two friends are going to commit the armored car robbery, when in reality she and Claremont are doing it themselves.\n\nLateesha carries out the robbery with the help of three co-workers. Claremont finds that Frances and his brother are the sons of mafia boss Anthony Cigliutti. He phones Lateesha and tells her to abort the plan, leaving the money with [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] Locus Fender, who takes the money to his mother's trailer home. Claremont has the bounty hunters apprehend Frances, his brother and his two friends and then tells them to deliver them to men working for Drake Bishop. Claremont tells them to retrieve the money from Fender and to deliver it to Bishop at the Stratosphere Casino. Following a shootout with Fender's mother, the $10 million is retrieved. Cigliutti is told about his sons' arrest and is led to believe that Bishop had his sons killed. In reality Bishop's men released the boys after learning that they did not know anything about the robbery. Believing his sons dead, Cigliutti wants revenge and heads for the Stratosphere. In Las Vegas, Domino takes $300,000 of Bishop's money and gives it to Lateesha for Mica's operation.\n\nAt the Stratosphere, the bounty hunters meet with Bishop, who has an armed crew with him. Domino and Bishop discuss the $10 million and what should happen next. Alf has stolen the money and filled the sacks with plastic explosives. He then reveals that he has the remote detonator taped to his hand, and has shipped the money to free Afghanistan. Shortly after this revelation Cigliutti turns up with his crew. Though Bishop denies he had Cigliutti's sons killed, Cigliutti shoots him. In the ensuing gunfight Choco and Ed are severely wounded, but make it into the elevator with Domino. Alf blows up the top of the Stratosphere and Domino is the only survivor.\n\nAfter telling Taryn Mills everything, Domino is released by the FBI. Mills advises her to retire from bounty hunting. The (nearly) $10 million in boxes is delivered to Afghanistan and opened by celebrating children in the streets, Mica gets her $300,000 operation, and Domino shares a moment with her mother.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as [[Domino Harvey]]\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Ed Moseby\n* [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]] as Choco\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as Claremont Williams\n* [[Mo'Nique]] as Lateesha Rodriguez\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Kimmie\n* [[Macy Gray]] as Lashandra Davis\n* [[Jacqueline Bisset]] as [[Paulene Stone|Sophie Wynn]], Domino's mother\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Drake Bishop\n* [[Brian Austin Green]] as himself\n* [[Ian Ziering]] as himself\n* [[Stanley Kamel]] as Anthony Cigliutti\n* [[Peter Jacobson]] as Burke Beckett\n* [[T.

The article, written by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and titled ''My gun for hire: Why a movie star's rebel daughter turned into a bounty hunter'', was about an English woman named Domino Harvey who was working as a bounty hunter, apprehending fugitives who had skipped bail for the Celes King Bail Bond agency in [[South Central Los Angeles]].
