It was released on [[Disney Channel]] UK on April 27, 2007. The film, starring [[Corbin Bleu]] and [[Keke Palmer]], revolves around a young boxer, Izzy Daniels (Bleu), who trains to follow in his father's footsteps by winning the [[Golden Gloves|Golden Glove]]. When his friend, Mary (Palmer), asks him to substitute for a team member in a [[Double Dutch (jump rope)|Double Dutch]] tournament, Izzy discovers his new love for the sport. At the same time, he discovers true love in Mary and he deals with the conflict between him and his father about boxing.<ref>Corbin Bleu's [http://www.corbinbleu.com/journal.html online journal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409080736/http://www.corbinbleu.com/journal.html |date=April 9, 2007 }}, June 24, 2006,</ref> Filming took place from June\u2013July 2006 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|episode|date=December 2020}}{{Anchor|Synopsis}}\nIsadore \"Izzy\" Daniels ([[Corbin Bleu]]) is a star [[boxing|boxer]] in Brooklyn, hoping to win the Golden Gloves, like his father and coach Kenneth ([[David Reivers]]). Izzy competes in an exhibition match against Rodney (Patrick Johnson Jr.), his classmate and the neighborhood bully, and wins using strategy and focus, giving him a chance to go to the Golden Gloves.\n\nIzzy's neighbor, Mary Thomas ([[Keke Palmer]]), is a competitive Double Dutch player on a team called the Joy Jumpers; though the two often argue with each other, their friends know that they have mutual crushes. Izzy brings his younger sister, Karin (Kylee Russell), and her friends to the Double Dutch regional competition, to watch Mary and her teammates, Shauna ([[Shanica Knowles]]), Keisha ([[Laivan Greene]]), and Yolanda ([[Jajube Mandiela]]). Though Izzy tries to hide it, he enjoys the competition. The Joy Jumpers take fourth place, barely qualifying for the city finals. Upset with Mary's freestyle choreography, Yolanda leaves the team and joins their main competitors, the Dutch Dragons. The Joy Jumpers need to find another teammate, or they can't compete in the city finals. Not taking Double Dutch seriously, Izzy mocks them. Mary then challenges him to jump rope and prove that it's easy. Izzy does so, having done jump roping to train for boxing. The girls convince Izzy to be a temporary replacement until they can find someone else, and he secretly practices with the Joy Jumpers before school at his father's gym.\n\nOver the next several days, Izzy spends more time with the Joy Jumpers and improves tremendously at Double Dutch, though his boxing skills and punctuality suffer as a result. His fellow boxer, Tammy ([[Rebecca Williams (actress)|Rebecca Williams]]), finds out but promises to keep it a secret if he stops teasing her. With some help from Izzy, the Joy Jumpers are able to put together a better freestyle routine. Izzy agrees to join the team permanently, and suggests they change the name to [[Red Hot Chili Peppers |Hot Chili Steppers]] instead, to which Mary agrees. Izzy plans to perform with them at a Double Dutch exhibition to practice their routine. That day, though, Izzy's dad shows up with tickets to a boxing match. Reluctant to tell the truth, Izzy goes with his dad, bailing on Mary and the Hot Chili Steppers. Upset, Mary kicks him off the team, ignoring his apologies.\n\nRodney, meanwhile, is furious over losing to Izzy, and demands a rematch, though Izzy ignores him. He discovers Izzy's secret, and takes pictures of him, leaving them all over their school, exposing and ridiculing Izzy. After seeing this, Mary tries to convince Izzy to come back, but Izzy coldly turns her down. Kenneth gives Izzy a gift for his boxing match but discovers the pictures Rodney posted and confronts Izzy about it. Izzy admits that he didn't tell his dad because ever since Izzy's mother died, all he ever talks about is boxing. Izzy admits that he no longer likes the sport, and only does it for his father. Izzy apologizes, while Kenneth accepts the apology, then leaves the room.\n\nIzzy takes out his anger practicing at the gym until Tammy comes over and reminds him that she's been teased by him and others constantly for being a female boxer, but she's overcome it to become the best girl boxer in Brooklyn. That night, Rodney shows up at the gym with a large crowd. He demands again that Izzy gives him the rematch, and Izzy agrees. In the ring, Izzy responds to Rodney's mockery with cool analysis about Rodney\u2019s behavior as a loud-mouthed bully. He uses the tricks he honed in freestyle practice to dodge Rodney's attacks and push him against the ropes repeatedly, finally stating that they both had a lot to be mad about, but fighting would not improve matters. He leaves the ring, and Rodney angrily follows, but trips and falls. Everyone urges Izzy to finish him, but he refuses before leaving the gym. Rodney is impressed, admiring Izzy for standing up to him.\n\nThe Hot Chili Steppers come to the city finals with an abysmal replacement until Izzy shows up. He apologizes and Mary forgives him. The Dutch Dragons show up, with Yolanda and their leader, Gina ([[Paula Brancati]]), making snarky comments toward Mary and her teammates. Mary shows a new attitude, not letting it get to her. During the compulsory competition, the Steppers stun the Dragons by taking first place while the Dragons take second. The Dragons take first in the speed competition while the Steppers take second, which means the Freestyle round is the tiebreaker. Tammy shows up with Izzy's friends, Chuck and Earl ([[Mazin Elsadig]] and [[Micah Stephen Williams|Micah Williams]]), to support the Hot Chili Steppers. Rodney also comes to watch. Just before the freestyle routine, Izzy is surprised to see his father and Karin. The Hot Chili Steppers take the stage, with Izzy showing the skills he's learned, impressing his friends and family. After they finish their performance, Kenneth apologizes to Izzy, explaining that boxing was his way to stay close to Izzy after they lost Izzy's mom. He tells Izzy that he's proud of him, and the two make amends. Rodney also tells Izzy that he's impressed by the Double Dutch, and hopes Izzy can show him the moves he made in the ring. Izzy agrees, and they call a truce.\n\nThe results are announced, and the Dutch Dragons take second place. Before the winner is revealed, the screen suddenly freezes and cuts to a group of kids at the boxing gym, who are listening to Izzy's story narrated by Rodney. He tells them that the Hot Chili Steppers went to state, but didn't win until the next year, and Mary and Izzy are still together. As he sends the kids to gear up, Rodney remembers that day, revealing that the Hot Chili Steppers won. They happily accept their first-place trophy, stunning the Dutch Dragons. The movie ends with the Hot Chili Steppers and Karin teaching Kenneth how to Double Dutch.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Corbin Bleu]] as Isadore \"Izzy\" Daniels, a boxer and son of a widowed golden gloves champion.

Farm]]'', auditioned for and won an undisclosed role in the film but turned it down to instead star in the television series ''[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne]]'' as Jazmine Payne, after catching [[Tyler Perry]]'s attention.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=2011-05-10|title=Tween Stars Wanted: Must Be Primed for Pressure|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/arts/television/tween-stars-wanted-must-be-primed-for-pressure.html|access-date=2020-04-05|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=April 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403030646/https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/arts/television/tween-stars-wanted-must-be-primed-for-pressure.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"China\">{{cite web|title=China Anne McClain Bio|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/25662-china-anne-mcclain-bio|work=kidzworld.com|access-date=September 26, 2012|archive-date=November 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103044907/http://www.kidzworld.com/article/25662-china-anne-mcclain-bio|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Jump In!'' is the 69th [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] and went into production in 2006. Earlier titles for the film included \"Jump\", \"Jump In\" and \"Jump Start\", with some early trailers even showing the \"Jump Start\" title.\n\nIn the movie, Izzy Daniels is in a group called the Hot Chili Steppers. This is an obvious parody of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], a real-life rock band. The version in Spanish dubs the name Salto Extrapicante.\n\nPromotion for the film began in the Summer of 2006, with a poster appearing in the program for the ''[[High School Musical]]'' Tour. Advertisements highlighted Corbin Bleu's association with ''High School Musical'' and ran heavily during re-airings of that film. Several videos from the film were also put into heavy rotation on [[Disney Channel]], airing during breaks in regular programming.\n\nCorbin Bleu became very good at jumping and even performed some of his own stunts like the donkey kick and pushups, but he did have a stunt double for some of the jumping like back flips and individual jumping. At the end of the movie, Andy Royalle makes a guest appearance as one of the jump-ropers. During the final contest, an actual champion Double Dutch team from Brooklyn makes a cameo. They just happened to be in Toronto for a tournament at the same time the movie was being filmed.\n\n''Jump In!'' was the last Disney Channel Original Movie to use the 2002\u20132007 Disney Channel Movie intro; later DCOM films used the remixed version.\n\nThe story of ''Jump In!'' was originally written by Sherwyn Smith, who now works as a teacher at an elite private school on the Upper East Side of New York.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Reaction}}\n''Jump In!'' broke the record previously set by ''[[The Cheetah Girls 2]]'' as the highest rated DCOM premiere with 8.2 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Schneider |url=https://variety.com/2007/scene/news/shows-set-records-for-disney-1117957517/ |title=Shows set records for Disney |work=Variety |date=January 16, 2007 |access-date=2015-09-04 |archive-date=December 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051339/http://variety.com/2007/scene/news/shows-set-records-for-disney-1117957517/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=<!-- Staff report --> |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-17-nielsen-analysis_x.htm |title='24' blows up in the ratings |work=[[USA Today]] |date=January 17, 2007 |access-date=August 15, 2016 |quote='''Cable records.'''
