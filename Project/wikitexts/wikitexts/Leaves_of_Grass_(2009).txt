Meanwhile, Bill's identical twin brother Brady Kincaid (also played by Edward Norton) is living in Oklahoma, growing and selling hydroponic cannabis. Brady is under pressure from local drug lord Pug Rothbaum ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) to expand his sales. Despite needing money to repay a debt to Rothbaum, Brady refuses.\n\nAfter a phone call from Brady's partner Bolger ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]) telling him that Brady has died from a crossbow arrow, Bill flies to Tulsa, meeting a Jewish orthodontist on the plane. \nIn Tulsa, Bill is mistaken for Brady and is beaten up and knocked unconscious by rival marijuana dealers angry that Brady has taken half their territory. When Bill wakes, he finds that Brady is alive and has tricked him into travelling to Tulsa. Brady asks Bill to pretend to be Brady while he goes up state to \"take care\" of Rothbaum. Bill initially refuses, but later agrees, after meeting local poet Janet ([[Keri Russell]]) as he wants to stay and get to know her better.\n\nWhile Bill (pretending to be Brady) visits their mother, thus giving Brady an alibi, Bolger and Brady go to a synagogue in Tulsa, where Rothbaum is listening to a sermon. Also present is Ken Feinman ([[Josh Pais]]), the orthodontist Bill met on the plane. He sees Brady and mistakes him for Bill. Brady and Bolger leave with Rothbaum, and Rothbaum demands the money Brady owes him. When Rothbaum threatens to kill them if they don't pay up, Bolger shoots Rothbaum's thugs, and Brady stabs Rothbaum, killing him.\n\nIn Tulsa, Ken Feinman hears of Rothbaum's murder and figures everything out. He purchases a gun and sets off for Brady's house, where he encounters Bill and Brady and threatens to shoot them. Bill takes the gun from him but Ken panics and uses Bolger's rifle to shoot Brady, after which Bill shoots Ken in retaliation. Before dying, Brady tells Bill to place the gun in his hand, which Bill does.\n\nAfter an abortive attempt to sell Brady's dope-growing system to one of Brady's former rivals, Bill is shot through the chest by a crossbow. Bolger frantically drives him to hospital, saving Bill's life, and thereby repaying his debt to Brady (who had saved his life in prison). Bill is forced to stay in Tulsa for a long recuperation after his injury, allowing him time to heal his relationship with his mother and develop his romance with Janet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as identical twins Bill and Brady Kincaid\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Pug Rothbaum, a business partner of Brady's\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Daisy Kincaid, Bill and Brady's mother\n* [[Keri Russell]] as Janet, a friend of Brady's and Bill's new romantic interest\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Rick Bolger, Brady's best friend<ref name=leaves>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/artman2/publish/movie_news/Sarandon-and-Dreyfuss-to-smoke-Grass-16080908.php |title=Sarandon and Dreyfuss to smoke 'Grass' |last=Heath |first=Paul |date=September 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206085441/http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/artman2/publish/movie_news/Sarandon-and-Dreyfuss-to-smoke-Grass-16080908.php |archive-date=December 6, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Colleen, Brady's pregnant girlfriend\n* [[Steve Earle]] as Buddy Fuller, a rival drug dealer of Brady's\n* [[Lucy DeVito]] as Anne, a student in love with Bill\n* [[Lee Wilkof]] as Nathan Levy, Bill's prospective boss at a new university\n* [[Ken Cheeseman]] as Jimmy Fuller, a rival drug dealer of Brady's\n* [[Maggie Siff]] as Rabbi Renannah Zimmerman\n* [[Josh Pais]] as Ken Feinman\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as Professor Sorenson\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Big Joe Sharpe\n* Randal Reeder as Shaver\n}}\n\n===Credited songs===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n! style=\"width:38%;\"|Song Title\n! style=\"width:18%;\"|Performer \n! style=\"width:4%;\"|Written By\n|-\n|\"Stand Up\"\n|Doug Bossi\n|Doug Bossi\n|-\n|\"Illegal Smile\"\n|[[John Prine]]\n|John Prine\n|-\n|\"My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day\"\n|[[The Flatlanders]]\n|Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Butch Hancock, Dan Yates\n|-\n|\"Faithful and True\"\n|Richard Myhill\n|Richard Myhill\n|-\n|\"Fat Man In The Bathtub\"\n|[[Little Feat]]\n|Lowell George\n|-\n|\"Rex's Blues\"\n|[[Townes Van Zandt]]\n|Townes Van Zandt\n|-\n|\"Sailin' Shoes\"\n|Little Feat\n|Lowell George\n|-\n|\"Sweet Revenge\"\n|John Prine\n|John Prine\n|-\n|\"I Shall Be Released\"\n|[[The Band]]\n|[[Bob Dylan]]\n|-\n|\"Lonely Are The Free\"\n|[[Steve Earle]]\n|Steve Earle\n|-\n|\"Boys From Oklahoma\"\n|[[Cross Canadian Ragweed]]\n|Gene Collier\n|}\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]].
