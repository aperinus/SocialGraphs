In 2011, [[Lionsgate]] picked up the distribution rights. The film premiered in December 2011 at the [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]] film festival in [[Austin, Texas]] and was released in the United States on April 13, 2012, grossing over $66 million worldwide. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its screenplay, tone, and performances.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn an underground laboratory, engineers Gary Sitterson and Steve Hadley discuss plans for a mysterious ritual, after a similar operation in [[Stockholm]] has just ended in failure.\n\nAmerican college students Dana Polk, Jules Louden, Curt Vaughan, Holden McCrea, and Marty Mikalski are spending their weekend at Curt's cousin's cabin in the forest. From the lab, Sitterson and Hadley remotely control the cabin and manipulate the students by intoxicating them with mind-altering drugs that have effects such as hindering rational thinking and increasing [[libido]]. The lab departments take bets on what kind of monster will attack the students and discuss the failures of international operations. In the cabin's cellar, the group finds bizarre objects, including the diary of Patience Buckner, a cabin resident abused by her sadistic family. Dana recites [[incantation]]s from the diary and inadvertently summons the [[zombie|zombified]] Buckner family.\n\nHadley releases [[pheromone]]s to induce Curt and Jules to have sex outside. They are attacked by the zombies and Jules is decapitated while Curt escapes. Marty discovers concealed surveillance equipment in his room before being dragged off by a zombie. The lab workers learn that the rite in Japan has also failed, meaning that the American rite is \"humanity's last hope\". Curt, Holden, and Dana attempt to escape in their [[recreational vehicle|RV]], but Sitterson triggers a tunnel collapse to block them. Curt attempts to jump a ravine on his motorcycle to seek help on the other side, but crashes into a [[Force field (fiction)|force field]] and falls to his death. Holden and Dana realize that their experience is staged and controlled. As they try to escape in the RV, Holden is killed by a zombie, and Dana is attacked once the RV crashes into the lake.\n\nThe lab employees, seeing that Dana is the only survivor, celebrate the success of the rite, but are interrupted by a phone call from \"The Director\", revealing that Marty is still alive. Marty saves Dana and takes her to a hidden elevator he discovered. They descend into the lab and discover a large collection of different monsters locked in cages. Dana correlates them with the objects in the cabin's cellar and realizes that the objects determine which monsters are released. Cornered by security personnel, the pair release all the monsters, which wreak havoc and slaughter the staff; Hadley is killed by a [[merman]] while Dana accidentally stabs Sitterson, who bleeds to death.\n\nDana and Marty flee and discover an ancient temple, where they are confronted by The Director. She explains that worldwide annual rituals of human sacrifice are held to appease the Ancient Ones, a group of cruel subterranean deities. Each region has its own ritual, and the American ritual involves the sacrifice of five slasher film archetypes: the whore (Jules), the athlete (Curt), the scholar (Holden), the fool (Marty), and the virgin (Dana). The order of the killings is arbitrary as long as the whore dies first and [[final girl|the virgin dies last or survives]]. The Director urges Dana to kill Marty to complete the ritual and spare humanity, as all other rituals had failed that year. Dana is about to but is attacked by a [[werewolf]], while Patience kills The Director; Marty proceeds to kill all except Dana.\n\nDeciding that humanity is not worth saving at the price of human sacrifices, Dana apologizes to Marty for almost killing him and the two share a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] while awaiting their fate. The temple floor collapses and a giant hand emerges from the ground, destroying the facility and the cabin as the world ends.<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kristen Connolly]] as Dana Polk, a college student designated as \"The Virgin\"\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as Curt Vaughan, a sociology major and football jock, designated as \"The Athlete\"\n* [[Anna Hutchison]] as Jules Louden, a pre-medical college student and Curt's girlfriend, designated as \"The Whore\"\n* [[Fran Kranz]] as Marty Mikalski, a college student designated as \"The Fool\"\n* [[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]] as Holden McCrea, Curt's football teammate, designated as \"The Scholar\"\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Gary Sitterson, Facility technician\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Steve Hadley, Facility technician\n* [[Brian J.

[[Joss Whedon]] co-wrote the script with ''[[Cloverfield]]'' screenwriter [[Drew Goddard]], who also directed the film, marking his directorial debut. Goddard previously worked with Whedon on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' as a writer.\n\nWhedon described the film as an attempt to revitalize the horror genre. He called it a \"loving hate letter\" to the genre, continuing:<ref>{{cite web |last=Film |first=Total |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/joss-whedon-talks-the-cabin-in-the-woods |title=Joss Whedon talks The Cabin in the Woods |publisher=TotalFilm.com |access-date=December 26, 2018 |date=June 6, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222033050/https://gamesradar.com/joss-whedon-talks-the-cabin-in-the-woods/ |archive-date=February 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|... it's a serious critique of what we love and what we don't about horror movies. I love being scared. I love that mixture of thrill, of horror, that objectification/identification thing of wanting definitely for the people to be all right but at the same time hoping they'll go somewhere dark and face something awful. The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had swung a little too far in that direction.}}\n\nConcerning the sheer number of creatures to be designed and made for the film, AFX Studio's [[David LeRoy Anderson]] estimated that \"close to a thousand\" people were turned into one of around 60 different monster types.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cabin in the Woods: The Official Visual Companion |year=2012 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=9781848565241 |page=152}}</ref> The task necessitated renting a much larger facility to use as a workspace, as a crew of around 60 people were recruited. The producers told them to commence work on December 15, 2008, ahead of the official January 1, 2009, start date. They only completed the work by the March 9, 2009, production date because, as Anderson stated \"We had nearly seventy people at peak, but in effect we had a hundred and forty people, because everybody had at least two jobs...it was crazy, but people had an incredible time...none of us are ever going to forget it, and we're never all going to be in the same room again.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cabin in the Woods: The Official Visual Companion |year=2012 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=9781848565241 |page=153}}</ref>\n\nThe underground complex, elevators, and the control room were all sets, but for several wide shots, the [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]]'s Aerospace building was used. Production designer Martin Whist referred to [[Stanley Kubrick]] and commented: \"It's very high-tech industrial, and it's a brand new building, never been shot in before...I wanted [the elevators] to be without any controls...to almost feel like a glamorized freight elevator...The lobby I wanted to look slightly utilitarian, contemporary and institutional...sharp and almost characterless.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cabin in the Woods: The Official Visual Companion |year=2012 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=9781848565241 |pages=134\u2013137}}</ref>\n\nA tie-in of the film with the video game ''[[Left 4 Dead 2]]'' had been planned, with the game seeing [[downloadable content]] based on the movie's settings.
