The Imperial Japanese Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the [[Nanking massacre]]. As the Japanese overrun the [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese army]], desperate schoolgirls flee to the sanctuary of their [[convent]] at a Western-run [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral. John Miller, an American [[mortician]] on a job to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls.  He finds George, an orphan boy who was raised by the dead priest and taught English. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while repairing the convent's truck to escape.\n\nAfter an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate and requests that the schoolgirls sing a [[chorale]] for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the [[virgin]]al schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13.\n\nWhen the [[de facto]] leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan, convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo, convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party. As there are only 12 prostitutes, George, the dead priest's adoptive son, volunteers as well. Miller initially opposes their self-sacrificial decision but relents and assists in disguising them, using his skills as a mortician to adjust their makeup and cut their hair to appear like schoolgirls. The prostitutes also create knives out of broken windows and hide them in their cloaks.\n\nThe next day, the \"13 Flowers of Nanking\" are led away by the unsuspecting Japanese soldiers. After they depart, Miller hides the schoolgirls on the truck he repaired and using a single-person permit provided by the father of a schoolgirl, drives out of Nanking. In the last scene, the truck is seen driving on a deserted highway heading west, away from the Japanese army. The fate of the 13 Flowers remains unknown, apparently martyring themselves for the schoolgirls' freedom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Christian Bale]] as John Miller\n* [[Ni Ni]] as Yu Mo\n* Zhang Xinyi as Shu\n* [[Tong Dawei]] as Major Li\n* [[Atsuro Watabe]] as Colonel Hasegawa\n* [[Shigeo Kobayashi]] as Lieutenant Kato\n* Cao Kefan as Mr. Meng\n* Huang Tianyuan as George Chen\n* Han Xiting as Yi\n* Zhang Doudou as Ling\n* Yuan Yangchunzi as Mosquito\n* Sun Jia as Hua\n* Li Yuemin as Dou\n* Bai Xue as Lan\n* Takashi Yamanaka as Lieutenant Asakura\n* Hirofumi Yasunaga as Japanese Soldier\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Terry\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn December 2010, it was announced that the film would be made, and [[pre-production]] started the same month.
