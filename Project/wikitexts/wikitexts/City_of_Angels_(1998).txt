Set in Los Angeles, California, the film is a loose [[remake]] of [[Wim Wenders]]' 1987 film ''[[Wings of Desire]]'' (''Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin''), which was set in Berlin. As with the original, ''City of Angels'' tells the story of an angel (Cage) who falls in love with a mortal woman (Ryan), and wishes to become human in order to be with her. With the guidance of a man ([[Dennis Franz]]) who has already made the transition from immortality, the angel [[fallen angel|falls]] and discovers the human experience.\n\nWhen producer [[Dawn Steel]] saw potential to pursue more story ideas in Wenders' original concept, she and her husband [[Charles Roven]] acquired the rights for an English-language adaptation. After years of delay, they found support from [[Warner Bros.]] and recruited Silberling and screenwriter [[Dana Stevens (screenwriter)|Dana Stevens]] to execute the project. Themes were borrowed from Wenders' work, though the ending was altered, to a more tragic effect. ''City of Angels'' was filmed around California and dedicated to Steel, who died before the premiere.\n\nThe remake was released to financial success, but mixed reviews, with some critics judging it to be a mawkish adaptation. It was also noted for [[City of Angels (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]], and nominated for several awards, particularly for its performances and soundtrack.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Los Angeles]], California, Seth is one of many [[angel]]s who watches over humans, protecting them in unseen ways. His main responsibility is to appear to those who are [[near-death experience|close to death]] and [[psychopomp|guide]] them to the next life.\n\nDuring this task, Seth and one of his fellow angels, [[Cassiel]], ask people what their favorite thing in life was. Despite these daily encounters, they have trouble understanding human beings and their ways, as angels lack human senses.\n\nWhile waiting to escort a man undergoing heart surgery to the other world, Seth is impressed by the vigorous efforts of the surgeon, Maggie Rice, to save the ill-fated man's life and her sincere anguish at her failure to do so. Seth soon becomes focused on Maggie and becomes visible to her. They develop a connection, which soon turns to mutual attraction, although Maggie is already involved with one of her colleagues, Jordan Ferris.\n\nSeth then meets Nathaniel Messinger, one of Maggie's patients, who senses Seth's presence. He tells him that he, too, had once been an angel. But, as [[free will]] is granted equally to mortals and angels, he decided to become human by \"[[fallen angel|falling]]\". Seth begins to consider being with Maggie, and she learns that he is an angel.\n\n[[File:A view of Lake Tahoe from Crystal bay.JPG|225px|thumb|[[Lake Tahoe]] is featured in the film.]]\nSeth becomes human by jumping from the top of a skyscraper. Immediately upon awakening, he starts to experience many  human feelings and sensations that he had never been able to understand, beginning with physical pain. As a human, Seth heads to the hospital to see Maggie but is told she has gone to her uncle's mountain cabin at Lake Tahoe.\n\nPenniless and na\u00efve, he cannot pay for the journey and gets mugged. He eventually hitches a ride to [[Lake Tahoe]] and appears, soaked and cold, at Maggie's doorstep. She realizes he has become mortal for her love, and they have sex. The next morning, as Seth is showering, Maggie rides her bicycle to a local store. On her way back, happy and fulfilled, riding her bicycle with her eyes closed and her arms wide open. Her happiness is cut when she fails to notice a [[logging truck]] crossing her path and is mortally wounded in the collision.\n\nSeth senses that Maggie is in trouble and runs to her aid. He arrives in time for her to tell him she sees the angel who has come to accompany her. Although Seth can no longer see angels, he senses one nearby and frantically begs Maggie not to look at him/her. She tells him she is not afraid anymore and that when they ask her what her favorite thing in life was, she will say it was Seth, before she dies.\n\nGrieving and alone, Seth is visited by Cassiel. He asks if he is being punished for becoming human, which Cassiel assures him is not the case. Sometime later, Seth expresses his joy in being human and the fact that he has accepted his new life by running into the ocean, feeling the waves at dawn, in sight of the angels.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Nicolas Cage - KirkWeaver.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Nicolas Cage]] stars as Seth.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

However, author Scott Culpepper argues this is not related to evil or exile from heaven, and is instead based on [[free will]].{{sfn|Culpepper|2016|p=28}} The fact that Maggie is killed very shortly after Seth's transformation poses the question of whether Seth left \"heaven for ashes\", but the conclusion is that \"the very temporality of relationships, experiences and feelings are what make them meaningful\".{{sfn|Culpepper|2016|p=28}} Seth's realization is followed by the concluding scene in which he dives into the ocean, and the otherwise \"stoic\" Cassiel smiles for him. Sociologists [[Albert Bergesen]] and [[Andrew Greeley]] write that this communicates \"not only the glory of being alive ... but the seeming approval by heaven of that choice\".{{sfn|Bergesen|Greeley|2017|p=115}}\n\nWriter [[Brian Godawa]] interprets the film as having a \"humanistic worldview\" in which physical experiences humans can enjoy have more value to angels than the spiritual. However, Godawa feels this contradicts [[1 Peter 1]]:12, where \"things which angels desire to look into\" are spiritual truths in the gospel of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|Godawa|2011|p=242}} Encyclopedist Andrew Tate writes Maggie is a surgeon with no spiritual faith and, through Seth, she \"learns to trust the invisible\", while Seth learns the wonders of life through her.{{sfn|Tate|2011|p=24}}\n\n[[File:Paradise Lost 10.jpg|150px|thumb|Professor Christopher R.
