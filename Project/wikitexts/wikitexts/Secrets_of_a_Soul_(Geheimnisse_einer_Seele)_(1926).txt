W. Pabst]].\n\n==Plot==\nMartin Fellman, a learned professor, experiences nightmares that make him believe he is going insane. He fears that he is on the verge of murdering his wife, who loves him dearly. He hires Dr. Orth, a psychiatrist, to help him work out his psychoses.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Werner Krauss]] as Martin Fellman\n* [[Ruth Weyher]] as Seine Frau\n* [[Ilka Gr\u00fcning]] as Die Mutter\n* [[Jack Trevor]] as Erich\n* [[Pavel Pavlov (actor)|Pavel Pavlov]] as Dr. Orth (as Pawel Pawloff)\n* [[Hertha von Walther]] as Fellmans {{lang|de|Assistentin}}\n* [[Renate Brausewetter]] as Dienstm\u00e4dchen\n* Colin Ross as Kriminalkommissar\n* [[Lili Damita]] (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n''Secrets of a Soul'''s producer [[Hans Neumann]] was a firm believer in the theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and tried to get Freud to participate in the making of the film. Freud did not respond, so he hired [[Karl Abraham]], a close associate of Freud's, as an adviser on the project, to help Neumann make the most psychologically realistic film possible.<ref name=\"Tome304\" />\n\nThe film was shot between September and November 1925,<ref name=\"filmportal\" /> and was released in Berlin on 24 March 1926.<ref name=\"filmportal\" />\n\n==Reception==\nFrom retrospective reviews, [[Tom Milne]] in the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' stated the film is split into \"roughly three unequal parts\" commenting that the \"first and best, combining psychological subtlety and stark dramatic effect in the manner that was to become Pabst's trademark, is the opening sequence\" while calling the final sequence of the film a \"truly hideous final sequence, a tacked-on happy ending.\" Milne concluded that the film sees Pabst \"engaged on a trial run for the much more integrated approach to the unconscious and its aberrations which lowered in ''[[The Love of Jeanne Ney]]'', ''[[The Devious Path|Crisis]]'' and ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]''.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Geheimnisse einer Seele (Secrets of a Soul)|page=134|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=June 1979|volume=46|issue=545|last=Milne|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Milne}}</ref>\n\nTroy Howarth commented in his book ''Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era'' that the film was \"a reasonably compelling psychological thriller\" and that \"Krauss is too old for the part, which requires the viewer to believe that he's married to a childhood sweetheart easily 20 years younger than he is.\"<ref name=\"Tome304\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0016914|title=Secrets of a Soul}}\n\n{{Georg Wilhelm Pabst}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secrets Of A Soul}}\n[[Category:1926 films]]\n[[Category:1926 drama films]]\n[[Category:German silent feature films]]\n[[Category:German black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by G.
