The head of the team working on this treatment, Doctor Atsuko Chiba, begins using the machine illegally to help psychiatric patients outside the research facility, by assuming her dream world [[alter-ego]]/other personality \"Paprika\". Chiba's closest allies are Doctor Toratar\u014d Shima, the chief of the department, and Doctor K\u014dsaku Tokita, the inventor of the DC Mini.\n\nPaprika counsels Detective Toshimi Konakawa, who is plagued by a recurring dream. She gives Konakawa a card with the name of a website on it. Because they are unfinished prototypes, the DC Minis lack access restrictions, allowing anyone to enter another person's dreams, which poses grave consequences when they are stolen. Shima goes on a nonsensical tirade and jumps through a window, nearly killing himself. Upon examining Shima's dream, which is a parade of random objects, Tokita recognizes his assistant, Kei Himuro, which confirms their suspicion that the theft was an inside job.\n\nWhen two other scientists fall victim to the DC Mini, the company's chairman, Doctor Seijir\u014d Inui, who was against the project to begin with, bans the use of the device. This fails to hinder the crazed parade, now inside Himuro's dream, which claims Tokita. Paprika and Shima discover that Himuro is only an empty shell. The real culprit is Inui, who believes that he must protect dreams from humankind's influence through dream therapy, with the help of Doctor Morio Osanai.\n\nPaprika is captured by the pair after an exhausting chase. Osanai obsessively confesses his love for Chiba and peels away Paprika's skin to reveal Chiba underneath. However, he is interrupted by the outraged Inui who demands that they finish off Chiba; as the two share Osanai's body, they battle for control. Konakawa enters the dream and flees with Chiba back into his own recurring dream. Osanai gives chase, which ends in Konakawa shooting Osanai to take control of the dream. The act kills Osanai's physical body in the real world.\n\nDreams and reality begin to merge. The dream parade runs amok in the city, and reality starts to unravel. Shima is nearly killed by a giant Japanese doll, but is saved by Paprika, who has become separate from Chiba. Amidst the chaos, Tokita, in the form of a giant robot, eats Chiba and prepares to do the same to Paprika. A ghostly apparition of Chiba appears and reveals that she has been in love with Tokita and has been repressing these emotions. She comes to terms with her repressed desires, reconciling herself with the part of her that is Paprika. Inui returns in the form of a giant humanoid nightmare, reveals his twisted dreams of [[omnipotence]], and threatens to darken the world with his delusions. Paprika throws herself into Tokita's body. A baby emerges from the robotic shell and consumes Inui, aging into a fully-grown combination of Chiba and Paprika as she does so, then fades away, ending the nightmare.\n\nIn the final scene, Chiba sits at Tokita's bedside as he wakes up. Later, Konakawa visits the website from Paprika's card and receives a message from Paprika: \"Atsuko will change her surname to Tokita...and I suggest watching the movie ''Dreaming Kids''.\" Konakawa enters a movie theater and purchases a ticket for ''Dreaming Kids''.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Megumi Hayashibara]] as {{nihongo|Doctor Atsuko Chiba|\u5343\u8449 \u6566\u5b50\u535a\u58eb|Chiba Atsuko-hakase}}, an attractive and modest psychiatrist and researcher at the Institute for Psychiatric Research.

wanted his pictures to be more abstract than realistic, so that they would \"look like that.\"<ref name=\"animeanime56083\"/>\nIn other words, the screen full of reality that the audience feels as if it is real is just a \"picture\" for Kon, and because it is animation, there is essentially no distinction between reality and fiction in its expression.<ref name=\"animeanime56083\"/>\nThis gap is what gives birth to the \"tricks\" that support Satoshi Kon's works.<ref name=\"animeanime56083\"/>\nThe relationship between \"fiction and reality\" in Kon's work is that real pictures that make you

unique to anime.<ref name=\"animeanime56083\"/>\nHowever, what makes this work different from Kon's other works is that it has a deeper relationship between \"dream\" and \"reality,\" where \"dream\" and \"reality\" are each transformed into the existence of the other.<ref name=\"animeanime56083\"/>\nIn the film, the \"dream\" is represented as a \"distorted reality reflecting the unconscious desires of the dreamer,\" and the trick is to transform the \"reality\" into the \"dream\" by adding distortions at the level of the picture, and the \"dream\" into the \"reality\" by correcting the distortions.<ref name=\"animeanime56083\"/>\n\nIn this film, Kon's core theme is the duality, multifacetedness, contrast, and the balance between them, which he intentionally incorporated into the
