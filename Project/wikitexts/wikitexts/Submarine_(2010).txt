When Jordana invites Oliver to meet secretly after school, she takes pictures of them kissing, hoping to make her ex-boyfriend jealous. He reacts by putting Oliver in a headlock and punching him at school whilst they are surrounded by other pupils. Jordana soon becomes Oliver's girlfriend and after a couple of weeks they have sex in his bedroom whilst his parents are out.\n\nAt home, Oliver becomes concerned about his parents. His father, Lloyd ([[Noah Taylor]]), is depressed. New-age guru Graham ([[Paddy Considine]]), an ex-boyfriend of his mother, Jill ([[Sally Hawkins]]), has moved in next door, and his flirtations rouse Oliver's suspicions.\n\nOliver's relationship with Jordana grows, but he learns that her mother has a potentially fatal brain tumour. At an early Christmas dinner at Jordana's house, he witnesses her father break down. Unsettled, he decides that the Jordana he loves is at risk because the emotional events surrounding her will \"make her gooey (sentimental) in the middle.\" He cuts off contact with her.\n\nThinking that his mother and Graham are having an affair, Oliver attempts to repair his parents' relationship. While searching for his mother on the beach, he is stunned to see Jordana with another boy. Horrified, he heads home and on the way, he sees his mother with Graham and assumes the worst. Enraged, he breaks into Graham's house, gets drunk, and commits minor acts of vandalism. When Graham comes home, he finds Oliver but returns him home with minimal fuss. The next morning, Oliver awakes to see that both his parents aren't angry with him and are reconciling.\n\nOliver remains distraught about losing Jordana; he is downhearted for weeks, until he sees her on the beach. Running towards her, he explains his actions and learns that Jordana has either broken up with her new boyfriend or never had one. Together, they walk several inches deep into the sea, smiling.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Craig Roberts]] as Oliver Tate\n*[[Yasmin Paige]] as Jordana Bevan\n*[[Sally Hawkins]] as Jill Tate\n*[[Noah Taylor]] as Lloyd Tate\n*[[Paddy Considine]] as Graham Purvis\n*[[Gemma Chan]] as Kim-Lin\n*[[Melanie Walters]] as Jude Bevan\n*[[Steffan Rhodri]] as Mr. Davey\n*[[Ben Stiller]] as Soap Opera Star (Uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\n[[Michael Sheen]] and ''[[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]]'' contestant [[Lucie Jones]] were originally cast in the film but dropped out due to other commitments.<ref>{{cite news| title = X Factor's Lucie Jones 'to appear in film with Michael Sheen | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2009-09-28 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/x-factor/6236289/X-Factors-Lucie-Jones-to-appear-in-film-with-Michael-Sheen.html | access-date = 2010-12-21 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title = Web auditions for Sheen film cast | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 2009-08-14 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/8196415.stm | access-date = 2010-12-21 }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was produced by [[Warp Films]] and [[Film4 Productions]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Shooting begins on comedy Submarine | work = [[UK Film Council]] | date = 2009-10-26 | url = http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/article/16245/2009?show=16049&page=2&step=10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110218173452/http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/article/16245/2009?show=16049&page=2&step=10 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2011-02-18 | access-date = 2010-12-21 }}</ref> Principal photography began on 26 October 2009 and filming finished in December 2009.

It flaunts some stylistic devices, such as titles and sections and self-aware narration, but it doesn't try too hard to be desperately clever. It's a self-confident work for the first-time director, Richard Ayoade, whose purpose I think is to capture that delicate moment in some adolescent lives when idealism and trust lead to tentative experiments. Because Craig Roberts and Yasmin Paige are enormously likable in their roles, they win our sympathy and make us realize that too many movies about younger teenagers are filtered through the sensibility of more weathered minds.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Haws |first=Marie |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110608/REVIEWS/110609987 |title=Submarine Movie Review & Film Summary (2011) &#124; Roger Ebert |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= 8 June 2011|access-date=2013-11-28}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://warpfilms.com/feature/submarine/}}\n*{{IMDb title|1440292}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|submarine_2010}}\n\n{{Richard Ayoade}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Submarine}}\n[[Category:2010 films]]\n[[Category:2010 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s teen comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s teen romance films]]\n[[Category:British coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British teen comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:British teen romance films]]\n[[Category:Coming-of-age romance films]]\n[[Category:English-language Welsh films]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films about infidelity]]\n[[Category:Films about marriage]]\n[[Category:Films about virginity]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Ayoade]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1997]]\n[[Category:Films set in Swansea]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Swansea]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Wales]]\n[[Category:Film4 Productions films]]\n[[Category:Red Hour Productions films]]\n[[Category:2010 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Andrew Hewitt]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s British films]]"}]}}}}
