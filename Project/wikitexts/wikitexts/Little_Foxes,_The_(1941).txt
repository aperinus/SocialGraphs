The [[screenplay]] by [[Lillian Hellman]] is based on her 1939 play ''[[The Little Foxes]]''. Hellman's ex-husband [[Arthur Kober]], [[Dorothy Parker]] and her husband [[Alan Campbell (screenwriter)|Alan Campbell]] contributed additional scenes and dialogue.<ref name=TCM>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/81524/The-Little-Foxes/articles.html |title=Articles: The Little Foxes (1941) |first=Margarita |last=Landazuri |website=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1900, in the cotton country of the deep South, beautiful and brilliant Regina Hubbard Giddens ([[Bette Davis]]) struggles for wealth and freedom within the confines of an early 20th-century society where fathers only considered sons as legal heirs. As a result, thanks to their ruthless tradesman father, her [[avarice|avaricious]] brothers, Benjamin ([[Charles Dingle]]) and Oscar ([[Carl Benton Reid]]), are independently wealthy, while she is financially dependent upon her sickly husband, Horace ([[Herbert Marshall]]), whose severe heart condition has confined him to a sanitarium in Baltimore for several years.\n\nWhen the film begins, the Hubbards are expecting a dinner guest, William Marshall, a prominent businessman from Chicago. Ben and Oscar persuade him to build a cotton mill in their town, making them multimillionaires. Marshall invites Regina to visit him in Chicago. After he leaves, she reveals that she plans to move there, taking her daughter, Alexandra ([[Teresa Wright]]), with her.\n\nRegina proceeds to drive a hard bargain with her brothers for a larger percentage of the mill in exchange for persuading Horace to help finance it, to the tune of $75,000. She sends Alexandra to Baltimore to bring her father home, supposedly because Regina misses him. Regina and Horace's reunion does not go well: She cannot wait to ask him for the money. He has an attack, and still she presses, destroying any illusion that she really wanted him home. Horace tells the three siblings he wants no part of it.\n\nOscar, having married and abused the sweet-souled, fragile, now-alcoholic Birdie ([[Patricia Collinge]]) to acquire her family's [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] and its cotton fields, now schemes to consolidate the family wealth by a marriage between his son, Leo ([[Dan Duryea]]), and Alexandra, but neither Horace nor Regina like the idea.\n\nWhile the two of them argue upstairs, the brothers find an alternative. Leo, a teller at the bank, will \u201cborrow\u201d Horace's [[railroad]] [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] from his safe deposit box. They will use them as security for the construction, returning them long before it is time to [[Coupon (finance)|clip the coupons]]. Gloating, Ben tells a furious, bewildered Regina they don't need her. Horace overhears. He is glad not to be a part of wrecking the town. Regina's anger is icy cold: \u201cI hope you die soon,\u201d she says. Distraught, Alexandra tells her father not to listen.\n\n[[File:Bette davis the little foxes.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Bette Davis]] in ''The Little Foxes'']]\n\nAfter an impromptu trip to the bank, Horace discovers that the bonds are missing. When he tells Regina what happened, she is delighted at having a scandal to hold over her brothers' heads, until Horace tells her he will say he lent the bonds to Leo, on her behalf. He is changing his will, leaving the bonds to Regina and everything else to Alexandra. She admits to Horace she never loved him, and only married him for money, and the bitter, ugly words bring on a heart attack. He spills his medicine, and Regina sits, motionless, as he staggers to the stairs and collapses halfway up. Now Regina rushes to him, calling for the servants to take him to his room and go for Doctor Sloan. Horace dies leaving no one to contradict Regina if she accuses her brothers of theft. She forces them to give her 75% ownership of the business. A bewildered Alexandra overhears this. \u201cWhat was Poppa doing on the staircase?\u201d Ben accepts the deal philosophically. As they leave, he agrees with Alexandra, \u201cWhat was Horace doing on the stairs?\u201d\n\n[[File:Bette Davis and Herbert Marshall \"The Little Foxes\" (1941).jpg|thumb|left|Bette Davis and Herbert Marshall]]\n\nRegina is going to Chicago. Refusing to accompany her, Alexandra recalls their maid, Addie, saying that there are people who eat the earth and people who stand by and watch. She won't watch. Frustrated, Regina tells her daughter that she can not control her. She hopes that Alexandra will stay, but in any case she is going to have the life for which she has yearned all her life. Regina pauses on the stairs, staring at Horace's room, and asks Alexandra if she would like to sleep in her room.  \u201cWhy, mama, are you afraid?\u201c\n\nAlexandra's relationship with her childhood friend, journalist David Hewitt ([[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]]), her coming of age under his influence and their growing love arcs throughout the film. Now, she walks away with him, into the rainy night.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Regina Hubbard Giddens\n* [[Herbert Marshall]] as Horace Giddens\n* [[Teresa Wright]] as Alexandra \"Zannie\" Giddens\n* [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] as David Hewitt\n* [[Dan Duryea]] as Leo Hubbard\n* [[Patricia Collinge]] as Birdie Hubbard\n* [[Charles Dingle]] as Ben Hubbard\n* [[Carl Benton Reid]] as Oscar Hubbard\n* [[Jessica Grayson]] as Addie (as Jessie Grayson)\n* [[John Marriott (actor)|John Marriott]] as Cal\n* [[Russell Hicks (actor)|Russell Hicks]] as William Marshall\n* [[Lucien Littlefield]] as Manders\n* [[Virginia Brissac]] as Mrs. Hewitt\n* Terry Nibert as Julia\n* Henry 'Hot Shot' Thomas as Harold\n* [[Charles R.

Producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]] agreed, since none of Bankhead's films had been box office hits. (Coincidentally, Davis had recreated on film another of Bankhead's Broadway roles, Judith Traherne in ''[[Dark Victory (play)|Dark Victory]]''.) However, Davis was reluctant: \"On ''The Little Foxes'' I begged the producer, Samuel Goldwyn, to let Tallulah Bankhead play Regina because Tallulah was magnificent on the stage. He wouldn't let her.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUFplyZZAZsC&pg=PA219 |title=All About All About Eve: The Complete Behind-the-Scenes Story of the Bitchiest Film Ever Made! |first=Sam |last=Staggs |date=23 June 2001 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |via=Google Books |isbn=978-1466830431}}</ref> Initially [[Jack L. Warner]] refused to lend Davis to Goldwyn, who then offered the role to [[Miriam Hopkins]].<ref name=Higham>Higham 1981, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> When Wyler refused to work with her, Goldwyn resumed negotiations with Warner and finally secured Davis for $385,000. As a contract player at [[Warner Bros.]], Davis was earning $3,000 a week, and when she discovered how much Warner had received for her appearance in ''Foxes'', she demanded and ultimately received a share of the payment.<ref name=\"Stine\" />\n\nWyler encouraged Davis to see Bankhead in the original play, which she did despite major misgivings. She later regretted doing so because after watching Bankhead's performance and reading Hellman's screenplay she felt compelled to create a totally different interpretation of the role, one she didn't feel suited the character. Bankhead had portrayed Regina as a victim forced to fight for her survival due to the contempt with which her brothers treated her, but Davis played her as a cold, conniving, calculating woman wearing a death mask of white powder she insisted makeup artist [[Perc Westmore]] create for her.<ref name=Higham />\n\nIn her autobiography, ''A Lonely Life'', Davis gave a different version about having to see Bankhead in the play. \"A great admirer of hers, I wanted in no way to be influenced by her work. It was Willie's intention that I give a different interpretation of the part. I insisted that Tallulah had played it the only way it could be played. Miss Hellman's Regina was written with such definition that it could only be played one way.\"<ref>Davis 1962, p. 207.</ref> \"I had to do that part exactly the way Tallulah did it, because that's the way Lillian Hellman wrote it. But I was always sad that Tallulah couldn't record Regina from the theatre, because she was marvelous.\"\n\n[[File:The-Little-Foxes-Breakfast.jpg|thumb|Tallulah Bankhead, [[Charles Dingle]], [[Carl Benton Reid]] and [[Dan Duryea]] in the original Broadway production of ''The Little Foxes'' (1939)]]\n[[Charles Dingle]], [[Carl Benton Reid]], [[Dan Duryea]], and [[Patricia Collinge]] all reprised their critically acclaimed Broadway performances. Critics preferred Bankhead's rendition of the role to Davis's, though the supporting cast was highly praised. The character of David Hewitt was not in the original play. Hellman created him to add a second sympathetic male to stand alongside Horace among all the venomous Hubbard men.\n\nDavis and Wyler frequently fought during filming, about everything from her appearance (Wyler thought she looked like a [[Kabuki]] performer, but Davis wanted to look older than her age as the part was written for a 40-year-old) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a more feminine and sympathetic Regina, akin to Tallulah's interpretation). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of ''The Letter'', but this time she held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. \"It was the only time in my career that I walked out on a film after the shooting had begun,\" she later recalled. \"I was a nervous wreck due to the fact that my favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way ... I just didn't want to continue.\"<ref name=Stine /> The actress retreated to her rented house in [[Laguna Beach]] and \"''flatly'' refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to sue me for the ''entire'' cost of the production.\"<ref name=Stine /> A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by [[Katharine Hepburn]] or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress.<ref name=Higham /> Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s, she and Wyler never worked together again.<ref name=TCM /><ref name=Stine /><ref name=Higham />\nThe film premiered at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported it was seen by 22,163 persons on its opening day, setting what was then an all-time attendance mark for a normal opening day at the theatre.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1941/08/23/archives/film-record-set-by-little-foxes-22163-persons-saw-movie-at-music.html \"Film record set by 'Little Foxes'; 22,163 Persons Saw Movie at Music Hall on Thursday, a New Opening Day Mark.\"] ''The New York Times'', August 22, 1941.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Hellman wrote the play ''[[Another Part of the Forest]]'', a [[prequel]] to ''Foxes''. It was [[Another Part of the Forest (film)|adapted for the screen in 1948]].\n\nIn 2003, the character of Regina Giddens, played by Davis, was ranked No. 43 on the [[American Film Institute]] list of the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|50 Best Villains of American Cinema]].\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]] observed,\n{{blockquote|Lillian Hellman's grim and malignant melodrama... has now been translated to the screen with all its original viciousness intact ... [It] leaps to the front as the most bitingly sinister picture of the year and as one of the most cruelly realistic character studies yet shown on the screen ... Mr. Wyler, with the aid of Gregg Toland, has used the camera to sweep in the myriad small details of a mauve decadent household and the more indicative facets of the many characters... Miss Davis's performance in the role which Talluluh Bankhead played so brassily on the stage is abundant with color and mood... she does occasionally drop an unmistakable imitation of her predecessor... Better than that, however, are the other members of the cast. Charles Dingle as Brother Ben Hubbard, the oldest and sharpest of the rattlesnake clan, is the perfect villain in respectable garb. Carl Benton Reid as Brother Oscar is magnificently dark, sullen and undependable. Patricia Collinge repeats her excellent stage performance... ''The Little Foxes'' will not increase your admiration for mankind. It is cold and cynical. But it is a very exciting picture to watch in a comfortably objective way, especially if you enjoy expert stabbing-in-the-back.<ref>Crowther, Bosley.
