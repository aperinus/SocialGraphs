Brooks]]. While a large part of the film is a [[satire (film and television)|satire]] of the film industry, it also skewers relationships from various angles. Its primary plot concerns a down-on-his-luck actor who suddenly finds himself the sole caretaker of his six-year-old daughter.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1980, on the night he fails to win an [[Emmy Award]], Matt Hobbs proposes to his longtime girlfriend Beth. He says the only thing holding him back is his dedication to his career, one which may not always work out, and Beth says that's one of the things she loves most about him. Seven years later, with a baby crying and no job for Matt, Beth is overflowing with resentment. By 1993, the pair have been divorced for several years and are living on opposite coasts. Matt auditions for a role in pompous, self-absorbed, and clueless [[film producer]] Burke Adler's new project but fails to get the part. He does however agree to [[chauffeur]] Adler occasionally. Matt flies to [[Georgia (United States)|Georgia]] to pick up his daughter Jeannie for what he believes is a brief visit and discovers Beth is facing a prison term and Jeannie will be living with him for the duration of her sentence. The two return to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] and struggle with their new circumstances and building a relationship (Matt hasn't seen the six-year-old since she was four).  When Matt goes in to make a screen test for a lead in a film, he leaves Jeannie with a friend at the studio, and when he picks her up he's stunned to learn she's been cast in a sitcom. There are multiple sub-plots, including one focusing on Matt's relationship with staff script-reader Cathy Breslow and another concerning [[test screening]] analyst Nan Mulhanney and her tumultuous relationship with Adler.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nick Nolte]] - Matt Hobbs\n* [[Whittni Wright]] - Jeannie Hobbs \n* [[Albert Brooks]] - Burke Adler\n* [[Julie Kavner]] - Nan Mulhanney\n* [[Joely Richardson]] - Cathy Breslow\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] - Beth Hobbs\n* [[Chelsea Field]] - Screen-Test Actress\n* [[Joely Fisher]] - Female D Person\n* [[Vicki Lewis]] - Millie\n* [[Anne Heche]] - Claire\n* [[Ian McKellen]] - John Earl McAlpine\n* [[Angela Alvarado]] - Lucy\n* Joel Thurm - Martin\n* Dominik Lukas-Espeleta - Ricky\n* Justina Hardesty - Essa\n* [[Robert Joy]] - U.S. Marshal\n* [[Maria Pitillo]] - Flight Attendant\n* [[Suzzanne Douglas]] - Rainbow House Star\n* [[Joseph Malone (actor)|Joseph Malone]] - Assistant Director\n* [[Jake Busey]] - Burke's Fired Driver\n* [[Harry Shearer]] - Audience Research Captain\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] - Make-Up Person\n* [[Ken Page]] - Hair Person\n* [[Perry Anzilotti]] - Rainbow House Supporting Actor\n* Wren T.

Brooks]] as an old-fashioned [[musical film|movie musical]] and parody of \"Hollywood lifestyles and movie clich\u00e9s\", costing $40 million.<ref name=any>{{cite news|title=Anything to save the movie James L. Brooks dumped the music, rewrote the scenes and did more filming for 'I'll Do Anything'|date=1994-02-03|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]|author=Robert W.

Brooks noted: \"Something like this not only tries one's soul - it threatens one's soul.\"<ref name=any/>\nHe later said of the film,\n\n{{cquote|I conceived the story as a musical because musicals have a heightened sense of reality. Through song you can get closer to the truth. But even before I had any music I believed I had a complete script. I wrote it like any script. As far as the music was concerned, I only knew where I wanted the songs to go. [...] The point is that with or without musical numbers, the story worked.<ref name=any/>}}\n\n==Reaction==\n''I'll Do Anything'' received mixed to positive reviews from critics. It currently holds a rating of 61% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 18 reviews.\n\nIn his three-star review in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] called it \"one of those offcenter comedies that gets its best moments simply by looking at people and seeing how funny, how pathetic, how wonderful they sometimes can be . . . it's a bright, edgy, funny story about people who have all the talent they need, but not all the luck . . . It is helpful, I think, to simply forget about the missing songs, and recognize that ''I'll Do Anything'' is a complete movie without them - smart, original, subversive.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=I'll Do Anything movie review (1994) {{!}} Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ill-do-anything-1994|access-date=2021-11-07|website=www.rogerebert.com/|language=en}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as \"droll\" and \"improbably buoyant.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9D02E1DA1139F937A35751C0A962958260&oref=slogin&oref=login Janet Maslin review in ''The New York Times'', February 4, 1994]</ref>\n\nAudiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"B\u2212\" on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office failure.

It was to be a comedic song sung by Albert Brooks where he is begging a test audience to favorably review his latest film.\n\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n\n==References==\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2010}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0110097|title=I'll Do Anything}}\n* {{amg title|id=131120|title=I'll Do Anything}}\n* {{Mojo title|illdoanything|I'll Do Anything}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=ill_do_anything|title=I'll Do Anything}}\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-21/entertainment/ca-13533_1_albert-brooks \"They Just Gotta Trust This Guy\"] - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' profile\n\n{{James Brooks}}\n{{Gracie Films}}\n\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1994 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American satirical films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about actors]]\n[[Category:Films directed by James L.
