She sleeps with Thomas, a boy from school, but is ultimately dissatisfied and ends their relationship. After having vivid fantasies about the blue-haired woman while masturbating and kissing B\u00e9atrice, one of her female friends, Ad\u00e8le becomes troubled about her [[sexual identity]]. B\u00e9atrice says she does not want to proceed further and tells Ad\u00e8le to forget the kiss.\n\nAd\u00e8le's best friend, the [[Coming out|openly gay]] Valentin, takes her to a [[gay bar|gay dance bar]]. Ad\u00e8le later leaves and enters a [[lesbian bar]], where some women flirt with her. The blue-haired woman, art student Emma ([[L\u00e9a Seydoux]]), is there and intervenes, claiming Ad\u00e8le is her cousin. Emma and Ad\u00e8le become friends. After Emma shows up at the school, Ad\u00e8le's friends suspect her of being a lesbian and ostracise her.\n\nAd\u00e8le and Emma grow closer and kiss at a picnic. They later have sex and begin a passionate relationship. Emma's artsy family welcomes Ad\u00e8le, but Ad\u00e8le tells her conservative, working-class parents that Emma is her tutor for philosophy class. Some of Ad\u00e8le's old friends attend her surprise 18th birthday party, but Emma does not.\n\nIn the years that follow, the two women move in together. Ad\u00e8le becomes an elementary school teacher, while Emma tries to advance her painting career by throwing frequent house parties. At one party, Ad\u00e8le meets Emma's pregnant colleague Lise, gallery owner Joachim, and aspiring actor Samir. Samir discusses America with Ad\u00e8le while the others discuss sex, and the two become friends. Emma spends more time at the party with Lise.\n\nEmma belittles Ad\u00e8le's career but encourages her to pursue writing, while Ad\u00e8le insists she is happy the way she is. Their relationship grows tense as they have little in common. Emma comes home late, having spent the evening working with Lise. Out of loneliness, Ad\u00e8le sleeps with a male colleague. Emma discovers the cheating and furiously breaks up with Ad\u00e8le.\n\nThree years later, the two meet at a restaurant. Ad\u00e8le is happy with her job as a kindergarten teacher but has not moved on: she is still deeply in love with Emma. Emma is in a committed partnership with Lise and helps raise Lise's three-year-old daughter. Emma and Ad\u00e8le kiss, but Emma withdraws, although she admits she does not feel sexually fulfilled. She tells Ad\u00e8le that she no longer loves her, but that their relationship was special and she will always have \"infinite tenderness\" for her. The two part with apologies and tears.\n\nAd\u00e8le attends Emma's art exhibition. On one wall is a nude portrait of Ad\u00e8le that Emma painted during their time together. Emma acknowledges Ad\u00e8le but is focused on Lise and the other guests. Ad\u00e8le congratulates Emma on her success and, after a brief conversation with Samir, leaves. He chases after her but goes in the wrong direction, while Ad\u00e8le walks off into the distance.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:La Vie d'Ad\u00e8le casting Cannes 2013.jpg|thumb|Main cast, from left to right: [[Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos]], J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Laheurte and [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]]|240x240px]]\n{{Div col}}\n<!--- per credits order --->\n* [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]] as Emma\n* [[Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos]] as Ad\u00e8le\n* [[Salim Kechiouche]] as Samir\n* [[Aur\u00e9lien Recoing]] as Ad\u00e8le's father\n* [[Catherine Sal\u00e9e]] as Ad\u00e8le's mother\n* [[Benjamin Siksou]] as Antoine\n* {{ill|Mona Walravens|fr}} as Lise\n* [[Alma Jodorowsky]] as B\u00e9atrice\n* J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Laheurte as Thomas\n* {{ill|Anne Loiret|fr}} as Emma's mother\n* Beno\u00eet Pilot as Emma's stepfather\n* [[Sandor Funtek]] as Valentin\n* Fanny Maurin as Am\u00e9lie\n* Maelys Cabezon as Laetitia\n* St\u00e9phane Mercoyrol as Joachim\n* Aurelie Lemanceau as Sabine\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Themes and interpretations ==\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nLesbian sexuality is one of the film's primary themes, as the narrative deals with Ad\u00e8le's exploration of her identity in this context. But some academics have questioned the film's treatment of lesbian sexuality, given that it was directed by a heterosexual man. In ''[[Sight & Sound]]'', film scholar Sophie Mayer suggests that in ''Blue is the Warmest Colour'', \"Like homophobia, the lesbian here melts away. As with many male fantasies of lesbianism, the film centers on the erotic success and affective failures of relations between women\".<ref>[http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/reviews-recommendations/blue-warmest-colour Review: Blue is the Warmest Colour]. ''Sight and Sound''. Retrieved 18 February 2015.</ref> \n\nThe issue of perspective was also addressed in a ''[[Film Comment]]'' review by Kristin M. Jones, who wrote, \"Emma's supposedly sophisticated friends make eager remarks about art and female sexuality that seem to mirror the director's problematic approach toward the representation of women\".<ref>[http://www.filmcomment.com/article/review-blue-is-the-warmest-color-abdellatif-kechiche Review: Blue Is the Warmest Color]. ''Film Comment''. Retrieved 19 February 2015.</ref>\n\nOne critic has suggested that the film is not a lesbian film, highlighting the exploration of Ad\u00e8le's bisexuality. Paulina Plazas wrote in ''[[IndieWire]]'' that throughout the film, [[bisexual erasure]] is \"central to understanding Ad\u00e8le's particular sense that she does not belong as she comes of age.\"<ref>{{cite web |author1=Ben |title='Blue is the Warmest Color' is Not a Lesbian Film |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2014/05/vent-blue-is-the-warmest-color-is-not-a-lesbian-film-214292/ |website=[[IndieWire]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |access-date=8 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602021740/http://www.indiewire.com/2014/05/vent-blue-is-the-warmest-color-is-not-a-lesbian-film-214292/ |archive-date=2 June 2018 |date=2 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Social class ===\nOne recurring thematic element critics and audiences identified is the division of [[social class]] and the exploration of freedom and love between the two central characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/11/03/blue_is_the_warmest_color_is_about_class_not_just_sex/|title=Blue is the Warmest Color is about class, not just sex|date=4 November 2013|access-date=22 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ioncinema.com/reviews/blue-is-the-warmest-color-review|title=Blue is the Warmest Color|date=25 October 2013|work=Icon Cinema|access-date=22 February 2014}}</ref> The social class division is clear in the two family dinner scenes, with Ad\u00e8le's conservative, working-class family discussing comparatively banal subjects while Emma's more open-minded, middle-class family mainly discusses more [[Existentialism|existential]] matters: art, career, life and passion. Perhaps one of the most significant differences between the families is that Emma's is aware of their lesbian relationship, while Ad\u00e8le's conservative parents are led to believe the women are just friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neontommy.com/news/2013/10/film-review-blue-warmest-color|title=Film Review: 'Blue Is The Warmest Color'|work=Neon Tommy|access-date=24 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071021/http://www.neontommy.com/news/2013/10/film-review-blue-warmest-color|archive-date=21 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSome critics have noted that class difference is an ongoing theme in Kechiche's filmography. One ''[[Film Comment]]'' critic wrote, \"As in Kechiche's earlier work, social class, and the divisions it creates, are a vital thread; he even changed the first name of the story's passionate protagonist from Cl\u00e9mentine to that of his actress, partly because it means 'justice' in Arabic. His fascination and familiarity with the world of pedagogy, as shown here in Ad\u00e8le's touching reverence for teaching, is another notable characteristic\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/review-blue-is-the-warmest-color-abdellatif-kechiche|title=Review: Blue is the Warmest Colour|work=Film Comment|access-date=22 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Food ===\nKechiche explores how food can evoke varying levels of symbolism, for instance through the sexually suggestive food metaphors of Ad\u00e8le's liking the fat on ham and her learning to eat oysters from Emma. He also looks at how food can be indicative of social class.<ref name=\"bfi.org.uk\">{{cite web|author=Sophie Mayer |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/reviews-recommendations/blue-warmest-colour |title=Blue is the Warmest Colour review &#124; Sight & Sound |publisher=BFI |date=20 February 2015 |access-date=3 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Adaptation ===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Cover Blue Angel Maroh.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First published in 2010, [[Jul Maroh]]'s graphic novel ''[[Blue Is the Warmest Color (comics)|Blue Is the Warmest Color]]'' became the source material for the film.]] -->\nDirector and screenwriter [[Abdellatif Kechiche]] developed the premise for ''Blue Is the Warmest Colour'' while directing his second feature film, ''[[Games of Love and Chance]]'' (2003). He met teachers \"who felt very strongly about reading, painting, writing\" and was inspired to develop a script that charts the personal life and career of a female French teacher. But the concept was only finalized a few years later when Kechiche chanced upon Maroh's graphic novel and he saw how he could link his screenplay about a schoolteacher with Maroh's love story between two young women.<ref name=\"The Upcoming\">{{cite web|title=An interview with Abdellatif Kechiche director of Cannes winner Blue Is the Warmest Colour|url=http://www.theupcoming.co.uk/2013/05/26/an-interview-with-abdellatif-kechiche-director-of-cannes-winner-blue-is-the-warmest-colour/|work=The Upcoming |access-date=17 December 2013|date=26 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Maroh's story takes precedence in the adaptation, Ad\u00e8le's character, named \"Cl\u00e9mentine\" in the book, differs from the original, as explored by Charles Taylor in ''[[The Yale Review]]'': \"The novel includes scenes of the girls being discovered in bed and thrown out of the house and speeches like ''What's horrible is that people kill each other for oil and commit genocide, not that they give their love to someone.''\"<ref>Taylor, Charles. \"[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/yrev.12177/pdf Film in Review].\" ''[[The Yale Review]]'' Volume 102, Issue 3, Article first published online: 19 June 2014.</ref> In the film, Ad\u00e8le's parents seem oblivious to her love affair with Emma and politely greet her under the impression that she is Ad\u00e8le's philosophy tutor. Further themes are explored in Maroh's novel, such as addiction to prescription pills. Of his intention to portray young people, Kechiche said: \"I almost wish I was born now, because young people seem to be much more beautiful and brighter than my generation. I want to pay them tribute.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailylife.com.au/dl-people/dl-entertainment/what-really-happened-on-the-blue-is-the-warmest-colour-set-20140208-32885.html|title=What really happened on the Blue is the Warmest Colour set|work=Daily Life|date=8 February 2014|access-date=18 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn late 2011, a casting call was held in Paris to find the ideal actress for the role of Ad\u00e8le. Casting director Sophie Blanvillain first spotted Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and then arranged for her to meet Kechiche. Exarchopoulos described how her auditions with Kechiche over the course of two months consisted of improvisation of scenarios, discussions, and sitting in a caf\u00e9, without talking, while he observed her. It was later, a day before the New Year, that Kechiche decided to offer Exarchopoulos the leading role in the film; as he said in an interview, \"I chose Ad\u00e8le the minute I saw her. I had taken her for lunch at a brasserie.

Kechiche felt that Seydoux \"shared her character's beauty, voice, intelligence and freedom\" and that she has \"something of an Arabic soul\". He added, \"What was decisive during our meeting was her take on society: She's very much tuned in to the world around her.
