The film stars [[Keir Gilchrist]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Emma Roberts]], and [[Viola Davis]].<ref name=\"slashfilm\" /> It was released in the United States on October 8, 2010, and received generally positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nContemplating suicide, 16-year-old Craig Gilner seeks help at a hospital. He tells a doctor named Dr. Mahmoud that he needs immediate help, so he is registered for a five day stay at the adult ward on the hospital's [[psychiatric hospital|psychiatric floor]].\n\nCraig feels a lot of pressure from his high school, Executive Pre-Professional, and is stressed over needing to turn in an application for a prestigious summer school. Also he feels he has shortcomings in the shadow of his best friend Aaron, who is great at everything, and his dad, who pressures him to do well. At first, Craig is uncertain if he made the right choice to stay, fearing his friends may find out where he is, especially Nia, his crush and Aaron's girlfriend.\n\nCraig is introduced to Bobby, an adult patient who takes Craig under his wing. During a group discussion, Craig learns that Bobby is stressed about an upcoming interview, hoping to move to a [[group home]]. Bobby worries that the sweater he is wearing is all he has to wear for the interview, so Craig offers him one of his dad's dress shirts to wear. Noelle, another teenage patient who is in for [[self-harm]], is impressed by Craig's kindness, so leaves him a note to meet with her later on. They attend a painting session for patients together, where Craig paints a picture of an imaginary city map which he describes as \"like my own brain\".\n\nThroughout his stay, Craig bonds with various patients, including Bobby and Noelle. Bobby tells him he is a father of a little girl, and is in the ward for attempting to kill himself six times. As Craig tries to help Bobby with his problems, Bobby, in turn, helps Craig gain the courage to ask out Noelle.\n\nOne night, Nia stops by to visit Craig, revealing that she and Aaron have broken up. Craig invites Nia to his room, where she tries to seduce him. However, they are interrupted by Craig's roommate Muqtada, an older patient who has not left the room during his stay. As Nia runs out, Craig chases her, declaring he loves her, unaware that Noelle is standing behind him. Upset, she storms off, leaving behind a self-portrait she had planned to give him.\n\nCraig eventually wins Noelle's forgiveness, and the pair briefly sneak out of the ward, onto the hospital roof. There, Noelle asks him out, and they kiss. Craig has an interview with the head physician, Dr. Minerva; he explains that he has realized that he wants to become an artist, and is thankful his problems aren't as bad as some of the others.\n\nThat night, Craig asks the staff for a pizza party, so the patients can say goodbye to him and Bobby\u2014both are being discharged the following day. Craig calls Aaron, asking him to bring a [[LP record|record]]. When Aaron arrives, he tells him that he and Nia are working out their problems and they hug. At the party, Craig plays the record of Egyptian music, bringing Muqtada out of his room. He tells Bobby they should meet again after they are discharged, which he considers, and Bobby thanks him for changing his future outlook.\n\nAfter Craig is discharged, he narrates a montage showing he has started dating Noelle, become better friends with Aaron and Nia, and begun pursuing his goal to become an artist. He has broken the news to his dad that he is not going to follow his path, which his dad understands. Craig affirms that, while his stay didn't cure his condition, it helped him a lot, and he can get through the rest of his life with the help of his family and friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keir Gilchrist]] as Craig Gilner\n* [[Emma Roberts]] as Noelle\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Bobby\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Dr. Minerva\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as Nia\n* [[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]] as Aaron Fitzcarraldo\n* [[Aasif Mandvi]] as Dr. Mahmoud\n* [[Bernard White (actor)|Bernard White]] as Muqtada\n* [[Lauren Graham]] as Lynn Gilner\n* [[Jim Gaffigan]] as George Gilner\n* [[Matthew Maher (actor)|Matthew Maher]] as Humble\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Johnny\n* [[Jeremy Davies]] as Smitty\n* Willian Silvan as Willian\n* [[Mary Birdsong]] as Bobby's ex-wife\n* [[Novella Nelson]] as The Professor\n* [[Morgan Murphy (comedian)|Morgan Murphy]] as Joanie\n* Dana DeVestern as Alissa Gilner\n* Ethan Herschenfeld as Solomon (Acid Head)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Ned Vizzini and Keir Gilchrist.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Ned Vizzini]], writer of the novel, and [[Keir Gilchrist]], leading actor in the film, at 2010 [[Toronto International Film Festival]].]]\nIn May 2006, [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[MTV Films]] acquired the film rights to the novel.
