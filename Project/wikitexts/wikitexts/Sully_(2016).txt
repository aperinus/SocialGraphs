[[Tom Hanks]] stars as Sullenberger, with [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Laura Linney]], [[Anna Gunn]], [[Autumn Reeser]], [[Holt McCallany]], and [[Jamey Sheridan]]. The film follows Sullenberger's January 2009 emergency landing of [[US Airways Flight 1549]] on the [[Hudson River]], in which all 155 passengers and crew survived - most suffering only minor injuries - and the subsequent publicity and investigation.\n\n''Sully'' premiered at the 43rd Annual [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 2, 2016, and was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros.]] on September 9, 2016, in conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters.<ref name=\"IMAX\">{{cite web |url=http://www.imax.com/movies/sully |title=Sully &#124; Nearby Showtimes, Movie Tickets |publisher=IMAX |access-date=2016-11-26 |archive-date=August 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831000118/https://www.imax.com/movies/sully |url-status=live }}</ref> The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $240 million worldwide, but [[#Dispute_of_depiction_of_NTSB|created controversy]] with its fictionalized portrayal of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) as \"prosecutorial and closed-minded.\" The [[American Film Institute]] and [[National Board of Review]] both selected it as one of their ten best films of 2016,<ref>{{cite web|last=Hipes |first=Patrick | url=https://deadline.com/2016/12/afi-awards-film-2016-list-silence-sully-zootopia-1201867080/ |title=AFI Awards: Best Of 2016 List Includes 'Silence', 'Hacksaw Ridge' & More |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date =December 8, 2016 |access-date= December 8, 2016| archive-date=December 22, 2016|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20161222192150/http://deadline.com/2016/12/afi-awards-film-2016-list-silence-sully-zootopia-1201867080/ | url-status=live}}</ref> and it received an [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] nomination at the [[89th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nOn the afternoon of January 15, 2009, [[Pilot in command|Captain]] [[Sully Sullenberger|Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger]] and [[First officer (aviation)|First Officer]] [[Jeffrey Skiles|Jeff Skiles]] board [[US Airways Flight 1549]] from [[LaGuardia Airport]] to [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport]]. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of {{cvt|2,800.|ft|sigfig=2}}, the [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] [[Bird strike|strikes a flock of birds]], damaging both engines. Without much time to think, they judge themselves as unable to reach nearby airports ([[Teterboro Airport]] being the closest), and Sully [[Water landing|ditches]] the aircraft on the [[Hudson River]]. Though with mild injuries, the crew and passengers evacuate without any fatalities. Sully is hailed a hero, but still experiences the [[post-traumatic stress disorder|aftereffects]]. He tries coping by drinking but finds himself unable to escape the attention of the press, which is not only targeting him but also his family.\n\nStill in New York City for investigation reasons, Sully learns that preliminary data from [[ACARS]] suggest that the left engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, it still had enough power to land the plane at either LaGuardia or Teterboro. Furthermore, the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) claims that several confidential computerized simulations show similar results. Sully and Jeff firmly insist otherwise, and this opposition gradually intensifies the relationship between both parties.\n\nThe NTSB suspects it may be a case of a [[pilot error]], which would likely end Sully's career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, then relayed to the public. They result in successful landings. Sully debates that the simulations are unrealistic because they do not take human factors into account, such as the element of surprise, the time required for analysis and decision-making, and the significantly higher stakes he and Jeff faced; the simulation pilots knew in advance of the situation that they would face and of the suggested emergency action, were able to practice the scenario several times, had no passengers to think about, and were in no danger themselves. The NTSB accepts his criticism, and the simulations are rerun with a 35-second pause before the plane is diverted. The LaGuardia rerun ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and that to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The NTSB announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it had indeed been seriously damaged by the bird strike, and concludes that Sully had acted correctly during flight 1549. Sully credits everyone on board, the air traffic controllers, the ferry crews, and the emergency response teams for the successful outcome.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align        = right\n| total_width  = 360\n| direction    = horizontal\n| footer       = [[Sully Sullenberger|Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger]] (left) portrayed by [[Tom Hanks]] (right)\n| image1       = Chesley Sullenberger honored crop.jpg\n| image2       = Sully Japan Premiere Red Carpet- Tom Hanks (29747442771).jpg\n}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sully Sullenberger|Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger]]\n** Blake Jones as Sullenberger at 16 years old\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as [[Jeffrey Skiles|Jeff Skiles]]\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Lorraine Sullenberger\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Charles Porter\n* [[Anna Gunn]] as Dr. Elizabeth Davis\n* [[Jamey Sheridan]] as Ben Edwards\n* [[Ann Cusack]] as Donna Dent\n* [[Autumn Reeser]] as Tess Sosa\n* [[Molly Hagan]] as Doreen Welsh\n* Jane Gabbert as Sheila Dail\n* [[Holt McCallany]] as Mike Cleary\n* [[Chris Bauer]] as Larry Rooney\n* Patch Darragh as Patrick Harten\n* [[Jerry Ferrara]] as Michael Delaney\n* [[Max Adler (actor)|Max Adler]] as Jimmy Stefanik\n* [[Sam Huntington]] as Jeff Kolodjay\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Pete the Bartender\n* [[Wayne Bastrup]] as Brian Kelly\n* [[Valerie Mahaffey]] as Diane Higgins\n* [[Jeff Kober]] as L.

However, this meant that the release coincided with the 15th anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]], which made executives wary as the film contains a dream sequence in which the plane crashes into [[Manhattan]] skyscrapers. But Warner Bros. domestic distribution chief Jeff Goldstein and his team nevertheless decided to release at that time because \"''Sully'' is a story of hope and a real hero who did his job.\"<ref name=\"Sep11\"/> However, according to Komarnicki, the release date was coincidental rather than planned, and he attributed it to box-office logistics, principally the limited availability of [[IMAX]] screens during the summer and at Christmas time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/sully-premiere-clint-eastwood-defends-926117|title=Sully' Premiere: Clint Eastwood Defends Scenes of Planes Crashing Into Manhattan Skyscrapers|first=Ashley|last=Lee|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 4, 2016|access-date=September 14, 2016|archive-date=September 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910215611/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/sully-premiere-clint-eastwood-defends-926117|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\n''Sully'' was released by [[Warner Bros.
