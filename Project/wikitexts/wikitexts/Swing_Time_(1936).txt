According to ''The Oxford Companion to the American Musical'', ''Swing Time'' is \"a strong candidate for the best of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals\". ''The Oxford Companion'' says that, although the screenplay is contrived, it \"left plenty of room for dance and all of it was superb. ... Although the movie is remembered as one of the great dance musicals, it also boasts one of the best film scores of the 1930s.\"<ref>Hischak, Thomas.

Jerome Kern's score, the first of two he composed specially for Astaire films, contains three of his most memorable songs.<ref>Mueller, p.101n: \"In a 1936 letter [[George Gershwin]] was somewhat patronizing about the music: 'Although I don't think Kern has written any outstanding song hits, I think he did a very credible job with the music and some of it is really quite delightful. Of course, he never was really quite ideal for Astaire and I take that into consideration'\".</ref>\n\nThe film's plot has been criticized, though,<ref>Mueller, p.101: \"the story is riddled with inconsistencies, implausibilities, contrivances, omissions, and irrationalities,\" Croce, p.102: \"discontinuities in the plot,\" also see Hyam, p.46</ref> as has the performance of Metaxa.<ref name=\"Croce\"/><ref name=\"Mueller\"/> More praised is Rogers' acting and dancing performance.<ref>Mueller, p.103: \"her finest in the series.\"</ref>   Rogers herself credited much of the film's success to Stevens: \"He gave us a certain quality, I think, that made it stand out above the others.\"<ref name=\"Mueller\"/> ''Swing Time'' also marked the beginning of a decline in popularity of the Astaire\u2013Rogers partnership among the general public, with box office receipts falling faster than usual, after a successful opening.<ref name=\"Astaire\">{{cite book\n| last = Astaire\n| first = Fred\n| title = Steps in Time\n| publisher = Heinemann\n| year = 1959\n| location = London\n| pages = 218\u2013228\n| isbn = 0-241-11749-6 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the film was a sizable hit, costing $886,000, grossing over $2,600,000 worldwide, and showing a net profit of $830,000.

In 2004 it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]], it is ranked at #90.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=August 2022}}\nJohn \"Lucky\" Garnett ([[Fred Astaire]]) is a gambler and dancer set to marry Margaret Watson ([[Betty Furness]]). Not wanting him to retire, the other members of his dance act deliberately sabotage the event. \"Pop\" Cardetti ([[Victor Moore]]) takes Lucky's trousers to be altered by sewing cuffs while the others begin a crap game. After the tailor refuses to modify the pants, Pop returns with them, unaltered. Margaret's father phones to say he has sent everyone home, but the call is intercepted. When Lucky finally leaves for the wedding, his troop bets him the bankroll that he will not be getting married. Lucky mollifies Margaret's father by saying that he was \"earning\" $200. Judge Watson tells Lucky he must earn [[United States dollar|$]]25,000 to demonstrate his good intentions.\n\nLucky's dance troupe takes all of his money at the train station except for his lucky quarter because he did not get married. Pop and Lucky, still in his suit, hop the first freight to New York. Lucky meets Penny ([[Ginger Rogers]]) when he asks for change for his lucky quarter so he can buy cigarettes for Pop. The cigarette machine dumps a load of coins, so they follow Penny and offer to repurchase the quarter, but she is in no mood to deal with them. Pop sneaks the quarter out of her purse when she drops her things, but she thinks Lucky did it. Lucky insists on following Penny to her job, where she works as a dance school instructor. He accepts a dancing lesson from her agency to apologize. After a disastrous lesson (\"Pick Yourself Up\"), Penny tells him to \"save his money\"{{Snd}}he will never learn to dance. Her boss, Mr. Gordon ([[Eric Blore]]), overhears and fires her. He also fires Mabel Anderson ([[Helen Broderick]]) for complaining that Pop ate her sandwich. To prove how much she has taught him, Lucky dances with Penny{{Snd}}marvelously. Gordon gives Penny her job back and sets up an audition with the owner of the Silver Sandal nightclub.\n\nLucky and Pop check into the hotel where Penny and Mabel live. Lucky tries and fails to win a tuxedo for the audition by playing strip [[piquet]]. They miss the audition, and Penny gets mad at Lucky all over again. He and Pop picket in front of Penny's apartment door for a week. Mabel intervenes, and Penny forgives him, agreeing to go to a second audition. At the Silver Sandal, bandleader Ricardo Romero (Georges Metaxa), who wants to marry Penny, refuses to play for them. The club owner cannot force him because he lost Romero's contract in a bet to Club Raymond. At the casino, Pop warns Lucky that he is about to win enough money to marry Margaret. He takes his bet off the table. The club owner wagers Ricardo's contract on a cut of the cards. Seeing that Raymond intends to cheat, Pop cheats too, and Lucky wins the contract.\n\nLucky and Penny are dance partners, but he avoids seeing her alone. He lacks the nerve to tell her about Margaret. Mabel arranges a trip to the country. Lucky resists the temptation to snuggle in a snow-covered gazebo, prompting Penny to sing \"A Fine Romance.\" Pop lets slip the truth about Margaret, and Lucky sings the rest. In the remodeled Silver Sandal, Penny refuses another proposal from Ricardo. Mabel dares her to give Lucky \"a great big kiss.\" They do kiss behind a dressing room door. Pop lets his sleight of hand become known to Raymond, who insists on playing Lucky for the contract. He loses. Margaret shows up, and Lucky asks her to meet him the next day. While Lucky is indecisive, Penny becomes heartbroken. Lucky finds her in the deserted club, where he learns she has agreed to marry Ricardo. Asked about the future, he sings \"Never Gonna Dance,\" segueing without dialogue into their dance to \"The Way You Look Tonight.\"\n\nThe next day, Margaret tells Lucky she wants to marry someone else. Everyone laughs until Pop announces that Ricardo and Penny will be married that afternoon. They rush to intervene and manage to pull off the trouser gag. While waiting for the nonexistent alteration, Ricardo struggles to keep up a pair of baggy pants. An infectious round of laughter causes Penny to call off the wedding, having been won over by Lucky.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as John \"Lucky\" Garnett\n* [[Ginger Rogers]] as Penelope \"Penny\" Carroll\n* [[Victor Moore]] as Edwin \"Pop\" Cardetti\n* [[Eric Blore]] as Mr. Gordon\n* [[Helen Broderick]] as Mabel Anderson\n* [[Betty Furness]] as Margaret Watson\n* [[Georges Metaxa]] as Ricardo \"Ricky\" Romero\n* [[Landers Stevens]] as Judge Watson \n* Abe Reynolds as Schmidt the tailor (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nInitially, the working titles for the film were ''I Won't Dance'' and ''Never Gonna Dance'', but studio executives worried that no one would come see a musical where no one danced, and the title was changed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hischak |first=Thomas S. |title=The Jerome Kern Encyclopedia |location=Lantham, Md. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-8108-9167-8 |page=211}}</ref> ''Pick Yourself Up'' was also considered as a title, as were 15 other possibilities.<ref name=afi />\n\nErwin Gelsey's original screen story was purchased by RKO, and in November 1935, Gelsey was hired to adapt the story.  Although he did not receive any screen credit, he was under consideration for screenplay credit as late as July 1936.  Howard Lindsay wrote the first draft of the screenplay, which was then considerably re-written by Allan Scott.  Just before shooting started, in April 1936, Scott was called back from New York to write additional dialogue.<ref name=afi />\n\nAstaire spent almost eight weeks preparing for the film's dance numbers.<ref name=afi />\n\nThe \"Bojangles of Harlem\" number, a tribute to [[Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson]], was the last part of the film shot, because of the special effects required. To create the effect that Astaire was dancing with three shadows of himself that were larger-than-life, Astaire had to be filmed dancing in front of a blank white screen on which a powerful light projected his shadow. This footage was tripled in the film lab.  Astaire was next filmed performing under normal lighting in front of another white screen while watching a projection of the shadow dancing, and the four shots were optically combined.  In its entirety, the sequence took three full days of shooting, and the film overall took several weeks longer to shoot than the normal Astaire-Rogers film.<ref name=afi />\n\nThe New York street scenes were shot on [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s back lot, the train station interiors and exteriors at the [[Los Angeles]] [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Santa Fe Railroad Station]], and the freight yard scene was shot in downtown Los Angeles.<ref name=afi />\n\n==Musical numbers==\n* \"[[Pick Yourself Up]]\": The first of Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields' standards is a charming [[polka]] first sung and then danced to by Astaire and Rogers. One of their most joyous and exuberant numbers is also a technical tour-de-force with the basic polka embellished by syncopated rhythms and overlaid with tap decoration. In particular, Rogers recaptures the spontaneity and commitment that she first displayed in the \"[[I'll Be Hard to Handle]]\" number from ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935); that film's score was originally written by Kern for the [[Roberta (musical)|Broadway stage]].\n* \"[[The Way You Look Tonight]]\": Kern and Fields' classic Oscar-winning [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]] is sung by Astaire, seated at a piano, while Ginger is busy washing her hair in a side room. Here, Astaire conveys a sunny yet nostalgic romanticism but later, when the music is danced to as part of \"Never Gonna Dance\", the pair will create a mood of sombre poignancy. As evidence of its enduring appeal, this song is regularly featured in modern cinema and television. It is featured in the films ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) and ''[[My Best Friend's Wedding]]'' (1997) and it played a prominent role as the key linking element in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' series finale \"[[What You Leave Behind]]\".\n* \"Waltz in Swing Time\": Described by one critic as \"the finest piece of pure dance music ever written for Astaire\", this is the most virtuosic partnered romantic duet Astaire ever committed to film. Kern was always reluctant to compose in the swing style, so the film's orchestrator, [[Robert Russell Bennett]]{{Snd}}a longtime Kern associate on Broadway{{Snd}}composed the number using some themes provided by Kern.<ref name= afi />  The song's interlude, a 3/4 treatment of \"The Way You Look Tonight\" was added by rehearsal pianist [[Hal Borne]]. Bennett recalled Kern's request to attend to the number{{Snd}}\"see what Freddie [Astaire] wants\"{{Snd}}to [[Arlene Croce]] in 1976,<ref>Croce, p. 112</ref> and later in a letter to John Mueller; the published sheet music notes that the waltz was \"constructed and arranged\" by Bennett. The dance is a nostalgic celebration of love, in the form of a syncopated waltz with tap overlays \u2013 a concept Astaire later reworked in the similarly impressive \"Belle of New York\" segment of the \"Currier and Ives\" routine from ''[[The Belle of New York (1952 film)|The Belle of New York]]'' (1952). In the midst of this most complex of routines, Astaire and Rogers find time to gently poke fun at notions of elegance, in a delicate reminder of a similar episode in \"Pick Yourself Up\".\n* \"[[A Fine Romance (song)|A Fine Romance]]\": Kern and Fields' third standard, a [[quickstep]] to Fields' bittersweet lyrics, is sung alternately by Rogers and Astaire, with Rogers providing an object lesson in acting while a bowler-hatted Astaire appears at times to be impersonating [[Stan Laurel]]. Never a man to discard a favourite piece of fine clothing, Astaire wears the same coat in the opening scene of ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' (1941).\n* \"Bojangles of Harlem\": Once again, Kern, Bennett and Borne combined their talents to produce a jaunty instrumental piece ideally suited to Astaire, who here{{Snd}}while overtly paying tribute to [[Bill Robinson]]{{Snd}}actually broadens his tribute to African-American tap dancers by dancing in the style of Astaire's one-time teacher [[John W. Bubbles]], and dressing in the style of the character ''Sportin' Life'', whom Bubbles played the year before in Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.<ref name=afi /> Dorothy Fields recounts how Astaire managed to inspire the reluctant Kern by visiting his home and singing while dancing on and around his furniture. It is the only number in which Astaire{{Snd}}again bowler-hatted{{Snd}}appears in [[blackface]]. The idea of using trick photography to show Astaire dancing with three of his shadows was invented by [[Hermes Pan]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite AV media |title=The Swing of Things: 'Swing Time' Step by Step |date=2005 |type=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref>{{Rp|location=9}} (who also choreographed the opening chorus), after which Astaire dances a short opening solo which features poses mimicking and perhaps satirizing [[Al Jolson]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2022}}{{Snd}}all of which was captured by Stevens in one take. There follows a two-minute solo of Astaire dancing with his shadows which took three days to shoot. Astaire's choreography exercises every limb and makes extensive use of hand-clappers. This routine earned Hermes Pan an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for Best Dance Direction.\n* \"[[Never Gonna Dance (song)|Never Gonna Dance]]\": After Astaire sings Fields' memorable closing line: \"la belle, la perfectly swell romance\" of Kern's haunting ballad, they begin the acknowledgement phase of the dance, replete with a poignant nostalgia for their now-doomed affair, where music changes to \"The Way You Look Tonight\" and they dance slowly in a manner reminiscent of the opening part of \"Let's Face The Music And Dance\" from ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936). At the end of this episode, Astaire adopts a crestfallen, helpless pose. They now begin the denial phase, and again the music changes and speeds up, this time to the \"Waltz In Swing Time\" while the dancers separate to twirl their way up their respective staircases, escaping to the platform at the top of the Silver Sandal Set{{Snd}}an elaborate [[Art Deco]]-influenced Hollywood Moderne creation of [[Carroll Clark]] and John Harkrider. Here the music switches again to a frantic, fast-paced, recapitulation of \"Never Gonna Dance\" as the pair dance a last, desperate, and virtuosic routine before Ginger flees and Astaire repeats his pose of dejection, in a final acceptance of the affair's end. This final routine was shot 47 times in one day before Astaire was satisfied, with Rogers' feet left bruised and bleeding by the time they finished.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|location=12}}\n* Finale duet: At the end of the film, Astaire and Rogers sing shortened versions of \"A Fine Romance\" and \"The Way You Look Tonight\" simultaneously (with altered lyrics). Harmonies have been very slightly altered so that the two songs fit well together.\n\n'''Musical notes'''\n* Kern and Fields also wrote an additional song, \"It's Not in the Cards\", as a full opening number, but it was edited out, being heard only momentarily at the conclusion of the first scene and later as background music.<ref name=afi />\n* Kern was hired to write seven songs, for which he was paid $50,000 and gross percentage up to $37,500.  Astaire requested that two of the songs be swing numbers, but the weak version of \"Bojangles of Harlem\" he delivered remained unacceptable even though Astaire spent several hours tap-dancing in Kern's hotel room in an attempt to loosen it up. Kern required the services of Robert Russell Bennet, and, during rehearsal, Astaire's rehearsal pianist Hal Borne contributed ideas. Although Astaire requested that Borne receive credit for his contribution, Kern was insistent that Borne receive no credit, was not to compose any music, and was not to be paid for writing any music.  Bennett also received no credit in the film, but the sheet music for \"Waltz in Swing Time\" credits him with the construction and arrangement.<ref name=afi />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nAccording to RKO records the film made $1,624,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $994,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $830,000.<ref name=\"rko\"/>\n\nIt was the 15th most popular film at the British box office in 1935\u201336.<ref>\"The Film Business in the United States and Britain during the 1930s\" by John Sedgwick and Michael Pokorny, ''The Economic History Review''New Series, Vol. 58, No. 1 (Feb., 2005), pp.97</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 8.58/10.
