It is the third installment in [[The Omen (franchise)|''The Omen'' series]]. Starring [[Sam Neill]], [[Lisa Harrow]] and [[Rossano Brazzi]], the film tells the progression of the now adult Damien Thorn to a position of earthly power, set against the countdown to the [[Second Coming]] and attempts of a group of priests to kill the [[Antichrist]]. [[Richard Donner]], director of [[The Omen|the first Omen film]], returns as executive producer. The film was released in theatres on March 20, 1981.\n\n== Plot ==\nFollowing the grisly suicide of the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Kingdom|U.S. Ambassador]] to the [[United Kingdom]], 33-year-old international conglomerate CEO [[Damien Thorn]] is appointed in his place, an office his adoptive father, Robert Thorn, once held. Having fully embraced his unholy lineage and having run his company for seven years, Damien now attempts to reshape his [[destiny]] by halting the [[Second Coming]] of [[Christ]].\n\nHowever, Father DeCarlo, a priest from the Subiaco monastery where Father Spiletto spent his final days and who has observed Damien from afar since his adopted father's death, acquires the Seven Daggers of Megiddo that were dug out of the ruins of the Thorn Museum in Chicago following the fire at the end of the second movie. Joined by six other priests, DeCarlo plans to kill Damien while finding the Christ child. Meanwhile, Damien becomes romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds. Learning of his assassins and killing all but DeCarlo over time, he proceeds to mold Reynolds's young son Peter into a disciple by playing on the boy's desire for a father figure.\n\nAfter the alignment of stars in the [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia constellation]] on March 24, 1981, generating what is described as a second [[Star of Bethlehem]], Damien realizes that it is a sign of the Second Coming and orders his followers to kill all boys born in England on the morning of March 24, 1981 to prevent the Christ's return to power. A week after a string of 31 infant deaths, Reynolds encounters DeCarlo and he reveals Damien's true identity to her while giving her evidence of the murders. The following morning she discovers Damien's birthmark.\n\nDamien tells Peter to follow DeCarlo, resulting in Damien learning that his adviser, Harvey Dean, had concealed the date of his son's birth when Peter reports that DeCarlo visited Dean's wife Barbara and revealed her husband's role in the infant murders. Dean refuses to kill his son and makes preparations to flee the country, only to return home and be killed by his wife who just killed their son with a burning iron while under Damien's demonic influence.\n\nDeCarlo later visits Reynolds and reveals that Peter is now under Damien's influence and that the real Christ child is now beyond Damien's reach. Agreeing to help DeCarlo, Reynolds tricks Damien with the promise to bring him to the church ruins where the Christ child is in exchange for Peter. The plan backfires when Damien spots DeCarlo first and uses Peter as a human shield against the dagger. As Peter dies in his mother's arms, Damien throttles Father DeCarlo before calling out for Christ to appear before him and \"face him\". This leaves Damien open to be stabbed in the back by Reynolds using DeCarlo's Megiddo dagger.\n\nAs Damien staggers through the courtyard and collapses, a vision of Christ appears in the archway above him. Damien mocks Christ for thinking he has won, and then dies. DeCarlo reappears carrying Peter's body and hands him to a praying Kate. As they leave the ruins, Bible passages are shown on-screen.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sam Neill]] as [[Damien Thorn]]\n* [[Lisa Harrow]] as Kate Reynolds\n* [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Father DeCarlo\n* [[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]] as Harvey Pleydell Dean\n* Barnaby Holm as Peter Reynolds\n* [[Leueen Willoughby]] as Barbara Dean\n* Marc Boyle as Brother Benito\n* Milos Kirek as Brother Martin\n* Tommy Duggan as Brother Matteus\n* [[Louis Mahoney]] as Brother Paulo\n* [[Richard Oldfield]] as Brother Simeon\n* [[Tony Vogel]] as Brother Antonio\n* [[Hugh Moxey]] as Butler\n* [[Mason Adams]] as U.S. President\n* [[Robert Arden]] as U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain\n* [[Ruby Wax]] (''uncredited'') as U.S. Ambassador's secretary\n* [[Hazel Court]] (''uncredited'') as champagne woman at hunt\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Locales and filming ===\nThe evening party scene was filmed in Brocket Hall, just outside London, which also substituted as Damien's residence. Kate, Damien, and Peter walk from Hyde Park to Speakers Corner. The Moors sequence was shot in [[Cornwall]] including [[Roche, Cornwall|Roche Rock]] with added visuals for the lightning. The Disciples Of The Watch sequence was shot at around 4\u20135 am in one night in the North York Moors. The finale was shot at [[Fountains Abbey]] in North Yorkshire. \"Shooting here was very cold and very eerie,\" according to [[Graham Baker (director)|Graham Baker]]'s commentary on the DVD. [[University of London Observatory]] in [[Mill Hill]], [[London]] (identified as \"[[Hendon]]\" in Baker's commentary) substituted for the Fernbank Observatory for The Second Coming sequence.\n\nThe crew did not go back to Subiaco to film the exterior location of the monastery as it only appears in two scenes in this film; footage from the first film was reused. Stock footage from ''The Omen'' was also used when the Ambassador, who kills himself at the beginning of the film, walks to the United States Embassy. The footage of the [[White House]] featured in the film was taken from ''Superman II'', subtracting the visual effects.\n\n[[Lisa Harrow]] said one of the most difficult sequences to shoot for the film was the death of the first priest in the television studio where her character Kate Reynolds interviews Damien.  It took over two weeks to get right. It is considered{{By whom|date=January 2022}} one of the nastiest mainstream movie deaths, involving a priest burning to death whilst trapped in melting plastic sheets. The scene where Barbara saw a vision of her baby burned/dead was shot on slate 666 and the camera jammed according to director [[Graham Baker (director)|Graham Baker]]. [[Stunt double|Stuntman]] [[Vic Armstrong]] performed the backwards one-hundred-foot fall from the bridge. In ''[[Guinness World Records]] 2005'', he described it as the most frightening stunt of his career. Most of his falls were less than seventy feet.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe score to ''The Final Conflict'' was composed by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had also composed the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Award]] winning music for ''[[The Omen]]'' and the score for its sequel ''[[Damien: Omen II]]''. The score was performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Lionel Newman]] (who also conducted the scores for the previous two movies).\n\nTrue to the style of his first two scores, Goldsmith used an orchestral/choral blend with light electronic elements to create the film's sound, though unlike the soundtrack to ''Damien'', ''The Final Conflict'' makes no pronounced reference to the original ''Omen'' theme \"[[Ave Satani]]\", which had earned him an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] in 1976. Instead, Goldsmith composed an all-new theme for the character of Damien introduced during the opening credits which emphasized robust tragedy over the more horrific sound of its prequel scores. Goldsmith also composed a new theme for the rebirth of Christ first introduced at the end of \"Main Title\" and later given full [[Romantic music|Romantic]] treatment with orchestra and choir at the film's climax in \"The Final Conflict\".<ref name=\"Filmtracks\">{{cite web|author=Clemmensen, Christian|title=''The Final Conflict'' soundtrack review|url=https://www.filmtracks.com/titles/final_conflict.html|publisher=[[Filmtracks.com]]|date=July 29, 2009|access-date=May 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe score has been released twice on album though [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]: first in 1986, featuring thirteen tracks of score at a running time just over forty-eight minutes; and an expanded version on 9 September 2001, which features fifteen tracks of score at a running time of just under sixty-three minutes.<ref name=\"Filmtracks\"/>\n\n'''1986 Album'''\n# \"Main Title\" (3:22)\n# \"The Ambassador\" (4:45)\n# \"Trial Run\" (2:10)\n# \"The Monastery\" (3:13)\n# \"A T.V.

Later, the title was adjusted to ''Omen III: The Final Conflict'' in home releases in order to accentuate its link to the other two films in the cycle. However, the opening title sequence still shows the original title without \"Omen III\" displayed.\n\nIn Germany and Hungary, the film was released as ''Barbara's Baby'', a play on the title ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''. This title also appeared on some posters in many countries before the eventual title was announced.\n\n== Reception ==\n''Omen III: The Final Conflict'' received mixed to negative reviews from critics. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received an [[approval rating]] of 29% based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/final_conflict_omen_iii/|title=Omen III: The Final Conflict (1981)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date=July 28, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 stars out of 4, writing that it became \"a growing disappointment, as we realize that the apocalyptic confrontation between the forces of good and evil is being reduced to a bunch of guys with Italian accents running around trying to stab Damien in the back.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-final-conflict-1981|title=The Final Conflict|author=Ebert, Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]|access-date=May 9, 2019}}</ref> Ebert and Gene Siskel also gave the film \"No\" ratings on their TV show, finding the movie to be boring and frankly small-scale relative to the material it was trying to present, and concluding they were happy that the OMEN series had come to its stopping point. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"the funniest one yet\" in the Omen series, adding that Neill played his part \"with an emotional range of shifting his eyes to the left, then shifting his eyes to the right, a practice no doubt perfected while watching [[dailies]].\"<ref>{{cite journal|date=March 25, 1981|title=The Final Conflict|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=20}}</ref> Sheila Benson of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the film for mostly avoiding \"the sort of tacky, splashy deaths\" of the first two entries and concluded that Baker \"has rounded off the gaudy trilogy with the most surprising qualities possible: intelligence and elegant visual style.\"<ref>Benson, Sheila (March 21, 1981). \"'Final Conflict' Ends 'Omen' Saga\".

For instance, at the beginning of the film, we're told that the world is in an unprecedented state of chaos, which should be the case if the Second Coming is due.

[[Graham Baker (director)|Graham Baker]] would return to direct, but scheduling conflicts with ''[[Impulse (1984 film)|Impulse]]'' prevented him from doing so. He was briefly replaced by television director Horace D. Burton, but the film's developments where stalled again by Burton's untimely death in 1983, leading [[20th Century Fox]] to ultimately cancel the production. Later, McGill wrote a final ''Omen'' novel called ''Omen V: The Abomination''.\n\nIn 1991, another sequel, ''[[Omen IV: The Awakening]]'', was produced for television in a failed attempt by [[20th Century Fox]] to revive the films as a horror franchise in the style of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0082377}}\n* {{Amg movie|17284}}\n* {{mojo title|omen3}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|final_conflict_omen_iii}}\n\n{{The Omen}}\n{{Graham Baker}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1981 horror films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American political thriller films]]\n[[Category:British horror films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films shot at EMI-Elstree Studios]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Graham Baker]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith]]\n[[Category:The Omen (franchise)]]\n[[Category:Fictional depictions of the Antichrist]]\n[[Category:Filicide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Mariticide in fiction]]\n[[Category:British sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films about rape]]\n[[Category:1981 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:1980s British films]]"}]}}}}
