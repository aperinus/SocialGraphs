It tells the coming-of-age story of Ingemar, a young boy sent to live with relatives. The cast includes [[Anton Glanzelius]], [[Melinda Kinnaman]], and [[Tomas von Br\u00f6mssen]].\n\nIn 1987, the film was released in the United States where it became a surprise hit. The film was nominated for two [[60th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] that year in the categories of [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe action takes place in Sweden from 1958 to 1959.<ref>The film's plot can be dated through its references to the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 Football World Cup]] and the [[Floyd Patterson#Patterson vs. Johansson I.2C II .26 III|1959 boxing match between Ingemar Johansson and Floyd Patterson]]</ref> 12-year-old Ingemar gets into all sorts of trouble and adventures with his beloved dog. He and his older brother Erik become too much to handle for their single mother; Ingemar does not know that his mother is in fact terminally ill. In order for their mom to get the rest and recovery she needs, the boys are split up and sent to live with relatives. Ingemar ends up with his maternal uncle Gunnar and his wife Ulla in a small rural town in [[Sm\u00e5land]]. Ingemar is not allowed to bring his dog along with him, despite his protestations, and the dog is placed in a kennel. During Ingemar\u2019s stay, he bonds with Gunnar over [[Povel Ramel]]'s recording of \"[[I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts|Far, jag kan inte f\u00e5 upp min kokosn\u00f6t]]\".\n\nIn the town he encounters a variety of characters. Saga, an assertive [[tomboy]] his own age, likes him, and shows it by beating him in a boxing match. Among the more eccentric residents is Fransson, a man who continually fixes the roof of his house, and Mr. Arvidsson, an old man living downstairs who gets Ingemar to read to him from a lingerie catalog.\n\nLater, Ingemar is reunited with his family, but his mother's health soon takes a turn for the worse and she is hospitalized. He and his brother go to stay with their uncle Sandberg in the city, but his wife thinks the boy is mentally disturbed. After his mother passes away, Ingemar is sent back to Sm\u00e5land.\n\nMr. Arvidsson has died in the interim; Gunnar and Ulla now share the house with a large Greek family. Gunnar welcomes him and consoles him as best he can, but the house is so crowded, he has Ingemar live with Mrs. Arvidsson in another house. Ingemar remains hopeful about being reunited with his dog and continues to ask his uncle if the dog can come stay with him. Meanwhile, Ingemar becomes the object of contention between Saga and another girl. When they start fighting over him, he grabs onto Saga's leg and starts [[Bark (utterance)|barking]] like a dog. She becomes upset by his strange behavior and gets him into the boxing ring. During the bout, out of spite, Saga tells Ingemar that his dog (which he had thought was in a kennel) was actually euthanized. This, along with his mother's death, is too much for him and he locks himself inside Gunnar's one-room \"[[summer house]]\" in the backyard. While secluded here, Ingemar reflects on the death of his mother, the loss of his dog and a changing world. Ingemar uses the experiences of others and of his own personal loss to reconcile a life which is sometimes tough.\n\nThroughout the film, Ingemar tells himself over and over that it could have been worse, reciting several examples, such as a man who took a shortcut onto the field during a track meet and was killed by a javelin and the story of the dog [[Laika]] several times, the first creature sent into orbit by the Russians (without any way to get her back down).\n\nThe film ends with the radio broadcast of a famous heavyweight championship boxing match, between Swede [[Ingemar Johansson]] and American [[Floyd Patterson]]. When Johansson wins, the whole town erupts with joy, but the now-reconciled Ingemar and Saga are fast asleep together on a couch, holding each other.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|* [[Anton Glanzelius]] as Ingemar\n* [[Tomas von Br\u00f6mssen]] as Uncle Gunnar\n* [[Melinda Kinnaman]] as Saga\n* [[Anki Lid\u00e9n]] as Ingemar's mother\n* Manfred Serner as Erik\n* Kicki Rundgren as Aunt Ulla\n* [[Lennart Hjulstr\u00f6m]] as The artist\n* [[Ing-Marie Carlsson]] as Berit\n* Leif Ericson as Sandberg\n* Christina Carlwind as Mrs. Sandberg\n* Ralph Carlsson as Harry\n* Viveca Dahl\u00e9n as Washing woman\n* Arnold Alfredsson as Manne's grandfather\n* Fritz Elofsson as Master\n* Vivi Johansson as Mrs. Arvidsson\n* Didrik Gustafsson as Arvidsson\n* Jan-Philip Hollstr\u00f6m as Manne, the boy with green hair\n* Johanna Ud\u00e9hn as Lilla\n* Klimpen as Sickan, Ingemar's dog\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Release ===\nThe film was first released in Sweden on 12 December 1985,<ref>{{Cite web |date=12 October 2011 |title=My Life as a Dog Blu-ray Review (The Criterion Collection) |url=https://www.dvdizzy.com/mylifeasadog.html |url-status=live |access-date=13 November 2021 |website=DVDizzy.com}}</ref> and had its American premiere on 1 May 1987.<ref name=\"box_office\"/> It became a critical and commercial success with American audiences, a rare feat for a subtitled foreign language film at the time.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sanchez |first=Rene |date=2 October 1987 |title='Life As A Dog' Star Is More Interested In Soccer Than Film |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-10-02/lifestyle/0150160014_1_anton-ahlin-glanzelius |url-status=dead |access-date=13 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224032420/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-10-02/lifestyle/0150160014_1_anton-ahlin-glanzelius |archive-date=24 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |title=My Life as a Dog |url=https://www.sfstudios100years.com/film/my-life-as-a-dog/ |url-status=live |access-date=13 November 2021 |website=SF Studios 100 \u00e5r |language=en-GB}}</ref> The international success of the film launched director [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]]\u2019s Hollywood career, as he would go on to direct ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape|What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape]]'' and ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' in the following years''.''<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe movie was well-received by critics.
