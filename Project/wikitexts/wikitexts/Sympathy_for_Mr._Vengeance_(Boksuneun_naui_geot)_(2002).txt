The film stars [[Shin Ha-kyun]] as Ryu, a young, deaf-mute factory worker trying to earn enough money for his sister's [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]] by holding the daughter of a wealthy man for ransom, and the path of vengeance that follows when the plan goes awry. Alongside Ha-kyun, the film's cast includes [[Song Kang-ho]], [[Bae Doona]], [[Han Bo-bae]], and [[Im Ji-eun]].\n\n''Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance'' did not fare well commercially upon its initial release in South Korea,<ref name=phillips>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-09-09-0509090357-story.html|title=Elegant facade hides dark heart|last=Phillips|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Phillips (critic)|date=9 September 2005|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=30 April 2020}}</ref> and has garnered mixed reviews. Despite this, it won several awards. It is the first installment in director Park's thematic ''[[Vengeance Trilogy]]'', and is followed by ''[[Oldboy (2003 film)|Oldboy]]'' (2003) and ''[[Lady Vengeance]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\nRyu is a [[deaf-mute]] man who works in a factory. His ailing sister is in desperate need of a [[kidney transplant]], but Ryu's is not a match. After he loses his job, Ryu contacts a group of [[black market]] [[organ trafficking|organ dealers]] to exchange one of his kidneys for one that his sister can use. However, the dealers disappear after taking Ryu's kidney and severance money. A legitimate [[kidney donor]] is found, but after having been conned by the organ dealers, Ryu is unable to afford the operation. To raise money, Yeong-mi, Ryu's radical anarchist girlfriend, suggests kidnapping the daughter of the executive that fired Ryu. They observe the executive with company president Park Dong-jin arriving at the latter's home one day, where one of Dong-jin's employees, Peng, attempts to commit ''[[harakiri]]'' in front of them. Ryu and Yeong-mi change their plan, deciding to kidnap Dong-jin's young daughter Yu-sun.\n\nYu-sun stays with Ryu's sister, who believes that Ryu is babysitting her. Ryu and Yeong-mi send a request for ransom to Dong-jin, and he obliges. Upon returning home with the ransom money, Ryu discovers that his sister learned that Yu-sun was kidnapped and not wanting to be a burden any longer, has committed suicide. Ryu takes Yu-sun and his sister's body to a riverbed they frequented as children to bury her. Distracted by the burial and unable to hear, Ryu is unaware when Yu-sun slips into the river, and she drowns. After Yu-sun's body is discovered by authorities, a deeply mournful Dong-jin hires an [[private investigator|investigator]] to find her kidnappers. Dong-jin finds Ryu's sister's corpse by the [[riverbed]], where he interacts with a mentally disabled man who witnessed Ryu burying his sister, and begins to piece together the identities of Ryu and Yeong-mi.\n\nRyu, armed with a [[baseball bat]], locates the organ traffickers and murders them, receiving a stab wound in the process. Meanwhile, Dong-jin finds Yeong-mi and tortures her with electricity, also killing a deliveryman who comes to her apartment. She apologizes for Yu-sun's death but warns Dong-jin that her terrorist friends will kill him if she dies. Unfazed, Dong-jin electrocutes her. Ryu returns to Yeong-mi's apartment and sees the police removing her corpse. Dong-jin knocks Ryu unconscious with a [[booby trap]]. He takes Ryu to the riverbed where his daughter died and drags him into the water. Dong-jin slashes Ryu's [[Achilles tendon|achilles tendon]] and waits for him to drown. After Dong-jin dismembers Ryu's corpse, Yeong-mi's [[anarchist]] associates arrive and stab Dong-jin, where they pin a note to his chest with a knife, and leaves him to die.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Park Dong-jin, Yu-sun's father and the president of a manufacturing company who is a friend of Ryu's employers\n* [[Shin Ha-kyun]] as Ryu, a deaf-mute factory worker trying to pay his sister's hospital bills\n* [[Bae Doona]] as Cha Yeong-mi, Ryu's girlfriend of several years\n* [[Han Bo-bae]] as Yu-sun, Dong-jin's young daughter\n* [[Im Ji-eun]] as Ryu's sister, who is in need of a kidney transplant\n* [[Lee Dae-yeon]] as Choi, the investigator hired by Dong-jin \n* [[Ryoo Seung-bum]] as a mentally disabled person at the lake\n* [[Ryoo Seung-wan]] as a food delivery person at Cha's apartment\n* [[Oh Kwang-rok]] as an anarchist\n* [[Lee Kan-hee]] as Park Dong-jin's ex-wife\n* [[Jung Jae-young]] as the husband of Dong-jin's ex-wife\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance'' opened in South Korea on March 29, 2002 and had a worldwide box office gross of {{USD|1,954,937}}.<ref name=mojo /> The film received a low-profile [[North America]]n theatrical release from [[Tartan Films]] beginning August 19, 2005, over three years after it debuted in South Korea.
