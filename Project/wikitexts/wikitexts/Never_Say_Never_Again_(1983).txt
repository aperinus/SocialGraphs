The film is based on the 1961 [[James Bond]] novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' by [[Ian Fleming]], which in turn was based on an original story by [[Kevin McClory]], [[Jack Whittingham]], and Fleming. The novel had been previously adapted in a 1965 film [[Thunderball (film)|of the same name]]. ''Never Say Never Again'' was not produced by [[Eon Productions]], the usual producer of the Bond series, but by [[Jack Schwartzman]]'s Taliafilm, and was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] instead of [[United Artists]]. The film was executive produced by Kevin McClory, one of the original writers of the ''Thunderball'' storyline. McClory retained the filming rights of the novel following a [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|long legal battle]] dating from the 1960s.\n\n[[Sean Connery]] played the role of Bond for the seventh and final time, marking his return to the character 12 years after ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''. The film's title is a reference to Connery's reported declaration in 1971 that he would \"never\" play that role again. As Connery was 52 at the time of filming, although nearly three years younger than incumbent Bond [[Roger Moore]], the storyline features an aging Bond who is brought back into action to investigate the theft of two nuclear weapons by [[SPECTRE]]. Filming locations included France, Spain, the Bahamas and [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in the United Kingdom.\n\n''Never Say Never Again'' was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] on 7 October 1983, and opened to positive reviews, with the acting of Connery and [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] singled out for praise as more emotionally resonant than the typical Bond films of the day. The film was a commercial success, grossing $160 million at the box office, although less overall than the Eon-produced ''[[Octopussy]]'',  released earlier the same year.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter [[MI6]] agent James Bond fails a routine training exercise, his superior [[M (James Bond)|M]] orders Bond to a health clinic outside London to get back into shape. While there, Bond witnesses a mysterious nurse named Fatima Blush giving a [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] beating to a patient in a nearby room. The man's face is bandaged and after Blush finishes her beating, Bond sees the patient using a machine which [[Retinal scan|scans his eye]]. Bond is seen by Blush, who sends an assassin, Lippe, to kill him in the clinic gym, but Bond manages to kill Lippe.\n\nBlush is an operative of [[SPECTRE]], a criminal organisation run by [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]; her charge is a [[heroin]]-addicted [[United States Air Force]] pilot named Jack Petachi. Petachi has undergone an operation on his right eye to make it match the [[retina]]l pattern of the [[President of the United States|US President]], which he uses to circumvent [[Iris recognition#Security considerations|iris recognition security]] at RAF Station Swadley, an [[United States Air Forces in Europe \u2013 Air Forces Africa#Operating bases|American military base in]] England.  While doing so, he replaces the dummy [[Nuclear warhead|warheads]] of two [[AGM-86 ALCM|AGM-86B]] [[cruise missile]]s with live [[W80 (nuclear warhead)|nuclear warheads]]; SPECTRE then steals the warheads, intending to extort billions of dollars from [[NATO]] governments. Blush murders Petachi by causing his car to crash and explode, covering SPECTRE's tracks.\n\n[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] Lord Ambrose orders a reluctant M to reactivate the [[00 agent|double-0 section]], and Bond is tasked with tracking down the missing weapons. Bond follows a lead to the [[Bahamas]] where he finds [[Domino Petachi]], the pilot's sister, and her wealthy lover Maximillian Largo, who is SPECTRE's top agent.\n\nBond is informed by Nigel Small-Fawcett of the British High Commission that Largo's yacht is now heading for [[Nice, France|Nice]], France. There, Bond joins forces with his French contact Nicole, and his [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] counterpart and friend, [[Felix Leiter]]. Bond goes to a health and beauty centre where he poses as an employee and, while giving Domino a massage, is informed by her that Largo is hosting an event at a casino that evening. At the charity event, Largo and Bond play a 3-D video game called ''Domination''; the losing player of each turn receives a series of [[electric shock]]s of increasing intensity in proportion to the amount wagered. After losing a few games, Bond ultimately wins, and while dancing with Domino, he informs her that her brother had been killed on Largo's orders. Bond returns to his villa to find Nicole killed by Blush. After a [[Car chase|vehicle chase]] on his Q-branch motorbike, Bond finds himself in an ambush and is eventually captured by Blush. She admits that she is impressed with him, and forces Bond to declare in writing that she is his \"Number One\" sexual partner. Bond distracts her with promises, then uses his Q-branch-issue fountain [[pen gun]] to kill Blush with an explosive dart.\n\nBond and Leiter attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the ''[[Disco Volante (ship)|Flying Saucer]]'', in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond finds Domino. He attempts to make Largo jealous by kissing Domino in front of a [[one-way mirror]]. Largo becomes enraged, traps Bond and takes him and Domino to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in [[North Africa]]. Largo coldly punishes Domino for her betrayal by selling her to some passing Arabs. Bond subsequently escapes from his prison and rescues her.\n\nDomino and Bond reunite with Leiter on a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] submarine. After the first warhead is found and defused in Washington, D.C., they track Largo to a location known as the Tears of Allah, below a desert [[oasis]] on the [[Ethiopia]]n coast. Bond and Leiter infiltrate the underground facility and a gun battle erupts between Leiter's team and Largo's men in the temple. In the confusion, Largo makes a getaway with the second warhead. Bond catches and fights Largo underwater. Just as Largo tries to use a spear gun to shoot Bond, he is shot with a spear gun by Domino, taking revenge for her brother's death. Bond then defuses the nuclear bomb underwater, saving the world. Bond retires from duty and returns to the Bahamas with Domino, vowing never again to be a secret agent.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- poster billing starts here -->\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], [[MI6]] agent 007.\n* [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] as Maximillian Largo, a billionaire businessman and SPECTRE Number 1, SPECTRE's senior-most agent.
