The film tells the story of truck driver Jack Burton (Russell), who helps his friend Wang Chi (Dun) rescue Wang's green-eyed fianc\u00e9e from bandits in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]]. They go into the mysterious underworld beneath Chinatown, where they face an ancient sorcerer named David Lo Pan (Hong), who requires a woman with green eyes to marry him in order to be released from a centuries-old curse.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Roth|first=Dany|date=2020|title=The reason the Big Trouble in Little China 2 writer hated the original|url=https://www.looper.com/272925/the-reason-the-big-trouble-in-little-china-2-writer-hated-the-original/|access-date=December 12, 2020|website=Looper|archive-date=April 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210409022456/https://www.looper.com/272925/the-reason-the-big-trouble-in-little-china-2-writer-hated-the-original/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the original screenplay by first-time screenwriters [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]] and David Z. Weinstein was envisioned as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] set in the 1880s, screenwriter [[W. D. Richter]] was hired to rewrite the script extensively and modernize it. The studio hired Carpenter to direct the film and rushed ''Big Trouble in Little China'' into production so that it would be released before a similarly themed [[Eddie Murphy]] film, ''[[The Golden Child]]'', which was slated to come out around the same time. The project fulfilled Carpenter's long-standing desire to make a martial arts film.\n\nThe film was a commercial failure, grossing $11.1 million in North America, below its estimated $19 to $25 million budget. It received generally positive reviews, but left Carpenter disillusioned with [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and influenced his decision to return to independent filmmaking. It gained a steady audience on [[home video]] and has become a [[cult following|cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\nTruck driver Jack Burton wins a bet with his friend Wang Chi. To make sure he follows through on payment, Jack accompanies him to the airport to pick up Wang's Chinese fianc\u00e9e Miao Yin, where a Chinese-American street gang, the Lords of Death, tries to kidnap another Chinese girl. She is being met by her friend Gracie Law. After Jack intervenes, they take Miao Yin instead.\n\nJack and Wang track the Lords of Death to [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], where they find a funeral procession that erupts into a battle between the Chang Sing and Wing Kong, two ancient Chinese warrior societies. When \"The Three Storms\" \u2013 Thunder, Rain, and Lightning, warriors with weather-themed powers \u2013 appear, slaughtering the Chang Sing, Jack attempts to gun his big-rig through the crowd, but runs over David Lo Pan, a man directing the Three Storms. Horrified, Jack exits his truck, but finds Lo Pan unhurt and glowing with magic. Wang hurriedly guides Jack through the alleys; the two escape, but Jack's truck is stolen.\n\nWang takes Jack to his restaurant, where they meet with Gracie, her journalist friend Margo, Wang's friend Eddie Lee, and magician Egg Shen, a local authority on mysticism and Lo Pan. They explain to Jack (who only wants his truck back) the ancient knowledge and sorcery the Chinese brought with them to America. The group devises a plan to infiltrate a brothel, where they believe Miao Yin is held. They break in, but are interrupted by the Storms who kidnap Miao Yin, and take her to Lo Pan. Jack and Wang track down the front business used by Lo Pan and impersonate telephone repairmen to gain access, but are quickly subdued by Rain. After being tied up and beaten by Thunder, the two meet Lo Pan \u2013 however, he now appears as a crippled old man.\n\nWang tells Jack that Lo Pan needs a green-eyed girl to break an ancient curse, and he intends to sacrifice Miao Yin. Centuries ago, Lo Pan was defeated in battle by Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]]. He cursed Lo Pan with [[incorporeality]]; although Lo Pan can be temporarily granted a decrepit body by supplication to the gods, he can permanently break the curse by marrying a woman with green eyes and sacrificing her. Jack and Wang's friends attempt to save them, and are also captured. After getting the drop on Thunder, Jack, Wang, and Eddie escape and free women kept in cells. An [[orangutan]]-like Wild-Man recaptures Gracie before she escapes. Lo Pan notes that Gracie has green eyes, too, and decides to sacrifice her while making Miao Yin his wife.\n\nWang and Jack regroup with the Chang Sing and Egg Shen, and enter a cavern to return to Lo Pan's headquarters. Egg pours the group a potent potion. They interrupt the wedding, and start a battle. Wang kills Rain in a sword duel, while Jack and Gracie chase Lo Pan, who has regained his corporeal form by consuming a few drops of Miao Yin's blood. Wang joins them; Lo Pan attempts to kill Jack with a throwing knife, but Jack catches it and kills him with a throw to his head. Thunder \u2013 who had been distracted with Wang \u2013 reappears, and, enraged at finding Lo Pan dead, swells up and explodes. Jack, Wang, Gracie, and Miao Yin are cornered by Lightning in a corridor, who triggers a collapse. Egg rescues them with a rope and kills Lightning by dropping a [[Buddha statue]] on him when he tries to follow. After finding Jack's truck and dealing with the remaining Wing Kong guards, the group escapes back to Wang's restaurant.\n\nThe group celebrates in the restaurant; Wang and Miao Yin prepare to marry, while Eddie pairs with Margo. Egg sets off to China. Gracie offers to join Jack but he leaves alone. Unbeknownst to him, the Wild-Man survived the battle and has stowed away on his truck.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Jack Burton, a cocky, wise-cracking truck driver who gets involved in an ancient battle between Good and Evil when he makes a delivery to [[Chinatown, San Francisco]].\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Gracie Law, a lawyer who is Jack's love interest.\n* [[Dennis Dun]] as Wang Chi, Jack's best friend and restaurant owner whose fianc\u00e9e is kidnapped by Lo Pan.\n* [[James Hong]] as David Lo Pan, an ancient Chinese sorcerer who was cursed by Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]].\n* [[Victor Wong (actor, born 1927)|Victor Wong]] as Egg Shen, a sorcerer and old enemy of Lo Pan who also drives a tour bus.\n* [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]] as Margo Litzenberger, a reporter who briefly helps the team find Miao Yin.\n* [[Donald Li]] as Eddie Lee, a successful businessman and Wang's friend who helps them rescue Gracie.\n* [[Carter Wong]] as Thunder, an elemental master who can expand his body\n* Peter Kwong as Rain, an elemental master and expert martial artist with a sword\n* [[James Pax]] as Lightning, an elemental master who can shoot out bolts of lightning\n* [[Suzee Pai]] as Miao Yin, Wang's fiancee, who was kidnapped by Lo Pan when she arrives in America.\n* [[Chao-Li Chi]] as Uncle Chu, Wang's uncle.\n* [[Jeff Imada]] as Needles, a member of a street gang called The Lords of Death.\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Al Leong]], [[Gerald Okamura]] and [[Nathan Jung]] appear as Wing Kong hatchet men.

[[Noble Craig]] appears as \"Sewer Monster\".\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\nThe first version of the screenplay was written by first-time screenwriters [[Gary Goldman (screenwriter)|Gary Goldman]] and David Z. Weinstein. Goldman had been inspired by a new wave of martial arts films that had \"all sorts of weird actions and special effects, shot against this background of Oriental mysticism and modern sensibilities\".<ref name=\"Teitelbaum\">{{cite news|last=Teitelbaum|first=Sheldon|date=July 1986|title=''Big Trouble in Little China''|pages=4\u20135|work=[[Cinefantastique]]|url=https://archive.org/stream/cinefantastique_1970-2002/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2016%20No%203%20%28July%201986%29#page/n3/mode/2up}}</ref> They had written a Western originally set in the 1880s with Jack Burton as a cowboy who rides into town.<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\">{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Lee|date=June 1986|title=W.

Monash bought their script and had them do at least one rewrite but still did not like the results. He remembers, \"The problems came largely from the fact it was set in turn-of-the-century San Francisco, which affected everything\u2014style, dialogue, action\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> Goldman rejected a request by [[20th Century Fox]] for a rewrite that asked for major alterations. He was angered when the studio wanted to update it to a contemporary setting. The studio then removed the writers from the project. However, they still wanted credit for their contributions.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\">Teitelbaum July 1986, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe studio brought in screenwriter [[W. D. Richter]], a veteran [[script doctor]] (and director of ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension|The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai]]'') to extensively rewrite the script, as he felt that the Wild West and fantasy elements did not work together. The screenwriter modernized everything. Almost everything in the original script was discarded except for Lo Pan's story.<ref name=\"Goldberg2\">{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Lee|date=May 1986|title=''Big Trouble in Little China''|pages=28\u201331|work=[[Starlog]]|issue=106|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-106/page/n27/mode/2up}}</ref> Richter realized that \"what it needed wasn't a rewrite but a complete overhaul. It was a dreadful screenplay. This happens often when scripts are bought and there's no intention that the original writers will stay on\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> Richter used ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' as his template, presenting \"the foreground story in a familiar context \u2013 rather than San Francisco at the turn-of-the-century, which distances the audience immediately \u2013 and just have one simple remove, the world underground, you have a much better chance of making direct contact with the audience\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> He wrote his own draft in 10 weeks.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum2\"/> Goldman contacted Richter and suggested that he should not work on the project. Richter told him, \"I'm sorry the studio doesn't want to go forward with you guys, but my turning it down is not going to get you the job. They'll just hire someone else\".<ref name=\"Teitelbaum2\"/>\n\nFox wanted to deny Goldman and Weinstein writing credit, and eliminated their names from press releases.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\"/> They wanted only Richter to have credit.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum4\">Teitelbaum (July 1986), p. 58.</ref> In March 1986, the [[Writers Guild of America, West]] determined that \"written by\" credit would go to Goldman and Weinstein, based on the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] which protects original writers.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\"/><ref name=\"Swires, Steve\">{{cite news|last=Swires|first=Steve|date=August 1986|title=John Carpenter: Kung Fu, Hollywood Style|pages=10\u201313|work=[[Starlog]]|issue=109|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-109/page/n9/mode/2up}}</ref> However, Richter did get an \"adaptation by\" credit for his work on the script. Director John Carpenter was disappointed that Richter did not get a proper screenwriting credit because of the ruling. Carpenter made his own additions to Richter's rewrites, which included strengthening the Gracie Law role and linking her to Chinatown, removing a few action sequences due to budgetary restrictions and eliminating material deemed offensive to Chinese Americans. The characters in the film reminded Carpenter \"of the characters in ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' or ''[[His Girl Friday]]''. These are very 1930s, [[Howard Hawks]] people.\"<ref name=\"Goldberg2\"/> The rapid-fire delivery of dialogue, especially between Jack Burton and Gracie Law, is an example of what the director is referring to.<ref name=\"Goldberg2\"/>\n\nHong Kong [[wuxia]] films, particularly [[Tsui Hark]]'s ''[[Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain]]'' (1983), also served as an influence.<ref>{{Cite web |last=jbindeck2015 |date=2018-07-02 |title=Zu: The Movie That Inspired Big Trouble In Little China |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/zu-the-movie-that-inspired-big-trouble-in-little-china/ |access-date=2022-09-28 |website=Den of Geek |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nBarish and Monash first offered the project to Carpenter in July 1985. He had read the Goldman/Weinstein script and deemed it \"outrageously unreadable though it had many interesting elements\".<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> To compete with rival production ''[[The Golden Child]]''\u2019s casting of box office draw [[Eddie Murphy]], Carpenter wanted a big star of his own and both [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] were considered but were busy.<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/>\n\nThe studio felt Kurt Russell was an up-and-coming star. Russell was initially not interested because he felt there were \"a number of different ways to approach Jack, but I didn't know if there was a way that would be interesting enough for this movie\".<ref name=\"Goldberg3\">{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Lee|date=July 1986|title=Kurt Russell: Two-Fisted Hero|work=[[Starlog]]|issue=108|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-108/page/n35/mode/2up}}</ref> After talking to Carpenter and reading the script a few more times, he gained insight into the character and liked the notion of playing \"a hero who has so many faults. Jack is and isn't the hero. He falls on his ass as much as he comes through. This guy is a real blowhard. He's a lot of hot air, very self-assured, a screw-up\".<ref name=\"Goldberg3\"/> Furthermore, the actor felt that \"at heart he thinks he's [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] but the circumstances are always too much for him\".<ref name=\"Scott, Vernon\">{{cite news| last = Scott| first = Vernon| title = Kurt as Klutz| work = United Press International| date = July 9, 1986}}</ref> Russell felt that the film would be a hard one to market. \"This is a difficult picture to sell because it's hard to explain. It's a mixture of the real history of Chinatown in San Francisco blended with Chinese legend and lore. It's bizarre stuff. There are only a handful of non-Asian actors in the cast\".<ref name=\"Scott, Vernon\"/>\n\nJohn Carpenter had seen Dennis Dun in ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]'' and liked his work in that film. He met the actor twice before casting him in the role of Wang Chi only a few days before principal photography.<ref name=\"Dickholtz, Daniel\">{{cite news|last=Dickholtz|first=Daniel|date=September 1986|title=Dennis Dun, Kung Fu Hero|page=67|work=[[Starlog]]|issue=110|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-110/page/n65/mode/2up}}</ref> The martial arts sequences were not hard for Dun who had \"dabbled\" in training as a kid and done Chinese opera as an adult.<ref name=\"Dickholtz, Daniel\"/> He was drawn to the portrayal of Asian characters in the movie as he said, \"I\u2019m seeing Chinese actors getting to do stuff that American movies usually don\u2019t let them do. I\u2019ve never seen this type of role for an Asian in an American film\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> [[Jackie Chan]] was at one point considered for the role of Wang Chi but decided after the box office disasters of ''[[The Big Brawl]]'' and ''[[The Protector (1985 film)|The Protector]]'' he should put more time and effort into his career in [[Hong Kong]]'s film industry with ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' instead.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe studio pressured Carpenter to cast a rock star in the role of Gracie Law, Jack Burton's love interest, but Carpenter wanted Kim Cattrall. The studio was not keen on the idea because at the time Cattrall was primarily known for raunchy comedies like ''[[Porky's]]'' and ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]''. She was drawn to the film because of the way her character was portrayed. \"I'm not screaming for help the whole time. I think the humor comes out of the situations and my relationship with Jack Burton. I\u2019m the brains and he's the brawn\".<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\nKurt Russell lifted weights and began running two months before production began to prepare for the physical demands of principal photography. In addition, Carpenter and his cast and crew did a week's rehearsals that mainly involved choreographing the martial arts scenes.<ref name=\"Steranko\">{{cite news |last = Steranko |first = Jim |title = The Trouble with Kurt |work = Prevue |pages = 73 | date = August 1986}}</ref> 20th Century Fox was afraid that the production would create major overruns and hired Carpenter to direct because he could work fast. He was given only 10 weeks of pre-production.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum3\"/>\n\nProblems began to arise when Carpenter learned that the next Eddie Murphy vehicle, ''The Golden Child'', featured a similar theme and was going to be released around the same time as ''Big Trouble in Little China'' (As it happened, Carpenter was asked by [[Paramount Pictures]] to direct ''The Golden Child''). He remarked in an interview, \"How many adventure pictures dealing with Chinese mysticism have been released by the major studios in the past 20 years? For two of them to come along at the exact same time is more than mere coincidence,\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/> To beat the rival production at being released in theaters, ''Big Trouble'' went into production in October 1985 so it could open in July 1986, five months before ''The Golden Child''{{'}}s Christmas release.\n\nAlthough the early exterior establishing scenes were filmed on location in Chinatown,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nortonsmoviemaps.com/blog/big-trouble-in-little-china |title=Big Trouble in Little China |author=Larson, Erika |date=February 5, 2015 |website=Norton's Movie Maps [blog] |access-date=24 January 2020 |archive-date=January 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200124210752/http://www.nortonsmoviemaps.com/blog/big-trouble-in-little-china |url-status=live }}</ref> most of the film was shot on sets built in the [[20th Century Studios|Fox lot]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Collis, Clark|date=July 16, 2016|title=Big Trouble in Little China oral history|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=https://ew.com/comic-con/2016/07/16/big-trouble-little-china-oral-history/|access-date=21 January 2020|archive-date=February 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210226182418/https://ew.com/comic-con/2016/07/16/big-trouble-little-china-oral-history/|url-status=live}}</ref> Production designer John Lloyd designed the elaborate underground sets and recreated Chinatown with three-story buildings, roads, streetlights, sewers and so on. This was necessary for the staging of complicated special effects and kung fu fight sequences that would have been very hard to do on location.<ref name=\"Goldberg, Lee\"/> This forced the filmmaker to shoot the film in 15 weeks with a $25 million budget. For the film's many fight scenes Carpenter worked with martial arts choreographer [[James Lew]], who planned out every move in advance. Says Carpenter, \"I used every cheap gag \u2013 trampolines, wires, reverse movements and upside down sets. It was much like photographing a dance.\"<ref name=\"Swires, Steve\"/>\n\nCarpenter envisioned the film as an inverse of traditional scenarios in action films with a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] protagonist helped by a minority sidekick. In ''Big Trouble in Little China'', Jack Burton, despite his bravado, is constantly portrayed as rather bumbling; in one fight sequence, he knocks himself unconscious before the fight begins. Wang Chi, on the other hand, is constantly portrayed as highly skilled and competent. On a [[audio commentary|commentary track]] for the DVD release, Carpenter said the film is really about a sidekick (Burton) who thinks he is a leading man. According to Carpenter, the studio \"didn't get it\"<ref name=\"Nichols\">{{cite news |last = Nichols |first = Peter M |title = ''Big Trouble'': Big Comeback |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = May 25, 2001 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/25/movies/home-video-big-trouble-big-comeback.html |access-date = 2008-12-02 |archive-date = July 27, 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180727212421/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/25/movies/home-video-big-trouble-big-comeback.html?sq=%22Big+Trouble+in+Little+China%22&scp=1&st=nyt |url-status = live }}</ref> and made him write something that would explain the character of Jack Burton.

[[Richard Edlund]], head of Boss Film Studios, said that there were no difficulties with the company's workload and that ''Big Trouble'' was probably its favorite film at the time, with the exception of ''[[Ghostbusters]]''.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum4\"/> The effects budget for the film was just under $2 million, which Edlund said was barely adequate. One of the more difficult effects was the floating eyeball, a spy for Lo-Pan. It was powered by several [[puppeteer]]s and dozens of cables to control its facial expressions. It was shot with a special matting system specially designed for it.<ref name=\"Teitelbaum4\"/>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Big Trouble in Little China (soundtrack)}}\nJohn Carpenter was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Music for this film.<ref>{{IMDb title|90728|section=awards}}</ref> With the soundtrack, Carpenter wanted to avoid the usual clich\u00e9s, as he found that \"other scores for American movies about Chinese characters are basically rinky tink, chop suey music.
