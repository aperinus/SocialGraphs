The film stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Anne Hathaway]], and [[Rene Russo]], with supporting performances from [[Anders Holm]], [[Andrew Rannells]], [[Adam DeVine]], and [[Zack Pearlman]]. The plot follows a 70-year-old widower who becomes a senior intern at an online fashion website, where he forms an unlikely friendship with the company's workaholic CEO. The film was released on September 25, 2015, by [[Warner Bros]]. It received mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success, grossing $195&nbsp;million worldwide against a $35 million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\nSeventy-year-old widower Ben Whittaker, a retired executive from [[DEX One]], applies to fill the newly conceived position of senior intern, after retirement has become too boring for him. He applies to About The Fit, a fast-growing [[e-commerce]] fashion startup in [[Brooklyn]]. Founder and CEO Jules Ostin had previously agreed to a community outreach program where seniors would intern at the firm. Ben impresses everyone and is one of four hired.\n\nBen is assigned to work with Jules, who is somewhat skeptical at first. Initially frozen out by her, Ben slowly wins over co-workers with his congeniality and gets into Jules's good graces. He also helps numerous employees with their tasks. Ben comes to work at 7:00 A.M. one day to organize a messy desk that Jules had complained about previously. After work, Ben notices Jules's chauffeur drinking, convinces the driver to leave and drives Jules home himself, a role he retains in days to come. On their first drive together, Ben asks several questions about Jules' personal life, and she asks one of her employees to transfer Ben to be an intern for someone else. But by the end of the day, they become very close. The next day, Jules arrives to the car to see Ben has been replaced as her driver by Doris. Doris is a horrible driver, driving into someone else's car and almost crashing into a building. Jules drives to About The Fit and begs Ben to come back, and so he does as she has no license.\n\nBen eventually reveals that he once worked in the very same building where About The Fit is now based. He develops a romantic relationship with the in-house massage therapist, Fiona, and becomes something of a father figure to several of the younger workers: by offering advice about issues such as love, clothes sense and work/life balance. He provides one of them with a place to stay at his [[brownstone]] after being evicted by his parents. Ben becomes very committed to Jules, and even breaks into the house of Jules' mother to delete an embarrassingly scathing email, narrowly avoiding getting arrested in the process. Ben also gets to know Jules' family. Her husband, Matt, gave up his own career to be a [[stay-at-home dad]] to their daughter, Paige, when About The Fit started to take off. However, their marriage is slowly breaking apart as the couple grows more distant.\n\nMeanwhile, Jules is under pressure to give up her post of CEO to someone outside of the company as her investors feel that she is unable to cope with the workload, having grown About The Fit from a startup founded in her kitchen to a 220-employee juggernaut in only eighteen months. Believing it will give her more time at home with her family, Jules is willing to consider the proposal. When driving Paige home from a party, Ben discovers that Matt is having an affair with another parent at Paige's school. While on a business trip in [[San Francisco]] to interview a potential CEO candidate, Jules reveals that she knows about Matt's cheating, but did not confront Matt about it because she was not ready to deal with it.\n\nIn an effort to buy herself time to save her marriage, Jules decides to hire a prospective CEO. When Jules goes to Ben's home the next day, Ben greatly encourages Jules to think about how much this will change her authority and how her creativity may be hindered and also reminds her of her passion for her company. Matt unexpectedly drops in at the office and urges her to reconsider, saying that he is sorry, ashamed, and wants to support her in her dreams. Jules goes out looking for Ben, wanting to tell him that she has changed her mind and finds him enjoying his [[tai chi]] exercise group. She finally lets herself relax and joins him in practicing tai chi, an act symbolic of her finding balance in her life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Ben Whittaker\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Jules Ostin\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Fiona\n* [[Anders Holm]] as Matt Ostin\n* [[Andrew Rannells]] as Cameron\n* [[Adam DeVine]] as Jason\n* [[Zack Pearlman]] as Davis\n* Jason Orley as Lewis\n* Christina Scherer as Becky\n* JoJo Kushner as Paige Ostin\n* [[Nat Wolff]] as Justin\n* [[Linda Lavin]] as Patty\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Doris\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Mrs. Ostin (voice only)\n* [[Steve Vinovich]] as Miles\n* [[Molly Bernard]] as Samantha\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nOriginally set up at [[Paramount Pictures]], ''The Intern'' was planned to feature [[Tina Fey]] and [[Michael Caine]] in the lead roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2012/04/paramount-lands-the-intern-a-nancy-meyers-comedy-with-tina-fey-starring-256384/|title=Paramount Lands Nancy Meyers-Tina Fey Comedy 'The Intern'|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Mike Jr.|last=Fleming|date=April 13, 2012|access-date=June 9, 2019}}</ref> Handed over to [[Warner Bros.]], Fey was replaced by [[Reese Witherspoon]] as the attached star, though Witherspoon left the film on January 15, 2014, due to scheduling conflicts.<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Reese Witherspoon No Longer Attached to Nancy Meyers' 'The Intern'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/reese-witherspoon-nancy-meyers-the-intern-1201059545/|access-date=June 23, 2014|publisher=variety.com|date=January 15, 2014}}</ref> On February 7, 2014, [[Anne Hathaway]] was in final talks to replace Witherspoon in the lead role.<ref name=Hathaway>{{cite news|title=Anne Hathaway in Talks to Replace Reese Witherspoon in The Intern|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anne-hathaway-talks-replace-reese-678533|access-date=June 23, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> [[Stephen Goldblatt]] was set as director of photography.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCue|first1=Michelle|title=Nancy Meyers' THE INTERN Begins Filming \u2013 Stars Anne Hathaway And Robert De Niro|url=http://www.wearemoviegeeks.com/2014/06/nancy-meyers-intern-begins-filming-stars-anne-hathaway-robert-de-niro/|access-date=June 24, 2014|publisher=wearemoviegeeks.com|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref> On June 23, 2014, [[Zack Pearlman]] joined the cast of the film.<ref name=Pearlman>{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title='Mulaney' Actor Joins Anne Hathaway, Robert De Niro in 'The Intern'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mulaney-actor-joins-anne-hathaway-714118|access-date=June 25, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June 23, 2014, in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]],<ref>{{cite news|title=First filming location for 'The Intern', starring Anne Hathaway & Robert De Niro, in Brooklyn!|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2014/06/16/first-filming-location-for-the-intern-starring-anne-hathaway-robert-de-niro-in-brooklyn/|access-date=June 23, 2014|publisher=onlocationvacations.com|date=June 16, 2014}}</ref> where De Niro was spotted on the set of the film.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Christine|title=Photos of Robert De Niro filming 'The Intern' in Brooklyn|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2014/06/24/photos-of-robert-de-niro-filming-the-intern-in-brooklyn/|access-date=June 26, 2014|publisher=onlocationvacations.com|date=June 24, 2014}}</ref> Filming was completed on October 2, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/tqy8K7LbaD/author=Nancy Meyer's Instagram Page |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/s/instagram/tqy8K7LbaD |archive-date=2021-12-24 |url-access=limited|title=Nancy Meyers (@nmeyers) on Instagram }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''The Intern'' grossed $75.7&nbsp;million in North America and $118.8&nbsp;million in other territories for a worldwide total of $194.6&nbsp;million, against a net production budget of $35&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\nThe film opened alongside ''[[Hotel Transylvania 2]]'' and was projected to gross $15\u201320 million in its opening weekend.<ref name=\"deadline-opening\" /> It grossed $17.7&nbsp;million, finishing second at the box office behind ''Hotel Transylvania 2'' ($48.5&nbsp;million).<ref name=\"deadline-opening\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/09/the-intern-hotel-transylvania-2-the-green-inferno-weekend-box-office-1201550112/|title='Hotel Transylvania 2' At $48.5M Marks Record Opening For Adam Sandler; 'Intern' Slacks on Sunday \u2013 Monday Postmortem|author=Anthony D'Alessandro|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=([[Penske Media Corporation]])|date=September 28, 2015|access-date=September 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 59% based on 193 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10.
