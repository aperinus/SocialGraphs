Television]] with [[Richard Chamberlain]] in the title role, along with [[Jaclyn Smith]]. It follows the storyline of the original novel, with a run-time of 3 hours 5 min. With commercials added, the running time was extended to four hours. The film was first shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in two 120 minute installments over two nights.\n\nThe book was [[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|adapted again in 2002]] by [[Doug Liman]] starring [[Matt Damon]] as [[Jason Bourne]], launching the [[Bourne (franchise)|''Bourne'' series]] of theatrical films, with considerable deviations from the original Cold War novel.<ref name=\"allmovie\" /><ref name=\"Bibbiani \">{{cite web | url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/articles/177377-remake-rumble-the-bourne-identity-vs-the-bourne-identity | title='The Bourne Identity' vs. 'The Bourne Identity' | publisher=CraveOnline Media | work=Remake Rumble | date=November 3, 2011 | access-date=1 August 2013 | author=William Bibbiani}}</ref> It was followed later by a new series of ''Bourne'' best sellers written by [[Eric Lustbader]] with the permission of the Ludlum estate.\n\n==Differences from the book==\nThe film exhibits some differences from the novel by Ludlum. The undercover identity of Jason Bourne is simplified to \"Bourne\" pursuing Carlos rather than using the code name \"Cain\". Alexander Conklin is killed by one of his own people when attempting to confront Bourne; in the novel he survives and appears in subsequent novels. In the book's ending, [[Carlos the Jackal]] escapes in the confusion, whereas in the film he is killed in the climactic battle with Bourne.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Richard Chamberlain]] as [[Jason Bourne]]\n*[[Jaclyn Smith]] as Marie St. Jacques\n*[[Anthony Quayle]] as Gen.
