They soon develop a friendship, with Gene deciding to take him under his wing and teach him how to attract women. \n\nJonathan's main objective is to win over the sexy Marilyn McCauley, in spite of his shyness. Gene proclaims that he can groom him to win her over in a month. \n\nGene has his own love life to maintain with his crush, Bunny Miller, who reciprocates his feelings. He also has to defend Jonathan and himself from the wealthy class bully, Kenny, Bunny's jealous [[jock (stereotype)|jock]] boyfriend.\n\nAfter a confrontation at the drive-in, Kenny challenges Gene to a game with their cars, center line chicken. Neither backs down in time, so both cars are damaged. Gene's father hits him for damaging the car and grounds him. This shows the dysfunctional relationship he has with his widowed father, who has zero tolerance for Gene's often wild escapades.\n\nJonathan gives Gene much needed support and friendship. And likewise Gene helps him with his self-esteem. Marilyn agrees to go out with Jonathan and they get very involved. At the same time, Gene and Bunny progress with he talking about his future dream to own a horse stable. \n\nAfter an evening scuffle at the local diner instigated by the pompous Kenny that results in some damage to the premises, Gene's father kicks him out. Gone for weeks, he reappears on the night of the prom. Hunting down Jonathan, they go to the prom without tuxes. Marilyn has gone with her ex, a quarterback she dated the previous year, Bunny is there with Kenny.\n\nThe guys take off, with Bunny trying to chase after Gene. A bit outside of town they stop and catch up. Gene has relocated to Kentucky, where he has gotten work in a stable. He's come back for Bunny, but now thinks she won't go with him. Jonathan goes to find her, they reconcile, and take off for Kentucky on his motorcycle.\n\nBack in town, Jonathan informs Bunny's family that she's gone, stands up to Kenny by totaling his car and finally asks out Rosalie, who no longer has braces or glasses\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Doug McKeon]] as Jonathan Bellah\n* [[Chris Nash (actor)|Chris Nash]] as Eugene \"Gene\" Harbrough\n* [[Catherine Mary Stewart]] as Bunny Miller\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Marilyn McCauley\n* [[D.W.

He said this was because \"I turned 18 during the making of the film, and thus I was an \u201cadult\u201d for the first time in my career and didn't need a guardian with me anymore. Moreover, all the actors on that film (Chris Nash, Kelly Preston, Catherine Mary Stewart, and Jami Gertz) were so much fun to be around. Furthermore, the film took place in the 1950s, and driving the old cars, listening to that era's music, wearing the clothes, etc. It was really enjoyable.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melissasueandersonfan.com/Doug_McKeon.html|title=Interview with Doug McKeon|website=Melissa Sue Anderson Fan}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 57% based on reviews from 7 critics.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Mischief (1985) |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1013984-mischief/ |access-date=2020-09-13 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Boston Globe'' said the film \"falls out somewhere in the middle of the nostalgia pile. It's not as bad as the worst, not as good as the best. It's likable, but it's stolen by its props. They're more specific than the characters, starting with the locale. The filmmakers were lucky to find the real-life town of [[Nelsonville, Ohio]], for their look back at high school life in 1956. \"<ref>{{cite news | title= 'Mischief' Super on '50s, Shallow on Plot | last= Carr |first= Jay| work= Boston Globe | date= 8 February 1985| page= 49}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Los Angeles Times'' said, \"Neither terrible nor outstanding, it's the kind of middle-of-the-road picture that's hard to remember a week after seeing it. \"<ref>\nMOVIE REVIEW GETTING INTO 'MISCHIEF' IN THE '50S: [Home Edition] Thomas, Kevin.

With its summery settings, pretty costumes and pastel hues, ''Mischief'' is nostalgic and then some; it has the quality of something remembered in especially flattering light.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=8 February 1985 |last=Maslin |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Maslin |title=Film: 'Mischief,' a Tale of 50's Youth |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/08/movies/film-mischief-a-tale-of-50-s-youth.html | work=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0089601|title=Mischief}}\n* {{Amg movie|32860|Mischief}}\n\n{{Mel Damski}}\n\n[[Category:1985 films]]\n[[Category:1985 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Romantic period films]]\n[[Category:Films about virginity]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1956]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ohio]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mel Damski]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Barry De Vorzon]]\n[[Category:1980s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:Teen sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
