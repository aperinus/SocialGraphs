Jackson]] and [[Lucy Liu]]. It aired on [[Paramount Network|Spike]] on January 25, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nLacking any sense of purpose after taking revenge on Justice, the Number 1 headband bearer, Afro Samurai, spends his days making wooden sculptures of historical figures and has not fought a duel in years. Jinno, his sworn brother who is now an emotionless cyborg, and his sister, Lady Sio, ambush and beat him severely, taking both the headband and his deceased father Rokutaro's [[mandible]]. Sio tells Afro that they will resurrect Rokutaro and use him for vengeance, challenging Afro to find the Number 2 headband if he still has the will to fight.\n\nAfter getting his rusted sword reforged, Afro goes to a gambling house, where the last surviving member of the Empty Seven Clan, Brother 3, challenges him to a dice game for the identity of the Number 2. Afro discovers Brother 3 cheating and forces him to reveal that the Number 2 now belongs to the [[ronin]] Shichigoro. Afro unknowingly saves Shichigoro's adopted son Kotaro, but then kills the swordsman in front of him, leaving Kotaro to mourn his father and swear revenge. Claiming the Number 2 headband, Afro goes on to destroy three cyborg warriors, who turn out to be Sio's foster brothers and sister. Sio uses forbidden science to resurrect Rokutaro, turning him into a soulless warrior.\n\nWith Afro injured by his previous fight, Rokutaro easily beats him with his superior strength and speed, choking his son until he loses consciousness. The sight of Afro dying causes Jinno to remember the bond they once shared as brothers, and he attacks Rokutaro, who mutilates his body. Sio tries to save her brother, and Rokutaro impales her through Jinno's body. As they lay dying, a spark from Jinno's body travels through Sio's spilled blood and revives Afro. He accepts that Rokutaro is not his real father and kills him. Afro takes back the Number 1 headband and gives the Number 2 to Kotaro, telling him that he will be ready for when he wants to avenge Shichigoro. As Afro takes his leave, his imaginary companion Ninja Ninja reappears before him, stating about the endless cycle of revenge and bloodshed. Afro heads on and makes his way to Mount Shumi, where he awaits his next challenger as the Number 1.\n\n===Difference between versions===\nThe ending differs between the DVD and television broadcast editions of the film. In the television version, Afro reclaims the headband and runs into a masked man as the image of Justice appears for a split second. In the Director's Cut DVD edition, Afro reclaims the Number 1 headband. After the credits, Justice reappears.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Samuel L.
