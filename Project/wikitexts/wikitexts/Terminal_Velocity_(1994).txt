It follows a daredevil [[skydiving|skydiver]] (Sheen) who is caught up in a criminal plot by [[Russian mafia|Russian mobsters]] (Gandolfini and McDonald), forcing him to team up with a freelance secret agent (Kinski) in order to survive. It was one of two [[skydiving]]-themed [[action film]]s released in the [[Calendar year|fourth quarter]] of 1994 (the other being [[Paramount Pictures]]' [[Drop Zone (film)|''Drop Zone'']]), and received mostly negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nAbout to leave the country, a young [[Russians|Russian woman]] is ambushed in her [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] apartment after calling her contact about a [[Boeing 747]] she witnessed landing in the desert. The lead assailant, Kerr, tortures her for information about her roommate before drowning her in an [[aquarium]].\n\nFormer [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gymnast-turned-daredevil [[skydiver]] Ditch Brodie participates in an illegal [[BASE jumping|BASE jump]] off of a [[skyscraper]], despite his jump school being under tight scrutiny by the [[FAA]]. Upon returning to his school, he's approached by a beautiful but nervous woman named Chris Morrow, who insists on performing a static jump from cruising altitude immediately. Playing along due to her [[flirtatious]] attitude, Ditch agrees to take her himself. During the flight, Chris briefly spots another aircraft below. When Ditch checks to see if his pilot has noticed it, Chris cuts ties with Ditch and jumps on her own. Ditch spots Chris tumbling uncontrollably below him, and is unable to save her before she hits the ground at [[terminal velocity]]. An investigation ensues, and the school is closed down indefinitely.\n\nFeeling guilty and confused, Ditch rifles through Chris' personal belongings, and finds her apartment key. There he finds a photograph of Chris performing a jump, thus contradicting her earlier claim of inexperience, and Ditch is attacked and chased off by Kerr. At the flight school, Ditch is approached by [[Assistant District Attorney]] Ben Pinkwater, who tells Ditch he may be charged with [[manslaughter]] for Chris' death. Later, Ditch sees the same plane that had been following him during the jump, and follows it to a shack where he finds Chris alive, having faked her own death. She then takes Ditch on an unexplained nighttime jump at an [[Aeronautics|aeronautics plant]], promising to clear his name if he co-operates. Chris has Ditch infiltrate the plant via a [[smokestack]] and disable the security system before stealing a hidden [[optical disc]]. Kerr and his men arrive, forcing Ditch to flee from gunfire back to his school. Wanting his name cleared, he arranges a meeting with Chris and Pinkwater at a [[scrapyard]], but upon arriving Ben kills Chris' partner Lex, revealing himself to be a cohort of Kerr's. A firefight ensues, and Chris and Ditch escape using a makeshift [[rocket car]].\n\nTaking shelter in the desert, Chris reveals that her real name is Krista Moldova, and that she and her pursuers are former [[KGB]] operatives left unemployed due to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. \"Pinkwater\" and his men have fallen in with the [[Russian mob]], and have hijacked a shipment of [[gold bullion]] intended for the [[Moscow]] reserve, and intend to use it to finance a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the democratic Russian government. Using the optical disc retrieved by Ditch, Chris determines the location of the missing [[Boeing 747]] carrying the shipment. She and Ditch get on board and find the gold, but are discovered by Pinkwater's men. The two barely escape, and Ditch decides to quit while Chris heads off to face Pinkwater alone.\n\nAs Ditch is about to leave on a bus, he finds a picture taken by Chris holding up a sign reading \"Ditch Brodie Did Not Kill Me,\" thereby [[Exoneration|exonerating]] him. Having a change of heart, Ditch drives off to the airfield just as Pinkwater and his men take off, having kidnapped Chris. Posing as an FAA agent, Ditch convinces a [[biplane]] stunt pilot to fly him up and onto the 747. Ditch gets on board just as Chris is stuffed in the trunk of Kerr's sports car to be killed. Ditch and Kerr get into a fight, driving the car out of the cargo hold and plummeting toward the ground below. Ditch manages to force Kerr off, and gets Chris out of the trunk before it hits the ground. The two land in a nearby [[wind farm]], and the plane, damaged in the fight, is forced to land. As police swarm the runway, Chris and Ditch are attacked by a parachuting Pinkwater, and Chris is stabbed in the back. Ditch attacks Pinkwater and pulls his back-up chute, sucking him into a nearby [[turbine]] and killing him.\n\nSome time later, Ditch and Chris receive [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Russia|official commendations]] at the [[Kremlin]] for their actions in preventing the coup.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Richard 'Ditch' Brodie\n* [[Nastassja Kinski]] as Agent Krista Moldova / Chris Morrow\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Stefan / Ben Pinkwater\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Kerr\n* [[Gary Bullock]] as Agent Lex\n* Hans Howes as Sam\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Noble\n* [[Margaret Colin]] as Joline\n* Cathryn de Prume as Agent Karen\n* [[Suli McCullough]] as 'Robocam'\n* [[Rance Howard]] as Chuck\n* [[Sofia Shinas]] as Maxine 'Broken Legs Max'\n\n== Production ==\nBased on David Twohy\u2019s original spec script which sold to Hollywood Pictures for over $500,000 <ref name=\"SarafianTerminal\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/sarafian-signed-to-direct-interscope-s-terminal-106147/|title=  Sarafian signed to direct Interscope\u2019s \u2018Terminal\u2019  |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 23, 2021}}</ref> [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]] and [[Tom Cruise]] were initially slated as director and star, but commitments prevented this.<ref name=\"SarafianTerminal\" />\n\nThe final stunt, which features Sheen at the wheel of a [[Cadillac Allant\u00e9]] falling to earth, was a mixture of [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] and camera work, as a real car was suspended beneath a helicopter and then a [[dolly zoom|reverse zoom]] made it seem as if it were in [[free-fall]].\n\nPortions of the film were shot in [[Palm Springs, California]].<ref name=Niemann>{{Cite book\n | last = Niemann\n | first = Greg\n | title = Palm Springs Legends: creation of a desert oasis\n | publisher = [[Sunbelt Publications]]\n | year = 2006\n | location = San Diego\n | pages = 168\u2013171\n | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=RwXQGTuL1M0C&q=palm+springs+film+locations&pg=PA169\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 978-0-932653-74-1\n | mr =\n | jfm =\n|oclc=61211290}}<!-- {{LCC|F869 P18 N45 2006}} {{ASIN|093265374X}}--> ([http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip0516/2005021837.html here for Table of Contents])</ref> Other filming locations were [[Alabama Hills]] ([[Lone Pine, California]]); a [[windfarm]] near [[Tehachapi, California]]; [[Douglas, Arizona]]; [[Flagstaff, Arizona]]; Little [[Colorado River]] Canyon, Arizona; [[Moscow]], Russia; [[Phoenix, Arizona]]; [[San Bernardino, California]] and [[Tucson, Arizona]], where a cameo appearance by Martha Vasquez of its station [[KVOA]] was filmed.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.kvoa.com/news/bios.htm| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/19970221190129/http://www.kvoa.com/news/bios.htm| website= [[KVOA]].com| date= 1997| title= Eyewitness News Team| archive-date= February 21, 1997| access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111400/locations?ref_=tt_en |website= IMDb.com| title= Filming Locations for ''Terminal Velocity''| access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film debuted at No. 2 at the box office behind ''[[Timecop]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Timecop' Puts Brakes On 'Velocity'|work= [[Sun Sentinel]] |date= October 3, 1994 |url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-10-03/lifestyle/9410020211_1_timecop-terminal-velocity-forrest-gump| first= Bob| last= Strauss |agency= [[Los Angeles Daily News]] |access-date=2010-11-02}}</ref> It eventually grossed $16.5 million in the United States and Canada and over $31 million internationally, for a worldwide total of over $47 million compared to its $50 million budget.<ref name= BOMojo>{{cite web| url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminalvelocity.htm| title= Terminal Velocity| website= BoxOfficeMojo.com| publisher= Internet Movie Database |access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 19, 1996|page=1|last=Klady|first=Leonard|title=B.O. with a vengeance: $9.1 billion worldwide}}</ref>\n\nIt received mostly negative reviews by critics; it has a 19% positive scale on the ratings aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 26 reviews.<ref name=RT>{{cite web| url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terminal_velocity/| title= Terminal Velocity (1994)| work= Rotten Tomatoes| access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] opined that \"''Terminal Velocity'' is the kind of movie in which the hero keeps sneaking into rooms to peek into some file and you wait, with glum certitude, for yet another \u201dsurprise\u201d thug to leap out of the shadows. It\u2019s fun to hear Charlie Sheen deliver quips like, 'I\u2019m not just a walking penis \u2014 I\u2019m a flying penis!' But for most of the movie, Sheen, lowering his voice to a basso he-man growl, gives a boringly flat, square-jawed performance, as if he thought he were doing ''Hot Shots! Part Quatre''.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= Terminal Velocity| first= Owen | last= Gleiberman| work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= October 7, 1994 |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303954,00.html| access-date= November 2, 2010}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] suggested that \"Sheen's behavior in this and other scenes is so close to the self-parody of his work in the '[[Hot Shots!]]' movies that he almost seems to be telling us something \u2014 such as, that he takes the movie with less than perfect seriousness. No wonder. It's based on such a goofy premise that with just a nudge here and a pun there it could easily have become 'Hot Shots Part Cinq' and taken advantage of the franchise.
