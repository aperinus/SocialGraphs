It is the second theatrical release in the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' franchise.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=407}}\n\nThe film has two parts: a 20-minute preceding short and the feature presentation. The events of the film take place during the second season of ''[[List of Pok\u00e9mon: Adventures in the Orange Islands episodes|Pok\u00e9mon: Adventures in the Orange Islands]]'', where Ash, Misty and Tracey enter Shamouti Island. While there, they discover the three legendary bird Pok\u00e9mon, [[Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres]]. Meanwhile, a collector named Lawrence III attempts to steal the three Pok\u00e9mon to awaken Lugia, which proves dangerous for the legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Lugia, and Ash himself.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon the Movie 2000'' was released in Japanese theaters on July 17, 1999, by [[Toho]]. The English-language adaptation was released in the United States on July 21, 2000, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] The film earned less at the box office than its predecessor, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie]]'', but was still a financial success and received better (albeit still negative) reviews upon release.\n\n== Plot ==\n=== ''Pikachu's Rescue Adventure'' ===\nAs in [[Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie#Pikachu's Vacation|Pikachu's Vacation]], all of the faces of the main human characters are unseen. When [[Togepi]] wakes up to see a group of Ledyba flying by it yawns and falls back down a hill and falls down a dark hole, [[Pikachu]], [[Bulbasaur]], [[Squirtle]], Marill, Venonat, and [[Psyduck]] give chase and find themselves in a giant tree that once was Pikachu's old home. With help from Pikachu's new friend, [[Elekid]], the Pok\u00e9mon find Togepi but he has been mistaken for an [[Exeggcute]] egg. The Pok\u00e9mon head off into the depths of the tree to find the missing egg, meeting a trio of dancing [[Bellossom]] along the way. A severe storm hits the area and Pikachu and his friends try to protect the Exeggcute eggs from being blown away. The grass Pok\u00e9mon lend a hand and [[Snorlax]] saves everyone with his great strength. The storm fades when a Dragonair appears and calms the storm while a [[Chansey]] appears, revealing she had the missing egg all along. The eggs are reunited. Exeggcute suddenly evolves into [[Exeggutor]] with the assistance of a Leaf Stone. Pikachu and his friends say farewell to Elekid and the others and head back to their trainers. Meanwhile, [[Meowth]] tries to find his way to a campsite but ends up getting caught on Pikachu's mishaps and gives up.\n\n=== ''The Power of One'' ===\nLawrence III, a Pok\u00e9mon collector, strives to make a legendary prophecy occur. His plan to capture the legendary birds [[Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres]] will ultimately lead to the capture of the \"Beast of the Sea\" [[Lugia]]. Lawrence sets out in his flying hovercraft to the heart of the Orange Islands to capture the three legendary birds, referred to as the Titans of Fire, Ice and Lightning. He successfully captures Moltres, but this upsets the balance of power the birds have over the world's climate. Weather across the world begins to go haywire, alerting countless Pok\u00e9mon to the change. [[Ash Ketchum]] and his companions [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]] and [[Tracey Sketchit]] get caught in a freak storm, and are washed ashore on Shamouti, set in the centre of the Orange Islands. Learning that the island festival celebrating the legend is about to begin, Ash is selected as the festival's Chosen One by a girl named Melody, the festival maiden.\n\nAt the festival's banquet, Melody explains to Ash he must retrieve three crystal balls from each of the legendary birds' islands and take them to Shamouti's shrine, guarded by a talking [[Slowking]], where Melody will end his task by playing the festival's song, actually the song of Lugia. Ash immediately sets out, led by the troubled [[Pikachu]]. Taken to Fire Island by sea captain Maren, Ash and Pikachu find Moltres' treasure, but are interrupted by [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]]. Misty, Tracey and Melody arrive via Melody's multi-purpose boat, followed by Zapdos who has come to claim the island. Pikachu and Zapdos communicate with each other with electric shocks, with Meowth serving as the translator. Lawrence appears overhead, attacking and capturing Zapdos as well as Ash and co. accidentally. Meanwhile, [[Professor Oak]], [[List of characters in the Pok\u00e9mon anime series#Professors|Professor Ivy]], and Ash's mother [[Delia Ketchum]] fly to the islands but their helicopter crashes on Shamouti. Having no use for them, Lawrence frees Ash and the others and attempts to capture Articuno, accidentally awakening Lugia in the process. Trying to foil Lawrence's plans, Ash and the others free Moltres and Zapdos who escape and bring down Lawrence's hovercraft.\n\nArticuno, Zapdos, and Moltres engage in all out war, trying to destroy each other. Ash and co. manage to escape, gaining Zapdos' treasure in the process, and are transported back to Shamouti by a mysterious water spout revealed to be Lugia. Lugia at first tries to stop the battle, but is outmatched by the birds' powers combined against it. Telepathically it then explains the birds and the weather can be stopped by the legend's Chosen One, actually Ash in reality. Ash puts the two treasures he has on the shrine, but he is still missing the third one. Ash agrees to go to Articuno's island to get the final treasure, but his progress is halted by the legendary birds. Team Rocket arrive on a speedboat made from a dingy and the helicopter's discarded propeller, wishing to save the world in order to continue their villainy. The group race up to Articuno's shrine and retrieve the treasure, but before they can escape, the legendary birds appear. They destroy the speedboat before Articuno is knocked out by Moltres and Zapdos. Lugia rescues Ash, Pikachu and Team Rocket, but Team Rocket heroically jump into the sea upon realizing they are slowing Lugia down. Lawrence tries to catch Lugia, but Lugia uses its Aeroblast attack to destroy his airship and take out Moltres and Zapdos before collapsing into the sea.\n\nMisty and Tracey rescue Ash and Pikachu, who venture to Shamouti Island's shrine and place the final treasure with the others. Melody plays Lugia's song, ending the storms and bringing peace to the legendary birds. Lugia rises from the sea, bringing the true Beast of the Sea with him, an underwater current that has been altering the climate. Later, after the birds returned to their islands, Lugia departs after thanking Ash. Delia and the professors arrive.  Delia, having witnessed her son's actions, asks him to be more careful which he complies with. Lawrence laments his decisions, deciding to start his collection again. Team Rocket reach the island a day later and are told by Slowking that the [[Breaking the fourth wall|audience]] saw their heroics; the trio contemplates changing their ways but ultimately decide to stay the same when they realize their boss might not like the idea.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of characters in the Pok\u00e9mon anime series{{!}}List of characters in the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime series}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Japanese voice actor\n! rowspan=\"2\" | English voice actor\n|-\n!Japanese name\n!English name\n|-\n|[[Ash Ketchum|Satoshi]]\n|Ash Ketchum\n|[[Rica Matsumoto]]\n|[[Veronica Taylor]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Pikachu]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Ikue \u014ctani]]\n|-\n|Kasumi\n|[[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]]\n|[[Mayumi Iizuka]]\n|[[Rachael Lillis]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Togepi]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[Satomi K\u014drogi]]\n|-\n|Kenji\n|Tracey Sketchit\n|[[Tomokazu Seki]]\n|[[Ted Lewis (voice actor)|Ted Lewis]]\n|-\n|Musashi\n|Jessie\n|[[Megumi Hayashibara]]\n|Rachael Lillis\n|-\n|Kojir\u014d\n|James\n|[[Shin-ichiro Miki]]\n|[[Eric Stuart]]\n|-\n|Nyarth\n|[[Meowth]]\n|[[Inuko Inuyama]]\n|[[Maddie Blaustein]]\n|-\n|Hanako\n|Delia Ketchum\n|Masami Toyoshima\n|Veronica Taylor\n|-\n|Dr. Yukinari \u014ckido\n|Professor Samuel Oak\n|[[Unsh\u014d Ishizuka]]\n|[[Stuart Zagnit]]\n|-\n|Dr. Uchikido\n|Professor Ivy\n|[[Keiko Han]]\n|[[Megan Hollingshead]]\n|-\n|Koduck\n|[[Psyduck]]\n|Rikako Aikawa\n|Michael J.
