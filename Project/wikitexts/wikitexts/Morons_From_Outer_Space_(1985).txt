Sikking]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins on a small spaceship docking with a refuelling station. On board are a group of four aliens called Bernard, Sandra, Desmond, and Julian. During a particularly tedious period of their stay at the station, the other three begin playing with the ship's controls while Bernard is outside playing spaceball. They accidentally disconnect his part of the ship, leaving him stranded while they crash into a large blue planet close by (Earth).\n\nThe aliens become instant celebrities on arrival, despite being able to bring no great revelation or technical ability to the people of Earth (as is central to the plot of many \"aliens on Earth\" films). They find a manager (Jones) and become wealthy more or less overnight, packing fans in auditoriums just to see them. Meanwhile, Bernard arrives on Earth via other means of transport. Despite being by far the most intelligent of the group, Bernard is not afforded any celebrity, and is in fact condemned to vagrancy and a brief stint in a mental hospital before reuniting with his fellow travellers near the end of the film. The others, fearing that the introduction of Bernard would lessen their popularity and celebrity, fail to mention that they had originally been travelling with a fourth.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joanne Pearce]] as Sandra Brock the alien\n* [[Jimmy Nail]] as Desmond Brock the alien\n* [[Paul Bown]] as Julian Tope the alien\n* [[James Sikking]] as Col.

It was part of the initial slate of four films from Thorn EMI's new chairman, [[Verity Lambert]], the others being ''[[Slayground]]'', ''[[Dreamchild]]'' and ''[[Comfort and Joy (1984 film)|Comfort and Joy]]''. It was written by Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones and directed by Mike Hodges.<ref>EMI back with four feature films Fiddick, Peter.

The Observer 24 March 1985: 25</ref>\n\nMike Hodges disliked the film, regarding it as a \"misfire\". He clashed with Smith and Jones in post production, an article claiming \"they did not trust, or perhaps understand his comedic judgement or cinematic visual satire and the film became far more broad than he had intended.\"  However he did enjoy satirising the sentimental \"Spielbergian vision of the world\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/why-i-love-morons-outer-space|website=BFI|title=Why I Love Morons from Outer Space|first=Jon|last=Spira|date=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film performed moderately at the box office in the UK and only earned $17,000 in the US.<ref>These Movies Flopped at the Box Office; Now You Get to See Them on Videotape\nBy Michael Cieply.
