J. Cook|AJ Cook]] and [[Josh Hartnett]]. The film also features [[Scott Glenn]], [[Michael Par\u00e9]] and [[Danny DeVito]] in minor roles, with voice narration by [[Giovanni Ribisi]].\n\n''The Virgin Suicides'' is based on the 1993 best-selling [[The Virgin Suicides|debut novel of the same name]] by the American author [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]. The film follows the lives of five attractive adolescent sisters in an [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] suburb of [[Detroit]] during the mid-1970s. After the youngest sister, Cecilia, makes an initial suicide attempt, all of the girls are put under close scrutiny by their religious, overprotective parents. The girls are eventually withdrawn from school and confined to their home, which leads to their increasingly depressive and isolated behavior. As in the novel, the film is told in [[Grammatical person|first person plural]], from the perspective of a group of adolescent boys in the neighborhood who are fascinated by the girls.{{efn|Like Eugenides' source novel, Coppola's script also frames the narrative through the perspective of the neighborhood boys who look on as the Lisbon girls are cordoned off from the world by their parents. In the film, Giovanni Ribisi provides the voice of an adult Tim Weiner, who relays the events to the audience.<ref name=thomas/>}}\n\nShot in 1998 in [[Toronto]], the film was director Sofia Coppola's debut feature. It features an original score by the French electronic band [[Air (French band)|Air]]. The film premiered at the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]] and received a [[limited release|limited]] theatrical release on April 21, 2000 in the United States, later expanding to a wide release in May 2000. The film was met with largely positive critical reception, with both the performances and Coppola's direction receiving note. It was also praised for its lyrical representation of adolescent angst, visual style, and soundtrack, and is now recognized as a [[Cult film|cult classic]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why The Virgin Suicides Is Still So Resonant Today|website=[[The Atlantic]]|date=26 April 2018|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/04/the-virgin-suicides-criterion-sofia-coppola/558914/}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the film ranked number 39 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''<nowiki/>'s list of the \"50 Best High School Movies\".<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=50 Best High School Movies|url=https://ew.com/gallery/50-best-high-school-movies-0/|access-date=2019-11-02|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film marked the beginning of a working relationship between Coppola and star Kirsten Dunst, whom Coppola would cast as the lead in several films in the following years.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the sleepy suburb of [[Grosse Pointe, Michigan]], a group of neighborhood boys\u2014now grown men\u2014reflect upon their memories of the five Lisbon teenage sisters, ages 13 to 17, in 1975. Unattainable due to their overprotective Catholic parents, math teacher Ronald Lisbon and his homemaker wife Sara, the girls\u2014Therese, Mary, Bonnie, Lux, and Cecilia\u2014are enigmas who fill the boys' conversations and dreams.\n\nDuring the summer, the youngest sister, Cecilia, slits her wrist in a bathtub, though she survives. Her therapist, Dr. Horniker, suggests to her parents that Cecilia's attempt at suicide was a cry for help, rather than genuine, and she would benefit from wider interaction with her peers, particularly boys. Despite this, Mrs. Lisbon is still extremely unwilling to allow her daughters a normal social life. Mr. Lisbon persuades his wife to allow him to throw a chaperoned basement party intended to make Cecilia feel better. The party, however, is tense and miserable. Cecilia excuses herself and successfully ends her life by leaping from her second story bedroom window and [[impaling]] herself onto a spiked iron fencepost below. In the wake of Cecilia's suicide, the Lisbon parents watch over their four remaining daughters even more closely. This further isolates the family from their community and heightens the air of mystery surrounding the girls, particularly to the neighborhood boys.\n\nAt the beginning of the new school year in the fall, Lux, the most rebellious of the sisters, forms a secret and short-lived romance with Trip Fontaine, the school heartthrob. In hopes of becoming closer to Lux, Trip comes over to the Lisbon residence and watches television with the family. Trip persuades Mr. Lisbon to allow him to take Lux to the [[homecoming]] dance by promising to provide dates for Therese, Mary and Bonnie, and going as a group, to which Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon eventually agree to, with Mr. Lisbon chaperoning the dance. After winning homecoming King and Queen, Trip persuades Lux to ditch their group and go for a walk on the football field, where they end up having sex. Afterwards, Lux falls asleep and Trip abandons her. At dawn, Lux wakes up alone and has to take a taxi home, being met by her distraught parents.\n\nDue to Lux breaking curfew, the girls are all punished by a paranoid Mrs. Lisbon by being taken out of school and confined to the house indefinitely. Isolated and increasingly depressed, the sisters contact the boys across the street by using light signals and sharing records over the telephone to express their emotions and share their feelings. During this time, Lux rebels against her parents and becomes overtly promiscuous, having anonymous sexual encounters on the roof of her house late at night with random boys and men; the neighborhood boys spy from across the street. After months of confinement, the sisters begin to leave notes outside for the boys.  The girls eventually send a final note to the boys asking them to come over at midnight, ostensibly to escape from their house.\n\nWhen the boys finally arrive that night, they find Lux alone in the living room, smoking a cigarette. Thinking they're going to help the girls escape, the boys are invited inside by Lux to wait for her sisters, while she goes to start the car. Curious, the boys wander into the basement after hearing a noise and discover Bonnie's body hanging from the ceiling rafters. Horrified, the boys rush back upstairs, only to stumble across the body of Mary in the kitchen who has put her head in the gas oven. The boys then realize that the girls had all killed themselves in an apparent [[suicide pact]] moments earlier: Bonnie hanged herself; Mary put her head in the oven; Therese overdosed on sleeping pills upstairs; and Lux died of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] by leaving the car engine running in the closed garage.\n\nDevastated by the suicides of all their children, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon quietly flee the neighborhood and are never seen again. Mr. Lisbon has a friend clean out the house and sell the family belongings in a yard sale; family photos and other mementos are put out with the trash and collected by the boys. The house is eventually sold to a young couple from the [[Boston]] area.\n\nUnsure of how to react to the events, the adults in the community go about their lives as if nothing traumatic really happened, but the boys cannot stop thinking about the Lisbon sisters and why they killed themselves.  Now adult men themselves, they acknowledge that the mystery of the Lisbon sisters will always be an unsolvable puzzle, and they had always loved the girls.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per closing tombstone stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[James Woods]] as Mr. Lisbon\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Mrs. Lisbon\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Lux Lisbon\n* [[Josh Hartnett]] as Trip Fontaine\n* [[A.
