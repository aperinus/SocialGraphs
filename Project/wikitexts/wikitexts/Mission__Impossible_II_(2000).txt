It is the sequel to ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' (1996) and the second installment in the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible'' film series]]. The film also stars [[Dougray Scott]], [[Thandiwe Newton]], [[Richard Roxburgh]], [[John Polson]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Rade Sherbedgia]], and [[Ving Rhames]]. In ''Mission: Impossible 2'', [[Ethan Hunt]] (Cruise) teams with professional thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Newton) to find and destroy a genetically modified disease held by rogue [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF) agent Sean Ambrose (Scott), who is Hall's former lover.\n\n''Mission: Impossible 2'' was theatrically released in the United States by [[Paramount Pictures]] on May 24, 2000, and grossed $546 million worldwide, becoming the [[2000 in film#Highest grossing films|highest-grossing film of that year]]. Initial reaction from critics was mixed to positive, with praise for the action sequences and Woo's direction but some criticism for the characterization. The sequel, ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]'', was released in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nBio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich sends a message to the [[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]] for [[Ethan Hunt]], an old friend of his. He warns that his employer at Biocyte Pharmaceuticals forced him to develop a biological weapon to profit from the cure. He arranges to meet with Ethan to deliver the [[Chimera (virus)|Chimera]] virus, and its remedy, [[Bellerophon]]. With Ethan on holiday, the IMF sends agent Sean Ambrose disguised as Ethan to meet Nekhorvich on a passenger plane. Ambrose goes rogue, killing Nekhorvich and stealing Bellerophon, destroying the aircraft to cover their escape.\n\nIMF director Swanbeck informs Hunt of the circumstances of Nekhorvich's death, and they determine Ambrose is responsible. Swanbeck tasks Ethan with recovering the virus and its cure and has him recruit Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in [[Seville]], [[Spain]]\u2014and Ambrose's ex-girlfriend. Hunt successfully recruits her to trace Ambrose and his team, and to spy on Ambrose, despite her reluctance.\n\nHunt assembles his team, computer hacker [[Luther Stickell]] and Pilot Billy Baird, in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], where Biocyte laboratories are located, and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah rekindles her former relationship with Ambrose and relays information to Ethan's team. Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy, and shows him a video of Chimera infecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues before blackmailing McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals the camera's memory card and delivers it to Ethan. They learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's red blood cells. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. When Nyah discreetly returns the memory card to Ambrose, he notices it is in the wrong pocket of his jacket.\n\nHunt's team kidnaps McCloy to sting him for information. They discover that the only Bellerophon samples were taken by Nekhorvich and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure but does not have the virus; unbeknownst to him at the time, Nekhorvich injected himself with Chimera to smuggle it out of Biocyte. Ambrose plans to exchange a sample of Bellerophon to McCloy for the Chimera. Hunt's team breaks into Biocyte to destroy the virus before the exchange can take place. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing the plan, then captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan can destroy all but one sample of Chimera before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues, culminating in the sample being dropped on the floor between Ambrose and Ethan. Ambrose commands Nyah to collect the specimen; however, she injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from eliminating her after the retrieval. Nyah begs Ethan to kill her along with the virus, but Ethan refuses. Ambrose abducts Nyah as Ethan flees the facility.\n\nAmbrose releases Nyah to wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a pandemic. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options to make him Biocyte's majority shareholder. He plans to get rich from Biocyte's stock due to demand for Bellerophon after Chimera is released. Hunt infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Hunt is pursued by Ambrose's men, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliffside, intent on killing herself to prevent the eventual outbreak. Ethan kills Ambrose's men, but the last man, Hugh Stamp (Ambrose's best friend) is accidentally shot by Ambrose himself. Ambrose chases Hunt to a beach, where Hunt defeats him in a brutal fistfight. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan at the beach. As Ethan is about to give Luther the Bellerophon canister, Ambrose recovers and points a gun at Hunt. Hunt throws the canister to Luther and jumps away from Ambrose's shot while kicking up a pistol from the sand he uses to finally kill Ambrose. Luther injects Nyah with the Bellerophon in time to save her.\n\nDirector Swanbeck realizes that Hunt destroyed the virus but the IMF clears Nyah's criminal record, and Ethan starts his vacation with her in Sydney.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- opening title card billing -->\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Ethan Hunt]], an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF)\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Sean Ambrose, a rogue IMF agent who possesses Bellerophon\n* [[Thandiwe Newton]] (credited as Thandie Newton) as Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief brought on to assist Ethan in tracing Ambrose\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as Hugh Stamp, Ambrose's right-hand man.\n* [[John Polson]] as Billy Baird, a helicopter pilot\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as John C.
