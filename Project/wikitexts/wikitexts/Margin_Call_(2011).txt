C. Chandor]] in his feature directorial debut. The principal story takes place over a 24-hour period at a large [[Wall Street]] [[Investment banking|investment bank]] during the initial stages of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=canvas/><ref name=\"Dash\"/><ref>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Fleming|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|title=''Margin Call'' Director J.C.

The film stars an ensemble cast consisting of [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Zachary Quinto]], [[Penn Badgley]], [[Simon Baker]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Demi Moore]], and [[Stanley Tucci]].\n\nThe film was produced by the production companies [[Myriad Pictures]], [[Benaroya Pictures]] and [[Before the Door Pictures]] (first to sign on, and owned by [[Zachary Quinto]]). Theatrically, it was commercially distributed by [[Lionsgate]] and [[Roadside Attractions]]. The director and screenwriter, J. C. Chandor, is himself the son of an investment banker; the screenplay was partially informed by Chandor's own foray into real estate investments in New York City shortly before the financial crash.<ref name=canvas>{{cite web |last1=de Melker |first1=Saskia | last2=Brown     | first2=Jeffrey      |last3=Chandor |   first3=J.

Following its wide release in theaters, the film garnered award nominations from the [[Detroit Film Critics Society]], along with several separate nominations for its screenplay and direction from recognized award organizations, including a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. The score was composed by musician Nathan Larson.\n\nThe film made its premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 25, 2011, and opened in theaters nationwide in the United States on October 21, 2011. Though it grossed just $5.4 million in domestic ticket sales from 199 theaters, the film had a ground-breaking [[Simultaneous release|day-and-date release]] that earned more than $10 million in video-on-demand sales. The [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] editions of the film were released in the United States on December 20, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2008, an unnamed [[investment bank]] begins laying off a large number of employees. Among those affected is Eric Dale, head of [[risk management]]. Dale's attempts to speak about the implications of a [[Financial risk modeling|model]] he is working on are ignored. On his way out, he gives a flash drive containing his work to Peter Sullivan, an associate in his department, warning him to \"be careful.\" Sullivan, intrigued, works after hours to complete Dale's model.\n\nSullivan discovers that the assumptions underpinning the firm's present risk profile are wrong; historical [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] levels in [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] are being exceeded, which means that the firm's [[position (finance)|position]] in those assets is [[Leverage (finance)|over-leveraged]] and the debt incurred from those over-leveraged assets will bankrupt the company. Sullivan calls his colleague, Seth Bregman, to return to work with the head of credit trading, Will Emerson. Emerson in turn summons Sam Rogers, his boss, after reviewing Sullivan's findings. Attempts by the four to contact Dale end unsuccessfully due to his company phone having been shut off. Peter and Seth go out to find Eric, while Sam and Will inform the company's senior management of the situation.\n\nA subsequent meeting of division head Jared Cohen, chief risk management officer Sarah Robertson, and other senior executives concludes that Sullivan's findings are accurate, and firm CEO John Tuld is called. Upon Tuld's arrival, and after Sullivan explains the problem, Rogers, Cohen, and Tuld spar regarding a course of action. Cohen's plan, favored by Tuld, is a [[fire sale]] of the problematic assets. Rogers disagrees, pointing out that the sale will damage the firm's relationships and reputation within the industry and will cause major instability in the markets. Tuld stresses that his desire to avoid the firm's bankruptcy is worth that risk and the cost.\n\nAfter the meeting with Tuld, Emerson is informed by Dale's wife that he has returned home. Emerson travels to Dale's residence with Bregman and attempts to persuade him to return to the firm, but is unsuccessful. During the drive back, Bregman asks if he will lose his job; Emerson responds that he likely will, but, philosophizing on the nature of the financial markets, tells him not to lose faith, and that his work is necessary.\n\nTuld selects Robertson to act as the scapegoat for the firm's over-leveraged position and demands that she resign after the fire sale. Robertson argues that she warned Tuld and Cohen about the situation over a year ago, but fails to persuade him. Meanwhile, Eric Dale is bribed and forced into cooperating with Cohen's plan, with the firm threatening to cut his benefits and severance if he refuses. He spends the day commiserating with Robertson.\n\nDespite his misgivings, Rogers rallies his traders and informs them of the fire sale. He acknowledges the damage likely to be done to their reputations and careers, but informs them that they will be well compensated if most of the traders' assigned assets are sold by day's end. As trading progresses, the firm elicits suspicion and eventually anger from their [[Counterparty|counterparties]], and incurs heavy losses, but they are able to sell off most of the bad assets.\n\nAs another round of layoffs occurs, Rogers confronts Tuld and submits his resignation. Tuld dismisses Rogers' view of the situation by recalling past [[Economic bubble|economic crises]], arguing that such events always happen and that Rogers should not feel guilty for acting in his and the firm's interests. Tuld asks Rogers to stay on for two more years and Rogers reluctantly accepts, citing personal financial needs. Tuld also informs Rogers that Sullivan is going to be promoted.\n\nThe film ends with Rogers burying his euthanized dog in his ex-wife's front yard during the night. She informs him that their son's firm also sustained heavy losses but avoided bankruptcy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Sam Rogers\n* [[Zachary Quinto]] as Peter Sullivan\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as John Tuld\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Will Emerson\n* [[Simon Baker]] as Jared Cohen\n* [[Penn Badgley]] as Seth Bregman\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Sarah Robertson\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Eric Dale\n* [[Aasif Mandvi]] as Ramesh Shah\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] as Mary Rogers\n* [[Ashley Williams (actress)|Ashley Williams]] as Heather Burke\n* [[Susan Blackwell]] as Lauren Bratberg\n* [[Al Sapienza]] as Louis Carmelo\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June&nbsp;21, 2010, in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"Dash\">{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Dash |title=Citi Goes Hollywood for Spacey and Crew |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 22, 2010 |url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/citi-goes-hollywood-for-spacey-and-crew/ |access-date=June 27, 2010 |archive-date=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829133105/http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/citi-goes-hollywood-for-spacey-and-crew/ |url-status=live }}</ref> More than 80% of the action was shot on the 42nd floor of [[One Penn Plaza]], which had recently been vacated by a trading firm.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Benjamin |url=https://nymag.com/movies/features/zachary-quinto-2011-10 |title=What's Up, Spock?: He might be a famous Vulcan, but Zachary Quinto has no problem being fully human |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=October 16, 2011 |access-date=April 17, 2020 |archive-date=May 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200514163439/https://nymag.com/movies/features/zachary-quinto-2011-10/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Chesto |url=http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/massmarkets/2011/10/22/director-of-margin-call-didnt-need-a-big-budget-to-concisely-depict-wall-streets-mortgage-meltdown/ |title=Director of \"Margin Call\" didn't need a big budget to depict Wall Street's mortgage meltdown |work=WickedLocal.com |access-date=November 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025235930/http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/massmarkets/2011/10/22/director-of-margin-call-didnt-need-a-big-budget-to-concisely-depict-wall-streets-mortgage-meltdown/ |archive-date=October 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in [[Park City, Utah]].

It is also a [[horror movie]], with disaster lurking like an unseen demon outside the skyscraper windows and behind the computer screens. It is also a [[Sitcom|workplace comedy]] of sorts. The crackling, syncopated dialogue and the plot, full of reversals and double crosses, owe an obvious debt to [[David Mamet]]\u2019s profane fables of deal-making [[machismo]]. Hovering over all of it is the dark romance of capital: the elegance of numbers; the kinkiness of [[money]]; the deep, rotten, erotic allure of power.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n\nAlthough the film does not depict any real Wall Street firm, and the fictional firm is never named, the plot has similarities to some events during the 2008 financial crisis: [[Goldman Sachs]] similarly moved early to hedge and reduce its position in mortgage-backed securities, at the urging of two employees,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2010/12/10/433571/goldmans-uneasy-subprime-short/ |title=Goldman's uneasy subprime short |first=Tracey |last=Alloway |work=[[The Financial Times]] |url-access=subscription |date=December 10, 2010 |access-date=May 24, 2015 |archive-date=May 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521000957/http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2010/12/10/433571/goldmans-uneasy-subprime-short/ |url-status=live }}</ref> which essentially mirrors Tuld's comment about the advantage of moving first.
