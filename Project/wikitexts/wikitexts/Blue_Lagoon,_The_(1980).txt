The film stars [[Brooke Shields]] and [[Christopher Atkins]]. The music score was composed by [[Basil Poledouris]] and the cinematography was by [[N\u00e9stor Almendros]].\n\nThe film tells the story of two young children marooned on a [[desert island|tropical island paradise]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. But, without either the guidance or the restrictions of society, emotional and physical changes arise as they reach [[puberty]] and fall in love.\n\n''The Blue Lagoon'' was theatrically released on June 20, 1980, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film was panned by the critics, who disparaged its screenplay, execution, and Shields' performance; however, Almendros' cinematography received praise. In spite of the criticism, the film was a commercial success, grossing over $58 million on a $4.5 million budget and becoming the [[1980 in film|ninth-highest-grossing film of 1980 in North America]]. The film was nominated for the [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]], Almendros received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]], and Atkins was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actor]]. Shields won the inaugural [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]] for her work in the film.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn the late [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], two cousins, nine-year-old Richard and seven-year-old Emmeline Lestrange, and galley cook Paddy Button, are shipwrecked on a lush tropical island in the South Pacific. Paddy cares for the children and forbids them \"by law\" from going to the other side of the island, where he had found an altar with bloody remains from [[human sacrifice]]s. He also warns them against eating the deadly scarlet berries. He dies after a drunken [[Binge drinking|binge]] and the children rebuild their home on a different part of the island.\n\nAt puberty, Emmeline is uncomfortable with her sexual attraction to Richard and declines to share her \"funny\" thoughts with him. She is frightened by her first menstrual period and refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a wound.\n\nEventually, Richard recognizes his own attraction to Emmeline. She ventures to the forbidden side of the island and sees the altar. Associating the blood with Christ's crucifixion, she concludes that the altar is God, and tries to persuade Richard to go to the other side of the island to pray with her. Richard is shocked at the idea of breaking the law, and they argue. When Richard tries to initiate sexual contact she rebuffs him; he hides and masturbates.\n\nWhen a ship appears for the first time in years, Emmeline does not light the signal fire, and asserts to Richard's angry disbelief that the island is their home now. She says she knows about Richard's masturbation and threatens to tell her Uncle Arthur about it. They fight and Richard kicks Emmeline out of their shelter.\n\nEmmeline steps on a venomous [[stonefish]]. Weak from the poison, she pleads with Richard to \"take [her] to God\". Richard carries her across the island and places her on the altar. Emmeline recovers and they swim naked in the lagoon. Noticing their bodies' reactions, they discover sexual intercourse and become lovers. Neither  recognize the fact when Emmeline becomes pregnant, and are stunned to feel the baby move inside her abdomen, assuming her stomach is causing the movements.\n\nMonths later, Richard observes indigenous people performing a human sacrifice in front of the statue. He runs in fear to Emmeline, whom he finds in labor. They name their baby boy Paddy.\n\nA ship led by Richard's father, Arthur, approaches the island and sees the family playing on the shore. Content with their lives, Richard and Emmeline walk away instead of signaling for help. Arthur assumes the mud-covered couple are not Richard and Emmeline.\n\nVisiting their original homesite, Richard searches for bananas while Paddy, unnoticed, brings a branch of the scarlet berries into the boat with Emmeline. Paddy tosses an oar out of the boat as it drifts from the shore. Richard swims after them followed closely by a shark. Emmeline throws the other oar at the shark, striking it and giving Richard time to get into the boat. The boat drifts oarless out to sea.\n\nAfter drifting for days, Richard and Emmeline awake to find Paddy eating the scarlet berries. Hopeless, Richard and Emmeline eat the berries as well, and lie down to await death. Some hours later, Arthur's ship finds them. Arthur asks, \"Are they dead?\" The officer assures him, \"No, sir. They're asleep\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Brooke Shields]] as Emmeline Lestrange\n** Elva Josephson as Young Emmeline\n* [[Christopher Atkins]] as Richard Lestrange\n** Glenn Kohan as Young Richard\n* Bradley Pryce as Little Paddy Lestrange\n** Chad Timmermans as Infant Paddy\n* [[Leo McKern]] as Paddy Button\n* [[William Daniels]] as Arthur Lestrange\n* [[Alan Hopgood]] as Captain\n* [[Gus Mercurio]] as Officer\n\n===Casting===\n\n[[Brooke Shields]] was cast as Emmeline Lestrange based on her performance in ''[[Pretty Baby (1978 film)|Pretty Baby]]''.
