Adapted from the 1843 novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], it stars [[Michael Caine]] as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], alongside Muppet performers [[Dave Goelz]], [[Steve Whitmire]], [[Jerry Nelson]], and [[Frank Oz]]. Although artistic license is taken to suit the aesthetic of the Muppets, ''The Muppet Christmas Carol'' otherwise follows Dickens's original story closely.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rainer|first=Peter|date=1992-12-11|title=The Muppets Take On Dickens' 'Carol'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-12-11-ca-1527-story.html|url-status=live|access-date=2018-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201122143322/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-12-11-ca-1527-story.html|archive-date=November 22, 2020}}</ref> It is the fourth theatrical film in [[The Muppets (franchise)|''The Muppets'' franchise]], and the first to be produced following the deaths of the Muppets creator [[Jim Henson]] and the performer [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]; the film is dedicated to both.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 11, 1992, by [[Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]]. It was a modest box office success and received mostly positive reviews. It is the first Muppets film to be produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], whose [[The Walt Disney Company|parent company]] would later acquire the Muppets franchise in 2004.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], in nineteenth century [[London]], [[Charles Dickens]] (played by [[Gonzo (Muppet)|The Great Gonzo]]) and his friend [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] [[Fourth wall|addresses the audience]] as [[Narration|narrator]]s. [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] ([[Michael Caine]]), a cold-hearted, stingy, grumpy and selfish moneylender, does not share the merriment of Christmas. He rejects his nephew Fred's invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen (played by [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]] and [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]]) collecting money for charity, and tosses a wreath at a carol-singing [[List of Muppets|Bean Bunny]]. His loyal employee [[Bob Cratchit]] (played by [[Kermit the Frog]]) and the other bookkeepers request to take Christmas Day off, since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees. Scrooge leaves for home while the bookkeepers celebrate Christmas.\n\nIn his house, Scrooge encounters the shackled ghosts of his late business partners, [[Jacob Marley|Jacob and Robert Marley]] (played by [[Statler and Waldorf]]), who warn him to repent his wicked ways or be condemned to suffer in the afterlife as they do. They inform him that three spirits will visit him during the night.\n\nAt one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the childlike [[Ghost of Christmas Past]], who takes him back in time to his childhood and early adult life, with Dickens and Rizzo hitching a ride too. They visit his lonely school days and then his time as an employee under Fozziwig ([[Mr. Fezziwig]] in the original story, played by [[Fozzie Bear]]), who owned a [[rubber chicken]] factory. Fozziwig and his mother throw a Christmas party, where Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle, with whom he falls in love. However, the Ghost shows Scrooge how Belle left him after he chose money over her. A tearful Scrooge dismisses the Ghost as he returns to his bedroom.\n\nAt two o'clock, Scrooge meets the gigantic, merry [[Ghost of Christmas Present]], who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Fred's house, where Scrooge is made fun of for his stinginess and general ill will toward all. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Bob Cratchit's house, learning his family (Mrs. Cratchit is played by [[Miss Piggy]]) is content with their small dinner. Scrooge also takes pity on Bob's ill son [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]] (played by [[List of Muppets#Robin the Frog|Robin the Frog]]). The Ghost of Christmas Present abruptly ages, commenting that Tiny Tim will likely die before next Christmas. Scrooge and the Ghost go to a cemetery, where the latter fades away.\n\nThe [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] appears to Scrooge, as a tall, silent, cloaked figure, and takes Scrooge into the future.  Scrooge and the Ghost witness a group of businessmen discussing the death of an unnamed colleague, saying they would only attend the funeral if lunch was provided. In a den, Scrooge sees a [[charwoman]], a [[Washerwoman|laundress]], and the local [[Funeral director|undertaker]] trading several stolen possessions of the deceased to a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] named Old Joe. The Ghost then transports Scrooge to Bob's house, revealing Tiny Tim has died and the Crachits are mourning him. Scrooge is escorted back to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out the wretched man\u2019s neglected grave, revealing Scrooge as the man who died. Overcome with emotion, Scrooge tearfully vows to change his ways and embraces the ghost\u2019s robes before finding himself back in his bedroom.\n\nDiscovering it is Christmas Day, Scrooge decides to surprise Bob's family with a turkey dinner and ventures out with Bean, Dickens, Rizzo, and the charity workers to spread happiness and joy around London, reconciling with Fred and Fozziwig. Scrooge goes to the Cratchit house, at first putting on a cold demeanor before revealing he intends to raise Bob's salary and pay off his mortgage. Scrooge, the Cratchits, Fred and the neighborhood celebrate Christmas, as Dickens narrates how Scrooge became a second father to Tiny Tim, who escaped death.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caine]] as [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]\n* [[Steven Mackintosh]] as Fred, Ebenezer Scrooge's nephew.\n* [[Meredith Braun]] as Belle, Scrooge's former love interest.\n* [[Robin Weaver]] as Clara, Ebenezer Scrooge's niece-in-law and Fred's wife.\n* [[Jessica Fox (actress)|Jessica Fox]] as [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] (voice)\n* David Shaw Parker as Old Joe (voice)\n* Edward Sanders, Theo Sanders, Kristopher Milnes, Russell Martin, and [[Ray Coulthard]] as Young Scrooge\n\n===Muppet performers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Performer\n! scope=\"col\"| [[The Muppets|Muppet]] character\n! scope=\"col\"| ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' character\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | [[Dave Goelz]]\n|| [[Gonzo (Muppet)|The Great Gonzo]] \n| [[Charles Dickens]] (Narrator)\n|-\n|| [[Statler and Waldorf|Waldorf]]\n| Robert Marley\n|-\n|| [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]]\n| Charity collector\n|-\n|| Original\n| Betina Cratchit\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | [[Steve Whitmire]]\n|| [[Kermit the Frog]]\n| [[Bob Cratchit]]\n|-\n|| [[Rizzo the Rat]]\n| Co-narrator\n|-\n|| [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]]\n| Charity collector\n|-\n|| [[List of Muppets#Bean Bunny|Bean Bunny]]\n| Boy\n|-\n|| Original\n| Belinda Cratchit\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | [[Frank Oz]]\n|| [[Miss Piggy]] \n| Emily Cratchit\n|-\n|| [[Fozzie Bear]]\n| [[Mr. Fezziwig|Fozziwig]]\n|-\n|| [[Sam Eagle]]\n| Schoolmaster\n|-\n|| [[List of Muppets#George the Janitor|George the Janitor]]\n| Himself\n|-\n|| [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]]\n| Fozziwig party entertainer\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | [[Jerry Nelson]]\n|| [[List of Muppets#Robin the Frog|Robin the Frog]]\n| [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim Cratchit]]\n|-\n|| [[List of Muppets#Lew Zealand|Lew Zealand]]\n| Himself\n|-\n|| [[Statler and Waldorf|Statler]]\n| [[Jacob Marley]]\n|-\n|| Ma Bear\n| Ma Fozziwig\n|-\n|| Original\n| [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] (face and voice performance)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | [[David Rudman]]\n|| Peter Frog (original)\n| Peter Cratchit\n|-\n|| Original\n| Old Joe (puppeteer only)\n|-\n|| [[Swedish Chef|The Swedish Chef]]\n| Fozziwig party cook\n|-\n|| [[Louise Gold]]\n|| Original\n| Mrs Dilber\n|-\n|| [[Karen Prell]]\n|| Original\n| [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] (puppeteer only)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Robert Tygner\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Originals\n| [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] (puppeteer only)\n|-\n| [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] (puppeteer only)\n|-\n|| [[William Todd-Jones]]\n|| Original\n| [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] (puppeteer only)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Don Austen]] \n| rowspan=\"2\" | Originals\n| [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] (in-suit performer)\n|-\n| [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] (in-suit performer)\n|}\n\n==Production==\nFollowing [[Jim Henson]]'s death in May 1990, the [[talent agent]] Bill Haber approached Henson's son [[Brian Henson|Brian]] with the idea of filming an adaptation.
