Produced by [[Peter Douglas]] and [[Lloyd Kaufman]] (founder of [[Troma Entertainment]]) and directed by [[Don Taylor (American actor and director)|Don Taylor]], the film contains an [[ensemble cast]] starring [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[James Farentino]], [[Katharine Ross]] and [[Charles Durning]].\n\nThis was the final film by Don Taylor.  Kaufman also served as an associate producer and had a minor acting role.\n\nThe film was produced with the cooperation of the [[United States Navy]]'s [[naval aviation]] branch and the [[United States Department of Defense]]. It was set and filmed on board {{USS|Nimitz}} (CVN-68), filming operations of the modern nuclear warship, which had been launched in the early 1970s. ''The Final Countdown'' was a moderate success at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1980, the aircraft carrier {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|6}} is departing [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor]] for naval exercises in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The ship takes on a civilian observer, Warren Lasky (Martin Sheen) \u2014 a systems analyst for Tideman Industries working as an efficiency expert for the U.S. Defense Department \u2014 on the orders of his reclusive employer, Mr Tideman, whose secretive major defense contractor company designed and built the nuclear-powered warship.\n\nOnce at sea, the ''Nimitz'' encounters a mysterious electrically charged storm-like [[wormhole|vortex]]. While the ship passes through it, radar and other equipment become unresponsive and everyone aboard falls into agony. Initially unsure of what has happened to them and having lost radio contact with [[United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet Command]] at Pearl Harbor, Captain Yelland (Kirk Douglas), commander of the aircraft carrier, fears that there may have been a nuclear strike on Hawaii or the continental United States. He orders [[general quarters]] and launches a [[Vought F-8 Crusader|RF-8 Crusader]] reconnaissance aircraft. The aircraft returns after photographing Pearl Harbor, but the images show [[Battleship Row|an intact row]] of U.S. Pacific fleet battleships,{{#tag:ref|During December 1941, the U.S. Navy Pacific fleet was based at Pearl Harbor and consisted mainly of large battleships moored at harbor and smaller/middle-sized naval vessels. Two of the large crucial aircraft carriers normally at Pearl Harbor were at sea on a brief mission.<ref>Toland 1991, p. 5.</ref>|group= Note}} of which several were destroyed during the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941.\n\nWhen a surface contact is spotted on radar, Yelland launches two ready alert [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] fighter jets from [[VF-84 (1955\u201395)|VF-84]] to intercept. The patrol witnesses a civilian wooden yacht being strafed and destroyed by two Imperial Japanese Navy [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M \"Zero\"]] fighters, killing three crew members. The F-14s are ordered to drive off the Zeros without firing, but when the Zeros inadvertently head towards the ''Nimitz'', Yelland gives clearance to shoot them down. The ''Nimitz'' rescues survivors from the yacht: prominent [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] Samuel Chapman (Charles Durning), his aide Laurel Scott (Katharine Ross), her dog Charlie and one of the two downed Zero pilots (Soon-Tek Oh). Commander Owens (James Farentino), an amateur historian, recognizes Chapman as a politician who could have been [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s running mate (and his potential successor) during [[1944 United States presidential election|his final re-election bid]], had Chapman not disappeared shortly before the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nWhen a [[Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] scouting craft discovers the [[1st Air Fleet|Japanese fleet]] task force further north in unpatrolled waters, poised to launch its attack on Pearl Harbor, the ''Nimitz'' crew realize that they have been transported back in time to the day before the attack. Yelland has to decide whether to destroy the Japanese fleet and alter the course of history or to stand by and allow history to proceed as they know it. The American civilians and the Zero pilot are kept isolated, but while being questioned, the Japanese pilot obtains a rifle, kills two Marine guards, and takes Scott, Owens, and Lasky hostage. He threatens to kill them unless he is given access to a radio to warn the Japanese fleet about the ''Nimitz''. Lasky tells Commander Owens to recite and describe the secret plans for the Japanese attack; the dumbfounded Japanese pilot is overcome and shot by the Marines. In the aftermath, Scott and Owens develop an attraction for each other.\n\nChapman is outraged that Yelland knows of the impending Japanese attack but has not told anyone else, and demands to be taken to Pearl Harbor to warn the naval authorities. Yelland instead orders Owens to fly the civilians and sufficient supplies via helicopter to an isolated Hawaiian island, assuming they will eventually be rescued. When they arrive, Chapman realizes he has been tricked and uses a flare gun to force the pilot to fly to Pearl Harbor. During a struggle with another crew member, the flare gun discharges, destroying the craft and stranding Scott and Owens on the island. The ''Nimitz'' launches a massive strike force against the incoming Japanese fleet, but right after that, the time vortex storm returns. After a futile attempt to outrun the storm, Yelland recalls the strike force, and the ship and its aircraft safely return to 1980, leaving the past relatively unchanged. Upon the return of the ''Nimitz'' to Pearl Harbor, Pacific Fleet admirals board the ship to investigate the ''Nimitz''{{'}}s unexplained disappearance. Lasky leaves the ship with Scott's dog, Charlie, and encounters the mysterious Mr. Tideman face-to-face. Tideman is revealed to be a much older Owens. He and his wife, Laurel Scott, invite Lasky to join them as they have \"a lot to talk about\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Kirk Douglas in front of USS Nimitz (CVN-68) 1979.jpg|thumb|Kirk Douglas as Capt.
