Brooks]], who co-wrote it with [[Mark Andrus]]. The film stars [[Jack Nicholson]] as a [[misanthropy|misanthropic]], [[Prejudice|bigoted]], and [[Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|obsessive\u2013compulsive]] novelist, [[Helen Hunt]] as a single mother with a chronically ill son, and [[Greg Kinnear]] as an artist who is gay. The film premiered in [[Regency Village Theatre]] on December 6, 1997, and was released in theaters on December 25, 1997, and was a box office hit, grossing $314.1 million on a $50 million budget.\n\nNicholson and Hunt won the [[70th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], respectively, making ''As Good as It Gets'' the most recent film to win both of the lead acting awards, and the first since 1991's ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''. It was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] but ultimately lost to ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. It is ranked 140th on ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\" list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/500/71.asp |title=Empire Features |work=Empire |access-date=October 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Misanthropy|Misanthropic]] [[New York City]] best-selling [[romance novel]]ist Melvin Udall has [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]; he uses soap bars to wash his hands only once, dislikes touching pets, avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city, and eats his breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant. He takes an interest in his [[Waiting staff|waitress]], Carol Connelly, the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his uncouth behavior.\n\nOne day, Melvin's apartment neighbor, [[Homosexuality|gay]] artist Simon Bishop, is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery. Simon's agent, Frank Sachs, intimidates Melvin into caring for Simon's [[Griffon Bruxellois]], Verdell, while he is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it, simultaneously receiving more attention from Carol. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog. Melvin's life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in [[Brooklyn]] so she can care for her acutely [[asthma]]tic son Spencer. Unable to adjust to a different waitress, Melvin arranges through his publisher (whose husband is a doctor) to pay for her son's considerable medical expenses as long as Carol agrees to return to work. She is overwhelmed but doubts his generosity.\n\nMeanwhile, Simon's assault and rehabilitation, coupled with Verdell's preference for Melvin, causes Simon to lose his creative muse and fall into a depression. With no medical insurance, he is approaching bankruptcy due to his medical bills. Frank persuades him to go to [[Baltimore]] to ask his estranged parents for money. Because Frank is too busy to take the injured Simon to Baltimore himself, Melvin reluctantly agrees to do so; Frank lends Melvin the use of his [[Saab 900#Variants|Saab 900 convertible]] for the trip. Melvin invites Carol to accompany them on the trip to lessen the awkwardness. She reluctantly accepts, and relationships among the three develop.\n\nOnce in Baltimore, Carol persuades Melvin to take her out for dinner. Melvin's comments during the dinner greatly flatter\u2014and subsequently upset\u2014Carol, and she abruptly leaves. Upon seeing her, frustrated, Simon begins to sketch her, semi-nude, in his hotel room, which rekindles his creativity, and he once more feels a desire to paint. He briefly reconnects with his mother, but is able to tell her that he will be fine.\n\nAfter returning to New York, Carol tells Melvin that she does not want him in her life anymore, but later regrets her statement and calls to apologize. The relationship between Melvin and Carol remains complicated, until Simon (whom Melvin has allowed to move in with him, as his apartment has been sublet) persuades Melvin to declare his love for her. Melvin goes to see Carol, who hesitantly agrees to try and establish a relationship with him. The film ends with Melvin and Carol walking together. As he opens the door at an early morning pastry shop for Carol, he realizes that he has stepped on a crack in the pavement, but does not seem to mind.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Melvin Udall\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Carol Connelly\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Simon Bishop\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Frank Sachs\n* [[Skeet Ulrich]] as Vincent Lopiano\n* [[Shirley Knight]] as Beverly Connelly\n* [[Jesse James (actor)|Jesse James]] as Spencer \"Spence\" Connelly\n* [[Yeardley Smith]] as Jackie Simpson\n* [[Lupe Ontiveros]] as Nora Manning\n* [[Bibi Osterwald]] as Neighbor Woman\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Dr. Martin Bettes\n* [[Lawrence Kasdan]] as Dr. Green\n* [[Julie Benz]] as Receptionist\n* [[Shane Black]] as Brian, Cafe 24 manager\n* [[Leslie Stefanson]] as Cafe 24 Waitress\n* [[Tom McGowan]] as Maitre D'\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Handyman\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as Street Hustler\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Cafe 24 Waitress\n* [[Wood Harris]] as Cafe 24 Busboy\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Policewoman\n* [[Todd Solondz]] as Man on Bus\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 1996, [[James L.
