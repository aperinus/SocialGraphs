Arriving at a crime scene the next day, they find the woman, who has become infected and murdered her family. Later in the day, Jong-goo meets a mysterious young woman called Moo-myeong (\u201cno name\u201d in [[Korean language|Korean]]), who tells him that the Japanese man is the culprit, and that he is actually an [[evil spirit]]. Jong-goo steps away to call Oh Seong-bok, but when he returns, Moo-myeong has vanished. A demonic figure with glowing red eyes ambushes him, and he awakens in his bed.\n\nA local hunter tells Jong-goo and Oh Seong-bok that he saw the stranger, with glowing red eyes, eating from a deer carcass in the forest. As he continues to experience disturbing dreams about the demonic figure, Jong-goo decides to question the stranger. He enlists the help of Oh Seong-bok and his nephew, a Japanese-speaking [[deacon]] named Yang I-sam (\u201ctwo-three\u201d in Korean). Following the hunter's directions, they investigate the stranger's house in the middle of the forest, discovering a shrine containing dozens of photographs of murdered villagers, as well as some of their belongings. The stranger's [[Cane Corso|guard dog]] attacks them before the stranger returns and placates it. On the way home, Oh Seong-bok shows Jong-goo a shoe that belongs to Jong-goo's daughter, Hyo-jin. Hyo-jin becomes sick, displaying symptoms similar to the other infected. Jong-goo returns to the stranger's house, but learns that the evidence has been burned. Infuriated, he smashes up the worship room, kills the guard dog, and orders the stranger to leave the village.\n\nJong-goo's family discovers the bloody body of a dead goat hanging in front of their gate the next day. Jong-goo experiences partial paralysis, and his wife and mother-in-law take him to see an acupuncturist, leaving Hyo-jin with a neighbor. They return home to find that Hyo-jin has stabbed her to death.\n\nDistraught about Hyo-jin's health and violent behavior, Jong-goo's mother-in-law seeks help from a [[Mu (shaman)|shaman]], Il-gwang. Il-gwang believes that an evil spirit has [[Spirit possession|possessed]] Hyo-jin, but is unable to [[exorcism|exorcise]] it. After learning that Jong-goo disturbed the stranger, whom Il-gwang says is a [[demon]], he prepares a [[Curse|death-hex]] ritual. At the same time, the stranger performs a ritual in his home with a photograph of another victim, Park Choon-bae. Both the stranger and Hyo-jin experience excruciating pain as Il-gwang's ritual progresses. Panicking, Jong-goo stops the ritual and takes his daughter to the hospital. The stranger, having narrowly survived the death-hex, sees Moo-myeong outside his house.\n\nThe following day, Jong-goo gathers his companions to hunt down the stranger. As they search his house, they are attacked by the [[Zombie|reanimated corpse]] of Park Choon-bae, who injures Yang I-sam, giving the stranger time to flee. They pursue the stranger but lose him in the forest. The stranger, hiding, sees Moo-myeong watching him from afar. As Jong-goo's group drives back down the mountain, the stranger's body suddenly lands on the windshield. They dump it off a cliff as Moo-myeong watches from above. Jong-goo returns to find Hyo-jin's health and mental state has improved.\n\nIl-gwang drives to Jong-goo's house, where he encounters Moo-myeong and vomits blood. He flees back to his office, where he attempts and fails to perform a ritual; in terror, he leaves town and drives toward Seoul, but a swarm of flying insects stops him. He returns to the village and calls Jong-goo, warning him that Moo-myeong is the real demon, and that the stranger was a shaman who was trying to kill her. Meanwhile, the wounded Yang I-sam receives news that his uncle Oh Seong-bok has killed his family.\n\nHyo-jin disappears from the house. While searching for her, Jong-goo meets Moo-myeong, who claims the stranger is still alive. She tells him that she has set a trap for the demon, and that Il-gwang is secretly cooperating with him. Jong-goo asks her if she is a human or a ghost, and she gives a cryptic answer. Jong-goo notices she is wearing the personal items of the victims, including his daughter's hair pin. Believing this to be proof she is responsible, he returns home before the third cry of the rooster, nullifying Moo-myeong's trap. He discovers that Hyo-jin has murdered his wife and mother-in-law. When Hyo-jin enters the house, he calls out to her; she ignores his pleas and attacks him. Il-gwang arrives and takes photographs of Jong-goo's dead family as Hyo-jin sits in a trance. As Jong-goo lays dying, he remembers happier times with his daughter and begins to smile, assuring her that he will protect her.\n\nYang I-sam returns to the stranger's house with a sickle and a [[Christian cross|cross]]. He finds the stranger, alive, inside a nearby cave, and accuses him of being a demon. The stranger photographs Yang I-sam, then assumes his true appearance\u2014that of the red-eyed demon\u2014and taunts him.\n\n===Deleted ending===\nIn a deleted scene happening right after the conclusion of the story, the Japanese man is seen sitting on a bench by the roadside. He spots a family on the other side of the road and invites a child to him by offering her candies, but the mom picks up the kid before she manages to reach the stranger. A car driven by Il-gwang arrives and picks up the Japanese man before leaving. In the center of the road, Moo-myeong witnesses the car fading away in the horizon.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Kwak Do-won]] as Jong-goo, policeman and father of Hyo-Jin.\n*[[Hwang Jung-min]] as Il-gwang, a shaman hired to protect the village.\n*[[Chun Woo-hee]] as Moo-myung, [[White Lady (ghost)|the woman in white]].\n*[[Jun Kunimura]] as a Japanese stranger.\n*[[Kim Hwan-hee]] as Hyo-jin, Jong-goo's daughter.\n*Her Jin as Jong-goo's mother-in-law.\n*[[Jang So-yeon]] as Jong-goo's wife.\n*Kim Do-yoon as Yang I-sam, a Japanese-speaking deacon.\n*Son Gang-guk as Oh Seong-bok, Jong-goo's police partner.\n*[[Park Sung-yeon]] as Kwon Myeong-joo.\n*Kil Chang-gyoo as Park Choon-bae\n*[[Jeon Bae-soo]] as Deok-gi.\n*Jeong Mi-nam as Heung-gook.\n*Choi Gwi-hwa as Byeong-gyoo.\n*[[Lee Seon-hee]] as Byeong-gyu's wife.\n*[[Jo Yeon-hee]] as Bar hostess.\n*Baek Seung-cheol as Friend.\n*Kwon Hyeok-joon as Friend.\n*Park Chae-ik as Friend.\n*Kim Gi-cheon as Dispatch captain.\n*Yoo Soon-woong as Chief of police.\n*Jo Han-cheol as Detective 1.\n*Kim Song-il as Police.\n*Bae Yong-geun as Police.\n*Im Jae-il as Police.\n*Lee In-cheol as Father.\n*Jo Seon-joo as Bar hostess.\n*Lee Chang-hoon as Doctor.\n*Kim Ji-won as Nurse.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n=== Release ===\n''The Wailing'' was released in South Korea on May 12, 2016.<ref name=\"variety-release\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/korean-thriller-wailing-release-date-1201767504/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=The Wailing|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=5 May 2016 |access-date=21 December 2016}}</ref> The film was shown in the Out of Competition section at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in France on May 18, and was released in the United States on May 27.<ref name=\"variety-release\" /> The film was then released on [[Netflix]] at a later date, though it has since been taken off the streaming service.
