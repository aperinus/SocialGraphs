Twenty-two years ago during an op in Africa, Lake was captured by terrorist Muhammad Banir (Alexander Karim) and tortured by having his head repeatedly bashed and having his ear mutilated. During the extraction and ensuing explosion, Banir went missing and was presumed dead, although Lake never believed it and has obsessively tried to find Banir ever since. As a result of the trauma he sustained under torture, Lake is now suffering from early stage [[frontotemporal dementia]], and his boss considers him a liability to the agency.\n\nIn [[Bucharest]], police tail a Kenyan national, Abdi, carrying a mysterious [[USB flash drive|USB drive]]. A car chase ensues, and rather than giving himself up, the courier throws himself and the drive off a bridge. The [[Romanian Intelligence Service]] retrieve the drive and the body, but the data is corrupted, so it is subsequently sent to the CIA. Milt gets a hit on large quantities of an experimental drug treating [[thalassemia]], information corroborated in the USB data. The drugs are for an anonymous [[Kenya]]n client, and are coming from a [[University of Bucharest]] clinic run by Professor Dr. Iulian Cornel. Since thalassemia is hereditary, Milt concludes that Banir is ordering shipments of the drug through a middleman, Dr. Wangari. He tells Lake, who asks his superiors to go after Banir. However, they still believe he's dead, and refuse. Later, Lake has a violent outburst during a search and resigns on the spot. During this time, in Kenya, Banir sends his man Aasim to Bucharest to find out why Abdi has not delivered the medicine.\n\nLake tells Milt about his mental deterioration, which becomes increasingly apparent as the film progresses. When Lake decides to go to Romania, Milt goes along. In Bucharest, the men meet Michelle Zubarain ([[Ir\u00e8ne Jacob]]), a former journalist, possible agent, and Lake's one-time love, who has information about Cornel providing the drug Banir needs. The trio meet with the professor, compelling him to acknowledge his role and to admit that Banir is forcing him to travel to Kenya. As Lake, Milt, and Michelle leave the professor's office building, Aasim sees them. The next day, the three return to the professor's office in hopes of following whomever the professor meets. They watch until the professor comes outside to meet Aasim, but Aasim spots them and runs. While Lake takes the money, drugs, and passport from the professor in order to impersonate him in Kenya, Milt catches Aasim and slits his throat, effectively preventing him from contacting Banir.\n\nMichelle finds a make-up specialist to help Lake transform into the professor, then Lake and Milt fly to Mombasa. The disguise works, and Lake is driven out of the city to Banir's hideout, and through a ruse and some small hand-to-hand combat, is finally alone with Banir. Lake reveals himself to the terrorist, but at that moment has an attack of dementia-fueled flashbacks, during which the disparity between the young terrorist who maimed Lake twenty-two years earlier and the now aging, fragile, and terminally-ill man is very clear. Without taking any further action, Lake abruptly leaves Banir. The next day, Lake and Milt are strolling around their Mombasan hotel's swimming pool and garden, which is full of people, when a shot rings out and a young Kenyan passing Lake suddenly drops. Lake sees that Milt has been hit, too (not fatally), and returns fire to the gunmen, ultimately killing both and being shot twice himself. Understanding that Banir has sent them, he takes their vehicle, driving into the night back to Banir's hideout, where he engages in a short (and prone) knife fight with Banir before killing him.  But as he returns to Mombasa, he is still losing blood, and the flashbacks and voices return. Lake appears to drive head-on into a truck. The closing moments of the film move (with a voice-over by Lake) to [[Arlington National Cemetery]], where a tombstone bearing Lake's name is shown; to Langley; to  a voice-over of Lake giving a speech (from early in the film); and to Milt giving Michelle a memento of Lake's that is important to her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Nicolas Cage]]<ref name=\"Nicolas\" /> as Evan Lake\n* [[Anton Yelchin]]<ref name=\"Anton\" /> as Milton Schultz\n* [[Ir\u00e8ne Jacob]]<ref name=\"Anton\" /> as Michelle Zubarain \n* [[Alexander Karim]]<ref name=\"Anton\" /> as Muhammad Banir\n* [[Adetomiwa Edun]] as Mbui\n* [[Geff Francis]] as Dr. Clayborne\n* [[Silas Carson]] as Dr. Sanjar\n* Claudius Peters as Ghedi\n* \u015eerban Celea as Dr. Iulian Cornel\n* Tim Silano as Mike Warner\n* [[David Lipper]] as Bob Deacon\n* George Remes as Jim\n* Cosim Dominte as Policeman 1\n* Ovidiu Niculescu as Policeman 2\n* Arsha Aghdasi as Abdi Abikarim\n* Seth Kozak as Therapist\n* Ilinca Goia as CIA Secretary\n* Alan O'Silva as Waiter\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Narrator (''Dark'' only)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn January 2010, [[Nicolas Winding Refn]] was attached to direct [[Paul Schrader]]'s script, with [[Harrison Ford]]  to star as lead.<ref>{{cite news|last=Raup|first=Jordan|title=Harrison Ford To Star In Nicolas Winding Refn's 'The Dying Of The Light'|url=http://thefilmstage.com/news/harrison-ford-to-star-in-nicolas-winding-refns-the-dying-of-the-light/|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=thefilmstage.com|date=29 January 2010}}</ref> [[Channing Tatum]] was attached in a supporting role.
