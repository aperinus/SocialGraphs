THIS SUMMARY IS AT 629. Please add nothing without removing something first, and checking the wordcount. -->\nWhenever Litwak's [[Amusement arcade|Arcade]] closes, the various [[video game]] characters leave their in-game roles and socialize via a [[power strip]] they call Game Central Station. Wreck-it Ralph, the villain of ''Fix-it Felix, Jr.'', visits a villain support group called Bad-Anon and expresses frustration with his assigned role. When Ralph is excluded from the game's thirtieth-anniversary party, he determines to win a medal and earn respect. Upon overhearing that one can earn medals in the new [[first-person shooter game]] ''Hero's Duty'', Ralph sneaks in and steals one while the characters fight insectoid monsters known as Cy-Bugs. Ralph accidentally launches himself in an [[escape pod|escape shuttle]] with a Cy-Bug inside and crash-lands in the candy-themed [[kart racing game]] ''Sugar Rush''. With Ralph gone, his game is labeled out of order. Felix leaves the game to find Ralph, allying with Sergeant Calhoun, the heroine of ''Hero's Duty'', as she tracks the Cy-Bug, which may become a [[computer virus|virus]]. \n\nIn ''Sugar Rush'', Vanellope von Schweetz steals Ralph's medal and uses it to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which characters will be playable the next day. King Candy forbids her to race, as she has a [[glitch]] that causes her to move and teleport erratically. Vanellope promises to get the medal back if Ralph helps her win; he helps her build a new kart and teaches her to drive inside [[Diet Cola]] Mountain. Calhoun and Felix arrive in ''Sugar Rush'', where they fall into [[Nesquik]]-[[quicksand|sand]], work together to escape, and begin to fall in love. Meanwhile, King Candy [[hacker culture|hacks]] into ''Sugar Rush''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[source code]] and retrieves the medal, giving it back to Ralph. He claims that if Vanellope becomes a playable character, her glitching may lead to the game being labeled out of order and unplugged. Ralph decides he cannot allow Vanellope to race and destroys her kart. Calhoun abandons Felix when he inadvertently reminds her of her late fianc\u00e9; Felix is imprisoned by King Candy's assistant, Sour Bill, while Calhoun discovers that the Cy-Bug has multiplied exponentially.\n\nRalph sadly returns to ''Fix-it Felix, Jr.'' and finds it abandoned. He notices that the ''Sugar Rush'' [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]] displays Vanellope as a [[playable character]]. Returning to ''Sugar Rush'', Ralph interrogates Sour Bill, who admits that King Candy disconnected Vanellope's code and locked away the memories of the game's characters so that no one knows her actual role. He explains that if Vanellope completes a race, all of King Candy's changes will be deleted and the game will reset, meaning Vanellope will no longer be a glitch. Ralph frees Felix from King Candy's prison, fixes the kart, and reconciles with Vanellope, who enters in the race. The Cy-Bugs emerge and start destroying the game; Calhoun, Felix, and Ralph help evacuate the characters. Unaware of this development, King Candy attempts to ram Vanellope off the track, causing them both to glitch. Their glitching inadvertently reveals King Candy to be Turbo, a video game character who secretly took over ''Sugar Rush'' after he accidentally got his own racing game, ''TurboTime'', unplugged 30 years before. Vanellope flees as Turbo is eaten by a Cy-Bug, which fuses with him into an insectoid monster. Everyone but Vanellope evacuates, as glitches cannot leave their games. Remembering from ''Hero's Duty'' that a beacon will draw and destroy the Cy-Bugs, Ralph battles Turbo and collapses the [[Mentos]] roof of Diet Cola Mountain, creating a glowing [[Diet Coke and Mentos eruption|eruption]] which lures and destroys Turbo and the Cy-Bugs. Vanellope rescues Ralph and crosses the finish line. The game resets, revealing her as the true ruler of ''Sugar Rush'', though she keeps her glitching ability, considering it an advantage.\n\nRalph returns to his game, content with his role as \"villain\" and respected by his fellow characters. Felix and Calhoun marry, and Ralph watches Vanellope become ''Sugar Rush''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s favorite character.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Sarah Silverman John C.
