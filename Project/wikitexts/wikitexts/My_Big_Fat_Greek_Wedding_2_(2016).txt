The film stars Vardalos, [[John Corbett]], [[Lainie Kazan]], [[Michael Constantine]] (in his final film role), [[Andrea Martin]], [[Ian Gomez]] and [[Elena Kampouris]]. It is the [[sequel]] to the 2002 film ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'' and the second installment in the ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding (franchise)|My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'' series. Filming began in late May 2015 in [[Toronto]]. The film was released on March 25, 2016, by [[Universal Pictures]], receiving negative reviews from critics.

A third film, entitled ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3]]'', is currently in production at Universal Pictures' division [[Focus Features]].<ref name=\"Greek3_SR\">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/my-big-fat-greek-wedding-3-confirmed-details/|work=Screen Rant|title=My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 Is Officially In The Works|last=Guerrero|first=Bethany|date=April 8, 2021|access-date=April 26, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nToula Portokalos-Miller's  life is in shambles. Her travel agency and the family dry cleaners have closed due to the recession. The only business still open is the family restaurant that her father, Gus, still runs. Her husband, Ian, is the principal at their teen-aged daughter Paris' high school. Paris, who is applying to college, feels smothered by her close-knit clan, who constantly interfere in her life. Desperate for independence and privacy, she applies to schools across the country. Ian and Toula's marriage has become strained due to Toula's obsessive need to be involved in Paris' life and to \"fix\" whatever goes wrong in her family.\n\nMeanwhile, Gus has convinced himself that he is directly descended from [[Alexander the Great]] and wants to write to an online ancestry site for confirmation. While sorting through his records, he discovers that his and Maria's  marriage certificate was never signed by the priest, technically invalidating their union. His current priest isn't allowed to sign it but agrees to perform a new ceremony. Gus insists that he and Maria must marry again after fifty years together, but Maria wants Gus to propose properly. Gus refuses, infuriating Maria, who refuses to go through with the ceremony. Meanwhile, when Toula and Ian are on a date night to rekindle their romance, their family catches them making out in their car outside their house. After Gus lands in the hospital and Maria refuses to go, saying she is not his wife, Gus pleads for her to marry him again. This time she accepts.\n\nMaria wants the wedding she never had and hires a wedding planner who quits after the rowdy family's choices become too outlandish. The whole family, including Ian's parents, Rodney and Harriet, and Angelo's business partner, Patrick, pitch in to make the wedding happen. Nick urges Angelo to tell his parents, Voula and Taki, that Patrick is also Angelo's romantic partner. Gus's estranged brother, Panos, arrives from Greece as a surprise.\n\nParis has been accepted to [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago and [[New York University|NYU]] in New York City. She chooses Northwestern to please her mother, but Paris' great-grandmother convinces her she should go to New York. Paris asks Bennett, a boy she has a crush on, to the prom. He is also Greek, with an equally crazy Greek family. Prom is the same night as the wedding. Toula tells Paris she can go to the prom if she attends the reception later. En route to the church, Gus, Panos, and Taki arrive drunk after many shots of ouzo. Maria storms off to the vestry after seeing Gus acting foolishly, feeling he is not taking the wedding seriously. Panos tells Maria that Gus had confided to him his love for Maria, and the ceremony continues. Watching as Gus and Maria renew their marriage ceremony (Greeks don't recite vows), Ian and Toula privately renew theirs. At the prom, Paris and Bennett share their first kiss while slow-dancing.\n\nAt the wedding reception, Gus reads a letter from the ancestry site verifying that he is a descendant of Alexander the Great. Ian, however, realizes that Toula forged the letter to make her father happy. The movie ends with the entire family dropping Paris off at her college dorm in New York.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nia Vardalos]] as Fotoula \"Toula\" Portokalos-Miller\n* [[John Corbett]] as Ian Miller, Toula's husband.

And it's only now that I've really become open to the idea. Over the years, I've heard from everybody about what the sequel should be. People next to me at Starbucks would say, \"Hey, let me tell you my idea,\" and I'd be like, \"Hey, I'm just trying to get a cup of coffee.\" I never thought much about it. But then when John (Corbett) and I recently sat down to do that interview (for the 10th anniversary edition), we laughed so hard through the whole thing. It made me think that it's time. He said, \"Come on, write something, will you?\" And I now think I will. We have such an easy chemistry together. And we have chemistry because we never \"did it.\" That's the surefire way to kill chemistry in a scene. You have to make sure your actors don't \"do it\" off-screen. If they don't \"do it,\" then they'll have chemistry on camera.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/12/nia-vardalos-my-big-fat-greek-wedding_n_2099925.html |title=Nia Vardalos: 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' Star Talks Chemistry, Motherhood And Plans For A Sequel|work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=2012-11-12|first=Shelley|last=Emling|access-date=2015-05-30}}</ref>}}\n\nOn May 27, 2014, various news and media outlets reported that a sequel was in the works.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=Nia Vardalos, Playtone Reuniting for 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' Sequel|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-big-fat-greek-wedding-707365|access-date=May 22, 2015|work=hollywoodreporter.com|date=May 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/27/my-big-fat-greek-wedding/9646865/|title='My Big Fat Greek Wedding' gets big fat sequel|website=[[USA Today]]|date=May 27, 2014|first=Bryan|last=Alexander|access-date=June 14, 2022}}</ref> Vardalos later confirmed this via Twitter, and wrote the script for the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=(1 of 2) I'm working on the MBFGWedding sequel;
