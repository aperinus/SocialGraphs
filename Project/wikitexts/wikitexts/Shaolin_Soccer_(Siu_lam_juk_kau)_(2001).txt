A former [[Shaolin monk]] reunites his five brothers,<ref group=\"note\">\"Brothers\" here does not mean biological brothers, but \"master-brothers\", aka fellow disciples in [[martial arts]] under the same master. Therefore the \"biggest brother\" is the first one to be adopted by his mentor (the \"[[Shifu|master-father]]\"), not necessarily the oldest one.</ref> years after their master's death, to apply their superhuman martial arts skills to play football and bring [[Shaolin kung fu]] to the masses.\n\n==Plot==\nSing is a master of [[Shaolin kung fu]], whose goal in life is to promote the spiritual and practical benefits of the martial art to modern society. He experiments with various methods, but none bear positive results. He then meets \"Golden Leg\" Fung; a legendary [[Football in Hong Kong|Hong Kong soccer]] star in his day, who is now walking with a limp, following the betrayal of a former teammate, Hung, now a rich businessman. Sing explains his desires to Fung, who in turn offers his services to coach Sing in soccer. Sing is compelled by the idea of promoting kung fu through soccer, and agrees to enlist his former Shaolin brothers to form a team under Fung's management. Sing and Fung attempt to put together an unbeatable soccer team. After some failed attempts, Sing's brothers all agree to participate in the team. Fung invites a vicious team to play against them for a scrimmage, and the thugs proceed to give the Shaolin Team a literal beating. When all seems lost, the Shaolin disciples reawaken and utilize their special powers, dismantling the other team's rough play easily. The thugs then give up and ask to join Sing's team.\n\nSing meets Mui, a baker with severe [[acne]] who uses [[Tai chi]] to bake [[mantou]]. He takes her to look at very expensive dresses at a high-end department store after hours. She soon forms an attachment to Sing and even gets a makeover in an attempt to impress him. However, this backfires and when Mui reveals her feelings to him: he tells her he only wants to be her friend. This revelation, coupled with the constant bullying from her overbearing boss, leads Mui to disappear.\n\n''Team Shaolin'' enters the open cup competition in Hong Kong, where they chalk up consecutive and often ridiculously one-sided victories due to their special Shaolin techniques. They end up meeting Team Evil in the final, owned by none other than Hung. Team Evil had been injected with an American [[doping (sports)|drug]], granting them [[superhuman strength]] and speed, making them practically invincible, and they bring Team Shaolin back to reality when Team Evil's amazing capabilities prove more than a match for them. After Team Evil takes out Team Shaolin's two goalkeepers, Mui, who has shaved her hair and improved her face, reappears to be a goalkeeper for Team Shaolin.\n\nIn their final attack, Team Evil's [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] leaps into the sky and kicks the ball with enormous force towards Mui, who prevents him from scoring with her tai chi. Mui and Sing combine their martial skills and rocket the ball downfield. The ball plows through Team Evil's goal post, thereby scoring the winning goal. Sing is then thrown into the air in celebration as the trophy is presented to him and his team.\n\nA newspaper article then shows Hung being stripped of his title of soccer chairman and sentenced to jail for five years, while the players of Team Evil are permanently banned from playing soccer professionally. Sing goes out for a morning jog and feels joy at seeing the people around him practicing Kung Fu and implementing it into their daily lives, his lifelong dream having become a reality. The camera pans to a large poster of Sing and Mui, who have since married and became famous for winning a world championship in bowling, among other things.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stephen Chow]] as Sing / Mighty Steel Leg (#10):<br>A Shaolin kung fu practitioner and former monk who wants to promote the martial arts form to the world. He is the team's [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] and uses his extremely powerful legs to produce unstoppable soccer shots.\n* [[Ng Man-tat]] as Fung / Golden Leg:<br>A homeless man and former soccer player from the 1980s who became crippled after being beaten by an angry mob after a match, which he deliberately lost after taking a bribe from Hung, the coach of Team Evil.\n* [[Wong Yat-fei]] as Iron Head (#11):<br>The eldest of the Shaolin monk brothers, who is now working in a club. His style of kung fu utilizes his immensely hard head, and he specializes in [[Forward (association football)|headers]] during matches.\n* Mok Mei-lam as Hooking Leg (#2):<br>The second eldest of the Shaolin monk brothers, who is now working as a dishwasher. As the team's [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]], Hooking Leg's Shaolin skills resemble [[Ditangquan|ground tumbling boxing]], which he uses to keep the ball away from the opponent and confuse them.\n* [[Tin Kai-man]] as [[Iron Shirt]] (#3):<br>The third of the Shaolin monk brothers, who is now working as a businessman. As the team's full-back, Iron Shirt can absorb blunt force attacks without injuries, as well as hold and propel the ball with his abdomen.\n* [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] as Empty Hand / Lightning Hand (#1):<br>The fourth of the Shaolin monk brothers, who is now unemployed and job-hunting. Empty Hand resembles [[Bruce Lee]] to the point of wearing his yellow and black jumpsuit from ''[[Game of Death]]''. As the team's [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], his fast hands and powerful arms allow him to instantly and accurately catch objects thrown at him.\n* [[Lam Chi-chung]] as Light Weight Vest (#6):<br>The sixth and youngest of the Shaolin monk brothers, who has become obese and gluttonous after being diagnosed with a pituitary disease. He is the team's [[Forward (association football)#Winger|winger]]. Despite his illness, he is capable of utilizing his style of kung fu to leap incredible heights, giving the illusion of flight.\n* [[Zhao Wei]] as Mui:<br>A baker and Sing's love interest, who is skilled at manipulating objects with [[tai chi]]. She rarely speaks Cantonese, but everyone else still understands her and vice versa.\n* [[Patrick Tse]] as Hung:<br>The coach of Team Evil and Fung's former teammate, who has maintained a rivalry with Fung after forcing him to take a bribe during a match in the 1980s.\n* Shik Zi-yun as Team Evil's striker (#9), who can [[flip (acrobatic)|back flip]] and soar into the sky to kick a fiery ball to its target.\n* Cao Hua as Team Evil's goalkeeper (#21), who can guard his goalpost with one hand in his pocket. His incredibly strong hands can crush a thick metal crossbar.\n* [[Cecilia Cheung]] and [[Karen Mok]] as Team Dragon players #7 & #11, who can run so fast that they appear to be inches above the ground. \n* Fung Min-hun as the captain of Team Rebellion, a vicious mobster who wields a [[Adjustable spanner|crescent wrench]] and steel [[mallet]] as weapons. \n* [[Vincent Kok]] as the captain of Team Tofu, the team that Team Shaolin faces in the preliminary match.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Inspiration===\nThe inspiration for ''Shaolin Soccer'' came from Chow wanting a unique premise for a martial arts action film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.allocine.fr/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=712778.html |title=\"Shaolin soccer\" : Stephen Chow au micro! |first=Yoann |last=Sardet |date=2002-08-19 |website=AlloCin\u00e9 |language=fr |access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> According to an interview with ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere Magazine]]'', Chow stated,\n\n{{cquote|Actually the 'over the top' CG and kinetic soccer moves were an inspiration that came from the classic Japanese manga series ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]''.

For example, [[Lam Chi Chung]] (Light Weight) had worked as Chow's screenwriter and [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] (Empty Hand) was the [[choreography|dance choreographer]] hired to design the \"[[Michael Jackson]] dance number\" that followed Sing and Mui's first meeting early in the film. Chow comments he made Chan wear [[Bruce Lee]]'s [[Game of Death#Yellow-and-black jumpsuit|yellow-and-black tracksuit]] because only the [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] \"can wear a special uniform.\" Tin Kai-man (Iron Shirt) had been Chow's [[Unit production manager|production manager]] on several movies, but had acted in numerous minor roles in previous films.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lovehkfilm.com/people/tin_kai_man.htm |title=Tin Kai-Man |access-date=24 March 2009 | website=LoveHKfilm.com |first=Ross |last=Chen}}</ref> For instance, he played a young wanna-be [[Triad society|Triad]] member in Chow's preceding movie, ''[[King of Comedy (film)|King of Comedy]]''. [[Cecilia Cheung]] and [[Karen Mok]], who [[Cameo appearance|briefly appear]] as Team Dragon Players 7 & 11 in ''Shaolin Soccer'', had major roles in King of Comedy. Chow defends his decision to hire non-actors, saying, \"In terms of finding talent, I try to bring out the funniest thing I notice about them during casting, if it made us laugh at the casting, it will also do on the big screen.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premiere.com/features/1073/q-a-stephen-chow.html |title=Q&A: Stephen Chow |first=Kristin |last=Lootens |date=6 December 2003 |website=Premiere.com |access-date=25 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213030016/http://www.premiere.com/features/1073/q-a-stephen-chow.html |archive-date=13 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nZhao Wei, who played the Mandarin-speaking Mui, said it was a different step for her to star in a Hong Kong production. However, Zhao admitted that she was not impressed with her look with less makeup because she is easily recognisable for her beautiful appearance.\n\nThree of the principal cast members appeared in Chow's ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'': Danny Chan Kwok-kwan (Empty Hand) portrayed ''Brother Sum'', boss of the \"Axe Gang\"; Tin Kai-man (Iron Shirt) portrayed the loud-mouthed ''advisor'' of Brother Sum; and [[Lam Chi-chung]] (Light Weight) portrayed ''Bone'', Chow's sidekick and partner in petty crime. Fung Min-hun (Team Rebellion Captain) briefly appeared as Cecilia Cheung's abusive boyfriend in ''[[King of Comedy (film)|King of Comedy]]'' and the ''Four Eyes Clerk'' who beats up both Sing and Bone when they make fun of him on the bus in ''Kung Fu Hustle''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kungfucinema.com/kung-fu-hustle-2004-461 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20090309072300/http://www.kungfucinema.com/kung-fu-hustle-2004-461 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 9 March 2009 |title=Kung Fu Hustle (2004) |access-date=25 March 2009 |last=Pollard |first=Mark |date=22 August 2005 |website=Kung Fu Cinema}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nIn Hong Kong, the film was released on DVD<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yesasia.com/global/shaolin-soccer-extended-version-hong-kong-version/1001814990-0-0-0-en/info.html |title='Shaolin Soccer' (Extended Version) (Hong Kong Version) DVD |website=YESASIA.com}}</ref> and [[Video CD]] on 14 September 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yesasia.com/global/shaolin-soccer-extended-version/1001813742-0-0-0-en/info.html |title='Shaolin Soccer' (Extended Version) VCD |website=YESASIA.com}}</ref> The DVD release was shortened by 10 minutes, with the option for viewers to access the deleted scenes in the middle of the film.

For example, in the film a group of bar thugs beat up Sing and Iron Head after listening to their [[Lounge music|lounge]]-style tribute to [[Shaolin kung fu]]. The following day, Sing seeks out the group and uses his Shaolin skills to beat the thugs using a soccer ball. Fung sees the brawl and comes up with the idea of fusing kung fu and soccer. However, in the comic book, Sing is meditating in the park when he gets hit in the head with a soccer ball. The cocky players mock him and destroy a stone statue of his deceased master. Sing proceeds to use the soccer ball as a weapon.\n\nAnother example is the fact the characters are visually different from the film. All of their comic book personas look to be in their twenties to thirties, with highly toned athletic physiques (with the exception of Light Weight); even Iron Head, who was the eldest of the six brothers, appears younger than he should.\n\nSeveral online reviews have criticised the American adaptation for its apparent lack of story line coherence, mixture of realistic and cartoonish drawing styles, and bad Chinese-to-English translation, among other issues. In regards to the translation, one reviewer stated, \"It's almost as if the book was translated with a first-year English student referencing a Chinese-to-English dictionary, with strangely assembled sentences and strange bursts of dialogue peppering the pages.\"<ref name=icomics/> Another common complaint was that the comics seemed to be geared towards those people who had previously seen the movie.
