Based on [[Rod Serling]]'s [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|1959\u20131964 television series of the same name]], the film features four stories directed by Landis, Spielberg, [[Joe Dante]], and [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]].<ref>[https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-twilight-zone-history/ Television Was Never the Same After 'The Twilight Zone' \u2013 Film School Rejects]</ref> Landis' segment is an original story created for the film, while the segments by Spielberg, Dante, and Miller are remakes of episodes from the original series. The film's cast includes [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Albert Brooks]], [[Scatman Crothers]], [[John Lithgow]], [[Vic Morrow]], and [[Kathleen Quinlan]]. Original series cast members [[Burgess Meredith]], [[Patricia Barry]], [[Peter Brocco]], [[Murray Matheson]], [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], [[Bill Mumy]], and [[William Schallert]] also appear in the film, with Meredith assuming Serling's role as narrator.\n\nThe film's production achieved notoriety when Morrow and two illegally-hired child actors were killed in a [[Twilight Zone accident|stunt helicopter crash]] during filming of Landis' segment.<ref name=\"slate.com\">[https://slate.com/culture/2012/07/the-twilight-zone-tragedy-how-vic-morrows-death-changed-the-way-films-are-made.html The Twilight Zone Tragedy: How Vic Morrow's death changed the way movies are made \u2013 Slate]</ref> The deaths led to several years of legal action; although no individuals were found to be criminally liable, new procedures and safety standards were imposed in the filmmaking industry.<ref name=NYTObit>Weber, Bruce.

Accessed October 23, 2010.</ref> Upon release, the film received mixed reviews, with praise directed at Dante and Miller's segments, but criticism towards the segments by Landis and Spielberg. Despite the controversy and mixed reception, it was a commercial success, grossing $42 million on a $10 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Prologue ===\nThis segment was written and directed by [[John Landis]]. Two men are in a car driving along a country road late at night. The conversation turns to what episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' they found most scary. The passenger then asks, \"Do you want to see something ''really'' scary?\" and says to pull over. He transforms into a monster and devours the driver.\n\n'''Cast'''\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as the Driver\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as the Passenger\n\n=== Segment one ===\n\nThe first segment is a partial reworking, but not a full remake, of the episode \"[[A Quality of Mercy]]\". This segment was also written and directed by John Landis.\n\nBill Connor is bitter after being passed over for a promotion in favor of his [[Jews|Jewish]] co-worker, Goldman. Drinking in a bar after work with his friends, Larry and Ray, Bill utters slurs towards Jewish, [[African-Americans|black]] and [[Asians|Asian people]], blaming them for America's problems. A black man sitting nearby asks him to stop. After ranting some more, Bill leaves the bar angrily and finds himself in [[Nazi-occupied France]] during [[World War II]]. A pair of [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officers patrolling the streets interrogate him, believing him to be Jewish. Bill can't answer satisfactorily since he doesn't speak [[German language|German]]. A chase ensues, and Bill ends up on the ledge of a building, where he is shot at by the officers.\n\nHe falls from the ledge and lands in rural [[Alabama]] during the 1950s, where a group of [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen see him as an African-American man who they are about to [[lynching|lynch]]. Bill tells them he is white, to no avail. While trying to escape, he jumps into a lake and surfaces in a jungle during the [[Vietnam War]], being fired at by American soldiers, one of whom throws a grenade. Instead of killing him, the grenade launches him into occupied France again. There he is captured by the SS officers and put into an enclosed [[Holocaust train|railroad freight car]], along with Jewish prisoners bound for a concentration camp. Bill sees the bar with his friends standing outside, looking for him. He screams for help, but they can't see or hear him or the train as it pulls away.\n\n'''Cast'''\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Vic Morrow]] \u2013 Bill Connor\n* [[Doug McGrath]] \u2013 Larry\n* [[Charles Hallahan]] \u2013 Ray\n* Rainer Peets and [[Kai Wulff]] \u2013 German officers\n* Sue Dugan and Debby Porter \u2013 Waitresses\n* [[Steven Williams]] \u2013 Bar Patron\n* Annette Claudier \u2013 French mother\n* Joseph Hieu and [[Al Leong]] \u2013 Vietnamese men\n* Myca Dinh Le and Renee Shin-Yi Chen \u2013 Vietnamese children (scene deleted due to [[Twilight Zone accident|the death of both actors and Morrow during filming]])\n* [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]] \u2013 Charming G.I.\n* [[Tom Byrd|Thomas Byrd]], Vincent J.

This segment was directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], from a screenplay by [[George Clayton Johnson]], [[Richard Matheson]], and [[Melissa Mathison]] (credited as Josh Rogan), and a story by Johnson.\n\nAn old man named Mr. Bloom has just moved into Sunnyvale Retirement Home. He listens to the other elders reminisce about the joys they experienced in their youth. Bloom insists that being elderly should not, and need not, prevent them from enjoying life. He invites them to join him, later that night, for a game of [[kick the can]]. Leo Conroy objects, saying that they cannot engage in physical activity because they are all elderly.\n\nWhile Mr. Conroy sleeps, Mr. Bloom gathers the rest of the residents outside and plays the game, during which they are transformed into childhood versions of themselves. They are ecstatic to be young again, engaging in activities they enjoyed long ago, but their thoughts soon turn to practical matters such as where they will spend the night, since they will no longer be welcomed in the retirement home, and their families will not recognize them. They ask to be their true age again, and Mr. Bloom grants their wish, satisfied that, as with himself, their minds will remain young. Leo Conroy wakes up and notices that one resident, Mr. Agee, has opted to remain young. Conroy asks for Agee to take him along, but Agee tells him that such is impossible.\n\nThe next morning, Mr. Bloom finds Conroy kicking a can around the yard \u2013 having changed his outlook on life; Bloom breaks the [[fourth wall]] to assure the audience that \"He'll get it.\" Bloom then departs from Sunnyvale for another retirement home, in order to spread his good-natured magic among other senior citizens.\n\n'''Cast'''\n{{div col|colwidth=28em}}\n* [[Scatman Crothers]] \u2013 Mr. Bloom\n* [[Bill Quinn]] \u2013 Leo Conroy\n* [[Martin Garner (actor)|Martin Garner]] \u2013 Mr. Weinstein\n* [[Selma Diamond]] \u2013 Mrs. Weinstein\n* [[Helen Shaw (actress)|Helen Shaw]] \u2013 Mrs. Dempsey\n* [[Murray Matheson]] \u2013 Mr. Agee\n* [[Peter Brocco]] \u2013 Mr. Mute\n* [[Priscilla Pointer]] \u2013 Miss Cox\n* Scott Nemes \u2013 Young Mr. Weinstein\n* Tanya Fenmore \u2013 Young Mrs. Weinstein\n* Evan Richards \u2013 Young Mr. Agee\n* Laura Mooney \u2013 Young Mrs. Dempsey\n* Christopher Eisenmann \u2013 Young Mr. Mute\n* Richard Swingler \u2013 Mr. Gray Panther\n* Alan Haufrect \u2013 Mr. Conroy's Son\n* Cheryl Socher \u2013 Mr. Conroy's Daughter-in-Law\n* [[Elsa Raven]] \u2013 Nurse No. 2\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Segment three ===\nThe third segment is a remake of the episode \"[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/747652-interview-joe-dante-reflects-80s-twilight-zone-episode-shadow-man|title=Interview: Joe Dante Reflects on '80's Twilight Zone Episode, 'The Shadow Man'|last=Alexander|first=Chris|date=2015-11-05}}</ref> This segment was directed by [[Joe Dante]], from a screenplay by Richard Matheson, based on the short story by [[Jerome Bixby]].\n\nHelen Foley, traveling to a new job, visits a rural bar for directions. While talking to the owner, she witnesses a young boy, Anthony, being harassed by a local trying to watch a boxing match. Helen comes to the boy's defense. As Helen leaves the bar, she backs into Anthony with her car in the parking lot, damaging his bicycle. Helen offers Anthony a ride home.\n\nWhen Helen arrives with Anthony at home, she meets his family: Uncle Walt, sister Ethel, and mother and father. Anthony's family are excessively welcoming. Anthony starts to show Helen around the house, while the family rifles through Helen's purse and coat. There is a television set in every room showing cartoons. She comes to the room of another sister, Sara. Helen calls out to the girl, who is in a wheelchair and watching television, and gets no response. Anthony explains that Sara had been in an accident. Helen is not able to see that the girl has no mouth.\n\nAnthony announces that it is time for dinner, which consists of [[ice cream]], [[candy apples]], [[potato chips]], and [[hamburger]]s topped with [[peanut butter]]. Confused at first at the family's unconventional diet, Helen thinks that this is a birthday dinner for Anthony. Ethel complains at the prospect of ''another'' birthday; Anthony glares at her, and her plate flies out of her hands. Helen attempts to leave, but Anthony urges Helen to stay and see Uncle Walt's \"hat trick\". A top hat appears on top of the television set. Uncle Walt is very nervous about what could be in the hat, but he pulls out an ordinary rabbit. Anthony insists on an encore, and a large, mutant rabbit springs from the hat. As Helen attempts to flee, she spills the contents of her purse, and Anthony finds a note inside stating \"Help us! Anthony is a monster!\" When the family points the finger at Ethel, she reveals to Helen that they are not Anthony's real relatives. Anthony brought them to his house to be his surrogate family after he killed his parents, and presumably he is doing the same with Helen. In punishment for writing the note, Anthony sends Ethel into the television set where she is pursued and eaten by a cartoon [[dragon]].\n\nHelen attempts to escape, only to have the door blocked by a giant eye. Anthony vents his frustration at everyone being afraid of him, summoning another cartoonish monster out of the television. When Helen tells him to \"wish it away\", he makes the entire house disappear, taking himself and Helen outside the physical plane of existence. Anthony says that he sent his \"family\" back where they came from, since they did not want to be with him. He cannot understand why everyone is unhappy with him, since he believes he provided for their every possible desire.\n\nHelen offers to be Anthony's teacher and student, and help him find new uses for his power. After extracting a promise that she would never leave him, Anthony welcomes Helen's offer and makes her car reappear. As they drive through a barren landscape, meadows filled with bright flowers spring up alongside the road in the car's wake.\n\n'''Cast'''\n{{div col|colwidth=28em}}\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] \u2013 Helen Foley\n* Jeremy Licht \u2013 Anthony\n* [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] \u2013 Uncle Walt\n* [[Patricia Barry]] \u2013 Mother\n* [[William Schallert]] \u2013 Father\n* [[Nancy Cartwright]] \u2013 Ethel\n* [[Dick Miller]] \u2013 Walter Paisley\n* [[Cherie Currie]] \u2013 Sara\n* [[Bill Mumy]] \u2013 Tim\n* Jeffrey Bannister \u2013 Charlie\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Segment four ===\nThe fourth segment is a remake of the episode \"[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]\". This segment was directed by [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]], and written by Richard Matheson.\n\nWhile flying through a violent thunderstorm, airline passenger John Valentine is in a lavatory trying to recover from a [[panic attack]] due to a fear of flying. The [[flight attendant]]s coax Valentine from the lavatory and back to his seat.\n\nValentine notices a hideous [[gremlin]] on the wing of the plane and spirals into another severe panic. He watches as the creature wreaks havoc on the wing, throwing debris into one of the plane's [[turbofan]] engines and causing a [[flameout]]. Valentine finally snaps and attempts to break the window with an oxygen canister, but is wrestled to the ground by another passenger, a [[sky marshal]]. Valentine takes the marshal's revolver, shoots out the window (causing a breach in the [[pressurized cabin]]), and begins firing at the gremlin. This catches the attention of the gremlin, who rushes up to Valentine and bites the gun in half. After they notice that the plane is landing, the gremlin grabs Valentine's face, then simply scolds him for spoiling its fun by wagging its finger in his face. The creature leaps into the sky and flies away as the airplane begins its emergency landing.\n\nThe police, crew, and passengers write off Valentine as insane. However, the aircraft maintenance crew arrives and finds the damage to the plane's engines complete with claw marks, while a straitjacketed Valentine is carried off in an ambulance. The ambulance driver is the car passenger from the prologue. The driver turns to Valentine and says \"Heard you had a big scare up there, huh? Wanna see something ''really'' scary?\"\n\n'''Cast'''\n{{div col|colwidth=28em}}\n* [[John Lithgow]] \u2013 John Valentine\n* [[Abbe Lane]] \u2013 Sr. Flight attendant\n* [[Donna Dixon]] \u2013 Jr. Flight attendant\n* [[John Dennis Johnston]] \u2013 Co-Pilot\n* [[Larry Cedar]] \u2013 Gremlin\n* Charles Knapp \u2013 [[Sky marshal]]\n* Byron McFarland \u2013 Pilot Announcement\n* [[Christina Nigra]] \u2013 Little girl\n* Lana Schwab \u2013 Mother\n* Margaret Wheeler \u2013 Old woman\n* [[Eduard Franz]] \u2013 Old man\n* Margaret Fitzgerald \u2013 Young girl\n* [[Jeffrey Weissman]] \u2013 Young man\n* Carol Serling \u2013 Passenger\n* Jeffrey Lampert, Frank Toth \u2013 Mechanics\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe cartoon dragon in segment three was animated by [[Sally Cruikshank]] of ''[[Quasi at the Quackadero]]'' fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/sally-cruikshank-a-career-retrospective-part-one/|title=Sally Cruikshank: A Career Retrospective, Part 1 |work=Art of the Title}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wexarts.org/read-watch-listen/go-hell-sally-cruikshank|title=Go to Hell with Sally Cruikshank|publisher=Wexner Center for the Arts}}</ref>\n\nThe prologue scene with Aykroyd and Brooks was shot before the [[Vic Morrow]] helicopter accident.

The two child actors were hired in violation of California law, which prohibits child actors from working at night or in proximity to explosions, and requires the presence of a teacher or social worker. During the subsequent trial, Landis denied culpability for the accident, but admitted that their hiring was \"wrong\".<ref name=\"slate.com\"/>\n\nProducer and co-director Steven Spielberg was so disgusted by Landis's handling of the situation, he ended their friendship and publicly called for the end of the ''[[New Hollywood]]'' Era, where directors had almost complete control over film. When approached by the press about the accident, he stated, \"No movie is worth dying for. I think people are standing up much more now, than ever before, to producers and directors who ask too much. If something isn't safe, it's the right and responsibility of every actor or crew member to yell, 'Cut!'\". Co-director George Miller was so repulsed by the entire scenario, he abandoned post-production of his segment, leaving Joe Dante to supervise editing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gulfnews.com/entertainment/hollywood/deadliest-horror-movies-ever-made-films-surrounded-by-real-life-death-1.74669152|title=Deadliest horror movies ever made: Films surrounded by real-life death|publisher=Hollywood \u2014 Gulf News}}</ref>\n\nThe scenes involving the child actors were not in Landis's original draft for the segment. After Warner Brothers executives [[Lucy Fisher]] and [[Terry Semel]] objected that the central character of the segment was too unsympathetic, Landis came up with the idea of Morrow's character, Bill Connor, redeeming himself by rescuing two Vietnamese orphans.<ref name=CrimeLibrary/> In the scene that served as the original ending, Bill was to have traveled back through time again and stumbled into a deserted Vietnamese village where he finds two young Vietnamese children left behind when a U.S. Army helicopter appears and begins shooting at them. Morrow was to take both children under his arms and escape out of the village as the hovering helicopter destroyed the village with multiple explosions. The helicopter pilot had trouble navigating through the fireballs created by pyrotechnic effects for the sequence. A technician on the ground did not know this and detonated two of the pyrotechnic charges close together.<ref name=CrimeLibrary/> The flash-force of the two explosions caused the low-flying helicopter to spin out of control and crash land on top of Morrow and the two children as they were crossing a small pond away from the village mock-up. All three were killed instantly; Morrow and Le were decapitated by the helicopter's top rotor blades while Chen was crushed to death by one of the struts.<ref name=CrimeLibrary>{{cite web|first=Denise |last=Noe |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/twilight_zone/1.html |title=The Twilight Zone Tragedy |website=[[Crime Library]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122231908/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/twilight_zone/1.html |archivedate=January 22, 2009 }}. [[Crime Library]]. Accessed 2011-02-09.</ref> A report released in May 1984 by the National Transportation Safety Board stated: {{blockquote|The probable cause of the accident was the detonation of debris-laden high-temperature special effects explosions too near a low-flying helicopter leading to foreign object damage to one rotor blade and [[delamination]] due to heat to the other rotor blade, the separation of the helicopter's tail rotor assembly, and the uncontrolled descent of the helicopter. The proximity of the helicopter (around 25 feet off the ground) to the special effects explosions was due to the failure to establish direct communications and coordination between the pilot, who was in command of the helicopter operation, and the film director, who was in charge of the filming operation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aircraft Accident Report|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR84-14.pdf|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|access-date=6 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305010558/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR84-14.pdf|archive-date=March 5, 2012|url-status=usurped|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nLandis has said that the actual ending of the segment was unaffected by the accident.{{sfn|Vallan|2008|p=106}} When asked how the film changed from its initial conception after the accident, Landis replied, \"The intercutting between the actions of the KKK and American GIs and the Vietcong and the Nazis became more and more frenetic as [Bill] tried to protect the children. Finally, the Nazis take the children away and shoot them and load him up on the train. We decided not to use any footage of the children. It was a very difficult situation. Do we keep it in the movie? ...And, ultimately, we decided it would be really outrageous to Vic Morrow if we just cut it out of the movie completely.{{sfn|Vallan|2008|p=108}} Landis has also said, \"There are moments [in the segment] I think work well. When [Bill] is in the cattle car, and he looks back and you see his POV of the bar going by. I think that's an unsettling image.\"{{sfn|Vallan|2008|p=106}}\n\nMyca and Renee were being paid [[Unreported employment|under the table]] to circumvent California's child labor laws. California did not allow children to work at night. Landis opted not to seek a waiver. The casting agents were unaware that the children would be involved in the scene. Associate producer [[George Folsey, Jr.]] told the children's parents not to tell any firefighters on set that the children were part of the scene, and also hid them from a fire safety officer who also worked as a welfare worker. A fire safety officer was concerned the blasts would cause a crash, but did not tell Landis of his concerns.<ref name=CrimeLibrary/>\n\nThe accident led to civil and criminal action against the filmmakers which lasted nearly a decade. Landis, Folsey, production manager Dan Allingham, pilot Dorcey Wingo and explosives specialist Paul Stewart were tried and acquitted on charges of [[manslaughter]] in a nine-month trial in 1986 and 1987.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-29/news/mn-2189_1_helicopter-crash | title=John Landis Not Guilty in 3 'Twilight Zone' Deaths : Jury Also Exonerates Four Others | work=Los Angeles Times | date=May 29, 1987 | access-date=July 26, 2012 | author=Feldman, Paul}}</ref> As a result of the accident, second assistant director Andy House had his name removed from the credits and replaced with the pseudonym [[Alan Smithee]].

Ebert noted that \"the surprising thing is, the two superstar directors are thoroughly routed by two less-known directors whose previous credits have been horror and action pictures...

It later expanded to 1,288 theaters and ended up grossing $29,450,919 in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twilight Zone: The Movie|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=twilightzone.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|access-date=6 February 2012}}</ref> Internationally, it grossed $12.5 million for a worldwide gross of $42 million.<ref name=behemoth/> Having cost $10 million to make, it was not the enormous hit which executives were looking for, but it was still a financial success and it helped stir enough interest for [[CBS]] to give the go-ahead to the 1980s TV version of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.\n\nIt was released to [[LaserDisc]] and [[VHS]] several times, most recently as part of WB's \"Hits\" line, and was released for [[DVD]], [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on October 9, 2007. Both the Blu-ray and DVD are out of print and are considered collector's items.\n\n== Novelization ==\n[[Robert Bloch]] wrote the book adaptation of ''Twilight Zone: The Movie''. Bloch's order of segments does not match the order in the film itself, as he was given the original screenplay to work with, in which \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" was the second segment, and \"Kick the Can\" was the fourth. The movie's prologue is missing in the novelization. Bloch claimed that no one told him the anthology had a wraparound sequence. Bloch also said that in the six weeks he was given to write the book, he only saw a screening of two of the segments; he had to hurriedly change the ending of the first segment, after the helicopter accident that occurred during filming.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Robert|title=Once Around the Bloch: An Unauthorized Autobiography|year=1983|publisher=Tor Books|pages=388\u2013389}}</ref> As originally written, the first segment would have ended as it did in the original screenplay (Connor finds redemption by saving two Vietnamese children whose village is being destroyed by the [[Air Cavalry]]). The finished book reflects how the first segment ends in the final cut of the film.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n[[Jerry Goldsmith]], who scored several episodes of the original series, composed the music for the movie and re-recorded [[Marius Constant]]'s series theme. The original soundtrack album was released by [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| total_length    = 45:01\n| extra_column    = Vocals\n| title1          = ''Twilight Zone'' Main Title\n| music1          = [[Marius Constant]]\n| length1         = 0:42\n| title2          = Overture\n| music2          = [[Jerry Goldsmith]]\n| length2         = 5:13\n| title3          = Time Out\n| music3          = Goldsmith\n| length3         = 6:45\n| title4          = Kick the Can\n| music4          = Goldsmith\n| length4         = 10:12\n| title5          = [[Nights Are Forever (Jennifer Warnes song)|Nights Are Forever]]\n| writer5         = Goldsmith\n| lyrics5         = John Bettis\n| extra5          = [[Jennifer Warnes]]\n| length5         = 3:39\n| title6          = It's a Good Life\n| music6          = Goldsmith\n| length6         = 10:52\n| title7          = Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\n| music7          = Goldsmith\n| length7         = 6:53\n| title8          = ''Twilight Zone'' End Title\n| music8          = Constant\n| length8         = 0:45\n}}\nSegment 1 is the only segment whose music is not included in the overture (actually the film's end title music).\n\nA complete recording of the dramatic score, including a previously-unreleased song by [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]], was released in April 2009 by ''[[Film Score Monthly]]'', representing the soundtrack's first US release on Compact Disc. Both songs were used in Segment 1 and were produced by [[Bruce Botnick]] with [[James Newton Howard]] (Howard also arranged \"Nights Are Forever\").
