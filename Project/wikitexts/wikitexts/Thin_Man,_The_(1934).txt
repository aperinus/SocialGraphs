S. Van Dyke]] and based on the 1934 [[The Thin Man|novel of the same name]] by [[Dashiell Hammett]]. The film stars [[William Powell]] and [[Myrna Loy]] as [[Nick and Nora Charles]], a leisure-class couple who enjoy copious drinking and flirtatious banter. Nick is a retired private detective who left his very successful career when he married Nora, a wealthy heiress accustomed to high society. Their [[Fox Terrier (Wire)|wire-haired fox terrier]] Asta was played by canine actor [[Skippy (dog)|Skippy]]. In 1997, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] having been deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by [[Albert Hackett]] and [[Frances Goodrich]], a married couple. In 1934, the film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. The titular \"Thin Man\" is not Nick Charles, but the man Charles is initially hired to find \u2013 Clyde Wynant (part way through the film, Charles describes Wynant as a \"thin man with white hair\"). The \"Thin Man\" moniker was thought by many viewers to refer to Nick Charles and, after a time, it was used in the titles of sequels as if referring to Charles.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Thin-Man-Powell-Loy-Asta-American.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Powell]], [[Myrna Loy]] and [[Skippy (dog)|Skippy]] (Asta) in ''The Thin Man'']]\nDorothy Wynant discusses with her father Clyde about her upcoming wedding. She discusses the fact with her father that her fiance knows all about her family yet still wants to marry her. Later, her father discovers that his $50,000 bonds are missing. They were supposed to be a wedding present for his daughter. They were left in his safe. The only other person who knows the combination of the safe would be his secretary, Julia. He confronts Julia about his missing bonds. She confesses that she cashed them in and has only $25,000 left. He threatens to call the police unless she comes up with the rest of the $25,000.\n\nNick Charles is a retired detective and former client of Clyde's. Nick and his wealthy wife, Nora, live in San Francisco but are visiting [[New York City]] for Christmas, staying in a glamorous apartment-like suite at the Hotel Normandie. While in New York, Nick is pressed back into service by Dorothy, as her father, the \"Thin Man\" of the movie title, was supposed to have left on a secret business trip with a promise to return home before his daughter's wedding, but he has mysteriously disappeared. She convinces Nick to take the case, with the assistance of his socialite wife, who is eager to see him in action again. What appears to be a missing person situation rapidly turns into a murder case, when Julia Wolf, Clyde's former secretary and girlfriend, is found dead, and evidence points to Clyde as the prime suspect. Dorothy refuses to believe that her father is guilty. Nick and Police Lieutenant Guild visit Nunheim, a frequent source for the lieutenant. After being pressed for information, Nunheim excuses himself momentarily, only to slip away down the fire escape. He arranges a meeting with the yet-unidentified murderer (someone whose face is not yet shown) to collect $5,000 from him. When Nunheim arrives, however, he is immediately shot four times and killed.\n\nOn a hunch, Nick soon visits Wynant's closed shop in the dead of night and unearths a skeletonized, but fully dressed, body, buried under the floor. In the dark shop, Wynant's bookkeeper, Tanner, suddenly appears. After that, the police\u2014whom Nick had called once he found the body\u2014arrive and concludes that Wynant committed the murders of Julia and now this newly discovered body. They assume that the remains belong to the \"Fat Man\"\u2014a long-ago enemy of Wynant's\u2014because of its oversized clothing with a belt buckle bearing an \"R,\" that notorious figure's first initial. But Nick has already all but solved the case\u2014and soon invites the full cast of suspects to an elegant dinner party.\n\nThere, as planned, the murderer is exposed. Nick\u2014who had accompanied the medical examiner when he X-rayed the buried body\u2014theorizes that the clothes were planted to hide the body's true identity, as the X-ray revealed telltale shrapnel, presumably from an old war wound, in one leg, the exact same injury that had plagued the \"Thin Man\": the missing Wynant. Nick deduces that the real culprit murdered Clyde once he discovered that the killer had been embezzling from him, and then the culprit murdered his own accomplice, Julia Wolf, because she knew about Clyde's murder, and after that, he murdered Nunheim since he had witnessed Julia's murder and was blackmailing him.\n\nNick unfurls more of his theory to the dinner guests. Herbert MacCauley, Clyde's attorney, panics and tries to shoot Nick. Nick punches him out and declares MacCauley to be the murderer.\n\nFinally, Nick and Nora, along with Dorothy and her new husband, Tommy, celebrate as they ride a luxury train back to California.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Poster - Thin Man, The 02.jpg|thumb|Lobby card]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[William Powell]] as Nick Charles\n* [[Myrna Loy]] as Nora Charles\n* [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] as Dorothy Wynant\n* [[Nat Pendleton]] as Lt.

Hammett's novel drew on his experiences as a union-busting Pinkerton detective in Butte, Montana. Hammett based Nick and Nora's banter upon his rocky on-again, off-again relationship with playwright [[Lillian Hellman]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0620.html |title=Obituary: Lillian Hellman, Playwright, Author, and Rebel, Dies at 77 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 1, 1984 |access-date=July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nMGM paid Hammett $21,000 for the screen rights to the novel. The screenplay was written by [[Albert Hackett]] and [[Frances Goodrich]], who had been married for three years. Director [[W.S. Van Dyke]] encouraged them to use Hammett's writing as a basis only, and to concentrate on providing witty exchanges for Nick and Nora.\n\n===Casting===\nVan Dyke convinced MGM executives to let Powell and Loy portray the lead characters despite concerns that Powell was too old and strait-laced to play Nick Charles and that Loy had become typecast in exotic [[femme fatale]] roles.<ref name=\"bryant\">{{cite book \n|last=Bryant|first=Roger|date=2006|title=William Powell: The Life and Films|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|publisher=McFarland & Company|pages=4, 10|isbn=9780786454938}}</ref><ref name=\"tcm\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2737/the-thin-man#overview|title=The Thin Man|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=January 1, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Skippy (dog)|Skippy]] played Asta, the dog of Nick and Nora. Skippy was subsequently cast in two screwball comedy classics, ''[[The Awful Truth]]'' (1937) and ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938).\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Thin-Man-Loy-Powell-Skippy.jpg|thumb|Myrna Loy, William Powell and Skippy]]\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=cornsilk|align=left|fontsize=101%|salign=right|quote=[Nick and Nora were the] first on-screen Hollywood couple for whom matrimony did not signal the end of sex, romance and adventure.|source=&ndash;Film historian [[Andrew Sarris]] (1998)<ref>[[Andrew Sarris|Sarris, Andrew]] (1998) ''\"You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet\": The American Talking Film History and Memory, 1927-1949''. New York: Oxford University Press.  p.419 {{ISBN|0-19-513426-5}}</ref>}}\n\nThe film was shot with a budget of $226,408 by cinematographer [[James Wong Howe]]. For Powell's first scene in the film, Van Dyke told him to take the cocktail shaker, go to the bar and just walk through the scene while the crew checked lights and sound. Powell did it, throwing in some lines and business of his own. Suddenly he heard Van Dyke say, \"That's it! Print it!\" The director had decided to shoot the scene without Powell knowing it so that he would be as relaxed and natural as possible.\n\nVan Dyke often did not bother with cover shots if he felt the scene was right on the first take, reasoning that actors \"lose their fire\" if they have to do something over and over. It was a lot of pressure on the actors, who often had to learn new lines and business immediately before shooting, without the luxury of retakes, but Loy credited much of the appeal of the film to Van Dyke's pacing and spontaneity. He paid the most attention to Powell and Loy's easy banter between takes and their obvious enjoyment of each other's company and worked it into the movie. The director often encouraged and incorporated improvisation and off-the-cuff details into the picture. In order to keep her entrance fresh and spontaneous, Van Dyke did not tell Loy about it until right before they shot it.\n\nPowell loved working so much with Loy because of her naturalness, her professionalism, and her lack of any kind of \"diva\" temperament. Of her, Powell said: \n<blockquote>\nWhen we did a scene together, we forgot about technique, camera angles, and microphones. We weren't acting. We were just two people in perfect harmony. Myrna, unlike some actresses who think only of themselves, has the happy faculty of being able to listen while the other fellow says his lines. She has the give and takes of acting that brings out the best.\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Loy, the actors were not allowed to interact between takes with the dog Skippy; trainers felt it would break his concentration. Skippy once bit Loy during filming.<ref name=\"Being and Becoming\">{{cite book |last1=Kotsilibas-Davis |first1=James |last2=Loy |first2=Myrna |author-link2=Myrna Loy |date=1987 |title=Myrna Loy: Being and Becoming |url=https://archive.org/details/myrnaloybeingbec00kots |location=New York |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |isbn=9780394555935 |url-access=registration }}</ref>{{Rp|91}}\n\nAlthough she had great compliments for Powell's charm and wit, [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] (who played the daughter of Wynant) later said she did not enjoy making the picture because her part was so small and the production was so rushed.\n\nThe scene of Nick shooting the ornaments off the tree was added after Powell playfully picked up an air gun and started shooting ornaments the art department was putting up.\n\nLoy wrote that the biggest problem during shooting was the climactic dinner party scene in which Nick reveals the killer. Powell complained that he had too many lines to learn and could barely decipher the complicated plot he was unraveling. It was the one scene when several retakes were necessary, which brought up an entirely new problem. The script called for oysters to be served to the dinner guests and, in take after take, the same plate of oysters was brought out under the hot lights. \"They began to putrefy,\" Loy recalled. \"By the time we finished that scene, nobody ever wanted to see another oyster.\"<ref name=\"Being and Becoming\"/>{{Rp|89\u201390}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was released on May 25, 1934, to overwhelmingly positive reviews, with special praise for the chemistry between Loy and Powell.
