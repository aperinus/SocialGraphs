Ruddy]], and starring [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Ed Lauter]], and [[Michael Conrad|Mike Conrad]]. The film follows a former NFL player recruiting a group of prisoners and playing [[gridiron football|football]] against their guards. It features many real-life football players, including [[Green Bay Packers]] legend [[Ray Nitschke]].<ref>{{citation|title=Football And American Identity |author=Gerhard Falk|year= 2005|publisher=Haworth Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=n2ozWrCGYtoC&q=%22The+Longest+Yard%22&pg=PA172|isbn=978-0-7890-2527-2}}</ref>\n\nThe film has been remade three times: as the 2001 British film ''[[Mean Machine (film)|Mean Machine]]'' (a shortened version of the title used for the original's UK release), starring [[Vinnie Jones]], the 2005 film remake, ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' featuring [[Adam Sandler]] and Reynolds as coach Nate Scarborough, and as the 2015 Egyptian film ''[[:ar:\u0643\u0627\u0628\u062a\u0646 \u0645\u0635\u0631 (\u0641\u064a\u0644\u0645)|Captain Masr]]''. In the two international remakes from 2001 and 2015, the sport was changed from gridiron football to [[association football]].\n\n==Plot==\nFormer star pro football [[quarterback]] Paul \"Wrecking\" Crewe walks out on his wealthy girlfriend Melissa in [[Palm Beach, Florida]]. After taking her Maserati-engined [[Citro\u00ebn SM]] without permission and leading police on a car chase, Crewe is sentenced to 18 months in [[Georgia State Prison|Citrus State Prison]].\n\nThe convicts disrespect Crewe because he was dismissed from the [[National Football League|NFL]] for [[point shaving]]. The [[Prison warden|warden]], Rudolph Hazen, is a football fanatic who manages a semi-pro team of prison guards. He wants Crewe to help coach the team and clinch a championship. Responding to pressure from the head guard and coach, Captain Wilhelm Knauer, a reluctant Crewe eventually agrees to play in an exhibition game. Crewe forms a prison team that includes Samson, a former professional weightlifter, and Connie Shokner, a killer and martial arts expert.\n\nAided by the clever Caretaker, former professional player Nate Scarboro and the first black inmate willing to play, \"Granny\" Granville, plus long-term prisoner Pop\u2014and the warden's amorous secretary, Miss Toot\u2014Crewe molds a team nicknamed the \"Mean Machine\". He agrees to play quarterback himself. After witnessing \"Granny\" being harassed by some of the prison guards without breaking, the black inmates decide to volunteer their services and join the team. Unger, one of the prison trustees, persistently asks Crewe if he can replace Caretaker as manager of the team, which Crewe refuses to do. In retaliation, Unger attempts to kill Crewe by fashioning a homemade bomb from a light bulb filled with a combustible fluid, designed to detonate inside Crewe's cell when he turns on the light. Caretaker is killed instead when he enters Crewe's cell to retrieve some papers; Unger locks the cell door, preventing rescue. Hazen sternly lectures Crewe's teammates about the consequences of any attempted escape after the game. Afterward, Crewe re-energizes the team with a surprise - presenting them with professional uniforms (stolen from the guards by Caretaker before he was killed). They charge onto the field in their new uniforms, angering the guards and Hazen.\n\nThe \"Mean Machine\" starts out well, and at halftime the game is close: the guards lead 15-13. Hazen threatens Crewe as an accessory to Caretaker's murder unless Crewe loses the game to the guards by at least 21 points. Crewe reluctantly agrees, but only if Hazen promises not to hurt the other prisoners; Hazen agrees, but in bad faith, and tells Knauer to have his team \"inflict as much physical punishment on the prisoners as humanly possible\" as soon as they are ahead by 21 points. Crewe makes deliberate mistakes, putting the \"Mean Machine\" down by more than three touchdowns, 35-13, then takes himself out of the game. The guards gladly injure several of the prisoners, and Crewe's teammates feel betrayed.\n\nDepressed, Crewe goes back into the game, but the prisoners refuse to cooperate with him until he convinces them of his change of heart. The \"Mean Machine\" gets back into the game, trailing 35-30, one of their touchdowns scored by Nate despite his bad knee, and he is immediately cut down and crippled by guard Bogdanski. As he is wheeled off the field, Nate tells Crewe to \"screw Hazen\" and win the game. Crewe scores the winning touchdown with no time left and the \"Mean Machine\" wins, 36-35.\n\nAs the prisoners celebrate, Crewe walks across the field towards the departing crowds. Hazen repeatedly orders Knauer to shoot him because he thinks Crewe is trying to escape. Knauer hesitates due to his newfound respect for Crewe, who is actually retrieving a football. Disgusted at what he almost did, Knauer hands the rifle back to Hazen saying, \"Game ball.\" Crewe returns to the crestfallen Hazen with the ball telling him, \"Stick this in your trophy case.\" Crewe walks into the stadium tunnel with Pop who says \"I knew you could do it!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Paul \"Wrecking\" Crewe\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Warden Rudolph Hazen\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as Captain Wilhelm Knauer\n* [[Michael Conrad]] as Nate Scarboro\n* [[James Hampton (actor)|James Hampton]] as James \"Caretaker\" Farrell \n* [[Little Caesar (singer)|Harry Caesar]] as \"Granny\" Granville\n* [[John Steadman (actor)|John Steadman]] as \"Pop\"\n* [[Charles Tyner]] as Unger\n* [[Mike Henry (football)|Mike Henry]] as Rasmussen\n* [[Jim Nicholson (offensive lineman)|Jim Nicholson]] as \"Ice Man\"\n* [[Bernadette Peters]] as Miss Toot\n* [[Pepper Martin (actor)|Pepper Martin]] as Shop Steward\n* [[Robert Tessier]] as Connie Shokner\n* [[Richard Kiel]] as Samson (as Dick Kiel)\n* [[Anitra Ford]] as Melissa\n* [[Ray Nitschke]] as Bogdanski\n* George Jones as George \"Big George\"\n* [[Joe Kapp]] as Walking Boss\n* [[Pervis Atkins]] as Mawabe\n* [[Ernie Wheelwright (running back)|Ernie Wheelwright]] as Spooner\n* [[Sonny Shroyer]] as Tannen\n* [[Ray Ogden]] as Schmidt\n* [[Sonny Sixkiller]] as Indian\n* [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]] as Announcer\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nProducer Albert S. Ruddy wrote the story in the late 1960s. He got [[Tracy Keenan Wynn]], who had written a TV movie about life in prison, ''The Glass House'', to write a script.<ref>{{cite news|first=Barbra|last= Nightingale|title= SELECTED SHORTS DETECTIVE WHO? TOUCHDOWN! Nurse Barbra By A. H. WEILER|newspaper= New York Times|date= 29 Apr 1973|page= 135}}</ref> Wynn signed in June 1972. Finance was raised through Paramount, who released Ruddy's ''The Godfather''.<ref>{{cite news|title=MOVIE CALL SHEET: Miss Marly Set in 'Death'|last=Murphy|first= Mary|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=19 June 1972|page= f10}}</ref> Aldrich says he took the third act of the film from ''Body and Soul'' (1947) a film on which Aldrich had worked as assistant director. He says this consisted of his character falling from grace and trying to redeem himself.  He later did this on ''[[All the Marbles]]''.<ref>MOVIES: ROBERT ALDRICH--NO MORE MR. NICE GUY\nMann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 11 Oct 1981: m25.</ref>\n\nThough the film was billed as being based on an original story, some reviewers found parallels between this film and the 1962 Hungarian film ''[[Two Half Times in Hell]]'', which was based on a real-life association football game in 1942 between German soldiers and Ukrainian prisoners of war during [[World War II]], known as [[the Death Match]].\n\n===Casting===\nA number of the actors had previously played professional football. Henry played for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. Kapp played quarterback for the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and in the Canadian Football League (1959-1966). Nitschke was a [[middle linebacker]] for the [[Green Bay Packers]] who was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1978, four years after release, and Atkins played for the [[Los Angeles Rams]], the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Oakland Raiders]]. Also appearing as prisoners are Wheelwright, who played with the [[New York Giants]], [[Atlanta Falcons]] and the [[New Orleans Saints]], and Ogden, who played with the St. Louis Cardinals, the [[New Orleans Saints]], the [[Atlanta Falcons]] and the [[Chicago Bears]]. Sixkiller was a [[College football|collegiate]] star as a [[quarterback]] for the [[University of Washington]] [[Washington Huskies football|Huskies]] from 1970-1972, and briefly played pro in the defunct World Football League. Reynolds himself had played [[college football]] for [[Florida State University]] before injuries curtailed his career. There were a number of convicts used as players during filming.\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot on location at [[Georgia State Prison]] in [[Reidsville, Georgia]]. The production had the cooperation of then-Governor [[Jimmy Carter]]. Filming had to be delayed from time to time due to prison uprisings. There is now a museum that can be visited by appointment about the film and capital punishment in Georgia located in the prison's former Death Row.\n\nAccording to Reynolds, Aldrich knew comedy was \"not his strong suit\" so they would do a take as written then he would ask for a \"schtick take\" where Reynolds could \"clown around\". Reynolds said the completed film used the schtick scenes about \"65% of the time\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Burt on Burt: Smokey Makes Out Like a Bandit|last= Mann|first= Roderick|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= 7 May 1978|page= f32}}</ref>\n\nOf Reynolds, Aldrich said \"on occasion he's a much better actor than he's given credit for. Not always: sometimes he acts like a caricature of himself. I thought he was very good in ''Longest Yard''.\"<ref>\"I CAN'T GET JIMMY CARTER TO SEE MY MOVIE!\"\nAldrich, Robert.

''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 3, p. 17.</ref> [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated, \"The story is both clever and unsubtle, the action riot-gun fast from start to satisfying finish, the characters vivid and boldly drawn, the jokes set up and paid off with old-pro efficiency: the bone-snapping, billy-club violence (of which there is inevitably a fair amount) is by Aldrich's standards restrained and by any standards allowable.\"<ref>Champlin, Charles (September 25, 1974). \"Cons Vs.
