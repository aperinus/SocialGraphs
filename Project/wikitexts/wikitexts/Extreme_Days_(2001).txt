Their dreams are to participate in many [[extreme sports]], but they are stopped short due to many circumstances.\n\n==Plot==\nFour childhood friends, Will, Brian, Corey, and Matt, have had a dream since they were kids to surf, skate, and snowboard across California. After graduating from junior college, they decide to make the trip, but have to save money first. Through their jobs life-guarding children's swimming pools and working at Turkish restaurants they manage to save $847.53, enough to cross California in their Joyota; a Jeep refitted with a Toyota engine. They decide to go to Mexico where they surf at Larosarita. Corey receives a phone call and is told of the unexpected death of his grandfather, \"Grandpa G.\", who left him an inheritance including a car, which Corey must travel to [[Yakima, Washington]] to pick up. The friends, who all knew Grandpa G., accompany him, counting on being able to pay for the return trip with the inheritance money.\n\nOn the way, the group runs into Matt's beautiful cousin Jessie, who needs a ride to Seattle because her car has broken down. Brian is immediately infatuated with her, but she avoids him, only increasing his desire for her. Corey makes a bet with Brian that he will not be able to get Jessie to do one thing he wants her to do by the end of the trip. As the trip continues, Jessie and Brian get closer, but Jessie has difficulties trusting Brian and his intentions toward her due to past experiences. She knew all along about the bet, but because of her convictions and some harsh words from Brian, she decides to leave, although it hurts her.\n\nIn low spirits, the boys arrive at the home of Grandma G in Washington, only to find that the car Corey has inherited is a junk car. Unable to get home, they are forced to sell the car to get money for the trip home. In a newspaper, Matt sees five tickets to Alaska on sale for $500. With the help of Grandma G, they sell the car online for $1,500.\n\nBrian knows he messed up with Jessie and regrets his behaviour. Hoping to win her back, Brian and the others head to the [[University of Washington]] where she is giving a freshman orientation. Brian apologizes for what he did, telling Jessie he's never known anyone like her and that she woke him up. He asks her to come with them, but she tearfully says that she cannot. Matt gives her a plane ticket before the four friends leave. Brian waits at the airport for Jessie hopefully, but she does not come. As he takes his seat, his phone starts ringing; it is Jessie, who is sitting in the back of the plane.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dante Basco]]- Corey Ng \n* [[Ryan Browning]]- Brian Davidson \n* [[A.J.
