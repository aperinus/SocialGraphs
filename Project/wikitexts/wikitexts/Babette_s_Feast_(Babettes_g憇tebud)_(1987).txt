The screenplay, written by Axel, was based on the 1958 [[Anecdotes of Destiny|story of the same name]] by [[Isak Dinesen]] (Karen Blixen). It was produced by [[Just Betzer]], [[Bo Christensen]] and [[Benni Korzen]], with funding from the [[Danish Film Institute]].\n\n''Babette's Feast'' was the first Danish cinema film of a Blixen story. It was also the first Danish film to win the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Babette's g\u00e6stebud | publisher = Danish Film Institute | url = http://www.dfi.dk/faktaomfilm/nationalfilmografien/nffilm.aspx?id=12}}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered in the ''[[Un Certain Regard]]'' section of the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/458/year/1987.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Babette's Feast |access-date=2009-07-20 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003003410/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/458/year/1987.html |archive-date=2012-10-03 }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe elderly and pious [[Protestant]] sisters Martine ([[Birgitte Federspiel]]) and Filippa ([[Bodil Kjer]]) live in a small village on the remote western coast of [[Jutland]] in 19th-century Denmark. Their late father was a pastor who founded his own [[Pietist]]ic [[conventicle]]. Lacking new converts, the aging sisters preside over a dwindling, but faithful, elderly congregation.\n\nThe story flashes back 49 years, showing the sisters in their youthful loveliness. They have many suitors, but their father rejects them, as he selfishly wishes to retain the assistance of the young women to further his pastoral mission. Martine is courted by an impassioned young [[Swedish cavalry]] officer, Lorens L\u00f6wenhielm, who is visiting Jutland. Filippa is courted by a famous [[baritone]], Achille Papin, from the [[Paris Opera]], on hiatus to enjoy the silence of the coast. Both sisters decide to spurn their suitors and stay with their father.\n\nThirty-five years later, Babette Hersant ([[St\u00e9phane Audran]]) appears at their door. She carries a letter from Papin, who in it explains that she is a refugee from [[Paris Commune|counter-revolutionary bloodshed in Paris]] and recommends her as a housekeeper. The sisters cannot afford to employ Babette, but she begs to work for free. Babette serves as their cook for the next 14 years, producing improved versions of the bland meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation and slowly gaining their respect, and that of the other local inhabitants. As the years go by, the sisters are deeply distressed by the increasing number of querulous arguments between the congregants. Babette is also troubled, and at one point, interrupts the arguments with a stern rebuke.\n\nBabette's only link to her former life is a [[lottery]] ticket. A Parisian friend annually renews the ticket. One day, she wins the lottery and receives 10,000 francs. After her win she decides to prepare a delicious dinner for the sisters and their small congregation on the occasion of the founding pastor's hundredth birthday. More than just a feast, the meal is an outpouring of Babette's appreciation, an act of self-sacrifice.\n\nThe sisters accept both Babette's meal and her offer to pay for the creation of a \"real [[cuisine of France|French dinner]]\". Babette arranges for her nephew to go to Paris and gather the supplies for the feast. The ingredients are plentiful, sumptuous and exotic, and their arrival causes much consternation and discussion among the villagers. As the various never-before-seen ingredients arrive and preparations commence, the sisters begin to worry that the meal will become a sin of sensual luxury, if not some form of devilry. In a hasty conference, the sisters and the congregation agree to eat the meal, but to forgo speaking of any pleasure in it and to make no mention of the food during the dinner.\n\nMartine's former suitor, Lorens, now a famous general married to a member of the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Queen's court]], comes as the guest of his aunt, the local lady of the manor and a member of the old pastor's congregation. He is unaware of the other guests' austere plans and as a man of the world and former [[attach\u00e9]] in Paris, he is the only person at the table qualified to comment on the meal. He regales the guests with abundant information about the extraordinary food and drink, comparing it to a meal he enjoyed years earlier at the famous [[Caf\u00e9 Anglais]] in Paris. Although the other celebrants refuse to comment on the earthly pleasures of their meal, Babette's gifts break down their distrust and superstitions, elevating them physically and spiritually. Old wrongs are forgiven, ancient loves are rekindled and a mystical redemption of the human spirit settles over the table.\n\nBereft, the sisters assume that Babette will return to Paris. However, when she tells them that all of her money is gone and that she is not going anywhere, the sisters are aghast. Babette then reveals that she was formerly the head chef of the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, where a dinner for 12 cost 10,000 francs. Martine tearfully says, \"Now you will be poor the rest of your life\", to which Babette replies, \"An artist is never poor.\"  Filippa then says: \"But this is not the end, Babette. In paradise you will be the great artist God meant you to be\" and then embraces her with tears in her eyes saying: \"Oh, how you will enchant the angels!\", which is precisely how the short story ends.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[St\u00e9phane Audran]] as Babette Hersant\n* [[Bodil Kjer]] as Filippa (old)\n* [[Birgitte Federspiel]] as Martine (old)\n* [[Jarl Kulle]] as General Lorens L\u00f6wenhielm (old)\n* [[Jean-Philippe Lafont]] as Achille Papin\n* [[Vibeke Hastrup]] as Martine (young)\n* Hanne Stensgaard as Filippa (young)\n* [[Tina Kiberg]] as Filippa (singing voice)\n* Gudmar Wivesson as Lorens (young)\n* [[Bibi Andersson]] as Swedish courtier\n* [[Pouel Kern]] as the pastor, the father\n* [[Bendt Rothe]] as Nielsen, parishioner\n* Cay Kristiansen as Poul, parishioner\n* [[Lisbeth Movin]] as the Widow, parishioner\n* [[Preben Lerdorff Rye]] as the Captain, parishioner \n* [[Ebbe Rode]] as Christopher, parishioner\n* [[Else Petersen]] as Solveig, parishioner\n* Asta Esper Andersen as Anna, parishioner\n* [[Holger Perfort]] as Karlsen, parishioner\n* Ebba With as L\u00f6wenhielm's aunt\n* [[Axel Str\u00f8bye]] as L\u00f6wenhielm's coachman\n* Finn Nielsen as grocery store owner\n* [[Ghita N\u00f8rby]] as Narrator (voice)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nBlixen's original story takes place in the Norwegian port town of [[Berlev\u00e5g]], albeit in an inaccurate setting of multicolored wood houses on a long fjord.<ref>Karen Blixen, ''Anecdotes of Destiny and Ehrengard'', \"The Diver,\" \"Babette's Feast,\" \"Tempests,\" \"The Immortal Story,\" \"The Ring\" (New York: Random House; London: Michael Joseph, 1958); Sk\u00e6bne-Anekdoter (Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1960)</ref> However, when Axel researched locations in Norway, he found the settings were too idyllic and resembled a \"beautiful tourist brochure\".<ref name=\"M\u00f8rch\">M\u00f8rch, Karin, ''Gabriel's G\u00e6stebud: Portrait af en Filmmager'', Copenhagen: Gyldendal, (2008) p.403</ref> He shifted the location to the flat windswept coast of western [[Jutland]] and asked his set designer, Sven Wichmann, to build a small grey village offering very few or no attractions.

However, Axel wanted Danish, Swedish and French actors to play the roles for the sake of authenticity. Axel was supported by the [[Danish Film Institute]]'s consultant, Claes Kastholm Hansen, who also agreed the cast should include international stars.<ref name=\"M\u00f8rch 2008 410\">{{Harv| M\u00f8rch|2008|p=410}}</ref>\nThe title character of Babette was initially offered to [[Catherine Deneuve]]. Deneuve was interested in the part but was concerned because she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual \u2018sophisticated woman\u2019 roles.<ref name=\"M\u00f8rch 2008 410\" /> While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress [[St\u00e9phane Audran]]. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in [[Claude Chabrol]]'s films ''[[Violette Nozi\u00e8re]]'' (1978) and ''[[Chicken with Vinegar|Poulet au vinaigre]]'' (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran's suitability, Chabrol said Audran was the archetype of Babette.<ref>{{Harv| M\u00f8rch|2008|p=411}}</ref> Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and asked her if she might be able to respond before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said she wanted the role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast.<ref>{{Harv| M\u00f8rch|2008|p=412}}</ref>\n\nTwo other major parts were the characters of the elderly maiden sisters, Phillipa and Martine. Phillipa, the once-promising singer, was portrayed by [[Bodil Kjer]], considered the first lady of Danish theater and namesake of the [[Bodil Award]].<ref>Piil, Morten, ''Bodil Kjer'' Danske Filmskuespillere, Gyldendal, (2001), pp 230\u2013235</ref> [[Birgitte Federspiel]], best known for Carl Dreyer's 1955 classic film ''[[Ordet]]'', was cast as the staid, lovelorn Martine.\n\nThe role of the Swedish General Lorens L\u00f6wenhielm, the former suitor of Martine, was accepted by [[Jarl Kulle]] and the Swedish Court Lady by [[Bibi Andersson]]. Both had achieved international recognition as two of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s favorite actors, appearing in many of his films.<ref>[http://www.ingmarbergman.se/universe.asp?guid=895A97B2-15CA-4740-8B14-890E85FF5CA8 \"Jarl Kulle\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007095518/http://www.ingmarbergman.se/universe.asp?guid=895A97B2-15CA-4740-8B14-890E85FF5CA8 |date=2009-10-07 }}, Filmography, Ingmar Bergman Foundation, ingmarbergman.se, retrieved 28-05-2009</ref><ref>[http://www.ingmarbergman.se/universe.asp?guid=F37A6950-3B08-4452-AFB5-5260A3A6DCC5 \"Bibi Andersson\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007093227/http://www.ingmarbergman.se/universe.asp?guid=F37A6950-3B08-4452-AFB5-5260A3A6DCC5 |date=2009-10-07 }}, Filmography, Ingmar Bergman Foundation, ingmarbergman.se, retrieved 28-05-2009</ref>\n\nThe group of elderly villagers was composed of Danish actors, many of whom were well known for their roles in the films of [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]]. These included [[Lisbeth Movin]] as the Old Widow, [[Preben Lerdorff Rye]] as the Captain, [[Axel Str\u00f8bye]] as the Driver, [[Bendt Rothe]] as Old Nielsen and [[Ebbe Rode]] as Christopher.\n\nThe popular Danish actress [[Ghita N\u00f8rby]] was cast as the film's narrator. Although production consultants complained to Axel that the use of a narrator was too old-fashioned, Axel was adamant about using one.
