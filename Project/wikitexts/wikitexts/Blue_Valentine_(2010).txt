Cianfrance, Cami Delavigne, and Joey Curtis wrote the film, and the band [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]] scored it. ''Blue Valentine'' depicts a married couple, played by [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Ryan Gosling]], shifting back and forth in time between their courtship and the dissolution of their marriage several years later.\n\nThe film received critical acclaim and Williams was nominated for both the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], while Gosling received a nomination for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{hatnote|The film is presented in a [[nonlinear narrative]], jumping between the beginning of Dean and Cindy's relationship and their marriage several years later. The following is a linear summary of the plot.}}\n\nDean is a hopeless-romantic high-school [[dropping out|dropout]], working for a moving company in [[Brooklyn]]. Cindy is an aspiring doctor studying pre-med while living with her bickering parents and caring for her grandmother in [[Pennsylvania]]. She is dating a fellow student named Bobby and one day, the two have intercourse where he ejaculates inside her without her consent. This causes an angered Cindy to break up with him. Some time later, while Dean is delivering furniture to a nursing home in Pennsylvania, he runs into Cindy, who is visiting her grandmother. He gives her his number but she never calls; however, they coincidentally meet again on a bus and begin dating shortly afterwards. After discovering their relationship, a jealous Bobby violently assaults Dean. Cindy finds out she is [[pregnant]] and tells Dean he is unlikely to be the father. She opts for an [[abortion]] but changes her mind during the procedure. Dean then comforts and reassures her that they can raise the child together. Cindy and Dean soon get married.\n\nFive years later, the couple lives in rural Pennsylvania with their daughter, Frankie, and family dog, Megan. Cindy is now a nurse at a clinic where her boss, Dr. Feinberg, had just offered her to join him at his new clinic in the near future. Meanwhile, Dean, unambitious and struggling with alcohol, paints houses for a living. After having gone missing due to Cindy leaving a gate unlocked, Megan is found dead by the roadside which further strains the couple's marriage. Despite Cindy's reluctance, Dean insists on a romantic getaway at a motel to relax and rekindle their relationship. Stopping by a liquor store, Cindy has an awkward encounter with Bobby, which causes an ensuing argument in the car between her and Dean.\n\nAt the motel, Dean repeatedly tries to seduce Cindy but she rebuffs him. Frustrated with Dean's lack of ambition, she questions him during dinner which leads to another argument. The two make up and get [[alcohol poisoning|drunk]] but Cindy is displeased when Dean asks if she wants to have another child with him. They start fighting again and she locks him outside the bedroom. Early in the morning, Cindy is unexpectedly called in for work. She takes the car and leaves a note for Dean. At the clinic, Dr. Feinberg recommends that Cindy get an apartment near the new clinic instead of moving her family, suggesting that they could keep each other company if she is lonely which visibly upsets Cindy.\n\nBack at the motel, an annoyed Dean finds the note and shows up drunk at the clinic where he has another heated argument with Cindy. Dean punches Dr. Feinberg when he tries to intervene who then fires Cindy and kicks them both out. While leaving, Cindy demands a [[divorce]] making Dean throw away his wedding ring but they both attempt to look for it later. Back at her parents' house, Dean tries to persuade Cindy to give the marriage another chance for Frankie. Cindy says she doesn't want Frankie to grow up with parents who despise each other like she did. After Dean reminds Cindy of their vows, they both apologize and hug but she pulls away. Dean leaves the house while Frankie runs after him and begs him to stay. He tricks her to return to Cindy and then, continues walking away. The film ends with photos of Dean and Cindy in the early stages of their romance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Dean Pereira\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Cynthia \u201cCindy\u201d Heller\n* Faith Wladyka as Frances \"Frankie\" Pereira\n* [[John Doman]] as Jerry Heller\n* [[Mike Vogel]] as Bobby Ontario\n* Marshall Johnson as Marshall\n* Jen Jones as Gramma\n* [[Ben Shenkman]] as Dr. Feinberg\n* [[Maryann Plunkett]] as Glenda\n\n==Production==\nWilliams was 21 when she received the script in 2002 and Gosling committed to the production four years later, but filming did not begin until 2009, when Williams was 28 (as was Gosling), owing to Cianfrance's inability to find financing. The director was also unable to film the \"young\" and \"older\" scenes several years apart as he had hoped, again due to lack of money.{{r|riley20101208}} The film was to be shot in [[California]] but production was moved to [[Brooklyn, New York]] and [[Honesdale, Pennsylvania]].
