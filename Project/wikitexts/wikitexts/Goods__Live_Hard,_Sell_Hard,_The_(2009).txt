The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and grossed $15.3 million against a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nBen Selleck's car dealership, in [[Temecula, California]], is failing, so he hires a mercenary, Don Ready. They have 211 cars to sell over the [[4th of July]] weekend. Don's team of Babs, Jibby, and Brent promise him they will make the dealership a profit over the weekend.\n\nOn the first day the crowds gather for hot dogs and other gimmicks. Don notices that the naturally talented salesman, Blake, could be his son (he was there once before and had a brief fling). The sales team sells the cars by any means necessary and finish the day selling 71 cars.\n\nBefore they can leave the lot, Stu Harding and his son Paxton from the opposing dealership offer to purchase the lot. As Paxton is marrying Ben's daughter, Ivy, he is trying to put his future father-in-law out of business. Paxton only wants practice space for his \"man-band\", Big Ups, and eventually wants to take them worldwide. Ben almost finalizes a deal with Stu but Don promises to sell every car on the lot.\n\nThe second day starts off poorly with a dishonest commercial that Ben is dying of [[testicular cancer]]. When it is time for Eric Bice, [[Bo Bice]]'s brother, to take the stage, he backs out at the last minute, and Don takes the stage. The crowd riots when they find out Don is an atrocious singer. Taking advantage of all the cameras on the lot from the riot, the team starts a sale for 20% off to the police.\n\nDon is taking stock in his life when Ivy questions him about one of his jobs in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]. He tells her he killed his best friend and team DJ, McDermott (played in a flashback by [[Will Ferrell]]), by giving him a bag with [[sex toys]] instead of a parachute. Don was more focused on having sex with his customer than selling cars. He then reveals to Ivy that he is falling for her and it is all happening again. That night she comes to Don's hotel room and they have sex.\n\nIvy reveals that it was a one-night stand and is not breaking up with Paxton. Don is upset and storms out yelling that he only trusts cars after what he's been done by Ivy. The team searches but cannot find Don, they get pumped up to sell the 105 cars left on the lot without him. While wandering the desert Don sees the deceased McDermott with two angels. McDermott tells him that everything is about the team, people you love, and that he should get off the road and settle down. In the time it takes Don to get back to the dealership the team has sold every car on the lot.\n\nDon parachutes onto the lot but Stu and Paxton inform him the \"bandit car\" (an expensive prop that was used in the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' films) is not sold, so the dealership is theirs. Don convinces Paxton to buy it, which saves the lot, and Paxton leaves Ivy to tour with his band. Don announces that he is going to get off the road so he can care for his friends and family more. Don marries Ivy and adopts Blake (despite the fact that Blake knows he is not, in fact, his son) but they get divorced two years later. Neither Don nor Ivy wants custody of Blake after the divorce.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Don \"The Goods\" Ready / \"Big Boy Donnie\"\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as \"Jibby\" Newsome\n* [[James Brolin]] as Ben Selleck\n* [[David Koechner]] as Brent Gage\n* [[Kathryn Hahn]] as Babs Merrick\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Paxton Harding   \n* [[Jordana Spiro]] as Ivy Selleck\n* [[Tony Hale]] as Wade Zooha\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Teddy Dang\n* [[Rob Riggle]] as Peter Selleck\n* [[Alan Thicke]] as Stu Harding\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as Dick Lewiston\n* [[Jonathan Sadowski]] as Blake\n* [[Noureen DeWulf]] as Heather\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Tammy Selleck\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as D.J.
