A sequel, ''[[Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters]]'', was released on August 7, 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the top of the [[Empire State Building]], [[Zeus]] meets [[Poseidon]], accusing Poseidon's [[demigod]] son, [[Percy Jackson]], of stealing Zeus' master lightning bolt. Poseidon reminds his brother that Percy is unaware of his true identity, but Zeus declares that unless the bolt is returned to [[Mount Olympus]] before midnight of the [[Summer Solstice]], in two weeks, war will be waged between all the gods.\n\nSixteen-year-old<!-- Please DON'T change Percy's age --> Percy struggles with [[dyslexia]] and [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], but has a unique ability to stay underwater for long periods of time. On a school trip, Percy is attacked by [[Alecto]], a [[Erinyes|Fury]] masquerading as his substitute English teacher, who demands the lightning bolt. Percy's best friend [[List of Camp Half-Blood characters#Grover Underwood|Grover Underwood]] and his [[Latin]] teacher Mr. Brunner help scare off Alecto. Mr. Brunner gives Percy a pen which he claims is a very powerful cosmic weapon, and instructs Grover to take Percy and his mother Sally to Camp Half-Blood \u2014 a hidden [[summer camp]] for demigod children on [[Long Island]], leaving behind Sally's abusive husband, Gabe Ugliano. There, they are attacked by the [[Minotaur]], who seemingly kills Percy's mother. Percy discovers that Mr. Brunner's pen is a magical sword, and uses to fight off the Minotaur, killing it with its own horn.\n\nWaking up three days later, Percy learns he is the son of Poseidon, Grover is a [[satyr]] and Percy\u2019s protector, and \"Mr. Brunner\" is [[Chiron]], a [[centaur]]. Percy starts coming into his latent demigod powers, which include [[hydrokinesis]] and [[healing]], and meets other demigods, including [[List of Camp Half-Blood characters#Annabeth Chase|Annabeth Chase]], daughter of [[Athena]]; and the camp's leader [[List of Camp Half-Blood characters#Luke Castellan|Luke Castellan]], son of [[Hermes]]. Percy is visited by an apparition of [[Hades]], who reveals that the Minotaur abducted Sally to the [[Underworld]] to trade for the lightning bolt. Defying Chiron's orders, Percy sets out for the Underworld with Grover and Annabeth. Luke gives Percy a map with the location of three green [[pearl]]s belonging to Hades' wife, [[Persephone]], which will allow them to escape the Underworld. Percy is also given a pair of flying winged shoes stolen from Hermes, and Luke's favorite [[shield]]. Meanwhile, Percy is declared a [[missing person]].\n\nAt a [[garden centre]] in [[New Jersey]], with help from Grover and Annabeth, Percy manage to decapitate [[Medusa]] and takes the first pearl from her corpse. At the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon in Nashville]], Percy uses the shoes to retrieve the second pearl from the crown of the statue of Athena there, and Grover kills a [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] with Medusa's head. The trio arrive at the Lotus [[Casino hotel|Hotel and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas]] to obtain the third pearl; however, they forget their mission after eating [[lotus flowers]], the effects from which causes them to lose sense of time. Percy snaps out from the spell after hearing the voice of his father, Poseidon, through [[telepathy]] telling him not to eat any more flowers. Percy frees Grover and Annabeth from the flowers' effects; they locate the final pearl in the casino and escape the hotel. Annabeth realizes that they only have one day left to prevent the gods' war, as they were in the casino for five days. They discover that the Underworld is in Hollywood and race there. With all three pearls, Percy, Grover, and Annabeth enter the portal to the Underworld upon arriving in Hollywood.\n\nIn the Underworld, Hades finds the lightning bolt hidden inside Luke's shield, revealing that Luke was the thief all along. Hades tries to kill the trio, but Persephone turns on him in retaliation for imprisoning her, and gives the bolt to Percy. As they only have three pearls, Grover remains behind, while Percy, Annabeth, and Sally teleport to the Empire State Building, the entrance to Mount Olympus. However, before they can enter, they are ambushed by Luke, who reveals that he stole the bolt to demolish Mount Olympus and establish the demigods as new rulers of [[Western world|Western civilization]]. After a battle across [[Manhattan]], Percy seemingly kills Luke, returns the lightning bolt to Zeus, and reconciles with his father Poseidon. Having been reunited with Grover, Percy and Annabeth continue to train.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Sally has kicked Gabe out of her apartment. He returns to get a beer and, upon opening the refrigerator, is turned to stone by Medusa's head.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Percy Jackson & the Olympians cast members}}\n[[File:Logan Lerman at the Apple Store Soho in New York City, July 29, 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Logan Lerman plays the titular character.]]\n* [[Logan Lerman]] as [[Percy Jackson]], the [[demigod]] son of [[Poseidon]]<ref name=\"lead\">{{cite news |first = Tatiana |last = Siegel |title = 'Percy Jackson' finds lead actors |url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000747.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090413104436/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000747.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date = March 2, 2009 |archive-date = April 13, 2009 |url-status = dead |access-date = May 15, 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Brandon T.

In two emails commenting at length on a draft of the script that he posted to his blog in 2018, he specifically warned the studio that trying to make the story more attractive to a teenage audience by aging the characters and including some profanity in the script might move a significant portion of the books' readers to leave the theater in disgust long before the movie ended.
