It features [[Ben Affleck]], [[Kevin Costner]], [[Chris Cooper]] and [[Tommy Lee Jones]].\n\nIt premiered at the [[26th Sundance Film Festival]] on January&nbsp;22, 2010 and had a one-week run in December&nbsp;10, 2010 to be eligible for the year's [[Academy Award]]s. The movie was released commercially in the United States and Canada on January&nbsp;21, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the publicly held [[shipbuilding]] corporation Global Transportation Systems, or GTX, is downsized in the midst of the [[Late 2000s recession|recession]], many employees are fired, including Bobby Walker ([[Ben Affleck]]). Walker is a [[white-collar worker|white-collar]], corporate ladder-climbing employee with a six-figure salary, a wife, and a teenage son and younger daughter.\n\nWalker gets [[outplacement]] services from GTX but, without success, gradually loses luxuries such as his [[country club]] membership and his [[Porsche]]. He finally resorts to selling his expensive house (with a large mortgage) and moves his family in with his parents. Ultimately, Walker is forced to take a [[manual labor]] job working for his [[blue collar|blue-collar]] brother-in-law, Jack Dolan ([[Kevin Costner]]), renovating a home.\n\nExecutive Vice President Gene McClary ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]) challenges GTX CEO James Salinger ([[Craig T. Nelson]]) and his strategy of employee cutbacks, questioning the ethics of spending money to build new corporate headquarters while laying off employees. Angry at being questioned by McClary, his longtime friend, college roommate, and first employee, Salinger asserts that the deep cuts are necessary to increase profits, to increase the stock price and discourage a rumored [[Takeover#Hostile|hostile takeover]] of the company.\n\nLater, it is determined that an additional round of lay-offs is necessary. Senior manager Phil Woodward ([[Chris Cooper]]), who, over the course of 30 years, had risen from the factory floor to the corporate offices (a decidedly rare accomplishment), is also fired. When McClary demands that senior [[Human resources|HR]] manager Sally Wilcox ([[Maria Bello]]), who is also his mistress, rehire Woodward immediately, she tells him that he, too, is being fired. He soon leaves his wife and moves in with Sally.\n\nWoodward's life quickly falls apart as employer after employer tells him he is either too old to start a new career, or too old to do jobs that those half his age find difficult. At his wife's request, Woodward goes out every morning as usual with his briefcase to keep his situation secret from the neighbors, but he cannot do anything to abate his mounting bills or his daughter's impending college tuition bill. Frustrated and depressed, he commits suicide in his garage by carbon-monoxide poisoning.\n\nDespite McClary's anger, he has become even wealthier as a shareholder of the firm because the value of his GTX stock options has increased due to the company's downsizing. Yet he feels guilty about his company ruining so many lives and wants to put people to work. Feeling the need for a change, he starts his own business in maritime shipbuilding, the previous specialty of GTX. Walker is the first person he hires.\n\nWalker arrives at the bare offices to help start a new business composed of many former GTX employees.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Ben Affleck]] as Bobby Walker\n*[[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Gene McClary\n*[[Chris Cooper]] as Phil Woodward\n*[[Kevin Costner]] as Jack Dolan\n*[[Rosemarie DeWitt]] as Maggie Walker\n*[[Maria Bello]] as Sally Wilcox\n*[[Craig T.
