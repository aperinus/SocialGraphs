The three soldiers are played by [[Robert De Niro]], [[Christopher Walken]], and [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]], with [[John Cazale]] (in his final role), [[Meryl Streep]], and [[George Dzundza]] playing supporting roles. The story takes place in [[Clairton, Pennsylvania|Clairton]], [[Pennsylvania]], a [[working-class]] town on the [[Monongahela River]] south of [[Pittsburgh]], and in [[Vietnam]].\n\nThe film was based in part on an unproduced screenplay called ''The Man Who Came to Play'' by [[Louis A. Garfinkle]] and [[Quinn K. Redeker]], about [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Russian roulette]]. Producer [[Michael Deeley]], who bought the script, hired writer/director Michael Cimino who, with [[Deric Washburn]], rewrote the script, taking the Russian roulette element and placing it in the Vietnam War. The film went over-budget and over-schedule, and ended up costing $15 million. [[EMI Films]], who produced the film, released the film internationally while [[Universal Pictures]] handled its distribution in North America.\n\n''The Deer Hunter'' received acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise for Cimino's direction, the performances of its cast (particularly from De Niro, Walken, Cazale, and Streep), and its screenplay, realistic themes and tones, and cinematography. It was also successful at the box office, grossing $49 million. At the [[51st Academy Awards]], it was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], and won five: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Cimino, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Walken, [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. The film marked Meryl Streep's first Academy Award nomination (for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]).\n\nDespite the film's critical acclaim and Academy Award success, some of the industry's most prominent critics derided what they viewed as ''The Deer Hunter'''s simplistic, bigoted, and historically inaccurate depictions of the [[Viet Cong]] and of America's position in the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/26/archives/oscarwinning-deer-hunter-is-under-attack-as-racist-film-among-the.html | title=Oscar\u2010Winning 'Deer Hunter' is Under Attack as 'Racist' Film | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 26, 1979| first=Aljean |last=Harmetz|access-date=October 17, 2022 }}</ref> The central theme of the Viet Cong forcing American captives to play Russian Roulette has been widely criticized as having no basis in history, a claim director Michael Cimino denied but did not refute with documentary evidence.\n\nIt has been featured on lists of the [[List of films considered the best|best films ever made]], such as being named the 53rd-greatest American film of all time by the [[American Film Institute]] in 2007 in their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10th Anniversary Edition]] of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] list.

Mike, Steven and Nick are preparing to leave for military service in [[Vietnam]]. Steven is engaged to Angela, who was secretly impregnated by another man. Mike and Nick are close friends who live together and both love Linda, who will be moving into their home to escape from her abusive, alcoholic father. While dancing at Steven and Angela's wedding, Linda accepts Nick's spontaneous marriage proposal. As the newlyweds drive away, Nick implores a drunk, naked Mike to ensure he returns from Vietnam. Mike, Nick and their friends take a final deer hunt. As per his noble, stoic belief, Mike kills a deer with a single shot.\n\nIn Vietnam in early 1969, Mike, an airborne green beret, is randomly reunited with Nick and Steven in a village, but the trio is overrun and captured by the [[Viet Cong]]. They are imprisoned in a bamboo and wire cage on the [[Khwae Noi River|River Kwai]] and forced to participate in games of [[Russian roulette]] against other prisoners while the jailers bet. Steven, exhausted and filled with fear, fires his round at the ceiling. As punishment, he is left to drown in a separate bamboo \"pit\" with rats and dead bodies. Mike convinces his captors to triple the danger with 3 bullets in the revolver's cylinder instead of just one; Nick and Mike then use the pistol to kill their captors.\n\nMaking their escape, the trio float down the river on a fallen tree trunk. When they reach a suspension bridge, Nick, his leg now shot, is rescued by an American helicopter, but Steven is weak and falls back into the river. Mike drops down to help Steven, while Nick is flown away in the helicopter. Steven's legs are broken in the fall, so Mike carries him until they meet a caravan of refugees fleeing to [[Saigon]]. Nick is treated at a U.S. [[military hospital]]. Once released, Nick, now suffering from [[PTSD]], wanders into Saigon, where he follows gunshots to a gambling den; this reminds him of his capture and torture. French businessman Julien Grinda persuades him to come inside. Upset, Nick interrupts a game of Russian roulette, pulling the trigger on himself. Mike is present as a spectator, but Nick and Julien hurriedly leave.\n\nIn 1970, Mike returns home, but immediately has difficulty reintegrating into civilian life. He fails to appear at a welcome-home party organized by Linda and his friends, opting instead to stay alone overnight in a hotel nearby. He visits Linda the next morning and learns that Nick has deserted. Mike then visits Angela, who is now the mother of a child, but has slipped into catatonia following the return of Steven, who has been rendered an invalid. Stan, Axel and John remained stateside and their distance from Mike is evident, as they seem to understand nothing of war or what Mike has gone through. Linda and Mike find comfort in each other's company. The following days further prove Mike's disorientation; he is unable to shoot a deer during a hunting trip and is outraged when Stan cavalierly threatens Axel with his pistol. To show Stan the gravity of his foolishness, Mike chambers only one round into the 6 wheel, and triggers an empty chamber at Stan's head.\n\nMike visits Steven at a veterans' hospital; both of Steven's legs have been amputated, and he has lost the use of an arm. Steven refuses to come home, saying he no longer fits in.  He tells Mike that he has been regularly receiving large sums of money from Vietnam. Mike intuits that Nick is the source of these payments, and forces Steven home to Angela. Mike returns to Vietnam in search of Nick. Wandering around Saigon, which is now in a state of chaos shortly before [[Fall of Saigon|its fall]], Mike finds Julien and persuades him to take him to the gambling den. Mike finds himself facing Nick, who has become a professional in the macabre game and fails to recognize Mike. Mike attempts to bring Nick back to reason, but Nick, who is now a heroin addict, is indifferent. During a game of Russian roulette, Mike invokes memories of their hunting trips. Nick recalls Mike's \"one shot\" method and smiles before pulling the trigger, killing himself.\n\nMike and his friends attend Nick's funeral, and the atmosphere at their local bar is dim and silent. Moved by emotion, John begins to sing \"[[God Bless America]]\" in honor of Nick, as everyone joins in.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Staff Sergeant Michael Vronsky (\"Mike\").

I ''needed'' someone with the caliber of Robert De Niro.\"<ref name=Deeley-167>Deeley, p. 167</ref> De Niro was one of the biggest stars at that time, coming off ''[[Mean Streets]]'' (1973), ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), and ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976). In addition to attracting buyers, Deeley felt De Niro was \"the right age, apparently tough as hell, and immensely talented.\"<ref name=Deeley-168/>\n\nHiring De Niro turned out to be a casting coup because he knew so many actors in New York. De Niro brought Meryl Streep to the attention of Cimino and Deeley.

Please discuss on talk page] -->\n\n===Development===\nIn 1968, the record company EMI formed a new company called EMI Films, headed by producers Barry Spikings and Michael Deeley.<ref name=Biskind/> Deeley purchased the first draft of a [[spec script]] called ''The Man Who Came to Play'', written by [[Louis A. Garfinkle]] and [[Quinn K. Redeker]], for $19,000.<ref name=Deeley-2/> The spec script was about people who go to Las Vegas to play Russian roulette.<ref name=Biskind/> \"The screenplay had struck me as brilliant,\" wrote Deeley, \"but it wasn't complete. The trick would be to find a way to turn a very clever piece of writing into a practical, realizable film.\"<ref name=Deeley-163>Deeley, p. 163</ref> When the movie was being planned during the mid-1970s, [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] was still a taboo subject with all [[Major film studio#1970s\u20131980s|major Hollywood studios]].<ref name=Deeley-2>Deeley, p. 2</ref> According to producer Michael Deeley, the standard response was \"no American would want to see a picture about Vietnam\".<ref name=Deeley-2/>\n\nAfter consulting various Hollywood agents, Deeley found writer-director Michael Cimino, represented by Stan Kamen at the [[William Morris Endeavor|William Morris Agency]].<ref name=Deeley-163/> Deeley was impressed by Cimino's TV commercial work and crime film ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' (1974).<ref name=Deeley-163/><ref name=Deeley-164>Deeley, p. 164</ref> Cimino was confident that he could further develop the principal characters of ''The Man Who Came to Play'' without losing the essence of the original. After Cimino was hired, he was called into a meeting with Garfinkle and Redeker at the EMI office. According to Deeley, Cimino questioned the need for the Russian roulette element of the script, and Redeker made such a passionate case for it that he ended up literally on his knees. Over the course of further meetings, Cimino and Deeley discussed the work needed at the front of the script, and Cimino believed he could develop the stories of the main characters in the first 20 minutes of the film.<ref name=Deeley-164/>\n\n===Screenplay===\nCimino worked for six weeks with Deric Washburn on the script.<ref name=Realizing>''Realizing The Deer Hunter: An Interview with Michael Cimino''.

According to producer Spikings, Cimino said he wanted to work again with Washburn.<ref name=Biskind/> According to producer Deeley, he only heard from an office rumor that Washburn was contracted by Cimino to work on the script. \"Whether Cimino hired Washburn as his sub-contractor or as a co-writer was constantly being obfuscated,\" wrote Deeley, \"and there were some harsh words between them later on, or so I was told.\"<ref name=Deeley-164/>\n\n====Cimino's claim====\nAccording to Cimino, he would call Washburn while on the road scouting for locations and feed him notes on dialogue and story. Upon reviewing Washburn's draft, Cimino said, \"I came back and read it and I just could not believe what I read. It was like it was written by somebody who was&nbsp;... mentally deranged.\" Cimino confronted Washburn at the Sunset Marquis in LA about the draft, and Washburn supposedly replied that he couldn't take the pressure and had to go home. Cimino then fired Washburn. Cimino later claimed to have written the entire screenplay himself.<ref name=Realizing/> Washburn's response to Cimino's comments was, \"It's all nonsense. It's lies. I didn't have a single drink the entire time I was working on the script.\"<ref name=Biskind/>\n\n====Washburn's claim====\nAccording to Washburn, he and Cimino spent three days together in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write ''The Deer Hunter'' nor do any research. \"I had a month, that was it,\" he explains. \"The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I had to do was watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq.\" When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on ''The Deer Hunter'' who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the [[Sunset Strip]]. He recalls, \"We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month.

The protagonist in the Redeker/Garfinkle script, Merle, was an individual who sustained a bad injury in [[Active duty|active service]] and was damaged psychologically by his violent experiences, but was nevertheless a tough character with strong nerves and guts. Cimino and Washburn's revised script distilled the three aspects of Merle's personality and separated them out into three distinct characters. They became three old friends who grew up in the same small industrial town and worked in the same steel mill, and in due course were drafted together to Vietnam.<ref name=Deeley-166>Deeley, p. 166</ref> In the original script, the roles of Merle (later renamed Mike) and Nick were reversed in the last half of the film.

All scenes were [[Location shooting|shot on location]] (no [[sound stages]]). \"There was discussion about shooting the film on a back lot, but the material demanded more realism,\" says Spikings.<ref name=Biskind/> The cast and crew viewed large amounts of news footage from the war to ensure authenticity. The film was shot over a period of six months. The Clairton scenes comprise footage shot in eight different towns in four states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Ohio.<ref name=Biskind/> The initial budget of the film was $8.5 million.<ref name=Deeley-171>Deeley, p. 171</ref>\n\nMeryl Streep accepted the role of the \"vague, stock girlfriend\", in order to remain for the duration of filming with [[John Cazale]], who had been diagnosed with lung cancer.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|pp=19-21}} De Niro had spotted Streep in her stage production of ''The Cherry Orchard'' and had suggested that she play his girlfriend Linda.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=21}} Before the beginning of principal photography, Deeley had a meeting with the film's appointed [[line producer]] [[Robert Relyea]]. Deeley hired Relyea after meeting him on the set of ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968) and was impressed with his experience. However, Relyea declined the job, refusing to disclose his reason why.<ref name=Deeley-171/> Deeley suspected that Relyea sensed in director Cimino something that would have made production difficult. As a result, Cimino was acting without the day-to-day supervision of a producer.<ref name=Deeley-172>Deeley, p. 172</ref>\n\nBecause Deeley was busy overseeing the production of [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978), he hired John Peverall to oversee Cimino's shoot. Peverall's expertise with budgeting and scheduling made him a natural successor to Relyea, and Peverall knew enough about the picture to be elevated to producer status. \"John is a straightforward Cornishman who had worked his way up to become a production supervisor,\" wrote Deeley, \"and we employed him as EMI's watchman on certain pictures.\"<ref name=Deeley-172/>\n\n===The wedding scenes===\n[[File:StTheodosius.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

The manager figured if the extras did this, not only would the production save time and money, but the gifts would also look more authentic. Once the unit unwrapped and the extras disappeared, the crew discovered to their amusement that the boxes weren't empty but filled with real presents, from china to silverware. \"Who got to keep all these wonderful offerings,\" wrote Deeley \"is a mystery I never quite fathomed.\"<ref name=Deeley-174/>\n\nCimino originally claimed that the wedding scene would take up 21 minutes of screen time. In the end, it took 51 minutes.

The woman who was given the task of casting the extras in Thailand had much difficulty finding a local to play the vicious-looking individual who runs the game. The first actor hired turned out to be incapable of slapping De Niro in the face. The casting agent then found a local Thai man, Somsak Sengvilai, who held a particular dislike of Americans, and so cast him. De Niro suggested that Walken be slapped by one of the guards without any warning. The reaction on Walken's face was genuine. Producer Deeley has said that Cimino shot the brutal Vietcong Russian roulette scenes brilliantly and more efficiently than any other part of the film.<ref name=Deeley-174/><ref name=Deeley-175>Deeley, p. 175</ref>\n\nDe Niro and Savage performed their own stunts in the fall into the river, filming the thirty-foot drop fifteen times in two days. During the helicopter stunt, the skids caught on the rope bridge as the helicopter rose, which threatened to seriously injure De Niro and Savage. The actors gestured and shouted to the crew in the helicopter to warn them. Footage of this is included in the film.<ref name=Savage>''Playing The Deer Hunter: An interview with John Savage''.

Another sequence recreated the 1975 American evacuation of Saigon; Cimino brought the film's composer, Stanley Myers, out to the location to listen to the auto, tank, and jeep horns as the sequence was being photographed.

The central metaphor of the movie is simply a bloody lie.\"<ref name=Biskind/>\n\nCimino countered that his film was not political, polemical, literally accurate, or posturing for any particular point of view.<ref name=Dirks/> Nevertheless, he also claimed he had news clippings from [[Singapore]] that confirm Russian roulette was used during the war, without specifying which article.<ref name=Realizing/>\n\n====Critics' response====\nIn his review, Roger Ebert defended the artistic license of Russian roulette, arguing \"it is the organizing symbol of the film: Anything you can believe about the game, about its deliberately random violence, about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply to the war as a whole. It is a brilliant symbol because, in the context of this story, it makes any ideological statement about the war superfluous.\"<ref name=Ebert/>\n\nFilm critic and biographer David Thomson also agrees that the film works despite the controversy: \"There were complaints that the North Vietnamese had not employed Russian roulette. It was said that the scenes in Saigon were fanciful or imagined. It was also suggested that De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage were too old to have enlisted for Vietnam (Savage, the youngest of the three, was thirty). Three decades later [written in 2008], 'imagination' seems to have stilled those worries&nbsp;... and ''The Deer Hunter'' is one of the great American films.\"<ref>Thomson, David (October 14, 2008).

New York, NY: Random House. p. 209. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26461-9}}.</ref>\n\nIn her review, Pauline Kael wrote \"The Vietcong are treated in the standard inscrutable-evil Oriental style of the Japanese in the Second World War movies&nbsp;... The impression a viewer gets is that if we did some bad things there we did them ruthlessly but impersonally; the Vietcong were cruel and sadistic.\"<ref name=Biskind/>\n\nIn his ''Vanity Fair'' article \"The Vietnam Oscars\", Peter Biskind wrote that the political agenda of ''The Deer Hunter'' was something of a mystery: \"It may have been more a by-product of Hollywood myopia, the demands of the war-film genre, garden-variety American parochialism, and simple ignorance than it was the pre-meditated right-wing road map it seemed to many.\"<ref name=Biskind/>\n\n====Cast and crew response====\nAccording to Christopher Walken, the historical context was not paramount: \"In the making of it, I don't remember anyone ever mentioning Vietnam!\" De Niro added to this sentiment: \"Whether [the film's vision of the war] actually happened or not, it's something you could imagine very easily happening. Maybe it did. I don't know. All's fair in love and war.\" Producer Spikings, while proud of the film, regrets the way the Vietnamese were portrayed. \"I don't think any of us meant it to be exploitive,\" Spikings said. \"But I think we were&nbsp;... ignorant. I can't think of a better word for it. I didn't realize how badly we'd behaved to the Vietnamese people&nbsp;...\"<ref name=Biskind/>\n\nProducer Deeley, on the other hand, was quick to defend Cimino's comments on the nature and motives of the film: \"''The Deer Hunter'' wasn't really 'about' Vietnam. It was something very different. It wasn't about drugs or the collapse of the morale of the soldiers. It was about how individuals respond to pressure: different men reacting quite differently. The film was about three steel workers in extraordinary circumstances. ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' is surreal. ''The Deer Hunter'' is a parable&nbsp;... Men who fight and lose an unworthy war face some obvious and unpalatable choices. They can blame their leaders.. or they can blame themselves. Self-blame has been a great burden for many war veterans. So how does a soldier come to terms with his defeat and yet still retain his self-respect? One way is to present the conquering enemy as so inhuman, and the battle between the good guys (us) and the bad guys (them) so uneven, as to render defeat irrelevant. Inhumanity was the theme of ''The Deer Hunter<nowiki>'</nowiki>s'' portrayal of the North Vietnamese prison guards forcing American POWs to play Russian roulette. The audience's sympathy with prisoners who (quite understandably) cracked thus completes the chain. Accordingly, some veterans who suffered in that war found the Russian roulette a valid allegory.\"<ref name=Deeley-198>Deeley, p. 198</ref>\n\n===Director Cimino's autobiographical intent===\nCimino frequently referred to ''The Deer Hunter'' as a \"personal\" and \"autobiographical\" film, although later investigation by journalists like Tom Buckley of ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' revealed inaccuracies in Cimino's accounts and reported background.<ref name=Deeley-197/>\n\n===Coda of \"God Bless America\"===\nThe final scene in which all the main characters gather and sing \"[[God Bless America]]\" became a subject of heated debate among critics when the film was released. It raised the question of whether this conclusion was meant ironically or not \u2013 \"as a critique of patriotism or a paean to it\".<ref name=Biskind/>\n\n==Reception==\nUpon its release, ''The Deer Hunter'' received acclaim from critics, who considered it the best American epic since [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]''.<ref name=S&E-Oscar>Ebert, Roger & Siskel, Gene (hosts); Flaum, Thea & Solley, Ray (producers); Denny, Patterson (director).

Other communist states also voiced their solidarity with the \"heroic people of Vietnam\". They protested against the screening of the film and insisted that it violated the statutes of the festival because it in no way contributed to the \"improvement of mutual understanding between the peoples of the world\".

Both Ebert and Siskel correctly predicted the win for Christopher Walken receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<ref name=S&E-Oscar/>\n\nAccording to producer Deeley, orchestrated lobbying against ''The Deer Hunter'' was led by [[Warren Beatty]], whose own picture ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' had multiple nominations.<ref name=Deeley-3>Deeley, p. 3</ref> Beatty also used ex-girlfriends in his campaign: [[Julie Christie]], serving on the jury at the Berlin Film Festival where ''Deer Hunter'' was screened, joined the walkout of the film by the Russian jury members. Jane Fonda also criticized ''The Deer Hunter'' in public. Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film ''Coming Home'' vying with ''The Deer Hunter'' for Best Picture. According to Deeley, he planted a friend of his in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen ''The Deer Hunter''.<ref name=Deeley-4/> Fonda replied she had not seen the film, and to this day she still has not.<ref name=Biskind/><ref name=Deeley-4/>\n\nAs the Oscars drew near, the backlash against ''The Deer Hunter'' gathered strength. When the limos pulled up to the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] on April 9, 1979, they were met by demonstrators, mostly from the Los Angeles chapter of [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]. The demonstrators waved placards covered with slogans that read \"No Oscars for racism\" and \"''The Deer Hunter'' a bloody lie\" and thrust pamphlets berating ''Deer Hunter'' into long lines of limousine windows.<ref name=Biskind/><ref name=Deeley-4/> Washburn, nominated for Best Original Screenplay, claims his limousine was pelted with stones. According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', \"Police and ''The Deer Hunter'' protesters clashed in a brief but bloody battle that resulted in 13 arrests.\"<ref name=Biskind/>\n\nDe Niro was so anxious that he did not attend the Oscars ceremony. He asked the Academy to allow him to sit out the show backstage, but when the Academy refused, De Niro stayed home in New York.<ref name=Deeley-1>Deeley, p. 1</ref> Producer Deeley made a deal with fellow producer [[David Puttnam]], whose film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'' was nominated, that each would take $500 to the ceremony so if one of them won, the winner would give the loser the $500 to \"drown his sorrows in style.\"<ref name=Deeley-3/>\n\n===Complete list of awards===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

While the film opened the same year as [[Hal Ashby]]'s ''Coming Home'', [[Sidney Furie]]'s ''[[The Boys in Company C]]'', and [[Ted Post]]'s ''[[Go Tell the Spartans]]'', it was the first film about Vietnam to reach a wide audience and critical acclaim, culminating in the winning of the Oscar for Best Picture. Other films released later that illustrated the 'hellish', futile conditions of bloody Vietnam War combat included:<ref name=Dirks/>\n\n* [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979)\n* [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986)\n* [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987)\n* [[John Irvin]]'s ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987)\n* Oliver Stone's ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1989)\n\n[[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] wrote in an article titled \"''The Deer Hunter'': Story of a scene\" that the film changed the way war-time battles were portrayed on film: \"The terror and the blast of firepower changed the war film, even if it only used a revolver. More or less before the late 1970s, the movies had lived by a Second World War code in which battle scenes might be fierce but always rigorously controlled. ''The Deer Hunter'' unleashed a new, raw dynamic in combat and action, paving the way for ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' and Clint Eastwood's Iwo Jima films.\"<ref>{{cite news| last=Thomson| first=David| date=October 19, 2010| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/deer-hunter-action-scene| title=''The Deer Hunter'': Story of a scene| publisher=Guardian.co.uk| work=[[The Guardian]]| access-date=2010-12-07| archive-date=January 21, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121115436/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/19/deer-hunter-action-scene| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2011 interview with Rotten Tomatoes, actor [[William Fichtner]] retrospectively stated that he and his partner were silenced after seeing the film, stating that \"the human experience was just so pointed; their journeys were so difficult, as life is sometimes.
