It stars [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Flashman. Additionally, [[Oliver Reed]] appeared in the role of [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Alan Bates]] as Rudi von Sternberg, and  [[Florinda Bolkan]] played [[Lola Montez]]. Fraser wrote the [[screenplay]] and the film was directed by [[Richard Lester]].\n\nThough it received good reviews for its performances and action scenes, ''Royal Flash'' had only a limited release in cinemas.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with Flashman making a patriotic speech to the boys of [[Rugby School]] framed by a giant [[Union Jack]], in a scene which appears to be a parody of the opening sequence in the 1970 film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''. There is a brief flashback to the events of the original ''[[Flashman (novel)|Flashman]]'', with the head of Rugby School ([[Michael Hordern]]) recounting Flashman's exploits in [[First Anglo-Afghan War|Afghanistan]].\n\nThe film then follows the plot of the book, which itself largely derives from ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]''. Flashman is forced by [[Otto von Bismarck]] to impersonate a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[prince]], who is about to marry a German princess ([[Britt Ekland]]). Bismarck exacts this retribution partly in revenge for his humiliation at the hands of Flashman in London; Flashman stole Bismarck's mistress [[Lola Montez]], then manoeuvred him into boxing against a professional boxer, [[John Gully]] (played by [[Henry Cooper (boxer)|Henry Cooper]]), at a house party. Bismarck does not wish the Princess to marry a Dane, since this may tilt the balance on the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] and interfere with his plans for a united Germany.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43459077 |title=ON THE SET OF \"ROYAL FLASH\". |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=26 February 1975 |access-date=24 January 2013 |page=27 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Harry Flashman|Captain Harry Flashman]]\n* [[Alan Bates]] as Rudi Von Sternberg\n* [[Florinda Bolkan]] as Lola Montez\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as Otto von Bismarck\n* [[Tom Bell (actor)|Tom Bell]] as De Gautet\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as Sapten\n* [[Christopher Cazenove]] as Eric Hansen\n* [[Henry Cooper]] as John Gully, M.P.\n* [[Lionel Jeffries]] as Kraftstein\n* [[Alastair Sim]] as Mr Greig\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as Headmaster\n* [[Britt Ekland]] as Duchess Irma\n* [[Richard Pearson (actor)|Richard Pearson]] as Duchy Chamberlain \n* [[Alan Howard (actor)|Alan Howard]] as Ducky Chamberlain\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as Police Constable\n* [[Richard Hurndall]] as Detchard\n* [[Arthur Brough]] as King Ludwig of Bavaria\n* [[Elizabeth Larner]] as Baroness Pechman \n* [[Margaret Courtenay (actress)|Margaret Courtenay]] as Soprano\n* Stuart Rayner as Speedicut\n* [[Leon Greene]] as Grundwig\n* [[David Jason]] as The Mayor\n* [[Noel Johnson]] as Lord Chamberlain\n* [[Ben Aris]] as Fireman\n* [[Rula Lenska]] as Helga\n* [[Bob Peck]] as Police Inspector\n* [[John Stuart (actor)|John Stuart]] as English General \n* [[Frank Grimes]] as Lieutenant\n* Paul Burton as Tom Brown\n* [[Tessa Dahl]] as 1st Girl\n* Claire Russell as 2nd Girl\n* Kubi Chaza as Lucy\n* [[David Sterne]] as Policeman\n* Meg Davis as Barmaid \n* [[Roger Hammond (actor)|Roger Hammond]] as Master\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''[[Flashman (novel)|Flashman]]'', the first novel of ''[[The Flashman Papers]]'' series, had been published in 1968 and attracted the interest of film producers. At one stage Richard Lester was to direct, but the necessary financing could not be secured. However, Lester enjoyed the novel and then hired George MacDonald Fraser to adapt ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' for two successful films in the early 1970s. This enabled Lester to obtain finance for a Flashman film.\n\n''Royal Flash'' was the second Flashman novel, and had been published in 1970. The ''New York Times'' said \"Mr MacDonald Fraser has considerable narrative skill... most ingeniously plotted and often hilariously funny.\"<ref>\"Royal Flash\" by Ricard Boston. ''New York Times'' 18 Oct 1970: BR3.</ref>\n\nLester said he did not want to film the first novel as \"after putting so much work into it originally, I felt that I'd already made the film, even though it had never reached the shooting stage. It was dead.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Yule |title=The Man Who \"Framed\" the Beatles: A Biography of Richard Lester |year=1994 |publisher=D.I.

Just prior to filming, Picker and United Artists withdrew finance, but Twentieth Century Fox - who had distributed the ''Musketeers'' films - stepped in instead.<ref>Yule p 247</ref>\n\nThe film was shot partly on location in Bavaria.<ref>\"Movie fan's guide: Photogenic Bavaria\" Jim; Higgins, Shirley.

I think Germany was a difficult place to film in.\"<ref>Yule p 249</ref>\n\nIt introduced actors [[Bob Peck]], and [[Christopher Cazenove]].\n\nThe film was cut from 118 minutes to 102 minutes prior to release. Among the scenes lost were flashbacks to Flashman's life at school, and the entire role of [[Roy Kinnear]].<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/filmsofrichardle00siny/page/112 112]|title=The films of Richard Lester|url=https://archive.org/details/filmsofrichardle00siny|url-access=registration|last=Sinyard|first= Neil|year=1985 |publisher=Croom Helm }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Observer'' said the film \"leaves one breathless not so much with enchantment as with boredom\".<ref>\"Cut-price Errol Flynn\" Milne, Tom.
