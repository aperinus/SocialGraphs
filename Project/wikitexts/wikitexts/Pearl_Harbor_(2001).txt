It stars [[Ben Affleck]],  [[Kate Beckinsale]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Tom Sizemore]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Colm Feore]], and [[Alec Baldwin]]. The film features a heavily fictionalized version of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by Japanese forces on December 7, 1941, focusing on a love story set amidst the lead up to the attack, its aftermath, and the [[Doolittle Raid]].\n\nThe film was a box office success, earning $59 million in its opening weekend and nearly $450 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> but received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the story, long runtime, screenplay and dialogue, pacing, performances and historical inaccuracies, although the visual effects and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised. It was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], winning in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]]. However, it was also nominated for six [[Golden Raspberry Awards]], including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]]. This marked the first (and to date, only) occurrence of a Worst Picture-nominated film winning an Academy Award; it is also the only film directed by Bay to win an Academy Award.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1923 [[Tennessee]], two best friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, play together in the back of an old [[biplane]], pretending to be fighting airmen.\n\nIn January 1941, with [[World War II]] raging, Danny and Rafe are both first lieutenants under the command of Major [[Jimmy Doolittle]]. Doolittle informs Rafe that he has been accepted into the [[Eagle Squadron]] (an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] outfit for American pilots during the [[Battle of Britain]]). A nurse named Evelyn Johnson passes Rafe's medical exam despite his [[dyslexia]], and the two strike up a relationship. Four weeks later, Rafe and Evelyn, now deeply in love, enjoy an evening of dancing at a nightclub and later a jaunt in the New York harbor in a borrowed police boat. Rafe shocks Evelyn by saying that he has joined the Eagle Squadron and is leaving the next day. During a mission to intercept a [[Luftwaffe]] bombing raid, Rafe is shot down over the English Channel and is presumed killed in action. Danny and Evelyn mourn Rafe's death together, which spurs a romance between the two.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Japan]] prepares to attack the US Pacific Fleet, deciding the best way to do so would be a decisive strike on the Pearl Harbor naval base.\n\nOn the night of December 6, Evelyn is shocked to discover Rafe standing outside her door, having survived his downing and the ensuing months trapped in Nazi-occupied France. Rafe, in turn, discovers Danny's romance with Evelyn and leaves for the Hula bar, where he is welcomed back by his overjoyed fellow pilots. Danny finds a drunken Rafe in the bar with the intention of reconciling, but the two get into a fight. They drive away, avoiding being put in the brig when the military police arrive at the bar. The two fall asleep in Danny's car.\n\nNext morning, on December 7, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] begins its [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The US Pacific Fleet is severely damaged in the surprise attack, and most of the defending airfields are obliterated before they are able to launch fighters to defend the harbor. Rafe and Danny take off in [[P-40]] fighter planes, and they shoot down several of the attacking planes. They later assist in the rescue of the crew of the capsized {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|6}}, but are too late to save the crew of the obliterated {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}}.\n\nThe next day, President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] delivers his [[Infamy Speech|Day of Infamy Speech]] to the nation and requests that the US Congress declare a state of war with the [[Empire of Japan]]. The survivors attend a memorial service to honor the numerous dead. Danny and Rafe are both assigned to travel stateside under Doolittle, though they are not told why. Before they leave, Evelyn reveals to Rafe that she is pregnant with Danny's child. Evelyn reassures Rafe she loved him in the past and will love him her whole life, but says she is ready to give Danny her \"whole heart\" and have their family together.\n\nDanny and Rafe are both promoted to captain and awarded the [[Silver Star]] for their actions at Pearl Harbor, and Doolittle asks them to volunteer for a secret mission. During the next three months, Rafe, Danny and other pilots train for ultra-short takeoffs with specially modified [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] bombers. In April, the raiders are sent toward Japan on board {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}}. Their mission is to [[Doolittle raid|bomb Tokyo]], after which they will land in China. The mission is successful, but Rafe's and Danny's planes run out of fuel and crash in Japanese-occupied territory in China. A gunfight ensues between the raiders and Japanese ground troops, and Danny is mortally wounded shielding Rafe before the group are rescued by Chinese soldiers. Rafe tearfully reveals to Danny that Evelyn is pregnant with Danny's child; with his dying breaths, Danny tells Rafe that it is his child now.\n\nAfter the war, Rafe and Evelyn, now married, visit Danny's grave with Evelyn's son, named Danny after his biological father. Rafe then asks his stepson if he would like to go flying, and they fly off into the sunset in the old biplane that Rafe's father once owned.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Fictional characters===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as the [[First lieutenant|First Lieutenant]] / Captain Rafe McCawley, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]] combat pilot and one of the three protagonists.

Also controversial was the effort to change the film's rating from R to PG-13. Bay initially wanted to graphically portray the horrors of war and was not interested in primarily marketing the final product to a teen and young adult audience. However, even though he wanted to make an R-rated movie, Bay admitted that the problem was that young children would not be able to see it, and he felt that they should. As such, when he was ordered by Disney to make a PG-13 movie, he didn't argue. As a compromise, he was allowed to release an R-rated Director's Cut on DVD later on in 2002. Budget fights continued throughout the planning of the film, with Bay \"walking\" on several occasions. Dick Cook, chairman of Disney at the time, said \"I think ''Pearl Harbor'' was one of the most difficult shoots of modern history.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/michael-bay-oral-history|title=An Oral History of Transformers Director Michael Bay|last=Fennessey|first=Sean|date=June 27, 2011|work=GQ|access-date=September 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn order to recreate the atmosphere of pre-war Pearl Harbor, the producers staged the film in Hawaii and used current naval facilities. Many active duty military members stationed in Hawaii and members of the local population served as extras during the filming. The set at [[Rosarito Beach]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Baja California]] was used for scale model work as required. Formerly the set of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), Rosarito was the ideal location to recreate the death throes of the battleships in the Pearl Harbor attack. A large-scale model of the bow section of {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|6}} mounted on the world's largest [[gimbal]] produced an authentic rolling and submerging of the doomed battleship. Production Engineer [[Nigel Phelps]] stated that the sequence of the ship rolling out of the water and slapping down would involve one of the \"biggest set elements\" to be staged. Matched with computer generated imagery, the action had to reflect precision and accuracy throughout.<ref>Sunshine and Felix 2001, p. 135.</ref>\n\nThe vessel most seen in the movie was [[USS Lexington (CV-16)|USS ''Lexington'']], representing both USS ''Hornet'' and a Japanese carrier. All aircraft take-offs during the movie were filmed on board the ''Lexington'', a [[museum ship]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]]. The aircraft on display were removed for filming and were replaced with film aircraft as well as World War II anti-aircraft turrets. Other ships used in filler scenes included {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}},<ref name=Heines>Heines, vienne.

Stennis|USS ''John C. Stennis'']], which made a six-day trip from San Diego to serve as \"the world's largest and most expensive outdoor theater\".

The film has been directed without grace, vision, or originality, and although you may walk out quoting lines of dialogue, it will not be because you admire them.\" Ebert also criticized the liberties the film took with historical facts: \"There is no sense of history, strategy or context; according to this movie, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because America cut off its oil supply, and they were down to an 18-month reserve.

In the film, [[Jimmy Doolittle]] and the rest of the Doolittle raiders had to launch from USS ''Hornet'' 624 miles off the Japanese coast and after being spotted by a few Japanese patrol boats. In actuality, the Doolittle raiders had to launch 650 miles off the Japanese coast and after being spotted by only one Japanese patrol boat. In the film, the only raiders shown in the raid are depicted as dropping their bombs on Tokyo, with some of the bomb blasts obliterating entire buildings. In actuality, the Doolittle raiders did bomb Tokyo but also targeted three other industrial cities, and the damage inflicted was minimal. Prior to the raid a chalkboard containing plans for the raid does accurately reflect other destination cities, but this is mostly obscured from view and never discussed in the dialogue.<ref>Gutthman, Edward.

Limited number of early cannon-armed Spitfires Mk.IB served for brief time with [[No. 19 Squadron RAF]], but these proved to be too unreliable and were soon withdrawn from active service.

On the morning of the attack, he is seen commanding a radar station. While playing chess he is addressed as \"lieutenant\" but, in a further inconsistency, is seen wearing the insignia of an army captain.\n\nFour {{sclass|Spruance|destroyer|0}} destroyers tied abreast of each other at their pier are seen being bombed by the Japanese planes, although this class of ship only entered service with the US Navy in the 1970s. The retired ''Iowa''-class battleship [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] was used to represent USS ''West Virginia'' for [[Doris Miller|Dorie Miller]]'s boxing match. ''West Virginia'' did not have the modernized World War II-era bridge and masts found on newer U.S. battleships until her reconstruction was finished in 1943, while the ''Iowa'' class did not enter service until 1943 onward. In one shot, the USS ''Arizona'' memorial is briefly visible in the background during a scene taking place several months before the attack. Miller is shown as a Petty Officer Second Class; but he was actually a Petty Officer Third Class.\n\nCountless other technical lapses rankled film critics, such as Bay's decision to paint the Japanese Zero fighters green (most of the aircraft in the attack were painted light gray/white), even though he knew that was historically inaccurate, because he liked the way the aircraft looked and because it would help audiences differentiate the \"good guys from the bad guys\".<ref name=\"Cagle p. 51\">Cagle 2001, p. 51.</ref>\n\nOne of Doolittle's trophies in a display case depicts a model of an [[F-86 Sabre]], which was not flown until 1947.\n\nLate production models of the [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25J]] were used instead of the early B-25B.\n\nSeveral shots of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} depicted it as having an angled flight deck, a technology that was not implemented until after the war, although no U.S. straight flight deck carriers exist anymore.

In the movie it was done by maneuvering an ''Essex''-class aircraft carrier backward to act as ''Akagi''.\n\nAn establishing shot of the [[US Department of War]] building is clearly a shot of the exterior of the [[US Capitol Building]]. In 1941, the War Department was housed in the War Department Building in Washington's [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood (renamed the [[Harry S Truman Building]] in 2000) and in the [[Munitions Building]] on the [[National Mall]]. Neither structure bears any architectural resemblance to the building shown in the film.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' contains a song entitled \"End of an Act\". The song's chorus recounts, \"''Pearl Harbor'' sucked, and I miss you\" equating the singer's longing for his girlfriend to how much \"Michael Bay missed the mark when he made ''Pearl Harbor''\" which is \"an awful lot, girl\".
