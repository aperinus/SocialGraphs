It was based on [[Victor Canning]]'s 1972 novel ''[[The Rainbird Pattern]]'', which [[Ernest Lehman]] adapted for the screen. The film stars [[Karen Black]], [[Bruce Dern]], [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] and [[William Devane]]; it was screened at the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival]], but was not entered into the main competition.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2101/year/1976.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Family Plot |access-date=2009-05-10 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927201842/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2101/year/1976.html |archive-date=2012-09-27}}</ref>\n\nThe story involves two couples: one a \"fake\" [[psychic]] and her cab-driving boyfriend, the other a pair of professional [[thieves]] and [[kidnappers]]. Their lives come into conflict because of a search for a [[missing heir]]. The film's title is a pun: \"family plot\" can refer to an area in a cemetery that has been bought by one family for the burial of its various relatives; in this case it also means a dramatic plot line involving various family members.\n\n==Plot==\nFake [[psychic]] Blanche Tyler ([[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]]) and her boyfriend George Lumley ([[Bruce Dern]]) attempt to locate the nephew of wealthy, guilt-ridden, elderly Julia Rainbird ([[Cathleen Nesbitt]]). Julia's recently-deceased sister gave the baby boy up for [[adoption]], but Julia now wants to make him her heir and will pay Blanche $10,000 to find him. Julia knows almost nothing about the infant. During his investigation George discovers that the boy was given the name Edward Shoebridge, and is thought to have died while still young. However George tracks down a man, Joseph Maloney ([[Ed Lauter]]), who paid for Edward's tombstone years after his supposed death, and George comes to think the grave is empty. George and Blanche bicker frequently, but he is as good an investigator as she is a psychic, and their relationship is solid.\n\nMeanwhile, it has been revealed to the viewers that Shoebridge murdered his adoptive parents and faked his own death, and is now a successful jeweler in [[San Francisco]] known as Arthur Adamson ([[William Devane]]). He and his live-in girlfriend Fran ([[Karen Black]]) kidnap millionaires and dignitaries, confining them in a secure room in the cellar of their home, and return them in exchange for [[ransom]]s in the form of valuable [[gemstone]]s. Arthur conceals the latest ransom, a large diamond, \"in plain sight\" within a crystal chandelier hanging above the home's main staircase.\n\nWhen Adamson learns that George is investigating him, he enlists Maloney (the two had murdered Adamson's adoptive parents long ago) to kill Blanche and George. Maloney initially refuses to help, then contacts Blanche and George, telling them to meet him at a caf\u00e9 on a mountain road. He cuts the brakeline of Blanche's car, but they manage to survive their dangerous high-speed descent. Maloney tries to run them over, but dies in a fiery explosion when he swerves to avoid an oncoming car and his car goes over the edge.\n\nAt Maloney's funeral, his wife ([[Katherine Helmond]]) tearfully confesses, under pressure of George's questioning, that Shoebridge's name is now Arthur Adamson. George must go to work driving his taxi for an evening shift, so Blanche tracks down various A. Adamsons in San Francisco, eventually reaching the jewelry store as it closes for the day. Arthur's assistant Mrs. Clay ([[Edith Atwater]]) offers to let Blanche leave a note. Blanche tricks Mrs. Clay into giving her his home address.\n\nArthur and Fran are bundling their latest kidnap victim, Bishop Wood ([[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]]), into their car when Blanche rings their doorbell. They attempt to drive out of their garage, but Blanche's car blocks their way. She tells Arthur that his aunt wants to make him her heir, and for a moment everyone seems delighted with developments. Then Blanche sees the unconscious bishop, and she is abducted by the couple. Arthur drugs her and leaves her in the cellar, to deal with after they exchange the bishop for ransom.\n\nSearching for Blanche, George finds her car outside Arthur and Fran's house. When no one answers the door, he breaks in and searches for her. He finds her handbag with blood stains on it, and indications of a struggle. When Arthur and Fran return home George hides upstairs. He overhears Arthur telling Fran about his plan to kill Blanche and make her death seem a suicide. George manages to talk to Blanche, who is faking unconsciousness in the cellar (left open by Arthur when he went to check on her) and they come up with a plan. Arthur and Fran enter to carry Blanche out to the car, but she knocks them down and runs out and George locks the kidnappers in.\n\nBlanche then goes into what appears to be a genuine \"trance\". She walks out of the basement and climbs halfway up the main staircase, stops, and points at the huge diamond hidden in the chandelier. Blanche then \"wakes\" and asks George what she is doing there. He excitedly tells her that she is indeed a real psychic. He calls the police to collect the reward for capturing the kidnappers and finding the jewels. A smiling Blanche winks at the camera.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Karen Black]] as Fran\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as George Lumley\n* [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as Blanche Tyler\n* [[William Devane]] as Arthur Adamson/Edward Shoebridge\n* [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] as Julia Rainbird\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as Joseph P.

Lehman wanted the film to be sweeping, dark and dramatic, but Hitchcock kept pushing him toward lightness and comedy. Lehman's screenplay earned him a 1977 [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]].\n\nThe novel on which the film is based had earlier been rejected by Lehman, to whom it had been submitted as a potential project for him to either produce or direct, or both. Hitchcock's other collaboration with the screenwriter, ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), was followed by several aborted projects. Lehman had incurred the director's anger by declining an offer to write the screenplay for ''[[List of unproduced Hitchcock projects#No Bail for the Judge (1958\u20131961)|No Bail for the Judge]]'', a thriller set in London intended to star [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Laurence Harvey]] and actor [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]]. Although Hitchcock eventually had a fine screenplay, and pre-production ([[location scouting]] and costumes) was at an advanced stage, the film was never made; Hepburn became pregnant and Hitchcock turned to another project, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), instead.\n[[File:Hitch-at-work;1975-FamilyPlot;SF-On-Location.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hitchcock at work on location in San Francisco for ''Family Plot'']]\n\nBy September 1973, Ernest Lehman had been persuaded to do the adaptation again \u2014 Hitchcock explained that he intended to keep only the bare-bones of Canning's novel and to relocate the story from England to California. One of the early decisions was to drop Canning's title and the project was branded ''Deceit''.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = McGilligan | first1 = Patrick | title = Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light | publisher = | pages = 716\u201317 | date = 2003 | isbn = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Family Plot (1976) | url = https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Family_Plot_(1976) | website = The Hitchcock Zone | date = | access-date = 7 August 2022}}</ref> Partway through filming, ''Variety'' confirmed in mid-July 1975 that the film had been retitled ''Family Plot''.<ref>{{Citation | title = Pictures: Alfred Hitchcock's 53rd film | journal = Variety | publisher = Reed Business Information | volume = 279 | issue = 10 | pages = 36 | date = 7 August 2022 | orig-date = 16 July 1975 | year =  | language =  | url = | issn = 0042-2738 | archive-url = | archive-date = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Variety (1975) - Pictures: Alfred Hitchcock's 53rd film | url = https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Variety_(1975)_-_Pictures:_Alfred_Hitchcock%27s_53rd_film | website = The Hitchcock Zone | date = | access-date = 7 August 2022}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock, who often liked to specify the locales of his films by using on-screen titles or by using recognizable landmarks, deliberately left the story's location unspecific, using sites in both San Francisco and Los Angeles. The chase scene in the movie, which writer [[Donald Spoto]] called a spoof on car chases prevalent in films at the time, was filmed on the extensive Universal backlot. The restaurant used in the film was also built on the backlot and was shown on studio tours in 1975.\n\n[[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|Hitchcock's signature cameo]] in ''Family Plot'' can be seen 40 minutes into the film. He appears in silhouette through the glass door of the [[Registrar of Births and Deaths]].\n\nFollowing ''Family Plot'', Hitchcock worked on the script for a projected spy thriller, ''[[The Short Night]]''. His declining health prevented the filming of the screenplay, which was published in a book during Hitchcock's last years. Universal chose not to film the script with another director, although it did authorize sequels to Hitchcock's ''Psycho''.\n\n===Casting===\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2010}}\nHitchcock considered such actors as [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Roy Scheider]] (for Adamson), [[Al Pacino]] (for George), [[Faye Dunaway]] (for Fran), and [[Beverly Sills]] and [[Goldie Hawn]] (for Blanche) for the film. [[Cybill Shepherd]] wrote in her memoir that she had hoped to play the part of Fran, which eventually went to [[Karen Black]]. High salary demands were partly responsible for his turning to other actors. Although [[Liza Minnelli]] was among the stars recommended to Hitchcock, he was especially delighted to work with [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as the medium. He had previously tried to hire her for other film projects.\n\nHitchcock had earlier worked with [[Bruce Dern]] on episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and on ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), in which he had a brief role in a flashback playing a doomed sailor.\n\n===Music===\nFor the score, Universal's music executive, [[Harry Garfield]], recommended [[John Williams]] to Hitchcock, following the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] and critical acclaim of his music score for ''[[Jaws (soundtrack)|Jaws]]''.\n\nThe film was the only Hitchcock production to be scored by [[John Williams|Williams]], who has stated that Hitchcock wanted choir voices for Madame Blanche to make her seem psychic towards the beginning, and that Hitchcock was at the scoring sessions most of the time and would often give him suggestions. For the scene in which Maloney suddenly disappears from Adamson's office, Hitchcock suggested that Williams stop the music when the camera cuts to the open window to indicate to the audience that Maloney has left through it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01pmfz5/Composer_of_the_Week_John_Williams_(1932)_Americas_Composer/ |title=Composer of the Week: John Williams (1932-) 3 America's Composer |publisher=[[BBC Radio 3]] |access-date=October 6, 2013}}</ref> Hitchcock then went on to say, \"Mr. Williams, murder can be fun\", when he suggested that he should conduct the music lightly for a darker scene of the film. Williams stated that it was a great privilege, and that he had a wonderful working experience with the director.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe complete soundtrack was not released upon the film's release date. Few themes from the film were released on John Williams and Alfred Hitchcock compilation albums. For years afterwards, the original soundtrack was not available, spawning many bootleg copies of the complete scoring sessions of the film over the internet. Finally in 2010, [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] officially released a limited edition of the complete Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, 34 years after the film's initial release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.varesesarabande.com/servlet/the-260/Family-Plot/Detail |title=''Family Plot'' |publisher=[[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] |access-date=October 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314214335/http://www.varesesarabande.com/servlet/the-260/Family-Plot/Detail |archive-date=March 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline  = ''Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''\n| title1    = The First S\u00e9ance\n| length1   = 5:29\n| title2    = Blanche's Challenge\n| length2   = 2:09\n| title3    = The Mystery Woman\n| length3   = 3:27\n| title4    = The Rescue of Constantine / The Diamond Chandelier\n| length4   = 2:21\n| title5    = Kitchen Pranks\n| length5   = 2:08\n| title6    = The Shoebridge Headstone\n| length6   = 2:23\n| title7    = Maloney's Visit to the Jewelry Store / Maloney's Knife / The Stake Out\n| length7   = 4:58\n| title8    = The Second S\u00e9ance\n| length8   = 2:20\n| title9    = Nothing Held Back\n| length9   = 0:37\n| title10   = The White Mustang\n| length10  = 1:19\n| title11   = Blanche and George\n| length11  = 1:17\n| title12   = Maloney's Exit\n| length12  = 2:03\n| title13   = Share and Share Alike\n| length13  = 0:54\n| title14   = The Mondrian Shot / The Revealed Identity\n| length14  = 1:47\n| title15   = The Search Montage\n| length15  = 3:41\n| title16   = Blanche's Arrival / Blanche's Note\n| length16  = 2:29\n| title17   = Blanche Gets the Needle\n| length17  = 3:03\n| title18   = Breaking Into the House\n| length18  = 5:16\n| title19   = The Secret Door / Blanche Wakes Up\n| length19  = 1:39\n| title20   = End Cast\n| length20  = 4:14\n| title21   = ''Family Plot'' Theme\n| length21  = 2:38\n| title22   = The Stonecutter\n| length22  = 6:35\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Family Plot'' has received praise from critics.
