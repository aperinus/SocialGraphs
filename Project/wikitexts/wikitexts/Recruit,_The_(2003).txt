It was produced by Epsilon Motion Pictures and released in North America by [[Touchstone Pictures]] on January 31, 2003, receiving mixed reviews from critics and grossing $101 million worldwide.<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nJames Clayton is a prodigious programmer studying [[Linear cryptanalysis|nonlinear cryptography]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], collaborating with a group of peers to create Spartacus, a surveillance program that can enslave any computer's audiovisual hardware to the master computer via the internet. His group showcases the software to [[Dell]] at a campus fair drawing substantial interest in its uses.\n\nLater at his night job, James is approached by Walter Burke, a man who claims to have known James\u2019 deceased father and suggests he works for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. After a pitch to recruit James into the agency, James initially declines until he reconsiders it as an opportunity to get answers to his father's mysterious plane crash in Peru several years earlier.\n\nJames passes the initial security screening and is bussed with the rest of his class to [[Camp Peary|The Farm]] in rural [[Virginia]] where they undergo training as potential operatives. While there, James develops an attraction to Layla Moore and a rivalry with Zack who is James\u2019 competition for top of the class.\n\nOne night during a training exercise in which James and Layla are paired together to tail a mark, they are abducted by masked assailants and imprisoned where they are tortured psychologically and physically for several days. Their interrogators wish to know what happens at The Farm and the names of those who teach there. After resisting for days, James breaks when he's told about Layla's brutal treatment. He reveals Burke's name, at which point it's revealed that the whole experience was part of the exercise that the class was observing, including Layla, and that James failed by breaking. He is then dismissed from The Farm and the Agency.\n\nLater, Burke seeks out a despondent James and informs him that his discharge was part of a cover story because he's been selected as a [[non-official cover]] operative, or \u201cNOC\u201d. He gives James a low-level data entry position at the Agency so he can get close to Layla who has graduated from the Farm and now holds a desk position higher in the Agency than James. Burke explains that Layla is suspected of working with foreign agents to steal CIA secrets, specifically a highly sensitive computer virus called \"ICE-9\" because it transmits via the electrical grid rather than telecommunications and is easily capable of disabling all electrical devices on the planet instantly, thus behaving similarly to the particle from the [[Kurt Vonnegut]] novel ''[[Cat's Cradle]]''.\n\nJames reunites with Layla and the two begin a romantic relationship. While staying overnight at her home, he checks her laptop for evidence of her crimes and she plants a bug on the lapel of his winter coat. Later, he witnesses her making a [[dead drop]] at [[Union Station (Washington Metro)|Union Station]], and follows the mysterious agent who retrieves what Layla left behind. \nThe two end up in a shootout on the train tracks and the agent, who is revealed to be Zack, is killed.\n\nBelieving both of them to be traitors, James confronts Layla who tells him that Zack was the NOC, not him, and that she was tasked with assessing the security protocols of the CIA [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|headquarters]] because it was feared that someone else was stealing CIA material.\n\nJames then goes to a meet with Burke wherein he confronts Burke about what's really happening. Burke claims that Zack's death was faked, that the gun Burke gave James is loaded with non-lethal ammunition, and that everyone is intending to rendezvous for debrief momentarily. However, Burke catches James off guard and shoots at him, narrowly missing him but blowing out the rear window of his vehicle in the process, proving that the gun was in fact loaded with live ammunition and therefore Zack is indeed dead.\n\nBurke pursues James through the abandoned warehouse they were parked outside of, explaining to James along the way why he set up the elaborate lie to implicate them and cover up his own crimes of selling Agency secrets to foreign governments. James meanwhile has set up a laptop running Spartacus though it failed to connect, however he leads Burke to believe it successfully transmitted his confession back to the Agency and he's now incriminated for everything. Burke angrily destroys the laptop and pursues James outside of the warehouse where a CIA strike team led by Dennis Slayne, another Farm instructor, is waiting. Burke launches into a tirade, airing his grievances against the Agency, believing that he was never appreciated for all the sacrifices he made in his career. Slayne realizes that Burke is the one they're looking for and directs the strike team to target Burke to take into custody, revealing they were originally there to arrest James.\n\nRealizing now that he really is incriminated, Burke refuses to be taken into custody and instead raises his empty gun at the strike team who quickly shoot and kill him. Slayne then drives James back to headquarters for a debrief, cryptically mentioning along the way that James was meant to be in that line of work because \u201cit\u2019s in [his] blood\u201d suggesting his father in fact worked for the agency, despite Burke's earlier denial of such.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as James Douglas Clayton\n* [[Al Pacino]] as CIA Officer Walter Burke\n* [[Bridget Moynahan]] as CIA Officer Layla Moore\n* [[Gabriel Macht]] as CIA Officer Zack\n* [[Kenneth Mitchell (actor)|Kenneth Mitchell]] as Alan\n* [[Karl Pruner]] as CIA Agent Dennis Slayne\n* Mike Realba as Ronnie Gibson\n* Elisa Moolecherry as Lisa Sahadi\n* [[Merwin Mondesir]] as Stan\n* Sam Kalilieh as Elliot\n* [[Chris Owens (actor)|Chris Owens]] as Art Wallis\n* Richard Fitzpatrick as Rob Stevens\n* [[Ron Lea]] as Bill Rudolph, Dell Rep.\n* Tova Smith as Beth\n* Michael Rubenfeld as Felix\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by [[Gary Barber]]'s and [[Roger Birnbaum]]'s production company [[Spyglass Entertainment]], with financial support from Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures]] and German film financing company Epsilon Motion Pictures (which was owned by the [[Kirch Group]] at the time).<ref>[https://variety.com/2005/film/news/kinowelt-buys-epsilon-1117933503/ Variety, November 24, 2005: ''Kinowelt buys Epsilon''] Linked 2014-01-13</ref> Filming began on December 3, 2001.
