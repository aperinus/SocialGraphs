The screenplay was written by [[Richard Curtis]], and the film was produced by [[Duncan Kenworthy]]. The film stars [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Hugh Grant]], with [[Rhys Ifans]], [[Emma Chambers]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Gina McKee]], and [[Hugh Bonneville]] in supporting roles. The story is of a romance between a London bookseller (Grant) and a famous American actress (Roberts) who happens to walk into his shop.\n\nReleased on 21 May 1999, ''Notting Hill'' was well-received by critics and became the highest-grossing British film of all time. The film was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], with Roberts and Grant also receiving nominations for their performances. The film also earned two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominations. It also won a [[British Comedy Award]] and a [[Brit Award]] for the soundtrack.\n\n==Plot==\nWilliam Thacker owns a travel book store in [[Notting Hill]], London. Divorced, Will shares a flat with Spike, a flaky and sloppy Welshman. One day, famous Hollywood actress Anna Scott enters the shop and buys a book. Shortly after she leaves, Will bumps into her while rounding a street corner, spilling his juice on her. He takes Anna to his flat that is directly across the street so she can change into something clean. When leaving, she impulsively kisses him.\n\nAnna later invites him to visit her at the [[The Ritz Hotel, London|Ritz Hotel]]. Upon his arrival he is mistaken for a reporter and ushered into a [[press junket]] for her new film. When asked, he says he writes for ''[[Horse & Hound]]'' magazine. Anna asks to be William's date at his sister's birthday party later that evening. Though his friends and family are surprised, Anna gets on well with everyone and enjoys herself. Later, the two enter a private neighbourhood park, where Anna again kisses Will.\n\nAt a restaurant the next day, Will and Anna overhear four men at a nearby table discussing her, first praising and then disparaging her and equating actresses to prostitutes. Will confronts them, then she introduces herself and calmly insults the stunned foursome.\n\nAnna invites Will to her hotel room, but he quickly leaves after discovering that her movie star boyfriend, Jeff King, has unexpectedly arrived from America. Over the next six months, Will's friends arrange a series of dates for him, but Will, unable to forget Anna, is uninterested in another relationship.\n[[File:Portobello Road, Notting Hill.jpg|thumb|alt=A road with some cars parked on it next to a line of houses|300px|right|Much of the filming took place on [[Portobello Road]].]]\nOne day, a distraught Anna appears at Will's doorstep, needing to hide from a tabloid scandal. She apologises about King and says their relationship is over. They discover shared interests, and discuss Will's print of [[Marc Chagall]]'s 1950 painting ''[[La Mari\u00e9e]]''. They make love that night. The next morning, paparazzi, inadvertently tipped off by Spike, besiege the house and take photos of Will, Anna, and a half-dressed Spike at the front door. Furious, she blames Will and leaves.\n\nSeveral seasons pass, and Will remains miserable. When he discovers Anna is back in London making a film based on a [[Henry James]] novel, something he had suggested, he visits the set unannounced. She asks him to wait until shooting is done, but he leaves after overhearing her being dismissive about him to another actor. Anna comes to the bookshop the next day, bringing a wrapped gift. Will says he overheard what she said about him to her co-star. She explains that she was merely keeping her personal life private from another actor. She proclaims that she loves him, and pleads to rekindle their relationship. Will says no, explaining he would be too hurt if she left him again.\n\nWill meets his friends and sister at a restaurant with Anna's partly opened gift: Chagall's original ''[[La Mari\u00e9e]]'' (''The Bride''). They half-heartedly support his decision about Anna until Spike arrives and calls him a \"daft prick\". Will realizes his mistake, and everyone races across London to find Anna, who is holding a press conference at the [[Savoy Hotel]]. Will arrives just as her publicist announces that Anna is taking a year off and is leaving the UK that night.\n\nA reporter asks about the embarrassing photographs taken at Will's flat, and Anna says they are just friends. Will, again pretending to be a ''Horse & Hound'' reporter, asks her if she would consider being more than friends if Thacker begged her forgiveness. She says she would, then asks to be asked again how long she plans to stay in England. Smiling, she answers \"indefinitely\".\n\nAnna and Will marry and she is now pregnant. They spend time in the private park that they had visited on their first date.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Anna Scott\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as William \"Will\" Thacker\n* [[Hugh Bonneville]] as Bernie\n* [[Emma Chambers]] as Honey Thacker\n* [[James Dreyfus]] as Martin\n* [[Rhys Ifans]] as Spike\n* [[Tim McInnerny]] as Max\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Bella\n* [[Richard McCabe]] as Tony\n* [[Dylan Moran]] as Rufus, the thief\n* [[Henry Goodman]] as the Ritz concierge\n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as ''Time Out'' journalist\n* [[Lorelei King]] as Anna's publicist\n* [[John Shrapnel]] as Anna's UK press agent\n* [[Clarke Peters]] as ''Helix'' lead actor\n* Arturo Venegas as actor in ''Helix''\n* [[Yolanda Vazquez]] as interpreter\n* [[Mischa Barton]] as 12-year-old actress in ''Helix''\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Perfect Girl\n* [[Samuel West]] as Anna's co-star (as Sam West)\n* [[Ann Beach]] as William's mother\n* [[Patrick Barlow]] as Savoy concierge\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Uncredited cast'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jeff King\n* [[Simon Callow]] as himself in Film-within-Film\n* [[Joe Cornish]] as Fan Receiving Anna's Autograph\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Actor in Film-within-Film\n* [[Sally Phillips]] as Caroline (scenes deleted)\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Casting notes'''\n* Julia Roberts was the \"one and only\" choice for the role of Anna Scott, although [[Roger Michell]] and [[Duncan Kenworthy]] did not expect her to accept.

This left the producers to film in a heavily populated area. Kenworthy noted \"Early on, we toyed with the idea of building a huge exterior set. That way we would have more control, because we were worried about having Roberts and Grant on public streets where we could get thousands of onlookers.\" In the end they decided to film in the streets. Michell was worried \"that Hugh and Julia were going to turn up on the first day of shooting on [[Portobello Road]], and there would be gridlock and we would be surrounded by thousands of people and paparazzi photographers who would prevent us from shooting\". The location team and security personnel prevented this, as well as preventing problems the presence of a film crew might have caused the residents of Notting Hill, who Michell believes were \"genuinely excited\" about the film. Location manager Sue Quinn described finding locations and getting permission to film as \"a mammoth task\". Quinn and the rest of her team had to write to thousands of people in the area, promising to donate to each person's favourite charity, resulting in 200 charities receiving money.<ref name=location>{{cite web|url=http://www.notting-hill.com/behindscenes/index.html|title=Notting Hill, the place, the movie location|access-date=22 May 2007|publisher=Notting Hill.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117050028/http://www.notting-hill.com/behindscenes/index.html|archive-date=2008-01-17 |df=mdy-all|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; colour:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"The major problem we encountered was the size of our film unit.
