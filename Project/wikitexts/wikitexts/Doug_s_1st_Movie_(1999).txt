The film was directed by [[Maurice Joyce]], and stars the regular television cast of Tom McHugh, [[Fred Newman (sound effects)|Fred Newman]], [[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]], [[Constance Shulman]], [[Frank Welker]], [[Alice Playten]], Guy Hadley, and [[Doris Belack]]. It was produced by [[Walt Disney Television Animation]] and [[Jumbo Pictures]] with animation provided by [[Plus One Animation]], and released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] on March 26, 1999.\n\nA ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' short \"Donald's Dynamite: Opera Box\", was released with it.\n\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews, who criticized its plot, writing, and character development. However, the voice acting, ending and animation were praised. Despite the title and its success at the box office, no further films based on ''Doug'' were made. It serves as the finale of the entire ''Doug'' series.\n\n==Plot==\nBluffCo has been dumping waste into Lucky Duck Lake under the command of CEO Bill Bluff. This pollution creates a friendly creature that is discovered by Doug Funnie and Skeeter Valentine. They house the creature in Doug's home, where they name him Herman, after he tries to eat a copy of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]]. Not wanting him to be discovered, they disguise him as a foreign exchange student called Hermione, causing Doug's love interest Patti Mayonnaise to become jealous from all the attention he gives her, leading school paper reporter Guy Graham to make a move on her. Meanwhile, bully Roger Klotz and his cronies build a robot to kidnap Herman, but instead it becomes very overbearing toward Roger.\n\nDoug and Skeeter show Herman to Doug's neighbor, Mayor Tippy Dink, who warns them Bluff will kill the story if they try to get it into the press. After being mocked by Guy in front of Patti, Doug calls a press announcement where he promises to expose what Bluff is doing to the lake. While initially dismissive, Guy finds a picture of Herman and realizes Doug is telling the truth. He notifies Bluff, who sends BluffCo agents to Doug's announcement posing as reporters to capture Herman. Doug sees through the ruse and calls off the conference, but Herman is kidnapped and Patti now believes Doug to be a liar.\n\nThe next day, in the school newspaper office, Doug finds an article by Guy detailing how Herman attacked students at the upcoming Valentine's Day dance and was killed by BluffCo agents. Realizing Guy and Bluff's plan, Doug and Skeeter recruit Roger and Al and Moo Sleech to help thwart it. On the night of the dance Doug has to give up his last chance to win Patti back in order to save Herman. The Sleech's reprogram Roger's robot to act like the monster in Guy's article, distracting everyone while Doug and Skeeter find Herman and sneak him out of the school in a giant Valentine's decoration.\n\nThey bring Herman to Crystal Lake and release him into the waters, where they are confronted and threatened by Bluff. Seeing this his daughter, Beebe, sides with her friends and Mayor Dink hints at revealing Bluff's practices to the government unless he volunteers to clean up Lucky Duck Lake himself. After Patti sees Doug was right all along she dumps Guy and Doug is about to reveal his feelings for her, but is interrupted by Herman. The gang bid goodbye to Herman and spend the rest of Valentine's night celebrating by the lake.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* Tom McHugh as Doug Funnie, Lincoln\n* [[Fred Newman (sound effects)|Fred Newman]] as Skeeter Valentine, Mr. Dink, Porkchop, Ned\n* [[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]] as Roger Klotz, Boomer, Larry, Mr. Chiminy\n* [[Constance Shulman]] as Patti Mayonnaise\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Herman Melville\n* [[Alice Playten]] as Beebe Bluff, Elmo (this would be her final role in an animated movie before her death in 2011)\n* Guy Hadley as Guy Graham\n* [[Doug Preis]] as Mr. Funnie, Mr. Bluff, Willie, Chalky, Bluff Agent\n* [[Eddie Korbich]] as Al & Moo Sleech, Robocrusher\n* David O'Brien as Quailman Announcer\n* [[Doris Belack]] as Mayor Tippi Dink\n* Becca Lish as Judy Funnie, Mrs. Funnie, Connie\n* [[Greg Lee (actor)|Greg Lee]] as Principal White\n* Bob Bottone as Bluff Assistant\n* Bruce Bayley Johnson as Mr. Swirly\n* [[Fran Brill]] as Mrs. Elaine Perigrew\n* [[Melissa Greenspan]] as Briar Langolier\n\n===Additional voice artists===\n* [[Rodger Bumpass]] as Green Police Officer\n* [[Paul Eiding]] as Red Police Officer \n* Jackie Gonneau as Kid #1\n* [[Sherry Lynn]] as Kid #2\n* Mickie McGowan as Lunch Lady\n* [[Phil Proctor]] as Brian the A/V Nerd\n* [[Brianne Siddall]] as Kid #3\n* Claudette Wells as Kid #4\n\n==Production==\n[[Nickelodeon]] was originally making a ''Doug'' film adaptation in 1993 when they made a deal with [[20th Century Fox]] to make films based on their properties along with films like ''[[Rugrats]]'' and ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show#Film adaptation attempts|Ren & Stimpy]]''. However, the plans evaporated when [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] acquired [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1994, and the deal expired in the following year.

If the film enters the Top 100 then edit the imdb entry on Wikipedia, not this page. -->\nThe film garnered a 26% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with 9 of a total 34 reviews being determined as positive. The critical consensus reads, \"''Doug's 1st Movie'' may entertain very young fans of its main character, but essentially amounts to a forgettable feature-length episode of his show.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|dougs_1st_movie|Doug's 1st Movie}}</ref> Critics were harsh to ''Doug's 1st Movie'' when it was released theatrically. Many noted that the film felt too much like an extended episode of the show (story and animation-wise) and many mention that the film should have stayed a direct-to-video release. Most of the criticism came from the plot, writing, and music, though they praised the animation, voice acting and ending. Screenit.com awarded the film 4 out of 10, determining that it was mediocre and did not have \"that magic or cinematic feel to warrant the big screen treatment\" and it felt like the regular series.<ref name= screenit>{{cite web| url= http://www.screenit.com/movies/1999/dougs_1st_movie.html |title=DOUG'S 1ST MOVIE |website= screenit.com |access-date=2008-04-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2\u00bd out of 4 stars, quoting \"''Doug's 1st Movie'' is a thin and less than thrilling feature-length version of a Saturday morning animated series, unseen by me. Chatter on the Web suggests it was originally intended to go straight to video, but was rechanneled into theaters after the startling success of ''The Rugrats Movie''. Since ''Doug'' originally started on Nickelodeon, where ''Rugrats'' resides, the decision made sense \u2013 or would have if this had been a better movie.\"\n\n===Box office===\n''Doug's 1st Movie'' opened at #5 in its opening weekend with $4,470,489, for an average of $1,971 from a very wide 2,268 theaters. While this may be deemed as low for an average Hollywood film, ''Doug'' only cost $5 million to make due to its direct-to-video budget and a somewhat low-key promotional campaign. As such, the film still managed to gross $19,421,271 in ticket sales, creating a large profit for Disney and making it a box office success.\n\n===Awards and nominations===\nThe film was nominated for a [[Stinkers Bad Movie Awards|Stinker Award]] for Worst Achievement in Animation.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://thestinkers.com/winners99.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20010413034332/http://thestinkers.com/winners99.html |title= The Worst of 1999 Stinkers Winners| website= thestinkers.com| publisher= The Hastings Bad Cinema Society | archive-date= April 13, 2001 | access-date= June 11, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] on September 21, 1999, and on [[DVD]] as a Disney Movie Club exclusive on July 20, 2012. The DVD used a TV edit, with fade-ins and fade-outs to make way for commercial breaks, as well as sped-up closing credits.\n\nThe film, along with ''Disney's Doug'', was released on [[Disney+]] on November 12, 2019, its first day of release. This used a new transfer of the film sourced from the master print, allowing the end credits to be seen at their intended speed.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://movies.disney.com/dougs-1st-movie Official website]\n*{{IMDb title|0187819|Doug's 1st Movie}}\n*''[https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/443010/enwp Doug's 1st Movie]'' at the [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM Movie Database]]\n* {{bcdb title|25035|Doug's 1st Movie}}\n* {{mojo title|dougsfirstmovie|Doug's 1st Movie}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|dougs_1st_movie|Doug's 1st Movie}}\n{{Doug}}\n{{Disney theatrical animated features}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on animated series]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:DisneyToon Studios animated films]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Watters]]\n[[Category:Disney Television Animation films]]\n[[Category:1999 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Doug (TV series)]]"}]}}}}
