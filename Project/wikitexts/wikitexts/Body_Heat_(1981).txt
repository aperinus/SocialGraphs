Matty's wealthy husband, Edmund, is always away on business during the week. Late one night, Ned arrives at the Walker mansion and, seeing Matty in the gazebo, playfully propositions her. The woman is actually Mary Ann Simpson, Matty's old high school friend who physically resembles her and who is briefly in town. Soon after, Matty tells Ned she wants a divorce, but a [[prenuptial agreement]] would leave her almost nothing. When she wishes Edmund was dead, Ned suggests murdering him so Matty can inherit his wealth. Ned consults a shady former client, Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke), an explosives expert, who provides Ned a small [[incendiary device]] though he advises Ned to abandon his plans.\n\nAfter murdering Edmund, Ned and Matty move his body to an abandoned building that Edmund owns. Ned detonates the bomb to make it appear as if Edmund accidentally died during a botched [[arson]] attempt. Soon after, Edmund's lawyer contacts Ned about a new [[will and testament|will]] that Ned supposedly drafted for Edmund and which was witnessed by Mary Ann Simpson. The new will was improperly prepared, making it [[intestacy|null and void]] and results in Matty inheriting Edmund's entire fortune, while disinheriting his sister. Despite Ned's previous warning against making any estate changes, Matty had forged the new will, exploiting Ned's past malpractice issues, knowing it would be nullified and leaving her the sole beneficiary. Ned knows the police will consider the new will suspicious. A prominent plot point centers on a complicated and often misunderstood legal rule known as the [[rule against perpetuities]].\n\nTwo of Ned's friends, assistant deputy prosecutor Peter Lowenstein and police detective Oscar Grace, suspect Ned may be involved in Edmund's death. Evidence includes Edmund's missing eyeglasses, which he always wore. On the night of the murder, hotel phone records show that repeated calls to Ned's room went unanswered, thereby weakening his [[alibi]]. Also, police are unable to locate Mary Ann Simpson.\n\nIncreasingly nervous over the mounting evidence and questioning Matty's loyalty, Ned happens upon a lawyer acquaintance who says he recommended Ned to Matty Walker. He admits telling her about Ned's limited legal skills. Later, Teddy tells Ned about a woman wanting an incendiary device, and says he showed her how to [[booby trap]] a door. Teddy also says the police have been asking him questions about the apparent arson.\n\nMatty calls Ned and says that Edmund's glasses are in her boathouse. Ned arrives late that night and spots a wire attached to the boathouse door. Matty arrives, and, following a confrontation, Ned asks her to retrieve the glasses. Meanwhile, Oscar Grace arrives and observes their interaction. To prove herself, Matty walks toward the boathouse and disappears from view; the boathouse then explodes. A body found inside is identified as Matty Walker (n\u00e9e Tyler).\n\nNow in prison, Ned, having realized Matty duped him, tries to convince Oscar Grace that she is still alive. He believes that \"Matty\" assumed the real Matty Tyler's identity in order to marry and murder Edmund. Ned surmises the \"Mary Ann Simpson\" that Ned previously met had discovered the scheme and was [[blackmail]]ing Matty, only to be murdered and her body used to identify her as Edmund's wife. Had Ned been killed in the boathouse explosion as Matty likely intended, he reasons the police would have found both suspects' bodies.\n\nIn the epilogue, Ned, in prison, obtains a copy of Matty's high school [[yearbook]]: in it are photos of Mary Ann Simpson and Matty Tyler, confirming his suspicion that Mary Ann assumed Matty Walker's identity. Below Mary Ann's photo is the nickname \"[[Femme fatale|The Vamp]]\" and \"Ambition&mdash;To be rich and live in an exotic land\".\n\nIn the final scene, the real Mary Ann (Matty) is seen lounging on a tropical beach. A man beside her makes a remark about the heat, and she acknowledges. She does not look happy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Hurt]] as Ned Racine\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Matty Tyler Walker\n* [[Richard Crenna]] as Edmund Walker\n* [[Ted Danson]] as Assistant Deputy Prosecutor Peter Lowenstein\n* [[J.

Additional scenes were shot on [[Hollywood Beach, Florida]], such as the scene set in a [[band shell]].\n\nThere was originally more graphic and extensive sex scene footage, but this was shown only in an early premiere, including in West Palm Beach, the area where it was filmed, and was later edited out for wider distribution. In an interview, ''Body Heat'' film editor Carol Littleton says, \"Obviously, there was more graphic footage. But we felt that less was more.\"\n\n==Music==\nIn late 1980, [[Lawrence Kasdan]] met with four composers whose works he had admired, but only John Barry presented ideas which were close to the director's own. 10 demos were recorded on March 31 and Barry wrote the whole score during April and early May 1981. The composer provided several themes and leitmotifs\u2014the most memorable was \"Main Theme\", heard during the main titles and representing Matty.<ref>Jon Burlingame, liner notes from ''Film Score Monthly's'' ''Body Heat'' CD (FSM Vol. 15, No. 4, pp. 4, 6-7)</ref>\n\nBarry worked closely with recording sessions engineer [[Dan Wallin]] to mix the soundtrack album, but for several reasons J.S Lasher (who produced the limited-edition LP and CD) remixed multitracks himself without Barry's or Wallin's participation.<ref>Jon Burlingame, liner notes from ''Film Score Monthly's'' ''Body Heat'' CD (FSM Vol. 15, No. 4, pp. 13-14)</ref>\n\nJ.S Lasher's album was released several times: as a 45 RPM (Southern Cross LXSE 1.002) in 1983 and as a CD (Label X LXCD 2) in 1989. Both editions also included 'Ladd Company Logo' composed and conducted by [[John Williams]].\n\nIn 1998, [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] released a re-recording by [[Joel McNeely]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. This CD contained several new tracks (versus J.S Lasher's editions), but still was not complete.\n\nIn August 2012, ''[[Film Score Monthly]]'' released a definitive two-disc edition: the complete score with alternate, unused, and source cues on disc 1, and the original, Barry-authorized album and theme demos on disc 2.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/cds/detail.cfm?cdID=486 | title = ''Body Heat'' | magazine = [[Film Score Monthly]] | access-date = October 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Body Heat'' was a commercial success.

And beyond that there isn't much to move the story along or to draw these characters together. A great deal of the distance between [Ned and Matty] can be attributed to the performance of Miss Turner, who looks like the quintessential forties siren, but sounds like the [[Soap opera|soap-opera]] actress she is. Miss Turner keeps her chin high in the air, speaks in a perfect monotone, and never seems to move from the position in which Mr. Kasdan has left her.<ref>{{cite news|title=Body Heat|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/28/movies/body-heat.html|first=Janet|last=Maslin|author-link=Janet Maslin|date=August 28, 1981|newspaper= The New York Times|access-date=2011-08-30}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Pauline Kael]] dismissed the film, citing its \"insinuating, hotted-up dialogue that it would be fun to hoot at if only the hushed, sleepwalking manner of the film didn't make you cringe or yawn\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Pauline|last=Kael|authorlink=Pauline Kael|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/09/entertainment/et-erotic9|title=An appeal powered by steam|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 9, 2005|access-date=August 30, 2011}}</ref> Ebert responded to Kael's negative review when he added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list: <blockquote>Yes, Lawrence Kasdan's ''Body Heat'' (1981) is aware of the films that inspired it\u2014especially [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Double Indemnity]]'' (1944). But it has a power that transcends its sources. It exploits the personal style of its stars to insinuate itself; Kael is unfair to Turner, who in her debut role played a woman so sexually confident that we can believe her lover (William Hurt) could be dazed into doing almost anything for her.
