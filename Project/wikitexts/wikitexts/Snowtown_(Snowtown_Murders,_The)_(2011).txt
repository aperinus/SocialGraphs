One day, his mother's boyfriend takes [[Child pornography|indecent photographs of the boys]]. When the police are reluctant to intervene, Elizabeth is contacted by Barry (Richard Green), a gay cross-dressing man who introduces her to John ([[Daniel Henshall]]). John, who despises [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]] and [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], continually harasses the boyfriend via means such as throwing kangaroo's blood and body parts at his house until he moves away. John begins to assume the role of Jamie's father figure. Barry tells John the names and addresses of paedophiles in the area, and John creates a wall with pictures and details about each, including notes saying things like \"I'm coming for you\".\n\nJamie finds himself slowly drawn into John's [[homophobia|homophobic]] and violent tendencies, unable to escape his charismatic and intimidating dominance. On one occasion, John, aware that Jamie is being raped by his brother Troy, wants Jamie to stand up for himself, and in pursuit of this, gives him a gun and has Jamie shoot his dog. John meanwhile influences the rest of the neighbourhood with his extremely homophobic views, and separates Barry from his younger boyfriend Robert (Aaron Viergever). Only Troy seems to dislike John. Barry soon disappears, leaving behind only an answering machine message saying that he is going to [[Queensland]]. John brings Jamie in as the neophyte member of his small team who \"bury men\".\n\nShortly afterward, Jamie visits his drug-addicted best friend Gavin (Bob Adriaens) with John, who takes a dislike to Gavin. Later one night, John and Robert take Jamie into his garden shed and show him the bodies of Barry and Gavin. Distressed, Jamie lashes out at John but remains under his influence. Later, John and Robert torture Troy, and Jamie then kills the brutalised Troy in an act of mercy. Now desensitized, Jamie assists John in carrying out several murders. John and his team store the bodies in the vault of an abandoned bank in the town of [[Snowtown, South Australia|Snowtown]].\n\nJamie is persuaded by John to lure his half-brother Dave (Beau Gosling) to the bank building, ostensibly to look at a computer for sale. Jamie drives with him to the town, vaguely conscious of what he is doing, and leads Dave into the building, where he is met by John and Robert. Unaware of what is going on, Dave watches Jamie shut the door of the bank.\n\nAgainst a black screen, captions reveal that [[South Australia Police]] discovered the remains of eight people stored in barrels in the bank vault of Snowtown on 20 May 1999, and the following day, John Bunting and Robert Wagner were arrested.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Daniel Henshall]] as John Bunting\n* Lucas Pittaway<ref name=fakediyinterview /> as James \"Jamie\" Vlassakis\n* Aaron Viergever as Robert Wagner\n* David Walker as Mark Haydon\n* [[Louise Harris]] as Elizabeth Harvey\n* Keiran Schwerdt as Thomas Trevilyan\n* Bob Adriaens as Gavin\n* Frank Cwiertniak as Jeffrey\n* Matthew Howard as Nicholas\n* Marcus Howard as Alex\n* Anthony Groves as Troy\n* Richard Green as Barry\n* Beau Gosling as Dave\n* Craig Coyne as Ray\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Screen Australia]] announced in March 2010 that it would be funding the film<ref name=\"Screen Australia - 22Mar2010 - Screen Australia funding approvals announced\">{{cite web |url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2010/mr_100322_approvals.aspx |title=Screen Australia funding approvals announced |date=22 March 2010 |publisher=[[Screen Australia]] |access-date=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402091702/https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2010/mr_100322_approvals.aspx |archive-date=2 April 2011}}</ref> and [[Film Victoria]] provided $245,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/vic-govt-to-fund-snowtown-murders-film-20100303-phlf.html |title=Vic govt to fund Snowtown murders film |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=13 December 2011 }}</ref> The film was produced by Warp Films Australia,<ref>{{cite news |first=Samela |last=Harris |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/movies/snowtown-a-triumph-for-aussie-movie-making/story-e6freeuc-1226219484740 |title=Snowtown a triumph for Aussie movie making |work=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |date=12 December 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011 }}</ref> a collaboration between [[Warp Films]] and distributor [[Madman Entertainment]].\n\nPeter Campbell of Warp Films Australia had to get the remaining [[Gag order|suppression orders]] lifted so the film could be premiered.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/snowtown-suppression-orders-lifted-for-film/story-e6frfkvr-1225991954297 |agency=Australian Associated Press|title=Snowtown suppression orders lifted for film |date=20 January 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Verity |last=Edwards |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/judge-clears-way-for-snowtown-film/story-e6frg6nf-1225991966935 |title=Judge clears way for Snowtown film |work=[[The Australian]] |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n''Snowtown'' is Kurzel's first feature-length film as director.<ref name=fakediyinterview /> His [[short film]] ''Bluetongue'' was shown at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Screen Australia - 22Mar2010 - Screen Australia funding approvals announced\"/>\n\nApart from Henshall and Green, the actors were locals with no acting experience, whom Kurzel had found in the area where the murders occurred, with most from [[Davoren Park, South Australia|Davoren Park]].

Davoren Park is considered one of the most violent and dysfunctional suburbs in Australia and a place where emergency vehicles fear to go without a police escort.
