It was considered a trendsetting film at the time of its release and became one of the year's biggest box-office hits. The film follows a middle-aged man who becomes infatuated with a young woman whom he has never met, leading to a comic chase and an encounter in Mexico.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring a surprise 42nd birthday party for the wealthy and famous composer George Webber thrown by his actress girlfriend Samantha Taylor, George finds that he is coping badly with his age. From his car, George glimpses a bride on her way to be married and is instantly obsessed with her beauty. Following her to the church, he crashes into a police cruiser, is stung by a bee and nearly disrupts the wedding ceremony.\n\nLater that night, Sam and George argue over his treatment of women and his habit of spying on the intimate acts of a neighbor (which later turns out to be consensual).\n\nGeorge visits the reverend who performed the wedding and learns that the woman is Jenny Miles, daughter of a prominent [[Beverly Hills]] dentist.\n\nThe following day, while spying on his neighbor, George hits himself with the telescope and falls down an embankment, causing him to miss Sam's phone call. Still obsessed with Jenny, he schedules a dental appointment with her father and learns that Jenny and her husband David have gone to Mexico for their [[honeymoon]]. The effects of a comically implausible amount of treatment accompanied by a heavy dose of [[novocaine]], aggravated by immediate heavy drinking, leave George completely incoherent. Sam finally reaches him on the phone, but mistakes him for an intruder and calls the police, who hold George at gunpoint while trying to understand his gibberish. George visits his neighbor's house to take part in an ongoing orgy, but Sam spots him through his telescope, widening the rift between them.\n\nGeorge impulsively boards a plane to follow the newlyweds to their exclusive resort in Mexico. In the bar, George encounters old acquaintance Mary Lewis, who lacks self-confidence. When they attempt a fling, Mary interprets George's inadequacy in bed as confirmation of her own insecurities.\n\nAt the beach, George sees Jenny in a swimsuit and is awestruck again by her beauty. Noticing that her husband has fallen asleep on a surfboard, George rents a [[catamaran]] and rescues David, making him a hero. Sam sees George on a TV newscast and tries to contact him unsuccessfully. David is hospitalized with [[sunburn]], allowing Jenny and George to spend time alone together. Jenny smokes marijuana and seduces George, but he is horrified when Jenny takes a call from David and casually informs him of George's presence. George is even more confused with David's complete lack of concern. Jenny explains their open and honest relationship and reveals that she married David only because of pressure from her conservative father. George leaves after realizing that Jenny sees their tryst as nothing more than a casual fling.\n\nAfter flying home, George reconciles with Sam by apologizing and demonstrating a new maturity. George takes an idea from Jenny when he starts ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]'' on his phonograph (lasting {{frac|15|1|4}} minutes, an appropriate duration for lovemaking) and he makes love with Sam in full view of the neighbor's telescope, but the neighbor, frustrated that he provides erotic entertainment for George and gets nothing in return, is by now not watching.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dudley Moore]] as George Webber\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as Samantha Taylor\n* [[Bo Derek]] as Jenny Hanley\n* [[Robert Webber]] as Hugh\n* [[Dee Wallace]] as Mary Lewis\n* [[Sam J.
