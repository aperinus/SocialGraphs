Throughout the film, Troy learns life lessons through her rowdy brothers Clinton, Wendell, Nate, and Joseph; her loving but strict mother Carolyn ([[Alfre Woodard]]), and her naive, struggling father Woody ([[Delroy Lindo]]).\n\nA distinctive characteristic of ''Crooklyn'' is its [[Crooklyn (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], composed completely of music from the 1960s and 70s, except the hit single \"Crooklyn\" by the [[Crooklyn Dodgers]], a rap crew composed of [[Buckshot (rapper)|Buckshot]], [[Masta Ace]], and [[Special Ed]]. A two-volume release of the soundtrack became available on CD along with the release of the film.\n\nSimilarly to his past films such as ''[[School Daze]]'', ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', and ''[[She's Gotta Have It]]'', Spike Lee appears in ''Crooklyn'', playing a young [[Inhalant|glue huffer]] named Snuffy, who likes to bully the local children.\n\n''Crooklyn'' is the second of only two films directed by Spike Lee to earn a PG-13 rating in the USA, along with ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]''.\n\nNew Yorkers selected the film for simultaneous screenings across New York City as part of the 2017 One Film, One New York contest.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1973, nine-year-old Troy Carmichael and her brothers Clinton, Wendell, Nate, and Joseph live in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn with their parents Woody, a struggling musician, and Carolyn, a schoolteacher. The neighborhood is filled with colorful characters, such as the Carmichaels' next-door neighbor Tony Eyes, whose house emits the foul smell of dog feces; Tommy La-La, who continuously sings and plays his electric keyboard; glue sniffers Snuffy and Right Hand Man; and war veteran Vic Powell, who lives upstairs and rents from the Carmichaels.\n\nOne day, the Carmichael children get into an argument with Tony after he witnesses Wendell throwing trash into his area, which escalates when Carolyn and several neighborhood children get involved and is defused when Vic comes downstairs and then punches Tony in the face. Troy, who has sneaked out to the corner store, sees Vic getting arrested as she leaves the store.\n\nOne night, Woody and Carolyn argue about money; Carolyn resents Woody for not appreciating their financial situation and using their money carelessly to fund his solo career. The argument escalates as Carolyn yells for the children to turn off the television, before later turning it off herself.\n\nClinton turns his back on Carolyn and she grabs him for disobeying. Woody then grabs her and carries her out of the room. Woody carries Carolyn out of the room and down the stairs and Nate jumps on Woody's back. The other children hold Carolyn and Carolyn hurts her ankle in the struggle.\n\nCarolyn kicks Woody out of the house, but Woody later brings flowers to Carolyn and the two reconcile. The family then decides to go on a trip, but as they are leaving, a worker from Con Ed arrives to shut off the electricity due to an unpaid bill, postponing the trip and forcing the family to use candles for light.\n\nA few days later, the family travels to the South to stay with affluent relatives. Troy stays with her cousin, Viola, who was adopted by Uncle Clem and Aunt Song. Troy has fun with Viola despite disliking her [[snobby]] Aunt Song and her dog, Queenie. On Troy's tenth birthday, she gets a letter from Carolyn. After reading the letter and dealing with constant bickering between Viola and Aunt Song, Troy decides she wants to go home.\n\nWhen Troy returns to New York, her Aunt Maxine and Uncle Brown pick her up at the airport. Troy later learns her mother is in the hospital and is taken to see her.\n\nLater that evening, Woody tells the kids that their mother has cancer and must stay in the hospital. The boys cry, but Troy remains stoic. Troy then begins filling in the mother role, while Carolyn remains in the hospital but later dies.\n\nAftwards, one of Troy's brothers wonders if they have to dress up for their mother's funeral. On the day of the funeral, Troy's Aunt Maxine coaxes her into trying on the new clothes she's brought, telling her it would make Carolyn proud. Troy calmly explains that her mother hates polyester and would never let her wear it then announces to Woody that she is not going to the funeral. After Woody explains that Carolyn would want them all together at church, Troy acquiesces.\n\nAt the house gathering after the funeral, Troy is withdrawn. Joseph comes inside crying, saying that Snuffy and Right Hand Man robbed him. Following her mother's wishes to protect her younger brother, Troy goes outside with a baseball bat and hits Snuffy, telling him to go sniff glue on his own block.\n\nEarly the next morning, Troy dreams she's hearing her mother's voice. She goes downstairs to see her father trying to kill a rat in the kitchen. Woody then tells her that it is all right to cry, saying that even Clinton has cried. Troy concludes that it is good that her mother's suffering has ended.\n\nAs the summer ends, the Carmichael family and their friends resume their lives. Troy assumes the matriarch role that Carolyn left behind. Carolyn's spirit continues to visit Troy, praising her for taking on such responsibilities.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per opening tombstone credits, order and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Alfre Woodard]] as Carolyn\n*[[Delroy Lindo]] as Woody\n*[[David Patrick Kelly]] as Tony Eyes\n*[[Zelda Harris]] as Troy\n*Carlton Williams as Clinton\n*Sharif Rashed as Wendell\n*Tse-Mach Washington as Joseph\n*[[Chris Knowings]] as Nate \n*[[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] as Tommy La La\n*[[Isaiah Washington]] as Vic Powell\n*Ivelka Reyes as Jessica\n*[[Spike Lee]] as Snuff\n*N.

They have died because the kids in comparable neighborhoods today are afraid to go outside and play in the streets. ''Crooklyn'' is not in any way an angry film.
