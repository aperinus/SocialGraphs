The group enters a room and sits at individual desks. Each desk has a paper printed with the word \"candidate\" and a number from one to eight. The [[Exam invigilator|Invigilator]] explains that they have 80 minutes to answer one question, but there are three rules: the candidates must not spoil their paper, leave the room, or talk to him or the armed guard at the door. If they do, they will be disqualified. The Invigilator asks them if they have any questions, then leaves.\n\nAs the exam starts, it turns out that the papers are otherwise blank. Within minutes, a candidate is disqualified for spoiling her paper by writing on it. The seven remaining candidates realize it is permissible to talk to each other and collaborate. One candidate, \"White\", assigns nicknames to each candidate based on hair color and skin color: Black, Blonde, Brown, Brunette, Dark, and Deaf (for one candidate who does not speak or respond to the group).\n\nIn the hour that follows, the candidates use lights, bodily fluids, and fire sprinklers in attempts to reveal hidden text on their papers, to no avail. They speculate on the exam's purpose and the nature of the company. Dark claims that the CEO is highly secretive and has not been seen since the [[initial public offering]]. It is gradually revealed that the company is responsible for a miracle drug designed to treat a condition afflicting a large part of the population due to a viral [[pandemic]]. In the chaos, White takes control of the group and engineers the disqualifications of Brunette and Deaf for spoiled papers.\n\nWhite also begins taunting the others, saying he has figured out the question but will not tell them. In response, Black knocks White unconscious and ties him to a chair. As White passes out, he pleads for his medication, implying he has the virus. Brown turns his attention to Dark, who demonstrates knowledge of the company's internal workings, and tortures her into revealing that she works for the company. It is revealed that Black is a carrier of the disease. White goes into convulsions, proving he has the disease. Dark pleads to the Invigilator for help and is disqualified.\n\nBlonde retrieves White's medication, which was stolen from him earlier by Brown, and uses it to revive him. The others release White and demand to know the question. White suggests that there is no question and the company will simply hire the last remaining candidate. Black steals the guard's gun, but it requires the guard's fingerprint to fire, giving White time to retrieve it. By forcing the guard's hand into the trigger, White coerces Brown to leave the room, disqualifying him. As Blonde also exits, she turns off the voice-activated lights, allowing Black to attack White.\n\nThe lights come back on after Black is hit by a gunshot. Blonde hides in the hallway, still holding one foot inside the room. Before White can kill her, the exam timer runs to zero. White addresses the Invigilator, sure of his success, but is disqualified. It is revealed that Deaf had earlier removed a few minutes from the countdown clock. Blonde remembers that Deaf had been using glasses and a piece of broken glass with an exam paper earlier. Taking the abandoned glasses, she finds the phrase \"Question 1.\" on the exam paper in minuscule writing. Blonde realizes that Question 1 refers to the only question asked of the group by the Invigilator at the beginning of the test (\"Any questions?\"). Blonde answers \"No.\"\n\nThe Invigilator enters and reveals that Deaf is the CEO of the company. He found the virus cure but also discovered a method of rapid cell regeneration capable of providing \"the gift of life\". The bullet that hit Black contained this cure, reviving him. With high demand for the drug and a limited supply, the company needed an administrator capable of making tough decisions with attention to detail while showing compassion, all traits that Blonde displayed during the exam. Blonde accepts the job.\n\n==Cast==\n* John Lloyd Fillingham as Candidate 1, Deaf\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as Candidate 2, Asian \n* Adar Beck as Candidate 3, Dark\n* [[Pollyanna McIntosh]] as Candidate 4, Brunette\n* [[Luke Mably]] as Candidate 5, White\n* [[Jimi Mistry]] as Candidate 6, Brown\n* [[Nathalie Cox]] as Candidate 7, Blonde\n* [[Chukwudi Iwuji|Chukwudi Iwuji]] as Candidate 8, Black\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as The Invigilator\n* Chris Carey as The Guard\n\n==Production==\nAfter seeing some of his friends' films fail due to studio interference, Stuart Hazeldine decided that he wanted full control over his feature debut.<ref name=\"twitch\">{{cite web|title=Stuart Hazeldine: British Filmmaker, Hollywood Screenwriter|first=Joshua|last=Chaplinsky|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2010/11/stuart-hazeldine-british-filmmaker-hollywood-screenwriter.html|date=16 November 2010|work=[[Twitch Film]]|access-date=25 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910103635/http://twitchfilm.com/2010/11/stuart-hazeldine-british-filmmaker-hollywood-screenwriter.html|archive-date=10 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The original story involved an exam at a school, but Stuart Hazeldine changed it to be a job interview.  The ending is also Hazeldine's creation, as the original story didn't have one.  Hazeldine wanted to separate the characters by race, culture, gender, and, especially, worldview.<ref name=\"skinny\">{{cite journal|title=Stuart Hazeldine's Exam: No Bathroom Breaks Allowed|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/film/features/98306-stuart_hazeldines_exam_no_bathroom_breaks_allowed|last=Bartlett|first=Becky|date=5 January 2010|journal=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]|access-date=25 August 2013}}</ref>  The film's pandemic was influenced by contemporary fears of bird flu and distrust of pharmaceutical companies.  Originally, the script had more science fiction elements, but Hazeldine stripped them out to keep the film grounded.  About the twist ending, Hazeldine said he wanted the film to be about more than just the twist, and he tried to appeal to audiences who seek a story about human nature.<ref name=twitch/>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered in June 2009 as part of the [[Edinburgh Film Festival]]<ref name=screen/> and was then part of the [[Raindance Film Festival]] 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/02/raindance-film-festival-steven-soderbergh|title=Raindance Film Festival Hopes to Take London by Storm|first=Ben|last=Walters|date=2 September 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=25 August 2013}}</ref> It was released in UK cinemas on 8 January 2010.<ref name=dread/>\n\nOn 11 February 2010, [[IFC Films]] acquired the rights for the US release, where it was released as part of the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite journal|last=Loewenstein|first=Lael|title=Review: \"Exam\"|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=16 February 2010|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/exam-1117942218/|access-date=25 August 2013}}</ref> The DVD and Blu-ray were released in the UK on 7 June 2010.<ref name=\"ukdvd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37590/uk-dvd-and-blu-ray-specs-stuart-hazeldines-exam|title=UK DVD and Blu-Ray Specs for Stuart Hazeldine's Exam|last=Moore|first=Debi|date=18 May 2010|work=[[Dread Central]]|access-date=25 August 2013}}</ref> There was no theatrical release in the US, but IFC Films released the film via [[video on demand]] on 23 July 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20896|title=U.S. Trailer for IFC Films' 'Exam'|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|first=Brad|last=Miska|date=14 July 2010|access-date=25 August 2013}}</ref> and on DVD on 16 November 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38526/official-one-sheet-and-trailer-ifcs-exam|title=Official One-Sheet and Trailer \u2013 IFC's Exam|first=Steve|last=Barton|date=14 July 2010|work=[[Dread Central]]|access-date=25 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 September 2012, a stage adaptation of the film opened in [[Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hepworth|first=Craig|title=EXAM -
