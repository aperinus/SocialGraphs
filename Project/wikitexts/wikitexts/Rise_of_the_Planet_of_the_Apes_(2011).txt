It stars [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]], alongside [[James Franco]], [[Freida Pinto]], [[John Lithgow]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Tom Felton]], and [[David Oyelowo]]. In the film, Caesar, a chimpanzee genetically enhanced and raised by William Rodman (Franco), goes from son to sheltered, and eventually leads an ape uprising against members of humanity.\n\n''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' first entered development in 2006 when Jaffa and Silver wrote a [[spec script|screenplay]] and sold it to [[20th Century Fox]], the producers and distributors of the original franchise. The film features homages and drew inspiration from previous entries, particularly ''[[Conquest of the Planet of the Apes]]'' (1972). [[Development hell|Production struggled]] until Franco, Serkis, and Wyatt were hired by late 2009, and [[principal photography]] started in July 2010 and finished that September, with filming locations including [[Vancouver]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Oahu]]. The apes were created using extensive [[visual effects]] and [[motion capture|performance capture]] commissioned by [[Weta Digital]].\n\n''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' was theatrically released worldwide by 20th Century Fox on August 5, 2011. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Wyatt's direction, visual effects, and Serkis' performance, which helped change perceptions on the recognition of acting through performance capture. ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' was also a commercial success, grossing over $481 million, and received numerous awards and nominations, including an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. It helped relaunch the franchise, and was followed by the sequel films ''[[Dawn of the Planet of the Apes]]'' (2014) and ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]'' (2017). A fourth film, ''[[Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes]]'', is set to release on May 24, 2024.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn [[San Francisco]], pharmaceutical [[chemist]] William Rodman is testing the viral-based drug ALZ-112 on chimpanzees at the biotech company Gen-Sys to find a cure for [[Alzheimer's disease]]. ALZ-112 is given to a chimpanzee named Bright Eyes, greatly increasing her intelligence. However, during Will's presentation for the drug, Bright Eyes is forced from her cage, goes on a rampage, and is shot to death. Will's boss Steven Jacobs terminates the project and has the chimpanzees euthanized. However, Will's assistant Robert Franklin reveals that the reason for Bright Eyes' rampage was that she had recently given birth to an infant chimpanzee. Will reluctantly takes in the chimpanzee, eventually giving him the name [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]]. Discovering that Caesar has inherited his mother's intelligence through being exposed to ALZ-112 before birth, Will decides to raise him. Three years pass, and Caesar becomes highly intelligent and can play games, draw pictures, and communicate with Will through [[sign language]]. Will introduces Caesar to the [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] forest at [[Muir Woods National Monument]] so he can roam. Meanwhile, Will treats his father, Charles, with ALZ-112, which seems to restore his cognitive ability.\n\nFive years later, Caesar, now a young adolescent, questions if he is a pet and learns of his origins from Will. Meanwhile, Charles' condition returns as his immune system becomes resistant to ALZ-112. Caesar injures an aggressive neighbor, Douglas Hunsiker, while defending a confused Charles. As a result, animal control arrives and takes him away to an ape shelter. Due to his difference in appearance and relative lack of interaction with other apes, Caesar is tormented by the alpha chimpanzee, Rocket, and the chief guard, Dodge Landon. However, Caesar also befriends Maurice, a former [[circus]] orangutan who also knows sign language. Caesar learns how to unlock his cage, gaining free access to the common area. With the assistance of Buck, a gorilla, he confronts Rocket and claims the position of the alpha chimpanzee. Meanwhile, Jacobs clears the development of a more powerful gaseous version of the drug, the ALZ-113, when Will tells him it can improve intelligence. Will takes the drug home for his father, but Charles declines further treatment and dies overnight. After attempting to test the drug on a scarred bonobo test subject named [[Koba (Planet of the Apes)|Koba]], Franklin becomes exposed to ALZ-113 and becomes ill.\n\nAttempting to warn Will at his home, he sneezes blood onto Hunsiker and is later discovered dead. Will attempts to reclaim Caesar, but Caesar instead decides to stay and steals the ALZ-113 canisters from Will's house and enhances the intelligence of the other apes in the sanctuary. When Dodge attempts to get him back into his cage, Caesar speaks for the first time, shouting \"No\" and fights with Dodge while freeing the apes, which inadvertently leads to Dodge's death. The apes flee the facility, releasing Koba and the remaining apes from Gen-Sys, and freeing more apes from the [[San Francisco Zoo]]. A battle ensues as the apes fight their way past a police blockade on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in an attempt to escape into the redwood forest. To rescue Caesar, Buck sacrifices himself to wreck a police helicopter in which Jacobs is riding. Koba then pushes Jacobs into the [[Golden Gate|Golden Gate strait]] to his death.\n\nAs the apes find their way into the forest, Will catches up to them in a stolen police car and warns Caesar that the humans will hunt them down, begging him to return home. In response, Caesar hugs him and says, \"Caesar is home\". Realizing that this is their last goodbye, Will respects Caesar's wishes. The apes embrace their new lifestyle in the forest as news and police helicopters fly over San Francisco. Meanwhile, Hunsiker, now infected with ALZ-113, arrives at [[San Francisco International Airport]] for his flight to [[Paris]]. He eventually spreads the virus around the globe to international flight routes, leading to a deadly [[pandemic]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | alt footer=Photographs of James Franco and Andy Serkis  |footer = [[James Franco]] in 2013 (left) and [[Andy Serkis]] in 2017 (right)\n   | image1 = James Franco 4, 2013.jpg\n   | image2 = Andy Serkis by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n  }}\n<!-- Cast list as shown in the order at end of film -->\n* [[James Franco]] as Dr. William \"Will\" Rodman, a [[chemist]] who is trying to discover a cure for his father's [[Alzheimer's disease]] by testing ALZ-112 on chimpanzees; he is a father figure to Caesar.

As Jaffa searched a newspaper articles [[Clipping (publications)|clipping]], one about [[Pet monkey|pet chimpanzees]] that become troublesome to their owners and heartbroken for not adapting well to the human environment intrigued him. As Jaffa eventually realized it fit the ''Planet of the Apes'' series, he called his wife and screenwriting partner Amanda Silver to express his ideas of such a chimpanzee eventually starting the ape revolution, and then the couple started developing the character of [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]]. Jaffa indicated that \"it's a reinvention\" and if he had to pick between calling it a prequel or a reboot he would say it is a reboot: \"It's a different story of who Caesar is, and how he came to be. So it's really kind of hard to put a label on it. We are hopefully rebooting it.\" He went on to say that \"we tried really hard to create a story that would stand on its own and yet also pay homage and honor the movies that came before us.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Hasan |first= Zaki |date= August 17, 2011 |title= Exclusive Interview: Rise of the Planet of the Apes Writers Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa |url= https://www.huffingtonpost.com/zaki-hasan/exclusive-interview-rise-_b_925944.html |newspaper= [[The Huffington Post]] |access-date= September 1, 2014}}</ref> Jaffa and Silver then wrote a script and sold it to Fox, producers of the ''Apes'' franchise.

Actor-stuntman [[Terry Notary]] guided the actors on realistic ape movement, while Weta studied the chimps in the [[Wellington Zoo]] for reference. The digital apes also received detailed models with skeletons, muscles and nerve tissue layers for accurate animation. Cast models of apes' heads and limbs helped the texture department replicate skin details such as wrinkles and pores. Given the difference between human and chimpanzee facial muscles, the animators tweaked the performance through a new facial muscle system adding dynamics, ballistics, and secondary motion. As the silent performance required expressive eyes, a new eye model was made to depict both greater accuracy in muscle movement in and around the eyes, and also tears, [[Pupillary response|pupil dilation]], and light refraction.<ref name=gen/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/article/weta-digital-monkey-business|title=Weta Digital Monkey Business|work=Animation World Network|access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref> While [[Andy Serkis]] was the primary performer for Caesar, as the effects team considered that at times \"Andy overcame the character,\" other motion capture team actors were also used, especially [[Devyn Dalton]], whose height matched that of a chimpanzee.

To turn the score into a \"driving force that keeps audiences paying attention,\" Doyle employed an African-American chorus and focused on percussion and \"low and deep\" orchestra sounds.
