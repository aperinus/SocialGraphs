The screenplay is based on [[Vampire Hunter D Volume 1|the first]] in the [[Vampire Hunter D|long-running series]] of [[light novels]] written by [[Hideyuki Kikuchi]].\n\nBilled by the Japanese producers as a \"dark future science-fiction romance\", the film, like the novel before it, is set in the year 12,090 AD, in a [[Nuclear holocaust|post-nuclear holocaust]] world where a young woman hires a mysterious half-vampire, half-human vampire hunter to protect her from a powerful vampire lord. It was one of several anime films featured in the music video for [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] and [[Janet Jackson]]'s song \"[[Scream (Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson song)|Scream]]\".\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Film summaries must be less than 700 words. -->\nWhile walking her guard rounds in the country, Doris Lang, the orphaned daughter of a deceased werewolf hunter, is attacked and bitten by Count Magnus Lee, a 10,000-year-old, long-lost vampire lord (also known as a Noble) for trespassing in his domain.\n\nDoris later encounters a mysterious vampire hunter, known only as D. Infected from Count Lee's bite, she hires D to kill the vampire and save her from becoming one. While in town with D and her younger brother Dan, Doris is confronted by Greco Roman. Greco is the mayor's son and promises to help if he has Doris for himself, but she refuses. D requests that the authorities, including Greco's father, the town sheriff, and Dr. Feringo, should hold off Doris\u2019 incarceration at the local asylum until he kills Count Lee.\n\nThat night, Doris's farm is attacked by Rei Ginsei, Count Lee's servant, and L'Armica, Count Lee's daughter, who is highly prejudiced against humans and dhampirs. During the battle, Rei reveals he has the ability to twist space around him. Because of this powers, D's attacks are redirected onto himself. Fortunately, D turns out to be a [[dhampir]] and can recover in seconds. After defeating the vampires, he orders them to leave with a warning to Count Lee. The next day, D travels to Count Lee's castle and attempts to confront him. Aided by the symbiote in his Left Hand, D holds his own against the Count's monstrous minions. Doris is then kidnapped by Rei and brought to the Count. Using his vampiric powers, D rescues Doris and escapes the castle.\n\nLater, Greco overhears a meeting. In it, a messenger from Count Lee gives Rei a candle with Time-Bewitching Incense, a substance powerful enough to weaken anyone with vampire blood. Rei takes Dan hostage to lure D out into the open, and D comes to his rescue, cutting off Rei's hand in the process and discovering that the candle is a fake. Meanwhile, Dr. Feringo turns out to be a vampire in league with Count Lee. He leads Doris into a trap but is killed by L'Armica after requesting to share Doris with the Count. Greco, who stole the candle from Rei, then appears and uses it to weaken L'Armica and cause Doris pain (likely due to her own infection). He is then shot at by Dan and falls down a cliff. Afterwards, Doris, who has by now fallen for D, tries to convince him to live with her and embraces him. This triggers D's vampire side, and he forces her away from him, unwilling to bite her.\n\nThe next morning, Rei kills Greco and uses the real candle to weaken D. Rei then mortally wounds the vampire hunter with a wooden stake. Doris is captured and taken back to the castle. Rei requests that the Count give him eternal life as a member of the Nobility, but is coldly rebuffed for his past failures. This makes Rei become enraged.\n\nAs a mutant attempts to devour D's comatose body, his Left Hand revives him just in time for him to kill the monster. As the processional for the Count and Doris\u2019 wedding takes place, Dan infiltrates the castle and attempts to attack Lee. Unfortunately, he fails and falls into a chasm before being saved by Rei, who has switched sides. Rei attempts to weaken the Count with the candle. However, Lee is too powerful and destroys it with his telekinetic abilities before killing Rei. Before Doris can be bitten by the Count, D appears and fights Lee. D's attacks are futile due to Lee's psychic abilities. About to be killed, D unleashes his own telekinetic power and succeeds in stabbing Lee in the heart. With Lee dying, his castle begins crumbling. D tries to persuade L'Armica into living as a human, but she chooses to die with her father and stays in the castle as it falls.\n\nD, Doris, and Dan escape the collapsing castle. D then sets off under a now clear blue sky. Doris, now recovered from her bite, and Dan, bid D goodbye as he looks back briefly at them and smiles.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Japanese\n! colspan=\"2\"|English\n|-\n!

The film's limited budget made its technical quality comparable to most anime television series and other OVAs, but not with most theatrical animated films.<ref>{{cite web|author =Fred Patten|author-link =Fred Patten|title =Vampire Hunter D: The Next Anime Hit in America?|publisher =Animation World Magazine|date =December 2000|url =http://www.awn.com/mag/issue5.09/5.09pages/pattenvampd.php3|access-date =August 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the film's production, director Toyoo Ashida stated that his intention for the film was to create an OVA that people who had been tired from studying or working hard would enjoy watching, instead of watching something that would make them \"feel even more tired\".<ref name=\"making\">{{cite AV media|title = ''The Making of Vampire Hunter D''|medium = DVD|publisher = [[Madman Entertainment]]|date = August 31, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|people = [[Toyoo Ashida]] (director), Hideyuki Kikuchi (original work)|title = ''Vampire Hunter D - Special Edition''|medium = DVD|time= 44 minutes, 3 seconds|publisher = [[Madman Entertainment]]|date = August 31, 2005}}</ref>\n\n[[Yoshitaka Amano]], the illustrator of the original novels, acted as character designer for the OVA.
