Dick]]. The film is set in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Northern Virginia]] in the year 2054, where [[Precrime]], a specialized police department, apprehends criminals based on [[wikt:foreknowledge|foreknowledge]] provided by three psychics called \"[[Precognition|precogs]]\". The cast stars [[Tom Cruise]] as Precrime Chief John Anderton, [[Colin Farrell]] as [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] agent Danny Witwer, [[Samantha Morton]] as precog Agatha Lively, and [[Max von Sydow]] as Precrime director Lamar Burgess. The film combines elements of [[tech noir]], [[whodunit]], [[Thriller film|thriller]] and [[science fiction]] genres, as well as a traditional chase film, as the main protagonist is accused of a crime he has not committed and becomes a fugitive.<ref name=\"whodunit\">Buckland. pp. 193\u20135.</ref> Spielberg characterized the story as \"fifty percent character and fifty percent very complicated storytelling with layers and layers of murder mystery and plot\".<ref name=\"Ko13\" />\n\nThe film was first [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] in 1992 as a sequel to another Dick adaptation, ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] set to reprise his role as Doug Quaid. But after ''Total Recall'' production company [[Carolco Pictures]] filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]], the project was reworked into a stand-alone project and started its development in 1997, after a script by [[Jon Cohen (writer)|Jon Cohen]] reached Spielberg and Cruise. Production suffered many delays due to Cruise's ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'' and Spielberg's ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence|A.I.]]'' running over schedule, eventually starting in March 2001. During pre-production, Spielberg consulted numerous scientists in an attempt to present a more plausible future world than that seen in other science fiction films, and some of the technology designs in the film have proven prescient.\n\n''Minority Report'' was one of the most anticipated films of 2002 due to the high profile collaboration between Cruise and Spielberg, as well as a surge in blockbusters in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Upon its release, the film grossed over $358 million against a production budget of $102 million, becoming [[2002 in film|2002's tenth most-successful film worldwide]]. Initial reviews were generally positive. Praise was given to Cruise's performance, Spielberg's directing, action sequences, and visual effects, though some criticism was focused on the running time and the complexity of the plot that critics felt was too difficult for audiences. It was nominated for several awards. It received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and eleven [[Saturn Award]] nominations, including [[Saturn Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], and [[Saturn Award for Best Music]], winning [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Director|Best Direction]], [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]], and [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nSince its release, ''Minority Report'' has been critically re-evaluated and retrospective reviews have called it one of the best films for both Cruise and Spielberg and placed it among the best science fiction films of the 2000s. The film has been analyzed for its themes of [[free will]] versus [[determinism]]; the roles of preventive government in protecting its citizenry; media in a future state where technological advancements make its presence nearly boundless; the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor; and Spielberg's perennial theme of broken families. Along with several media including a [[Minority Report: Everybody Runs|video game]], ''Minority Report'' was followed up by [[Minority Report (TV series)|a television series of the same name]] in 2015, but was canceled in 2016 after one season.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 2054, the federal government plans to nationally implement [[Washington, D.C.]]'s prototype \"Precrime\" police program: as three clairvoyant humans (\"Precogs\") visualize an impending homicide, officers analyze the data to determine the crime's location and apprehend the perpetrator before the crime occurs. The Precogs\u2014Agatha Lively and twins Arthur and Dashiell \"Dash\" Arkadin\u2014lie in a shallow pool, under sleep-inducing drugs that deprive them of external stimuli. Their thoughts are projected onscreen and stored in a database. Would-be killers are imprisoned in a benevolent [[virtual reality]] state. Although Precrime has eliminated nearly all premeditated murders during its six-year existence, spontaneous [[Crime of passion|crimes of passion]] or \"red ball\" killings remain problematic, where police have an hour or less to stop the murder.\n\nJohn Anderton, the commanding officer of Precrime, joined the program after his son, Sean, was kidnapped and never found. He is depressed, withdrawn, addicted to neuroin (a fictional hard drug), and his wife Lara has since left him. While [[United States Department of Justice]] agent Danny Witwer audits the Precrime operation, the Precogs predict that in 36 hours, Anderton will kill Leo Crow, a man whom Anderton never met. Anderton flees the facility, prompting a manhunt led by Witwer.\n\nAnderton visits Precrime founder Dr. Iris Hineman at her home and learns that one Precog occasionally sees a different future vision from the others, known as a \"minority report\". These discrepancies are reviewed and purged from the official record, as group precognition agreement is the foundation of the Precrime bylaws. However, the Precogs still retain their individual memories. Anderton also discovers that early neuroin adopters and addicts had been predisposed to having mentally disabled children, many of whom had precognitive abilities and were tested\u2014often fatally\u2014and three of whom were submitted to Precrime. Anderton returns to Precrime and kidnaps Agatha, described by Hineman as the most clairvoyant Precog, shutting down the [[Group mind (science fiction)|group-mind]] on which Precrime depends. Anderton and Agatha track Crow to a hotel room and find numerous photos of children, including Sean; Anderton accuses Crow of killing Sean, but Crow claims he was hired to plant the photos. He wants Anderton to kill him so that his family can benefit from his death. When Anderton refuses, Crow kills himself in a similar manner to the Precog file.\n\nAnderton fails to find a minority report within Agatha's mind, but discovers a memory of a murder from five years earlier; the victim was Agatha's mother, Anne Lively, who sold her daughter to Precrime while addicted to neuroin. After breaking her addiction, she tried to reclaim Agatha, but was drowned by a hooded figure. Witwer simultaneously investigates the same case independently and learns that two attempts were made on Lively's life: the first was thwarted by Precrime, but the second one succeeded shortly after. Witwer reports his findings to Precrime Director Lamar Burgess, who kills him without being detected since the Precog system is offline. Anderton is captured and imprisoned on suspected murder of Crow and Witwer, and Agatha is reconnected to the system. \n \nDuring a banquet in Burgess's honor, Anderton\u2014released from prison by Lara\u2014contacts him and reveals the truth. Knowing that Precrime cannot function without Agatha, Burgess hired a neuroin addict to kill Anne Lively, and the attempt was stopped by Precrime personnel. Once they departed, Burgess killed Anne Lively in a manner identical to the first attempt and the actual murder footage was deleted by technicians as a misidentified \"echo\".\n\nAfter Agatha is returned to Precrime, a new Precrime report is generated, showing that Burgess will kill Anderton. The two meet and Anderton states the dilemma Burgess now faces: kill him and validate Precrime at the cost of his own freedom, or spare him and see the program be discredited and shut down. Anderton states that Burgess can change his own future since he now knows it. Burgess shoots himself, and asks Anderton for forgiveness.\n\nAnderton and Lara reconcile, with Lara becoming pregnant with another child. Precrime is abandoned and all prisoners are pardoned and released, though many remain under police surveillance. Agatha and the twins are moved to an \"undisclosed location\" to live in peace.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Minority Report cast.jpg|thumb|250px|Members of the cast of ''Minority Report''.
