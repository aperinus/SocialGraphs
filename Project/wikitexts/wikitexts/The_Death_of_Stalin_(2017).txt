Based on the French graphic novel ''[[La Mort de Staline]]'' (2010\u20132012), the film depicts the internal social and political power struggle among the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Council of Ministers]] following the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Soviet leader]] [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953. The British-French-Belgian co-production stars an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Simon Russell Beale]], [[Paddy Considine]], [[Rupert Friend]], [[Jason Isaacs]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Andrea Riseborough]], [[Paul Whitehouse]], [[Olga Kurylenko]], and [[Jeffrey Tambor]].\n\n''The Death of Stalin'' was screened at the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival]] and received critical acclaim. It was released in the United Kingdom by [[Entertainment One Films]] on 20 October 2017, in France by [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] on 4 April 2018 and in Belgium by September Film Distribution on 18 April 2018. The film was banned in [[Russia]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]] for allegedly mocking the countries' past and making fun of their leaders.<ref name=\"HReport_2018-02-23\" /> It received various awards, including two [[British Academy Film Award]] nominations for [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Outstanding British Film]] as well as 13 [[British Independent Film Award]] nominations winning four awards including for [[Simon Russell Beale]] for [[BIFA Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Joseph Stalin]], calling from [[Kuntsevo Dacha]] whilst hosting the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]], demands a recording of [[Radio Moscow]]'s live recital of Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 23 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 23]]. Having not been recorded in the first place, the sound engineers hurriedly have the orchestra perform again; to this end, they fill the now-half-empty venue with people pulled in off the street to replicate the acoustics, and replace the now-unconscious conductor with another due to be purged, who is forced to conduct in his [[pyjamas]]. However, pianist [[Maria Yudina]] hides a note for Stalin in the record sleeve admonishing him and expressing her hope for his death. As the Central Committee members leave, [[NKVD]] head [[Lavrentiy Beria]] reveals to [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|Deputy Chairman]] [[Georgy Malenkov]] that [[List of Soviet foreign ministers|Foreign Minister]] [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] is to be purged. When the record arrives, Stalin finds the note; as he reads it, he laughs hysterically, but suffers a [[Stroke|cerebral haemorrhage]] in the process.\n\nOut of fear of punishment, Stalin's guards do not enter the office despite having heard him fall; in the morning, his housekeeper is the first to discover him unconscious. The Central Committee is notified and they rush to the dacha; Beria, who has had the NKVD take up the [[Soviet Armed Forces|Red Army]]-held security postings across Moscow, is the first to arrive and finds Yudina's note. After the rest of the Committee, including [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Anastas Mikoyan]], and [[Nikolai Bulganin]], arrive, they collectively decide to send for a team of doctors despite all of the best in the Moscow area having been [[Doctors' plot|purged]]. Stalin has a bout of [[terminal lucidity]], but he eventually dies, fulfilling Yudina's wish. The Committee returns to Moscow as the NKVD loots the dacha and Beria has the order to execute Molotov stricken.\n\nKhrushchev and Beria vie for the support of Stalin's children, [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]] and her alcoholic brother, [[Vasily Stalin|Vasily]]. However, Khrushchev fails to secure Molotov's allegiance as a result of Molotov's dislike of factionalism, which is compounded by Beria releasing his wife, [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]], from prison. While the Committee names Malenkov [[Premier of the Soviet Union|chairman]], he is essentially a puppet of Beria, who further exerts control by hijacking Khrushchev's proposed reforms, releasing political prisoners, loosening [[Russian Orthodox Church|clergical]] [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|restrictions]], and relegating him to planning Stalin's funeral. [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Georgy Zhukov]] is irate over the supplanting of the military by the NKVD and he and Khrushchev are further incensed upon discovering that Beria has halted all transportation into Moscow. However, Beria learns that Khrushchev and Yudina, who is due to play at the funeral, are known to be acquainted, and threatens both with the release of her note to Stalin.\n\nZhukov and Molotov, the latter having been disillusioned by Beria's lifting of restrictions on the Church, both agree to support Khrushchev in a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] against Beria as long as the rest of the Committee is in unanimous support. Beria's authority is further undermined when Khrushchev surreptitiously has the travel ban lifted and the NKVD massacres 1,500 arriving mourners. The Committee decides to blame junior NKVD officers, but Beria angrily dissents under the belief that he will be held culpable anyway, and he threatens them with documents detailing their involvement in various [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|purges]].\n\nOn the day of the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin#Funeral|funeral]], Khrushchev lies to Zhukov and Molotov about having secured the rest of the Committee's support, prompting the Red Army's reclamation of its posts and the mass arrests of NKVD personnel, including Beria, with [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s personal assistance. Malenkov hesitantly throws his lot in with the anti-Beria camp at Khrushchev's urging, and he reluctantly signs Beria's death warrant. At Beria's [[Kangaroo court|hasty trial]], Khrushchev [[Lavrentiy Beria#Arrest, trial and execution|accuses Beria of sexual assault, paedophilia, and treason]], charges that elicit disgust from the various attending officials and military officers, and sentences him to death. As Beria is dragged away sobbing and begging for mercy, a soldier shoots him in the head, and Zhukov cremates him with a lighter and gasoline. Khrushchev sends Svetlana to [[Vienna]] despite her protests, and concurs with Kaganovich and Molotov that Malenkov is unfit to lead.\n\nSeveral years later, Yudina performs Concerto No. 23 again with Khrushchev, now leader of the Soviet Union in the wake of his removal of Malenkov and Molotov, in attendance. His future successor, Brezhnev, watches him from the row of seats above.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as [[Nikita Khrushchev]]\n* [[Simon Russell Beale]] as [[Lavrentiy Beria|Lavrenti Beria]]\n* [[Paddy Considine]] as Andreyev, director of Radio Moscow\n* [[Rupert Friend]] as [[Vasily Stalin]]\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Georgy Zhukov]]\n* [[Olga Kurylenko]] as [[Maria Yudina|Maria Veniaminovna Yudina]]\n* [[Michael Palin]] as [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]\n* [[Andrea Riseborough]] as [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]]\n* [[Dermot Crowley]] as [[Lazar Kaganovich]]\n* [[Paul Chahidi]] as [[Nikolai Bulganin]]\n* [[Adrian McLoughlin]] as [[Joseph Stalin]]\n* [[Paul Whitehouse]] as [[Anastas Mikoyan]]\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as [[Georgy Malenkov]]\n* [[Jonny Phillips (actor)|Jonny Phillips]] as NKVD Officer Pervak\n* [[Sylvestra Le Touzel]] as [[Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva]]\n* [[Nick Sidi]] as [[Bogdan Kobulov]]\t\n* [[Cara Horgan]] as {{ill|Lydia Timashuk|ru|\u0422\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0443\u043a, \u041b\u0438\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430}}\t\t\n* [[Richard Brake]] as [[Anatoly Tarasov]]\n* [[Jonathan Aris]] as Mezhnikov\t\n* [[Diana Quick]] as [[Polina Zhemchuzhina]]\t\t\n* Dave Wong as [[Zhou Enlai]]\t\n* [[Gerald Lepkowski]] as [[Leonid Brezhnev]]\t\n* Luke D'Silva as [[Kirill Moskalenko]]\n* Daniel Fearn as [[Ivan Konev]]}}\n\n==Production==\nThe project began development during the 2016 [[Cannes Film Festival]].

However, he was not the commander of the Soviet Army in March 1953.\n* Khrushchev, not Malenkov, chaired the meeting to reorganise the government.\n* Beria was arrested three months after Stalin died, not almost simultaneously, and that was precipitated by the [[East German uprising of 1953|1953 East German uprising]], not a massacre of mourners in Moscow, which is based on the 109 who were trampled to death during the funeral.

In fact she had no involvement in the events surrounding Stalin's death and was a unwilling pawn in the Doctors' plot who became embittered by the resulting stigmas of informer and anti-Semitism until her death in 1983.<ref>[http://www.critical.ru/guestroom/opus/bobrov/pages/b8.php \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d \u043c\u0438\u0444 \u043e \u041b.\u0424. \u0422\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0443\u043a? ] (How the myth about L.F.Timasuk was created?); from: \u0411\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u041e. \u0415., \"\u041c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0430 (\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044b, \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0431\u044b, \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0435)\", \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a : \u0420\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430, 2004, <!-- {{ISBN|966-705198-8}}, ISBN is invalid (checksum), listed invalid ISBN?

In the film Vasily Stalin and Anatoly Tarasov deal with a depleted [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team]], complete with a reference to their star player [[Vsevolod Bobrov]], who missed the flight. However, the crash happened on 5 January 1950, more than three years before Stalin's death.\n\nBogdan Kobulov is depicted as being shot dead during Beria's arrest by officers under orders by Zhukov.
