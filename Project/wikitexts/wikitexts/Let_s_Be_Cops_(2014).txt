It was filmed on location in Atlanta, Georgia, and released on August 13, 2014. The film received negative reviews from critics. It was a box office success grossing $138.2 million worldwide against a production budget of $17 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Los Angeles]], longtime friends Justin Miller, a struggling [[video game]] designer, and Ryan O'Malley, an unemployed former college [[quarterback]], recall a pact they once made: if they had not achieved success by age thirty, they would move back to [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Leaving a bar, Ryan\u2019s car is hit by an intimidating [[Albanian mafia|Albanian gang]].\n\nAfter Justin\u2019s unsuccessful pitch for a police-themed video game, Ryan convinces him to wear the police uniforms from his presentation as costumes at their college reunion. Confronted with their classmates\u2019 success and their own sense of failure, they decide to honor their pact, but are treated like real cops on the street. Enjoying the charade, they kick the Albanian gang out of Georgie's, a restaurant where Justin finally gains the attention of Josie, a waitress he likes.\n\nRyan doubles down on the hoax, learning official procedures from YouTube and modifying a used [[police cruiser]] to resemble a real [[LAPD]] vehicle. Justin reluctantly joins him, and begins a relationship with Josie. During their shenanigans, the friends end up on a real distress call with Patrol Officer Segars. Justin realizes they face serious jail time if exposed, but Josie calls about a man harassing her at the restaurant. He turns out to be Mossi Kasic, the Albanian gang\u2019s leader, who intimidates the \u201cofficers\u201d into doing nothing.\n\nThe friends obtain surveillance equipment from Segars to stakeout Mossi, observing him with an unidentified partner who has been investigating Ryan and Justin, believing them to be federal agents. Mossi receives a shipment of crates, and the friends interrogate the delivery driver, Pupa. Josie, an aspiring makeup artist, helps disguise Justin as Pupa to infiltrate Mossi\u2019s club, where Justin is forced to smoke [[crystal meth]] and fight in a [[bare-knuckle boxing]] match. He and Ryan discover the crates contain guns stolen from police evidence and [[SWAT]] equipment and weapons, along with a [[secret tunnel]] between Mossi's club and Georgie's restaurant.\n\nFed up with being in danger, Justin accuses Ryan of filling his own lack of purpose with fake police work, and they part ways. Ryan brings his evidence against Mossi to Segars, who introduces the head of the organized crime unit, Detective Brolin \u2014 Mossi's partner. \nRecognizing each other, Brolin threatens Ryan, while a newly assertive Justin pitches his game again in uniform. One of Brolin's officers arrives to kill him, inadvertently helping sell the pitch, and Justin escapes but Ryan is abducted by Mossi\u2019s men.\n\nJustin calls Segars for help and admits everything, before confessing to Josie that he is not a real cop and entering the tunnel alone. A captive Ryan pits Mossi and Brolin against each other, prompting Mossi to kill the detective. Justin attempts to save his friend, but is overpowered. Segars arrives and a gunfight ensues, with Ryan and Justin arming themselves with the stolen SWAT equipment. Cornered by Mossi, they are saved by Segars, who shoots Mossi in the neck and lets the friends go free.\n\nWith his newfound confidence, Justin becomes a successful game developer, while a motivated Ryan graduates from the police academy as a full-fledged LAPD officer. Justin apologizes to Josie, and they rekindle their relationship. Ryan arrives with Pupa, his new informant, and drags Justin on a high-speed chase.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Damon Wayans, Jr. SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Damon Wayans, Jr.]] at a panel for the film at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in July 2014]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jake Johnson]] as Ryan J.
