It is a remake of ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963) and an homage to [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[Shoot the Piano Player]]'' (1960) complete with the French film star [[Charles Aznavour]], making two appearances singing his song \"Quand tu m'aimes\" (first in French, later in English). The film was produced, directed and co-written by [[Jonathan Demme]], and stars [[Mark Wahlberg]] and [[Thandiwe Newton]] in the roles played by [[Cary Grant]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''Charade''.\n\nThis version closely mirrors the plotline of the original film. It is once again set in Paris and features several famous French actors. Director [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] made a cameo appearance. Actress/chanteuse [[Anna Karina]] sings a [[Serge Gainsbourg]] song in one scene. [[Peter Stone (writer)|Peter Stone]], screenwriter of ''Charade'', receives a story credit as Peter Joshua, one of the aliases Grant's character uses in the first film. Stone disliked the remake and refused to be credited under his real name. The name of Wahlberg's character in the remake is Joshua Peters. The film was poorly received by critics and was a flop at the box office, earning only $7 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=November 2015}}\nBritish newlywed Regina Lambert lives in Paris with her husband Charlie.
