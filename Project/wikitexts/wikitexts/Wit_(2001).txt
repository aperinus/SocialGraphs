The teleplay by Nichols and [[Emma Thompson]] is based on the 1999 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Wit (play)|play of the same title]] by [[Margaret Edson]].\n\nThe film was shown at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 9, 2001 before being broadcast by [[HBO]] on March 24. It was shown at the [[Edinburgh Film Festival]] and the [[Warsaw Film Festival]] later in the year.\n\n==Plot==\nVivian Bearing is a professor of [[English literature]] known for her intense knowledge of [[metaphysical poetry]], especially the [[Holy Sonnets]] of [[John Donne]]. Her life takes a turn when she is diagnosed with [[metastatic]] Stage IV [[ovarian cancer]]. [[Oncology|Oncologist]] Harvey Kelekian prescribes various [[chemotherapy]] treatments to treat her disease, and as she suffers through the various side-effects (such as fever, chills, vomiting, and abdominal pain), she attempts to put everything in perspective. The story periodically [[Flashback (narrative)|flashes back]] to previous moments in her life, including her childhood, her [[graduate school]] studies, and her career prior to her diagnosis. During the course of the film, she continually breaks the [[fourth wall]] by looking into the camera and expressing her feelings.\n\nAs she grows increasingly ill, Vivian agrees to undergo more tests and experimental treatments, even though she realizes the doctors treating her, including former student Jason Posner, see her less as someone to save and more as a [[guinea pig#In scientific research|guinea pig]] for their treatments. The only person who seems to care for her as a person is Susie Monahan, one of the [[nurse]]s on the staff.\n\nLate in Vivian's illness, the only visitor she receives in the hospital is her former graduate school professor and mentor, Evelyn Ashford, who reads her excerpts from [[Margaret Wise Brown]]'s ''[[The Runaway Bunny]]''. As she nears the end of her life, Vivian manages to maintain her dignity and wit even as she is finally confronted with her own frailty and need for compassion.\n\nVivian dies at the end of the film, with her voiceover reciting \"[[s:Death be not proud|death be not proud]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as Vivian Bearing, Ph.D.\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Dr. Harvey Kelekian\n* [[Eileen Atkins]] as Evelyn Ashford, Ph.D.\n* [[Audra McDonald]] as Susie Monahan, R.N.\n* [[Jonathan M. Woodward]] as Dr. Jason Posner\n* [[Harold Pinter]] as Mr. Bearing\n\n==Production==\nIn preparation for the role of Vivian Bearing, Emma Thompson shaved her head, following in the footsteps of actresses such as [[Kathleen Chalfant]] and [[Judith Light]], who had performed the role on stage.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E7DD1E3AF93BA25750C0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all ''New York Times'' article, March 18, 2001]</ref>\n\nThe film was shot at the [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[London]].<ref name=Variety>[https://archive.today/20130205145049/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117797321.html?categoryid=32&cs=1&p=0 ''Variety'' review]</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack includes a number of [[Classical music|classical]] pieces, including the Serenade Adagio from [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s String Quartet No. 15, ''[[Spiegel im Spiegel]]'' by [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]], the second movement of [[Henryk Mikolaj Gorecki]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Gorecki)|Symphony No. 3 (''Symphony of Sorrowful Songs'')]], and ''[[The Unanswered Question]]'' by [[Charles Ives]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film was received with general acclaim. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has a score of 83% based on reviews from 12 critics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wit/|title = Wit|website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nEddie Cockrell of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"shrewd and triumphant\" and \"focused, emotionally draining and ultimately inspiring\" and added, \"The risks in filming such a theatrical experience are enormous, yet the original material has been carefully and smartly reworked for the screen by Thompson and Nichols . . . Subtle yet crucial shifts from theatrical to film conventions abound, reaffirming Thompson's skill as both writer and actress . . . as well as Nichols' proven track record with theatrical properties.\"<ref name=\"Variety\" />\n\nCaryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed, \"Emma Thompson gives one of her most brilliant performances as Vivian Bearing...Mr. Nichols and Ms. Thompson, who wrote the script together, have made minimal changes to the play, but those amount to a major transformation. They have preserved Ms. Edson's language and intense focus on Vivian's hospital room as she endures eight months of brutal experimental chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. But Mr. Nichols's visual choices turn this into a fluent, gripping television film...The hospital staff around her is played beautifully by actors who escape the hazards of clich\u00e9s. As Jason, a young doctor proud of the A minus he once got in Vivian's poetry course, Jonathan M. Woodward makes his character's callowness and insensitivity believable. As Susie, the nurse whose total compassion makes her Jason's opposite, Audra McDonald is especially impressive because the character could so easily have been treated with condescension...E. M. Ashford is played with unerring delicacy by Eileen Atkins in a performance that matches Ms. Thompson's brilliance.... [L]et's not pretend that ''Wit'' is fun or necessarily soothing; frankly, it is depressing. But if you miss this version, you will also miss a rare experience.\"<ref>{{cite news | date = March 23, 2001 | author = Caryn James | title = Death, Mighty Thou Art; So Too, a \n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/23/movies/tv-weekend-death-mighty-thou-art-so-too-a-compassionate-heart.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090728080304/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/23/movies/tv-weekend-death-mighty-thou-art-so-too-a-compassionate-heart.html | archive-date = 2009-07-28 | access-date = November 18, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn his July 3, 2008 blog, [[Roger Ebert]] recalled naming ''Wit'' one of the year's best on his ''Best Films of 2001'' program with [[Richard Roeper]], even though it never opened theatrically. He described it as \"both intelligent and heartbreaking\" and called Emma Thompson's performance \"her best work on film.\" He said when he tried to watch the DVD in later years, he discovered \"I actually could not watch the movie. I remembered it too clearly, perhaps, and dreaded re-living it. When I reviewed it, its situation was theoretical for me, and I responded to the honesty and emotion of the drama. Since then, I have had cancer, and had all too many hours, days and weeks of hospital routine robbing me of my dignity. Although people in my situation are always praised for their courage, actually courage has nothing to do with it. There is no choice.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/07/when_a_movie_hurts_too_much.html |title=''Roger Ebert's Journal'' |access-date=2009-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417093012/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/07/when_a_movie_hurts_too_much.html |archive-date=2009-04-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCritics from [[The A.V.
