It stars [[Boris Karloff]] as John Gray, a cab driver who moonlights as a [[grave robber]], illegally supplying Dr. Wolfe \"Toddy\" MacFarlane (played by [[Henry Daniell]]) with cadavers for his classes, and eventually turning to murder to procure more corpses. Alongside Karloff and Daniell, the film's cast includes [[Russell Wade]], [[Bela Lugosi]], [[Henry Daniell]], and [[Edith Atwater]]. ''The Body Snatcher'' is the final film to feature both Karloff and Lugosi in a joint appearance.<ref name=\"Hoberman 2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/arts/black-cat-boris-karloff-bela-lugosi.html|title=In 'The Black Cat,' the Titans of Terror, Karloff and Lugosi, Face Off|last=Hoberman|first=J.|author-link=J.

MacFarlane suggests surgery for the girl, but insists that he cannot perform the operation himself because his teaching position keeps him too busy. Later that night, MacFarlane's prized student Donald Fettes tells the doctor he cannot afford to continue his studies. MacFarlane offers Fettes a job as a [[lab assistant]] to help with an experiment he is planning.\n\nFettes is awakened in the middle of the night by John Gray, a cab driver and graverobber, who has arrived to deliver a corpse to MacFarlane to dissect in one of his classes. Later, MacFarlane and Fettes go to an inn and run into Gray, who threatens to reveal MacFarlane's \"dark secret\" if he does not operate on Georgina. MacFarlane initially agrees, but later tries to renege on his promise. Fettes asks Gray to get another human specimen so Georgina might have hope of walking again. After visiting Gray, Fettes gives a coin to a blind street singer. He is shocked when Gray arrives later at the lab with the corpse of the singer.\n\nFettes shows MacFarlane the body and accuses Gray of murder. The conversation is overheard by Joseph, MacFarlane's other assistant. MacFarlane tells Fettes that he could be arrested as an accomplice and advises him not to notify the police. Georgina recovers from the surgery, but she is still unable to walk. MacFarlane is tortured by his failure, and goes to the inn to drown his sorrows. Gray shows up and torments him about their \"secret\".\n\nJoseph visits Gray and attempts to blackmail him to keep quiet about his body-snatching operation. Gray tells Joseph the story of the infamous murderers [[Burke and Hare murders|Burke and Hare]], and reveals that they procured bodies for Dr. Knox, MacFarlane's [[mentor]]. Gray promises to pay Joseph, but smothers him to death when the other man allows him to get too close. Later, he delivers the body to MacFarlane's lab as a \"gift\". Meg Camden, MacFarlane's housekeeper and secret wife, tells Fettes that Gray admitted to robbing graves during the Burke and Hare trial to shield the real perpetrator \u2013 MacFarlane. Later, MacFarlane offers Gray money to stop tormenting him. Gray refuses to take the bribe, and vows that the doctor will never be rid of him. Enraged, MacFarlane beats Gray to death.\n\nFettes meets with Mrs. Marsh and Georgina. The girl hears horses nearby and stands up to see them; the operation was a success after all. Fettes rushes to tell MacFarlane the good news, but Meg tells him that the doctor has gone to another town to sell Gray's horse and carriage.\n\nFettes finds MacFarlane at a tavern. He tells Fettes that he plans to rob a freshly dug grave. Fettes sees no alternative than to assist the doctor, and they load the unearthed corpse onto Gray's carriage. As they drive through a storm, MacFarlane hears Gray taunting him from the back of the carriage. He stops the carriage and orders Fettes to check the body. When he uncovers the body and shines a light on it, MacFarlane sees Gray's corpse. The horses, spooked by the storm, bolt. The carriage breaks loose and falls over a cliff with MacFarlane and the corpse. Fettes looks down at the wreck and sees MacFarlane's corpse, next to that of a woman.<ref>Hanson, ''AFI Catalog'', p. 270.</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as Cabman John Gray\n* [[B\u00e9la Lugosi]] as Joseph\n* [[Henry Daniell]] as Dr. Wolfe \"Toddy\" MacFarlane\n* [[Edith Atwater]] as Meg Camden\n* [[Russell Wade]] as Donald Fettes\n* [[Rita Corday]] as Mrs. Marsh\n* [[Sharyn Moffett]] as Georgina Marsh\n* Donna Lee as the Street Singer\n* [[Ted Billings]] as Townsman (uncredited) \n* [[Ethan Laidlaw]] as Pub Patron (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n |perrow = 2\n |total_width = 275\n |align = right\n |direction =\n |image1 = Boris Karloff.jpg\n |image2 = Lugosi B\u00e9la fortepan 14652 (cropped).jpg\n |footer = ''The Body Snatcher'' is the final film to feature both Boris Karloff (left, pictured {{circa}} 1940s) and Bela Lugosi (right, {{circa}} 1912) in a joint appearance\n |footer_align = left\n}}\n''The Body Snatcher'' was one of three films that [[Boris Karloff]] did with [[RKO Radio Pictures]] from 1945 to 1946, which were produced by [[Val Lewton]]. The other two films were ''[[Isle of the Dead (film)|Isle of the Dead]]'' (1945) and ''[[Bedlam (1946 film)|Bedlam]]'' (1946).\n\nIn a 1946 interview with Louis Berg of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Karloff discussed his reasons for leaving [[Universal Pictures]] and working with Lewton. Achieving stardom with ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931), he felt that the franchise had run its course. He called ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944), the last installment, a \"monster clambake\" that includes [[Frankenstein's monster]], [[Count Dracula]], [[Larry Talbot|The Wolf Man]] and a hunchback. Finding it ridiculous, he decided not to renew his contract with Universal, though the film performed well at the box office, and stated that Lewton at RKO was \"the man who rescued him from the living dead and restored, so to speak, his soul\".<ref>{{cite news | author=Louis Berg | title=Farewell to Monsters | url=http://www.whiskeyloosetongue.com/articles/history/karloff.pdf | work=The Los Angeles Times | page=F12 | date=12 May 1946 | accessdate=7 November 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920151215/http://www.whiskeyloosetongue.com/articles/history/karloff.pdf | archivedate=20 September 2009 | df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe production of the film took place around the same time as ''Isle of the Dead'', with Lewton having a role as a screenwriter in both films. Lewton, along with British screenwriter [[Philip MacDonald]], adapted the 1884 short story \"[[The Body Snatcher]]\" by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. Lewton wrote under the pen name \"Carlos Keith\".\n\n[[Bela Lugosi]], who became famous with another Universal classic, ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), also signed a deal with RKO. Lewton and MacDonald eventually wrote a small role for him; it became the last film Lugosi and Karloff made together.\n\n[[Robert Wise]] \u2013 later best-known for his work in ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951), ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961), ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965), and ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'' (1966) \u2013 was assigned to direct the film. Longtime film editor at RKO, he had replaced the original director on ''[[The Curse of the Cat People]]'' (1944) when it fell behind schedule and Lewton, who produced it, decided to promote him to his superiors.<ref>{{cite book | last =Gehring | first =Wes D | title =Robert Wise: Shadowlands | publisher =Indiana Historical Society Press | year =2012|pages=71\u201378 | location =Indianapolis | isbn =978-0-87195-296-7}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] took place between October 25-November 17, 1944.
