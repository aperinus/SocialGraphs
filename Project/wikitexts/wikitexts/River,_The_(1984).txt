The film tells the story of a struggling farm family in the [[Tennessee]] valley trying to keep its farm from going under in the face of bank foreclosures and floods. The father faces the dilemma of having to work as a [[strikebreaker]] in a steel mill to keep his family farm from foreclosure. It was based on the true story of farmers who unknowingly took jobs as strikebreakers at a steel mill after their crops had been destroyed by rain.\n\n''The River'' was theatrically released on December 19, 1984, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews, with critics praising Spacek's performance and the cinematography, but criticizing the screenplay, execution, and Gibson's performance, whom many considered to have been miscast. It was a box office failure, grossing only $11.5 million against an $18 million budget. Despite that, it received four nominations at the [[57th Academy Awards]]; [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Spacek), [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and won the [[Special Achievement Academy Award|Special Achievement Award]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=July 2021}}\nTom and Mae Garvey are a hard-working couple living with their two children on the east Tennessee farm owned by Tom's family for generations. They and many of their neighbors have hit hard times as of late. A downturn in the economy has led to dwindling land prices. But their biggest problem has been that their crop land has been prone to flooding as the property is adjacent to a river. Manipulating the powers that be include local senator Neiswinder and the local bank. Joe Wade, who also grew up in the area and now runs the local milling company that sets the local grain prices, is working behind the scenes to buy up the properties along the river for a song as he wants to build a dam that would flood the Garvey's and other riverfront properties. The dam would generate electricity but more importantly for Joe, it would provide irrigation opportunities for farm properties away from the river, such as his own. Tom already intensely dislikes Joe because he and Mae used to be a couple. Joe's manoeuvrings coupled with the continuation of these and many other farming problems makes it increasingly difficult for Tom and Mae to hold on to their farm, as Tom is determined at any cost to have it stay on the land of his ancestors.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Mae Garvey\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Tom Garvey\n* Shane Bailey as Lewis Garvey\n* Becky Jo Lynch as Beth Garvey\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as Joe Wade\n* Don Hood as Senator Neiswinder\n* [[Billy \"Green\" Bush]] as Harve Stanley\n* [[James Tolkan]] as Howard Simpson\n* [[Jack Starrett]] as foreman Swick \n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Mark Rydell]] viewed the characters in this drama as iconically American, and he was eager to cast [[Sissy Spacek]] as the farm wife because of her performance in ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' and her home on a farm near [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. Rydell said, \"She is the consummate American rural young woman, with strength and fiber and a luminous quality.\" [[Mel Gibson]] begged Rydell to let him play the Tennessee farmer who reminded him of his father, but the director was reluctant because of Gibson's Australian accent. Before Gibson left for [[England]] to film ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'', he begged Rydell not to cast the part yet. Rydell recalled, \"He came back to my house in [[Los Angeles]] and started reading the script, talking, reading the newspaper, in this perfect Tennessee accent. I was really impressed, even when he stood next to Sissy, who's like a tuning fork when it comes to accents, he had damn well done it.\"\n\n''The River'' was filmed in the Holston Valley area of [[Church Hill, Tennessee]]. The filmmakers purchased {{convert|440|acre|km2}} along the [[Holston River]] for the farm set and planted corn. Most of the filming was done along Goshen Valley Road and around the Goshen Valley Park area. Goshen Valley Road heads south from highway 11W in [[Church Hill, Tennessee]]. The cast and their families moved to the area a month before the start of production to connect with the local people and learn farming skills. The floods in the film were supplied by the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] with water from the [[Fort Patrick Henry Dam]]. The bank and downtown scenes were filmed in the town of [[Gate City, Virginia]].  The tent city and a few other scenes were filmed in [[Kingsport, Tennessee]], while some factory scenes were filmed in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Scenes that were filmed at Double Springs Baptist Church in [[Jonesborough, Tennessee]] did not make the final cut of the movie.  The film was completed for under $18 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=How \"The River\" Came to the Screen|author=Ester B.
