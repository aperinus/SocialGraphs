She has only met him once and does not want to go, but her [[Abbess|mother superior]] reminds Viridiana that Jaime is her only living relative and paid for her studies, so she agrees to make the trip.\n\nJaime is a widower and recluse who lives on a neglected country estate with a few servants. He greets Viridiana, who strongly resembles her aunt, warmly and says he is sorry he does not know her better. Viridiana likes life on the farm, but remains cold toward Jaime, as she heard he has an [[illegitimate]] son who he abandoned.\n\nOn the last day of her visit, Jaime asks Viridiana to don his wife's wedding gown. She does, and Jaime tells her that her aunt died of a heart attack on their wedding night. It becomes clear that Jaime wants to marry Viridiana, and she is repulsed. He seems to drop the idea and gets her to agree to stay for a cup of coffee before going to bed, signaling his maid Ramona to drug Viridiana's drink. Jaime kisses her once she is unconscious, but cannot bring himself to rape her.\n\nIn the morning, Jaime tells Viridiana that, because he raped her, she cannot return to the convent. She still packs her things, so he admits what really happened, hoping she will not leave hating him, but Viridiana does not forgive Jaime.\n\nViridiana is kept from boarding the bus out of town by the news that Jaime hung himself. She feels guilty for his death and decides to stay on at the estate. Jaime split his belongings between Viridiana and his son, Jorge, who moves into Jaime's house with his girlfriend, Luc\u00eda, and begins to fix up the buildings and land he inherited. Meanwhile, Viridiana pays beggars from town to move onto the property, where she cares for them and devotes herself to their moral development. She even welcomes Jos\u00e9, a man with sores on his arm, who the other beggars do not accept, as they think he has [[leprosy]]. The beggars behave themselves when Viridiana is around, but they revert to their old ways as soon as she is gone.\n\nJorge says he does not like Viridiana's actions and is annoyed by her piety, but Luc\u00eda thinks he is attracted to her and, also bored of the country, leaves. After noticing Ramona looking at him, Jorge seduces the maid.\n\nWhen Viridiana and Jorge go to town on business and all of the servants are also away, the beggars break into Jorge's house. At first, they just want to look around, but they wind up having a drunken dinner party. Enedina has everyone pose on one side of the table, like in [[Leonardo da Vinci|Da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'', but she does not really have a camera. Everyone laughs, and Jos\u00e9 puts [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s [[Messiah (Handel)|\"Hallelujah\" Chorus]] on the [[turntable]] and dances around in Jaime's wife's [[Veil#Bridal_veils|bridal veil]] and [[corset]]. Paco pulls Enedina behind a couch and begins to rape her, but, in their inebriated state, the others think the interaction is consensual. When Amalio, a blind man who is Enedina's jealous boyfriend, hears about what is happening, he says he will kill Paco and breaks all of the dishes on the table.\n\nAs there is now irreparable damage, most of the beggars flee the estate. They run into Jorge on their way out, and he surveys the destruction until \"El Cojo\" attacks him. Jos\u00e9 knocks Jorge out and Viridiana enters. El Cojo tries to rape her while Jos\u00e9, who hopes to get \"a turn\", ties up Jorge. When Jorge awakens, he bribes Jos\u00e9 to kill El Cojo, saving Viridinia, who has fainted. Ramona returns with some police officers.\n\nViridiana lets her hair down and puts her crown of thorns, which she used to kneel in front of during her prayers, on a pile of waste to be burned. She goes to Jorge's bedroom and finds Ramona with him. He invites her to play cards and listen to some modern music,{{efn|\"Shimmy Doll\" by Ashley Beaumont plays during this scene.}} and, though she appears troubled, she complies. Jorge has both women sit down and deals the cards.\n\n===Censored ending===\nThe Spanish board of censors rejected the original ending of the film, which depicted Viridiana entering Jorge's room and slowly closing the door behind her. A new ending was written and accepted that, according to some film historians, is even more debauched, if less explicit, than the first, as it implies a [[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]] consisting of Jorge, Ramona, and Viridiana.<ref name=\"Sigh\">Bu\u00f1uel, Luis.

It was sent by the Spanish cinematographic authority to the [[Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Palme d'Or]], but then ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', the official newspaper of [[Vatican City|the Vatican]], described the film as \"blasphemous\", and the government of [[Francisco Franco]] banned its release in Spain. According to executive producer [[Pere Portabella]], Spanish authorities tried to have the original negative burned, and it only survived because it was with a foreign company who had done some post-production work.<ref>{{cite news |title=Interview with Pere Portabella |first=Javier |last=Zurro |author-link=Bosley Crowther |newspaper=[[eldiario.es]] |date=8 Apr 2022 |url=https://www.eldiario.es/cultura/cine/pere-portabella-vaticano-dijo-viridiana-excremento-insulto-espanoles_1_8901592.html}}</ref> The film was not released in Spain until 1977, two years after Franco's death, when Bu\u00f1uel was 77 years old.<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/423 |title=''Viridiana'': The Human Comedy |author=Wood, Michael |date=22 May 2006 |access-date=15 March 2010}}</ref> For his part, Bu\u00f1uel said he \"didn't deliberately set out to be blasphemous, but then [[Pope John XXIII]] is a better judge of such things than I am\".<ref name=\"Wood\"/>\n\nThe film won the [[Belgian Film Critics Association]]'s [[Grand Prix (Belgian Film Critics Association)|Grand Prix]], but [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:\n{{quote|Luis Bu\u00f1uel is presenting a variation on an ancient theme in his new Spanish film, ''Viridiana'', which came to the [[Paris Theater (Manhattan)|Paris]] yesterday. The theme is that well-intended charity can often be badly misplaced by innocent, pious people. Therefore, beware of charity.&nbsp;... It is an ugly, depressing view of life. And, to be frank about it, it is a little old-fashioned, too. His format is strangely literary; his symbols are obvious and blunt, such as the revulsion of the girl toward milking or the display of a penknife built into a crucifix.
