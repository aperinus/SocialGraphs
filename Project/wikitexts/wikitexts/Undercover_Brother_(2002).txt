Lee]] and starring [[Eddie Griffin]]. The screenplay by [[John Ridley]] and [[Michael McCullers]] is based on the Internet animated series created by Ridley. It [[Parody|spoofs]] blaxploitation films of the 1970s as well as a number of other films, most notably the [[James Bond]] franchise. It also stars former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Chris Kattan]] and comedian [[Dave Chappelle]] as well as [[Aunjanue Ellis]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Denise Richards]], and [[Billy Dee Williams]], and features a cameo by [[James Brown]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins with a backstory of how [[African-American culture]]'s popularity with the American public began to decline in the 1980s, when style and originality began to lose appeal in the public eye due to the persistent efforts of \"[[The Man]]\", a powerful [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] man in control of a secret organization that seeks to undermine the African-American community as well as the cultures of other minorities. The Man is infuriated that Gen. Warren Boutwell, a [[United States Army]] general (based on [[Colin Powell]]), is considering running for president, and his lackey Mr. Feather informs him of a mind-control drug which The Man uses to make Boutwell abort his plans and instead open a fried chicken franchise. The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a secret organization that battles The Man's influence, determines The Man is behind Boutwell's change of heart, and recruits a freelance spy named Undercover Brother to aid them.\n\nUndercover Brother joins B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. which is made up of the Chief, Conspiracy Brother, Smart Brother, Sistah Girl, and Lance, an intern who is the only white man in the organization hired due to [[affirmative action]]. Undercover Brother goes undercover as a new employee at a cigarette company owned by The Man, where Mr. Feather discovers his identity. He deploys a secret weapon that he calls \"Black Man's [[Kryptonite]]\", an attractive assassin named White She-Devil. Posing as another new employee, she and Undercover Brother start dating, and she begins to make him do stereotypical \"white\" things, such as buying [[corduroy]] and [[khaki]] clothes, singing [[karaoke]], and adopting a silly set of [[euphemism]]s. Meanwhile, The Man distributes his mind-control drug through Boutwell's fried chicken, infecting other black celebrities and making them act white, as well as marketing the chicken nationwide to land a crushing blow to African-American culture.\n\nConcerned with Undercover Brother's unusual behavior, Sistah Girl attacks White She-Devil and convinces Undercover Brother to return to the fight. White She-Devil turns on her own henchmen to save the two, revealing she has fallen in love with Undercover Brother. They return to the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., where Smart Brother questions White She-Devil about The Man and Lance is officially made part of the group when he declares his desire to abolish bigotry after watching ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]''. The group heads to an awards gala after they find out that [[James Brown]] is The Man's next target. Mr. Feather kidnaps Brown and takes him to The Man's base. B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. secures an antidote for the mind control drug and follows via a transmitter placed on Brown, infiltrating the base posing as a cleaning crew, to rescue Brown and Boutwell.\n\nMr. Feather prepares to administer the drug to Brown and present him as a trophy to The Man, and Brown reveals himself as Undercover Brother in disguise. Mr. Feather sends his henchmen after B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., who rescue Boutwell, and is ordered by Mr. Feather to kill Undercover Brother. In the fighting, Conspiracy Brother accidentally begins the building's self-destruct sequence. The B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. cures Boutwell and evacuate him from the building while Undercover Brother chases Mr. Feather to the roof. The Man's helicopter circles overhead and leaves, The Man abandoning Mr. Feather for failing him. Mr. Feather jumps onto the helicopter's landing gear as it flies away, and Undercover Brother uses his afro picks to impale Mr. Feather in the buttocks, causing him to fall into the ocean, where he is eaten by a shark. However, The Man escapes. Undercover Brother survives the building's self-destruction by leaping off the building and using his modified [[parachute pants]] to escape. He and Sistah Girl kiss and leave the island, the world at peace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eddie Griffin]] as Undercover Brother / Anton Jackson\n* [[Chris Kattan]] as Mr. Feather\n* [[Denise Richards]] as White She-Devil / Penelope Snow\n* [[Aunjanue Ellis]] as Sistah Girl\n* [[Dave Chappelle]] as Conspiracy Brother Jones\n* [[Chi McBride]] as The Chief\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as Lance the Intern\n* [[Gary Anthony Williams]] as Smart Brother\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as General Warren Boutwell\n* [[Jack Noseworthy]] as Mr. Elias\n* J.D.
