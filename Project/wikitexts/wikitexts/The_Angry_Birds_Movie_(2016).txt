It was directed by [[Clay Kaytis]] and [[Fergal Reilly]] in their [[directorial debuts]], and written by [[Jon Vitti]]. The film features the voices of [[Jason Sudeikis]], [[Josh Gad]], [[Danny McBride]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Kate McKinnon]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Tony Hale]], [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Bill Hader]], and [[Peter Dinklage]]. The film follows Red, a resident in an island of anthropomorphic birds, as he suspects the newly arrived crew of pigs of plotting an evil plan, and attempts to put a stop to them with the help of his newly-formed friends.\n\n''The Angry Birds Movie'' was released in the United States and Canada on May 20, 2016. The critical consensus on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it more entertaining than expected for a film based on an app, but the responses are mixed. The film was a commercial success, grossing $352 million worldwide. A sequel, ''[[The Angry Birds Movie 2]]'', was released on August 14, 2019, with [[Sony Pictures Animation]] (which was not involved with this film) co-producing.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nRed, an angry bird, has been an outcast from Bird Island ever since he was a hatchling due to his short temper and his huge, jet-black eyebrows. When he accidentally causes a premature hatching of another bird's egg, he is sentenced to [[anger management]] class, which is the highest penalty allowed on the island. Red's classmates Chuck, who is hyperactive and can move at [[hypervelocity]], and Bomb, who can cause explosions with his anger and fear, try to befriend him, but he avoids them.\n\nOne day, a boat docks at the island's shore, damaging Red's house. The birds greet two green-colored pigs, the captain Leonard and his assistant Ross, who claim to be peaceful explorers bringing offerings of friendship. They introduce the birds to various innovations, including a giant slingshot, but Red becomes suspicious of the pigs' motives and sneaks into Leonard's boat. He finds more pigs hidden below deck, contradicting Leonard's claim that he and Ross are alone. When he returns and shows everyone the other pigs, the birds accept Leonard's explanation that he only lied to see if Bird Island was safe for his simple-minded cousins.\n\nStill suspecting that there is something off about the pigs, Red recruits Chuck and Bomb to find Mighty Eagle, Bird Island's missing protector and the only bird who can fly. They find Mighty Eagle on top of Eagle Mountain, but he has become an overweight, self-absorbed [[slacker]] who has not flown for years. Red discovers the pigs planting dynamite around the island. He realizes that the pigs are planning to steal the birds' eggs while the birds are distracted by a party. When Mighty Eagle refuses to help them, Red admonishes him. Red, Chuck, and Bomb race back to sound a warning to the other birds and stop the pigs, but the pigs escape with the eggs and activate the dynamite, destroying the village. The other birds apologize to Red for not listening to him. Red forgives everyone and under his leadership, they organize an army and build a boat from the rubble to follow the pigs to Piggy Island.\n\nThe birds discover the pigs living in a walled city ruled by Leonard, whose full name is King Leonard Mudbeard. Deducing that the eggs are in the castle at the center of the city, the birds [[Angry Birds Classic # Gameplay|use the slingshot to attack by launching themselves over the walls and into the city's buildings, destroying them]]. Red, Chuck, and Bomb infiltrate the castle and discover that the eggs are inside a net; the pigs plan to lower the eggs into a giant pot, cook them, and eat them. Mighty Eagle arrives to retrieve Red's group and the eggs, having had a change of heart. One egg falls out of the net and Red battles Leonard for it, but learns to control his anger and distracts him long enough to retrieve the egg. Leonard accidentally ignites the pigs' reserve of dynamite. The giant pot in which the pigs had intended to use to cook the eggs collapses and lands on top of Red. The dynamite explodes, destroying the city, but Red and the egg he was holding are shielded by the pot.\n\nAll the families, except for one, reunite with their eggs. Red emerges holding the egg, containing the Blues (Jay, Jake, and Jim), and returns the brothers to their parents. Mighty Eagle approaches Red, Chuck, and Bomb, claiming that he merely appeared lazy so that they could lose faith in him and find faith in themselves, and takes credit for saving the eggs. Red discovers that the other birds have rebuilt his house in the center of the village. The pigs survive their home's destruction, and Leonard plots a new plan.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Angry Birds film series characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Red<ref name=VarietyCast />{{efn|name=ab|First appeared in the ''[[Angry Birds]]'' series.}}\n** Aidan McGraw as young Red<ref>{{cite tweet | title = Chuck on Twitter: \"Kallan Holley voice as young Red.
