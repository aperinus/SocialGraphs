It is the first in a series of five films about the golden [[mixed breed dog]] named [[Benji]]. Filmed in and around [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]] and [[Denton, Texas|Denton]] in Texas, the story follows Benji, a stray but friendly dog, who is adored by some of the townspeople, including two children named Cindy and Paul. The children fail to convince their father, Dr. Chapman, to allow Benji to stay at their home. When the children are kidnapped by a band of robbers as part of a ransom, Benji attempts to rescue them. The film grossed $45 million on a budget of $500,000, and its theme song received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. The film was turned down by every studio in Hollywood; Camp had to form his own film company to distribute the film worldwide. This film was [[Frances Bavier]]'s and [[Edgar Buchanan]]'s last film before they retired from acting and died in 1989 and 1979 respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nBenji, a stray dog who lives in an abandoned house on the outskirts of a small town, sets about his daily ritual of visiting human friends; he has no fixed home but he desires one, and he likes the children of the Chapman family, Paul and Cindy, best. Mary, their housekeeper, feeds him, but she knows that the children's father, Dr. Chapman, must not find out about him because he'll fire her on the spot. One day their father is about to appear, so they hide Benji under the table. After outwitting Dr. Chapman, the children leave for school and Mary explains to Benji that Dr. Chapman stubbornly dislikes dogs, but he is a nice man. Continuing on his route, Benji chases a cat and greets Officer Tuttle, who announces his wedding engagement and tells Benji that he, too, will soon meet the lady of his dreams. At Bill's Caf\u00e9, Benji wakes Bill from his morning nap and receives a bone as payment.  Returning home, Benji finds three suspicious characters, Linda, Henry, and Riley, breaking in. Although Henry and Riley are spooked by legends that the house is haunted, Linda intends to propose the location as a hideout to their boss Mitch, mastermind of their illicit activities. Henry leaves a bag of groceries behind and Benji eagerly consumes an open pudding cup.\n\nThe next morning at the Chapman home, the children brush Benji, hoping their father will accept him into the family, but Mary tells them that the doctor will not change his mind. After impressing his human friends with his new hairstyle, Benji encounters a pretty white dog in the park who is scavenging through his favorite trashcan. Benji presents her with the bone he received from Bill and she follows him back to the Chapman house where Mary brushes her, brings her food and names her Tiffany after the jewelry store. Benji and Tiffany frolic in the park, but when they return to Benji's home, they find that Riley and Henry have returned. Riley points out that Henry's groceries have been overturned and becomes increasingly anxious that the house is haunted. As Mitch and Linda arrive to survey the property, Riley tells Henry that a pudding cup is missing, but Henry warns him against upsetting their plans.\n\nThe following morning, Dr. Chapman tells his despondent children that Benji carries diseases and forbids them from keeping him as a pet in spite of Cindy's tearful pleas. Later, Riley writes a ransom note to extort money from Dr. Chapman by threatening his children, but Henry throws it on the ground, writes a new one, and orders Riley to deliver it when he gives him the signal. Meanwhile, Mitch surprises Henry and Linda by actually kidnapping the Chapman children. Benji races to the Chapman home to alert the humans but is shooed out by Mary, not understanding his message. Benji returns to steal the ransom note, hoping that by doing that, he'll make the police follow him to the source of trouble, but he is stopped and the note is taken from him. Benji is at a loss at what to do next. He then follows Officer Tuttle into the police station but gets locked in. When he barks through an intercom, he is released by a passing policeman.\n\nReturning to the crime scene, he snatches Riley's first ransom note and is grabbed by Mitch. Tiffany rushes out and bites him and gets a vicious kick in return; she is not killed, but her leg is sore and bruised. Benji runs home where he finds that Linda has preceded him in an attempt to cut off his efforts. She snatches the note from Benji and puts it in her purse. He growls and barks, and Mary berates him and carries him away, but he bites her and lunges at Linda, causing the note to fall out. Mary reads it and rushes it to Dr. Chapman, who demands to know where his children are, and Linda breaks down in tears. Benji leads the police, the FBI, Dr. Chapman, and Mary back to the hideout. Meanwhile, the kidnappers are concerned that Linda has not returned, and Henry and Riley argue that they should leave. As they walk outside, however, the police hold them at gunpoint and the children are reunited with their father and Mary. Their father is so proud of the dogs that he says they can stay with them permanently, much to their and the children's delight.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Higgins (dog)|Higgins]] as [[Benji]]\n* [[Patsy Garrett]] as Mary\n* Cynthia Smith as Cindy Chapman\n* Allen Fiuzat as Paul Chapman\n* [[Peter Breck]] as Dr. Chapman\n* [[Christopher Connelly]] as Henry\n* [[Tom Lester]] as Riley\n* [[Mark Slade]] as Mitch\n* [[Deborah Walley]] as Linda\n* [[Herb Vigran]] as Lt.

The municipal building was filmed in [[Denton, Texas]].\n\nThe film and the ensuing franchise was created after Joe Camp expressed concern over the overabundance of family films released through the [[four wall distribution]] concept. He told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine in 1977: \"It has become an industry-caused thing, but the [[MPAA film rating system|G rated classification]] has to some degree become 'if it's G, it can't be for me'.\"  Camp observed that four-wall companies had saturated the market for G-rated product; in response to the diminished quality of their films, he created ''Benji''.<ref name=margins>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sYDqH2FAcsC&pg=PA239|editor1-last=Holmlund|editor1-first=Chris|editor2-last=Wyatt|editor2-first=Justin|title=Contemporary American Independent Film: From the Margins to the Mainstream|chapter=1970s distribution and marketing strategies|pages=238\u2013239|isbn=0-415-25486-8|year=2005|access-date=October 14, 2010|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref>\n\nHiggins appeared on screen with [[Edgar Buchanan]], with whom he had appeared in the TV series ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''; this was the final film for both.\n\n==Reception==\nProduced on a budget of $500,000,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Benji#tab=summary|title=Benji (1974)|work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|access-date=August 5, 2015}}</ref> it grossed $39.6 million in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=benji.htm|title= Box Office Information for Benji|access-date=January 17, 2012|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> making it the [[1974 in film|ninth highest-grossing film of 1974]].
