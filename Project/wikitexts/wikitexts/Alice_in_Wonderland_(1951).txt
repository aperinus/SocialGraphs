The thirteenth release of [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney's animated features]], the film premiered in London on July 26, 1951, and in New York City on July 28, 1951. It features the voices of [[Kathryn Beaumont]] as [[Alice (Disney)|Alice]], [[Sterling Holloway]] as the [[Cheshire Cat]], [[Verna Felton]] as the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]], and [[Ed Wynn]] as the [[Mad Hatter]]. [[Walt Disney]] first tried to adapt ''Alice'' into a feature-length animated film in the 1930s and revived the idea in the 1940s. The film was originally intended to be a [[live-action/animated film]], but Disney decided it would be a fully animated film.\n\n''Alice in Wonderland'' was considered a disappointment on its initial release, therefore was shown on television as one of the first episodes of ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland]]''. Its 1974 re-release in theaters proved to be much more successful, leading to subsequent re-releases, merchandising and home video releases. Although the film received generally negative critical reviews on its initial release, it has been more positively reviewed over the years.\n\nA [[computer-animated series|CGI-animated]] [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot series]], ''[[Alice's Wonderland Bakery]]'', premiered on February 9, 2022.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please do not expand any further. Wikipedia's Manual of Style says plot summaries should be 400 to 700 words long; this plot is currently 679 words long. -->\nIn a park in [[England]], a young girl named [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] with her cat, Dinah, listens distractedly to her sister's history lesson, and begins daydreaming of a nonsensical world. She spots a passing [[White Rabbit]] in a waistcoat, who panics of being late. Alice follows him into a burrow and plummets down a deep rabbit hole. Upon landing in a place called [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]], she finds herself facing a tiny door, whose handle advises drinking from a bottle on a nearby table. She [[Resizing (fiction)|shrinks to an appropriate height]], but has forgotten the key on the table. She then eats a cookie that causes her to grow excessively. Exasperated by these changes of state, she begins to cry and floods the room with her tears. She takes another sip from the bottle to shrink again, and rides the empty bottle through the keyhole. As Alice continues to follow the Rabbit after encountering a \"Caucus Race\", she encounters numerous characters, including [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]], who recount the tale of \"[[The Walrus and the Carpenter]]\". Alice tracks the Rabbit to his house; he mistakes her for his housemaid, \"Mary Ann\", and sends her inside to retrieve his gloves. While searching for the gloves, Alice finds and eats another cookie and grows giant, getting stuck in the house. Thinking her a monster, the Rabbit asks the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] to help expel her. When the Dodo decides to burn the house down, Alice escapes by eating a carrot from the Rabbit's garden, which causes her to shrink to 3 inches tall.\n\nContinuing to follow the Rabbit, Alice meets a garden of talking flowers who initially welcome her with [[All in the Golden Afternoon|a song]], but then banish her, believing that humans are a type of weed. Alice then encounters a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Caterpillar]] smoking, who becomes enraged at Alice after she laments her small size (which is the same as the Caterpillar's), after which the Caterpillar turns into a butterfly and flies away. Before leaving, the Caterpillar advises Alice to eat a piece from different sides of a mushroom to alter her size. Following a period of trial and error, she returns to her original height and keeps the remaining pieces in her pocket. In the woods, Alice gets stuck between multiple paths and encounters the mischievous [[Cheshire Cat]], who suggests questioning the [[The Hatter|Mad Hatter]] or the [[March Hare]] to learn the Rabbit's location, but is unhelpful in giving directions. Taking her own path, Alice encounters both, along with the [[The Dormouse|Dormouse]], in the midst of an \"[[unbirthday]]\" tea party celebration. The Hatter and the Hare ask Alice to explain her predicament, to which Alice tries but becomes frustrated by their interruptions and absurd logic. As she prepares to leave, the Rabbit appears and the Hatter attempts to repair his [[pocket watch]], which results in its destruction. Alice attempts to follow the Rabbit after he is ejected from the premises, but decides to go home instead. Unfortunately, her surroundings completely change, leaving her lost in the forest.\n\nThe Cheshire Cat reappears to the despondent Alice and offers a path to the hot-headed [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]], the only one in Wonderland who can take her home. In the Queen's labyrinthine garden, Alice witnesses the Queen \u2013 whom the Rabbit serves as a [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] \u2013 sentencing a trio of playing cards to decapitation for painting mistakenly-planted white rosebushes red. The Queen invites a reluctant Alice to play against her in a [[croquet]] match, in which live flamingos, card guards, and hedgehogs are used as equipment. The equipment rig the game in favor of the Queen. The Cat appears again and plays a trick on the Queen, setting up Alice to be framed. Before the Queen can sentence her to decapitation, the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King]] suggests a formal trial. At Alice's trial, the Cat invokes more chaos by having Alice point him out, causing one of the witnesses \u2013 the Dormouse \u2013 to panic. As the Queen sentences Alice to decapitation, Alice eats the mushroom pieces to grow large, momentarily intimidating the court. However, the mushroom's effect is short-lived, forcing Alice to flee through the deteriorating realm with a large crowd in pursuit. When Alice reaches the small door she encountered, she sees herself sleeping through the keyhole. Alice emerges from her dream, and she returns home for tea with her sister.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Kathryn Beaumont]] as [[Alice (Disney)|Alice]]\n* [[Ed Wynn]] as [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)#Disney|Mad Hatter]]\n* [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] as [[March Hare#Disney Animated Film|March Hare]]\n* [[Richard Haydn]] as [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)#Disney film|Caterpillar]]\n* [[Sterling Holloway]] as [[Cheshire Cat#Cultural uses|Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[Verna Felton]] as [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)#Disney|Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[J.

The last of ''Newman Laugh-O-Grams'' was called ''[[Alice's Wonderland]],'' which was loosely inspired by the ''Alice'' books. The short featured a live-action girl ([[Virginia Davis]]) interacting with an animated world. Faced with business problems, however, the Laugh-O-Gram Studio went bankrupt in July 1923, and the film was never released to the general public. However, Disney left for Hollywood and used the film to show to potential distributors. [[Margaret J. Winkler]] of Winkler Pictures agreed to distribute the ''Alice Comedies,'' and Disney partnered with his older brother [[Roy O. Disney]] and re-hired Kansas City co-workers including [[Ub Iwerks]], [[Rudolph Ising]], [[Friz Freleng]], [[Carman Maxwell]] and [[Hugh Harman]] to form the Disney Brothers Studios, which was later re-branded Walt Disney Productions.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=38\u20139}} The series began in 1924 before being retired in 1927.\n\nIn 1933, Disney considered making a feature-length animated-and-live-action version of ''Alice'' starring [[Mary Pickford]].<ref name=\"ThroughtheKeyhole\" /><ref name=\"Reflections\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Alice in Wonderland: Special Un-Anniversary Edition - Reflections on Alice|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|year=2010|type=DVD}}</ref> However, these plans were eventually scrapped in favor of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', mainly because Disney was put off by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s 1933 live-action adaptation ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1933 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''.<ref name=\"ThroughtheKeyhole\"/> However, Disney did not completely abandon the idea of adapting ''Alice'', and in 1936 he made the ''[[Mickey Mouse (film series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' cartoon ''[[Thru the Mirror]]''.\n\nIn 1938, after the enormous success of ''Snow White'', Disney bought the film rights of ''Alice in Wonderland'' with [[Sir John Tenniel]]'s illustrations,{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=486}} and officially registered the title with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. He then hired storyboard artist Al Perkins and art director [[David S. Hall (art director)|David S. Hall]] to develop the story and concept art for the film.<ref name=\"ThroughtheKeyhole\"/> A [[Traditional animation#story reel|story reel]] was completed in 1939, but Disney was not pleased; he felt that Hall's drawings resembled Tenniel's drawings too closely, making them too difficult to animate, and that the overall tone of Perkins' script was too grotesque and dark.<ref name=\"ThroughtheKeyhole\"/> Realizing the amount of work needed for ''Alice in Wonderland'', and with the economic devastation of [[World War II]] and the production demands of ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', and ''[[Bambi]]'', Disney shelved production on ''Alice in Wonderland'' shortly after the screening.<ref name=\"Reflections\"/>\n\nIn fall 1945, shortly after the war ended, Disney revived ''Alice in Wonderland'' and hired British author [[Aldous Huxley]] to re-write the script. Huxley devised a story in which Lewis Carroll and [[Alice Liddell]] (the inspiration for Alice) were misunderstood and persecuted following the book's publication. In Huxley's story, stage actress [[Ellen Terry]] was sympathetic to both Carroll and Liddell, and [[Queen Victoria]] served as the [[deus ex machina]], validating Carroll due to her appreciation for the book.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=392}} Disney considered child actress [[Margaret O'Brien]] for the title role.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=459}} However, he felt that Huxley's version was too literal an adaptation of Carroll's book.<ref name=\"Reflections\"/> [[Background artist]] [[Mary Blair]] submitted some concept drawings for ''Alice in Wonderland''. Blair's paintings moved away from Tenniel's detailed illustrations by taking a [[Modernism|modernist]] stance, using bold and unreal colors. Walt liked Blair's designs, and the script was re-written to focus on comedy, music, and the whimsical side of Carroll's books.<ref name=\"Reflections\"/>\n\nAround this time, Disney considered making a live-action-and-animated version of ''Alice in Wonderland'' (similar to his short ''Alice Comedies'') that would star [[Ginger Rogers]] and would utilize the recently developed [[sodium vapor process]].{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=486}} [[Lisa Davis (actress)|Lisa Davis]] (who later voiced Anita Radcliffe in ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'') and [[Luana Patten]] were also considered for the role of Alice.<ref name=\"Reflections\"/><ref>{{cite interview|last=Braun|first=Amy|url=https://www.dvdizzy.com/lisadavis-interview.html|title=UltimateDisney.com's Interview with Lisa Davis, the voice and model for 101 Dalmatians' Anita Radcliff|publisher=DVDizzy|date=March 4, 2008}}</ref> However, Disney soon realized that he could only do justice to the book by making an all-animated feature and, in 1946, work began on ''Alice in Wonderland''.<ref name=\"ThroughtheKeyhole\"/> With the film tentatively scheduled for release in 1950,{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=394}} animation crews on ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' effectively competed against each other to see which film would finish first.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=459}} By early 1948, ''Cinderella'' had progressed further than ''Alice in Wonderland''.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=398}}\n\nA legal dispute with [[Dallas Bower]]'s [[Alice in Wonderland (1949 film)|1949 film version]] was also under way.<ref>[https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-disney-alice-that-never-was-except-on-records/ The Disney \"Alice\" That Never Was...Except on Records|Cartoon Research]</ref><ref>[http://sensesofcinema.com/2018/alice-in-wonderland/lou-bunins-alice-wonderland/ Senses of Cinema]</ref> Disney sued to prevent release of the British version in the U.S., and the case was extensively covered in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]].<ref name=\"time.com\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889135,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328183004/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889135,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 28, 2010|title=Cinema: Battle of Wonderland|date=16 July 1951|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=29 September 2009}}</ref> The company that released the British version accused Disney of trying to exploit their film by releasing its version at virtually the same time.<ref name=\"time.com\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nThrough various drafts of the script, many sequences that were present in Carroll's book drifted in and out of the story. However, Disney insisted that the scenes themselves keep close to those in the novel since most of its humor is in the writing.<ref name=\"ThroughtheKeyhole\"/>\n\nOne [[Deleted scene|omitted scene]] from the 1939 treatment of the film occurred outside the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]' manor, where the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#Fish Footman|Fish Footman]] is giving a message to the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#Frog Footman|Frog Footman]] to take to the Duchess, saying that she is invited to play croquet with the Queen of Hearts. Alice overhears this and sneaks into the kitchen of the manor, where she finds [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Duchess's Cook|the Duchess' Cook]] maniacally cooking and the Duchess nursing her baby. The cook is spraying pepper all over the room, causing the Duchess and Alice to sneeze and the baby to cry. After a quick conversation between Alice and the Duchess, the hot-tempered Cook starts throwing pots and pans at the noisy baby. Alice rescues the baby, but as she leaves the house the baby turns into a pig and runs away.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary Edition - Deleted Scene: \"The Pig and Pepper\"|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|year=2011|type=Blu-Ray}}</ref> The scene was scrapped for pacing reasons.\n\nAnother scene that was deleted from a later draft occurred in Tulgey Wood, where Alice encountered what appeared to be a sinister-looking [[Jabberwocky]] hiding in the dark, before revealing himself as a comical-looking dragon-like beast with bells and factory whistles on his head. A song, \"Beware the Jabberwock\", was also written. However, the scene was scrapped in favor of ''The Walrus and the Carpenter'' poem.<ref name=\"ThroughtheKeyhole\"/> Out of a desire to keep the Jabberwocky poem in the film, it was made to replace an original song for the Cheshire Cat, \"I'm Odd\".\n\nAnother deleted scene in Tulgey Wood shows Alice consulting with [[White Knight (Through the Looking-Glass)|The White Knight]], who was meant to be somewhat a caricature of Walt Disney. Although Disney liked the scene, he felt it was better if Alice learned her lesson by herself, hence the song \"Very Good Advice\".<ref name=\"ThroughtheKeyhole\"/>\n\nOther characters, such as [[Mock Turtle]] and the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]] were discarded for pacing reasons, though they would later appear alongside Alice in some commercials.\n\n== Music ==\nIn an effort to retain some of Carroll's imaginative poems, Disney commissioned top songwriters to compose songs built around them for use in the film. Over 30 potential songs were written, and many of them were included in the film\u2014some for only a few seconds\u2014the greatest number of songs of any Disney film. In 1939, [[Frank Churchill]] was assigned to compose songs, and they were accompanied by a story reel featuring artwork from David S. Hall. Although none of his songs were used in the finished film, the melody for \"Lobster Quadrille\" was used for the song \"[[Never Smile at a Crocodile]]\" in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]''. When work on ''Alice'' resumed in 1946, [[Tin Pan Alley]] songwriters [[Mack David]], [[Al Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Livingston]] began composing songs for it after working on ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''. However, the only song by the trio that made it into the film was \"The Unbirthday Song\".<ref name=\"Bohn\">{{cite book|last=Bohn|first=James|title=Music In Disney's Animated Features: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Jungle Book|chapter=Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|isbn=978-1496812148|year=2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was composing songs in New York, [[Sammy Fain]] had heard that the Disney studios wanted him to compose songs for ''Alice in Wonderland''.

RCA Victor released a story album and single records with Kathryn Beaumont and several cast members that re-created the story, but it was not the soundtrack. in 1944, [[Decca Records]] had released a [[Ginger Rogers]] dramatization of Lewis Carroll's book with Disney cover art (perhaps tying in with earlier discussions of her being cast as a live-action Disney \"Alice\"),<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Disney \"Alice\" That Never Was\u2026 Except on Records {{!}}|url=https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-disney-alice-that-never-was-except-on-records/|access-date=2021-04-09|website=cartoonresearch.com}}</ref> Decca did indeed license the rights to release the 1951 Alice soundtrack from Disney, but later decided against it and never produced one. When Disney started its own record company, [[Disneyland Records]], in Spring 1956, it was found to be economically unfeasible at the time to take on the fees and other costs to produce a soundtrack album.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sadoff|first=Ronald H.|date=October 2007|title=Mouse Tracks: The Story of Walt Disney Records.

More famously, all five Disneyland-style theme parks feature [[Mad Tea Party]], a [[teacups]] ride based on Disney's adaptation of ''Alice in Wonderland''.\n\n''Alice in Wonderland'' is also frequently featured in many parades and shows in the Disney Theme Parks, including [[Main Street Electrical Parade|The Main Street Electrical Parade]], [[SpectroMagic]], ''[[Fantasmic!]]'', [[Main Street Electrical Parade|Dreamlights]], The Move It! Shake It! Celebrate It! Street Party and [[Walt Disney's Parade of Dreams]]. [[Disneyland]] contains a [[Alice in Wonderland (Disneyland attraction)|dark ride based on the film]] in addition to the teacups,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/?name=MadTeaPartyAttractionPage |title=Disneyland's Mad Tea Party Page |access-date=July 13, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100620214255/http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/parks/attractions/detail?name=MadTeaPartyAttractionPage| archive-date= June 20, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> and [[Disneyland Paris]] also contains a hedge maze called [[Alice's Curious Labyrinth]], which takes its inspiration from the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://parks.disneylandparis.co.uk/disneyland-park/lands/fantasyland/attractions/alices-curious-labyrinth.xhtml |title=Disneyland Paris' Alice's Curious Labyrinth Page |access-date=July 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105234406/http://parks.disneylandparis.co.uk/disneyland-park/lands/fantasyland/attractions/alices-curious-labyrinth.xhtml |archive-date=January 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The now-defunct [[Mickey Mouse Revue]], shown at [[Walt Disney World]] and later at [[Tokyo Disneyland]], contained characters and scenes from the film.\n\n=== Video games ===\nIn ''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]'', the Queen of Hearts is one of the villains who tries to turn the ending to her story to where she finally cuts off Alice's head.\n\n''[[Mickey Mousecapade]]'' features various characters from the film. The Japanese version, in fact, is based very heavily on the film, with almost every reference in the game coming from the film.\n\nA [[Alice in Wonderland (2000 video game)|video game version]] of the film was released on [[Game Boy Color]] by [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]] on October 4, 2000, in North America.\n\nThe ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' video game series includes Wonderland as a playable world in the titles ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories|Chain of Memories]]'', ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days|358/2 Days]]'', ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded|Coded]]'', and ''[[Kingdom Hearts \u03c7]]''. In the games, Alice is one of seven \"Princesses of Heart\", a group of maidens who are a major part of the plot in the series. Other characters from the film that appear in the games include the Queen of Hearts and the Card Soldiers (also [[Boss (video games)|enemies]] in the games), Cheshire Cat, White Rabbit, Doorknob, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and the Caterpillar (this last in the non-official ''Kingdom Hearts V Cast'' game only).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/kingdomhearts/ |title=Kingdom Hearts Official Page |access-date=July 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Toy Story 3: The Video Game]]'', the Mad Hatter's hat is one of the hats you can have the townsfolk wear. In ''[[Kinect Disneyland Adventures]]'', Alice, Mad Hatter, White Rabbit, and the Queen of Hearts make appearances.\n\nIn ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'', there are Power Discs based on ''Alice in Wonderland''.\n\nSeveral characters of the movie make appearances throughout the Epic Mickey-games. For example, the cards are seen throughout Mickeyjunk Mountain in the original ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', Alice appears as a statue carrying a projector screen in ''[[Epic Mickey 2]]'' and Alice, the Mad Hatter, and the Cheshire Cat appear as unlockable characters in ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]''.\n\nAlice, White Rabbit, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Cheshire Cat, Queen of Hearts and Caterpillar appear as playable characters in ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]'', along with some attractions based on locations of the film or real attractions from Disney Parks, as content to unlock for a limited time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWpzbzxU_K4 |title=Update 15: Alice in Wonderland {{!}} Livestream|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=October 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Cover versions===\nThe [[Alice in Wonderland (song)|theme song of the same name]] has since become a [[jazz standard]] by the likes of [[Roberta Gambarini]], [[Bill Evans]] and [[Dave Brubeck]].<ref>[https://www.cartoonbrew.com/cartoon-culture/jazz-giant-dave-brubeck-who-made-disney-music-cool-dies-at-91-74503.html Jazz Legend Dave Brubeck (1920-2012)|Cartoon Brew]</ref><ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/disney-jazz-vol-1-everybody-wants-to-be-a-cat-mw0002062820 Disney Jazz, Vol.1: Everybody Wants to Be a Cat|AllMusic]</ref><ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{allMusic|first=Ken|last=Dryden|class=album|id=mw0000387086|title=Bill Evans: ''The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961'' \u2013 Review|access-date= April 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Film|United States|Fantasy|Comedy|1950s}}\n* ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010), a live-action film adaptation of Carroll's works and a re-imagining of the story directed by [[Tim Burton]].
