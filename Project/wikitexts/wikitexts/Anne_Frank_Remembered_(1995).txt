The film was produced in association with the [[Anne Frank House]], [[Disney Channel]], and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], and features narration by [[Kenneth Branagh]] and extracts from Frank's diary read by [[Glenn Close]]. It originally aired on television in April 1995 before it was screened theatrically by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] in February 1996.\n\n[[Miep Gies]], the woman who had helped shelter the family, and who had saved the diary after the group was betrayed, collaborated with Blair and is interviewed about her memories of hiding the Frank family. Blair also uses interviews with [[Hannah Pick-Goslar]] (\"Hanneli\") and Jaqueline van Maarsen, two of Anne Frank's friends, and notably uses archive interviews of [[Otto Frank]] to retell Anne's story.\n\nThe film also records the first meeting between Miep Gies and Werner Peter Pfeffer, the son of Fritz Pfeffer (\"Albert Dussel\" in the ''Diary''), who died two months after filming. In a moving scene, filmed as it happened, a tearful Pfeffer offers \"Vielen Dank\" (\"many thanks\") to Gies for her efforts to save his father.\n\nBlair filmed in the real locations of Frank's life; including the neighbourhood Anne grew up in, the \"Achterhuis\" of [[Prinsengracht]] 263 (where she and her family lived in hiding) in [[Amsterdam]], and the [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] and [[Auschwitz Concentration Camp]]s.  Blair commented that Auschwitz had been filmed a number of times, for many reasons; however, he wanted to suggest something of the \"ghosts\" of the people who had passed through there, and so he determined that the only way to do this would be to film at night.  He was also able to obtain a train similar to those used during [[World War II]] to recreate the scenes of people being transported to Auschwitz.\n\nAs the film was made in association with [[Anne Frank House]], it was able to include the only known film footage taken of Anne Frank.  The short film was made in 1941 of a wedding in the Amsterdam suburb where the Frank family lived.   The camera cuts for just seven seconds to a balcony, where Anne Frank stands watching the bride and groom on the footpath below.\n\nThe film won an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] in 1996.<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/135803/Anne-Frank-Remembered/details|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301043030/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/135803/Anne-Frank-Remembered/details|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-03-01|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2009|title=NY Times: Anne Frank Remembered |access-date=2008-11-21}}</ref> The award was jointly collected by Jon Blair and Miep Gies, who received a standing ovation during the award ceremony.<ref name=\"www.youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0chy8CPuts |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211212/h0chy8CPuts| archive-date=2021-12-12 |url-status=live|title=\"Anne Frank Remembered\" winning Best Documentary Feature Oscar|access-date=4 May 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 29 reviews, and an average rating of 8/10.<ref name=\"rottentomatoes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/anne_frank_remembered/|title=Anne Frank Remembered (1995)|publisher=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959 film)\n*''[[The Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank]]'' (1988 TV film)\n*''[[Anne Frank: The Whole Story]]'' (2001 mini series)\n* [[List of Holocaust films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official|http://annefrankremembered.co.uk}}\n*[http://www.sonyclassics.com/annefrank/index.html ''Anne Frank Remembered''] at [[Sony Pictures Classics]]\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gkv53''Anne Frank Remembered''] at [[BBC]]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0112373|title= Anne Frank Remembered}}\n*[http://www.sonyclassics.com/annefrank/misc/interview.html Sony classics interview with Jon Blair about the making of ''Anne Frank Remembered'']\n*[http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=475&LID=2 Anne Frank House link to film image of Anne Frank (requires QuickTime Player)]\n*{{Mojo title|annefrankremembered}}\n\n{{Anne Frank in other forms}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''Anne Frank Remembered''\n|list =\n{{AcademyAwardBestDocumentaryFeature1981-2000}}\n{{Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Documentary Film}}\n{{InternationalEmmyAward Documentary}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:1995 television films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jon Blair]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Best Documentary Feature Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about Anne Frank]]\n[[Category:Films set in Germany]]\n[[Category:1995 documentary films]]\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
