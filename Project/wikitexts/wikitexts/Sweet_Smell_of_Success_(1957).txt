The shadowy noir [[cinematography]] filmed on location in [[New York City]] was shot by [[James Wong Howe]]. The picture was produced by [[James Hill (American film producer)|James Hill]] of [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions]] and released by [[United Artists]]. The supporting cast features [[Sam Levene]], [[Barbara Nichols]], [[Joe Frisco]], [[Edith Atwater]], [[David White (actor)|David White]] and [[Emile Meyer]]. The musical score was arranged and conducted by [[Elmer Bernstein]] and the film also features jazz performances by the [[Chico Hamilton Quintet]]. [[Mary Grant Price|Mary Grant]] designed the costumes.\n\nThe film tells the story of powerful and sleazy newspaper columnist J.J. Hunsecker (portrayed by Lancaster and based on [[Walter Winchell]]) who uses his connections to ruin his sister's relationship with a man he deems unworthy of her.\n\nDespite a poorly received preview screening, ''Sweet Smell of Success'' has greatly improved in stature over the years. It is now highly acclaimed by film critics, particularly for its cinematography and screenplay. In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref>\n\n''[[Sweet Smell of Success: The Musical]]'' was created by [[Marvin Hamlisch]], [[Craig Carnelia]], and [[John Guare]] in 2002.\n\n==Plot==\nMorally bankrupt [[Manhattan]] press agent Sidney Falco is a frustrated fringe player who, of late, has been unable to gain positive publicity for his clients in media kingpin J.J. Hunsecker's influential, nationally syndicated newspaper column. Hunsecker is overly protective of his younger sister Susan, and seeks to derail her romance with up-and-coming [[jazz guitarist]] Steve Dallas.<ref name= \"Dirks\">{{cite news | last = Dirks | first = Tim | title = '' Sweet Smell of Success'' (1957) | work = Filmsite | url = http://www.filmsite.org/sweet.html | access-date = April 16, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn return for a failed promise, the bullying Hunsecker offers Falco the opportunity to make good by breaking the couple up. Falco is losing money and clients, and knows this crucial back-scratch could save his career. Sidney hopes to plant a rumor in a rival column that Dallas is a [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]-smoking [[Communist]], enough to get him fired from the jazz club where his combo plays. Hunsecker will then gain points with Susan by defending Dallas and getting his job back, with Falco counting on an overly prideful Dallas rejecting a tainted favor.\n\nTo get his dirt planted, Falco plans to blackmail a prominent columnist by threatening to expose his marital infidelity. Instead, the columnist chooses exposure over his journalistic integrity - which even his wife praises as his first decent act in years. Falco then bribes a second columnist with a sexual favor to be provided by a cigarette girl he has a friendly relationship with, misleading her into waiting for him in his bedroom only to arrive with the columnist - a new low, even for Falco. He flips her outrage by claiming he is doing it to help her career. The lies get printed and Dallas' jazz group is fired from the club.\n\nAs planned, in Dallas and Susan's presence Hunsecker theatrically gets Dallas rehired with a phone call, but Dallas still insults and denounces J.J. for his malignant influence on society. Forced to choose between them, Susan breaks up with Dallas in order to protect him from her vengeful brother. In spite of this, Hunsecker is so incensed by Dallas's insults - which he twists around to characterize as attacks on his loyal, patriotic audience - that he escalates things. Holding Falco's feet to the fire, he orders the shill to plant marijuana on Dallas then have him arrested and roughed up by corrupt police lieutenant Harry Kello,<ref name= \"Dirks\"/> a move so dirty even Falco recoils from it. To swing him round, Hunsecker dangles three months of writing his column while J.J. takes Susan to Europe to forget about Steve.\n\nIt proves too much to resist. At the jazz club, Falco slips marijuana cigarettes into the pocket of Dallas's coat. Dallas is accosted by Kello outside the club and beaten so badly he ends up in the hospital. Falco then celebrates at a bar where, surrounded by his industry pals, he toasts to his favorite perfume, \"success\".\n\nThe festivities are interrupted when Falco is summoned to Hunsecker's penthouse apartment, where he finds Susan in her nightgown about to jump off the balcony.<ref name= \"Dirks\"/> Falco stops her, then lectures her and calls her childish. Hunsecker arrives to find Falco and Susan in an outwardly compromising position in her bedroom, as Falco begins to suspect that Susan has set him up. Unable to talk himself out of what seems like a trap, Falco is brutally slapped around by Hunsecker. Livid, Falco reveals to Susan that her brother conspired to frame Dallas. Hunsecker then calls Kello and deems Dallas innocent and Falco guilty of planting evidence. Falco declares that Kello's beating will not stop him from making the whole story public and leaves. As he exits the building, he is caught in [[Times Square]] by the brutal cop.\n\nSusan packs a bag to leave. Stopped by J.J., she explains that she indeed had attempted suicide, having considered death preferable to living with him, and that she is leaving to be with Dallas. A distraught J.J. then watches from the balcony as she walks past Falco's beaten form into the coming dawn.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as J. J.

[[Harold Hecht]] refused and asked him to start work on another project \u2013 adapting Ernest Lehman\u2019s novellette ''Sweet Smell of Success'' into a film.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=140}}\n\nLehman\u2019s story had originally appeared in the April 1950 issue of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', renamed \"Tell Me About It Tomorrow!\" because the editor of the magazine did not want the word \"smell\" in the publication.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=140}} It was based on his own experiences working as an assistant to Irving Hoffman, a New York press agent and columnist for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. Hoffman subsequently did not speak to Lehman for a year and a half.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=141}} Hoffman then wrote a column for ''The Hollywood Reporter'' speculating that Lehman would make a good screenwriter, and within a week Paramount called Lehman, inviting him to Los Angeles for talks. Lehman forged a screenwriting career in Hollywood, writing ''[[Executive Suite]]'', ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]],'' ''[[North by Northwest]],'' ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'', and ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]''.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=141}}\n\n===Pre-production===\nBy the time Hecht-Hill-Lancaster acquired ''Success'', Lehman was in position to not only adapt his own novelette but also produce and direct the film.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=141}} After scouting locations, Lehman was told by Hecht that distributor [[United Artists]] was having second thoughts about going with a first-time director, so Hecht offered the film to Mackendrick. Initially, the director had reservations about trying to film such a dialogue-heavy screenplay, so he and Lehman worked on it for weeks to make it more cinematic.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=142}} As the script neared completion, Lehman became ill and had to resign from the picture. [[James Hill (American film producer)|James Hill]] took over and offered [[Paddy Chayefsky]] as Lehman's replacement. Mackendrick suggested [[Clifford Odets]], the playwright whose reputation as a left-wing hero had been tarnished after he named names before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].\n\nMackendrick assumed that Odets would need only two or three weeks to polish the script, but he took four months. The director recalled, \"We started shooting with no final script at all, while Clifford reconstructed the thing from stem to stern\".{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=143}} The plot was largely intact, but in Mackendrick's biography he is quoted from ''Notes on Sweet Smell of Success'': \"What Clifford did, in effect, was dismantle the structure of every single sequence in order to rebuild situations and relationships that were much more complex, had much greater tension and more dramatic energy\".{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=143}} This process took time, and the start date for the production could not be delayed. Odets had to accompany the production to [[Manhattan]] and continued rewriting while they shot there. Returning to the city that had shunned him for going to Hollywood made Odets very neurotic and obsessed with all kinds of rituals as he worked at a furious pace, with pages often going straight from his typewriter to being shot the same day. Mackendrick said, \"So we cut the script there on the floor, with the actors, just cutting down lines, making them more spare \u2013 what Clifford would have done himself, really, had there been time\".{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=144}}\n\nTony Curtis had to fight for the role of Sidney Falco because [[Universal Studios|Universal]], the studio to which he was contracted, was worried that it would ruin his career.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=145}} Tired of doing pretty-boy roles and wanting to prove that he could act, Curtis got his way. [[Orson Welles]] was originally considered for the role of J. J. Hunsecker. Mackendrick wanted to cast [[Hume Cronyn]] because he felt that Cronyn closely resembled [[Walter Winchell]], the basis for the Hunsecker character in the novelette.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=145}} Lehman makes the distinction in an interview that Winchell was the inspiration for the version of the character in the novelette, and that this differs from the character in the film version. United Artists wanted Burt Lancaster in the role because of his box office appeal and his successful pairing with Curtis on ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]''.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=145}}  [[Robert Vaughn]] was signed to a contract with Lancaster's film company and was to have played the Steve Dallas role but was [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the Army before he could begin the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hikaritakano.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=239&Itemid=133 |title=Hikari Takano Interviews &#124; Robert Vaughn Interview Transcript - Open Source Transcripts - Robert Vaughn Interview Transcript Ro &#124; hikaritakano.com |publisher=www.HikariTakano.com |access-date=June 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414040508/http://www.hikaritakano.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=239&Itemid=133 |archive-date=April 14, 2010 }}</ref> [[Ernest Borgnine]], contracted to Hecht-Hill-Lancaster since ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' (1955) was offered a role in the film but turned it down as his role was only seven pages long in the script.

In ''Notes on Sweet Smell of Success'', Mackendrick said, \"One of the characteristic aspects of New York, particularly of the area between 42nd Street and 57th Street, is the neurotic energy of the crowded sidewalks. This was, I argued, essential to the story of characters driven by the uglier aspects of ambition and greed\".{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=145}} He took multiple photographs of the city from several fixed points and taped the pictures into a series of panoramas that he stuck on a wall and studied once he got back to Hollywood.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=146}}\n\nCellist [[Fred Katz (cellist)|Fred Katz]] and drummer [[Chico Hamilton]], who briefly appear in the film as themselves, wrote a score for the movie, which was ultimately rejected in favor of one by [[Elmer Bernstein]].<ref>Butler, David. (2002) ''Jazz Noir: listening to music from Phantom Lady to The Last Seduction''. Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-275-97301-8}}, p. 136</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\nMackendrick shot the film in late 1956, and was scared the entire time because Hecht-Hill-Lancaster had a reputation for firing their directors for any or even no reason at all.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=147}} The filmmaker was used to extensive rehearsals before a scene was shot and often found himself shooting a script page one or two hours after Odets had written it. Lancaster's presence proved to be intimidating for numerous individuals involved with the production; at one point, Lehman had been approached to direct the film, but declined due to his fear of Lancaster, although Hecht maintained that Lehman had never been offered the chance to direct. Mackendrick and composer Elmer Bernstein both found Lancaster intimidating, with Bernstein later recalling, \"Burt was really scary. He was a dangerous guy. He had a short fuse\".{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=147}}<ref name=nare>{{cite book |last=Naremore |first=James |date= July 6, 2010 |title=Sweet Smell of Success: A BFI Film Classic |publisher=British Film Institute |isbn=978-1844572885 }}</ref> Mackendrick decided to use Lancaster's volatility to work for the character of JJ, asking that Lancaster wear his own [[browline glasses]], which Mackendrick felt gave him the presence of \"a scholarly brute\".<ref name=nare/> Mackendrick smeared a thin layer of vaseline on the lenses, preventing Lancaster from focusing his eyes and giving him a perpetually blank gaze. Assisted by cinematographer [[James Wong Howe]], Mackendrick intentionally filmed scenes with JJ from a low angle using a [[wide-angle lens]] and with overhead lighting directly above Lancaster, so that the spectacle frames cast shadows on his face.<ref name=nare/>\n\nShooting on location in New York City also added to Mackendrick's anxieties. Exteriors were shot in the busiest, noisiest areas with crowds of young Tony Curtis fans occasionally breaking through police barriers. Mackendrick remembered, \"We started shooting in [[Times Square]] at rush hour, and we had high-powered actors and a camera crane and police help and all the rest of it, but we didn\u2019t have any script. We knew where we were going vaguely, but that\u2019s all\".{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=147}}\n\n==Musical score and soundtrack==\n{{main|Sweet Smell of Success (soundtrack)}}\n\n==Reaction==\nA [[preview screening]] of ''Sweet Smell of Success'' was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were expecting him to play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members \"curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust\".{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=161}} Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, \"finding the film too static and talky\".{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=161}}\n\nThe film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. \"The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose over a million dollars on this picture,'\" Hill recalled.{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=161}} According to Lehman, Lancaster blamed him, claiming that: \"Burt threatened me at a party after the preview. He said, 'You didn't have to leave \u2013 you could have made this a much better picture. I ought to beat you up.' I said, 'Go ahead \u2013 I could use the money.'\"{{sfn|Kemp|1991|p=161}}\n\nAlthough he and Hecht would fire [[Alexander Mackendrick|Mackendrick]] from ''[[The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)|The Devil's Disciple]]'' for the same painstaking (and costly) approach, [[Burt Lancaster|Lancaster]] was quoted as saying that he felt Mackendrick had done a fantastic job for ''Sweet Smell of Success'' and that it wasn't his fault the film lost money.<ref name=\"A Singular Man\">{{cite book|last1=Karney|first1=Robyn|title=Burt Lancaster}}</ref> He also believed that [[Tony Curtis|Curtis]] should have gotten an Oscar for his role as Falco.<ref name=\"A Singular Man\" />\n\n''Sweet Smell of Success'' premiered in New York at [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loew's]] State in Times Square on June 27, 1957.<ref name= \"Kashner\">{{cite news\n | last = Kashner\n | first = Sam\n | title = A Movie Marked Danger paragraph \n | work = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]\n | date = April 2010\n | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/classic/features/movie-marked-danger-200004\n | access-date = April 7, 2010 }}</ref> Critical reaction was much more favorable.
