As with most Tati films, ''Mon Oncle'' is largely a visual comedy; color and lighting are employed to help tell the story.  The dialogue in ''Mon Oncle'' is barely audible, and largely subordinated to the role of a sound effect. The drifting noises of heated arguments and idle banter complement other sounds and the physical movements of the characters, intensifying comedic effect.  The complex soundtrack also uses music to characterize environments, including a lively musical theme that represents Hulot's world of comical inefficiency and freedom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nAt its debut in 1958 in France, ''Mon Oncle'' was denounced by some critics for what they viewed as a reactionary or even ''[[Pierre Poujade#Poujadism|poujadiste]]'' view of an emerging French consumer society, which had lately embraced a new wave of industrial modernization and a more rigid social structure.<ref name=\"LASp13\">''Les Ann\u00e9es Sauvages: Mon Oncle'', ARTE Magazine, 20.45 Cin\u00e9ma, 30 Decembre 2002, p. 13 [http://www.artepro.com/fr_fichiers/bulletin/2003bull01a.pdf Article]</ref>  However, this criticism soon gave way in the face of the film's huge popularity in France and abroad \u2013 even in the U.S., where rampant discretionary consumption and a recession had caused those on both the right and the left to question the economic and social values of the era.<ref>[[Ruth Feldstein|Feldstein, Ruth]], ''Motherhood in Black and White: Race and Sex in American Liberalism, 1930-1965'', [[Cornell University Press]] (2000), {{ISBN|0-8014-8438-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8438-4}}, pp. 115-116</ref><ref>Tucker, David M., ''The Decline of Thrift in America: Our Cultural Shift from Saving to Spending'', Greenwood Publishing Group (1991), {{ISBN|0-275-93685-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-93685-3}}, pp. 137-139</ref> The film was another big success for Tati, with a total of 4,576,928 admissions in France.<ref name=\"JPBox Office\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=9477|title=Mon oncle (1958) - JPBox-Office|last=JP|website=www.jpbox-office.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nM. Hulot ([[Jacques Tati]]) is the dreamy, impractical, and adored uncle of nine-year-old G\u00e9rard Arpel, who lives with his materialistic parents, M. and Mme. Arpel, in an ultra-modern geometric house and garden, Villa Arpel, in a new suburb of Paris, situated just beyond the crumbling stone buildings of the old neighborhoods of the city. G\u00e9rard's parents are entrenched in a machine-like existence of work, fixed gender roles, the acquisition of status through possessions, and conspicuous displays to impress guests, such as the fish-shaped fountain at the center of the garden that, in a [[running gag]], Mme. Arpel activates only for important visitors.\n\n[[File:Villa arpel.jpg|thumb|A replica of Villa Arpel at the [[Cent Quatre]] in Paris]]\nEach element of Villa Arpel is stylistically rather than functionally designed, creating an environment completely indifferent to the comfort, or lack of comfort, of its occupants. In choosing modern architecture to punctuate his satire, Tati once stated, \"''{{lang|fr|Les lignes g\u00e9om\u00e9triques ne rendent pas les gens aimables}}\"'' (\"geometrical lines do not produce likeable people\").<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Les Ann\u00e9es Sauvages: Mon Oncle|magazine=Arte Magazine|issue=20.45, Cin\u00e9ma|date=30 December 2002|page=2}}</ref> From inconveniently-located stepping stones, to difficult-to-sit-on furniture, to a kitchen filled with deafeningly loud appliances, every facet of Villa Arpel emphasizes the impracticality of a dedication to superficial aesthetics and electrical gadgets over the necessities of daily living.\n\nDespite the superficial beauty of its modern design,<ref>Weinberg, Larry, ''Mon Oncle'', InteriorDesign.net, 23 October 2008 [http://www.interiordesign.net/blog/1850000585/post/1790035379.html Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102081318/http://www.interiordesign.net/blog/1850000585/post/1790035379.html |date=2009-01-02 }}</ref> the Arpels' home is entirely impersonal, as are the Arpels themselves. In fact, M. and Mme. Arpel have completely subordinated their individuality to maintain their social position and their shiny new possessions. Tati emphasizes his themes surrounding the Arpel lifestyle (as well as M. Arpel's automatonic workplace, ''Plastac'') with monochromatic shades and cloudy days.\n\nBy contrast, Monsieur Hulot lives in an old and run-down city district.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Les Ann\u00e9es Sauvages: Mon Oncle|magazine=Arte Magazine|issue=20.45, Cin\u00e9ma|date=30 December 2002|page=13|quote=''{{lang|fr|Hulot pr\u00e9f\u00e8re la po\u00e9sie des terrains vagues, des chiens errants et des gamins blagueurs.}}'' (Hulot prefers the poetry of wasteland, stray dogs and prankster kids.)}}</ref> He is unemployed, and gets around town either on foot or on a ''[[V\u00e9loSoleX]]'' motorized bicycle. G\u00e9rard, utterly bored by the sterility and monotony of his life with his parents, fastens himself to his uncle at every opportunity. Hulot, little more than a child himself at times, is completely at home with G\u00e9rard, but also completely ineffectual at controlling his horseplay with his school friends, who take delight in tormenting adults with practical jokes.<ref name=\"LASp13\"/>  Exasperated at their relative's perceived immaturity, the Arpels soon scheme to saddle him with the twin yokes of family and business responsibilities.<ref name=\"LASp13\"/>\n\n==Cast== <!-- NYT points out the supporting actors are all non-professionals -->\n* [[Jacques Tati]] as [[Monsieur Hulot]]\n* Jean-Pierre Zola as Monsieur Arpel\n* Adrienne Servantie as Madame Arpel\n* Alain B\u00e9court as G\u00e9rard Arpel\n* Lucien Fr\u00e9gis as Monsieur Pichard\n* Betty Schneider as Betty (landlord's daughter)\n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Martial]] as Walter\n* Dominique Marie as Neighbor\n* [[Yvonne Arnaud]] as Georgette (the maid)\n* Adelaide Danieli as Madame Pichard\n* R\u00e9gis Fontenay as Braces dealer\n* Claude Badolle as Flea market dealer\n* Max Martel as Drunken man\n* [[Nicolas Bataille]] as Working man\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mon Oncle hulot.jpg|thumb|right|Tati as M.
