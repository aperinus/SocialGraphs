The film was a critical success and performed moderately well at the box office. The film has spawned [[Return of the Living Dead (film series)|four sequels]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn July 3, 1984, at the Uneeda medical supply warehouse, foreman Frank Johnson tries to impress new employee Freddy by showing him military drums of toxic gas called Trioxin that wound up in the basement of the building due to a delivery error years before. While hitting the side of a drum to prove it's secure, Frank accidentally unleashes the toxic gas, which seemingly melts the cadaver inside and reanimates another cadaver stored in a meat locker. Joined by their boss Burt, the three try to kill the reanimated corpse by puncturing the brain (which does not work), then dismembering the body. They discover that every part of the zombie's body can survive independently. Burt has the zombie incinerated at a nearby mortuary by his friend Ernie, but this inadvertently causes the deadly gas to contaminate the air, creating a toxic rainfall that reanimates the corpses in the nearby cemetery.\n\nMeanwhile, Freddy's girlfriend Tina and his friends Spider, Trash, Chuck, Casey, Scuz and Suicide arrive at the cemetery to wait for Freddy to finish work. While Trash starts stripping on a gravestone, Tina goes to the warehouse and wanders into the basement, where she encounters the reanimated but horribly disfigured cadaver from the barrel that was assumed to have dissolved. The rest of the group arrives shortly after and saves her in the nick of time, although Suicide is killed. After Casey realizes she saw Freddy entering the mortuary, the group attempts to reach him through the cemetery, where they are attacked by the re-emerging zombies. Trash is killed and Chuck and Casey flee back to the warehouse, but Spider, Tina, and Scuz reach the mortuary. The three discover Frank and Freddy growing ill from their exposure to the gas and call for paramedics, who say their tests indicate the men are no longer alive even though they are conscious. When Burt and Ernie learn of the dead rising from their graves, they barricade the mortuary. Scuz is killed while protecting the barricade and the zombies eat the paramedics and police who arrive on the scene. The group manages to grab the upper half of one of the zombies and restrain her on the mortuary table. She explains that the reanimated corpses can feel themselves rotting, and eating the brains of the living helps relieve the pain.\n\nWith Frank and Freddy showing signs of becoming zombies themselves, Burt has them locked in the chapel, accompanied by Tina when she refuses to abandon Freddy. Freddy soon attempts to eat Tina, prompting Burt, Ernie, and Spider to rescue her by reopening the chapel. Frank manages to escape during the chaos and, still having control over his mind, commits suicide by climbing into the cremator. Burt and Spider flee the mortuary in a police car, but the large number of zombies forces Burt to leave Ernie and Tina behind. Ernie and Tina hide in the mortuary's attic, while a blinded Freddy attempts to break in.\n\nBurt and Spider manage to get back inside the warehouse where they find Casey and Chuck. After incapacitating the basement zombie, whom Spider names \"Tarman,\" Burt attempts to contact the police but learns they are massacred by the zombies after being overrun. Burt then decides to call the number on the military drums, which reaches military officer Colonel Glover. Notified that the zombies have taken over the area, Glover has the town destroyed by nuclear artillery on the morning of [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], effectively killing Burt and the other survivors.\n\nIn the wake of the nuclear strike on Louisville, Colonel Glover is heard telling his commanding officer that everything went as planned and that the results couldn't be more positive. Only a small area was destroyed, he says, and casualties are limited. As he speaks, the toxic rain falls once more, and zombies are heard screaming in their graves, indicating that the invasion is about to begin again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Clu Gulager]] as Burt Wilson<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite magazine|last=Strauss|first=Bob|date=December 1984|title=On-the-Set Report: Return of the Living Dead|url=https://archive.org/stream/fangoria-045-june-1985-friday-13th-new-beginning/Fangoria%20040%20December%201984%20-%20Return%20of%20The%20Living%20Dead#page/33/mode/2up|magazine=Fangoria|location=New York City|publisher=O'Quinn Studios|issue=40|pages=34\u201337; 64|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n* [[James Karen]]<ref name=\"BBFC\" /> as Frank Johnson\n* [[Don Calfa]]<ref name=\"BBFC\" /> as Ernie Kaltenbrunner\n* [[Thom Mathews]]<ref name=\"BBFC\" /><ref name=\"Holden1985NYT\" /> as Freddy Hanscom\n* Beverly Randolph<ref name=\"BBFC\" /> as Tina\n* [[Miguel A.

In early 2002, a fan-led online campaign was started, which attracted the attention of the director and many of the cast and crew. Several of them commented online that the popular and robust efforts of campaign organizer, Michael Allred, were the direct result of not only the DVD release but that MGM created new supplements due to overwhelming fan support.\n \nOn August 27, 2002, MGM released a Special Edition DVD in the U.S. with a new cut of the movie (with music alterations due to copyright issues) with a commentary by O'Bannon and a documentary on the making of the film. The cover of the DVD case for the 2002 release glows in the dark. On September 11, 2007, a [[Special edition|Collector's Edition]] of the film was released with additional extra features involving the cast. The different home video releases have featured different soundtracks, often changing the songs used. Also, the basement zombie's (\"Tar-Man\") voice was altered. Originally, the zombie had a higher, raspier voice that can still be heard in theatrical trailers and releases that contain the original audio.\n\nA 25th anniversary edition was released on September 14, 2010, exclusively for [[Blu-ray Disc]]. The Blu-ray Disc version is a 2-disc combo pack with both a Blu-ray Disc and DVD. This release is very similar to the MGM/Fox print from three years earlier.\n\nOn June 4, 2012, Second Sight Films in the U.K. released DVD and Blu-ray Disc versions of the film where the original audio and soundtrack in its original form can be selected, the first time since 2001 a release has had this option. The release had its first insight into the movie with the inclusion on a booklet (claimed to be based on Ernie's notes from the events of the film) which was edited from Gary Smart and Christian Seller's publication ''The Complete History of The Return of the Living Dead''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondsightfilms.co.uk/cat.php?a=192&p=-1584 |title=The Return of the Living Dead (Steelbook Bluray) :: DVD & Blu-ray Disc Film Catalogue |publisher=Second Sight Films |access-date=2012-09-20}}</ref>\n\n[[Scream Factory]] released a 30th anniversary Collector's Edition Blu-Ray on July 19, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://syfy.com/syfywire/more-brains-return-living-dead-finally-getting-special-edition-it-deserves |title=More brains!
