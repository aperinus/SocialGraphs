[[Delroy Lindo]] appears as an African whom the explorers meet.\n\nThe film was directed by [[Bob Rafelson]] based on the 1982 novel ''[[Burton and Speke (novel)|Burton and Speke]]'' by [[William Harrison (author)|William Harrison]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Bergin]] as [[Richard Francis Burton]]\n* [[Iain Glen]] as [[John Hanning Speke]]\n* [[Richard E.
