Norton]], produced by [[Howard Kazanjian]]. It is the sequel to the 1973 film ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Whereas the first film followed a group of friends during the summer evening before they set off for college, this film shows where they end up a few years later.\n\nMost of the main cast members from the first film returned for the sequel, including [[Candy Clark]], [[Ron Howard]], [[Paul Le Mat]], [[Cindy Williams]], [[Mackenzie Phillips]], [[Charles Martin Smith]], [[Bo Hopkins]], and [[Harrison Ford]]. [[Richard Dreyfuss]] was the only principal cast member from the original film not to appear in the sequel. It was the final live-action theatrical film in which Ron Howard would play a credited, named character.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400-700 words. -->\n\nThe film, set over the course of four consecutive New Year's Eves from 1964 to 1967, depicts scenes from each of these years, intertwined with one another as though events happen simultaneously. The audience is protected from confusion by the use of a distinct cinematic style for each section. For example, the 1966 sequences echo the [[Woodstock (film)|movie of Woodstock]] using split screens and multiple angles of the same event simultaneously on screen, the 1965 sequences (set in [[South Vietnam|Vietnam]]) shot hand-held on grainy  [[16 mm film|super 16 mm film]] designed to resemble war reporters' footage.  The film attempts to memorialize the 1960s with sequences that recreate the sense and style of those days with references to [[Haight-Ashbury#Hippie Hill|Haight-Ashbury]], the [[Peace movement#The Vietnam Era: 1962\u20131975|campus peace movement]], the beginnings of the [[Women's lib#Women.27s Liberation in the USA|modern woman's liberation movement]] and the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|accompanying social revolt]]. One character burns his [[Draft dodger#Draft dodging and the Vietnam War|draft card]], showing a younger audience what so many Americans had done on the television news ten years before the movie's release. Other characters are shown frantically disposing of their marijuana before a traffic stop as a police officer pulls them over, and another scene shows the police overreaction during an [[Anti war#Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam protest]].\n\nThe storylines and fates of the main characters include the following:\n* '''New Year's Eve 1964''': [[American Graffiti#Cast|John Milner]] is a drag-strip racer and falls in love with Eva, an attractive young woman from Iceland who speaks almost no English. Regardless, Milner does his best to communicate with her. He is briefly visited at the dragstrip by Steve, Laurie, Terry and Debbie, with Laurie pregnant and Terry in a military uniform, going to ship out to Vietnam the same night. '''Epilogue''': Milner wins the final competition of the season on New Year's Eve 1964. Later that night, he is shown driving his [[Ford Model B (1932)#In popular culture|trademark yellow deuce coupe]] down a long, hilly road with another vehicle's headlights coming the opposite direction. After disappearing over a small hill, neither Milner's taillights nor the approaching car's headlights are seen again, hinting that this may have been the crash in which Milner was killed. The anniversary of Milner's death is mentioned in both the 1965 and 1966 sequences.\n* '''New Year's Eve 1965''': [[American Graffiti#Cast|Terry \"The Toad\" Fields]] is in Vietnam and wants desperately to get out of the war and the abuse of his superiors, attempting to injure himself to do so. His desperation escalates after [[American Graffiti#Cast|Joe Young]] (the leader of The Pharaohs) is killed by a sniper in Vietnam after promising to make Fields a Pharaoh once they return to civilian life. '''Epilogue''': Fields fakes his own death and deserts for Europe; his superiors believe him to be dead in 1965, as do Debbie in 1966 and Steve and Laurie in 1967.\n* '''New Year's Eve 1966''': Free-spirited [[American Graffiti#Cast|Debbie \"Deb\" Dunham]] has switched from [[whiskey|Old Harper]] whisky to marijuana and has given up her [[Blond#platinum blond|platinum blonde]] persona for one as a [[hippie]]/[[groupie]]. She misses Terry, mentioning that they were planning to get married before he went MIA in Vietnam. She is currently dating another hippie, Lance Harris, and wants to get married, but he isn't interested. At the beginning of the storyline, as they drive around San Francisco, they get pulled over by Bob Falfa, the drag racer from the first movie who has gone on to become a SFPD motorcycle patrolman, and arrests Lance for possession of a marijuana joint. She bails him out, but he still isn't interested at the idea of marriage, and acts distant towards her. She then joins some hippies of the band \"Electric Haze\" on a long, strange trip running over garbage cans, and they end up in a country-and-western bar. '''Epilogue''': Dancing at the country-and-western bar, Debbie sees Lance dancing with another woman, so she hits him in the face and dumps him, causing a bar fight, and later joins the Electric Haze on another trip, as they go to watch the sunset. She ends up getting a full-time job as lead singer of a country-and-western music group.\n* '''New Year's Eve 1967''': [[American Graffiti#Cast|Steve Bolander]] and [[American Graffiti#Cast|Laurie Henderson]] are married with two children, but their relationship is strained by her insistence that she start her own career. Steve forbids it, saying he wants her to be a mom to their young twins.  Way beyond the end of her rope, Laurie leaves Steve and goes to stay with her brother Andy, who with his girlfriend Vicki (played by Cindy Williams' real-life sister, Carol-Ann Williams) is participating in an anti-war protest on a college campus, and is unsympathetic to her concerns. However, as Andy goes to the protest, he forgets his wallet behind and calls her to ask her to retrieve it. However, when she finds out that Andy is going to burn his draft card, she refuses to give it to him, just as the campus is surrounded by the police, and attempts to leave. She criticizes Andy's anti-war protest actions, saying that if the war was ended, Terry would have \"died\" for nothing. As they evade the police on the campus, Steve arrives, they embrace and he agrees to let her work, albeit in a few years, causing another argument between them and they are detained by the police. '''Epilogue:''' As the night falls, with Laurie, Vicki and all the female detainees held in a prison bus, Steve talks to her through the bus window bars, agreeing to let her work if she wants and they reconcile. However, as they attempt to convince the police that they are not demonstrators, a policeman hits the bus window bars with a truncheon, barely missing Laurie's fingers. When Steve tries to intervene, the policeman hits him in the chest, sparking a riot, and Steve and Andy escape, driving the bus off the campus. Steve, Laurie, Andy and Vicki watch the [[Times Square Ball]] drop on a TV in a store window. Steve continues to work as an insurance agent and Laurie becomes the head of a consumer group.\nThe final scene of the movie shows Steve, Laurie, Andy and Vicki in front of the television store, Debbie and the Electric Haze in the band's van and Terry walking alone AWOL, all singing \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\". Also, Milner is seen driving in his deuce coupe, listening to it on the radio, as he drives down the long, hilly road.\n\n[[Wolfman Jack]] briefly reprised his role, but in voice only. The drag racing scenes were filmed at the Fremont Raceway, later Baylands Raceway Park (now the site of automobile dealerships), in [[Fremont, California]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as John Milner\n* [[Cindy Williams]] as Laurie Henderson-Bolander\n* [[Candy Clark]] as Debbie Dunham\n* [[Ron Howard]] as Steve Bolander\n* [[Mackenzie Phillips]] as Carol \"Rainbow\" Morrison\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Terry \"The Toad\" Fields\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as Joe \"Little Joe\" Young\n* [[Anna Bjorn]] as Eva\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as Newt\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Teensa\n* [[Wolfman Jack]] as Himself\n* [[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]] as Major Creech\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Officer Bob Falfa (uncredited)\n* [[Jim Houghton|James Houghton]] as Sinclair\n* [[Manuel Padilla, Jr.]] as Carlos\n* [[Will Seltzer]] as Andy Henderson\n* [[Jon Gries|Jonathan Gries]] as Ron\n* John Lansing as Lance Harris\n* Monica Tenner as \"Moonflower\"\n* Carol-Ann Williams as Vikki Townsend\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as Army Sergeant\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Girl In Commune\n* [[Naomi Judd]] as Girl On Bus\n* Tom Baker as a Police Officer\n* [[Steve Evans (broadcaster)|Steve Evans]] as Racetrack Announcer\n* [[Wayne Coy]] as Safety Safari\n\n==Production==\nAfter the success of the original film, [[George Lucas]], who directed ''American Graffiti'', felt that he should direct a sequel. However, his colleague [[Gary Kurtz]] and the film's producer [[Francis Ford Coppola]] declined to make a sequel since sequels were not as well received. Lucas shelved the sequel to work on ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.\n \nAfter the success of ''Star Wars'', [[Universal City Studios]] president [[Sid Sheinberg]] felt that ''American Graffiti'' could have a sequel. Lucas was initially reluctant to do a sequel,<ref>[https://filmmakermagazine.com/105523-more-american-graffiti-and-spetters-jim-hemphills-weekend-blu-ray-picks/#.YRVpT4ySm70 More American Graffiti and Spetters: Jim Hemphill's Weekend Blu-ray Picks|Filmmaker Magazine]</ref> but after moved by his acquaintance [[Howard Kazanjian]], he agreed to do so. Lucas felt that he should not direct the film due to various circumstances, such as handling his company's financing, developing ''[[Radioland Murders]]'' with [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]], whom he had worked with on the film, and writing the screenplay of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and planning his ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' franchise with fellow director [[Steven Spielberg]]. Finding a director was problematic for Lucas and Kazanjian. Kazanjian's top choice was [[John Landis]], who refused to work on it. Lucas\u2019 professor [[Irvin Kershner]] was also considered, but rejected the offer due to his lack of experience in comedy. Lucas considered [[Robert Zemeckis]], who had finished directing his first feature film ''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]'', but he turned down the offer. [[Bill L. Norton]] was picked by Lucas as being suitable due to his California upbringing and experience with comedy. Lucas and Kazanjian asked him to do a screenplay, which Norton quickly accepted. Lucas was involved in the production by acting as the executive producer, editing both Norton's screenplay and supervising the finished motion picture, and even setting up a camera for sequences set in the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n==Home media==\n\nIt was released on DVD in September 2003 and once more as a double feature with ''American Graffiti'' (1973) in January 2004. It was released on Digital in 2011. It was released on Blu-ray for Europe in May 2012 and for North America in June 2018.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film also featured a 24-track [[soundtrack]] featuring music from the movie along with voice-over tracks of [[Wolfman Jack]].

The album (MCA 8007) was released in 1975, four years before the film sequel of the same name was released. While only one of the songs in this album was actually used in the 1973 motion picture, this collection was compiled and approved by George Lucas for commercial release. In 1976, MCA Records released a third and final Various Artists double album set titled: ''American Graffiti Vol. III'' (MCA 8008). Unlike the first two albums, ''American Graffiti Vol. III'' does not include dialogue with Wolfman Jack.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''More American Graffiti'' opened on August 3, 1979, the same weekend as ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]''.<ref name=\"2021 Guardian Hear Me Out\">{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Matt|title=Hear me out: why ''More American Graffiti'' isn't a bad movie|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/05/hear-me-out-more-american-graffiti-isnt-a-bad-movie|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 6, 2021|access-date=July 8, 2021}}</ref> [[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] puts the gross at $8.1 million,<ref name=numbers/> and [[Box Office Mojo]] at $15 million.<ref name=mojo/> Despite its minor box office success, its gross was nowhere near as high as that of ''American Graffiti'', even though Ron Howard, Cindy Williams and Harrison Ford were bigger stars (due to their major roles in the TV hits ''[[Happy Days]]'' and ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'') in 1979 than they had been in 1973.\n\n===Critical reception=== \nThe film received negative reviews from critics, in contrast to the critical acclaim received by its predecessor. Rotten Tomatoes reported that {{RT data|score}} of critics were positive based on {{RT data|count}} reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/more_american_graffiti|title=More American Graffiti|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date={{RT data|access date|df=iso}}}}{{RT data|edit}}</ref>\n\nJanet Maslin of ''The New York Times'' called it \"grotesquely misconceived, so much so that it nearly eradicates fond memories of the original ... The times \u2014 the story is scattered like buckshot from 1964 to 1967 \u2014 have grown dangerous, but these people haven't awakened at all. They're still the same fun-loving rock-and-rollers, and there's nothing they can't trivialize. So here is a comic look at campus rioting. Here are the beach party aspects of the Vietnam War.\"<ref>Maslin, Janet (August 17, 1979).

C14.</ref> Dale Pollock of ''Variety'' stated in his review that \"''More American Graffiti'' may be one of the most innovative and ambitious films of the last five years, but by no means is it one of the most successful ... without a dramatic glue to hold the disparate story elements together, ''Graffiti'' is too disorganized for its own good, and the cross-cutting between different film styles only accentuates the problem.\"<ref>Pollock, Dale (July 25, 1979).

''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.

For as busy a movie I have seen, it is visually one of the most boring. Norton trades in the grammar of moving pictures for a formula that says the sixties equals fragmentation equals split screen\u2014and split screen we get; baby's first jigsaw puzzles of simultaneous action, until we long for a simple cut from a moving car to a closeup of the driver.\"<ref>Geng, Veronica (August 20, 1979). \"The Current Cinema\". ''[[The New Yorker]]''. 91.</ref> David Ansen of ''Newsweek'' wrote \"This is all very film-school fancy, but what does it mean? Alas, precious little. 'More' in this case is decidedly less.

''[[Newsweek]]''. 63.</ref>\n\nLucas reflected on the experience in 1997 during the production of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'', remarking to [[Frank Oz]]: \"You just never know on these things. I did a ''More American Graffiti''; it made ten cents. Just failed miserably.\"<ref>Shenk, Jon (2001). ''The Beginning: Making Episode I''.</ref>\n\nIn 2021, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Matt Mitchell wrote about the film, by then \"largely forgotten\", for the newspaper's \"Hear Me Out\" series, in which critics argue for more favorable receptions for films often seen as artistic failures. He argued that its commercial failure was all but certain given its box office competition on opening weekend, and that it suffered by association with most sequels at the time being perceived as financially motivated since they were not part of studio's [[business model]]s yet. \"''More American Graffiti'' is an experimental love-letter to teenage omnipotence becoming adult mortality\", centered around Milner's death and the characters in the later storylines processing it. \"There is a beautiful melancholia lurking beneath the comedic surface. It's an empathetic look at the distances in which our sorrows can migrate.\"<ref name=\"2021 Guardian Hear Me Out\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0079576}}\n* {{TCMDb title|22669}}\n* {{AllMovie title|33302}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux_Tin5EU-s George Lucas' Weirdest & Wildest Sequel - video essay by The Royal Ocean Film Society on YouTube]\n\n{{Bill L.
