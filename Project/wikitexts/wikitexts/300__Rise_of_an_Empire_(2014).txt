It grossed over $337 million worldwide from a $110 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nQueen Gorgo of [[Sparta]] tells her men about the [[Battle of Marathon]], in which King [[Darius I|Darius]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] was killed by General [[Themistocles]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] ten years earlier. Darius's son, [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], witnesses his father's death and is told \"only the gods can defeat the Greeks\". Darius's naval commander, [[Artemisia I of Caria|Artemisia]], claims that Darius' last words were a challenge, and sends Xerxes on a journey through the desert. Xerxes reaches a cave and bathes in an otherworldly liquid, emerging as an 8-foot tall \"God-King\". He returns to Persia and declares war on Greece to avenge his father.\n\nAs Xerxes's forces advance towards [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], Themistocles meets with the council and convinces them to provide him with a fleet to engage the Persians at sea. Themistocles travels to Sparta to ask King Leonidas for help, but is informed by Dilios that Leonidas is consulting the Oracle, and Gorgo is reluctant to side with Athens. Themistocles reunites with his old friend Scyllias, who infiltrated the Persian troops and reveals Artemisia was born Greek, but defected to Persia after her family was raped and murdered by Greek [[hoplite]]s. Rescued and adopted by a Persian emissary, she was trained by the best Persian warriors, and eventually gained the attention of King Darius. Themistocles also learns that Leonidas has marched to fight the Persians with only 300 men.\n\nThemistocles leads his fleet of fifty warships and several thousand men, which include Scyllias, Scyllias's son Calisto, and Themistocles' right-hand man Aeskylos to the [[Aegean Sea]], starting the [[Battle of Artemisium]]. They ram their ships into the Persian ships and charge them, slaughtering several soldiers before retreating. The following day, the Greeks feign a retreat and lead a group of Persian ships into a crevice, where they become stuck. The Greeks charge the Persian ships from the cliffs above and kill more Persians. Impressed with Themistocles' skills, Artemisia brings him onto her ship and attempts to lure him to the Persian side as her second-in-command. They fight and make love simultaneously, and he refuses her offer.\n\nThe Persians attack the Greek ships with tar and flame bombs, but an Athenian kills one of the Persians, who falls into the tar carrying a torch, damaging ships from both sides. Themistocles is thrown into the sea by an explosion and nearly drowns before being rescued by Aeskylos, and stands by Scyllias's side as he succumbs to his injuries. Believing Themistocles to be dead, Artemisia and her forces withdraw. After recovering from his injuries, Themistocles learns that only a few hundred of his warriors and six of his ships survived the disastrous attack.\n\nDaxos, an Arcadian general, tells Themistocles that Leonidas and his 300 men were killed after [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] betrayed the Greeks to Xerxes. Themistocles returns to Athens and confronts Ephialtes, who reveals that Xerxes plans to attack and burn Athens to the ground. Ephialtes regrets his betrayal and welcomes death, but is spared so he can warn Xerxes that the Greek forces are gathering at [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. Themistocles visits Gorgo in Sparta to ask for help, but Gorgo is mourning Leonidas's death and angry for what the goal of a united Greece has cost. Before departing, Themistocles returns Leonidas's sword, which had been delivered to him by Ephialtes under Xerxes's orders, and urges Gorgo to avenge Leonidas.\n\nIn Athens, Xerxes's army is laying waste when Ephialtes arrives to deliver Themistocles' message. Upon learning he is alive, Artemisia leaves to ready her navy for battle. Xerxes suggests it is likely a trap, but she reminds him of her role. The remaining Greek ships charge into the Persians ships, beginning the decisive [[Battle of Salamis]]. Themistocles and Artemisia engage in a duel, which ends in a stalemate with both receiving severe injuries.\n\nGorgo arrives at the battle along with ships from numerous Greek city states including [[Delphi]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Arcadia (Crete)|Arcadia]], and Sparta, all uniting against the surrounded Persians. Daxos leads the Arcadian army while Themistocles urges Artemisia to surrender. Xerxes, watching the battle from a cliff, turns his back on her, acknowledging his naval defeat and continuing the march of his army.<!--The first film clearly shows Xerxes's army fighting a year after the events of this film--> Artemisia tries to kill Themistocles but is killed as he stabs her through the stomach. While Dilios leads the Greek assault, Themistocles and Gorgo take a moment to silently acknowledge one another's alliance as the remaining Persians attempt a counter-attack. The three then charge at the Persians with the entire Greek army.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Sullivan Stapleton]] as [[Themistocles]]\n* [[Eva Green]] as [[Artemisia I of Caria|Artemisia]]\n** [[Caitlin Carmichael]] as 8-year-old Artemisia \n** [[Jade Chynoweth]] as 13-year-old Artemisia \n* [[Lena Headey]] as [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]]\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as [[Xerxes I|King Xerxes]]\n* [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]] as Calisto\n* [[Hans Matheson]] as [[Aeschylus]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.300themovie.com/synopsis.html |title=synopsis |publisher=300themovie.com |access-date=August 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805224649/http://www.300themovie.com/synopsis.html |archive-date=August 5, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Callan Mulvey]] as Scyllias\n* [[David Wenham]] as Dilios\n* [[Andrew Tiernan]] as [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]]\n* [[Yigal Naor]] as King [[Darius I]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pro.imdb.com/title/tt1253863/ |title=IMDb Pro : 300: Rise of an Empire Business Details |publisher=Pro.imdb.com |date=July 27, 2007 |access-date=August 15, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Andrew Pleavin]] as Daxos\n* [[Ben Turner (actor)|Ben Turner]] as [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|General Artaphernes]]\n* [[Ashraf Barhom]] as General Bandari\n* Christopher Sciueref as General Kashani\n* [[Peter Mensah]] as Artemisia's trainer / Persian messenger\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] (flashback)<ref name=\"variety1\">{{cite news |author=Scott Foundas |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-300-rise-of-an-empire-1201122602/ |title='300: Rise of an Empire' Review: Eva Green Stars in Entertaining Sequel |work=Variety |date=2014-03-03 |access-date=2014-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210183500/http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-300-rise-of-an-empire-1201122602/ |archive-date=December 10, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n** Additionally, a [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] facsimile is used to represent Leonidas in a separate scene.\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Dienekes|Stelios]] (flashback)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn June 2008, producers [[Gianni Nunnari]], [[Mark Canton]], and Bernie Goldmann revealed that work had begun on a sequel to ''[[300 (film)|300]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Frosty |url=https://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/8326/tcid/1 |title=Producers Mark Canton, Gianni Nunnari and Bernie Goldmann Exclusive Video Interview |work=Collider.com |date=June 25, 2008 |access-date=June 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628132855/http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/8326/tcid/1 |archive-date=June 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Legendary Entertainment|Legendary Pictures]] announced that [[Frank Miller]], who wrote the 1998 comic book limited series on which the film ''300'' was based, was writing a follow-up graphic novel, and [[Zack Snyder]], co-screenwriter and director of ''300'', was interested in directing the adaptation, but instead chose to develop and direct the Superman reboot ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117988284.html |title=New ''300'' rallies troops |author=Diane Garrett |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=June 29, 2008 |access-date=June 30, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703114423/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117988284.html |archive-date=July 3, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/06/xerxes-pic-down-to-noam-murro-and-jaume-collett-serra-for-300-spinoff/ |title='Xerxes' Pic Down To Noam Murro And Jaume Collett-Serra For '300' Spinoff |author=Mike Fleming |journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=June 27, 2011 |access-date=June 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Noam Murro]] directed instead, while Snyder produced and co-wrote.
