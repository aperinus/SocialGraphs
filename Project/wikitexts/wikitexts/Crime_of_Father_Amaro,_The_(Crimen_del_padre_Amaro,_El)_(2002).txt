It is very loosely based on the novel ''[[O Crime do Padre Amaro]]'' (1875) by 19th-century [[Portugal|Portuguese]] writer [[Jos\u00e9 Maria de E\u00e7a de Queir\u00f3s|Jos\u00e9 Maria de E\u00e7a de Queiroz]]. The film starred [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]], [[Ana Claudia Talanc\u00f3n]] and [[Sancho Gracia]]. It premiered on 16 August 2002 in [[Mexico City]].\n\nWhen it was released, ''The Crime of Padre Amaro'' caused a controversy on the part of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] groups in Mexico who tried to stop the film from being screened. They failed, and the film became the biggest box office draw ever in the country, beating previous record holder, ''[[Sexo, pudor y l\u00e1grimas]]'' (1999), with a gross of $16.3 million.<ref name=mojo/>\n\nIn the United States of America, this film also enjoyed commercial success; [[Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment]] paid less than $1 million to acquire the film's [[North American]] distribution rights and released the film theatrically through [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/11/entertainment/et-munoz11 |title=Spanish-language films take aim at U.S. market \u2013 Los Angeles Times |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2006-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504091757/https://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/11/entertainment/et-munoz11 |access-date=2014-02-05|archive-date=4 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/bottom-line-animation-older-audiences |title=Bottom Line: Animation for Older Audiences &#124; Animation World Network |publisher=Awn.com |date=2004-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215225136/https://www.awn.com/animationworld/bottom-line-animation-older-audiences |access-date=2014-02-05|archive-date=15 February 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"U.S.C.O.\">From the United States Copyright Office catalog: {{cite web |url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First |title=Public Catalog \u2013 Copyright Catalog (1978 to present) \u2013 Basic Search [search \u2013 Document Number: V3484D231] |publisher=United States Copyright Office |access-date=2018-09-24}}</ref> the film went on to gross $5.7 million in limited theatrical release in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=elcrimendelpadreamaro.htm|title=The Crime of Padre Amaro}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[75th Academy Awards]], the film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film Oscar]].\n\n==Plot==\nNewly ordained Father Amaro ([[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]]) arrives in Los Reyes, a small town in the fictional state of Aldama, to start his life serving the church. He is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of a ruthless political bishop, while the local priest, Father Benito ([[Sancho Gracia]]), is having a long ongoing affair with a local restaurant owner. Benito is building a large hospital and recuperation center, which is partially funded by a [[drug cartel|cartel]]'s [[drug lord]]. Meanwhile, another priest in the area, Father Natalio, is under investigation for supporting left-wing insurgents in his secluded rural church area.\n\nAmelia ([[Ana Claudia Talanc\u00f3n]]), a local 16-year-old girl, teaches [[catechism]] to the young children in the town, and is the daughter of Benito's mistress. At the start of the story, she is contemplating marriage to Rub\u00e9n ([[Andr\u00e9s Montiel]]), a young journalist beginning his career, but tension is depicted as Rub\u00e9n is a non-believer and Amelia is strongly Catholic. Rub\u00e9n's father is an avowed anti-clerical [[atheism|atheist]] who is unpopular within the town for his strong opinions.\n\nAmaro soon becomes infatuated with Amelia, who is strongly attracted to him and asks awkward questions about love and sin in the confessional, admitting that she masturbates to Jesus. She later touches his hand while serving him at the restaurant. The newspaper is tipped off about Benito [[baptism|baptising]] the drug lord's newborn child, and Rub\u00e9n is asked to write about the scandals in his hometown. With the aid of mountains of evidence compiled by his father, he publishes a story about Benito's hospital being a front for [[money laundering]]. The church has Amaro write a denial and Rub\u00e9n is then sacked by the newspaper under pressure from the Catholic lobby. Amelia then phones Rub\u00e9n and dumps him, berating him with a string of obscenities. Rub\u00e9n's family home is vandalized by devout Catholics and when he returns home, he assaults Amaro when he sees him in the street. Amaro decides not to press charges, and Rub\u00e9n avoids jail time.\n\nThe film delves into the struggle priests have between desire and obedience. Amaro is plagued with guilt about his feelings for Amelia. When the local press begins to reveal the secrets of the parish, Amaro turns to his superior, Benito.\n\nAmaro and Amelia start an affair, and Amaro cites verses from the [[Song of Songs]] as he seduces her. Later he drapes a robe meant for the statue of Virgin Mary over Amelia during a secret meeting. After Amelia becomes [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with Amaro's child, he tries to convince her to leave town to protect him. Later, she decides to try to trick the town by trying to pass off Rub\u00e9n as the father. She tries to reunite with him and organize a wedding at short notice so that the baby can be attributed to him, but he tells her he is no longer interested.\n\nWhen Benito threatens to report Amaro, Amaro threatens to retaliate over Benito's affair. During an ensuing scuffle, Benito is injured by a fall and is subsequently hospitalized. Eventually, Amaro arranges for a backstreet [[abortion]] in the middle of the night. It goes wrong, and Amelia begins to bleed out. Amaro drives her to the hospital in a large city, but she dies before they get there. Amaro weeps.\n\nThe lurid details of the case are suppressed, but Benito and a cynical old woman know what has happened. A false story is passed around the town, blaming Rub\u00e9n for impregnating Amelia before marriage, and praising Amaro for breaking into the abortion clinic and liberating Amelia in a failed attempt to save her and her child. Amaro presides over Amelia's funeral, packed with mourners. Benito, now using a wheelchair, turns and rolls away in disgust.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] \u2013 Padre Amaro\n*[[Ana Claudia Talanc\u00f3n]] \u2013 Amelia\n*[[Sancho Gracia]] \u2013 Padre Benito\n*[[Luisa Huertas]] \u2013 Dionisia\n*[[Andr\u00e9s Montiel]] \u2013 Rub\u00e9n\n*[[Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar]] \u2013 Padre Natalio\n*[[Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz]] \u2013 Bishop\n*[[Gast\u00f3n Melo]] \u2013 Martin\n*[[Ang\u00e9lica Arag\u00f3n]] \u2013 Sanjuanera\n\n==Reception==\n''The Crime of Padre Amaro'' sparked a controversy in Mexico at the time of its release, with Catholic bishops and organizations asking people not to see it and demanding that the government ban it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2002/08/11/06an1esp.php?origen=espectaculos.html |title=La Jornada Virtu@l |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/misc/newsid_2198000/2198500.stm |title=BBC Mundo &#124; MISCEL\u00c1NEA &#124; M\u00e9xico: la pol\u00e9mica del padre Amaro |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-08-16 |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated for over 30 awards, including an [[Academy Awards]] nomination and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2003, winning 19.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] counted 83 reviews with a 61% approval rating.
