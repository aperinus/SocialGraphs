They take him into their home, feed him, and give a place to sleep. But the boy later lets his father, Roy ([[James Caan]]), into the house to commit a robbery. When they are discovered, Roy brutally murders the family, which the boy witnesses. The sole survivor is a baby girl.\n\nTime passes, and Arlis ([[Dennis Quaid]]) lives a solitary life in which he drives a truckload of goods and novelties to restock vending machines and arcade games in roadside stores and restaurants. Making a stop at a roadhouse where a rowdy party is being held, he spots Kay ([[Meg Ryan]]), a woman who pops up out of a cake at the party and then passes out because she's been drinking liquor.\n\nArlis ends up giving her a ride home, a long drive, while continuing to make his rounds. Upon coming home, Kay sees that her husband Reese has sold the furniture, having lost their money gambling. She packs up her remaining belongings and leaves with Arlis. They spend more time together and grow close.\n\nMeanwhile, a young woman named Ginnie ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]) now travels with a much older Roy. She is a grifter who will pretend to be a mourner in order to steal the jewelry from a dead body at a funeral home. Ginnie brings an injured Roy to his estranged son, Arlis, to tend to his injury.\n\nPassing the house where he grew up, Arlis realizes that \nKay was the infant who survived the long-ago murders. Roy figures this out as well. He begins talking about tying up loose ends. It leads to a confrontation, and Arlis shoots Roy dead. Ginnie goes off on her own, and Kay and Arlis go their separate ways.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Arlis Sweeney\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Kay Davies\n* [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] as Roy Sweeney\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Ginnie\n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as Elliott\n* [[Gail Cronauer]] as Emma\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Groom\n\n==Location==\nPrincipal photography began on October 5, 1992 and completed on December 26, 1992.\n\nIt was filmed in [[Lockhart, Texas|Lockhart]] and [[Marfa, Texas]], as well as at the Mustang Mott store owned by Maxine McCoy, in [[Westhoff, Texas]].{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}\n\nProducer [[Mark Rosenberg (producer)|Mark Rosenberg]] died of a heart attack suffered on the film's location in [[Stanton, Texas]].\nAs the [[end credits]] begin, the film is dedicated to him.<ref>DVD credits</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Flesh and Bone'' holds a 65% approval rating from 26 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Flesh and Bone |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flesh_and_bone |access-date=September 25, 2022 |website=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=[[Fandango Media]]}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 57 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Flesh and Bone Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/flesh-and-bone |access-date=September 25, 2022 |website=Metacritic |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |access-date=2022-09-26 |website=CinemaScore |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Amg movie|121824|Flesh and Bone}}\n* {{IMDb title|0106926|Flesh and Bone}}\n* {{AFI film|59527|Flesh and Bone}}\n* {{TCM title|75146|Flesh and Bone}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|flesh_and_bone|title=Flesh and Bone}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1993 drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:Films about con artists]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Steve Kloves]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Thomas Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Steve Kloves]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Southern Gothic films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
