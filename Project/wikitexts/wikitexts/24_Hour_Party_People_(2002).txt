It was written by [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]] and directed by [[Michael Winterbottom]]. The film was entered into the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3124030/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: 24 Hour Party People |access-date=24 October 2009|website=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> to positive reviews.\n\nIt begins with the [[punk rock]] era of the late 1970s and moves through the 1980s into the [[rave]] and [[DJ]] culture and the \"[[Madchester]]\" scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The main character is [[Tony Wilson]] (played by [[Steve Coogan]]), a news reporter for [[Granada Television]] and the head of [[Factory Records]]. The narrative largely follows his career, while also covering the careers of the major Factory artists, especially [[Joy Division]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[A Certain Ratio]], [[The Durutti Column]] and [[Happy Mondays]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Evan|date=2013-12-01|title=History and the Notion of Authenticity in Control and 24 Hour Party People|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13619462.2013.840537|journal=Contemporary British History|volume=27|issue=4|pages=466\u2013489|doi=10.1080/13619462.2013.840537|s2cid=159889143|issn=1361-9462}}</ref>\n\nThe film is a dramatisation based on a combination of real events, rumours, [[urban legend]]s and the imaginings of the scriptwriter, as the film makes clear. In one scene, one-time [[Buzzcocks]] member [[Howard Devoto]] (played by [[Martin Hancock]]) is shown having sex with Wilson's first wife in the toilets of a club; the real Devoto, an extra in the scene, [[fourth wall|turns to the camera and says]], \"I definitely don't remember this happening.\" The [[fourth wall]] is frequently broken, with Wilson (who also acts as the narrator) frequently commenting on events directly to camera as they occur, at one point declaring that he is \"being [[postmodern]], before it's fashionable\". The actors are often intercut with real contemporary concert footage, including the [[Sex Pistols]] gig at the [[Free Trade Hall|Lesser Free Trade Hall]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1976 television presenter [[Tony Wilson]] sees [[the Sex Pistols]] perform at the [[Free Trade Hall|Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall]] for the first time. Inspired, Wilson starts a weekly series of [[punk rock]] shows at a Manchester club, where the newly formed [[Joy Division]] perform, led by the erratic, brooding [[Ian Curtis]].\n\nWilson founds a record label, [[Factory Records]], and signs Joy Division as the first band; the contract is written in Wilson's blood and gives the Factory artists full control over their music. He hires irascible producer [[Martin Hannett]] to record Joy Division, and soon the band and label have a hit record. In 1980, just before Joy Division is to tour the United States, Curtis hangs himself. Joy Division rename themselves [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and record a hit single, \"[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]\".\n\nWilson opens a nightclub, the [[The Ha\u00e7ienda|Ha\u00e7ienda]]; business is slow at first, but eventually the club is packed each night. Wilson signs another hit band, [[Happy Mondays]], led by [[Shaun Ryder]], and the [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]]-fuelled [[rave]] culture is born.\n\nDespite the apparent success, Factory Records is losing money. Every copy of \"Blue Monday\" sold loses five pence, as the intricate packaging by [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]] costs more than the single's sale price. Wilson pays for New Order to record [[Technique (album)|a new album]] in Ibiza, but after two years, they still have not delivered a record. He pays for the Happy Mondays to record their [[Yes Please!|fourth studio album]] in Barbados, but Ryder spends all the money on drugs. When Wilson finally receives the album, he finds that Ryder has refused to record vocals, and all the tracks are instrumentals. At the Ha\u00e7ienda, ecstasy use is curbing alcohol sales and attracting gang violence.\n\nThe Factory partners try to save the business by selling the label to [[London Records]], but when Wilson reveals that the label does not hold contracts with any of its artists, the deal falls through. While smoking [[marijuana]] on the roof of Ha\u00e7ienda after its closing night, Wilson has a vision of God, who assures Wilson he has earned a place in history.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as [[Tony Wilson]]\n* [[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] as Charles (Granada TV producer)\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Lindsay Wilson (Tony's first wife)\n* [[Paddy Considine]] as [[Rob Gretton]] ([[Joy Division]]/[[New Order (band)|New Order]] manager)\n* [[Lennie James]] as [[Alan Erasmus]] (co-founder of Factory)\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Martin Hannett]] (producer)\n* [[Sean Harris]] as [[Ian Curtis]] (Joy Division singer)\n* Mark Windows as [[Johnny Rotten]]\n* [[John Simm]] as [[Bernard Sumner]] (Joy Division/New Order guitarist)\n* [[Ralf Little]] as [[Peter Hook]] (Joy Division/New Order bassist)\n* Tim Horrocks as [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] (Joy Division/New Order drummer)\n* Danny Cunningham as [[Shaun Ryder]] ([[Happy Mondays]] singer)\n* [[Chris Coghill]] as [[Bez (dancer)|Bez]] (Happy Mondays dancer and percussionist)\n* [[Paul Popplewell]] as [[Paul Ryder]] (Happy Mondays bassist, brother of Shaun)\n* [[Ron Cook]] as Derek Ryder (the Ryder brothers' father)\n* [[Kieran O'Brien]] as Nathan (Happy Mondays manager)\n* [[Raymond Waring]] as [[Vini Reilly]] (singer-guitarist of [[The Durutti Column]])\n* [[Dave Gorman]] as [[John the Postman]] (postman/punk singer)\n* [[Peter Kay]] as Don Tonay\n* [[Enzo Cilenti]] as [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]] (Factory graphic designer)\n* [[Rob Brydon]] as Ryan Letts (journalist)\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Mick Middles (author, then-[[Sounds (magazine)|''Sounds'' magazine]] writer)\n* [[Christopher Eccleston]] as [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] (in disguise as a beggar)\n* [[John Stammers]] as [[Marc Riley]] (scene deleted)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Helen Schlesinger]] as Hilary\n* [[Kate Magowan]] as Yvette\n* [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] as [[London Records|Roger Ames]]\n\n'''Cameos'''\n* [[Tony Wilson]] as ''[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' director\n* [[Nigel Pivaro]] as actor at Granada\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as zookeeper\n* [[Howard Devoto]] as cleaner/himself\n* [[Rowetta]] as herself, reprising her time with [[Happy Mondays]]\n* [[Terri Seymour]] as herself, reprising her co-host gig on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''\n* [[Paul Ryder]] as drug dealer and head Hacienda doorman Pel\n* [[Clint Boon]] as Ernie, a train conductor\n* [[Elizabeth Kelly]] as [[Ian Curtis|Ian's]] nan\n* [[Martin Coogan]], Steve's older brother\n* [[Jon DaSilva]] as himself, reprising his time as resident DJ at [[The Ha\u00e7ienda]]\n* [[Mark E.
