It was adapted by [[Stephen Jeffreys]] from his play of the same name, and stars [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Samantha Morton]] as [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]] and [[Elizabeth Barry]], with [[John Malkovich]], [[Rosamund Pike]], [[Rupert Friend]] and [[Kelly Reilly]] in supporting roles. Set in 1675 England, the film chronicles the life of [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], who is asked by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] to write a play celebrating his reign, while simultaneously training [[Elizabeth Barry]] to improve her acting.\n\nThe film was shot on location on the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Wales]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Libertine (2004) Filming & Production |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375920/locations#filming_locations |website=IMDb |access-date=20 December 2021}}</ref> The setting for Rochester's home of [[Adderbury]] house was filmed on location at [[Montacute House]], [[Montacute]], [[Somerset]] and [[Charlecote Park]], [[Warwickshire]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1675, John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester, delivers a prologue of themes of his fondness for drink, his sexual proclivities, and his disdain for his audience.\n\nKing Charles II retracts his banishment of the earl as he has need of him in the House of Lords. Back in London, Rochester finds his \"Merry Gang\" friends, [[George Etherege]] and [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Charles Sackville]], in a bawdy house. Rochester encounters on the street the thief Alcock. Impressed by his dishonesty, Rochester hires him as his [[Valet#Domestic valet|gentleman]]. The Merry Gang introduce to Rochester who will be its newest member, 18-year-old Billy Downs. Rochester warns Downs, \"Young man, you will die of this company.\"\n\nThe Merry Gang attend a play where the actress [[Elizabeth Barry]] is booed off the stage, refusing to participate in a [[curtain call]], and is fired. Rochester is taken with Barry, secures her re-employment with the theatre company, and undertakes to coach her in acting. Barry's acting improves dramatically and she delivers a brilliant performance in her next production. The King approaches Barry to spy on Rochester as to the progress of the intended tribute to the French Ambassador.\n\nCharles, in need of money from France, asks Rochester to write a play in honour of the French Ambassador's visit. The king requests it be a \"monument\" to his reign. Rochester writes ''[[Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery]]'', a scathing satire of the king's reign, which he claims is \"a monument to Charles\" \u2014 just what the king had asked for. The play involves vulgar language, simulated sex acts, and Rochester portraying the king being serviced. At the premiere, the king interrupts the play and on the stage confronts Rochester. Downs is mortally wounded in a sword fight outside the home of a Constable; Rochester backs away from his dying friend, whispering, \"I told you.\"\n\nHiding from the king in the English countryside and sick with symptoms of [[syphilis]], Rochester peddles phoney [[gynaecology|gynaecological]] \"treatments\" for women, including the selling of \"potions\" made from Alcock's [[urine]]. Rochester's face has become disfigured by syphilitic [[gummata]], which he hides beneath a mask. Charles eventually tracks down Rochester, but decides that the worst punishment possible is to simply \"let you be you.\" Rochester returns to his estate and wife, Elizabeth, admitting to having been constantly for five years under the influence of \"the drink.\" Elizabeth declares her love for him.\n\nCharles' choice of heir, his [[Roman Catholic]] brother [[James, Duke of York]], leads to a showdown in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] over the [[Exclusion Bill]] that would deny James the throne. Rochester uses [[Foundation (cosmetics)|make-up]] and a silver nose tip to hide the indications of syphilis as he enters the House of Lords hobbling on two canes. His denunciation in the Lords of the bill ingratiates the appreciation of the king when it is defeated. When Rochester reveals his desire to have wanted Barry as his wife she reveals she never had the desire to be the wife of anyone, she had a daughter by him that he was unaware of, and this daughter is called Elizabeth.\n\nRochester returns to his estate where he is bedridden in the care of Elizabeth, his mother, a priest summoned to \"bring God to him\" as she did not want Rochester to die as an atheist, and Alcock. Before he dies, Rochester asks the priest to recite from [[Book of Isaiah]], chapter 53; he also asks his wife to retell the story of how he had abducted her when she was 18 years old and they fell in love. Rochester's death is followed by a scene of Elizabeth Barry playing the role of his wife in ''[[The Man of Mode]]'', the play about him written by his friend Etheridge.\n\nThe [[epilogue]] is Rochester slipping into the darkness of an increasingly fading candlelight, asking \"Do you like me now?\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]]\n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as [[Elizabeth Barry]]\n* [[Rosamund Pike]] as [[Elizabeth Wilmot, Countess of Rochester]] (n\u00e9e Elizabeth Malet)\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Sir [[George Etherege]]\n* [[Johnny Vegas]] as [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset]]\n* [[Richard Coyle]] as Alcock\n* [[Rupert Friend]] as Billy Downs\n* [[Jack Davenport]] as Harris\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Jane\n* [[Clare Higgins]] as Molly Luscombe\n* [[Francesca Annis]] as Rochester's mother\n* [[Tom Burke (actor)|Tom Burke]] as Vaughan\n* [[Hugh Sachs]] as Ratfcliffe\n}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|The Libertine (album)}}\n\nThe score to the film was composed by [[Michael Nyman]], and released as ''[[The Libertine (album)|The Libertine: Music for the Film by Laurence Dunmore]]'' in November 2005.

No self-respecting libertine lives that long. Johnny Depp finds sadness in the earl's descent, and a desire to be loved even as he makes himself unlovable. What a brave actor Depp is, to take on a role like this. Still, at the screenplay stage, 'The Libertine' might have seemed a safer bet than ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', a movie [which] studio executives reportedly thought was unreleasable.\"\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film has grossed $4,835,065 in North America and $6,016,999 in other territories, for a total of $10,852,064 worldwide.<ref name=bom>{{cite web |title = The Libertine (2005) |url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=libertine.htm |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher = [[IMDb]] |access-date = 20 February 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and honours ===\n''The Libertine'' was nominated in eight categories in the [[British Independent Film Awards]] for 2005, and won in one category, gaining a Best Performance by a Supporting Actor or Actress in a British Independent Film award for Rosamund Pike.
