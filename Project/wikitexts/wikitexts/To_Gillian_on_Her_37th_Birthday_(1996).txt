The original score was composed by [[James Horner]].\n\nThe screenplay was adapted by [[David E. Kelley]] from the [[To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday (play)|play of the same name]] by [[Michael Brady (playwright)|Michael Brady]].\n\n==Plot==\nDavid Lewis ([[Peter Gallagher]]) is so affected by the death of his beautiful wife, Gillian ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), who fell from the mast of their yacht on a sailing trip, that he turns their summer cottage in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]] into a permanent home and spends most of his time on the beach there, communicating with Gillian's spirit and unwittingly neglecting his daughter, Rachel ([[Claire Danes]]).\n\nOn the second anniversary of Gillian's death, David invites her sister, Esther Wheeler ([[Kathy Baker]]), and her husband, Paul ([[Bruce Altman]]), to stay for the weekend. She insists on bringing a friend named Kevin Dollof ([[Wendy Crewson]]) who she hopes David will become romantically interested in. He, however, ignores her in proceeding with a ritualistic celebration of Gillian's birthday.\n\nThe events of the weekend cause the adults to re-examine their relationships; Esther and Paul have to deal with the problem posed to their marriage by Rachel's provocative friend, Cindy (Laurie Fortier), while David comes to realize that he can be a loving and attentive father to Rachel without betraying the memory of Gillian.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as David Lewis\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Gillian Lewis\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Rachel Lewis\n* [[Laurie Fortier]] as Cindy Bayles\n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as Kevin Dollof\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Paul Wheeler\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Esther Wheeler\n* [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] as Joey Bost\n* Rachel Seidman-Lockamy as Megan Weeks\n* [[Seth Green]] as Danny\n\n==Production==\nThe film was filmed on location in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts]], and in and around [[Wilmington, North Carolina]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117924/locations |title=To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday - Filming locations |publisher=imdb.com |access-date=2009-12-17}}</ref> although some of the beach scenes were filmed at [[Long Beach, California]], and the sailing accident was filmed at [[Marina del Rey, California]]; the obvious differences between the two were noticeable enough to be mentioned by ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer [[Janet Maslin]].<ref name=\"maslin\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a rating of 14% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 29 reviews, indicating an overwhelmingly negative critical response.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/to_gillian_on_her_37th_birthday |title=To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday Movie Reviews, Pictures |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=December 1, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726083453/http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/to_gillian_on_her_37th_birthday/ |archive-date=July 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[Emanuel Levy]] in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as \"a bargain-basement ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', a hybrid of an earnest, inspirational play and a sleek, calculated [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] telepic.\"<ref name=\"levy\">{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117911270 |first=Emanuel |last=Levy |author-link=Emanuel Levy |title=To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday Review |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 14, 1996 }}</ref> Janet Maslin, in the ''New York Times'', wrote: \"It's not easy for the story's tear-jerking potential to be realized when its characters express their pain as if they were writing greeting cards.\"<ref name=\"maslin\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/18/movies/gone-but-not-forgotten.html |first=Janet |last=Maslin |author-link=Janet Maslin|title=Movie Review - To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday - Gone but Not Forgotten |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 18, 1996}}</ref> Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that \"for all the moonlight and magic, the film scares up little in the way of enchantment.\"<ref name=\"kempley\">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/togillianonher37thbirthdaykemp.htm |first=Rita |last=Kempley |title='To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday' |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 25, 1996}}</ref>\n\nMany critics found it difficult to accept the basic premise, that the main character's continued mourning of his deceased wife is so detrimental to those around him. [[Roger Ebert]], in particular, expressed frustration: \"The movie cannot see that Esther is a deranged nuisance who should mind her own business, that David is entitled to his grief, that Rachel is happy living on the island, and that if Gillian appears to David, so much the better.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/to-gillian-on-her-37th-birthday-1996 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=To Gillian On Her 37th Birthday |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=October 18, 1996 }}</ref> Jack Matthews of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Despite its apparent parallels to ''Ghost'', ''Gillian'' takes an entirely opposite path.

Issues are muddy. And everyone stays a nice person... In fact, typical of the film's undramatic choices - it's ungenerous unwillingness to commit to the extreme - the husband knows she [Gillian] is an illusion. So he's not crazy. She's not a ghost. And the sister-in-law, far from evil, is merely concerned.

Levy wrote, \"Danes proves again that she's one of the most naturally gifted actresses of her generation.\"<ref name=\"levy\"/> Maslin described her as \"especially expressive in the film's later scenes, demonstrating a rare ability to seem fresh and honest when her material quite clearly is not.\"<ref name=\"maslin\"/> Matthews wrote, \"Danes is terrific playing an awkward teenager trying to understand her father's problems while feeling the first stirrings of passion in herself.\"<ref name=\"mathews\"/> Kempley wrote of Danes, \"the gifted actress steals the show.\"<ref name=\"kempley\"/>\n\n==Accolades==\n[[Claire Danes]] won a [[Young Artist Award]] for Best Performance in a Feature Film - Supporting Young Actress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117924/awards |title=To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday - Awards |publisher=imdb.com |access-date=2009-12-17}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0117924|title=To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|136416|To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday}}\n\n{{Michael Pressman}}\n\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films set in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Pressman]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films shot in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:1996 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Triumph Films films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Horner]]\n[[Category:Films about grieving]]\n[[Category:1996 independent films]]\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:Films about widowhood]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
