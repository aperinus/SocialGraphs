Made to cash in on the [[Lambada]] dance craze by [[Menahem Golan]]'s [[21st Century Film Corporation]], it opened on the same day (March 16, 1990) as a similarly themed film, [[Lambada (1990 American film)|''Lambada'']], produced by Golan's former company [[Cannon Films]] and his cousin, [[Yoram Globus]].<ref name=Variety>{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Scambada: dirty dancing all the way to the bank|last=Gold|first=Richard|page=1|date=March 14, 1990}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nNisa ([[Laura Harring]]) is a native princess of a northern [[Brazil]]ian tribe who comes to [[Los Angeles]] to stop an American corporation from destroying her rainforest home. With her is tribal [[shaman]] Joa ([[Sid Haig]]), who uses [[black magic]] to get past the company guards and see the chairman of the corporation, resulting in his arrest.\n\nLeft to fend for herself in [[Los Angeles]] alone, Nisa, with the help of Carmen ([[Angela Moya]]), finds work in a [[Beverly Hills]] mansion as the servant of an uptight couple whose son, Jason ([[Jeff James (actor)|Jeff James]]), lives only to dance. After spying on Nisa as she dances provocatively in her bedroom, Jason takes her out to a club. She is rejected by Jason's friends, and he is berated by his parents for dating the help.\n\nNisa runs away and gets a job at Xtasy, a sleazy dance joint/brothel, as a dance partner for male customers. Jason's friends visits the club and want to dance with Nisa, but Nisa refuses to dance with them. One of Jason's friends ([[Kenneth Johnson (actor)|Kenny Johnson]]) becomes sleazy towards her and she knees him in the groin. Later, the friends tell Ashley ([[Barbra Brighton]]), Jason's girlfriend, and she runs back and tells Jason his little girlfriend is a sleaze working at Xtasy. He becomes morose, turns away from his buddies and Ashley, and goes to Xtasy to try to take Nisa out of the place. A bouncer beats up the would-be rescuer and prepares to deflower Nisa, but Joa walks in and magically stuns the attacker, which clears the place.\n\nThe shaman then heads back to the tribe, while Nisa and Jason, now in love, prepare for a dance contest, hoping to speak out about the plight of the [[rainforest]] when they are showcased on TV.\n\nThey win the contest, but the corporation's head stooge, Benjamin Maxwell ([[Richard Lynch (actor)|Richard Lynch]]), kidnaps Nisa afterwards. Jason finds them and helps Nisa to escape but twists his ankle, ruining their chances of performing on the show.\n\nLuckily, Joa shows up backstage, heals Jason's wound, and the dance goes ahead as planned. The crowd loves them, Nisa's king father joins on stage, they start a boycott against the destruction of the rainforest, and everyone gets into the Lambada.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Laura Harring]] as Nisa\n*Jeff James as Jason Anderson\n*Angela Moya as Carmen\n*[[Sid Haig]] as Joa\n*[[Shannon Farnon]] as Katherine Anderson\n*[[Linden Chiles]] as Bradley Anderson\n*Pilar Del Rey as Queen\n*Ruben Moreno as King\n*Barbra Brighton as Ashley Wells\n*[[Richard Lynch (actor)|Richard Lynch]] as Benjamin Maxwell\n*[[Miranda Garrison]] as Mickey\n*[[Tom Alexander]] as Kurt\n*Connie Woods as Trish\n*[[Steven Williams]] as Weed\n*Remy O'Neil as Robin\n*Charles Meshack as Eddie\n*Sabrina Mance as Cami\n*[[Kenny Johnson]] as Dave\n*[[Adriana Kaegi]] as herself\n*[[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole]] as himself\n\n==Production==\n''The Forbidden Dance'' was written, produced and released very quickly, in order to cash in on what some thought was a [[Lambada]] [[dance craze]]. The script was commissioned on December 7, 1989 by Sawmill Entertainment and producer [[Richard L. Albert]], after he had seen [[Kaoma]] perform the song \"[[Lambada (Kaoma song)|Lambada]]\" in Los Angeles.  The script was written in about ten days, and filming began within a month. Albert's Sawmill Entertainment hired the same writers and director recently employed in making the suspense film ''Sight Unseen'', starring [[Susan Blakely]].\n\n''The Forbidden Dance'' was shot on 35mm film, in and around Los Angeles, California, and was completed when a color-corrected answer print and other film elements were delivered to Columbia Pictures on March 15, 1990. Editing went on around the clock, with two separate crews of editors working while the film was being shot. Two choreographers were hired, Miranda Garrison and Felix Chavez, and the work apportioned between them. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] visited the set during filming, as news was publicized on how fast a major-studio film could be produced. The film featured the 1989 song \"[[Lambada (Kaoma song)|Lambada]]\" (performed by the group [[Kaoma]]), which became involved in the Lambada dance craze.\n\n''The Forbidden Dance'' was released on March 16, 1990, the same day as rival film ''[[Lambada (1990 American film)|Lambada]]'' &ndash; whose producers brought an action before the MPAA title registry to block the use of the word 'Lambada' in the title. Notwithstanding that attempt, posters went up in New York before the release promoting ''Lambada'' in large type followed by the tag-line 'is the Forbidden Dance', with a picture of Laura Harring and Jeff James dancing in the rain forest.\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe film was panned by critics and received little attention in the theaters.<ref>{{cite news|title=BUSINESS DIARY; Lambada: Royalties at Stake|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/08/business/business-diary.html?scp=9&sq=lambada+forbidden&st=nyt|work=The New York Times|date=July 8, 1990|author=Myerson, Allen R.|access-date=May 11, 2011}}</ref> Opening in 637 theaters, it grossed $720,864. By the end of the theatrical run, it grossed $1,823,154.\n\n''The Forbidden Dance'' received largely negative reviews, and currently holds a 23% on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 2.77/10. The film was also nominated for Worst Picture at the [[1990 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1990/1990st.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815233502/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1990/1990st.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 15, 2007|title=Past Winners Database|date=August 15, 2007}}</ref> Jon Pareles, of ''[[The New York Times]]'', summed up ''The Forbidden Dance'' as 'B-movie drab, with its dance sequences barely sexier than a bowling tournament'.<ref>{{cite news|title=And Now on the Screen: Lambada!|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Jon|last=Pareles|date=March 18, 1990|access-date=January 3, 2011|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE1DD163CF93BA25750C0A966958260}}</ref> while Rita Kempley, in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was to say 'heavy-handed and somewhat mean-spirited, ''The Forbidden Dance'' is a slap-dash message movie, about as subtle as a clog dance'.<ref>{{cite news|title='Lambada' (PG-13) and 'The Forbidden Dance' (PG-13)|work=[[The Washington Post]]|last=Kempley|first=Rita|date=March 17, 1990|access-date=April 8, 2007|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/lambadapg13andtheforbiddendancepg13kempley_a0a000.htm}}</ref>\n\nCritics also considered ''The Forbidden Dance'' to be the worse of the two rival lambada movies, and the film grossed less than ''Lambada'' during its theatrical run. However, years after the release, the film finally found a cult following, especially after continuous re-runs on television and being sampled on the album ''Rainha do Gueto'' by pop singer Jully Luz.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n*\"Chorando Se Foi (Lambada)\" - [[Kaoma]]\n*\"Lambada A La Creole\" - [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts]], featuring [[Dr Buzzard's Original Savannah Band|Cory Daye]]\n*\"Automatic\" - [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts]]\n*\"My Soul Intention (It's a Horror!)\" - [[Kid Creole and The Coconuts]]\n*\"You And Me Alone\" - [[Mendy Lee]]\n*\"Lambada: The Forbidden Dance\" - [[Jos\u00e9 Feliciano]]\n*\"Always You\" - [[Joyce Kennedy (singer)|Joyce Kennedy]]\n*\"Limba Limba Lambada\" - [[Reginaldo Pi]]\n*\"Capoeira\" - [[The Dream Machine (band)|The Dream Machine]]\n*\"BH Disco\" - [[Bob Midoff]]\n*\"Good Girls Like Bad Boys\" - [[Victor Moreno]]\n*\"Hand To Hold You Over\" - [[Mara Getz]]\n*\"Last Lover\" - [[Gene Evaro]]\n*\"Reaction To Passion\" - [[Gene Evaro]]\n*\"It's Never Too Late\" - [[Jeff Harper]]\n*\"Stop, Listen, Look & Think\" - [[Expos\u00e9 (band)|Expos\u00e9]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0099595}}\n* {{amg title|id=18159}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=forbidden_dance_is_lambada|title=The Forbidden Dance}}\n\n{{Greydon Clark|state=expanded}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Forbidden Dance, The}}\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990s dance films]]\n[[Category:1990 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s musical drama films]]\n[[Category:American dance films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American musical drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic musical films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Greydon Clark]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Menahem Golan]]\n[[Category:Films about princesses]]\n[[Category:Films set in country houses]]\n[[Category:Domestic workers in films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
