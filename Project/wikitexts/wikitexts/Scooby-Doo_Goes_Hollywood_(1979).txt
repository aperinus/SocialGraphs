The special was released on [[DVD]] by Warner Bros. on June 4, 2002.\n\n==Plot==\nScooby-Doo and the rest of the Mystery Inc. gang have solved so many mysteries and become so popular that they now have their own television show in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood, California]] based on their adventures. One day, after Scooby and Shaggy fall into a [[catapult]] while running from \"The Crabby Creature of Creepy Crag\", they start getting tired of doing the same routine and decide to become real movie stars. They show the president of a network, C.J., a pilot film called ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)|How Scooby Won the West]]'', where Sheriff Scooby and Deputy Shaggy undergo the ornery Jesse Rotten. C.J. believes the film is a joke, and throws Shaggy and Scooby out, laughing. After the gang finds out Scooby is leaving the show, they are heartbroken and protest while Shaggy tells them how Scooby will become famous. However, they are still unconvinced.\n\nAt a roller-skating rink in town, Shaggy films another pilot (''[[Laverne & Shirley|Lavonne and Scooby]]'') while Lavonne skates with Scooby, turning out to be a disaster with several accidents such as when they accidentally crash into Shaggy while filming. While witnessing the filming, the rest of the gang believes that Scooby is making a fool out of himself and agree that they need to convince him to return to his old show. Not giving up, Shaggy and Scooby show C.J. another film called ''[[Happy Days|Scooby Days]]'' where \"the Scoob\" meets \"the Groove\", an obvious parody of [[Fonzie|the Fonz]], in Harold's Drive-In. C.J. suggests that Scooby go back to his own show. Scooby refuses, later trying to mingle with celebrities, but it results in failure.\n\nBack in the gang's dressing room, Fred reads the newspaper article featuring Scooby\u2019s failures in shock, making all of them miss Scooby and Shaggy terribly and wish for their return to the show. Looking at a theater, Scooby imagines a premiere of his two new movies (''[[Superman (1978 film)|Super Scooby]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Scooby]]''). In ''Super Scooby'', he saves a [[Lois Lane]] clone from a rocket heading toward Big City, only to get blown up himself. In ''The Sound of Scooby'', Scooby wears a pink dress, twirls in the mountain, but as he begins to sing, he falls down a cliff into a stream.\n\nBack at the Chinese theater, Shaggy finds out that the studio is holding dog auditions to replace Scooby's role on his show. He and Scooby go down to see the results of the auditions, and have a laugh upon witnessing the terrible performances. Without them knowing, it is actually a trick set up by C.J. and the rest of the gang to get Scooby back on the show once again. C.J. hires a dog with no talent to take Scooby's role, leaving Scooby and Shaggy in shock. Later, Shaggy shows C.J. a new film, ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour|Scooby and Cherie]]'' where Scooby is a magician and Cherie, his assistant. The next film is ''[[The Love Boat|The Love Ship]]'' where Captain Scooby forgets to untie the rope from the piers, taking all the people on it with the cruise. To confirm his new career, Scooby is featured on ''The [[Johnny Carson|Jackie Carson]] Show'', where he declares that he\u2019s leaving his cartoon series permanently in order to pursue his career as a movie star, upsetting his fans. This also proves to be the last straw for Scooby\u2019s friends and fans.\n\nThe next (and last) pilot film shown is ''[[Charlie's Angels|Scooby's Angels]]'' where the Angels look into criminal headquarters and Scooby lands from an aeroplane without a parachute. Scooby then yells, \"Rop the rameras! Rop the rameras!\" in which C.J. agrees. C.J. tells to Scooby and Shaggy how popular they really are by revealing a massive crowd of Scooby\u2019s fans outside the studio chanting \"Scooby-Doo, we need you!\". Fred, Daphne, and Velma are among them. In fact, all across [[Los Angeles]], Scooby\u2019s fans are begging him to come back. Upon seeing this, Scooby realizes everyone truly loves him for who he is and agrees to go back to his original show. After things have quieted down in C.J.'s office, Shaggy (who doesn't want to go back so easily) knocks on the door, showing him the tape of his own pilots such as \"[[Mork and Mindy|Mork and Shaggy]]\", \"[[Welcome Back, Kotter|Welcome Back, Shaggy!]]\", and \"[[Starsky and Hutch|Shaggy and Hutch]]\". Shaggy (tied up in the film reel) is then thrown out of the studio and he chases the Mystery Machine into the sunset, realizing that he, too, belongs on his old show.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Don Messick]] as [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]\n*[[Casey Kasem]] as [[Shaggy Rogers]]\n*[[Frank Welker]] as [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] and Baby Scooby-Doo\n*[[Heather North|Heather North Kenney]] as [[Daphne Blake]]\n*[[Pat Stevens]] as [[Velma Dinkley]]\n*[[Rip Taylor]] as C.J.\n*[[Stan Jones (actor)|Stan Jones]] as Director, First V.P. and Terrier\n*[[Michael Bell (actor)|Mike Bell]] as Jesse Rotten and V.P.
