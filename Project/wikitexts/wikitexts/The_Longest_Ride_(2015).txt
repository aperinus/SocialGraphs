Based on [[Nicholas Sparks]]' [[The Longest Ride (novel)|2013 novel of the same name]], the film stars [[Britt Robertson]], [[Scott Eastwood]], [[Jack Huston]], [[Oona Chaplin]], and [[Alan Alda]]. The film was released on April 10, 2015 by [[20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nProfessional bull rider Luke Collins ([[Scott Eastwood]]) meets Sophia Danko ([[Britt Robertson]]), an art student at [[Wake Forest University]], after she attends a [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]] event. On the way home from their first date, they spot a car crash in the woods and help rescue an elderly man from the vehicle, along with a box full of letters.\n\nIn the hospital, Sophia visits the 91-year old man she rescued, Ira Levinson ([[Alan Alda]]). He explains the letters are what he wrote as a teenager to his late wife, Ruth, and she offers to read them to him, which tell the story of how they met and fell in love in 1940.\n\nIn flashbacks, Ruth ([[Oona Chaplin]]) tells a young Ira ([[Jack Huston]]) that she wants a big family, and he eventually proposes to her before leaving to fight in World War II. However, Ira is shot during an attack and is later informed that he can no longer have children, news that causes distance between Ruth and him when he returns. Regardless, they decide to make it work and move in together, decorating the house with many paintings that Ruth and he love.\n\nBack in the present day, Ira is moved to a nursing home where Sophia continues to visit. Luke continues bull riding as Sophia and he fall in love. Luke attends an art exhibit with Sophia, which he finds disinteresting, and they realize how different their two worlds are; Luke says he does not feel their relationship will work. Sophia goes to Ira for advice, who tells her how he and Ruth made it work. In flashbacks, it is revealed that Ruth, a school teacher, became attached to a young student named Daniel McDonald after finding out she and Ira wouldn't have children of their own. They wanted to adopt him but Daniel's uncaring relatives wouldn't allow it.\n\nLuke is injured while riding and is rushed to hospital. He is advised not to ride again but he refuses to accept that his career is over. Following an argument, Luke and Sophia break up. In flashbacks, Ira and Ruth break up because she cannot see a life without children in their future. However, weeks later, Ruth returns as she cannot live without Ira. Decades later, now 80 years old, Ira wakes up to find Ruth has died in her sleep. One night, a woman knocks on his door, claiming to be the wife of Daniel McDonald, the child they almost adopted when they were younger, and informs Ira that Daniel, who later became a professor of physics and astronomy, has died. She gives him a portrait of Ruth that Daniel had painted, with a message on the back that reads: \"Ruth Levinson, third grade teacher. She told me I could be anything I wanted to be when I grew up\".\n\nSophia and Luke are contacted by Ira's attorney who tells them that he has died and an auction will be held for his collection of paintings. Meanwhile, Luke wins his last ride, and the event championship, but feels disappointed because Sophia is not there to share it with him. Going to the auction, he buys the first piece of art, Daniel's \"Portrait of Ruth\". Sophia and Luke reconcile with a kiss after he tells her he will not ride anymore because what he really wants is to be with her for the rest of his life. The auctioneer then reveals that Ira's clause in the auction rules was: whoever buys Daniel's portrait will receive the entire collection, worth almost $200 million, as it is the piece of art that meant the most to him.\n\nA year later, Luke and Sophia, now married, have built a museum dedicated to Ira and Ruth and their paintings. Luke takes Sophia to [[Black Mountain College]] where Ira and Ruth used to spend their wedding anniversary. They sit under the same tree and read Ira's letters together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Scott Eastwood]] as Luke Collins\n* [[Britt Robertson]] as Sophia Collins (n\u00e9e Danko)\n* [[Alan Alda]] as Ira Levinson\n* [[Melissa Benoist]] as Marcia\n* [[Jack Huston]] as Young Ira\n* [[Oona Chaplin]] as Young Ruth\n* [[Lolita Davidovich]] as Linda Collins\n* [[Gloria Reuben]] as Adrienne Francis\n* Naomi Eckhaus as Ruth\n* Barry Ratcliffe as the Auctioneer\n* [[Peter Jurasik]] as Howie Sanders\n* Brett Edwards as Jared Middleton\n* Hunter Burke as David Stein\n* Alina Lia as Brooke\n* Rango the bull as Himself<ref name=\"rangodies\">{{cite web|title=Professional Bull Riders - Professional Bull Riders star bull Rango passes away|date=September 16, 2014 |url=https://pbr.com/news/2014/09/professional-bull-riders-star-bull-rango-passes-away/|access-date=14 August 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn April 2014, [[20th Century Fox#Fox 2000 Pictures|Fox 2000 Pictures]] set a film adaptation to be released on April 10, 2015, with [[George Tillman Jr.]] in final talks to direct, [[Craig Bolotin]] adapting the screenplay, and [[Britt Robertson]] as Sophia Danko, [[Oona Chaplin]] as Ruth, [[Scott Eastwood]] as Luke Collins, [[Jack Huston]] as Young Ira, and [[Alan Alda]] as old Ira.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/george-tillman-jr-final-talks-689110 |title=George Tillman Jr. in Final Talks to Direct 'Longest Ride' (Exclusive) |last=Kit |first=Borys |date=March 17, 2014 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=December 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/05/britt-robertson-nicholas-sparks-longest-ride/ |title=Britt Robertson Boards Nicholas Sparks Romance 'The Longest Ride' |last=Yamato |first=Jen |date=May 5, 2014 |website=Deadline Hollywood |access-date=December 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Oona Chaplin To Star In Nicholas Sparks' 'The Longest Ride |url=http://redcarpetendings.com/oona-chaplin-to-star-in-nicholas-sparks-the-longest-ride/ |publisher=redcarpetpretendings.com |access-date=February 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720104912/http://redcarpetendings.com/oona-chaplin-to-star-in-nicholas-sparks-the-longest-ride/ |archive-date=July 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/05/jack-huston-to-star-in-fox-2000s-the-longest-ride/ |title=Jack Huston To Star In Fox 2000\u2032s 'The Longest Ride' |last=Fleming |first=Mike Jr. |date=May 29, 2014 |website=Deadline Hollywood |access-date=December 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/06/alan-alda-joins-the-longest-ride-at-fox-2000/ |title=Alan Alda Joins 'The Longest Ride' At Fox 2000 |last=Fleming |first=Mike Jr. |date=June 5, 2014 |website=Deadline Hollywood |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161618/http://www.deadline.com/2014/06/alan-alda-joins-the-longest-ride-at-fox-2000/ |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=December 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June 16, 2014, in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] and [[Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web | title='The Longest Ride', starring Britt Robertson, begins filming in Wilmington, NC on June 16 | publisher=www.onlocationvacations.com | url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2014/05/29/the-longest-ride-starring-britt-robertson-begins-filming-in-wilmington-nc-on-june-16/ | date=May 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Nicholas Sparks' The Longest Ride Filming In NC | publisher=www.witn.com | url=http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Nicholas-Sparks-The-Longest-Ride-Filming-In-NC-261958541.html | date=June 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Powell|first1=Ben|title='The Longest Ride' begins filming in Wilmington|url=http://www.wect.com/story/25790065/the-longest-ride-begins-filming-in-wilmington|access-date=17 June 2014|publisher=wect.com|date=17 June 2014}}</ref> On July 28, filming started in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina|Jacksonville]], where a major rodeo scene was shot.
