It is the seventh and final installment in the [[Police Academy (franchise)|''Police Academy'' franchise]] to date, and sequel to ''[[Police Academy 6: City Under Siege]]''. The film was directed by [[Alan Metter]] and written by Randolph Davis and Michele S. Chodos. [[George Gaynes]], [[Michael Winslow]], and [[David Graf]] were the only three cast members to appear in all seven films.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Russian mafia]] boss Konstantine Konali ([[Ron Perlman]]) is laundering money under the guise of a legitimate business. A highly addictive video game that allows him to bring down almost any security system controlled by a computer on which the [[Game Boy|game]] has been played, with a string of major robberies as the result.\n\nDesperate to apprehend Konali, Russian Commandant Alexandrei Nikolaivich Rakov ([[Christopher Lee]]) sends for help from America. Rakov decides to bring in someone he met at a police convention, Commandant Eric Lassard ([[George Gaynes]]).\n\nLassard briefs his team about the mission in Russia, then they head to Moscow. Along with Lassard in Moscow are Sergeant Larvell Jones ([[Michael Winslow]]), Sergeant Eugene Tackleberry ([[David Graf]]), Captain Debbie Callahan ([[Leslie Easterbrook]]), Cadet Kyle Connors ([[Charlie Schlatter]]), and Captain Thaddeus Harris ([[G. W. Bailey]]).\n\nAs they plan to capture Konali, he has devised a new scheme: to create an even more addictive version of the game, which can bring down any computer security system in the world, including the systems that protect the databases which belong to world powers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Police Academy characters}}\n\n===Officers on the Mission to Moscow===\n* [[Michael Winslow]] as Sergeant Larvell Jones\n* [[David Graf]] as Sergeant Eugene Tackleberry\n* [[Leslie Easterbrook]] as Captain Debbie Callahan\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Commandant Eric Lassard\n* [[G.

Production was temporarily halted due to the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|October 1993 constitutional crisis]] and the damaged [[White House, Moscow]] is clearly visible in one scene. Despite the conflict, production was allowed to resume with one of the first scenes after the conflict being filmed at Moscow's airport. According to an interview with [[Michael Winslow]], in the ''Underneath the Mission'' featurette, the scene where he performs bike tricks involved him wearing a wireless microphone in order to pick up his comedic sound effects. Unknown to the production crew, the frequency used by the microphone was the same as that used by the military, resulting in officials descending upon the film crew (though the incident ended on friendly terms, says Paul Maslansky).<ref>\"Underneath the Mission\" (2004), a featurette included on the 2004 DVD release of ''Police Academy: Mission to Moscow'', Warner Bros.
