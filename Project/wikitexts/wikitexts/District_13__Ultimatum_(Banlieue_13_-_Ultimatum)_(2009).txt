Directed by Patrick Alessandrin and written and produced by [[Luc Besson]] (who also wrote and produced the first film), the film sees parkour artists [[Cyril Raffaelli]] and [[David Belle]] reprising their original roles of Damien and Le\u00efto.<ref name=\"allocine2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/casting_gen_cfilm=137189.html|title=Banlieue 13 ultimatum: Casting complet|access-date=2008-11-01|website=[[AlloCin\u00e9]]|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThree years after the events of the [[District 13|original film]], the authorities are attempting to return [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] to ravaged District 13. However, their efforts so far have failed to do so. The death of gang overlord Taha Ben Mahmoud has left a [[power vacuum]], and total control of the area is now being fought over by five rival territorial gang lords who want to step into Taha's position. Le\u00efto tries demolishing the walls surrounding the district on a daily basis, but is told to stop by African gang lord Molko, who sees the walls as protection from outside the district.\n\nAfter single-handedly eliminating a major drug dealer, Damien is framed for drug dealing and arrested, but manages to make a brief call to Le\u00efto to come rescue him.\n\nMeanwhile, corrupt government agents from the Department of Internal State Security (DISS), led by Walter Gassman are bent on destroying the five tower blocks at the heart of District 13 with tactical precision bombing, and building luxury flats after the area is cleared. In order to spark conflict with the district's gangs, the DISS shoot two policemen, dump their car in District 13, and prompt several gang members into gunning down the vehicle, making it look like the gang members killed the policemen. The footage of the incident convinces the [[President of France|French President]] to carry out the strike. However, the DISS were witnessed killing the policemen and filmed by a teenager named Samir and his friends. The DISS agents soon come after the teen to arrest him, but Samir manages to give his memory card to Le\u00efto before being arrested.\n\nLe\u00efto gets himself arrested in order to get into the prison. He then escapes the police and rescues Damien. After freeing Damien from his cell, they discuss the events (deducing that Damien was framed by DISS to keep him from finding out their plans during the crisis) and further plans, resolving to gather enough proof to expose the DISS agents. While Damien distracts the guards, Le\u00efto breaks into Gassman's office to steal his hard-drive for the evidence that they need. Once they escape and return to District 13, Damien and Le\u00efto convince the five gang lords Tao, Molko, Little Montana, Karl the skinhead, and Ali-K to band together and prevent the destruction of the district. While the President struggles with the decision to destroy District 13, even with the area evacuated, a large number of gang members storm the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]]. They eventually reach the President and show him the information that they acquired, proving Gassman is a corrupt DISS agent. Gassman then takes the President hostage and tries to force him to approve the mass demolition. Le\u00efto, Damien, and the gang lords succeed in freeing the President and incapacitating Gassman, earning the President's thanks and a promise to fund District 13's restoration.\n\nWith the conflict over and District 13 completely evacuated, the gang lords then decide that it would be better to rebuild District 13 anew rather than try to patch up its remnants. The movie ends with the President authorizing the strike, the District 13 buildings exploding and the president breathing a sigh of relief, stating that he needs a drink.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], a short clip shows the President, the gang lords, Damien and Le\u00efto all joking around and smoking cigars together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Belle]] as Le\u00efto\n* [[Cyril Raffaelli]] as Damien Tomaso\n* [[Philippe Torreton]] as [[President of France|President]]\n* [[Daniel Duval]] as Walter Gassman\n* [[\u00c9lodie Yung]] as Tao, leader of the Asian gang\n* {{ill|MC Jean Gab'1|fr|MC Jean Gab'1}} as Molko, leader of the African gang\n* Fabrice Feltzinger as Little Montana, leader of the Gypsy gang\n* {{ill|James Deano|fr|James Deano}} as Karl, leader of the Skinhead gang\n* [[La Fouine]] as Ali-K, leader of the Arab gang\n* {{ill|Pierre-Marie Mosconi|fr|Pierre-Marie Mosconi}} as Roland\n* {{ill|Sophie Ducasse|fr|Sophie Ducasse}} as Sonya\n* Jean-Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9nogue as Jeff\n* [[Lannick Gautry]] as the cool friend\n* {{ill|Lise Lam\u00e9trie|fr|Lise Lam\u00e9trie}} as the mute secretary\n* Emilien De Falco as Police Officer (uncredited)\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 74% based on 74 reviews, and an average rating of 6.1/10.
