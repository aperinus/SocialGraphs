Devastating his wife and young son Erol, he is eventually presumed dead. Twelve years later, Erol talks with his grandfather, who suggests that the father's disappearance might have been the result of a scientific experiment involving [[time travel]]. Erol is determined to find out the truth.\n\nErol is a mathematical genius and solves the equations necessary to recreate the time travel machine his father had built to go back in time to 1946. As he's working with his grandfather on this machine and the math and physics of it, Erol's girlfriend, Grace, becomes pregnant and makes him doubt the necessity of this endeavor. However, when Grace has a miscarriage, and Erol's mother commits suicide as a result of the loss and confusion of never knowing why her husband never returned, Erol realizes that this timeline that he's living in is a direct result of his father leaving. None of this would have happened naturally had his father come home. This time line is a dead-end and has to be corrected. With renewed vigor, Erol finishes the time machine. He uses the time machine to go back to 1946 and finds his father who is looking for [[Albert Einstein]] as he finished the work Einstein started. Erol reveals his identity and the chain of events which led him here to his father. He then reveals to him that, knowing his Dad's mind, he knew it wouldn't be that simple to convince him to come home. Erol tells him to go back home and give his family the life they deserve and to remember that he, Erol, is what he is because of his father's mistake. Then Erol shoots himself, dying instantly. This burns the message into his father's mind that he has to go back and prevent all of this from happening, which he does.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gillian Anderson]] as Marika<ref name=\"scheck2014\" />\n* [[Haley Joel Osment]] as Erol<ref name=\"scheck2014\" />\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as Gabe\n* [[Victor Garber]] as Sal\n* [[John Paul Ruttan]] as Young Erol\n* Kiara Glasco as Young Gracie\n* [[Susanna Fournier]] as Grace\n\n==Reception==\n{{Rotten Tomatoes prose|33|5.1|9}}<ref>{{cite Rotten Tomatoes|type=m|id=i'll_follow_you_down|title=I'll Follow You Down|access-date=December 11, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n* <ref name=\"johanson2015\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.flickfilosopher.com/2015/03/continuum-aka-ill-follow-you-down-movie-review-the-time-travelers-family.html |title=Continuum (aka I'll Follow You Down) movie review: the time traveler's family |date=2 Mar 2015 |website=FlickFilosopher.com |last=Johanson |first=MaryAnne }}</ref>\n* <ref name=\"scheck2014\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ill-follow-you-down-film-709573 |title='I'll Follow You Down': Film Review |last=Scheck |first=Frank |date=June 5, 2014 |work=[[Hollywood Report.]] |quote=...too undercooked to be sufficiently compelling, even if it offers some intriguing ideas along the way }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|2048770|I'll Follow You Down}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|ill_follow_you_down}}\n* [http://culturecrypt.com/movie-reviews/ill-follow-you-down-2013 I'll Follow You Down \u2013 Summary, Synopsis and Review (by CultureCrypt)]\n\n[[Category:2013 films]]\n[[Category:Canadian thriller films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Techno-thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richie Mehta]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Andrew Lockington]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1946]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2012]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s Canadian films]]\n\n\n{{2010s-Canada-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
