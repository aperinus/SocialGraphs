It received mixed reviews from critics who praised its animation, musical score, and voice acting but criticized its characters and story. It also received backlash for its marketing, noting its contradictions to the book's message. The film grossed $349 million worldwide on a $70 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be 400-700 words in length. This article is currently at 484.-->\n\nTwelve-year-old Ted Wiggins lives in Thneedville, a [[Defensive wall|walled city]] where all vegetation and plant life is artificial. Ted is infatuated with a teenage girl named Audrey and decides to impress her with a \"real tree.\" His grandmother, Norma, tells him about the Once-ler, who knows what happened to the trees. Ted leaves Thneedville and discovers that the outside world is a barren, contaminated wasteland. He finds the Once-ler, who agrees to tell Ted the story of the trees over multiple visits. The next time he leaves town, Ted encounters Thneedville's greedy mayor, Aloysius O'Hare, whose company sells bottled oxygen. Explaining that trees and the free oxygen they produce pose a threat to his business, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town, but Ted continues to visit the Once-ler.\n\nThe Once-ler recounts how, as a young inventor, he arrived in a lush forest of Truffula Trees. Upon chopping down a tree, he was confronted by the Lorax, the self-proclaimed \"guardian of the forest.\" After attempting to force the Once-ler out, the Lorax made him promise not to cut down any more trees. Using the Truffula fibers, the Once-ler created the \"Thneed,\" a knitted garment with multiple uses, which became a major success. He harvested the Truffula tufts in a sustainable manner until his unscrupulous relatives persuaded him to resume cutting down trees to speed up production, leading to large profits, but also [[deforestation]] and [[pollution]]. After the final Truffula tree was [[wiktionary:fell#English|felled]], the Once-ler was ruined and abandoned by his family. With the region uninhabitable, the Lorax sent the native animals away and vanished into the sky, leaving behind only a small pile of rocks with the word \"Unless\" written on it.\n\nThe Once-ler gives Ted the last Truffula seed and tells him to plant it and make others care about trees. Ted returns home to plant the seed, but is spotted by O'Hare's city-wide surveillance system. Enlisting the help of Audrey and his family, Ted flees to the center of town with the seed. O'Hare rallies the citizens against Ted, claiming that trees are dangerous and filthy. Ted uses a [[bulldozer]] to knock down a section of the city wall, revealing the environmental desolation outside. Inspired by Ted's conviction, the crowd turns on O'Hare, whose henchmen banish him, and the seed is finally planted. \n\nAs time passes, the land begins to recover. New trees sprout, animals return, and the Once-ler reunites with the Lorax. The film ends with a quote from [[Dr. Seuss]]: \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as The Lorax, a mystical orange furry creature with a yellow moustache, who protects the truffula forest<ref name=\"FirstLook\">{{cite web|title=First look: Danny DeVito will stump for trees in 3-D 'Lorax'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-10-25-Lorax25_ST_N.htm|author=Breznican, Anthony|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 25, 2010|access-date=October 26, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173755/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-10-25-Lorax25_ST_N.htm|archive-date=November 4, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ed Helms]] as The Once-ler, a reclusive old man and former inventor<ref name=\"FirstLook\" />\n* [[Zac Efron]] as Ted Wiggins, an idealistic 12-year-old boy<ref name=ETOSharletteLorax>{{cite news|author=Sharlette|title=CINEMA WITH SHARLETTE: 'THE LORAX'|url=http://www.etonline.com/sharlette/119649_Cinema_with_Sharlette_The_Lorax/index.html|access-date=June 15, 2013|newspaper=ETonline.com|date=March 5, 2012|quote=In the 3D-CG version of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, we focus on Ted Wiggins, a 12-year-old boy in search of a living tree for the girl he adores.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016030035/http://www.etonline.com/sharlette/119649_Cinema_with_Sharlette_The_Lorax/index.html|archive-date=October 16, 2013}}</ref> He is named after the author of the book, [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel)<ref name=\"Collider20120130\">{{cite news|last=Radish|first=Christina|title=10 Things to Know About DR.
