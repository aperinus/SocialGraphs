The film belongs to the [[Beach Party film|beach party]] genre of movies, popular in the 1960s. This is the third in the series of seven films produced by [[American International Pictures]] (AIP).<ref name=\"gary\">Gary A.

All is well until millionaire Harvey Huntington Honeywagon III ([[Keenan Wynn]]) comes around, convinced that the beachgoers are so senselessly obsessed with sex that their mentality is below that of a [[primate]] \u2013 especially Honeywagon's [[wunderkind]] pet [[Common chimpanzee|chimp]] Clyde ([[Janos Prohaska]]), who can surf, drive, and [[The Watusi|watusi]] better than anyone on the beach. With the teenagers demoralized and discredited, Honeywagon plans to turn Bikini Beach into a [[senior citizens]] [[retirement home]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[wiktionary:foppish|foppish]] British rocker and drag racer Peter Royce Bentley, better known as \"The Potato Bug\" (played by [[Frankie Avalon]] in a [[dual role]]), has taken up residence on Bikini Beach. Annoyed by Frankie's reluctance to start their relationship towards marriage, Dee Dee ([[Annette Funicello]]) becomes receptive to Potato Bug's advances. In a jealous rage, Frankie challenges The Potato Bug to a drag race, in hopes of winning Dee Dee back.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Annette Funicello]] as Dee Dee\n* [[Frankie Avalon]] as Frankie / Potato Bug (Peter Royce Bentley)\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Harvey Huntington Honeywagon III\n* [[Martha Hyer]] as Vivian Clements\n* [[Harvey Lembeck]] as Eric Von Zipper\n* [[Don Rickles]] as Big Drag\n* [[John Ashley (actor)|John Ashley]] as Johnny\n* [[Jody McCrea]] as Deadhead\n* [[Candy Johnson]] as Candy, the '[[Watusi (dance)|Watusi]]' girl\n* Danielle Aubry as Yvonne, the Lady Bug\n* [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] as the voice of Yvonne, the Lady Bug\n* [[Meredith MacRae]]  as Animal\n* [[Delores Wells]] as Sniffles\n* [[Donna Loren]] as Donna\n* [[Janos Prohaska]] as Clyde\n* [[Timothy Carey]] as South Dakota Slim\n* [[Stevie Wonder|Little Stevie Wonder]] as Himself\n* [[The Pyramids (band)|The Pyramids]] as Themselves\n* [[Alberta Nelson]] as Puss/Alberta\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as Art Dealer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production notes==\n\n===Script===\nIn a ''FILMFAXplus'' (April/June 2004) interview, director William Asher revealed that the script was originally written for [[The Beatles]]. According to Asher's claim, the group had agreed to act in the film but later dropped out as their rapidly growing fame (especially after their 1964 appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'') caused their fee to exceed the film's budget.  Asher was forced to rework the script. Frankie Avalon's dual role as an English singer named \"The Potato Bug\" was created to replace the four Beatles in the story.\n\n[[United Artists]] had signed a three-movie deal with the Beatles in late 1963. This casts doubt on the veracity of Asher's claim.\n\nAccording to Avalon, AIP \"did a survey because they wanted to know how much surfing they should put in these pictures after the first and second one. It really wasn't the surfing that was the attraction in those films. It was the fun and the puppy love between Frankie and Annette.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Beach movies were all about pretty girls|edition=Final|author=TIANEN, DAVE|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=Nov 3, 2002|page=2A}}</ref>\n\n===Cast===\n[[Don Rickles]] plays Big Drag, proprietor of The Pit Stop, a teen hangout where several musical numbers are performed. He also manages a garage for dragsters and is the announcer at the Bikini Beach Drag Strip. When Deadhead says he looks familiar, Big Drag admits he was once Jack Fanny, his character from the earlier film, ''[[Muscle Beach Party]]''.\n\nPop singer [[Donna Loren]] appears for the second time.  She was previously in ''[[Muscle Beach Party]]'', and also appeared in ''[[Pajama Party (film)|Pajama Party]]'' and ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]''. She sang at least one solo in each movie.  [[Stevie Wonder|Little Stevie Wonder]], also from ''Muscle Beach Party'' returned for a bit part as well.\n\nUnusual character actor [[Timothy Carey]] appears briefly in this film as \"South Dakota Slim\", and has a larger part as the same character in ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]''. His character is replaced by \"North Dakota Pete\" (played by [[Len Lesser]]) in ''[[How to Stuff a Wild Bikini]]''.\n\nNineteen-year-old Val Warren, who is billed as Teenage Werewolf in the film's closing credits, was the first prize winner in [[Forrest J Ackerman]]'s ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'' magazine's National Horror Makeup Contest (beating out [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]], who would later go on to win three Oscars for makeup artistry).  Included in first prize was a trip to Hollywood and an appearance in ''Bikini Beach''.  Warren stated in a reply to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' report of Ackerman's death, \"When director [[William Asher]] requested that I growl during my brief sequence, my ever-protective agent, 'Uncle' Forry quickly reminded him that said role had now become a 'speaking part' and, as such, I was entitled to a cast credit as well as the [[Screen Actors Guild]] pay standard of an additional 250 bucks. When Asher consented, Forry, like the big kid he was, expressed his delight by turning to face me with a beaming smile and an exaggerated wink.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/12/forrest-j-acker.html|title=Hero Complex}}</ref>\n\nDuring filming [[Hedda Hopper]] reported that Jody McCrea had been annoying girls on set. \"He acts as though they're just there for his pleasure\", said one person connected to the film.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Hopper, Hedda|title=Honors, Film Bids Heaped on Poitier: Star Favors Doing Columbia's Subject, 'To Sir, With Love'|date=May 2, 1964|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the previous film ''[[Muscle Beach Party]]'', end titles revealed that [[Peter Lorre]] would reprise his character in ''Bikini Beach''.  Lorre's death led to [[Boris Karloff]] replacing him.\n\n===Props===\nThe dragsters used in the drag racing scenes (shot at Pomona Raceway) were very popular \u2013 and successful \u2013 at the time. They include: [[Dean Jeffries]]' \"Manta Ray\", Larry Stellings' \"Britannica\", the Greer, Black and Prudhomme fuel dragster \"Freida\" \u2013 driven by [[Don Prudhomme]], 'TV' [[Tommy Ivo]]'s fuel dragster and four-Buick-engined \"Showboat\" dragster \u2013 the one Clyde drives to a new speed record.  Ivo was also a technical advisor for the film, as well as [[go-kart]] champ Von Deming \u2013 billed in the credits with the title, \"West Coast Go-Kart Champion\".\n\nThe surfboards used in this film (as well as the earlier ''Muscle Beach Party'') were by Phil of Downey, California \u2013 aka Phil Sauer, the maker of \"Surfboards of the Stars\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.surfwriter.net/surfguide.htm|title=Surfguide Magazine - the rise and fall}}</ref> Sauer was also the stunt coordinator for another [[beach party film]] that used his surfboards, [[Columbia Pictures]]' ''[[Ride the Wild Surf]]'', which was released the following month. Sauer was even portrayed in that film as a character by Mark LaBuse.\n\n==Music==\nThe original score for this film, like ''[[Muscle Beach Party]]'' before it, was composed by [[Les Baxter]].\n\nGuy Hemric and [[Jerry Styner]] wrote several songs for the film: \n* \"Bikini Beach\" \u2013 performed by the cast; \n* \"Love's a Secret Weapon\" \u2013 sung by [[Donna Loren]]; \n* \"Gimmie Your Love\" \u2013 sung by Avalon; \n* \"This Time It's Love\" \u2013 sung by Funicello; \n* Because You're You\" \u2013 sung by Avalon and Funicello.\n\nHemric and Styner also wrote two songs that featured [[The Pyramids (band)|The Pyramids]] doing back up: \n* \"How About That?\", \u2013 sung as a duet by Avalon\n* \"Happy Feelin\u2019 (Dance and Shout)\" \u2013 sung by [[Stevie Wonder|Little Stevie Wonder]].\n\nThe Pyramids performed two additional songs \u2013 both which were written by [[Gary Usher]] and [[Roger Christian (songwriter)|Roger Christian]] for the film: \n* \"Record Run\"  \n* \"Bikini Drag\" \u2013 Instrumental\n\n[[Candy Johnson]]'s band, [[The Exciters]], perform: \n* \"Gotcha Where I Wantcha\" \u2013 written by Jack Merrill and Red Gilson.\n\n==Cultural references==\n* The Potato Bug name is a not-so-subtle reference to The Beatles. The character is a [[permutation]] of [[John Lennon]], albeit with a persona based on British [[stereotypes]] as perceived by Americans, and made popular by English comics like [[Terry-Thomas]].\n* Keenan Wynn's character's surname, \"Honeywagon\" is a reference to the so-named [[honeywagon (vehicle)#Use in film and television industry|portable toilet]]s used in the film and television industry and at campgrounds and marinas \u2013 thus Frankie's reply upon hearing Honeywagon's name: \"I'd keep that quiet if I were you.\"\n* Timothy Carey's pool-playing character's name \"South Dakota Slim\" is a play on the pool shark character \"[[Minnesota Fats]]\" that [[Jackie Gleason]] played three years previous in the film, ''[[The Hustler]]''. \n* [[Boris Karloff]]'s cameo (seen only from behind until the end) is a riff on [[Vincent Price]]'s commercials for \"the Vincent Price Collection of Fine Art\" being offered at [[Sears]] at the time.<ref>[http://www.searsarchives.com/history/art/ Sears and Fine Art: Vincent Price Collection of Fine Art].
