[[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]], [[Eric Tsang]], [[Edison Chen]], [[Shawn Yue]] and [[Chapman To]] reprise their roles from the original film alongside new cast members [[Carina Lau]], [[Francis Ng]], [[Hu Jun]] and [[Roy Cheung]]. Neither [[Andy Lau]] nor [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]], who played the central roles in the original, appear in this film as they are replaced by their younger versions portrayed by Chen and Yue respectively. The events of the film take place from 1991 to 1997. It was followed by ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'' (2003), which is both a sequel and a semi-prequel to the original film.\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== In 1991 ===\n[[Hong Kong Police Force]] Superintendent Wong Chi-Shing meets his [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] informant, Hon Sam. Meanwhile, Lau Kin-Ming, who is due to become Hon's prospective [[Espionage|spy]] within the Hong Kong Police Force, assassinates Hon's Triad boss, Ngai Kwun, in a mission for Hon's wife, Mary, who wants Hon to rise up the triad ranks. Mary tells Lau to keep her order secret from all, including Hon.\n\nWith Kwun dead, the Big Four triad underbosses intend to stop paying their dues to the Ngai family, but Kwun's successor and son Ngai Wing-Hau manipulates them to continue by blackmailing them on their mutual betrayals. As Lau enlists in the police academy, another police cadet, Chan Wing-Yan, is fired from the academy upon the discovery that he is also a (illegitimate) son of Kwun's, despite his dissociation with the Ngais. The police tell Chan to meet Wong, who enlists Chan as an undercover cop after Chan relays his purpose of being a righteous man. Chan is imprisoned on fake criminal charges to get close to one of Hon's men, Keung, whom Chan helped arrest previously.\n\n=== In 1995 ===\n\nLau has risen as a rookie cop, due to tips on criminal dealings from Hon. Meanwhile, Chan has become a small-time gangster after his and Keung's release from prison. Chan's girlfriend aborts their baby due to his gang association. Hau invites Chan to join the Triad, then tells the Big Four and Hon that he wants to emigrate, leaving them the Hong Kong underworld. Hau sends Hon to Thailand to link up with Thai cocaine smugglers, Hon leaves despite Mary's warning of a trap. Mary meets Wong; it is revealed that Wong ordered her to kill Kwun.\n\nHau's right-hand-man, Law, an undercover cop, tips off the next deal of Hau's. There, the police arrest Hau, but instead of finding drugs, they find a video located by Hau's hired private investigators, showing Mary and Wong's conspiracy to murder Kwun. Simultaneously, Hau's men assassinate the Big Four. Mary admits the truth about Kwun to Hon. Spooked, Hon and Keung kill many Thai mafia. Trapped, Hon makes a desperate overture to Thai mafioso Paul for an alliance. Paul attempts to shoot Hon; the gun misfires. Hau also sends a man to kill Mary, but Lau kills him to save Mary. The police release Hau, who kills Law after discovering Law's [[Covert listening device|wire]]. Chan saves Hau from a [[drive-by shooting]], possibly conducted by Lau.\n\nHau has a [[car bomb]] planted in Wong's car, which kills Wong's superior and friend, Superintendent Luk, while Wong is unharmed. Lau hides Mary in a safehouse. When she rejects his romantic advances and attempts to travel to Thailand for Hon, Lau anonymously betrays her to Hau's men, who kill her at [[Kai Tak Airport]].\n\n=== In 1997 ===\n\nLau is promoted to Inspector; Chan is a full-fledged triad member. Hon has a new wife and child in Thailand. Wong admits guilt of conspiracy to murder to an internal investigation, but the department clears him so that he can take down the increasingly powerful Hau. Wong persuades Hon to return to Hong Kong to testify against Hau, as revenge for Mary. Hau is arrested, ruining his attempt to enter politics. Hon's testimony would threaten a short jail sentence for Hau. Chan later passes Wong decisive evidence against Hau.\n\nTriad member John has the Thai mafia take Hon's Thai wife and child hostage. Hon escapes [[witness protection]] and confronts Hau. Hon reveals that the Thai mafia were allied with him; they kill John. Hon also proves that Paul is holding the rest of the Ngai family hostage in Hawaii. The police arrive as an infuriated Hau prepares to shoot Hon. Hon accepts his death as revenge for Hau to be killed or jailed for life. Wong shoots Hau to save Hon. As Hau dies in Chan's arms, he discovers Chan's wire.\n\nWong laments the failure to imprison Hau. Paul insists on executing the Ngai family to tie up loose ends, despite Hon's reluctance. The murders turn Hon into a top criminal target for Wong. Undercover cop Chan joins Keung in Hon's triad, while Lau, Hon's police spy, handles a case for a young woman, Mary, his future fianc\u00e9e, setting up the events of ''[[Infernal Affairs]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]] as Wong Chi-shing (\u9ec3\u5fd7\u8aa0), a police inspector who aims to take down the Ngai family triad.\n* [[Eric Tsang]] as Hon Sam (\u97d3\u741b), a member of Ngai's triad.\n* [[Carina Lau]] as Mary, Hon Sam's wife.\n* [[Francis Ng]] as Ngai Wing-hau (\u502a\u6c38\u5b5d), the boss of the Ngai family triad after his father's assassination.\n* [[Edison Chen]] as Lau Kin-ming (\u5289\u5065\u660e), Hon Sam's mole in the police force.\n*[[Shawn Yue]] as Chan Wing-yan (\u9673\u6c38\u4ec1), Ngai Wing-hau's half-brother and an undercover cop.\n* [[Hu Jun]] as Luk Kai-cheung (\u9678\u555f\u660c), a police superintendent who is Wong's close friend and partner.\n* [[Chapman To]] as \"Silly\" Keung (\u50bb\u5f37), Chan's friend and fellow triad member.\n* [[Roy Cheung]] as Law Kai-yin (\u7f85\u7e7c\u8ce2), an undercover cop in the triad.\n* [[Liu Kai-chi]] as Uncle John (\u4e09\u53d4), a prominent triad member.\n*[[Joe Cheung]] as Ngai Kwun (\u502a\u5764), the boss of the Ngai family triad and Ngai Wing-hau's father who was assassinated by Lau.\n* Henry Fong as Gandhi (\u7518\u5730), one of the Big Four.\n* Peter Ngor as Negro (\u9ed1\u9b3c), one of the Big Four.\n* [[Arthur Wong]] as Kwok-wah (\u570b\u83ef), one of the Big Four.\n* [[Teddy Chan]] as Man-ching (\u6587\u62ef), one of the Big Four.\n* Chiu Chung-yu as Mary, the girl Lau meets in the police station at the end of the film.\n* Phorjeat Keanpetch as Sunny, the Thai drug lord who tried to kill Hon Sam.\n* [[Ye Shipin]] as a socialite at the handover party\n* [[Tay Ping Hui]] as Hung, lawyer for the Ngais\n* Hui Kam-fung as the principal of the police cadet school\n* Alexander Chan as Ngai Wing-yee (\u502a\u6c38\u7fa9), Ngai Wing-hau's elder brother.\n* [[Andrew Lin]] as Ngai Wing-chung (\u502a\u6c38\u5fe0), Ngai Wing-hau's younger brother.\n* [[Kara Hui]] as Ngai Wing-tsz (\u502a\u6c38\u6148), Ngai Wing-hau's elder sister\n* [[Wan Chi Keung|Wan Chi-keung]] as Superintendent Leung (\u6881Sir), Wong's superior.\n* Chan Charoenwichai as Paul, the Thai drug dealer who became friends with Hon Sam.\n* [[Kelly Fu]] as May, Chan's girlfriend\n\n==Music==\nThe film's score was composed by [[Chan Kwong-wing]].
