For their performances, Vikander won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and Redmayne was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], while the film received additional [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]]. It also received five [[British Academy Film Award|BAFTA Award]] nominations, including [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]] at the [[69th British Academy Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn mid-1920s Copenhagen, portrait artist Gerda Wegener asks her husband, a popular landscape artist and closeted [[trans woman]] (then going by Einar Wegener), to stand in for a female model, who is late arriving at their flat to pose for a painting on which Gerda is working.\n\nThe act of posing as a female figure unmasks Einar's life-long [[gender identity]] as a woman, who then names herself [[Lili Elbe]]. This sets off a progression, first tentative and then irreversible, of leaving behind the male identity which she has struggled to maintain all her life. This takes place as both Lili and Gerda relocate to Paris; Gerda's portraits of Lili in her feminine state attract serious attention from art dealers in a way that her previous portraiture had not. It is there that Gerda tracks down art dealer Hans Axgil, a childhood friend of Lili (whom Lili had kissed when they were young). Hans and Gerda's mutual attraction is a challenge, as Gerda is navigating her changing relationship with Lili; but Hans' long-time friendship with and affection for Lili cause him to be supportive of both Lili and Gerda.\n\nAs Lili's continued existence presenting as a male becomes too much to bear, she starts to seek help from psychologists, but none yields any result, and, in one instance, almost leads her to being committed to an asylum. Eventually, at Ulla's recommendation, Lili and Gerda meet Dr. [[Kurt Warnekros]]. Dr. Warnekros explains that he has met people like her, who are physically male but identify as female. He proposes a new, innovative and controversial solution: male-to-female [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex reassignment surgery]]. He also mentions that this is the second time he's offered this surgery, but the first patient got too nervous and left before the surgeries began. This would entail a two-part procedure that involves first removing Lili's external genitalia and then, after a period of recovery, fashioning a vagina. He warns Lili and Gerda that it is a very dangerous operation that has never been attempted before, and Lili would be one of the first to undergo it. Lili immediately agrees and, soon after, travels to Germany without Gerda to begin the surgery.\n\nGerda stays behind for a little while, but ultimately decides she should be by Lili's side. She arrives to Lili having completed the first surgery, but very much in pain with a serious infection and negative prognosis. Gerda helps Lili heal and Lili begins working in a department store selling woman's perfume. She befriends a man who was originally interested in her as Einar and she emphasizes that Gerda's relationship with Einar is over because Einar is gone. She stays a while, but decides it's time to go back for the second surgery, much to Gerda's distress. Lili again leaves alone.\n\nGerda again shows up after the surgery is complete, but Lili is pale and weak. She feels complete and insists she be taken out to the garden again. Lili dies of complications from the second surgery while talking with Gerda. Gerda and Hans travel to a hilltop back in Denmark where Hans and Lili grew up, in front of the five trees Lili often painted. The scarf that Lili had originally given Gerda, and that had subsequently been given back and forth several times, is carried away on the wind, dancing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Eddie Redmayne]] as [[Lili Elbe|Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe (Lili Elvenes)]] \n* [[Alicia Vikander]] as [[Gerda Wegener|Gerda Wegener (n\u00e9e Gottlieb)]]\n* [[Matthias Schoenaerts]] as Hans Axgil (Fernando Porta)\n* [[Ben Whishaw]] as Henrik Sandahl (Claude Lejeune)\n* [[Amber Heard]] as [[Ulla Poulsen|Ulla Paulson]]\n* [[Sebastian Koch]] as [[Kurt Warnekros|Dr. Kurt Warnekros]]\n* [[Pip Torrens]] as Dr. Jens Hexler\n* [[Nicholas Woodeson]] as Dr. Buson\n* [[Emerald Fennell]] as Elsa\n* [[Adrian Schiller]] as Rasmussen\n* Henry Pettigrew as Niels\n* Pixie as Hvappe, the [[Jack Russell Terrier|Jack Russell]] dog<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810819/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|website=[[IMDb]]|access-date=27 August 2018|title=The Danish Girl: Full Cast & Crew}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/danish-girl-alicia-vikander-transgender-extremely-fluid/|website=[[TheWrap]]|date=27 November 2015|access-date=27 August 2018|title=Danish Girl Star Alicia Vikander on how gender is extremely fluid}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nScreenwriter [[Lucinda Coxon]] worked on the screenplay for a decade before it was produced.
