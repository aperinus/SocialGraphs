''An Ideal Culprit'') is a [[France|French]]-[[United States|American]] [[documentary film]] directed by [[Jean-Xavier de Lestrade]]. Its subject is the [[Brenton Butler case]], a criminal case in which a fifteen-year-old [[African-American]] boy was wrongfully accused of [[murder]]. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]] in 2002.<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/262276/Murder-on-a-Sunday-Morning/details |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530232358/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/262276/Murder-on-a-Sunday-Morning/details |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-05-30 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]] |date=2008 |title=Murder on a Sunday Morning |accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]], on the morning of Sunday, May 7, 2000, a tourist was murdered outside of a [[Ramada Inn]] by an unknown African-American young man. A couple of hours later, fifteen-year-old Brenton Butler was stopped and questioned by police as he was walking past the crime scene, which was not far from his house. Although Butler was shorter and younger than the description of the shooter that was initially provided by the husband of the victim, who had been standing next to his wife when she was shot, the husband [[eyewitness identification|identified]] Butler as the killer, and Butler was arrested, interrogated for twelve hours without the presence of his parents or a lawyer, and signed a [[Confession (law)|confession]]. After this, the police seem to have stopped investigating, and Butler was charged and tried for murder without any [[physical evidence]] against him; the prosecution's case was based solely on the positive eyewitness identification and the confession, which Butler later testified he had signed due to physical [[Coercion#Physical|coercion]] by police.\n\n==Summary==\nThe film follows Butler's defense team as they build their case and present it in court. In the end, the [[jury]] only deliberates for 45 minutes before finding Butler not guilty.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter Butler was [[acquitted]], the police and the prosecutors were heavily criticized by a grand jury that investigated the case and the behavior of the police.\n\nEventually, the [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] sheriff was put in charge of the murder case and ordered it reopened. In 2004, someone else was convicted of the murder.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Patterson |first1=Steve |title=Patrick McGuinness, Jacksonville defense lawyer known from Oscar-winning film, dies at 70|url=https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/local/2021/03/23/patrick-mcguinness-1950-2021-defense-lawyer-represented-best/6954747002/ |access-date=29 March 2021 |work=The Florida Times-Union}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0307197|title=Murder on a Sunday Morning}}\n\n{{AcademyAwardBestDocumentaryFeature2001-2020}}\n\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2001 documentary films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Best Documentary Feature Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about law]]\n[[Category:French documentary films]]\n[[Category:History of Jacksonville, Florida]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Jacksonville, Florida]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about Florida]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]\n\n\n{{hist-documentary-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
