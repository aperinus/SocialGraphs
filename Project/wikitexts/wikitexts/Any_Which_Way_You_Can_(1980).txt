Philo, who still lives with his mother, his brother Orville and orangutan Clyde, decides to retire when he realizes that he has started to enjoy the pain. One evening, Philo encounters his ex-girlfriend, country-western singer Lynn Halsey-Taylor, singing at his favorite bar. Orville angrily reproves Lynn for her actions two years before. Lynn apologizes to Philo. Philo, initially gruff and reluctant, forgives her. They become a couple again and move in together.\n \nThe Black Widows, the [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]] with a long-running grudge against Philo, return. They still want revenge for the destruction of their bikes. However, Philo bests them in a chase that runs through an asphalt machine during a road-paving project.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack Wilson, a new breed of fighter from the East Coast who [[Mixed martial arts|mixes martial arts with boxing]], dominates the bare-knuckle circuit. He is so effective at maiming his opponents that his handlers cannot book fights for him. After a fight between a mongoose and a rattlesnake, one of the handlers realizes that if Philo, king of the West Coast brawlers, agreed to fight Wilson, it would be the biggest draw in the history of bare-knuckle boxing. Philo initially agrees to the fight but after much prodding from Orville and Lynn, withdraws. The handlers, led by handicapper Jimmy Beekman and backed by the [[American Mafia|Mafia]], kidnap Lynn to coerce Philo to show up for the fight. The fight is to take place near [[Jackson, Wyoming]]. The Black Widows follow Philo there.\n\nWilson, however, is a prize fighter with morals. After he learns of the plot and helps Philo and Orville rescue Lynn, he and Philo mutually decide to call off the fight. However, both fighters' personal pride makes them wonder who would have won. The brawl between the duo takes place after all, but it is punctuated by pauses and personal reflections on their mutual admiration for each other. Meanwhile, the Black Widows bet everything they have on Philo; despite their rivalry, they know that ''he'' is the better fighter. When the mobsters try to kill Philo once he gains the upper hand, the Black Widows protect their investment by beating up the Mafia men. Wilson eventually breaks Philo's arm and offers to end the fight, but the two men continue the brawl. After a long fight, Philo knocks Wilson out long enough to qualify for a win. Wilson helps Philo to the hospital, then later on they have a drink at the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar. On their way home, Philo and the Black Widows (who are now rich) declare a truce and part amicably. Beekman, whose attempts to rig the fight for Wilson failed, cannot pay the mob bettors and is marked for death. After reaching California, Philo and Lynn are pulled over by a cop who lost money betting against Philo earlier; he promises to endlessly harass them as punishment. Lynn calls out, \"Right turn, Clyde!\" Clyde promptly knocks out the cop and they drive away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Philo Beddoe\n* [[Sondra Locke]] as Lynn Halsey-Taylor\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Orville Boggs\n* [[Ruth Gordon]] as Zenobia 'Ma' Boggs\n* [[William Smith (actor)|William Smith]] as Jack Wilson\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as Zack Tupper\n* [[Harry Guardino]] as James Beekman\n* [[Michael Cavanaugh (actor)|Michael Cavanaugh]] as Patrick Scarfe\n* [[James Gammon]] as the bartender \n* [[John Quade]] as Cholla\n* [[Al Ruscio]] as Tony Paoli Sr.\n* [[Jack Murdock (actor)|Jack Murdock]] as Little Melvin\n* [[George Murdock (actor)|George Murdock]] as Sergeant Cooley\n* [[Dick Durock]] as Joe Casey\n* [[Julie Brown]] as Candy\n* [[Dan Vadis]] as Frank\n* [[Camila Ashland|Camila Ashlend]] as Hattie\n* [[Anne Ramsey]] as Loretta Quince\n* [[Logan Ramsey]] as Luther Quince\n* [[Jim Stafford]] as Long John\n* [[Michael Talbott]] as Officer Morgan\n* [[Mark L.
