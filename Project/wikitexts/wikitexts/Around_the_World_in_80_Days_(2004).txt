It stars [[Jackie Chan]], [[Steve Coogan]] and [[C\u00e9cile de France]]. The film is set in the nineteenth century and centers on [[Phileas Fogg]] (Coogan), here reimagined as an [[absent-minded professor|eccentric inventor]], and his efforts to circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. During the trip, he is accompanied by his Chinese valet, [[Jean Passepartout|Passepartout]] (Chan). For comedic reasons, the film intentionally deviated wildly from the novel and included a number of [[anachronism|anachronistic]] elements. With production costs of about $110 million and estimated marketing costs of $30 million, it earned $24 million at the U.S. box office and $48 million worldwide, making it a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:BerlinTournage80jours2.jpg|thumb|Film set at Berlin's [[Gendarmenmarkt]] in April 2003. The building doubles as a background building outside London's Royal Academy of Science.]]\nLau Xing robs the [[Bank of England]] and hides in Phileas Fogg's house, giving his name as \"Passport...too\". Fogg hears \"Passepartout\" and hires him as valet. Passepartout helps Fogg break the {{convert|50|mph|km/h|adj=on}} speed barrier. At the [[Royal Society|Royal Academy of Science]], Fogg is insulted by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Baron Kelvin]]. Fogg bets that he can travel around the world in 80 days. If he wins, he will replace Kelvin as Minister of Science. If not, he will be ruined. Fogg and Passepartout take a carriage out of [[London]] after a confrontation with corrupt Inspector Fix, hired by Kelvin.\n\nPassepartout and Fogg journey to [[Paris]], where Passepartout must evade General Fang's warriors. Fang wants the [[jade]] [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] previously given to Lord Kelvin but stolen by Passepartout. Pretending to take Fogg to see [[Thomas Edison]], Passepartout leads him to impressionist painting student Monique La Roche. Passepartout fights the warriors while his boss discusses impressionism. The two men and Monique depart in a [[hot-air balloon]], chased by Fang's warriors.\n\nThe trio continue their journey by train. However, in [[Istanbul]], they are forced to become guests of Prince Hapi's banquet. Whilst initially hospitable, he soon orders the men to leave while Monique must become his seventh wife. The men convince Hapi to release Monique or they will damage his personal statue of \"[[The Thinker]]\", which is accidentally smashed. With Hapi in pursuit, the three travelers then escape.\n\nKelvin learns about the bank robbery. He orders the British-colonial authorities in [[British Raj|India]] to arrest both men. Passepartout sees notice of the price on his head and warns his companions. Disguised as women they are attacked by Fang's warriors. Using Inspector Fix and a [[sextant]] as weapons, Fogg and Passepartout defeat their assailants and flee to China.\n\nIn a Chinese village where Lau Xing had came from, Lanzhou, they are welcomed by Lau's family members. However, they are captured by the Black Scorpions. Recognized, Lau Xing challenges the leader of the group to a fight. At first, he fights alone and is defeated; moments later, he is joined by his fellow \"[[Ten Tigers of Canton]]\" to defeat the Black Scorpions. The jade Buddha is returned to the village temple.\n\nFogg desires to continue alone, disappointed and feeling used by his companions after finding out that through a picture of Lau and his family members in the village. He travels to [[San Francisco]] and is tricked out of his money. He is found destitute by Lau Xing and Monique who have followed him. In the Western desert, they find the [[Wright brothers]] who discuss their prototype flying machine. Fogg suggests a few changes, which are eagerly taken.\n\nIn [[New York City]], a jubilant crowd prevents them from their ship. A policeman leads them to an ambush in a workshop. The three friends fight Fang and her warriors and win. Though Fogg could have gotten to the boat, he misses it to help Lau Xing. Fogg feels that he has lost, but the other two say that they may still make it if they catch the next ship.\n\nThey board an old ship and Fogg builds a plane out of the ship's old wood, promising a new ship to the captain. The ship's crew builds a catapult to launch it. The three fly to London and crash-land at the Royal Academy. Kelvin sends police to hinder them, and the clock strikes noon, ending the wager.\n\nKelvin proclaims himself the victor. Monique, Fix and other ministers attest to Kelvin's unfair methods. Kelvin insults [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] who overhears the insult which leads to Kelvin\u2019s arrest. She then reveals that she has bet money on Fogg winning and congratulates him for making it back a day early. Though Lau and Monique are confused, Fogg eventually realizes that they forgot to take the [[International Date Line]] into account: they themselves experienced 80 days, but London only experienced 79 days. He ascends the stairs of the Academy and kisses Monique, victorious in his bet.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as [[Jean Passepartout|Passepartout]] / Lau Xing / Tiger #10 \n* [[Steve Coogan]] as [[Phileas Fogg]]\n* [[C\u00e9cile de France]] as Monique Laroche\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]]\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Inspector Fix\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as [[Queen Victoria]]\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Prince Hapi\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as [[Herbert Kitchener|Colonel Kitchener]]\n* [[Karen Mok]] (credited as Karen Joy Morris) as General Fang\n* [[Roger Hammond (actor)|Roger Hammond]] as [[Cecil Rhodes|Lord Rhodes]]\n* [[David Ryall]] as [[Lord Salisbury]]\n* [[Mark Addy]] as Steamer Captain\n* [[Richard Branson]] as Balloon Man\n* [[John Cleese]] as Grizzled sergeant\n* [[Will Forte]] as Young French Policeman Bobby\n* [[Macy Gray]] as Sleeping French Woman\n* [[Sammo Hung]] as [[Wong Fei Hung]] / Tiger #2\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as San Francisco [[Hobo]]\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as [[Wright brothers|Orville Wright]]\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as [[Wright brothers|Wilbur Wright]]\n* [[Daniel Wu]] as [[Bak Mei]]\n* [[Robert Fyfe]] as Jean Michel\n* [[Adam Godley]] as Mr. Sutton\n* [[Maggie Q|Maggie M.
