Feature Animation]] and directed by [[Frederik Du Chau]] and very loosely based on the 1976 novel ''[[The King's Damosel]]'' by [[Vera Chapman]]. It features the voices of [[Jessalyn Gilsig]], [[Cary Elwes]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Jaleel White]], [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Frank Welker]] and Sarah Rayne. [[Andrea Corr]], [[Bryan White]], [[Celine Dion]] and [[Steve Perry]] perform the singing voices for Gilsig, Elwes, Seymour and Brosnan.\n\nIn May 1995, the film, initially titled ''The Quest for the Holy Grail'', was announced to be [[Warner Bros. Feature Animation]]'s first project, with [[Bill Kroyer]] as director. The film went into production later that year, but was delayed when animators were reassigned to help finish ''[[Space Jam]]'' (1996). During the interim, the story was heavily re-tooled, among of which the central focus on the [[Holy Grail]] would be replaced with [[Excalibur]]. This resulted in creative differences, in which Kroyer was replaced with Du Chau. This was later followed with prominent departures of the animation and management staff. Because of the production troubles, the film's release was delayed by six months, from November 1997 to May 1998. Animation was mostly done in [[Glendale, California]] and [[London]], [[England]].<ref name=\"BoxofficeGrail\">{{cite news |last=Mallory |first=Michael |title=Warner Bros. searches for boxoffice grail |url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/warner-bros-searches-for-boxoffice-grail-111662043/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 17, 1997 |access-date=September 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview |last=Kenyon |first=Heather |url=https://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.1/3.1pages/3.1kenyonhoward.html |title=An Afternoon with Max Howard, President, Warner Bros.

Ruber is then driven off by [[Excalibur]], Arthur's sword. At Lionel's funeral, Arthur tells Lionel's daughter Kayley and his wife Juliana that they will always be welcome at [[Camelot]]. Kayley dreams of becoming a [[Knight]], like her father, and trains herself while working on their farm. \n\nA decade later, Ruber's [[griffin]] attacks Camelot, where he steals Excalibur and injures King Arthur. [[Merlin]]'s pet falcon, Ayden, attacks the griffin, causing it to drop the sword into the Forbidden Forest. The Griffin is driven away by the forest's sentient trees. When Kayley hears news of this she plans to search for Excalibur herself, which displeases her mother. Ruber turns his henchmen into steel men and a henpecked [[rooster]] into Bladebeak using a [[witch]]'s potion to aid him. He attacks the farm and captures Kayley, planning to use her to gain entry to Camelot. After hearing Ruber's plans, Kayley escapes and heads to the forest, pursued by the griffin, steel men and Bladebeak. Garrett, a [[Visual impairment|blind]] [[hermit]], and Ayden, save her. They decide to search for Excalibur, and Kayley persuades him to let her join the quest. \n\nThey meet a wisecracking two-headed [[dragon]] named Devon and Cornwall, whose two heads can't stand each other and dream of being separated, and can neither fly or breathe fire. They fight off another attack from Ruber and his henchmen, and Devon and Cornwell join their quest. Garrett reveals he was once King Arthur's stable boy, who wanted to be a knight. He was kicked in the head while saving the King's horses from a fire, causing his blindness. \n\nThe next day, they find the belt and scabbard of Excalibur in a giant footprint. Kayley's insistence of distracting Garrett causes him to miss Ayden's signal, and he is injured by one of Ruber's men. Kayley uses the sentient trees to trap Ruber and his men, and escorts Garrett into a remote cave where the magic of the forest heals Garrett's wounds. Whilst in the cave, Kayley and Garrett profess their love for each other. The next day, the group goes into a giant cave where a rock-like [[ogre]] holds Excalibur, using it as a toothpick. They snatch Excalibur and flee from Ruber in the process. \n\nThey reach the edge of the forest Garrett says he belongs here, not in Camelot, and gives Kayley the Excalibur. Ruber captures Kayley, takes Excalibur and fuses it with his right arm. He imprisons Kayley in the wagon with Juliana. Devon and Cornwall, who witness this, rush to Garrett and convince him to save Kayley. By working together for the first time, Devon and Cornwall are able to fly and breathe fire, and they fly Garrett to Camelot. Bladebeak reconciles with his constantly henpecking [[Chicken|hen]] and frees Kayley from her ropes, and she warns the guards of Ruber's trap, exposing him and his steel men. Garrett, Devon and Cornwall arrive shortly after and come to her aid. Garrett enters the castle while Devon and Cornwall rescue Ayden from the Griffin by breathing fire at the creature, roasting it to death.\n\nInside, Kayley and Garrett find Ruber attempting to kill Arthur with Excalibur, gloating about how all-powerful he has become now. They intervene and trick Ruber into returning Excalibur to its stone, causing its magic to disintegrate Ruber, revert the steel men, including Bladebeak, back to normal and temporarily separate Devon and Cornwall, but they decide to end up back together again. Later, with Camelot restored to its former glory, Kayley and Garrett marry and both become Knights of the Round Table. The movie ends with the newlyweds riding off into the distance together on their horse.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jessalyn Gilsig]] as Kayley, a young woman who aspires to be a knight.\n** [[Andrea Corr]] as Kayley's singing voice.\n** Sarah Rayne as young Kayley.\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Garrett, a blind [[hermit]] who joins Kayley's quest.\n** [[Bryan White]] as Garrett's singing voice.\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Lord Ruber, a former knight plotting to steal [[Excalibur]] in order to become king of Camelot.\n* [[Eric Idle]] and [[Don Rickles]] as Devon and Cornwall, a comic relief two-headed dragon whom Kayley and Garrett meet.
