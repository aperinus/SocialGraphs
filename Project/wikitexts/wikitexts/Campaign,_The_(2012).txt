The film was released on August 10, 2012, by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros Pictures]], to mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Congress|Congressman]] Camden Brady, who has run unopposed for the fictional 14th District in [[North Carolina]] is exposed when he has an [[affair]] with a supporter, damaging his upcoming campaign for a fifth term. Glenn and Wade Motch, two corrupt businessmen persuade tour guide Martin Huggins to run as Camden's opposition as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee. The Motch Brothers ultimately intend to use Martin to forward a profitable scheme with a [[China|Chinese]] company.\n\n[[Campaign Manager]] Tim Wattley (also in the pay of the Motch Brothers) transforms Martin into a successful [[entrepreneur]] and family man, which pays off during his first debate with Camden and takes the viewers by storm with his resolve to bring back jobs to North Carolina. At a town hall debate, a fight breaks out between Camden and Huggins supporters after Huggins uses ''Rainbowland'', a story written by Camden as a child, to accuse him of being a Communist; Camden and Huggins also end up fighting, believing that they are insulting each other but were unable to hear each other over the commotion. Camden further damages his campaign when he accidentally punches a dog and a baby, on both occasions having intended to hit Martin. In response, Camden runs a campaign portraying Martin as an [[Al Qaeda]] terrorist ([[Osama bin Laden|based on Martin's facial hair]]). Camden later realizes his son intends to use his father's campaign methods against his opponent for [[Class President]], and realizes he is setting a bad example. Camden travels to Martin's home to make peace, but ends up getting drunk and is arrested for [[drink driving|drunk driving]] when Martin, encouraged by Tim, reports him. Martin then airs another TV advertisement, with Camden's son addressing him as \"dad\". Furious, Camden seduces Martin's wife Mitzi and records them having sex before releasing it as a campaign ad. This forces his Campaign Manager Mitch Wilson to resign on principle, and prompts his wife to leave him and take their children with her, leaving Camden despondent about the coming election. Martin leaves Mitzi as a result of the ad, but gets revenge on Camden by shooting him during a hunting trip, causing his popularity to further increase. However, Camden's popularity recovers after a mishap at a [[Snake handling in Christianity|snake handling ceremony]] results in him being hospitalized.\n\nMartin meets with the Motch brothers soon afterwards, but learns of their \"[[outsourcing|insourcing]]\" plans with China; they intend to turn the 14th district into a factory complex and import Chinese works in order to reduce shipping costs. Martin, realizing he has been used, rejects their support. The Motch brothers in turn defect to Camden's side, revitalizing his campaign and paying his wife to appear alongside him at campaign events to give the impression of reconciliation. Meanwhile, Martin reconciles with his wife and family, and desperately appeals to the voters by revealing the Motch Brothers' plans and promising to be completely honest (revealing several embarrassing secrets about himself in doing so). On election day, however, Camden wins due to the voting machines being [[election rigging|rigged]] by the brothers. Camden gloats about his victory to Martin, who recalls to Camden that he was the Class President at their school, and had removed a dangerous slide that had scarred the both of them. Martin tells Camden that this greatly inspired him. Realizing what he has done and who he has become, Camden denounces his win in the election and withdraws, and Martin wins by default. Martin and Camden become friends, with Camden being appointed Martin's [[chief of staff]].\n\nSix months later, the Motch brothers are called to appear before Congress after being exposed by Martin and Camden. The brothers point out that everything they have done is legal under ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' but are arrested due to their association with Wattley, who is in fact an international [[fugitive]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Representative Camden \"Cam\" Brady\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Martin Sylvester \"Marty\" Huggins\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Mitch Wilson\n* [[Dylan McDermott]] as Tim Wattley\n* [[Katherine LaNasa]] as Rose Brady\n* [[Sarah Baker (actress)|Sarah Baker]] as Mitzi Huggins\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Glenn Motch\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Wade Motch\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Raymond Huggins\n* Randall Cunningham as Cam Brady Jr.\n* [[Madison Wolfe]] as Jessica Brady\n* Grant Goodman as Clay Huggins\n* Kya Haywood as Dylan Huggins\n* [[Billy Slaughter]] as Dermot\n* [[Taryn Terrell]] as Janette\n* [[Josh Lawson]] as Tripp Huggins\n* [[P.
