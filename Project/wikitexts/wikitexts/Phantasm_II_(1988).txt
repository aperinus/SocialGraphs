It was written and directed by [[Don Coscarelli]] and stars [[Angus Scrimm]], [[James LeGros]] and [[Reggie Bannister]]. The first film's protagonist, Mike, recently released from a mental institution, recruits Reggie and some new friends in an effort to defeat the villain [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|Tall Man]].\n\nThe film caused controversy among fans by recasting main character Mike with LeGros, and was not well received by critics. It was followed by two [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead]]'' (1994) and ''[[Phantasm IV: Oblivion]]'' (1998) as well as the final film in the [[Phantasm (film series)|''Phantasm'' series]]: ''[[Phantasm: Ravager]]'' (2016), which received a theatrical release. Following distribution problems in the U.S., ''Phantasm II'' was released in Region 1 on DVD in 2009 and Blu-ray disc in 2013.\n\n==Plot==\nLiz Reynolds is a young woman whose psychic bond to Mike Pearson and the Tall Man manifests in the form of prophetic nightmares. Liz pleads for Mike to find her, as she fears that when her grandfather dies, the Tall Man will take him. The scene then transitions where the [[Phantasm (film)|first film]] left off, the [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|Tall Man]] and his minions attempt to kidnap Mike but [[Reggie (Phantasm)|Reggie]] manages to save him by blowing up the house.\n\nIn 1986, after being institutionalized for seven years, Mike, now 19, has faked his recovery to get released. That night he returns to Morningside Cemetery where he proceeds to dig up graves. Reggie interrupts him and explains that what happened in 1978 and the Tall Man were not real. In response, Mike reveals all the coffins he exhumed are empty and urges Reggie to help him hunt down the Tall Man. En route to Reggie's house, Mike has a premonition and frantically tries to warn Reggie seconds before an explosion kills Reggie's entire family.  Convinced by Mike's precognition, Reggie agrees to accompany Mike. They break into a hardware store and stock up on supplies and weapons. Traveling north-western country roads, they encounter abandoned towns, pillaged graveyards, and a few of the Tall Man's traps; one is the apparition of a young woman's naked corpse. A gruesome encounter with a creature resembling Liz leads them to travel east towards the town of Perigord, [[Oregon]].\n\nMeanwhile, Liz's grandfather dies, and her sister Jeri disappears during the funeral; while searching for Jeri, Liz finds the Tall Man and flees. The presiding priest, Father Meyers, maddened with fear and alcoholism, desecrates the grandfather's body with a knife in a desperate attempt to thwart its reanimation, but the corpse rises and kidnaps Liz's grandmother. In the morning, Liz finds a funeral pin in her grandmother's empty bed, and the Tall Man psychically tells Liz to return at night if she wants to rescue her grandmother. Prior to their arrival in Perigord, Mike awakens to find that Reggie has picked up a hitchhiker named Alchemy who eerily resembles the nude apparition. They find Perigord deserted and dilapidated. When Liz arrives at the mortuary, she is confronted by Father Meyers, who tries to convince her to escape with him, but he is killed by a flying sphere. She encounters the Tall Man and discovers that her grandmother is now one of his Lurkers; she flees and runs into Mike in the cemetery. Later that night, the Tall Man captures Liz and drives away in his hearse; Mike and Reggie chase after him. After the Tall Man runs them off the road, their car explodes.\n\nAt the crematorium, Liz is taken to the furnace room by the Tall Man's mortician assistants, but she escapes and sends one into the furnace. Mike and Reggie break into the mortuary and find the embalming room. While Reggie pours acid into the embalming fluid, Mike discovers a dimensional portal that requires a sphere to open. They then split up to find Liz. Reggie searches the basement, where he fights off a Graver and several Lurkers with a chainsaw and quadruple shotgun. After a vicious fight Reggie castrates the Graver to death and guns down the Lurkers. Mike saves Liz from a silver sphere which drills itself through the other mortician's hand, embedding him to the wall. A larger, gold sphere emerges and begins to chase Mike and Liz. Meanwhile, the other mortician's assistant chops his own hand off to escape the wall. Dodging the gold sphere's upgraded arsenal such as a scanner and lasers, Mike and Liz manage to hold off the attack by barricading themselves in the parlor after the sentinel rammed through multiple doors. The mortician assistant surprisingly returns and almost kills Liz before the gold sphere blasts through the door and drills its way into his back and up his throat with a spinning blade. Liz, Mike, and Reggie reunite and use the still embedded silver sphere to access the portal. Before they can destroy the building, the Tall Man surprises them, but they fight him off and pump him full of the acid-contaminated embalming fluid, which causes him to melt. They set the building on fire, escape, and are greeted by Alchemy, who has procured an abandoned hearse.\n\nAs they ride off, Alchemy reveals herself to not be human, and the hearse swerves wildly, then stops. Reggie, bloody and battered, falls to the ground; Mike and Liz, trapped in the hearse, try to convince themselves that this is all just a dream, but the slot to the driver's cabin opens and reveals the Tall Man, who tells them, \"No, it's not.\" Hands break the rear window and pull Mike and Liz through it, mirroring the ending of the first film.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Angus Scrimm]] as [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|The Tall Man]]\n* [[James LeGros]] as Mike Pearson\n* [[Reggie Bannister]] as [[Reggie (Phantasm)|Reggie]]\n* [[Paula Irvine]] as Liz Reynolds\n* [[Sam Phillips (model)|Samantha Phillips]] as Alchemy\n* [[Kenneth Tigar]] as Father Meyers\n* Rubin Kushner as Grandpa Alex Murphy\n* Ruth C.

Sequels in the 1980s were required to be bigger, gorier, and have more firepower than previous installments.  The theme of \"bigger is better\" means that everything is upgraded: a quadruple shotgun, golden spheres with increased weaponry, a chainsaw duel, and the nature of the Tall Man's death.  Muir states that the narrative of a boy dealing with the loss of his family is unchanged, but it is approached differently: instead of the surrealism of ''Phantasm'', it is approached in a conventional, less abstract manner.<ref>{{cite book|last=Muir|first=John Kenneth|title=Horror Films of the 1980s|year=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786455010|pages=686\u2013687|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ1vcmaOd7wC&pg=PA686|access-date=2013-08-15}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWriter-director Don Coscarelli says that he had been under pressure to film a sequel but could not come up with a story. Coscarelli considered the first film's ending to be conclusive, and did not feel knowledgeable about writing sequels, but he had what he described as a breakthrough when he realized he could start the film immediately after the previous film's final scene. He also added a [[road movie]] element in how Reggie and Mike combat the Tall Man, after which he described the process as straightforward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/phantasm-remastering-a-classic/|title=Phantasm: Remastering a Classic|last=Miller|first=Donna Marie|date=2016-04-14|publisher=Creative Screenwriting|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref> [[Universal Studios]], who took an interest in the film because they wanted a horror series, allocated three million dollars; this was the lowest budget of any of their films in the 1980s, but it was the highest budget of any ''Phantasm'' film.
