The picture is a [[film adaptation]] of [[Robert Harling (writer)|Robert Harling]]'s [[Steel Magnolias (play)|1987 play of the same name]] about the bond a group of women share in a small-town [[Southern United States|Southern]] community, and how they cope with the death of one of their own. The supporting cast features [[Tom Skerritt]], [[Dylan McDermott]], [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J. O'Connor]].\n\n[[Robert Harling (writer)|Robert Harling]] based the story in part on his sister, Susan Harling Robinson. She died in 1985 of complications from [[Type 1 diabetes]]. In the film, Julia Roberts plays Shelby, the character based on Susan.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.southernliving.com/culture/steel-magnolias-movie-facts| title = Things Even Die-Hard Steel Magnolias Fans Probably Don't Know About the Classic {{!}} Southern Living}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAnnelle Dupuy, a shy, awkward beauty school graduate, moves to the northwestern [[Louisiana]] town of Chinquapin Parish, where Truvy Jones hires her to work in her home-based beauty salon.\n\nMeanwhile, M'Lynn Eatenton and her daughter, Shelby, busily prepare for Shelby's wedding that is being held later that day. Along with Clairee Belcher\u2014the former mayor's cheerful widow\u2014they arrive at Truvy's to have their hair done. While there, Shelby, who has [[type 1 diabetes]], suffers a [[hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]] attack, but recovers quickly with the women's help. M'Lynn reveals that due to Shelby's medical condition, her doctor advises against her having children. Shelby considered ending her engagement to her fianc\u00e9, Jackson, so he would not be deprived of children.\n\nGrouchy and sarcastic Louisa \"Ouiser\" Boudreaux arrives at the salon and immediately begins interrogating Annelle about her background. Annelle tearfully reveals that her no-good husband, Bunkie, is evading the police and has taken all their money, her clothes and jewelry, and the car. Annelle further admits she is unsure her marriage is legal. Shelby, sympathetic, invites Annelle to the wedding reception where she meets bartender Sammy DeSoto. Soon after, Annelle, following a short-lived wild streak, becomes deeply religious, annoying everyone, including Sammy.\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays, Shelby announces she is pregnant. Everyone is thrilled except M\u2019Lynn, knowing the risks. Truvy encourages M'Lynn to instead focus on the joy a new baby brings.\n\nShelby has a baby boy, Jackson Jr., but soon develops kidney failure requiring regular [[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]]. Around Jackson Jr.'s first birthday, Shelby undergoes a successful transplant with M'Lynn's donated kidney. Shelby recovers, but four months later, Jackson arrives home to find her unconscious. Shelby is comatose, having contracted an infection in her central nervous system due to the suppressive therapy that keeps her body from rejecting the kidney. After doctors determine Shelby's condition is irreversible, the family jointly decide to remove her from life support.\n\nAfter the funeral, M'Lynn breaks down, but the other women comfort her. M'Lynn gradually accepts her daughter's decision to have risked her life in return for a few special years of motherhood and decides to focus her energy on helping Jackson raising her grandson. Annelle, now married to Sammy and pregnant, tells M'Lynn she wants to name her own baby after Shelby, as she was the reason she and Sammy met. M'Lynn approves, stating, \"Life goes on.\"\n\nAt the town Easter egg hunt, Annelle goes into labor and is rushed to the hospital and another life begins.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!width=20%|Actor\n!width=20%|Character\n!width=60%|Character description\n|-\n| [[Sally Field]]\n| M'Lynn Eatenton\n| Social worker; wife to Drum Eatenton; mother to Shelby, Jonathan and Tommy; Jackson's mother-in-law; Jack Jr.'s maternal grandmother\n|-\n| [[Dolly Parton]]\n| Truvy Jones\n| Glamour Technician; wife to Spud Jones; mother to Louie; town gossip\n|-\n| [[Shirley MacLaine]]\n| Louisa \"Ouiser\" Boudreaux\n| Clairee Belcher's best friend and confidante; Eatenton family's next-door neighbor; town curmudgeon; Drum Eatenton's nemesis\n|-\n| [[Daryl Hannah]]\n| Annelle Dupuy-DeSoto\n| Newcomer to town; apprentice beautician hired by Truvy Jones; first married to Bunkie Dupuy; later marries Sammy DeSoto\n|-\n| [[Olympia Dukakis]]\n| Clairee Belcher\n| Former town first lady; sister to Drew Marmillion; sister-in-law to Belle Marmillion; aunt to Marshall and Nancy Beth Marmillion; best friend and confidant of Ouiser Boudreaux; friend of the Eatentons and Joneses\n|-\n| [[Julia Roberts]]\n| Shelby Eatenton-Latcherie\n| Eldest child and only daughter of Drum and M'Lynn Eatenton; sister to Jonathan and Tommy; marries Jackson Latcherie and gives birth to Jack Latcherie Jr.; suffers from type one diabetes\n|-\n| [[Tom Skerritt]]\n| Drum Eatenton\n| Husband of M'Lynn Eatenton; father to Shelby, Jonathan, and Tommy; Jackson Latcherie's father-in-law; Jack Jr.'s maternal grandfather\n|-\n| [[Sam Shepard]]\n| Spud Jones\n| Sporadically employed laborer; Truvy Jones's husband and Louie's father\n|-\n| [[Dylan McDermott]]\n| Jackson Latcherie\n| Lawyer; Shelby Eatenton's husband; Jack Jr.'s father; Drum and M'Lynn's son-in-law and Jonathan and Tommy's brother-in-law\n|-\n| [[Kevin J.
