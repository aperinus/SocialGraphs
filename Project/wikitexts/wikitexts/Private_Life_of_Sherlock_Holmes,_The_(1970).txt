A. L. Diamond]], and directed by Wilder. The film offers an affectionate, slightly parodic look at [[Sherlock Holmes]], and draws a distinction between the \"real\" Holmes and the character portrayed by Watson in his stories for ''[[Strand Magazine|The Strand]]'' magazine. It stars [[Robert Stephens]] as Holmes and [[Colin Blakely]] as [[Doctor Watson]].\n\n[[Steven Moffat]] and [[Mark Gatiss]], the creators and writers of the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and [[Emmy Award]]-winning series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', credited ''The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes'' as a source of inspiration for their show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/sherlock/20536/steven-moffat-and-mark-gatiss-interview-sherlock|title=Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss interview: Sherlock|author=Michael Leader|date=21 July 2010|work=Den of Geek|access-date=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DscyvadOM8g  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/DscyvadOM8g |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|title=How well do Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat know each other?

In the first and shorter of the two, in August 1887 Holmes is approached by Rogozhin, on behalf of a famous Russian ballerina, Madame Petrova. Madame Petrova is about to retire, and wishes to have a child. She proposes that Holmes be the father, one who she hopes will inherit her beauty and his intellect. Holmes manages to extricate himself by claiming that Watson is his lover, much to the doctor's embarrassment. Back at 221B, Watson confronts Holmes about the reality of the ensuing rumours, and Holmes only states that Watson is \"being presumptuous\" by asking Holmes whether he has had relationships with women.\n\nIn the main plot, a [[Belgium|Belgian]] woman, Gabrielle Valladon, is fished out of the [[River Thames]] and brought to [[Baker Street]]. She begs Holmes to find her missing engineer husband. The resulting investigation leads to a castle in Scotland. Along the way, they encounter a group of monks and some dwarfs, and Watson apparently sights the [[Loch Ness monster]].  They see both canaries and sulfuric acid being carried into the castle, and conclude that the canaries are used to detect chlorine gas produced when the sulfuric acid is mixed with sea water.\n\nIt turns out that Sherlock's brother [[Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] is involved in building a pre-[[World War I]] submarine for the [[Royal Navy|British Navy]], with the assistance of Monsieur Valladon.  When taken out for testing, it was disguised as a sea monster. The dwarfs were recruited as crewmen because they took up less space and needed less air. When they meet, Mycroft informs Sherlock that his client is actually a top German spy, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, sent to steal the submersible. The \"monks\" are German sailors.\n\nQueen Victoria arrives for an inspection of the new weapon, but objects to its unsportsmanlike nature. She orders the exasperated Mycroft to destroy it, so he conveniently leaves it unguarded for the monks to take (rigging it to sink when it is submerged). Fr\u00e4ulein von Hoffmanstal is arrested, to be exchanged for her British counterpart.\n\nIn the final scene some months later, Sherlock receives a message from his brother, telling him that von Hoffmanstal had been arrested as a spy in Japan, and subsequently executed by firing squad. Heartbroken, the detective retreats to his room to seek solace in a 7% solution of cocaine.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Stephens]] as [[Sherlock Holmes]]\n* [[Colin Blakely]] as Dr. [[Doctor Watson|John H.

The  cemetery scene with Stanley Holloway was filmed at the Church of St Mary, Winkfield in Berkshire. Somerset House in London and the London Coliseum were also used as locations.   Castle Stuart and [[Eilean Donan]] Castle in Scotland and Broadway Tower in Worcestershire made fleeting appearances.<ref name=\"barnes\"/>\n\n===Cut scenes===\nThe first cut of the film ran approximately three hours and twenty minutes. As a result, large portions were deleted. The following scenes were all filmed, but were cut from the final release at the studio's insistence.<ref name=\"Coe\"/> What remained of them was recovered and restored for the film's [[LaserDisc]] release.<ref name=\"dvdsavant\"/> None of the scenes survive in their complete form, with both film footage and audio.\n\nThe deleted scenes include:\n\n- A modern-day prologue in which Dr. Watson's grandson, also Dr. Watson (a Canadian veterinarian), also played by Colin Blakely, visits a London bank to claim his grandfather's belongings. The head of the bank, Havelock-Smith, ([[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]]) brings Dr. Watson his grandfather's strongbox, which contains items of Holmes and Watson's, along with a number of unpublished stories. (This scene is entirely lost, only production stills and the script survive)\n\n- The prologue then transitioned into the 1887 portion of the film. We meet Holmes and Watson as they journey back to London by train, having just solved a case in Yorkshire. A disheveled man rushes into their compartment, and promptly falls asleep. Based on numerous clues, Holmes deduces that the man is an Italian music teacher who was having an affair with the wife of a nobleman, got caught, jumped out the window, and ran onto the train. This scene transitioned into their arrival at 221B Baker Street, as seen in the finished film. (Only the audio for this scene survives, along with production stills)\n\n- \"The Curious Case of the Upside Down Room\" - [[Inspector Lestrade]] visits Holmes and Watson and asks for help solving the seemingly impossible case of a corpse found in a room that was discovered entirely upside-down, with furniture on the ceiling. The three of them visit the scene of the crime, where Holmes inspects the clues. Back at home, Holmes deduces that Watson staged the whole thing in an attempt to pique Holmes' interest, drag his friend out of a deep depression and wean him away from cocaine.<ref name=\"barnes\"/> Watson is furious that his ruse has been discovered and that his friend intends to continue using drugs. He threatens to move out, but Holmes destroys his vials of cocaine. Watson agrees to stay, and we realize that the vials Holmes destroyed were empty, he has hidden the full vials in his violin case. (Only the audio for this sequence survives, along with production stills)\n\n- \"The Adventure of the Dumbfounded Detective\" - During the scene in the film where Holmes is traveling by train to Scotland with Gabrielle, there was originally a segue into a flashback, where he told her about his student days at Oxford. Holmes had fallen in love with a beautiful girl from afar. After Holmes's crew team won a race against Cambridge, to celebrate, they pooled their money and held a lottery, with the winner getting time with a prostitute ([[Jenny Hanley]]). Holmes won, but was nervous, because he did not want to sully his love for the girl he had seen. Then the prostitute turned around, and he realized that she was that same girl. Holmes tells Gabrielle that this episode taught him emotional involvement was not worth the risk for someone in his position.

When a murder is discovered on board, Holmes tells Watson to attempt to solve the case himself. Holmes watches, without saying anything, as Watson proceeds to go to the wrong cabin, where he finds a honeymooning couple passed out drunk, naked, in bed. Mistaking them for the murder victims, Watson begins to deduce an elaborate solution based on the \"evidence\" he sees around him, while Holmes listens, amused. When the lovers wake up, Holmes tells Watson he has gone to the wrong cabin, and Watson decides not to try to solve a case again.<ref name=\"barnes\"/> (Only the film footage for this sequence survives, the audio is lost)\n\n- An epilogue scene, immediately after Holmes retreats into his room to use cocaine on learning of the death of Gabrielle/Ilse, in which Inspector Lestrade arrives at 221B Baker Street and asks Watson for Holmes's help in solving the ongoing [[Jack the Ripper]] murders. Watson regretfully says that Holmes is busy and must decline. Lestrade assures Watson that Scotland Yard can solve the case without Holmes.<ref name=\"barnes\"/><ref name=\"eyles\"/> (Only the audio for this scene survives)\n\n- Another deleted scene involved Rogozhin arriving at 221B Baker Street to give Holmes the Stradivarius promised to him by Madame Petrova. Still believing Holmes's story that he and Watson are both gay, Rogozhin offers roses to Watson. Editor Ernest Walter unsuccessfully argued for this to be the final scene of the film, as a nod to the finale of ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', but Billy Wilder refused, preferring to end the film on a more mournful note. (This scene does not survive)\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Lost Loch Ness prop===\nA 30&nbsp;ft (9m) model of the Loch Ness Monster was built for the film in 1969. The model included a neck and two humps and was taken alongside a pier for filming of portions of the film. Billy Wilder did not want the humps and asked that they be removed, despite warnings that it would affect its buoyancy. As a result, the model sank. The model was rediscovered in April 2016 during a Scottish expedition to find the Loch Ness Monster.<ref>{{cite web|last=McKenzie|first=Steven|date=13 April 2016|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-36024638|title=Film's Lost Nessie Monster Prop Found in Loch Ness|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/world/europe/loch-ness-monster-found-kind-of-not-really.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur|title=Loch Ness Monster Is Found!

[[Mark Gatiss]] called ''The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes'' \"the film that changed his life\" for this reason: \"It's a fantastically melancholy film. The relationship between Sherlock and Watson is treated beautifully; Sherlock effectively falls in love with him in the film, but it's so desperately unspoken.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/07/mark-gatiss-sherlock-holmes |title=The film that changed my life: Mark Gatiss |last=Morgan |first=Eleanor |date=6 November 2010 |work=The Guardian |access-date=19 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nUpon its release at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City, it received excellent reviews.<ref name=open>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Broadway's Sound Of Sex And Music; 'Pussycat' $100,206; 'Norway' $41,000; 'Holmes' 145G, 2d; 'Cromwell' 49G, 2d|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_variety_1970-11-11_260_13/page/9|date=November 11, 1970|page=9}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] called it a \"comparatively mild Billy Wilder and rather daring Sherlock Holmes, not a perfect mix, perhaps, but a fond and entertaining one\".<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/27/specials/wilder-sherlock.html |title=  Wilder's 'Sherlock Holmes' Opens at the Music Hall |date= 30 October 1970| work= The New York Times | first= Vincent |last=Canby | author-link= Vincent Canby| access-date= 2015-07-16}}</ref> It grossed $150,000 in its opening week at the Music Hall, ranking 13th at the US box office.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=50 Top-Grossing Films|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_variety_1970-11-11_260_13/page/11|date=November 11, 1970|page=11}}</ref> [[Kim Newman]], reviewing it in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine, described it as the \"best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made\" and \"sorely underrated in the Wilder canon\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/ReviewComplete.asp?FID=8596|title=Empire's The Private Life Of Sherlock Holmes Movie Review |work= Empireonline.com |access-date=12 January 2015}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] was more critical, giving the film two-and-a-half stars out of four.
