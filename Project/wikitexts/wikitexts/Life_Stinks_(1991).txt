It is one of the few Mel Brooks comedies that is not a [[parody film|parody]], nor at any time does the film break the [[fourth wall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2015/filmmaker-retrospective-the-parody-cinema-of-mel-brooks/2/|title=Filmmaker Retrospective: The Parody Cinema of Mel Brooks |first=Ryan|last=Anderson|date=June 14, 2015|accessdate=July 20, 2018|work=Taste of Cinema}}</ref> It co-stars [[Lesley Ann Warren]], [[Howard Morris]] and [[Jeffrey Tambor]]. The original music score was composed by [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]]. The film was both a critical and a box-office flop.\n\n==Plot==\nGoddard Bolt (Mel Brooks) is the callous CEO of Bolt Enterprises. Bolt shows little regard for other people's needs, or for the environment. He has his eye on the [[slum]] of Los Angeles, with the intent of [[urban renewal|tearing it down]]. Bolt makes a bet with his biggest rival, Vance Crasswell (Jeffrey Tambor), who also has an interest in the property. Crasswell challenges Bolt to survive on the streets as if he were homeless for 30 days. Should Bolt lose, Crasswell owns the property, but should Bolt win, Crasswell will sell it for practically nothing.\n\nThere are three conditions: Bolt will be completely penniless; he must wear an [[electronic anklet]] that will activate if he leaves the boundaries, forfeiting the bet if he exceeds 30 seconds out of bounds; and at no time can he reveal to any of the slum area residents that he is Goddard Bolt. To add to the look, Bolt has his mustache shaved off, then Crasswell confiscates his [[toupee]] and rips his jacket chest pocket. Bolt is taken to the slums, thrown out of the limo and begins the bet. Unbeknown to Bolt, Crasswell schemes to make Goddard's stay on the streets as bad as possible. Bolt, homeless, hungry and filthy, is befriended by [[skid-row]] inhabitants like Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Theodore Wilson) and given the nickname \"Pepto\" after falling asleep in a crate with a [[Pepto-Bismol]] logo on its side, having used the crate to urinate on mere moments before Sailor arrives.\n\nDuring the bet, he meets and eventually becomes attracted to Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), a homeless woman who used to be a dancer on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. During a scuffle with two muggers (including a chase through a Chinese kitchen/restaurant), Bolt is pushed out of bounds, which activates his anklet. To prevent the \"30-second forfeiture\", Bolt rushes back in, which impresses Molly with his supposed bravery, as it looks like he is tackling the muggers. The muggers are eventually defeated via a pot of boiling stock being poured over them from a height, forcing them to retreat their assault on Bolt.\n\nBolt learns a series of important life lessons during his 'adventure', namely that life is not about accomplishments or material success, but rather the integrity of the human spirit. However, Bolt is unaware that the unscrupulous Crasswell has no intention of honoring their bet. When Crasswell realizes that Bolt is honoring the bet fair and square, Crasswell bribes Bolt's lawyers into fabricating the story that Bolt had lost his mind and has his property seized. Bolt finds this out first hand as, upon completing the bet, he forces his way into a party which is being held by Crasswell at Bolt's home and his lawyers feign ignorance.\n\nForced to live on the streets for good and remanded to a free clinic by mistake, a drugged Bolt murmurs that \"life stinks\". Molly implores him to remember the small things, such as the two of them waltzing, that make life livable. Crasswell, meanwhile, has his own plans for the slum area, planning to tear it down as well. Bolt incites Fumes and the other slum residents to stage a mock battle during the televised ceremony of Crasswell demolishing the slum area. Realising that he will be ousted, Crasswell attempts to stop Bolt with a hydraulic excavator. When Bolt's grapple has plucked Crasswell and has him hanging by his jacket, the scene is freeze-framed into a news report saying that Crasswell, in a court case, was forced to admit he made a bet with Bolt, then reneged on the terms.\n\nBolt, now in control of the area, has plans to renovate it into the \"Bolt Center\", which will give the slum residents employment, renovate the tenements into livable homes, and give the children a private school financed entirely out of pocket by Goddard Bolt. The news report ends by saying that Bolt has married Molly, and the press are expecting an extravagant CEO-type event, only to then be shown Goddard and Molly taking their wedding vows in a simple [[chapel]] in the slum area, then driving off in a limousine with a [[vanity plate]] \"PEPTO\".\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Mel Brooks]] as Goddard Bolt\n*[[Lesley Ann Warren]] as Molly\n*[[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Vance Crasswell\n*[[Stuart Pankin]] as Pritchard\n*[[Howard Morris]] as Sailor\n*[[Rudy De Luca]] as J.

Summing up \"The problem with ''Life Stinks'' is that it's got its heart in the right place but not a whole lot else,\" she gave it two out of five stars.
