The film stars [[Ryan Gosling]], [[Shareeka Epps]] and [[Anthony Mackie]]. It was scored by Canadian band [[Broken Social Scene]]. 26-year-old Gosling was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance, becoming the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Best Actor in a Leading Role|eighth-youngest nominee]] in the category.\n\nThe story concerns an [[inner city]] [[middle-school]] teacher who forms a friendship with a student, after she discovers that he has a drug habit. The film is based on a 19-minute film made by Boden and Fleck in 2004, titled ''Gowanus, Brooklyn''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0392061 \"Gowanus, Brooklyn (2004)\"]. ''IMDb''. Amazon.com. Retrieved March 5, 2012.</ref> It premiered in competition at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]]. It was released theatrically on August 11, 2006.\n\n== Plot ==\nDan Dunne is a young middle-school history teacher at a [[Brooklyn]] school, with a teaching style that rejects the standard curriculum in favor of an approach based upon [[dialectics]]. While being an engaging teacher in the classroom, in his own time he is shown snorting and [[freebasing]] [[cocaine]]. Dan becomes upset when his ex-girlfriend, Rachel, turns up unexpected at a school basketball game, wanting to see him. A short while later, one of his students, Drey, catches him freebasing in the locker room.\n\nDrey's family consists of her overworked single-mother and her brother, Mike, who is in prison for selling drugs for a neighborhood dealer, Frank. Drey's father is also absent, making her dependent on Dan for rides home from school. Her lack of supervision also makes her a target for Frank, who encourages her to sell drugs for him. As Dan and Drey's friendship develops, Dan perceives Frank to be a bad influence on her and tries to persuade him to stay away from her. Drey tries to get Dan to open up about his drug habit to her, though to no avail.\n\nAfter a tense conversation with Frank about Drey, Dan becomes intoxicated and visits Isabel, another teacher at the school whom he has dated. Initially seeking affection, he then forces himself on her, and she defends herself and runs from him; Dan leaves after apologizing. The following day, Dan is hostile towards Drey, ignoring her concern for him and telling her they are not friends. Drey instead associates with Frank, and completes her first drug sale for him.\n\nDan goes to his parents' house for dinner, though is distant and uninterested in the conversation. Dan's brother's girlfriend, Cindy, catches him freebasing in the garage; the two converse and she tells him a joke which makes him laugh. The same night, Drey is out with Frank, selling drugs. Drey arrives at a motel to make a delivery and finds a room of people using drugs. Dan is there and is revealed to be the buyer. The two do not talk as he hands her the money.\n\nThe next day, Dan is absent from school, and the class has a substitute teacher. Drey is affected by his absence, and declines a ride home from Frank once school is finished. She instead visits Dan's motel room, finding him hung-over from the previous night. Dan cleans himself up, before sitting down to drink a glass of water. Drey sits down and joins him. The film ends with Dan telling the same joke he heard from Cindy, but he gets the timing of the joke wrong, ruining it. Drey and Dan both break out in laughter at his failed joke.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Dan Dunne, a troubled history teacher\n* [[Shareeka Epps]] as Drey, a 13-year-old student of Dan's\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Frank, a local drug dealer\n* [[Monique Gabriela Curnen]] as Isabel Redding, a teacher\n* [[Denis O'Hare]] as Jimbo, a teacher\n* Starla Benford as Principal Joy Henderson\n* Nathan Corbett as Terrance, a student\n* Tyra Kwao-Vovo as Stacy, a student\n* [[Jeff Lima (actor)|Jeff Lima]] as Roodly, a student\n* Karen Chilton as Karen, Drey's mother\n* [[Deborah Rush]] as Jo Dunne, Dan's mother\n* [[Jay O.
