The first in the [[Robert Langdon (film series)|''Robert Langdon'' film series]], the film stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Audrey Tautou]], [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]], [[Jean Reno]] and [[Paul Bettany]]. In the film, [[Robert Langdon]], a professor of religious symbology from [[Harvard University]], is the prime suspect in the grisly and unusual murder of Louvre curator Jacques Sauni\u00e8re. On the body, the police find a disconcerting cipher and start an investigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.danbrown.com/the-davinci-code/|title=Dan Brown \u00bb The Da Vinci Code|website=Dan Brown|access-date=April 22, 2016}}</ref> Langdon escapes with the assistance of police cryptologist Sophie Neveu, and they begin a quest for the legendary [[Holy Grail]]. A noted British Grail historian, Sir Leigh Teabing, tells them that the actual Holy Grail is explicitly encoded in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s wall painting, ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''. Also searching for the Grail is a secret cabal within [[Opus Dei]], an actual [[prelature]] of the [[Holy See]], who wish to keep the true Grail a secret to prevent the destruction of Christianity.\n\nThe film, like the book, was considered controversial. It was met with especially harsh criticism by the [[Catholic Church]] for the accusation that it is behind a two-thousand-year-old cover-up concerning what the Holy Grail really is and the concept that Jesus Christ and [[Mary Magdalene]] were married and that the union produced a daughter, as well as its treatment of the organizations [[Priory of Sion]] and Opus Dei. Many members urged the [[laity]] to boycott the film. In the book, Dan Brown states that the Priory of Sion and \"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\"\n\nThe film grossed $224 million in its worldwide opening weekend and a total of $760 million worldwide, becoming the [[2006 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2006]], as well as Howard's highest-grossing film to date. However, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Angels & Demons (film)|Angels & Demons]]'' (2009) and ''[[Inferno (2016 film)|Inferno]]'' (2016).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->\nJacques Sauni\u00e8re, a [[Louvre]] curator, is pursued through the Grand Gallery by an [[Albinism in humans|albino]] [[Catholic]] [[monk]] named Silas, who demands the location of the Priory's \"keystone\" to find and destroy the [[Holy Grail]]. Sauni\u00e8re gives him a false lead and is murdered. The police find his body posed like Da Vinci's ''[[Vitruvian Man]]''. Police captain Bezu Fache has his lieutenant, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Collet, summon American [[symbologist]] [[Robert Langdon]], who is in Paris for a lecture on the interpretation of symbols, to examine Sauni\u00e8re's body.\n\nLangdon is shown the body and a secret message, readable only by [[blacklight]]. It contains an out-of-order [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] sequence. Sophie Neveu, a police [[cryptographer]] and Sauni\u00e8re's granddaughter, tells Langdon that Fache planted a tracker on him after finding the words, \"P.S. Find Robert Langdon\" at the end of Sauni\u00e8re's secret message. Fache believes that Langdon murdered Sauni\u00e8re. Sophie throws away the tracker, distracting the police while they sneak around the Louvre, finding more clues in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s works. Langdon deduces that Sauni\u00e8re was the grand master of the [[Priory of Sion]].\n\nSilas works for an anonymous person referred to as \"The Teacher\", along with members of [[Opus Dei]], led by Bishop Aringarosa. Langdon and Sophie travel to a French bank and access Sauni\u00e8re's [[safe deposit box]] by using the [[Fibonacci sequence]]. Inside is a [[cryptex]], a cylindrical container that contains a message on [[papyrus]]. It can only be opened without destroying the contents by turning dials to spell a code word. As the police arrive, bank manager Andre Vernet helps Langdon and Sophie escape, then attempts to steal the cryptex and murder them. Langdon and Sophie escape with the cryptex.\n\nThey visit Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail expert. Teabing claims the Grail is not a cup but instead is [[Mary Magdalene]]. He says she was not a prostitute but the wife of [[Jesus Christ]]. Teabing argues that Mary was pregnant during his crucifixion, and the Priory was formed to protect their descendants. The [[Opus Dei]] have been trying to destroy the Grail to preserve the credibility of the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Later, Silas breaks into Teabing's house, but Teabing, who uses crutches, uses one to disable him. The group escapes to [[London]] via Teabing's private plane, along with his butler, Remy Jean. Their interpretation of a clue hidden in the cryptex box leads them to the [[Temple Church]], where they find nothing. Remy, who claims to be the Teacher, frees Silas. Remy takes Teabing hostage, dumping him in the car trunk, and taking Silas to hide out in an Opus Dei [[safe house]]. Teabing, who is revealed as the Teacher, later poisons Remy and sends the police after Silas. Police shoot Silas after accidentally wounding Aringarosa, who is promptly arrested by Fache, who resents being used to hunt Langdon.\n\nTeabing, who wants to bring down the Church for centuries of persecution and deceit, confronts Langdon and Sophie. Now understanding the true meaning behind the clue to unlocking the cryptex, the trio goes to [[Westminster Abbey]] to the tomb of [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], a former grand master of the Priory. Teabing demands that the pair open the cryptex. Langdon tries and seemingly fails before suddenly tossing the cryptex into the air. Teabing dives for and catches it, but the vial breaks and the papyrus is thought destroyed. The police arrive to arrest Teabing, who realizes Langdon must have solved the cryptex's code and removed the papyrus before throwing it. The code is revealed to be \"APPLE\", after the [[Isaac Newton#Apple incident|apocryphal myth]] of the apple which led Newton to discover his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]]. The clue inside the cryptex, which tells of the Grail hiding {{\" '}}neath the rose,\" leads Langdon and Sophie to [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in [[Scotland]].\n\nInside the chapel, they discover a secret room where Magdalene's tomb has been removed. Langdon, after searching through documents, realizes that Sophie's family died in a car crash, that Sauni\u00e8re was not her grandfather but her protector, and that she is the last descendant of Jesus Christ. The two are greeted by several members of the Priory, including Sophie's grandmother, who promises to protect her. Langdon and Sophie part ways, the former returning to Paris. While shaving, he cuts himself and has an epiphany when his blood curves down the sink, reminding him of the [[Rose Line]]. Realizing the true meaning of the cryptex clue, he follows the line to the Louvre, concluding the Holy Grail is hidden below the [[Pyramide Invers\u00e9e]]. Langdon kneels atop it and the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene is seen in a secret underground chamber.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Tom Hanks]] as [[Robert Langdon]]\n*[[Audrey Tautou]] as Sophie Neveu\n*[[Ian McKellen]] as Sir Leigh Teabing\n*[[Alfred Molina]] as Bishop Aringarosa\n*[[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Andr\u00e9 Vernet\n*[[Jean Reno]] as Police Captain Bezu Fache\n*[[Paul Bettany]] as Silas\n**[[Hugh Mitchell (actor)|Hugh Mitchell]] as young Silas\n*[[\u00c9tienne Chicot]] as Lieutenant J\u00e9r\u00f4me Collet\n*[[Jean-Yves Berteloot]] as Remy Jean\n*[[Jean-Pierre Marielle]] as Jacques Sauni\u00e8re\n*Charlotte Graham as Mary Magdalene\n*[[Seth Gabel]] as Michael the Cleric\n*[[Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Audollent]] as Sister Sandrine\n*[[Francesco Carnelutti (actor)|Francesco Carnelutti]] as Prefect\n*Rita Davies as Elegant Woman at Rosslyn\n*[[Denis Podalyd\u00e8s]] as Flight Controller\n*[[Ranaich Dunnett]] as Himself\n*Author [[Dan Brown]] and his wife make cameos (forefront) in the first scene of the book signing scene.\n*''[[The Templar Revelation]]'' authors [[Lynn Picknett]] and Clive Prince make a brief appearance as passengers on a bus.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film rights were purchased from [[Dan Brown]] for $6 million.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bayer |first=Jeff |title=5 Things You Didn't Know About The Movie The Da Vinci Code|url=http://au.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_100/114_special_feature.html |date=2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919100900/http://au.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_100/114_special_feature.html |archive-date=September 19, 2009 |website=AskMen.com |access-date=October 25, 2020}}</ref> [[Bill Paxton]] was the director Ron Howard's first choice for the role of Robert Langdon, but had to decline as he was beginning filming for the television series ''[[Big Love]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/movies/873866/twister-titanic-apollo-13-and-aliens-star-bill-paxton-dies|title=Twister, Titanic, Apollo 13, and Aliens star Bill Paxton dies|work=The Georgia Straight|author=Smith, Charlie|date=February 26, 2017|access-date=October 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming had been scheduled to start in May 2005; however, some delays caused filming to begin on June 30, 2005.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe filmmakers shot many of the inside scenes at [[Pinewood Studios]];<ref name=underwater>[http://www.pinewoodshepperton.com/html/News/ustageopening.htm \"Gordon Brown Opens Underwater Stage at Pinewood Studios\"], May 19, 2005 {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref> the opening sequence in the cavernous [[007 Stage]] at Pinewood Shepperton, where the interior of the Louvre was recreated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.whas11.com/sharedcontent/features/printwire/073006ccdrEntBond.3c44885.html|author=Fretland, Katie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808213505/http://www.whas11.com/sharedcontent/features/printwire/073006ccdrEntBond.3c44885.html|title=Fire chars British set of new Bond movie|website=WHAS11 News|agency=Associated Press|date=July 30, 2006|access-date=October 25, 2020|archive-date=August 8, 2006}}</ref> In this sequence, Hanks' character is taken by French police to the Louvre, where a dead body has been discovered.
