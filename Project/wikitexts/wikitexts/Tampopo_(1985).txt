The publicity for the film calls it the first \"[[ramen]] western\", a play on the term [[Spaghetti Western]] ([[Western film|films about the American Old West]] made by Italian production studios).\n\n==Plot==\nA pair of truck drivers, the experienced Gor\u014d and a younger sidekick named Gun, stop at a decrepit roadside ramen noodle shop. Outside, Gor\u014d rescues a boy who is being beaten up by three schoolmates. The boy, Tabo, turns out to be the son of Tampopo, the widowed owner of the struggling business, Lai Lai. When a customer called Pisken harasses Tampopo, Gor\u014d invites him and his men to step outside. Gor\u014d puts up a good fight, but outnumbered by Pisken and his men, he is knocked out and wakes up the next morning in Tampopo's home.\n\nWhen Tampopo asks their opinion of her noodles, Gor\u014d and Gun tell her they are \"sincere, but lack character.\" After Gor\u014d gives her some advice, she asks him to become her teacher. They decide to turn her establishment into a paragon of the \"art of noodle soup making\". Gor\u014d takes her around and points out the strengths and weaknesses of her competitors. She still cannot get the broth just right, so Gor\u014d brings in the \"old master\" and his superlative expertise. When they rescue a wealthy elderly man from choking on his food, he lends her his chauffeur Shohei, who has a masterly way with noodles. Also, through clever trickery they pry ramen secrets from their competitors. During the transition, the group agrees to change the restaurant's name from \"Lai Lai\" to \"Tampopo\".\n\nPisken feels bad for being too drunk to tell his men to stay out of the fight, so he offers Gor\u014d another chance one-on-one. After the rematch ends in a draw, Pisken reveals he is a contractor and offers to make over the shop's interior. Tampopo's latest effort still comes up short, so Pisken teaches her his own secret recipe. When the five men consume her latest creation down to the last drop, Tampopo knows she has won. (Tabo also triumphs, beating all three of his tormentors). As customers fill her newly redecorated shop, the men file out one by one.\n\nThe main narrative is interspersed with stories involving food on several levels. \nOther vignettes follow a lowly worker who upstages his superiors by displaying his vast culinary knowledge while ordering at a gourmet [[French restaurant]]; a housewife who rises from her deathbed to cook one last meal for her family; and a women's etiquette class on how to eat spaghetti properly. Another scene involves a supermarket clerk who has to deal with an aged woman obsessed with squeezing food. The clerk's scene segues into a restaurant involving an investment scam and the intended victim, who turns out to be a conman himself.\n\nThe primary subplot involves a young gangster in a white suit and his lover, who explore erotic ways to use food. In the end, the man is shot several times by an unknown assailant, to his lover's horror, but uses his last words to convey his secret recipe for sausages.\n\nThroughout, the film puns off stereotypical American movie themes, characters, music and camera set-ups and shots.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tsutomu Yamazaki]] as Gor\u014d\n* [[Nobuko Miyamoto]] as Tampopo\n* [[K\u014dji Yakusho]] as Man in White Suit\n* [[Ken Watanabe]] as Gun\n* [[Rikiya Yasuoka]] as Pisuken\n* [[Kinz\u014d Sakura]] as Sh\u014dhei\n* [[Yoshi Kat\u014d]] as Noodle-making master\n* [[Hideji \u014ctaki]] as Rich Old Man\n* [[Fukumi Kuroda]] as Man in White Suit's mistress\n* [[Setsuko Shinoi]] as Old Man's mistress\n* [[Yoriko D\u014dguchi]] as Pearl diver (Oyster girl)\n* [[Masahiko Tsugawa]] as Supermarket manager\n* [[Yoshihiro Kat\u014d]] as Man in White Suit's henchman\n* [[Mariko Okada]] as Spaghetti sensei\n* [[Ry\u016btar\u014d \u014ctomo]] as Ramen master\n* [[Toshiya Fujita (director)|Toshiya Fujita]] as Man with Toothache (un-credited)\n\n==Release==\nA road show release of ''Tampopo'' was distributed by [[Toho]] on November 23, 1985.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=346}} The film was released by [[New Yorker Films]] in the United States in 1987.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=346}}\n\nThe Criterion Collection prepared a 4K restoration of ''Tampopo'' that was released in theatres in October 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4268-tampopo-s-delicious-return-to-theaters|title=Tampopo's Delicious Return to Theaters|newspaper=The Criterion Collection|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Critical response ===\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four out of four stars, commenting that \"Like the French comedies of [[Jacques Tati]], it's a bemused meditation on human nature in which one humorous situation flows into another offhandedly, as if life were a series of smiles.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tampopo-1987 |title=''Tampopo'' Review |author=Ebert, Roger |author-link= Roger Ebert |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date= 1987-09-11 |access-date=2020-05-05}}</ref>\n\nHal Hinson of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, \"The movie, which Itami calls a 'noodle western,' is a rambunctious mixture of the bawdy and the sublime.\"<ref name=Post>{{cite news |title='Tampopo' (NR) |author=Hinson, Hal |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date= June 17, 1987 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/tampoponrhinson_a0c94d.htm}}</ref> \"'Tampopo' is perhaps the funniest movie about the connection between food and sex ever made.\"<ref name=Post/>\n\n[[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnston]] writing in ''[[Time Out New York]]'' commented: \"This film is his broadest comedy by far, and its principal subjects are those great global constants, food and sex.
