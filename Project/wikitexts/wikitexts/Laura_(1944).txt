It stars [[Gene Tierney]], [[Dana Andrews]], and [[Clifton Webb]] along with [[Vincent Price]] and [[Judith Anderson]]. The screenplay by [[Jay Dratler]], [[Samuel Hoffenstein]], and [[Elizabeth Reinhardt|Betty Reinhardt]] is based on the 1943 novel ''[[Laura (novel)|Laura]]'' by [[Vera Caspary]].  ''Laura'' received five nominations for the Academy Awards, including for Best Director, winning for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Black and White Cinematography]].\n\nIn 1999, ''Laura'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-11-23|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Preserving the Silver Screen (December 1999) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9912/nfb.html|access-date=2020-11-23|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref> The American Film Institute named it one of the [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Mystery|10 best mystery films]] of all time, and it also appears on [[Roger Ebert]]'s \"Great Movies\" series.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Laura|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-laura-1944|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|access-date=November 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Laura (1944) - Trailer.webm|thumb|right|upright=1.2|thumbtime=2:27|[[:C:File:Laura (1944) - Trailer.webm|Trailer]] for ''Laura'']]\n\n[[New York City Police Department]] detective Mark McPherson is investigating the murder of a young, beautiful, highly successful advertising executive, Laura Hunt, killed by a shotgun blast to the face just inside the doorway of her apartment.\n\nHe first interviews charismatic newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, an imperious, effete older man who relates how he met Laura and became her mentor.  She had become his platonic friend and steady companion, and, wishing more, he used his considerable fame, influence, and connections to advance her career.\n\nMcPherson also questions Laura's parasitic playboy fianc\u00e9, Shelby Carpenter, a \"kept man\"  tethered to her wealthy socialite aunt, Ann Treadwell.  Treadwell is tolerant of her Shelby's infatuation with Hunt, apparently out of her practical acceptance of Carpenter's need for the affection of a woman closer to his own age.\n\nBessie Clary, Laura's loyal and highly distraught housekeeper, is also questioned by McPherson.\n\nThrough the testimony of Laura's friends and reading through her letters and diary McPherson becomes obsessed with her \u2013 so much so that Lydecker finally accuses him of falling in love with the dead woman. He also learns that Lydecker was jealous of Laura's suitors, using his newspaper column and influence to keep them at bay.\n\nOne night, the detective falls asleep in Laura's apartment in front of her portrait. He is awakened by a woman entering with her own key, and is shocked that it is Laura. She finds a dress in her closet that had belonged to one of her models, Diane Redfern. McPherson concludes that the body assumed to have been Laura was in fact Redfern, drawn there for a liaison by Carpenter while Laura was away in the country. Now, with Laura still alive, unmasking the killer becomes even more urgent.\n\nAt a party celebrating Laura's return McPherson arrests Laura for the murder of Redfern. Upon questioning her, he becomes convinced both that she is innocent and that she does not love Carpenter. He goes to search Lydecker's apartment, where he becomes suspicious of a clock that is identical to the one in Laura's apartment. On closer examination, he finds it has a secret compartment.\n\nMcPherson returns to Laura's apartment. Lydecker is there and notices a growing bond between Laura and the detective. Lydecker insults McPherson and is sent away by Laura, but pauses on the stairwell outside. McPherson examines Laura's clock and finds the shotgun that killed Diane, but leaves it there. Laura is confronted with the truth that Lydecker is the murderer.\n\nMcPherson and Laura kiss, then he locks her into her apartment, warning her to admit no one. After he leaves, Lydecker, who had slipped in, retrieves the shotgun, emerges from another room and attempts to kill Laura, saying that if he cannot have her no one can. She deflects his shot and flees just as McPherson arrives, and Lydecker is shot down by McPherson's sergeant. Waldo's last words are: \"Goodbye, Laura. Goodbye, my love.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Gene Tierney]] as Laura Hunt\n* [[Dana Andrews]] as Mark McPherson\n* [[Clifton Webb]] as Waldo Lydecker\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Shelby Carpenter\n* [[Judith Anderson]] as Ann Treadwell\n* [[Dorothy Adams]] as Bessie Clary, Laura's Maid (uncredited)\n* [[Ralph Dunn]] as Fred Callahan (uncredited)\n* [[Clyde Fillmore]] as Owner of Bullitt & Co.

Preminger liked the high-society setting and the unusual plot twist, but he felt the work needed a major revision and offered to rewrite it with its author. Caspary and he  disagreed about the direction they should take it, and she opted to collaborate with writer George Sklar, instead. [[Marlene Dietrich]] expressed interest in portraying the title character, but without the attachment of Dietrich or another major star, Caspary was unable to find a producer willing to finance a national tour or a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run, and abandoned the project.{{sfn|Hirsch|p=94\u201396}}\n\nCaspary eventually adapted the play for both a novel with the same title and a sequel, which she titled simply ''Laura''. They were both purchased by [[20th Century Fox]] for $30,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=LOOKING BACKWARD AT THE 1943\u201344 SEASON: Being a Summary and Many Figures of the Year's Activities|date=June 4, 1944|work=New York Times|page=X1}}</ref> Fox announced [[George Sanders]] and [[Laird Cregar]] as the leads.<ref>{{cite news|title=SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOOD: Fox Buys Rights to 'Laura,' a Mystery, for Laird Cregar and George Sanders 'GUADALAJARA' AT WORLD Mexican Film Will Open Today -- 'The Russian Story' Sets Record at the Stanley|work=New York Times|date=June 11, 1943|page=23}}</ref>\n\nInterim studio head [[William Goetz]], serving in that capacity while [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] was fulfilling his military duty, assigned Preminger the task of developing the books for the screen. Preminger began working with Jay Dratler, Samuel Hoffenstein, and Betty Reinhardt. Recalling the differences of opinion  Caspary and he had, Preminger opted not to involve her until the first draft was completed. He sensed the more interesting character was not Laura, but Waldo Lydecker, and expanded his role accordingly.  Caspary was unhappy with the plot changes, though.{{sfn|Hirsch|p=96\u201397}}\n\nZanuck, with whom Preminger previously had clashed, returned to the studio and was angered to discover Goetz had rehired his nemesis. In retaliation, he announced that Preminger could produce ''Laura'' but not direct it, and assigned him to helm ''[[In the Meantime, Darling]]'' instead. Several directors, including [[Lewis Milestone]], were offered and rejected ''Laura'' until [[Rouben Mamoulian]] finally agreed to direct.\n\nMamoulian immediately ignored all of Preminger's directives as producer and began to rewrite the script. To Preminger's dismay, he cast Laird Cregar, known for his portrayal of [[Jack the Ripper]] in ''[[The Lodger (1944 film)|The Lodger]]'', in the key role of Lydecker. The producer felt casting an actor with a reputation for playing sinister roles would lead the audience to become suspicious of Lydecker earlier than necessary. He favored [[Clifton Webb]], a noted Broadway actor, who had not appeared before the cameras since 1930, and who at that time was performing in the [[No\u00ebl Coward]] play ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' in Los Angeles.\n\nFox casting director Rufus LeMaire and Zanuck both objected to Webb because of his effeminate mannerisms, which were exactly what Preminger felt suited the character. Preminger filmed the actor delivering a monologue from the Coward play, and Zanuck agreed that Webb was perfect for the role.{{sfn|Hirsch|p=102\u2013103}} Zanuck was similarly campaigning for actor [[Reginald Gardiner]] to play the role of Shelby, though Fox contractee Vincent Price finally got the role.\n\nFilming began on April 27, 1944, and from the start, Mamoulian had problems with his cast. He offered relative newcomers Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews little support, allowed theatrically trained Judith Anderson to play to the balcony instead of reining in her performance, and virtually ignored Webb, who had learned that the director was unhappy with his casting.\n\nAfter viewing the early rushes, Zanuck called a meeting with Mamoulian and Preminger, each of whom blamed the other for the problems on the set. Preminger finally convinced Zanuck that the material needed a more subtle approach than Mamoulian was willing to give it, and the defeated studio head, in frustration, reluctantly allowed Preminger to dismiss Mamoulian and direct the film himself. Preminger immediately hired a new cinematographer and scenic designer and replaced the portrait of Laura&nbsp;\u2013 a crucial element of the film; Mamoulian's wife Azadia had painted the original portrait, but Preminger replaced that with an enlarged photograph (taken by Fox photographer Frank Polony) of Tierney, lightly dabbed with oils to give it the ethereal effect he wanted.<ref>Tierney Autobiography \u2013 'Self Portrait', pp.&nbsp;121\u2013122</ref>\n\nPreminger initially experienced resistance from his cast, who had been led to believe Preminger was unhappy with their work by the departing Mamoulian. \"Once we got used to Otto, we had a pretty easy time\", Vincent Price recalled in a July 1989 interview. Filming was completed on June 29, slightly over budget, but within the projected timetable.{{sfn|Hirsch|p=105\u2013106}}\n\nZanuck was unhappy with Preminger's first cut of the film and insisted it be given a new ending, in which it was revealed Lydecker had imagined the entire story, but following a screening of the Zanuck version, columnist [[Walter Winchell]] approached the studio head and told him, \"I didn't get [the ending]. You've got to change it.\" Having lost again, Zanuck relented and allowed Preminger to reinstate his original finale, telling him, \"This is your success. I concede.\"{{sfn|Hirsch|p=107}}\n\n===Music===\nOnce the principal photography had been completed, Preminger hired [[David Raksin]] to score the film. The director wanted to use \"[[Sophisticated Lady]]\" by [[Duke Ellington]] for the main theme, but Raksin objected to the choice. [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], music director for Fox, convinced Preminger to give Raksin a weekend to compose an original tune. Furious, Preminger gave Raksin that weekend, but threatened him with dismissal in case he failed.\n\nInspired by a [[Dear John letter|\"Dear John\" letter]] he received from his wife over the course of that weekend, Raksin composed the haunting theme, also titled \"[[Laura (1945 song)|Laura]]\",{{sfn|Hirsch|p=106\u2013107}} for which [[Johnny Mercer]] later wrote lyrics. It eventually became a jazz standard recorded by more than 400 artists, including [[Stan Kenton]], [[Dick Haymes]], [[Woody Herman]], [[Nat King Cole]], The [[Four Freshmen]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Billy Eckstine]], and [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p116734/songs/songs-composed-by|pure_url=yes}} David Raksin at AllMusic.com]</ref> Even [[Spike Jones]] did a parody version of the song. Preminger was so pleased with Raksin's score that he not only did not dismiss Raksin, but also collaborated with him on four additional films.{{sfn|Hirsch|p=107}}\n\n===Soundtrack===\nIn 1993, [[Fox Records]] released a 27-minute suite of Raksin's score on an album paired with [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]].'' In 2013, Kritzerland released the complete Raksin score, along with test demos and the suite from the original album as bonus tracks.\n\nTrack listing:\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n# \"Main Title\" (02:18)\n# \"The Phonograph\" (00:25)\n# \"The Caf\u00e9\" (04:06)\n# \"Waldo Walks Away\" (01:01)\n# \"Theatre Lobby\" (01:27)\n# \"Night\" (03:05)\n# \"The Caf\u00e9/Waldo's Apartment\" (04:14)\n# \"Laura Leaves\" (00:59)\n# \"The Portrait\" (03:23)\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n# \"Mark\" (01:05)\n# \"Apartment House\" (01:21)\n# \"Radio\" (01:24)\n# \"The Party\" (03:41)\n# \"Outside Waldo's Door\" (01:27)\n# \"Waldo\" (04:30)\n# \"End Title\" (01:23)\n# \"Laura Theme \u2013 Test Demos\" (01:44)\n# \"The Laura Suite \u2013 Theme and Variations\" (27:20)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThomas M. Pryor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed:\n\n{{blockquote|When a murder mystery possessing as much sustained suspense, good acting and caustically brittle dialogue as ''Laura'' ...&nbsp;comes along it might seem a little like carping to suggest that it could have been even better. As the story of a strangely fascinating female who insinuates herself into the lives of three very worldly gents, much depends, of course, upon the lady herself&nbsp;... Now, at the risk of being unchivalrous, we venture to say that when the lady herself appears upon the scene via a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of events leading up to the tragedy, she is a disappointment. For Gene Tierney simply doesn't measure up to the word-portrait of her character. Pretty, indeed, but hardly the type of girl we had expected to meet. For Miss Tierney plays at being a brilliant and sophisticated advertising executive with the wild-eyed innocence of a college junior. Aside from that principal reservation, however, ''Laura'' is an intriguing [[melodrama]]&nbsp;... Only Miss Tierney seems out of key. Perhaps if Laura Hunt had not had such a build-up, it would have been different. Anyway, the picture on the whole is close to being a top-drawer mystery.<ref>{{cite web |author1=T.M.P. |title=At the Roxy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1944/10/12/archives/at-the-roxy.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 12, 2020 |date=October 12, 1944|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711123615/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F05EEDE1E31E03BBC4A52DFB667838F659EDE|archive-date=July 11, 2012|url-status=live }}</ref>}}\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said:\n\n{{blockquote|The film's deceptively leisurely pace at the start, and its light, careless air, only heighten the suspense without the audience being conscious of the buildup.

[T]he whole film is of a piece: contrived, artificial, mannered, and yet achieving a kind of perfection in its balance between low motives and high style. What makes the movie great, perhaps, is the casting.

Four of the five radio adaptations were included as extras on the disc (with the 1950 episode of The Screen Guild Theater omitted).\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Radio===\n''Laura'' was adapted as a radio play for two different episodes of ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', the first starring Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, and Vincent Price (February 5, 1945), and the second starring Gene Tierney and [[Victor Mature]] (February 1, 1954). It was also adapted for the May 30, 1948, broadcast of ''[[Ford Theatre]]'' with [[Virginia Gilmore]] and [[John Larkin (radio and television actor)|John Larkin]]. In addition, ''Laura'' was presented twice on ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' (August 20, 1945, and February 23, 1950), both episodes starring Gene Tierney,  Dana Andrews, and Clifton Webb.\n\n===Television===\nIn 1955, the movie was remade as a presentation of the drama anthology series ''[[The 20th Century Fox Hour]]'', starring [[Dana Wynter]] in the title role.  [[Robert Stack]] played McPherson and [[George Sanders]] played Lydecker.  The director was [[John Brahm]].  The script was written by [[Mel Dinelli]].\n\n''Laura'' was also adapted for [[Laura (1968 film)|a television production]] produced by [[David Susskind]], aired on January 24, 1968, starring [[Lee Radziwi\u0142\u0142]] in Gene Tierney's part.  Sanders returned in Clifton Webb's role, and Stack in Dana Andrews's. The show was taped in London and the teleplay was written by [[Truman Capote]]. It met with unanimous negative reactions, which was attributed to Radziwi\u0142\u0142's poor acting.{{sfn|Clarke|p=388\u2013389}}\n\nAn episode of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' titled \"Skin Deep\", written by joint series creator [[Donald P. Bellisario]], used a similar premise. [[Ian McShane]] guested as the Lydecker type, an insanely jealous film producer, and [[Cathie Shirriff]] guest-starred as the episode's version of Laura Hunt, the prominent actress Erin Wolfe, whose apparent suicide investigator Magnum ([[Tom Selleck]]) is investigating. As McPherson does in ''Laura'', Magnum learns that, in reality, his investigation subject is not dead. ''[[Cold Case]]'' does the same thing but with a gender reversal in the season 3 finale, titled \"Joseph\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n\nAn episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' titled \"[[Aquiel]]\" was likewise inspired by ''Laura''. In one early draft of the murder mystery episode, the writers struggled with the fact that their initial solution for the mystery seemed too close to the plot of ''[[Basic Instinct]]''. Producer [[Michael Piller]] suggested they instead look to ''Laura'' as a blueprint. The script was adjusted accordingly, featuring a character in a detective role falling in love with a supposed murder victim through her personal logs, only to discover that she was, in fact, alive.<ref name=torreview>{{cite web|last1=DeCandido|first1=Keith|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Rewatch: \"Aquiel\"|url=https://www.tor.com/2012/10/31/star-trek-the-next-generation-rewatch-aqiuel/comment-page-2/|publisher=Tor.com|access-date=November 2, 2021|date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nIn 2005, a [[Bollywood]] remake titled ''[[Rog]]'' was released, directed by Himanshu Brahmbhatt and starring [[Irrfan Khan]] and [[Ilene Hamann]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1944]]\n\n==References==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=Otto Preminger: The Man Who Would Be King|last=Hirsch|first=Foster|publisher=Alfred A.
