On Christmas Eve Jim prepares for his final performance before retiring to marriage with Lila and life on a farm in [[Connecticut]]. Lila tells Jim she has fallen in love with the notorious charmer Ted instead; heartbroken, Jim bids them goodbye.\n\nHe tries to make a go of working the farm but ends up in a sanitarium instead.  The following Christmas Eve Jim is back in New York City with plans to turn his farm into \"Holiday Inn,\" an entertainment venue open only on holidays, to the amusement of Ted and his agent Danny Reed. In a flower shop Danny is pitched by sales girl and aspiring performer Linda Mason; he steers her to Holiday Inn and Ted's club. Later that night Linda and Jim accidentally meet at a performance by Ted and Lila.  Jim pretends to own a rival club, while Linda postures as a celebrity friend of Ted's, only to flee when Ted and Lila approach.\n\nOn Christmas Day Linda arrives at Holiday Inn and meets Jim, the pair immediately realizing their deception. Jim sings her his new song, \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\".\n\nOn New Year's Eve Holiday Inn opens to a packed house. Back in New York City Ted learns that Lila is leaving him for a Texas millionaire. Drinking heavily, he arrives at Holiday Inn at midnight and literally stumbles into Linda. They dance, and the inebriated hoofer and guileless ingenue bring down the house together - which believes it all to be a polished act. Danny arrives and is ecstatic that Ted has found a new partner, but in the morning Ted does not remember Linda. Jim hides her, afraid Ted will steal her away.\n\nOn [[Lincoln's Birthday]] Ted and Danny search for Linda, but Jim convinces Linda to play the [[minstrel show]] number \"Abraham\" in [[blackface]] together to foil them. While applying Linda's makeup Jim asks her to stay there with him between holidays, which she interprets as a proposal. He affirms it, but equivocates that only when he can afford to.  Leaving empty-handed, Ted and Danny plan to return.\n\nRehearsing for [[Valentine's Day]] Jim presents Linda with a new song, \"Be Careful, It's My Heart\". Ted arrives and launches into an impromptu dance with Linda. Recognizing her from New Year's Eve, he demands that Jim prepare them a number to perform in the next show.\n\nOn [[Washington's Birthday]] Ted and Linda dance in elaborate 18th century period costumes, with Jim sabotaging their tempo from a [[minuet]] to [[jazz]] throughout. Linda refuses Ted's offer to become his dance partner, saying that she and Jim are to be married. When Ted asks him about the engagement Jim plays it off, but Ted is unconvinced.\n\nAt Easter romance blossoms between Jim and Linda. They are met by Ted, who asks to remain in Jim's shows to experience \"the true happiness\" they have found. Linda is charmed, but Jim is suspicious.\n\nJim's apprehensions are confirmed on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], when he overhears Ted and Danny's caballing over a pair of Hollywood representatives using that night's show to audition Ted and Linda for motion pictures. Jim bribes teamster Gus to stall Linda, who ends up driving the pair into a creek.  Linda gets picked up on the roadside by Lila. Having left the penniless \"millionaire\", she crows that she will be Ted's partner that night for the studio tryout. Assuming that Jim made the switch to keep her from leaving, Linda directs Lila into the creek.\n\nAt the inn Ted is forced to improvise solo, which he does with a spectacular fireworks-studded tapdance routine. Linda arrives, irritated that Jim did not trust her to make her own decision.  She joins Ted, Hollywood bound. Jim reluctantly agrees to let the eager producers make a film about Holiday Inn, but vows not to leave the Inn.\n\n[[Thanksgiving]] finds the Inn closed and Jim saturated in self-pity. As he prepares to mail off his new song his housekeeper Mamie implores him to fight to win Linda back.\n\nJim arrives in California on Christmas Eve, just as Ted and Linda plan to marry. Jim confronts Ted in his dressing room, gets locked in, then turns the table on Ted and Danny. On the set of Linda's movie, a meticulous recreation of Holiday Inn, Jim leaves his pipe on the piano and hides as Linda enters and performs \"White Christmas\". Reflexively ringing tiny bells with it as he did, she falters, then continues waveringly as Jim's voice joins her. Jim appears and Linda runs to him as the director yells, \"Cut!\"\n\nBack at Holiday Inn on New Year's Eve Ted is reunited with Lila, and Jim and Linda sing a duet, affirming their love.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bing Crosby]] as Jim Hardy \n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Ted Hanover \n* [[Marjorie Reynolds]] as Linda Mason\n* [[Walter Abel]] as Danny Reed\n* [[Virginia Dale]] as Lila Dixon\n* [[Louise Beavers]] as Mamie \n* [[Irving Bacon]] as Gus \n* [[Leon Belasco]] as flower store manager\n* Marek Windheim as Fran\u00e7ois \n* [[James Bell (actor)|James Bell]] as Dunbar (from Hollywood)\n* [[John Gallaudet]] as Parker (from Hollywood)\n* Shelby Bacon as Vanderbilt\n* Joan Arnold as Daphne\n* [[Harry Barris]] as musician\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn May 1940, [[Irving Berlin]] signed an exclusive contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] to write songs for a [[musical film]] based on his idea of an [[inn]] that opened only on public holidays. Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire were the stars of ''Holiday Inn'' with support from [[Marjorie Reynolds]] and [[Virginia Dale (actress)|Virginia Dale]]. Filming took place between November 18, 1941, and January 30, 1942. Produced and directed by Mark Sandrich, ''Holiday Inn'' had its premiere at the New York City [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]] August 4, 1942.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rainho|first1=Manny|title=This Month in Movie History|journal=Classic Images|date=August 2015|issue=482|pages=24\u201326}}</ref> It was a success in the US and the UK, the highest-grossing film musical to that time. It was expected that \"Be Careful, It's My Heart\" would be the hit song. While it did very well, \"White Christmas\" topped the charts in October 1942 instead, and stayed there for eleven weeks. Another Berlin song, \"[[Happy Holiday (song)|Happy Holiday]]\", is featured over the opening credits and within the film storyline.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nFilming outside the studio occurred at the Village Inn Resort in [[Monte Rio, California|Monte Rio]] on the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]], in [[Sonoma County, California]].<ref name=\"imdblocations\">{{cite web|title=Locations for Holiday Inn |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034862/locations |access-date=September 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany segments of the film are preceded by shots of a calendar with a visual symbol of the given holiday. For November, an animated turkey is shown running back and forth between the third and fourth Thursdays, finally shrugging its shoulders in confusion. This is a satirical reference to the \"[[Franksgiving]]\" controversy created when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] tried to expand the Christmas shopping season by declaring Thanksgiving a week earlier than before, leading to Congress setting Thanksgiving as the fourth Thursday in November by law.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}\n\nThe [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in Hawaii occurred halfway through filming. As a result, the Fourth of July segment was expanded beyond Fred Astaire's firecracker dance to include the patriotic number that highlights the strength of the US military.<ref name=\"carl-leonard-wc\">{{cite web|title=Bing Crosby recorded Irving Berlin's song \"White Christmas\" today in 1942. |publisher=Carl Leonard |url=http://carl-leonard.com/2014/05/bing-crosby-recorded-irving-berlins-song-white-christmas-today-in-1942-historiographer-nowweknowem/ |access-date=July 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===\"White Christmas\"===\n{{Main|White Christmas (song)}}\n[[File:Bing Crosby - White Christmas 1942 10 inch.jpg|thumb|\"White Christmas\" (Decca Records 1942)]]\n\nThe song that would become \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\" was conceived by Berlin on the set of the film ''[[Top Hat]]'' in 1935. He hummed the melody to Astaire and the film's director [[Mark Sandrich]] as a song possibility for a future Astaire-[[Ginger Rogers]] vehicle. Astaire loved the tune, but Sandrich passed on it. Berlin's assignment for Paramount was to write a song about each of the major holidays of the year. He found that writing a song about Christmas was the most challenging, due to his Jewish upbringing.<ref name=\"WhiteChristmasHymnsAndCarols\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/white_christmas.htm|title=White Christmas|website=www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com}}</ref> When Crosby first heard Berlin play \"White Christmas\" in 1941 at the first rehearsals, he did not immediately recognize its full potential. Crosby simply said: \"I don't think we have any problems with that one, Irving.\"\n\nAlthough \"White Christmas\" has become iconic, this was not the original intention. The song \"Be Careful, It's My Heart\", played during the Valentine's Day section of the film, was originally intended to be a bigger hit when production of ''Holiday Inn'' commenced.\n\nThe song is used during the Christmas holiday sections of the movie, most notably when it is introduced to Linda Mason (Reynolds) by Jim Hardy (Crosby) while she is trying to obtain a position in the shows at the inn. Hardy begins playing the song to her allowing her to join him and eventually perform solo. The song is also reprised near the end of the movie.
