The film depicts three generations of a [[Mexican American]] family who emigrated from [[Mexico]] and settled in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]].<ref>{{AFI film|id=60033|title=My Family}}.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is narrated by the family's oldest son, Paco. The film begins with the father of the family, Jos\u00e9 Sanchez, making a journey that lasts one year on foot from Mexico to [[Los Angeles]]. He travels to Los Angeles to meet a distant relative known as ''El Californio,'' who was born in the city when it was still part of Mexico. They become fast friends and grow a corn farm together. However, after several years, ''El Californio'' nears death. Shortly before dying, ''El Californio'' says he wants the following written on his [[tombstone]]:\n:When I was born here, this was Mexico, and where my body lies, this is still Mexico.\n\nJos\u00e9 meets and marries the love of his life, Mar\u00eda, an American [[citizen]]. After Mar\u00eda is illegally deported to Mexico by the U.S. [[federal government]] in a [[Operation Wetback|mass roundup]], she makes it back to [[Los Angeles]] via a long and arduous trip two years later, where she returns home with their new son Chucho.\n\nTwenty years later in 1958 or 1959, eldest daughter Irene is getting married. Chucho and Paco have grown up. New additions to the family include Toni, Guillermo \"Memo\", and brother Jimmy.\n\nThe film begins to gain momentum after the wedding, when a series of events seal Chucho's fate. One night at a dance hall, Chucho is dancing with his girlfriend, when his rival Butch Mejia starts to bother him. This results in a bloody knife fight between the two, and Chucho accidentally kills him. After this event, Chucho becomes a fugitive of the police. One night when Jimmy is playing ball with his friends, Chucho is shot dead by the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] right in front of Jimmy. Other members of the family learn of Chucho's death when they hear gunshots and rush to a nearby street. As an ambulance arrives to take Chucho's lifeless body away, Paco narrates how Chucho's whole life had been on borrowed time.\n\nThe third generation, which takes place another twenty years later in the 1970s and 80s, faces situations such as [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], and past problems of the family.\n\nJimmy completes a stint in prison and returns home. It is revealed that after Chucho's death 20 years back, Jimmy became an angry man following in his footsteps, becoming a fugitive like him. One day, Toni visits the Sanchez home and stuns her parents with the news that she is no longer a nun and has married a priest named David Ronconi. Toni and David become involved in helping political refugees. When they find out that a Salvadoran refugee, Isabel, has become a target for murder and is being held for deportation back to El Salvador, Toni convinces Jimmy to marry her so that she is able to stay in the U.S.\n\nJimmy is resistant to the idea of being a married man; however, Isabel slowly makes herself at home and Jimmy has no choice but to let her stay with him. As Jimmy works on his car listening to \"[[I'm Your Puppet]]\", Isabel comes up to him and changes the music in the cassette-player. She tries to get him to dance with her on the street. At first he doesn't want to, but she finally succeeds in teaching him some steps. He asks her at the end of the song, \"Will you teach me how to salsa?\" It is here that Jimmy finally lets Isabel into his heart and where they both understand that although other people don't understand them, they know now who they really are together and they finally [[consummate]] their marriage.\n\nIsabel becomes pregnant shortly thereafter but unfortunately dies after giving birth to their son, Carlitos. Enraged, Jimmy attacks the doctor whom he blames for her death, burglarizes a store, and is jailed, leaving his son to be raised by his parents. When Jimmy gets out of prison 4 years later, he initially doesn't want anything to do with his son, who is a spirited, but trouble-making child. When Jimmy finally sees his son, he is filled with joy and immediately wants to care for him. However, his son hates him, who thinks his real father is a cattle rancher who lives in Texas. After Jimmy decides to change his life around for the good of his son, Carlitos accepts him and moves with him to Texas where Jimmy has secured a good-paying manufacturing job in [[San Antonio]].\n\nThe film concludes with Jose and Maria, now [[empty nester]]s reminiscing about their past as Jose says \"God has been good to us, we've been very lucky, and our life it has been very...very good\" and the camera pans to a shot of Los Angeles.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=85%}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Jimmy Smits]] as Jimmy S\u00e1nchez\n** Jonathan Hernandez as Young Jimmy S\u00e1nchez\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as Paco S\u00e1nchez\n** [[Benito Martinez (actor)|Benito Martinez]] as Young Paco S\u00e1nchez\n* [[Esai Morales]] as Jesus \"Chucho\" S\u00e1nchez<!--Reference: movie.

The film has a 79% \"Fresh\" rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 57 reviews from professional critics, with an average rating of 7.3/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=My Family (1995)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_family/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|access-date=August 26, 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]], film critic for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' liked the direction of the film, and wrote, \"Their story is told in images of startling beauty and great overflowing energy; it is rare to hear so much laughter from an audience that is also sometimes moved to tears. Few movies like this get made because few filmmakers have the ambition to open their arms wide and embrace so much life.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950503/REVIEWS/505030301/1023 Ebert, Roger]. ''Chicago Sun-Times,'' film review, May 3, 1995.</ref>\n\nFilm critics Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, who write for the web based ''Spirituality and Practice,'' liked the film, the acting and the direction of the film. They wrote, \"My Family is a touching and often mystical portrait of a multi-generational Mexican-American family in East Los Angeles...Director Gregory Nava (''[[El Norte (film)|El Norte]]'') does a fine job orchestrating the many events in this emotionally resonant drama.\"<ref>[http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/films.php?id=4983 Brussat, Frederic and Mary Ann]. Spirituality and Practice, film review. Last accessed: December 8, 2007.</ref>\n\nBut not all were so kind. Caryn James, in a film review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote the film was \"wildly uneven\" and \"offers a trite, overblown narration by [[Edward James Olmos]] and an often flagging sense of drama.\"  She was also not happy with Nava's direction and wrote, \"[Nava] seems so enamored of the texture of [[Mexican-American]] life that he glides past any sense of character.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE5D6163CF930A35756C0A963958260 James, Caryn].
