It is the third installment in the [[Indiana Jones|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]] and a sequel to ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981). [[Harrison Ford]] returned in [[Indiana Jones (character)|the title role]], while [[Henry Jones, Sr.|his father]] is portrayed by [[Sean Connery]]. Other cast members featured include [[Alison Doody]], [[Denholm Elliott]], [[Julian Glover]], [[River Phoenix]], and [[John Rhys-Davies]]. In the film, set largely in 1938, Indiana searches for his father, a [[Holy Grail]] scholar, who has been kidnapped and held hostage by the [[Nazis]] while on a journey to find the Holy Grail.\n\nAfter the mixed reaction to ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', Spielberg chose to lower the dark tone and graphic violence in the next installment. During the five years between ''The Temple of Doom'' and ''The Last Crusade'', he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting [[Jeffrey Boam]]'s. Filming locations included [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[West Germany]], [[Jordan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/67198 |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |title=''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' |access-date=September 21, 2018 |archive-date=August 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829211114/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/67198 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''The Last Crusade'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in North America on May 24, 1989, and was a financial success, earning $475.8 million at the worldwide box office, and won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]]. A sequel, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', followed in 2008.  A fifth film is scheduled for release in Summer 2023.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1912, 13-year-old [[Indiana Jones (character)|Henry \"Indiana\" Jones, Jr.]], is horseback riding with his [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] troop at [[Arches National Park]] in [[Utah]]. While scouting caves, Indiana discovers a group of grave robbers who have found a golden [[crucifix]] belonging to [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado]] and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum. The men give chase through a passing [[circus train]], leaving Indiana with a bloody cut across his chin from a [[bullwhip]] and a new [[Ophidiophobia|phobia of snakes]]. Indiana escapes, but the local sheriff makes him return the cross to the robbers, who immediately turn it over to a mysterious benefactor wearing a [[Panama hat]]. Impressed with the boy's bravery, [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Garth|the leader of the robbers]] gives Indiana his fedora.\n\n26 years later, in 1938, Indiana Jones fights \"[[List of Indiana Jones characters#Panama Hat|Panama Hat]]\" and his henchmen on a ship off the coast of [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]]. Escaping overboard just before the ship explodes, he recovers the cross and donates it to [[Marcus Brody]]'s museum. Later, Indiana learns from [[Walter Donovan]] that his father, [[Henry Jones, Sr.]], was searching for the [[Holy Grail]] using an incomplete inscription from a stone tablet as a guide and has since vanished. Indiana receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from [[Venice]] and heads there with Marcus, where they meet Henry's [[Austrians|Austrian]] colleague, Dr. [[Elsa Schneider]].\n\nBeneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indiana and Elsa discover a set of half-flooded catacombs that house the tomb of a [[First Crusade]] knight that contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, revealing the location of the Grail. They flee when the [[petroleum]]-saturated waters of the catacombs are set on fire by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a [[secret society]] whose mission is to protect the Grail. Indiana and Elsa capture Brotherhood member [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Kazim|Kazim]]. When Indiana explains that his only goal is to find his father, not the Grail, Kazim tells them Henry's location. Looking through the diary, Marcus finds a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in the ancient city of Alexandretta. Indiana removes the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for safekeeping, and sends him to [[\u0130skenderun]], the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta, to rendezvous with their old friend [[Sallah]]. Elsa begins a relationship with Indiana before they depart to find Henry.\n\nIndiana and Elsa head to Castle Brunwald, a [[Nazi German|Nazi]]-controlled castle in [[Austria under National Socialism|Austria]], where Henry is being held. Indiana finds Henry and frees him only to be quickly captured by SS Colonel [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Vogel|Ernst Vogel]]. He learns that Elsa is a Nazi, and Donovan is working with them. They are using the Joneses to find the Grail for them. Elsa kisses Indiana goodbye as she departs with Donovan and Vogel. Marcus is captured in [[Hatay State]] while meeting with Sallah. After their escape from the castle, Henry tells Indiana that the Grail is guarded by three booby traps and his diary contains clues needed to pass them safely. Disguised as a German Army colonel, Indiana recovers the diary from Elsa, who claims she's merely acting as a double agent to keep the grail away from the Nazis, at a Nazi book burning rally in [[Berlin]] and comes face to face with [[Adolf Hitler]], who autographs the book without recognizing it or him. Indiana and Henry board a [[Zeppelin]] to leave Germany, but are discovered and forced to escape in its [[Parasite aircraft|parasite]] [[biplane]]. A [[dogfight]] with [[Luftwaffe]] fighters ensues; although Indiana and Henry are forced to crash-land, they survive and successfully bring down their pursuers.\n\nIn [[Hatay State|Hatay]], Sallah tells them of Marcus's abduction. The Nazis have been equipped by the [[Sultan]] of Hatay and are already moving toward the Grail's location, using the map possessed by Marcus. The Sultan trades a [[Rolls-Royce Phantom II]] for a vintage tank, based on the Mark VIII. Indiana, Henry, and Sallah find the Nazi expedition, which is ambushed by the Brotherhood. During the battle, Henry is captured by Vogel while attempting to rescue Marcus; Kazim and his comrades are killed. Indiana pursues the tank on horseback and, with the aid of Sallah, saves Henry and Marcus. He is caught up in a fight with Vogel, but escapes just before the tank goes over a cliff, sending Vogel to his death.\n\nIndiana, Henry, Marcus, and Sallah catch up with the surviving Nazis, led by Donovan and Elsa, who have found the temple in The Canyon of the Crescent Moon where the Holy Grail is kept but are unable to get past the first trap. Donovan shoots and mortally wounds Henry to force Indiana to risk his life in the traps to find the Grail and use its healing power to save his father. Using the information in the diary (and followed by Donovan and Elsa), Indiana safely overcomes the traps (which include fast-moving saw blades, a word puzzle, and a hidden bridge over a bottomless pit) and reaches the Grail's chamber, which is guarded by [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Grail Knight|a knight]]. The man has been kept alive for 700 years by the power of the Grail, which is hidden among dozens of false grails of various designs. The true Grail grants eternal life, while the false ones will kill anyone who drinks from them. Elsa selects an incorrect cup for Donovan, causing him to rapidly age and crumble to dust after drinking from it. Indiana correctly identifies a simple clay cup as the true Grail and drinks from it,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones |last1=Magnoli |first1=Anthony |last2=Wiseart |first2=Kristen |last3=Price |first3=Joanna |year=2008 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4165-6315-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/lostjournalofind0000rinz}}</ref> but the knight warns that it cannot be taken out of the temple, and that its guardian must stay within to remain immortal.\n\nIndiana fills the Grail with [[holy water]] and brings it to Henry, healing him instantly. Elsa disregards the knight's warning and tries to take the Grail with her, causing the temple to collapse around them when she crosses the Great Seal set in the floor at the entrance. When the Grail falls into a chasm in the floor, Elsa plummets to her death trying to recover it. Indiana nearly suffers the same fate before Henry persuades him to leave it. The Grail Knight bids them farewell as they escape. After leaving the temple, the Joneses, Marcus, and Sallah ride off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Indiana Jones characters}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]: The archaeologist professor and adventurer, who seeks to rescue his father and find the Holy Grail. Ford said he loved the idea of introducing Indiana's father because it allowed him to explore another side to Indiana's personality: \"These are men who have never made any accommodation to each other. Indy behaves differently in his father's presence. Who else would dare call Indy 'junior'?\"<ref name=hattrick/>\n** [[River Phoenix]] as a younger Indiana Jones. Phoenix had portrayed the son of Ford's character in ''[[The Mosquito Coast (film)|The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986).

Spielberg had Connery in mind when he suggested introducing Indiana's father, though he did not tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as \"a crazy, eccentric\" professor resembling [[Laurence Olivier]], whose relationship with Indiana is \"strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son\".<ref name=monkeyking/> Spielberg had been a fan of Connery's work as [[James Bond]] and felt that no one else could perform the role as well.<ref name=time/> Spielberg biographer [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]] wrote, \"Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery's [[Production of the James Bond films|''James Bond'' films]].\"<ref name=faber>McBride, \"An Awfully Big Adventure\", p. 379 \u2013 413</ref> [[Gregory Peck]] was also considered for the role.<ref name=making/> Connery initially turned the role down as he was only twelve years older than Ford, but he relented.

Although a non-speaking role, Sheard could speak German and had already portrayed Hitler three times during his career. He had also appeared as [[Admiral Ozzel]] in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and as Oskar Schomburg in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. In the same scene, [[Ronald Lacey]], who played [[Arnold Toht|Toht]] in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', cameos as [[Heinrich Himmler]]. [[Alexei Sayle]] played the sultan of Hatay. [[Paul Maxwell]] portrayed \"the man with the Panama Hat\" who took possession of the Cross of Coronado. Wrestler and stuntman [[Pat Roach]], who played three roles in the previous two films, made a short [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as the Nazi who accompanies Vogel to the Zeppelin. Roach was set to film a fight with Ford, but it was cut.

In September 1984, Lucas completed an eight-page treatment titled ''Indiana Jones and the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]]'', which he soon followed with an 11-page outline. The story saw Indiana battling a ghost in Scotland before finding the [[Fountain of Youth]] in Africa.<ref name=monkeyking>Rinzler, Bouzereau, \"The Monkey King: July 1984 to May 1988\", p. 184 - 203.</ref>\n\n[[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]\u2014who had written the Spielberg-produced ''[[Gremlins]]'', ''[[The Goonies]]'', and ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]''\u2014was hired to write the script. His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a [[Peaches of Immortality|Garden of Immortal Peaches]]. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to [[Mozambique]] to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a [[Katharine Hepburn]]-type according to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old [[pygmies|pygmy]]. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier\u2014an old friend of Indiana\u2014travel up the [[Zambezi]] river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]]. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a [[Toshiro Mifune]]-type), who dies eating a peach because he is not pure of heart.<ref name=monkeyking/>\n\nColumbus's second draft, dated August 6, 1985, removed Betsy and featured Dash\u2014an [[expatriate]] bar owner for whom the Nazis work\u2014and the Monkey King as villains. The Monkey King forces Indiana and Dash to play chess with real people and disintegrates each person who is [[Capture (chess)|captured]]. Indiana subsequently battles the undead, destroys [[Ruyi Jingu Bang|the Monkey King's rod]], and marries Clare.<ref name=monkeyking/> [[Location scouting]] commenced in Africa but Spielberg and Lucas abandoned ''Monkey King'' because of its negative depiction of African natives,<ref>McBride, p.318</ref> and because the script was too unrealistic.<ref name=monkeyking/> Spielberg acknowledged that it made him \"... feel very old, too old to direct it.\"<ref name=hattrick/> Columbus's script was leaked onto the Internet in 1997, and many believed it was an early draft for [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|the fourth film]] because it was mistakenly dated to 1995.<ref>{{cite news |author=David Hughes |title=The Long Strange Journey of Indiana Jones IV |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=November 2005 |page=131}}</ref>\n\nDissatisfied, Spielberg suggested introducing Indiana's father, [[Henry Jones, Sr.]] Lucas was dubious, believing the Grail should be the story's focus, but Spielberg convinced him that the father\u2013son relationship would serve as a great metaphor in Indiana's search for the artifact.<ref name=faber/> Spielberg hired [[Menno Meyjes]], who had worked on Spielberg's ''[[The Color Purple (1985 film)|The Color Purple]]'' and ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', to begin a new script on January 1, 1986. Meyjes completed his script ten months later. It depicted Indiana searching for his father in [[Monts\u00e9gur]], where he meets a nun named Chantal. Indiana travels to [[Venice]], takes the ''[[Orient Express]]'' to [[Istanbul]], and continues by train to [[Petra]], where he meets [[Sallah]] and reunites with his father. Together they find the grail. At the climax, a Nazi villain touches the Grail and explodes; when Henry touches it, he ascends a stairway to [[Heaven]]. Chantal chooses to stay on Earth because of her love for Indiana. In a revised draft dated two months later, Indiana finds his father in [[Krak des Chevaliers]], the Nazi leader is a woman named Greta von Grimm, and Indiana battles a demon at the Grail site, which he defeats with a dagger inscribed with \"God is King\".

Boam spent two weeks reworking the story with Lucas, which yielded a treatment that is largely similar to the final film.<ref name=monkeyking/> Boam told Lucas that Indiana should find his father in the middle of the story. \"Given the fact that it's the third film in the series, you couldn't just end with them obtaining the object. That's how the first two films ended,\" he said, \"So I thought, let them ''lose'' the Grail, and let the father\u2013son relationship be the main point.

The prologue has adult Indiana retrieving an Aztec relic for a museum curator in Mexico and features the circus train.

The character of Kazim is here named Kemal, and is an agent of the Republic of Hatay, which seeks the grail for its own. Kemal shoots Henry and dies drinking from the wrong chalice.

Gibbs built the tank over the framework of a {{convert|28|ST|adj=on}} [[excavator]] and added {{convert|7|ST|adj=on}} [[Continuous track|tracks]] that were driven by two automatic [[hydraulic pump]]s, each connected to a [[Range Rover]] [[Rover V8 engine|V8 engine]]. Gibbs built the tank from steel rather than aluminum or fiberglass because it would allow the realistically [[suspension (vehicle)|suspensionless]] vehicle to endure the rocky surfaces. Unlike its historic counterpart, which had only the two side guns, the tank had a turret gun added as well. It took four months to build and was transported to Almer\u00eda on a [[Short Belfast]] plane and then a low loader truck.<ref name=familybonds/>\n\nThe tank broke down twice. The [[distributor]]'s rotor arm broke and a replacement had to be sourced from [[Madrid]]. Then two of the device's valves used to cool the oil exploded, due to [[solder]] melting and mixing with the oil. It was very hot in the tank, despite the installation of ten fans, and the lack of suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking during filming breaks.<ref name=familybonds/> The tank only moved at {{convert|10|to|12|mph}}, which [[Vic Armstrong]] said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making it appear faster.<ref name=pro>Rinzler, Bouzereau, \"The Professionals: May 1988 to May 1989\", p. 204 - 229.</ref> A smaller section of the tank's top made from aluminum and which used rubber tracks was used for close-ups. It was built from a searchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive truck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off.<ref name=familybonds/> A quarter-scale model by Gibbs was driven over a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on|disp=flip}} cliff on location; [[Industrial Light & Magic]] created further shots of the tank's destruction with models and miniatures.<ref name=completion/>\n\n[[File:Almeria 02.jpg|thumb|left|The tank chase was filmed in the [[Tabernas Desert]] in Almer\u00eda, Spain.]]\n[[Michael Lantieri]], mechanical effects supervisor for the 1912 scenes, noted the difficulty in shooting the train sequence. \"You can't just stop a train,\" he said, \"If it misses its mark, it takes blocks and blocks to stop it and back up.\" Lantieri hid handles for the actors and stuntmen to grab onto when leaping from carriage to carriage. The carriage interiors shot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] were built on tubes that inflated and deflated to create a rocking motion.<ref name=familybonds/> For the close-up of the rhinoceros that strikes at (and misses) Indiana, a foam and fiberglass animatronic was made in London. When Spielberg decided he wanted it to move, the prop was sent to [[John Carl Buechler]] in Los Angeles, who resculpted it over three days to blink, snarl, snort and wiggle its ears. The giraffes were also created in London. Because steam locomotives are very loud, Lantieri's crew would respond to [[assistant director#Sub-roles|first assistant director]] [[David Tomblin]]'s radioed directions by making the giraffes nod or shake their heads to his questions, which amused the crew.<ref name=completion>{{cite web |title=A Quest's Completion |publisher=TheRaider.net |url=http://www.theraider.net/films/crusade/making_4_postproduction.php |access-date=February 6, 2009 |archive-date=February 20, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124058/http://theraider.net/films/crusade/making_4_postproduction.php |url-status=live }}</ref> For the villains' cars, Lantieri selected a 1914 [[Ford Model T]], a 1919 [[Ford Model T]] truck and a 1916 [[Saxon (automobile)|Saxon]] Model 14, fitting each with a [[Ford Pinto]] [[V6 engine]].

[[Stop motion]] animation was used for the shot of the German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a {{convert|210|feet}} model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against [[Chroma key|bluescreen]]; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was removed and later [[compositing|composited]] into the shot. Dust and shadows were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it appear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred [[tim-bird]]s were used in the background shots of the seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped feather-coated crosses onto the camera.

For the second trial, in which Indiana spells \"[[Jehovah|Iehova]]\" on stable stepping stones, it was intended to have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on \"J\". This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor, {{convert|30|feet}} above a cavern. As this was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production. The third trial, the leap of faith that Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden by [[forced perspective]], was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds. This was cheaper than building a full-size set. A puppet of Ford was used to create a shadow on the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} by {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} model because Ford had filmed the scene against bluescreen, which did not incorporate the shaft of light from the entrance.<ref name=completion/>\n\nSpielberg wanted Donovan's death shown in one shot, so it would not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to [[Julian Glover]]'s forehead and cheeks by [[Nick Dudman]] that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, as well as a mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by [[morphing]] together three puppets of Donovan created by [[Stephan Dupuis]] in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' (1988).<ref name=viewingguide/> A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because [[Alison Doody]]'s double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces [[Texture mapping|mapped]] over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a [[marionette]]; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.<ref name=completion/>\n\n[[Ben Burtt]] designed the sound effects. He recorded chickens for the sounds of the rats,<ref name=pro/> and digitally manipulated the noise made by a Styrofoam cup for the castle fire. He rode in a biplane to record the sounds for the dogfight sequence, and visited the demolition of a [[wind turbine]] for the plane crashes.<ref name=completion/> Burtt wanted an echoing gunshot for Donovan wounding Henry, so he fired a [[.357 Magnum]] in [[Skywalker Ranch]]'s underground car park, just as Lucas drove in.<ref name=pro/> A rubber balloon was used for the earthquake tremors at the temple.<ref>(2003).

Rain was created by filming granulated [[Borax]] soap against black at high speed. It was only lightly [[Multiple exposure#Double exposure|double exposed]] into the shots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The [[Administration Building, Treasure Island|Administration Building]] at San Francisco's [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]] was used as the exterior of [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]]. The structure already had period-appropriate [[art deco]] architecture, as it had been constructed in 1938 for planned use as an airport terminal. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage automobiles and a sign stating \"Berlin Flughafen\". The establishing shot of the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were backlit and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings were used for the sky and to give the appearance of [[fill light]] in the shadows and [[Backlighting (lighting design)|rim light]] on the edges of the buildings.<ref name=completion/>\n\n==Themes==\nA son's relationship with his estranged father is a common theme in Spielberg's films, including ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]''.<ref name=faber/> <!-- Spielberg biographer Douglas Brode notes that apart from Henry, Indiana has two other father figures, [[Marcus Brody]], and the grave robber known as Fedora. Henry seeks spiritual \"illumination\" while searching for the Holy Grail. In the prologue, Henry's face is not shown on screen, symbolizing that his relationship with his son has disappeared on an emotional level. Fedora is a mercenary and a villain but he is friendly towards Indiana. Both men inspired Indiana's dual personality as an adult: on the one hand, Indiana honors his father by teaching archaeology, but this is a social rather than spiritual way of examining artifacts, and further rejects Henry by dressing and adventuring like Fedora, the exciting father Indiana wished he had. Brody is far less self-important than Henry, and had he been Indiana's father then there would have been no need for him to invent the rebellious persona of the hatted explorer.-->\n\nThe film's exploration of fathers and sons coupled with its use of religious imagery is comparable to two other 1989 films, ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' and ''[[Field of Dreams]]''. Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Caryn James felt the combination in these films reflected [[New Age]] concerns, where the worship of God was equated to searching for fathers. James felt that neither Indiana nor his father is preoccupied with finding the Grail or defeating the Nazis, but that, rather, both seek professional respect for one another in their [[Boy's Own Paper|boys' own]] adventure.
