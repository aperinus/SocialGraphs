Campbell Bruce and dramatizes the [[June 1962 Alcatraz escape attempt|1962 prisoner escape]] from the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|maximum security prison]] on [[Alcatraz Island]]. The film stars [[Clint Eastwood]], and features [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Jack Thibeau]], and [[Larry Hankin]]. [[Danny Glover]] appears in his film debut. ''Escape from Alcatraz'' marks the fifth and final collaboration between Siegel and Eastwood, following ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'' (1968), ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), ''[[The Beguiled (1971 film)|The Beguiled]]'' (1971), and ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971).\n\n==Plot==\nIn early 1960 [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Morris]], an exceptionally intelligent criminal who has absconded from other facilities, arrives at the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|maximum security prison]] on [[Alcatraz Island]]. The Warden curtly informs him that Alcatraz is unique within the US prison system for its exceedingly high level of security and that no inmate has ever successfully escaped. During the conversation Morris steals one of the [[nail clipper]]s on the desk.\n\nOver the next several days Morris makes acquaintances with a few inmates: the eccentric Litmus, who is fond of desserts; English, a black inmate serving two life sentences for killing two white men in self-defence; and the elderly Doc, who paints portraits and once grew [[chrysanthemum]]s at Alcatraz. Morris also makes an enemy of a rapist nicknamed Wolf, who tries to harass him in the showers and later attacks him in the prison yard with a knife. Both men are imprisoned in isolation in [[Solitary confinement|the hole]].\n\nMorris is released while Wolf stays. The Warden discovers that Doc has painted a portrait of him, as well as other guards on the island itself.  Despite the paintings being respectful and flattering likenesses, he permanently removes Doc's painting privileges just to be cruel. Doc is depressed and hacks off several fingers of his left hand with a hatchet from the prison workshop before being led away.\n\nLater, Morris encounters two bank robbers and brothers [[John Anglin (criminal)|John]] and [[Clarence Anglin]], who are his old friends from another prison sentence, and he links up with prisoner Charley Butts. Morris notices that the concrete around the grille in his cell is weak and can be chipped away, which evolves into an escape plan. Over the next few months Morris, the Anglins, and Butts dig through the walls of their cells with spoons (which have been soldered into makeshift shovels), make [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] [[Mannequin|dummies]] to act as decoys, and construct a raft out of raincoats.\n\nDuring mealtime Morris places a chrysanthemum at the table in honour of Doc, but the Warden stops by and crushes it, causing a provoked and angry Litmus to suffer a heart attack. The Warden orders an inspection of Morris' cell but finds nothing unusual. Nonetheless, he issues orders for Morris to be relocated to a different cell as soon as possible. Wolf has been released from solitary confinement and prepares to attack Morris again, but English is able to intercept him, with English implying that his gang will beat up Wolf.\n\nThat night, the inmates decide they are now ready to leave. Morris, the Anglins and Butts plan to meet in the passageway and escape. Butts loses his nerve and fails to rendezvous with them. He later changes his mind but is too late and returns to his cell where he sulks over his missed opportunity.\n\nCarrying the flotation gear, Morris and the Anglins access the roof and avoid the searchlights. They scramble down the side of the building into the prison yard, climb over a barbed-wire fence, and make their way to the shoreline of the island, where they inflate the raft. The three men depart from Alcatraz, partially submerged in the water, clinging to the raft and using their legs as the primary propelling force.\n\nThe following morning the escape is discovered and a massive manhunt ensues. Shreds of raincoat material, including personal effects of the men, are found floating in the bay. While searching on [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]], the Warden stubbornly insists that the men's personal effects were important, and the men would have drowned before leaving them behind. A guard believes the convicts got rid of them on the pretence that they drowned. The  Warden is informed by his aide that he has been summoned to go to Washington to face his superiors, with the prospect of being forced to accept an early retirement/termination of his duties for having failed to prevent the breakout from happening. On a rock he finds a chrysanthemum and is told by the aide that none grow on Angel Island. An epilogue text notes that the fugitives were never found, and that Alcatraz was closed less than a year later.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Morris]]\n* [[Patrick McGoohan]] as the Warden\n* [[Fred Ward]] as [[John Anglin (criminal)|John Anglin]]\n* [[Jack Thibeau]] as [[Clarence Anglin]]\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Charley Butts\n* Frank Ronzio as Litmus\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as Chester \"Doc\" Dalton\n* [[Paul Benjamin]] as English\n* [[Bruce M.

Screenwriter Richard Tuggle spent six months researching and writing a screenplay based on the 1963 non-fiction account by J. Campbell Bruce.<ref name=\"M304\">{{cite book|last=McGilligan|first=Patrick|title=Clint: The Life and Legend|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|year=1999|page=304|isbn=0-00-638354-8|location=London}}</ref> He went to the [[Writers Guild of America, west|Writers Guild]] and received a list of [[literary agents]] who would accept unsolicited manuscripts. He submitted a copy to each, and also to anybody else in the business that he could cajole into reading it.<ref name=\"William Morrow & Company\">{{cite book |last1=Litwak |first1=Mark |title=Reel Power: The Struggle For Influence and Success in the New Hollywood|date=1986 |publisher=William Morrow & Company |location=New York |isbn=0-688-04889-7 |pages=131\u2013132}}</ref>\n\nEveryone rejected it, saying it had poor dialogue and characters, lacked a love interest, and that the public was not interested in prison stories. Tuggle decided to bypass producers and executives and deal directly with filmmakers. He called the agent for director [[Don Siegel]] and lied, saying he had met Siegel at a party and the director had expressed interest in reading his script. The agent forwarded the script to Siegel, who read it, liked it, and passed it on to [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref name=\"William Morrow & Company\"/>\n\nEastwood was drawn to the role as ringleader Frank Morris and agreed to star, provided Siegel would direct under the [[Malpaso Productions|Malpaso]] banner. Siegel insisted that it be a Don Siegel film and outmanoeuvred Eastwood by purchasing the rights to the film for $100,000.<ref name=\"Hughes175\"/> This created a rift between the two friends. Although Siegel eventually agreed for it to be a Malpaso-Siegel production, Siegel went to [[Paramount Pictures]], a rival studio,<ref name=\"M304\"/> and never directed an Eastwood picture again.\n\nAlthough Alcatraz had its own power plant, it was no longer functional, and 15 miles of cable were required to connect the island to San Francisco's electricity. As Siegel and Tuggle worked on the script, the producers paid $500,000 to restore the decaying prison and recreate the cold atmosphere;<ref name=\"Hughes175\"/> some interiors had to be recreated in the studio. Many of the improvements were kept intact after the film was made.\n\nSiegel's original ending closed with the guards\u2019 discovery of the dummy head in Morris's bed, leaving it uncertain whether the escape attempt had succeeded or failed. Eastwood disliked this and extended the ending by having the Warden searching Angel Island and discovering a chrysanthemum on the rocks, a genus not native to the island but grown on Alcatraz by Doc, and later used by Morris, though it is left unclear if the chrysanthemum was placed there by Morris having survived, or simply washed up when Morris drowned. The Warden is then informed by his aide that he has been summoned to catch the next plane to Washington to face his superiors: it is left up to the viewers to conclude whether or not the escapees succeeded in making their escape.<ref name=\"Hughes152\">Hughes, p.152</ref>\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n{{See also|June 1962 Alcatraz escape attempt}}\nThe film's final scene implies that the escape was successful, but in fact it remains a mystery whether this is so.<ref name=\"NYTimes_June2012\">{{Citation\n  | last = McFadden\n  | first = Robert D.\n  | title = Tale of 3 Inmates Who Vanished From Alcatraz Maintains Intrigue 50 Years Later\n  | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]\n  | location = New York, NY\n  | date = June 9, 2012\n  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/us/anniversary-of-a-mystery-at-alcatraz.html \n  | access-date = June 9, 2012\n}}</ref> Circumstantial evidence uncovered in the early 2010s seemed to suggest that the men had survived, and that, contrary to the official FBI report of the escapees' raft never being recovered and no car thefts being reported, a raft was discovered on nearby [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] with footprints leading away (similar to the fictional scene in the movie where the Warden finds a chrysanthemum possibly left by the escapees)<ref name=\"auto6\">{{Cite web|url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/02/08/investigator-says-1962-alcatraz-escapees-likely-survived/|title=Investigator Says 1962 Alcatraz Escapees Likely Survived|date=February 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes_June2012\" /><ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/06/19/alcatraz-escapees-sister-returns-to-robbery-scene/|title=Alcatraz escapee's sister returns to robbery scene|agency=Associated Press |date=June 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe character Charley Butts was based on a fourth inmate, Allen West, who did participate in the real escape but was left behind when he couldn\u2019t remove his ventilator grille on the night of the escape. He aided the FBI's official investigation of the escape.\n\nThe Warden as portrayed in the film is a fictional character. The film is set between the arrival of Morris at Alcatraz in January 1960 and his escape in June 1962. Shortly after he arrives, Morris meets the Warden, who remains in office over the course of the entire movie. In reality, Warden [[Paul J. Madigan|Madigan]] had been replaced by [[Olin G. Blackwell|Blackwell]] in 1961. The Warden character mentions his predecessors [[James A. Johnston|Johnston]] (1934\u201348) and (incorrectly) [[Olin G. Blackwell|Blackwell]] (1961\u201363).<ref>''A History of Alcatraz Island: 1853-2008'' by Gregory L.
