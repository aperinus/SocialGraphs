The film stars [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a]]<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/colombiana-film-review-215647|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Colombiana: Film Review|access-date=19 August 2011|date=26 July 2011|first=Jordan|last=Mintzer}}</ref> with supporting roles by [[Michael Vartan]], [[Cliff Curtis]], [[Lennie James]], [[Callum Blue]], and [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]]. The term \"Colombiana\" means a woman from Colombia. The film is about Cataleya (named for a [[Cattleya|genus of orchids]]), a nine-year-old girl in [[Colombia]] whose family is killed by a drug lord. Fifteen years later, a grown Cataleya seeks her revenge.\n\nWhile the film had a generally negative reception from critics, Salda\u00f1a's action sequences were praised and the movie earned $63.4 million against a $40 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 1992, in [[Bogota, Colombia]], drug baron Don Luis Sandoval sends his enforcer Marco and a gang of armed men to kill his associate Fabio Restrepo and his family because Fabio has defied him by trying to leave his criminal life behind. Fabio gives his nine-year-old daughter, Cataleya, a [[SmartMedia]] computer memory card loaded with information on Don Luis' business and tells her it's her \"passport\"; he also gives her the address of her uncle Emilio in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], who will take care of her. Finally, he leaves her with her mother's cataleya orchid necklace. After Fabio and his wife Alicia are gunned down, Cataleya escapes and seeks asylum at the U.S. Embassy. She is granted passage to the [[United States]] after handing over the memory card to embassy staff. Although American officials attempt to transfer her into the foster care system, Cataleya tracks down her uncle in Chicago and asks him to train her as a killer.\n\nFifteen years later, a grown Cataleya has become an accomplished assassin. Emilio serves as her broker, providing her with contracts. With each murder she commits, she leaves her signature, the [[Cattleya]] flower, hoping to one day attract the attention of Don Luis so she can take her revenge. When Emilio finds out about Cataleya's intentions and that she has been targeting men connected to the Don, he begs her to stop to avoid endangering the lives of his own family, but she refuses and they have a falling out. While she is spending the night with her American boyfriend, Danny Delanay, he takes a photo of her sleeping and then shows it to a friend, who then decides to run a background check on Cataleya.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent James Ross is working to identify the killer behind more than twenty unsolved murders, all of which have cattleya orchids left behind. He gets a pin on Cataleya's photo from the background check and orders her arrest, but Cataleya escapes and reaches out to Emilio, only to find him and his family brutally slaughtered. She then confronts Ross at his home and threatens his wife and children, forcing him to reach out to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Steve Richard, who she knows is sheltering Don Luis from the law in exchange for his cooperation with American authorities. After she makes it clear to Richard that she knows where to find his family, he gives her the Don's location.\n\nMeanwhile, Don Luis learns that Cataleya is still alive and organizes his men to kill her, but she ambushes them first and wipes out the entire gang. She also confronts and kills Marco before Don Luis flees and swears revenge. Cataleya, having planted her specially trained attack dogs in his escape vehicle, orders them to tear the Don to pieces. Danny is last seen being interrogated by Ross, but the moment the agent steps outside, Cataleya calls him from a payphone before getting on a bus back to nowhere.\n\n==Main cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing credits order and names --->\n* [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a]] as Cataleya Restrepo / Valerie Phillips / Jennifer \"Jen\", a [[Contract killing|contract killer]] who witnessed her parents being murdered when she was nine years old.
