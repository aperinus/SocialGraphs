The film follows an out-of-work actor (Ferrell) who discovers, during the [[remake]] of ''[[Bewitched]]'', that his co-star (Kidman) is an actual [[witch]].\n\nProduced and distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]] with [[Red Wagon Entertainment]], the film is a [[re-imagining]] of the [[Bewitched|television series of the same name]] (produced by Columbia's [[Screen Gems]] television studio, now [[Sony Pictures Television]]). ''Bewitched'' opened theatrically on June 24, 2005 to negative reviews and failed to meet expectations at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\nJack Wyatt is a [[narcissistic]] actor who is approached to play the role of Darrin in a remake of the 1960s [[sitcom]] ''[[Bewitched]]'', but insists that an unknown play Samantha. Isabel Bigelow is an actual [[Witchcraft|witch]] who decides she wants to be normal and moves to [[Los Angeles]] to start a new life and becomes friends with her neighbor Maria. She goes to a bookstore to learn how to get a job after seeing an advertisement of [[Ed McMahon]] on television. Jack happens to be at the same bookstore after attending some failed Samantha auditions. Jack spots Isabel and persuades her to audition. At the same time, while she's trying to settle into her new life, Isabel's intrusive father Nigel keeps appearing to convince her to return home, despite several rejections from Isabel.\n\nAfter Isabel impresses the show's producers and writers, Jack finally convinces Isabel to join the show. Also joining the show is legendary actress Iris Smythson as Endora. After a successful taping of the pilot, Isabel happens to overhear a conversation Jack is having with his agent Ritchie. They are talking about how they tricked Isabel to appear without having any lines. Furious, Isabel storms off with Maria and new neighbor friend Nina close behind. She decides she only has three choices: quit, get mad, or live with it. Instead, Isabel's Aunt Clara visits and aids Isabel in casting a spell on Jack in order to [[Love spell|make him fall in love]] with her. At the same time, Nigel is introduced to Iris and becomes infatuated with her.\n\nThe hex works and Jack becomes love struck by Isabel, insisting on several script changes to give her some dialogue and jokes, ignoring statements from test groups preferring Isabel over him. Jack's affection for Isabel grows and he asks her out on a date, making Isabel forget about the hex. But when he brings her home, she remembers and reverses it back to when she and Aunt Clara cast it. The next day, rather than the events the hex presented, Jack is outraged by the scores he received and takes his anger out on Isabel, who lashes back at him. Ritchie fires her, and she storms off.\n\nRather than be angry at her, Jack is fascinated with Isabel and chases after her, accepting all her comments. After another taping (with Isabel getting dialogue), their romance blossoms. But the next day, Jack's former wife Sheila arrives, determined to woo Jack back. Isabel sees this and casts a spell on her making her sign the divorce papers and have her decide to move to [[Iceland]]. Jack, thrilled, announces he will be throwing a party at his house celebrating the divorce.\n\nNigel attends the party with Iris and when Nigel begins flirting with much younger guests, Iris reveals that she is also a witch and casts a spell on each girl. When Jack makes a toast stating truth will be revealed with everyone, Isabel decides to tell Jack she's a witch. At first, thinking she's simply an amateur magician, Jack finally believes her when she levitates him with her broom. Jack becomes frightened and shoos her away with a stick. Offended and heartbroken, Isabel flies off.\n\nJack takes this hard, being brought to the studios by the police and becoming disenchanted with the project. Isabel decides to return home as she no longer wishes to stay. Jack, imagining himself on the ''Conan O'Brien Show'', is visited by Uncle Arthur. Arthur convinces Jack not to let Isabel leave, because Jack still loves her and wouldn't be able to return for 100 years (which is later proven to be a lie Arthur made up to inspire Jack). Arthur drives him to the studio where he finds Isabel at the set. Jack apologizes to her and tells her he wants to marry her. Six months later, they do get married and move into their new neighborhood (which resembles the neighborhood in the series, with the Kravitzes living right across the street).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Isabel Bigelow / [[Samantha Stephens]]\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Jack Wyatt / [[Darrin Stephens]]\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Iris Smythson / [[Endora (Bewitched)|Endora]]\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Nigel Bigelow\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as Ritchie\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Maria Kelly\n* [[Heather Burns]] as Nina\n* [[Jim Turner (comedian)|Jim Turner]] as Larry\n* [[Stephen Colbert]] as Stu Robison\n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Jim Fields\n* [[Michael Badalucco]] as Joey Props\n* [[Katie Finneran]] as Sheila Wyatt\n\n;Actual characters from the series\n* [[Carole Shelley]] as [[List of Bewitched characters#Aunt Clara|Aunt Clara]]\n* [[Steve Carell]] as [[List of Bewitched characters#Uncle Arthur|Uncle Arthur]]\n* [[Amy Sedaris]] as [[List of Bewitched characters#Gladys Kravitz|Gladys Kravitz]]\n* [[Richard Kind]] as [[List of Bewitched characters#Abner Kravitz|Abner Kravitz]]\n\n;Cameo appearances\n* [[Ed McMahon]] as himself\n* [[Conan O'Brien]] as himself\n* [[James Lipton]] as himself\n* [[Nick Lachey]] as Cooley\n* [[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]] as Nadine\n* Abbey McBride as Matilda\n* [[Jen Taylor]] as Park Ranger Patti Crawford\n* Teri Robinson as Mary Bryson\n* [[Victor Williams]] as Officer James Bryan\n* [[Roxanne Beckford]] as Francine Jones\n\n==Production==\n''Bewitched'' had complicated development process that took nearly a decade.
