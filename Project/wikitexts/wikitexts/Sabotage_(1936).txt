It is loosely based on [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1907 novel ''[[The Secret Agent]]'', about a woman who discovers that her husband, a London shopkeeper, is a terrorist agent.<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/>\n\n''Sabotage'' should not be confused with Hitchcock's film ''[[Secret Agent (1936 film)|Secret Agent]]'', which was also released in 1936, but which instead is loosely based on two stories in the 1927 collection ''[[Ashenden: Or the British Agent]]'' by [[W. Somerset Maugham]].<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/> It also should not be confused with Hitchcock's film ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942), which includes the iconic fall from the torch of the [[Statue of Liberty]] which presaged the [[Mount Rushmore]] scene in ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959).\n\nIn 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine ranked the film 44th best British film ever.<ref>[https://www.timeout.com/london/film/100-best-british-films#tab_panel_4 \"The 100 best British films\"]. ''Time Out''. Retrieved 24 October 2017</ref> In 2021, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' ranked the film at No. 3 on its list of \"The 100 best British films of all time\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 best British films of all time|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/best-british-films-all-time-movies-2021/|website=The Telegraph|date=3 July 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[London]], sand is put into the bearings of an electrical generator, causing a power blackout. At a cinema owned by Karl Verloc ([[Oscar Homolka]]), people demand their money back. Verloc enters through a back entrance to the living quarters above. He washes sand from his hands, but when his wife ([[Sylvia Sidney]]) comes for him, he pretends to have been asleep. He instructs her to refund the money, saying he has \"some money coming in\" anyway. As the money is about to be disbursed to the customers downstairs, the lights go back on.\n\nThe next day, Verloc meets his contact. They are part of a gang of [[terrorism|terrorists]] from an unnamed [[Europe]]an country who are planning a series of attacks in London, though no exact motive is made clear. Verloc's contact is disappointed that the newspapers mocked the short loss of electricity, and instructs Verloc to place a parcel of \"fireworks\" at the [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]] on Saturday, during the [[Lord Mayor's Show]]. Verloc is not comfortable with killing, but his contact says to get someone else to do it. Verloc is given the address of a bird shop, whose owner also makes bombs.\n\n[[Scotland Yard]] suspects Verloc's involvement in the plot and has placed Detective Sergeant Ted Spencer ([[John Loder (actor)|John Loder]]) undercover as a [[greengrocer]]'s helper next to the cinema. He befriends Mrs. Verloc and her little brother, Stevie ([[Desmond Tester]]), who lives with them, by treating them to a meal at [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand|Simpson's]]. At this point, Spencer and Scotland Yard are unsure whether Mrs. Verloc is complicit in the terrorist plots or innocently unaware; but by the end of the meal, he is convinced she is innocent and is falling for her.\n\nVerloc goes to the bird shop. The bomb-maker says he will prepare a [[time bomb]] and set it to explode at 1:45&nbsp;p.m. on Saturday. Later that night, members of the terrorist group meet in Verloc's living room above the cinema. Detective Spencer attempts to eavesdrop on the conversation, but is seen and recognized. The meeting ends abruptly and the members scatter, worried that they are all being followed. Verloc tells his wife the police are investigating him, but maintains his innocence.\n\nThe next day, Verloc receives a package containing two caged canaries \u2013 a present for Stevie \u2013 and the bomb. Spencer shows up with Stevie and tells Mrs. Verloc of Scotland Yard's suspicions. Verloc sees them talking, and becomes nervous. Before he can be questioned, Verloc asks Stevie to deliver a film canister to another cinema, and since it is on his way, to deposit another package in the [[cloakroom#Attendants|cloakroom]] at Piccadilly Circus station by 1:30&nbsp;p.m. He says it contains projector parts to be repaired and the repairman will collect it there.\n\nUnknowingly carrying the time bomb for Verloc, Stevie is delayed by several events, including the Lord Mayor's Show procession. Now late, Stevie manages to talk himself aboard a bus to Piccadilly Circus, even though flammable [[nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] is not allowed on public vehicles. The bomb explodes on the bus, killing Stevie and others.\n\nVerloc confesses to his wife, but blames Scotland Yard and Spencer for Stevie's death, since they were the ones who prevented Verloc from delivering the bomb himself. Soon afterwards, as they are preparing to eat dinner, she becomes infuriated and stabs him to death with a knife. When Spencer arrives to arrest Verloc he realises what has happened, but he insists that she should not admit stabbing her husband. Even if it was self-defense, she might not be believed in court. Spencer plans to abandon his career and leave the country with her.\n\nThe bomb-maker goes to Verloc's flat to retrieve the birdcage in case it might incriminate him, but the police, who already suspect him, follow him. When they arrive, Mrs. Verloc tries to confess, but moments after she says her husband is dead, the bomb-maker sets off a bomb he was carrying, killing himself and destroying Verloc's body.\n\nAfterwards, the police superintendent is unsure whether she spoke before or after the explosion, as Ted and Mrs. Verloc flee the city.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sylvia Sidney]] listed as Sylvia Sydney as Mrs. Verloc\n*[[Oskar Homolka]] listed as Oscar Homolka as Karl Anton Verloc, \"Her Husband\"\n*[[Desmond Tester]] as Steve (Stevie) \"Her Young Brother\"\n*[[John Loder (actor)|John Loder]] as Sergeant Ted Spencer\n*[[Joyce Barbour]] as Renee\n*[[Matthew Boulton (actor)|Matthew Boulton]] as Superintendent Talbot\n*[[S.

Hitchcock, who was not happy with Loder's casting, later commented, \"The actor we got wasn't suitable, and I was forced to rewrite the dialogue during the shooting\".<ref>Alfred Hitchcock and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut ''Hitchcock'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1985, p.109</ref>\n\nHitchcock also chose the young Bobby Rietti \u2013 later known as [[Robert Rietti]] \u2013 to play the part of Steve, but was not able to sign him for legal reasons.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Frank Nugent|Frank S. Nugent]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the film as \"a masterly exercise in suspense.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nugent |first=Frank S. |author-link=Frank Nugent |date=27 February 1937 |title=The Screen |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=9 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"Competent and experienced hand of the director is apparent throughout this production, which is a smart one and executed in a business-like manner from start to finish.\" However, the review noted that the motivation of the terrorists \"is not made clear. As a result, the audience watches the piece and its suspensive moments with interest, and when it is over, is still hazy as to the why and wherefore.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=16 December 1936 |title=Sabotage |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=15 }}</ref> ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' called it \"A thrilling melodrama,\" adding that Hitchcock \"again shows his skill in building up a situation to a tense climax.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=30 January 1937 |title='The Woman Alone' with Sylvia Sidney and Oscar Homolka |journal=[[Harrison's Reports]] |page=19 }}</ref> ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote, \"The individual genius of Hitchcock is very clearly shown in the distinctive and original direction,\" and called Oscar Homolka's performance \"remarkable.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 1936 |title=Sabotage |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=3 |issue=36 |page=214 }}</ref> [[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called it \"rather exciting for the most part.

Greene identified the children's matin\u00e9e scene as an \"ingenious and pathetic twist [[Hitchcockian|stamped as Mr Hitchcock's own]]\", and he praised the melodrama present in the screenplay writing, the dialogue, and the acting cast generally. Greene's only complaint was in relation to the acting of the \"unconvincing\" detective (Loder) and the \"invincibl[y] distaste[ful]\" prep school student (Tester).<ref>{{cite journal |last= Greene|first= Graham|author-link= Graham Greene|date= 11 December 1936|title= Sabotage/The Tenth Man|journal= [[The Spectator]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book|editor-last= Taylor|editor-first= John Russell|editor-link= John Russell Taylor|date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|url= https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/122|publisher= Oxford University Press|pages= [https://archive.org/details/pleasuredomegrah00gree/page/122 122-123]|isbn= 0192812866}})</ref>\n\n''Sabotage'' garnered 92% approval on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average rating of 7.4/10.<ref name=\"RT rating\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1018044-sabotage/ |title=Sabotage (1937) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=21 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptation==\nBennett liberally adapted Joseph Conrad's novel, transforming the highly political Tsarist-era agents provocateurs into foreign agents without any obvious political leanings.<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/><ref name=\"screen\">[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/438045/index.html Sabotage] at screenonline</ref> Verloc's shop is transformed into a cinema, with the films being shown echoing the story, and the policeman investigating the case is an undercover officer posing as a greengrocer.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book\n| last = Spoto\n| first = Donald\n| title = The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock\n| publisher = Da Capo\n| year = 1999\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/155 155\u2013158]\n| isbn = 0-306-80932-X\n| url-access = registration\n| url = https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/155\n}}</ref><ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/> Since the film was produced in the years immediately preceding [[World War II]], the unnamed hostile power behind the bombings has been assumed by many viewers to be [[Nazi Germany]]. However, the film does not specify this, and indeed, Verloc's first name has been changed, presumably because his name in the novel, Adolf, had too many connotations by the time the film was made.<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/>\n\nStevie, Mrs. Verloc's brother, is portrayed as an ordinary schoolboy, with few of the visionary attributes of his literary counterpart. Stevie's death is a climactic moment in the plot, providing insight into Hitchcock's views about how the innocent suffer through random acts of violence.<ref name=\"book\"/> When a critic condemned Stevie's death as brutal and unnecessary, Hitchcock said that he regretted including it in the film, not because of the brutality, however, but because it violated his method of suspense, whereby tension eventually had to be relieved. Yet, Hitchcock remained faithful to the novel in having the bomb go off,<ref name=\"screen\"/> and it also allowed him to justify in the movie that the boy's sister would eventually kill her husband, who was responsible for the boy's death, and got away with it.\n\n==Allusions==\nThe fact that many scenes of the film were set in a cinema allowed Hitchcock to include references to contemporary films and storylines. Perhaps the most famous of these is the final film sequence, an excerpt from a [[Walt Disney]] [[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]] ''[[Who Killed Cock Robin? (1935 film)|Who Killed Cock Robin?]]'' (1935).<ref name=\"HitchcockGuide\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Quentin Tarantino]] used the scene where Stevie is initially not allowed onto the bus due to the nitrate film he is carrying, in his film ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]''. This was used to explain the use of nitrate film for the character's terrorist plot.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Secret Agent (1992 TV series)|The Secret Agent]]'' (1992, TV miniseries)\n*''[[The Secret Agent (1996 film)|The Secret Agent]]'' (1996)\n*''[[The Secret Agent (2016 TV series)|The Secret Agent]]'' (2016, TV miniseries)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0028212|title=Sabotage}}\n*{{Amg movie|42509|Sabotage}}\n*{{tcmdb title|id=88832|title=Sabotage}}\n*[https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-sabotage-1936 ''Alfred Hitchcock Collectors\u2019 Guide: Sabotage'' at Brenton Film]\n\n{{Alfred Hitchcock}}\n{{Conrad}}\n{{The Secret Agent}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sabotage (Film)}}\n[[Category:1936 films]]\n[[Category:1930s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:1930s spy thriller films]]\n[[Category:British black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:British spy thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on mystery novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Joseph Conrad]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alfred Hitchcock]]\n[[Category:Films set in a movie theatre]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jack Beaver]]\n[[Category:British psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:1930s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1930s British films]]"}]}}}}
