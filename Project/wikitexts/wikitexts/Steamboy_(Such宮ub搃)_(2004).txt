The film was released in Japan by [[Toho]] on July 17, 2004. ''Steamboy'' was the most expensive Japanese anime film up until then with a {{JPY|2.4 billion}} ({{US$|26 million|long=no}}) production budget, having been in production for ten years and utilizing more than 180,000 drawings and 440 CG cuts.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=January 2016}}\nIn 1863, where an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate]] nineteenth century Europe has made tremendous strides in steam-powered technologies, scientist Lloyd Steam and his son, Edward \u201cEddy\u201d Steam, have succeeded in discovering a pure mineral water in [[Iceland]] which they believe can be harnessed as a nearly unlimited power source for steam engines. An experiment in [[Russian Alaska]] goes terribly wrong, with Eddy being engulfed in freezing gases, but results in the creation of a spherical device.\n\nThree years later, Lloyd sends the device, along with its schematics, to his grandson (and Eddy\u2019s son), James Ray Steam, who works as a maintenance boy in [[Manchester]], England, along with instructions to guard it. Members of \"The O'Hara Foundation\" arrive and attempt to steal the sphere, but Lloyd appears, stating that the device killed Eddy and bids James to flee and deliver the device to [[Robert Stephenson]]. After fleeing the O'Hara agents on his personal steam-powered [[monowheel]], James briefly meets Stephenson on a train headed into Manchester, but James, along with the device, are captured by O'Hara agents in a [[dirigible]].\n\nJames is taken to [[London]], where preparations are being made for the 1866 [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]], and meets Scarlett O'Hara St Jones, the spoiled granddaughter of the Foundation's head chairman, Archibald Simon O\u2019Hara. He also discovers Eddy, alive but severely scarred and mechanized from his injuries in Alaska, working with O'Hara on the \"Steam Castle\"; an elaborate facility entirely powered by three devices called \"Steam Balls,\" one of which was the device sent to James. James is enamored both by the castle, and his father's vision of using it to enlighten mankind, and volunteers to help complete the project. He also begins developing a love/hate friendship with Scarlett, who is attracted to him.\n\nJames encounters Lloyd again, who was captured by O'Hara, but has escaped from his cell and is attempting to sabotage the castle, revealing that the Foundation's true intentions for the exhibition is to [[arms dealing|sell weapons of war]]. Lloyd shows James a hidden armory filled with massive steam-powered war machines built by Eddy, and James struggles with the moral dichotomy of being a scientist - of how to contribute to the world without giving into vanity, leaving him conflicted as to whether to side with Lloyd or Edward, who themselves have become estranged.\n\nLloyd and James reach the core of the castle and remove one of the Steam Balls, but Lloyd is shot and recaptured by O'Hara, as James escapes with the device. The next morning, the exhibition is underway, and James brings the ball to Stephenson, giving him the ball and the knowledge he acquired in captivity. The British military attempts to arrest Eddy, but Eddy unleashes his steam powered weapons on the soldiers, turning the exhibition into a battlefield. When Stephenson uses the Steam Ball to enhance his own company's [[tank]]s, James realizes that he had no better intentions than the Foundation.\n\nEager to show the world the castle's true power, Eddy orders it to be prematurely activated, causing the structure to rise and shed its decorative outer shell, revealing it to be a monstrous floating fortress. As the [[Royal Navy]] and Stephenson attempt to defend London from the floating fortress, James steals the Steam Ball back and uses it to create a makeshift aircraft to re-board the fortress. James meets Eddy, Scarlett, and Lloyd in the castle's control room, where Lloyd confronts Eddy about his actions, before shooting him in a fit of rage, but Eddy falls into a cloud of steam and disappears.\n\nWith the castle steered off course, the structure has become unstable and threatens to explode over the city. As Lloyd and James rush to redirect the castle over the [[Thames]], Eddy, whose metal body repelled the gunshot, re-emerges from the steam and assists them, having realized his folly. James re-installs the stolen steam ball, and makes his way to the control room to make a final escape with Scarlett on an emergency jetpack, while Eddy and Lloyd reconcile and halt the machine over the river and escape as well. The castle detonates in a spectacular explosion, sparing the city from destruction.\n\nThe ending montage reveals James returning home, and later becoming a global superhero using the jetpack gear from the castle; Lloyd introducing James to electricity and finally passing away; Eddy founding a corporate conglomerate; Scarlett maturing and becoming a famous pilot, and the [[World War I|Great War]] being fought with [[Paratrooper|paratroopers]] and [[Zeppelin|zeppelins]].\n\n== Characters ==\n; {{nihongo|James Ray Steam|\u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30fb\u30ec\u30a4\u30fb\u30b9\u30c1\u30e0|J\u0113musu Rei Suchimu}}\n* {{Anime voices|[[Anne Suzuki]]|[[Anna Paquin]]}}\n: The main character, a 13-year-old boy living in [[Manchester]], is an inventor following the paths of his father and grandfather. He possesses a mechanical talent that was inherited from his family, and demonstrates this in at least two instances by building a steam-powered [[monowheel]] and a steam-propelled flying device. He has a youthful idealism and sincerely dislikes the employment of technology for harmful purposes. During the film his motivations are alternately swayed by the influences of his father and grandfather.\n\n; {{nihongo|Scarlett O'Hara St. Jones|\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30cf\u30e9\u30fb\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ba|Suk\u0101retto Ohara Sentoj\u014dnzu}}\n* {{Anime voices|[[Manami Konishi]]|[[Kari Wahlgren]]}}\n: Selfish, spoiled, misguided, yet whimsical and not completely heartless; she is the American 14-year-old granddaughter of the chairman of the O'Hara Foundation.

The original conceiver of the Steamball, which he succeeds in developing with his son Edward. Lloyd's pursuit of progress without much regards to safety and ignorance of Eddy's pleading directly leads to his son's disfigurement. A difference of opinions with his son Edward leads to friction between them. While Edward believes that science is an instrument of power, Lloyd simply wishes to use it to help people. They both develop distinctly different visions for their ultimate invention, the Steam Castle. It is later revealed that Lloyd intended the Steam Castle to be a sort of flying amusement park, but Eddy scoffed at such a premise, denouncing it as a \"fairy tale vision\". Edward instead built the Steam Castle as a flying military fortress.\n\n; {{nihongo|Edward Steam (Eddy)|\u30a8\u30c9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30b9\u30c1\u30e0\uff08\u30a8\u30c7\u30a3\uff09|Edow\u0101do Suchimu (Edi)}}\n* {{Anime voices|[[Masane Tsukayama]]|[[Alfred Molina]]}}\n: Ray's father. The accident that occurred in the development of the Steamball left Edward in a state where he needed to have machinery replace some of his body, including his right arm and parts of his legs. It left him not only physically disfigured, but it severely twisted his morals as well, driving him to believe that science is an expression of mankind's ultimate power. Edward's father calls him Eddy. He uses the Foundation and the Exhibition as a springboard to launch his ultimate invention: a monstrous, flying war machine called the Steam Castle.\n\n; {{nihongo|Robert Stephenson|\u30ed\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30d6\u30f3\u30b9\u30f3|Rob\u0101to Such\u012bbunsun}}\n* {{Anime voices|[[Kiyoshi Kodama]]|[[Oliver Cotton]]}}\n: Edward and Lloyd Steam's friend and rival, a major player in the [[Industrial Revolution]].

He outlives his oafish companion, and seems to hate Ray even more. He, along with Jason, performs much of Simon's dirty work. The two of them capture Ray and bring him to London, and later attempt to kill him. Alfred does so by trying to smash him with a construction crane, but Ray deftly avoids it, causing it to slam into Alfred instead.\n\n; {{nihongo|Jason|\u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30bd\u30f3|Jeison}}\n* {{Anime voices|[[Tetsu Inada]]|David S.
