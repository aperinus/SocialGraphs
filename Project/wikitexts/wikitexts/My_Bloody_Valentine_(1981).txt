It stars Paul Kelman, [[Lori Hallier]], and [[Neil Affleck]]. The plot tells about a group of young adults who decide to throw a [[Valentine's Day]] party, only to incur the vengeful wrath of a maniac in mining gear who begins a killing spree.\n\nConceived and produced entirely over the course of around a year,<ref name=bl/> the film was shot on location in [[Sydney Mines]], [[Nova Scotia]], in the fall of 1980. It was theatrically released on February 11, 1981 by [[Paramount Pictures]], coinciding with the Valentine's holiday. Despite a mixed response from critics and grossing $5.7 million at the box office, the film has developed a large [[cult following]] over the years since its release.\n\n''My Bloody Valentine'' faced notable [[censorship]], having a total of nine minutes cut by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] due to the amount of violence and gore. Though co-producer Dunning confirmed that the excised footage still existed, attempts to release it proved difficult as [[Paramount Pictures]] refused to offer an uncut version. In 2009, [[Lionsgate]] subsequently licensed the home media rights to the film and released [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] editions with three minutes of additional footage restored. The same year, Lionsgate released a [[My Bloody Valentine 3D|remake]] of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nInside a mine shaft, a female miner takes off her gear in front of another miner. When the woman performs a striptease, the miner pushes her onto a mining pickaxe, killing her.\n\nMayor Hanniger of Valentine Bluffs, a [[Canada|Canadian]] mining town, reinstates the traditional Valentine's Day dance, which has been suspended for twenty years. The dances stopped 20 years ago after an accident in which two supervisors left five miners in the mines to attend the dance. Because they forgot to check [[methane]] gas levels in the mining tunnels, there was an explosion that caused the mining tunnel to cave in and trapped the miners. Harry Warden, the only survivor, resorted to [[cannibalism]] to survive and went insane from the ordeal. The next year, he murdered the two supervisors who left their posts the previous year, cut out their hearts and placed them in Valentine candy boxes, with a note from Harry warning the town never to hold the Valentine's Day Dance ever again or he will commit more killings. Warden was placed in an insane asylum and the accident was forgotten, so the dance resumed. A group of young residents is excited about the dance: Gretchen, Dave, Hollis, Patty, Sylvia, Howard, Mike, John, Tommy, and Harriet. Sarah, Axel, and the mayor's son T.J. are involved in a tense love triangle.\n\nMayor Hanniger and the town's police chief Jake Newby receive an anonymous box of Valentine chocolates containing a human heart, and a note warning that murders will begin if the dance proceeds. That evening, resident Mabel is murdered by a mining-geared killer in a [[laundromat]], and her heart is removed. Newby publicly reports that she died of a heart attack to prevent a panic. He contacts the mental institution where Harry Warden was incarcerated, but they have no record of him. Hanniger and Newby cancel the dance but the town's youngsters decide to hold their own party at the mine. A bartender warns them against it but is killed by the miner while trying to set up a dummy miner to scare the group.\n\nAt the party, the miner brutally kills Dave; his heart is subsequently found boiling in a pot of hot dogs being prepared in the kitchen. Shortly after, Sylvia is impaled on a showerhead by the miner. When the others realize Dave and Sylvia have been murdered, they contact authorities, but several of the partygoers have already decided to enter the mines for fun. Newby rushes into the mines with police to rescue them. The miner impales a large drill into Mike and Harriet and shoots a nail gun into Hollis's head. Horrified, Howard flees. The remaining four try to climb to the top with a ladder but discover a dead beheaded Howard.\n\nWhile finding their way out, Axel drowns and Patty is killed by the miner. The miner chases T.J. and Sarah and a fight ensues. The miner is revealed to be Axel, who faked his demise. A flashback shows that Axel's father was one of the supervisors killed by Harry Warden. As a child, Axel witnessed Harry Warden murdering his father and tearing out his heart, which traumatized him. T.J. hits Axel with a rock, resulting in the tunnel collapsing, which traps Axel as Newby and the police arrive to rescue T.J. and Sarah. Chief Newby reveals to them that Harry Warden died five years earlier. T.J. and Sarah hear a rescuer shout that Axel is still alive, and they rush back to the scene. They watch as Axel frees himself from the debris by amputating his trapped arm. He runs deeper into the mine shouting threats that he and Harry Warden will return and murder everyone in town, and mumbling about Sarah being his \"bloody valentine\" (it seems to be implied that Axel's words are just words of [[insanity]] and [[blood loss]], which it is also implied that he is dying from). The film ends with Axel laughing maniacally as a ballad for Harry Warden plays over the film's credits.\n\n==Cast==\n* Paul Kelman as Tom Jesse \"T.J.\" Hanniger\n* [[Lori Hallier]] as Sarah Mercer\n* [[Neil Affleck]] as Axel Palmer\n** Jeff Banks as Young Axel Palmer\n* [[Cynthia Dale]] as Patty\n* [[Don Francks]] as Chief Jake Newby\n* [[Keith Knight (actor)|Keith Knight]] as Hollis\n* [[Alf Humphreys]] as Howard Landers\n* Terry Waterland as Harriet\n* Thomas Kovacs as Mike Stavinski\n* Helene Udy as Sylvia\n* Rob Stein as John\n* [[Patricia Hamilton]] as Mabel Osborne\n* Gina Dick as Gretchen\n* Larry Reynolds as Mayor Hanniger\n* Jim Murchison as Tommy Whitcomb\n* [[Carl Marotte]] as Dave\n* Jack Van Evera as \"Happy\"\n* Peter Cowper as [[Harry Warden|Harry Warden / The Miner]]\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Development===\nDirector George Mihalka, on the strength of his earlier movie ''Pick-Up Summer'', was approached by Cinepix Productions, headed by Andr\u00e9 Link and John Dunning with a two-movie contract.

But it is more restrained\u2014even tasteful\u2014than most. The camera averts its eyes from much of the blood and gore, and women are treated somewhat better than usual (that is, they are generally allowed to keep their clothes on before being dispatched)\".

It has been suggested that Paramount Pictures was keen to remove the offending footage due to the backlash they had received from releasing ''Friday the 13th'' the previous year.

This is given credence by the fact that Mihalka gave his seal of approval to this release, and a written introduction by him precedes the beginning of the special edition DVD/Blu-ray, stating that this version was the way that the film was meant to be seen.<ref name=bl/>\n\n===Home media===\n''My Bloody Valentine'' was released to both [[VHS|videotape]] and [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/23182/LV1447/My-Bloody-Valentine-(1981) | title='LaserDisc Database'|publisher=LaserDisc Database |access-date=July 16, 2016}}</ref> The film made its [[DVD]] debut on September 3, 2002 from Paramount Home Video;<ref name=2002dvd>{{cite AV media|publisher=Paramount Home Video|year=2002|title=My Bloody Valentine|orig-year=1981|medium=DVD|asin= B000069I04}}</ref> this was a standard widescreen release of the theatrical cut, and it contained no bonus materials.<ref name=2002dvd/> The same disc was re-issued as a DVD double feature with ''[[April Fool's Day (1986 film)|April Fool's Day]]'' (1986; also a Paramount title) in March 2008.<ref>{{cite AV media|publisher=Paramount Home Video|year=2002|title=My Bloody Valentine / April Fool's Day|medium=DVD|asin= B0017CW5TE}}</ref>\n\nThe aforementioned \"Special Edition\" DVD version of the film from Lionsgate was released in North America on January 13, 2009, coinciding with the theatrical release of the remake.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|url=http://www.papermag.com/my-bloody-valentine-special-edition-dvd-1425508601.html|title=My Bloody Valentine Special Edition DVD|date=January 11, 2009|author=''Paper'' Magazine Staff|access-date=March 13, 2018}}</ref> This version integrates the cut footage back into the film and features two featurettes and optional introductory sequences to the previously missing murder sequences.<ref name=uncut>{{cite web|work=[[Crave Online|ComingSoon.net]]|url=https://comingsoon.net/horror/news/712045-my-bloody-valentine-uncut-deleted-scenes|title=My Bloody Valentine Uncut: Deleted Scenes!|author=Turek, Ryan|date=December 30, 2008|access-date=March 13, 2018}}</ref> Two featurettes are also included.
