The film stars [[Nicole Kidman]] (who also co-produced) and [[Aaron Eckhart]] as a grieving couple coping with the death of their four-year-old son. It also stars [[Dianne Wiest]], [[Tammy Blanchard]], [[Miles Teller]] (in his feature film debut), [[Giancarlo Esposito]], [[Jon Tenney]], and [[Sandra Oh]].\n\n''Rabbit Hole'' had its world premiere at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival|35th Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 2010. The film received a [[limited theatrical release]] in the United States on December 17, 2010, before a [[wide release]] on January 28, 2011, by [[Lionsgate Films]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2010/09/breaking-in-toronto-lionsgate-buying-rabbit-hole-jumps-into-oscar-race-67735/|title=TORONTO: Lionsgate Buying 'Rabbit Hole'|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|date=September 16, 2010|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|access-date=March 6, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lionsgate-takes-trip-down-rabbit-27939|title=Lionsgate takes trip down 'Rabbit Hole'|last=Kilday|first=Gregg|date=September 16, 2010|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=March 6, 2021}}</ref> Kidman's performance was critically acclaimed and earned her nominations for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], a [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics' Choice Movie Award]], a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]], and a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]], among other accolades.\n\n==Plot==\nRebecca \"Becca\" Corbett and Howard \"Howie\" Corbett's four-year-old son Danny is killed in a car accident after he runs out into the street after his dog. Eight months on, Becca wants to give away Danny's clothes, remove Danny's things, and sell their house. Howie is angry at Becca's elimination of anything that reminds them of their child. Becca assumes Howie wants to have another child, but she refuses.\n\nBecca's mother, Nat, has also lost a son, Arthur (Becca's brother), who died of a drug overdose in his 30s. Becca states the two deaths are different situations, and thus not comparable. Becca's sister Izzy is pregnant, and Becca keeps giving Izzy passive-aggressive advice about becoming a mother, which Izzy resents.\n\nBecca and Howie attend group therapy, where Becca is irritated by some of the other members \u2013 particularly by one couple who attribute their own child's death to \"God's will\". Becca stops going to group, while Howie continues to attend the meetings without Becca. Meanwhile, long-time member Gabby starts coming to group alone, telling Howie that her husband also refuses to come to group therapy. One night before group he sees her high in her car, and asks to join her. They both start smoking pot in her car before the group therapy meetings. Eventually, they ditch meetings in favour of going to do things like bowling, where they almost begin an affair. However, Howie pulls away, stating that he is in love with his wife.\n\nMeanwhile, Becca starts meeting with Jason, the teenage driver of the car that hit Danny. She discovers he feels guilty and tells him she does not blame him for the accident. Jason tells her about a comic book he is writing called ''Rabbit Hole'', which is about [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]]. She asks to see it, and he tells her that she can see it when he is finished.\n\nBecca and Howie put their house on the market. The day of the open house, Howie decides to stay at the home for it. During the open house, he is in Danny's bedroom with an interested couple, who ask about his son. He tells them that his son died and they react awkwardly. After the open house, Jason brings his finished comic book to Becca and walks in unannounced through the door, which is still open from the open house. As Jason gives Becca the book, Howie realises who he is and gets angry. Becca tells Howie she has been meeting Jason. Howie is angered by this and demands that Jason leave immediately. Jason complies.\n\nBecca and Jason meet again, and talk about the content of the comic book \u2013 parallel lives. She realises that at this moment, she is living her \"sad\" self. There are many other versions of her that exists in other ways, and are not consumed by grief. Howie and Becca begin to have new activities, such as bowling and playing games, and they start to accept their son's death. Becca also comes to realize that her grief is like her own mother's, in that it will never stop.\n\nHowie and Becca decide to have a garden lunch. The scene begins with Howie telling Becca how the lunch would take place, subtly and incrementally interacting with a small group of trusted friends while life begins to feel normal again. Simultaneously, the screen fades into the lunch as Howie continues to speak in the background. The film ends with Becca and Howie sitting in their garden alone, after all their guests have left, staring into space. Becca reaches out to Howie and touches his hand. They hold hands affectionately as they continue to sit and stare into space.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Rebecca \"Becca\" Corbett\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as Howard \"Howie\" Corbett\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Nat\n* [[Miles Teller]] as Jason\n* [[Tammy Blanchard]] as Izzy\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Gabby\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Auggie\n* [[Jon Tenney]] as Rick\n* [[Stephen Mailer]] as Kevin\n* [[Mike Doyle (actor)|Mike Doyle]] as Craig\n* Roberta Wallach as Rhonda\n* [[Patricia Kalember]] as Peg\n* Ali Marsh as Donna\n* Yetta Gottesman as Ana\n* Colin Mitchell as Sam\n* [[Deidre Goodwin]] as Reema\n* Julie Lauren as Debbie\n* [[Rob Campbell]] as Bob\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Rabbit Hole'' was filmed primarily in the [[Bayside, Queens|Bayside]] neighborhood of the borough of [[Queens]], New York City.<ref name=NYTimes/> The $3.2 million production had a 28-day shoot.<ref name=NYTimes>Ryzik, Melena.

Lane writes \n<blockquote>On stage, Rabbit Hole is a tightly focused five-character drama punctuated with sharp, surprising flashes of aching humor. In the movie, however, supporting roles are trimmed into near irrelevance, elbowed into the background by the spotlight focused on Becca and Howie\u2014or, more bluntly, on Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart.\n\nHere\u2019s what David Lindsay-Abaire seems not to understand about his own play: It\u2019s like an [[atom]] in which the five characters are [[electron]]s revolving around the missing [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] that was Danny.... Without their nucleus, these electrons wobble and flail in their orbits, by turns clutching at and repelling one another.... In the movie, Rabbit Hole\u2019s symmetrical stage design is torn between the age-old pitfall of \u201copening up\u201d a play and the Hollywood urge to focus on Kidman and Eckhart (who are, after all, the stars).....The movie orbits Becca and Howie instead of the lost Danny.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/hare-line-fracture/content?oid=1905234|title=Hare-line fracture|author=Jim Lane|date=January 1, 2011|work=Film Review|access-date=December 15, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe director of a 2010 stage production of ''Rabbit Hole'', Robert A.
