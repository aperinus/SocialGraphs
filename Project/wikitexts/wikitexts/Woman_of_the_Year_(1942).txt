The film was written by [[Ring Lardner Jr.]] and [[Michael Kanin]] (with uncredited work on the rewritten ending by John Lee Mahin), and produced by [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]].\n\nThe film's plot is about the relationship between Tess Harding\u2014an international affairs correspondent, chosen \"Woman of the Year\"\u2014and Sam Craig\u2014a sportswriter\u2014who meet, marry, and encounter problems as a result of her unflinching commitment to her work.\n\nIn 1999, this film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Woman of the Year publicity photograph.jpg|thumb|left|Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in ''Woman of the Year'']]\nTess Harding ([[Katharine Hepburn]]) and Sam Craig ([[Spencer Tracy]]) are journalists for the (fictional) ''New York Chronicle''. Tess, the daughter of a former ambassador, is a highly educated, well-travelled political affairs columnist who speaks several languages fluently. Sam is a knowledgeable and well-informed sports writer. Their difficulties are presented as stemming from differences of class, experience and temperament, as well as from gender.\n\nAfter Tess suggests on the radio that baseball be abolished for the duration of [[World War II|the war]], Sam leaps to the sport's defense. Their editor summons them to his office: he will not stand for an intramural feud at his paper. Sam invites Tess to a baseball game at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. She is unfamiliar with the rules of the sport; Sam has some difficulty explaining them. Tess invites Sam to her apartment later that night. What he thought would be a date is actually a cocktail party where the guests are discussing the world situation in foreign languages. He leaves. She sends him champagne to apologize and asks him to take her to the airport so he can kiss her goodbye. On the drive back to town, Sam hits it off with Ellen Whitcomb ([[Fay Bainter]]), Tess's aunt, who is a world-famous feminist. She advises him to \"marry the girl.\"\n\nSam has his mind on a personable wedding, but it quickly escalates into a production. A justice of the peace in South Carolina is arranged by Gerald, Tess's ultra-competent secretary ([[Dan Tobin]]), to fit her schedule and that of her illustrious senator father ([[Minor Watson]]). Their wedding night is disrupted by the arrival of a Yugoslavian statesman who has just escaped from the Nazis, and a stream of European disciples. \n\nConflicts large and small arise over Tess's priorities and Sam's place in her life, beginning with her decision to have Sam move into her apartment instead of them choosing a place together. Her business continually comes before her personal life, with Sam largely reduced to the role of an aide. Sensing her husband is unhappy, Tess floats the idea of having a child, which Sam is warm to until Tess reveals that she has already agreed to adopt a young [[Greek refugee]] named Chris, who speaks no English. Sam is very upset, but hides his anger from the child. Before the couple can discuss the issue, they are interrupted by the news that Tess has been named \"America's Outstanding Woman of the Year\".\n\nTess plans to leave Chris by himself while they go to the award gala, while Sam, already not keen on the gala, states his refusal to leave the boy alone. While Tess is at her gala, Sam returns the child to the orphanage; Chris is thrilled to see his friends again. Tess returns home with a following of photographers and discovers that Sam and Chris are gone. She attempts to reclaim Chris, but he refuses, preferring to stay with his friends. The next day, Tess receives a telegram from her father, telling the couple to come to his home in Connecticut. Sam declines to join, and opines that their marriage has neither been \"perfect or a marriage.\" Tess comes home to learn that her aunt and father are finally to be married that night. The ceremony has all the reverence and grace that was lacking in the Craigs' wedding; Tess is moved to tears. She drives through the night and arrives at Sam's new Riverside apartment.\n\nAllowed in by a [[Building superintendent|super]], Tess decides to prepare Sam breakfast while he sleeps in. She is inept in the kitchen and Sam is awakened by the clatter. Tess confesses to Sam of her recent wedding experience, and proclaims her newfound inspiration to serve only as his wife. Sam asks Tess to walk back her overbearing dedication, and to assume the role of \"Tess Harding Craig\" rather than just \"Tess Harding\" or \"Mrs. Sam Craig\". She agrees. Gerald appears with a champagne bottle, announcing that Tess is expected to launch a battleship. Sam takes Gerald outside and returns with the broken bottle, announcing that he has just \"launched Gerald\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Sam Craig\n* [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Tess Harding\n* [[Fay Bainter]] as Ellen Whitcomb\n* [[Reginald Owen]] as Clayton\n* [[Minor Watson]] as William J.

Hepburn then passed the outline to [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] at MGM, and said the price was $250,000 \u2013 half for her, half for the script.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hepburn|first=Katharine|title=Me: Stories of My Life|url=https://archive.org/details/me00kath_0|url-access=registration|year=1991|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-679-40051-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/me00kath_0/page/400 400]}}</ref> He liked it and agreed to produce the movie.<ref>Hepburn (1991), p. 243.</ref> Kanin was fighting in the war at the time, so the script was written by his brother, [[Michael Kanin]], and mutual friend [[Ring Lardner Jr.]] Hepburn contributed significantly to the script \u2013 reading it, suggesting cuts and word changes, and generally providing helpful enthusiasm for the project.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kanin|first=Garson|title=Tracy and Hepburn: An Intimate Memoir|url=https://archive.org/details/tracyhepburnint00kani|url-access=registration|year=1971|publisher=Viking|location=New York|isbn=0-670-72293-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/tracyhepburnint00kani/page/81 81]}}</ref> As a part of the deal, Hepburn had the option of selecting her co-star and director (Tracy and Stevens).\n\n===Casting===\n''Woman of the Year'' was the first of nine films Hepburn and Tracy made together. They met for the first time on the shoot. In the 1993 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Katharine Hepburn: All About Me'', Hepburn herself says she was wearing high heels at the first meeting with Tracy and producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and said \"I'm afraid I'm a bit tall for you, Mr. Tracy\". Mankiewicz then responded, \"Don't worry, Kate, he'll cut you down to size.\" It was during the filming of ''Woman of the Year'' that Hepburn and Tracy became romantically involved \u2013 a relationship that lasted until Tracy's death in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=27562 |title=Film listing |website=www.afi.com|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>\n\n===Reshoots===\nThe film was originally shot with a different ending, but it proved unpopular at test screenings. The decision was made to change it, and the final fifteen minutes of the film were re-written and shot. In the original ending, Sam went missing after returning the child to the orphanage, while he was supposed to write an article about an upcoming boxing match. Tess decides to take over for him and visits the gym to learn about the fight. Sam, who is in a language school trying to learn French and Spanish to \"be important\", is shocked when he sees the article. He goes to the fight, where he encounters Tess. She insists that she did the work to be a \"good wife,\" and states her dedication to Sam. He says that he does not want either extreme; he just wants her to be \"Tess Harding Craig\" (as in the released ending).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Interview with Ring Lardner, Jr|journal=On Writing|date=August 1997|volume=7|url=http://www.brisbin.net/Tracy-Hepburn/Articles/T-H/Retrospective/thumbnails/origWOTYending.pdf|access-date=September 5, 2011|publisher=The Writers Guild of America, East, Inc}}</ref>\n\nRing Lardner Jr. describes in Archive of America Television oral history interviews (2000) that changes made to the ending of the film were against the wishes of Katharine Hepburn, and were implemented while both screenwriters were on vacation in New York.  The changes were instigated by [[Louis B. Mayer]], producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz and director George Stevens, with the actual new ending being written by John Lee Mahin (who was uncredited). In an interview, Lardner indicated that these parties all believed that Tess Harding \"had to get her comeuppance for being too strong in a man's world, so they wrote a scene where she tried to fix breakfast ... and gets everything wrong.\" Lardner and Kanin were given some room to rewrite the new ending on returning from New York, and in the same interview Lardner recalls \"some of the worst lines we rewrote, but we couldn't fix it, we couldn't change it fundamentally\".<ref>Archive of American Television - EMMY TVLEGENDS Ring Lardner interview 2000</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Woman of the Year (1942 poster - Style D).jpg|thumb|Alternate theatrical release poster]]\n\n===Box office===\nThe film earned $1,935,000 in the United States and Canada and $773,000 elsewhere during its initial release, making MGM a profit of $753,000.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/variety149-1943-01#page/n57/mode/1up \"101 Pix Gross in Millions\" ''Variety'' 6 Jan 1943 p 58]</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nAt the [[15th Academy Awards]], Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner Jr. won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and Katharine Hepburn was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\n[[American Film Institute]] included the film in the 2000 list [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] (#90)<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/laughs100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date=2000 |access-date=August 21, 2016}}</ref> and in 2002, in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]] (#74).<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/passions100.pdf |publisher=American Film Institute |date=2002 |access-date=August 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA 1976 remake of the film, made for television and starring [[Joseph Bologna]] and [[Renee Taylor]], was broadcast on [[CBS]].\n\nIn 1981, the film was adapted into a successful [[Woman of the Year (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]], starring [[Lauren Bacall]], who won a [[Tony Award]] for her work.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Woman of the year 1.jpg|\nFile:Woman of the year 2.jpg|\nFile:Woman of the year 3.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category|Woman of the Year (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0035567}}\n* {{AllMovie title|55086}}\n* {{AFI film|27562}}\n* {{TCMDb title|14145}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4514-woman-of-the-year-a-woman-s-place ''Woman of the Year: A Woman's Place''], an essay by [[Stephanie Zacharek]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Tracy Hepburn films}}\n{{George Stevens}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1942 films]]\n[[Category:1942 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1940s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1940s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Comedy of remarriage films]]\n[[Category:Films about journalists]]\n[[Category:Films directed by George Stevens]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Joseph L.
