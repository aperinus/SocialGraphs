Starring [[Guy Pearce]] and [[Freddie Highmore]], it tells the story about two [[Indochinese tiger]] brothers named Kumal and Sangha, who are separated from their parents as cubs and then reunited a year later as adults to find their way back home. It was distributed by Path\u00e9 in Europe and Universal Pictures in other countries worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=April 2022}}\nIn 1920s [[Cambodia]] during the [[Union of French Indochina|French colonial rule]], two [[Indochinese tiger]]s, a male and a female, meet each other and mate after becoming love interests. Months later, the tiger couple have given birth to two male tiger cub brothers.\n\nWhile the two tiger cubs are playing, one of them (later named Sangha) comes across a young [[viverrid|civet]]. Sangha chases the little civet into its burrow, but the mother appears and chases Sangha up a tree. The other tiger cub (later named Kumal) eventually appears and chases the mother civet back into her burrow. Unfortunately, humans come across them in their temple home and the tigress arrives to protect her cubs. She picks up Sangha and runs off for safety. Kumal attempts to follow, but can't keep up and falls behind. The cubs' father appears, but the men have caught up with them. The father is shot dead by a man named Aidan McRory after mauling porter in defense of his cub.\n\nMcRory is an unscrupulous but kind explorer, big-game hunter, author, and treasure hunter. He discovers Kumal and soon befriends him after having shot his father, but McRory is later arrested for stealing sacred statues from the ancient temple while Kumal is kept by the chief in the Cambodian village where McRory had been staying. The chief then sells Kumal to a circus owned by a cruel circus ringmaster named Zerbino, his wife (expected to have a baby soon), and his faithful sabre swallowing and fire breathing friend, Saladin who becomes Kumal\u2019s nemesis, where he is to be the star attraction soon.\n\nMcRory is soon released from prison by the French administrator, Eugene Normandin, due to being a big fan of McRory and all his exploits, but is not permitted to leave the country until all the formalities are completed within the three years sentencing. Nevertheless, McRory is permitted to stay at Eugene's home and is introduced to Eugene's wife, Mathilda who admires McRory and reads all his books as bedtime stories to their young son, Raoul.\n\nMeanwhile, Sangha remains in the jungle with his mother, but both are soon trapped by McRory as game for a vain [[Khmer people|Khmer]] prince to hunt. The tigress is shot in the left ear and although she is appearing to be dead, she suddenly jumps up and runs off with a hole in her left ear after being awakened and startled by the flash of a camera. Sangha is then discovered by Raoul and becomes the child's friend. However, Bitzy, Raoul's mother's dog, a [[schipperke]], is a constant nemesis to Sangha.\n\nKumal remains in a cage of the circus next to the cage of an old former tiger star named Caesar. In order to bring back the skin of the tigress for the prince, McRory makes a deal with Zerbino and Saladin to kill Caesar and skin him, thus, to pass off as the dead skinned tigress itself. Kumal is then replaced as the soon-to-be new star attraction of the circus in Caesar's cage with McRory's condition that the circus people take good care of him. However, the tiger skin trick is foiled when the prince's wife discovers the hole through the wrong ear; much to the prince's disappointment.\n\nSangha, meanwhile, settles peacefully with Raoul until he is at last cornered by Bitzy. After a prolonged chase, it results in Sangha attacking Bitzy in self-defense. This provokes a hysterical reaction from the household, particularly Raoul's mother (Mathilda), who insists that the cub has now \"got a taste of blood\" and Sangha is taken away for Raoul's own good. As a result, he is made a part of the prince's palace menagerie, where he quickly gains a reputation as a ferocious animal.\n\nA year later, Kumal, now an adult, is trained by Zerbino to do tricks, such as jumping through a flaming hoop after refusing to obey him and having been \"taught a lesson in manners\" by Saladin using harsh and cruel methods. Then, the prince decides to hold a festival in which a battle between two great beasts will be the centerpiece. Raoul understands that the prince's tiger is actually Sangha even before recognising him in the cage where the fight is to take place, despite his parents having made him believe that Sangha had been taken to a zoo in [[Bangkok]] or [[Saigon]]. McRory, however, is not pleased with the idea of Kumal being the opponent for the prince's ferocious animal (not knowing that Kumal is Sangha's brother either) since the circus people didn't keep their promise to take care of him, so he leaves the festival with the village chief's daughter, Na\u00ef-Rea, whom he's fallen in love with. Later, when placed in the cage before the audience during the festival, the two tiger brothers do not immediately recognize each other, and Kumal is afraid to fight. However, when they do finally recognize each other after a violent fight, they begin to play with each other like they used to in the past instead of fighting, which amuses the audience. The trainers see this and attempt to antagonize the tigers into fighting; resulting in Saladin hitting Kumal being suddenly attacked by Sangha, biting ferociously on his arm. Zerbino, with a gun in his hand, opens the gate to shoot Sangha; accidentally leaving the gate open. Kumal stops Zerbino from shooting his brother by attacking him as well. The two tiger brothers escape together through the open gate; causing panic among the people in the arena.\n\nAfter their escape, the two tigers play by causing chaos to people in the area such as: eating food on a bus, bathing in a woman's home, scaring a person next to a News Stand, scaring people crossing a bridge, and eating much meat in a butcher's truck. McRory is determined to hunt the two tigers down. After Kumal shows Sangha how to jump through fire (which McRory and the villagers started in order to scare them and finally have them cornered together to have a perfect shot of them) to escape, McRory and Raoul eventually find them. Raoul asks Sangha to promise him to never return to the villages of men as they will kill down and to stay in the jungle forever, to avoid being hunted. He kisses Sangha and removes the diamond necklace (formerly offered to the prince's wife as a gift) placed on the tiger's neck by the prince when he was in captivity.\n\nMcRory watches from the distance and takes aim at Sangha, but Kumal appears behind him: McRory puts down his gun, and Kumal demonstrates that he remembers the honey sweets McRory used to give him when he was only a cub: unfortunately, there aren't anymore sweets left, which makes McRory ask Kumal to forgive him. The tigers then make their way back to their old temple home in the jungle. McRory states that they are taking a big risk, but Raoul justifies that sometimes it's good to take a few risks, which McRory agrees to as well.\n\nRaoul and McRory watch the two tiger brothers leave; hoping they will find another tiger who might teach them how to hunt in the wild. In fact, in the jungle, Sangha and Kumal reunite with their mother, who is recognized by the hole in her left ear. Together, all three tigers find peace resting in the jungle by the stream.\n\n==Cast==\n* Kumal as Himself\n* Sangha as Himself\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Aidan McRory\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as Raoul Normandin\n* [[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]] as Administrator Eugene Normandin\n* Oanh Nguyen as His Excellency\n* Vincent Scarito as Zerbino\n* [[Moussa Maaskri]] as Saladin\n* [[Ma\u00ef Anh Le]] as Na\u00ef-Rea\n* [[Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu]] as Mrs. Mathilda Normandin\n*Jaran 'See Tao' Petcharoen as The Village Chief\n*St\u00e9phanie Lagarde as Miss Paulette\n*Bernard Flavien as His Excellency's Majordomo\n*Annop Varapanya as Sergent Van Tranh\n*David Gant as the Auctioneer\n*Teerawat Mulvilai as Verlaine\n*Somjin Chimwong as Napoleon\n*Nozha Khouadra\tas Mrs. Zerbino\n*Sakhorn Pring as Dignitary with Goldfish\n*Jerry Hoh as the Policeman\n*Juliet Howland as Auction Room Stylish Woman\n*Caroline Wildi as Auction Room Companion\n*Thavirap Tantiwongse as Photographer\n*B\u00f4 Gaultier de Kermoal as Circus Boy\n*Delphine Kassem as Fleeing Bathing Woman\n*Alan Fairbairn as Assistant to Auctioneer\n*Thomas Larget as Residency Butler\n*Hy Peahu as Dignitaries' Translator\n*Luong Ham Chao\tas Dignitary\n*Tran Hong as Dignitary\n*Chea Iem as Dignitary\n*Ngo Qui Yen as Dignitary\n*Mathias Ghiap as Residency Cook\n*Luong Hoan as Residency Servant\n*Sa\u00efd Serrari as Circus Boy\n*Gerard Tan as Circus Boy\n*Xavier Castano\tas the Butcher\n*Suban Phusoi as the Bus Driver\n*Christophe Cheysson as the News Stand Man\n* Mother Tiger as Herself\n* Father Tiger as Himself\n\n==Production==\nAround 30 tigers were used for the film, the majority from French zoos and others from Thailand.<ref name=\"prodtigers\">{{cite web |url = http://www.twobrothersmovie.net/main_site/main.php?size=large |title = Two Brothers - Universal's ''Two Brothers'' website |access-date = 2009-04-22 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140322084235/http://www.universalstudiosentertainment.com/two-brothers/?size=large |archive-date = 22 March 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"howtotigers\">{{cite web |url = http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=2561 |title = Two Brothers - Production Notes - How to Get Tigers to 'Act'}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Two Brothers'' opened at No.9 with $6,144,160 in its opening weekend (25\u201327 June).
