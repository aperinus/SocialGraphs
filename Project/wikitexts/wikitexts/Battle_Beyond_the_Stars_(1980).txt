Sador's huge dreadnought, the Hammerhead, mounts a \"Stellar Converter\", a weapon that turns planets into small stars. He demands that the peaceful Akira submit to him when he returns in \"seven risings of your red giant\", or he will turn his Stellar Converter on their planet. Zed ([[Jeff Corey]]), last of the famous Akira Corsairs, is old and nearly blind. He suggests they hire mercenaries to protect their world. Since Akir lacks valuable resources, its people can offer only food and shelter in payment. Unable to go in person, Zed offers his ship for the job if they can find a pilot. The ship is fast and well-armed, but, despite its [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] navigation/tactical computer Nell, cannot defeat Sador alone. Shad ([[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]]), a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to Nell, volunteers for the recruiting mission.\n\nSeeking weapons, Shad goes to the space station of Doctor Hephaestus ([[Sam Jaffe]]), an old friend of Zed. The station is populated mostly by androids, except for two humans: Hephaestus, whose numerous life support-systems have turned him into a cyborg, and his beautiful daughter Nanelia ([[Darlanne Fluegel]]), who looks after him and the androids. The doctor wants Shad to mate with his daughter, by force if necessary. Shad cannot bring himself to abandon his people; he persuades Nanelia to help him escape. She follows in her own ship; although she has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two split up to look for more mercenaries.\n\nShad encounters Cowboy ([[George Peppard]]), a freighter-pilot from Earth who is ambushed by Space Jackers while delivering a shipment of laser-handguns to the planet Umateal. Shad fights off the Jackers, thus saving Cowboy's life twice over; they arrive at Umateal just in time to watch Sador destroy the planet with his Stellar Converter. Lacking the fuel to carry his weapons back home, Cowboy offers them to Akir instead. Shad talks Cowboy into sharing his gunslinging experience with the Akira.\n\nLater, Shad meets a set of five alien [[Cloning|clones]] who share a group consciousness named Nestor. They admit their life is incredibly dull, since their whole race shares one mind. In order to be entertained, they have sent five members to join Shad's cause. Nestor does not require payment, saying they are completely self-sufficient. Next, Shad recruits Gelt ([[Robert Vaughn]]), a wealthy assassin who cannot show himself on any civilized planet for fear of retribution. Gelt offers his services in return for being allowed to live peacefully among the Akira. Gelt's ship is highly maneuverable and well-armed. On his way back to Akir, Shad is approached by Saint-Exmin ([[Sybil Danning]]) of the Valkyrie warriors. She is a headstrong woman looking to prove herself in battle. She pilots a small, but extremely fast ship with enhanced firepower. Shad finds her annoying and wishes she would go away, but she tags along.\n\nWhile waiting for Shad's return, Nanelia is captured by a reptilian slaver named Cayman of the Lazuli ([[Morgan Woodward]]). Cayman possesses a powerful ship with an eclectic crew of aliens. She explains to Cayman that they are seeking mercenaries for a war against Sador. Cayman takes up their cause in return for the head of Sador, who destroyed Cayman's homeworld years ago. Back on Akir, Shad's sister Mol is captured by two Malmori warriors with the intent to rape her. As Shad and Company return, their approach frightens the Malmori into attempting to escape. Mol, in retaliation, interferes with their controls, allowing Gelt the opportunity to destroy their ship, killing all three. Upon reaching the planet's surface, the heroes are greeted with caution by the natives, who are wary of violent species. When Sador returns, his Malmori forces are intercepted by Shad's hired warriors. Gelt dogfights his way to Hammerhead, which shoots him down. Cowboy and the laser-toting Akira ward off an invasion backed by a Malmori Sonic Tank. Many of Sador's troops are killed, and their Sonic Tank is destroyed; however, many Akira die as well, including Zed.\n\nAfter surviving an assassination attempt by Nestor, Sador launches the remainder of his fleet in a retaliatory strike against Akir. Saint-Exmin blows herself up to knock out Sador's Stellar Converter. Although Sador's aerospace forces are wiped out, Hammerhead picks off all the remaining mercenaries with laser battery-fire and nuclear missiles. Only Nell, piloted by Shad and Nanelia, survives the Malmori onslaught. Crippled and unable to fight, Nell is captured by Hammerhead's tractor beam. Nanelia and Shad activate Nell's self-destruct program, then flee their ship in an escape pod. Sador commands Nell to surrender. Instead she detonates, causing his Stellar Converter to backfire and disintegrate Hammerhead. As Shad and Nanelia return to Akir, Nanelia despairs over their friends' deaths. Shad shares with her the teachings of Akir's \"Varda\": nobody is truly dead when they have been loved and are celebrated by the living. The Akira will always remember the sacrifices made by the mercenaries, who will forever be honored in the legends of Akir.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] as Shad, a young Akira farmer who looks for mercenaries to save his people. Over the course of the story, he evolves into the next Akira Corsair, brother of the ill-fated Mol.\n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as Gelt, a notorious assassin with an intergalactic bounty on his head. Despite his vast riches, all he wants now is \"a meal and a place to hide\". Vaughn played Lee in ''The Magnificent Seven'', essentially the same character as Gelt.\n* [[John Saxon]] as  Sador, leader of the evil Malmori raiders, is very old and keeps himself alive using transplants to renew his body.

He is the former pilot of Shad's starship, whose system computer he affectionately calls \"Old Girl\".\n* [[Morgan Woodward]] as Cayman of the Lambda Zone, a Zymer and slaver who has a score to settle with Sador for destroying his species.\n* [[Marta Kristen]] as Lux, an Akira who works the [[early warning system]] and starts a relationship with Space Cowboy.\n* [[Earl Boen]] as  Nestor 1 the voice, usually, for the five clones.\n* John Gowens as Nestor 2.\n* [[Lynn Carlin]] as Nell's (voice), the computer which controls Zed's (now Shad's) starship. \"She\" is highly protective of Shad, whom she calls \"wet behind the ears\".

Up-and-coming screenwriter [[John Sayles]] had already written the Corman-produced [[The Lady in Red (1979 film)|''The Lady in Red'']] and [[Piranha (1978 film)|''Piranha'']], the latter of which was both a financial and critical success.

He had previously worked on Roger Corman's ''[[Humanoids from the Deep]]'' and ''[[The Lady in Red (1979 film)|The Lady in Red]]'', and the producer brought him back for ''Battle Beyond the Stars''. The score features several elements that would become regular staples of Horner's many [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Adventure film|adventure]] film scores. Several fans have noted similarities between these scores and those for later films, such as [[Krull (film)|''Krull'']] and ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. Horner would go on to become a regular collaborator with James Cameron, eventually winning an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] for [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']].\n\nThe [[supervising sound editor]], also responsible for special sound effects, such as Robert Vaughn's \"laser shot\"&nbsp;\u2013 based on [[Clint Eastwood]]'s [[.44 Magnum]] from ''[[Dirty Harry]]''{{sfn|Yewdall|2011|page=257}}&nbsp;\u2013 was [[David Yewdall]], a regular contract-worker for Corman films.{{sfn|Yewdall|2011|page=192}} Yewdall later remarked on the \"film's frugal sound editorial budget\" in his ''Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound'', and explained some of the movie's sounds: each of the seven spaceships had its own sound. The Nestor ship's sound was made from human voices generated by the community choir from his hometown college in [[Coalinga, California]]; Robert Vaughn's ship was based on the recording of a [[Drag racing|dragster]].{{sfn|Yewdall|2011|page=256}}\n\n===Casting===\nPrior to production, a Hollywood trade paper announced that [[John Wayne]] would star in the film, under the direction of [[Ingmar Bergman]].
