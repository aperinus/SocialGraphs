''Ivan's Childhood'' was one of several Soviet films of its period, such as ''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]'' and ''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]'', that looked at the human cost of war and did not glorify the war experience as did films produced before the [[Khrushchev Thaw]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite AV media |title=\"Life as a Dream\" |type=DVD |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |year=2007 |people=Vida T.

It won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1962 and the Golden Gate Award at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]] in 1962.

The film features a [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linear plot]] with frequent flashbacks.\n\nAfter a brief [[dream sequence]], Ivan Bondarev, a 12-year-old Russian boy, wakes up and crosses a war-torn landscape to a swamp, then swims across a river. On the other side, he is seized by Russian soldiers and brought to the young Lieutenant Galtsev, who interrogates him. The boy insists that he call \"Number 51 at Headquarters\" and report his presence. Galtsev is reluctant, but when he eventually makes the call, he is told by Lieutenant-Colonel Gryaznov to give the boy pencil and paper to make his report, which will be given the highest priority, and to treat him well. Through a series of dream sequences and conversations between different characters, it is revealed that Ivan\u2019s mother and sister (and probably his father, a border guard) have been killed by German soldiers. He got away and joined a group of partisans. When the group was surrounded, they put him on a plane. After the escape, he was sent to a boarding school, but he ran away and joined an army unit under the command of Gryaznov.\n\nBurning for revenge, Ivan insists on fighting on the front line. Taking advantage of his small size, he is successful on reconnaissance missions. Gryaznov and the other soldiers grow fond of him and want to send him to a military school. They give up their idea when Ivan tries to run away and rejoin the partisans. He is determined to avenge the death of his family and others, such as those killed at the [[Maly Trostenets extermination camp]] (which he mentions that he has seen).\n\nA subplot involves Captain Kholin and his aggressive advances towards a pretty army nurse, Masha, and Galtsev's own undeclared and probably shared feelings for her. Much of the film is set in a room where the officers await orders and talk, while Ivan awaits his next mission. On the walls are scratched the last messages of doomed prisoners of the Germans.\n\nFinally, Kholin and Galtsev ferry Ivan across the river late at night. He disappears through the swampy forest. The others return to the other shore after cutting down the bodies of two Soviet scouts hanged by the Germans.\n\nThe final scenes then switch to [[Berlin]] under Soviet occupation after the fall of the Third Reich. Captain Kholin has been killed in action. Galtsev finds a document showing that Ivan was caught and hanged by the Germans. As Galtsev enters the [[execution room]], a final flashback of Ivan's childhood shows the young boy running across a beach after a little girl in happier times. The final image is of a dead tree on the beach.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Nikolai Burlyayev]] as Ivan Bondarev\n*[[Valentin Zubkov]] as Capt. Kholin\n*[[Evgeny Zharikov]] as Lt. Galtsev\n*Stepan Krylov as Cpl.

The film is based on the 1957 short story ''Ivan'' ({{lang-ru|\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d}}) by [[Vladimir Bogomolov (writer)|Vladimir Bogomolov]], which was translated into more than twenty languages. It drew the attention of the screenwriter Mikhail Papava, who changed the story line and made Ivan more of a hero. Papava called his screenplay ''Second Life'' ({{lang-ru|\u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c}}, {{lang|ru-latn|Vtoraya Zhizn}}). In this screenplay Ivan is not executed, but sent to the concentration camp [[Majdanek]], from where he is freed by the advancing Soviet army. The final scene of this screenplay shows Ivan meeting one of the officers of the army unit in a train compartment. Bogomolov, unsatisfied with this ending, intervened and the screenplay was changed to reflect the source material.\n\n[[Mosfilm]] gave the screenplay to the young film director Eduard Abalov. Shooting was aborted and the film project was terminated in December 1960, since the first version of the film drew heavy criticism from the arts council, and the quality was deemed unsatisfactory and unusable. In June 1961 the film project was given to Tarkovsky, who had applied for it after being told about ''Ivan's Childhood'' by cinematographer [[Vadim Yusov]].<ref name=auto/> Work on the film resumed in the same month. The film was shot for the most part near [[Kaniv|Kanev]] at the [[Dnieper River]].\n\nTarkovsky continued his collaboration with cinematographer [[Vadim Yusov]], who was the cameraman in Tarkovsky's diploma film ''The Steamroller and the Violin''. Nikolai Burlyayev had played a role in [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]'s student film ''The Boy and the Pigeon''. Konchalovsky was a friend and fellow student of Tarkovsky at the [[All-Union State Institute of Cinematography|State Institute of Cinematography]] (VGIK), and thus Burlyayev was also cast for the role of Ivan. He had to pass several screen tests, but according to Burlyayev it is unclear whether anyone else auditioned for the role.<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=\"Nikolai Burlyayev Interview\" |type=DVD |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |year=2007 |people=Nikolai Burlyayev}}</ref> Burlyayev would later play Boriska in Tarkovsky's second feature, ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Image:Ivanovo-detstvo-2.jpg|thumb|Ivan in a destroyed village.

It attracted the attention of many [[intellectuals]], including [[Ingmar Bergman]] who said, \"My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle.
