It was first released in Spain during November, 2001, and then internationally on the [[film festival]] circuit in 2002.\n\nRooted in [[magical realism]], the film depicts an [[Black market|underground]] trade in ''luck'', where fortune flows from those who have less to those who have more; the premise purports that luck can be amassed and transferred as any other commodity. The story follows several participants as they engage in literal games of chance, each one more risky than the last, to eliminate the unlucky.\n\n== Plot ==\nA [[concentration camp]] survivor named Samuel Berg (Max von Sydow), a preternaturally lucky fellow, runs a [[Europe]]an [[casino]]. One of his workers is Federico (Eusebio Poncela), a man who \"steals\" other people's luck merely by laying a hand on them (a similar concept is used in the 2003 [[Las Vegas]] comedy-drama ''[[The Cooler]]'').\n\nWhen Samuel Berg has a falling out with Federico and takes away his powers, Federico sets out to find the luckiest man alive (Leonardo Sbaraglia), the lone survivor of a plane crash, in order to use his powers to overpower Samuel Berg in the one game he has never lost: [[Russian roulette]].\n\nFederico takes his partner through a series of tests in order to confirm his abilities. In the process, they approach the tightening circle of underground chance games that will eventually lead them both, and a female cop on their heels, to a final showdown with Samuel Berg.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Leonardo Sbaraglia]] as Tom\u00e1s\n*[[Eusebio Poncela]] as Federico\n*[[M\u00f3nica L\u00f3pez (actress)|M\u00f3nica L\u00f3pez]] as Sara\n*[[Antonio Dechent]] as Alejandro\n*[[Max von Sydow]] as Sam\n\n==Reception==\nThe review-aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 72 percent based on reviews from 72 critics, and a weighted average of 6.5 out of 10.
