[[Sandra Bullock]] stars as Gwen Cummings, a newspaper columnist obliged to enter [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] for [[alcoholism]]. The film costars [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Dominic West]], [[Elizabeth Perkins]], [[Azura Skye]], [[Steve Buscemi]], and [[Diane Ladd]].\n\n==Plot==\nGwen Cummings is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who spends her nights in a drunken haze with her boyfriend, Jasper. They arrive late and disheveled to her sister Lily's wedding, where Gwen knocks over the wedding cake and drunkenly steals a limousine, crashing into a house. Given a choice between jail time or 28 days in a rehab center, she chooses [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]].\n\nGwen is introduced to a variety of patients: [[hypersexual]] [[cocaine]] addict Oliver, former doctor Daniel, mother of two Roshanda, older addict Bobbi Jean, Dutch immigrant Gerhardt, and Gwen\u2019s roommate Andrea, a teenage [[heroin]] addict. Angry and resistant, Gwen refuses to take part in treatment or admit she is an alcoholic, but struggles with [[flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s of her mother, an addict who died of an overdose when Gwen and Lily were children.\n\nOn visiting day, Jasper slips Gwen a bottle of [[painkillers]] and they sneak off for an inebriated day together. Cornell, the facility\u2019s director and a recovering addict himself, prepares to kick Gwen out to serve her jail sentence, but she still denies that she has a problem. Storming back to her room, she takes one of her smuggled pills, but spits it out and tosses the bottle out of her third-story window. After spending the day suffering [[Cold turkey|withdrawal symptoms]] alone, she climbs out of the window to retrieve the pills. She falls, severely spraining her ankle, and is rescued by Eddie, a new patient.\n\nFinally convinced that she has a problem, Gwen asks Cornell for another chance and begins to participate in the recovery process. Jasper visits and proposes to Gwen with champagne, which she throws in the lake. Returning to her room, she stops Andrea from [[self-harm|cutting herself]], and grows closer to her and their fellow addicts, who warn that Jasper does not take her [[sobriety]] seriously. Gwen learns that Eddie is a professional baseball player, and they share an impulsive kiss but form a friendship instead. Discovering that he is a fan of ''Santa Cruz'', Andrea\u2019s favorite [[soap opera]], Gwen and the group begin watching it together.\n\nLily attends a [[group therapy]] session, revealing that a drunken Gwen ruined her wedding with a humiliating speech, and leaves in disgust when Gwen dismisses Lily\u2019s feelings. Andrea will soon be released, and Gwen arranges a farewell skit for the group to perform. Jasper shows up unannounced, finding Gwen with Eddie; picking a fight, he insults them both and Eddie punches him, straining his friendship with Gwen. She discovers Andrea dead in their bathroom from an overdose, and commits herself to restoring her relationship with her sister. They reconcile and Gwen leaves treatment, but not before Eddie warns her that Jasper is dangerous to her [[sobriety]].\n\nJasper offers to make amends, but Gwen realizes he is unwilling to change to support her recovery. Leaving him and their old party friends at a bar, she encounters a horse on the street and is able to [[Horse grooming#Cleaning the feet|lift its hoof]], an activity she struggled with in rehab. She breaks up with Jasper, and is later reunited with a sober Gerhardt at a floral shop. In a post-credits scene, Eddie recognizes an actor from ''Santa Cruz'' who arrives as a new patient.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Gwen Cummings: the film's [[protagonist]]; a newspaper columnist with drug and alcohol problems\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Eddie Boone: a patient in rehab and a famous baseball player, who is addicted to alcohol, drugs, and sex\n* [[Dominic West]] as Jasper: Gwen's boyfriend and an alcoholic; he considers Gwen's recovery a joke\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Lily Cummings: Gwen's older sister who gets married at the beginning of the film, and has always been dismissive of her younger sister's struggles\n* [[Azura Skye]] as Andrea Delaney: a 17-year-old heroin addict\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Cornell Shaw: a recovering addict who now works as one of the counselors in the rehab clinic\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Dutch Gerhardt: a patient in rehab and a dancer.
