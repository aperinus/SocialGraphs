Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], written by the writing team of [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Edward Miller]] and [[Zack Stentz]] along with [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]], and stars [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the title character]] alongside [[Natalie Portman]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Colm Feore]], [[Ray Stevenson]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. After reigniting a dormant war, Thor is banished from [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]] to Earth, stripped of his powers and his hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mj\u00f6lnir]]. As his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] (Hiddleston) plots to take the Asgardian throne, Thor must prove himself worthy.\n\n[[Sam Raimi]] first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on ''Thor'' in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in \"[[development hell]]\" for several years. During this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until Marvel signed [[Mark Protosevich]] to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount. [[Matthew Vaughn]] was assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in [[California]] and [[New Mexico]] from January to May 2010. The film was converted to [[3-D film|3D]] in post-production.\n\n''Thor'' premiered in Sydney on April 17, 2011, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It received generally positive reviews from critics and was a financial success, earning $449.3 million worldwide. Three sequels have been released: ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013), ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), and ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2022).\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 965 AD, [[Odin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Odin]], king of [[Asgard (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Asgard]], wages war against the [[Frost Giants (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Frost Giants]] of [[Jotunheim (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jotunheim]] and their leader [[Laufey (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Laufey]], to prevent them from conquering the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Nine Realms|Nine Realms]], starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants in [[T\u00f8nsberg]], [[Norway]], and seize the source of their power, the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Casket of Ancient Winters|Casket of Ancient Winters]].\n\nIn the present,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008) and ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the latter of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Odin's son [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants, secretly allowed in by his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by Loki, childhood friend [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Volstagg]], [[Fandral (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Fandral]], and [[Hogun (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mj\u00f6lnir]], now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\n\nThor lands in [[New Mexico]], where astrophysicist [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dr. Jane Foster]], her assistant [[Darcy Lewis]], and mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Phil Coulson]] soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Foster's data about the [[wormhole]] that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mj\u00f6lnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed, but he finds himself unable to lift it and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.\n\nLoki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. Loki confronts Odin, who wearily falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifrost (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bifr\u00f6st]]\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor proves himself worthy by his sacrifice to wield Mj\u00f6lnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Foster goodbye and vowing to return, he leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.\n\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; meanwhile, on Earth, Foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Selvig is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object,{{refn|name=Tesseract|group=N|Identified off-screen as the [[Tesseract (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tesseract]].<ref name=\"Tesseract\" /><ref name=\"Tesseract2\" />}} which Fury says may hold untold power.

Director [[Kenneth Branagh]] and Marvel Studios chief [[Kevin Feige]] chose Hemsworth after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was initially dropped from consideration and then given a second chance to read for the part.<ref name=\"hemsworth\" /> Hemsworth stated that he gained {{convert|20|lb|kg|0}} for the role by eating non-stop and revealed that \"It wasn't until ''Thor'' that I started lifting weights, it was all pretty new to me.\"<ref name=\"Shira\" /> Regarding his take on the character, Hemsworth said, \"We just kept trying to humanize it all, and keep it very real. Look into all the research about the comic books that we could, but also bring it back to 'Who is this guy as a person, and what's his relationship with people in the individual scenes?{{Single double}}<ref name=\"huver\" /> About approaching Thor's fighting style, he remarked, \"First, we looked at the comic books and the posturing, the way [Thor] moves and fights, and a lot of his power seems to be drawn up through the ground. We talked about boxers, you know, [[Mike Tyson]], very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time, and then as we shot stuff things became easier.\"<ref name=\"Warmoth\" /> [[Dakota Goyo]] portrays a young Thor.\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]]: <br />A scientist and Thor's love interest. Marvel Studios stated in an announcement that the character was updated from the comics' initial portrayal for the feature adaptation.<ref name=\"portman\" /> When asked why she took the role, Portman replied, \"I just thought it sounded like a weird idea because Kenneth Branagh's directing it, so I was just like, 'Kenneth Branagh doing ''Thor'' is super-weird, I've gotta do it.{{Single double}}<ref name=\"portmanthorweird\" /> Portman stated that she really wanted to do a big effects film that emphasized character, and getting to do it with Branagh was a new way of approaching it, relative to ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> Regarding her preparation for the role Portman remarked, \"I signed on to do it before there was a script. And Ken, who's amazing, who is so incredible, was like, 'You can really help create this character'. I got to read all of these biographies of female scientists like [[Rosalind Franklin]] who actually discovered the [[Nucleic acid double helix|DNA double helix]] but didn't get the credit for it. The struggles they had and the way that they thought&nbsp;\u2013 I was like, 'What a great opportunity, in a very big movie that is going to be seen by a lot of people, to have a woman as a scientist'. She's a very serious scientist. Because in the comic she's a nurse and now they made her an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]]. Really, I know it sounds silly, but it is those little things that makes girls think it's possible. It doesn't give them a [role] model of 'Oh, I just have to dress cute in movies'\".<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n[[File:TomHiddlestonApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiddleston promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]: <br />Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the deity [[Loki|of the same name]]. Hiddleston was chosen after previously working with Branagh on ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' and ''[[Wallander (British TV series)|Wallander]]''.<ref name=\"hiddleston\" /> Initially, Hiddleston auditioned to play Thor but Branagh decided his talent would be better harnessed playing Loki. Hiddleston stated that the character was \"a comic book version of [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', but nastier.\" Hiddleston had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because Branagh wanted \"Loki to have a lean and hungry look, like [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. Physically, he can't be posing as Thor\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMay2009\" /> Hiddleston looked at [[Peter O'Toole]] as inspiration for Loki as well, explaining, \"Interestingly enough, [Kenneth Branagh] said to look at Peter O'Toole in two specific films, ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''. What's interesting about ... his performance [as King Henry] is you see how damaged he is. There's a rawness [to his performance]; it's almost as if he's living with a layer of skin peeled away. He's grandiose and teary and, in a moment, by turns hilarious and then terrifying. What we wanted was that emotional volatility. It's a different acting style, it's not quite the same thing, but it's fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as O'Toole head for those great high hills\".<ref name=\"Storm\" /> Ted Allpress portrays a young Loki.\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />A scientist doing research in New Mexico who encounters Thor.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> Skarsg\u00e5rd stated that he was not initially familiar with the comic book version of Thor.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> As to why he took the part, Skarsg\u00e5rd remarked, I \"chose ''Thor'' because of [director] Kenneth Branagh. The script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us. So I had a very happy time on it. What I always try to do is immediately do something I just haven't done so I get variation in my life. I've made about 90 films and if I did the same thing over and over again I would be bored by now.

And if you've seen any of the Frost Giants, you know that I am, of course, the [[Napoleon]] of Frost Giants. We've got some massive, fabulous guys who dwarf me and come in at around eight-and-a-half feet, nine feet. But, no. Can't you tell by the commanding presence? I am the boss\".<ref name=\"feoreaudio\" /> He said the Shakespearean training he shared with Hopkins and director Branagh helped keep production moving briskly, saying that \"during the breaks, Tony, myself and Ken would be talking in Shakespearean shorthand about what the characters were doing, what we thought they may be like, and how we could focus our attention more intelligently. These were discussions that took no more than a few minutes between takes, but they allowed Ken, Tony and [me] to understand each other instantly without Ken taking an hour away to explain to the actors exactly what was going on. So that was enormously helpful.\"<ref name=\"Seeton\" />\n* [[Ray Stevenson]] as [[Volstagg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Volstagg]]: <br />A member of the [[Warriors Three (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Warriors Three]], a group of three Asgardian adventurers who are among Thor's closest comrades, known for both his hearty appetite and wide girth.<ref name=\"three\" /> Stevenson previously worked with Kenneth Branagh in the 1998 film ''[[The Theory of Flight]]'', and with Marvel Studios as the titular character in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''. Stevenson wore a [[fat suit]] for the role, stating, \"I've tried the suit on, and what they've done is kind of sex him up: he's sort of slimmer but rounder.\". Stevenson said, \"He's got every bit of that [[Falstaff]]ian verve and vigor, and a bit of a beer gut to suggest that enormous appetite, but he's not the sort of [[Weeble]]-shaped figure he is in the comics. He's Falstaff with muscles. I've got this amazing foam-injected undersuit that flexes with me.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n* [[Idris Elba]] as [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]]: <br />The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian sentry of the [[Bifrost (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|bifr\u00f6st bridge]], based on the mythological deity [[Heimdall|of the same name]].<ref name=\"elba\" /> Elba said Branagh's involvement was a major incentive to take the role: \"[Branagh] called me up personally and said, 'I know this isn't a big role, but I would really love to see you play it.' It's Kenneth Branagh. I was like, 'Definitely'\".<ref name=\"Bierly\" /> About the role Elba remarked, \"I did green screen for the first time! I wouldn't like to do a whole movie of green screen, though. You kind of forget the plot a little\u2014like being in a Broadway play and doing it over and over and forgetting your line halfway through\".<ref name=\"Gornstein\" /> Elba stated he has made a four-picture commitment with Marvel Studios.<ref name=Truitt /> Elba's casting prompted a proposed boycott by the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] and a debate amongst comic book fans, some insisting it was wrong for a black man to play a Nordic god. In response Elba called the debate \"ridiculous\".<ref name=\"Belonsky\" /><ref name=\"McClintock\" /><ref name=\"Child\" />\n* [[Kat Dennings]] as [[Darcy Lewis]]: <br />A political science major who is Jane Foster's intern.<ref name=\"darcy\" /> Dennings described her character as Foster's \"little helper [[gnome]]\".<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> Dennings stated that her role was expanded during the rehearsal process.<ref name=\"Murray\" /> Dennings explained, \"She's kind of like a cute, clueless, little puppy or maybe a hamster. There wasn't much on the page for the Darcy role to begin with and I didn't even see a script before I took the job so I didn't really know who Darcy was at first. But she really evolved\u2014she's so much fun now even. She's very [[Scooby-Doo]] if that makes sense.

About the film he said, \"It's a superhero movie, but with a bit of [[Shakespeare]] thrown in\".<ref name=\"Carroll\" /> Hopkins stated, \"I'm very interested in that relationship between fathers and sons\", and that, \"My father's relationship with me was cold. He was a hot-blood character but to me, cold. When I was young, he expressed his disappointment because I was bad in school and all of that. He didn't mean any harm, but I felt I could never meet up to his expectations.\" Hopkins expressed that he found a personal resonance in the Odin role, saying, \"He's a stern man. He's a man with purpose. I play the god who banishes his son from the kingdom of Asgard because he screwed up. He's a hot-headed, temperamental young man... probably a chip off of the old block but I decide he's not really ready to rule the future kingdom, so I banish him. I'm harsh and my wife complains and I say, 'That is why I'm king.' He's ruthless, take-it-or-leave-it. Women are much more forgiving; men are not so forgiving. I know in my life, my karma is, 'If you don't like it, tough, move on.' And I move on. I'm a little like Odin myself\".<ref name=\"Boucher\" /> In May 2016, [[Mel Gibson]] stated he was approached about the role but \"didn't do it\".<ref name=\"MelGibson\" />\n* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as [[Hogun (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hogun]]: <br />A member of the Warriors Three, primarily identified by his grim demeanor and as the only member who is not an [[\u00c6sir]].<ref name=\"three\" /> Ray Stevenson said of Asano's character, \"He doesn't speak much but when he does, everybody shuts up.

He would like to think of himself, I was saying, as the [[R. Kelly]] of Asgard. He's a lover, not a fighter\". Dallas mentioned that [[Errol Flynn]] was an inspiration for the character stating, \"He was a big inspiration for the character and for me.

By September 2008 [[D. J.

He described it as \"a human story right in the center of a big epic scenario.\"<ref name=\"Branagh\" /> Branagh stated that he hoped to begin filming in January 2010,<ref name=\"Wigler2\" /> and Marvel Studios set back the release date of the film from its scheduled July 16, 2010 date to June 17, 2011, almost a full year later.<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> They later moved the release date to May 20, 2011, to distance the film's release from that of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', another Marvel Studios film that was scheduled to be released on July 22, 2011.<ref name=\"may20\" /> In October 2008, [[Daniel Craig]] was offered the role, but ultimately turned it down, citing his commitments to the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' franchise]].<ref name=\"Craig\" />\n\nIn February 2009, [[Samuel L. Jackson]], who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury at the end of the film ''Iron Man'', signed on to reprise the role in ''Thor'' as part of an unprecedented nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"samjackson\" /> In the same month, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor.<ref name=\"Brady\" /> However, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in ''Thor''. When asked why not Jackson explained, \"I have no idea. I'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. I thought I was; they said I was in the trades, and I was like, 'Ooh! I got a job!' I called my agent he said, 'Naw, you're not in it.' I was like, 'Well shit, they need to pay me if they're gonna put my name in it.{{Single double}}<ref name=\"Yamato\" /> Later in the month, Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for ''Thor'' to serve as \"connective tissue\" for ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"Davis2\" />\n\nIn May 2009, [[Chris Hemsworth]] was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, [[Liam Hemsworth|Liam]] also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]].<ref name=\"hemsworth\" /> [[Kevin McKidd]] had also been considered for the role.<ref name=\"McKidd\" /> The next day, Marvel announced that [[Tom Hiddleston]], who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki.<ref name=\"hiddleston\" /> In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on.<ref name=\"feigehemsworth\" /> Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included.<ref name=\"feigehemsworth\" /> In July 2009, Marvel announced that [[Natalie Portman]] would portray Jane Foster.<ref name=\"portman\" /> [[Jaimie Alexander]] and [[Colm Feore]] were reported to have joined the cast in September, with Alexander portraying [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain.<ref name=\"alexander\" /> In an interview with Swedish news site ''Ystads Allehanda'', [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> By late October [[Anthony Hopkins]] had been cast as [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] in the film.<ref name=\"hopkins\" /> The following month, Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three; Fandral was to be played by [[Stuart Townsend]], Hogun was to be played by [[Tadanobu Asano]] and Volstagg was to be played by [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]].<ref name=\"three\" /> [[Idris Elba]] was announced to have joined the cast, portraying Heimdall.<ref name=\"elba\" /> Natalie Portman revealed that [[Kat Dennings]] would be involved in the project, portraying Darcy, a coworker of Portman's Jane Foster.<ref name=\"darcy\" /><ref name=\"kat\" />\n\nIn December 2009, [[Rene Russo]] was cast as [[Frigga (Marvel Comics)|Frigga]], Thor's mother and Odin's wife.<ref name=\"frigga\" /> Later that month, actors Joseph Gatt, [[Troy Brenna]], and Josh Coxx had been cast in the film, though none of their roles were revealed.<ref name=\"newactors\" /> In January 2010, Adriana Barraza had joined the film's cast, in a supporting capacity.<ref name=\"barraza\" /> Only days before filming began, Stuart Townsend was replaced by [[Joshua Dallas]] as Fandral, citing \"creative differences\".<ref name=\"townsendexit\" /> When ''[[Spider-Man 4]]''{{'}}s production stalled, Paramount and Marvel Entertainment pushed up the release of ''Thor'' by two weeks to May 6, 2011.<ref name=\"date\" />\n\nThe [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] introduced Marvel Entertainment, Kenneth Branagh, \"the screenwriter, and a few people on the design and production side of things\" to three physicists ([[Sean M.

The consultation resulted in a change in Jane Foster's profession, from nurse to particle physicist, and the terminology ([[Einstein-Rosen bridge]]) to describe the [[Bifrost Bridge]].<ref name=\"SEE\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:KennethBranaghApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Director [[Kenneth Branagh]] promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\nIn October 2008, Marvel Studios signed a long-term lease agreement with Raleigh Studios to photograph their next four films\u2014''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor'', ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''\u2014at Raleigh's [[Manhattan Beach, California]] facility.<ref name=\"RaleighStudios\" /> ''Production Weekly'' reported that filming on Marvel's ''Thor'' was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles mid-January, then move to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] from March until late-April.<ref name=\"Baxter\" /> [[Principal photography]] began on January 11, 2010.<ref name=\"thorfilmingbegins\" /> A few days after filming began, Clark Gregg signed on to reprise his role from ''Iron Man'' and ''Iron Man 2'' as Agent Coulson.<ref name=\"coulson\" /> In February, Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with [[Del Mar, California]] to use a 300-yard stretch of beach to film a scene for ''Thor'' involving six horses running down the terrain. Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film.<ref name=\"delmar\" /> On March 15, 2010, production of ''Thor'' moved to [[Galisteo, New Mexico]] where [[Cerro Pelon Ranch]],<ref name=\"CerroPelonRanch\" /> an old-fashioned Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.<ref name=\"Bord\" /><ref name=\"Paramount\" />\n\nBranagh, a fan of the comic book since childhood, commented on the challenge of bridging Asgard and the modern world: \"Inspired by the comic book world both pictorially and compositionally at once, we've tried to find a way to make a virtue and a celebration of the distinction between the worlds that exist in the film but absolutely make them live in the same world. It's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds. If it succeeds, it will mark this film as different.... The combination of the primitive and the sophisticated, the ancient and the modern, I think that potentially is the exciting fusion, the exciting tension in the film\".<ref name=\"Boucher3\" />\n\nBy April, the prospect for filming parts of ''Thor'' in [[Del Mar, California]] had fallen through. Paramount Pictures sent a letter informing the city that it has instead chosen an undisclosed [[Northern California]] location to film a beachfront scene for the film. The letter cited cost concerns with moving production too far away from its headquarters.<ref name=\"Horn\" /> Filming wrapped on May 6, 2010.<ref name=\"huver\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Bifrost sequence in Thor (film).jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = HubblePAO.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer            = The film's [[Bifr\u00f6st]] travel sequences (top) were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography (bottom).\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nIn October 2010, casting calls revealed the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots.<ref name=\"rehoots\" /> In March 2011, scenes involving [[Adriana Barraza]] were removed from the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future. In response Barraza stated, \"It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut\".<ref name=\"Esmas\" /> Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. In that same month, [[Douglas Tait (actor)|Douglas Tait]] revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants.<ref name=\"tait\" /> On his hiring, Tait said \"I am 6'5\" and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7\" and taller, and weighed over {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=out}}. When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants\".<ref name=\"tait\" /> In April 2011, the [[IMAX Corporation]], Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in [[IMAX 3D]], continuing the partnership which began on ''Iron Man 2''.<ref name=\"imax\" /> Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said \"We came to feel that in our case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience\". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the \"special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D\".<ref name=\"3d\" /> The [[post-credits scene]] that sees [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by ''The Avengers''{{'}}s director, [[Joss Whedon]].<ref name=\"Hewitt\" />\n\n[[BUF Compagnie]] served as the lead [[visual effects]] vendor working on the film,<ref name=\"bufcompagnie\" /> with [[Digital Domain]] also providing work on the film.<ref name=\"digitaldomain\" /> some of the software used for the visual effects were [[Autodesk Softimage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=1306 |title=THOR: Jonathan Harb \u2013 VFX Supervisor & Founder \u2013 Whiskytree |author=Vincent Frei |publisher=The Art of VFX |date=June 27, 2011 |access-date=July 18, 2011 |archive-date=August 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803045607/http://www.artofvfx.com/?p=1306 |url-status=live }}</ref> Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography and other images of deep space.

So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifr\u00f6st and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo.<ref name=\"Frei\" /> In the film, Odin enters what is known as the \"Odinsleep\" in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, \"For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space\".<ref name=\"Frei\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Thor (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nThe film's score was written by composer [[Patrick Doyle]], a frequent collaborator of Branagh. Doyle described ''Thor'' as \"the most commercially high profile film I have done since ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Frankenstein]]''\",<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find a tone that fit the duality of Asgard and Earth. Thus Doyle and Branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction,<ref name=\"MotG\" /> with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having a balance between the music and \"grand images [that] were not in any way hyperbolized\", and the composer in turn implementing \"a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work\". As Doyle declared that his own [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] background made him familiar with Norse mythology, an old Celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for Thor's leitmotif.<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> A soundtrack album was released by [[Buena Vista Records]] in April 2011.<ref name=\"filmmusicreporter\" />\n\nThe film also features a song by the [[Foo Fighters]], \"[[Walk (Foo Fighters song)|Walk]]\", in both a scene where a powerless Thor shares some [[Boilermaker (beer cocktail)|boilermakers]] with Selvig in a roadhouse, and the film's closing credits. Marvel president Kevin Feige stated that \"Walk\" was a last minute addition, that the crew felt had \"these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes\" upon hearing it. Branagh in particular thought that \"these lyrics about learning to walk again\" were appropriate \"of [a] movie about redemption, learning to be a hero.\"<ref name=\"Boucher4\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Thor Comic-Con Panel.jpg|thumb|right|Hemsworth, Portman, Dennings and Hiddleston at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn July 2010 Marvel Studios held a ''Thor'' panel at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] during which Kenneth Branagh, Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg discussed the film and showed some clips from it.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> A few days later, this footage was leaked on the internet.<ref name=\"Fleming6\" /> The first television advertisement was broadcast during [[Super Bowl XLV]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in the United States.
