This article is at 664. Please do not add to it without checking/updating wordcount.-->\n\nSupervillain Megamind and his arch-nemesis, the superhero Metro Man, are both aliens who were sent to Earth as infants before their planets were sucked into a [[black hole]]. Though both land in Metro City at the same time, Metro Man is raised in a mansion, while Megamind is raised in a prison. He goes to the same school as Metro Man, who is well-liked by his classmates. Megamind is bullied by everyone until he concludes his purpose is to be a supervillain, setting off a rivalry between him and Metro Man. As an adult, Megamind, aided by his fish-like companion Minion, frequently and unsuccessfully battles Metro Man for control of the city.\n\nAt the grand opening of the new Metro Man Museum, Megamind escapes prison, kidnaps reporter Roxanne Ritchi, and lures Metro Man to an abandoned observatory to rescue her. Once there, Metro Man collapses, saying the copper-lined observatory roof weakens his powers; Megamind then blasts Metro Man with a sun-powered weapon, apparently killing him. Overjoyed that he has finally won, Megamind takes over the city and goes on a crime spree. However, he eventually becomes depressed and purposeless with no hero to fight.\n\nMegamind decides to blow up the Metro Man museum to forget the hero, but sees Roxanne there and dehydrates the museum's curator, Bernard, into a small cube. Disguised as Bernard using [[hologram]] technology, Megamind talks to Roxanne, whose remarks inspire him to use Metro Man's DNA to create a new superhero to fight. Megamind perfects the formula, but accidentally injects it into Hal Stewart, Roxanne's dimwitted cameraman who is infatuated with her.\n\nDisguising himself via hologram as Hal's \"Space Dad\", Megamind offers to train Hal to become a superhero. Hal, seeing this as a chance to get with Roxanne, accepts and takes on the name \"Titan\", though he misspells it as \"Tighten\". Megamind begins to date Roxanne in the guise of Bernard, and he and Minion have a falling out over Megamind's apparent lack of interest in committing further crimes. Roxanne rejects Tighten when he comes to court her, and Tighten later witnesses her on a date with \"Bernard\". After a heartbroken Tighten leaves, Megamind's \"Bernard\" disguise fails, and Roxanne rejects him as well.\n\nMegamind arranges to fight Tighten the next day, but Tighten does not show up. Megamind learns that Tighten is now using his powers on a crime spree. Tighten offers to ally with Megamind, but the latter deliberately reveals his disguises and deceptions, hoping to goad Tighten into fighting. Angered, Tighten savagely beats Megamind in the fight. Realizing that Tighten has no interest in justice and means to kill him, Megamind traps Tighten in a ball of copper. However, Tighten easily breaks out. Megamind and Roxanne escape to Metro Man's old hideout, and discover that Metro Man is still alive, having faked his weakness and death to pursue his dream as a musician. He refuses to help, but asserts that a hero will always rise to defeat evil.\n\nDejected, Megamind willingly returns to prison. Tighten goes on a rampage, demanding to fight Megamind, and threatening to kill Roxanne when she tries to reason with him. With Minion's help, Megamind escapes prison, using holographic disguises to make himself appear as Metro Man, and Minion as Megamind, to frighten Tighten away and rescue Roxanne. However, Megamind's speech patterns give him away, and Tighten attacks Megamind, throwing him into the [[stratosphere]]. Dehydrating himself into a cube and landing safely in a fountain, Megamind rehydrates next to Tighten and extracts the DNA from him, removing his powers. After Hal is arrested, Megamind and Roxanne rekindle their relationship, while the city celebrates Megamind as their new hero. The museum is rebuilt in Megamind's honor, and a disguised Metro Man cheers for him at the grand opening ceremony.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Minion discovers the real Bernard has been rehydrated in the washing machine. Bernard complains it has been the worst day of his life, before Minion knocks him out with a [[club (weapon)|forget-me stick]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 420\n| image1 = Will Ferrell as MegaMind by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| image2 = Tina Fey by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| image3 = Jonah Hill by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| footer = Left to right: Will Ferrell (in costume), Tina Fey, and Jonah Hill at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]\n| footer_align = center\n}}\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Megamind, a blue-skinned, humanoid alien [[supervillain]] with a large [[cranium]].

They begin by selling off their old gadgets from their former evil lair, as Megamind does not think heroes should use devices associated with evil. All of the items are sold, except for the Death Ray, which Megamind reluctantly keeps. As for the De-Gun, Megamind's former favorite weapon, it gets sold to a boy named Damien, who accidentally uses it to dehydrate his mother into a cube. After the auction is over, Megamind reveals a supersuit he created, which copies all of Metro Man's powers and which he intends to wear and defend the city.\n\nMinion finds a stray box with a button on it that he was also unable to sell during the auction. Not remembering what the button does, Megamind pushes it, activating an [[AI]] program based on his former evil personality that transfers itself into a giant robot called the Mega-Megamind. After scanning the supersuit, the robot thinks that Megamind is Metro Man and starts attacking him. Megamind fights the Mega-Megamind with his new powers, but is unfamiliar with their use. The Mega-Megamind causes Megamind to crash-land in his own lair. Megamind and Minion hide in the Invisible Car, and Megamind fears they will have to stay there forever, as he programmed the AI to not stop until the hero is dead. Minion suggests that Megamind should stop trying to be Metro Man, and fight the robot in his own way. He also reveals he secretly kept their giant Spider-Bot, having grown fond of it as a pet.\n\nMegamind thanks Minion, and plans to lure the Mega-Megamind to the abandoned observatory in which the real Metro Man faked his death. Megamind, riding the Spider-Bot, succeeds in luring the Mega-Megamind to the spot, but Minion cannot activate the Death Ray because its main controls were smashed by Megamind's suit when he crash-landed. Megamind has Minion test the contents of a box of old remotes, to find the one for the Death Ray. Minion does so, and activates several features in the lair and on the Spider-Bot in the process, allowing the Mega-Megamind to capture the Spider-Bot. Finally finding the correct remote, Minion blasts the giant robot with the ray just as Megamind uses the robot's own arm-mounted crossbow to launch himself and the Spider-Bot to safety.\n\nMegamind and Minion subsequently recover their old gadgets and re-purpose them for good. Upon finding Damien and the De-Gun, they discover he has dehydrated the parents of several other children as well as his own, and he and the children are throwing a party to celebrate their new freedom. Megamind reclaims the De-Gun, and re-hydrates the parents with a glass of water, much to the children's dismay. Later, Megamind and Minion see a signal in the sky (a spoof of the [[Bat-Signal]]) and ride off in the Invisible Car as they are called to action.\n\n===Cast===\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Megamind and Mega-Megamind\n* [[David Cross]] as Minion, Megamind's assistant\n* Michelle Belforte Hauser as Concerned Mother\n* Jordan Alexander Hauser as Damien\n* Kevin N.
