She lives in a remote country house in [[Jersey]], a Channel Island formerly [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied]] by the Germans. She is with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, who have an unspecified disease characterized by [[photosensitivity]]. Grace hires three new servants&mdash; housekeeper Mrs. Bertha Mills, gardener Edmund Tuttle, and a mute girl named Lydia. Mrs. Mills explains to Grace that she worked in the same house many years before. When odd events occur at the house, Grace begins to fear there are unknown \"others\" present. Anne claims to have seen a group of people in the house several times: a man, a woman, an old woman, and a child called Victor, who claimed that \"the house is theirs\". After Grace hears footsteps and unknown voices, she orders the house to be searched. She then finds a 19th-century photo album containing [[Post-mortem photography|photographs of corpses]]. When Grace asks Mrs. Mills about her previous experience in the house, Mrs. Mills recounts that many left due to an outbreak of [[tuberculosis]].\n\nAt night, Grace witnesses a piano playing itself and becomes convinced that the house is haunted. She runs outside in search of the local priest to bless the house. Before leaving, Grace instructs Tuttle to check a small nearby cemetery to see if a family has been buried there with a little boy named Victor. Tuttle finds the cemetery but covers the gravestones with leaves at the order of Mrs. Mills who assures him that Grace will learn the reasons behind the unexplained events in due time. Outside, Grace runs into her husband Charles, who she thought had been killed in the war. Charles greets his children after a long absence, but is distant during his short stay at the house. Later, Grace checks up on her daughter, Anne, whom she has left to play in a spare room.  Instead, to her horror Grace finds an old woman on the floor in the room wearing her daughter's communion dress, veil down. The old woman claims in Anne's voice \"I am your daughter\". Frightened, Grace attacks the old woman only to find that the old woman is merely an illusion and Grace has inadvertently attacked her own daughter. Later, Anne tells her brother that their mother has gone mad in the same way she did \"that day\" but he does not recall. Charles says he must leave for the [[Western Front (World War II)|front]], even though Grace claims that the war is over. The two embrace and lie motionless together in bed.\n\nThe next morning, Charles has left and the children are screaming that the curtains are gone, thus letting in the sunlight. Grace accuses the servants of having removed the curtains against her wishes and expels them from the house. That night, the children sneak outside and discover that the headstones in the cemetery belong to the recently banished servants. The children run away in fear when they turn to see that the servants are approaching them toward the cemetery in the foggy dark of night. Meanwhile, Grace finds a photograph that has slipped out of the Book of the Dead and fallen onto the floor under some furniture. The photograph displays the corpses of the three servants, Mrs. Mills, Tuttle and Lydia, who perished during a tuberculosis outbreak in 1891. The children run upstairs and hide in the bedroom where they are discovered by \"the other\" elderly woman. Mrs. Mills returns to the house and tells Grace to go upstairs and talk to the intruders.\n\nGrace discovers that the old woman is in fact a [[Medium (spirituality)|medium]] in a [[s\u00e9ance]] with Victor's parents, who has found out via [[automatic writing]] that Grace smothered her children to death with a pillow in a fit of despair before committing suicide. Grace realizes that \"the others\" are the family that has moved into the house, and that she, her children, and the servants are, in fact, dead.\n\nFollowing this display of supernatural and spiritual activity, Victor and his family vacate the house and leave it in the occupancy of the [[ghost]]s of its predecessors. However, because they are dead, Anne and Nicholas' ghosts are finally allowed to play in the sun. Mrs. Mills informs the Stewarts that others will come back to the house and they will have to learn to coexist together, but Grace ominously states that the house is theirs. As she says this, a \"For Sale\" sign is seen mounted to the gate.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Nicole Kidman]] as Grace Stewart\n*[[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Bertha Mills\n*[[Christopher Eccleston]] as Charles Stewart\n*Alakina Mann as Anne Stewart\n*[[James Bentley (actor)|James Bentley]] as Nicholas Stewart\n*Alexander Vince as Victor\n*[[Eric Sykes]] as Edmund Tuttle\n*[[Elaine Cassidy]] as Lydia\n*[[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] as Mr Marlish\n*[[Ren\u00e9e Asherson]] as the Old Lady\n*[[Michelle Fairley]] as Mrs Marlish\n*[[Gordon Reid (actor)|Gordon Reid]] as Assistant\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe production crew visited [[Penshurst Place]] in [[Kent]] to film at the Lime Walk in the gardens.
