An international co-production of South Africa and Botswana, it is the first film in [[The Gods Must Be Crazy (film series)|''The Gods Must Be Crazy'' series]].\n\nSet in [[Southern Africa]], the film stars Namibian [[San people|San]] farmer [[N\u01c3xau \u01c2Toma]] as Xi, a [[hunter-gatherer]] of the [[Kalahari Desert]] whose tribe discovers a glass bottle dropped from an airplane, and believe it to be a gift from their gods. When Xi sets out to return the bottle to the gods, his journey becomes intertwined with that of a biologist (played by [[Marius Weyers]]), a newly hired village school teacher ([[Sandra Prinsloo]]), and a band of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] terrorists.\n\n''The Gods Must Be Crazy'' was released by [[Ster-Kinekor]] in South Africa, where it broke box-office records, becoming the most financially successful release in the history of South Africa's film industry.<ref name=gorelik /> The film was a commercial and critical success in other countries, including the United States, where it was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], with the film's original [[Afrikaans]] dialogue being [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in English. Despite its success, the film attracted [[criticism]] for its depiction of race and perceived ignorance of discrimination and [[apartheid]] in South Africa.<ref name=klemesrud>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/28/movies/the-gods-must-be-crazy-a-truly-international-hit.html|title='The Gods Must Be Crazy' - A Truly International Hit|last=Klemesrud|first=Judy|author-link=Judy Lee Klemesrud|date=28 April 1985|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=23 July 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film was followed by one official [[sequel]], ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy II]]'', released by [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1989.\n\n==Plot==\nXi and his San tribe{{efn|The San people are also known as the Bushmen, and are referred to as Bushmen throughout ''The Gods Must Be Crazy''.

One day, a glass [[Coca-Cola]] bottle is thrown out of an airplane by a pilot and falls to the ground unbroken. Initially, Xi's people assume the bottle to be a gift from their gods, just as they believe plants and animals are, and find many uses for it. Unlike other bounties, however, there is only one glass bottle, which causes unforeseen conflict within the tribe. As a result, Xi, wearing only a loincloth, decides to make a pilgrimage to the edge of the world and dispose of the divisive object.\n\nAlong the way, Xi encounters biologist Andrew Steyn, who is studying the [[manure]] of wildlife; Steyn's assistant and mechanic, M'pudi; Kate Thompson, a woman who quit her job as a journalist in [[Johannesburg]] to become a village school teacher; and eventually a band of guerrillas led by Sam Boga, who are being pursued by government troops after a failed assassination attempt.  In a fictitious town called [[Biryani]], northwest of Botswana, Boga's men kill three cabinet members and injure two others in an attempt on the president's life, sending the military in hot pursuit.\n\nSteyn is tasked with bringing Thompson to the village where she will teach, but he is awkward and clumsy around her. Their [[Land Rover]] stalls while trying to ford a deep river; he hoists it out with a winch, but it continues lifting the vehicle to a very high treetop level while a forgetful Steyn is distracted extricating Thompson from a briar bush.  She more than once mistakes his attempts to evade wild animals, and putting out an evening campfire, as advances towards her. Eventually, a snobbish [[safari]] tour guide named Jack Hind arrives, and takes Thompson the rest of the way to the village.\n\nOne day, Xi happens upon a herd of goats, and shoots one with a [[Tranquilizer dart|tranquilizer arrow]], planning to eat it. He is arrested and sentenced to jail. M'pudi, who once lived with the San and can speak the San language, is discontent with the verdict. He and Steyn arrange to hire Xi as a [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]] for the remainder of his sentence in lieu of prison time, and teach Xi how to drive Steyn's Land Rover. Meanwhile, the guerrillas invade Thompson's [[school]], taking her and the students as hostages as they make their escape to a neighbouring country.\n\nSteyn, M'pudi and Xi, immersed in their [[fieldwork]], find that they are along the terrorists' and children's path, and observe their movements with a [[telescope]]. They manage to immobilize six of the eight guerrillas using makeshift tranquilizer darts launched by Xi with a miniature bow, allowing Thompson and the children to confiscate the guerillas' firearms. Steyn and M'pudi apprehend the remaining two guerrillas by frightening one with a snake and by shooting at a tree above the other, causing [[latex]] to drip from the tree and irritate his skin. Jack Hind arrives and takes Thompson and the children away, taking credit for the rescue that Steyn, M'pudi and Xi had actually planned and executed.\n\nLater, with Xi's term over, Steyn pays his wages and sends him on his way. Xi has never seen paper [[money|money (banknotes)]] before, and throws them on the ground. Steyn and M'pudi then drive from their camp to visit Thompson, where Steyn attempts to explain his tendency to be uncoordinated in her presence, but accidentally and repeatedly knocks over a number of objects in the process. Thompson finds his efforts endearing, and kisses Steyn.\n\nXi eventually arrives at [[God's Window]], the top of a cliff with a solid layer of low-lying clouds obscuring the landscape below. Convinced that he has reached the edge of the world, he throws the bottle off the [[cliff]], and returns to his family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[N\u01c3xau \u01c2Toma]] as Xi\n* [[Marius Weyers]] as Andrew Steyn\n* [[Sandra Prinsloo]] as Kate Thompson\n** In the film's English dub, Kate Thompson is voiced by Janet Meshad.\n* Louw Verwey as Sam Boga\n* Michael Thys as M'Pudi\n** In the English dub, M'Pudi is voiced by [[Pip Freedman]].\n* [[:af:Nic de Jager|Nic de Jager]] as Jack Hind\n* Fanyana Sidumo as Card 1\n* Joe Seakatsi\tas Card 2\n* [[Brian O'Shaughnessy (actor)|Brian O'Shaughnessy]] as Mr. Thompson\n* [[Ken Gampu]] as President\n}}\nDirector Jamie Uys appears in an uncredited role as the Reverend.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|date=1993|title=Roger Ebert's Video Companion, 1994|publisher=[[Andrews and McMeel]]|page=260|isbn=0-8362-6244-1}}</ref>{{sfn|Gugler|2004|p=75}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and casting===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|quote=\"After I made ''[[Animals Are Beautiful People]]'', I went back to the Kalahari very often to visit the Bushmen.

There is, however, little to laugh about in Bushmanland: 1,000 demoralized, formerly independent foragers crowd into a squalid, tubercular homeland, getting by on handouts of cornmeal and sugar, drinking [[Johnnie Walker|Johnny Walker]] or [[Homebrewing|home brew]], fighting with one another and joining the South African Army.\"<ref name=volkman />\n\nThe following year, Canadian anthropologist [[Richard Borshay Lee]] called the film \"an amusing but thinly disguised piece of South African propaganda in which a peculiar element of South African white mythology receives prominent attention.\"<ref name=lee>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Richard Borshay|author-link=Richard Borshay Lee|year=1986|title=The Gods Must Be Crazy, but the State Has a Plan: Government Policies towards the San in Namibia|journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies|volume=20|issue=1|pages=91\u201398|doi=10.2307/484697|jstor=484697|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261667597}}</ref> Lee wrote that \"The notion that some San in the 1980s remain untouched by 'civilization' is a cruel joke. The San have been the subject of a century of rapid social change and especially in the last twenty years have been forced to endure all the 'benefits' of South Africa's apartheid policies in Namibia.\"<ref name=lee />\n\nGugler wrote that the guerrillas in the film are depicted as \"bad Africans [...] dangerous and destructive all right, but they are also indolent and inept. In the end, even Kate Thompson gets to disarm one of them. Their leader, Sam Boga, articulates what the film is showing us about African guerrillas: 'Why do I have to work with amateurs?' He, in turn, serves to confirm the apartheid credo that Africans would be happy with the White dispensation were it not for foreigners fomenting discontent and making trouble.\"{{sfn|Gugler|2004|p=75}} Gugler goes on to state that Uys \"[perpetuates] the myths of apartheid: an ordered world with Whites on top, a world where Africans are content but for the interference of outsiders.\"{{sfn|Gugler|2004|p=75}}\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on apartheid, Uys stated that \"I think it's a mess. We've done some silly, naughty things that we're ashamed of. We're trying to dismantle it, but it's a very complicated thing. If you go too slow, it's bad, and if you go too fast, it will ruin the economy and everyone will starve. I hope I'm not a racist, but everybody likes to think of himself as not racist, and I don't think that any of us can swear we're not racist. If it means you hate the coloured man, I'm not racist. If it means you choose to marry a girl of your own colour, is that racist, too? If the two are in love, it doesn't matter. But I chose a white girl as my wife.\"<ref name=klemesrud />\n\n==Sequel and related films==\n{{Main|The Gods Must Be Crazy (film series)}}\n''The Gods Must Be Crazy'' was followed by one official sequel, ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy II]]'', released by [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1989. ''The Gods Must Be Crazy II'' was also written and directed and Uys, and again stars N!xau. This was followed by an unofficial sequel, ''[[Crazy Safari]]'' (also titled ''The Gods Must Be Crazy III''), a Hong Kong film starring N!xau. Other unofficial sequels include ''Crazy Hong Kong'' (''The Gods Must Be Crazy IV'') and ''The Gods Must Be Funny in China'' (''The Gods Must Be Crazy V''). Two other unrelated films, ''Jewel of the Gods'' and ''[[There's a Zulu On My Stoep]]'', were marketed in some territories as sequels to ''The Gods Must Be Crazy''.\n\n==Legacy==\nIrish Spring soap had a 1989 commercial parodying the film.<ref>{{cite web| url-status = live| archive-url = https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/7jR2BCMeOQU| archive-date = 2021-12-05| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jR2BCMeOQU| title = TV Commercial - 1989 - Irish Spring - Soap Bar - Tribesmen - Fresh Spring Fragrance | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nThe video for the song \"[[Take Me to Your Leader (Incubus song)|Take Me to Your Leader]]\" by American rock band [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] pays homage to the film.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/Cya5NAW423I Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110602191422/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cya5NAW423I Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cya5NAW423I| title = Incubus - Take Me to Your Leader | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=Lee|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Borshay Lee|year=2003|title=The Dobe Ju/'hoansi|url=https://archive.org/details/dobejuhoansi00leer|url-access=registration|series=Case Studies in Cultural Anthropology|edition=3rd|publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing]]|isbn=0-03-032284-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Gugler|first=Josef|year=2004|title=African Film: Re-Imagining a Continent|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=978-0253216434}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0080801}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|20084}}\n* {{Mojo title|id=godsmustbecrazy}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|id=gods_must_be_crazy}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/40901759|title=The Gods Must Be Crazy: Sorry, but it's still funny|author=Gorelik, Boris|date=April 2015|work=Journal of African Cinemas}}\n\n{{The Gods Must Be Crazy film series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gods Must Be Crazy}}\n[[Category:1980s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980 films]]\n[[Category:1980 comedy films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Afrikaans-language films]]\n[[Category:Coca-Cola in popular culture]]\n[[Category:English-language South African films]]\n[[Category:Films about hunter-gatherers]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism in Africa]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jamie Uys]]\n[[Category:Films set in Botswana]]\n[[Category:Films set in deserts]]\n[[Category:Films set in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Botswana]]\n[[Category:Films shot in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Kalahari Desert]]\n[[Category:South African adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:South African comedy films]]"}]}}}}
