Its plot follows Celeste, an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial woman]] sent on a secret mission to Earth, after her home planet's gravity is mistakenly disrupted by Steven Mills, a widowed scientist raising his daughter Jessie as a [[single father]].\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by [[Herschel Weingrod]], [[Timothy Harris (writer)|Timothy Harris]], and [[Jonathan Reynolds (writer)|Jonathan Reynolds]], based on an earlier script by Jericho Stone, who originally pitched the film to [[Paramount Pictures]] as a [[drama film|drama]] that would serve as an [[allegory]] about [[child abuse]]. When Paramount optioned the story, they suggested that it would be more believable as a comedy.<ref name=lawriters>{{cite news|title= A Writer's Close Encounter|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-02/entertainment/ca-2699_1_writer-s-close-encounter|access-date=2012-06-07}}</ref><ref name=afi/> The film was unproduced for four years until [[Weintraub Entertainment Group]] put it into production in 1988.\n\n''My Stepmother Is an Alien'' was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing $13.8 million against a $19 million budget. The film also received negative reviews from critics, with most of the responses panning the film's humor and screenplay. Basinger and costar Lovitz generally received favorable reviews for their comedic performances, but in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review, Aykroyd was singled out for criticism in his performance as a romantic lead.\n\n==Plot==\nSteven Mills is a widowed scientist working on different ways to send radio waves into deep space. After he sends a radio wave out of the galaxy, it hits a planet (Cosine N to the 8th), causing a disruption of gravity on the planet. Celeste is sent to investigate who could have done it and how it was done, believing it was an attack. She is aided by a device called Bag: an alien tentacle with a single eye and a mind of its own disguised as a [[It Bag|designer purse]]. Bag is able to create any object, such as [[diamond]]s and [[Designer clothing|designer dresses]], almost instantaneously. Celeste crashes a party hosted by Steven's brother, Ron, and immediately draws attention to herself by making outdated references to TV shows and political slogans under the mistaken belief that they are current (information that had actually taken 92 years to get from Earth to her home world).\n\nCeleste's inexperience almost results in her exposing herself as alien as she struggles with simple tasks such as cooking and trying to kiss for the first time. She goes home with Steven and spends the night (after Bag teaches her what [[sexual intercourse|sex]] is, which she greatly enjoys). Jessie, Steven's 13-year-old daughter, is at first happy that her father has found someone (her mother having died five years previously), but becomes suspicious when she observes Celeste eating the acid out of batteries and pulling eggs out of boiling hot water with her bare hands. However, she cannot convince her smitten father that something is unusual about Celeste. When Celeste tells him that she must leave in 24 hours, he impulsively [[marriage proposal|proposes]], and she accepts. Ron also has his doubts about Celeste and tries to dissuade Steven from marrying her on the idea she is an [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrant]] or planning [[Industrial espionage|economic espionage]], but then admits he is just jealous his brother has found his dream girl, whereas he will never find a girl like [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco]].\n\nCeleste begins enjoying life as a human as she encounters new experiences such as sneezing and love. When Jessie finally confronts her about being an extraterrestrial, Celeste admits her home world has no emotion and that she plans to depart once she gets Steven to recreate the radio signal and send it (which she says will reverse the gravity problems on her world). However, she begins to question her decisions when Jessie says it will devastate her father, for whom Celeste has now developed feelings. After Jessie argues with Steven, she runs away and is nearly hit by a car but is saved by Celeste, revealing her powers. Steven accepts that Celeste is indeed an alien and that she has fallen in love with him and sees Jessie as her own daughter. He further ingratiates her to human society by showing her how to eat real food.\n\nSteven figures out how to recreate the radio wave and saves Celeste's planet. Bag, however, had been sent to Earth to destroy it and eliminate the danger to Celeste's world entirely. After throwing Bag into the power field of the wave transmitter (destroying Bag), the leaders of Celeste's home world report in and tell her to finish Bag's job. Steven and Celeste manage to convince them it was an accident, not an act of aggression, and that Earth has many benefits that require further studying. They accept the explanation and demand that Celeste return to explain human culture to them. Not wanting to leave, Celeste negotiates having a native of Earth become an [[ambassador]] to their world as a token of goodwill. Ron is selected and accepts; he departs for Celeste's world in a spaceship served by several flight attendants, all of whom look like Princess St\u00e9phanie.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Steven Mills\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Celeste Martin\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Ron Mills\n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as Jessie Mills\n* [[Joseph Maher]] as Lucas Budlong\n* [[Seth Green]] as Fred Glass\n* [[Ann Prentiss]] as Voice of The Bag\n* [[Wesley Mann]] as Grady\n* [[Tony Jay]] as Council Chief\n* [[Peter Bromilow]] as Second in Command\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Voice of [[Carl Sagan]]\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Lexie, Jessie's Friend\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\nScreenwriter Jericho Stone developed the story under the working title ''They\u2019re Coming'' as a drama, an allegory about [[child abuse]].
