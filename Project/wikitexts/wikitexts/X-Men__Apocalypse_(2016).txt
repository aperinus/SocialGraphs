The film is based on the fictional [[X-Men]] characters that appear in [[Marvel Comics]]. It is the sixth mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the ninth installment overall. It is the sequel to ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) and stars [[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Rose Byrne]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Olivia Munn]], and [[Lucas Till]]. In the film, the ancient mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse]] is inadvertently revived in 1983, and he plans to wipe out modern civilization and take over the world, leading the X-Men to try to stop him and defeat his team of mutants.\n\nThe film was announced by Singer in December&nbsp;2013, with Kinberg, Dougherty, and Harris attached to develop the story. Casting began in October&nbsp;2014, while [[principal photography]] commenced in April&nbsp;2015 in [[Montreal]] and ended in August of the same year.\n\n''X-Men: Apocalypse'' premiered in [[London]] on May 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on May 27, 2016 in [[RealD 3D]], [[IMAX 3D]], [[4DX]] and [[Dolby Cinema]] formats by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, criticizing its overloaded action, visual effects, story, narrative decisions, character development, and portrayal of Apocalypse. A sequel, titled ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'', was released on June 7, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400-700 words. The plot summary does NOT intend to reproduce the experience of watching, nor is it meant to cover EVERY single detail. It should serve as an overview of the major plot elements and events.-->\nIn 3600 BC, the aged but powerful mutant [[En Sabah Nur]] rules [[ancient Egypt]]. Following a ceremony in which his consciousness is transferred into another man\u2019s body in order to gain his healing factor, he and his four followers are ambushed. In the process his followers are killed and he is entombed alive.\n\nIn 1983, [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]] takes his brother [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott]] to [[Charles Xavier (film series character)|Professor Charles Xavier]]'s [[X-Mansion|educational institute]], hoping that Xavier and [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] will teach him to control his mutation for shooting optic beams. Scott meets the [[telepathic]] and [[telekinetic]] [[Jean Grey]], and the two develop an attraction.\n\nEn Sabah Nur is awakened by a group of worshippers. He befriends orphan [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]] and learns about humanity. Deciding that humanity has lost its way, he plans to remake the world. Munroe becomes his follower after he enhances her power.\n\nIn [[East Berlin]], shape-shifting mutant [[Mystique (comics)|Raven]] discovers [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]], a mutant who can [[Teleportation in fiction|teleport]]. Raven requests black marketeer [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] to transport Kurt to America. En Sabah Nur recruits [[Psylocke]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and enhances both of their powers.\n\nIn [[Communist Poland]], [[Magneto (film series character)|Erik Lehnsherr]] lives happily with his wife and daughter. During the worldwide disturbances caused by En Sabah Nur, Erik uses his powers to save a coworker during an earthquake, prompting the [[Milicja Obywatelska|militia]] to capture him. They hold his daughter hostage in the forest in exchange for him to turn himself in. As tensions rise, Erik's daughter begins to display mutant powers (by mentally calling in wild animals from all over the forest), and the militia accidentally kill his wife and daughter in the ensuing confusion. In despair, Erik kills the entire militia.\n\nEn Sabah Nur takes Erik to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and shows him the true extent of his powers. Erik destroys the camp and joins En Sabah Nur. When Xavier contacts Erik, En Sabah Nur remotely accesses [[Cerebro]], the device Xavier uses to locate mutants, and forces Xavier to make the global superpowers launch their entire nuclear arsenals into space to prevent interference with En Sabah Nur's plan. He and his Four Horsemen arrive at the mansion and kidnap Xavier. Attempting to stop them, Alex causes an explosion that destroys the mansion. [[Peter Maximoff]] arrives and uses his super-speed to evacuate everyone except Alex, who dies in the explosion. Colonel [[William Stryker]]'s forces capture Hank, Raven, Peter, and Moira, and take them for interrogation. Scott, Jean, and Kurt follow covertly and liberate their comrades using Stryker's experiment [[Logan (film series character)|Weapon X]] (Wolverine), whose memories Jean partially restores.\n\nErik uses his powers to alter the Earth's magnetic field, causing destruction across the planet. En Sabah Nur plans to transfer his consciousness into Xavier's body to gain his psychic powers. Xavier sends a telepathic distress call to Jean and the others, who travel to Cairo to battle En Sabah Nur and his mutants. They rescue Xavier and flee in a plane. When Angel and Psylocke attack the plane, Nightcrawler teleports his friends away. Psylocke jumps to safety, but Angel is killed in the plane crash.\n\nErik and Ororo turn on En Sabah Nur and, with Scott's help, keep him occupied physically while Xavier fights him telepathically in the [[astral plane]]. Xavier begs Jean to unleash the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|full strength of her abilities]], and she incinerates En Sabah Nur. Psylocke escapes. Xavier and Moira rekindle their relationship. Erik and Jean help reconstruct the school, but Erik refuses Xavier's offer to stay and help teach. Peter decides not to tell Erik yet that he is Erik's son.

That I was going to be encased in glue, latex, and a 40-pound suit\u2014that I had to wear a cooling mechanism at all times. I couldn\u2019t move my head, ever. And I had to sit on a specially designed saddle, because that\u2019s the only thing I could really sit on, and I would be rolled into a cooling tent in-between takes. And so I just wouldn\u2019t ever talk to anybody, and I was just gonna be sitting and I couldn\u2019t really move, and like, sweating inside the mask and the helmet. And then getting it off was the worst part, because they just had to kind of scrape it off for hours and hours.\" In an interview with the New York Times, he later remarked when asked that he doesn't \"disown the film\", though he wished they would have taken care of the character of Apocalypse a little better.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2022/film/news/oscar-isaac-x-men-apocalypse-refuses-disown-1235255762/ | title=Oscar Isaac: I Don't Disown 'X-Men: Apocalypse,' but 'I Wish It Would've Been a Better Film' | date=May 2, 2022 }}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | List of awards and nominations\n|- \n!
