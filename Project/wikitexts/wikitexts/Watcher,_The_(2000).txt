Set in [[Chicago]], the film is about a retired [[FBI]] agent who is stalked and taunted by a [[serial killer]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn Los Angeles, FBI [[Special Agent]] Joel Campbell is moments too late to save a young woman from a [[serial killer]] he has been investigating, who escapes. Campbell quits his job and moves to [[Chicago]], where he is plagued by guilt-induced [[migraine]]s. Campbell attends [[therapy]] sessions with Dr. Polly Beilman, but otherwise has no friends or social life.\n\nCampbell learns that a woman who lived in his apartment building has been murdered. He does not pay it much attention until he opens his mail and finds that a picture of the woman had been sent to his apartment three days before the murder. He brings this information to the attention of the detective on the case, Det. Mackie, and comes to the conclusion that the same serial killer has arrived in Chicago. FBI [[Special Agent in Charge]] Ibby tries to persuade Campbell to return to the case, but he refuses.\n\nOne night Campbell receives a phone call from the killer, David Allen Griffin, who reveals that he followed Campbell to Chicago and wants to rebuild the \"rapport\" they once had. Griffin tells Campbell that he will send a photo of a woman in the morning, and Campbell has until 9:00 pm that night to find her. Campbell tells Ibby that he wants back in on the case, and his request is granted.\n\nCampbell works together with Mackie and the rest of the team in getting the word out on finding the woman before the deadline. However, by the time Campbell gets her house number and calls, Griffin is already there, and has killed her. Griffin suggests that they continue their \"game\" with a different woman. The next day, Campbell and his team try to find the next intended victim before the 9:00 pm deadline. They corner and almost catch Griffin, but he manages to once again kill the woman and escape. Later that night, Campbell is found unconscious in his apartment by his colleagues.\n\nThe next day, another photo arrives, but it turns out to be the image of Lisa Anton, Campbell's former lover who was killed by Griffin back in [[Los Angeles]]. Campbell goes to Lisa's grave, where Griffin is waiting for him. Griffin explains that he has Beilman hostage somewhere, and only wants to talk with him. Campbell negotiates for Beilman's safety, and Griffin eventually agrees to bring Campbell to see her. During the drive, Griffin explains that he considers Campbell a \"good friend\", and that the two of them need each other. Campbell secretly uses his [[cell phone]] to call Mackie, cluing him in on the situation. Griffin takes Campbell to the warehouse, knocks him out, and restrains him while he starts to strangle Beilman. Campbell distracts Griffin by saying 'thank you'. When Griffin asks Campbell to repeat himself, Campbell does, and proceeds to stab him in the neck with a pen before shooting him in the shoulder with a double-barrelled shotgun. Campbell rescues Beilman and gets them both to safety as the warehouse explodes, killing Griffin.\n\nWhen Campbell and Beilman are safe, Campbell goes over to Griffin's charred corpse and looks at it to make sure he is dead.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Spader]] as FBI [[Special Agent]] Joel Campbell\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Dr. Polly Beilman\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as David Allen Griffin\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as FBI [[Special Agent In Charge]] Mike Ibby\n* [[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]] as Detective Hollis Mackie\n* [[Robert Cicchini]] as FBI Special Agent Mitch Casper\n* Jenny McShane as FBI Agent Diana\n* Gina Alexander as FBI Agent Sharon\n* [[Andrew Rothenberg]] as FBI Agent Jack Fray\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as FBI Agent Norton\n* Michael Guido as FBI Agent Mendel\n* Mindy Bell as Supervising Agent\n* Yvonne Niami as Lisa Marie Anton\n* Rebekah Louise Smith as Ellie Buckner, Third Chicago Victim. \n* Jillian Peterson as Jessica, Fourth Chicago Victim.\n* Michele DiMaso as Rachel, Jessica's Mother.\n* [[Joseph Sikora]] as Skater\n* Butch Jerinic as Flower Girl\n* Jason Wells as Computer Tech\n* Tamara Tungate as Young Woman\n* Erikka Yancy as Campbell's Secretary\n* Marilyn Dodds Frank as Wanda\n* Shela Coleman as Wanda's Sister\n* Kyle Hillman as FBI Agent (uncredited)\n* Scott A.

He performed the role rather than get involved in a lengthy legal battle. Reeves reached an agreement with distributor [[Universal Pictures]] in which he would not disclose what had happened until 12 months after the film's US release; in return, Universal agreed to downplay Reeves's involvement in marketing, and Universal asked the film's producers to enhance Reeves's profit participation (which led Reeves to ultimately receive an additional $2 million).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whoaisnotme.net/articles/2000_0905_are.htm|title=A Reluctant Serial Killer: Keanu Reeves Bit Off Bigger Role Than Expected in The Watcher :: WINM :: Keanu Reeves Articles & Interviews Archive|website=www.whoaisnotme.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/inside-move-watcher-dogs-reeves-1117852857/|title=Inside Move: 'Watcher' dogs Reeves|first1=Tim|last1=Swanson|date=September 19, 2001}}</ref>  He was unhappy with the fact that his role, which was originally written as little more than a cameo, turned into a lead while he was still being paid scale in contrast to the other leads.<ref>{{cite web|title=Keanu: I was tricked into making film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/11/news|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=19 February 2013|date=11 September 2001}}</ref> ''The Watcher'' (originally known as ''Driven'' before a film of that [[Driven (2001 film)|same name]] was announced) was filmed between October and December 1999 on location in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Oak Park, Illinois]].\n\nThis movie featured the 1996 hit \"[[6 Underground (song)|6 Underground]]\" performed by [[Sneaker Pimps]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was critically panned with [[Rotten Tomatoes]] holding an 11% rating based on 90 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/watcher|title=The Watcher (2000)|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> Keanu Reeves earned a [[Razzie Award]] nomination as Worst Supporting Actor for his performance, \"losing\" the award to [[Barry Pepper]] for ''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]''.\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at the top spot of the North American box office making $9,062,295 [[USD]] in its opening weekend.
