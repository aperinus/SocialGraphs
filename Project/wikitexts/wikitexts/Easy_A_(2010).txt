Royal]], starring [[Emma Stone]], [[Stanley Tucci]], [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Dan Byrd]], [[Amanda Bynes]], [[Penn Badgley]], [[Cam Gigandet]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Aly Michalka]], and [[Malcolm McDowell]]. The screenplay was partially inspired by the 1850 novel ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].\n\nShot at [[Screen Gems]] studios and in [[Ojai, California]], the film was released on September 17, 2010. The film received positive reviews with high praise for Stone's performance, and was a major financial success, grossing $75 million worldwide against a budget of $8 million.\n\nThe film is ranked as number 14 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''<nowiki/>'s 2021 list of the Best High School Movies.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=14 May 2021 |title=50 Best High School Movies |url=https://ew.com/gallery/50-best-high-school-movies-0/ |access-date=31 March 2022 |website=[[EW.com]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is narrated by Olive Penderghast, a 17-year-old high school girl living in [[Ojai, California]], speaking into her webcam.\n\nOlive lies to her best friend, Rhiannon Abernathy, about going on a date in order to get out of camping with Rhiannon's hippie parents. Instead, she hangs around the house all weekend listening to [[Natasha Bedingfield]]'s 2008 song \"[[Pocketful of Sunshine]]\" from a [[greeting card#Types of greeting cards|musical greeting card]] her grandmother sent her. The following Monday, Rhiannon presses Olive until she lies about losing her virginity to a college boy. Marianne Bryant, a devout Christian whom Olive considers to be prudish, overhears her telling the lie and it soon spreads throughout the school. The school's church group, run by Marianne, decides to \"save\" Olive from her supposed promiscuity. Olive confides the truth to her friend Brandon, who is bullied by other students for being [[homosexuality|gay]]. Brandon asks Olive to pretend to have sex with him at a party so the other students will believe he is straight, to which she agrees.\n\nAfter a fight with Rhiannon over her new reputation as a \"dirty skank\", Olive decides to counteract the harassment by embracing her new image as the school tramp, wearing more provocative clothing and stitching a red \"A\" onto her clothing, inspired by [[Hester Prynne]] from [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s 1850 novel ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]''. Boys who have had no previous luck with girls beg Olive to increase their popularity by saying they have had sex with her, which she does in exchange for gift cards to various stores. Things get worse when Micah, Marianne's boyfriend, contracts [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] from sleeping with Mrs. Griffith, the school guidance counselor, and blames Olive. As Mrs. Griffith's husband, Mr. Griffith, is Olive's favorite teacher, she accepts the blame to spare their marriage.\n\nThe church youth group, which now includes Rhiannon, begins harassing Olive in an attempt to get her to drop out of school. Olive gets asked out on a date by Anson, Rhiannon's crush, which ends badly when Anson bribes Olive to actually have sex with him and not just pretend that she did. Olive later reconnects with Todd, her childhood crush and the school mascot, who tells her he does not believe the rumors because she lied for him when he was not ready for his first kiss years ago. Olive decides to ask everyone she lied for to help her by telling everyone the truth, but nobody is willing to relinquish their newfound popularity. When Mrs. Griffith also refuses to tell the truth, Olive threatens to expose her affair, but Mrs. Griffith says no one would believe her. Out of spite, Olive immediately tells Mr. Griffith, who subsequently separates from his wife.\n\nAfter talking with her open-minded mother, Olive comes up with a plan - she does a song-and-dance number at a school pep rally to get people's attention and tells them to watch her webcast later that night, promising an online [[sex show]] with Todd when in reality, it is the webcast that has served as the narrative device for the film. As she is finishing up her webcast, Todd comes by her house riding a lawn mower. She signs off by saying that she may lose her virginity to Todd sooner or later, but proudly declares that \"it is nobody's goddamn business.\" Olive texts Rhiannon and apologizes for lying to her. She goes outside to meet Todd and the two share a kiss before riding off on the lawn mower.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Emma Stone]] as Olive Penderghast\n** [[Juliette Goglia]] as young Olive\n* [[Penn Badgley]] as \"Woodchuck\" Todd\n** [[Braeden Lemasters]] as young Todd\n* [[Amanda Bynes]] as Marianne Bryant\n* [[Dan Byrd]] as Brandon\n* [[Aly Michalka]] as Rhiannon Abernathy\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Mr. Griffith\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Mrs. Griffith\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Rosemary Penderghast\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Dill Penderghast\n* [[Cam Gigandet]] as Micah\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Principal Gibbons\n* [[Mahaley Patel]] as Nina Howell\n* [[Jake Sandvig]] as Anson\n* Bryce Clyde Jenkins as Chip Penderghast\n* [[Johanna Braddy]] as Melody Bostic\n* [[Fred Armisen]] as Pastor Bryant\n* [[Stacey Travis]] as Mrs. Bryant\n* [[Max Crumm]] as Pontius\n* [[Yoshi Sudarso]] as Eric Ling\n* [[Lalaine]] as Gossipy Girl \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nScreenwriter [[Bert V.
