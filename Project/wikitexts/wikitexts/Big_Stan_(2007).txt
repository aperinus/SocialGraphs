It tells the story of a real estate con artist who gets sentenced to three years in prison and spends the six months before it getting trained to survive in prison by a martial arts guru. This film was Gibson's final role before his death in 2009.\n\nAlthough released in some markets during the fall of 2008, it was released [[direct-to-video|straight to DVD]] in the U.S. on March 24, 2009. It debuted at number 17 on the DVD rental charts of March 23\u201330, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nStan Minton ([[Rob Schneider]]) is a wealthy real estate [[Confidence trick|con artist]], married to Mindy ([[Jennifer Morrison]]). One day, he is arrested for conning elderly people out of their savings. His lawyer Mal ([[Richard Kind]]) defends him at the trial presided over by Judge Perry ([[Richard Riehle]]) as the forewoman ([[Sally Kirkland]]) finds him guilty where the sentencing will be tomorrow.\n\nWhile talking with Stan, Mal refuses to bribe Judge Perry since he does not practice that kind of law and states to Stan that any [[shyster]] on the street would do it for him. Inspired by the bench advertisement outside, Stan fires Mal from the case and hires Lew Popper ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]) as a replacement for the sentencing. Judge Perry sentences Stan to 3 years at the Verlaine State Correctional Facility while giving him 6 months by Judge Perry to \"reorganize the charity\" Stan established to teach music to mentally disabled children.\n\nAs he can't go on a permanent vacation to Brazil on Lew's advice due to his assets being frozen, Stan's fear of jailhouse rape strains his marriage to Mindy. This leads him to hire the mysterious [[guru]] known as \"The Master\" ([[David Carradine]]) who helps transform him into a martial-arts expert.\n\nDuring his incarceration, Stan befriends an elderly inmate named Larry who is serving a life sentence for murdering his partner. Stan also befriends a sympathetic prison guard named Bullard ([[Kevin Gage (actor)|Kevin Gage]]) and learns more about the cliques and gang activities formed inside the prison. He then uses his new-found skills to bring peace and harmony to the prison yard by intimidating his fellow inmates like Big Raymond ([[Bob Sapp]]) into preventing them from harming each other. With this, peace is restored in at Verlaine State Correctional Facility and Stan gains their respect, eventually becoming their leader.\n\nHowever, the corrupt warden Gasque ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) has plans to force its closure with a riot and sell off the property as valuable real estate. Stan helps him with the real estate aspects in exchange for early parole. However, his peacemaking efforts threaten the warden's plan for a riot and he is persuaded to bring back violence.\n\nIn a last minute attack of conscience, he deliberately blows the parole hearing to rush back and prevent the deaths of his fellow inmates only to discover that his message of peace has sunk in and the prisoners are dancing instead of fighting. Warden Gasque orders the guards to open fire on the dancing men. When they refuse, he grabs a gun in front of the Board of Governors and shoots wildly. Warden Gasque attempts to shoot Stan, but he is stopped by Mindy and the Master, who had sneaked in. Stan was surprised that the Master had trained Mindy during his incarceration when he thought they were having an affair during an earlier phone call.\n\nThree years later, Stan leaves the prison where Bullard had been sworn in as the new warden of Verlaine State Correctional Facility. Gasque becomes the new inmate following his arrest for his illegal activities as Big Raymond intimidates him to say goodbye to Stan. Lew is also an inmate after he had foreseen that he would be arrested for having slept with a member of the jury and for being a corrupted lawyer. Stan is met by his wife, his young daughter Mindy Jr., and the Master outside the prison. While the Master has become Mindy Jr.'s nanny, Stan is annoyed that he has been smoking near her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as \"Big\" Stan Minton, a rich real estate con artist.\n* [[Jennifer Morrison]] as Mindy Minton, Stan's wife.\n* [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] as Francis Gasque, the corrupt prison warden of Verlaine State Correctional Facility who seeks to get the prison closed down so that he can sell the land.\n* [[Henry Gibson]] as Larry / \"Shorts\", an inmate that Stan befriends who is serving a life sentence for killing his partner.\n* [[Richard Kind]] as Mal, Stan's lawyer.\n* [[Sally Kirkland]] as Madame Foreman, a jury member that finds Stan guilty.\n* [[Jackson Rathbone]] as Robbie, an inmate who is a hippie and former drug dealer.\n* [[M.
