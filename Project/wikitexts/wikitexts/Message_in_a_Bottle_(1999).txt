It stars [[Kevin Costner]], [[Robin Wright]] (under her married name Robin Wright Penn) and [[Paul Newman]], and was filmed in [[Maine]], [[Chicago]] and [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. The film was released on February 12, 1999 by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film was panned by the critics but was a moderate box office hit grossing $118 million against a $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nTheresa Osborne, a former reporter, works as a researcher for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. On a trip to [[Cape Cod]], she finds a mysterious, intriguing and typed love [[Message in a bottle|letter in a bottle]] in the sand, addressed to Catherine. She is fascinated by it and shows it to her colleagues. They print it in their newspaper without the knowledge of Theresa and receive numerous responses. One of the responses contains an attached letter which was addressed to the same person and written in the same tone. Later, they receive another letter of the same kind from one of the readers which was not addressed to Catherine, but typed on the same notepad. Eventually, they track the author down with the help of the typewriter and the notepad used. His name is Garrett Blake, and he lives quietly on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] near his father, Dodge.\n\nTheresa goes to Outer Banks to research it further but when she meets him, they are attracted to each other and start becoming better acquainted.  She tries to tell him about the original purpose of her visit but fears that she might lose him and postpones it. Along with the literal distance between them \u2014 they live hundreds of miles apart \u2014 there is another problem: Garrett cannot quite forgive Catherine for dying and leaving him.\n\nTheresa's career flourishes as the romantic \"[[message in a bottle]]\" tale is told in print, without naming names. Garrett makes a trip to Chicago to visit Theresa and her young son. They seem very happy together for a day, but Garrett sees his letters, becomes upset, and starts to leave. But when Theresa reveals that there are three letters of the same kind, he becomes intrigued as he only wrote two of them and comes back to see another letter. The third letter, which was not addressed to Catherine, was actually written by Catherine; in that letter, she reveals her love, her knowledge of her impending death, and how she was content with her life with Garrett, however short it might be. Garrett leaves with the letter, leaving Theresa in tears.\n\nGarrett moves on with his life and sets things straight with Catherine's family, who had been battling with Garrett for the artworks of Catherine. He finishes his own personalized boat with the help of Catherine's brother and names it ''Catherine'' in her honor, and sends an invitation to Theresa to visit. When Theresa goes there, she witnesses the passionate speech of Garrett about his late wife Catherine and understands that he still is in love with his late wife, and leaves him saying that he is welcome to call her when he thinks he is ready to start a new life.\n\nAfter that night, Garrett writes a letter to Catherine, puts it in a bottle and goes sailing. A storm breaks out and Garrett desperately tries to save a family from a sinking boat and succeeds in saving two out of three; however, in the process, he himself drowns. Garrett's father Dodge calls Theresa and informs her about his death. Heartbroken, Theresa goes there to bid farewell; Dodge gives her the letter that Garrett had intended for Catherine, found on his boat. Garrett wrote that he found someone else, Theresa who is as dear as Catherine to him and decides to start a new life with her, and asks for Catherine's blessing. Though devastated, Theresa comes back contented, stating that though this experience left her in grief, it helped her to feel the most important thing in life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Garrett Blake\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Theresa Osborne\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Dodge Blake\n* Susan Brightbill as Catherine Land Blake\n* [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] as Johnny Land\n* [[Illeana Douglas]] as Lina Paul\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as Charlie Toschi\n* [[Jesse James (actor)|Jesse James]] as Jason Osborne\n* [[Bethel Leslie]] as Marta Land\n* [[Tom Aldredge]] as Hank Land\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Girl on Boat\n* [[Rosemary Murphy]] as Helen at the B&B\n\n==Production==\n{{Anchor|Locations}}\n\n===Filming===\nThe producers originally planned to film on [[Tangier Island]], [[Virginia]], but the Tangier town council voted against allowing it due to the drinking, swearing and sex in the script.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thornton |first=Stuart |title=Unique Speak |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/unique-speak/ |website=[[National Geographic]] |access-date=26 July 2020 |date=January 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWarner Bros. then tried [[Martha's Vineyard]] near [[Chilmark, Massachusetts]], but the Chilmark Conservation Commission turned down a request to build a temporary {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} house on [[Stilts (architecture)|stilts]] in the dunes near Chilmark Pond.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul Newman and Kevin Costner|date=13 March 1998|newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19980313&id=sM40AAAAIBAJ&sjid=ICEGAAAAIBAJ&pg=5037,1316597&hl=en|access-date=17 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nBeach scenes were filmed at [[Popham Beach]] in [[Phippsburg, Maine]].<ref name=HookBeach>{{cite web|title=The Outer Banks Beach House from \"Message in a Bottle\"|date=23 July 2012 |url=http://hookedonhouses.net/2012/07/23/the-outer-banks-beach-house-from-message-in-a-bottle/|access-date=17 May 2015}}</ref> No filming was done at the Outer Banks (the setting of the novel).<ref name=HookBeach/>\n\n===Music===\nIrish music group [[Clannad]] wrote the song \"[[The Best of Clannad: In a Lifetime|What Will I Do]]\" for the film.
