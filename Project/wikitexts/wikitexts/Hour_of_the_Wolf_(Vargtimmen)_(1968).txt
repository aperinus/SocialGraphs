The story explores the disappearance of fictional painter Johan Borg (von Sydow), who lived on an island with his wife Alma (Ullmann) while plagued with frightening visions and [[insomnia]].\n\nBergman originally conceived much of the story as part of an unproduced screenplay, ''The Cannibals'', which he abandoned to make the 1966 film ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''. He took inspiration from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s 1791 opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s 1814 novella ''[[The Golden Pot]]'', as well as some of his own nightmares. Principal photography took place at [[Hovs Hallar]], Stockholm and [[F\u00e5r\u00f6]].\n\nThemes include insanity, particularly as experienced by an artist, sexuality, and relationships, conveyed in a [[surrealism|surreal]] style and with elements of folklore. Analysts have found allusions to [[vampire]] and [[werewolf]] legend. Authors have also connected the work to Bergman's life and his relationship with Ullmann; Bergman said he was experiencing his own \"hour of the wolf\" when he conceived the story.\n\nThe film was initially met with negative reviews in Sweden. In later years ''Hour of the Wolf'' received generally positive reviews and was ranked one of the 50 greatest films ever made in a 2012 directors' poll by the [[British Film Institute]]. The film was followed by Bergman's thematically related films ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Passion of Anna]]'' (1969). Ullmann won awards in 1968 for her performances in both ''Hour of the Wolf'' and ''Shame''.\n\n==Plot==\nPainter Johan Borg and his pregnant young wife Alma live on the small island of [[Baltrum]]. He shares sketches with Alma of frightening visions he has had, and begins to give them names, including the Birdman, the Insects, the Meat-Eaters, the Schoolmaster, and the Lady With a Hat. As his [[insomnia]] grows worse, Alma stays awake by his side.\n\nOne day, an elderly lady stops by the house and tells Alma to read Johan's diary, which he hides under his bed. Alma discovers that Johan is haunted not only by the real or imaginary strangers, but also by images of his former lover, Veronica Vogler. She also reads that Johan was approached by Baron von Merkens, who lives in a nearby castle. The painter and his wife visit them and their household. After dinner, the baron's wife shows the couple into her bedroom, where she has a portrait of Veronica by Johan. After they leave the castle, Alma expresses to Johan her fears of losing him to the demons, as well as her will to persevere if such were to happen.\n\n[[File:Luftaufnahme Baltrum DaB.jpg|thumb|left|[[Baltrum]] is one of the [[Frisian Islands]].]]\nOne night, Alma again stays awake with Johan. He tells her of the \"vargtimmen\" (\"Hour of the Wolf\"), during which, he says, most births and deaths occur. He also recounts his childhood trauma of being locked into a closet where, as his parents said, a small person lived. He then recalls a confrontation with a small boy while out fishing on the island, which culminated with him killing the boy. Alma is shocked by Johan's confessions.\n\nHeerbrand, one of von Merkens's guests, shows up at the couple's house to invite them to another party at the castle, adding that Veronica Vogler is among the invitees. He places a pistol on the table, for protection against \"small animals\", and leaves. Johan and Alma begin quarreling over his obsession with Veronica. Johan finally picks up the pistol, shoots Alma and runs to the castle.\n\nJohan attends the party. The baron's guests are revealed to be the demons that Johan described to Alma. As he rushes through the castle searching for Veronica, he meets Lindhorst, who applies cosmetics to his pale face and dresses him in a silk robe. He then leads Johan to her. Johan finds Veronica, who appears to be dead; as he looks over her naked body, she suddenly sits up and laughs. Johan is physically attacked by the demons and flees into underbrush. Alma, who was injured by one of the shots but is only left with a scar, searches the forest for her husband. She witnesses the attacks on him before he finally disappears, leaving her alone in the woods.\n\nAlma later shares her story and her husband's diary. She wonders whether the fact that she and Johan lived together for so long and became so similar was why she could see his Man-Eaters, and whether she would have been better able to protect him if she had loved him less, or more.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Max von Sydow]] and [[Liv Ullmann]] starred.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = Max von Sydow 1989.jpg\n | width1    = 149\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Liv Ullmann 1966 2 (cropped).jpg\n | width2    = 157\n | alt2      = \n}}\nThe cast includes:{{sfn|Shargel|2007|p=xlii}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Johan Borg\n* [[Liv Ullmann]] as Alma Borg\n* [[Gertrud Fridh]] as Corinne von Merkens\n* [[Georg Rydeberg]] as Lindhorst\n* [[Erland Josephson]] as Baron von Merkens\n* [[Naima Wifstrand]] as Old Lady with Hat\n* [[Ulf Johanson]] as Heerbrand\n* [[Gudrun Brost]] as Gamla Fru von Merkens\n* [[Ingrid Thulin]] as Veronica Vogler\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nInspirations for the story included Bergman's recurring nightmares, featuring a woman who took off her own face and an entity that walked on ceilings.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=349}} Johan's description of being locked in a closet as a boy was based on Bergman's childhood.{{sfn|Wood|2012|p=24}} An external influence was [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', with the opera's character Papageno transformed into an evil Birdman.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=348}}{{refn|group=n|name=\"Flute\"|Bergman later adapted the opera for screen as the 1975 film ''[[The Magic Flute (1975 film)|The Magic Flute]]''.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=162}} }} Bergman's interpretation of ''The Magic Flute'' is echoed through his character Lindhorst.{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=349}}{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|2003|p=65}} Bergman credited German author [[E.
