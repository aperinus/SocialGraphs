He recoils in disgust after seeing the images related to an open case, but Nicole advises him these are the types of images he will have to see every day and not look away from.\n\nMeanwhile, local contractor Matthew Lane picks up his 9-year-old daughter, Cassandra, after her figure skating practice. Matthew stops to pick up pie, leaving Cassandra in his truck. Minutes later, he returns to find her missing. He reports the abduction to the police station, where Jeffrey and Nicole are assigned to the case. They are skeptical of his story, which infuriates him. Cassandra's mother, Tina Lane, arrives and breaks down in rage at Matthew.\n\nEight years later, Matthew and Tina are estranged; she blames him for Cassandra's disappearance. Nicole and Jeffrey are now romantically involved. Tina meets with the police regularly to discuss their case but Matthew, originally a suspect, has become a vigilante in the search for Cassandra.\n\nThis entire time Cassandra has been held captive in the home of a [[child pornographer]] named Mika, who has installed remote cameras in the hotel rooms where Tina works as a chambermaid. Although Mika leaves his house to work and is no longer sexually interested in the now-teenaged Cassandra, the fear that he will harm her parents keeps Cassandra from escaping or seeking help.\n\nJeffrey finds recent photos of Cassandra online. Mika makes her tell stories on camera to lure in younger children. Nicole poses as a child, which allows her and Jeffrey to catch a child molester named Willy, as well as a group of others. The arrests put Nicole into the public eye. Mika visits Willy in prison and urges him not to take any deals for cooperation. Willy says he will only comply if someone kidnaps Nicole and forces her to reveal what in her past may have inspired her to pursue child protection.\n\nCassandra begins [[Online chat|chatting online]] with a young girl, trying to entice her to meet. When Nicole arrives home, she finds Jeffrey using his own niece as bait to infiltrate the child porn community and immediately shuts off the web cam. Mika secretly [[camfecting|turns the webcam back on]] to watch their fight and reconsiders Willy's offer regarding Nicole.\n\nNicole attends a dinner held in her honor where she is drugged and kidnapped by Vicky, a woman working for Mika.\n\nWhile transporting trees in his truck, Matthew stays overnight at a motel.  He wakes to find the trees have been taken and left in a trail that ultimately leads him to a remote location where he finds Cassandra. Cassandra resists leaving with him and Matthew does not understand why until Mika appears and [[tranquilizer gun|tranquilizes]] him; Mika had arranged the meeting to watch their reunion.\n\nMika locks Nicole in a van and tells her to tell her story into a microphone.\n\nAt the ice skating rink, Vicky questions Cassandra's former skating partner, Albert, about their history, pressuring him for details on how he was impacted by the disappearance. Matthew overhears this and follows Vicky to a restaurant, where he eavesdrops as Vicky plays a recording of her conversation with Albert for Mika. Matthew calls Jeffrey with their location and plants his [[mobile phone tracking|phone's GPS]] on Mika's vehicle.\n\nMatthew goads the diner staff to call the police by being disruptive. He confronts the abductors to buy more time and steals Vicky's cell phone. She and Mika chase Matthew in their vehicle, shooting at his truck. Matthew escapes by driving by the diner again, where multiple police cars have responded to the staff's earlier calls.\n\nJeffrey tracks Matthew's phone and locates Mika's house. Jeffrey is shot by Vicky before he kills her and fatally wounds Mika, who dies while being interrogated for Nicole's location. The Lane family is reunited at the police station and visit Jeffrey as he recovers in the hospital. The police finally find and rescue Nicole.\n\nCassandra skates at her old ice rink and smiles.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Matthew Lane\n* [[Scott Speedman]] as Detective Jeffrey Cornwall\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Detective Nicole Dunlop\n* [[Mireille Enos]] as Tina Lane\n* [[Kevin Durand]] as Mika\n* [[Alexia Fast]] as Cassandra Lane\n* [[Peyton Kennedy]] as Young Cassandra\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Vince\n* [[Brendan Gall]] as Teddy\n* [[Aaron Poole]] as Mike\n* [[Jason Blicker]] as Sam\n* [[Aidan Shipley]] as Albert\n* Ian Matthews as Willy\n* [[Christine Horne]] as Vicky\n* [[Ella Ballentine]] as Jennifer\n* [[Jim Calarco]] as a Manager\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe shooting of the film began in February 2013 in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]].<ref>[http://www.thesudburystar.com/2013/03/01/egoyan-film-gets-1-million-from-nohfc \"Egoyan film gets $1 million from NOHFC\"].
