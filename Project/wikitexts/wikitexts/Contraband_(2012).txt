K. Simmons]]. The film is a remake of the 2008 [[Iceland]]ic film ''[[Reykjav\u00edk-Rotterdam]]'' which Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur starred in. It was released on January 13, 2012 in the United States by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=January 2021}}\n\nFormer [[smuggler]] Chris Farraday lives a peaceful life with his wife, Kate, and their two sons in [[New Orleans]]. They learn that Kate's brother Andy was smuggling drugs, but disposed of them in the [[Mississippi River]] during a surprise inspection by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].\n\nAndy's boss, Tim Briggs threatens to kill Chris's family if Andy does not reimburse him for the drugs. Chris returns to smuggling to raise the money, working with his former partner, Sebastian Abney, who now works in construction. Chris then joins a cargo ship, planning to buy $10 million in fake bills in [[Panama]] and smuggle them into the U.S. He is joined by Andy, and his good friend Danny Raymer. After Briggs breaks into Chris's house and intimidates Kate and their children, they move into Sebastian's house for safety.\n\nIn [[Panama]], Chris discovers that the only one who can provide high quality fake bills is crime lord Gonzalo. Leaving Andy in the van with the money for the fake bills, Chris meets with Gonzalo to negotiate. Briggs calls Andy, threatens to kill one of Chris's sons and forces him to take the money to buy cocaine. With the money gone, Chris and Danny agree to help Gonzalo rob an armored car in exchange for the fake bills. During the robbery, Gonzalo and his men are killed, but Chris and Danny successfully steal a [[Jackson Pollock]] painting that resembles a splattered tarp. Upon reaching the docks, Chris and Danny place the van with the contraband into a container, which is loaded onto their cargo ship.\n\nMeanwhile, Sebastian, desperate to pay gangster Jim Church, has been secretly working with Briggs. Sebastian calls Chris and learns that Chris plans to get rid of the cocaine Andy bought. Sebastian instructs Briggs to threaten Kate, and through her, Briggs warns Chris not to dump the cocaine. Sebastian contacts the cargo ship's captain, Camp tells him of Chris's smuggled contraband, and promises him a share if he secures it. Unable to get Chris to give up the contraband, Camp calls U.S. Customs to inspect the ship in New Orleans. The Customs agents find the container with Chris's van, though it is empty except for the painting, which they ignore.\n\nOnce Chris is on shore, Briggs and his thugs demand the cocaine. Chris takes Briggs to Camp's house, having made a duplicate key while on the ship, and activates the security system. After giving Briggs and his gang the cocaine, Chris sneaks out. Camp awakens to the noise and encounters the gang as the police arrive. Both Briggs's group and Camp are then arrested for possession of the cocaine.\n\nWarned by Chris, Kate leaves Sebastian's house. When she goes back to retrieve some personal items, she has a confrontation with Sebastian, who accidentally pushes her against a bathtub. Thinking she is dead, he dumps her unconscious body in a foundation at one of his construction sites. Chris goes to Sebastian's construction site and beats him up for his betrayal, then manages to locate and save Kate by calling her cellphone. Sebastian is arrested and sent to prison, where he is greeted by a lynch mob.\n\nDanny retrieves the fake bills, which were dumped into the Mississippi River by Chris before docking in New Orleans. At a U.S. Customs auction, Andy buys the escape van confiscated from the cargo ship, and finds the painting still in it. Church pays Chris $3 million for the fake bills and asks about the missing painting, which Chris learns can be [[fence (criminal)|fenced]] for over $20 million on the black market. With the money, Chris, Kate, their children, and Andy begin a new life in a waterfront house.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Chris Farraday\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Kate Farraday\n* [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] as Sebastian Abney\n* [[Caleb Landry Jones]] as Andy\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Tim Briggs\n* [[Diego Luna]] as Gonzalo\n* [[J.
