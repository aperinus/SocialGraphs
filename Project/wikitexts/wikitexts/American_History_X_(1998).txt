The film stars [[Edward Norton]] and [[Edward Furlong]] as two brothers from [[Los Angeles]] who are involved in the [[white power skinhead]] and [[neo-Nazi]] movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for [[voluntary manslaughter]], is rehabilitated during this time, and then tries to prevent his brother (Furlong) from being [[indoctrination|indoctrinated]] further. The supporting cast includes [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Ethan Suplee]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]].\n\nMcKenna wrote the script based on his own childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. He sold the script to [[New Line Cinema]], which was impressed by the writing. ''American History X'' was Kaye's first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film's release, Kaye and the film studio were in disagreements about the final cut of the film. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film; thus negatively affecting his directing career.\n\nDistributed by New Line Cinema, the film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998, grossing $23.9 million, against a $20 million budget. ''American History X'' was critically praised, with Norton and Furlong's performances and the film's message drawing acclaim. Norton received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries. A follow-up, ''African History Y'', with Kaye returning as director and starring [[Djimon Hounsou]], was in active development as of 2020.<ref name=\"FollowUp\">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/09/djimon-hounsou-african-history-y-movie-tony-kaye-1234583658/|title=Djimon Hounsou Joins Tony Kaye's ''African History Y''|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=2020-09-24|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|access-date=2020-09-25|archive-date=2020-09-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929171926/https://deadline.com/2020/09/djimon-hounsou-african-history-y-movie-tony-kaye-1234583658/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school student Danny Vinyard antagonizes his [[Jewish]] history teacher Murray by choosing to write a civil rights essay on ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. [[African-American]] principal and [[outreach]] worker Dr. Bob Sweeney tells Danny that he will study history through [[current event]]s or be expelled, calling their class ''American History X''. Danny's first assignment is a paper on his older brother Derek, a past student of Sweeney's and former [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] leader released from prison that day.\n\nYears earlier, Danny and Derek's father, a [[fireman]], was shot and killed by a black drug dealer while putting out a fire at their home. Immediately after his death, Derek erupts in a racist tirade in a televised interview. High-profile white supremacist Cameron Alexander becomes Derek's [[mentor]] and they form their own violent [[white supremacist]] gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.) in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]]. A skilled [[basketball]] player, Derek is dragged into a game against several [[Crips]], winning control of the local courts. Derek organizes an attack on a supermarket employing [[Illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States|illegal Mexican immigrants]].\n\nDerek's mother Doris invites Murray, her boyfriend, for dinner where an argument about [[Rodney King]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] occurs. Derek assaults his sister Davina and openly berates Murray, and Doris tells Derek to leave home. That night, the same group of Crips that Derek had beaten in the basketball game earlier attempt to steal his truck. When Danny alerts Derek to the crime, Derek guns down two of the men, killing one and wounding another, before [[curb stomp]]ing the wounded man, much to Danny's horror. He is arrested and sentenced to three years in the [[California Institution for Men]] for [[voluntary manslaughter]].\n\nIn prison, Derek joins the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and befriends a black inmate named Lamont. Derek becomes disgusted and disillusioned by [[prison gang]] politics; he believes in the ideology, but disapproves of the gang's dealings with non-white gangs and involvement in drug dealing, thinking that the members are only using the philosophy of white supremacy out of convenience. He loses his belief further when his friends in the D.O.C. never visit him in prison. He ultimately abandons the Aryan Brotherhood, who beat and [[prison rape|rape]] him in the shower in retaliation. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison; promising to leave town and never come back. Sweeney rebukes Derek and reveals his own racist past, much to Derek's shock, and warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. to follow in his footsteps which upsets Derek further. After recovering and leaving the hospital wing, Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood while Lamont warns that he may be targeted by African-American gangs now that he is no longer under the Aryan Brotherhood's protection. An attack never comes, and Derek spends the remainder of his sentence alone. When he is released, Derek thanks Lamont, whom he realizes intervened on his behalf.\n\nReturning home, Derek finds Danny emulating him, sporting a D.O.C. [[tattoo]] and becoming a [[White power skinhead|skinhead]]. Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, but Danny feels betrayed. Derek's best friend Seth, also a D.O.C. member, frequently disrespects Derek's mother and sister while grooming Danny for the gang; Seth and Danny are closely controlled by Cameron. During a party at the D.O.C\u2019s compound, Derek confronts Cameron and calls him out for using him only to abandon him for three years; declaring his departure from the gang and refusal to allow them to use Danny the same way, he brutally beats Cameron when the man mocks him. Seth and the others, including Derek's ex-girlfriend Stacey, turn against Derek. Seth holds Derek at gunpoint, but Derek easily disarms him and holds everyone at gunpoint before fleeing with his brother.\n\nAfterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. The pair return home and remove hateful posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on his reasons for adopting white supremacist values, and their flaws. Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a [[diner]] for breakfast. Sweeney and a police officer inform Derek that Seth and Cameron were attacked the night before and are in an [[intensive care unit]]. Derek denies having any knowledge or involvement and reluctantly agrees to inspect the people he denounced. In the boys' bathroom, Danny is shot dead by a black student that he had confronted the day before. Derek runs to the school, and finding Danny's body, mournfully cradles him while blaming himself for influencing Danny's views and actions which led to it. In a [[narration|voiceover]], Danny reads the final lines of his paper for Dr. Sweeney, quoting the final stanza of [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Derek Vinyard\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Danny Vinyard\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Doris Vinyard\n* [[Jennifer Lien]] as Davina Vinyard\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Seth Ryan\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Stacey\n* [[Avery Brooks]] as Dr. Bob Sweeney\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Murray\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cameron Alexander\n* [[William Russ]] as Dennis Vinyard\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Lamont \n* [[Joseph Cortese]] as Rasmussen\n* Alex Sol as Mitch McCormick\n* Jason Bose Smith as Little Henry \n* Antonio David Lyons as Lawrence\n* [[Keram Malicki-S\u00e1nchez]] as Chris\n* [[Giuseppe Andrews]] as Jason\n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Daryl Dawson\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as McMahon\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Michael De Luca 2012.jpg|alt=Michael De Luca, former president of productions at New Line Cinema|thumb|187x187px|[[Michael De Luca]], former production president at New Line Cinema.]]\nScreenwriter [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] wrote the screenplay for ''American History X'' and sold the rights to New Line Cinema when he was 26.<ref>Writers on Writing Series 2007: ''A Conversation with David McKenna'', [2007], First Light Video Publishing.</ref> The inspiration for the story came from the [[Punk rock|punk-rock]] scene of McKenna's childhood, where he often witnessed violent behavior. \"I saw a lot of bigotry growing up, and it made me think about writing something about the world of hate-mongers.
