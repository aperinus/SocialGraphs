The film was a box office success, grossing $87.7 million against its budget of $3 million.<ref name=\"numbers\"/> In the years since its release, the film has developed a reputation for its scariness and become a [[Cult film|cult classic]]. A 2020 study by Broadband Choices named ''Sinister'' the scariest film ever made based on an analysis of viewer heart rates. \n\nA [[Sinister 2|sequel]] was released in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n[[True crime]] writer Ellison Oswalt moves into a home in the fictional town of Chatford, [[Pennsylvania]] with his wife Tracy, their 12-year-old son, Trevor, and their 7-year-old daughter, Ashley. Unbeknownst to his wife and kids, Ellison has moved them into the home where the Stevenson family was murdered by [[hanging]]. He intends to write a book about the case, to regain the fame he lost after his bestselling book ''Kentucky Blood'' was followed by two less successful books. He hopes to learn the fate of 10-year-old Stephanie Stevenson, who disappeared following the murders.\n\nEllison finds a box in the attic that contains a [[scorpion]], as well as a projector and reels of [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] footage, each labeled as [[home movies]]. The films are [[Snuff film|footage]] of different families being murdered in various ways, each with a related but innocuous title, such as a mass drowning marked as \"Pool Party '66.\" Each murder is performed by the unseen camera operator. Ellison notes the appearance of a mysterious symbol and a strange, ominous figure in the films. Ellison matches footage of a throat-slitting murder to news reports from [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1998. Three members of the Miller family were murdered, while 13-year-old Christopher Miller disappeared. One night, Ellison investigates noises in the attic. Inside the film reels' canister lid, he finds a [[Kingsnake|king snake]] and childlike drawings depicting the murders, with a strange figure called \"Mr. Boogie\" also present. At one point, Ellison encounters a [[Rottweiler]] in the backyard.\n\nEllison consults a local deputy and discovers that the filmed murders took place at different times and in different cities across the country dating back to 1966. A child from each family disappeared following every murder. And before the Stevensons moved to Chatford, they lived in the Miller's former home. The deputy refers Ellison to [[occult]] specialist Professor Jonas, to decipher the symbol in the films. Jonas relates the symbol to the ancient and obscure [[pagan]] deity Bughuul, who would kill entire families and take one of their children to consume their soul slowly. Jonas suspects the murders are part of a cult [[initiation rite]], rather than the work of a single person. As Ellison investigates footsteps and noises throughout the house one night, it is revealed that ghost-like children invisible to Ellison are the cause, with one of them appearing in Ashley's room. Ashley later paints this child, who she identifies as Stephanie Stevenson, on the wall. Another night, Ellison hears the film projector running and finds the missing children seated in the attic watching one of the films. Bughuul appears on camera before physically appearing before Ellison. Ellison takes the camera, projector, and films outside and burns them. He tells Tracy that they are moving back to their old house.\n\nJonas sends Ellison, now back at his old home, historical [[Religious images in Christian theology|images]] associated with Bughuul, including the mysterious symbol and three symbolic animals that Ellison encountered at the Stevenson house: a scorpion, a snake, and a dog. [[Early Christians]] believed that images of Bughuul served as a gateway for the demon to come from the spiritual realm to the mortal world, and Bughuul can possess children who come into contact with these images. Ellison discovers the unharmed projector and films in his attic, along with a new film labeled \"Extended Cut Endings\". The deputy calls Ellison and informs him that every murdered family had once lived in the house where the previous murder took place. He also learns from Professor Jonas the pattern: each new murder occurred shortly after the family moved from the crime scene into a new residence, traced back to the murder of the Martinez family by arson in 1979 after they moved to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], California, from the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon, site of the 1966 drownings. By moving away from the Stevenson house, Ellison has marked himself and his family as the next victims. The new footage depicts the missing children coming onscreen following each murder, revealing themselves to be the killers under Bughuul's influence.\n\nEllison becomes lightheaded and notices a green liquid at the bottom of his coffee mug, along with a note from Ashley that says, \"Good night, Daddy,\" before losing consciousness. He awakes to find himself, Tracy, and Trevor bound and gagged on the floor. Ashley, having been influenced by the spirit of Stephanie Stevenson to fall under Bughuul's possession, approaches them while filming with the 8&nbsp;mm camera. She tells her father that she will make him \"famous again\", and proceeds to murder her family with an axe. She then uses their blood to paint pictures on the walls of the hallway, along with Bughuul's symbol on a door. Ashley views the film of her murders while drawing the murder in the lid of the home movies box. The missing children stare at her through the film but flee when Bughuul appears. He lifts Ashley into his arms and teleports into the film. The box of films sits in the Oswalt family's attic, now accompanied by Ashley's reel titled ''House Painting '12''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Ellison Oswalt\n* [[Juliet Rylance]] as Tracy Oswalt\n* [[Fred Thompson]] as Sheriff\n* [[James Ransone]] as Deputy\n* Michael Hall D'Addario as Trevor Oswalt\n* [[Clare Foley]] as Ashley Oswalt\n\nAdditionally, Nick King portrays Bughuul / Mr. Boogie. Featured as the children under Bughuul's control are Victoria Leigh as Stephanie, [[Cameron Ocasio]] as BBQ Boy, Danielle Kotch as Lawn Girl, Ethan Haberfield as the Pool Party Boy, and Blake Mizrahi as Sleepy Time Boy. An uncredited [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] plays Professor Jonas.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWriter [[C. Robert Cargill]] says that his inspiration for ''Sinister'' came from a nightmare he experienced after seeing ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', in which he discovered a film in his attic depicting the hanging of an entire family. This scenario became the setup for the plot of ''Sinister''.<ref>[http://www.screengeek.co.uk/features/article/interview-sinister-writer-c-robert-cargill Interview: Sinister Writer Cargill] Screen Geek</ref> In creating a villain for the film, Cargill conceptualized a new take on the [[Bogeyman]], calling the entity \"Mr. Boogie\". Cargill's idea was that the creature would be both terrifying and seductive to children, luring them to their dooms as a sinister [[Willy Wonka]]-like figure.<ref name=\"fearnet.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/news-article/exclusive-how-sinister-brought-mr-boogie-life/|title=How Sinister Brought Mr. Boogie to Life|publisher=[[Fearnet]]|access-date=2013-06-16}}</ref>\n\nCargill and co-writer Scott Derrickson ultimately decided to downplay the creature's alluring nature, only intimating how it manipulates the children into murder. In further developing Mr. Boogie, the pair had lengthy discussions about its nature, deciding not to make it a [[demon]] but rather a [[pagan]] deity, in order to place it outside the conceptual scope of any one particular religion. Consequently, the villain was given the proper name \"Bughuul\", with only the child characters in the film referring to it as Mr. Boogie.<ref name=\"fearnet.com\"/><ref name=\"io9\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20121013032857/http://io9.com/5951007/how-internet-art-inspired-the-monster-in-ethan-hawkes-sinister How Internet Art Inspired the Monster in Ethan Hawke's Sinister] io9.com</ref>\n\n===Design===\nIn crafting a look for Bughuul, Cargill initially kept to the idea of a sinister [[Willy Wonka]] before realizing that audiences might find it \"silly\" and kill the potential for the film becoming a series. Looking for inspiration, Derrickson typed the word \"horror\" into [[flickr]] and searched through 500,000 images. He narrowed the images down to 15, including a photograph of a [[ghoul]] which was [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] simply \"Natalie\". Cargill was particularly struck by \"Natalie\" and decided: \"What if it's just this guy?\". He and Derrickson contacted the photographer and purchased the rights to use the image for $500. Derrickson explained that the image appealed to him because it reminded him of the makeup and costumes worn by performers in [[black metal]], while remaining unique enough so as not to be directly linked to the genre; Derrickson had previously researched black metal while looking for inspiration for Bughuul's symbol, which is ritualistically painted at the scene of each of the film's murder sequences.<ref name=\"fearnet.com\"/><ref name=\"io9\"/> Some of the background music for these murder sequences was taken from ambient tracks by bands associated with the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal scene]], including [[Ulver]] and [[:de:Aghast|Aghast]].<ref>[http://the-end-of-summer.blogspot.com/2012/11/sinister-other-soundtrack.html Sinister: The \"Other\" Soundtrack].
