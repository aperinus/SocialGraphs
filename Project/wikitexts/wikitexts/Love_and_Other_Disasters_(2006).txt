She shares an apartment with her gay friend Peter Simon, a screenwriter. Afraid to be disappointed by a serious relationship, Jacks prefers to spend her free time with her friends and sleep with her ex-boyfriend, James, whom she does not love.\n\nPeter, who has never been in a relationship, spends too much time in his dreams and as a result cannot fall in love with a real person. It gets more complicated with the entrance of Paolo, a photography assistant for one of the photographers at Vogue.  As the film develops, they come to realize their mistakes and eventually reach their happy endings.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Emily 'Jacks' Jackson\n* [[Matthew Rhys]] as Peter Simon\n* [[Santiago Cabrera]] as Paolo Sarmiento\n* [[Catherine Tate]] as Tallulah Riggs-Wentworth \n* [[Elliot Cowan]] as James Wildstone\n* [[Adam Rayner]] as Tom / Fantasy David\n* [[Jamie Sives]] as Finlay McMillian\n* [[Will Keen]] as David Williams\n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Anscombre as Sascha Santori\n* [[Stephanie Beacham]] as Felicity Riggs-Wentworth\n* Daniel Lob\u00e9 as Freedom\n* Sam Bloom as Pandora\n* Jamie Honeybourne as Unicorn Gallagher\n* Robert Chilcott as art patron\n* [[Dawn French]] as therapist\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Marvin Bernstein\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as herself playing Jacks (cameo)\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as himself playing Paolo (cameo)\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nDavid Rooney of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"wanly conceived effort looks an unlikely bet for significant bigscreen dates\" and \"Keshishian\u2019s script is sloppy in both setting up and sustaining the sexual identity confusion that fuels the comic engine\".<ref name=\"Rooney\">{{cite news |last1=Rooney |first1=David |title=Love and Other Disasters |url=https://variety.com/2006/film/markets-festivals/love-and-other-disasters-1200513568/ |access-date=20 March 2019 |date=10 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nGreg Hernandez of Out in Hollywood called it \"a damned entertaining film\", \"well-written and well-directed by Alek Keshishian and wonderfully acted\" and \"includes a hilarious scene featuring cameos by Gwyneth Paltrow and Orlando Bloom.\"<ref name=\"Hernandez\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0452643}}\n* {{AllMovie title|326488}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1194842_love_and_other_disasters}}\n\n{{Alek Keshishian}}\n{{Luc Besson}}\n\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:2006 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:British LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:British romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:EuropaCorp films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alek Keshishian]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Luc Besson]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Paris]]\n[[Category:French LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:French romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Alek Keshishian]]\n\n\n{{2000s-romantic-comedy-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
