After the children fall asleep, passion and decadence ensue in an increasingly humorous and zany series of encounters.\n\nKurt and Charlotte introduce a bong and the four adults get high. Soon after they get in the pool and Kurt insists on skinny dipping, which Alex is very hesitant to do for fear of exposing his small penis.\n\nEmily joins Charlotte on an errand to pick up more alcohol, but Charlotte stops off at a massage parlor, where she jacks off a man while Emily watches through a peephole.\n\nBack at the house, Emily warns Alex that Kurt and Charlotte are swingers. Alex and Emily argue about their sex life before Kurt reveals that he is sexually attracted to Alex. Slowly, the four adults begin to engage in an orgy, but their children burst into the room, the morning having arrived.\n\nDays later, Alex and Emily run into Kurt, Charlotte and their son at the park, and share an amiable exchange.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] as Alex\n*[[Taylor Schilling]] as Emily\n*[[Jason Schwartzman]] as Kurt\n*[[Judith Godr\u00e8che]] as Charlotte\n*RJ Hermes as RJ\n*Max Moritt as Max\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 23, 2015, with distribution rights bought by [[The Orchard (company)|The Orchard]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Ramin Setoodeh,Brent Lang |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/sundance-sex-comedy-the-overnight-acquired-by-the-orchard-exclusive-1201415028/ |title='The Overnight,' A Sex Comedy Starring Adam Scott, Goes to The Orchard |website=Variety.com |date=2015-01-26 |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref> The film screened at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]], on March 14, 2015,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sxsw.com/film/screenings/2015-lineup |title=SXSW Film Festival 2015 Lineup &#124; South by Southwest 2015 Music, Film and Interactive Festivals - Austin Texas |website=Sxsw.com |access-date=2015-06-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525101041/http://sxsw.com/film/screenings/2015-lineup |archive-date=May 25, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> the [[Tribeca Film Festival]], on April 21, 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/overnight-2015 |title=The Overnight &#124; Tribeca Film Festival |website=Tribecafilm.com |date= |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref> as well as at the [[Florida Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.floridafilmfestival.com/program/films/the-overnight |title=2015 Florida Film Festival |website=Floridafilmfestival.com |date= |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref> The Independent Boston Film Festival, the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], the [[deadCENTER Film Festival]], the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]], the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]], and the [[Nantucket Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iffboston.org/2015-films/ |title=2015: April 22-29 |website=IFFBoston.org |date= |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/overnight |title=Closing Night Gala: The Overnight |website=SIFF.net |date= |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadcenterfilm.org/festival/2015-festival-schedule |title=deadCenter Film Festival :: 2015 Festival Schedule |website=Deadcenterfilm.org |date= |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Pedersen |first=Erik |url=https://deadline.com/2015/05/los-angeles-film-festival-lineup-la-live-1201421056/ |title=Los Angeles Film Festival Lineup Announced |publisher=Deadline |date=2015-05-05 |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/films/2015/the-overnight |title=The Overnight &#124; Programme &#124; Edinburgh International Film Festival 2015 |website=Edfilmfest.org.uk |date= |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nantucketfilmfestival.org/2015/04/30/heres-your-first-look-at-the-overnight/ |title=Here's Your First Look at The Overnight |publisher=Nantucket Film Festival |date=2015-04-30 |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref>\n\nThe film opened in a [[limited release]] in the [[United States]] on June 19, 2015, and opened in the [[United Kingdom]] on June 26, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Sneider |url=https://www.thewrap.com/jason-schwartzman-seduces-adam-scott-taylor-schilling-in-the-overnight-trailer-video/ |title=Jason Schwartzman Seduces Adam Scott, Taylor Schilling in 'The Overnight' Trailer (Video) |publisher=[[TheWrap]] |date=2015-04-20 |access-date=2015-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Patrick |last=Brice |url=https://twitter.com/patrick_brice/status/606498813247782914 |title=@JClellandx Yes it will be out in UK cinemas on June 26th!
