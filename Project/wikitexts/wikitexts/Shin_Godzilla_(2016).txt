After seeing a [[viral video]] of the incident, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Rando Yaguchi theorizes that it was caused by a living creature. His theory is confirmed when news reports show a massive tail emerging from the ocean. Shortly thereafter, the creature moves inland and crawls through the [[Kamata, Tokyo|Kamata district]] of [[Tokyo]] in the midst of inadequate evacuation. The creature leaves a path of destruction and numerous casualties, and evolves into a bipedal red-skinned form before it begins to overheat and returns to the sea.\n\nThe government officials focus on military strategy and civilian safety, while Yaguchi is put in charge of a task force to research the creature. Due to high radiation readings from the creatures path, the group realizes that it is energized by [[nuclear fission]]. The [[United States|U.S.]] sends a special envoy, Kayoco Anne Patterson, who reveals that a disgraced, vehemently anti-nuclear [[zoology]] professor, Goro Maki, had been studying mutations caused by radioactive contamination and theorized the appearance of the creature, but he was disbelieved by both American and Japanese scientific circles. The U.S. then prevented him from making his conclusions public. The abandoned yacht discovered in Tokyo Bay was Maki's, and he left his research notes, jumbled into a code, in the boat before disappearing.\n\nThe creature, named [[Godzilla]] after Maki's research, reappears in its fourth-form, now twice its original size, and makes landfall near [[Kamakura]] en route for Tokyo. The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] mobilize, but their attacks have no effect and they are forced to withdraw when Godzilla breaks through their defenses into the city. The U.S. intervenes with a massively-destructive air strike plan, prompting the evacuation of civilians and government personnel. U.S. [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 bombers]] wound Godzilla with [[Massive Ordnance Penetrator|MOP]] \"[[bunker-buster]]\" bombs. Godzilla recovers quickly and responds with highly destructive atomic rays fired from its mouth and dorsal plates, destroying the helicopter carrying the prime minister along with top government officials, all of the B-2s, as well as incinerating and irradiating large swaths of Tokyo. Depleting its energy, Godzilla enters a [[Dormancy|dormant state]] and becomes immobile.\n\nYaguchi's team discovers that Godzilla's plates and blood work as a cooling system and theorize that they could use a [[Coagulation|coagulating]] agent to freeze it. After analyzing tissue samples, they find that Godzilla is an ever-evolving creature, able to [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|reproduce asexually]]. The [[United Nations]], aware of this, informs Japan that thermonuclear weapons will be used against Godzilla should the Japanese fail to subdue it on their own in a few days. Evacuations are ordered in multiple prefectures in preparation for the nuclear attack. Unwilling to see [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons detonated in Japan]] again, Patterson uses her political connections to buy time for Yaguchi's team, in whom the interim government has little faith.\n\nYaguchi's team has a breakthrough when they decipher Goro Maki's encoded research using origami. They adjust their plan and procure the means to conduct their deep freeze plan with international support. Mere hours before the planned nuclear attack, Japan enacts the deep freeze plan. Godzilla is provoked into expending its atomic breath and energy against American drones. The team then detonates explosives in nearby buildings and in trains sent towards Godzilla's feet, knocking the monster down and giving tankers full of coagulant an opportunity to inject it into Godzilla's mouth. Though many are killed in the process, Godzilla is frozen solid. In the aftermath, it is discovered that the Godzilla fallout has a very short [[half-life]] and that Tokyo can soon be reconstructed. The international community agrees to cancel the nuclear attack but has the new Japanese government agree that, in the event of Godzilla's reawakening, an immediate thermonuclear strike will be executed. On Godzilla's tail, humanoid creatures appear frozen in the process of emerging.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hiroki Hasegawa]] as Rando Yaguchi, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary.<ref name=\"rag13\">{{cite web|url=http://augustragone.blogspot.com/2016/04/tohos-upcoming-shin-godzilla-revealed.html|title=Toho's Upcoming \"Shin Godzilla\" Revealed \u2013 Images & Trailer from Godzilla Resurgence!|last=Ragone|first=August|work=The Good, the Bad, and Godzilla|date=April 13, 2016|access-date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> After Toho offered him the role, Hasegawa immediately accepted, stating, \"Who wouldn't want to be involved in a ''Godzilla'' production?\".<ref name=\"rag22\"/>\n*[[Yutaka Takenouchi]] as Hideki Akasaka, Aide to Prime Minister.<ref name=\"rag13\"/> Takenouchi stated that the film would contain a \"deeper message\".<ref name=\"rag22\"/>\n*[[Satomi Ishihara]] as Kayoco Anne Patterson, Special Envoy for the President of the United States.<ref name=\"rag13\"/> She became excited after accepting the role but stressed that her character features \"English-heavy dialogue\", stating, \"Sometimes it's so frustrating, I just want to cry\".<ref name=\"rag22\"/>\n\nThe film features several cameos and supporting appearances, including [[Kengo Kora]], [[Ren Osugi]], [[Akira Emoto]], [[Kimiko Yo]], [[Jun Kunimura]], [[Mikako Ichikawa]], [[Pierre Taki]], [[Takumi Saito]], [[Keisuke Koide]], [[Arata Furuta]], [[Sei Hiraizumi]], [[Kenichi Yajima]], [[Tetsu Watanabe]], [[Ken Mitsuishi]], [[Ky\u016bsaku Shimada]], [[Kanji Tsuda]], [[Issei Takahashi]], [[Shinya Tsukamoto]], [[Kazuo Hara]], [[Isshin Inudo]], [[Akira Ogata (film director)|Akira Ogata]], [[Shingo Tsurumi]], [[Suzuki Matsuo]], [[Kreva (rapper)|Kreva]], [[Katsuhiko Yokomitsu]], and [[Atsuko Maeda]].<ref name=\"rag13\"/> [[Mansai Nomura]] portrayed Godzilla through motion capture.<ref name=\"mocap\"/> Jun Kunimura previously appeared in ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]''.

Since it was concocted to be released in 2018, the shortest time possible for a domestic-made ''Godzilla'' film to be released, it was a rough draft for people who wouldn't like ''Shin Godzilla'', an idea that wouldn't cost too much or take too long to create. I believed that it would be a bad idea to let it go to waste so I gave the proposal, draft, and visuals, as a gift to Mr. Higuchi and Toho, but since it was premature or whatever, among other reasons, after the film's release the discussion ended.
