It is the sixth and final Eon film to star [[Sean Connery]], who returned to the role as the fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], having declined to reprise the role in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969).\n\nThe film is based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1956 [[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|novel of the same name]] and is the second of four ''James Bond'' films directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The story has Bond impersonating a diamond smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring and soon uncovering a plot by his old enemy [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] to use the diamonds to build a space-based laser weapon. Bond has to battle his enemy for one last time to stop the smuggling and stall Blofeld's plan of destroying [[Washington, D.C.]] and extorting the world with nuclear supremacy.\n\nAfter [[George Lazenby]] left the series, producers [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]] tested other actors, but studio [[United Artists]] wanted Connery back, paying a then-record $1.25&nbsp;million salary for him to return. The producers were inspired by ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''; as with that film, Guy Hamilton was hired to direct, and [[Shirley Bassey]] performed vocals on the title theme song. Locations included [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], California, and [[Amsterdam]]. ''Diamonds Are Forever'' was a commercial success and received generally positive reviews initially, though retrospective reviews were more negative.  It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Sound]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. -->\nJames Bond\u2014agent 007\u2014pursues [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and eventually finds him at a facility where Blofeld look-alikes are being created through surgery. Bond kills a test subject, and later the \"real\" Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud. While assassins [[Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd]] systematically kill several diamond smugglers, [[M (James Bond)|M]] suspects that [[South Africa]]n diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]], and assigns Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to [[Amsterdam]] to meet contact [[Tiffany Case]]. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it seem like Franks is Bond. Tiffany and Bond then go to [[Los Angeles]], smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse.\n\nAt the airport Bond meets his CIA ally [[Felix Leiter]], then travels to [[Las Vegas]]. At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds are passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him in a cremation oven, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes, planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond tells Leiter to ship the real diamonds. Bond then goes to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond discovers there that Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd, who did not know that the diamonds were fake.\n\nAt the [[craps]] table Bond meets the opportunistic [[Bond girl|Plenty O'Toole]], and after gambling, brings her to his room. Gang members ambush them, throwing O'Toole out the window and into the pool. Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany, instructing her to retrieve the diamonds at the [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]] casino. Tiffany reneges on her deal and flees, passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds&nbsp;\u2014 a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. When Bond's cover is blown, he escapes by stealing a [[moon buggy]] and reunites with Tiffany.\n\nBond scales the walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two identical Blofelds, who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, which turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, picked up by Wint and Kidd and taken out to [[Las Vegas Valley]], where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. Bond escapes, then calls Blofeld, using a similar electronic device to pose as Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, Saxby being killed in the gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a [[sun gun|laser satellite]] using the diamonds, which by now has already been sent into orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.\n\nWhyte identifies an [[oil platform]] off the coast of [[Baja California]] as Blofeld's base of operations. After Bond's attempt to change the cassette containing the satellite control codes fails due to a mistake by Tiffany, a helicopter attack on the oil rig is launched by Leiter and the CIA. Blofeld tries to escape in a [[midget submarine]]. Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed. Bond and Tiffany then head for Britain on a [[SS Canberra|cruise ship]], where Wint and Kidd pose as room-service stewards and attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb. Bond kills them instead.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond]]: [[United Kingdom|British]] MI6 agent 007.\n* [[Jill St. John]] as [[Tiffany Case]]: A diamond smuggler.\n* [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] as [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]: The head of [[SPECTRE]] and Bond's arch-enemy.

The Garden of Remembrance scene was shot at Palm Downtown Cemetery, Las Vegas.

The pool was steeped in a way that made the block move deeper with each take. Eventually, Wood was submerged but was noticed by on-lookers and rescued before actually drowning.
