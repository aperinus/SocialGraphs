It is a sequel to the 1987 film ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' and the second installment in the [[Lethal Weapon (franchise)|''Lethal Weapon'' film series]].\n\nGibson and Glover respectively reprise their roles as LAPD officers [[Martin Riggs]] and [[Roger Murtaugh]], who protect an irritating federal witness (Pesci), while taking on a gang of South African drug dealers hiding behind [[diplomatic immunity]]. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] (for [[Robert G. Henderson]]). The film received mostly positive reviews and earned more than $227 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo years after the events of the first film, [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] sergeants [[Martin Riggs]] and [[Roger Murtaugh]] are pursuing unidentified suspects transporting an illegal shipment of gold [[krugerrand]]s. The [[Afrikaner]] [[apartheid]] government of [[South Africa]] subsequently orders Los Angeles [[consul-general]] Arjen Rudd and security agent Pieter Vorstedt to warn both detectives off the investigation; they are reassigned to protecting an obnoxious federal witness, Leo Getz, after an attack on Murtaugh's home.\n\nIt soon becomes clear that both cases are related: after an attempt on Leo's life, Riggs and Murtaugh learn of the former's murky past [[money laundering|laundering funds]] for vengeful drug smugglers. Leo leads them to the gang, but upon dispatching his would-be assassin and returning with backup they are confronted by Rudd, who invokes [[diplomatic immunity]] on behalf of his unscrupulous \"associates.\"\n\nThough instructed to leave the case alone, Riggs begins to openly harass the South African consulate, defying Rudd and romancing his secretary, Rika van den Haas, a liberal-minded [[Afrikaner]] who despises her boss and his racial philosophy. Murtaugh enlists Leo's help in creating a scene at the consulate that wins the support of anti-apartheid protesters outside. Vorstedt is dispatched to murder all of the officers investigating them while Murtaugh deduces that Rudd is attempting to ship funds from his smuggling ring in the United States to [[Cape Town]] via [[Port of Los Angeles|Los Angeles Harbor]]. Two assassins attack Murtaugh at his home, but he kills them both with his [[general contractor|contractor]]'s [[nail gun]], though Leo is abducted in the process.\n\nAfter killing many of the investigating officers, Vorstedt seizes Riggs at van den Haas' apartment and discloses that he was responsible for the death of Riggs's wife years earlier during a botched assassination attempt on him. He has his men kill Rika by drowning her and orders them to do the same to Riggs, who escapes and brutally kills both of the men. He phones Murtaugh, declaring an intention to pursue Rudd and avenge his wife, Rika, and their fallen friends; the other policeman willingly forsakes his badge to aid his partner. After rescuing Leo and destroying Rudd's house, they head for the ''Alba Varden'', Rudd's freighter docked in the Port of Los Angeles, as the South Africans prepare their getaway with hundreds of millions in drug money.\n\nWhile investigating a guarded 40 foot cargo container at the docks, Riggs and Murtaugh are locked inside by Rudd's men. They break out of the box, scattering two pallets of Rudd's drug money into the harbor in the process. Riggs and Murtaugh engage in a firefight with some of Rudd's men aboard the ''Alba Varden'' before separating to hunt down Rudd.  Riggs confronts and fights Vorstedt hand-to-hand, culminating when Riggs stabs Vorstedt with his own knife and crushes him by dropping a [[cargo container]] on him. Rudd retaliates by shooting Riggs in the back multiple times. Rudd again invokes diplomatic immunity upon seeing Murtaugh aim his gun at him; Murtaugh fatally shoots him. He then tends to Riggs, sharing a laugh with him as more LAPD personnel respond to the scene.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Mel Gibson]] as Detective [[Martin Riggs]]\n*[[Danny Glover]] as Detective [[Roger Murtaugh]]\n*[[Joe Pesci]] as Leo Getz\n*[[Joss Ackland]] as Arjen Rudd\n*[[Derrick O'Connor]] as Pieter Vorstedt\n*[[Patsy Kensit]] as Rika van den Haas\n*[[Darlene Love]] as Trish Murtaugh\n*[[Steve Kahan]] as Captain Ed Murphy\n*[[Mark Rolston]] as Hans\n*[[Jenette Goldstein]] as Detective Meagan Shapiro\n*[[Dean Norris]] as Detective Tim Cavanaugh\n*[[Nestor Serrano]] as Detective Eddie Estaban\n*[[Grand L.

Producer [[Joel Silver]] asked writer of the first film [[Shane Black]] to write the script for the sequel in the spring of 1987 and Black agreed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/03/movies/at-the-movies.html|title=AT THE MOVIES|date=3 April 1987|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref> Although he was struggling with personal issues, Black still managed to write the first draft along with his friend, novelist [[Warren Murphy]], co-creator of [[Remo Williams]] (the lead character of ''[[The Destroyer (novel series)|The Destroyer]]'' novels). Their original title for the script was ''Play Dirty''. Although many people thought that their script was brilliant, it was rejected by Silver, studio and director Richard Donner for being too dark and bloody, and because in the ending of the script Riggs dies, while they wanted to keep him alive in case of further sequels. They also wanted the second film to focus more on comedy, while Black's draft focused more on courage and heroics, like Riggs willing to die to protect Murtaugh and his family, due to his love for them.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/01/entertainment/ca-black1/2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506203603/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/01/entertainment/ca-black1/2|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 May 2016|title=The end of a fade for Black|first=Strawberry|last=Saroyan|date=1 May 2005|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theplaylist.net/shane-black-talks-predator-details-defending-mel-gibson-lethal-weapon-5-20160521/2/|title=Lethal Weapon II|quote= \"It was clear, at the end of our draft [co-written with friend Warren Murphy] \u2014 which was pretty melancholy \u2014 that wasn't really where [the studio] wanted to go. But there's a lot of elements that are [ours] in ''Lethal Weapon 2'' \u2014 we still received a 'story by' credit.  I recognized things when I watched \"Lethal Weapon 2\" that was in the script that we wrote, but the tone is totally different.\"|website=Theplaylist.net|access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref>\n\nWhen his script was rejected, Black felt that he had failed the producers. He initially offered to give his payment back, but his agent talked him out of it. Black also refused to re-write the script and quit from the project after working for six months on it. Black later said how the problem with the second film was that they did too much comedy, and how he dislikes the third and fourth films because of the way Riggs' character was changed.\n\nThe final version of the script written by [[Jeffrey Boam]] that was used for filming was completely different from Black's draft, other than the scene where the stilt house is destroyed. The character of Leo Getz was originally a minor character in Black's draft with only one scene and few lines of dialogue. Some of the other differences include more graphic violence throughout the script, which included the South Africans being even more vicious than in the final film; at one point Shapiro, the female police officer working with Riggs and Murtaugh, is tortured to death by them. There was also a scene where Riggs gets tortured by them in a similar way to how he was in first film, but a lot worse. There was also an action scene in the script where a plane full of cocaine gets destroyed and cocaine falls over Los Angeles \"like snow\". In Black's script the final battle took place on hills covered with a big brush fire, and after destruction of the stilt house Riggs chases the main villain Benedict (Pieter Vorstedt in the film), a much different and more dangerous character in original script and Riggs' \"arch-nemesis and worst nightmare\" according to Black, into the heart of the fire, after which Riggs gets stabbed and dies slowly from his wounds. The last scene in the script was Murtaugh watching the video tape that Riggs made before the final battle since he knew that he was going to die, and on which he says goodbye to Murtaugh. Black's reason for killing Riggs in his draft of the script, as he said in an interview, was that in first film Riggs was a \"suicidal mess\" who did not care about living or dying but his friendship with Murtaugh and his family was what helped him, and him sacrificing himself to save them would be the last thing he would have to do to be fully at peace. Black also said how the death scene he wrote for Riggs was \"beautiful\" and would make the audience cry. Black later labeled his rejected ''Play Dirty'' script \"the best thing I ever wrote\" and said he learned to trust his instincts after this experience. Black's script was never released and despite attempts by fans to find a copy of it, it remains unreleased.<ref>Shane Black, Empire Magazine interview; \"The problem was that with Lethal Weapon 2 they did a lot of comedy. My draft had one scene with Joe Pesci's guy. He had a few lines. In their version, they had essentially the same character but throughout the entire script. It's all about edge to me.\" About Riggs dying in his script; \"This guy who was gradually brought back to life and brought back into the real world, and he can let his guard down and learn to accept the love of real people, and in my version of the sequel that's the very love for that family that makes him say 'ok, now I gotta go back and die, basically, to protect them'. And they didn't like that idea.\"</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-01/entertainment/ca-54_1_shane-black|title=Close Call for Mel|date=1 January 1989|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/i-like-violence|title=Lethal Weapon II|quote=\"It's the best thing I ever wrote.

Audiences in test screenings responded well to Riggs' survival, and this was kept, though the last shot in the film with the camera moving away from Murtaugh holding Riggs was shot for the ending in which he dies.<ref>Lethal Weapon 2, Director Richard Donner's Blu-Ray commentary</ref>\n\n===Jeffrey Boam's final script===\nWhen the original Shane Black screenplay was changed, he left the series. The rewrites that resulted in the final film are by [[Jeffrey Boam]] (screenwriter for ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' and ''[[The Lost Boys]]''). Boam also did some uncredited re-writing of the script for the first film when Donner thought that some parts of it were too dark and violent.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Boam initially wrote two different drafts for his re-write of '' Lethal Weapon 2''; one which was hard-boiled action script and one which had more comedy. He was told to mix the two drafts together and make a new one that was going to be used for filming. However, not only did Boam end up having to re-write the script many times even before filming started, but he also had to keep re-writing it during production since Donner would always want to improvise something new in a scene or demanded changes to be made on the script in the middle of filming. Boam also wrote the script for ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]'' and he once again had to re-write his script many times before and during filming of that sequel for same reasons. He also wrote an unused draft for the fourth film around January 1995 which had Riggs and Murtaugh fighting against a neo-Nazi survivalist militia group that was committing a terrorist attack in L.A.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-the-last-crusade-of-screenwriter-jeffrey-boam/ |title=Exclusive Interview: The Last Crusade of Screenwriter Jeffrey Boam Assignment X |website=Assignmentx.com |access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/movies/two-summer-blockbusters-one-busy-screenwriter-scene-indiana-jones-last-crusade.html|title=Two Summer Blockbusters, One Busy Screenwriter a scene from ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' (Murray Close)-going for glib|date=6 August 1989|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoccasionalcritic.blogspot.mx/2009/09/jeffrey-boam-interview-1992.html |title=The Occasional Critic: The Jeffrey Boam interview, 1992 |website=Theoccasionalcritic.blogspot.mx |date=2009-09-24 |access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoccasionalcritic.blogspot.mx/2009/09/jeffrey-boam-interview-june-1995.html |title=The Occasional Critic: Jeffrey Boam interview, June 1995 |website=Theoccasionalcritic.blogspot.mx |date=2009-09-30 |access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>The Gross: The Hits, The Flops: The Summer That Ate Hollywood by Peter Bart</ref>\n\nScreenwriter [[Robert Mark Kamen]] said in October 2012 interview for craveonline that during the time when he was working as screenwriter for Warner Bros. and would often do lot of uncredited work on their films, he also worked on ''Lethal Weapon 2'' and ''3''. He said how amongst large chunks of the stuff he added in ''Lethal Weapon 2'' script during re-writes were all the parts with South African villains. Although he was uncredited for his work on this film, he did get a credit for his work on ''Lethal Weapon 3'' because he did a lot more work on that sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/site/197469-not-a-sequel-robert-mark-kamen-on-taken-2-bloodsport-and-karate-kid |title=Not a Sequel: Robert Mark Kamen on Taken 2, Bloodsport and Karate Kid |website=CraveOnline.com |date=2012-10-08 |access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the character of Rika was intended to survive, with the last scene in the film being Riggs and Rika eating [[Thanksgiving]] dinner with the Murtaughs, but the director decided to kill the character to increase Riggs' motivation to destroy the South African drug smugglers. The film was the debut of Leo Getz ([[Joe Pesci]]), a crooked but whistle-blowing [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] who is placed in protective custody by Riggs and Murtaugh, and makes the detectives' more difficult due to his neurotic behavior. The Getz character remained a regular throughout the remainder of the film series.\n\n===Filming===\nThe scene where Riggs is on the road outside Arjen's stilt house and grabs onto the front of the truck (the same scene with the surfboard killing a driver) was filmed on March 21, 1989. The opening chase sequence was filmed on November 28, 1988. The scenes where Riggs and Rika are ambushed by helicopters at night on the beach were filmed at Marineland of the Pacific in [[Rancho Palos Verdes, California]], on \"Cobble Beach\".
