The film follows [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] magician Burt Wonderstone ([[Steve Carell]]) as he attempts to reunite with his former partner Anton Marvelton ([[Steve Buscemi]]) to take on dangerous street magician Steve Gray ([[Jim Carrey]]). It also features [[Alan Arkin]], [[Olivia Wilde]], and [[James Gandolfini]] in his final film appearance during his lifetime.\n\nThe film began development in 2006, when [[New Line Cinema]] bought Kultgen's script, \"Burt Dickenson: The Most Powerful Magician on Planet Earth\". The development process gained momentum when Charles McDougall was hired as director in 2011, but he eventually left the project and was replaced with Scardino. Daley and Goldstein rewrote Kultgen's script which then saw further rewrites from [[Jason Reitman]] in June 2011.\n\nFilming was scheduled to begin in October 2011 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], but was pushed back to January 2012. On a $30 million budget, filming began on January 10, 2012 in [[Nevada]] with filming later moving to Los Angeles. ''The Incredible Burt Wonderstone'' was released on March 15, 2013, and earned over $27 million. Reviews generally praised Carrey's and Arkin's performances, but criticized the plot's inconsistent tone and predictability. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine listed ''The Incredible Burt Wonderstone'' as one of \"Hollywood's biggest box office bombs of 2013\" when it had made $27.4 million against a $30 million production cost.<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite news |author=Variety Staff |date=December 26, 2013 |title=Hollywood's Biggest Box Office Bombs of 2013 |url=https://variety.com/gallery/box-office-disappointments-of-2013/#!2/enders-game/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=January 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1982, young Albert Weinselstein is harassed by bullies. His mother gives him a special [[magic (illusion)|magic trick]] set by veteran magician Rance Holloway as his birthday present. He studies the instructional video and begins to practice some tricks, attracting the attention of a classmate, Anthony Mertz. They practice together and eventually become professional stage magicians Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton, earning them success and an ongoing headlining act at the [[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]]. However, after ten years of performing the same tricks over and over again, Burt has become an overconfident, egocentric prima donna, and Anton begins to get fed up with Burt's ego, which has already cost them previous female assistants, all called \"Nicole\" in the act. In a rush, Burt enlists production assistant Jane as the new Nicole.\n\nBurt and Anton encounter up-and-coming street magician Steve Gray performing a unique yet disturbing card trick for his TV magic show, ''Brain Rapist''. Audience numbers soon dwindle at Burt and Anton's show, upsetting Bally's owner Doug Munny. Taking a cue from Gray's endurance-based stunts, Anton suggests that he and Burt try a similar tack\u2014locking themselves in a [[Plexiglas]] cage called the \"Hot Box\" hung above [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Overconfident, Burt does not prepare for the stunt and almost instantly falls into a panic, causing the stunt to fail and injuring Anton. Anton angrily ends his partnership with Burt, and Jane also quits.\n\nBurt refuses to change his act, staging his two-man show alone to disastrous results. Munny shuts down the production and Burt, having squandered his earnings over the years, is left broke. Despondent, Burt tries to find work and is eventually hired as an entertainer at an [[assisted living|assisted-living facility]] catering to former Vegas entertainers. There, he meets Holloway, who retired several years before because he found that he was no longer happy performing. To show Holloway what the magician industry has become, Burt shows him Gray's performances which include feats such as sleeping all night on hot coals and regurgitating jelly beans. In the process, Burt is shocked to see Jane\u2014herself an aspiring magician\u2014working for Gray. Appalled by Gray's style, Holloway and Burt polish their own tricks. Holloway also counsels Burt about magic, inspiring him to remember the initial wonder that led him to become a magician. Jane visits her grandmother at the facility and patches things up with Burt.\n\nDoug is opening a new casino-hotel and is offering a five-year [[contract]] to the winner of a talent search on the casino's opening night. He invites Burt to do a magic show at his son's birthday party, but Gray also appears and tries to upstage Burt with his own tricks. Disgusted by Gray's actions, Jane leaves his show. Burt reconnects with Anton, who has been distributing magic sets in [[Cambodia]]. A drug found in Cambodia called [[mitragyna speciosa|kratom]] that instantly puts users into a deep sleep gives them an idea to perform a sensational trick that they were never able to perfect: the \"Disappearing Audience\".\n\nAt the talent search show, Gray's performance involves him drilling into his brain; the stunt works too well and leaves Gray with [[brain damage]]. Holloway then introduces Burt, Anton, and Jane's performance before they secretly sedate the audience with kratom sleeping gas to awaken at an outside location in the same seating arrangement. The audience responds with awe, and Doug awards the headlining act to Burt and Anton; they ask Jane to be their opening act. The trio then performs the Disappearing Audience trick again, returning everyone to the casino theater, as the now mentally-impaired Gray watches on with the drill bit still in his skull.\n\nAs the film ends, the final scene shows how Burt, Anton, Holloway and others transported the audience to the open area, by unceremoniously dragging and transporting the unconscious audience members to the area, and hauling them from and to the theater in a moving van.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width1    = 138\n | footer    = [[Steve Carell]] and [[Jim Carrey]] play Burt Wonderstone and Steve Gray, respectively.

There were four different endings, four different final acts including one where Holloway is revealed as a betrayer.<ref name=\"IntDaleyStein\"/> Discussing the script changes which saw the project enter production, producer Chris Bender said: \"...it was tone, finding the right tone, because it was originally written more broadly where certain magic things were happening that wouldn\u2019t actually be real magic and also, over time, the references that we were making in terms of the new school of magic and the old school of magic were becoming dated... Once [Carell] came on board, that\u2019s when things really took off... And then finding the right director, too. These kind of comedies scare directors a lot because you\u2019re taking a chance and you\u2019re going for something bold comedy-wise that either could be a big hit or it could really miss.\"<ref name=\"CastHerbig2\"/> Scenes of the young Wonderstone being inspired by a video of Rance Holloway, and buying a magic set were based on Daley's own childhood, in which he viewed a similar video of magician [[Mark Wilson (magician)|Mark Wilson]].<ref name=\"IntDaleyStein\"/>\n\nIn February 2011, the film found a director in Charles McDougall,<ref name=\"EmpireDirector\"/> but by April 2011, McDougall had left the project with no reason being cited for the departure.<ref name=\"McDougallExit\"/> In June 2011, ''[[30 Rock]]'' director [[Don Scardino]] was confirmed to take the director chair.<ref name=\"DeadlineProduction\"/> On June 16, 2011, [[Jason Reitman]] was brought aboard the project to perform additional rewrites to the Daley/Goldstein script. Reitman was reportedly paid for several weeks of work, but the extent of his involvement or the script changes was not detailed.<ref name=\"ReitmanInvolvement\"/>\n\n[[Michael Schur]], who produced and wrote for Carell on ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', also provided a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"Schur\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/exec/michael-schur/ |title=Michael Schur |date=2014 |website=Variety.com |publisher=Variety |access-date=2 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330054036/https://variety.com/exec/michael-schur/ |archive-date=30 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming had been scheduled to begin in October 2011, in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]],<ref name=\"DeadlineProduction\"/> but was pushed back to January 2012,<ref name=\"CastMohr\"/><ref name=\"THRDec13\"/> with casting of the remaining lead roles occurring throughout October.<ref name=\"VarietyOct3011\"/> [[Principal photography]] began on January 10, 2012,<ref name=\"FilmingJan11A\"/> lasted approximately 47 days and had a $30 million budget.<ref name=\"DeadlineOct3111\"/><ref name=\"IntScardino\"/> The film was shot on [[film stock]] instead of digital because it was decided that the difference in cost between the two was negligible, and the day shooting and color palettes of the magicians' outfits such as black and red were thought to be captured better on the stock.<ref name=\"IntScardino\"/> Among the locations used during the Las Vegas shooting are interiors and exteriors at the [[Bally's Las Vegas]] hotel and casino,<ref name=\"FilmingJan11A\"/> and exteriors of the [[Las Vegas Strip]], [[Downtown Las Vegas]],<ref name=\"FilmingJan912\"/> [[Fremont Street]], and [[Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel]].<ref name=\"Scardino1\"/> Scardino, who had not filmed in Las Vegas since helming an episode of ''[[Tracey Takes On...]]'' approximately fifteen years earlier, described shooting on location in the city as \"an absolute must\". Scardino added \"We just felt that, to give the movie authenticity, it had to be on the Strip\".<ref name=\"Scardino1\"/> Carell was filmed on the Strip because Scardino believed his character is \"a creature of the Strip,\" while Carrey was filmed \"in and around Fremont Street,\" where his character felt more at home. Scardino explained the decision to film the characters in these environments, saying the \"two different worlds\" of Vegas \"helps define our talent,\" with the \"ever-changing Strip\" providing contrast with \"the frozen-in-time aspect of Fremont Street.\"<ref name=\"Scardino1\"/>\n\nBy January 16, 2012, filming moved to Los Angeles<ref name=\"FilminginLa2\"/> and southern California,<ref name=\"Scardino1\"/><ref name=\"FilminginLa1\"/> including the [[Wadsworth Theatre]].<ref name=\"2012DecUpdate\"/> Filming had concluded by March 13, 2012,<ref name=\"FilmingEnd1\"/> after forty-nine days.<ref name=\"MiscLAT\"/> When Scardino boarded the project, the script contained several magic tricks that could not realistically occur on stage such as lasers decapitating two individuals and the heads then switching bodies, which would have required the use of computer visual effects to accomplish. Scardino insisted that most of the magic tricks should be credible feats to make the magicians seem more believable, but some tricks still required the use of visual effects. [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] served as a technical advisor on the film and developed a live stage illusion for the film's climax, featuring a body switch between Carell's and Buscemi's characters.<ref name=\"Scardino1\"/><ref name=\"IntScardino\"/><ref name=\"MiscLAT\"/> Scardino insisted that the illusion should not depend on camera tricks, stating \"I wanted one big stage illusion where you go, 'Oh, wow, how'd they do that?'\" Copperfield provided instructions on how the trick worked and was present on set during its filming.<ref name=\"MiscLAT\"/> The production also used other magic advisors who ensured that hand movements during tricks were correct, and also served as hand-doubles.<ref name=\"IntScardino\"/> Producer Chris Bender said that the film is meant to be set in a fictional history of the world of magic, and so the filmmakers avoided casting many real magicians, so that it would not seem that the film was intended to be set in reality.<ref name=\"CastHerbig2\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''The Incredible Burt Wonderstone'' premiered as the opening film of the [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] festival on March 8, 2013; it was introduced by Carell, Carrey and Wilde.<ref name=\"Release1\"/><ref name=\"Release2\"/> The film received a wide release in North America and the United Kingdom on March 15, 2013.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\"/><ref name=\"Total FilmFeb2013\"/>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film earned $22.5 million in North America and $4.9 million elsewhere for a worldwide total of $27.4 million, against a budget of $30 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref name=\"BOM1\"/>\n\nIn the week prior to its release in North America, the film was predicted to earn approximately $18 million and finish as the number 2 film of the weekend behind ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]''.<ref name=\"BOOpeningPre\"/> ''The Incredible Burt Wonderstone'' earned $3.72 million through its opening day including takings from midnight showings at 1,800 theaters.<ref name=\"BOOpening2\"/> During its opening weekend the film earned $10.2 million from 3,160 theaters\u2014an average of $3,221 per theater\u2014ranking third for the weekend behind new release ''[[The Call (2013 film)|The Call]]'' ($17.1 million) and holdover ''Oz the Great and Powerful'' ($41.3 million).

Reviewers considered the tone uneven, segueing between dark comedy and family film, the extreme stunts of Carrey's Steve Gray, and sentimentality, and serious drama and farcical comedy.<ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/><ref name=\"RevLATimes\"/> Several reviewers noted that the plot was predictable,<ref name=\"RevTotalFilm\"/><ref name=\"RevEW\"/> and dated.<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> ''[[Total Film]]''{{'}}s Matthew Leyland said that the attention to detail in terms of magician gestures, posture and dialog created a \"withering showbiz satire\", which is sidelined in favor of sentimentality.<ref name=\"RevTotalFilm\"/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Owen Gleiberman said that the film is too cautious and unimaginative, choosing \"earnest and mushy\" over increasingly wild surprise,<ref name=\"RevEW\"/> and ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s Helen O'Hara considered the script unfocused and the tone uneven, which undermined Carell's efforts to portray Wonderstone's return to glory,<ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/> and ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} Stephen Holden said that the film's message was unoriginal and delivered without any special conviction.<ref name=\"RevNYT\"/> In contrast, [[Richard Roeper]] said that ''The Incredible Burt Wonderstone'' is \"dark and wickedly funny\",<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Joe Leydon said that it neatly balanced sentimentality with edgy comedy.<ref name=\"RevVariety\"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s Mary Pols said that while the film does not always work, it did so enough that she thought it could be \"the kind of semi-bad, semi-inspired comedy that could not only stand repeated viewings but perhaps improve with them.\"<ref name=\"RevTime\"/>\n\nCarrey's performance was generally praised for his humor and return to the physical style of comedy employed early in his career.<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/><ref name=\"RevNYT\"/><ref name=\"RevVariety\"/><ref name=\"RevVillage\"/> Roeper said that Carrey is \"physical, he's intense, he's ridiculous\u2014and he made me laugh more than any comedic character in recent memory\",<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> and Alan Scherstuhl said that Carrey's \"cartoon expressiveness\" was used to its most judicious ends in years.<ref name=\"RevVillage\"/> Gleiberman said Carrey was one of the funniest components of the film,<ref name=\"RevEW\"/> and Holden said that Carrey steals every scene he is in with a \"take-no-prisoners ferocity that he hasn\u2019t demonstrated in years\".<ref name=\"RevNYT\"/> ''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'}}s Ty Burr however said that Carrey is good at being loud, but not funny.<ref name=\"RevBoston\"/> Arkin was also praised, with ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s Michael Phillips saying that he \"can't save the movie, but he can save his scenes.\"<ref name=\"RevChicago\"/> Roeper labeled him a marvel,<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/> and Leydon called his performance scene-stealing.<ref name=\"RevVariety\"/> Leyland said that Carell's likability helped carry the sentimental segments,<ref name=\"RevTotalFilm\"/> but Holden considered that his performance gave Wonderstone a soulfulness that undermined the film's farcical aspirations and left the character lacking \"a shark's bite\".<ref name=\"RevNYT\"/> Leydon said that Buscemi offered an engaging performance as the amiable Anton Marvelton, and Wilde was generally considered to have delivered a fine performance in an underwritten role.<ref name=\"RevEbert\"/><ref name=\"RevNYT\"/><ref name=\"RevVariety\"/><ref name=\"RevVillage\"/> Pols said that the prospect of Wonderstone attracting Wilde's wholesome and intelligent Jane were absurd, but that Wilde's portrayal was game enough to remove the creepiness.<ref name=\"RevTime\"/>\n\nPhillips and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}}s Kenneth Turan criticized Scardino's direction, saying that the film offers slow and crude scenes over the fleet-footed material directed by Scardino on ''30 Rock''.<ref name=\"RevLATimes\"/><ref name=\"RevChicago\"/> Leydon conversely said that the director unobtrusively handled the gradual shifts in tone between black comedy and buddy comedy.<ref name=\"RevVariety\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n''The Incredible Burt Wonderstone'' received three nominations for the [[2013 Teen Choice Awards]]: [[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie
