It is the first feature-length film in the ''[[VeggieTales]]'' series. The themes for the film are [[compassion]] and [[mercy]], using two stories as illustrations linked by the [[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie|Pirates Who Don't Do Anything]], who were first seen in the [[Silly Songs with Larry|Silly Song]] of the same name in ''[[Very Silly Songs!]]''. The first story takes place in the current day and concerns a mishap with [[List of VeggieTales characters#Bob the Tomato|Bob the Tomato]] and [[List of VeggieTales characters#Mike and Lisa Asparagus|Dad Asparagus]] on the way to a concert; the second, set in ancient times, is based directly on the [[Bible|biblical]] story of [[Jonah]]. Through both stories, compassion and mercy play a role in giving people a second chance.\n\n''Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie'' premiered on August 14, 2002, at a Hollywood movie theater{{which|date=March 2019}} and came out as a regular release two months later on October 4, 2002. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the humor and narrative style. The film grossed $25.6 million against a $14 million production budget, making it the highest-grossing film released by Big Idea Productions.\n\nThe film came out on VHS and DVD on March 4, 2003, as a worldwide home video release in both full-screen and [[anamorphic widescreen]] formats with a two-disc collector's edition.<ref name=\"RT\">{{cite web|title=Jonah - A VeggieTales Movie (2002)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jonah_a_veggietales_movie|access-date=April 25, 2019|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]}}</ref> A DVD reprint with the feature and bonus features was released on Blu-ray in 2011 by Lionsgate (Artisan's successor).\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Note: per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be limited to 400-700 words.-->\n\n[[List of VeggieTales characters#Bob the Tomato|Bob the Tomato]] and [[List of VeggieTales characters#Mike and Lisa Asparagus|Dad Asparagus]] are driving Veggie children to see the popular singer \"Twippo\" in concert. During the drive, [[List of VeggieTales characters#Laura Carrot|Laura]] taunts the other children because she won a backstage pass, which particularly annoys [[List of VeggieTales characters#Junior Asparagus|Junior]]. Bob briefly loses control of the van after being hit in the back of the head by a guitar, and Laura loses her pass in the chaos. To make matters worse, soon afterwards a porcupine shoots out two of the van's tires, and the van veers off the road and careens down a hill, stopping short of a river.\n\nAt a nearby restaurant, Bob blames Dad Asparagus for the crash and Junior tells Laura losing her pass was her own fault. Junior is met by The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, who tell Junior he was being rather tough on his friend and encourage him to show some compassion. To illustrate their point, they tell all the Veggies a story about a man of God named [[Jonah]].\n\nJonah is a Prophet of ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] who goes from town to town delivering God's messages. One night, God asks him to deliver a message to the people of [[Nineveh]]; however, Jonah is unwilling to preach a word of repentance to the Ninevites since they are people of corruption and instead tries to flee from the Lord by having The Pirates sail him to [[Tarshish]]. After leaving port, a guilt-stricken Jonah goes below deck to rest where he meets [[List of VeggieTales characters#Khalil|Khalil]].\n\nAfter experiencing a nightmare, Jonah awakens to find the ship beset by a great storm. Captain Pa Grape concludes the storm has been sent because God is angry at someone on the ship. The group decides to play [[Go Fish]] to [[Cleromancy|divine]] who is at fault. Jonah loses the game and is forced to [[walk the plank]] and as soon as Jonah is off the ship, the skies clear. The Pirates attempt to reel Jonah back in, but before they can do so, Jonah is swallowed by a giant whale. The pirates attack the whale using a cannon with a bowling ball as ammo. The whale swallows the ball, disgorges Jonah's lifebelt, and swims away.\n\nInside the belly of the whale, Khalil finds Jonah, who realizes that he disobeyed God in trying to run from Him and is certain that his death is near. The pair are soon visited by a host of God's angels, who explain if Jonah repents, God will grant him a second chance. Jonah gladly repents, and after spending three days and nights in the belly of the whale, he and Khalil are spat up onto the shore, where they ride Reginald to Nineveh.\n\nAfter Jonah is denied entrance to the city, the Pirates appear, explaining they won the Mr. Twisty's Twisted Cheese Curls sweepstakes which grants them free access to Nineveh where they are produced. The group is soon arrested after [[List of VeggieTales characters#Larry the Cucumber|Larry]] accidentally steals several bags of Cheese Curls thinking they were free samples, and they are sentenced to death. As a last request, they are granted an audience with King Twistomer. Jonah then delivers the message given to him by God and tells the Ninevites that they should immediately repent of their sins or Nineveh will be destroyed; King Twistomer and the Ninevites listen to Jonah's message and repent.\n\nStill expecting God to destroy Nineveh for their past sins, Jonah watches and waits from a distance in the hot sun. God provides a plant to shade Jonah, only for Khalil to eat a single leaf off the plant, which kills it. Jonah laments the dead plant, and Khalil is disappointed Jonah shows compassion for a plant, but not the Ninevites. Khalil then tries to explain God is compassionate and merciful and that he wants to give everyone, both Israelites and non-Israelites, a second chance. Jonah refuses to accept this and states it would be better if he was dead. The story ends with Khalil and Reginald leaving Jonah to his sulking.\n\nBack in the present day, the Veggies are disappointed in the anti-climactic ending, but come to understand the point of the story: God wants everybody to show compassion and mercy, even to those that do not seem to deserve it. Twippo then appears in the restaurant unexpectedly and offers to give everybody a lift to the concert, while Bob forgives Dad Asparagus and Junior gives his Twippo ticket to Laura. The film ends with a song and the arrival of a tow truck driver, who is none other than Khalil.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Phil Vischer]] as [[List of VeggieTales characters|Bob the Tomato]] / [[List of VeggieTales characters|Archibald Asparagus]] (as Jonah and Twippo) / [[List of VeggieTales characters|Mr. Lunt]] / [[List of VeggieTales characters|Pa Grape]] / [[List of VeggieTales characters|Mr. Nezzer]] / [[List of VeggieTales characters|Apollo Gourd]] (as King Twistomer) / [[List of VeggieTales characters|Jimmy Gourd]] / [[List of VeggieTales characters|Phillipe Pea]]\n*[[Mike Nawrocki]] as [[List of VeggieTales characters|Larry the Cucumber]] / [[List of VeggieTales characters|Jerry Gourd]] / [[List of VeggieTales characters|Jean Claude Pea]] / [[List of VeggieTales characters|Percy Pea]]\n*[[Tim Hodge]] as [[List of VeggieTales characters|Khalil]]\n*Lisa Vischer as [[List of VeggieTales characters|Junior Asparagus]]\n*[[Dan Anderson (voice actor)|Dan Anderson]] as [[List of VeggieTales characters|Mike Asparagus]]\n*Kristin Blegen as [[List of VeggieTales characters|Laura Carrot]]\n*Shelby Vischer as [[List of VeggieTales characters|Annie Onion]]\n*Jim Poole as [[List of VeggieTales characters|Scooter]] (as Angus, the ticket seller)\n\n==Production==\nIn 1999, Phil Vischer proposed a film adaptation of ''[[VeggieTales]]'' based on the story of Jonah.
