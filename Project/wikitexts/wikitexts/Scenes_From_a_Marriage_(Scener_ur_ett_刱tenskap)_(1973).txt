Over the course of six hour-long episodes, it explores the disintegration of the marriage between Marianne ([[Liv Ullmann]]), a divorce lawyer, and Johan ([[Erland Josephson]]), a psychology professor. The series spans a period of 10 years. Bergman's teleplay draws on his own experiences, including his relationship with Ullmann. It was shot on a small budget in [[Stockholm]] and [[F\u00e5r\u00f6]] in 1972.\n\nAfter initially airing on Swedish TV in six parts, the miniseries was condensed into a theatrical version and received positive reviews in Sweden and internationally. ''Scenes from a Marriage'' was also the subject of controversy for its perceived influence on rising divorce rates in Europe. The film was ineligible for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], but won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and several other honours. The miniseries and film version influenced filmmakers such as [[Woody Allen]] and [[Richard Linklater]]. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Saraband]]'', in 2003, and stage adaptations. It was also adapted into an [[Scenes from a Marriage (American miniseries)|HBO miniseries]] in 2021.\n\n==Episodes==\nThe TV miniseries' six episodes ran between 11 April and 16 May 1973. At about 50 minutes per episode, the miniseries totals 282 minutes.{{sfn|Vermilye|2002|p=142}}\n\nScenes from each episode appear in the film version, which is 168 minutes long.{{sfn|Vermilye|2002|p=142}} The episode titles appear in the film version as chapter titles.<ref name=\"Canby\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173BE770BC4E52DFBF66838F669EDE |title=Scenes from a Marriage |last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=16 September 1974 |access-date=2 October 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003194932/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173BE770BC4E52DFBF66838F669EDE |archive-date=3 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|- style=\"color:#ffffff\"\n! style=\"background:#000000; width:5%\" | #\n! style=\"background:#000000\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#000000; width:10%\" | Original airdate{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=530}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title=Innocence and Panic (''Oskuld och panik'')\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1973|4|11|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary= An affluent couple, Marianne and Johan, are interviewed for a magazine series on love after having renewed their marriage contract after their 10th anniversary.
