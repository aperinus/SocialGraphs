At work, Caleb underscores the importance of never leaving one's partner behind, but at home, he and Catherine argue constantly. Catherine accuses Caleb of being selfish because he prioritizes his desire for a $24,000 boat over paying for medical equipment and bills for Catherine's ailing mother. She is also frustrated about his habitual use of [[internet pornography]]. Caleb feels unappreciated and undervalued. Their constant arguing escalates to the point that Catherine demands a divorce, to which an enraged Caleb agrees.\n\nCaleb's best friend and fellow [[firefighter]], Michael ([[Ken Bevel]]), and Caleb's father, John (Harris Malcom), convince him to hold off on divorce proceedings. His father persuades him to try the [[Love Dare]], a 40-day challenge for marriage improvement wherein a spouse alters the way they treat their partner. Caleb reluctantly agrees, though he decides not to tell Catherine. At the hospital where she works, Catherine has been openly flirting with Dr. Gavin Keller (Perry Revell).\n\nCaleb begins The Love Dare halfheartedly, viewing the tasks as more of a checklist than outreach. Meanwhile, [[Nursing|nurses]] at Catherine's hospital warn her not to trust Caleb, as they believe he is trying to butter her up to secure a more favorable divorce settlement. With encouragement from his father and Michael, Caleb continues, though Catherine eschews his affections and grows closer to Dr. Keller. Finding Catherine unmoved, Caleb is consoled by his father, while Michael reveals that he has been divorced. Caleb sustains burns on the job, is admitted to the hospital where his wife works, and is treated by Dr. Keller. During treatment, Dr. Keller discovers that Catherine is married and Caleb is her spouse. Caleb continues The Love Dare with a renewed faith, even destroying their home computer to distance himself from any pornographic addictions and temptations.  However, Catherine gives him an envelope with a petition for divorce, leaving Caleb heartbroken.\n\nCatherine discovers that her mother's medical equipment costs have been paid anonymously and erroneously believes it was Dr. Keller, bringing them even closer. Caleb eventually discovers the burgeoning affair and discreetly confronts the doctor. After Caleb leaves, Dr. Keller produces a wedding band, revealing that he is also married, and terminates his pursuit of Catherine.\n\nCatherine confronts Caleb after discovering his Love Dare journal, and he reveals to her that he has completed the challenge but is still following its guidelines. Despite Caleb's heartfelt apology, Catherine says she still needs time to reconsider the divorce. She later discovers that Caleb used his savings to pay for almost all of her mother's medical equipment, with Dr. Keller only contributing $300. Moved by Caleb's selflessness, Catherine reconciles with him. Caleb discovers that his mother, whom he has treated poorly, completed The Love Dare for his father, rather than vice versa as Caleb had originally thought. The film ends with Caleb and Catherine renewing their wedding vows.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kirk Cameron]] as Caleb Holt, captain of the Albany Fire Department's Station One\n* [[Erin Bethea]] as Catherine Holt, Caleb's wife, who works as a public relations director for [[Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital]]\n** [[Chelsea Noble]] (''uncredited'') as Catherine Holt's [[body double]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/sep/26/wisdom/ |title=Devotion keeps actor Kirk Cameron centered |work=Ventura County Star |first=Jeffrey |last=Dransfeldt |date=September 26, 2008 |access-date=May 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123140416/http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/sep/26/wisdom/ |archive-date=January 23, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> who appeared in the scene where Caleb and Catherine reconcile, as Cameron will not kiss any woman but his wife.\n* [[Ken Bevel]] as Lt.
