It is based on [[Ann M. Martin]]'s [[The Baby-Sitters Club|novel series of the same name]] and is about one summer in the girls' lives in the fictional town of Stoneybrook, [[Connecticut]]. The film was shot in the California cities of Los Angeles, [[Altadena, California|Altadena]], and [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]].\n\nThe film was released on August 18, 1995. The film received mostly mixed to positive reviews, and grossed $9.6 million against a budget of $6.5 million.\n\n==Plot==\nKristy Thomas, president of \"The Baby-Sitters Club\", decides to open a day camp for their clients. Her best friend, Mary Anne Spier, along with Mary Anne's stepsister Dawn Schafer, offer their parents' backyard to serve as the campsite. All of the club members (Kristy Thomas, Mary Anne Spier, Dawn Schafer, Claudia Kishi, Stacey McGill, Mallory Pike, and Jessi Ramsey) vow to keep a close eye on the kids.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristy faces problems when she meets her estranged father (who abandoned her family seven years ago and started a new family in California), and faces a dilemma about telling her friends and family about this. Mary Anne is the only one she tells, and she too is under pressure as the curiosity of her friends grows.\n\nClaudia is forced to attend summer school because she failed science. Kristy promises to help Claudia study but, because she is seeing her father, she fails to keep her promise. Later on, the members of The Baby-Sitters Club, along with some of their clients, perform a rap song for Claudia who has to take a test; if she fails the test, she would have to repeat the eighth grade and drop out of the club.\n\nStacey has a crush on a 17-year-old boy named Luca. As their relationship ensues, she faces problems telling him about her [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], and later, her age. This is revealed after a trip to a New York City club, in which a bouncer does not allow her into a club because she is underage. Luca is outraged, unable to believe that Stacey is 13 years old.\n\nMeanwhile, Dawn must face her neighbor, Mrs. Haberman, who becomes increasingly upset because of the camp activities that are taking place next door.\n\nKristy's 13th birthday comes, and she has arranged to go to an amusement park with her father. Promising her friends she would make it to her own party, Kristy goes to meet her father, but he does not show up. She begins to walk home until her friends show up in Luca's car after Mary Anne tells them that Kristy's father came back.\n\nLuca drives the girls back to Mallory's parents' cabin and present Kristy with a half-melted birthday cake. As Stacey is saying goodbye to Luca, he tells her that he will be coming to Stoneybrook again next year. Delighted, Stacey tells him that she will be 14 years old when he returns. They share a kiss just before Luca departs.\n\nIn return for making Mrs. Haberman's summer miserable, the girls give the greenhouse to her. Meanwhile, Kristy witnesses a miracle when Jackie Rodowsky hits his first home run, hitting Cokie Mason, who is sitting in a tree nearby, in the process.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Schuyler Fisk]] as Kristy Thomas\n* [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Mary Anne Spier\n* [[Larisa Oleynik]] as Dawn Schafer\n* Tricia Joe as Claudia Kishi\n* [[Bre Blair]] as Stacey McGill\n* Stacey Linn Ramsower as Mallory Pike\n* [[Zelda Harris]] as Jessi Ramsey\n* [[Vanessa Zima]] as Rosie Wilder\n* [[Christian Oliver]] as Luca\n* [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] as Elizabeth Thomas-Brewer\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Watson Brewer\n* Jess Needham as Karen Brewer\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Mrs. Haberman\n* [[Peter Horton]] as Patrick Thomas\n* Asher Metchik as Jackie Rodowsky\n* [[Austin O'Brien]] as Logan Bruno\n* [[Marla Sokoloff]] as Cokie Mason\n* [[Aaron Michael Metchik]] as Alan Gray\n* [[Kyla Pratt]] as Becca Ramsey\n* [[Scarlett Pomers]] as Suzi Barrett\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Baby-Sitters Club'' was one of two nationwide theatrical releases on the weekend of August 18, 1995.
