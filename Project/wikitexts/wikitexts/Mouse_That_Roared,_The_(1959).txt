The film was directed by [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]], and the screenplay was written by [[Roger MacDougall]] and [[Stanley Mann]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe minuscule European [[Duchy]] of [[Grand Fenwick]] is bankrupted when an American company comes up with a cheaper imitation of Fenwick's sole export, its fabled Pinot Grand Fenwick wine. Crafty Prime Minister Count Mountjoy (Peter Sellers) devises a plan: Grand Fenwick will declare war on the United States, then surrender, taking advantage of American largesse toward its defeated enemies to rebuild the defeated nation's economy. Duchess Gloriana (also Sellers) is hesitant but agrees to the plan. Mild-mannered game warden Tully Bascomb (also Sellers) is charged as Field Marshal to lead the Grand Fenwick troops, aided by Sergeant Will Buckley ([[William Hartnell]]).\n\nThe contingent of 20 soldiers in medieval [[Chain mail|mail]] books passage across the Atlantic on a small merchant ship, arriving in [[New York Harbor]] during an air-raid drill that leaves the city deserted and undefended. They chance upon a [[United States civil defense|civil defence]] truck and are mistaken for invading [[Martian]]s, prompting an investigation by blustering but ineffectual General Snippet ([[MacDonald Parke]]). Puncturing the tyres of the general's jeep with their bows and arrows, the Grand Fenwick troops take him and four [[NYPD]] officers hostage. Still looking for a place to surrender, Tully and Will stumble across Dr. Alfred Kokintz ([[David Kossoff]]), whose invention of the Q Bomb \u2013 capable of destroying an entire continent \u2013 has prompted the defence drills. He has built a football-sized prototype of the unstable bomb, which Tully takes possession of. With Kokintz and his attractive daughter Helen ([[Jean Seberg]]) as additional hostages, Tully declares victory and returns with them to Grand Fenwick.\n\nThe duchess indulges Tully's victory, and the prime minister resigns in disgust at Tully's blunder, leaving him as acting prime minister. When the incident is discovered, the U.S. government is thwarted from retaking the weapon and hostages by force, fearing the dishonour of attacking such a small and defenceless nation. Instead, they send the [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] (Austin Willis) to discuss terms of surrender and get back the bomb. Meanwhile, Grand Fenwick receives competing offers of defensive aid from each of the world's powers, in exchange for the weapon.\n\nTully becomes smitten with Helen, who initially despises him for taking them but falls for his simple charm. Then Snippet and Mountjoy conspire to steal the bomb and return it (and Helen) to America, but Tully gives chase and retrieves it.  The Secretary of Defense and Tully agree to terms: the knock-off wine will be taken off the market, Grand Fenwick will receive monetary aid from the US, Helen and her father will remain in Grand Fenwick, and so will the bomb: held by \"the little countries of the world\" as a weapon of last resort if the superpowers refuse to disarm.\n\nChecking the bomb for damage, Tully, Helen, and Dr. Kokintz find it was \"a dud\" all along, and leave it in the dungeon, conspiring to keep its impotence secret. However, after they leave, a mouse emerges from it, and it appears to rearm, sitting ready to explode if disturbed.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Duchess Gloriana XII/Prime Minister Count Rupert Mountjoy/Tully Bascombe\n* [[Jean Seberg]] as Helen Kokintz\n* [[William Hartnell]] as Will Buckley\n* [[David Kossoff]] as Doctor Alfred Kokintz\n* [[Leo McKern]] as Benter\n* [[MacDonald Parke]] as General Snippet\n* [[Austin Willis]] as United States Secretary of Defense\n* [[Timothy Bateson]] as Roger\n* [[Monte Landis]] as Cobbley\n* [[Alan Gifford]] as Air Raid Warden\n* [[Colin Gordon]] as [[BBC]] Announcer\n* [[Harold Kasket]] as Pedro\n\n== Production ==\nStage rights to the book were bought in 1955 by [[Howard Dietz]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=DIRECTOR TO ACT IN 'SALUTE' SHOW|author=L.

The lead character of the book is the Duchess Gloriana XII, an attractive young royal in the manner of the young [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Grace Kelly|Princess Grace]] of [[Monaco]].\n\nIn the film version, however, Peter Sellers plays the role as a parody of an elderly [[Queen Victoria]] (who thinks the President of the United States is [[Calvin Coolidge]]), whilst his Mountjoy is a parody of [[Benjamin Disraeli]].\n\nThe [[Marseille]] and [[New York Harbor]] sequences were filmed in [[Southampton]]; the presence of the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} ocean liner there was a lucky coincidence. In addition, in the novel, an encounter with the [[New York Police Department]] leads to bloodshed that complicates peace negotiations; this does not appear in the film.\n\nAdditionally, in the film, both Tully and Helen are with Dr. Kokintz when he discovers the bomb is a dud, and it is Tully who suggests that they keep that fact a secret; in the book Dr. Kokintz discovers the fact alone and apparently keeps it to himself.\n\n===Casting===\nThe lead role went to [[Peter Sellers]]. The female lead went to [[Jean Seberg]], who was then under contract to Columbia.  At the time [[William Hartnell]] was well known for playing army sergeants, having played Sgt. Grimshaw in ''[[Carry on Sergeant]]'' in 1958 and Sgt. Maj. Percy Bullimore in the TV sitcom ''[[The Army Game]]''.\n\n===Shooting===\nTitle designer [[Maurice Binder]] added a mouse in an opening joke with the [[Columbia Pictures]] logo.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nOne scene has diplomats playing a board game called ''Diplomacy'', although the game more resembles ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' rather than the game ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]''.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film did not perform up to expectations in the UK earning [[theatrical rental]]s of $200,000<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=20 April 1960|page=47|title=Gag-Films Rule British Trade|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety218-1960\u201304#page/n200/mode/1up|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref><ref name=uk/> but was a surprise hit at the US box office with rentals of $2 million.<ref name=\"new\"/><ref name=us/> It was felt that the reluctance of the characters to join the army in a time of need was received less well in the UK than in the US.<ref name=uk/>\n\nThe ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said the film \"laid an egg\",<ref>{{Cite news|author=Warren, G.|date=Dec 26, 1959|title='Mouse that roared' also lays an egg|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |id={{ProQuest|167609871}}}}</ref> but [[Bosley Crowther]] at ''[[The New York Times]]'' offered a more positive review.<ref>{{cite news |last= Crowther |first= Bosley |author-link=Bosley Crowther|title='The Mouse That Roared' Wins War Against U.S. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/10/27/archives/the-mouse-that-roared-wins-war-against-us-guild-comedy-depicts.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which retrospectively collected a mix of contemporary and later reviews, the film has an approval rating of 90% based on reviews from 20 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Mouse That Roared (1959) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mouse_that_roared |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n=== Television pilot ===\nIn 1964, Jack Arnold obtained exclusive television rights for ''The Mouse That Roared'' from Leonard Wibberley.<ref>{{cite book|author=Reemes, Dana M. |title=Directed by Jack Arnold|publisher= McFarland|date= 1988|page=140}}</ref>  He produced and directed a colour [[television pilot]] with [[ABC Weekend TV|ABC Television]] and [[Screen Gems]] called ''The Mouse That Roared'',  starring [[Sid Caesar]] as the Duchess, Mountjoy, and Tully, and co-starring [[Joyce Jameson]], [[Sigrid Valdis]], and [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]].
