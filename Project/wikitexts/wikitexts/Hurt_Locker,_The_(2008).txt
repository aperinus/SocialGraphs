It stars [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Brian Geraghty]], [[Christian Camargo]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]], and [[Guy Pearce]]. The film follows an [[Iraq War]] [[Bomb disposal|Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] team who are targeted by insurgents and shows their psychological reactions to the stress of combat. Boal drew on his experience during [[embedded journalism|embedded access]] to write the screenplay.\n\n''The Hurt Locker'' premiered at the [[65th Venice International Film Festival|2008 Venice International Film Festival]] before it was released in the United States on June 26, 2009, by [[Summit Entertainment]]. The film earned acclaim from critics, who praised Bigelow's directing, Renner's performance, the writing, editing, and action sequences. The film was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]] and won six, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It was the first Best Picture winner to have been directed by a woman. The film grossed $49.2 million worldwide.\n\nIn 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web |last = Alter |first = Rebecca |title = Shrek Has Been Inducted Into the National Film Registry |website = Vulture |date = 2020-12-14 |url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/12/national-film-registry-2020-dark-knight-grease-and-shrek.html |access-date = 2020-12-14}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2004, [[Sergeant First Class]] William James arrives as the new team leader of a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Bomb disposal|Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD) unit in the [[Iraq War]]. He replaces [[Staff sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]] Matthew Thompson, who was killed by an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED) in [[Baghdad]]. His team includes Sergeant J. T. Sanborn and [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] Owen Eldridge.\n\nJames is often approached by an Iraqi youth nicknamed \"Beckham\", attempting to sell DVDs. James challenges him to a game of football and takes a liking to him.\n\nSanborn and Eldridge consider James's maverick disposal methods and attitude reckless, raising tensions. When they are assigned to destroy explosives, James returns to the detonation site to pick up his gloves. Sanborn openly contemplates killing him by \"accidentally\" triggering the explosives, making Eldridge uncomfortable. Nothing is done, and tensions continue to increase.\n\nReturning to [[Camp Victory]] in their [[Humvee]], the team encounters five armed men in traditional Arab garb and casual attire standing near a [[Ford Excursion]], which has a flat tire. James's team has a tense encounter with their leader, who reveals they are [[Private military company|private military contractors]] and British [[Mercenary|mercenaries]]. They have captured two prisoners featured on the [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]]. The group comes under fire; when the prisoners attempt to escape in the confusion, the leader of the mercenaries shoots them, as they are valuable dead or alive. Enemy snipers kill three of the mercenaries, including their leader. Sanborn and James borrow a gun to dispatch three attackers, while Eldridge kills a fourth.\n\nDuring a raid on a warehouse, James discovers a body he believes is Beckham, in which a bomb has been surgically implanted. During the evacuation, [[Lieutenant colonel|Lieutenant Colonel]] John Cambridge, the camp's [[psychiatrist]] and a friend of Eldridge, is killed in an explosion; Eldridge blames himself for his death. James breaks into an Iraqi professor's house, seeking revenge for Beckham, but his search reveals nothing.\n\nCalled to a petrol tanker detonation, James decides to hunt for the insurgents responsible, guessing they are still nearby. Sanborn protests, but when James begins a pursuit, he and Eldridge reluctantly follow. After they split up, insurgents capture Eldridge. James and Sanborn rescue him, but one of James' rounds hits Eldridge in the leg. The following morning, James is approached by Beckham, alive and well, whom James ignores and walks by silently.<!-- Please do not change. Script says it is indeed Beckham. See discussion page. --> Before being [[airlift]]ed for surgery, Eldridge angrily blames James for his injury.\n\nJames and Sanborn's unit is called to another mission in their last two days of their rotation. An innocent Iraqi civilian has had a bomb vest strapped to his chest. James tries to cut off the locks to remove the vest, but there are too many of them. He abandons the man who is then killed when the bomb explodes. Sanborn is distraught by the man's death. He confesses to James he can no longer cope with the pressure and wants to return home and have a son.\n\nAfter Bravo Company's rotation ends, James returns to his ex-wife Connie and their infant son, who still lives with him in his house. However, he is bored by routine civilian life at home. James confesses to his son there is only one thing he knows he loves. He starts another tour of duty, serving with Delta Company, a U.S. Army EOD unit on its 365-day rotation.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Sergeant First Class William James\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Sergeant J.

The screenplay was written by [[Mark Boal]], a freelance writer who was [[Embedded journalism|embedded]] as a journalist in 2004 with a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] EOD team in [[Iraq]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in Italy during 2008. After being shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], it was picked up for distribution in the United States by [[Summit Entertainment]]. In May 2009, it was the Closing Night selection for [[Maryland Film Festival]]. The film was released in the United States on June 26, 2009 but received a more widespread theatrical release on July 24, 2009.\n\nSince the film was not released in the United States until 2009, it was eligible for the [[Academy Awards]] [[82nd Academy Awards|only the following year]], where it was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]s.

In discussion, she found that her cast and crew shared stereotypes of the region from American culture. \"Sadly people in America and Los Angeles have these perceptions\", she said. \"But once you get off the plane you realize it's like Manhattan without the trees\", she continued. As Iraq dominated discourse in America and around the world, Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict, making Jordan the natural place to film.<ref name=\"Jordan Times\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=2564 |author=Luck, Taylor |title=Jordan poses as Iraq Cinecitt\u00e0 for Hollywood |work=Jordan Times |date=October 1, 2007 |access-date=July 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to producer Tony Mark, the blood, sweat and heat captured on-camera in the production was mirrored behind the scenes. <blockquote>\"It's a tough, tough movie about a tough, tough subject\", Mark said in an interview, \"There was a palpable tension throughout on the set.

Impressed with cinematographer [[Barry Ackroyd]]'s work on ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'' and ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]],'' Bigelow invited him to work on her film. While the film was independently produced and filmed on a low budget, Bigelow used four [[16&nbsp;mm film|Super 16&nbsp;mm cameras]] to capture multiple perspectives, saying, \n<blockquote>\"That's how we experience reality, by looking at the microcosm and the macrocosm simultaneously. The eye sees differently than the lens, but with multiple focal lengths and a muscular editorial style, the lens can give you that microcosm/macrocosm perspective and that contributes to the feeling of total immersion.\"<ref name=\"thomson45\">{{Harvnb|Thomson|2009|p=45}}</ref></blockquote> In staging the film's action sequences, Bigelow did not want to lose a sense of the geography and used multiple cameras to allow her to \"look at any particular set-piece from every possible perspective.\"<ref name=Dawson/>\n\n===Editing===\n''The Hurt Locker'' was edited by [[Chris Innis]] and [[Bob Murawski]].<ref name=\"Avid\">[http://www.avid.com/US/about-avid/customer-stories/Hurt-Locker \"Artful Editing and All-Avid Workflow Propel The Hurt Locker,\" Avid.com] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120320060023/http://www.avid.com/US/about-avid/customer-stories/Hurt-Locker?cmpid=AV-EM-SV710 |date = March 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"MPEG\">{{cite web |url = https://womenfilmeditors.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Innis_BETWEEN-IRAQ_Part-1-and-2.pdf |title = Between Iraq and a Hard Place}}</ref> The two editors worked with almost 200 hours of footage from the multiple hand-held cameras in use during the shoot.<ref name=\"MPEG\"/> Adding to the challenge, Boal's screenplay had a non-traditional, asymmetrical, episodic structure. There was no traditional \"villain\", and tension was derived from the characters' internal conflicts and the suspense from the explosives and snipers.<ref name=\"MPEG\"/> \n<blockquote>\"This movie is kind of like a horror film where you're unable to see the killer,\" says Innis. \"You know a bomb could go off at any minute, but you never know just when it's going to happen, so the ideas of [Alfred] Hitchcock\u2014about making your audience anxious\u2014were influential for us when we did the editing.\"<ref name=\"VarietyEditors\">[https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118013652?refCatId=3843 Karen Idelson, \"Editors Get in Rhythm\"], ''Variety'', 12 January 2010</ref></blockquote>The raw footage was described as a \"hodge-podge of disconnected, nausea-inducing motion that was constantly crossing [[180-degree rule|the 180-degree line]]\".<ref name=\"MPEG\"/>\n \nInnis spent the first eight weeks editing the film on location in Jordan, before returning to Los Angeles, where Murawski joined her. The process took over eight months to complete.<ref name=\"Avid\"/><ref name=\"Craft\">[http://incontention.com/2010/01/07/tech-support-the-crafts-of-the-hurt-locker/ Guy Lodge, \"The Crafts of 'The Hurt Locker'\"], ''In Contention'', January 7, 2010</ref> The goal was to edit a brutally realistic portrayal of the realities of war, using minimal special effects or technical enhancement.<ref name=\"Avid\"/><ref name=\"MPEG\"/> Innis stated that they \"really wanted the film to retain that 'newsreel' documentary quality... Too many stage-y effects would have been distracting. The editing in this film was all about restraint\".<ref name=\"Avid\"/>\n \nEditing on location led to additional complications in post-production. The production was unwilling to risk sending undeveloped film through high-security airports where the cans could be opened, X-rayed, or damaged. Accordingly, film was hand-carried on a flight by a production assistant from Amman to London.
