Statham plays Luke Wright, an ex-cop and former cage fighter who winds up protecting a gifted child who is being chased by the [[Russian mafia]], [[Chinese triad|Chinese Triads]], and corrupt [[New York City police]].\n\n''Safe'' was released by [[Lionsgate Films]] on April 27, 2012. The film grossed $40.6 million worldwide against a budget of $30 million with mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nEx-cop and [[cage fighter]] Luke Wright unintentionally wins a fixed fight, angering Emile Docheski, head of the [[Russian mafia]]. As punishment, Docheski's son Vassily and his men kill Wright's pregnant wife, then promise to kill anyone to whom he speaks regularly. Luke leaves his life behind, becoming a homeless tramp. Meanwhile, in [[China]], Mei, a young [[mathematical]] [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], is kidnapped by men working for [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] boss Han Jiao. Han wishes to use Mei as a [[mental calculator]] to eliminate his criminal enterprise's traceable [[digital footprint]]. He sends her to [[New York City]], in the care of brutal gangster Quan Chang.\n\nOne year later, Han arrives from China, asking Mei to memorize a long number. On the way to retrieve a second number, their vehicle is ambushed by the Russian mafia. Mei is taken to Emile, who demands the number, but Mei refuses. Before they can further interrogate her, they are interrupted by police, sent by the corrupt Captain Wolf, who works for Han. Mei escapes during the confusion, chased by the Russians to a nearby [[subway station]], where Luke contemplates suicide. Recognizing Chemyakin, one of the men who killed his wife, and seeing Mei's distress, Luke boards the train and kills Chemyakin and the other Russians. Mei flees at the next stop, only to be stopped by two corrupt detectives working for Wolf. Luke arrives and incapacitates the detectives, convincing Mei of his good intentions, before he also dispatches some Russians.\n\nHiding in a hotel, Mei explains the number to Luke, who guesses that it is the code to a combination safe. However, Quan tracks Mei down through her cell phone and escapes with her during a diversion, as Luke fights through Quan's men. Across town, Captain Wolf meets with Mayor Danny Tremello, who has learned that Luke is involved. He cautions Wolf, explaining that Luke wasn't a regular cop, but a black ops hitman for the government loaned as a favor to Tremello by friends in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] shortly after [[9/11]], along with his former partner Alex Rosen. Luke and Alex assassinated several crime bosses as an effort to impose order, and Luke quit after exposing Wolf's detective squad as dirty cops. Luke is living a life of exile as atonement for the things he did for the government.\n\nUsing Chemyakin's phone, Luke sets up Vassily, whom he kidnaps. Emile reluctantly accepts a deal for his son's life, explaining that Mei's number unlocks a heavily guarded safe in Chinatown with $30&nbsp;million, though he does not know the contents of a second safe. Needing a team to get to the safe, Luke recruits Wolf and his detectives. Together, they fight through numerous Triad gangsters to reach the safe. As Luke is about to open it, Wolf attempts to betray him, but Luke kills the remaining detectives and takes Wolf hostage. Using the money, Luke bribes Alex, now the mayor's aide and boyfriend, into rescuing Mei. Alex reveals the second safe belongs to the mayor, containing a disc with data on every crime syndicate in New York. Alex meets and kills Quan and his men as Mei watches. Elsewhere, Luke assaults the mayor and retrieves a copy of the mayor's disc.\n\nAlex and Luke arrange a meeting, but Luke refuses to surrender the money, instead suggesting that they settle it with a fight. Before they can begin, Mei shoots Alex, wounding him, and Luke finishes him off. In the aftermath, Luke gives Wolf $50,000 and instructs him to return Vassily to his father, unharmed. He sends the remainder of the money to Han to buy Mei's freedom, threatening to ruin Han's operations should Han try to recover Mei. Han leaves New York City in disgust, as Luke hides multiple copies of the disc throughout the city. Luke and Mei make plans to leave the city and head west, possibly to Seattle. When Mei asks if they are finally safe, Luke responds that they will take it one day at a time.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Statham]] as Luke Wright,<ref name=\"Allrovi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/safe-v539831|title=Safe Cast|work=[[Allrovi]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|access-date=September 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117134723/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/safe-v539831|archive-date=January 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> an ex-[[NYPD]] cop and [[Mixed Martial Artist|MMA fighter]] who has to protect a smart young Chinese child from the [[Russian Mafia]], the [[Chinese Mafia]] and his former corrupt police colleagues (It's revealed midway through the film by Mayor Tremello that he is actually a notorious government assassin and that he is part of a task force specializing in eliminating organized crime groups).\n* Catherine Chan as Mei,<ref name=\"Allrovi\"/> a young, highly intelligent Chinese prodigy girl from [[Nanjing, Jiangsu]], [[China]], whose intelligence becomes the subject of dispute between rival criminal groups and a group of [[New York City Police Department corruption and misconduct|corrupt New York police officers]]. \n* S\u00e1ndor T\u00e9csy as Emile Docheski, an infamous Russian mobster who is the powerful boss (''Pakhan'') of the [[Russian Mafia]] in [[New York City|New York]] and who, because of the information Mei holds, is currently in a war against Luke Wright, the Chinese Mafia and the NYPD.
