It is the eighth entry in the [[King Kong (franchise)|King Kong franchise]] and the second [[remake]] of the [[King Kong (1933 film)|1933 film of the same title]], following the [[King Kong (1976 film)|1976 film]]. The film stars [[Andy Serkis]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Jack Black]], and [[Adrien Brody]]. Set in 1933, it follows the story of an ambitious filmmaker who coerces his cast and hired ship crew to travel to mysterious [[Skull Island]]. There, they encounter prehistoric creatures and a legendary giant [[gorilla]] known as [[King Kong|Kong]], whom they capture and take to [[New York City]].\n\nDevelopment for the film began in early 1995, when Jackson was offered by [[Universal Pictures]] to direct the remake of the original 1933 film, but stalled the project in early 1997, as several ape and giant monster-related films were under production that time and Jackson planned to direct [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]]. As the first two films in the trilogy became commercially successful, Universal approached Jackson in early 2003, expressing his interest to restart development on the project, which he eventually agreed. Filming for ''King Kong'' took place in New Zealand from September 2004 to March 2005. It is currently one of the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive films ever produced]] as its budget climbed from an initial $150 million to a then-record-breaking $207 million.\n\n''King Kong'' was premiered at [[New York City]] on December 5, 2005,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2005-12-07 |title='King Kong' receives a giant-sized premiere |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-dec-07-et-kong7-story.html |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> and was theatrically released in [[Germany]] and [[United States]] on December 14. The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, and eventually appeared in several top ten lists for 2005; it received praise for the special effects, performances, sense of spectacle and comparison to the 1933 original, though some criticisms were focused on its 3-hour long run time. It was a commercial success, grossing over $562 million and became the fourth-highest-grossing film in Universal Pictures history at that time and the [[2005 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2005]].<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | title = ''King Kong''| publisher = BoxOfficeMojo.com| url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kingkong05.htm| access-date = 2006-10-12}}</ref> It also generated $100 million in DVD sales upon its home video release in March 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=''King Kong'' \u2013 DVD sales |publisher=BlogCritics.org |url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/04/04/122953.php |access-date=2007-03-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014181227/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/04/04/122953.php |archive-date=October 14, 2007}}</ref> It won three [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound Mixing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A [[King Kong (2005 video game)|tie-in video game]] was released alongside the film, which also became a commercial and critical success.\n\nA sequel to the film titled ''Skull Island'' was conceptualised in 2013, with Jackson producing the film and [[Adam Wingard]] set to direct. However, the project was abandoned after [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] acquired the rights and ultimately rebooted the franchise with the 2017 film ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' as a part of [[Legendary Entertainment|Legendary]]'s [[MonsterVerse]]. Wingard would later direct the 2021 film ''[[Godzilla vs. Kong]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davids |first=Brian |date=2021-03-30 |title=Why 'Godzilla vs. Kong' Director Adam Wingard Treated Kong Like an '80s Action Hero |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/why-godzilla-vs-kong-director-adam-wingard-treated-kong-like-an-80s-action-hero-4158496/ |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1933, during the [[Great Depression]], New York City actress Ann Darrow is hired by financially troubled filmmaker [[Carl Denham]] to star in a film with actor Bruce Baxter. Ann learns her favorite playwright, [[Jack Driscoll (character)|Jack Driscoll]], is the screenwriter. Filming takes place on the SS ''Venture'', under Captain Englehorn, and under Carl's pretense it will be sailing to [[Singapore]]. In truth, Carl intends to film the mysterious [[Skull Island]]. Captain Englehorn reconsiders the voyage, prompted by his crew's speculation of trouble ahead. During the voyage, Ann and Jack fall in love.\n\nThe ''Venture'' receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production, and instructing Englehorn to divert to [[Rangoon]], but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on Skull Island. Carl and his film crew, including cameraman Herb, assistant Preston, actor Bruce Baxter, and boom operator Mike, explore the island and are attacked by natives who kill Mike and a crewman. Englehorn rescues the film crew, but as they prepare to leave, a native sneaks onto the ship and abducts Ann. The natives offer Ann as a sacrifice to [[King Kong|Kong]], a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[gorilla]]. Jack notices Ann's disappearance, and the crew returns to the island, but Kong flees with Ann into the jungle. Carl catches a glimpse of Kong and becomes determined to film him.\n\nAnn wins Kong over with her juggling and dancing skills and begins to grasp his intelligence and capacity for emotion. Englehorn organizes a rescue party, led by his first mate Hayes and Jack, and accompanied by Carl, Herb, Baxter and Preston. The party gets caught between a herd of [[Apatosaurus]]-like ''[[Brontosaurus]] baxteri'' and a pack of [[Utahraptor]]-like ''Venatosaurus saevidicus'' hunting them, with Herb and several other men killed in the resulting stampede. Baxter and others return to the ship.\n\nThe remaining party members continue through the jungle when Kong attacks, making them fall into a ravine resulting in Hayes' death and Carl losing his camera. Kong rescues Ann from three [[Tyrannosaurus]]-like ''Vastatosaurus rex'', bringing her to his den in the mountains. The remaining rescue party are attacked by giant insects in the ravine, resulting in the death of three more crew members, but Preston, Carl, Jack, and Hayes' apprentice Jimmy are rescued by Baxter and Englehorn. Jack searches for Ann alone, while Carl decides to capture Kong. Jack finds Kong's lair and accidentally awakens him, but escapes with Ann. They arrive at the wall with Kong pursuing them. Kong kills several sailors, but is subdued when Carl knocks him out with chloroform.\n\nIn New York City that winter, Carl presents \"Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World\" on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], starring Baxter and an imprisoned Kong. Ann, who refused to take part in the performance, is played by an anonymous chorus girl. Agitated by the chorus girl not being Ann and flashes from cameras, Kong breaks free from the chains and wrecks the theater. Kong searches the city for Ann and chases Jack before encountering her again. The U.S. Army attacks, and Kong tries getting Ann and himself to safety by climbing to the top of the [[Empire State Building]].\n\nSix Navy planes arrive, which Kong fights. After downing three of them, Kong is mortally wounded from the planes' gunfire and falls. As Jack reaches the top of the building to comfort and embrace Ann, civilians, policemen, and soldiers gather around the beast's corpse in the street, one bystander commenting the airplanes got him. Carl makes his way through the crowd, takes one last look at Kong and says, \"It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[King Kong|Kong]] ([[motion capture]]), a {{convert|25|ft|adj=on}} [[prehistoric]] [[mountain gorilla]] who is around 100\u2013150 years old.<ref name=\"Konga\">{{cite web | author= Wloszczyna, Susan| date= June 26, 2005| title=''King Kong'' goes digital| work=USA Today| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-06-26-king-kong_x.htm | access-date=2006-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=King Kong- Building a Shrewder Ape| website=Urbancinefile.com| url=http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=11264&s=Features| access-date=March 20, 2021| archive-date=June 29, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629194803/http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=11264&s=Features| url-status=dead}}</ref> He is the last of his species, ''[[Megaprimatus kong]]''.<ref name=\"The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island\">{{cite book|title=The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtdI-BuTEhgC&pg=PP1|access-date=16 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=978-1-4165-0519-8}}</ref> and the possible descendant of the [[Chororapithecus]].\n** Serkis also plays Lumpy, the ship's cook, barber, and surgeon.

Jackson turned down ''Planet of the Apes'' and because Weinstein was taking longer than expected to buy ''The Lord of the Rings'' rights, Jackson decided to move forward on ''King Kong''. Weinstein was furious, and, as a result, Jackson proposed a deal between Universal and Miramax that the two studios would equally finance ''King Kong'' with Jackson's production company Wingnut Films. Universal would receive distribution rights in the United States, while Miramax would cover foreign territories. Jackson was also warranted the right of [[final cut privilege]], a percentage of the gross profits,<ref name=beg/> as well as [[artistic control]]; Universal allowed all filming and visual effects to be handled entirely in New Zealand.<ref name=Morton/> The deal was settled in April 1996, and Jackson, along with wife [[Fran Walsh]], began working on the ''King Kong'' script.<ref name=beg/> In the original draft, Ann was the daughter of famed English archaeologist Lord Linwood Darrow exploring ancient ruins in [[Sumatra]]. They would come into conflict with Denham during his filming, and they would uncover a hidden Kong statue and the map of Skull Island. This would indicate that the island natives were the last remnants of a cult religion that had once thrived on Asia's mainland. Instead of a playwright, Jack was the first mate and an ex-[[World War I]] fighter pilot still struggling with the loss of his best friend, who had been killed in battle during a World War I prologue. The camera-man Herb is the only supporting character in the original draft who made it to the final version. The fight between Kong and the three ''V. rex'' also changed from the original draft. In the draft, Ann is actually caught in the ''V. rex''{{'s}} jaws, where she becomes wedged, and slashed by the teeth; after the fight, Kong gets her out but she is suffering from a fever, from which she then recovers.<ref name=Morton/>\n\nUniversal approved of the script with [[Robert Zemeckis]] as executive producer, and pre-production for ''King Kong'' commenced. The plan was to begin filming sometime in 1997 for a summer 1998 release date.

However, she died shortly after her meeting with Jackson.<ref name=\"Black\"/> As in the original film, the line ultimately went to the character of Carl Denham.\n* An ad for Universal is visible while Kong is tearing up [[Times Square]]. In the 1933 film, an ad for [[Columbia Pictures]] appeared in the same spot, and the production designers replicated it, but Columbia asked for a large amount of money for its use, so effects artists replaced it.<ref name=\"References\"/>\n* When Denham is considering who to play the part before meeting Ann, he suggests \"Fay\", but his assistant Preston replies, \"She's doing a [[King Kong (1933 film)|picture]] with [[RKO Pictures|RKO]].\" Music from the 1933 film is heard, and Denham mutters, \"Cooper, huh? I might have known.\" Fay Wray starred in the 1933 film, which was directed by [[Merian C. Cooper]] and released by RKO.<ref name=\"References\"/> At the time she was performing in another Cooper/Schoedsack production, ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' with [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]].\n* In the 1933 film, Cooper made up an \"Arabian proverb\" about \"beauty and beast\". The 2005 remake repeats the fake proverb.<ref name=\"References\"/>\n* Early in this film, Denham shoots a scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's never been on a ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance. The dialogue they exchange is taken verbatim from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film. Ironically, in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of such words toward Ann.<ref name=\"References\"/>\n* Kong's New York stage appearance looks very much like a re-enactment of the 1933 film's sacrifice scene, including the posts the 'beauty' is tied to and the nearly identical performance, costumes, and [[blackface]] makeup of the dancers. In addition, the music played by the orchestra during that scene is [[Max Steiner]]'s original score for the 1933 film.<ref name=\"References\"/>\n* The battle between Kong and the final ''V. rex'' is almost move-for-move like the last half of the fight between Kong and the ''T. rex'' in the 1933 film, right down to Kong playing with the dinosaur's broken jaw and then standing, beating his chest and roaring victoriously.<ref name=\"References\"/>\n* After the crew captures Kong on the beach, Denham speaks a line from the 1933 film: \"''The whole world will pay to see this! We're millionaires, boys! I'll share it with all of you. In a few months, his name will be up in lights on Broadway! KONG, THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD!''\"<ref name=\"References\"/>\n\n==Home media==\n''King Kong'' was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on March 28, 2006 in the United States and Canada.

However, the King Kong rights had already been transferred to Warner Bros. by 2013, which complicated a sequel to a Universal-produced movie.<ref name=Slahfilm/> Wingard says that Jackson was thinking of setting the proposed movie during World War I, which would make it a prequel, but that the studio was uninterested in a World War I era film.<ref name=DG>{{cite web |url= https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/godzilla-vs-kong-director-almost-made-peter-jackson-king-kong-sequel/ |title= Godzilla vs. Kong Director Almost Made a Sequel to Peter Jackson's King Kong |author= Don Kaye |year=2021 |website= Den Of Geek}}</ref> Wingard pivoted to offering a modern day sequel, but ultimately nothing came of the proposal.<ref name=DG/>\n\nUltimately, [[Warner Bros.]] rebooted the franchise with ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' in 2017, which was part of the [[MonsterVerse]].<ref>{{cite news |title=King Kong and Batman Lift Time Warner Above Expectations |url=http://fortune.com/2017/05/03/time-warner-king-kong-lego-batman/ |access-date=May 4, 2017 |work=Fortune |date=May 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Seesawing Fate of Legendary Reflects the Film Industry's Volatility |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/business/media/seesawing-fate-of-legendary-reflects-the-film-industrys-volatility.html |work=The New York Times |first=Brooks |last=Barnes |date=July 25, 2017 |access-date=February 10, 2019}}</ref> Wingard would later direct 2021's ''[[Godzilla vs. Kong]]'', another film set in the MonsterVerse.\n\n==Theme park==\n{{main article|Skull Island: Reign of Kong}}\nThe [[Universal Orlando]] Resort location [[Islands of Adventure]] features an attraction called \"[[Skull Island: Reign of Kong]]\" which is based on Peter Jackson's remake.
