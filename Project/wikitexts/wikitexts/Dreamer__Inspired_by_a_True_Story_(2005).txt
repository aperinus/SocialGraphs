The film stars [[Kurt Russell]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Elisabeth Shue]] and [[Dakota Fanning]]. It is inspired by the true story of an injured [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] named [[Mariah's Storm]]. The film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 10, 2005 and was theatrically released on October 21, 2005 by [[DreamWorks Pictures]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics,<ref name=\"metacritic\" /> and earned $39.5 million on a $32 million budget. It also received a [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics' Choice Award]] nomination for Best Family Film.\n\n==Plot==\n\nBen Crane, a horse trainer who takes his work very seriously, neglects his precocious daughter while he pours his heart into the care of the horses that he trains.\n\nDetermined to make good on her father's overdue promise, Cale prods him to take her along to work and succeeds. One morning,  So\u00f1ador, the horse that is to enter the race that day, refuses to leave her stall. Ben mentions that one of her legs feels warm but his boss, Palmer, tells him to get So\u00f1ador on the track. During the race, the horse falls and injures herself so badly that Palmer demands the horse be put down. Having Cale along and not wanting her to see something like this, Ben instead strikes a bargain with Palmer and becomes the owner of the wounded horse but ends up losing his job as a result. With no job and facing foreclosure on his property, he decides to breed So\u00f1ador (who is nicknamed Sonya). Sonya gets a cast on her injured leg and slowly begins to recover.\n\nCale, having fallen in [[love at first sight]] with So\u00f1ador, begins to sneak out to the barn at night to see her. She also sneaks over to see her grandfather, 'Pop', Ben's dad, who loves teaching his granddaughter about horses.\n\nThey go to another farm to pick out a stallion to breed with So\u00f1ador, but the stud fee is too high. Ben's father gives Ben some money to use to breed, and Ben reluctantly takes it. But before they can breed, the vet tests So\u00f1ador and finds out she is [[Infertility|unable to have a foal]].\n\nAfter, Cale hears her father tell her mother, Lilly, that So\u00f1ador has ruined them because she cannot have a foal. Lilly responds that So\u00f1ador is the best thing that has ever happened to them, alluding to the fact that Ben is finally spending much-needed time with Cale. Frustrated, Ben says that if Cale wasn't there the day when So\u00f1ador was hurt, he would have let her be put down.\n\nHurt after hearing the conversation, Cale sets out to run away from home and saddles So\u00f1ador. Not knowing of Cale's plan, Ben enters the barn. The door slams behind him, and a startled So\u00f1ador bolts out of the barn with Cale hanging on for dear life. Ben scrambles to his truck and sets out after them. He catches up and manages to get Cale to safety but also notices how fast Sonya is, despite her previous injury.\n\nThis incident begins to cement the newly forming bond between father and daughter. They realize that So\u00f1ador is very fast and decide to race her. Unfortunately, after the race she is claimed, and Cale is angry at her father for entering the horse in a [[claiming race]].\n\nAt a parent-teacher night at school, Ben reads a story that Cale wrote about a king and his horse, and he realizes how much their family needs So\u00f1ador. He buys her back with money from his father. Cale decides to race So\u00f1ador in the [[Breeders' Cup Classic|Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic]], with Manny, Ben's colleague, as the [[jockey]]. They start training together and manage to get a wealthy sponsor.\n\nOn the day of the race, Ben notices Sonya's leg is warm and contemplates not racing her, scared that she may get injured again. This time however, Sonya refuses to go back in the stall. Manny and Sonya enter the race and eventually win.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Benjamin \"Ben\" Crane\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as Cale Crane\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as Pop Crane\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Lillian \"Lilly\" Crane\n* [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] as Everett Palmer\n* [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodr\u00edguez]] as Manolin Vallarta\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Balon\n* [[Oded Fehr]] as Prince Sadir\n* [[Ken Howard]] as William \"Bill\" Ford\n* Holmes Osborne as Doc Fleming\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2022}}\nThe movie is loosely inspired by the story of the mare [[Mariah's Storm]].<ref name=\"Leydon\" /> She was a promising filly who was being pointed towards the [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies]] in 1993 but then broke her cannon bone (the incident is mentioned in the film by So\u00f1ador's [[veterinarian]]). She recovered and later won some [[graded stakes race]]s. She started in the 1995 [[Breeders' Cup Distaff]] and finished ninth. She was owned by Thunderhead Farms and trained by the father and son team of Don Von Hemel and [[Donnie K. Von Hemel]]. She is now known mostly for being the dam of [[Giant's Causeway (horse)|Giant's Causeway]]. In the movie, when Cale and Ben go to [[Coolmore Stud#Coolmore America (Ashford Stud)|Ashford Stud]] to check out the studs, the stallions they are naming, such as [[Fusaichi Pegasus]], Giant's Causeway, Mariah's Storm, [[Johannesburg (horse)|Johannesburg]]  and [[Grand Slam (horse)|Grand Slam]], are real horses who actually stand at Ashford. However, the actual stallions were not used in filming. Stand-ins were placed in their stalls instead. In the scene where So\u00f1ador is considered for the Breeder's Cup, Prince Sadir says that his horse \"Rapid Cat is sired by [[Storm Cat]], the best sire in the world.\" Coincidentally, Mariah's Storm (on whom So\u00f1ador is based) was bred to Storm Cat.\n\nWhile doing research in Kentucky, the director/writer came upon a vet who told him about a racehorse who miraculously made a comeback after a serious injury, and he loosely based the script on this story. Before being picked up by DreamWorks, the script was presented to Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros, but both declined. Director John Gatins was told that if he could get Dakota Fanning in the lead role his movie would get a green-light. He went to see Fanning's agent and finally got the young actress to sign on. The role of Cale Crane was originally written for a boy, and the role was changed specifically so that Dakota Fanning could play it. The first script that was sent to Fanning actually had the word \"boy\" in the character description.\n\nTo produce the soundtrack, an advance showing of this film was shown to a number of recording artists, who were then asked to submit ideas for theme songs. [[Bethany Dillon]]'s song \"Dreamer\" was chosen out of all the submissions. After the movie, Kurt Russell bought Dakota Fanning a real [[Palomino horse]], whom she named Goldie.\n\n==Music==\n* \"Theme From Dreamer\"\n* \"The Stand Off: 1st Ride\"\n* \"First Race\"\n* \"Ben Asks Pop For Help\"\n* \"Sonador In Harness\"\n* \"Popsicles\"\n* \"Manny's Story\"\n* \"Testing Sonador's Leg\"\n* \"2nd Ride: Thunderpants\"\n* \"Runaway Horse\"\n* \"Exercising Sonador\"\n* \"The Noble King\"\n* \"New Owner Montage\"\n* \"Training Montage\"\n* \"Smart And Beautiful\"\n* \"Sonador Chosen\"\n* \"Cale Won't Sell Sonador\"\n* \"Leaving Sadir's\"\n* \"She's Ready To Run\"\n* \"She Wants To Race\"\n* \"Last Race\"\n* \"End Credit Medley\"\n* \"Dreamer\" (Film Mix) \u2013 [[Bethany Dillon]]\n* \"Main Title\" (Film Version)\n* \"Dreamer\" [Hidden Bonus Track] (Pop Mix)\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 10, 2005 and released theatrically on October 21, 2005 by [[DreamWorks Pictures]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Dreamer'' opened in second place at the box office behind ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'', with $9,178,233 earned for a $4,573 average from 2,007 theaters.
