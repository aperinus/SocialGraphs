It was one of the [[independent film]]s to be featured at the [[New York Film Festival]].\n\n== Plot==\nThe film tells the story of Vincent, a middle-aged man who is fired after having spent more than 11 years working for a prestigious consulting firm. Unable to admit to his family that he has been fired, the unemployed former executive continues to pretend he is going to the office every day. In reality, Vincent spends his time aimlessly driving the highways of France and Switzerland, reading newspapers, or sleeping in his car.\n\nAs time progresses, Vincent invents more and more elaborate lies, throwing himself into a vicious spiral of deceit. To sustain his [[bourgeois]] lifestyle, Vincent sets up a [[Ponzi scheme]] and is eventually enlisted into [[smuggling]] by career thief Jean-Michel. Murielle, Vincent's wife, after discovering her husband's \"life of lies\" attempts to bring him back into the realm of reality.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Aur\u00e9lien Recoing]] as Vincent\n* [[Karin Viard]] as Muriel\n* [[Serge Livrozet]] as Jean-Michel\n* [[Jean-Pierre Mangeot]] as Father\n* [[Monique Mangeot]] as Mother\n* [[Didier Perez]] as Philippe\n* [[Philippe Jouannet]] as Human Resources Director\n\n== Reception ==\n''Time Out'' received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an approval rating of 96%, based on 82 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The consensus reads, \"A haunting psychological drama, ''Time Out'' takes a penetrating look at the angst of the modern worker.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/time-out-l-emploi-du-temps/|title=Time Out (L' Emploi du temps) (2001) |website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=13 March 2016}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 88, based on 30 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/time-out|title=Time Out |website=Metacritic|access-date=13 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe film was placed at 99 on ''[[Slant Magazine]]s ''best films of the 2000s,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/feature/best-of-the-aughts-film/216/page_1|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|access-date=10 February 2010|title=Best of the Aughts: Film|date=7 February 2010}}</ref> number 9 of ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki/>'s best films of the noughties,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/100-best-films-of-the-noughties|title=100 Best Films of the Noughties|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=20 December 2010|location=London|date=17 December 2009}}</ref> and number 11 at ''[[The A.V.
