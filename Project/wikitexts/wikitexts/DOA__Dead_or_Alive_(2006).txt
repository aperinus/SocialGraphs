It is directed by [[Corey Yuen]] and written by [[J. F. Lawton]] and Adam and Seth Gross.\n\nIn the film, fighters are invited to ''Dead or Alive'', an invitational martial arts contest. The four female fighters begin as rivals, but work together to uncover the secret that the organizer of the tournament is trying to hide. It features an [[ensemble cast]] and has various appearances from characters of the franchise, led by [[Kasumi (Dead or Alive)|Kasumi]] ([[Devon Aoki]]), [[Christie (Dead or Alive)|Christie Allen]] ([[Holly Valance]]) and [[Tina Armstrong]] ([[Jaime Pressly]]).\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place from May to July 2005 in [[Bangkok]], [[Guilin]], Hengdian, and [[Hong Kong]]. It is an international co-production between Germany, United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n''DOA: Dead or Alive'' was first released on September 7, 2006, in Australia. It was later released in the United Kingdom on September 15 by [[United International Pictures]], and in Germany on October 19, 2006, by [[Constantin Film]]. The film was a critical and commercial failure, grossing only $7.7 million worldwide against a $30 million budget, making it a [[box-office bomb]]. Due to the film's poor performance, the United States release was delayed and the film was eventually given a [[limited theatrical release|limited release]] on June 15, 2007, by [[The Weinstein Company]] under [[Dimension Films]]. \n\n==Plot==\nA group of martial arts and combat masters are invited to a fighting contest, \"Dead or Alive\", on an isolated island within an advanced complex, with the ultimate prize of $10 million. Among the competitors are Kasumi, a [[Ninja|shinobi]] ninja-princess looking for her brother Hayate (who was competing in the last tournament), Tina, a professional wrestler setting out to prove she has more potential (complicated by her father Bass  being one of the contenders), Christie, a master thief and assassin, her treacherous partner Maximillian 'Max' Marsh, and Hayabusa, a friend of Kasumi and Hayate who follows Kasumi to keep her safe. A final competitor is Helena Douglas, daughter of the tournament's late founder. When they arrive, they are monitored by the island's supervisor, Dr. Victor Donovan, who, aided by egghead Weatherby, is gathering data (using injected nano-sensors) from the fights for some mysterious project. During the tournament, Max and Christie plan to steal the fortune stowed away inside a hidden vault. To add to the situation, an assassin from Kasumi's colony, named Ayane, has followed Kasumi to kill her and wipe away the disgrace the princess has caused to the clan.\n\nThe contest plays out, with multiple contestants fighting and being defeated (including Gen Fu, Bayman, Leon, and Zack), until only Kasumi, Christie, Hayabusa and Tina are left, with Helena being defeated by Christie. During her fight, Christie sees that the key to finding and unlocking the vault is a tattoo on the back of Helena's neck. Meanwhile, Kasumi begins to suspect Donovan of lying about her brother being killed in the previous tournament, and Hayabusa, infiltrating the main facility to find the truth, is captured. She is more than once confronted and nearly killed by Ayane, who Kasumi tries to convince that Hayate is alive (since it is eventually clear that Ayane loves Hayate). Also, Weatherby begins to fall for Helena, and in the end tells her about what he knows of the mystery project, and that before Helena's father could shut the project down, he died (indicating that he was murdered).\n\nOn the final day of the tournament, wondering where Hayabusa is, Kasumi, Christie and Tina look for him and discover a secret entrance to the main complex, where they find Hayabusa unconscious. They are then gassed and captured. Meanwhile, Helena resolves to stop the mystery project, and has to fight the armed staff of the island, sent to kill her and Weatherby by Donovan. They are followed inside by Max, who finds his way to the vault, and is then knocked out by Bayman, who is working for Donovan. Inside the main complex, Donovan shows the four semifinalists the project he has been developing; an advanced form of neural interface that allows him and others to use the fighters' combined skills to become the ultimate fighter. After 'downloading' the data into the device (shaped like a pair of sunglasses), he reveals that he kept Hayate alive and in peak condition to test the technology. He challenges Hayate to fight and win, if the others are to survive. Hayate accepts and is defeated, then thrown through a wall to die. Hayate is saved by Ayane, and the two of them apparently accept each other.\n\nWith the successful demonstration, Donovan prepares to sell the technology around the world, and begins \"[[download]]ing\" it to the watching buyers. Weatherby stops the broadcast and alerts the [[CIA]], which provokes Donovan to head for them. Helena keeps Donovan back while Weatherby frees the others, but both are defeated and Donovan activates a self-destruct sequence which will obliterate the base. Kasumi, Helena, Christie, Tina, Ayane, and Hayate launch a combined attack on Donovan, while Hayabusa and Weatherby find Max and escape with him, despite Max's urge to go back for the money. During the fight, Donovan's 'glasses' are knocked off and he is easily paralyzed by Hayate and Kasumi. The fighters then all escape as the base explodes and Donovan is consumed by the flames. They take a boat from a group of pirates. \n\nFinally, Helena, Ayane, Christie, Tina, and Kasumi stand together again in Kasumi's palace preparing to fight an army of ninjas.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|<!--- Per end credit order --->\n* [[Jaime Pressly]] as [[Tina Armstrong]], a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]\n* [[Devon Aoki]] as [[Kasumi (Dead or Alive)|Kasumi]], a [[Ninja|shinobi]] ninja-princess looking for her missing brother\n* [[Holly Valance]] as [[Christie (Dead or Alive)|Christie]], a thief and assassin\n* [[Sarah Carter]] as [[Helena Douglas]], the daughter of DOATEC's founder\n* [[Natassia Malthe]] as [[Ayane (Dead or Alive)|Ayane]], a ninja assassin whose mission is to seek out and kill Kasumi\n* [[Kane Kosugi]] as [[Ryu Hayabusa]], a ninja from Kasumi's clan and a faithful friend to her and Hayate\n* [[Matthew Marsden]] as Maximillian Marsh, a thief and Christie's partner\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as [[List of Dead or Alive characters#Victor Donovan|Victor Donovan]], the tournament organizer who has gained control of DOATEC after the death of Helena's father\n* [[Steve Howey (actor)|Steve Howey]] as Weatherby, the head scientist of DOATEC\n* [[Brian J.
