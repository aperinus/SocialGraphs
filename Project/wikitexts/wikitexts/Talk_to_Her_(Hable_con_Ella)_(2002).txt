The film follows two men who form an unlikely friendship as they care for two women who are both in [[coma]]s.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success, winning the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film Not in the English Language]] and the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] while Almod\u00f3var won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. It is generally regarded as one of the best films of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.theyshootpictures.com/21stcentury_allfilms_table.php |title= TSPDT - 21st Century (Full List) |date= 7 March 2016 |access-date= 7 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story unfolds in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, giving details of two separate relationships that become intertwined.\n\nAt a performance of ''Caf\u00e9 M\u00fcller'', a [[Tanztheater|dance-theatre]] piece by [[Pina Bausch]], Benigno Mart\u00edn and Marco Zuluaga are seated next to each other. They are strangers, but Benigno notices the tears on Marco's face at one point during the performance.\n\nMarco is a journalist and travel writer who sees a TV interview with Lydia Gonz\u00e1lez, a famous [[matador]]. He thinks that an article about her would be interesting and contacts her in a bar, where she asks him to take her home. The news that she has broken up with her boyfriend \"el Ni\u00f1o de Valencia\", another matador, has been all over the tabloids. When Marco confesses that he is a journalist who knows nothing about bullfighting, she becomes angry and abruptly exits his car outside her house. He starts to drive off but stops when he hears a scream from inside her house. Lydia rushes out and gets into his car. Marco goes inside to kill the snake, an act that leaves him weeping. Having shared some vulnerability, they become friends and, later on, lovers. Marco attends a wedding and is surprised to see Lydia there, since she had said that she did not want to go. The wedding is that of Marco's former fianc\u00e9e, \u00c1ngela, who had the same phobia of snakes as Lydia; Marco had been very much in love with \u00c1ngela and had difficulty getting over her, which was why he wept over things he could not share with her. Lydia says that she has something important to say, but she prefers to wait until after the bullfight that afternoon, during which she is gored and becomes [[coma]]tose. Marco remains by her side at the hospital and befriends Benigno, who recognizes him from the theatre performance. A doctor tells Marco that, while there are miracle-stories of people who have come out of comas, there is no reason for him to remain hopeful about Lydia.\n\nBenigno is obsessed with Alicia Roncero, a beautiful dancer whom he watches practicing in the studio that he can see into from the apartment where he lives with his invalid mother. To care for her, he became a nurse and a beautician. After his mother dies, he finds the courage to talk to Alicia when she drops her wallet on the street. As they walk to her house, she talks about dancing and her enjoyment of silent black and white films. When she enters her building, Benigno notices that it is also the office of Dr. Roncero, a psychiatrist. As a ruse to gain access to Alicia's apartment, Benigno makes an appointment to see the doctor. In response to the doctor's questions, Benigno talks about the years he cared for his mother and says that he is lonely and a virgin. Afterward, a shocked Alicia sees him leaving her room, from which he has taken a hair clip. That night she is struck by a car and becomes comatose. In the hospital, where Benigno is assigned to care for Alicia, he talks to her as if she were awake and brings her dancing and silent film mementos. He tells Marco that he should talk to Lydia because, even when in a coma, women understand men's problems. In response to Dr. Roncero's questioning, Benigno says that he is [[gay]], presumably so that the doctor will not be suspicious of his intimate care of Alicia.\n\n\"El Ni\u00f1o de Valencia,\" whom Marco finds in Lydia's room one day, tells Marco that Lydia and he had reconciled, that before the goring incident she intended to tell Marco that. He also says that, now that he has recovered from his own injuries, he should be the one attending to Lydia. Marco goes into Alicia's room and starts opening his heart to her. When Benigno appears, he tells Marco that he always thought Marco and Lydia would separate. A nurse expresses concern that Alicia has not had a period in two months and appears bloated. In the hospital parking lot, Benigno tells Marco of his desire to marry Alicia. Marco is taken aback, pointing out that Alicia cannot express her will in any way. Benigno remains unpersuaded.\n\nThe hospital staff discover that Alicia is pregnant because she was raped. Further investigation reveals that her chart does not indicate her missed period. Benigno admits to falsifying the chart and claims that he did this so as not to alarm anyone, as other comatose patients have also missed their periods. Another orderly reports having overheard Benigno's conversation with Marco about wanting to marry Alicia.\n\nUnaware of Alicia's pregnancy, Marco leaves for Jordan to write a travel book. Months later, he reads in a newspaper that Lydia has died without awakening from her coma. When he calls the hospital to talk to Benigno, a nurse tells him that Benigno is in prison for Alicia's rape and urges him to return for Benigno\u2019s sake because \u201che has no one.\u201d Benigno, who has been denied information about Alicia since his imprisonment, asks Marco to find out what has happened to her. Marco stays in Benigno's apartment, from which he sees Alicia in the dance studio doing rehab exercises with her teacher, Katrina. From Benigno's lawyer, Marco learns that Alicia had a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] baby. The lawyer urges him not to tell Benigno about the baby or Alicia's recovery.\n\nMarco, who adheres to this request, receives a voicemail from Benigno saying that he cannot live without Alicia and has decided to \"take off.\u201d Marco rushes to the prison, where Benigno has left him a farewell letter. Benigno had written that he hopes to take only enough pills to leave him in a comatose state in which he can join Alicia. He asks Marco to talk to him and tell him everything. Marco visits Benigno's grave and tells him about the stillbirth and Alicia\u2019s recovery.\n\nThe film ends in the theatre where it began, with Alicia and Katrina sitting a few rows behind Marco at the dance performance. During intermission, Alicia asks a distraught-looking Marco if he is alright. When the performance continues, Marco is seen turning back to look at a smiling Alicia and, echoing a caption that had appeared for the couples \"Marco y Lydia\" and \"Benigno y Alicia,\" the words \u201cMarco y Alicia\u201d appear on the screen.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Javier C\u00e1mara]] as Benigno Mart\u00edn\n* [[Dar\u00edo Grandinetti]] as Marco Zuluaga\n* [[Leonor Watling]] as Alicia Roncero\n* [[Rosario Flores]] as Lydia Gonz\u00e1lez\n* [[Mariola Fuentes]] as Rosa\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Katerina Bilova\n* [[Pina Bausch]] as herself dancing in ''Caf\u00e9 M\u00fcller''<ref>{{cite web |date=2005 |title=Pedro Almodovar talks about Pina Bausch's influence on his films |url=https://www.sadlerswells.com/discover-dance/pina-bausch/pedro_almodovar-on-pina-bausch/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220529020946/https://www.sadlerswells.com/discover-dance/pina-bausch/pedro_almodovar-on-pina-bausch/ |archive-date=28 May 2022 |access-date=27 July 2015 |publisher=[[Sadler's Wells]] |quote=When I finished writing Talk To Her and looked at Pina's face again, with her eyes closed, and at how she was dressed in a flimsy slip, her arms and hands outstretched, surrounded by obstacles (wooden tables and chairs), I had no doubt that it was the image which best represented the limbo in which my story's protagonists lived.}}</ref>\n* Malou Airaudo as 'Caf\u00e9 M\u00fcller' dancer\n* [[Caetano Veloso]] as himself singing \"[[Cucurrucuc\u00fa paloma]]\" at a party\n* Roberto \u00c1lvarez as Doctor\n* [[Elena Anaya]] as \u00c1ngela\n* [[Lola Due\u00f1as]] as Matilde\n* Adolfo Fern\u00e1ndez as Ni\u00f1o de Valencia\n* [[Ana Fern\u00e1ndez (actress, born 1963)|Ana Fern\u00e1ndez]] as Lydia's sister\n* [[Chus Lampreave]] as Caretaker\n* [[Paz Vega]] as Amparo (in silent film)\n* [[Cecilia Roth]] as Party guest (cameo)\n* [[Marisa Paredes]] as Party guest (cameo)\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating of 91% based on reviews from 136 critics, and an average rating of 8.10/10.
