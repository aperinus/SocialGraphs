The plot follows two teenage girls who find themselves in serious danger after making a prank phone call to a man who just murdered his wife. The screenplay by [[William P. McGivern]] was based upon the 1964 novel ''[[Out of the Dark (Curtiss novel)|Out of the Dark]]'' by [[Ursula Curtiss]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Scare tactic: the life & films of William Castle |last=Law |first=John W. |publisher=Writers Club Press |year=2000 |isbn=0595095445 |location=San Jose [Calif.] |pages=137 |oclc=60884288}}</ref> The film was produced and directed by [[William Castle]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhen teenage friends Libby Mannering (Andi Garrett) and Kit Austin ([[Sara Lane (actress born 1949)|Sara Lane]]) are home alone with Libby's younger sister Tess (Sharyl Locke), they amuse themselves by randomly dialing telephone numbers asking prank questions, telling whomever answers: \"I saw what you did, and I know who you are.\" Libby places a call to Steve Marak ([[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]]), a man who had just murdered his wife Judith ([[Joyce Meadows]]) and disposed of her body in the woods. Believing he has been found out, Marak wants to track down the caller in order to silence her.\n\nMarak's neighbor Amy ([[Joan Crawford]]), who is in love with him and had been trying to woo him away from his wife, listens in on the line while Marak is speaking with Libby. Intrigued by Marak's voice, Libby takes Tess and a frightened Kit along on a drive to Marak's address. Amy discovers Libby and chases her off, thinking that Libby is Marak's lover, inadvertently saving Libby from being murdered by Marak, who has seen her and grabbed a knife. Amy snatches the registration card from the car before Libby drives away and gives it to Marak, telling him to keep it as a souvenir of his last fling. Amy tries to blackmail him into marrying her, telling him she knows about the murder, but he stabs her to death after they have a drink. With Libby's address and phone number from the car registration, Marak calls to ask if her parents are home and then sets out to the Mannering home.\n\nLibby's mother, 90 miles away in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] with her husband, is frantic with worry when no one answers the home phone and has her husband call the police to check the house. A patrolman visits and finds that the three girls are safe.\n\nLibby, afraid of losing her driving privileges, swears Kit to secrecy over their misadventure. While Kit's father is driving her home, a news report over the car's radio announces that a woman's body has been found in the woods and provides a description of a man who was seen leaving the burial site.\n\nMarak arrives at the Mannering home and questions Libby and Tess about the call. Libby convinces him that it was just a prank. He returns her mother's identification and leaves, but waits outside. When Kit calls, she tells Libby that Marak matches the description of the killer about whom she had heard on the radio. Marak overhears and enters to silence Libby and Tess, but they evade him. Libby tries to escape but cannot start her parents' car. Marak emerges from the back seat and starts to strangle Libby, but he is shot by a police officer who had come back to the Mannering house after Kit revealed the secret to her father, who phoned the police.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joan Crawford]] as Amy Nelson\n* [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] as Steve Marak\n* [[Leif Erickson (actor)|Leif Erickson]] as Dave Mannering\n* [[Sara Lane (actress born 1949)|Sara Lane]] as Kit Austin\n* Andi Garrett as Libby Mannering\n* Sharyl Locke as Tess Mannering\n* [[Patricia Breslin]] as Ellie Mannering\n* [[John Archer (actor)|John Archer]] as John Austin\n* [[John Crawford (actor)|John Crawford]] as State Trooper\n* [[Joyce Meadows]] as Judith Marak\n\n==Production notes==\nAdvertisements for the movie read \"William Castle warns you: This is a motion picture about [[uxoricide|UXORICIDE]]!\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2005697165/ |title=I saw what you did and I know who you are  |website=[[Library of Congress]] |year=1965 |access-date=2017-10-07}}</ref> and, in an early trailer for the film, Castle advised the audience that a section of the theater would be installed with seat belts for audience members \"who might be scared out of their seats.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Scare tactic : the life & films of William Castle |last=Law |first=John W. |publisher=Writers Club Press |year=2000 |isbn=0595095445 |location=San Jose [Calif.] |pages=142 |oclc=60884288}}</ref> The advertised gimmick was abandoned before the release of the film and was never actually used.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307131227/http://movies.go.com/i-saw-what-you-did-and-i-know-who-you-are/d792768/horror|archive-date=2008-03-07|url=http://movies.go.com/i-saw-what-you-did-and-i-know-who-you-are/d792768/horror|title=I Saw What You Did and I Know Who You Are!|quote=Factoid: In an early trailer for this film, gimmick king Castle promised the audience a gimmick of seat belts for the seats in a section of the theater to help audience members \"who might be scared out of their seats.\" This concept was never followed through with, and the picture came out with no gimmicks attached.|access-date=2012-03-11}}</ref> The announcer in the film's [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] says repeatedly: \"DON'T ANSWER IT!!!\"\n\n==Critical reviews==\nHoward Thompson called ''I Saw What You Did'' a \"generally broad and belabored expansion of a nifty idea\"; he considered redundant the \"middle chapter\" of the film, \"involving the aroused, snarling killer\" and thought the film should have \"held to the impressionable viewpoint of the youngsters.\"<ref name=\"nyt65\">{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E4D91F30E033A25751C2A9619C946491D6CF|title=Thriller Double-Bill|date=July 22, 1965|first=Howard|last=Thompson|author-link= Howard Thompson (film critic)|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2012-03-10}}</ref> ''Saturday Review'' noted \"Unfortunately, there is little for the eye, ear, or mind in William Castle's egregiously low-budgeted ''I Saw What You Did'', an attempt at terror starring Joan Crawford and John Ireland.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Scare tactic: the life & films of William Castle |last=Law |first=John W. |publisher=Writers Club Press |year=2000 |isbn=0595095445 |location=San Jose [Calif.] |pages=143 |oclc=60884288}}</ref> ''Variety'' wrote \"[The film] is a well-produced, well-acted entry in the suspense-terror field....[Crawford's] slightest gesture or expression...conveys vivid emotion.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Quirk|first=Lawrence J.|title=The Films of Joan Crawford|url=https://archive.org/details/filmsofjoancrawf0000quir|url-access=registration|publisher=The Citadel Press|year=1968|isbn=9780806500089 }}</ref>\n\nDavid Harkin suggested that 'I Saw What You Did is 'a curious film; it swings from violent terror to situation comedy, all tied together with a bizarre music score' <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2021/10-great-thriller-movies-you-probably-havent-seen/2/ | title=10 Great Thriller Movies You Probably Haven't Seen }}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n''I Saw What You Did'' was released by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] on VHS and Region 1 DVD on August 24, 1999.
