S. Wilson]] and [[Brent Maddock]] alongside [[Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman]], from a story penned by brothers [[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim]] and [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]]. Loosely adapted from ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', a 1960s television series created by [[Michael Garrison (producer)|Michael Garrison]], it is the only production since the [[television film]] ''More Wild Wild West'' (1980) to feature the characters from the original series.\n\nThe film stars [[Will Smith]] (who previously collaborated with Sonnenfeld on ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' two years earlier) and [[Kevin Kline]] as two [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] agents who work together to protect [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (Kline, in a [[dual role]]) and the United States from all manner of dangerous threats during the [[American frontier|American Old West]]. The film features a supporting cast consisting of [[Kenneth Branagh]], [[Salma Hayek]], [[Ted Levine]], and [[M. Emmet Walsh]], as well as an [[orchestra]]l [[film score]] by [[Western (genre)|Western]] film score veteran [[Elmer Bernstein]] and extensive [[visual effects]] courtesy of [[Industrial Light & Magic]].\n\nReleased theatrically in the United States on June 30, 1999 by [[Warner Bros.]] and produced on a $170&nbsp;million budget (making it one of the [[List of most expensive films#Most expensive films (adjusted for inflation)|most expensive films ever made when adjusting for inflation]] at the time of its release),<ref name=\"Strauss (2004)\">{{cite news |last=Strauss |first=Gary |date=July 15, 2004 |title=Sci-fi searches for a new angle |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-07-15-sci-fi-main_x.htm |access-date=December 29, 2009 |archive-date=June 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628183530/http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-07-15-sci-fi-main_x.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Time (2009b)\">{{cite magazine |author=Time staff |date=August 28, 2009 |title=Top 10 Disappointing Blockbusters: Wild Wild West |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2009/08/28/top-10-disappointing-blockbusters/slide/wild-wild-west/ |access-date=December 29, 2009 |archive-date=June 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603133115/http://entertainment.time.com/2009/08/28/top-10-disappointing-blockbusters/slide/wild-wild-west/ |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Wild Wild West'' was a [[Box-office bomb|commercial failure]], grossing only $113.8&nbsp;million domestically and $108.3&nbsp;million overseas for a worldwide total of $222.1&nbsp;million. Receiving negative reviews from critics, the film was nominated for eight [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzies]] and won five at the [[20th Golden Raspberry Awards]], including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song|Worst Original Song]] (for the song [[Wild Wild West (Will Smith song)|\"Wild Wild West\"]] by Smith).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1869, four years after the end of the [[American Civil War]], [[United States Army|U.S Army]] [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] James T. \"Jim\" West and [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Artemus Gordon hunt for ex-[[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General officer|General]] \"Bloodbath\" McGrath, responsible for a massacre in New Liberty where West's parents were killed. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] informs the two about the disappearances of America's key scientists and a treasonous plot by McGrath and gives them the task of finding the scientists.\n\nAboard their train ''The Wanderer'', West and Gordon examine the severed head of scientist Thaddeus Morton, finding a clue that leads them to Dr. Arliss Loveless, a legless ex-Confederate officer and engineering genius. Infiltrating Loveless' [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation]] during a party, the duo rescues a woman named Rita Escobar, who asks for their help in rescuing her father, Guillermo Escobar, one of the kidnapped scientists. Loveless holds a demonstration of his newest weapon, a steam-powered [[gun carriage]], and angers McGrath by using his soldiers for target practice. Accusing McGrath of \"betrayal\" for surrendering at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]], Loveless shoots and leaves him for dead. Gordon, West, and Rita find the dying McGrath, who reveals he was framed by Loveless for the massacre, before succumbing to his gunshot wound. The three catch up with Loveless on The Wanderer. After a brief fight, Rita accidentally releases [[Incapacitating agent#Sleeping gas|sleeping gas]], which knocks out West, Gordon, and herself.\n\nWest and Gordon wake up as Loveless pulls away in The Wanderer, taking Rita hostage. Announcing his intention to capture President Grant at the [[golden spike]] ceremony, he leaves the duo in a deadly trap from which they narrowly escape. West and Gordon stumble across Loveless' private railroad, leading to his secret industrial complex at Spider Canyon where they witness Loveless' ultimate weapon, a gigantic mechanical [[spider]] armed with [[nitroglycerin]] cannons. Loveless uses his spider to capture Grant and Gordon at the ceremony while West is shot and left for dead by one of Loveless' henchwomen after being caught sneaking in the spider. At his complex, Loveless announces his plan to dissolve the United States, dividing the territory among [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people, and Loveless himself - but Grant refuses to surrender, and Loveless orders Gordon to be executed. However, West \u2013 having survived being shot earlier \u2013 disguises himself as a [[belly dance]]r and distracts Loveless, allowing Gordon to free the captives.\n\nLoveless then escapes on his spider, taking Grant with him. He again demands that Grant accept his terms of surrender, but Grant continues to reject his ultimatum, and Loveless retaliates by destroying a small town. Using an \"Air Gordon\" flying machine, Gordon and West catch up to the spider where West battles Loveless' henchmen before confronting Loveless himself, now on mechanical legs. After freeing Grant, Gordon shoots one of Loveless' metal legs, allowing West to gain the upper hand. As the mechanical spider approaches a cliff, Loveless shoots at West with the concealed gun he used to kill McGrath, but instead hits the spider's machinery, halting it abruptly at the canyon's edge. Both West and Loveless fall from the spider, but West survives by catching a chain dangling from the machinery. Grant promotes Gordon and West as the first agents of his new [[United States Secret Service]]. After Grant departs on The Wanderer, West and Gordon reunite with Rita, whom they both attempt to court, but she announces that Professor Escobar is her husband. Gordon and West ride into the sunset on the spider.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Captain James \"Jim\" T.

For example, Dr. Loveless \u2013 as portrayed by Kenneth Branagh in the film \u2013 went from a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] to a man without legs who uses a steam-powered wheelchair (similar to that employed by the villain in the episode \"The Night of the Brain\"); his first name was also changed from Miguelito to Arliss and was given the motive of a Southerner who sought the defeat of the North after the Civil War. Kevin Kline plays Gordon, whose character was similar to the original version portrayed by [[Ross Martin]] except that he was much more competitive with Jim West, besides being much more egotistical. The film's script had Kline's Gordon create more ridiculous, humorous, and implausible inventions than those created by Martin's Gordon in the television series, as well as having an aggressive rivalry with West, whereas in the television series, West and he had a very close friendship and trusted each other with their lives. While Gordon did indeed impersonate Grant in the series (\"The Night of the Steel Assassin\", \"The Night of the Colonel's Ghost\", and \"The Night of the Big Blackmail\"), they were not played by the same actor. Additionally, on the TV series, West was portrayed by [[Robert Conrad]], a Caucasian rather than an [[African American]] \u2013 which serves a critical plot point as West's parents were among the victims of Loveless's massacre at New Liberty.\n\n[[Jon Peters]] produced the film alongside director Sonnenfeld. In a 2002 Q&A event that appears on ''[[An Evening with Kevin Smith]]'', filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]] talked about working with Peters on a [[Superman in film#Superman Lives|fifth potential ''Superman'' film]] in 1997, revealing that Peters had three demands for the script. The first demand was that [[Superman]] not wear the suit, the second was that Superman not fly, and the third was to have Superman fight a giant spider in the third act.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cronin|first=Brian|title=Was Superman a Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed|year=2009|publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=978-0-452-29532-2|pages=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKLNpPMHF5cC&pg=PA24|access-date=July 26, 2016|archive-date=February 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222225847/https://books.google.com/books?id=eKLNpPMHF5cC&pg=PA24|url-status=live}}</ref> After [[Tim Burton]] came on board, Smith's script was scrapped and the film was never produced due to further complications. A year later, he noted that ''Wild Wild West'', with Peters on board as producer, was released with the inclusion of a giant mechanical spider in the final act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgYhLIThTvk|title=Kevin Smith talks about Superman|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=August 29, 2016|archive-date=August 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826151930/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgYhLIThTvk|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Neil Gaiman]] also said that Peters insisted that a giant mechanical spider be included in a proposed film adaptation of ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5661|title=The \"MirrorMask\" Interviews: Neil Gaiman & Dave McKean|date=September 15, 2005|website=Comicbookresources.com|access-date=October 11, 2017|archive-date=May 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505031022/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5661|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in 1998. The sequences on both Artemus Gordon and Dr. Loveless's trains interiors were shot on sets at Warner Bros. Burbank Studios, 4000 Warner Boulevard, [[Burbank, California]]. The train exteriors were shot in [[Idaho]] on the [[Camas Prairie Railroad]]. ''The Wanderer'' is portrayed by the Baltimore & Ohio 4\u20134\u20130 No. 25, one of the oldest operating steam locomotives in the U.S. Built in 1856 at the [[Mason Machine Works]] in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], it was later renamed The [[William Mason (locomotive)|''William Mason'']] in honor of its manufacturer. During preproduction, the engine was sent to the steam shops at the [[Strasburg Rail Road]] for restoration and repainting. The locomotive is brought out for the B&O Train Museum in Baltimore's \"Steam Days\". The ''William Mason'' and the [[Virginia and Truckee 22 Inyo|''Inyo'']] (which was the locomotive used in the original television series) both appeared in the 1956 [[Disney]] film ''[[The Great Locomotive Chase]]''.\n\nMuch of the Wild West footage was shot around [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], particularly at the western town film set at the Cook Movie Ranch (now [[Cerro Pelon Ranch]]). During the shooting of a sequence involving stunts and pyrotechnics, a planned building fire grew out of control and quickly overwhelmed the local fire crews that were standing by. Much of the town was destroyed before the fire was contained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/bus/scottburns/columns/archives/2000/000827SIDE.htm|title='Fire in the Wild, Wild West|website=Dallasnews.com|date=August 27, 2000|access-date=October 11, 2017|archive-date=September 12, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912212553/http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/bus/scottburns/columns/archives/2000/000827SIDE.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe film's orchestral score, including its main theme, was composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein, a veteran of many [[Western (genre)|Western]] film scores such as ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''. The score mainly follows the Western genre's symphonic tradition, while at times also acknowledging the film's anachronistic playfulness by employing a more contemporary music style with notable rock percussion and [[electronic organ]]. The score also briefly incorporates [[Richard Markowitz]]'s theme from the television series in one cue (uncredited in the film and not included on the album); ironically, this was one of the few elements to be faithful to the original television series, which also did not credit Markowitz for the theme. Additional parts of the score were composed by Bernstein's son [[Peter Bernstein (composer)|Peter]], while his daughter Emilie served as one of the orchestrators and producers.\n\nLike most of his films during this period, Will Smith recorded a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] song based on the film's plot, also titled \"[[Wild Wild West (Will Smith song)|Wild Wild West]]\". \"Wild Wild West\" was a number-one hit on the U.S. pop charts, but it also won a [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song]]. It was produced by [[Rob Fusari]], who lifted a [[Sample (music)|sample]] from [[Stevie Wonder]]'s 1976 hit \"[[I Wish (Stevie Wonder song)|I Wish]]\".

Ralston helped create the original television series ''The Wild Wild West'' and scripted the pilot episode \"The Night of the Inferno\". In a deposition, Ralston explained that in 1964, he had been approached by producer Michael Garrison, who \"said he had an idea for a series, good commercial idea, and wanted to know if I could glue the idea of a Western hero and a [[James Bond]] type together in the same show\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Bernard Weinraub|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/08/movies/wild-west-showdown-for-early-tv-writers-lawsuit-seeks-royalties-for-60-s-series.html|title='Wild West' Showdown For Early TV Writers; Lawsuit Seeks Royalties for 60's Series|work=The New York Times|date=July 8, 1999|access-date=April 11, 2018|archive-date=April 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403022200/https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/08/movies/wild-west-showdown-for-early-tv-writers-lawsuit-seeks-royalties-for-60-s-series.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Ralston said he then created the Civil War characters, the format, the story outline and nine drafts of the script that were the basis for the television series. It was his idea, for example, to have a secret agent named Jim West who would perform secret missions for a bumbling President Grant.\n\nRalston's experience brought to light a common Hollywood practice of the 1950s and 1960s when television writers who helped create popular series allowed producers or studios to take credit for a show, thus cheating the writers out of millions of dollars in royalties. However, Ralston died in 1999 before his suit was settled, resulting in Warner Bros. paying his family between $600,000 and $1.5&nbsp;million.<ref>''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', July 15, 2005</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film|1990s}}\n* [[List of Western films of the 1990s]]\n* [[List of steampunk works]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0120891}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|180001}}\n* [http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/records/budgets.php Budgets (Record-setting)- The Numbers.com]\n\n{{S-start}} {{S-ach|aw}}\n{{Succession box\n| title=[[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Razzie Award for Worst Picture]]\n| years=[[20th Golden Raspberry Awards]]\n| before=''[[An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn]]''\n| after=''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]''\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Barry Sonnenfeld}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''Wild Wild West''\n|list =\n{{Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award for Worst Film}}\n{{Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture}}\n{{Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay 1980\u20132000}}\n{{Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Combo}}\n{{Stinkers Bad Movie Award for Worst Picture}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1999 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:1999 action comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s buddy cop films]]\n[[Category:1990s Western (genre) comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s Western (genre) science fiction films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American alternate history films]]\n[[Category:American buddy cop films]]\n[[Category:American action comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) comedy films]]\n[[Category:American Western (genre) science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:African-American films]]\n[[Category:African-American action films]]\n[[Category:African-American comedy films]]\n[[Category:African-American Western (genre) films]]\n[[Category:Cross-dressing in American films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Ulysses S.
