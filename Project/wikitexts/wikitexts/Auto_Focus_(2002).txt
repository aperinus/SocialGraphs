The screenplay by Michael Gerbosi is based on [[Robert Graysmith]]'s book ''The Murder of Bob Crane'' (1993).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Booth |first=William |date=March 1, 2007 |title=A Killer Obsession |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/28/AR2007022801979.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Graysmith, Robert |url=https://archive.org/details/murderofbobcrane00gray |title=The Murder of Bob Crane: Who Killed the Star of Hogan's Heroes? |date=May 18, 1993 |isbn=9780517592090 |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n''Auto Focus'' tells a dramatized story of the actor [[Bob Crane]], an affable radio show host and amateur drummer who found success on ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'', a popular television [[situation comedy|sitcom]], and his dramatic descent into the underbelly of Hollywood after the series was cancelled, and after forming a friendship with [[John Henry Carpenter]].\n\nCarpenter was tried and, later [[acquittal|acquitted]] (1994), of Crane's murder. Although the crime remains officially unsolved, Carpenter has remained the main subject of suspicion even after his death in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Motion Picture Purgatory: Auto Focus |url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34357/motion-picture-purgatory-auto-focus |website=DreadCentral|date=3 November 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nDisc-jockey-turned-actor [[Bob Crane]] develops a secret personal life, focusing on his relationship with [[John Henry Carpenter]], an electronics expert involved with the nascent [[Videocassette recorder#First home video recorders|home video]] market. Encouraged by Carpenter and enabled by his expertise, Crane\u2014a church-going, clean-cut family man\u2014becomes a [[sexual addiction|sex addict]] obsessed with women and with recording his encounters using video and photographic equipment, usually with Carpenter participating.\n\nAs the years pass, the relationship between Crane and Carpenter unravels in a dangerous way. Crane is divorced by his wife Anne before marrying Patricia Olson, a former co-star from his hit television series ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''. After the show goes off the air, Crane struggles to find work while dealing with money troubles. By the time [[Walt Disney Productions]] hires him for the leading role in a family movie, ''[[Superdad]]'', his reputation for being obsessed with sex and pornography starts to jeopardize his image.\n\nConfined to doing [[dinner theater]] in mid-sized cities, Crane's attempts to distance himself from Carpenter fail as their sexual escapades continue. Carpenter soon becomes \"my only friend\", but after a final falling-out between them in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], someone bludgeons Crane to death inside a motel room. Carpenter is tried for the murder, but many years later, he is [[acquittal|acquitted]] in 1994. To this day, Crane's murder remains unsolved.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as [[Bob Crane]]\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[John Henry Carpenter]]\n* [[Rita Wilson]] as Anne Crane\n* [[Maria Bello]] as [[Sigrid Valdis|Patricia Olson-Crane / Sigrid Valdis]]\n* [[Ron Leibman]] as Lenny\n* [[Michael E.

Greg Kinnear and Willem Dafoe can be heard joking about how the stylist made up Kinnear's hair to resemble Bob Crane's. A quick online search for photos of the real Bob Crane reveals that, while taking pains to match Crane's hair color and thickness as Kinnear noted,  the stylist parted his hair on the wrong side.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film met with a largely positive reception from critics.  A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film \"gets to you like a low-grade fever, a malaise with no known antidote. When it was over, I wasn't sure if I needed a drink, a shower or a lifelong vow of [[chastity]] ... there is [a] severe, powerful moralism lurking beneath the film's dispassionate matter-of-factness. Mr. Schrader is indifferent to the sinner, but he cannot contain his loathing of the sin, which is not so much sex as the fascination with images ... To argue that images can corrupt the flesh and hollow out the soul is, for a filmmaker, an obviously contradictory exercise, but not necessarily a hypocritical one. There is plenty of nudity in ''Auto Focus,'' but you can always glimpse the abyss behind the undulating bodies, and the director leads you from easy titillation to suffocating dread, pausing only briefly and cautiously to consider the possibility of pleasure.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Scott, A.O. |date=October 4, 2002 |title=Movies: Auto Focus |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/04/movies/04AUTO.html}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four stars calling it \"a hypnotic portrait ... pitch-perfect in its decor, music, clothes, cars, language and values ...

In an October 2002 piece he wrote on the film, Scotty said that his father was not a regular church-goer and had only been to church three times in the last dozen years of his life, including his own funeral. There is no evidence that Crane engaged in [[Sadomasochism|S&M]], and director Paul Schrader told Scotty that the S&M scene was based on Schrader's own personal experience. Scotty claims that his father and John Carpenter did not become close friends who socialized together until 1975, and that Crane was already a sex addict and had recorded his sexual encounters since 1956, long before he became famous.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Crane |first=Scotty |title=Raging Bullshit: Auto Focus Is Not My Dad's Story |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/raging-bullshit/Content?oid=12356 |access-date=14 August 2011 |publisher=The Stranger}}</ref>\n\nScotty and his mother had written their own script for a film biography on Crane. The [[spec script]], alternately titled \"F-Stop\" and \"Take Off Your Clothes and Smile\", was written up in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' by columnist [[Army Archerd]], but after ''Auto-Focus'' was announced, interest in Scotty's script ceased.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Truth About Bob Crane |url=http://mortystv.com/bob_crane.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724094408/http://mortystv.com/bob_crane.shtml |archive-date=24 July 2011 |access-date=14 August 2011 |publisher=Morty's TV.com}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nPaul Schrader was nominated for the [[Golden Seashell]] at the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Willem Dafoe was nominated for Best Supporting Actor by the [[Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 2003|Chicago Film Critics Association]] but lost to [[Tim Robbins]] for ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Amg movie|263933|Auto Focus}}\n* {{IMDb title | id=0298744 | title= Auto Focus}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|auto_focus|Auto Focus}}\n\n{{Paul Schrader}}\n\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2002 biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about actors]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paul Schrader]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1970s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Scottsdale, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Films set in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:Films about pornography]]\n[[Category:Films about sex addiction]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Angelo Badalamenti]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Brian Oliver]]\n[[Category:2002 drama films]]\n[[Category:2002 independent films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
