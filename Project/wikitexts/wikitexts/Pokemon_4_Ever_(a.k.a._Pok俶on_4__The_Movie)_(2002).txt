Grossfeld]]. The English adaption stars the regular television cast: [[Veronica Taylor]], [[Eric Stuart]], [[Rachael Lillis]] and [[Maddie Blaustein]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a forest in the [[Johto]] region, a Pok\u00e9mon trainer named Sammy is warned by a woman named Towa to be wary of the \u201cVoice of the Forest\u201d, which is [[Celebi (Pok\u00e9mon)|Celebi]], a Pok\u00e9mon capable of [[time travel]]. Celebi is pursued by a Pok\u00e9mon hunter and is injured. Sammy protects it from the hunter, but Celebi uses its powers to travel forward in time, taking Sammy with it. Forty years later, the elderly hunter is confronted by the Iron Masked Marauder, a cruel and  sinister member of [[Team Rocket]], who seeks to enslave Celebi. The Marauder uses a Dark Ball(a unique poke ball that can capture Pok\u00e9mon already owned by Trainers, turns them evil, and increases their power to the highest level) on the hunter's Tyranitar and orders it to use its Hyper Beam attack to destroy most of the hunter's possessions.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Ash Ketchum]], [[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]] and [[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]] arrive in the neighbourhood of Arborville, spotting the legendary [[Suicune]] on a riverbank. Speaking to [[Professor Oak]], the trio learn he encountered Suicune himself many years ago, but they have to depart before he can explain how. The group are taken to the forest by a local named Mr. White, but encounter the elderly Towa and her granddaughter Diana, warned of the Voice of the Forest. Celebi and Sammy appear from the past, but the former hides, while Sammy comes to term with his time displacement. Ash, Sammy, Misty and Brock find the wounded Celebi and decide to take him to the Lake of Life, said to have healing waters.\n\n[[Team Rocket#Team Rocket trio|Team Rocket]] pursue the children, joining forces with the Marauder. The children are guided to the lake by wild Pok\u00e9mon, where Celebi is healed. That night, Ash and Sammy bond, hoping the latter can return to his era. The next day, the Marauder confronts the group, using a Dark Ball to capture Celebi and uses its immense powers over nature to encase it in enormous draconian-like armour made from the forest. Jessie is captured; the Marauder admitting he plots to overthrow Team Rocket's leader Giovanni and conquer the world. Ash, his friends, and Suicune battle to rescue Celebi from the Marauder's influence.\n\nAsh, Sammy and [[Pikachu]] breach Celebi's armour and convince it to resist the Marauder, regaining his memories and is freed from the Dark Ball's influence. The Marauder and Jessie tumble in the lake as Celebi's armour collapses.\n\nHowever, upon taking Celebi to the lakeside, it dies in Sammy's arms. The group attempt to revive it when Suicune purifies the lake, but it fails. Just as all hope of reviving Celebi is lost, the Voice of the Forest, which is actually each Celebi from across time, materializes in the sky and magically [[Resurrection|resurrects]] their brother. Suddenly, the Marauder appears and kidnaps Celebi, using a [[jetpack]] to escape, but Ash and Pikachu rescue Celebi, the Marauder crashing into the forest and is confronted by Towa, Diana, White, and the angry wild Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nCelebi takes Sammy back to his own time, who promises to reunite with Ash in the future. The Marauder's freed Pok\u00e9mon go their separate ways, as [[Giovanni (Pok\u00e9mon)|Giovanni]] would learn about the Marauder's betrayal and urge to kill him and claim Team Rocket for himself and refuse to bail him out. Ash, Misty, and Brock speak to Professor Oak of their adventure, Ash saddened by Sammy's departure. However, Professor Oak reassures him that friendships can withstand the test of time and he and Sammy will remain friends. However, upon ending the call, the trio are perplexed about how Professor Oak knew Sammy's name, having never mentioned it. In his laboratory, Oak owns Sammy's sketchbook, revealing he is the same character. During the end credits, [[Tracey Sketchit|Tracey]] discovers Oak's sketchbook and inserts it into a bookshelf for safekeeping. In the end, Jessie is swimming in the lake when James and Meowth find her on a raft. Soon after the Tyranitar which was caught by the Marauder attacks the raft. Team Rocket, having their raft destroyed, decide to relax in the lake.\n\n== Cast ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!Japanese\n!English\n|-\n![[Ash Ketchum]]\n|[[Rika Matsumoto]]\n|[[Veronica Taylor]]\n|-\n![[Pikachu]]\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center\"|[[Ikue \u014ctani]]\n|-\n![[Misty (Pok\u00e9mon)|Misty]]\n|[[Mayumi Iizuka]]\n|[[Rachael Lillis]]\n|-\n![[Brock (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brock]]\n|[[Yuuji Ueda]]\n|[[Eric Stuart]]\n|-\n![[Togepi]]\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center\"|[[Satomi K\u014drogi]]\n|-\n![[Team Rocket (anime)#Jessie|Jessie]]\n|[[Megumi Hayashibara]]\n|Rachael Lillis\n|-\n![[Team Rocket (anime)#James|James]]\n|[[Shin-ichiro Miki|Shinichirou Miki]]\n|Eric Stuart\n|-\n![[Team Rocket (anime)#Meowth|Meowth]]\n|[[Inuko Inuyama]]\n|[[Maddie Blaustein]]\n|-\n![[Bayleef]]\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center\"|[[Mika Kanai]]\n|-\n!Sammy\n|[[Keiko Toda]]\n|[[Tara Sands]]\n|-\n!Diana\n|[[Anne Suzuki]]\n|[[Roxanne Beck]]\n|-\n!Towa\n|[[Mami Koyama]]\n|Veronica Taylor<br />[[Kerry Williams]] (young)\n|-\n!Iron Masked Marauder\n|[[Shir\u014d Sano]]\n|[[Dan Green (voice actor)|Dan Green]]\n|-\n!Scizor\n|[[Katsuyuki Konishi]]\n|Eric Stuart\n|-\n!Sneasel\n|[[Yumi T\u014dma]]\n|[[Kayzie Rogers]]\n|-\n![[Celebi (Pok\u00e9mon)|Celebi]]\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center\"|[[Kazuko Sugiyama]]\n|-\n![[Suicune]]\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center\"|[[Masahiko Tanaka]]\n|-\n!White\n|[[Takashi Fujii]]\n|[[Marc Thompson (voice actor)|Marc Thompson]]\n|-\n!Hunter\n|[[Kouichi Yamadera]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Eric Stuart\n|-\n!Hunter's [[Scyther]]\n|[[Koichi Sakaguchi]]\n|-\n!Hunter's [[Houndoom]]\n|[[Tomoyuki K\u014dno]]\n|\n|-\n!Hunter's [[Ursaring]]\n|[[Hisao Egawa]]\n|\n|-\n!Hunter's [[Furret]]\n|Akiko Suzuki\n|\n|-\n!Hunter's [[Teddiursa]]\n|[[Ryouka Yuzuki]]\n|Tara Jayne\n|-\n!Hunter's [[Stantler]]\n|Shinichi Namiki\n|\n|-\n!Hunter's [[Oddish]]\n|Kaori Tsuji\n|Kayzie Rogers\n|-\n![[Croconaw]]\n|Masaru Motegi\n|Eric Stuart\n|-\n!Professor Oak\n|[[Unsh\u014d Ishizuka]]\n|[[Stuart Zagnit]] \n|-\n!Tracey Sketchit\n|[[Tomokazu Seki]]\n|[[Ted Lewis (voice actor)|Ted Lewis]]\n|-\n!Narrator\n|Unsh\u014d Ishizuka\n|[[Rodger Parsons]] \n|}\n\n==Production==\n\nThe movie was directed by [[Kunihiko Yuyama]] and written by Hideki Sonoda.<ref name=\"times\" /> Norman Grossfeld, the producer of the English adaption, said that the animation quality in the film was the \"finest yet\" from [[OLM, Inc.|Oriental Light and Magic]].

The film's flat, traditional anime aesthetic is perfectly suited to the look of the bold, cartoon-like creatures, though the animators switch to a more CGI-influenced look for portions of the final battle sequence. While well done, these scenes feel jarring and out of sync with the rest of the film.
