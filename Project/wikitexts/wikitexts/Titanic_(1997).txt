Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking]] of the [[Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] and stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Kate Winslet]] as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. Also starring are [[Billy Zane]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Frances Fisher]], [[Gloria Stuart]], [[Bernard Hill]], [[Jonathan Hyde]], [[Victor Garber]], and [[Bill Paxton]].\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with [[shipwreck]]s; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster.

[[Scale model]]s, [[computer-generated imagery]], and a reconstruction of the ''Titanic'' built at [[Baja Studios]] were used to re-create the sinking. The film was co-financed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]]; the former handled distribution in North America while the latter released the film internationally. It was the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] at the time, with a production budget of $200&nbsp;million.\n\nUpon its release on December 19, 1997, ''Titanic'' achieved significant critical and commercial success, and then received [[List of accolades received by Titanic|numerous accolades]]. Nominated for 14 [[Academy Awards]], it tied ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950)<!-- NOTE: La La Land (film) does not belong in the lead (introduction) of this article.

With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84&nbsp;billion, ''Titanic'' was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|the highest-grossing film of all time]] until another Cameron film, ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', surpassed it in 2010. A [[3D film|3D]] version of ''Titanic,'' released on April 4, 2012, to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6&nbsp;million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.195&nbsp;billion and making it the second film to gross more than $2&nbsp;billion worldwide (after ''Avatar''). In 2017, the film was re-released for its 20th anniversary and was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not add significant detail to this section; there is a 700-word standard specified in WP:FILMPLOT.

They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they only find a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the ''Titanic'' struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.{{refn|Although the ''Titanic'' hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.|group = Note}} Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard ''Keldysh''. She recounts her experiences aboard ''Titanic''.\n\nIn 1912 [[Southampton]], 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fianc\u00e9 Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley, and Rose's widowed mother, Ruth, board the ''Titanic''. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage to Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class ''Titanic'' ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to jump overboard. Jack appears and coaxes her back onto the deck. The two develop a tentative friendship, but when Cal and Ruth strongly object, Rose acquiesces and discourages Jack's attention. She soon realizes she has feelings for Jack.\n\nRose brings Jack to her state room and pays him a coin to sketch her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in a [[Renault Towncar]] inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers and builder discussing the serious situation. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and Rose's insulting note left inside his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is then confined in the [[master-at-arms]]' office. Cal then puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.\n\nWith the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they barely make it back to the boat deck. Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Having arranged to save himself, Cal falsely claims he can get Jack safely off the ship. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back on board. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. They get away, and Cal realizes that he gave his coat, and consequently the necklace, to Rose; he later boards a lifeboat posing as a lost child's father.\n\nJack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and the ship's stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks. As passengers fall to their deaths, Jack and Rose desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section dives downward. The remaining stern slams back onto the ocean, then upends again before it, too, sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person and makes her promise to survive. Jack dies of [[hypothermia]], and Rose is saved by a returning lifeboat, keeping her promise.\n\nThe [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']] rescues the survivors; Rose avoids Cal by hiding among the steerage passengers and gives her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket. In the present, Rose says she later heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of ''Keldysh'', Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site.

She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered [[Titanic Lifeboat No. 6|Lifeboat 6]] from Quartermaster [[Robert Hichens (RMS Titanic)|Robert Hichens]].<ref name=\"SLB\">{{cite book|first=Stephanie L.|last=Barczewski|title=Titanic: A Night Remembered|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2004|access-date=March 31, 2009|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYX4s1_6IlEC&pg=PA30|isbn=978-1-85285-434-8|archive-date=January 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126014112/https://books.google.com/books?id=yYX4s1_6IlEC&pg=PA30|url-status=live}}</ref> Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film.\n* [[Victor Garber]] as [[Thomas Andrews]]: The ship's builder, Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the ''Titanic'', this story, which was published in a 1912 book (''Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder'') and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=\"seaofglass\">ON A SEA OF GLASS: THE LIFE & LOSS OF THE RMS TITANIC\" by Tad Fitch, J.

Andrews was last seen leaving the ship at the last moment.\n* [[Bernard Hill]] as [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain Edward John Smith]]: Smith planned to make the ''Titanic'' his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]] on the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] as the ship sinks, dying when the windows implode from the water whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".<ref>Ballard, pp. 40\u201341</ref>\n* [[Jonathan Hyde]] as [[J. Bruce Ismay]]: [[White Star Line]]'s ignorant, boorish managing director, who influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this action appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Beesley |first=Lawrence |title=The Loss of the S.S. Titanic |publisher=Heinemann |location=London, England |year=1912 |page=56}}</ref><ref>Howells (1999: 31).</ref> After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* [[Eric Braeden]] as [[John Jacob Astor IV]]: A first-class passenger whom Rose (correctly) calls the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine]] ([[Charlotte Chatton]]) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin|Chippewa Falls]] Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as [[Archibald Gracie IV|Colonel Archibald Gracie IV]]: The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox had portrayed [[Frederick Fleet]] in the 1958 film ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]''.\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as [[Benjamin Guggenheim]]: A mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\n[[File:Wallace Henry Harvey.jpg|148px|thumb|Wallace Hartley.

Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\n* [[Ewan Stewart]] as [[William McMaster Murdoch|First Officer William Murdoch]]: The officer who is put in charge of the bridge on the night the ship struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.<ref>{{cite news | title = Nephew angered by tarnishing of Titanic hero | work = BBC News | date = January 24, 1998 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/50203.stm | access-date = February 19, 2007 | archive-date = October 4, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171004222811/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/50203.stm | url-status = live }}</ref> A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to [[Dalbeattie]], Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a \u00a35000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.<ref>{{cite news | title = Titanic makers say sorry | work = BBC News | date = April 15, 1998 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/78839.stm | access-date = February 22, 2007 | archive-date = March 9, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180309052839/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/78839.stm | url-status = live }}</ref> Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the [[Women and children first|\"women and children first\" policy]].<ref name=\"commentary\">{{cite video | people = James Cameron | title = Audio Commentary |medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year= 2005}}</ref> According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today.

That says something about character and heroism.\"<ref>James Cameron's Titanic, p.&nbsp;129.</ref>\n* [[Jonathan Phillips (actor)|Jonathan Phillips]] as [[Charles Lightoller|Second Officer Charles Lightoller]]. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water, and following the collision, suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* [[Simon Crane]] as [[Joseph Boxhall|Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall]]: The officer in charge of firing flares and manning [[Lifeboats of the Titanic#Boat 2 (port)|Lifeboat 2]] during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Harold Lowe|Fifth Officer Harold Lowe]]: The ship's only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as [[James Paul Moody|Sixth Officer James Moody]]: The ship's only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following [[William McMaster Murdoch|Mr. Murdoch's]] orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as [[Thomas Byles|Father Thomas Byles]]: Second-class passenger Father Byles, a Catholic priest from England, is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* [[Lew Palter]] and [[Elsa Raven]] as [[Isidor Straus]] and [[Ida Straus]]: Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, his wife Ida is offered a place in a lifeboat, but refuses, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] as [[Cosmo Duff-Gordon|Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon]]: A Scottish baronet who is rescued in [[RMS Titanic Lifeboat No. 1|Lifeboat 1]]. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the ''Titanic'' was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The [[British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the Titanic|British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster]] accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.<ref>''British Wreck Commissioner's Enquiry: Report.'' \"Account of the Saving and Rescue of those who Survived: Conduct of Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and Mr Ismay\".

In order to sink the Grand Staircase, {{convert|90000|usgal|L}} of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The {{convert|744|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} exterior of the RMS ''Titanic'' had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a [[shock absorber]] against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's [[remotely operated vehicle|ROV]] traversing the wreck in the present.<ref name=\"heart\" /> The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a {{convert|350000|usgal|L|adj=mid}} tank,<ref name=\"water\">Marsh and Kirkland, pp. 161\u2013168</ref> where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.<ref name=\"blueprint\" />\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous ''Titanic'' films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".<ref name=\"www.media-awareness.ca\" /> When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts.

That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film,\" stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. \"The story of the ''Californian'' was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set,\" said Cameron. \"But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If ''Titanic'' is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\"<ref name=\"www.industrycentral.net\" />\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett's story. In the original version of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose then reveals that she had the \"Heart of the Ocean\" diamond all along but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal's money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep, whereupon the film ends in the same way as the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the ''Titanic''{{'s}} sinking.<ref>{{cite video | people = James Cameron | title = Alternate Ending Commentary | medium = DVD | publisher = 20th Century Fox |year = 2005}}</ref> Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary, stating that \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ...you didn't really need anything from us.

Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Just as they are about to escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the \"theft\" of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons.

Asprey & Garrard produced and designed the necklaces: the result was three different and unique designs. Two of their designs were used in the film while the other went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace, and the Asprey necklace. The three necklaces are all very similar but have distinguishable differences.\n\nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, [[Asprey & Garrard]] were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, {{convert|171|carat|g|adj=on}} heart-shaped Ceylon [[sapphire]] surrounded by 103 diamonds.<ref name=\"oocities\" /> This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart.

The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to [[Sotheby's]] auction house in [[Beverly Hills]] for an auction benefiting the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]] and Southern California's Aid For AIDS.

From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during ''Titanic'' will readily admit to becoming choked up during ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' or ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]].''\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion\".<ref name=\"Finlo Rohrer\" />\n\nScott Meslow of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' stated while ''Titanic'' initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing ''Titanic'' as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone\u2014including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', it is common for boys and men to deny liking ''Titanic''. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements\u2014the history, the romance, the action\u2014that made (and continues to make) ''Titanic'' an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"''Titanic'' has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe.
