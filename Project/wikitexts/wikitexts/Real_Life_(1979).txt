It is a [[Parody|spoof]] of the 1973 [[reality television]] program ''[[An American Family]]'' and portrays a documentary filmmaker named Albert Brooks who attempts to live with and film a [[dysfunctional family]] for one full year.\n\n[[Charles Grodin]] co-stars as the family's patriarch who allows cameras in his Arizona home. Real-life producer [[Jennings Lang]] also has an acting role in ''Real Life''.\n\n==Plot==\nComedian Albert Brooks (played by himself) leads a documentary film project meant to encapsulate the joys, sorrows and intimacy of real life by filming a regular American family at all times for a full year using expensive cameras: some installed on walls and four large helmet-like ones worn by a small camera crew that follows Brooks and the family in and out of their neighboring homes (a regular film crew is hired by the studio but aren\u2019t needed.)\n\nAfter countless testing, two families are declared \u2018\u2019perfect\u2019\u2019: the Feltons and the Yeagers. Brooks tells the audience that the Feltons are the clear pick because they live in Wisconsin and the Yeagers live in Arizona. The studio picks the Yeagers.\n\nThe Yeagers are sent on vacation and filming starts as soon as they arrive back at the airport, causing immediate nervousness in the family. Brooks takes an hour off to do antiquing while the Yeagers have pizza and argue about rules at the dinner table. The father, Warren, makes a few unsympathetic remarks and ends up eating alone.\n\nDoctors Howard Hill and Ted Cleary are there to observe the project\u2019s integrity and progress. Cleary does not appreciate Brooks\u2019 intrusive method of constantly filming the family, worrying that their hold of reality is being threatened.\n\nThe mother, Jeanette, leaves the house without cameras to unwind and\nmeets Brooks later to thank him by inviting him to an appointment at the gynecologist. Brooks is thrilled until Jeanette kisses him, which he dislikes. He warns her that he\u2019s no better than her husband and that his charisma \u2018\u2019doesn\u2019t run deep.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe gynecologist refuses to be on camera because of a damning news story that ran about him years ago.\nBrooks offers him $500 to accept but then recognizes the man as \u2018\u2019the baby broker\u2019\u2019 from the news story and the deal is off.\n\nWarren brings the crew to witness a day at his work as a veterinarian. Being nervous from the cameras, he starts surgery on a horse by accidentally ordering an anesthetic drug twice and killing the animal instantly. He asks Brooks to not show the footage in the film but Brooks won\u2019t sign off on that.\n\nJeannette\u2019s grandmother also dies and the family enters a deep depression. In trying to cheer the family up, Brooks invites Jeanette to a dinner date which she declines, having changed her mind on her attraction to him. Brooks then shows up to the house in a clown costume to cheer the kids but they are at school. While still in costume, Brooks is asked to sit down with Warren and Jeannette, where Warren confesses to feeling a nervous breakdown. Brooks is dismissive of the claim, saying that it\u2019s okay to be sad and confused as long as you don\u2019t \u2018\u2019clam up\u2019\u2019.\n\nAfter a meeting with the doctors, some scientists from the institute and an old-timey film producer obsessed with getting movie stars involved, Dr. Cleary leaves the project, disapproving of how the family is being treated. The family return to a happier, more harmonious lifestyle until Cleary\u2019s book on the project is published, calling it \u2018\u2019mind-control\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019psychological rape\u2019\u2019. The book attracts attention on the family from newscasters, much to the anger of Brooks and the discomfort of the Yeagers.\n\nAnother meeting with Dr. Hill, the institute and the film producer calls for the termination of the project. Brooks brings the Yeagers to the meeting and, to his surprise, they also want to end the project. Despite his pleas and threats for them to stay, they do not change their minds and the producer calls for the Yeagers to be paid anyway to apologize for the stress they endured. Brooks suggests to start the project over with the Feltons back in Wisconsin but is turned down by the producer.\n\nWhile dressing back into the clown costume for a benefit at a children\u2019s hospital, Brooks starts losing his mind over the project. In a desperate attempt to find a solid ending to the film, Brooks recalls the endings of famous films and picks ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' as the one he should copy. He burns down the Yeagers\u2019 house with elation in front of them, the camera crew and the scientists. No one is harmed.\n\nAn epilogue is presented in text form saying that the house was rebuilt with a tennis court added for \u2018appreciation\u2019, that Dr. Cleary\u2019s book sold poorly and he is now ill. Real-life historians are invited to call 1-800-555-3824, should they want documentation on the project.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Albert Brooks\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as  Warren Yeager\n* [[Frances Lee McCain]] as Jeannette Yeager\n* [[J.A.

An idea is not enough for a movie. Characters have to be developed, comic situations have to be set up before they can pay off and the story should have a conclusion instead of a dead stop. 'Real Life' fails in all of those areas \u2014 fails so miserably that it lets its audiences down.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/real-life-1979 |title=Real Life |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=March 23, 1979 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |publisher= |accessdate=May 22, 2019 }}</ref> Conversely, [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the film as an \"often very funny assault on manners, moviemaking, an allegedly typical American family and everything its members hold dear ... Its manner is deadpan and sly, so sly that some viewers may not find it comic at all. But for anyone well-disposed toward Mr. Brooks, who is never without his absolute insincerity and irrational good cheer, 'Real Life' is full of delightful nonsense, a very funny account of one man's crusade to capture all the truth and wisdom that money can buy.\"<ref>Maslin, Janet (March 2, 1979).

C12.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted, \"Expanding on the deadpan satiric tone of the short parodies and pseudo-documentaries he's filmed in the past for NBC's '[[Saturday Night Live]]' into his first feature, Albert Brooks has come up with a mostly very funny (though uneven) take-off on social-minded docu filmmaking that stands to draw boxoffice support from the young adult, primarily college crowd that's made the late-night tv show the success it is.\"<ref>\"Film Reviews: Real Life\".

It feels like a 30-minute gag stretched to fill a feature film, and the repetitiousness of the situation gets wearisome.
