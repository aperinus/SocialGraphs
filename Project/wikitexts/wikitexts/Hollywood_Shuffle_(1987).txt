The film tracks the attempts of Bobby Taylor to become a successful actor and the mental and external roadblocks he encounters, represented through a series of interspersed vignettes and fantasies.  Produced, directed, and co-written by [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]], the film is semi-autobiographical, reflecting Townsend's experiences as a black actor when he was told he was not \"black enough\" for certain roles.<ref>Scheer, Laurie. \"The Eighties and Nineties.\" Creative Careers in Hollywood. New York: Allworth, 2002. 33. Print.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBobby Taylor is a young black man aspiring to become an actor.  His younger brother Stevie watches him prepare to audition for a part in ''Jivetime Jimmy's Revenge'', a movie about street gangs which is so full of stereotypes that the light-skinned black actors who audition are cast as [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] gang members and have to speak with cartoonish [[Spanish language|Spanish]] accents. Bobby's grandmother overhears the \"[[jive talk]]\" of Bobby's lines and expresses disapproval. His mother is more supportive, but Bobby's grandmother says that if he desires a respectable job, there is honest work at the post office. Bobby assures his mother that if he lands the part, their lives will change for the better.\n\nAfter the audition, Bobby talks to Mr. Jones, who questions Bobby's dedication to his job at Jones's restaurant, Winky Dinky Dog, because Bobby frequently misses work so he can attend auditions and casting calls. A limousine arrives, and its passenger is B. B. Sanders, a famous actor who plays a stereotypical black comedy character, Batty Boy, in the popular television sitcom ''There's a Bat in My House''. Ecstatic to meet a potential role model, Bobby asks Sanders how to determine if a role is worth taking. Sanders says if Bobby's character does not die, then \"it's a good script.\" He tells Bobby that acting is not about art, but making money through [[sequel]]s, merchandising, etc.\n\nBobby's agent calls to say his audition went well, and he got a [[Audition#Musical theatre|callback]], but the producers want an \"[[Eddie Murphy]]-type\". That night, he has a nightmare in which the director, writer, and casting director hound him to become Eddie Murphy. Waiting in line with a group of Eddie Murphy clones, Bobby starts turning into Eddie Murphy himself and then wakes up in shock.\n\nThe next day, Bobby's restaurant co-workers, Donald and Tiny, tell him he will never succeed as an actor, so Bobby quits Winky Dinky Dog.  Later that night, he visits his uncle Ray, a singer who gave up a chance at stardom to take a \"real\" job and provide for his family. Bobby expresses doubts about pursuing acting, but Ray encourages Bobby to follow his dreams. During his callback, the director, writer, and casting director are thrilled at Bobby's performance, and he wins the lead role.\n\nAfter getting the part, Bobby begins to experience attacks of conscience that manifest as daydreams based on what people around him are saying or doing, including one (\"Black Acting School\") where white coaches teach black performers how to act \"more black\", and one (\"Sneaking Into the Movies\") where two young black men gain entry to a theater without paying and review films that spoof popular titles \u00e0 la ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'', including ''Amadeus Meets Salieri'', ''Chicago Jones and the Temple of Doom'', ''Dirty Larry'', and ''Attack of the Street Pimps''.\n\nAt home, Bobby is celebrating with his girlfriend Lydia when his grandmother arrives. The three of them watch a [[film noir]], which causes Bobby to fantasize about playing the lead in his own film noir, ''Death of a [[breakdancing|Breakdancer]]''. That night, Bobby dreams of the roles that he wants to play, from a [[Shakespearean]] king, to a black superhero, to a black version of [[John Rambo|Rambo]] (\"Rambro\"). His final dream depicts him winning his fifth [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]. The next day, Bobby starts filming ''Jivetime Jimmy's Revenge'' with his family in attendance. His guilt about playing a stereotypical character finally overwhelms him, and Bobby quits. Another cast member who previously complained about the stereotypical film hypocritically takes over Bobby's part, but Bobby and his family leave the set with their pride intact.\n\nIn the closing scene, Bobby is completing preparations on a different set for an on-camera scene that is about to begin. In an echo of his grandmother's earlier admonition, ''Hollywood Shuffle'' ends with Bobby filming a TV [[public service announcement|PSA]] for the [[US Postal Service]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]] as Bobby Taylor, an aspiring young black actor who dreams of making it big in Hollywood.
