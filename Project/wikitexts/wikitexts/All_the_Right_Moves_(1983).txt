He is seeking a [[college football]] [[Athletic scholarship|scholarship]] to escape the economically depressed small [[Western Pennsylvania]] town of Ampipe and a dead-end job and life working at the mill, just like his father and brother Greg. He dreams of becoming an electrical engineer right after he graduates from college. Ampipe is a [[company town]] whose economy is dominated by the town's main employer, American Pipe & Steel, a steel mill struggling through the downturn of the [[early 1980s recession]]. Stef gets through his days with the love of his girlfriend, Lisa Lietzke, and his strong bond with his teammates.\n\nIn the big football game against the undefeated Walnut Heights High School, Ampipe appears headed to win the game, when a fumbled handoff in the closing seconds\u2014as well as Stefen's [[pass interference]] penalty earlier in the game\u2014lead to Walnut Heights' victory. Following the game, Coach Vern Nickerson lambastes the fumbler in the locker room, telling him he \"quit\" the game. When Stefen retorts that the coach himself quit, the coach kicks him off the team.\n\nIn the aftermath, disgruntled Ampipe fans vandalize Coach Nickerson's house and yard. Stefen is present and is a reluctant participant, but is nonetheless spotted by Nickerson as the vandals flee. From there, Stefen deals with personal battles, including dealing with the coach [[blackballing]] him among colleges because of his attitude and participation in the vandalism. Stefen gets in an argument with Lisa, and his best friend Brian declines a scholarship offer to [[University of Southern California|USC]] and plans to marry his pregnant girlfriend.\n\nFrustrated by what Nickerson did, Stefen angrily confronts his former coach which ends in a shouting match out in the street. Lisa decides to talk to Nickerson's wife to try to help. Nickerson realizes he was wrong for blackballing Stefen. He has accepted a coaching position on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] at [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]] and offers Stefen a full scholarship to play football there, which he accepts.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Stefen Djordjevic\n* [[Craig T.
