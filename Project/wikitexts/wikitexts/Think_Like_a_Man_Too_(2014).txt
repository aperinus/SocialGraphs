It is the [[sequel]] to the 2012 film ''[[Think Like a Man]]'', based on [[Steve Harvey]]'s book ''[[Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man]]''. The script was written by David A. Newman and Keith Merryman, with [[Will Packer]] returning as producer but now under his [[Will Packer Productions]] banner. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Michael Ealy]], [[Meagan Good]], [[Regina Hall]], [[Terrence J]], [[Taraji P. Henson]], [[Romany Malco]], [[Gabrielle Union]], [[Jerry Ferrara]], [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]], [[Gary Owen (comedian)|Gary Owen]] and [[Kevin Hart]], with [[Jenifer Lewis|Jennifer Lewis]] and [[La La Anthony]] in supporting roles.\n\n''Think Like a Man Too'' was released on June 20, 2014, by [[Screen Gems]].<ref name=\"date\">{{cite news|title=Production starts on 'Think Like a Man Too'|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2013/05/28/Production-starts-on-Think-Like-a-Man-Too/UPI-48371369775541/|accessdate=18 June 2013|newspaper=upi.com|date=28 May 2013}}</ref> It grossed $70.2 million against a $24 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\nCedric ([[Kevin Hart]]) and his friends are all in Las Vegas for the wedding of Michael ([[Terrence J]]) and Candace ([[Regina Hall]]), with her son Duke (Caleel Harris) and mother (Angela Gibbs) joining them. Zeke ([[Romany Malco]]) and Mya ([[Meagan Good]]) arrive, with Zeke's womanizing past constantly being brought up by old friends and former flames, including the [[concierge]] at the hotel, who throws her drink in his face. Bennett ([[Gary Owen (comedian)|Gary Owen]]) and his wife Tish ([[Wendi McLendon-Covey]]) are trying to get a spark back in their marriage. Jeremy ([[Jerry Ferrara]]) and Kristen ([[Gabrielle Union]]) have married and are now trying for a baby. Dominic ([[Michael Ealy]]) and Lauren ([[Taraji P. Henson]]) are reunited after spending time away from each other, and they make out in the limousine. Finally, Cedric arrives at the hotel in a gaudy sports car, happily getting away from his wife Gail ([[Wendy Williams]]).\n\nMichael's overbearing mother Loretta ([[Jenifer Lewis]]) doesn't approve of his engagement to Candace, still thinking no woman is good enough for her son. Loretta even takes over the bachelorette party duties, even though Lauren is the maid of honor. The women have a party for Candace, until Loretta makes up her own party.\n\nAmong other problems plaguing the couples include Lauren being called by her boss Lee ([[Kelsey Grammer]]), who tells her she is being considered for a [[Chief operating officer|COO]] position in New York, meaning she will be separated from Dominic. Kristen tries to get Jeremy to have sex with her by roleplaying \"[[Game of Thrones]]\" characters, but Jeremy has reservations about becoming a father. Mya is ready to marry Zeke, but Zeke shows hesitation.\n\nWhile the ladies have to deal with Loretta, Lauren and Candace conspire to set her up with Candace's Uncle Eddie. Loretta takes the ladies out to dinner, and later plans to take Candace to see [[Dionne Warwick]]. Uncle Eddie ([[Dennis Haysbert]]) shows up and begins flirting with Loretta. The ladies leave to see Dionne Warwick together. The guys run into Michael's old frat brothers Isaac ([[Adam Brody]]) and Terrell ([[David Walton (actor)|David Walton]]), who just want to party.\n\nThe ladies gives Tish a makeover. They then go to the club, forcing the guys to either take a Chippendale-type bus, or walk. They choose the latter\n\nCedric finds himself in trouble when Gail finds out that he's been using her card to pay for his expenses, running her up to $40,000 in charges. He tries to win it back at the casino, putting it all on his \"lucky number\" 15. While his back turned, Zeke pulls the chips away to leave only one to spare Cedric the loss. However, the ball does land on 15, and Cedric is angry at Zeke.\nAs a last resort, Cedric takes the guys to the club (the same one the ladies are at) for amateur's night, dressing in various costumes to try and win some money. This, however, turns into a disaster when Michael sees Candace getting a lap dance; he charges to attack the dancer, leading to an all-out fight between the guys, the ladies, and the dancers. They are all put in jail for the night.\n\nRealizing that the wedding is in a few hours, they all try to call someone for help, but with no luck: Loretta is busy spending the night with Eddie in her room; Gail is already shacking up with [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] (who appears as himself); Bennett's mother has gone to pick up his kid. Jeremy sees the way he talks to his child, and is influenced to become a father. The guys blame Cedric for getting them into this mess.\n\nJeremy decides that he's finally committed to being a father, and Kristen reveals she might be pregnant (though she claims to be a week late), bringing the two closer. Zeke apologizes to Mya for everything that's been going on, and finally proposes to her; Mya accepts.\n\nLoretta is unable to find Michael and looks for him in him and Candace's room and tries getting rid of Candace. Michael overhears her and confronts her, declaring that he will marry Candace whether she likes it or not, and that she will no longer be invited to the wedding. Candace disagrees with Michael, saying that he needs to apologize to Loretta, because as a mother herself, she would be heartbroken if her own son did not let her go to his wedding. Loretta apologizes, and the three reconcile.\n\nCedric packs his bags to leave Vegas; however, with the help of his personal butler, Declan (Jim Piddock), he finds another venue. Candace and Michael are married, and everybody celebrates.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Cedric Ward\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Candace Hall\n* [[Michael Ealy]] as Dominic\n* [[Jerry Ferrara]] as Jeremy Kern\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Mya\n* [[Taraji P.
