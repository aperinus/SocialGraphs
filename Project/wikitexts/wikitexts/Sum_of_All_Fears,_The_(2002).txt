The film, which is set in the [[Jack Ryan (film series)|''Jack Ryan'' film series]], is a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] taking place in 2002. [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan]] is portrayed as a younger character by [[Ben Affleck]], in comparison with the previous films: ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990) starring [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jack Ryan and the sequels, ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'' (1992) and ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1994), both starring [[Harrison Ford]] in the role.\n\nAn Austrian Neo-Nazi plans to trigger a [[nuclear war]] between the United States and Russia, so that he can establish a fascist superstate in Europe. After the Neo-Nazi's scientists build a secret nuclear weapon that destroys [[Baltimore]], and a rogue Russian officer paid off by the Neo-Nazi attacks a U.S. aircraft carrier, the world's superpowers are pushed close to the brink of war. CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Affleck) is the only person who realizes that the Baltimore bomb was a black market weapon, not a Russian one. With the clock ticking, Ryan has to find a way to stop the impending nuclear war.\n\nThe film was a [[International co-production|co-production]] between the motion picture studios of [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Mace Neufeld|Mace Neufeld Productions]], MFP Munich Film Partners, and S.O.A.F. Productions. On June 4, 2002, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the [[Elektra Records]] music label. The soundtrack was composed and orchestrated by musician [[Jerry Goldsmith]]. The movie premiered in theaters in the United States on May 31, 2002.\n\n''The Sum of All Fears'' received generally mixed reviews from critics. It is considered a major financial success, having a worldwide theatrical run of $193.9&nbsp;million compared to its production budget of $68&nbsp;million and related marketing costs.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]], an Israeli warplane carrying a nuclear bomb is shot down, falling into the [[Golan Heights]], where the bomb gets buried in the desert. In 2002, a Syrian scrap collector uncovers the bomb buried in a field in the Golan Heights. He sells it to a South African [[black market]] arms trafficker named Olson, who recognizes it as a nuclear bomb. He then sells it to a neo-Nazi group led by Austrian billionaire Richard Dressler, whose aim is to start a war between the United States and Russia that will devastate them both, and leave a united fascist Europe to rule the world.\n\nJust prior to this, in the United States, [[President of the United States|President]] Robert Fowler and his national security team, including [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] William Cabot, stage a war game scenario where [[President of the Russian Federation|Russian President]] Zorkin is overthrown in a coup and rogue generals launch a nuclear attack on the Americans. Shortly after the drill, Zorkin dies of a heart attack and is rapidly replaced by a seeming hardliner supported by the military, Alexander Nemerov.\n\n[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]], who has studied Nemerov and believes him to be a reformer who merely talks like a hardliner to gain their support, is summoned by Cabot to accompany him to Moscow to inspect the top Russian nuclear weapons facility, in compliance with the [[START I|START treaty]]. At the [[Kremlin]], they meet Nemerov and his personal aide, former [[KGB]] agent Anatoly Grushkov.  Nemerov requests they deliver a personal message to Fowler, asking him and the US to remain out of Russia's [[Second Chechen War|war in Chechnya]] and let Nemerov stabilize Russia in his own way. During their investigation of the weapons facility, Ryan notices the absence of three scientists listed on the facility's roster; Grushkov assures them the scientists are merely unavailable. After receiving reliable intelligence from a confidential secure informant (codenamed \"Spinnaker\u201c) inside the Kremlin disputing Grushkov's assessment, Cabot sends operative [[John Clark (Tom Clancy character)|John Clark]] to Russia to investigate.\n\nTensions between the United States and Russia increase when a chemical attack on [[Grozny]], the capital of [[Chechnya]], is reported during the [[White House Correspondents' Association#White House Correspondents' Dinner|White House Correspondents' Dinner]]. Ryan tries to defend Nemerov by indicating that rogue military commanders could have ordered the attack instead, but his theory is disproved when Nemerov delivers a speech to the [[State Duma]] taking responsibility for the attack. In response, Fowler deploys peacekeepers to Chechnya. In Russia, Grushkov informs Nemerov that disgruntled Communist officers ordered the attack on Grozny, and Nemerov orders them removed from command, choosing to take the blame for Grozny rather than risk alienating more figures of his military.\n\nClark tracks the missing scientists to a former Soviet military facility in Ukraine, where Cabot suspects they are building a secret nuclear weapon that Russia could use without any method to trace it back to them. Ryan and his colleagues discern that a crate from the facility in Ukraine was flown to the [[Canary Islands]], then sent to [[Baltimore]] on a cargo ship. Ryan warns Cabot, who is attending a football game in the city with Fowler, about a bomb threat. Thanks to Ryan's warning, Cabot evacuates the president fast enough to get him out of the stadium before the detonation, but not fast enough for the motorcade to escape the bomb's shock wave. The stadium is destroyed, though Fowler is evacuated by the Marines; Cabot is mortally wounded and left behind. Gathering his national security team aboard [[Boeing E-4|a Boeing E-4]], they conduct a real-life situation similar to the film's beginning but with far more confusion and heightened emotions from all those involved. \nIn Russia, President Nemerov desperately tries to defuse the situation over the [[Moscow\u2013Washington hotline|hotline]], but must face American assurance of Russian culpability and his own generals' desire to attack the US.\n\nImmediately thereafter, a corrupt [[Russian Air Force]] general who has been bribed by Dressler sends warplanes to successfully attack a U.S. aircraft carrier, heavily damaging it; this further exacerbates tensions between Russia and the United States. On the scene of the blast in Baltimore, Ryan learns from a radiation assessment team that the [[isotopic signature]] from the nuclear blast indicates it was manufactured in the [[United States Department of Energy]]'s [[Savannah River Site]], evidence which apparently exonerates Russia. Ryan finds the injured Cabot, who before dying tells him to contact Spinnaker, his source in the Russian government.  Using Cabot's recovered phone, Ryan contacts Spinnaker, who informs Ryan that the uranium was produced in an American facility and was stolen by the CIA in order to be secretly given to Israel (who subsequently lost it during the Yom Kippur War). Ryan tries to get a warning to President Fowler by phone, but is blocked by one of the President's team.  In Syria, Clark tracks down Ghazi, one of the men who found the bomb, now dying of radiation exposure. He tells Clark that he sold the bomb to Olson, who lives in [[Damascus]]. Ryan's colleagues at [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|Langley]] infiltrate Olson's computer and download files that implicate Dressler as the person who bought the plutonium and who is behind the nuclear attack.\n\nRyan is able to reach the [[National Military Command Center]] in [[the Pentagon]] using Cabot's ID, and manages to get a message to Nemerov, using the personal rapport they had developed when they had met in Moscow and saying that he knows that Russia was not behind the attack. He asks Nemerov to stand down his forces as a show of good faith. Nemerov agrees to do so and Fowler follows suit. As Nemerov and Fowler sign an agreement to counter [[nuclear proliferation]] at the [[Kremlin]], the participants in the conspiracy are tracked and assassinated: Clark sneaks into Olson's home in [[Damascus]] and slits his throat with a K-Bar knife.  Russian agents chase the corrupt Russian general through snow covered woods and gun him down.  Dressler, knowing he is being targeted as well, forces his aide to start his car.   The car starts normally, to Dressler's relief.  However, Grushkov knew Dressler liked to smoke in his car and had wired the car bomb to be detonated by the car's cigarette lighter as opposed to the ignition.  As a result, Dressler is blown up when he presses the cigarette lighter button.\n\nLater, Fowler and Nemerov deliver joint speeches about their new initiatives and honoring the dead at the [[White House]], as Ryan and his now fianc\u00e9e Dr. Catherine Muller listen in. Grushkov, revealing himself to be Spinnaker, arrives and offers to continue the arrangement he had with Cabot with Ryan, to ensure the back channels between Russia and the United States always remain open. He also gives Catherine a present for their engagement, which they notably had not yet announced to anyone. When Ryan asks him how he could have known, Grushkov merely shrugs, smiles and walks away.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ben Affleck by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Affleck, the third actor in the [[Jack Ryan (film series)|film series]] to portray the character of [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]]]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as [[Jack Ryan (character)|Jack Ryan]]\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as William 'Bill' Cabot, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency\n* [[Bridget Moynahan]] as Dr.Cathy Mueller\n* [[James Cromwell]] as J.

Noting these substantial changes, in the [[commentary track]] on the DVD release, Tom Clancy jokingly introduced himself as \"the author of the book that he [director Phil Alden Robinson, who is present with Clancy] ignored\" and spending most of the commentary poking fun at the film's factual inaccuracies and differences from the source material.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Sum of All Fears \u2013 IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/18/the-sum-of-all-fears|language=en|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref> Perhaps the largest change were the original terrorists. In the novel, they were [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalists]], but in the film, they were changed to neo-Nazis. A common misconception is that this was done as a reaction to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], but the movie finished filming in June 2001.\n\nOn the \"making-of\" DVD extra, director Alden Robinson said that the change was purely for elements relating to the plot, because Arab terrorists would not be able to plausibly accomplish all that was necessary for the story to work. In addition, the terrorists in the book received significant aid from elements in [[East Germany]], a country which had [[German reunification|ceased to exist]] before the novel was even published. The group [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) did mount a two-year lobbying campaign that ended on January 26, 2001, against using \"Muslim villains\", as the original book version did.<ref>{{cite web|last=Armstrong|first=Mark|title=Wolf Howls As NBC Yanks \"Law & Order\" Episode|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/41074/wolf-howls-as-nbc-yanks-law-order-episode|publisher=[[E!
