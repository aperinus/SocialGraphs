The film is a remake of the 1965 [[The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)|film of the same name]], both based on the 1964 novel ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix (novel)|The Flight of the Phoenix]]'', by [[Elleston Trevor]], about a group of people who survive an aircraft crash in the [[Gobi Desert]] and must build a new aircraft out of the old one to escape. It stars [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Giovanni Ribisi]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Miranda Otto]] and [[Hugh Laurie]].\n\n''Flight of the Phoenix'' was filmed on location in the [[Namib|Namib Desert]], and was released in the United States on December 17, 2004, by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]], and received generally mixed reviews; criticism was geared toward its similarity to the 1965 film, while praise related to the acting, direction and visuals.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nWhen an Amacore [[Drilling rig|oil rig]] in the [[Gobi Desert]] of [[Mongolia]] proves unproductive, Captain Frank Towns and co-pilot A.J. are sent to shut down the operation and transport the crew (Amacore executive Ian, rig supervisor Kelly, Rodney, Davis, Liddle, Jeremy, Sammi, Rady, Kyle, Newman, and Dr. Gerber) out of the desert.  However, en route to [[Beijing]], a major [[dust storm]] disables one engine, forcing them to crash land their [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar|C-119 Flying Boxcar]] in an uncharted area of the [[Gobi Desert]]. Kyle falls to his death and the crash kills Dr. Gerber and Newman. Their cargo consists of used parts and tools from the rig, the rig's crew, and Elliot, a hitchhiker.  When the dust storm ends, it becomes apparent that they are {{convert|200|mi}} off course with only a month's supply of water. Jeremy thinks about walking to get help, but Rady explains that July is the hottest month in the Gobi, and that he won't make it.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Davis goes out to urinate without informing anybody, trips, gets lost in a sandstorm, and dies. The group panics after a failed search for him, and Kelly argues with Frank, who says that walking out of the desert would fail and that their only option is to await rescue. The group initially agrees but reconsiders after Elliot, claiming to be an aeronautical engineer, pitches a radical idea: rebuild the wreckage of their C-119 into a functional aircraft. Frank initially refuses, which causes Liddle to wander off on his own in protest. Frank attempts to find him. He comes across a valley littered with debris, cargo from the aircraft, which dropped out when the tail was torn open. Among the debris he discovers the bullet-ridden and stripped body of Kyle. Liddle says he will only go back with him if they build the plane, and Frank agrees.\n\nThey struggle for several weeks building the new aircraft, through dust storms, lack of water, and fighting amongst the group. Rady christens it ''Phoenix'' after the [[Phoenix (mythology)|legendary bird]]. A problem evolves when a group of smugglers camp nearby; when Ian, A.J., and Rodney attempt to communicate, the bandits kill Rodney and try to kill the group to prevent them from exposing their smuggling operations, but they are killed in a short, fierce skirmish when ambushed by Frank. Later, it is revealed that Elliot's aircraft design experience has been restricted to the design of model aircraft, much to the anger of everyone, especially Ian, who threatens to shoot Elliot. However, they eventually are able to construct the new aircraft and take off, barely in time to escape a larger group of bandits seeking revenge for the murdered smugglers.\n\nThrough a series of photos, we see what became of the survivors when they made it back to civilization. All have been revitalized by the experience and have happy lives: Frank and A.J. start their own airline (appropriately named Phoenix Aviation), Sammi and his wife start their own restaurant (Jeremy and Rady are there to celebrate), Liddle is reunited with his wife and kids, Ian becomes a professional golfer, Kelly is boss on an ocean oil rig, and Elliot is wearing a flight suit on a ''[[Flight International]]'' magazine cover with the headline: \"[[NASA]]'s New Hope?\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Captain Franklin \"Frank\" Towns\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Elliot\n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as A.J.\n* [[Miranda Otto]] as Kelly Johnson\n* [[Tony Curran]] as Alex Rodney\n* [[Hugh Laurie]] as Ian\n* [[Scott Michael Campbell]] as James Liddle\n* [[Sticky Fingaz]] as Jeremy\n* [[Jacob Vargas]] as Sammi\n* [[Kevork Malikyan]] as Rady\n* [[Jared Padalecki]] as John Davis\n* Paul Ditchfield as Dr. Gerber\n* Martin Hindy as Newman\n* Bob Brown as Kyle\n* [[Anthony Brandon Wong|Anthony Wong]] as Lead Smuggler\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCo-writer [[Edward Burns]] was personally asked by [[Tom Rothman]], who at the time was the president of Fox and had discovered Burns when he bought ''[[The Brothers McMullen]]'' as Fox Searchlight's first acquisition, to rewrite the film's dialogue.
