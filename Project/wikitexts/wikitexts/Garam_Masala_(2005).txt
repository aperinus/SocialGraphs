Kumar's performance received critical acclaim and earned him the Best Actor in a Comic Role award at the [[Filmfare Awards]]. Over time, the film has gained a [[cult film|cult following]] and has been regarded as one of the best Hindi films in the comic genre.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts off when two photographers Makarand \"Mac\" Godbole  and Shyam \"Sam\" Salgaonkar are doing a photo shoot. While Mac is shooting the models in exposing poses, his fianc\u00e9e Anjali  leaves in disgust due to Mac's closeness to the models. Their boss calls them into his office and tells them that they are good-for-nothing photographers. He threatens to reduce their pay if they don't get some good pictures for the world photography competition to make his magazine ''Garam Masala'' famous.\n\nBoth Mac and Sam ask Maggie, the boss's secretary, on a date on the same day, at the same restaurant at the same time. As all three meet up at the restaurant a pickpocket takes Mac's and Sam's wallets. After the meal, the competition to impress Maggie heightens thus evoking humorous events after which Sam and Mac leave Maggie to pay the bill.\n\nSam visits a famous photographer, praising him and asking for a few outstanding shots. These stolen shots help Sam to win the world photography competition. He gets promoted, is given ten percent of the prize money and has his pay doubled, whilst Mac receives a demotion to assistant. Sam flies off to the US to enjoy his holiday, leaving Mac fuming in Mauritius.\n\nThe chief editor persuades Mac to show up Sam by getting three women to be his fianc\u00e9es, getting a very expensive flat and driving very expensive, imported cars. Following his promise, Mac gets a high-quality flat and gets access to three beautiful air hostesses. His driver, Babban, is his key to the high life. Not only does Babban get Mac access to the flat, he delivers very high-end cars to impress his fianc\u00e9es. He drives Mac's cars and does all his services for a small amount of liquor every day. Lastly, Babban gets Mac a housekeeper, Mambo, who has an attitude problem and doesn't care what goes on in his flat so long as his demands are met.\n\nHe has affairs with each of the three women \u2014 Deepti, Puja  and Sweety \u2014 and creates chaos. Sam returns from America, only to find his friend turned rival, playing around with three women at once. He tries to help his friend and tries out his own luck with the girls.\n\nThe story turns into mayhem when it's hard for the two boys to maintain the three girls simultaneously. Mac's original fianc\u00e9e Anjali learns about Mac's acts, and it creates a bigger mess. When their cook Mambo leaves, they begin to realise their mistakes and Mac attempts reuniting with Anjali; in the end Mac tries to climb on the car which Anjali and Sam are in while being chased by the three women he was dating now that they realised the truth.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] <small>as</small> Makrand \"Mac\" Godbole\n* [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]] <small>as</small> Shyam \"Sam\" Salgaonkar\n* [[Paresh Rawal]] <small>as</small> Mambo\n* [[Rimi Sen]] <small>as</small> Anjali, Mac's real fianc\u00e9e and to-be wife \n* [[Neha Dhupia]] <small>as</small> Maggie          \n* [[Daisy Bopanna]] <small>as</small> Deepti, an airhostess, Mac's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Neetu Chandra]] <small>as</small> Sweety Nair, an airhostess, Mac's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Nargis Bagheri]] <small>as</small> Puja, an airhostess, Mac's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Rajpal Yadav]] <small>as</small> Babban\n* [[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] <small>as</small> Nageshwar\n* [[Asrani]] <small>as</small> Mamu, Mac's maternal uncle\n* [[Viju Khote]] <small>as</small> Mac & Sam's Boss\n* [[Prithvi Zutshi]] <small>as</small> Landlord Padgaonkar\n\n==Box office==\nMade on a budget of {{INR}}170&nbsp;million, the film grossed {{INR}}546.5&nbsp;million in its theatrical run.<ref name=\"Box\"/>\n\n== Awards ==\n\n; [[51st Filmfare Awards]]<nowiki>:</nowiki>\n\n'''Won'''\n\n* [[Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role|Best Comedian]] \u2013 [[Akshay Kumar]]\n==Release==\nThe film was theatrically released on 2 November 2005.{{cn|date=August 2022}} The distribution rights of the movie were acquired by [[Disney India]].
