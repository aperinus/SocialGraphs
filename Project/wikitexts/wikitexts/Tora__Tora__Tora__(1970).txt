({{lang-ja|\u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30c8\u30e9\u30fb\u30c8\u30e9\uff01}}) is a 1970 [[epic film|epic]] [[war film]] that dramatizes the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941. The film was produced by [[Elmo Williams]] and directed by [[Richard Fleischer]]<!--The Japanese segments form a significant portion of the film:-->, [[Toshio Masuda (director)|Toshio Masuda]] and [[Kinji Fukasaku]], and stars an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Martin Balsam]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[So Yamamura]], [[E. G. Marshall|E.G. Marshall]], [[James Whitmore]], [[Tatsuya Mihashi]], [[Takahiro Tamura]], [[Wesley Addy]], and [[Jason Robards]]. It was Masuda and Fukasaku's first English-language film, and first international co-production. The ''tora'' of the title is the two-syllable [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[Code name|codeword]] used to indicate that complete surprise had been achieved.\n\nThe film was released in the United States by [[Twentieth Century Fox]] on September 23, 1970, and in Japan by the [[Toei Company]] on September 25. It received mixed reviews from American critics, but was praised for its historical accuracy and attention to detail, its visual effects, and its action sequences.<ref name=\"Aviation Great films\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> A 1994 survey at the [[USS Arizona Memorial|USS ''Arizona'' Memorial]] determined that for Americans the film was the most common source of popular knowledge about the Pearl Harbor attack.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n''Tora!

Influential [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] figures and politicians push through an [[Tripartite Pact|alliance with Germany and Italy]] in September 1940 despite opposition from the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese navy]] and prepare for war. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the [[Japanese Combined Fleet|Combined Fleet]], [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]], reluctantly plans a pre-emptive strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet anchored at [[Pearl Harbor]], believing that Japan's best hope of controlling the [[Pacific Ocean]] is to quickly annihilate the American fleet. Air Staff Officer [[Minoru Genda]] is chosen to mastermind the operation while his old Naval Academy classmate [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] is selected to lead the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, U.S. military intelligence has broken the Japanese ''[[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple Code]]'', allowing them to intercept secret Japanese radio transmissions indicating increased Japanese naval activity. Monitoring the transmissions are U.S. Army Col. Bratton and U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Kramer. At Pearl Harbor itself, Admiral Kimmel increases defensive naval and air patrols around Hawaii which could provide early warning of enemy presence. General Short recommends concentrating aircraft at the base on the runways to avoid sabotage by enemy agents in Hawaii, so General Howard Davidson of the 14th Pursuit Wing tries dispersing some of the planes to other airfields on Oahu to maintain air readiness.\n\nSeveral months pass while diplomatic tensions escalate. As the Japanese ambassador to Washington continues negotiations to stall for time, the large Japanese fleet sorties into the Pacific. On the day of the attack, Bratton and Kramer learn from intercepts that the Japanese plan a series of 14 radio messages from Tokyo to the Japanese embassy in Washington. They are also directed to destroy their code machines after receiving the final message. Deducing the Japanese intention to launch a surprise attack immediately after the messages are delivered, Bratton tries warning his superiors of his suspicions but encounters several obstacles: Chief of Naval Operations [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Harold R. Stark]] is indecisive over notifying Hawaii without first alerting the President while Army Chief of Staff General [[George Marshall]]'s order that Pearl Harbor be alerted of an impending attack is stymied by poor atmospherics that prevent radio transmission and by bungling when a warning sent by telegram is not marked urgent. At dawn on December 7, the Japanese fleet launches its aircraft. Their approach to Hawaii is detected by two radar operators but their concerns are dismissed by the duty officer. Similarly the claim by the destroyer [[USS Ward]] to have sunk a Japanese miniature submarine off the entrance to Pearl Harbor is dismissed as unimportant. The Japanese thus achieve complete and total surprise and Commander Fuchida sends the code to begin the attack: \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\"\n\nThe damage to the naval base is catastrophic and casualties are severe. Seven battleships are either sunk or heavily damaged. General Short's anti-sabotage precautions prove a disastrous mistake that allows the Japanese aerial forces to destroy aircraft on the ground easily. Hours after the attack ends, General Short and Admiral Kimmel receive Marshall's telegram warning of impending danger. In Washington, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]] is stunned to learn of the attack and urgently requests confirmation before receiving the Japanese ambassador. The message that was transmitted to the Japanese embassy in 14 parts \u2013 a declaration of war \u2013 was meant to be delivered to the Americans at 1:00 pm in Washington, 30 minutes before the attack. However, it was not decoded and transcribed in time, meaning the attack started while the two nations were technically still at peace. The distraught [[Kichisabur\u014d Nomura|Japanese ambassador]], helpless to explain the late ultimatum and unaware of the ongoing attack, is bluntly rebuffed by a despondent Hull.\n\nBack in the Pacific, the Japanese fleet commander, Vice-Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]], refuses to launch a scheduled third wave of aircraft for fear of exposing his force to U.S. submarines. Aboard his flagship, Admiral Yamamoto solemnly informs his staff that their primary target \u2013 the American aircraft carriers \u2013 were not at Pearl Harbor, having departed days previously to search for Japanese vessels. Lamenting that the declaration of war arrived after the attack began, Yamamoto notes that nothing would infuriate the U.S. more and ominously concludes: \"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\"\n\n==Cast==\n''Note: Characters listed by rank in descending order''\n\n=== Americans ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Actor\n! style=\"width:300px;\"|Role\n! style=\"width:650px;\"|Notes\n|-\n|[[Joseph Cotten]]\n|Secretary [[Henry L.

Zanuck]], who had earlier produced ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), wanted to create an epic that depicted what \"really happened on December 7, 1941\", with a \"revisionist's approach\". He believed that the commanders in Hawaii, [[Walter Short|General Short]] and [[Husband E. Kimmel|Admiral Kimmel]], though scapegoated for decades, provided adequate defensive measures for the apparent threats, including relocation of the fighter aircraft at Pearl Harbor to the middle of the base, in response to fears of sabotage from local Japanese. Despite a breakthrough in intelligence, they had received limited warning of the increasing risk of aerial attack.<ref name=\"Parish p. 411\" /> Recognizing that a balanced and objective recounting was necessary, Zanuck developed an American-Japanese co-production, allowing for \"a point of view from both nations\".<ref name=\"Orriss pp. 194\u2013195\" /> He was helped out by his son, [[Richard D.

I felt he was not only uncomfortable directing this kind of movie but also he wasn't used to having somebody tell him how he should make his film. He always had complete autonomy, and nobody would dare make a suggestion to Kurosawa about the budget, or shooting schedule, or anything like that. And then here he was, with Darryl Zanuck on his back and Richard Zanuck on him and Elmo Williams and the production managers, and it was all stuff that he never had run into before, because he was always untouchable. I think he was getting more and more nervous and more insecure about how he was going to work on this film. And of course, the press got a hold of a lot of this unrest on the set and they made a lot out of that in Japan, and it was more pressure on him, and he wasn't used to that kind of pressure.<ref>Galbraith, Stewart. \"[[Stuart Galbraith IV]] interview of Richard Fleischer.\" ''Tora!

These were used for much of the Japanese scenes on ship's decks. The one error introduced, however, was that the model ''Akagi''{{'}}s bridge was built on the starboard side instead of the port side. Only two Japanese carriers were built in this fashion, with bridges on the port side: ''Akagi'' and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}}. This was done because it was known that for the launching scenes filmed in the US, a US carrier would be used and the islands of US carriers were always on the starboard side. A few of the modified aircraft were also converted in Japan for the flight scenes filmed there.\n\nIn preparation for filming, ''Yorktown'' was berthed at [[NAS North Island]] in San Diego to load all the aircraft, maintenance, and film crew prior to sailing to Hawaii. The night before filming the \"Japanese\" take-off scenes she sailed to a spot a few miles west of San Diego and at dawn the film crew filmed the launches of all the aircraft. Since these \"Japanese\" aircraft were not actual carrier-based aircraft, they did not have [[arresting gear]] with which to land back on the carrier, and continued on to land at North Island Naval Air Station. ''Yorktown'' sailed back to North Island and re-loaded the aircraft. She then sailed to Hawaii and the aircraft were off-loaded and used to film the attack scenes in and around Pearl Harbor. Aircraft Specialties of Mesa, Arizona performed maintenance on the aircraft while in Hawaii.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!-- The whole paragraph -->\n\nA [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]'s actual crash landing during filming, a result of a jammed landing gear, was filmed and used in the final cut.<ref>http://ww2f.com/threads/about-tora-tora-tora.16059/.

B-17G-110-VE, 44-85840, c/n 8749, the B-17 in question, was a converted water bomber that crashed fighting a forest fire in Nevada three years later.</ref> The film crew received word that one of the B-17s could not lower their starboard landing gear so they quickly set up to film the \"single gear\" landing. The aircraft stayed aloft to use up as much fuel as possible, which gave the film crew some time to prepare, prior to landing. After viewing the \"single gear\" landing footage they decided to include it in the movie. In the sequence depicting the crash, only the final crash was actual footage. For the scenes leading up to the crash they manually retracted the starboard landing gear on a functioning B-17 and filmed the scenes of its final approach. After touching down on one wheel the pilot simply applied power and took off again. The B-17 that actually landed with one gear up sustained only minor damage to the starboard wing and propellers and was repaired and returned to service. A total of five Boeing B-17s were obtained for filming. Other U.S. aircraft used are the [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] and, especially, the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] (two flyable examples were used). Predominantly, P-40 fighter aircraft are used to depict the U.S. defenders with a full-scale P-40 used as a template for fiberglass replicas (some with working engines and props) that were strafed and blown up during filming.<ref>[[#refHathaway1969|Hathaway 1969]], p. 52.</ref> Fleischer also said a scene involving a P-40 model crashing into the middle of a line of P-40s was unintended, as it was supposed to crash at the end of the line.

She was used largely in the takeoff sequence of the Japanese attack aircraft. The sequence shows interchanging shots of models of the Japanese aircraft carriers and ''Yorktown''. She does not look like any of the Japanese carriers involved in the attack, due to her large [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] island and her angled landing deck. The Japanese carriers had small bridge islands, and angled flight decks were not developed until after the war.<ref>[[Thomas C. Hone|Hone, Thomas C.]], [[Norman Friedman]] and Mark D. Mandeles.

Admiral Halsey was on {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, not the ''Essex''-class carrier {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}, which would not be commissioned until 1944. This is understandable, however, as ''Enterprise'' and all six of the Japanese carriers from the attack had been scrapped or sunk.\n\nIn ''Tora! Tora! Tora!'', an error involves the model of {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi}}. In the film, ''Akagi''{{'}}s bridge island is positioned on the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side of the ship, which is typical on most aircraft carriers. However, the aircraft carrier ''Akagi'' was an exception; her bridge island was on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side of the ship.

In addition, the markings do not display the aircraft's identification numbers as was the case in the actual battle. The white surround on the [[roundel]] on the Japanese aircraft was only used from 1942 onwards.

The [[lattice mast]] (or cage mast) section of the {{sclass|Tennessee|battleship|0}}/''Maryland''-class battleship was built beside the set of the USS ''Nevada'' stern section, but not built upon a set of a deck, but on the ground as the footage in the movie only showed the cage [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] tower. The large scale model of the stern shows the two aft gun turrets with three gun barrels in each; in reality, ''Nevada'' had two heightened fore and aft turrets with two barrels each while the lower two turrets fore and aft had three barrels each. Another model of ''Nevada'', used in the film to portray the whole ship, displays the turrets accurately. The reason for this anomaly is because the aft section model was used in the film to portray both USS ''Nevada'' and USS ''Arizona''. The ships looked remarkably similar except that ''Arizona'' had four triple turrets and a slightly different stern section. Footage and photographs not used in the film show the cage mast as being built on the ground. The USS ''Nevada''/USS ''Arizona'' stern section was shown exploding to represent the explosion that destroyed ''Arizona'', although in reality the explosion took place in #2 [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazine|magazine]], forward, and ''Arizona''{{'}}s stern section remains essentially intact to this day.\n\nThe film has a Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]] fighter being damaged over a naval base and then deliberately crashing into a naval base hangar.
