Parkes]] and [[Lawrence Lasker]], directed by [[Jonathan Kaplan]], and starring [[Matthew Broderick]] and [[Helen Hunt]]. The plot revolves around a USAF Airman (Broderick) and a graduate student (Hunt) who are assigned to care for chimpanzees used in a secret Air Force project.\n\n==Plot==\n[[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison|University of Wisconsin]] graduate student Teri MacDonald (Helen Hunt) has trained a chimpanzee named Virgil (Willie) to use [[American Sign Language|sign language]]. When her [[National Science Foundation]] research grant is not renewed, she is forced to sell Virgil. He is taken to an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] base in Lockridge, Florida, to be used in a top-secret research project involving [[Primate Equilibrium Platform|flight simulation]], though she's told that he's been sent to the [[Houston Zoo]].\n\nAirman Jimmy Garrett (Matthew Broderick) is assigned to the same chimpanzee project. Virgil and Jimmy quickly bond, and Jimmy discovers that Virgil has been taught sign language. Unbeknownst to Jimmy, once the chimpanzees reach a certain level in operating the flight simulator, they will be exposed to a lethal pulse of radiation to determine how long a pilot may survive after a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear exchange]] in carrying out a [[Second strike|second-strike]].\n\nWhen Jimmy becomes aware of the chimpanzees' fate, he contacts Teri, who comes to the base. Teri tells Jimmy that she will inform the NSF of the deception, but Jimmy explains that she does not have enough time because Virgil is scheduled to die soon.\n\nJimmy challenges Dr. Carroll (William Sadler) and others about the project's value by noting that the hypothetical pilot, knowing the implications of the second-strike scenario, would know that he is dying, and would, therefore, be affected by that knowledge. However, the chimpanzees would not be as aware; thus, the project is flawed.  Enraged, Dr. Carroll promises Jimmy that his military career is finished.\n\nMeanwhile, in the [[vivarium]], some of the chimpanzees have unlocked their cages and have stacked crates and boxes to attempt an escape through a skylight. Jimmy, Teri, Dr. Carroll and the authorities walk in the vivarium to see the chimpanzees loose.  Virgil is at the top of the stack and attempts to break the skylight with a crowbar. Teri sees Virgil up top and convinces him to come down. Dr. Carroll attempts to control the chimpanzees with an electric prod, but Goliath the chimpanzee proves too powerful, prompting Dr. Carroll and the authorities to flee.  Many chimpanzees escape the vivarium and cause havoc throughout the base, while Goliath and two other chimpanzees Winston and Spike reach the flight chamber. Inside, Goliath and the two chimpanzees wreck the simulator and short the reactor\u2019s  control panel, causing the radiation reactor to go up.  Jimmy, Teri and Virgil arrive and see the chimpanzees continue to wreck the flight chamber.  Jimmy gets Winston and Spike out and barely escapes, however, Goliath\u2019s refusal to leave despite Jimmy\u2019s pleas traps him in the flight chamber just as the reactor\u2019s control panel short-circuits and generates a radiation blast.  A fire extinguisher left by the chimps jams the reactor on its way down, posing a risk of a possible meltdown.  Jimmy and Virgil convince Goliath to yank out the jammed fire extinguisher and succeeds, but Goliath later dies from radiation exposure.\n\nJimmy and Teri steal a military plane to help the chimpanzees escape, but military police stop them. While the police are holding them, Virgil pilots the plane, and the chimps fly away. They eventually crash in the nearby [[Everglades]] and evade a search. Just as the search is being abandoned, Jimmy and Teri see Virgil hiding in the bush with his chimpanzee girlfriend Ginger. Teri signs to Virgil that he and the others are now \"free\", and the chimpanzees disappear into the Everglades.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Jimmy Garrett\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Teri MacDonald\n* [[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]] as Dr. Carroll (credited as Bill Sadler)\n* Johnny Ray McGhee as Robertson\n* [[Jonathan Stark (actor)|Jonathan Stark]] as Sgt.

Pictures]] with John Badham directing, but switched to 20th Century Fox after Warner Bros insisted on using small actors in chimpanzee suits instead of real chimpanzees. The film was shot in Los Angeles and at [[Camarillo Airport]] and at [[Van Nuys Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Project X|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/57791-PROJECT-X?sid=a7046439-6332-40a1-9d28-6d89257f142e&sr=2.536524&cp=2&pos=6|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-10|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe movie received generally positive reviews from critics. {{asof|2019|03|21}}, it holds a 75% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 20 reviews with an average rating of 6.1/10.\n\nIn his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Walter Goodman described the film as a \"young folks' story, a sweet-natured boy-and-his-chimp tale (even the bad guys aren't all that bad - that's very arguable), with a dose of Animal Liberation to give the impression that something of current significance is going on.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Walter|last=Goodman|title=Film: 'Project X,' About Boy and Simian Sidekick|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/17/movies/film-project-x-about-boy-and-simian-sidekick.html|date=17 April 1987|accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 February 1989, it was the first film ever shown on [[Sky Movies]] in the United Kingdom and Ireland.<ref>''The Times'' page 37, 4 February 1989</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nTV personality [[Bob Barker]] and the [[United Activists for Animal Rights]] accused the film's producers of animal cruelty.
