The film stars [[Jackie Chan]], [[Joey Wong]], [[Kumiko Goto]], [[Chingmy Yau]], [[Gary Daniels]] and [[Leon Lai]]. The film is based on the [[City Hunter|Japanese manga of the same name]]. The film was released in [[Hong Kong]] on 14 January 1993 along with Wong Jing's ''[[Fight Back to School III]]'' starring [[Stephen Chow]].\n\n==Plot==\nRyo Saeba and Kaori Makimura are assigned to locate Shizuko Imamura, the runaway daughter of the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of a prominent Japanese newspaper. Kaori leaves in the middle of the search, unhappy with the way Ryo ignores her romantic feelings for him and flirts with other women. Ryo finds Shizuko at a skateboarding park and a chase ensues, but she escapes in disguise.\n\nShizuko boards a luxury [[cruise liner]], the ''Fuji Maru'', with the ticket she found in the suit she stole. Kaori also boards the ship with her lustful cousin while Ryo sneaks inside to follow her. A terrorist gang led by MacDonald have plans to hijack it and take the rich passengers hostage with Police Officer Saeko Nogami and her buxom sidekick in pursuit.\n\nStaying next door from each other, Shizuko overhears MacDonald's plan. MacDonald discovers her and sends one of his men to kill her, but she knocks him out and escapes. She then bumps into the ship's first officer, who takes her to the boiler room and reveals himself as a terrorist. When he attempts to silence Shizuko, Ryo, who had been staying there since his encounter with Kaori and her cousin at the swimming pool, saves her. When MacDonald's gang arrive, the officer is killed in the shootout while Ryo and Shizuko escape into the movie theater, where ''[[Game of Death]]'' is being shown. To beat two towering opponents, Ryo interprets [[Bruce Lee]]'s techniques from the film.\n\nAt the ship's casino, a party hosted by the captain is interrupted when MacDonald kills the captain and terrorizes the partygoers, including Saeko and her sidekick. After robbing them of their valuables, he entices the rich patrons into a sadistic card game. A few opponents are quickly disposed of until Kao Ta, a skilled card gamer who uses his cards as shurikens, joins in. When MacDonald is distracted by seeing Ryo and Shizuko not far away, Ta and Saeko put an end to his game.\n\nMacDonald's henchman Kim kidnaps Kaori and takes her to his room. When Ryo bursts in, both men fight before MacDonald and his men interrupt, capturing Ryo in the process. Kaori escapes, bumping into Shizuko, Saeko, and the rest of the main characters. They take down a gay terrorist trying to seduce Kaori's cousin and prepare to save Ryo.\n\nThe next day, Ryo is stood before a firing squad. Shizuko, Saeko, and her sidekick interrupt the planned execution, but are forced to separate by MacDonald's gang. Shizuko uses her gymnastic skills to defeat one henchman, Saeko saves Ta after he runs out of cards in a fight with several terrorists, and her sidekick falls off a ledge and is left unconscious. Ryo goes into the [[video arcade|gaming parlor]] with his hands still tied, but is thrown into a ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' [[arcade game]] by Kim and suffers an [[electric shock]]. This causes him to hallucinate and think Kim is [[Ken Masters|Ken]] from the game. After a failed attempt to defeat him as [[E. Honda]], Ryo defeats him as [[Chun-Li]].\n\nAs a [[Taiwan]]ese counter terrorism unit, the \"Thunderbolts Squad\", arrives and take his men out, MacDonald blows up bombs he had set up all over the ship and takes Kaori hostage at the casino. When Ryo and Saeko arrive, he injures both women and starts a long fight with Ryo. However, MacDonald is thrown into the stage and dies when he accidentally steps on his remote, setting off the bombs behind the T.V. panels.\n\nRyo and Kaori find Shizuko and return to her father. He speaks to Ryo privately, seeing him as a future husband to Shizuko. Listening to their conversation, Kaori leaves in anger, unaware that Ryo has declined the man's offer. However, Ryo finds her and tries to apologize with a rose, but then Saeko drives up and flirts with him. He gives her the rose instead and furious, Kaori smashes him through the air with a big hammer. Ryo wakes up in his recurring dream with beautiful women at the swimming pool.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as [[Ryo Saeba]]\n* [[Joey Wong]] as Kaori Makimura\n**[[Leila Tong]] as Kaori as a child\n* [[Kumiko Goto]] as Shizuko Imamura\n* [[Chingmy Yau]] as Saeko Nogami\n* Carol Wan as Saeko's friend\n* [[Leon Lai]] as Kao Ta the gambler (Kao Ta the Wanderer/Gao Da the Wanderer)\n* [[Pal Sinn]] as Rocky Dung\n* [[Ken Lo|Lo Wai-kwong]] as Chen Ta-wen\n* [[Eric Kot]] as DJ Hard\n* [[Jan Lamb|Jan Lam]] as DJ Soft\n* [[Richard Norton (actor)|Richard Norton]] as Col.

Two years later, Fortune Star released a 3 disc set on 29 December 2003 with two other martial arts films: ''[[Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky|Story of Ricky]]'' and ''[[The Dragon from Russia]]''. In the United States, the first DVD release was a port of the Mega Star Region 0 release repackaged by Tai Seng. Later on, [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] released a region 1 DVD in 2004 utilizing the remastered Fortune Star transfer. It was released again in 2012 by [[Shout Factory]] in a double feature single disc with ''[[The Big Brawl|Battle Creek Brawl]]'' on both [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]].\n\nAll currently available versions restore a scene that was removed from both the theatrical release as well as the [[LaserDisc]] versions of the film. The scene involves one of Kaori's suitors going on a rant about foreign tourists (to wit, [[Richard Norton (actor)|Richard Norton]]'s band of terrorists) and saying that he hopes they die of [[AIDS]] in Chinese, only to discover that they understood him very well. The scene was removed because the film's distributors were concerned that foreign audiences might be offended by the homophobic nature of the scene.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe DVD release received mixed reviews in the early 2000s, with a 50% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Critics praised the action sequences, but criticised the story and [[slapstick]] [[anime]] style. [[IGN]] concluded that \"it fails as an adaptation but succeeds as a fun Jackie Chan flick.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|city_hunter|City Hunter}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jackie Chan filmography]]\n* [[List of Hong Kong films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0103950|title=City Hunter}}\n* {{Amg movie|146083|City Hunter}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|city_hunter|City Hunter}}\n* [http://trashcity.org/BLITZ/BLIT0430.HTM City Hunter review at Trash City]\n\n{{City Hunter}}\n{{Wong Jing}}\n{{Street Fighter series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:City Hunter (Film)}}\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:1993 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:1990s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s martial arts comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s Cantonese-language films]]\n[[Category:City Hunter]]\n[[Category:Films about murderers]]\n[[Category:Films about ship hijackings]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wong Jing]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Golden Harvest films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong martial arts comedy films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong slapstick comedy films]]\n[[Category:Live-action films based on manga]]\n[[Category:Films set on ships]]\n[[Category:1990s Hong Kong films]]"}]}}}}
