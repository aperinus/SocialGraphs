It is the second installment of the [[Predator (franchise)|''Predator'' franchise]], serving as a sequel to 1987's ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', with Kevin Peter Hall reprising the title role of the [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]. Set ten years after the events of the first film, in [[Los Angeles]], the film focuses on the Predator, a technologically advanced extraterrestrial hunter, and the efforts of a disgruntled police officer and his allies to defeat the malevolent creature.\n\nAt the time of release, the film received generally negative reviews and earned a moderate return at the box office, grossing $57 million worldwide, compared to the previous film's $98 million gross on a smaller production budget. The film has been viewed more positively over time, especially for Danny Glover's performance, the direction, and the musical score, and has gained a cult following. This would be the last film appearance of the Predator until 2004's [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] film [[Alien vs. Predator (film)|''Alien vs. Predator'']], followed in 2007 by ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]''. A third film, [[Predators (film)|''Predators'']], was released in 2010, a fourth film, [[The Predator (film)|''The Predator'']] in 2018, and a [[prequel]], [[Prey (2022 film)|''Prey'']], in 2022.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1997, Los Angeles is suffering from both a [[heat wave]] and a turf war between heavily armed [[Medell\u00edn Cartel|Colombian]] and [[Jamaican posse|Jamaican drug cartels]]. A [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] watches a shootout between the police, Jamaicans, and Colombians, observing as Lieutenant Michael R. Harrigan charges into the firefight to rescue two wounded officers and drive the Colombians back into their hideout. The Predator assaults the Colombians, causing a disturbance that prompts Harrigan and detectives Leona Cantrell and Danny Archuleta to defy orders and enter the hideout, where they find the slaughtered Colombians. On the roof, Harrigan shoots the crazed gang leader and catches a glimpse of the camouflaged Predator, but dismisses it as a consequence of the extreme heat and his [[acrophobia]]. At the station, Harrigan is reprimanded by his superiors for his disobedience and introduced to Special Agent Peter Keyes, leader of a task force investigating the cartels, and Detective Jerry Lambert, the newest member of Harrigan's team.\n\nLater that evening, Jamaicans invade the Colombian drug lord's penthouse and murder him before they are murdered in turn by the Predator. Upon their arrival, Harrigan's team notes the similarities between the current crime scene and the earlier Colombian massacre until Keyes' team arrives and removes them. Archuleta returns to conduct a solo investigation, finding one of the Predator's spear tips before the creature kills him. As an enraged Harrigan vows to stop Archuleta's killer, forensic analysis reveals the spear tip is not composed of any known element on the [[periodic table]]. Seeking answers, Harrigan meets with Jamaican drug lord King Willie, a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] practitioner who tells Harrigan that the killer is supernatural and that he should prepare himself for battle against it. Harrigan leaves before the Predator kills King Willie, taking his head as a trophy. Tracing a lead indicating Archuleta's killer had recently been in a slaughterhouse, Harrigan arranges to meet his team at the warehouse district to investigate.\n\nCantrell and Lambert take the subway there but are ambushed by the Predator, who kills Lambert and numerous armed passengers but spares Cantrell after its helmet's scanners indicate that she is pregnant. Arriving on the scene, Harrigan chases the fleeing Predator but is intercepted by Keyes' men. Keyes reveals that the monster is an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] hunter with [[infrared]] vision and [[active camouflage]] that has been hunting humans for sport throughout several armed conflicts, with the most recent being a decade prior in Central America. {{efn|As depicted in the preceding film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]''.}} Keyes and his team have set a trap in a nearby slaughterhouse, using thermally insulated suits with mounted [[ultraviolet]] lights and [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] weapons to capture it for study. Upon arrival, the suspicious Predator uses its scanners to track, outmaneuver, and slaughter Keyes' men via their lights.\n\nHarrigan attacks and wounds the Predator, but it destroys his weapon. It nearly kills him before Keyes tries to freeze the creature, only to be bisected by the Predator's Smart Disc. The Predator chases Harrigan to the roof, where they clash until they are left hanging from a ledge. The creature activates a self-destruct device on its forearm, which Harrigan severs with the throwing disc, disarming it while the Predator falls through an apartment, where it treats its wounds and flees. Harrigan pursues it to a spacecraft hidden underground and eventually kills the Predator with its throwing disc. A group of Predators emerges to collect their dead comrade and give Harrigan an antique [[flintlock]] pistol as a trophy. {{efn|Inscribed with \"Raphael Adolini 1715\", the origin of this pistol is explored in the 1996 comic series ''[[List of Predator (franchise) comics#Predator: 1718|Predator: 1718]]'' and the 2022 [[prequel]] film ''[[Prey (2022 film)|Prey]]''.}} As the ship takes off, Harrigan escapes to the surface and meets with the remainder of Keyes' team. As Keyes' subordinate Garber curses their lost opportunity to capture the creature, Harrigan privately muses that the beings will return.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Predator (film series) characters}}\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Lieutenant Mike Harrigan, an [[LAPD]] Officer who is investigating rival Jamaican and Colombian [[drug cartel]]s.

Carrillo filmed an additional scene in which she talks to the camera and describes the events of the first film, but this scene was cut.\n\n==Production==\nOnce [[20th Century Fox]] approached ''Predator'' screenwriters [[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim]] and [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]] to write a sequel, they pitched six ideas, one of which was \"putting the creature in an urban jungle\", which the studio liked.<ref name=\"starlog\">{{cite journal|author=Shapiro|first=Marc|date=December 1990|title=Predator Season|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-161/161_djvu.txt|journal=[[Starlog]]|issue=161}}</ref> The eventual setting was Los Angeles, portrayed as a city blighted by gang warfare in the midst of a severe [[heat wave]], creating the ideal \"hot spot\" in which the Predator would search for hunting targets.

For the set design, Paul aimed for a \"kind of retrograde future that's equal parts ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' and ''[[Blade Runner]]'' mixed in with modern-day technology\", with \"big and outrageous\" structures but simpler prop design, such as boxy and colorless cars.<ref name=fangoria>{{cite journal|title=Predator 2 Stalks The Concrete Jungle|last=Shapiro|first=Marc|date=December 1990|issue=99|journal=[[Fangoria]]|url=https://archive.org/stream/Fangoria_099_c2c_1990_Predator_2_FemaleBikerSweat-DREGS/Fangoria_099_c2c_1990_Predator_2_FemaleBikerSweat-DREGS_djvu.txt}}</ref>\n\nThe MPAA initially gave ''Predator 2'' an NC-17 rating, so several cuts were made to bring it down to an R rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/movies-originally-rated-x-nc-17-shocking/|title=15 Movies That Were Originally NC-17|last=Byrd|first=Matthew|date=14 August 2017|website=[[Screen Rant]]|access-date=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nA short unofficial music video was made towards the end of filming; Danny Glover can be seen dancing with the Predator and others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/predator-2-outtake-danny-glover-dance-party/|title = Danny Glover Throws a Predator Dance Party in Wild Predator 2 Outtake|date = July 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Predator 2 (soundtrack)}}\n\n[[Alan Silvestri]] returned to score the sequel, conducting the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra.

I was only 29 years old \u2013 I was like a rampant child, running around Los Angeles, blowing the shit out of everything and making things as bloody as possible.\" About the modest reception at the box office and the cult status since its release, he added \"It had a big initial opening weekend if I remember correctly \u2013 but I think many people were disappointed that Arnold wasn\u2019t in it. A lot of people like the film and some prefer it to the original \u2013 just because it\u2019s in a city and more contemporary.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scifinow.co.uk/interviews/throwback-predator-2|title=Throwback: ''Predator 2''|date=November 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDanny Glover was also proud of his performance, saying:<ref name=\"DR\" />\n<blockquote>I have two films I\u2019ve done that I feel that I was bigger than life in, in which I felt that I could control the space. ''Silverado'' for me, and ''Predator 2''. In ''Predator 2'', it was like \u2018who\u2019s the baddest cat in your space, and the baddest cat says \u2018I\u2019m gonna challenge you.\u2019 Mano y mano. I was the baddest guy in his space. What happens? I kill him, and then the others come around, and I\u2019m like \u2018alright... who\u2019s next?\u2019 I was about 42, 43.. in the best shape in my life, best shape I\u2019ve been in. I was running on the beach, had my training, I was lifting weights a lot more than I am now. I was really feeling it in that movie.<ref name=\"DR\">{{cite web|url=https://douglassalumni.blogspot.com/2015/11/an-interview-with-danny-glover_22.html|title=Douglass-Riverview News and Current Events: An Interview with Danny Glover|date=November 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/role-recall-danny-glover-remembers-the-color-purple-saw-and-his-classic-line-in-lethal-weapon-172058055.html|title=Role Recall: Danny Glover Remembers {{'}}''The Color Purple'',' {{'}}''Saw'',' and His Classic Line in {{'}}''Lethal Weapon''{{'}}}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Other media==\n===Sequels and prequel===\n{{Main|Predators (film)|The Predator (film)|Prey (2022 film)}}\nA third main film titled ''Predators'' was released in 2010, and a fourth, ''The Predator'', in 2018. A [[prequel]] titled ''Prey'', which takes place in 1719, was released in 2022.\n\n===Novelization===\nA [[novelization]] of the film written by [[Simon Hawke]] was released on December 1, 1990, by the publishing company [[Jove Books|Jove]].<ref name=\"amazon\">[https://www.amazon.com/Predator-2-Novel-Simon-Hawke/dp/0515105783 ''Predator 2'': A Novel] at Amazon.com</ref> The novelization provided a small amount of information regarding the fate of \"Dutch\" from the first film. Keyes recalls memories of speaking with the battered Major while infirmed in a hospital, suffering from radiation sickness. \"Dutch\" is said to have escaped from the hospital, never to be seen again. Furthermore, the novel tells a great deal of the story from the Predator's point of view, such as its humiliation of having its mask removed by Harrigan and its reasoning for not killing Cantrell due to its discovery of her pregnancy.\n\n===Video games===\nThe film was adapted twice as a video game; [[Predator 2 (computer game)|the first for computer in 1990]] and [[Predator 2 (1992 video game)|the second for Sega Genesis in 1992]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Predator 2}}\n* {{IMDb title|0100403}}\n* {{Amg movie|39014}}\n* {{mojo title|predator2}}\n\n{{Predator (franchise)}}\n{{Stephen Hopkins}}\n\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:American action horror films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films about Colombian drug cartels]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1997]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:American police detective films]]\n[[Category:Predator (franchise) films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Davis Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Silver Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stephen Hopkins]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Lawrence Gordon]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Joel Silver]]\n[[Category:Films produced by John Davis]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Alan Silvestri]]\n[[Category:Films about extraterrestrial life]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jim Thomas (screenwriter)]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by John Thomas (screenwriter)]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
