The film stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Virginie Ledoyen]], [[Guillaume Canet]], and [[Robert Carlyle]]. It was filmed on the [[Thailand|Thai]] island of [[Ko Phi Phi Le]].\n\nThe film was a moderate box office success but received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. DiCaprio was nominated for the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor]] (lost to [[John Travolta]] as Terl from ''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]'' and as Russ Richards in ''[[Lucky Numbers]]'').\n\n==Plot==\nRichard, a young American seeking adventure in [[Bangkok]], stays in a drab travelers' hotel on [[Khao San Road]] where he meets a young French couple, Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne. He meets Daffy, who tells him of a pristine, uninhabited island in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] with a beautiful hidden beach. Daffy explains that he settled there in secret several years earlier, but difficulties arose and he left. Daffy commits suicide, leaving Richard a map to the island. Richard convinces Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne to accompany him to the island, and the three travel to [[Ko Samui]]. Richard meets two American surfers who have heard rumors of the island and gives them a copy of the map.\n\nEn route to the island, Richard becomes infatuated with Fran\u00e7oise. After swimming to the island from a neighboring one, they find a cannabis plantation guarded by armed Thai [[farmer]]s. Avoiding detection, they make their way across the island and meet Keaty, who brings them to a community of travelers living on the island in secret. Sal, the community's English leader, explains that the farmers allow them to stay so long as they keep to themselves and do not allow any more travelers to come to the island. Richard lies that they have not shown the map to anyone else. The trio become integrated into the community.\n\nOne night, Fran\u00e7oise invites Richard to the beach where she tells him that she is falling in love with him and cheats on \u00c9tienne with Richard. Despite hoping to keep it secret, the community finds out. While angry, \u00c9tienne says he will not stand in their way if Fran\u00e7oise is happier with Richard.\n\nSal selects Richard to accompany her on a supply run to [[Ko Pha Ngan]]. They encounter the American surfers who are preparing to search for the island and mention Richard's map. Sal is upset but believes Richard when he says they have no map. In order to ensure that Sal will not tell the rest of the island about the map, Richard has sex with her at her order.  On their return to the island, Richard lies to Fran\u00e7oise about having had sex with Sal.\n\nWhen the surfers turn up on the neighboring island, Sal orders Richard to send them away and destroy their map. She tells everyone that she and Richard had sex, which leaves Fran\u00e7oise angry and heartbroken, causing her to return to \u00c9tienne. Isolated from the group, Richard begins to lose his sanity, imagining that he is conversing with the deceased Daffy.\n\nThe surfers reach the island but are discovered and killed by the farmers. Shocked at witnessing their deaths, Richard gathers Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne to leave the island.\n\nRichard is captured by the farmers along with Fran\u00e7oise and \u00c9tienne. The farmers are furious with the community for breaking their deal to not allow any more newcomers. The lead farmer gives Sal a gun loaded with a single bullet and orders her to make a choice: kill Richard and the group will be allowed to stay, or else they must all leave immediately. Sal pulls the trigger, but the chamber is empty. Shocked by her willingness to commit murder, the other members of the community abandon Sal, leave the island, and go their separate ways.\n\nBack in the United States, Richard receives an email at an [[Internet cafe]] from Fran\u00e7oise with a nostalgic group photograph of the beach community in happier times.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Virginie Ledoyen Cannes 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Virginie Ledoyen]] portrays Fran\u00e7oise in this film.]]\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Richard, a freelance traveler.\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Sal, the leader of the beach community.\n* [[Virginie Ledoyen]] as Fran\u00e7oise, the girlfriend of \u00c9tienne, and Richard's love interest.\n* [[Guillaume Canet]] as \u00c9tienne, the boyfriend of Fran\u00e7oise.\n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as Daffy, the eccentric former member of the beach community.\n* [[Paterson Joseph]] as Keaty, a member of the beach community who loves [[cricket]].\n* Lars Arentz-Hansen as Bugs, Sal's South-African boyfriend and the beach community's carpenter.\n* [[Daniel Caltagirone]] as Unhygienix, the beach community's chef who has an obsession with soap due to having to always prepare the fish for consumption.\n* [[Staffan Kihlbom]], [[Jukka Hiltunen]], and Magnus Lindgren as Christo, Karl, and Sten, the beach community's Swedish fishermen.\n* [[Victoria Smurfit]] as Weathergirl, a member of the beach community whose tightening pelvis has been a sign for rain.\n* [[Zelda Tinska]] and Lidija Zovki\u0107 as Sonja and Mirjana, two beach community members who come from [[Sarajevo]].\n* Samuel Gough as Guitarman, the beach community's residential guitarist who is not a good singer.\n* [[Peter Youngblood Hills]] and Jerry Swindall as Zeph and Sammy, two Americans whom Richard meets in Ko Samui.\n* [[Saskia Mulder]] and Simone Huber as Hilda and Eva, two women who accompany Zeph and Sammy to the island.\n* Peter Gevisser as Gregorio, an Italian member of the beach community.\n* [[Abhijati Jusakul|Abhijati 'Meuk' Jusakul]] as the leader of the cannabis farmers.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Maya Bay Thailand.jpg|thumb|right|The paradise location, Maya bay in [[Ko Phi Phi Le]]]]\n[[Image:Ko Phi Phi Lee.jpg|thumb|right|Ko Phi Phi Le]]\n\n[[Ewan McGregor]] was cast as the main character before leaving due to disputes with the director.

It was about our friendship. I felt like Danny's actor and it made me a bit rudderless.\" \nBoyle stated, \"I handled it very very badly and I have apologised to Ewan for it. I felt a great shame about it and how it was handled.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN0FnbcqiDI Ewan McGregor and Danny Boyle didn\u2019t speak for many years \u2013 The Graham Norton Show 2017 \u2013 BBC One - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nMembers of the cast and crew were involved in a boating accident during production.

There is a gap between mountains on the actual beach in Thailand. The special effects crew digitally added some of the surrounding mountains during the post-production phase.\n\nBoyle has been cited saying that the look of the jungle scenes in the film was inspired by the [[Nintendo]] game ''[[Banjo-Kazooie (video game)|Banjo-Kazooie]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe waterfall scene, where DiCaprio and others jump from a high cliff to the water below, was filmed in [[Khao Yai National Park]] in central [[Thailand]], at the Haew Suwat Waterfall.\n\nThe map in the film was illustrated by the author of the book that ''The Beach'' was based upon, [[Alex Garland]]. He received credit for this as the cartographer.\n\nIn 1999, [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Fougerolles]] auditioned for the film but casting directors immediately told her that she was not mysterious enough for the character as she arrived with blond hair in [[pigtail]]s. She asked them if she could \"be an extra or serve coffees there, three months in [[Thailand]], it sounds idyllic!\". Although firstly reluctant because the actress was already established in the industry, they finally accepted. As journalists were not allowed to come take pictures on set, the only picture the press could have of [[Guillaume Canet]] and [[Virginie Ledoyen]] before shooting started was their departure at [[Paris Airports|Paris airport]] with de Fougerolles. They made it the cover of ''[[Studio magazine|Studio Magazine]]'', from which the international press reported her as officially cast.

[[CNN]]'s [[Paul Clinton]] said \"Leonardo DiCaprio's main fan base of screaming adolescent girls won't be disappointed with ''The Beach''. The majority of the film displays the titanic-sized young heartthrob sans his shirt in this story about the pseudo-angst and alienation of a young man from the United States escaping civilization and his computer-obsessed generation.\" He agreed with most others that ''The Beach'' was \"nothing to write home about\". DiCaprio was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Razzie Award for Worst Actor]] for his work on the film.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Damage to filming location===\nControversy arose during the making of the film due to 20th Century Fox's bulldozing and landscaping of the natural beach setting of [[Ko Phi Phi Le]] to make it more \"paradise-like\". The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state; however, lawsuits were filed by environmentalists who believed the damage to the ecosystem was permanent and restoration attempts had failed.<ref>Vidal, John.
