The film stars [[Denzel Washington]] as  [[Rubin Carter|Rubin \"The Hurricane\" Carter]], a former middleweight boxer who was wrongly convicted for a triple murder in a bar in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. The script was adapted by [[Armyan Bernstein]] and [[Dan Gordon (screenwriter)|Dan Gordon]] from Carter's 1974 autobiography ''The  Sixteenth Round: From Number 1 Contender To 45472'' and the 1991 non-fiction work ''Lazarus and the Hurricane: The Freeing of Rubin \"The Hurricane\" Carter'' by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton.\n\nThe film depicts Carter's arrest, his life in prison and how he was freed by the love and compassion of a teenager from Brooklyn named [[Lesra Martin]] and his [[Canadians|Canadian]] foster family.<ref name=answers>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=The Hurricane|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/the-hurricane-1999-film|publisher=Answers.com|access-date=2012-10-27}}</ref> The film received positive reviews and won several awards, including a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] for Best Actor for Washington's performance. Washington was also nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\nThe film was released by Universal Pictures in the United States on December 29, 1999. It grossed $74 million against a budget of $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film tells the story of [[middleweight]] boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin \"The Hurricane\" Carter]], who was wrongfully convicted of committing a triple murder in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey. His sentence was set aside after he had spent nearly 20 years in prison. The film concentrates on Rubin Carter's life between 1966 and 1985. It describes his fight against the conviction for triple murder and how he copes with nearly 20 years in prison.\n\nA parallel plot follows [[Lesra Martin]], an underprivileged Afro-American youth from Brooklyn, now living in [[Toronto]]. In the 1980s, the child becomes interested in Carter's life and circumstances after reading Carter's autobiography. He convinces his Canadian foster family to commit themselves to Carter's case. The story culminates with Carter's legal team's successful pleas to Judge [[H. Lee Sarokin]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]].\n\nIn 1966, Rubin \"The Hurricane\" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer, expected by many fans to become the world's greatest boxing champion. When three victims, specifically the club's bartender and a male and a female customer, were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and interrogated by the police.\n\nAlthough the police asserted that Carter and Artis were innocent and thus, \"were never suspects,\" a man named Alfred Bello, a suspect himself in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of the triple homicide in the club, and Carter was given three consecutive life sentences.\n\nThroughout the trial, Carter proclaimed his innocence, claiming that his race, his boxing career and status and his work as a civil rights activist were the real reasons for his conviction. Eight years later, Bello and a co-suspect, Arthur Bradley, who also claimed that Carter was present at the scene of the crimes, renounced and recanted their testimony. However, Carter and Artis were convicted once again.\n\nAfterwards, the plot goes back to Lesra Martin, who works with a trio of Canadian activists to push the State of New Jersey to reexamine Carter's case.\n\nIn 1985, a Federal District Court ruled that the prosecution in Carter's second trial committed \"grave constitutional violations\" and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts. As a result, Carter and later Artis were finally freed. Outside following the verdict, Carter summed up his story by saying, \"Hate got me into this place, love got me out.\"<ref name=answers/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as [[Rubin Carter|Rubin 'The Hurricane' Carter]]\n* [[Vicellous Reon Shannon]] as [[Lesra Martin]]\n* [[Deborah Kara Unger]] as Lisa Peters\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Sam Chaiton\n* [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] as Terry Swinton\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Sergeant Della Pesca, based on [[Vincent DeSimone]]\n* [[Debbi Morgan]] as Mae Thelma Carter\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Lieutenant Jimmy Williams\n* [[David Paymer]] as Myron Beldock\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Leon Friedman\n* [[Rod Steiger]] as Judge [[H.

Washington as Hurricane Carter is spare, focused, filled with anger and pride.... This is strong stuff, and I was amazed, after feeling some impatience in the earlier reaches of the film, to find myself so deeply absorbed in its second and third acts, until at the end I was blinking at tears.

Well, of course it was. Those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. Most biopics, like most grandmothers, see the good in a man and demonize his enemies. They pass silently over his imprudent romances. In dramatizing his victories, they simplify them. And they provide the best roles to the most interesting characters. If they didn't, we wouldn't pay to see them.\" He added, \"''The Hurricane'' is not a documentary but a parable, in which two lives are saved by the power of the written word.\"<ref name=ebert/>\n\nFilm critic [[Stephen Holden]], writing for ''The New York Times'', had mixed views of the film but praised the acting. He wrote: \"In telling the story of Mr. Carter's protracted and ultimately successful fight for freedom and justice, ''The Hurricane'' rides to glory on an astonishing performance by Denzel Washington.... That is to say, Mr. Washington leans into an otherwise schlocky movie and slams it out of the ballpark. If his Hurricane is an inspiring portrait of nobility, it is because the actor never conceals the demons of fury and despair gnawing beneath his character's forcefully articulate surface.\"<ref name=nyt/>\n\n[[Alex von Tunzelmann]], writing for [[The Guardian]], gave the film a \"B\", but cited issues with historical accuracy, including depictions of Carter's military service, prior criminal record, and the Giardello fight. He also stated that the inclusion of negative aspects of Carter's life would not have made it acceptable \"that he was wrongfully convicted of three murders.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=von Tunzelmann |first1=Alex |title=The Hurricane: the facts of Rubin Carter's life story are beaten to a pulp |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/24/the-hurricane-rubin-carter-denzel-washington |work=The Guardian |access-date=14 April 2021}}</ref>\n\nHolden was forthright about the veracity of the film, writing, \"The film is so eager to stir us up that it thinks little of bending the facts for dramatic effect. Among its most egregious distortions is its depiction of Mr. Carter's 1964 middleweight title match with Joey Giardello. The movie (which has fine, naturalistic boxing sequences) inaccurately portrays the fight as lost by Carter solely because of the judges' racism. The taking of such license, of course, adds an extra jolt of drama. But when these and other distortions and exaggerations are added up, it's worth wondering if that self-congratulatory glow the movie leaves us with has been gotten far too easily and at what cost.\"<ref name=nyt>Holden, Stephen.
