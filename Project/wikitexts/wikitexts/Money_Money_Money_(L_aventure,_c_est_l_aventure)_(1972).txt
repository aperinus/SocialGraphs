Lino, for example, finds that his prostitutes want to be independent entrepreneurs recognised by the state. Jacques accepts that his bank robberies yield a low net return for high risks. After much discussion, the five settle on celebrity kidnaps. Their first target is the singer Johnny Hallyday, who is delighted at the publicity and himself writes them a huge ransom cheque.\n\nDecamping with the proceeds to Latin America, they are hired by left-wing guerillas to kidnap the Swiss ambassador. The government agree to free twenty imprisoned revolutionaries in exchange for his release. When Ernesto, leader of the rebels, refuses to pay the kidnappers' fee, they kidnap him and sell his freedom for cash to three separate buyers; his soldiers, the government, and the CIA.\n\nThe gang decamp with the proceeds to the USA, where they hijack a 747 and return it for a fee in millions. Taking a holiday break on a yacht, they are hailed by five beauties in a speedboat. When the couples have paired off, Ernesto's soldiers scramble aboard. Under torture, the five men tell him how to access their Swiss bank account. Once he has their money, he hands them over to the French police, who put the five on trial.\n\nTheir defence lawyer craftily claims that the trial is political rather than criminal. Worried, the justice minister arranges for them to escape and fly out of the country. Landing in Africa, their skills are in immediate demand. The army is planning a coup on the day after the Pope arrives for a visit. The gang kidnap the Pope at the airport and demand that every Catholic in the world must contribute at least one dollar for his release.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Lino Ventura]] \u2013 Lino Massaro\n* [[Jacques Brel]] \u2013 Jacques\n* [[Charles Denner]] \u2013 Simon Duroc\n* [[Johnny Hallyday]] \u2013 Himself\n* [[Charles G\u00e9rard]] \u2013 Charlot\n* [[Aldo Maccione]] \u2013 Aldo\n* [[Nicole Courcel]] \u2013 Nicole\n* [[Yves Robert]] \u2013 L'avocat de la d\u00e9fense\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Falcon]] \u2013 The ambassador\n* [[Juan Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] \u2013 Ernesto Juarez\n* [[Gordon Heath]]\t\n* [[Prudence Harrington]] \u2013 The ambassador's wife\n* [[Maddly Bamy]] \u2013 Une vacanci\u00e8re (credited as [[Madly Bamy]])\n* [[Sophie Boudet]] \u2013 Une vacanci\u00e8re\n* [[Annie Ho]] \u2013 Une vacanci\u00e8re (credited as [[Annie Hau]])\n* [[Annie Kerani]] \u2013 Une vacanci\u00e8re\n* [[Xavier G\u00e9lin]] \u2013 Lino's son\n* [[Sevim Joyce]]\t\t\n* [[Jean Berger]]\t\t\n* [[Henry Czarniak]] \u2013 Le motard\n* [[G\u00e9rard Sire]] \u2013 L'avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\n* [[Michele Alet]] (uncredited)\n* [[Catherine All\u00e9gret]] \u2013 Une militante (uncredited)\n* [[Elie Chouraqui]] \u2013 A revolutionary (uncredited)\n* [[Jean Collomb]] \u2013 The Pope (uncredited)\n* [[Georges Cravenne]] \u2013 Le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal (uncredited)\n* [[Eva Damien]] \u2013 L'experte en politique (uncredited)\n* [[Michel Drucker]] \u2013 Himself (uncredited)\n* [[El Kebir]] \u2013 Un militant (uncredited)\n* [[Arlette Gordon]] \u2013 The flight attendant (uncredited)\n* [[Sylvain Joubert]] \u2013 Un militant (uncredited)\n* [[Pierre Kast]] (uncredited)\n* [[Alexandre Mnouchkine]] \u2013 Davis (uncredited)\n* [[Jacques Paoli]] \u2013 Himself (uncredited)\n* [[Roger Rudel]] \u2013 An official in the car (uncredited)\n* [[Lionel Vitrant]] \u2013 Man on a bicycle (uncredited)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|0066798}}\n\n{{Claude Lelouch}}\n{{Johnny Hallyday}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aventure c'est l'aventure}}\n[[Category:French comedy films]]\n[[Category:1972 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Claude Lelouch]]\n[[Category:Films about kidnapping in France]]\n[[Category:Jacques Brel]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Francis Lai]]\n[[Category:1972 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s French films]]"}]}}}}
