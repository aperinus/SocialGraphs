J. Caruso]] and with a screenplay by [[John Glenn (screenwriter)|John Glenn]], Travis Adam Wright, Hillary Seitz and Dan McDermott from a story by McDermott. The film stars [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Michelle Monaghan]] and [[Billy Bob Thornton]]. It follows two strangers who must go on the run together, after receiving a mysterious phone call from an unknown woman who uses [[information and communications technology]] to track them. The film premiered in traditional theaters and [[IMAX]] theaters on September 26, 2008, and grossed $178 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn January 2009, [[Stanford University]] dropout Jerry Shaw learns that his [[identical twin]] brother Ethan, an officer in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], has been killed.  Following the funeral, Jerry is surprised to find $750,000 in his bank account and his apartment filled with illegal firearms and bomb making materials.  He receives a phone call from a woman who warns that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] is about to arrest him and he needs to run.  Jerry is caught by the FBI and interrogated by Supervising Agent Tom Morgan.\n\nWhile Morgan confers with [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations|Air Force OSI]] Special Agent Zoe P\u00e9rez, the woman on the phone arranges for Jerry's escape and directs him to Rachel Holloman, a single mother.  The woman on the phone is coercing Rachel by threatening her son Sam, who is aboard the ''[[Capitol Limited]]'' en route to the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] with his school band.  The woman on the phone helps the two avoid law enforcement by controlling networked devices, including [[traffic light]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, automated [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, and even [[electric power transmission|power lines]].\n\nMeanwhile, the caller redirects a crystalline explosive to a [[lapidary|gemcutter]], who cuts it and fixes it into a necklace.  Another man steals Sam's trumpet in Chicago and fits the crystal's sonic trigger into the tubing before forwarding it to Sam in Washington.\n\nAgent Perez is summoned by [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] George Callister to be [[read into]] Ethan's job at [[the Pentagon]].  Ethan monitored the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s top-secret intelligence-gathering [[supercomputer]], the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst (ARIIA; {{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0r|i\u02d0|\u0259}}).  Callister leaves Perez with [[Major (United States)#Army|Major]] William Bowman and ARIIA to investigate Ethan Shaw's death.  Simultaneously, Rachel and Jerry learn that the woman on the phone is actually ARIIA, and that she has \"activated\" them according to the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]'s authorization to recruit civilians for the national defense.\n\nPerez and Bowman find evidence that Ethan Shaw hid in ARIIA's chamber and leave to brief Callister.  Afterwards, ARIIA smuggles Jerry and Rachel into her observation theater under the Pentagon.  Both groups learn that after ARIIA's recommendation was ignored and a botched operation in [[Balochistan]] [[blowback (intelligence)|resulted in the deaths]] of U.S. citizens, ARIIA concluded that \"to prevent more bloodshed, the [[federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] must be removed.\"  ARIIA is acting on behalf of \"[[We the People]]\", and cites the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] (\"whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it\").\n\nBelatedly, Jerry learns he has been brought to circumvent [[biometrics|biometric]] locks placed by his twin that prevent ARIIA from activating Operation Guillotine, a [[military simulation]] of maintaining government after the loss of [[United States presidential line of succession|all presidential successors]].  Because Secretary Callister agreed with ARIIA's abort recommendation regarding Balochistan, he is to be the [[designated survivor]] and new [[president of the United States|president]] after the crystal detonates at the [[State of the Union]] (SOTU).\n\nAnother of ARIIA's agents extracts Rachel from the Pentagon and gives her a dress and the explosive necklace to wear to the SOTU.  Sam's school band has also been redirected to the [[United States Capitol]] to play for the president, bringing the trigger in Sam's trumpet and the explosive together.  Jerry is recaptured by Agent Morgan, who has become convinced of Jerry's innocence.  Before sacrificing himself to stop an armed [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]] sent by ARIIA, Morgan gives Jerry his weapon and ID with which to gain entrance to the Capitol.  Arriving in the [[United States Capitol#House Chamber|House Chamber]], Jerry fires the handgun in the air to disrupt the concert before being shot and wounded by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]].\n\nSometime later, in April 2009, Callister reports that ARIIA has been decommissioned and recommends against building another; the Shaw twins and Agents Perez and Morgan receive awards for their actions; and Jerry attends Sam's birthday party, earning Rachel's gratitude and a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Jerry Shaw/Ethan Shaw\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Rachel Holloman, a woman who is being coerced by ARIIA.\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as the voice of the super computer ARIIA, aka the \"unknown woman\".\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Zo\u00eb Perez, an [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations|Air Force Office of Special Investigations]] (OSI) Agent.\n* [[Michael Chiklis]] as George Callister, the [[United States of America|US]] [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Major William Bowman\n* [[Ethan Embry]] as Toby Grant, an [[FBI]] agent.\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Tom Morgan, an [[FBI]] agent.\n* Anthony Azizi as Ranim Khalid\n* [[Cameron Boyce]] as Sam Holloman, Rachel's son.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rosario Dawson receiving a safety briefing from Special Agent Patrick McGee.jpg|thumb|Rosario Dawson receiving a safety briefing from Special Agent Patrick McGee while researching her role as an AFOSI agent.]]\nScreenwriter Dan McDermott wrote the original script for ''Eagle Eye'' based on an idea by [[Steven Spielberg]], who had been inspired by [[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story \"[[All the Troubles of the World]].\"<ref>[http://sundaytimes.lk/081207/TV/sundaytvtimes_06.html \"'Eagle Eye': Action thriller with wonders of technology\"], The Sunday Times</ref> The studio [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] then bought McDermott's script and set up the project to potentially be directed by Spielberg.
