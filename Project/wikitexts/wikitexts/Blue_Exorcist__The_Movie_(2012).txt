The film is produced by [[A-1 Pictures]] and directed by Atsushi Takahashi from a [[Screenplay|script]] written by [[Reiko Yoshida]]. It follows [[Rin Okumura]] meeting a demon boy, who is connected to the ongoing festival at True Cross Academy.\n\nThe film was announced in September 2011, with Takahashi and Yoshida helming it in March 2012, and stars [[Nobuhiko Okamoto]], [[Jun Fukuyama]], [[Kana Hanazawa]], [[Kazuya Nakai]], [[K\u014dji Yusa]], [[Y\u016bki Kaji]], [[Eri Kitamura]], [[Ayahi Takagaki]], [[Rina Sat\u014d]], [[Daisuke Ono]], [[Hiroshi Kamiya]], [[Keiji Fujiwara]], [[Rie Kugimiya]], and [[Hidenobu Kiuchi]].\n\n''Blue Exorcist: The Movie'' was released in Japan on December 28, 2012, and in the United States on August 17, 2013. The film grossed over {{USD|5|long=no}}{{nbsp}}million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nCenturies ago, a demon lived in a small village and gained the sympathy of the villagers. As they left their land unattended to spend time with the demon, the villagers lost all of their goods. An exorcist then arrived to permanently seal the demon and protect the village again.\n\nIn the present day, preparations for a festival, which is celebrated every 11 years, are ongoing around True Cross Campus Town. [[Rin Okumura]] and his brother [[Yukio Okumura|Yukio]], and [[List of Blue Exorcist characters#Shiemi Moriyama|Shiemi Moriyama]] are sent on a mission to exorcise the \"Phantom Train\" that got lost control after Rin and Shiemi tried to save the ghosts that are unconsciously trapped inside. After the fight, one of the demons inside the Phantom Train escapes. Rin later encounters the little demon with a child-like appearance and names it [[List of Blue Exorcist characters#Usamaro|Usamaro]]. Usamaro is taken by the exorcists, but Rin opposes their decision to exorcise him so they give him the duty to look after the demon instead. Usamaro is revealed to be a benevolent [[kami]] that became a demon after suffering the pain of being betrayed and abandoned by the villagers he cared for and had used his power to erase the bad memories from their minds to make everyone live through happiness. While living with Rin, Usamaro uses his power to make him and his other exorcists his friends and forget about their tasks of protecting the town during the festival.\n\nAs a result, the town is infested with demons. During these circumstances, Rin discovers Usamaro's power and learns that he is the same demon of the tale his father, [[List of Blue Exorcist characters#Shiro Fujimoto|Shiro Fujimoto]], shared with him and Yukio when they were only children. Thanks to their friendship, Rin helps Usumaro understand how valuable memories are, even the painful ones, and makes him promise to never use his power again, to which the little demon agrees. Although he is accepted by Rin as part of his family, Usamaro decides to sacrifice himself due to the demons taking control of the city, breaking his promise. In the end, everyone seems to forget about Usamaro's existence and the chaos that occurred during the festival, but Rin seems to remember Usamaro and will visit his temple, promising him that he will never forget him.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
