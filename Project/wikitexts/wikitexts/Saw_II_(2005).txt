It is the sequel to 2004's ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and the second installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' film series]]. The film stars [[Donnie Wahlberg]], [[Franky G]], [[Glenn Plummer]], [[Beverley Mitchell]], [[Dina Meyer]], [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]], [[Erik Knudsen]], [[Shawnee Smith]], and [[Tobin Bell]]. In the film, a group of ex-convicts are trapped by the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]] inside a house and must pass a series of deadly tests to retrieve the antidote for a [[nerve agent]] that will kill them in two hours.\n\nAfter the immensely successful opening weekend of 2004's ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', a sequel was immediately [[Green-light|green-lit]]. Whannell and [[James Wan]] were busy preparing for their next film and were unable to write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called ''The Desperate'' before ''Saw'' was released and was looking for a producer but many studios rejected it. [[Gregg Hoffman]] received the script and showed it to his partners [[Mark Burg]] and [[Oren Koules]]. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into ''Saw II''. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.\n\n''Saw II'' was released in the United States on October 28, 2005, by [[Lions Gate Films]]. It opened with $31.9 million and grossed $88 million in the United States and Canada. It has remained the highest grossing ''Saw'' film in those countries. Bell was nominated for \"Best Villain\" at the [[2006 MTV Movie Awards]] for his role as Jigsaw in the film. ''Saw II'' was released to [[DVD]] on February 14, 2006, and topped charts its first week, selling more than 3 million units. At the time, it was the fastest-selling theatrical DVD in Lions Gate's history. A sequel, titled ''[[Saw III]]'', was released in 2006.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nPolice informant [[List of Saw characters#Michael Marks|Michael Marks]] awakens in a room with a spike-filled mask locked around his neck. He refuses to retrieve the key from his eye and is killed when the mask closes. At the scene of Michael's murder, Detective [[List of Saw characters#Allison Kerry|Allison Kerry]] finds a message for her former partner, Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]]. Matthews joins Kerry and Officer [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Daniel Rigg]] in leading a [[SWAT]] team to the factory which produced the lock from Michael's trap. There they apprehend John Kramer, the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]], who indicates computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house, including his only known survivor [[Amanda Young]], Matthews' son [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel]], and six other victims: [[List of Saw characters#Xavier Chavez|Xavier Chavez]], [[List of Saw characters#Jonas Singer|Jonas Singer]], [[List of Saw characters#Laura Hunter|Laura Hunter]], [[List of Saw characters#Addison Corday|Addison Corday]], [[List of Saw characters#Obi Tate|Obi Tate]], and [[List of Saw characters#Gus Colyard|Gus Colyard]]. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them all within two hours, but John assures Matthews that if he follows the rules of his own game, he will see Daniel again. At Kerry's urging, Matthews agrees to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal. During their conversation, John reveals to Matthews that one of his main motivations to become Jigsaw was a suicide attempt after his cancer diagnosis, which led to a newfound appreciation for life; his games' purpose is to help his victims develop the same appreciation.\n\nThe group is informed by a [[microcassette]] recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; one is in the room's safe, and the tape provides a cryptic clue. Gus ignores a warning note and uses the key provided with the cassette on the door, which triggers a gun through the peephole that kills him. Once the door opens, they search the house and find a basement, where Obi, who helped with abducting the other victims, is killed in a furnace trap while trying to retrieve two antidotes. In another room, Xavier's test involves digging through a pit filled with syringes to retrieve a key to a steel door in two minutes, but he instead throws Amanda into the pit. She retrieves the key, but Xavier fails to unlock the door in time. Throughout the game, the group discuss connections between them and determine that each has been incarcerated before except Daniel. During his father's test, John reveals their affiliation to Matthews who was a [[Police corruption|corrupt police officer]] framing his suspects in various crimes recently.\n\nXavier returns to the safe room and finds a number on the back of Gus' neck. After realizing the numbers are the combination for the safe, he kills Jonas and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent and dies, after finding the clue revealing Daniel's identity. Incensed by the revelation, Addison leaves on her own and finds a glass box containing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the openings which are lined with hidden blades. Xavier enters the room and leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel from the first room leading to the [[dilapidated]] bathroom.{{refn|name=Timeline1|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]''.}} After Xavier corners them, Amanda taunts him by implying that he will not learn his number because nobody will read it to him. Xavier responds by cutting off a piece of skin from the back of his neck to read his number. Xavier charges them, and Daniel slits his throat with the [[hacksaw]].\n\nHaving seen Xavier chasing his son, Matthews assaults John and forces him to lead him to the house. The tech team tracks the video's source and while Rigg's team searches the house, Kerry realizes that the game took place days before they captured John until the timer for Matthews' game expires to reveal Daniel inside a safe, bound and breathing in an oxygen mask. Unaware of these events, Matthews enters the house alone and makes his way to the bathroom, where he is subdued by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe and finds a tape recorder left by Amanda, who reveals she had become John's accomplice after surviving her first trap and helped him set up Matthews' test during the game at the house, intending to continue John's work after he dies. Amanda then appears and seals the door, leaving Matthews to die as John hears his screams outside and smiles.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|topic=the cast and characters|List of Saw (franchise) cast members|List of Saw characters|label1=List of Saw cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer / Jigsaw]]\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as [[Amanda Young]]\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Detective Eric Matthews]]\n* [[Erik Knudsen]] as Daniel Matthews\n* [[Franky G]] as Xavier Chavez\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as Jonas Singer\n* [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] as Addison Corday\n* [[Beverley Mitchell]] as Laura Hunter\n* Timothy Burd as Obi Tate\n* [[Dina Meyer]] as Detective Allison Kerry \n* [[Lyriq Bent]] as Officer Daniel Rigg\n* [[Noam Jenkins]] as Michael Marks\n* [[Tony Nappo]] as Gus Colyard \n* Kelly Jones as SWAT Member Pete\n* Vincent Rother as SWAT Member Joe\n}}\n\nArchival audio of [[Cary Elwes]], [[Leigh Whannell]], and [[Michael Emerson]], as Dr. Lawrence Gordon, Adam Stanheight, and Zep Hindle respectively are heard in the film as well.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n[[File:Saw two banned poster.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The original teaser poster showing two bloody severed fingers that was banned by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].]]\n''Saw II'' was immediately [[green-light]]ed after ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]''{{'}}s successful opening weekend a year earlier.<ref name=\"IGNFeb2005\">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/586/586613p1.html |title=IGN Interviews James Wan and Leigh Whannell |last=Otto |first=Jeff |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |date=February 9, 2005 |access-date=August 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212164031/http://movies.ign.com/articles/586/586613p1.html |archive-date=February 12, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Producers needed a script for a sequel <ref name=\"FilmMonthly\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/Profiles/Articles/LeighWhannell/LeighWhannell.html \n |title=Leigh Returns to the Saw \n |last=Fischer \n |first=Paul \n |work=Film Monthly \n |date=October 26, 2005 \n |access-date=August 22, 2011 \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325022511/http://www.filmmonthly.com/Profiles/Articles/LeighWhannell/LeighWhannell.html\n |archive-date=March 25, 2012\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref> but [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]], director and writer of ''Saw'', were working on [[Universal Pictures]]'s ''[[Dead Silence]]''.

In order for this to be done safely, four people, over a period of four days, removed the needle tips from syringes and replaced them with fiber optic tips. They modified a total of 120,000 fake needles. However, this number was insufficient and the pit had to be filled with styrofoam and other materials to make it appear to have more needles. The needles that were apparently stuck into Smith were actually blunted syringes stuck into padding under her clothing. For certain shots, a fake arm was used.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[David Hackl]] (production designer), Jim Murray (property master), Darren Lynn Bousman (writer/director) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Needle Pit |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Darren Lynn Bousman CC.JPG|thumb|right|''Saw II'' was Bousman's first feature film.]]\nBousman came up with an idea whereby a character's hands would get stuck in some sort of vessel, and this resulted in the \"Hand Trap\". It proved to be a challenge, but after much discussion, Hackl, property master Jim Murray and art director Michele Brady came up with a suitable design. They arranged a glass box suspended by chains from the ceiling which contained a hypodermic needle with the antidote and which had two hand-holes on the underside. As soon as [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]]'s character Addison Corday puts her hands into the holes, razor blades would close in on her hands, and any attempt to withdraw from the trap would cause her to bleed to death. In order for the trap to be used safely, the prop builders made the handcuffs move inside the box and fake blades that would retract from the actress's hands, thus allowing her to slide her hands out. Hackl subsequently commented that the character did not have to put her hands into the trap, as there was a lock with a key on the other side of the box that would have opened the contraption.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://machinedesign.com/article/how-to-engineer-a-nightmare-1023 |title=How to Engineer a Nightmare |last=Shapiro |first=Jessica |journal=[[Machine Design]] |volume=80 |issue=20 |pages=22\u201323 |date=October 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405024728/http://machinedesign.com/article/how-to-engineer-a-nightmare-1023 |archive-date=April 5, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite video |people=David Hackl (production designer) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Hand Trap |medium=DVD |publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nThe original idea for the \"Furnace Trap\" came from the house having been a [[Crematory|crematorium]] at some point, but this would have involved turning the house into a funeral parlor, so it was instead decided that the furnace would be part of the house's boiler system. The furnace was visualized in the form of a computer model so that Bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed. Using the computer model as a guide, the furnace was constructed in three days using cement board and tin with removable sides and top so Timothy Burd's character Obi Tate could be filmed crawling inside. The furnace produced real flames and, in place of Burd, a [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] using a fire retardant gel crawled into the fire.<ref>{{cite video |people=David Hackl (production designer) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Furnace |medium=DVD |publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums -->\n| name         = Saw II: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = various artists\n| cover        =\n| caption      =\n| alt          = \n| released     = {{Start date|2005|10|25}}\n| recorded     = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = {{hlist|[[Industrial metal]]|[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]|[[alternative metal]]|[[nu metal]]}}\n| length       = {{Duration|m=54|s=46}}\n| label        = [[Image Entertainment]]\n| producer     = {{hlist|[[Mark Burg]] <small>([[Executive producer|{{abbr|exec.|executive producer}}]])</small>|[[Gregg Hoffman]] <small>(exec.)</small>|[[Oren Koules]] <small>(exec.)</small>|Jonathan Platt|Jonathan Scott Miller|Martin Shore|Stu Song}}\n| prev_title   = [[Saw (soundtrack)|Saw: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]\n| prev_year    = 2004\n| next_title   = [[Saw III (soundtrack)|Saw III: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]\n| next_year    = 2006\n| misc         = \n}}\nThe ''Saw II'' soundtrack was released on October 25, 2005 by [[RLJE Films|Image Entertainment]].<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> The video for \"[[Forget to Remember]]\" was also directed by Bousman.<ref>{{cite video|title=Saw II Commentary|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]|people=Darren Lynn Bousman, Donnie Wahlberg and Beverly Mitchell|date=2006|time=1:29:11\u2013 1:29:13}}</ref>\n\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = \n| extra_column = Artist\n| title1 = Irresponsible Hate Anthem (Venus Head Trap Mix)\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Scott Putesky|Daisy Berkowitz]]|[[Madonna Wayne Gacy]]|[[Marilyn Manson]]|[[Twiggy Ramirez]]}}\n| extra1 = [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]\n| length1 = 3:39\n| title2 = Sound Effects and Overdramatics\n| writer2 = {{hlist|[[Quinn Allman]]|[[The Used|Jeph Howard]]|[[Bert McCracken]]|[[Branden Steineckert]]}}\n| extra2 = [[The Used]]\n| length2 = 3:28\n| title3 = [[Forget to Remember]]\n| writer3 = {{hlist|[[Chad Gray]]|[[Ryan Martinie]]|[[Matthew McDonough]]|[[Greg Tribbett]]}}\n| extra3 = [[Mudvayne]]\n| length3 = 3:33\n| title4 = September\n| writer4 = {{hlist|Chris Hamilton|Mike Kennedy|Nick Rowe|[[Hellyeah|Kyle Sanders]]|Tim Williams}}\n| extra4 = [[Bloodsimple]]\n| length4 = 3:38\n| title5 = Blood (Empty Promises)\n| writer5 = {{hlist|[[Papa Roach|Dave Buckner]]|[[Papa Roach|Tobin Esperance]]|[[Jerry Horton]]|[[Jacoby Shaddix]]}}\n| extra5 = [[Papa Roach]]\n| length5 = 2:56\n| title6 = REV 22:20 (REV 4:20 Mix)\n| writer6 = {{hlist|[[Maynard James Keenan]]|[[Danny Lohner]]}}\n| extra6 = [[Puscifer]]\n| length6 = 4:47\n| title7 = [[Next (Sevendust album)|Pieces]]\n| writer7 = [[Sevendust]]\n| extra7 = [[Sevendust]]\n| length7 = 3:06\n| title8 = Rodent (Ken \"Hiwatt\" Marshall/DDT Mix)\n| writer8 = {{hlist|[[Al Jourgensen]]|[[Skinny Puppy]]}}\n| extra8 = [[Skinny Puppy]]\n| length8 = 5:00\n| title9 = [[Burn the Witch (Queens of the Stone Age song)|Burn the Witch]] ([[Unkle|UNKLE]] Variation)\n| writer9 = {{hlist|[[Joey Castillo]]|[[Josh Homme]]|[[Troy Van Leeuwen]]}}\n| extra9 = [[Queens of the Stone Age]]\n| length9 = 3:04\n| title10 = Holy\n| writer10 = {{hlist|Shaun Bivens|Tony Providence|Allen Richardson}}\n| extra10 = [[A Band Called Pain]]\n| length10 = 3:43\n| title11 = [[Enter the Chicken#Three Fingers|Three Fingers]]\n| writer11 = {{hlist|Buckethead|[[Dan Monti]]|[[Saul Williams]]}}\n| extra11 = [[Buckethead|Buckethead and Friends]] & [[Saul Williams]]\n| length11 = 3:00\n| title12 = Home Invasion Robbery\n| writer12 = [[The Legion of Doom (mash up group)|The Legion of Doom]]\n| extra12 = [[The Legion of Doom (mash up group)|The Legion of Doom]]\n| length12 = 4:10\n| title13 = Caliente (Dark Entries)\n| writer13 = {{hlist|[[Daniel Ash]]|[[Kevin Haskins]]|[[David J]]|[[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]]}}\n| extra13 = [[Revolting Cocks]], [[Gibby Haynes]] & [[Al Jourgensen]]\n| length13 = 4:28\n| title14 = Step Up\n| writer14 = {{hlist|Andrew Gerold|[[Jim Kaufman]]|[[John Travis (producer)|John Travis]]|[[Ron Underwood (musician)|Ron Underwood]]}}\n| extra14 = [[Opiate for the Masses]]\n| length14 = 3:24\n| title15 = Don't Forget the Rules\n| writer15 = [[Charlie Clouser]]\n| extra15 = [[Charlie Clouser]]\n| length15 = 5:00\n| total_length = 54:46\n}}\n\nThe film's score was released on October 25, 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} In November 2017, Lakeshore Records released a two-volume compilation album of music from all eight ''Saw'' films.
