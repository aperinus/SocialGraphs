The film was awarded the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI Prize]] at the 1998 [[Cannes Film Festival]] for \"its bold tracking of controversial contemporary themes, richly-layered subtext, and remarkable fluidity of visual style,\" and the cast received the [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|National Board of Review]] award for best [[Ensemble cast|ensemble performance]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147612/awards \"''Happiness'' \u2013 Awards\"].

She is married to [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]] Bill Maplewood and has three children. Trish is unaware of Bill's secret life: he is a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] who is obsessed with 11-year-old Johnny Grasso, a classmate of their son, Billy. When Johnny comes to the Jordan house for a sleepover, Bill drugs and [[rape]]s him. Later, Bill learns that another boy, Ronald Farber, is home alone while his parents are away in [[Europe]]. Under the guise of attending a [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] meeting, Bill drives to the boy's house and rapes him, as well. After Johnny is taken to the hospital and found to have been [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused]], the police arrive at the Maplewood residence to question Bill and his wife. Bill, out of guilt, mistakenly asks the officers if this is about Ronald Farber, even though the police only mentioned Johnny's name when they arrived, inadvertently implicating himself in an as-yet unknown crime. The next morning the family awakens to the words \"serial rapist\" and \"pervert\" spray painted on their house. After school, Billy questions his dad about the things being said at school, and Bill admits that he molested the boys, that he enjoyed it, and that he would do it again. When Billy asks if he would ever molest him, his father tearfully replies, \"No... I'd jerk off, instead.\" Trish packs her family into the car the next morning, leaving for her parents' condo in Florida, leaving the audience to presume Bill is going to prison.\n\nHelen Jordan, the middle sister, is a successful author who is adored and envied by everyone she knows, and can have any man she wants. However, her charmed life leaves her ultimately unfulfilled, she despairs that no one wants her for herself, and that the praise regularly heaped upon her is undeserved. She is fascinated by an unknown man who makes obscene phone calls to her apartment and tries to seek out a relationship with him. She is disappointed, though, when she finds out the man is her neighbor Allen, to whom she is not attracted. Allen, who is coincidentally one of Bill's patients, sinks into depression as Helen's rejection ruins his fantasies, but he begins a relationship with Kristina, who lives in the same apartment block down the hall. While on a date, Kristina tells him that she killed the apartment doorman after he raped her. Although Allen is still content with her friendship after she confided this in him, Helen reveals that the genitals of the doorman were discovered by police less than six months later in Kristina's freezer.\n\nJoy, the youngest sister, is overly sensitive and lacking direction. She works in telephone sales, but leaves to do something more fulfilling - teaching at an immigrant-education center. Her students do not like her, and she begins to feel empty in that job, too. Joy is also constantly let down in her personal life. After a rejected suitor, Andy, calls Joy shallow at the beginning of the film and then goes on to kill himself, Helen tries to set her up with other men. Expecting to hear from a suitor, she instead gets an obscene call from Allen. Later, one of her [[Russian people|Russian]] students, Vlad, offers her a ride in his taxi, and they end up having sex. She is initially smitten, but she soon realizes Vlad was using her and that he may be married. After being attacked by someone she thinks is his wife at the school, she goes to his apartment to make amends, but discovers she is not his wife after all, even though they live together and have some sort of relationship. In the apartment she sees her missing guitar and CD player, and insists on getting them back, and he coerces her into lending him $500 in exchange. She is back to being alone.\n\nFinally, the sisters' parents, Mona and Lenny, are separating after 40 years of marriage, but will not get divorced. Lenny is bored with his marriage, but does not want to start another relationship; he simply \"wants to be alone.\" As Mona copes with being single during her twilight years, Lenny tries to rekindle his enthusiasm for life by having an affair with a neighbor. It is no use, however, as Lenny eventually finds that he has become [[Anhedonia|incapable of feeling]]. The only person who attains happiness is Billy, who finally achieves an [[orgasm]] for the first time. He proudly declares this to his family, who respond with confusion.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jane Adams (actress, born 1965)|Jane Adams]] as Joy Jordan\n* [[Elizabeth Ashley]] as Diane Freed\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Bill Maplewood\n* [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] as Helen Jordan\n* [[Ben Gazzara]] as Lenny Jordan\n* [[Jared Harris]] as Vlad\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Allen\n* [[Louise Lasser]] as Mona Jordan\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Andrew \"Andy\" Kornbluth\n* [[Camryn Manheim]] as Kristina\n* Rufus Read as Billy Maplewood\n* [[Cynthia Stevenson]] as Trish Jordan Maplewood\n* Justin Elven as Timmy Maplewood\n* Lila Glantzman-Leib as Chloe Maplewood\n* [[Gerry Becker]] as psychiatrist\n* [[Arthur J.

In a film that looks into the abyss of human despair, there is the horrifying suggestion that these characters may not be grotesque exceptions, but may in fact be part of the mainstream of humanity.... It is not a film for most people. It is certainly for adults only.
