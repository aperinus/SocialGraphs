It was produced by [[Martin Bregman]].\n\nThe film is based on the 1997 [[Crime fiction|crime novel]] [[The Bone Collector (novel)|of the same name]] written by [[Jeffery Deaver]], concerning the [[tetraplegic]] detective Lincoln Rhyme. The film received mixed reviews, and earned about $150 million against a budget of $48 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1998 [[New York City]], quadriplegic [[Forensic science|forensics]] expert Lincoln Rhyme is bed-bound after an accident that left him completely paralyzed from the neck down. Amelia Donaghy, a newly recruited patrol officer, discovers a mutilated corpse buried at a [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era railroad bed. Due to clue-like objects found at the crime scene, Rhyme concludes that the scene was staged and subsequently teams up with an initially hesitant Amelia, impressed by her natural forensic instincts.\n\nThe killer poses as a taxi driver and, before Rhyme and Amelia met, abducts married couple Alan and Lindsay Rubin. Alan is the body discovered by Amelia at the railroad station, while Lindsay is revealed to be alive and tied up at a steam junction. Using the clues found at the railroad bed, including a torn piece of scrap paper, Rhyme successfully tracks the whereabouts of Lindsay. The detectives and Amelia arrive too late and she is [[scalding|scalded]] to death by an open steam pipe. Amelia finds a piece of Lindsay's bone by her body and another scrap of paper. Rhyme instructs Amelia to sever Lindsay's hands, which are securely chained to the pipe, for evidence but she refuses and storms off from the crime scene.\n\nThe killer abducts an [[New York University|NYU]] student, who is taken to a derelict [[slaughterhouse]] and tied to a pole. The killer surgically removes a piece of bone from the student, leaving an open wound that attracts nearby rats. Amelia and Rhyme, again using the clues left by the killer at the scene of the previous murder, find the victim's body which has been mutilated by rats. Amelia finds another scrap of paper and a piece of bone. The pressure of the tense investigation and [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] challenges to Amelia and Rhyme's involvement in the case begin to have serious impacts on Rhyme's health and stability. Thelma, Rhyme's carer and nurse, reveals to Amelia that he intends to [[Euthanasia|euthanize]] himself out of fear of seizures that could leave him in a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]].\n\nAfter piecing together the message the killer was sending using the scrap paper left at each scene, Amelia and Rhyme are led to an old crime novel called ''The Bone Collector'', where it is revealed the killer is replicating the crimes from the fictional story. This leads them to the killer's next victims, a grandfather and granddaughter who have been tied to a pier during a rise in tide. The paramedics successfully resuscitate the young girl, but the grandfather is pronounced dead. At the scene, Amelia finds another piece of bone, part of an old police badge, and a subway map. These clues together with the [[asbestos]] left by the killer at the scene of Lindsay's death lead Amelia to an abandoned subway station, where she sees numbers on the side of a carriage that has been tampered with to spell out Rhyme's police badge number.\n\nThe killer arrives at Rhyme's house and kills both Thelma and Police Captain Howard Cheney. The killer is revealed to be Richard Thompson, the medical technician in charge of Rhyme's medical equipment. Richard's real name is Marcus Andrews, a former forensics expert, who was convicted after Rhyme wrote an article accusing him of planting evidence resulting in the wrongful imprisonment of six innocent people, one of whom hanged himself. Blaming Rhyme for his imprisonment and the abuse he endured during his incarceration, he attempts to kill Rhyme out of revenge. Rhyme retaliates by crushing Marcus' hand in his medical bed, resulting in a struggle between the two that forces them both onto the floor. Unable to move, Rhyme is almost killed by Marcus until Amelia arrives and shoots Marcus dead.\n\nThe following [[Christmas]], Rhyme, having abandoned his plans to commit suicide, meets his sister and niece coming to visit him along with Amelia and his other colleagues.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Lincoln Rhyme\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as Amelia Donaghy\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Thelma\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Captain Howard Cheney\n* [[Mike McGlone]] as Detective Kenny Solomon\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Eddie Ortiz\n* [[Leland Orser]] as Richard Thompson/Marcus Andrews\n* [[John Benjamin Hickey]] as Dr. Barry Lehman\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Amelia's boyfriend\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as Detective Paulie Sellitto\n}}\n\n==Production==\nExterior and interior scenes were filmed in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145681/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt |title=The Bone Collector (1999) - Filming & Production - IMDb |website=www.imdb.com |access-date=6 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220512001338/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145681/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt |archive-date=12 May 2022 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Critical reception===\nBased on 86 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Bone Collector'' has an average approval rating of 29%, with an average score of 4.2/10.
