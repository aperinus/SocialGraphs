An off-beat romance, it tells the story of a troubled young woman who in error starts telling her problems not to a psychiatrist but to a lonely tax consultant in the office next door.\n\n==Plot==\nWilliam, a reserved and solitary tax consultant in Paris, is surprised when a distressed young woman comes into his office and starts telling him her marital problems. Her name is Anna and her appointment was in fact with Dr Monnier, a psychiatrist on the same floor. Before William can clear up the misunderstanding, she says she will come again next week and leaves. The next time, she gives even more intimate details and William again fails to make clear that he can only handle her tax problems.\n\nWhen she does not reappear in the following weeks, William worries if she is alright and consults Dr Monnier. The shrink guesses where his interest lies and does not interfere. William also confides in his former partner Jeanne who, as a woman, quickly guesses what Anna is up to. Anna does come back to William's office and a strange relationship develops, where she tells tales of her life and sexual activities while he listens sympathetically. Her husband appears and threatens William, who is not deterred.\n\nEventually Anna, who has been getting less neurotic and taking more care of her appearance, tells William she is leaving her husband and moving away. He wishes her well. A few months later, he moves his business to the south coast, where he has discovered she is working as a ballet teacher. Anna arrives at William's office and lays on the bed in the office, and William starts telling Anna his problems .....\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandrine Bonnaire]] as Anna\n* [[Fabrice Luchini]] as William\n* [[Michel Duchaussoy]] as Dr. Monnier\n* [[Anne Brochet]] as Jeanne\n* [[Gilbert Melki]] as Marc\n* [[Urbain Cancelier]] as Chatel\n* [[Laurent Gamelon]] as Luc\n* H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Surg\u00e8re as Mrs. Mulon\n\n==Release==\nThe film was shown in competition at the 2004 [[Berlin Film Festival]].\n\n; USA release\n[[Paramount Vantage|Paramount Classics]] acquired the [[United States]] distribution rights of this film and gave it a limited [[United States|U.S.]] theatrical release on July 30, 2004; this film went on grossing $2.1 million in the [[United States]] theaters,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363532/business |title=Box office / business for Intimate Strangers (2004) |publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=8 December 2014}}</ref> which is considered a good result for a foreign language film.<ref>{{Cite web |date= |author= Anthony Kaufman |title= At A Popular Annual Showcase in New York, Considering French Cinema's Identity Crisis |url= https://www.indiewire.com/biz/biz_050316world.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807171055/http://www.indiewire.com/biz/biz_050316world.html |archive-date=August 7, 2007 }}</ref> Ruth Vitale (who was the president of Paramount Classics at that time) was pleased with this film's performance in the [[United States]] market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/markets-festivals/foreign-language-fare-lost-in-b-o-translation-1117949618/|title=Foreign-language fare lost in B.O. translation|work=Variety|access-date=8 December 2014|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109030327/http://variety.com/2006/film/markets-festivals/foreign-language-fare-lost-in-b-o-translation-1117949618/|archivedate=9 January 2016}}</ref> [[Paramount Pictures]] (the parent studio of [[Paramount Vantage|Paramount Vantage/Classics]]) was developing a comedic Hollywood remake of the film, with [[Hilary Swank]] attached to star and [[Kelly Fremon Craig]] writing the script.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1 |title=Advertisement |work=Variety |access-date=8 December 2014 |archive-date=25 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325224413/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 86% based on reviews from 104 critics.
