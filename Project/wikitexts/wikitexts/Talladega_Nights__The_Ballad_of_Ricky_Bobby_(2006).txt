The film also features [[John C. Reilly]], [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Leslie Bibb]], [[Jane Lynch]], and [[Amy Adams]] in supporting roles. NASCAR drivers [[Jamie McMurray]] and [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] appear in cameos, as do broadcasting teams from ''[[NASCAR on Fox]]'' ([[Mike Joy]], [[Larry McReynolds]], [[Darrell Waltrip]], and [[Dick Berggren]]) and ''[[NASCAR on NBC]]'' ([[Bill Weber]], [[Wally Dallenbach Jr.]], and [[Benny Parsons]]).\n\nThe film was released theatrically on August 4, 2006, through Sony Pictures to critical and commercial success, grossing $163.4 million worldwide on a $72 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn rural [[North Carolina]], Ricky Bobby is a man who grew up dreaming of going fast. Born in the backseat of a racing car on country roads while his father, Reese, accidentally missed the turnoff for the hospital due to driving too fast, Bobby grew up not knowing his father, only seeing him once at age 10 where he was kicked out of Bobby's school for inappropriate behavior. During this encounter, Bobby's father told him \"If you [[ain't]] first, you\u2019re last\", advice which Bobby takes to heart. Fifteen years later, while working on the pit crew of Dennit Racing driver Terry Cheveaux, Bobby acts as a replacement driver after Terry decides to take a bathroom break while in last place. After finishing third in the race, Bobby gains a permanent seat at Dennit and quickly becomes one of NASCAR's most successful drivers. While racing, he meets his future wife Carley, after she flashes her breasts to him.\n\nYears after becoming an [[NASCAR]] superstar, Bobby persuades Dennit Racing to field a second team for his best friend Cal Naughton Jr. Bobby and Naughton become an unstoppable duo on the track, but are soon introduced to their new teammate, openly [[homosexuality|gay]] [[French people|French]] [[Formula One]] driver Jean Girard. Girard soon outperforms both Bobby and Naughton to become Dennit Racing's latest success story. Desperate to win, Bobby exceeds his limitations and crashes at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Lowe's Motor Speedway]]. His declining performance subsequently gets him fired from his team; furthermore, Carley divorces him and leaves him for Naughton, causing Bobby to fall into depression and falling out with Naughton, despite the latter still calling Bobby his best friend and frequently calling to do social activities.\n\nBobby moves in with his mom Lucy, and brings his two disrespectful sons Walker and Texas Ranger with him while taking a job as a [[pizza delivery]] man. His luck worsens when he loses his driver's license after colliding with a woman pushing a shopping cart and hitting a police officer, reducing Bobby to riding the bus or a bicycle to deliver pizzas. Meanwhile, Lucy is determined to reform her grandsons.\n\nWhen his life hits rock bottom, Bobby's estranged father Reese returns to remind him how to drive, using unorthodox methods such as putting a live [[cougar]] in his car, and forcing him to escape the police. When his father leaves him again after causing trouble at an [[Applebees]] restaurant, Bobby's former assistant Susan persuades him to return to NASCAR, since it is in his nature to drive fast. They quickly develop a romantic relationship when Bobby takes Susan's advice and races at [[Talladega Superspeedway]]. Bobby makes amends with Carley, Girard, and Naughton, while uniting with his pit crew chief and close friend Lucius Washington. With limited sponsors, Bobby's car is painted with a cougar to remind him of his passion. At the start of the race, Bobby flies from last place to pass all of the drivers except Girard. In the closing laps, Naughton uses a slingshot technique for Bobby to pass Girard.\n\nIn the closing laps of the race, the replacement driver of Bobby's former car causes [[The Big One (NASCAR)|a massive wreck]] that takes out the field, except Bobby and Girard. On the final lap, Bobby and Girard collide, wrecking their cars. Bobby and Girard exit their cars and begin running towards the finish line. Bobby reaches the line first, however both are disqualified for getting out of their cars. As Naughton takes the checkered flag, Girard offers Bobby a handshake, but Bobby responds by kissing him on the lips. Carley asks Bobby to move back in with her and start over, but he chooses to stay with Susan instead. At the end of the event, Bobby is congratulated in the parking lot by Reese; Bobby declares that it was no longer about winning, knowing that he has a family who loves him no matter where he finishes. He, his family and Susan leave to go back to Applebees.\n\nIn a post credits scene, Grandma Lucy is shown reading a story to Walker and Texas Ranger, both having fully been disciplined by her and are now presented as polite, respectful children.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Ricky Bobby, a [[NASCAR]] driver who only believes in winning throughout his career.

Shortly after the filming of that film had completed, co-producer Jimmy Miller invited the two to a NASCAR race in [[Fontana, California]], after which the two began initial writing of the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2006/talladega_nights.htm|title=Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006)|date=July 26, 2014|website=Made in Atlantis|language=en-US|access-date=August 19, 2019}}</ref> The two presented the idea to studios using only a six-word pitch: \"Will Ferrell as a NASCAR driver\". Studios, responded enthusiastically to the pitch largely due to the recent commercial success of Ferrell as a comedic leading man in films like ''Elf'', ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'' and ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy|Anchorman]]''. After a bidding war by studios, the rights to the film were won by Sony Pictures. McKay and Ferrell knew that in order to create the film in the way in which they desired, they would need cooperation from NASCAR. Following a meeting with NASCAR executives, NASCAR agreed to provide assistance for the film's production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2006-07-30-0608010379-story.html|title=With film, NASCAR steers itself into Hollywood|last=Dunne|first=Susan|date=July 30, 2006|website=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|language=en-US|access-date=August 19, 2019}}</ref> While writing the script, McKay and Ferrell sought to make a film that individuals involved with NASCAR would enjoy, in the same way in which people in the television news industry did with the pairs previous film Anchorman, with Ferrell stating \"We were real adamant up front that our goal wasn't to make fun of NASCAR. We wanted to have fun with NASCAR.\" Despite NASCARS involvement with the film, many teams and drivers were reluctant to participate in the film largely due to the negative feelings those in the sport had for the 1990 film [[Days of Thunder]], with drivers fearing the movie would be similar to Thunder. The only two drivers who did end up making cameos in the film were [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] and [[Jamie McMurray]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.espn.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/17218225/nascar-talladega-nights-10-oral-history | title='Talladega Nights' at 10: An oral history | date=August 4, 2016 }}</ref> During development, the films title changed from Talladega Nights to \"High, Wide and Handsome\" before eventually reverting back to the original title.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2005/10/02/nascar-tosses-crew-chief-out-for-violations/ | title=NASCAR tosses crew chief out for violations }}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nWith the exception of one week of shooting at [[Talladega Superspeedway]] in [[Alabama]], the entire film was filmed in [[North Carolina]] with the majority of filming occurring in the [[Charlotte metropolitan area|Charlotte Metropolitan Area]]. Many of the racing scenes were filmed at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]] and [[Rockingham Speedway]] also known as The Rock. Various other scenes were filmed in the [[Gaston County, North Carolina]] area, including the Pizza Delivery, DMV Driving Test, and Church Choir scenes. The Pizza Delivery sequence began in Downtown [[Cramerton, North Carolina]] and concluded at the ''Midtown Motor Inn'' in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]]. Both the DMV Driving Test and the Church Choir scenes were filmed on the campus of First Baptist Church in Cramerton, North Carolina.

His car turned backwards, went airborne, bounced off and crushed [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]]'s hood, flew into the catch fence, and came to a stop on the track apron. At this point, his car was just beyond the pit-road exit, as Keselowski and [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] crossed the finish line. Edwards climbed out of his car and jogged to the finish line. He received a standing ovation from the crowd. Fox play-by-play commentator [[Mike Joy]] commented on how it was \"shades of Ricky Bobby.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8weUponX6Y|title=2009 Spring Talladega Final Lap - Edwards Crash|last=Kris Durbin|date=April 26, 2009|access-date=February 10, 2018|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}{{Dead Youtube links|date=February 2022}}</ref>\" Although Edwards did cross the finish line but on his feet, he was still handed a DNF since his car did not cross the line and Edwards finished in 24th.
