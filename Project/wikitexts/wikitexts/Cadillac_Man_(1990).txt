In addition, he has an outstanding loan to a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] [[Boss (crime)|don]] which he must either quickly repay, or lose his life.\n\nOn the day of the big dealership car sale (and the final day of O'Brien's deadline), the car dealership is taken [[hostage]] by Larry, an [[AK-47]]-toting motorcyclist who believes his wife is cheating on him. Joey manages to talk Larry out of doing any harm by claiming he is the one sleeping with Larry's wife. As police surround the dealership, Joey and Larry begin to bond, and Joey convinces Larry to give himself up. Without realizing Larry's gun is not loaded, the police wound him after most of the hostages have already been released. Joey promises to remain with him while he recovers, and confesses that he'd never actually slept with Larry's wife. The crisis solves all of Joey's problems: his mistresses learn of each other and dump him, his daughter returns, his job is secure, the Mafia don (whose son was among the hostages) forgives his debt, and he begins to reconcile with his ex-wife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Joey O'Brien \n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Larry\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Tina\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Donna, Larry's Wife\n* [[Fran Drescher]] as Joy Munchack, Joey's Married Mistress\n* [[Zack Norman]] as Harry Munchack\n* [[Lori Petty]] as Lila, Joey's Single Mistress\n* [[Paul Guilfoyle]] as Jack \"Little Jack\" Turgeon\n* Bill Nelson as Jack \"Big Jack\" Turgeon\n* [[Eddie Jones (actor)|Eddie Jones]] as Benny\n* Mimi Cecchini as Ma\n* [[Tristine Skyler]] as Lisa\n* [[Judith Hoag]] as Molly\n* [[Lauren Tom]] as Helen, The Dim Sum Girl\n* Anthony Powers as Captain Mason\n* [[Paul Herman]] as Tony DiPino\n* [[Erik King]] as Davey\n* Richard Panebianco as Frankie DiPino\n* [[Gary Howard Klar]] as Detective Walters\n* [[Elaine Stritch]] as Widow (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n\nTo prepare for his role in the film Williams spent time in car dealerships in Queens, New York.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-05-09-ca-373-story.html \"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-05-09-ca-373-story.html\"</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was not a box office success, although it did turn a profit.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Recall' Totally Outdistances 'Future' in Box-Office Race Movies|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |url= https://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-05/entertainment/ca-641_1_box-office| accessdate=2010-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 12 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cadillac_man|title=Cadillac Man|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=October 28, 2022}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gives it a score of 50 out of 100 based on 21 critic reviews.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cadillac-man | title = Cadillac Man | website= [[Metacritic]] }}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"B\u2212\" on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 |access-date= 2019-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nCritic [[Roger Ebert]] had mixed feelings about the film, giving it a two out of four stars, stating, \"My problems with ''Cadillac Man'' were probably inspired more by false expectations than by anything on the screen, and maybe if Robbins had come crashing in through the window in the first scene I would have liked it more.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cadillac-man-1990 |title= Cadillac Man (1990) Review |first= Roger|last= Ebert |author-link= Roger Ebert |date=May 18, 1990 |accessdate=January 31, 2019 }}{{rating|2|4}}</ref> Bril. of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' thought it had \"the distinction of being the loudest film of 1990 and one of the worst.\"<ref name=varrev>{{cite magazine|title= Film Reviews: Cadillac Man|magazine= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 16, 1990|page=26|author=Bril.}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0099204|Cadillac Man}}\n* {{Amg movie|7802|Cadillac Man}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|cadillac_man|Cadillac Man}}\n* {{Mojo title|cadillacman|Cadillac Man}}\n*{{AFI film|id=58440|title=Cadillac Man}}\n\n{{Roger Donaldson}}\n\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American business films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Cadillac]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Roger Donaldson]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Charles Roven]]\n[[Category:Films set in Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:Films about hostage takings]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:Films about car dealerships]]\n[[Category:Films scored by J.
