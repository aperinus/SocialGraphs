Based on the 1967 [[Topaz (novel)|novel of the same title]] by [[Leon Uris]], the film is about a French intelligence agent (Stafford) who becomes entangled in [[Cold War]] politics before the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and then the breakup of an international Soviet spy ring.\n\nThe story is loosely based on the 1962 [[Sapphire Affair]],<ref name=\"time\">{{cite magazine |date=April 26, 1968 |title=France: The Sapphire Affair |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,838289,00.html |url-status=live |magazine=Time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607181444/http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,838289,00.html |archive-date=June 7, 2017 |access-date=March 8, 2013}}</ref> which involved the head of France's [[Service de Documentation Ext\u00e9rieure et de Contre-Espionnage|SDECE]] in the United States, the spy Philippe Thyraud de Vosjoli, a friend of Uris,<ref name=\"time\" /> who played an important role in \"helping the U.S. discover the presence of Russian offensive missiles in Cuba.\"<ref name=\"time\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Copenhagen]] in 1962, a high-ranking [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intelligence officer, Boris Kusenov, defects to the West. During debriefing, [[CIA]] agent Mike Nordstrom learns that Soviet missiles with nuclear warheads will be placed in Cuba.\n\nNeeding physical evidence, Nordstrom discloses Kusenov's name to French agent Andr\u00e9 Devereaux and asks him to bribe Luis Uribe, a member of Cuba's UN delegation, to provide photographs of documents that confirm the missile bases in Cuba. Devereaux decides to accompany his daughter, Mich\u00e8le, on her honeymoon to [[New York City]] with his son-in-law, Fran\u00e7ois Picard.\n\nIn New York City, French agent Philippe Dubois is to contact Uribe, who is the secretary to Cuban official Rico Parra, who is staying at the [[Hotel Theresa]] in [[Harlem]] to show solidarity with the black community.\n\nDubois sneaks into the hotel and bribes Uribe to take the documents from Parra's office to photograph. Parra catches Dubois photographing the documents. Chased and shot at by Cuban revolutionaries, Dubois purposefully knocks into Devereaux, who is watching events from the other side of the street, and slips him the camera. A red-headed Cuban guard helps Devereaux to get up but lets him go. Dubois escapes into the crowd around the hotel.\n\nDubois's photos confirm that the Soviets are placing missiles in Cuba. Devereaux, despite his wife's accusations of infidelity, flies to Cuba. His mistress, Juanita de Cordoba ([[Karin Dor]]), was the widow of a \"hero of the Revolution,\" which enables her to work undercover in the resistance. Upon his arrival, Devereaux finds Parra, another of her lovers, leaving Juanita's mansion. Devereaux asks Juanita to take photographs of the missiles. Juanita's loyal domestic staff, Carlotta and Pablo Mendoza, pose as picnickers and photograph the missiles. Pursued, the two hide the incriminating film  before they are captured.\n\nDuring a mass rally and a lengthy speech by the ''l\u00edder m\u00e1ximo'', the red-headed Cuban guard recognises Devereaux's face from the New York City incident.\n\nParra has heard from the tortured Carlotta Mendoza that Juanita is their leader. He embraces her and shoots her dead to save her from extreme torture.\n\nAt the [[Havana airport]], the Cuban authorities fail to find the microfilms that Deveraux has. He returns to find that his wife has left him. Devereaux is to be recalled to Paris. Kusenov tells him about the existence of a Soviet spy organisation, \"Topaz,\" within the [[list of intelligence agencies of France|French intelligence service]]. He is given the name of [[NATO]] official Henri Jarr\u00e9, who leaked documents to the [[KGB]].\n\nIn Paris, he is picked up at the airport by his daughter and his son-in-law. Mich\u00e8le brings to a cocktail Jacques Granville, an old friend of Andr\u00e9. Mich\u00e8le hopes that her parents will get along, but Nicole cannot forgive Andr\u00e9's affair with Juanita. Andr\u00e9 and Mich\u00e8le stay alone, and Jacques complains the agent Martin that Nicole married Andre.\n\nDevereaux researches the leak and invites some of his old friends and colleagues, including Jarr\u00e9, to a lunch at a fine Paris restaurant under the pretext of helping Devereaux prepare for his inquiry. Devereaux tells the others about Topaz to provoke some reaction. Jarr\u00e9 claims that it is misinformation and that Kusenov died a year ago.\n\nJarr\u00e9 starts to panic and visits the leader of the spy ring, Jacques Granville. Devereaux, Nicole, and Granville were close friends from their days together during the [[French Resistance]]. Granville tells Jarr\u00e9 that it was a mistake to say Kusenov was dead since the Americans will easily discover that Jarr\u00e9 lied. As Jarr\u00e9 leaves Granville's house, Devereaux's wife arrives to meet Granville, her lover.\n\nDevereaux sends his son-in-law, Fran\u00e7ois, to interview Jarr\u00e9. Devereaux and Mich\u00e8le rush to Jarr\u00e9's flat and find Jarr\u00e9 dead, which is a staged suicide, and Fran\u00e7ois has disappeared. After being clubbed and kidnapped, Fran\u00e7ois managed to escape from his captors' car with an overheard phone number.\n\nNicole tells her family with tearful eyes that since the phone number is Granville's, he must be the leader of Topaz. Granville, exposed, commits suicide (in the American and the French versions) or flees to the Soviet Union (in the British version).\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Frederick Stafford]] as Andr\u00e9 Devereaux\n* [[Dany Robin]] as Nicole Devereaux\n* [[Karin Dor]] as Juanita de Cordoba\n* [[John Vernon]] as Rico Parra\n* [[Claude Jade]] as Mich\u00e8le Picard\n* [[Michel Subor]] as Fran\u00e7ois Picard\n* [[Michel Piccoli]] as Jacques Granville\n* [[Philippe Noiret]] as Henri Jarr\u00e9\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as Philippe Dubois\n* [[Per-Axel Arosenius]] as Boris Kusenov\n* [[John Forsythe]] as Michael Nordstrom\n* [[Edmon Ryan]] as McKittreck\n* Sonja Kolthoff as Mrs. Kusenov\n* [[Tina Hedstr\u00f6m]] as Tamara Kusenov\n* [[John van Dreelen]] as Claude Martin\n* [[Donald Randolph]] as Luis Uribe\n* [[Roberto Contreras]] as Mu\u00f1oz\n* [[Carlos Rivas (actor)|Carlos Rivas]] as Hernandez\n* [[Roger Til]] as Jean Chabrier\n* Lewis Charles as Pablo Mendoza\n* [[S\u00e1ndor Szab\u00f3 (actor)|S\u00e1ndor Szab\u00f3]] as Emile Redon\n* [[Anna Navarro]] as Carlotta Mendoza\n* Lew Brown as American Official\n* John Roper as Thomas\n* George Skaff as Ren\u00e9 d'Arcy\n;Uncredited\n* [[Ann Doran]] as Mrs Foryth\n* [[Eva Wilma]] as Rosita Gomez\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\n[[Shel Talmy]] and William Piggott Brown first tried to option the film rights to [[Leon Uris]]'s novel for $500,000 in 1967, but the deal was halted by the [[Bank of England]] because of the [[Devaluation#1967 devaluation|1967 devaluation]] of the [[pound sterling]]. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] first hired Uris to adapt his own novel for the screen five months later. Afterwards Philippe de Vosjoli filed a lawsuit against Uris, [[Universal Pictures]], and [[MCA Inc.|MCA Inc]] claiming that they had stole the plot for the novel and film from his unpublished manuscript ''Le reseau Topaz''.  De Vosjoli and Uris settled out of court with a deal that would give Uris full rights to the profits from the film but gave de Vosjoli half of the profits from the novel.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/23628-TOPAZ?cxt=filmography|access-date=2021-10-02|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\nReportedly, Hitchcock and Uris differed on aspects of character development, with Hitchcock claiming that Uris had not humanised the villains of the story. Uris also did not appreciate Hitchcock's insistence on adding [[black humour]]. After a portion of the draft had been written, Uris left the film. Hitchcock attempted to hire [[Arthur Laurents]] to complete the work on the screenplay, but he refused, leaving an unfinished draft while the shooting schedule was rapidly approaching. Ultimately, [[Samuel A. Taylor]], cowriter of ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', was hired, but the film began without a completed screenplay. Some scenes were written only hours before they were filmed.<ref name=\"tcm-article\">{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Frank |title=Topaz (1969) |work=Turner Classic Movies |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/93636/Topaz/articles.html |access-date=March 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock changed the script shortly before the beginning of filming, and the distributor, Universal, forced an ending that was different from the one that was preferred by Hitchcock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/wiki/The_Times_(27/Jan/1970)_-_The_Times_Diary:_Topaz_trio|title=The Times (27/Jan/1970) - The Times Diary: Topaz trio - The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki|website=www.hitchcockwiki.com|access-date=29 July 2017}}</ref> For ''Topaz'', Hitchcock engaged the 19-year-old French actress [[Claude Jade]] from Truffaut's ''[[Stolen Kisses]]''. She and [[Dany Robin]], who was cast as her mother, would provide the glamour in the story. \"Jade is a rather quiet young lady,\" Hitchcock later said, \"but I wouldn't guarantee [that] about her behaviour in a taxi.\"\n\n===Production===\nLike his previous films ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' and ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'', Hitchcock intended the film to be an experiment for whether colours, predominantly red, yellow and white, could be used to reveal and to influence the plot. He later admitted that it did not work out.<ref name=\"tcm-article\"/>\n\nProduction began on September 25, 1968, and concluded at the beginning of March 1969.<ref name=\":0\" /> Portions of ''Topaz'' were filmed on location in [[Copenhagen]]; [[Wiesbaden]], [[West Germany]]; [[Virginia]], [[Paris]], [[New York City]], and [[Washington, DC]].<ref name=\"tcm\">{{cite web|title=Topaz Notes |work=Turner Classic Movies |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/93636/Topaz/notes.html |access-date=March 9, 2013}}</ref> The remainder of the film was shot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and in and around [[Los Angeles]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nPrior to Hitchcock's decision to hire [[Maurice Jarre]] to compose the score, other composers who were interested in offering their services included [[Michel Legrand]], [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], and [[Ravi Shankar]].<ref name=sullmain>[[Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)|Sullivan, Jack]] (2006).

At the airport, he is seated in a wheelchair as he is being pushed by a nurse. She stops, and he nonchalantly stands and greets a man and proceeds to walk off screen with him.\n\n===Alternate versions and endings===\nThe original cut of the film ended with a duel between Andr\u00e9 and Jacques in a French football stadium. It was shot by associate producer Herbert Coleman when Hitchcock had to return to the United States for a family emergency. Audiences panned the ending during test screenings. They also said the film was far too long.\n\nUnder pressure from the studio, Hitchcock shot a second ending that he actually liked better, with Jacques escaping on an [[Aeroflot]] flight to the Soviet Union as Andr\u00e9 and Nicole board their adjacent [[Pan Am]] flight back to the United States. However, the ending apparently confused audiences. Also, screenwriter Samuel Taylor objected to the villain escaping unpunished, and there were fears that the ending would offend the French government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Topaz_(1969)#The_Alternative_Endings|title=Topaz (1969) - The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki|website=the.hitchcock.zone|access-date=29 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs a compromise, Hitchcock used existing footage to create a third ending in which Granville is exposed and expelled from a NATO meeting. Over a shot of the exterior of his apartment, the sound of a gunshot tells that he commits suicide behind his drawn curtains since no footage of his suicide existed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hitchcock's Music |author=Sullivan, Jack |pages=296}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released with this third ending and was also edited down by nearly 20 minutes to a final length of 127 minutes. The \"airport ending\" briefly appeared on British prints of the film by mistake, but those prints were soon altered to match the version that was released elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Topaz_(1969)#Post-Production|title=Topaz (1969) - The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki|website=the.hitchcock.zone|access-date=29 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe 143-minute cut of the film was released for the first time by Universal on DVD in 1999; it used the second ending in which Jacques escapes. All three endings appear as extras on the DVD, together with an \"Appreciation\" by [[Leonard Maltin]] in which Maltin discusses the deleted scenes and the alternate endings.\n\nThe longer version of the film has been released numerous times on DVD and Blu-ray in the US and in many other markets. However some markets, like Germany, Japan and Scandinavia, continue to have the shorter theatrical cut on DVD and Blu-ray.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Topaz_(1969)#DVD_and_Blu-ray_Releases|title=Topaz (1969) - The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki|website=the.hitchcock.zone|access-date=29 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Topaz wounded Subor Jade Robin.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Jade]], [[Michel Subor]], and [[Dany Robin]] in ''Topaz'']]\n\n===Box office===\n''Topaz'' earned $3.8 million in box office [[gross rental|rentals]] from the United States and Canada in 1970.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Big Rental Films of 1970 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 6, 1971 |page=11}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reaction===\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' placed the film on his year-end list of the ten best films of 1969 and declared it a \"huge success, a quirky, episodic espionage tale made rich and suspenseful, not through conventional Hitchcockian narrative drive, but through odd, perverse Hitchcockian detail, economy of cinematic gesture, and an over-all point of view that can never for a moment be mistaken as belonging to anyone but Hitchcock.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/12/28/archives/the-ten-best-of-1969-movies.html |date=December 28, 1969 |title=The Ten Best of 1969 |work=[[The New York Times]] |pages=D1, D13 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' also liked the film and wrote that although there was a \"loss of momentum\" at the climax because of the time taken to resolve the complex plot, the first three quarters of the film were \"bravura displays of the fabled Hitchcock technique, replete with dazzling camera movements and acute imagery.\" Thomas singled out the Harlem sequence as among \"the best that Hitchcock has ever done.\"<ref>[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Thomas, Kevin]] (December 19, 1969). \"'Topaz': A Spy Adventure by Hitchcock\".

Some attribute Hitchcock's casting choices to his negative experience of working with [[Paul Newman]] on ''[[Torn Curtain]]'', but Hitchcock is said to have approached [[Sean Connery]], who had worked with him in ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', for Andr\u00e9 and [[Catherine Deneuve]] for his wife. Some critics{{weasel inline|date=May 2012}} have inferred that Hitchcock was hoping to groom the relatively-unknown Frederick Stafford as a star of his own making, like [[Tippi Hedren]]; however, Stafford remained unknown in Hollywood though he had a lengthy career in European films.\n\nIn 1969, Hitchcock won the [[National Board of Review Awards 1969|Best Director Award]] for ''Topaz'' from the [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|National Board of Review]].\n\n''Topaz'' had its American network television premiere on ''[[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]]'' on January 29, 1972.
