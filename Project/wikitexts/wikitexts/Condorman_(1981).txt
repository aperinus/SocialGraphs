The movie follows comic book illustrator Woodrow Wilkins's attempts to assist in the defection of a female [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]] agent.\n\n== Plot ==\nWoodrow \"Woody\" Wilkins is an imaginative, yet [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], comic book writer and illustrator who demands a sense of realism for his comic book hero \"Condorman\", to the point where he crafts a Condorman flying suit of his own and launches himself off the [[Eiffel Tower]]. The test flight fails as his right wing breaks, sending him crashing into the [[Seine River]]. Later after the incident, Woody is asked by his friend, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] file clerk Harry, to perform what appears to be a civilian paper swap in [[Istanbul]]. Upon arriving in Istanbul, he meets a beautiful Soviet woman named Natalia Rambova, who poses as the Soviet civilian with whom the exchange is supposed to take place, but it is later revealed that she is in fact a [[KGB]] spy. Woody does not tell Natalia his real name, and instead fabricates his identity to her as a top American agent code-named \"Condorman\". During the encounter, Woody fends off a group of would-be assassins and saves her life by sheer luck before accomplishing the paper trade. Impressed by Woody, and disgusted by how she was treated by her lover/boss Krokov when she returns to Moscow, Natalia decides to defect and asks the CIA to have \"Condorman\" be the agent that helps her.\n\nBack in Paris, Woody's encounter with Natalia inspires him to create a super heroine patterned after her named \"Laser Lady\". He is then notified by Harry and his boss Russ that he is to escort a defecting Soviet agent known as \"The Bear\". Woody refuses to do the job, but  when Russ reveals that \"The Bear\" is Natalia, he agrees to do it on the condition that the CIA provides him with gadgetry based on his designs.\n\nWoody meets up with Natalia in [[Yugoslavia]] and protects her from Krokov's henchmen led by the homicidal, glass-eyed assassin Morovich. After joining Harry in Italy, the trio venture to Switzerland, where Natalia discovers the truth about Woody when a group of children recognize her from his comic books. Their journey back to France is compromised when Morovich puts Woody and Harry out of commission and Krokov's men recover Natalia before retreating to their headquarters in [[Monte Carlo]]. Woody is told that the mission is a failure and he and Harry are ordered to return to Paris, but Woody asks Harry for two more days to conduct an operation to rescue Natalia.\n\nDisguising themselves as Arab sheiks, Woody and Harry create a diversion at the [[Monte Carlo Casino]] to recover Natalia from Krokov and his men. As Harry drives away in a Rolls-Royce, Woody uses an improved version of his Condorman suit to fly himself and Natalia out of the casino and onto the pier, where the trio make their getaway aboard the Condorboat. They manage to destroy Krokov's speedboats following them, but Krokov and Morovich pursue them in their own speedboat. The Condorboat reaches its pick-up point, but Morovich shows his intent on ramming it. When Morovich ignores his commander's orders to return to base, Krokov abandons ship. The Condorboat is lifted by the CIA helicopter in time to prevent a collision, causing Morovich to crash on an island rock.\n\nDays later, Woody, Natalia and Harry are at [[Dodger Stadium]] in Los Angeles, where they see the [[Goodyear Blimp]] flash a sign welcoming Natalia to the U.S. Aboard the blimp, Russ contacts Harry and has him ask Woody if he is interested in taking Condorman to another assignment.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Michael Crawford]] as Woodrow \"Woody\" Wilkins\n* [[Barbara Carrera]] as Natalia Rambova\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as Krokov\n* [[James Hampton (actor)|James Hampton]] as Harry\n* [[Jean-Pierre Kalfon]] as Morovich\n* [[Dana Elcar]] as Russ\n* [[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as Russian agent\n* [[Robert Arden]] as CIA Chief\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n''Condorman'' was inspired by ''The Game of X'' by [[Robert Sheckley]], a novel published in 1965.

[[R\u00e9my Julienne]], a renowned French stunt driver whose previous work included ''[[The Italian Job]]'' and a number of [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' films]] among more than a hundred others, coordinated the film's car chases and stunts. Julienne, who mostly worked in French productions, kept a high standard for the film's set pieces involving cars, stating that \"You recognize a good [car chase] because it is fresh and surprising. A bad one reminds you of a hundred you have seen before.\" The film's special effects were directed by [[Colin Chilvers]], who previously worked on the first two ''[[Superman in film#Christopher Reeves film series (1978\u20131987)|Superman]]'' films starring [[Christopher Reeve]]. The effects were filmed at the location also used by Chilvers for the ''Superman'' films: [[Pinewood Studios]]. Using the same facilities meant efficiency for Chilvers to create the effects he desired, reusing the equipment from ''Superman'' and adapting it for ''Condorman''. A problem Chilvers encountered was being unable to fit the mold used by Reeve to Michael Crawford, requiring him to make a new set of molds for Crawford. He also enforced a strict [[gag rule]] among his 12-man crew to never disclose the methods used to create the effects after the film's release, asking \"[w]hy do audiences need to know how each effect is done? It lessens their enjoyment of the movie.\"<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltij1bseo1I |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/ltij1bseo1I |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=VLOG: Going Through the Condorman Pressbook|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=1 September 2014|accessdate=26 July 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe film did poorly at the box office.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Harmetz|first1=Aljean|authorlink1=Aljean Harmetz|title=HOLLYWOOD IS JOYOUS OVER ITS RECORD GROSSING SUMMER|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/09/movies/hollywood-is-joyous-over-its-record-grossing-summer.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=10 October 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 September 1981}}</ref> Disney reportedly lost $9.5 million on the picture.<ref>'{{cite news|title=Revised $1 Million Worth, Tries Again: '7/8 of a Good Picture' Release Is Regional|first= ALJEAN|last= HARMETZ|newspaper=The New York Times| date=October 20, 1981|page= C9}}</ref> The disappointing financial returns from ''Condorman'', along with three other flop films, contributed to Disney's poor financial performance in 1981.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Disney Net Dropped 7% for Fourth Period, 10% for Fiscal 1981|magazine=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date= November 6, 1981|page= 24}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was heavily panned by critics when it premiered in 1981.

On the other hand, John Corry of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a favorable review of the film, calling it \"painless and chaste, and it has a lot of beautiful scenery and beautiful clothes.
