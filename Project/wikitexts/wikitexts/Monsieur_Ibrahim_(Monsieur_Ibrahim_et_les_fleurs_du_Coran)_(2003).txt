The protagonist, ''Mo\u0457se Schmidt'' (Momo), is a young [[Jew]]ish boy growing up without a mother and with a father afflicted by crippling [[clinical depression|depression]]. Momo is fascinated by the elderly [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Muslim]] man, Ibrahim Demirci ({{IPA-tr|demi\u027e\u02c8d\u0292i}}), who runs a grocery store across the street from his [[apartment]] (where Momo often shoplifts). Their relationship develops and soon Momo feels closer to Ibrahim than to his father. Ibrahim affectionately calls Mo\u0457se Momo, and [[adopt]]s him when his father leaves and commits [[suicide]]. Momo and Ibrahim go on a journey in their new car (a [[Simca Aronde|Simca Aronde Oc\u00e9ane]]) to [[Turkey]], Ibrahim's native country, where Momo learns about Ibrahim's culture. At the end of their adventure, Ibrahim is killed in a car crash and Momo returns to Paris to take over the shop.\n\n==Cast==\n*Monsieur Ibrahim &ndash; [[Omar Sharif]]\n*Momo &ndash; [[Pierre Boulanger]]\n*Momo's father &ndash; [[Gilbert Melki]]\n*Momo's mother &ndash; [[Isabelle Renauld]]\n*Myriam &ndash; [[Lola Naymark]]\n*Sylvie &ndash; [[Anne Suarez]]\n*Fatou &ndash; [[Mata Gabin]]\n*Eva &ndash; [[Celine Samie]]\n*The Movie Star &ndash; [[Isabelle Adjani]]\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n* [[C\u00e9sar Award]], Best Actor 2004: Omar Sharif\n* [[Chicago International Film Festival]], Silver Hugo for Best Male Performance 2003: Pierre Boulanger\n* [[Venice International Film Festival]], Audience Award, Best Actor 2003: Omar Sharif\n\nAlso nominated for several awards, including the 2004 [[Golden Globe]] for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sufism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title}}\n*{{Amg movie|289403|Monsieur Ibrahim}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n*{{Metacritic film}}\n*{{mojo title|id=monsieuribrahim|title=Monsieur Ibrahim}}\n*[http://www.sonyclassics.com/ibrahim/home.html Sony website for Monsieur Ibrahim]\n*[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L9hhizfYdRgC&pg=PA174&dq=%22idries+shah%22+%22A+certain+bektashi+dervish%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjTi4SJhP_MAhVFuhoKHbFPA-oQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=%22idries%20shah%22%20%22A%20certain%20bektashi%20dervish%22&f=false \"What is in it\"], a related Sufi tale from [[Idries Shah]]'s ''[[Wisdom of the Idiots]]''\n\n{{Fran\u00e7ois Dupeyron}}\n\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 drama films]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actor C\u00e9sar Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Fran\u00e7ois Dupeyron]]\n[[Category:Films about race and ethnicity]]\n[[Category:Films based on multiple works]]\n[[Category:Islamic and Jewish interfaith dialogue]]\n[[Category:Sufism]]\n[[Category:French drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
