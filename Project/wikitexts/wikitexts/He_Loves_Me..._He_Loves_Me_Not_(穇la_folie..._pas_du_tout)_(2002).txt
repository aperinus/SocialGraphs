He Loves Me Not''''' ({{lang-fr|'''\u00c0 la folie... pas du tout'''}}) is a 2002 [[Cinema of France|French]] psychological [[drama]] film directed by L\u00e6titia Colombani. The film focuses on a [[fine arts]] student, played by [[Audrey Tautou]], and a married [[cardiologist]], played by [[Samuel Le Bihan]], with whom she is dangerously obsessed. The film studies the condition of [[erotomania]] and is both an example of the [[nonlinear narrative|nonlinear]] and \"[[unreliable narrator]]\" forms of storytelling.\n\nThe title refers to the last two lines of the French game of [[He loves me... he loves me not|''Effeuiller la Marguerite'']] (Fr., \"to pluck the daisy\") of pulling petals off a flower, in which one seeks to determine whether the object of their affection returns that affection and to what extent: ''un peu'' (\"a little\"), ''beaucoup'' (\"a lot\"); ''passionn\u00e9ment'' (\"passionately\"): '''''\u00e0 la folie''''' (\"to madness\"); '''''pas du tout''''' (\"not at all\").\n\n==Plot==\nAng\u00e9lique ([[Audrey Tautou]]), a successful art student, purchases a single pink rose at a flower shop to be delivered to her lover, Dr. Lo\u00efc Le Garrec ([[Samuel Le Bihan]]). In between creating her art projects, Ang\u00e9lique works part-time at a cafe and house-sits for a wealthy vacationing family. Her friend David ([[Cl\u00e9ment Sibony]]) disapproves of her affair with Lo\u00efc, who is married, but she insists that Lo\u00efc will leave his wife for her.\n\nWhen Lo\u00efc's wife, Rachel ([[Isabelle Carr\u00e9]]), has a [[miscarriage]], the pair separate and Ang\u00e9lique prepares to leave with Lo\u00efc on a romantic getaway to [[Florence]]. However, Lo\u00efc does not meet Ang\u00e9lique at the airport, having chosen to mend things with his wife. This throws Ang\u00e9lique into a self-destructive cycle of [[clinical depression]], losing her job and scholarship. While watching the news one night, she learns that Lo\u00efc has been arrested for assaulting one of his patients, Sonia Jasmin (Nathalie Krebs). She goes to Sonia's house to convince her to drop the charges and, in the ensuing scuffle, Sonia has a heart attack and dies. Thinking this will win Lo\u00efc back, Ang\u00e9lique steals from the house to make it look like a robbery. Instead, Lo\u00efc is arrested for Sonia's murder. Ang\u00e9lique, after witnessing Lo\u00efc embrace his wife as he is dragged away, returns home, turns on the gas oven, and lies down on the floor to commit [[suicide]].\n\nAt this point the film rewinds to the opening scene when Ang\u00e9lique bought the pink rose. This time the film follows the delivery boy and the subsequent events play out from Lo\u00efc's viewpoint.\n\nLo\u00efc receives the pink rose and assumes that his wife sent it to him. It is revealed that Lo\u00efc barely knows Ang\u00e9lique and that they cross paths only because Ang\u00e9lique is [[house-sitting]] for Lo\u00efc and Rachel's neighbor. Lo\u00efc receives Ang\u00e9lique's gifts and messages but does not know who sent them. It is revealed that Rachel's miscarriage was caused by \"someone\" running her down with a [[moped]]; earlier in the film, Ang\u00e9lique is shown having suffered an \"accident\" that ruined her friend's moped and injured her arm. Lo\u00efc comes to believe that his stalker is Sonia; he physically attacks her and she presses charges for assault. After she dies of a heart attack, Lo\u00efc is arrested as the [[prime suspect]] for her murder. After his arrest, Rachel tells the police that he was with her on the night of the death, which clears him of all charges.\n\nThat night, Lo\u00efc sees an ambulance pull up to his neighbor's house after Ang\u00e9lique tries to kill herself. As a doctor, he performs [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]], which causes her to regain consciousness. Now aware of her, he considers the possibility that she is his stalker. Exploring the house that she was house-sitting, he finds a life-sized garbage [[mosaic]] of himself. Lo\u00efc and Ang\u00e9lique have a final confrontation, in which he declares that they never had, nor ever will have, a relationship. Ang\u00e9lique strikes him over the head with a brass figurine and he falls down the stairs. Ang\u00e9lique is arrested, diagnosed with [[erotomania]], and remanded to a [[mental institution]]. Rachel stands by her husband while he recovers from his injuries, and several years later the couple are shown at a house with their young children as Lo\u00efc hobbles around with a walker.\n\nFive years after the attack, Ang\u00e9lique is released from the mental institution. Her therapist praises her progress and tells her, \"If you keep taking your medication, you will be fine\". However, when the cleaning man is clearing Ang\u00e9lique's room, he discovers her pills have been glued to the wall behind the wardrobe in a [[mosaic]] of Lo\u00efc, thus showing that Ang\u00e9lique has never taken her medication, and is still obsessed with Lo\u00efc. The film then ends with a quotation from a real erotomaniac: \"Though my love is insane, my reason relieves the pain of the heart, telling me to be patient and not lose hope.\"\n\n==Production==\nIn a 2003 [[BBC]] interview,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/11/01/audrey_tautou_dirty_pretty_things_interview.shtml | title= Audrey Tautou: ''He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not'' and ''Dirty Pretty Things'' | date= October 2003| publisher= BBC | access-date=2010-10-10}}</ref> actress Audrey Tautou commented on working with director Laetitia Colombani: \"I found her very precise. She knew exactly what she wanted. Even though she's very young, she managed to control the whole production. She knew her subject\u2013this strange kind of madness\u2013very well because she had studied it for a very long time.\"\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe film, repeatedly compared by film critics with ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'', received an overall very positive reaction, holding a 73% Fresh (i.e., positive) rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes| id=he_loves_me_he_loves_me_not|title=He Loves Me...He Loves Me Not}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, [[Mick LaSalle]] noted it was the \"first feature from 26-year-old Laetitia Colombani and represents about as assured a debut as they come. The first smart thing, of many, that Colombani does is cast Audrey Tautou in the lead role. Tautou has made several movies, but in America she is known for only one, ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'', in which she played a wide-eyed innocent. Here she is just as wide-eyed, but if she's innocent it's only by reason of insanity. ''He Loves Me...He Loves Me Not'' has its own charms, but part of its wicked kick is that it's the anti-''Am\u00e9lie'', presenting romantic fixation, not as noble and sweet, but objectively, as something selfish and volatile....[the film is] driven by a shrewd vision and, beneath its cool French surface, a well-placed sense of moral indignation. Tautou could not be better: She's infuriating &mdash; as well as emotionally present every moment onscreen.\"<ref>{{cite web| title= Tautou gets scary in ''He Loves Me''| url= http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-02-14/entertainment/17477754_1_laetitia-colombani-samuel-le-bihan-angelique | date= February 14, 2003| author=Mick LaSalle| author-link=Mick LaSalle| publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | access-date=2010-10-10}}</ref> [[Richard Schickel]] called Colombani a \"terrifically assured filmmaker\" whose \"twice-told tale\" is the \"basis for an intricately ironic, darkly witty movie with a twist ending that is both utterly surprising and utterly right\"; in a comparison with Tautou's performance in ''Am\u00e9lie'', the film \"displays a more dangerous kind of innocence with a charm that shades off into obsessive madness in very gentle, persuasive increments.
