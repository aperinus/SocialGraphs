The film was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film tells the story of the Rowan family and their experiences as seen through the eyes of the son, Billy (Sebastian Rice-Edwards).\n\n''Hope and Glory'' was a critical and commercial success; it won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy]] and received five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It also received 13 [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] nominations, winning for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] ([[Susan Wooldridge]]).\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins on 3 September 1939, the day Britain [[World War II|declared war]] on Germany. It tells the story of the Rowan family, Billy, his sisters Sue and Dawn and his parents Grace and Clive, who live in a suburb of London. Clive joins the army, leaving Grace alone to watch over the children. She almost sends Billy and Susie away from London but pulls them back at the last second on the train platform, when she realizes she cannot bear to be apart from them. Thus Billy stays in London for the first years of the war. Seen through the eyes of 10-year-old Billy, the \"fireworks\" provided by [[the Blitz]] (September 1940 \u2013 May 1941) every night are as exciting as they are terrifying and the ruins they leave behind are a fascinating playground for Billy and other boys his age, who are largely unsupervised.\n\nHis family does not see things in quite the same way as the bombs continue to drop but their will to survive brings them closer together. The nightly raids do not provide the only drama, as his older sister Dawn falls for Canadian soldier Bruce, becomes pregnant and finding her life turned upside down, soon discovers the value of her family. When their house burns down (not in an air raid but in an ordinary fire), the family moves to the bucolic [[Thames Tideway|Thames-side]] home of Grace's parents. This provides an opportunity for Billy to spend more time with his curmudgeonly grandfather, who teaches him \"the ways of the river\".\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, [[Winston Churchill]] delivers his famous \"[[Winston Churchill#Turn of the tide: El Alamein and Stalingrad|end of the beginning]]\" speech. Bruce returns from his secret posting and goes AWOL to find Dawn. They are married in the village church; the MPs take him away. That afternoon in the living room, Dawn gives birth to a son, encircled by her family. Billy swoons at the sight. Grace has purchased a house for the family, just down the river, but Billy must go back to London until he can get into the local school. His grandfather drives the miserable boy to his old school, only to find the block filled with screaming, ecstatic children. A stray bomb has destroyed the building, \"Thank you Adolf!\" one boy cries.\n\nRoaring with laughter, his grandfather drives Billy home. The adult Billy recalls, \"In all my life, nothing ever quite matched the  perfect joy of that moment. My school lay in ruins, and the river beckoned with the promise of stolen days\". The credits roll over the river, in its autumnal glory, to their laughter and the music of \"[[Land of Hope and Glory]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll, plus Muir-shown at top of closing credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sarah Miles]] as Grace\n* [[David Hayman]] as Clive\n* [[Derrick O'Connor]] as Mac\n* [[Susan Wooldridge]] as Molly\n* [[Ian Bannen]] as Grandfather George\n* [[Sammi Davis]] as Dawn\n* [[Jean-Marc Barr]] as Bruce\n* Sebastian Rice-Edwards as Bill\n* Geraldine Muir as Sue\n}}\n\nIn addition, the director\u2019s daughter, [[Katrine Boorman]], appears as Charity while his son, [[Charley Boorman]], appears as the downed Luftwaffe pilot.\n\n==Filming locations==\nAccording to [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] host Dave Karger's afterword to an April 2021 broadcast of the film, Boorman re-created the street on which he lived. The million-dollar, 40-acre set was the largest constructed in England since World War II.  The main film set was built on the disused runway at the former [[Wisley Airfield]] in Surrey and other scenes by the river were shot near [[Shepperton Lock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britmovie.co.uk/forums/film-locations/83523-hope-glory.html|title=Interview with Alan Sutton|access-date=17 April 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305031256/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/forums/film-locations/83523-hope-glory.html|archive-date=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Filming also took place in Hightown Road, [[Ringwood, Hampshire|Ringwood]], Hampshire.

In his new, autobiographical film, he has had the inspiration to desentimentalize wartime Britain and show us the Second World War the way he saw it as an eight-year-old. The war frees the Rowans from the dismal monotony of their pinched white-collar lives. He doesn't deny the war its terrors. Yet he gives everything a comic flip. That's the joy of the film: the war has its horrors, but it also destroys much of what the genteel poor like Grace Rowan (Sarah Miles), have barely been able to acknowledge they wanted destroyed. It's like a plainspoken, English variant of the Taviani brothers' ''The Night of the Shooting Stars''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Pauline|last=Kael|author-link= Pauline Kael|title=Hooked|year=1990|pages=367\u2013369|isbn=0-7145-2903-6}}</ref>}}\n\nCritic Emanuel Levy's review was also positive; he wrote: \"Director John Boorman offers a warmly nostalgic view of his childhood in a London suburb during WWII.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=10778 |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 May 2017 |archive-date=8 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208025625/http://emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=10778 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% \"Fresh\" rating based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hope_and_glory|title=Hope and Glory|access-date=19 April 2022|website=Rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Roger Ebert wrote: \"Maybe there is something in the very nature of war, in the power of guns and bombs, that appeals to the imagination of little boys.  Bombers and fighter planes and rockets and tanks are thrilling at that age when you are old enough to understand how they work but too young to understand what they do. John Boorman's ''Hope and Glory'' is a film about that precise season in the life of a young British boy who grows up in a London suburb during World War II. The film is first of all a painstaking re-creation of the period. All of the cars and signs look right, and there are countless small references to wartime rationing, as when the older sister draws seams on her legs to make fake nylons. But after re-creating the period, Boorman also reconstructs the very feeling that was in the air. ''Hope and Glory'' is an enormous success right now in England, where every frame must have its special memories for British audiences. Through American eyes, it is a more universal film, not so much about war as about memory. When we are young, what happens is not nearly as important as what we think happens. Perhaps that's true even when we are not so young.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Hope and Glory movie review & film summary (1987) {{!}} Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hope-and-glory-1987|access-date=2021-01-28|website=Rogerebert.com/|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\n[[Goldcrest Films]] invested \u00a31,288,000 in the film and received \u00a31,665,000 making them a profit of \u00a3377,000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My indecision is final|first1=Jake|last1= Eberts |first2=Terry|last2=Illott|year=1990 |publisher=Faber and Faber|page=656}}</ref>\n\nThe film made \u00a3845,927 in the UK.<ref name=\"org\"/>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
