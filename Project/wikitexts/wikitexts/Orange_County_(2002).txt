It was released on January 11, 2002. The movie was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and produced by [[MTV Films|MTV Productions]] and [[Scott Rudin]]. The movie was directed by [[Jake Kasdan]] and written by [[Mike White (scriptwriter)|Mike White]].\n\n==Plot==\nTeen Shaun Brumder is intelligent but little interested in his education, leading a carefree [[Southern California|SoCal]] lifestyle of [[surfing]] in affluent [[Orange County, California]], drinking, and partying. His best friend Lonny is killed in a surfing accident, leading Shaun to rethink his life. Finding a novel on the beach by Marcus Skinner, it inspires him to become a writer. Upon learning that Skinner is an English professor at [[Stanford University]], Shaun makes it his goal to attend Stanford and study under him.\n\nShaun dramatically improves himself academically, obtaining high grades and [[SAT]] scores and becoming president of his graduating class. Following the advice of his guidance counselor, Ms. Cobb, Shaun applies only to Stanford. This backfires when he is rejected as Ms. Cobb mixed up his [[transcript (education)|transcript]] with a poor student. \n\nReaching out to his wealthy father Bud, who left his family for a much younger woman, Shaun pleads with him to donate to Stanford to increase his chances of acceptance. Disapproving of his dream to becomr a writer, Bud refuses. Shaun's girlfriend Ashley convinces her friend Tanya to get Shaun an interview at his home by Tanya's grandfather, a Stanford board member. Unfortunately, the antics of Shaun\u2019s dysfunctional family members (his [[alcoholic]], emotionally fragile mother Cindy and his dim-witted [[stoner (drug user)|stoner]] brother Lance), cause Shaun's interviewers to storm out in disgust.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort, Ashley and Lance convince Shaun to drive to [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] and plead his case directly to Stanford Admissions Director Don Durkett. By the time they reach campus, the admissions building is closed. While Lance seduces the secretary on duty, Shaun and Ashley find Durkett's home address. There, Shaun impresses Durkett with his real transcript, but Durkett is reluctant to admit him so late in the admissions process. \n\nAfter much groveling, Shaun convinces him to give it a second thought. Disaster strikes again when Ashley confuses Lance's [[MDMA]] for pain relievers, offering Durkett the pills for his headache, getting him [[Substance intoxication|high]]. Shaun, Ashley, and Durkett return to find the Admissions Building on fire, caused by Lance smoking with the receptionist. With Lance wanted for arson, they abandon Durkett and flee the scene.\n\nFrustrated with Shaun's obsession, Ashley points out that his attending Stanford would likely mean the end of their relationship, and she leaves. Depressed, Shaun wanders the campus and meets a female student who invites him to a [[fraternities and sororities|frat party]]. He is disappointed to learn the Stanford [[coed]]s are just as vapid as teenagers from Orange County. \n\nWith a more cynical view of college, Shaun runs into Professor Skinner and is invited to his office. Shaun confides that he is afraid his dreams of being a good writer are over. Skinner reminds him that many famous authors such as [[James Joyce]] and [[William Faulkner]] grew up in places that were not intellectually stimulating, and were inspired by the conflicts in their own lives. Having an epiphany, Shaun realizes his misguided intentions and apologizes to Ashley. They pick up Lance, still hiding from police, and go home.\n\nIn Orange County, Shaun's parents seek each other out to deal with Shaun's problem. They reconcile, realizing they are much happier together than with their respective new spouses, and conclude they have not been good parents to Shaun. To make amends, Bud donates enough money to Stanford for the construction of a new Admissions Building, which secures Shaun\u2019s acceptance. \n\nInitially ecstatic, Shaun remembers what Ashley and Professor Skinner said, and decides to stay in Orange County with Ashley and his family, as they are the true inspiration for his writing. Shaun leaves a copy of Skinner's book at the beach for someone else to find, then surfs with his friends for the first time since Lonny's death.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Colin Hanks]] as Shaun Brumder\n* [[Jack Black]] as Lance Brumder\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Cindy Brumder\n* [[Schuyler Fisk]] as Ashley\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Bud Brumder\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Don Durkett\n* [[Jane Adams (actress, born 1965)|Jane Adams]] as Mona\n* [[Garry Marshall]] as Arthur Gantner\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Vera Gantner\n* [[Carly Pope]] as Tanya\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Principal Harbert\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Charlotte Cobb, College counselor\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Krista\n* [[Bret Harrison]] as Lonny\n* [[Kyle Howard]] as Arlo\n* RJ Knoll as Chad\n* [[George Murdock (actor)|George Murdock]] as Bob Beugler\n* [[Monica Keena]] as Gretchen\n* [[Fran Kranz]] as Shane Brainard\n* [[Mike White (scriptwriter)|Mike White]] as Mr. Burke, English teacher\n* [[Sarah Hagan]] as Sarah\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Party Girl\n* [[Nat Faxon]] as Kip\n* [[Alexandra Breckenridge]] (''uncredited'') as Anna\n* [[Kevin Kline]] (''Uncredited'') as Marcus Skinner\n* [[Ben Stiller]] (''Uncredited'') as The Firefighter\n\n==Reception==\n''Orange County'' was given 3 of 4 stars by Roger Ebert, who described it as, \"one of those happy projects where everything seems to fall naturally into place.
