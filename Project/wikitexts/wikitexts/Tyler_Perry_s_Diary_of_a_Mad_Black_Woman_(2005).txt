It is Perry's debut feature film, and the first entry in the [[Madea]] film franchise with this film also starring [[Kimberly Elise]], [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]], [[Shemar Moore]], and [[Cicely Tyson]]. Directed by [[Darren Grant]], the film was released in the US on February 25, 2005. The film tells the story of a woman who is thrown out of her house by her husband on their 18th wedding anniversary as she moves in with her grandmother. It is the only Tyler Perry scripted film not directed by Tyler Perry. Filming began on July 21, 2004 in [[Atlanta]] and [[Fairburn, Georgia]].\n\nReleased theatrically by [[Lionsgate Films]] on February 25, 2005, ''Diary of a Mad Black Woman'' received generally negative reviews from critics. However, the film was a box office success, grossing $50.7 million worldwide against a $5.5 million budget.\n\nThe [[sequel]], ''[[Madea's Family Reunion]]'', was released on February 24, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nHelen Simmons-McCarter and her attorney husband Charles McCarter have money, success, and a fine home. Despite seemingly perfect lives, Charles is actually distant, verbally and physically abusive, and has been having multiple affairs, while Helen is unemployed, bored at home, and desperately trying to make her marriage work.\n\nOn the evening of their 18th wedding anniversary, Helen arrives home to find all her belongings in a U-Haul, and that Charles is abandoning her for his young mistress Brenda, the mother of his two sons.\n\nHelen kicks the driver Orlando out of the truck and visits her intimidating grandmother [[Madea]]. Madea takes Helen in and helps her get back on her feet, upsetting Madea's brother Joe. Joe's attorney son Brian defends Madea and Helen after Charles and Brenda catch the pair breaking into and vandalizing the marital home. [[Mablean Ephriam|Judge Mablean Ephriam]] places Madea, a repeat offender, under house arrest and sets a $5,000 property or cash bond for Helen.\n\nBrian kicks his addict wife Debrah out of their home, causing him to have a strained relationship with their daughter Tiffany who wants to join the church choir. Fearing that Tiffany will turn to drugs like her mother, Brian refuses until Madea convinces him otherwise, encouraging him to also fix his relationship with Debrah. Helen cultivates a relationship with Orlando. Meanwhile, career criminal Jamison Milton Jackson asks Charles to defend him in his trial for shooting an undercover cop during a drug deal and to possibly bribe the judge $300,000 to rule in his favor, revealing that Charles received most of his money through drug deals and buying off judges.\n\nIn divorce court, Helen lets Charles keep all the money and property, provided he pay Brian's attorney fees and continue paying for her mother Myrtle Jean's stay in a nursing home since he made her place her there; Charles agrees to both terms. In the shooting case, despite Charles' efforts, the jury convicts Jamison. While being led out of the courtroom, Jamison snatches the bailiff's gun and shoots Charles in the back for failing to get him acquitted.\n\nOrlando proposes to Helen. Before she can respond, she sees the shooting on the news and goes to the hospital with Brian. They encounter Brenda upon arriving. The doctor says Charles might be permanently paralyzed  and asks if they should resuscitate him if things deteriorate. Brenda chooses to let Charles die, but Helen, still Charles's legal wife, tells the doctor to do everything possible for him.\n\nCharles recovers, returns home with Helen, and resumes verbally abusing her, but Helen takes the opportunity to retaliate for years of neglect, verbal, emotional, and physical abuse by not only physically humiliating him, but also by revealing that Brenda finally showed her true colors by not only opting to let Charles die, but also by emptying his bank account and leaving with their boys during his hospitalization. She additionally reveals that their housekeeper Christina has left as well because Charles has no money to pay her, and that all of his friends, associates, and connections have abandoned him now that he has been left crippled and penniless.\n\nHelen and Orlando argue when he learns she has moved back in with Charles to look after him, and he leaves heartbroken. Charles realizes his mistakes and apologizes to Helen, realizing that she was the only one who truly cared for him. He becomes a kinder man, while she helps him recover. He regains his ability to walk one day in church, where Debrah, now clean and sober after going into rehab, reconciles with Brian.\n\nCharles hopes to start over with Helen, but during a family dinner with Madea, she gives him her wedding ring and signed divorce papers and tells him she will always be his friend. She finds Orlando, asks him to propose again, and accepts when he does.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kimberly Elise]] as Helen Simmons-McCarter, a woman who is the soon to be ex-wife of Charles.\n* [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]] as Charles McCarter, a successful lawyer.\n* [[Shemar Moore]] as Orlando, a moving truck driver.\n* [[Cicely Tyson]] as Myrtle Simmons, Helen's mother.\n* [[Tyler Perry]] as:\n** [[Madea (Mabel Simmons)|Mabel \"Madea\" Simmons]], a tough old lady and Helen's grandmother\n** Joe Simmons, Madea's brother.\n** Brian Simmons, a lawyer who is Madea's nephew and Joe's son.\n* [[Lisa Marcos]] as Brenda Marcos, Charles' mistress.\n* [[Tamara Taylor]] as Debrah, Brian's drug-addicted wife.\n* [[Tiffany Evans]] as Tiffany, Brian's daughter.\n* Avery Knight as BJ, Brian's son\n* [[Gary Anthony Sturgis]] as Jamison Milton Jackson, a career criminal.\n* [[Chandra Currelley-Young|Chandra Currelley]] as herself \n* [[Mablean Ephriam|Judge Mablean Ephriam]] as herself\n* [[Tamela Mann]] as Cora Simmons, a choir member at the church Helen attends who is revealed to be Madea's daughters in other works.\n* Terrell Carter as Reverend Carter\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack was released by [[Motown Records]] on April 19, 2005.\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Track listing\n| extra_column    = Performer(s)\n| title1          = Purify Me\n| length1         = 4:07\n| extra1          = [[India.Arie]]\n| title2          = Sick & Tired\n| extra2          = [[Monica (singer)|Monica]]\n| length2         = 4:19\n| title3          = Different Directions\n| extra3          = [[Angie Stone]]\n| length3         = 3:39\n| title4          = Things I Collected\n| extra4          = [[Tamia]]\n| length4         = 5:37\n| title5          = I Wanna Swing\n| extra5          = [[Cheryl Pepsii Riley]]\n| length5         = 2:25\n| title6          = I Wanna Love Again\n| extra6          = [[Chandra Currelley-Young|Chandra Currelley]]\n| length6         = 4:44\n| title7          = Fallen in Love\n| extra7          = [[Darlene McCoy]]\n| length7         = 4:28\n| title8          = Ain't It Funny\n| extra8          = [[Heather Headley]]\n| length8         = 4:03\n| title9          = [[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]]\n| extra9          = Cheryl Pepsii Riley\n| length9         = 3:31\n| title10         = I Wanna Be Free\n| extra10         = [[Patti LaBelle]]\n| length10        = 4:56\n| title11         = Father, Can You Hear Me\n| extra11         = [[Tiffany Evans]], Cheryl Pepsii Riley, [[Tamela J.
