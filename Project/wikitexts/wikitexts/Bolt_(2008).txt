It is the 48th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. Directed by [[Chris Williams (director)|Chris Williams]] and [[Byron Howard]], the film stars the voices of [[John Travolta]], [[Susie Essman]], [[Mark Walton (story artist)|Mark Walton]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Malcolm McDowell]], [[Diedrich Bader]], [[Nick Swardson]], and [[Greg Germann]]. This was one of the final film roles for [[James Lipton]] before his death on March 2, 2020, the other being ''[[Igor (film)|Igor]]'', which was released the same year as ''Bolt''. \n\nThe film's plot centers on a dog named [[Bolt (Disney character)|Bolt]], who has spent his entire life on the set of a television series, firmly believes that he has super powers. When his beloved owner Penny is \"kidnapped\" on the show, Bolt runs away from the set to rescue her, eventually teaming up with sarcastic alley cat Mittens and ''Bolt'' super-fan Rhino the hamster on a cross-country journey back home. \n\n''Bolt'' was released in the United States on November 21, 2008. Despite a relatively marginal box-office performance, the film received a strong positive critical reception. It is also regarded for helping to instigate a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios#2005\u20132010: Rebound, Disney's acquisition of Pixar and renaming|rebirth of Walt Disney Animation Studios]], setting the studio on a new creative direction that led to other critically acclaimed features such as ''[[Tangled]]'' (2010) and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' (2013).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-07-22 |title='Bolt' Is the Disney Success Story No One Remembers |url=https://decider.com/2018/07/22/bolt-helped-save-disney/ |access-date=2022-03-20 |website=Decider |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-02-17 |title=Disney Revival Rundown: Bolt |url=https://www.rotoscopers.com/2015/02/17/disney-revival-rundown-bolt/ |access-date=2022-03-20 |website=Rotoscopers |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated for a series of awards, such as the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not add too many extra details about the plot. See [[WP:NOT#PLOT]] and revision history of [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)]] to see that plot details that are not relevant will be removed. -->\nA [[White Swiss Shepherd]] puppy named [[Bolt (Disney character)|Bolt]] is adopted by a 7-year-old girl named Penny. Five years later, Bolt and a 12-year-old Penny star in a hit television series called ''Bolt'', in which Bolt uses various [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s to help Penny foil the plans of the villain, Dr. Calico, who has kidnapped Penny's father. To gain a more realistic performance, the show's producers have deceived Bolt his entire life, arranging the filming in such a way that Bolt believes everything in the show is real, including his invulnerability, super-strength, and percussive sonic \"Superbark\". Penny disapproves, as this means Bolt can never leave the set and come home with her as a normal dog. After a [[cliffhanger]] episode causes Bolt to believe Penny has been kidnapped, he escapes from his on-set trailer in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], but knocks himself unconscious in a box of [[packing peanuts]], which is then shipped to [[New York City]].\n\nUpon arrival in New York, Bolt is shocked to discover that his \"superpowers\" are useless. He encounters Mittens, a cynical [[feral cat]] who [[Protection racket|bullies]] [[pigeon]]s out of their food. Believing that Mittens is an \"agent\" of Calico, Bolt ties her to his collar with a leash, and forces her to guide him back to Penny. Mittens is convinced her captor is a lunatic, but the two start their journey westward by truck. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, a less-experienced Bolt [[look-alike]] is brought in so filming can resume. Penny is genuinely distraught over Bolt\u2019s disappearance, but reluctantly agrees to halt the search so production can continue. \n\nFeeling hungry for the first time in his life, Bolt accepts Mittens' advice and behaves like a cute and needy stray, securing food for them both at an [[RV park]]. They are joined by Rhino, a fearless [[hamster]] and huge ''Bolt'' fanatic. This causes Mittens to realize Bolt is from a TV show, but she is unable to convince him of the truth. In frustration, Bolt repeatedly attempts to \"superbark\" Mittens; the noise draws the attention of the local [[Animal control service]], and Bolt and Mittens are both captured and taken to a shelter.\n\nBolt, freed from the patrol van by Rhino, finally realizes and accepts that he is just a normal dog. However, he regains his confidence after Rhino (oblivious to this revelation) exhorts him to [[heroism]]. They rescue Mittens from the shelter; as they continue west, Bolt and Mittens form a close friendship, in which she teaches Bolt how to be an ordinary dog and enjoy typical dog activities. Mittens makes plans for the three of them to stay in [[Las Vegas]], but Bolt is still drawn to find Penny. Mittens, who was abandoned by her own humans, asserts that Penny is just an actor and that no human truly \"loves\" their pet. Bolt refuses to believe her, and continues on alone to Hollywood. Rhino scolds Mittens, saying friends should never abandon each other, and the two set off after him. \n\nWhen Bolt reaches the studio, he finds Penny embracing his look-alike during a rehearsal, and leaves feeling heartbroken. However, Mittens catches up to him and tells him that she overheard Penny and her mother after the rehearsal, both genuinely distressed about the loss of the real Bolt. At the same time, the Bolt look-alike panics during the show's filming and accidentally knocks over some lit [[torch]]es, setting the stage on fire with Penny trapped inside. Bolt arrives, and the two reunite inside the burning studio, but are unable to escape before Penny begins to [[Smoke inhalation|suffocate from the smoke]]. Penny begs Bolt to go, but Bolt refuses to leave her. Bolt repeatedly barks into the building's [[air vent]], alerting the firefighters to their location.\n\nBolt and Penny are rescued, but Penny and her mother quit when their overeager [[talent agent|agent]] proposes they exploit the incident for publicity purposes. The show continues with a replacement \"Bolt\" and \"Penny\" and a [[jumping the shark|bizarre new storyline]] involving [[alien abduction]]. Penny adopts Mittens and Rhino, and she and her family move to a rural home to enjoy a simpler lifestyle together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Travolta]] as [[Bolt (Disney character)|Bolt]]\n* [[Susie Essman]] as Mittens\n* [[Mark Walton (story artist)|Mark Walton]] as Rhino\n* [[Miley Cyrus]] as Penny\n**[[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as 7-year-old Penny\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Dr. Calico\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Blake\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Veteran Cat\n* [[Greg Germann]] as The Agent\n* [[James Lipton]] as The Director\n* [[Randy Savage]] as Thug\n* [[Kari Wahlgren]] as Mindy\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] as Penny's Mother\n* [[J.
