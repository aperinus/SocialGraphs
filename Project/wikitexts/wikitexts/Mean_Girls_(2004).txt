The film stars [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Rachel McAdams]], [[Lacey Chabert]], [[Amanda Seyfried]] (in her film debut), [[Tim Meadows]], [[Ana Gasteyer]], [[Amy Poehler]], and Fey. It is based in part on [[Rosalind Wiseman]]'s 2002 non-fiction self-help book, ''[[Queen Bees and Wannabes]]'', which describes female high school social [[clique]]s, [[school bullying]], and the damaging effects they can have on students. Fey also drew from her own experience at [[Upper Darby High School]] as an inspiration for some of the concepts in the film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.phillyvoice.com/tina-fey-visits-upper-darby-high-mean-girls-promo/ |title=Tina Fey visits Upper Darby High for 'Mean Girls' promo |date=May 24, 2018 |access-date=November 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524225514/http://www.phillyvoice.com/tina-fey-visits-upper-darby-high-mean-girls-promo/ |archive-date=May 24, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The plot centers on a na\u00efve teenage girl navigating her way through the social hierarchy of a modern American high school after years of her parents [[homeschooling]] her while conducting research in Africa.\n\n''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]] produced the film. Fey, screenwriter and co-star of the film, was a long-term cast member and writer for ''SNL''. Although set in the Chicago suburb of [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], Illinois, the film was mostly shot in [[Toronto]]. Filming took place from September to November 2003. The film marks Lohan's second collaboration with director Waters, the first being ''[[Freaky Friday (2003 film)|Freaky Friday]]'', released a year earlier.\n\nReleased on April 30, 2004, the film grossed $130&nbsp;million worldwide and developed a [[cult following]].<ref>Multiple sources:\n*{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/why-mean-girls-is-a-classic |title=Why \"Mean Girls\" Is a Classic |magazine=The New Yorker |date=April 30, 2014 |first=Richard |last=Brody |access-date=October 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019041555/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/why-mean-girls-is-a-classic |archive-date=October 19, 2014 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2013/jan/29/tina-feys-mean-girls-movie-classic |title=Why Tina Fey's Mean Girls is a movie classic |newspaper=The Guardian |date=January 29, 2013 |first=Priya |last=Elan |access-date=October 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009144457/http://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2013/jan/29/tina-feys-mean-girls-movie-classic |archive-date=October 9, 2014 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/30/showbiz/movies/mean-girls-10-year-anniversary/ |title='Mean Girls' is still 'fetch' |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=August 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502000618/http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/30/showbiz/movies/mean-girls-10-year-anniversary/ |archive-date=May 2, 2014 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/02/mean-girls-director-spills-10-juicy-stories.html |title=Mean Girls Director Mark Waters Spills 10 Juicy Stories, 10 Years Later |work=Vulture |date=April 20, 2014 |first=Kyle |last=Buchanan |access-date=September 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085820/http://www.vulture.com/2014/02/mean-girls-director-spills-10-juicy-stories.html |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2014/01/08/mean_girls_why_are_people_always_referencing_the_tina_fey_movie.html |title=Why Is Mean Girls So Quotable? |magazine=Slate |date=January 8, 2014 |access-date=September 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006094941/http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2014/01/08/mean_girls_why_are_people_always_referencing_the_tina_fey_movie.html |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |url-status=live}}\n*{{cite magazine |url=http://ca.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/04/mean-girls-the-movie-of-the-millennial-generation |title=\"Mean Girls\" Is Everything (No, Really): How One Movie Summarized a Generation |magazine=Complex |date=April 30, 2014 |first=Julian |last=Kimble |access-date=September 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726003728/http://ca.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/04/mean-girls-the-movie-of-the-millennial-generation |archive-date=July 26, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Critics praised its direction, screenplay, humor, and performances; especially lauded was Lohan's acting, which earned [[List of awards and nominations received by Lindsay Lohan|several accolades]] including three [[Teen Choice Awards]] and three [[MTV Movie & TV Awards]], and in 2021, was listed as the 11th-best performance of the 21st century by ''[[The New Yorker]]''. The made-for-television sequel ''[[Mean Girls 2]]'' premiered on [[ABC Family]] on January 23, 2011. A [[Mean Girls (musical)|musical adaptation]] premiered on Broadway in March 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words-->\n\nSixteen-year-old [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] Cady Heron and her parents return to the United States after twelve years in Africa, settling in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. After an intimidating first day at North Shore High School, Cady befriends outsiders Janis Ian and Damian Leigh, who explain the school's various [[clique]]s and warn her to avoid the \"Plastics\": wealthy but insecure Gretchen Wieners, sweet but dimwitted Karen Smith, and \"[[Queen bee (sociology)|queen bee]]\" Regina George. When Cady is invited to sit with the Plastics at lunch, Janis persuades her to infiltrate the ruling clique.\n\nCady becomes attracted to Aaron Samuels, a senior in her math class and Regina's ex-boyfriend, and learns about the \"Burn Book\", a scrapbook the Plastics fill with cruel rumors about students and faculty. Regina offers to talk to Aaron on Cady's behalf, but instead kisses him in front of her and resumes their relationship. Feeling betrayed, Cady fully commits to Janis' plan to damage Regina's reputation. Regina tells Cady that she and Janis were once friends until she accused Janis of being a lesbian and ostracized her.\n\nAfter their attempts to sabotage Regina's wardrobe backfire, Cady, Janis, and Damian plan to turn Gretchen against her. They make it seem as though Regina has sent \"[[candy cane]]-grams\" to Cady and Karen while excluding Gretchen. Regina further humiliates Gretchen during their dance performance at the Winter Talent Show, leading Gretchen to tell Cady all of Regina's embarrassing secrets. Cady informs Aaron that Regina is cheating on him, prompting them to break up, and tricks Regina into eating nutrition bars that cause her to gain weight. Following a sharp drop in Regina's reputation, she is replaced by Cady as the new \"queen bee\".\n\nCady throws a house party while her parents are away, and drunkenly admits to Aaron that she has been deliberately failing math class to make him help her, but he rebukes her for becoming as manipulative and image-obsessed as Regina. Janis and Damian confront Cady for lying to them about the party and remaking herself in Regina's image. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, and Janis declares her a \"mean girl\" and renounces their friendship.\n\nRealizing Cady's betrayal, Regina retaliates by distributing the contents of the Burn Book throughout school, inciting chaos among the girls of the junior class. She avoids suspicion by inserting insults about herself, and blame is placed on Cady, Gretchen, and Karen. To restore order, Principal Duvall and math teacher Ms. Norbury gather the female sophomores in the gym to apologize to each other. Regina insults Janis' sexuality, prompting Janis to reveal her entire plan to destroy Regina's reputation as the students cheer. Regina storms out, pursued by an apologetic Cady, and is struck by a school bus, fracturing her spine.\n\nDeciding to take full blame for the Burn Book, Cady is shunned by her peers and distrusted by her own parents, but gradually returns to her old self. She joins the school [[Mathlete]]s at the state finals, answering the tiebreaker correctly and winning the championship. The team arrives at the Spring Fling dance, where Cady is elected queen, but declares that all her classmates are wonderful in their own way, snapping the plastic tiara and distributing the pieces to other girls in the crowd, including Janis, Gretchen, and Regina. She rekindles her friendship with Janis and Damian, makes up with Aaron, and reaches a truce with the Plastics.\n\nThe Plastics disband at the beginning of the new school year; Regina joins the lacrosse team to positively manage her anger. Karen becomes the school weather reporter, and Gretchen joins the \"Cool Asians\" clique. Aaron graduates and attends [[Northwestern University]] while starting a relationship with Cady. Reflecting on the relative social peace that has taken over North Shore High, Cady notices a trio of new \"Junior Plastics\" in Freshman year, and imagines them being hit by a bus.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lindsay Lohan]] as Cady Heron, a 15-year-old girl who transfers to a public high school after being homeschooled her whole life in Africa and Aaron Samuels' love interest.\n** Jessie Wright as 5-year-old Cady.\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Regina George, a rich, popular mean girl.

[[Rachel McAdams]] was cast as Regina because Fey felt McAdams being \"kind and polite\" made her perfect for such an evil-spirited character. [[Amanda Seyfried]] also read for Regina, and the producers instead suggested her for Karen due to Seyfried's \"spacey and daffy sense of humor\". Both [[Lacey Chabert]] and [[Daniel Franzese]] were the last actors tested for their roles. [[Lizzy Caplan]] was at first considered too pretty for the part of Janis, for which director [[Mark Waters (director)|Mark Waters]] felt a \"[[Kelly Osbourne]]-like actress\" was necessary, but Caplan was picked for being able to portray raw emotion.
