Stewart. It stars [[Dwayne Johnson]] (credited as The Rock), [[Seann William Scott]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Rosario Dawson]] and [[William Lucking]]. In the film, Johnson plays a bounty hunter who travels to [[Brazil]] to retrieve his employer's son (Scott). The film was released by [[Universal Pictures]] in North America and Japan and by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group|Columbia TriStar Film Distributors]] under [[Columbia Pictures]] label internationally on September 26, 2003 and made $80.9 million on an $85 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nBeck is a \"retrieval expert\", a [[bounty hunter]] who collects debts for a man named Billy Walker.  He is sent to a nightclub to retrieve a championship ring from a football player, and after doing so is assaulted by one of Walker's other collectors.  Angry, he confronts Walker and tells him that he wants out of the business. Walker talks him into one last bounty \u2013 retrieve Walker's son Travis from a small mining town in [[Brazil]] and Walker will give him enough money to open his own restaurant.  Beck accepts and leaves for Brazil.  When Beck arrives in the town of El Dorado, he meets with the man running the mining operation, Cornelius Hatcher.  Hatcher gives Beck his blessing to grab Travis, but reneges when he finds out that Travis has discovered a missing golden artifact called \"O Gato do Diabo\u201d (The Devil's Cat).  Hatcher and his men confront Beck in the local bar, but he manages to leave with Travis.  On the way back to the airfield, Travis forces their [[Jeep]] off the road and into the jungle.  Travis attempts to escape but is re-captured by Beck.  After an unfortunate encounter with some local monkeys, the two find themselves in the camp of the local resistance movement.\n\nAt the resistance camp, Travis convinces the rebels that Beck works for Hatcher and was sent to kill them all. After a prolonged fight, Beck gains the upper hand before the rebel leader Mariana intervenes. She wants the Gato so it can be used to ensure the locals can free themselves from Hatcher. Hatcher and his men suddenly attack the camp, killing many rebels. Beck, Travis, and Mariana escape the camp and Beck makes Mariana a deal \u2013 she helps him get Travis to the airfield in exchange for the Gato.  After some searching, Travis leads them to a cave behind a waterfall where the Gato is located.  They retrieve it and begin the journey back.\n\nOn the way back, Mariana chastises Travis for wanting to sell the artifact, but Travis argues that he actually did want to give it to a museum. Mariana gives the two men a toxic fruit that temporarily paralyzes them. She tells Beck which direction the airfield is, and leaves them with a fire to keep the animals away. After waking up able to move, Beck hauls Travis to the airfield. The local pilot, Declan, tells Beck that Mariana was captured earlier by Hatcher and will probably be killed. Travis pleads with Beck to help, and the two head into town to rescue her. Using a cow stampede for cover, the two begin their assault on Hatcher's goons. Travis becomes trapped by gunfire in a bus, and Beck saves him before the bus explodes.  Hatcher tells his brother to take Mariana and the Gato and flee, but they are stopped by Travis. Hatcher confronts Beck, who offers him the chance to leave town, which Hatcher initially refuses. After he is shot by the townspeople, Hatcher agrees to leave town, but eventually dies from his gunshot wounds. Travis gives the Gato to Mariana before leaving with Beck, who tells him that despite all they've been through he must still return Travis to the United States.\n\nBack in [[Los Angeles]], Travis is delivered to his father who begins to verbally and physically abuse him. Beck asks to celebrate with them and gives Walker and his men the same fruit Mariana used on him. As they are paralyzed, Beck uncuffs Travis and the duo leave together.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Beck, a skilled bounty hunter who longs to quit the business and start a career as a [[chef]].  \n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Travis Walker, a [[Treasure hunting|treasure hunter]] who is searching El Dorado for a lost artifact.  \n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Mariana, the town bartender who is also the secret leader of the local resistance against Hatcher.  \n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Cornelius Bernard Hatcher, the owner of the mining operation and founder of the town of El Dorado.\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Declan, the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] pilot who operates out of the town airstrip.  \n* [[Jon Gries]] as Harvey Hatcher, Cornelius' younger brother and co-owner of the mine.

It was offered to Peter Berg, who had made one film, ''Very Bad Things''. Looking for inspiration on how to do it, Berg bought a DVD titled \"The Fifty Best Fights Ever Filmed.\" At first he says watching it made him depressed. \"I just thought, 'Good God, it's all been done and it's all been done so well, probably with more money than I'm going to have,\" Berg said. \"What am I going to do?\" Then he saw the fight between [[Roddy Piper]] and [[Keith David]] in ''[[They Live]]''. \"It just hurt watching it,\" Berg says. \"It was a completely different style from all these sexy and sleek movies. And thinking about it, I couldn't remember the last time in a movie fight where I felt the pain, where if you got hit in the face, it hurt. So that's where I found my breathing room: Let's give people old-school guys slugging it out with big punches.\"<ref name=\"pain\">Peter Berg wants you to feel their pain: [HOME Edition]\nWhipp, Glenn.

Shooting began September 2002. \"We just basically made up as we went along,\" said Scott.<ref name=\"pain\"/>\n\nOne scene on Oahu involved Johnson and Scott falling down the side of a mountain. \"The goal was to put the biggest fall down a hill in a movie that people have ever seen,\" said Berg. \"The big inspiration was the old 'Wide World of Sports' - 'and the agony of defeat' - and wondering what would have happened if that poor bastard on the ski slope had had a few more stages to go,\" it became a question of finding the stuntmen.\" Johnson's regular stuntman refused to do the stunt, so they hired \"a guy who has a reputation for just doing anything,\" said Berg. The new stuntman was knocked out the first time.<ref name=\"pain\"/>\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger made a cameo on the film; He visited Universal Studios during the shoot and was having lunch with The Rock. Berg asked if he would like to appear in the film and Schwarzenegger agreed if they could do it then. \"Within 15 minutes, we were on the set,\" said Berg.<ref>Arnold to Rock: I'll be backing you up in your movie: [National Edition]\nNational Post 23 Sep 2003: AL04.</ref> Despite his uncredited cameo appearances, this was the last time Schwarzenegger has appeared in a film distributed by Universal Pictures.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\nDespite the positive reviews, ''The Rundown'' was a significant box office failure, grossing just under $81 million worldwide compared to its $85 million budget,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> which makes a sequel not entirely likely.
