The film stars [[Shane West]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Peter Coyote]] and [[Daryl Hannah]], and was produced by [[Denise Di Novi]] and Hunt Lowry for [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].\n\nThe novel's 1950s setting was changed to the 1990s to early 2000s for the film, as the producers were concerned it might not appeal to teenage audiences. The film was shot in the summer of 2001 for 39 days in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], with many of the sets borrowed from the television series ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''. The film, as with the book, is dedicated to Sparks' sister Danielle, whose cancer-afflicted life inspired the story.\n\n''A Walk to Remember'' was theatrically released on January 25, 2002, and was a box office success, grossing $47.5 million against its $11.8 million budget. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, most of whom criticized its blandness and predictability, while others praised its sincerity and the lead actors' performances. The film was released on DVD in July 2002, and a \"Family-Edited Version\" was later released in December.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Beaufort, North Carolina]], popular and rebellious high school senior Landon Carter and his friends have illegally drunk on school grounds. They lure a new student, Clay Gephardt, to a factory, hoping to \"prank\" him, with an initiation task into their elite friendship group. However, Clay becomes seriously injured, which is brought to the attention of the school principal through law enforcement.\n\nIn an effort to avoid law involvement, the principal gives Landon the choice of being expelled from the school or completing several service projects which include weekend tutoring, janitorial duties, and participation in the school play. Choosing the latter, Landon is further acquainted with Jamie Sullivan, the local [[Baptists|Baptist]] minister's daughter. He never before interacted with her due to the status quo at the high school, though they have known each other most of their lives.\n\nLandon begins to struggle with the play and reluctantly seeks guidance from Jamie, who agrees to help him on the condition that he will not fall in love with her, but Landon dismisses it as a foolish idea. They begin practicing together at her house after school. A bond begins to form between them until Landon is rude to Jamie at school to impress his friends, and she realizes Landon wants to keep their friendship a secret from others, so she decides to distance herself. Landon decides to get his act together, when he got a wake up call from Jamie. He reconciled with Clay and apologized about what happened and decided to learn his lines himself.\n\nOn the opening night of the play, Jamie astounds Landon and the audience with her voice and beauty. When Jamie finishes singing towards the end, Landon impulsively kisses her just before the curtain closes. Afterwards, Jamie avoids Landon until his friends play a cruel prank on her, led by Belinda, his resentful ex-girlfriend who wants them to reconcile despite Landon's lack of interest. In opposition to his friends, he defends her and she eventually warms to him again. He asks her to go on a date, to which Jamie reveals that she is not allowed to date. Landon visits the church in order to ask her father for permission. He is initially hesitant but agrees.\n\nTheir first date is a success, and it leads to another. Their relationship strengthens as they genuinely fall for each other, and all seems well. During a date, however, Jamie confesses she is not making any plans for the future because she has [[leukemia]] and has not been responding to treatment. Her condition grows worse and she gets sent to the hospital. Landon drives off to beg for help for her from his estranged father who is a doctor. Landon drives back in tears after feeling disappointed by his father's inability to help.\n\nUpon learning of Jamie's condition, Landon's friends come to him and apologize for their past treatment of her, offering their support. While she is admitted, Jamie gives Landon a book that once belonged to her deceased mother and tells him he is her angel. Unbeknownst to Landon, she is provided with private home care through his father to relieve her father's financial burden.\n\nLandon builds a telescope for Jamie to see a [[International Star Registry|star that he named after her]], with help from her father. It is then that he asks her to marry him. Jamie tearfully accepts, and they get married in the church where her mother was married. Landon reflects that their last summer together was spent as husband and wife, and that she had died soon after.\n\nFour years later, Landon returns to Beaufort to visit Jamie's father, revealing that he had been accepted into medical school. When Landon laments that Jamie was never able to witness a miracle, her father replies that the miracle was Landon himself.\n\nHereafter, Landon expresses sorrow over Jamie's passing, but describes their love like the wind: he cannot see it, but he can feel it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Shane West]] as Landon Carter \n* [[Mandy Moore]] as Jamie Sullivan\n* [[Peter Coyote]] as Reverend Sullivan\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Cynthia Carter\n* [[Lauren German]] as Belinda\n* [[Clayne Crawford]] as Dean\n* [[Paz de la Huerta]] as Tracie\n* [[Al Thompson (actor)|Al Thompson]] as Eric\n* [[Matt Lutz]] as Clay Gephardt \n* [[Erik Smith (actor)|Erik Smith]] as Eddie Zimmerhoff\n* Jonathan Parks Jordan as Walker\n* [[David Lee Smith]] as Dr. Carter\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe inspiration for ''A Walk to Remember'' was Nicholas Sparks' sister, Danielle Sparks Lewis, who died of cancer in 2000.

He was looking for someone who could transition from being very dark to very light. He described his choice as \"an instinct\" he had about West, who would appear in almost every scene and had \"to be either incredibly angry and self-hating or madly in love and heroic.\"<ref name=\"casting\"/> West said: \"I don't generally read love stories, but after reading the screenplay, I knew I couldn't wait to read the book so I could truly understand Nicholas Sparks' story and how he envisioned the character of Landon.

On his personal website, Sparks explains the decisions behind the differences. For example, he and the producer decided to update the setting from the 1950s to the 1990s, worrying that a film set in the 50s would fail to draw teens. \"To interest them,\" he writes, \"we had to make the story more contemporary.\"<ref name=Walktoremember>{{cite web\n |last=Sparks \n |first=Nicholas \n |author-link=Nicholas Sparks (author) \n |title=Nicholas Sparks on the Movie Adaptation of A Walk to Remember \n |url=http://www.nicholassparks.com/Novels/AWalkToRemember/Movie.html \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417085418/http://www.nicholassparks.com/Novels/AWalkToRemember/Movie.html \n |archive-date=April 17, 2008 \n |access-date=12 March 2010 \n |url-status=dead\n |df=mdy \n}} ()</ref> To make the update believable, Landon's pranks and behavior are worse than they are in the novel; as Sparks notes, \"the things that teen boys did in the 1950s to be considered a little 'rough' are different than what teen boys in the 1990s do to be considered 'rough.'\"<ref name=Walktoremember/>\n\nSparks and the producer also changed the play in which Landon and Jamie appear. In the novel, Hegbert wrote a Christmas play that illustrated how he once struggled as a father. Due to time constraints, the sub-plot showing how he overcame his struggles could not be included in the film. Sparks was concerned that \"people who hadn't read the book would question whether Hegbert was a good father\", adding that \"because he is a good father and we didn't want that question to linger, we changed the play.\"<ref name=Walktoremember/>\n\nA significant difference is that at the end of the novel, unlike the film, it is ambiguous whether Jamie died or simply disappeared into the shadow world. Sparks says that he had written the book knowing she would die, yet had \"grown to love Jamie Sullivan\", and so opted for \"the solution that best described the exact feeling I had with regard to my sister at that point: namely, that I hoped she would live.\"<ref>{{cite web| last=Sparks| first=Nicholas| author-link=Nicholas Sparks (author) | title=FAQ on 'A Walk to Remember' \u2013 Did Jamie Die?| url=http://www.nicholassparks.com/Novels/AWalkToRemember/FAQ.html#1 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416040410/http://www.nicholassparks.com/Novels/AWalkToRemember/FAQ.html#1 | archive-date=April 16, 2008| access-date=12 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = A Walk to Remember: Music from the Motion Picture\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2002|01|15}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Contemporary Christian music|contemporary Christian]], [[post-grunge]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=52|s=01}} <small>(Standard)</small><br/>{{Duration|m=62|s=32}} <small>(2003 Special Expanded Edition)</small>\n| label      = [[Epic Records|Epic]]/[[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Soundtrax]]\n| producer   = Jon Leshay\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = A Walk to Remember: Music from the Motion Picture\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Cry (Mandy Moore song)|Cry]]\n | single1date = November 4, 2001\n}}\n}}\nThe film's soundtrack was released by Moore's first label [[Epic Records]] and [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Soundtrax]] on January 15, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/only-hope/id186210887?i=186211481|title=\"Only Hope\" from A Walk to Remember (Music from the Motion Picture) by Various Artists on iTunes|website=[[iTunes]] |date=January 15, 2002}}</ref> It features six songs by Moore and others by acts [[Switchfoot]], [[Rachael Lampa]] and many more.\n\nThe lead single \"[[Cry (Mandy Moore song)|Cry]]\" was originally released on Moore's [[Mandy Moore (album)|self-titled third studio album]] in 2001.
