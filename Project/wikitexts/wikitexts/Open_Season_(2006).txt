The film stars the voices of [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Gary Sinise]], [[Debra Messing]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Jon Favreau]], [[Georgia Engel]], [[Jane Krakowski]], [[Gordon Tootoosis]], and [[Patrick Warburton]]. Its plot follows Boog, a domesticated [[grizzly bear]] who teams up with an [[Anterograde amnesia|amnesiac]] one-antlered [[mule deer]] named Elliot and other woodland animals to defeat human hunters.\n\n''Open Season'' was produced by [[Sony Pictures Animation]] as its debut film, and was released to theaters by [[Columbia Pictures]] under [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] on September 29, 2006. It has also been released in the [[IMAX#IMAX 3D|IMAX 3D]] format.<ref name=\"IMAX3D\">{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Ryan|title=Open Season Bears Fruit in IMAX 3D|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/open-season-bears-fruit-in-imax-3d/|access-date=March 28, 2012|newspaper=Animation Magazine|date=October 4, 2006}}</ref> A [[Open Season (video game)|video game]] for the film was released on multiple platforms.\n\nDespite receiving mixed reviews from film critics, the film was positively welcomed from audiences and was a box office success, earning $200.8 million on an $85 million budget. The film was followed by [[Open Season (film series)|three direct-to-video sequels]]: ''[[Open Season 2]]'' (2008), ''[[Open Season 3]]'' (2010), and ''[[Open Season: Scared Silly]]'' (2015).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400-700 words only. -->\nIn the small town of Timberline, a 900-pound (400&nbsp;kg) [[grizzly bear]] named Boog enjoys a captive but pampered existence and spends his days as the star attraction of the town's nature show, while at night lives in the [[Garage (residential)|garage]] of [[park ranger]] Beth, who has raised Boog since he was a cub. One day, the hunting fanatic Shaw drives into Timberline with a one-antlered deer named Elliot strapped to the hood of his truck. After Boog frees him, Elliot becomes convinced that they are friends. That night, Elliot finds Boog sleeping comfortably in the garage, tells him to be \"free\" from his garage captivity, and introduces him to sweet temptations he has never known.\n\nWhen Boog becomes sick from eating too many candy bars, events quickly spiral out of control as the two raid a convenience store. Elliot escapes, but Boog is caught by Beth's friend Gordy, the town's sheriff. The next morning, Elliot is being chased by Shaw, and goes to Boog for help at the nature show. Boog tries to get rid of him, and the audience mistakes him for attacking Elliot and goes into a panic. Beth shoots both animals with a [[tranquilizer gun]] just before Shaw fires his own gun; Shaw flees before Gordy can arrest him. Realizing Boog is too threatening in the town, Beth relocates him and Elliot into the Timberline [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] two days before [[Hunting season#Open season|open season]], but they are relocated above the waterfalls, where they will be legally safe from hunters. \n\nLacking outdoor survival skills, Boog reluctantly takes Elliot as his guide to get him back home to reunite with Beth. They encounter unwelcoming forest animals, including skunks Maria and Rosie, ducks Serge and Deni, various panic-stricken rabbits, the [[Scotland|Scottish]]-accented squirrel McSquizzy and his loyal gang of fellow acorn-throwing squirrels, beaver Reilly and his construction worker team, a porcupine named Buddy who is in search of a friend, and Elliot's herd that includes Ian, the leader, and Giselle, a doe that Elliot is in love with. It is revealed that Ian banished Elliot from the herd for being a loser. Eventually, Boog and Elliot start to bond after realizing they are both outcasts, and Boog considers letting Elliot stay with him when they get back. \n\nThe next day, Elliot attempts to lead Boog out of the forest, but it becomes evident he has no clue where they are going. The two are confronted by Shaw and accidentally destroy Reilly's dam trying to get away, causing a [[flash flood]] which sends the animals and Shaw plummeting down the waterfall into the hunting grounds. At first, everyone blames Boog, who accuses Elliot of lying to him about knowing the way home. Elliot admits he thought that if Boog spent time with him, he would befriend him. Boog storms off, but unwittingly ends up in Shaw's log cabin, where he is discovered by Shaw. Boog escapes to a nearby road and happens upon the glowing lights of Timberline. Instead of returning home, Boog rallies the animals to defend themselves using their natural skills. They scavenge supplies from an RV owned by a couple named Bob and Bobbie, who are looking for [[Bigfoot]], while their pet dachshund Mr. Weenie joins the forest animals.\n\nThe next day, Boog leads a revolution against the hunters, sending them running after McSquizzy blows up their trucks with a propane tank ignited by an emergency flare. Shaw returns for a final showdown and shoots Elliot, prompting Boog to furiously confront Shaw and tie him up with his own gun. Boog rushes to Elliot, who survived with a second broken antler. The forest animals thank Boog for his help and take out their vengeance on Shaw by smothering him with honey and pillow feathers, sending him fleeing into the woods. Beth later returns in a helicopter to take Boog back home, but Boog decides to stay in the forest with Beth's blessing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Boog, a 900 pound pampered [[grizzly bear]].\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Elliot, a cheerful but oblivious [[mule deer]] who got his antler broken off after being hit by Shaw's truck.\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Shaw, the nastiest [[hunter]] in Timberline and Beth's arch-rival.\n* [[Debra Messing]] as Beth, a [[park ranger]] who had raised Boog since he was a cub.\n* [[Billy Connolly]] as McSquizzy, a grumpy elderly [[eastern gray squirrel]] with a Scottish accent.<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite news|last1=Chang|first1=Justin|title=Review: 'Open Season'|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/awards/open-season-5-1200513015/|access-date=September 7, 2015|work=Variety|date=September 28, 2006}}</ref>\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Reilly, a diligent [[North American beaver]].\n* [[Georgia Engel]] as Bobbie, a friendly but dim-witted hippie woman who is Mr. Weenie's owner.\n**Bobbie's husband, Bob, is unvoiced.\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as Giselle, a beautiful mule deer doe, a victim of Ian's [[stalking]] and Elliot's love interest.\n* [[Gordon Tootoosis]] as Gordy, Timberline's sheriff and Beth's friend.\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Ian, a large, intimidating mule deer stag and the alpha of his herd.\n* [[Cody Cameron]] as Mr. Weenie, Bob and Bobbie's domesticated German-accented [[dachshund]].\n* Danny Mann as Serge, a French-accented [[mallard duck]].\n* [[Maddie Taylor]] as Deni, a mute and [[Insanity|insane]] but brave mallard duck and Serge's brother / Buddy, a blue [[North American porcupine]] who searches for friends.\n* [[Nika Futterman]] as Rosie, a  [[striped skunk]] with a Mexican accent.\n* Michelle Murdocca as Maria, a striped skunk who is Rosie's identical twin.\n* [[Fergal Reilly]] as O'Toole, a beaver and one of Reilly's men.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Annie Awards, Roger Allers, Jill Culton.jpg|thumb|right|[[Roger Allers]] and [[Jill Culton]], the directors of the film, at the 34th Annie Awards]]\nThe ideas for ''Open Season'' came from cartoonist [[Steve Moore (cartoonist)|Steve Moore]], who is known for his comic strip ''[[In the Bleachers]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.impactservices.net.au/movies/openseason.htm | title=Open Season | publisher=impactservices.net.au | access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> Moore and producer John Carls submitted the story to Sony in June 2002, and the film immediately went into development.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/newsrelease/?view=374 | title=\"Open Season\" in Theatres Tonight; Credit Goes to Universal Press Syndicate Creator | publisher=[[Universal Uclick]] | date=September 29, 2006 | access-date=July 5, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018220732/http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/newsrelease/?view=374 | archive-date=October 18, 2006 | url-status=dead }}</ref> On February 29, 2004, [[Sony Pictures Animation]] announced the beginning of the production on ''Open Season'', its first [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animated film.<ref>{{Cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-pictures-animation-begins-production-on-first-full-length-cgi-film-open-season-starring-martin-lawrence-ashton-kutcher-and-debra-messing-71718707.html | title=Sony Pictures Animation Begins Production on First Full-Length CGI Film 'Open Season' Starring Martin Lawrence, Ashton Kutcher and Debra Messing | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=February 29, 2004 | access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe film location was inspired by the towns of [[Sun Valley, Idaho]] and [[McCall, Idaho]], and the [[Sawtooth National Forest]].
