Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\nIn 1959, Todd Anderson begins his junior year of high school at Welton Academy, an [[Single-sex education|all-male]] [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] in [[Vermont]]. Assigned one of Welton's most promising students, senior Neil Perry, as his roommate, he meets his friends: Knox Overstreet, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, and Charlie Dalton.\n\nOn the first day of classes, the boys are surprised by the unorthodox teaching methods of new English teacher, John Keating. A Welton alumnus himself, Keating encourages his students to \"make your lives extraordinary\", a sentiment he summarizes with the [[Latin]] expression ''[[carpe diem]]'' (\"seize the day\").\n\nSubsequent lessons include Keating having the students take turns standing on his desk to demonstrate ways to look at life differently, telling them to rip out the introduction of their poetry books which explains a mathematical formula used for rating poetry, and inviting them to make up their own style of walking in a courtyard to encourage their individualism. Keating's methods attract the attention of strict headmaster Gale Nolan.\n\nUpon learning that Keating was a member of the unsanctioned Dead Poets Society while at Welton, Neil restarts the club and he and his friends sneak off campus to a cave where they read poetry. As the school year progresses, Keating's lessons and their involvement with the club encourage them to live their lives on their own terms. Knox pursues Chris Noel, an attractive cheerleader who is dating Chet Danburry, a football player from a local public school whose family is friends with his.\n\nNeil discovers his love of acting and gets the role as [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] in a local production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', despite the fact that his domineering father wants him to attend [[Harvard University|Harvard]] to study medicine. Meanwhile, Keating helps Todd come out of his shell and realize his potential when he takes him through an exercise in self-expression, resulting in his composing a poem spontaneously in front of the class.\n\nCharlie publishes an article in the school newspaper in the club's name suggesting that girls be admitted to Welton. Nolan [[Paddle (spanking)|paddles]] Charlie to coerce him into revealing who else is in the Dead Poets Society, but he resists. Nolan also speaks with Keating, warning him that he should discourage his students from questioning authority. Keating admonishes the boys in his manner, warning that one must assess all consequences.\n\nNeil becomes devastated after his father discovers his involvement in the play and demands he quit on the eve of the opening performance. He goes to Keating, who advises him to stand his ground and prove to his father that his love of acting is something he takes seriously. Neil's father unexpectedly shows up at the performance. He angrily takes Neil home and has him withdrawn from Welton and enrolled in a military academy. Lacking any support from his concerned mother, and unable to explain how he feels to his father, a distraught Neil commits suicide.\n\nNolan investigates Neil's death at the request of the Perry family. Cameron blames Neil's death on Keating to escape punishment for his own participation in the Dead Poets Society, and names the other members. Confronted by Charlie, Cameron urges the rest of them to let Keating take the fall. Charlie punches Cameron and is expelled. Each of the boys is called to Nolan's office to sign a letter attesting to the truth of Cameron's allegations, even knowing they are false. When Todd's turn comes, he is reluctant to sign, but does so after seeing that the others have complied and succumbs to his parents' pressure.\n\nKeating is fired and Nolan takes over teaching the class, with the intent of adhering to traditional Welton rules. Keating interrupts the class to gather his leftover belongings. As he leaves, Todd reveals to Keating that the boys were intimidated into signing the paper that sealed his fate, and he assures Todd that he believes him. Nolan threatens to expel Todd. Todd stands up on his desk, with the words \"[[O Captain! My Captain!]]\", which prompts Nolan to threaten him again. The other members of the Dead Poets Society (except for Cameron), as well as several other students in the class, do the same, to Nolan's fury and Keating's pleased surprise. Keating thanks the boys and departs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robin Williams]] as John Keating\n* [[Robert Sean Leonard]] as Neil Perry\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Todd Anderson\n* [[Josh Charles]] as Knox Overstreet\n* [[Gale Hansen]] as Charlie Dalton\n* [[Norman Lloyd]] as Headmaster Gale Nolan\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as Thomas Perry\n* [[Dylan Kussman]] as Richard Cameron\n* [[Allelon Ruggiero]] as Steven Meeks\n* [[James Waterston]] as Gerard Pitts\n* [[Alexandra Powers]] as Chris Noel\n* [[Leon Pownall]] as George McAllister, Latin teacher<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/dead-poets-society/characters |title=LitCharts |access-date=January 6, 2020 |archive-date=July 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729042710/https://www.litcharts.com/lit/dead-poets-society/characters |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[George Martin (American actor)|George Martin]] as Dr. Hager, mathematics teacher\n* Carla Belver as Mrs. Perry\n* Jane Moore\u00a0as Mrs. Danburry\n* Kevin Cooney\u00a0as Joe Danburry\n* Colin Irving as Chet Danburry\n* Matt Carey as Kurt Hopkins \n* John Cunningham as Mr. Anderson\n* [[Lara Flynn Boyle]]\u00a0as Ginny Danburry (scenes deleted)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nPeter Weir had been eager to follow up his two US breakthrough hits with [[Harrison Ford]], ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' and ''[[The Mosquito Coast (film)|The Mosquito Coast]]'',{{dubious|date=August 2021}} with a romantic comedy starring [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as a Frenchman who marries an American for convenience called ''[[Green Card (film)|Green Card]]''.
