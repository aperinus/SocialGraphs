It stars [[Sean Penn]] and [[Christopher Walken]], with [[Mary Stuart Masterson]], Sean's brother [[Chris Penn]], [[David Strathairn]], [[Crispin Glover]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], and [[Eileen Ryan]] in supporting roles.\n\n==Plot==\nBrad Whitewood Sr. is a career criminal and the leader of his family's gang of rural back-door criminals. Sr's criminal enterprises intersect when his son, Brad Whitewood Jr., a floundering, out-of-work teenager living in near squalor with his mother, grandmother, brother and mother's boyfriend, comes to stay with him.  When his father shows up in a flashy car with a pocket full of hundred dollar bills, Brad Jr. formulates a desire to join his father's life of crime.  At first Jr. starts a gang with his brother, Tommy, fencing their stolen goods through Brad Sr.'s criminal network.  As a result of entanglements with his 16-year-old girlfriend, Terry, Brad Jr. seeks full entry into his father's gang, but after witnessing a murder he tries to back out.  Eventually Brad Jr's gang is arrested while attempting to  steal tractors, and the FBI and local law enforcement attempt to lean on Brad Jr. to get him to turn evidence on his father's gang.\n\nDuring Brad Jr.'s time in jail, Brad Sr. becomes convinced that Terry is a risk to his activities, thinking that Brad Jr. may confide details to Terry and that she has a big mouth. In an attempt to destroy her relationship with Brad Jr., Brad Sr. rapes Terry after getting her drunk and stoned.  After a prison visit where Terry, accompanied by Brad Jr's mother, has a conversation with Brad Jr., it seems that Brad Jr. begins to cooperate with the police.  The members of Brad Jr's gang are subpoenaed, and Brad Sr. feels his only recourse is to eliminate them. The gang kills Lucas, Aggie and Tommy. Brad Jr. and Terry plan to flee to Montana, but they are ambushed. Terry is killed, and Brad Jr. is seriously wounded. Brad Jr. confronts his father armed with his father's gun, intending on killing him, but decides instead to cooperate with police.\n\nUltimately Brad Jr. sits on the witness stand in his father's trial.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Bradford \"Brad\" Whitewood Jr.\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Bradford \"Brad\" Whitewood Sr.\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Terry\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Thomas \"Tommy\" Whitewood\n* [[Millie Perkins]] as Julie\n* [[Eileen Ryan]] as Grandma\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Uncle Patch Whitewood\n* [[R.

Leonard was turned down by Paramount for that project, but Madonna, who was at the time married to Sean Penn, decided that the theme would work well for ''At Close Range''. She composed the lyrics and presented a demo cassette to director [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]], and suggested Leonard compose the film's soundtrack. The theme with Madonna's lyrics became the single \"[[Live to Tell]]\". A slower instrumental version opened the film's main title sequence, a harbinger of the end credit sequence, which was accompanied by the version from Madonna's album ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]''. Versions of the instrumental show up throughout. The instrumental score by Leonard remained unreleased until a version of the main titles appeared on the Internet in 2014, although the 45 single of \"Live to Tell\" included a B-side incomplete instrumental version of the score.\n\nThe music to the film included a number of singles from the late \u201870s, including \"[[Miss You (The Rolling Stones song)|Miss You]]\" by [[The Rolling Stones]], \"[[Boogie Oogie Oogie]]\" by [[A Taste of Honey (band)|A Taste of Honey]], as well as a number of arrangements featuring [[LeRoux (band)|LeRoux]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the ''At Close Range'' 3\u00bd (out of 4) stars, noting that \"few recent films have painted such a bleak picture of human nature\". He described Penn as \"probably the best of the younger actors\", while lauding Walken's \"hateful\" performance.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/at-close-range-1986 |title=At Close Range Movie Review & Film Summary (1986) {{!}} Roger Ebert |access-date= 2013-08-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130716053115/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/at-close-range-1986 |archive-date= 2013-07-16 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAt [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 23 reviews, with an average score of 7.2/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/at_close_range/|title=At Close Range|work=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=November 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107182733/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/at_close_range/|archive-date=2015-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref> It holds a score of 67 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] from 9 appraisals, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/at-close-range |title = At Close Range Reviews - Metacritic| website=[[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nDespite the accolades and warm reviews, the film was not a box office success.
