The film is based on the struggles of Van Peebles' father [[Melvin Van Peebles]] (played by Mario himself), as he attempts to film and distribute ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'', a film that was widely credited with showing [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] that a viable [[African-American]] audience existed, and thus influencing the creation of the [[Blaxploitation]] genre. The film also stars [[Joy Bryant]], [[Nia Long]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]], [[Rainn Wilson]], and [[Terry Crews]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as [[Melvin Van Peebles]], Melvin (played by his real-life son, Mario), has recently found success with his film ''[[Watermelon Man (film)|Watermelon Man]]''. Although offered a three-picture contract by [[Columbia Pictures]], Melvin is pushed by his agent, Howie Kaufman, to follow up with a comedy. Disgusted by the mainstream cinematic portrayal of African-Americans as either villains or comic relief, Melvin decides to make a film with \"ghetto realism\" to portray the Black community as he knows it. This is underscored in ''Sweetback'''s opening credits, with the line \"Starring: The Black Community\".\n** Melvin as Himself also appears in a [[cameo appearance|cameo]].\n* [[Adam West]] as Bert, one of the first investors Melvin visits to finance his film; Melvin manages to get a meeting with this man through his friend Bill. The meeting at Bert's beach house goes well at first, with Bert commenting that Melvin's stubbornness is much like his own. Bert also marks it as an attribute that shows Melvin is different, with a vision that he will not compromise for the sake of following the status quo. Later on, though, Melvin decides not to go through with the business partnership when Bert uncovers himself and comes on to Melvin, inviting him to swim together. \n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Clyde Houston, Melvin, at first, has no idea how he will be able to produce his film without being shut down. Upon passing an adult theatre, he comes up with the idea to disguise the movie as a black porno, thereby enabling it to pass any scrutiny that would keep it from production. Sitting in on a movie, Melvin notices the name \"Clyde Houston\" repeatedly appears in the credits. Seeking him out, Melvin hires Clyde, another African-American in the film industry, to be his production manager. However, during production, due to mounting stress, Melvin fires Clyde.\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as Angry Brother, at the casting call for the lead role of Sweetback, this character shows up and delivers the line with a major stutter. Although he is mocked by the other auditionees, Melvin embraces the man's stutter as \"real\" and casts him in another role. When the time comes to shoot the scene, though, the actor is shown to have taken speech classes, getting rid of his speech impediment. The situation is easily remedied, though, when Melvin takes the actor's gun from him. In his angered and flustered state, his stutter returns and the scene is shot without a problem.\n* [[John Singleton]] as \"Detroit J\"\n* [[Joy Bryant]] as Priscilla, Melvin's young, ambitious secretary. Every time she enters the room to notify Melvin or give him some important information, she turns it into an audition, promoting herself all the time to be in his movie. Although Melvin relents and gives her a role, she ends up turning down the part because her boyfriend does not approve. Although this proves to be a minor setback, it is Priscilla that recommends her boyfriend, Maurice, to Melvin to get his group [[Earth, Wind, & Fire]], to do the music for the movie.\n* [[Karimah Westbrook]] as Ginnie, Melvin first meets Ginnie at a party hosted by Bill, and they sleep together. Although she appears to be minor at first, Melvin later calls her to be in the movie. After Priscilla quits, Melvin is desperate to cast Ginnie in an early scene of the movie. Although she initially believes it to be an [[pornographic film|erotic piece]], threatening to leave the set and throwing another obstacle in Melvin's path, Melvin manages to convince her of its true purpose, to create something that portrays Blacks with an eye to reality instead of in a continually subservient role. After being convinced, along with some money upfront, Ginnie is convinced to star.\n* [[Khalil Kain]] as [[Maurice White|Maurice]], Priscilla's Boyfriend, and a member of the (at-the-time) fledging [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] group [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. His initial action is to restrict Priscilla from acting in the movie, but he, with his group, later create the soundtrack with Melvin. Their production is spurred on by a $500 check Melvin cuts them, even though it ends up bouncing when they try to cash it.\n* [[Khleo Thomas]] as [[Mario Van Peebles|Mario]], young Mario has a role in the film as the child Sweetback.\n* [[Len Lesser]] as Manny Goldberg / Mort Goldberg, twin owners of one of two theaters that picks up ''Sweetback'', they first plan to show it between two other films as part of a triple-feature. Melvin, wanting to impress upon them the film's importance, wagers two tailored suits in order to get them to show the movie by itself. Although this move may be seen as one of either supreme confidence or supreme desperation, it pays off, as the film garners much more attendance and revenue for the owners than they previously had.\n* [[Nia Long]] as Sandra, Melvin's girlfriend helps him manage his children throughout production. Although she has not grown up with such a clear view of the oppression faced by African-Americans of the time, she is still extremely supportive of Melvin's undertaking.\n* [[Ossie Davis]] as Granddad, Albeit a gruff figure, he too helps Melvin take care of his children and also appears in minor role.\n* [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]] as Jose Garcia, Puerto Rican cameraman, Jose acts as a symbol of the unifying nature of not just the film, but its creation as well.\n* Penny Bae Bridges as Megan Van Peebles, one of Melvin's children, acting in a minor role in the film.\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Bill Harris, Melvin's friend who tries but fails to acquire financial backing for the film. Even though the film ends up being independently financed by Melvin himself, with the help of [[Bill Cosby]], Bill stays on the crew to assist production.\n* [[Saul Rubinek]] as Howie Kaufman, Melvin's agent, Howie pushes Melvin to sign a contract with Columbia Pictures. Although Melvin does not end up doing so, Howie helps Melvin post-production in finding distributors for the film. Although Howie is his agent, he is far from being solely after money, as evidenced by the close relationship he has with Melvin's kids.\n* [[Terry Crews]] as \"Big T\", crew member that acts as sound assistant and security for the crew, Big T ends up being part of the group that is arrested by the cops for alleged theft. Although he almost leaves, threatening Melvin in the process, he is convinced to stay after an impassioned speech by Melvin that shows him the importance of the film to the community.\n* [[T. K. Carter]] as [[Bill Cosby]], while not delivering a major number of lines, ends up loaning Melvin $50,000 to finish production, with the only stipulation being that he gets his money back. His contribution brings yet more emphasis on the film's recognized importance by all its cast and crew.\n**Cosby as Himself also appears in a cameo.\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Jerry, [[Cinemation]] employee who initially manages to distribute ''Sweetback'' to two theaters across America.\n* [[Wesley Jonathan]] as \"Panther\", although seen leaving midway through a showing, he returns with 22 other members of the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]]. Recognizing the revolutionary film to be of immense cultural substance, he helps bring crowds to the film, even though it stands on its own as opposed to being a part of a greater number of movies.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mostly positive reviews, with a 91% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a 75/100 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/baadasssss/ ''Baadasssss!''] on Rotten Tomatoes.
