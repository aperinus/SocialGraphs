In the United States, the film was [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rated NC-17]] for \"nudity and erotic sexuality throughout, some graphic language, and sexual violence.\" ''Showgirls'' was the first (and to date only) NC-17-rated film to be given a [[wide release]] in mainstream theaters.<ref name=\"nytimes-nc17\">{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/21/movies/first-major-film-with-an-nc-17-rating-is-embraced-by-the-studio.html |title=First Major Film With an NC-17 Rating Is Embraced by the Studio |work= The New York Times|access-date=May 21, 2008 | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=July 21, 1995 | quote = \"Showgirls\" cost $40 million to $45 million }}</ref> Distributor [[United Artists]] dispatched several hundred staffers to theaters across North America playing ''Showgirls'' to ensure that patrons would not sneak into the theater from other films, and to make sure film-goers were over the age of 17.

This edited version runs 3 minutes shorter (128 minutes) and deletes some of the more graphic footage. ''Showgirls'' was a critical failure upon release, panned for its acting (particularly Berkley's), characters, dance numbers, directing, plot, screenplay and sex scenes and consistently ranked as [[List of films considered the worst#Showgirls (1995)|one of the worst films ever made]]. Despite this, ''Showgirls'' has become regarded as a [[cult film]] and has been subject to critical re-evaluation, with some notable directors and critics considering it a serious satire worthy of praise.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |title=Showgirls (Paul Verhoeven, 1995) - La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise |url=https://www.cinematheque.fr/film/59963.html |access-date=2022-03-25 |website=www.cinematheque.fr}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nNomi Malone is a young drifter who hitchhikes to Las Vegas hoping to make it as a showgirl. After a driver she hitchhiked with robs her, Nomi meets Molly Abrams, a costume designer who takes Nomi in as a roommate. Molly invites Nomi backstage at ''Goddess'', the [[Stardust Resort & Casino|Stardust Casino]] show where she works, to meet Cristal Connors, the diva star of the casino's topless dance revue. When Nomi tells Cristal she dances at [[Cheetah's Topless Club]], Cristal derisively tells her that what she does is akin to prostitution. When Nomi is too upset to go to work that night, Molly takes her dancing at the Crave Club. Nomi is arrested after causing a fight involving James, a bouncer at the club. James bails Nomi out of jail, but she pays him little notice.\n\nCristal and her boyfriend, Zack Carey, the entertainment director at the Stardust, visit Cheetah's and request a [[lap dance]] from Nomi. Although the [[bisexual]] Cristal is attracted to Nomi, her request is based more on her desire to humiliate Nomi by proving she engages in [[sex work]]. Nomi reluctantly performs the lap dance after Cristal offers her $500. James happens to be at the strip club and sneaks a peek at Nomi's lap dance. He visits Nomi's trailer the next morning and tells Nomi that what she is doing is no different from prostitution. Nomi and James have a brief fling; the affair ends when James gives the dance routine he choreographed for Nomi to Penny, a former coworker of Nomi's whom he gets pregnant.\n\nCristal arranges for Nomi to audition for the chorus line of ''Goddess''. Tony Moss, the show's director, humiliates Nomi by asking her to put ice on her nipples to make them hard. Furious, Nomi abruptly leaves the audition after scattering ice everywhere in a fit. Despite her outburst, Nomi gets the job and quits Cheetah's. Cristal further humiliates Nomi by suggesting she make a \"goodwill appearance\" at a boat trade show, which turns out to be a thinly disguised prostitution set-up.\n\nUndeterred, Nomi sets out to get revenge against Cristal and claim her mantle. She seduces Zack, who secures an audition for her to be Cristal's understudy. Nomi wins the role, but when Cristal threatens legal action against the Stardust, the offer is rescinded. After Cristal taunts her, Nomi pushes her down a flight of stairs, breaking her hip, and replaces her as the show's lead. Although Nomi has finally secured the fame she sought, she alienates Molly, who realizes she pushed Cristal down the stairs.\n\nMolly later relents and attends Nomi's opening-night celebration at a posh hotel, where she meets her idol, musician Andrew Carver. Carver lures Molly to a room, where he brutally beats her and leads his bodyguards in [[gang-rape|gang-raping]] her. Molly is hospitalized after the assault. Nomi wants to report the assault to the police, but Zack tells her that the Stardust will bribe Molly with [[hush money]] to protect Carver, their star performer. Zack then confronts Nomi about her sordid past: Her birth name is Polly, and she became a runaway and prostitute after her parents' [[murder-suicide]]. She has been arrested several times for drug possession, prostitution, and assault with a deadly weapon. Zack blackmails Nomi by vowing to keep her past quiet if she will not tell the police about the assault.\n\nUnable to obtain justice for Molly without exposing her past, Nomi decides to take justice into her own hands. She gets Carver alone in his hotel room and beats him severely. Nomi then pays two hospital visits, one to Molly to let her know that Carver's actions did not go unpunished, and another to Cristal to apologize for injuring her. Cristal admits she pulled a similar stunt years ago. Because her lawyers secure her a large cash settlement, Cristal forgives Nomi, and they exchange a kiss. Nomi leaves Las Vegas and hitches a ride to Los Angeles, coincidentally with the same driver who stole her possessions when she arrived, whom she robs at knifepoint.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Elizabeth Berkley]] as Nomi Malone\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Zack Carey\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Cristal Connors\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as James Smith\n* [[Robert Davi]] as Al Torres\n* [[Alan Rachins]] as Tony Moss\n* [[Gina Ravera]] as Molly Abrams\n* [[Lin Tucci]] as Henrietta 'Mama' Bazoom\n* [[Greg Travis]] as Phil Newkirk\n* [[Al Ruscio]] as Sam Karlman\n* [[Patrick Bristow]] as Marty Jacobsen\n* [[William Shockley (actor)|William Shockley]] as Andrew Carver\n* Michelle Johnston as Gay Carpenter\n* Pamela Anderson as Party Singer\n* [[Jim Ishida]] as Mr. Okida\n* Dewey Weber as Jeff\n* [[Rena Riffel]] as Penny / Hope\n* Melissa Williams as Julie\n* Ungela Brockman as Annie\n* Melinda Songer as Nikki\n* [[Bobbie Phillips]] as Dee\n* [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] as ''Goddess'' Dancer\n}}\n\n==Music==\nThe soundtrack of the film featured songs specially composed for the film by artists such as [[David Bowie]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Killing Joke]] and [[No Doubt]].

During lunch in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], Verhoeven told Eszterhas that he had always loved \"big [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] musicals\", and wanted to make one; Eszterhas suggested the setting of Las Vegas.<ref name=\"Keesey\">{{cite book|last=Keesey|first=Douglas|year=2005|title=Paul Verhoeven|pages=136|isbn=978-3-8228-3101-4}}</ref> Based on the idea he scribbled on a napkin, Eszterhas was advanced $2&nbsp;million to write the script<ref name=\"NYT\">Maureen Dowd, \"Bucks and Blondes: Joe Eszterhas Lives The Big Dream\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 30, 1993.</ref> and picked up an additional $1.7 million when the studio produced it into a film. This, along with the scripts for both Verhoeven's previous film ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992) and ''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'' (1993, also an [[erotic thriller]] starring [[Sharon Stone]]), made Eszterhas the highest-paid screenwriter in Hollywood history.<ref name=\"Nerve\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nerve.com/filmlounge/interview/joeeszterhas|title=The Nerve Interview: Joe Eszterhas|publisher=[[Nerve (website)|Nerve.com]]|date=September 15, 2006|access-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> Verhoeven deferred 70% of his $6 million director's fee depending on if the film turned a profit.<ref name=\"Keesey\"/>\n\n\"I wrote ''Showgirls'' at the single most turbulent moment of my life,\" said Eszterhas later. \"The stuff I've done since then has more warmth, more humor, is more upbeat.\"<ref name=\"post\"/>\n\nA long list of actresses was considered for the role of Nomi Malone, including [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Vanessa Marcil]], [[Jenny McCarthy]], [[Denise Richards]], and [[Charlize Theron]], but they all turned it down before Elizabeth Berkley, following the cancellation of ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'', signed on to play the role.

MacLachlan recalled, \"That was a decision that was sort of a tough one to make, but I was enchanted with Paul Verhoeven. Particularly ''[[RoboCop]]'', which I loved ...

In 1997, Eszterhas said:\n<blockquote>Clearly we made mistakes. Clearly it was one of the biggest failures of our time. It failed commercially, critically, it failed on videotape, it failed internationally. . . . In retrospect, part of it was that Paul and I were coming off of ''Basic'', which defied the critics and was a huge success. Maybe there was a certain hubris involved: \"We can do what we want to do, go as far out there as we want.\" That rape scene was a god-awful mistake. In retrospect, a terrible mistake. And musically it was eminently forgettable. And in casting mistakes were made.<ref name=\"post\"/></blockquote>\nMacLachlan recalled seeing the film for the first time at the premiere:\n<blockquote>I was absolutely gobsmacked. I said, \"This is horrible. Horrible!\" And it's a very slow, sinking feeling when you're watching the movie, and the first scene comes out, and you're like, \"Oh, that's a really bad scene.\" But you say, \"Well, that's okay, the next one'll be better.\" And you somehow try to convince yourself that it's going to get better\u2026 and it just gets worse. And I was like, \"Wow. That was crazy.\" I mean, I really didn't see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie. Now, of course, it has a whole other life as a sort of inadvertent\u2026 satire. No, \"satire\" isn't the right word. But it's inadvertently funny. So it's found its place. It provides entertainment, though not in the way I think it was originally intended. It was just\u2026 maybe the wrong material with the wrong director and the wrong cast.<ref name=\"av\"/><ref name=\"post\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/10/25/sleazy-writer/7b99825a-9214-4cb3-ae2c-d80cbb243fa8/?noredirect=on|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=Sleazy Writer|first=Sharon|last=Waxman|date=October 25, 1997 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 23% based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 3.9/10.

According to writer [[Naomi Klein]], [[Irony|ironic]] enjoyment of the film initially arose among those with the video before MGM capitalized on the idea. MGM noticed the video was performing well because \"trendy twenty-somethings were throwing ''Showgirls'' irony parties, laughing sardonically at the implausibly poor screenplay and shrieking with horror at the aerobic sexual encounters\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Naomi|last=Klein|author-link=Naomi Klein|title=[[No Logo]]|publisher=[[Knopf Canada]]|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|date=1999|isbn=0-312-20343-8|page=79}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, ''Showgirls'' is shown at [[midnight movie]]s alongside such films as ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]''. It is heralded as one of the best \"bad movies\", a [[Camp (style)|camp]] classic in the vein of ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]''. Although the film was not successful when first released theatrically, it generated more than $100&nbsp;million from video rentals<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/><ref name=\"nypost\"/> and became one of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s top 20 all-time bestsellers.<ref name=\"classic-web.archive.org\"/> Verhoeven accepted the film's unexpected cult status, saying \"Maybe this kind of ritualistic cult popularity isn't what I intended, but it's like a resurrection after the crucifixion.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Shaw|first=Jessica|date=March 22, 1996|title=Party girls: \"Showgirls,\" \"Pride and Prejudice\" |url=https://ew.com/article/1996/03/22/party-girls-showgirls-pride-and-prejudice/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|access-date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> Eszterhas, however, maintains that the humor was intentional: \"What Paul [Verhoeven] and I had in mind was something darkly funny. We went through the script line by line, and we were really laughing at some of it. I defy people to tell me that a line like, 'How does it feel not to have anybody coming on you anymore' isn't meant to be funny.\"<ref name=\"Nerve\"/>\n\nIn Ireland, the film was banned on November 8, 1995. The [[Irish Film Censor Board]] chair Sheamus Smith provided no explanation for the ban, but it had been speculated that the ban was owed to the film's rape scene, which was initially cut in the United Kingdom. In fact, Smith banned the film upon initial release because of the line, \"I got bigger tits than the fuckin' Virgin Mary and I got a bigger mouth, too.\" Smith's objection was specifically to the diction \"fuckin' Virgin Mary\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Showgirls' banned in Ireland|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/11/25/Showgirls-banned-in-Ireland/1371817275600/|website=UPI|date=November 25, 1995|access-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|first=Michael|last=Dwyer|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/gratuitously-violent-film-banned-1.45461?mode=amp|title='Gratuitously violent' film banned|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|location=Dublin, Ireland|date=May 3, 1996|language=en|access-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"everythinglist\">{{cite web|title=Banned Films|url=https://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1823815|website=Everything2|publisher=Everything2|access-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref><ref name=boardsielist>{{cite web|title=Films banned in Ireland|url=https://www.boards.ie/b/thread/113288|website=boards.ie|access-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref> The film was passed uncut for its video release on October 23, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Showgirls|url=http://ifco.ie/website/IFCO/ifcoweb.nsf/SearchViewVideo/59A3ECCCF6C0ED0F802581C300736BD9?OpenDocument&OpenUp=True|website=IFCO: Irish Film Classification Office|publisher=Irish Film Classification Office|access-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe rights to show the film on television were eventually purchased by the [[VH1]] network. Because of the film's frequent nudity, though, a [[Censorship|censored]] version was created with black bras and panties digitally rendered to hide all exposed breasts and genitalia. Also, several scenes were removed entirely, shortening the movie by at least 45 minutes.

On NBC's [[NewsRadio]], a running joke where billionaire WNYX owner Jimmy James has a running list of potential wives made a reference to \"Showgirls\" when James is asked by station manager Dave Nelson about the wives' list.

The NC-17 version was also released on [[LaserDisc]] that year.\n\n''Showgirls'' was released on DVD for the first time on April 25, 2000. Special features included only the original theatrical trailer and a special behind-the-scenes featurette. The NC-17 version was re-released on VHS the same day as part of the MGM Movie Time collection.\n\nIn 2004, MGM released the \"V.I.P. Edition\" on DVD in a special boxed set containing two shot glasses, movie cards with [[drinking game]]s on the back, a deck of playing cards, and a nude poster of Berkley with a pair of suction-cup [[pasties]] so viewers can play \"pin the pasties on the showgirl\". The DVD itself includes several bonus features, including a \"how-to\" tutorial for giving a lap dance hosted by real strippers, and a special optional \"trivia track\" feature. When on, it adds humorous comments and factoids in the vein of VH1's ''[[Pop Up Video]]'' that relate to the scenes as they play out. It also includes \"The Greatest Movie Ever Made: a commentary by David Schmader\". In 2007, MGM re-released the V.I.P. Edition DVD without the physical extras.\n\nOn June 15, 2010, MGM released a 15th Anniversary \"Sinsational Edition\" in a two-disc dual-format [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]/DVD edition.<ref name=\"Blu-ray\">{{cite news|title = Showgirls 15th Anniversary Blu-ray Announced|date = April 12, 2010 | url = https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=4424 | access-date = April 12, 2010 }}</ref> This edition contains most of the same bonus features as the V.I.P. Edition DVD, except the trivia text feature has been reformatted. The NC-17 edit of the film is used.\n\nThe trivia track on the 2010 edition contains some errors, such as a statement that some of the dancers featured in the film were recruited from the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] cheerleaders, an impossibility as the XFL was not formed until 2001.\n\nThe film is classified R18+ in New Zealand and Australia for its violence, offensive language, and sex scenes; the Blu-ray lacks any special features despite featuring the same cover as the American \"Sinsational Edition\", while the DVD comes with a single theatrical trailer.\n\nIn 2016, ''Showgirls'' was restored in 4K from the original negative. The image restoration was carried out by the Technicolor laboratory and the sound restoration by the L.E. Diapason laboratory, under the supervision of Paul Verhoeven and Path\u00e9. The restored version was released on blu-ray following a theatrical run.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn September 22, 2020, ''Showgirls'' was made available for streaming on [[HBO Max]], since [[Warner Bros.

The Musical'' was mounted by Bob and Tobly McSmith of Medium Face Productions. Originating at the Krane Theater in [[New York City]], critical and audience response was overwhelmingly positive. It was moved to a 200-seat off-Broadway theater, XL Nightclub. The production continued to be successful; its original run was extended through July 15, 2013. Actress [[Rena Riffel]] reprised her role in the film as Penny for one month of the production.\n\nThe show closely mimics the film's plot and often directly incorporates dialog. As the title suggests, it is a musical. Highly satirical while staying true to the source's campy nature, the original off-Broadway production starred April Kidwell as Nomi, whose performance has been critically lauded. Andy Webster of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated \"The coltish April Kidwell, as Nomi, is a wonder. Amid an exhausting onslaught of often obvious ribaldry, she is tireless, fearless, and performing circles around Elizabeth Berkley's portrayal in the movie.
