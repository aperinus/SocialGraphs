It tells the semi-autobiographical story of two boys in [[Brooklyn]] dealing with their parents' divorce in 1986. The film is named after the [[giant squid]] and [[sperm whale]] [[diorama]] housed at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], which is seen in the film. The film was shot on [[Super 16&nbsp;mm]], mostly using a handheld camera.\n\nAt the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]], the film won awards for best dramatic direction and screenwriting, and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize. Baumbach later received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. The film received six [[Independent Spirit Award]] nominations and three [[Golden Globe]] nominations. Baumbach became one of the few screenwriters to ever sweep \"The Big Four\" critics awards ([[Los Angeles Film Critics' Association]], [[National Board of Review]], [[National Society of Film Critics]], and [[New York Film Critics' Circle]]).\n\n==Plot==\nIt is 1986. Bernard Berkman is an arrogant, once-promising novelist whose career has gone into a slow decline; he cannot find an agent. His unfaithful wife, Joan, has recently begun publishing her own work to widespread acclaim, which only increases the growing tension between them. One day, Bernard and Joan tell their two sons, 16-year-old Walt and 12-year-old Frank, that they are separating, with Bernard renting a house on the other side of [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] from their home in [[Park Slope]], [[Brooklyn]].\n\nThe parents agree to joint custody, and to spending equal time with their children, but, after separation, the parental relationship becomes more combative than before. Joan begins dating Ivan, Frank's tennis instructor, and Bernard starts sharing his new house with Lili, one of his students. The two boys begin taking sides in the battle between their parents, with Frank siding with his mother and Walt with his father. Walt idolizes his father: he blames his mother and tries to emulate his father.\n\nAlong with the trouble both boys exhibit verbally with their parents, they also show internal struggles and very different ways of handling the stress of their parents' divorce. Frank repeatedly masturbates at school; he begins to drink beer and imitates Ivan's mannerisms.  Over-influenced by his father, Walt spoils his relationship with Sophie, his girlfriend, and she breaks up with him. He performs and claims to have written [[Hey You (Pink Floyd song)|\"Hey You\"]] by [[Pink Floyd]] at his school's talent show.  After he wins first place and receives praise from his family and friends, his school realizes that he did not write the song.  At this point, the school calls Bernard and Joan in to discuss Walt. They all agree that he should see the school psychologist.\n\nAt the meeting with the psychologist, Walt starts to see things without the taint of his father's opinions.  The psychologist asks Walt for a happy memory. After some reluctance, he tells how his mother would take him, when he was very young, to see the giant squid and whale exhibit at the [[American Museum of Natural History#Milstein Hall of Ocean Life|American Museum of Natural History]]; the exhibit scared him, so he would look at it through his fingers. Then, at home, they would discuss what they saw. As they talked, the exhibit would become less scary. It becomes clear to Walt that his father was never really present, and that his mother was the one who cared for him.\n\nAfter a heated argument between Bernard and Joan over custody and whether Joan would take him back, Bernard collapses on the street outside their home and is taken to the hospital. Bernard asks Walt to stay by his side, but Walt instead runs to the Natural History Museum. The film ends with him standing in front of the exhibit, now able to look at it.\n[[File:Whale&Squid~11-29-08 (2).JPG|thumb|The [[American Museum of Natural History#Milstein Hall of Ocean Life|giant squid and whale exhibit]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].]]\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Bernard Berkman; a selfish and arrogant writer. \n* [[Laura Linney]] as Joan Berkman; a writer and unfaithful ex-wife.\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Walt Berkman\n* [[Owen Kline]] as Frank Berkman\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Lili\n* [[William Baldwin]] as Ivan\n* [[Halley Feiffer]] as Sophie Greenberg\n* [[Ken Leung]] as School Therapist\n* David Benger as Carl\n* Adam Rose as Otto\n* Peter Newman as Mr. Greenberg\n* Peggy Gormley as Mrs. Greenberg\n* [[Frankie Cosmos|Greta Kline]] as Greta Greenberg\n* [[Maryann Plunkett]] as Ms. Lemon\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as Pretty Girl\n\n== Production ==\n[[Bill Murray]], a frequent collaborator to producer [[Wes Anderson]], was considered for the role of Bernard Berkman.<ref>{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Bradford |date=17 February 2011 |title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray |url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray |archive-date=20 May 2015 |access-date=25 May 2015 |website=Splitsider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Farr |first=John |date=September 19, 2014 |title=Bill Murray and the Roles That Got Away |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-farr/bill-murray-and-the-roles_b_5850434.html |website=[[Huff Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Locke |first=Greg W. |date=26 August 2011 |title=The Top 25 Roles Bill Murray Didn't Take |url=http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125110247/http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/ |archive-date=25 November 2011 |access-date=25 May 2015 |website=Ze Catalist}}</ref> [[John Turturro]] was also considered for the role.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dawtrey |first=Adam |date=November 3, 2002 |title='Squid' puts squeeze on thesp threesome |url=https://variety.com/2002/scene/markets-festivals/squid-puts-sqeeze-on-thesp-threesome-1117875420/amp/ |website=Variety}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Squid and the Whale |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54477 |website=[[AFI Catalog]]}}</ref>\n\nNoah Baumbach looked to documentaries, [[French New Wave]] films, and [[John Cassavetes]] and early [[Martin Scorsese]] films when envisioning the style of the film.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Murray |first=Noel |date=2005-11-09 |title=Noah Baumbach |url=https://www.avclub.com/noah-baumbach-1798208785 |access-date=2022-10-12 |website=The A.V.
