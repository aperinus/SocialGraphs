Higgins]]' novel ''[[Cogan's Trade]]'' (1974). The film is about three small-time crooks who rob a [[Mafia|Mob]]-protected illegal gambling operation, which prompts the Mob to send in two hitmen, Jackie (Pitt) and Mickey ([[James Gandolfini]]), to deal with the perpetrators.\n\nOn May 22, 2012, the film premiered in competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] and received positive early reviews.<ref name=\"Official Selection\">{{cite web|title=2012 Official Selection|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58878.html|access-date=April 19, 2012|work=Cannes Film Festival}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=May 22, 2012|title=Andrew Dominik, a certain vision of capitalism|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/theDailyArticle/59338.html|access-date=May 22, 2012|work=Cannes Film Festival}}</ref> ''Killing Them Softly'' was released on November 30, 2012, by [[The Weinstein Company]] to mostly positive reviews, even though general audiences were less receptive to the film. It grossed $37.9 million against a budget of $15 million.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[American financial crisis]] and [[2008 United States presidential election|presidential election campaign]] in the autumn fall of 2008, Johnny \"Squirrel\" Amato plans to rob a [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] poker game. He enlists Frankie, a former business associate, and Russell, a [[heroin]]-addicted Australian expatriate who is stealing purebred dogs for money. They decide to target a game run by Markie Trattman, who is known to have previously orchestrated an inside job by paying two men to rob his own illegal poker game. Squirrel anticipates that Markie will be the obvious suspect because of this, and the Mafia will simply have him killed without investigating further.\n\nFrankie and Russell, although obviously amateurs, do the holdup and leave with the money. Afterwards, a mafioso named Driver hires hitman Jackie Cogan to deal with the situation. Although Jackie correctly intuits that Markie was uninvolved with the recent heist, he believes Markie still needs to die since he looks guilty, and an example needs to be made to discourage further robberies, but not without arranging for Markie to suffer a beating by mobsters Steve and Barry.\n\nUpon completing the crime, Russell travels to Florida to sell the dogs. While in Florida, he inadvertently informs a man named Kenny Gill of his involvement in the heist while trying to recruit him as a drug dealer. Kenny informs Jackie, who deduces that Russell, Frankie, and Squirrel were the perpetrators.\n\nJackie carries out the hit on Markie himself but brings in another hitman named Mickey Fallon, who is on parole in New York, to kill Squirrel. Jackie explains to Driver how he prefers \"killing them softly\"\u2014shooting his victims from a distance, without warning, giving them no opportunity to experience fear or despair\u2014and that his acquaintance with Squirrel risks complicating this approach.\n\nMickey postpones going through with his assigned hit, and instead indulges in drunkenness and sex with prostitutes in a hotel room. During conversation with Jackie, Mickey reveals that he has violated his parole, and doesn't seem to either care about nor really comprehend the consequences; instead he goes off on drunken tangents. It becomes clear to Jackie that the respected hitman has lost his nerve and ability to do his job. Jackie eventually decides to carry out the hit on Squirrel himself. He convinces Driver to arrange Mickey's arrest before the job has been completed.\n\nRussell is arrested on a drug possession charge and deported; meanwhile, Jackie confronts Frankie and convinces him to trade Squirrel's whereabouts for his life. Jackie has Frankie drive him to Squirrel; upon reaching Squirrel's apartment complex, he kills Squirrel with a shotgun. After confirming Squirrel is dead, Jackie has Frankie drive him to get his car several hours away. Frankie becomes very nervous and begins speeding. Unable to get Frankie to slow down, Jackie takes over driving. Once they arrive at the parking garage, Jackie shoots Frankie in the head without warning. Jackie then wipes down any fingerprints he might have left and leaves the scene.\n\nOn the night of the presidential election, Jackie meets with Driver to collect his fee for the three hits. On the TV in the bar, [[Barack Obama]] is giving his election victory speech. The two argue over his fee, with Driver trying to pay a lesser amount and Jackie insisting on the full sum. Referring to Obama's speech, Jackie angrily declares: \"This guy wants to tell me we're living in a community? Don't make me laugh. I'm living in America, and in America, you're on your own. America is not a country; it's just a business. Now fucking pay me.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Jackie Cogan\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Frankie\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Russell\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Mickey\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Driver\n* [[Vincent Curatola]] as Johnny \u201cSquirrel\u201d Amato\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Markie Trattman\n* [[Trevor Long (actor)|Trevor Long]] as Stevie Caprio\n* [[Max Casella]] as Barry Caprio\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Dillon\n* [[Slaine (rapper)|Slaine]] as Kenny Gill\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Killing Them Softly'' is based on the 1974 novel ''[[Cogan's Trade]]'' by [[George V. Higgins]], a best selling crime novelist whose works include ''[[The Friends of Eddie Coyle (novel)|The Friends of Eddie Coyle]]''. ''Cogan's Trade'', like Higgins' other novels, takes place in Boston; although filmed in the New Orleans area, characters in ''Killing Them Softly'' make several references to Boston area suburbs from the original novel. The film was written and directed by [[Andrew Dominik]], who chose to update the setting of the story, saying \"as I started adapting it, it was the story of an economic crisis, and it was an economic crisis in an economy that was funded by gambling\u2014and the crisis occurred due to a failure in regulation. It just seemed to have something that you couldn't ignore.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Benjamin|title=Cannes: 'Killing Them Softly' Helmer Andrew Dominik Talks Music As Film: 'Jesse James' Was My Leonard Cohen Song, 'Killing Them Softly' Is A Pop Tune|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/cannes-killing-them-softly-helmer-andrew-dominik-talks-music-as-film-jesses-james-was-my-leonard-cohen-song-killing-them-softly-is-a-pop-tune-20120523|work=The Playlist|access-date=September 10, 2012|date=May 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112205013/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/cannes-killing-them-softly-helmer-andrew-dominik-talks-music-as-film-jesses-james-was-my-leonard-cohen-song-killing-them-softly-is-a-pop-tune-20120523|archive-date=January 12, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe project was first announced in November 2010, when [[Brad Pitt]] was reported to be in talks to star in it.<ref>{{cite journal| last=McNary|first=Dave|url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118026781 |title=Brad Pitt in talks for 'Cogan's Trade'|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 2, 2010}}</ref> Dominik asked Pitt if he was interested in a role via a text message; he replied \"yes\" and the matter was settled over half an hour.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Vilkommerson|first=Sara|title=Fall Movies We Can't Wait To See \u2013 Killing Them Softly (Oct. 19)|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20483133_20624697_21199031,00.html|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=September 4, 2012|date=September 3, 2012}}</ref> Pitt previously co-starred in Dominik's ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007).
