Father \"Bobby\" Carillo, their parish priest and a youth offender himself in the past, tries to teach them right from wrong. They still play pranks and start running small errands for local gangster King Benny.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, the four boys steal a hotdog cart, which they accidentally roll down the subway stairs, severely injuring an elderly man. They are all sentenced to serve time at Wilkinson Home for Boys in [[Upstate New York]]; Shakes is given 6 to 12 months, while the others are given 12 to 18 months. During their stay, they are constantly subjected to sexual abuse and torture by head guards Sean Nokes, Henry Addison, Ralph Ferguson and Adam Styler.\n\nWhile at the facility, they participate in Wilkinson's annual [[American football|football]] game between the guards and inmates. Michael convinces black inmate Rizzo Robinson to help win the game. Humiliated, the guards move the boys to [[solitary confinement]] for weeks, where they are systematically beaten. Rizzo does not survive and his family is told that he had died of [[pneumonia]].\n\nIn the spring of 1968, shortly before Shakes' release from Wilkinson, he suggests the boys publicly report the abuse. The others refuse, with Michael asserting that no one would believe them or care, and they vow never to speak of it again. The night before Shakes is released, Nokes and the other guards arrange a \"farewell party\" in which the four boys are again brutally abused.\n\nIn 1981, John and Tommy, now career criminals, unexpectedly encounter Sean Nokes in a Hell's Kitchen pub. Confronting him, he dismisses the abuse he put them through, and John and Tommy shoot him dead in front of witnesses. Michael, now an assistant [[district attorney]], gets himself assigned to the case; he secretly intends to botch the [[prosecution]] and expose what the guards at Wilkinson's did. With Shakes, now a reporter, they form a plan to free John and Tommy and get revenge on the other Wilkinson abusers. With the help of King Benny and Carol, their childhood friend, they carry out their plan using information compiled by Michael on the backgrounds of the guards, helped by Danny Snyder, an alcoholic lawyer, to defend John and Tommy.\n\nMichael secretly drafts scripted questions in advance, so Snyder casts significant doubt on the testimony of a woman who witnessed the murder, and two other witnesses are intimidated into silence. For Michael's plan to fully succeed, however, he must damage Nokes' reputation and convincingly place John and Tommy at another location at the time of the shooting. Ferguson, when called as a witness, admits that Nokes, like the other guards, used to abuse the boys. To clinch the case, however, a key witness was still needed for John and Tommy's [[alibi]]. Shakes has a long talk with Father Bobby, who resists at first, but after learning the truth, reluctantly agrees to [[perjury|perjure]] himself. At trial, Father Bobby testifies John and Tommy were with him at a [[New York Knicks]] game at the time of the shooting and shows three ticket stubs to prove it. As a result, John and Tommy are [[acquittal|acquitted]].\n\nThe remaining guards are also punished for their crimes: Henry Addison, now a politician who still [[child molestation|molests]] children, is abducted and killed near the local [[airport]] by black gangsters led by Rizzo's older brother, Eddie \"Little Caesar\" Robinson, who heard the truth about Rizzo's death from King Benny; Adam Styler, now a corrupt police officer, is imprisoned for taking [[bribe]]s and murdering a drug dealer; and Ralph Fergurson, a social worker, loses his job and family and is left to live alone with his guilt for the rest of his life.\n\nMichael, Shakes, John, Tommy, and Carol meet at a local bar to celebrate. It is the last time the four are together. Shakes remains in Hell's Kitchen as a reporter; Michael quits the DA's office, moves to the [[England|English]] countryside, becomes a carpenter and never marries; John and Tommy both die before age 30 - John succumbs to [[liver cirrhosis]] due to excessive alcohol consumption while Tommy is ambushed and murdered by rival criminals. Carol remains in Hell's Kitchen as a social worker; she has a son, naming him John Thomas Michael Martinez, with the nickname \"Shakes\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change -->\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Tommy Marcano \n** [[Jonathan Tucker]] as Young Tommy Marcano\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as John Riley\n** [[Geoffrey Wigdor]] as Young John Riley\n* [[Jason Patric]] as [[Lorenzo Carcaterra|Lorenzo 'Shakes' Carcaterra]]\n** [[Joseph Perrino|Joe Perrino]] as Young Shakes\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Michael Sullivan \n** [[Brad Renfro]] as Young Michael Sullivan\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Sean Nokes\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Father Bobby Carillo\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as Carol Martinez \n** Monica Polito as Young Carol Martinez\n* [[Vittorio Gassman]] as Benny 'King Benny'\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Danny Snyder\n* [[Terry Kinney]] as Ralph Ferguson\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as lawyer\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Shakes' father\n* Frank Medrano as 'Fat' Mancho\n* [[Eugene Byrd]] as Rizzo Robinson\n* [[Jeffrey Donovan]] as Henry Addison\n* [[Wendell Pierce]] as Eddie 'Little Caesar' Robinson\n* [[Aida Turturro]] as Mrs. Salinas\n* [[Dash Mihok]] as K.C.\n* Angela Rago as Shakes' mother\n* [[John Slattery]] as Mr Carlson <ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117665/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_cl_sm | title=Sleepers (1996) - IMDb | website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe first words spoken in the film are: \"This is a true story about friendship that runs deeper than blood\".<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{Cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=October 18, 1996 |title=Sleepers movie review & film summary (1996) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sleepers-1996 |website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/22/movies/sleepers-debate-renewed-how-true-is-a-true-story.html|title='Sleepers' Debate Renewed: How True Is a 'True Story'?|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub| newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 22, 1996}}</ref> However, the truthfulness and factual accuracy of the film\u2014and the book upon which it is based\u2014were challenged by the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church and School in Manhattan (the school attended by Lorenzo Carcaterra) and by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, among others.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"Ebert\" /> Carcaterra has acknowledged that most details in the book were fictionalized, but maintained that the events described in the book actually occurred.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/379d8389d5244aeb17c81c9d534f525c|title='Sleepers': Nonfiction Without the Facts |website=APNews.com|last=Hampson |first=Rick |date=July 31, 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nIn its opening weekend the film grossed $12,305,745 in 1,915 theaters in the United States and Canada, debuting atop of the box office.
