The film is set in and around [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where it was filmed, and the screenplay was written by Aykroyd and Landis. It features musical numbers by [[rhythm and blues]] (R&B), [[Soul music|soul]], and [[blues]] singers [[James Brown]], [[Cab Calloway]] (in his final feature film role), [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Chaka Khan]], and [[John Lee Hooker]]. It features non-musical supporting performances by [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Henry Gibson]], [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]], [[Kathleen Freeman]] and [[John Candy]].\n\nThe story is a tale of redemption for paroled convict Jake and his [[blood brother]] Elwood, who set out on \"a mission from God\" to prevent foreclosure of the [[Roman Catholic]] orphanage in which they were raised. To do so, they must reunite their R&B band and organize a performance to earn $5,000 needed to pay the orphanage's [[property tax]] bill. Along the way, they are targeted by a homicidal \"mystery woman\", [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]], and a [[country music|country and western]] band\u2014all while being relentlessly pursued by the police.\n\n[[Universal Studios]], which had won the bidding war for the film, was hoping to take advantage of Belushi's popularity in the wake of ''Saturday Night Live'', the film ''[[Animal House]]'', and The Blues Brothers' musical success; it soon found itself unable to control production costs. The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, who was new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film one of the most expensive comedies ever produced.\n\nDue to concerns that the film would fail, its initial bookings were less than half of those similar films normally received. Released in the United States on June 20, 1980, it received mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed over $115 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video, and has become a [[cult film|cult classic]] over the years. A sequel, ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', was released in 1998 to critical and commercial failure. In 2020, ''The Blues Brothers'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite web | last=Alter | first=Rebecca | title=Shrek Has Been Inducted Into the National Film Registry | website=Vulture | date=2020-12-14 | url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/12/national-film-registry-2020-dark-knight-grease-and-shrek.html | access-date=2020-12-14 | archive-date=December 14, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201214210600/https://www.vulture.com/2020/12/national-film-registry-2020-dark-knight-grease-and-shrek.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBlues vocalist and petty criminal Jake Blues is released from prison after serving three years, and is picked up by his brother Elwood in his [[Bluesmobile]], a battered former police car. Elwood demonstrates its capabilities by jumping an open [[drawbridge]]. The brothers visit the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[orphanage]] where they were raised, and learn from Sister Mary Stigmata that it will be closed unless $5,000 in [[property tax]]es is collected. During a sermon by the Reverend Cleophus James at the Triple Rock [[Southern Baptist Convention|Baptist Church]], Jake has an epiphany: they can re-form their band, [[the Blues Brothers]], which disbanded while Jake was in prison, and raise the money to save the orphanage.\n\nThat night, state troopers attempt to arrest Elwood for driving with a suspended license due to 116 parking tickets and 56 moving violations. After a high-speed chase through the [[Dixie Square Mall]], the brothers escape. The next morning, as the police arrive at the [[flophouse]] where Elwood lives, a mysterious woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, but leaves Jake and Elwood unharmed, and saves them from being arrested.\n\nJake and Elwood begin tracking down members of the band. Five of them are performing as \"Murph and The MagicTones\" at a deserted [[Holiday Inn]] lounge, and quickly agree to rejoin. Another turns them down as he is the [[ma\u00eetre d']] at an expensive restaurant, but the brothers behave atrociously, refusing to leave the restaurant and threatening to go there every day for each meal until he relents. On their way to meet the final two band members, the brothers find the road through [[Jackson Park (Chicago)|Jackson Park]] blocked by an [[American Nazi Party]] demonstration on a bridge; Elwood runs them off the bridge into the East Lagoon. The commander orders one of his subordinates to trace their car license plate. The last two band members, who now run a [[soul food]] restaurant, re-join the band against the advice of one's wife. The reunited group obtain instruments and equipment from Ray's Music Exchange in [[Calumet City]], and Ray, as usual, takes an IOU.\n\nAs Jake attempts to book a gig, the mystery woman blows up the phone booth he is using; once again, he is miraculously unhurt. The band stumbles onto a gig at Bob's Country Bunker, a [[honky-tonk]] in [[Kokomo, Indiana]]. They win over the rowdy crowd but run up a bar tab higher than their pay, and infuriate the Good Ol' Boys, the country band that was ''actually'' booked for the gig.\n[[File:Rusty-s TV and Movie Car Museum Jackson TN 018.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of the \"Bluesmobile\" at Rusty's TV & Movie Car Museum, Jackson, Tennessee]]\n\nRealizing that they need one big show to raise the necessary money, the brothers persuade their old agent to book the Palace Hotel Ballroom, north of Chicago. They mount a loudspeaker atop the Bluesmobile and drive around the Chicago area promoting the concert\u2014but alert the police, the neo-Nazis, and the Good Ol' Boys of their whereabouts. The ballroom is packed with blues fans, police officers, and the Good Ol' Boys. Jake and Elwood perform two songs, then sneak offstage, as the tax deadline is rapidly approaching. A record company executive offers them a $10,000 cash advance on a recording contract\u2014more than enough to pay off the orphanage's taxes and Ray's IOU\u2014and then shows the brothers how to slip out of the building unnoticed. As they make their escape via a service tunnel, they are confronted by the mystery woman: Jake's vengeful ex-[[fianc\u00e9e]]. After her volley of [[M16 rifle]] bullets leaves them once again miraculously unharmed, Jake offers a series of ridiculous excuses that she declines, but when she looks in his eyes she takes interest in him again, allowing the brothers to escape to the Bluesmobile.\n\nJake and Elwood race back toward Chicago with dozens of state and local police and the Good Ol' Boys in pursuit. They eventually elude them all with a series of improbable maneuvers, including a miraculous gravity-defying escape from the neo-Nazis. At the [[Richard J. Daley Center]], they rush inside the adjacent [[Chicago City Hall]] building, soon followed by hundreds of police, [[State police|state troopers]], [[SWAT|SWAT teams]], [[Firefighter|firefighters]], [[Illinois National Guard|Illinois National Guardsmen]], and the [[Military Police]]. Finding the office of the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Assessor, the brothers pay the tax bill. Just as their receipt is stamped, they are arrested by the mob of law officers.

The name \"The Blues Brothers\" was the idea of [[Howard Shore]]. The fictional backstory and character sketches of blood brothers Jake and Elwood were developed by Aykroyd in collaboration with Ron Gwynne, who is credited as a story consultant for the film. As related in the liner notes of the band's debut album, ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]'', the brothers grew up in an orphanage, learned the blues from a janitor named Curtis, and sealed their brotherhood by cutting their middle fingers with a steel string said to have come from the guitar of [[Elmore James]].<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web | title=Fortune City-Blues Brothers | work=Biography of the Blues Brothers-From their album, A Briefcase Full of Blues | url=http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/fitzgerald/12/bio.html | access-date=December 16, 2008 | archive-date=October 7, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007024814/http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/fitzgerald/12/bio.html | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBelushi had become a star in 1978 as a result of both the Blues Brothers' musical success and his role in ''National Lampoon's Animal House''. At one point, he managed the triple feat of being the star of the week's top-grossing film and top-rated television series and singing on the No. 1 album within a year. When Aykroyd and Belushi decided they could make a Blues Brothers film, the bidding war was intense. [[Universal Studios]] narrowly beat [[Paramount Pictures]] for the project. John Landis, who had directed Belushi in ''Animal House'', was aboard as director.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\">{{cite news|last=Zeman|first=Ned|title=Soul Men: The Making of The Blues Brothers|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/making-of-blues-brothers-budget-for-cocaine|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=January 2013|access-date=December 18, 2012|archive-date=January 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117121815/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/making-of-blues-brothers-budget-for-cocaine|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the project had neither a budget nor a script. On the former issue, Universal head [[Lew Wasserman]] thought the film could be made for $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million. It would be impossible to settle on a specific amount without a screenplay to review, and after [[Mitch Glazer]] declined to help him, Aykroyd wrote one on his own.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nAykroyd had never written a screenplay before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary ''Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers'', or even read one, and he was unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard [[Screenplay#Format and style|screenplay format]], but more like [[free verse]].<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" /> To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the [[Los Angeles]] Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer [[Robert K. Weiss]]. He titled it \"The Return of the Blues Brothers\", and credited it to \"Scriptatron GL-9000\".<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\"/> Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay,<ref name=\"DVD doc\">''Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers'', documentary feature on 1998 DVD and 25th Anniversary DVD (2005).</ref> which took him about two weeks.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\n''The Blues Brothers'' held the record for the most cars destroyed in the course of production for 18 years, at 103, one fewer than were wrecked in its 1998 sequel ''Blues Brothers 2000''. Both were surpassed by ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]'' (2009), with 112 cars destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/419907/leading-movies-most-vehicle-damaged/|title=Movies with most cars destroyed 2013 - Statistic|website=Statista|access-date=March 22, 2018|archive-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072629/https://www.statista.com/statistics/419907/leading-movies-most-vehicle-damaged/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nAt Aykroyd's demand, soul and R&B stars [[James Brown]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Aretha Franklin]] were cast in speaking parts to support musical numbers built around them. This later caused friction in the production between Landis and Universal, as its costs far exceeded the original budget. Since none of them except Charles had any hits in recent years, the studio wanted the director to replace them with\u2014or add performances by\u2014younger acts, such as [[Rose Royce]], whose \"[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]\" had made them disco stars after its use in [[Car Wash (film)|the 1976 film of that name]].<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\"/>\n\nOther musicians in the cast include [[Big Walter Horton]], [[Pinetop Perkins]], and [[John Lee Hooker]] (who performed \"Boom Boom\" during the Maxwell Street scene). The members of The Blues Brothers Band were themselves notable. Steve Cropper and Donald Dunn are architects of the [[Stax Records]] sound (Cropper's guitar can be heard at the start of the [[Sam & Dave]] song \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\") and were half of [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. Horn players Lou Marini, Tom Malone, and Alan Rubin had all played in [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] and the house band on ''Saturday Night Live''. Drummer Willie Hall had played in [[The Bar-Kays]] and backed [[Isaac Hayes]]. Matt Murphy is a veteran blues guitarist. As the band developed at ''Saturday Night Live'', pianist [[Paul Shaffer]] was part of the act and thus cast in the film. However, due to contractual obligations with ''SNL'', he was unable to participate, so actor-musician Murphy Dunne (whose father, [[George Dunne]], was the Cook County Board President) was hired to take his role.<ref name=\"DVD doc\"/>\n\nFisher, Freeman, Gibson, and Candy were cast in non-musical supporting roles. The film is also notable for the number of cameo appearances by established celebrities and entertainment-industry figures, including [[Steve Lawrence]] as a booking agent, [[Twiggy]] as a \"chic lady\" in a [[Jaguar E-Type|Jaguar convertible]] whom Elwood propositions at a gas station, [[Steven Spielberg]] as the Cook County Assessor's clerk, Landis as a state trooper in the mall chase, Paul Reubens (before he became [[Pee-wee Herman]]) as a waiter in the restaurant Chez Paul, [[Joe Walsh]] in a cameo as the first prisoner to jump up on a table in the final scene, and [[Chaka Khan]] as the soloist in the Triple Rock choir. [[The Muppets|Muppet]] performer [[Frank Oz]] plays a [[Prison officer|corrections officer]], and in the scene where the brothers crash into Toys \"R\" Us, the customer who asks for a [[Miss Piggy]] doll is played by stunt coordinator [[Gary McLarty]]. Singer/songwriter [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]] is an Illinois State Trooper who complains that Jake and Elwood broke his watch (a result of the car chase in the mall). Makeup artist [[Layne Britton]] is the old card player who asks Elwood, \"Did you get me my Cheez Whiz, boy?\" The character portrayed by Cab Calloway is named Curtis as a homage to [[Curtis Salgado]], an [[Portland, Oregon|Oregon]] blues musician who inspired Belushi while he was in that area filming ''Animal House''.<ref name=\"CS\">{{cite web|title=Biography|work=Curtis Salgado|url=http://www.curtissalgado.com/biography.html|access-date=December 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017164459/http://www.curtissalgado.com/biography.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archive-date=October 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOver 500 extras were used for the next-to-last scene, the blockade of the building at [[Daley Center]], including 200 National Guardsmen, 100 state and city police officers, with 15 horses for the [[mounted police]] (and three each [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]], [[helicopter]]s, and [[Fire apparatus|fire engines]]).<ref name=\"HappyRam\"/><ref name=\"Chicago Sun-Times3\">{{cite news|title=Blues Brothers 25th Anniversary|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| url=http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/bluebros/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050721084943/http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/bluebros/| archive-date=July 21, 2005|access-date=December 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in July 1979, with the film's budget still not settled. For the first month, things ran smoothly on and off the set. When Weiss saw the supposedly final $17.5 million budget, he reportedly joked, \"I think we've spent that much already.\"<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nIn the next month, the production began falling behind schedule. Much of the delay was due to Belushi's partying and carousing. When not on the set, he went out to his familiar Chicago haunts such as [[Wrigley Field]] and the [[Old Town Ale House, Chicago|Old Town Ale House]]. People often recognized him and slipped him cocaine, a drug he was already using heavily on his own, hoping to use it with him. \"Every blue-collar Joe wants his John Belushi story,\" said Smokey Wendell, who was eventually hired to keep it away from the star. As a result of his late nights and drug and alcohol use, Belushi would often miss unit calls (the beginning of a production day) or go to his trailer after them and sleep, wasting hours of production time. One night, Aykroyd found him crashing on the sofa of a nearby house, where Belushi had already helped himself to food in the refrigerator.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nCocaine was already so prevalent on the set (like many other film productions of that era) that Aykroyd, who used far less than his partner, claims a section of the budget was actually set aside for purchases of the drug during night shooting. The stars had a private bar, the Blues Club, built on the set, for themselves, crew, and friends. Carrie Fisher, who was Aykroyd's girlfriend at that time, said that most of the bar's staff doubled as dealers, procuring any drug patrons desired.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nThe movie's original budget was quickly surpassed, and back in Los Angeles, Wasserman grew increasingly frustrated. He was regularly confronting [[Ned Tanen]], the executive in charge of production for Universal, over the costs. [[Sean Daniel]], another studio executive, was not reassured when he came to Chicago and saw the production had set up a special facility for the 70 cars used in the chase sequences. Filming there, which was supposed to have concluded in the middle of September, continued into late October.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nOn the set, Belushi's drug use worsened. Fisher, who herself later struggled with cocaine addiction, said Landis told her to keep Belushi away from the drug. Wendell was hired to clear any drugs from the places Belushi visited off-camera. Nevertheless, at one point, Landis found Belushi with what he described as a \"mountain\" of cocaine on a table in his trailer, which led to a tearful confrontation in which Belushi admitted his addiction and feared it could eventually kill him.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair 2013\" />\n\nAfter Aykroyd and Belushi's wife Judy had a talk with Belushi about his antics, the production returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly until it came time to shoot the final sequence at the [[Hollywood Palladium]]. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels.

It took in $4,858,152, ranking second for that week (after ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''). The film in total grossed $57,229,890 domestically and $58,000,000 in foreign box office for a total of $115,229,890.

The panel discussion was broadcast direct to many other cinemas around the country.\n\nThe popularity of ''The Blues Brothers'' has also spread to non-English-language markets such as Japan; it was an inspiration for Japanese companies [[Studio Hibari]] and [[Aniplex]], which led to the creation of the manga and anime franchise [[Nerima Daikon Brothers]], which contain heavy references to the film.\n\n===American Film Institute===\n* [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] \u2013 nominated<ref>[http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/laughs500.pdf AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs Nominees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220152415/http://afi.com/Docs/100Years/laughs500.pdf |date=December 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n* [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]]:\n** \"Think\" \u2013 nominated<ref>[http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/songs400.pdf AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs Nominees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221030634/http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/songs400.pdf |date=February 21, 2015 }}</ref>\n* [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]:\n** \"We're on a mission from God.\" \u2013 nominated<ref>[http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes400.pdf AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes Nominees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628043426/http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes400.pdf |date=June 28, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\nWhen ''The Blues Brothers'' was first screened for a preview audience, a producer demanded that director Landis cut 25 minutes from the film.<ref name=\"Home Theater\">{{cite web|last=Chiarella|first=Chris|title=John Landis, Uncensored|work=Home Theater|url=http://www.hometheatermag.com/news/101305landis/|date=October 14, 2005|access-date=December 16, 2008|archive-date=December 29, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229045752/http://www.hometheatermag.com/news/101305landis/|url-status=live}}</ref> After trimming 15 minutes, it was released in theaters at 132 minutes. The film was first released on VHS and Betamax by MCA Videocassette Inc. in 1983; a Laserdisc from MCA Videodisc was released in the same year. It was then re-released on VHS, Laserdisc, and Betamax in 1985 from MCA Home Video, and again in 1990 from MCA/Universal Home Video. It was also released in a two-pack VHS box set with ''[[Animal House]]''. The original length of ''The Blues Brothers'' was restored to 148 minutes for the \"Collector's Edition\" DVD and a Special Edition VHS and Laserdisc release in 1998. The DVD and Laserdisc versions included a 56-minute documentary, ''The Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers''. Produced and directed by JM Kenny (who also produced the \"Collector's Edition\" DVD of ''[[Animal House]]'' that same year), it included interviews with Landis, Aykroyd, members of The Blues Brothers Band, producer Robert K. Weiss, editor George Folsey Jr., and others involved with the film. It also included production photographs, the theatrical trailer, production notes, and cast and filmmaker bios. The 25th Anniversary DVD release in 2005 included both the theatrical cut and the extended version.\n\n''The Blues Brothers'' was released on Blu-ray on July 26, 2011, with the same basic contents as the 25th Anniversary DVD. In a March 2011 interview with ''Ain't it Cool News'', Landis also mentioned he had approved the Blu-ray's remastered transfer. On May 19, 2020, the movie was given a 4K UHD release; it has a new 4K remaster from the original negative, and the extended footage was remastered from the same archived print as well.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Blues Brothers 4K Blu-ray Release Date May 19, 2020|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Blues-Brothers-4K-Blu-ray/265098/|access-date=2020-10-05|archive-date=September 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200908023631/https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Blues-Brothers-4K-Blu-ray/265098/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Blues Brothers: Original Soundtrack Recording\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[The Blues Brothers]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = June 20, 1980\n| recorded   = 1980\n| venue      =\n| studio     = {{hlist|[[Universal Recording Corporation|Universal]] (Chicago)|[[Record Plant]] (Los Angeles)}}\n| genre      = [[Blues]], [[blues rock]], [[blue-eyed soul]]\n| length     = 40:27\n| label      = [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]\n| producer   = [[Bob Tischler]]\n| prev_title = [[Briefcase Full of Blues]]\n| prev_year  = 1978\n| next_title = [[Made in America (Blues Brothers album)|Made in America]]\n| next_year  = 1980\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"AllmusicReview\">{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Bret|title=The Blues Brothers &#91;Original Soundtrack&#93;|website=[[Allmusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r187590|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=July 23, 2009}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''The Blues Brothers: Original Soundtrack Recording''''' (later re-released as '''''The Blues Brothers: Music from the Soundtrack''''') is the second album by the Blues Brothers Band.

Franklin required several takes, and Brown simply rerecorded his performance live on a Universal Studios sound stage during filming of the holly roller church scene, with overdubs later recorded at a studio in New York City.<ref name=BuskinR/> Cab Calloway initially wanted to do a disco variation on his signature tune, \"Minnie the Moocher\", having done the song in several styles in the past, but Landis insisted that the song be done faithfully to the original big-band version.\n\n\"[[Gimme Some Lovin'#Blues Brothers cover|Gimme Some Lovin{{'-}}]]\" was a Top 20 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hit for the Blues Brothers, peaking at number 18.<ref name=\"Top40Hits\">{{cite book |title=The Billboard book of top 40 hits |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |year=2004 |publisher=Billboard Books |isbn=0-8230-7499-4 |page=70 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjQeP-BHy78C&q=billboard%20blues%20brothers%20%22gimme%20some%20lovin%22&pg=PA70 |access-date=November 1, 2010}}</ref>  The album sold more than a million copies.<ref>{{cite news |last=Newbart |first=Dave |year=2020 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |title=How 'The Blues Brothers' helped fuel a blues boom in Chicago and beyond |url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2020/6/22/21296493/blues-brothers-movie-40th-anniversary-chicago-blues-scene |accessdate=16 September 2022}}</ref>\n\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = Artist\n\n| title1          = [[She Caught the Katy]]\n| writer1         = [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Yank Rachell]]\n| extra1          = The Blues Brothers with lead vocals by Jake Blues\n| length1         = 4:10\n\n| title2          = [[Peter Gunn (song)|Peter Gunn Theme]]\n| writer2         = [[Henry Mancini]]\n| extra2          = The Blues Brothers Band\n| length2         = 3:46\n\n| title3          = [[Gimme Some Lovin'#Blues Brothers cover|Gimme Some Lovin{{'-}}]]\n| writer3         = [[Steve Winwood]], [[Muff Winwood]], [[Spencer Davis]]\n| extra3          = The Blues Brothers with lead vocals by Jake Blues\n| length3         = 3:06\n\n| title4          = [[Shake a Tail Feather]]\n| writer4         = Otha Hayes, [[Andre Williams (musician)|Andre Williams]], Verlie Rice\n| extra4          = Ray Charles with the Blues Brothers (Jake and Elwood, backing vocals)\n| length4         = 2:48\n\n| title5          = [[Everybody Needs Somebody to Love]]\n| writer5         = [[Jerry Wexler]], [[Bert Berns]], [[Solomon Burke]]\n| extra5          = The Blues Brothers (Jake Blues, lead vocals; Elwood Blues, harmonica and vocals)\n| length5         = 3:21\n\n| title6          = [[The Old Landmark]]\n| writer6         = Adeline M.
