Young (director)|Robert M. Young]] and written by [[William Mastrosimone]], based on his 1982 off-Broadway [[Extremities (play)|play of the same name]]. The film stars [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Alfre Woodard]], [[Diana Scarwid]], and [[James Russo]].\n\nBoth Fawcett and Russo had appeared in the stage play (Fawcett taking over a role originated by [[Susan Sarandon]]), and Fawcett received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Actress for her performance in the film.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile getting into her car one night, Marjorie is attacked at knifepoint by a masked assailant who forces her to drive to a remote location, where he tries to sexually assault her. She manages to flee but leaves her purse behind. While at the police station, she is told that without a positive identification of her attacker, it will be her word against his, and he will likely not face any criminal charges. In the ensuing days, Marjorie lives in continued fear. Meanwhile, her attacker, revealed to be Joe, uses the information from her purse to gain insight into where she lives and the lives of her roommates, Pat and Terry. One morning, while Pat and Terry are away at work, Joe casually enters her home, claiming he is looking for someone who owes him money. Marjorie quickly realizes he is the man who attacked her  and tries to escape, but Joe overpowers her. Throughout the day, Joe repeatedly physically and psychologically abuses her. As he attempts to rape her, Marjorie manages to subdue him by spraying wasp repellent into his eyes. As she tries once again to flee, Joe taunts her by saying that since he did not actually rape her, the police will let him go and vows to come back and kill her. Marjorie binds him, confines him in the fireplace, and plans to murder him. When Pat and Terry return home, they try to convince Marjorie to think of the consequences of her decision and to go to the police. Joe tries to manipulate them into turning against Marjorie and believing that he is the victim. As Marjorie tries to force Joe to confess to what he has done to her, he claims that he and Marjorie were lovers and that she attacked him when he came to end their relationship. Marjorie removes the knife he previously used on her from his jacket, as well as mail he stole from their mailbox. She threatens to castrate him if he does not admit the truth. Defeated, Joe confesses that he intended to kill Marjorie, as well as Pat and Terry. He also confesses to raping and murdering three prior women. Marjorie, finally at peace, tells Pat and Terry to alert the police.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Farrah Fawcett]] as Marjorie\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] as Pat\n* [[Diana Scarwid]] as Terry\n* [[James Russo]] as Joe / \"The Assailant\"\n* [[Sandy Martin]] as Officer Sudow\n* [[Eddie Velez]] as Officer #1\n* [[Tom Everett]] as Officer #2\n* Donna Lynn Leavy as Woman on Phone (voice)\n* [[Enid Kent]] as Mother at Police Station\n* Michael Hennessy as Pizza Man\n* Danika Hendrickson as Joe's Daughter\n* [[Clare Wren]] as Racquetball Player\n* [[James Avery (actor)|James Avery]] as Security Guard\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Extremities'' received mixed reviews from critics.
