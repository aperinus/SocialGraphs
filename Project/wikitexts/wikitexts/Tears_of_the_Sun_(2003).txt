Waters ([[Bruce Willis]]) commands the team sent to rescue [[Citizenship of the United States|U.S. citizen]] Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks ([[Monica Bellucci]])  before the approaching rebels reach her jungle hospital. The film was directed by [[Antoine Fuqua]].\n\nWillis produced ''Tears of the Sun'' through [[Cheyenne Enterprises]], his production company. The cast of ''Tears of the Sun'' includes actual African refugees living in the United States, incl. [[Lost Boys of Sudan|Sudanese Lost Boys]].<ref name=\"T&F\" />\n\n==Plot==\nTurmoil erupts in [[Nigeria]] following a military ''[[coup d'etat]]'' led by exiled General Mustafa Yakubu in which [[President of Nigeria|President]] Samuel Azuka and his entire family are reportedly [[assassination|assassinated]]. The ethnic enmity is between the [[Fula people|Fulani]] [[Muslims|Moslems]] in the north and [[Christianity in Nigeria|Christian]] [[Igbo people|Ibo]] in the south. Foreigners evacuate the country and [[Lieutenant]] A.K. Waters and his [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEAL]] team consisting of Zee, Slo, Red, Lake, Silk, Doc, and Flea, board the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Harry S. Truman|CVN-75|3=2}}, to be dispatched by [[Captain (United States O-6)#U.S. Navy|Captain]] Bill Rhodes to extract Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks, a U.S. citizen by marriage to the late Dr. John Kendricks who was killed by rebels in [[Sierra Leone]]. Their secondary mission is to extract the mission's priest and two nuns, should they choose to come.\n\nWaters gets to Kendricks, telling her that rebels are closing in on her hospital and the mission, and that his orders are to extract U.S. citizens; however, Kendricks refuses to leave without her patients that she loves so much. Waters calls Rhodes for options; after a brief conversation, he concedes to Kendricks' wishes and agrees to take those refugees able to walk. Kendricks begins assembling the able-bodied for the {{convert|12|km}} hike; the priest and the nuns stay behind to take care of the injured.\n\nIrritated and behind schedule, the team and the refugees leave the hospital mission after daybreak. At nightfall they take a short break. The rebels rapidly approach their position, and Waters stealthily kills one. Kendricks warns Waters that the rebels are going to the mission, but he is determined to carry out his orders, and they continue to the extraction point.\n\nBack at the mission, the staff and refugees are detained by the rebels. Despite the priest's pleas for mercy, the rebels murder him and the remaining occupants.\n\nWhen the team arrives at the extraction point, Waters' initial plan becomes clear: the SEALs suddenly turn away the refugees from the waiting [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk#SH-60B Seahawk|SH-60B Seahawk helicopter]]. Waters forces Kendricks into the helicopter against her will, leaving the refugees stranded in the jungle, defenseless against the rebels. En route back to ''Harry Truman'', they fly over the original mission compound, seeing it destroyed and all its occupants murdered, as Kendricks had feared.\n\nRemorseful, Waters orders the pilot to return to the refugees. He then loads as many refugees as he can into the helicopter and decides to escort the remaining refugees to the [[Cameroon]]ian border on foot.\n\nDuring the hike to Cameroon, the SEALs discover the rebels are somehow tracking them. As they escape and evade the rebels, the team enters a village whose inhabitants are being raped, tortured, and massacred by the rebels. Cognizant of his ability to stop it, Waters orders the team to kill the rebels. The team is visibly shaken by the atrocities they see the rebels have committed against the villagers.\n\nAgain en route, Slo determines that a refugee is transmitting a signal allowing the rebels to locate them. A newer refugee picked up during the trek attempts to run but is shot. A transmitter is discovered on his body. As he bleeds out, he confesses that he is coerced to be the [[Informant#Terminology and slang|rat]] because his family had been captured by the rebels. The following search for his co-conspirators reveals the presence of Arthur Azuka, the surviving son of late President Samuel Azuka, which they realize is the reason the rebels are hunting them: Samuel Azuka was not only the president of the country, but also the tribal king of the [[Igbo people|Ibo]]. As the only surviving member of this royal bloodline, Arthur is the only person left with a legitimate claim to the Ibo Nation. Waters is angered that Kendricks knew this but did not inform him.\n\nThe SEALs decide to continue escorting the refugees to Cameroon, regardless of the cost. A firefight ensues when the rebels finally catch up with them, and the SEALs decide to stay behind as rearguard to buy the refugees enough time to reach the border safely.\n\nZee radios the Navy for air support; two [[Boeing F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18]]s take off and head towards them. The rebels kill Slo, Lake, Flea, and Silk. Waters, Red, Doc, and Zee are wounded, but direct the jets on where to attack. Arthur and Kendricks rush towards the now-closed Cameroonian border crossing when they hear the jets approach and bomb the pursuing rebels.\n\nWaters, Zee, Doc, and Red rise from the grass as Navy helicopters land in Cameroon, opposite the Nigerian border crossing. Rhodes arrives and orders the gate open, letting in the SEALs and the refugees. They are then escorted onto the helicopters.\n\nRhodes promises Waters that he will recover the bodies of Waters' men. Kendricks bids tearful farewells to her Nigerian friends and flies away in a helicopter while comforting Waters, watching as Arthur is surrounded by his people proclaiming their freedom.\n\nThe movie ends with, \"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing\" quote attributed to [[Edmund Burke#\"When good men do nothing\"|Edmund Burke]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Lieutenant A.K.
