Even then, however, the wacky, unruly plot has a consistent through line: Tukel invests most of his narrative making terrible people objects of ridicule, with a final punchline suggesting that, in the game of life, everyone's stuck on one side or the other of the same bad joke.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kohn |first=Eric |title=Tribeca Review: New York Comedy is Rarely More Scathing Than Onur Tukel's 'Applesauce' |work=[[Indiewire]] |date=April 23, 2015 |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/tribeca-review-new-york-comedy-is-rarely-more-scathing-than-onur-tukels-applesauce-20150423 |accessdate=September 19, 2015}}</ref>}}\nConversely, Justin Lowe of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticized the script for possessing \"an unfavorable view of human nature that it\u2019s difficult to identify any likeable characters, most of whom are constantly scheming to manipulate and discredit one another.\"  He added:{{blockquote|As the principal instigator, Tukel bestows Ron with an outsize share of unpleasant qualities that are elaborated with a tiresomely repetitive performance that draws the supporting cast into a diminishing spiral of criticism and retribution. Their sometimes vague motivations and a series of implausible plot developments are further off-putting factors periodically derailing the narrative, which consistently struggles to connect, despite the film\u2019s passable indie-production aesthetic.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lowe |first=Justin |title='Applesauce': Tribeca Review |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 21, 2015 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/applesauce-tribeca-review-790292 |accessdate=September 19, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=4270878|title=Applesauce}}\n\n[[Category:2015 films]]\n[[Category:2015 black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Onur Tukel]]\n[[Category:2015 comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
