The migrating dolphins are herded into a cove where they are netted off. The young and pretty are sold to [[oceanarium]]s and [[dolphinarium]]s around the world, and the rest are brutally slaughtered. The film argues that dolphin hunting as practiced in Japan is unnecessary and cruel.\n\nSince the film's release, ''The Cove'' has drawn controversy over its supposed lack of neutrality, secret filming techniques,  and portrayal of the Japanese people. It won the U.S. Audience Award at the [[2009 Sundance Film Festival|25th annual Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2009. It was selected out of 879 submissions in the category.<ref name=\"jt20090127\"/><ref>[http://festival.sundance.org/2009/film_events/films/cove The Cove] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814074534/http://festival.sundance.org/2009/film_events/films/cove |date=August 14, 2009 }} Sundance Festival 2009</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film follows former-dolphin-trainer-turned-activist [[Ric O'Barry]]'s quest to document the dolphin hunting operations in [[Taiji, Wakayama]], Japan. In the 1960s, O'Barry helped capture and train the five wild dolphins who shared the role of \"[[Flipper (1964 TV series)#Animal cast|Flipper]]\" in the [[Flipper (1964 TV series)|hit television series of the same name]]. The show fueled widespread public adoration of dolphins and influenced the development of [[marine park]]s that included dolphins among their attractions. According to O'Barry, one of the dolphins committed a form of [[suicide]] in his arms by closing her blowhole voluntarily in order to suffocate, after which he came to see the dolphin's captivity and the dolphin capture industry as cruel and inhumane. Days later, he was arrested off the island of [[Bimini]] for attempting to cut a hole in a sea pen in order to set free a captured dolphin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savejapandolphins.org/educate.php |title=SaveJapanDolphins.org |publisher=SaveJapanDolphins.org |access-date=April 23, 2010}}</ref> Since then, according to the film, O'Barry has dedicated himself full-time as an advocate on behalf of dolphins around the world.\n\nAfter meeting with O'Barry, Psihoyos and his crew travel to Taiji, Japan, a town that appears to be devoted to dolphins and whales. A group of local fishermen engage in [[dolphin drive hunting]] and generate tremendous revenues for the town by selling trapped dolphins to [[aquarium]]s and [[Marine mammal park|marine parks]] around the world, with a premium paid for female [[bottlenose dolphin]]s. In an isolated cove surrounded by wire fences and \"Keep Out\" signs, however, an activity takes place that the townspeople attempt to hide from the public. The dolphins that are not sold are driven into the cove and killed, with only modest income derived from the sale of the meat to supermarkets throughout Japan. According to the evidence presented in the film, the local government officials are involved in helping to hide the slaughter, and the Japanese public is largely unaware of the hunt and the marketing of dolphin meat, which the film states contains [[Mercury poisoning|dangerously high levels of mercury]]. Two Taiji city councilors are interviewed who have advocated for the removal of dolphin meat from local school lunches due concerns about mercury.\n\nAll activists who attempt to view or film the dolphin killing in the cove are physically prevented from doing so by the fishermen, with the support of the local police and government, and the filmmakers are shadowed and questioned by the authorities. Faced with this, Psihoyos, O'Barry, and the crew utilize special tactics and technology to covertly film what is taking place in the cove.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecovemovie.com/the_team/the-team.htm |title=TheCoveMovie.com |publisher=TheCoveMovie.com |access-date=April 23, 2010}}</ref> Near the end of the film, Psihoyos shows some of the grisly footage he was able to film during a dolphin slaughter to a Japanese official, who had repeatedly tried to minimize the incident during his interview. The official's friendly demeanor hardens, and he asks Psihoyos when and where the footage was filmed. \n\nThe film also reports on Japan's alleged \"buying\" of the votes of poor nations in the [[International Whaling Commission]], stating that, while Dominica has withdrawn from the IWC, Japan has recruited the following nations to its whaling agenda: Cambodia, Ecuador, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Kiribati, Laos, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|This is not entirely accurate, however, as Ecuador has been a strong opponent of whaling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmrree.gob.ec/2011/bol147.asp|title=Ecuador ECUADOR PROPONE PONER FIN A LA \"CAZA CIENT\u00cdFICA\" QUE JAP\u00d3N REALIZAR\u00c1 EN SANTUARIO AUSTRAL |publisher=Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores del Ecuador|date=February 17, 2011 |access-date=September 21, 2010}}</ref>}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/editorial-100811-1.html |title=Ecuador has not joined the pro-whaling block in the IWC |publisher=Sea Shepherd |date=August 11, 2010 |access-date=September 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018145702/http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/editorial-100811-1.html |archive-date=October 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> After Psihoyos shows the footage to the Japanese official, the film cuts to O'Barry interrupting the annual meeting of the IWC.
