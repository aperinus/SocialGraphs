The film stars [[Neil Dickson]], [[Alex Hyde-White]], and [[Peter Cushing]] in his final feature film role.\n\n==Plot==\nCatering salesman Jim Ferguson ([[Alex Hyde-White]]), living in present-day [[New York City]], is involuntarily transported to 1917, where he saves the life of dashing [[Royal Flying Corps]] pilot James \"[[Biggles]]\" Bigglesworth ([[Neil Dickson]]) after he is shot down on a photo recon mission. Before he can work out what has happened, Jim is zapped back to the 1980s.\n\nHe is visited by Biggles' former commanding officer, William Raymond ([[Peter Cushing]]), who is now an Air Commodore living in the [[Tower Bridge]] in [[London]]. Raymond tells him about his theory that Ferguson and Biggles are \"time twins\", spontaneously transported through time when the other is in mortal danger. Together, Ferguson and Biggles fight across time and against the odds to stop the Germans by destroying a revolutionary \"sound weapon\" with a [[Metropolitan Police]] helicopter that was stolen by Biggles while they were escaping a SWAT team in 1986 London.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Neil Dickson]] as [[Lieutenant]] James '[[Biggles]]' Bigglesworth\n* [[Alex Hyde-White]] as Jim Ferguson\n* [[Fiona Hutchison]] as Debbie\n* [[Peter Cushing]] as Air Commodore William Raymond\n* [[Marcus Gilbert (actor)|Marcus Gilbert]] as [[Hauptmann]] Erich von Stalhein\n* [[William Hootkins]] as Chuck\n* Alan Polonsky as Bill\n* [[Francesca Gonshaw]] as Marie\n* [[Michael Siberry]] as [[Second Lieutenant]] The Honourable Algernon 'Algy' Montgomery Lacey\n* [[James Saxon (actor)|James Saxon]] as [[Second Lieutenant]] Lord Bertie Lissie \n* [[Daniel Flynn (actor)|Daniel Flynn]] as Ginger Hebblethwaite\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAs early as 1968, and inspired by the success of films such as ''[[The Blue Max]]'', it was planned to make a film based on W.E.

Some sources claim that during scriptwriting, however, ''[[Back to the Future]]'' was released and became a major hit, so the script was duly altered by Walwin and John Groves to follow this trend, in an attempt to capitalize on ''Back to the Future'''s popularity.  However, ''Biggles'' had already completed filming by the date of ''Back to the Future's'' UK release date of December 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Biggles-Adventures-in-Time-Blu-ray/156800/|title=Biggles: Adventures in Time Blu-ray Release Date November 29, 2016|via=www.blu-ray.com}}</ref>\n\nThe film takes much liberty with the storyline of the original novels. In addition to the introduction of a science-fiction plot, Biggles is much older than in the books (where he is only a teenager in 1917), and the characters, Ginger and Bertie, feature, although they don't join Biggles until much later in the book series. However, the presence of Biggles' friend, Algy, adversary Erich von Stalhein and love interest Marie fits with the earlier books in the series, as does the presence of Commodore Raymond, who employed Biggles for covert operations in the later stories.<ref>[http://www.biggles.nl/en/movie.html Biggles Fansite: A history of Biggles on film] Re-linked 2015-06-12</ref>\n\n==Filming==\nThe [[Eady Levy]] was due to expire at the end of March 1985, and the movie was partially funded by this.
