Determined to get ahead, and ignoring the warnings of his colleague and roommate Charlie Soames, he pursues Susan Brown, the daughter of a local industrial magnate. She has been dating wealthy Jack Wales, but Joe is able to charm her. Mr and Mrs Brown attempt to deal with Joe's social climbing by having Joe's boss encourage him to pursue a woman of his own class; getting him a job offer back in Dufton, which he refuses when he discovers the machination; and sending Susan on a trip abroad, but Susan remains smitten.\n\nWhile he is wooing Susan, Joe also begins to see Alice Aisgill, an unhappily married Frenchwoman ten years his senior who came to England as a teacher a decade earlier and married George Aisgill, a haughty and abusive upper-class Englishman who is now having an affair with his secretary. Joe thinks he is just killing time with Alice and Alice says they can just be \"loving friends\". Their feelings for each other begin to turn into something more and Joe starts to lose interest in his pursuit of Susan. The relationship is passionate, tempestuous and after a particularly heated argument, Joe switches his focus back to Susan. He manages to take her virginity but is unsatisfied and finds himself drawn back to Alice.\n\nJoe and Alice go away for a vacation and Alice is overjoyed that Joe seems to have decided to end his quest for wealth and social status in favour of simply being happy with himself and with her. They decide she will ask for a divorce when she gets home but when she does, George refuses and declares he will ruin Joe and Alice, both socially and financially, if their relationship continues. While Joe is brooding over this, Mr Brown delivers the news that Susan is pregnant and that he expects Joe to stop seeing Alice and marry Susan, in which case Joe can come work for him for a large salary.\n\nSeeing no way around his obstacles to a relationship with Alice, Joe tells her that he is going marry Susan. The heartbroken Alice gets drunk in a pub and the next morning, while his co-workers are celebrating his engagement, Joe hears that she drove her car off a cliff to which she and he used to go together and died slowly over the course of several hours. Devastated, Joe leaves the office and wanders to the flat where he and Alice had their trysts but Alice's friend Elspeth, who owns the flat, drives him away by screaming at him and blaming him for Alice's death.\n\nJoe goes to a pub on the waterfront, where a woman named Mavis comes on to him because he is well-dressed. Although he is very drunk and does not seem very interested in her (he calls her Alice), Joe keeps a man from taking Mavis away against her will. When Joe is alone, the man and some of his friends beat Joe unconscious. In the morning, Charlie finds Joe lying in the street with a battered face but Joe's only concern is his guilt over what he feels he led Alice to do.\n\nA short time later, Joe and Susan get married. With a rich wife and high-paying job, he has got everything he thought he wanted. As they are driven away after the wedding, Susan's effusive praise of the ceremony halts when she notices there are tears in Joe's eyes, which she interprets as him being \"really sentimental, after all\".\n\n==Main cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Simone Signoret]] as Alice Aisgill\n* [[Laurence Harvey]] as Joe Lampton\n* [[Heather Sears]] as Susan Brown\n* [[Donald Wolfit]] as Mr Brown\n* [[Donald Houston]] as Charlie Soames\n* [[Hermione Baddeley]] as Elspeth\n* [[Allan Cuthbertson]] as George Aisgill\n* [[Raymond Huntley]] as Mr Hoylake\n* [[John Westbrook (actor)|John Westbrook]] as Jack Wales\n* [[Ambrosine Phillpotts]] as Mrs Brown\n* [[Richard Pasco]] as Teddy Merrick\n* [[Beatrice Varley]] as Joe's Aunt\n* [[Delena Kidd]] as Eva\n* [[Ian Hendry]] as Cyril\n* [[April Olrich]] as Mavis\n* [[Mary Peach]] as June Samson\n* [[Anthony Newlands]] as Bernard\n* [[Avril Elgar]] as Miss Gilchrist\n* Thelma Ruby as Miss Breith\n* [[Paul Whitsun-Jones]] as Laughing Man at Bar (who tells Joe a joke at the dance)\n* [[Derren Nesbitt]] as Thug in Fight on Tow Path (Mavis' possessive boyfriend)\n* [[Derek Benfield]] as Man in Bar (uncredited)\n* [[Richard Caldicot]] as Taxi Driver (uncredited)\n* [[Wendy Craig]] as Joan (uncredited)\n* [[Basil Dignam]] as Priest (uncredited)\n* [[Everley Gregg]] as Mayoress (uncredited)\n* [[Jack Hedley]] as Architect (uncredited)\n* [[Miriam Karlin]] as Gertrude (uncredited)\n* [[Wilfrid Lawson (actor)|Wilfrid Lawson]] as Joe's Uncle Nat (uncredited)\n* [[Prunella Scales]] as Council Office Worker (uncredited)\n* [[Julian Somers]] at St Clair (uncredited)\n* [[John Welsh (actor)|John Welsh]] as Mayor (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Adaptation==\nThere are some differences between Braine's novel and the film. For one, Joe's friend Charlie Soames is a friend from his hometown of Dufton in the novel, whereas, in the film, he meets Charlie in Warnley (which is called Warley in the book). Also, in the book, more is made of Joe's lodging at the Thompsons', which, in the novel, he arranged before his arrival in Warley (in the film, Charlie arranges it soon after they meet): it is through his association with the Thompsons that Joe is able to gain entry to a higher social circle than that to which he had previously had access, and Mrs Thompson's room is noted as being at \"the top\" of Warley geographically, which serves as a metaphor for Joe's social-climbing.\n\n==Production==\nProducer James Woolf bought the film rights to [[John Braine|Braine]]'s novel, originally intending to cast [[Stewart Granger]] as Joe and [[Jean Simmons]] as Susan. [[Vivien Leigh]] was originally offered the part of Alice.<ref>David Thomson ''Have You Seen'', London: Allen Lane; New York: Knopf, 2008, p.736</ref> Woolf hired [[Jack Clayton|Clayton]] as director after seeing ''[[The Bespoke Overcoat]]'',<ref>Alexander Walker, ''Hollywood, England'', Stein and Day, 1974 p51</ref> an [[29th Academy Awards|Academy-Award-winning]] short film that was produced and distributed by companies founded by the [[John and James Woolf|Woolf brothers]].\n===Shooting===\nFor the production, in addition to filming on sets at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[Surrey]], there was extensive [[filming location|location]]-shooting in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Yorkshire]], which stood in for the fictional towns of Warnley and Dufton. Greystones, a large mansion in the Savile Park area of Halifax, was used as the location for exterior scenes of the Brown family mansion; [[Halifax railway station (England)|Halifax railway station]] doubled as Warnley Station in the film; and [[Halifax Town Hall]] was used as the Warnley Town Hall. The wedding was filmed at All Souls church, Boothtown, Halifax. Some scenes were also filmed in [[Bradford]], notably the one in which Joe travels on a bus and spots Susan in a lingerie shop and those outside the amateur dramatics theatre.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was critically acclaimed<ref>{{cite magazine|title=British 'Room' Rousing $19,500 Sets London Pix Pace|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=February 4, 1959|page=13|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety213-1959-02#page/n12/mode/1up|access-date=July 4, 2019|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> and marked the beginning of Jack Clayton's career as an important director.
