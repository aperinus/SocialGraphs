After a researcher records her own death from a heart attack, her colleagues join forces to retrieve the information and play it back.\n\n== Plot ==\nScientists invent a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] enabling sensations to be recorded from a person's brain and converted to tape for others to experience. The team includes estranged husband and wife Michael and Karen, as well as Michael's colleague Lillian. At CEO Alex's instruction, the team demonstrates the device to investors to gain financing.\n\nKaren dons the recorder while working with Michael and Lillian. When Michael plays the tape back, the group realizes that emotional experiences are also recorded. Michael tapes his memories of times with Karen, which he shares with her, leading to their reconciliation.\n\nLillian is pressured by backers to admit Landon to the team, whom she sees as part of the [[military-industrial complex]]. She disagrees with their plan to have the invention developed for military use.\n\nOne team member, Gordy, has sexual intercourse while wearing the recorder, and shares the tape with colleagues, including Hal. Hal splices one section of the tape into a continuous orgasm, which results in sensory overload, leading to his forced retirement. Tensions increase as the possibilities for abuse become clear.\n\nSuffering from heart problems and a constant cigarette smoker, Lillian suffers a heart attack while working alone. Realizing she is about to die, Lillian records her experience.\n\nMichael later decides to experience Lillian's recording, but nearly dies when his body simulates a heart attack. Michael modifies his console to filter the physical output and replays the tape. He sees \"memory bubbles\"\u2014moments from Lillian's life. Michael experiences Lillian's memories of a humorous exchange with Michael as he plays with an [[industrial robot]], a surprise birthday party, and being devastated when Alex tells her that an earlier project is canceled.\n\nScientists wanting to discover the machine's military capabilities are monitoring the equipment as Michael plays Lillian's tape. They have Gordy experience the tape, but Landon ignores the advice of the monitoring staff that Michael made modifications to his terminal. Gordy dies from experiencing Lillian's heart attack.\n\nMichael's playback is cut short by Hal, but having witnessed the [[near-death experience]] makes Michael curious to see the entire tape. Alex has the recording locked away and tells Michael he will not be allowed to view it. When he returns to work, Michael walks in on Landon and outside technicians going through his research records. Alex responds to his protests by firing Michael and Karen.\n\nMichael attempts to hack into the lab's computers. Hal advises him to look under \"Project Brainstorm\", a program the military created to use their invention for torture and brainwashing. Michael accesses a tape from his den and quickly stops viewing it because of its disturbing nature.  Michael and Karen's son Chris inadvertently views the tape, causing him to have a psychotic experience that results in his hospitalization. Alex visits and Michael confronts him about Project Brainstorm, blaming Alex for his son's condition. Alex denies any knowledge of the project, then informs Michael of Gordy's death.\n\nMichael vows to destroy his work and enlists the help of Karen and Hal. Michael and Karen head to the [[Pinehurst Resort]], and realizing they are under surveillance, stage a fight that results in Karen leaving for Hal's house. As the two feign reconciliation over the phone, Michael accesses the Brainstorm computer via another phone line while Karen hacks into the system, sabotaging the robots that manufacture the interface terminals.\n\nKaren shuts down the security system, locking the staff outside and enabling Michael to load Lillian's tape and experience it uninterrupted. With the plant in chaos, Robert orders Michael's arrest.\n\nKaren leaves the house to meet with Michael. Hal and his wife, Wendy, send the last of Karen's commands to the company computers, shutting down the plant.\n\nKaren meets with Michael while the tape is playing. Michael bears witness to the [[afterlife]], experiencing a vision of hell, then traveling from Earth and through the universe, even after the tape ends. He ultimately has visions of angels and departed souls flying into a great cosmic Light. Michael then collapses. Karen sobs, believing him dead. She pleads for Michael to stay alive. Awakening from the experience, he weeps with joy and embraces Karen.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Dr. Michael Brace\n* [[Natalie Wood]] as Karen Brace\n* [[Louise Fletcher]] as Dr. Lillian Reynolds \n* [[Cliff Robertson]] as Alex Terson\n* [[Jordan Christopher]] as Gordy Forbes\n* Donald Hotton as Dr. Landan Marks\n* [[Alan Fudge]] as Robert Jenkins, project manager for project Brainstorm\n* Joe Dorsey as Hal Abramson \n* [[Bill Morey]] as James Zimbach\n* [[Jason Lively]] as Chris Brace\n* [[Georgianne Walken]] as Wendy Abramson\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nTo prepare for the film, Trumbull took most of the key cast and crew to the [[Esalen Institute]], an experimental research facility in Northern California known for its new-age classes and workshops. In September 1981, the cast and crew traveled to North Carolina to begin six weeks of shooting at locations<ref name=\"PopMech 2018\"/> including the [[Elion-Hitchings Building]] in Research Triangle Park<ref name=\"Elion-Hitchings\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article245830330.html |title=United Therapeutics to demolish an RTP landmark building |last=Stradling |first=Richard |work=[[News & Observer]] |date=21 September 2020 }}</ref> and Duke University,<ref name=\"PopMech 2018\">{{cite web |last1=D'Agostino |first1=Ryan |last2=Hildebr |first2=Eleanor |title=The True Story of 'Brainstorm,' a Lost Sci-Fi Classic\u2014And Natalie Wood's Final Film |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/movies/a25654064/sci-fi-movie-brainstorm-natalie-wood-final-film/ |website=Popular Mechanics |access-date=23 December 2018 |date=21 December 2018}}</ref> then returned to the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios]] in Culver City, California in November to film interior scenes.<ref name=\"TCM\">{{cite web |url= https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69568/brainstorm#articles-reviews|title= Brainstorm (TCM article)|first= Andrea |last= Passafiume|work=TCM|publisher= Turner Classic Movies|access-date=24 October 2022}}</ref>\n\n=== Natalie Wood's death ===\nThe film was nearly scuttled by [[Natalie Wood#Death|Natalie Wood's death]] during a production break in November 1981. By this time, Wood had already completed all of her major scenes,<ref>{{cite news|last=Thackrey| first= Ted Jr. |title=Actress Natalie Wood Dies| work=Los Angeles Times| date=November 30, 1981}}</ref> but due to mounting financial problems, MGM took Wood's death as an opportunity to terminate the already troubled production. \"When she died,\" said Trumbull, \"all the sets were locked and frozen on all the stages. No one could get in or out without special permission while all the negotiations took place.\"<ref name=\"TCM\" />\n\nTrumbull believed that financially strapped MGM simply got cold feet about providing the remainder of the funds to complete ''Brainstorm''. \"MGM's problem was that insurance institution [[Lloyd's of London]], when it took depositions from me and other people, realized that the film could be finished. Why should they pay an insurance claim for something that really wasn't damaged goods?\" When MGM refused to pay for the film to be completed, Lloyd's of London provided $2.75 million for Trumbull to complete principal photography and an additional $3.5 million towards post-production. Meanwhile, other studios showed interest in buying ''Brainstorm'' from MGM to release as their own production. \"MGM decided to allow Lloyd's of London to offer the film to many of the major studios in town,\" said Trumbull. \"Several of them made bids to MGM. And the studio suddenly realized that a lot of other people in this town were excited about ''Brainstorm'', and were ready to put up millions of dollars. MGM figured they'd look like jerks if they let it go and it turned out to be a big success. So they finally decided to work out this deal where Lloyd's of London would put up the remaining money and become a profit participant.\"<ref name=\"TCM\" />\n\nTrumbull proceeded to complete the film by rewriting the script and using Natalie Wood's younger sister [[Lana Wood|Lana]] for Wood's few remaining scenes.<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/news/movie-memorials-hollywood-honors-fallen-171700659.html|title= Movie Memorials: How Hollywood Honors Its Fallen|first=Steven |last=Bryan|date= May 25, 2012 |work=Yahoo Movies|publisher= Yahoo!|access-date=24 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film carries the dedication credit \"To Natalie\".<ref name=\"TCM\" />\n\n=== Effects ===\nThe film was conceived as an introduction to Trumbull's [[Showscan]] 60 frames-per-second [[70 mm film]] process. \"In movies people often do flashbacks and point-of-view shots as a gauzy, mysterious, distant kind of image,\" Trumbull recalled. \"And I wanted to do just the opposite, which was to make the material of the mind even more real and high-impact than 'reality'\".\n\nMGM withdrew its plans to release the experimental picture in the new format. Trumbull instead shot the virtual reality sequences in 24 frames-per-second [[Super Panavision 70]] with an aspect ratio of 2.2:1. The rest of the film was shot in conventional 35mm with an aspect ratio of approximately 1.7 to 1.<ref name=\"jj3553\">{{cite web\n  |url = http://johnandjana.net/archive7/?p=3553\n  |title = Interview: Douglas Trumbull\n  |access-date = 2011-01-16\n  |website = JohnandJana.net\n  |date = July 7, 2009\n  |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723163645/http://johnandjana.net/archive7/?p=3553\n  |archive-date = July 23, 2011\n  |url-status = dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\nThe score to ''Brainstorm'' was composed and conducted by [[James Horner]], it won him the [[Saturn Award for Best Music]] in 1983.

However, it opened on a small number of screens and with little publicity despite being lauded unofficially as \"Natalie Wood's last movie\".

In 1983 he stated: {{cquote|I have no interest...in doing another Hollywood feature film...Absolutely none. The movie business is so totally screwed up that I just don't have the energy to invest three or four years in a feature film. Moviemaking is like waging war. It destroys your personal life, too. The people who can survive the process of making films have largely given up their personal lives in order to do that, just because it's such a battle to make a movie. And in doing that, they've isolated themselves from the very audience that they're trying to reach.<ref name=\"TCM\" />}} In 2013, he explained that the uncertain circumstances of Natalie Wood's death were the main reason for this decision. He later returned to filmmaking.<ref>{{cite news|title=Douglas Trumbull, Natalie Wood's Last Director, Returns With Sci-Fi Project|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/douglas-trumbull-natalie-woods-last-569988}}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\nAt the 11th [[Saturn Awards]], ''Brainstorm'' won Best Actress for Louise Fletcher and Best Music for James Horner.<ref name=\"11th Saturn Awards\">[https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000004/1984 11th Saturn Awards] at [[IMDb]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Past Saturn Awards|url=http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626105752/http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html |archive-date=26 June 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It also received nominations for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director, Best Special Effects and a posthumous Best Supporting Actress nomination for Natalie Wood.<ref name=\"11th Saturn Awards\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=25th Anniversary of \"Brainstorm\"'s 1983 Release|url=https://www.in70mm.com/presents/1959_super_panavision/1983_brainstorm/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[1983 in film]]\n* [[Artificial reality]]\n* [[Augmented reality]]\n* [[Autonomous sensory meridian response]], or ASMR\n* [[Brain-computer interface]]\n* [[BrainGate]]\n* [[Flight simulation]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[Virtual reality]]\n* [[Thought recording and reproduction device]]\n* ''[[The Dream Master]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Tron]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Dreamscape (1984 film)|Dreamscape]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Existenz|eXistenZ]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[Rememory]]'' (2017)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=69568}}\n* {{AFI film|57864}}\n* [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sIE43Q66hFQ Excerpt]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brainstorm (1983 Film)}}\n[[Category:1983 films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction thriller films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction thriller films]]\n[[Category:Brain\u2013computer interfacing in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films about telepresence]]\n[[Category:Films about technological impact]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Horner]]\n[[Category:Films shot from the first-person perspective]]\n[[Category:Films shot in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Metaphysical fiction films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Techno-thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about the afterlife]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Douglas Trumbull]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
