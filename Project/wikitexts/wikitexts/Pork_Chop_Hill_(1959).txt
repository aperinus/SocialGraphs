The film, which was the final war film directed by [[Lewis Milestone]], is based upon the book by U.S. military historian [[Brigadier General]] [[S. L. A. Marshall]]. It depicts the first fierce [[Battle of Pork Chop Hill]] between the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] and [[China|Chinese]] and [[North Korea]]n forces in April 1953.\n\nThe film features numerous actors who would go on to become movie and television stars in the 1960s and the 1970s such as [[Woody Strode]], [[Harry Guardino]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], [[George Peppard]], [[Norman Fell]], [[Abel Fernandez]], [[Gavin MacLeod]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Clarence Williams III]]. It is also the screen debut of [[Martin Landau]] and [[George Shibata]], who was a West Point classmate of [[Joseph G. Clemons|Lieutenant Joe Clemons]], who also acted as [[technical adviser]] on the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn April 1953, during the [[Korean War]], K Company, [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]], under the command of Lieutenant [[Joseph G. Clemons|Joe Clemons]], is assigned to recapture Pork Chop Hill from a larger [[Chinese People's Volunteer Army]] force. Clemons leads 1st Platoon, puts his friend Lieutenant Tsugio Ohashi in charge of 2nd Platoon, while 3rd Platoon is kept as a reserve. They succeed in taking the hill, trench by trench, but at the cost of high casualties. Clemons is promised another company as reinforcements, but L Company is ambushed, and only about a dozen infantrymen reach him. They prepare for a large-scale [[Chicom]] counterattack.\n\nMeanwhile, at nearby [[Panmunjeom]], [[Korean Armistice Agreement|cease-fire negotiations]] continue, and U.S. Army High Command are unwilling to reinforce the hill because its value is not worth further losses. Yet they will not abandon the hill either, because it is a point of negotiation in the talks. Eventually, American negotiators come to the conclusion that the Chinese are pouring soldiers into the battle for a militarily insignificant hill to test the resolve of the Americans. Thus, the decision is made to reinforce the hill, saving the lives of the survivors of Clemons's unit.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Lt. [[Joseph G.

All Black units were integrated in the summer and fall of 1951 and all Black units were integrated and closed out on 1 October 1951. Like its cinematic portrayal, the real regiment was poorly trained, poorly equipped and poorly led.<ref>{{cite book\n   |last=Hackworth |pages=92\u201393 |title=About Face\n   |quote=...the 24th, was an all-Black outfit and as a fighting force it was sorrier than any unit I'd ever seen.  It had not always been that way; in fact, the Deuce-Four had been responsible for the first significant American ground victory of the war, at [[Yechon]], in July of 1950.  But the regiment had been badly bloodied since then, and with the attendant loss of many of its fine black [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s (too many of whom were replaced by white NCOs who were unable or unwilling to bond with the troops&mdash;and vice versa), it seemed the 24th had gone to hell in a hand basket.  Individually, many of its members were great... but its leadership was too thin...}}</ref> More than once when this all-black unit was placed on the front lines, a unit in reserve was positioned directly behind because they were expected to break. The regiment was finally considered so unreliable it was disbanded. Its personnel were reassigned to other combat units just as in the film, which portrays Edwards' character - with good leadership - becoming an effective soldier.\n\n===Casting choices===\nGeorge Shibata, who stars as Lt. Suki Ohashi, became the first [[Nisei]] appointed to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] through the sponsorship of Sen. [[Elbert D. Thomas]].  Shibata would become the first [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]], Class of 1951 and he was commissioned in the [[United States Air Force]] later in that same year (1951).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/people/ethnic_cultures/the_peoples_of_utah/japaneselifeinutah.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109085523/http://historytogo.utah.gov/people/ethnic_cultures/the_peoples_of_utah/japaneselifeinutah.html |archive-date=2006-01-09 |title=Japanese Life in Utah}}</ref> During the [[Korean War]] he flew an [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] out of [[Daegu International Airport|Taegu Air Force Base]]. The film Pork Chop Hill was about Shibata's classmate [[Joseph G. Clemons]], who was also a 1951 West Point graduate. This came about when Clemons accidentally bumped into his old friend Shibata at a drugstore when Clemons was in California acting as a [[technical adviser]] for the forthcoming film.  He convinced Shibata to try out for the role of the [[Japanese in Hawaii|Japanese-Hawaiian]] Executive Officer, Lt. Tsugio Ohashi when Hollywood was having a problem casting the role.<ref>pp. 77-78 Rubin, Steven Jay ''Combat Films: American Realism, 1945-2010'', 2nd edition McFarland, 1 Jan 1981</ref> During the production Clemons decided to play a joke on his Air Force pilot classmate whose accommodations during the war were more comfortable than Clemons' by ensuring that Shibata wore the only actual [[flak jacket]] in the film; the other cast members wearing foam rubber reproductions.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming started 19 May 1958. Some of the location shooting was conducted in California near [[Westlake Village, California|Westlake Village]] and in [[San Fernando Valley]]. Two months before filming the unit moved into an Albertson Company Ranch where the bulk of the film was to be shot and created a series of trenches.<ref>HOLLYWOOD CANVAS: San Fernando 'Korea' -Versatile Widmark\nBy THOMAS M.

Before the film's premier in May 1959, United Artists cut the film by nearly 20 minutes. Director Lewis Milestone claimed changes were made because [[Veronique Peck]], the wife of star Gregory Peck, felt her husband made his first entrance too late into the picture. While that claim stands as unconfirmed, the film does show signs of post-production editing, with segments of several excised scenes showing up under the main title credits.<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=Pork Chop Hill (1959) - Articles - TCM.com |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]\n  |access-date=2013-12-03 |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17710/Pork-Chop-Hill/articles.html\n  |quote=Nevertheless, Pork Chop Hill was still cut by nearly twenty minutes, supposedly because the wife of star Gregory Peck felt that her husband made his first entrance too late into the picture.
