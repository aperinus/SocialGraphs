It is the eighth installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]]. Set several years after ''The New Blood'', the film follows Jason as he stalks a group of high school graduates on a ship en route to [[New York City]]. It was the final film in the series to be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the United States until 2009, with the subsequent installments being distributed by [[New Line Cinema]].\n\nFilming took place primarily in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, with additional photography in New York's [[Times Square]] and in [[Los Angeles]]. At the time of its production, ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' was the most expensive film in the series, with a budget of over $5 million. It received substantial attention for its initial marketing campaign, featuring Jason Voorhees slashing through the \"[[I Love New York]]\" logo with a knife, which was later retracted after the [[Tourism in New York City|New York City Tourism]] committee filed a complaint against Paramount.\n\nReleased on July 28, 1989, ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' grossed $14.3 million at the domestic box office, making it the poorest-performing film in the ''Friday the 13th'' series to date. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews for what critics saw as weak [[humor]], unintelligent plotting, and a failure to effectively deliver on the promise of its subtitle. The next installment in the series, ''[[Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday]]'', was released in 1993.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile aboard a [[houseboat]] on Crystal Lake, teenager Jim Miller tells his girlfriend Suzi the legend of [[Jason Voorhees]], before playing a prank on her with a [[Goaltender mask|hockey mask]] and a prop knife. The boat's anchor damages some underwater cables that shock Jason's corpse, which is still [[Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood|chained at the bottom of the lake]], and revives him. He sneaks on board, takes the mask, and kills Jim with a [[Harpoon cannon|harpoon gun]] before impaling Suzi.\n\nThe next morning, the SS ''Lazarus'' is ready to set sail for [[New York City]] with a graduating senior class from Lakeview High School, chaperoned by biology teacher Dr. Charles McCulloch and English teacher Colleen Van Deusen. Van Deusen brings McCulloch's niece Rennie along for the trip despite her [[aquaphobia]], much to his chagrin. Jason sneaks on board and kills rock star-wannabe J.J. Jarrett with her guitar. That night, a young boxer who lost his match to champion Julius Gaw is killed by Jason in the ship's [[sauna]]. Rennie, searching for her pet [[Border Collie]] Toby, discovers prom queen Tamara Mason and her friend Eva Watanabe doing drugs. McCulloch nearly catches them moments later and Tamara pushes Rennie overboard, believing that she told on them. She then uses video student Wayne Webber to record McCulloch in a compromising situation with her but rejects Wayne's advances afterward. Jason kills Tamara with a shard of broken mirror after she showers.\n\nRennie sees visions of a young Jason throughout the ship. Jason kills Captain Robertson and his first mate. Rennie's boyfriend and Captain Robertson's son, Sean, discovers them and tells the others before calling for an emergency. Eva finds Tamara's body and flees. Jason chases Eva into the disco room, where he strangles her to death on the dance floor. The students agree to search for Jason while McCulloch decides that the deckhand is responsible. However, the deckhand is found with a [[Axe|fire axe]] in his back. Jason tosses student Miles Wolfe into the [[Transmitter|radio transmitter]] tower to his death, and Julius is knocked overboard. In the hold of the ship, Wayne comes upon J.J.'s body and is thrown into an electrical box by Jason. Wayne's corpse catches fire and causes the ship to take on water. With the other students that were left in the disco room seemingly dead, McCulloch, Van Deusen, Rennie, and Sean escape aboard a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|life raft]] and discover that Toby and Julius are still alive.\n\nThey row to New York where Jason stalks them through the streets. Rennie is kidnapped by a pair of junkies, and the group splits up to find help. Julius fights Jason but becomes exhausted after Jason does not go down and gets decapitated by a single punch from Jason. Rennie escapes from Jason when he kills the punks that kidnapped her. She runs into Sean, and they reunite with the teachers and the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] before Jason kills the officer who is helping them. Rennie crashes a police car after a vision of Jason distracts her. Van Deusen is incinerated in the car when it explodes, and it is revealed that McCulloch is responsible for Rennie's fear of water, having pushed her into the lake as a child. They leave him behind, and Jason drowns him in a barrel of [[toxic waste]].\n\nJason chases Rennie and Sean into the subway, where Sean incapacitates Jason by pushing him onto the [[third rail]]. When Jason revives, he chases them through [[Times Square]] to a [[diner]], and then to the sewers where they encounter a worker. He warns them that the sewers will be flooded with toxic waste at midnight. Jason appears, kills the worker and knocks Sean unconscious. Rennie throws a vat of toxic waste into Jason's face. She and Sean climb a ladder as Jason staggers after them. The sewers flood, and Jason, reminded of his childhood drowning, vomits water. The waste water overcomes Jason, causing his face to melt away. When the water recedes, Sean and Rennie witness what appears to be Jason as an unconscious child. Sean and Rennie make their way back to the street where they are reunited with Rennie's dog Toby in Times Square.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Friday the 13th characters}}\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kane Hodder]] as [[Jason Voorhees]] \n* [[Jensen Daggett]] as Rennie\n* [[Scott Reeves]] as Sean Robertson\n* Barbara Bingham as Colleen Van Deusen\n* [[Peter Mark Richman]] as Charles McCulloch\n* [[Martin Cummins]] as Wayne\n* [[Gordon Currie (actor)|Gordon Currie]] as Miles Wolfe\n* [[Alex Diakun]] as Deck hand\n* V.

[[Ken Kirzinger]], who would go on to portray Jason in ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'', appears in this film as the cook who confronts Jason. Kirzinger served as a stunt coordinator for the film, and doubles as Jason in two short stunt scenes.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=238}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter the disappointing box-office gross of ''[[Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood]]'' (1988),<ref name=gq/> director [[John Carl Buechler]] began developing a follow-up which reprised the character of [[Tina Shepard]] again facing off against [[Jason Voorhees]] after her release from an insane asylum.<ref name=gq/> Meanwhile, [[Lar Park Lincoln]], who had portrayed Tina Shepard, co-wrote (with her husband) an alternative screenplay which had Tina working as a psychologist for troubled girls. Lincoln's co-star in ''The New Blood'', [[Kevin Spirtas]], also wrote a screenplay which recast the events of ''The New Blood'' into a long dream, with his character as the killer.<ref name=gq/> Paramount, however, opted to assign the project of a follow-up to writer-director [[Rob Hedden]],<ref name=gq/> marking his debut feature.<ref name=thomas>{{cite news|work=[[The News Journal]]|title=Locale changes, but Jason is still the killer teens love|author=Thomas, Bob|location=Wilmington, Delaware|publisher=Associated Press|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22910296/the_news_journal/|via=Newspapers.com|page=D4}}</ref>\n\nA former employee of [[Universal Studios]], Hedden strove to devise a screenplay in which the antagonist, [[Jason Voorhees]], would travel outside of the setting of [[Camp Crystal Lake]], the primary location of the previous seven films.<ref name=thomas/> \"The biggest thing we could do with Jason is to get him out of that stupid lake where he's been hanging out,\" Hedden said.<ref name=thomas/> One of Hedden's original ideas was to set the film solely aboard a cruise ship with Jason hiding in the lower levels, described by Hedden as \"a little bit of ''[[Das Boot]]'' and a little bit of ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', with a claustrophobic feeling storm at sea and that sort of stuff.\"<ref name=thomas/> The alternate concept was to place Voorhees in a large city, such as New York. Hedden commented: \"Everything about New York was going to be completely exploited and milked. There was going to be a tremendous scene on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. A boxing match in [[Madison Square Garden]]. Jason would go through department stores. He'd go through Times Square. He'd go into a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play. He'd even crawl onto the top of the [[Statue of Liberty]] and dive off.\"<ref name=gq/>\n\nUltimately, after receiving approval from [[Paramount Pictures]] of both concepts, Hedden decided to combine them, with the first act of the film occurring aboard a ship, and the second on the streets of [[Manhattan]].<ref name=thomas/><ref name=native/> This decision was mainly due to budgetary restrictions from Paramount, as filming exclusively in New York City cost more than the studio was willing to spend.<ref name=gq/> In addition to the shift in setting, Hedden stated he wanted to examine the character of Jason Voorhees as a child, which appears in the film in the form of [[hallucination]]s experienced by Rennie Wickham, the heroine.<ref name=thomas/> To conceal the fact that it was a ''Friday the 13th'' film, the initial working script circulated under the title \"Ashes to Ashes.\"<ref name=clm/>\n\n===Casting===\nActress [[Jensen Daggett]] was cast as the lead of Rennie Wickham, beating out [[Elizabeth Berkley]] and [[Pamela Anderson]] for the role.<ref name=gq/> [[Lisa Wilcox]] was offered a role in the film but turned it down.<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Fangoria]] | issue=86 | date=September 1989 | title=Coming of Age on Elm Street | author=Marc Shapiro | pages=28\u201331 |issn=0164-2111 | url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/site/coming-of-age-on-elm-street/ | access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref> Scott Reeves was cast in the role of Sean Robertson at the last minute after the producers felt the previously-cast actor had no sexual chemistry with Daggett.<ref name=gq/> The film marked the feature debut of actress Kelly Hu.<ref>{{cite web|work=Halloween Daily News|url=http://halloweendailynews.com/2015/06/kelly-hu-interview/|title=[Interview] Kelly Hu Remembers 'Friday The 13th Part VIII'|author=Artz, Matt|date=June 4, 2015|access-date=August 18, 2018|archive-date=August 18, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180818232513/http://halloweendailynews.com/2015/06/kelly-hu-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Peter Mark Richman]] was cast in the film as Charles McCulloch, the students' teacher and Rennie's uncle.{{sfn|Harper|2004|pages=97\u201398}}\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in April 1989 at seven locations in the United States, though the primary filming locations were in [[British Columbia]], Canada,<ref name=native>{{cite news|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=O.C.
