It was produced by Tilde Corsi, Gianni Romoli and Soavi and based on the novel ''Dellamorte Dellamore'' by [[Tiziano Sclavi]].<ref name=\"var\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/dellamorte-dellamore-1200436095/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Dellamorte Dellamore|access-date=16 October 2019|date=28 March 1994|last=Young|first=Deborah}}</ref> Everett plays a beleaguered caretaker of a small Italian cemetery, who searches for love while defending himself from dead people who keep rising again.  It is an international co-production between Italy, France, and Germany.\n\n==Plot==\nFrancesco Dellamorte ([[Rupert Everett]]) is the cemetery caretaker in the small Italian town of Buffalora. He lives in a ramshackle house on the premises, constantly surrounded by death, with only his [[intellectual disability|mentally disabled]] assistant Gnaghi (Fran\u00e7ois Hadji-Lazaro) for company. Young punks in town spread gossip that Dellamorte is [[Erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. His hobbies are reading outdated telephone directories, in which he crosses out the names of the deceased, and trying to assemble a puzzle shaped like a human skull. Gnaghi can speak only one word: \"Gna.\"\n\nThe Latin inscription over the Buffalora Cemetery gate reads ''RESURRECTURIS'' (\"For those who will rise again\"), and indeed, Dellamorte has his hands full. Some people rise from their graves within seven nights following their deaths, as aggressive [[zombies]]. Dellamorte destroys these creatures, which he calls \"Returners\", before they overrun the town. Buffalora's mayor (Stefano Masciarelli) is so fixated on his reelection campaign that he doesn't register Dellamorte's pleas for an investigation. Being an outcast in the village and almost illiterate, Dellamorte doesn't want to lose his job. He opens up to his only friend, Franco, a municipal clerk, but doesn't file the paperwork to get assistance. He explains, \"It's easier just to shoot them.\"\n\nAt a funeral, Dellamorte falls in love with the unnamed young widow ([[Anna Falchi]]) of a rich, elderly man. She is won over when Dellamorte tells her about the [[ossuary]], which she adores. While consummating their relationship by her husband's grave, the undead husband arises and bites her. She seems to die from the bite, but the coroner claims it was a heart attack. Fearing the worst, Dellamorte stays near her corpse, and shoots her when she rises.\n\nGnaghi becomes infatuated with the mayor's teen daughter, Valentina (Fabiana Formica), but she is tragically decapitated in a motorcycle accident. Undeterred, Gnaghi digs up her reanimated head and begins an innocent romance. The relationship is cut short, however, when the mayor finds out and Valentina rips out his throat with her teeth. Dellamorte is forced to shoot her. The young widow also rises again, causing Dellamorte to believe she was [[Suspended animation|not really a zombie]] when he first shot her, in which case it was he who killed her. He plummets into a depression and is visited by the leering figure of [[Death (personification)|Death]], who tells him to \"Stop killing the dead\" and suggests shooting the living instead.\n\nDellamorte encounters two more unnamed women, also played by Falchi. The first is an assistant to the new mayor. She confesses to Dellamorte that she is terrified of sexual penetration, so Dellamorte demands to have his penis removed by the local doctor. Refusing to do so, the doctor instead gives him an injection to induce temporary impotence. Meanwhile, the woman has been raped by and fallen in love with her employer. Having lost her phobia, she plans to marry her rapist and discards the cemetery man.\n\nHis grip on reality slipping, Dellamorte heads into town at night and shoots the young men who have made fun of him for years. He meets a third manifestation of the woman he loves but, upon learning she is a prostitute, kills her and two other women by setting their house on fire. His friend Franco [[Anton Alexander (actor)|(Anton Alexander]]) is accused of these murders after killing his wife and child, and attempts suicide. Dellamorte goes to visit Franco in the hospital. Sitting by the hospital bed, he casually murders a nun, a nurse, and a doctor. Franco claims to not recognize him. Distraught and confused, Dellamorte screams out a confession, but is ignored.\n\nGnaghi and Dellamorte pack up their car, and leave Buffalora. Gnaghi's head is injured when Dellamorte slams on the brakes. They get out of the vehicle and walk to the edge of the road, where it drops into a chasm. Gnaghi begins to seize and collapses to the ground. Dellamorte realizes that the rest of the world doesn't exist. Fearing his assistant is dying, he loads a gun with two [[Expanding bullet|dumdum bullets]] to finish them both off. However, Dellamorte cannot bring himself to shoot his friend. Gnaghi wakes up, drops the gun off the cliff, and asks to be taken home, speaking clearly for the first time. Dellamorte replies: \"Gna.\" As the credits roll, the camera zooms out to reveal the two men standing in a snow globe.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Francesco Dellamorte\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Hadji-Lazaro]] as Gnaghi\n* [[Anna Falchi]] as She\n* [[Mickey Knox (actor)|Mickey Knox]] as Marshall Straniero\n* [[Anton Alexander (actor)|Anton Alexander]] as Franco\n* Fabiana Formica as Valentina Scanarotti\n* Clive Riche as Dr. Vercesi\n* Stefano Masciarelli as Mayor Scanarotti\n* Alessandro Zamattio as Claudio\n* Katja Anton as Claudio's girlfriend\n* [[Barbara Cupisti]] as Magda\n* Patrizia Punzo as Claudio's mother\n* Renato Doris as She's husband\n\n==Release==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2018}}\n''Cemetery Man'' was first released in 1994.<ref name=\"var\" />{{sfn|Curti|2016|p=197}} American distributor [[October Films]] changed its title to ''Cemetery Man'' and released it on April 26, 1996.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/12/arts/home-video-067652.html|title=Home Video|last=Nichols|first=Peter M.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 April 1996|access-date=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] released the film on [[DVD region code|R1]] [[DVD]] in 2006 under the American title ''Cemetery Man''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143707/http://www.anchorbayentertainment.com/index.asp?p=CatalogDetail&SKU=DV13093&PriCatID=3 ''Cemetery Man'' page] on Anchor Bay's website</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 61% of 31 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.10/10.
