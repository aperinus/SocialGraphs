It stars [[Leslie Howard]] as Professor Henry Higgins and [[Wendy Hiller]] as [[Eliza Doolittle]].\n\nThe film was a financial and critical success, and won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] and three more nominations; [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Howard) and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Hiller). The screenplay later was adapted into the 1956 theatrical musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which in turn led to the [[My Fair Lady (film)|1964 film of the same name]].\n\n==Adaptation==\n[[Image:Pygmalion-1938.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scott Sunderland (actor)|Scott Sunderland]], [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] and [[Wendy Hiller]] in ''Pygmalion'']]\nThe Hungarian producer [[Gabriel Pascal]] wished to create a set of films based on Shaw's works, beginning with ''Pygmalion'', and went to see Shaw in person to gain permission to do so. Shaw was reluctant to allow a film adaptation of ''Pygmalion'' owing to the low quality of previous film adaptations of his works, but Pascal managed to convince him (on the condition Shaw retained constant personal supervision of the adaptation)<ref name=WGM/> and later went on to adapt ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'', ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (film)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' and ''[[Androcles and the Lion (1952 film)|Androcles and the Lion]]''.\n\nThe resulting ''Pygmalion'' scenario by [[Cecil Arthur Lewis|Cecil Lewis]] and [[W.P. Lipscomb]] removed exposition unnecessary outside a theatrical context and added new scenes and dialogue by Shaw. [[Ian Dalrymple]], [[Anatole de Grunwald]] and [[Kay Walsh]] also made uncredited contributions to the screenplay. A long ballroom sequence was added, introducing an entirely new character, Count Aristid Karpathy (seen both here and in the musical ''My Fair Lady'', named as Professor Zoltan Karpathy \u2013 mentioned in the final scene of the original play, but with no name or onstage appearance), written wholly by Shaw. He and his fellow writers also managed to retain the controversial line \"Not bloody likely!\" from the play's text, making Hiller possibly the first person to utter that [[profanity|swear word]] in a British film<ref name=WGM>{{cite news |author=W.G.M. |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46376704 |title=Shaw on the Screen |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |volume=55 |issue=16,452 |location=Western Australia |date=24 March 1939 |access-date=20 February 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and giving rise to adverts for the film reading \"Miss Pygmalion?  Not ****** likely!\".{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Plot==\nWhile wandering around [[Covent Garden]], transcribing the conversation of passers-by, [[linguist]] Professor Higgins is mistaken for a policeman, causing hysterical protests from the flower girl Eliza Doolittle. The incident is cleared up with the help of Colonel Pickering, also a scholar of languages and dialects, who has come from India in order to meet Higgins. Bragging before Pickering, Higgins argues that by teaching Eliza to speak correctly, she could have a better future; indeed, he would be able to pass her off as a duchess. \n\nNext morning, Eliza arrives at Higgins' house to ask for elocution lessons. Colonel Pickering then makes a bet with Higgins, offering to pay all the expenses if the professor manages to fulfil his boast in the space of a few months. Eliza is then taken to have a bath by Mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, and all her clothes but her floral hat are burned. While this is taking place, Eliza's father, the dustman Alfred Doolittle, arrives to demand compensation for the loss of his daughter. Amused by his roguish attitude, Higgins offers him \u00a310, but Doolittle will only accept \u00a35, explaining that as one of the \"undeserving poor\" he only wants enough for a drunken weekend. \n\nAfter the tiring internship to which she is subjected by an inflexible Higgins, Eliza is sent as an experiment to an at-home gathering held by Mrs Higgins, the professor\u2019s mother.  There, though speaking in a well-bred accent, Eliza scandalizes those present with her vulgar, slang-filled conversation and profanity. But one of the guests - young Freddy Eynsford Hill - is fascinated by the girl. After the guests leave, Mrs Higgins voices her disgust that Eliza's two protectors are treating her more like a plaything than a human being.\n\nAfter weeks of further coaching, during which Freddy tries in vain to see her again, Eliza is finally accompanied by Higgins and Pickering to an embassy reception. There Higgins meets his former pupil, the [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] Count Aristid Karpathy, who has become famous for his ability to coach American heiresses in elocution and identify the origins of high society people from their way of speaking. Higgins and Pickering fear that Eliza will be exposed by him, but she manages to deceive him so successfully that he takes her for a princess.\n\nReturning from the reception, Higgins and Pickering congratulate each other on their success, neglecting Eliza's important contribution and commitment. Wounded by their indifference, Eliza quarrels with the professor over this and because she has become unsuited to her former way of life. After he goes to bed, she leaves to take refuge at the home of Mrs Higgins. \n\nNext morning Higgins visits his mother and is relieved to learn that Eliza is there. Before they can meet, however, Mr Doolittle arrives to complain of the way Higgins has disrupted his life. Higgins had mentioned to an American millionaire that the most original moralist in England was Doolittle, and when the millionaire died he had left Doolittle a fee of a few thousands to give six lectures a year, thus forcing respectability on the dustman. He is now on his way to a fashionable London church to marry his unwed partner and persuades Eliza, Pickering and Mrs Higgins to support him through the ordeal.  \n\nHiggins and Eliza are left alone for a while and he tries to persuade her to return home with him, but she objects that he simply takes her for granted. Instead she would prefer to marry Freddy, who is charming but has no income. When Higgins scoffs at this, Eliza horrifies him by threatening to use her newly-learned talents to give elocution lessons and so gain economic independence. The matter is left unresolved and the future uncertain as the party leaves for the wedding.\n\n==Cast and crew==\nWendy Hiller was chosen by Shaw to play Eliza Doolittle after she had appeared in stage productions of ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' and ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' \u2013 though the film's initial credits stated that this movie was introducing her, she had in fact already appeared on film in 1937's ''[[Lancashire Luck]]''. Shaw's choice for Higgins had been [[Charles Laughton]]. The movie also includes the very first film appearance (brief and uncredited) of [[Anthony Quayle]], as an Italian wigmaker. [[Cathleen Nesbitt]], credited here as Kathleen Nesbitt in the role of 'A Lady,' portrayed Mrs. Higgins in the original Broadway production of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' 18 years later.\n\nThe film's crew included [[David Lean]] (on his first major editing job; he also directed the montage sequence of Higgins teaching Eliza), set designer [[Laurence Irving (set designer)|Laurence Irving]] and the camera operator [[Jack Hildyard]] (who later photographed Lean's ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', ''[[The Sound Barrier]]'' and ''[[Hobson's Choice (1954 film)|Hobson's Choice]]'').\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File: Pygmalion 1938 Laserdisc Cover.jpg|thumb|Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard in ''Pygmalion'']]\n* [[Leslie Howard]] as Professor Henry Higgins\n* [[Wendy Hiller]] as Eliza Doolittle\n* [[Wilfrid Lawson (actor)|Wilfrid Lawson]] as Alfred Doolittle \n* [[Marie Lohr]] as Mrs. Higgins\n* [[Scott Sunderland (actor)|Scott Sunderland]] as Colonel George Pickering\n* [[Jean Cadell]] as Mrs. Pearce\n* [[David Tree]] as Freddy Eynsford-Hill\n* [[Everley Gregg]] as Mrs. Eynsford-Hill\n* [[Leueen MacGrath]] as Clara Eynsford-Hill\n* [[Esme Percy]] as Count Aristid Karpathy\n* [[Violet Vanbrugh]] as the Ambassadress\n* [[Iris Hoey]] as  Ysabel, Social Reporter\n* [[Viola Tree]] as Perfide, Social Reporter \n* [[Irene Browne]] as the Duchess\n* [[Kate Cutler]] as The Grand Old Lady\n* [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] as Old Lady\n* [[O.

The film also received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Howard) and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Hiller). Shaw's reaction to his award was: \"It's an insult for them to offer me any honour, as if they had never heard of me before&nbsp;\u2013 and it's very likely they never have. They might as well send some honour to [[George VI|George]] for being {{sic|King of England}}.\"  However, his friend [[Mary Pickford]] later reported seeing the award on display in his home.\n\nAt the [[6th Venice International Film Festival|1938 Venice Film Festival]], Leslie Howard won the [[Venice Film Festival#Volpi Cup best actor|Volpi Cup]] and the film was nominated for the [[Venice Film Festival#Mussolini Cup for best foreign film|Mussolini Cup]].\n\nThe copyright of the film ''Pygmalion'' lapsed in the United States in 1966 after its rights holder, [[Loew's Incorporated]], failed to renew its copyright registration; as such, the film entered the [[public domain]]. However, in the [[9th Circuit]] case ''Russell v. Price'' (1979), Shaw's estate was able to assert its rights in the underlying work (Shaw's play), and thus retain control over the film's distribution and public performance in the United States as a [[derivative work]].<ref>Steven Mitchell Schiffman, \u201cMovies in the Public Domain: A Threatened Species\u201d.
