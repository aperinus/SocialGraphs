Released and taking place 19 years after [[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|the previous film]], it is set in 1957, pitting [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) against Soviet [[KGB]] agents led by Irina Spalko ([[Cate Blanchett]])\u2014searching for a [[telepath]]ic [[crystal skull]]. Jones is aided by his former lover, [[Marion Ravenwood]] ([[Karen Allen]]), and their son, [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Mutt Williams|Mutt Williams]] ([[Shia LaBeouf]]). [[Ray Winstone]], [[John Hurt]], and [[Jim Broadbent]] are also part of the supporting cast.\n\nScreenwriters [[Jeb Stuart (writer)|Jeb Stuart]], [[Jeffrey Boam]], [[Frank Darabont]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Jeff Nathanson]] wrote drafts before [[David Koepp]]'s script satisfied the producers. The filmmakers intended to pay tribute to the [[B movies (Transition in the 1950s)|science fiction B-movies of the 1950s era]]. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, at various locations in [[New Mexico]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Fresno, California]], as well as on [[sound stage]]s in Los Angeles. To maintain aesthetic continuity with the previous films, the crew relied on traditional [[Stunt|stunt work]] instead of computer-generated [[stunt double]]s, and [[cinematographer]] [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] studied [[Douglas Slocombe]]'s style from the previous films.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 18, 2008, and was released worldwide on May 22, 2008. It received generally positive reviews from critics but mixed responses from audiences. Critics praised the film for its cast, pulpy tone, action sequences, John Williams's musical score, and the costume design, but criticized the dialogue, storyline, pacing, and overuse of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. It was also a financial success like the previous three films in the series, grossing over $790 million worldwide, becoming the franchise's highest-grossing film when not adjusted for inflation, as well as the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2008]].\n\n''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' is also the last film in the ''Indiana Jones'' franchise to be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]], as [[The Walt Disney Company]] became the distributor of its future films following [[Lucasfilm#Subsidiary of Walt Disney (2012\u2013present)|the company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012]], with Paramount still retaining this film and its predecessors and receiving \"financial participation\" from any additional films beginning with [[Untitled fifth Indiana Jones film|the fifth film]], which is scheduled for release on June 30, 2023, with Ford set to reprise his role.<ref>{{Cite web|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=2021-10-18|title=Marvel Movie Shifts: 'Doctor Strange 2' To Kick Off Summer 2022, 'Thor: Love And Thunder' Heads To July & More|url=https://deadline.com/2021/10/doctor-strange-2-thor-love-and-thunder-black-panther-wakanda-forever-release-date-changes-1234857549/|access-date=2021-10-18|website=Deadline|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP: FILM PLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1957, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]] agents, working under Irina Spalko, kidnap [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]] and his partner George \"Mac\" MicHale. The Soviets infiltrate a secret government warehouse, located in [[Nevada]], labeled \"[[Hangar 51]]\", and force Jones to locate a mummified alien corpse from the [[Roswell UFO incident]], which he was forced to work on 10 years earlier. Shortly after retrieving the corpse, Mac reveals he has become a [[double agent]] on the [[KGB]]\u2019s payroll. Jones unsuccessfully attempts to steal the body, and fights with Spalko's henchman Dovchenko, before escaping to a nearby model town right before an atomic bomb test. He takes shelter in a lead-lined refrigerator, and [[FBI]] agents eventually rescue, decontaminate, and interrogate him, suspecting him of working for the Soviets. Though eventually freed, Jones is put on an indefinite leave of absence from Marshall College, and dean Charles Stanforth resigns to spare Jones from being fired.\n\n[[Greaser (subculture)|Greaser]] Mutt Williams approaches Jones, notifying him that Jones\u2019 former colleague, Professor Harold Oxley, found a [[crystal skull]] in Peru, but has since been kidnapped along with Mutt's mother, Marion, who went after him. Jones tells Mutt of the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator, and Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, which contains a riddle from Oxley in an ancient language. Two Soviet agents attempt to capture them, but Jones and Mutt escape and, following the riddle's meaning, reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital, carvings on the walls and floor of Oxley's cell lead them to the grave of [[Francisco de Orellana]], a [[Conquistador]] who searched for Akator. They find the skull at the grave, and Jones reasons that Oxley had returned it there. While the two are departing the tomb, Mac and the Soviets take them hostage and deliver them to the Soviet camp in the [[Amazon jungle]]. There, the pair find an addled Oxley and Marion, who is actually [[Marion Ravenwood]], an old partner of Jones'; she reveals to Jones that Mutt is his son.\n\nSpalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form that holds great [[psychic]] power. Finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviet Union the ability to control the world via telepathy. Jones realizes that Oxley is attempting to communicate through [[automatic writing]], and locates a route to Akator. The next day, while en route to the ancient city, Jones and his team fight their way out of the KGB's clutches, with Dovchenko being devoured by a swarm of [[army ants]]. Mac informs Jones he is a [[CIA]] double agent. After surviving three waterfalls in an [[GAZ 46|amphibious vehicle]], Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac had lied about being a CIA agent and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.\n\nJones's team evades the city's guardians, gains access to the temple, and finds it filled with artifacts from many [[Civilization|ancient civilizations]]. They realize the aliens are \"[[Ancient astronauts|archaeologists]]\" [[Xenoarchaeology|studying]] the different cultures of Earth. They find and enter a chamber containing 13 crystal skeletons, one of which is missing its skull. When Spalko arrives and replaces the skull, the skeletons telepathically offer to give a reward to the group, using Oxley as a translator. She demands to simply know all the knowledge of the aliens; the aliens reanimate and transfer an overwhelming amount of knowledge into her mind, killing her. A portal to their dimension is activated, and Mac and all of the remaining Soviets are drawn in, while Jones and his team escape. As the city crumbles, a [[flying saucer]] rises from the ruins and departs for another dimension, and the waters of the Amazon flood the hollow left by its takeoff.\n\nThe following year, Jones is reinstated at Marshall College as its associate dean, and marries Marion, with Oxley, who has regained his sanity, and Mutt as witnesses.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Indianajones4.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|[[Harrison Ford]] during the filming of the movie]]\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]; To prepare for the role, the 64<!-- don't change, he turned 65 during filming which is after the training-->-year-old Ford spent three hours a day at a gym, practiced with the [[bullwhip]] for two weeks,<ref name=pre/> and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1270011.php |title=Indiana Jones 4: A fit Ford |date=February 27, 2007 |work=Monsters and Critics |access-date=March 29, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601184608/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/movies/news/article_1270011.php|archive-date=2009-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-02-12-indiana-jones_N.htm |title=Here come Harrison (in fine form) and 'Indiana Jones' |author=Bowles |first=Scott |date=February 12, 2008 |work=[[USA Today]] |access-date=February 14, 2008 |publisher=[[Gannett]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620071127/https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-02-12-indiana-jones_N.htm|archive-date=2009-06-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> He performed many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance.<ref name=\"ford\"/> Ford felt his return would also help American culture be less paranoid about aging (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: \"This is a movie which is geared not to [the young] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment [...] We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints.\"<ref name=\"ford\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20192918,00.html |title=Harrison Ford Q&A: Indy speaks! |author=Daly |first=Steve |date=April 19, 2008 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]], ew.com |access-date=April 19, 2008 |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425071130/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20192918,00.html|archive-date=2009-04-25|url-status=live}}</ref> He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script.<ref name=\"Koeppmag\">{{Cite journal |author=Peter N.
