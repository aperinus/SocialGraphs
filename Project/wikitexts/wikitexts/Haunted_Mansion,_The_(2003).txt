The film stars [[Eddie Murphy]] as a realtor who, along with his family, becomes trapped in a [[haunted house|haunted mansion]]. [[Terence Stamp]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Marsha Thomason]], and [[Jennifer Tilly]] appear in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States on November 26, 2003, to mostly negative reviews from critics but performed well at the box office with $182.3 million worldwide on a $90 million budget. A [[Haunted Mansion (2023 film)|reboot]] directed by [[Justin Simien]] is set to be released in August 2023.\n\n==Plot==\nJim and Sara Evers are successful [[realtors]] with two children, Michael and Megan. A workaholic with little time for his family, Jim misses his wedding anniversary and tries to make amends by suggesting a vacation to the nearby lake. Sara is contacted by the occupants of Gracey Manor, located in the nearby [[bayou]]; Jim, eager to make a deal after learning where the mansion is, takes his family there, meeting its owner, Edward Gracey, his butler Ramsley and his other servants; [[maid]] Emma and [[footman]] Ezra.\n\nWhen a rainstorm floods the nearby river, Gracey lets the family stay for the night. Ramsley takes Jim to the library to discuss the deal with Gracey, but Jim becomes trapped in a secret passage. Gracey gives Sara a tour of the mansion, discussing his past and his \u201cgrandfather\u2019s\u201d death after the suicide of his lover, Elizabeth Henshaw. Megan and Michael follow a [[Will-o'-the-wisp|spectral orb]] to the attic, where they find a portrait of a woman that bears an almost identical resemblance to Sara. Emma and Ezra appear, and identify the woman as the late Elizabeth.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim meets Madame Leota, the ghost of a [[Romani people|gypsy]] whose head is encased in a [[crystal ball]]. He runs into Emma, Ezra and his children, and returns to Leota for answers about Elizabeth's likeness to Sara. It is then revealed that the mansion's inhabitants are ghosts, cursed a century ago by Elizabeth's and Gracey's untimely deaths, and can only enter the afterlife when the lovers are reunited; Sara is believed to be Elizabeth's reincarnation. Leota sends the Evers to the mansion's cemetery to find a key that will reveal the truth about Elizabeth's death. In a crypt beneath a [[mausoleum]], Jim and Megan find the key, but inadvertently disturb its [[Zombie|undead]] residents. However, they escape with help from Michael, who overcomes his [[arachnophobia]].\n\nLeota leads them to a trunk in the attic, which Jim unlocks to find a letter Elizabeth wrote to Gracey, revealing she truly loved him and wanted to marry him, indicating that she did not commit suicide as everyone believed. Ramsley then appears and reveals he murdered Elizabeth to prevent Gracey from abandoning his heritage, as he believed their relationship was unacceptable. To hide the truth, Ramsley traps the children in a trunk and literally throws Jim out of the mansion. As Gracey and Sara rendezvous in the ballroom, she is confused when he asks if she recognizes him, and he insists she is his beloved Elizabeth. The room fills with dancing ghosts as Gracey reveals his ghostly self, but Sara denies being Elizabeth. This gives Gracey second thoughts, but Ramsley insists that Sara ''is'' Elizabeth and, in time, she will remember. Ramsley then blackmails Sara into marrying Gracey in exchange for her children's safety.\n\nEncouraged by Leota, Jim manages to re-enter the mansion, rescue his children, and stop Sara and Gracey's wedding. He gives Gracey Elizabeth's letter and Ramsley's crime is exposed. As Gracey angrily confronts Ramsley, the latter hypocritically rages at his master's apparent selfishness for loving Elizabeth and summons wraiths to attack the group. However, with the truth revealed, a [[Elemental|fiery entity]] emerges from the ballroom's fireplace and drags Ramsley down to [[Hell]] to face eternal punishment. Ramsley attempts to take Jim with him, but he is saved by Gracey. Sara collapses, having been poisoned by Ramsley during the wedding ceremony, but the spectral orb appears and possesses Sara. The orb is revealed to be Elizabeth's ghost, who could only be released from her current form once the truth was revealed, and thanks Jim for saving her. Elizabeth and Gracey reunite as Sara is subsequently revived.\n\nWith the curse finally lifted, Gracey gives the Evers the deed to the mansion and departs to [[Heaven]] with Elizabeth, Emma, Ezra, and the mansion's other inhabitants. The Evers drive across the [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] for a proper vacation, accompanied by Leota and four singing busts that they encountered while searching for the mausoleum, strapped to the back of their car.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Jim Evers, a successful yet workaholic real estate agent who is often late for family gatherings, but tries his best to make up for it. \n* [[Terence Stamp]] as Ramsley, the ghost of Gracey Manor's butler who serves as a fatherly figure to Master Gracey. He is later revealed to be responsible for Elizabeth's death.\n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as Master Edward Gracey, the ghost of Gracey Manor's owner who longs for his lost love, Elizabeth Henshaw, to return to him after her apparent suicide.\n* [[Marsha Thomason]] as Sara Evers, Jim's disapproving wife who is also his business partner. Thomason also portrays Elizabeth Henshaw, the ghost of Master Gracey's long lost lover who bears a striking resemblance to Sara.\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as Madame Leota, the ghost of a gypsy whose head is encased in her crystal ball.\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Ezra, the ghost of a bumbling footman who worries about getting into trouble.\n* [[Dina Spybey]] as Emma, the ghost of a nervous but helpful maid who seems terrified of Ramsley.\n* [[Marc John Jefferies]] as Michael Evers, Jim and Sara's arachnophobic son. Jefferies based the arachnophobia on [[Ron Weasley]] from the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' series]].\n* [[Ariel Alexandria Davis|Aree Davis]] as Megan Evers, Jim and Sara's impatient daughter.\n* [[The Dapper Dans]] as the voices of the Singing Busts.\n* [[Deep Roy]], [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]], and Clay Martinez as the Hitchhiking Ghosts.\n* [[Corey Burton]] as the voice of the Ghost Host.\n\nThe film's chief makeup artist [[Rick Baker]] appears in the graveyard scene as a ghost behind a tombstone, using an appearance based on a portrait of the Ghost Host seen in the attraction. The cast also includes an uncredited [[Martin Klebba]] as Pickwick, one the ghosts in the graveyard, albeit unnamed and only known as \"Happy Ghost\" and director [[Rob Minkoff]]'s nephew, who appears as the paperboy in the opening scene.\n\n==Production==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nThe mansion scenes were filmed at [[Movie ranch#Sable Ranch|Sable Ranch]] in [[Santa Clarita, California]]. The main building was constructed over a period of weeks while the cupola and chimneys on the top of the mansion were computer-generated. The rest of film was shot in New Orleans and surrounding areas. The mansion's architecture is Renaissance-influenced with a mix of antebellum and Dutch-colonial revival architecture. One evidence of this is the exterior design, which is a mix-up of the attraction's exteriors in both Disneyland and Walt Disney World, with the conservatory being a nod to the latter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nFive [[Hidden Mickey]]s are seen throughout the film; the most notable ones being the padlock at the mansion's gates, the second when an axe wielded by an animated suit of armor nearly hits Jim, and a third which is briefly seen when Ramsley poisons a goblet of wine during the wedding ceremony. Two other hidden mickeys are the couch in the library and the windows on the doors Jim passes when he is chased by musical instruments summoned by Madame Leota. Before leaving the mansion via a [[hearse]] to find the mausoleum, Ezra exclaims \"there's always my way,\" a pivotal line of dialogue from the attraction.\n\nThe costume and special effects designers wanted the ghost characters to become \"more dead\" the farther they were from the mansion. While Ezra and Emma look human in the house, their leaving it causes them to become blue and transparent. The zombies in the mausoleum were described as the \"deadest as they are farthest away\". [[Rick Baker]], the chief costume designer, did the [[prosthetic makeup]] for the zombies in the mausoleum, using skull heads for the zombie design. He also designed one of the zombies as an elderly man holding a cane in order for the mausoleum scene not to be too frightening to viewers.\n\nThis was the first film to air on [[Disney Channel]] to contain any profanity besides \"hell\" or \"damn\", the \"Big ass termites!\" line uttered by Jim when he sees the breathing door.\n\nIn the opening scene of the film, Nathaniel Parker had great difficulty trying to carry Marsha Thomason up the staircase, which is shown on the expressions of his face. This was due to her slippery silk dress.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Release==\nThe teaser trailer debuted in October 2002 with ''[[Tuck Everlasting (2002 film)|Tuck Everlasting]]'' and on VHS in February 2003.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nAccording to [[Box Office Mojo]], ''The Haunted Mansion'' grossed $24,278,410 on its opening weekend with an average of $7,776 per theatre in the United States.
