The film stars [[James Franco]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Amber Tamblyn]] and [[Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy]]. In the film, [[Canyoning|canyoneer]] [[Aron Ralston]] must find a way to escape after he gets trapped by a [[boulder]] in an isolated [[slot canyon]] in [[Bluejohn Canyon]], southeastern [[Utah]], in April 2003. It is a British and American venture produced by [[Path\u00e9]], Everest Entertainment, [[Film4 Productions]], [[HandMade Films]] and Cloud Eight Films.\n\nThe film, based on Ralston's memoir ''[[Between a Rock and a Hard Place (book)|Between a Rock and a Hard Place]]'' (2004), was written by Boyle and [[Simon Beaufoy]], co-produced by [[Christian Colson]] and [[John Smithson]], and scored by [[A. R. Rahman]]. Beaufoy, Colson, and Rahman had all previously worked with Boyle on ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (2008). ''127 Hours'' was well received by critics and audiences and grossed $60 million worldwide. It was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Franco and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\nThe film's title refers to the period of non-stop activity from when Ralston was stranded in Blue John Canyon once his arm was trapped underneath a boulder, to when he was rescued and resuscitated.<ref>{{cite book |last= Ralston |first= Aron |title= Between a Rock and a Hard Place |url= https://archive.org/details/betweenrockandha00rals |url-access= registration |location= New York |publisher= Atria Books |year= 2004 |page= [https://archive.org/details/betweenrockandha00rals/page/326 326] |isbn= 978-0-7434-9282-9 |quote= ...before my streak of 127 hours of uninterrupted experience ends at three forty-five P.M., Thursday, May 1, 2003.}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn April 2003, avid mountaineer [[Aron Ralston]] goes hiking at [[Utah]]'s [[Canyonlands National Park]] without telling anyone. He befriends hikers Kristi and Megan and shows them an underground pool before they head home. After that, Aron continues through a [[slot canyon]] in [[Bluejohn Canyon]]. While climbing, a [[boulder]] he was hanging off comes loose and causes both to fall, which traps his right arm against the wall. Aron attempts to move the boulder, but it will not budge; he also soon realizes he is alone. He shortly begins recording a [[Video blog|video diary]] using his camcorder to maintain morale as he chips away parts of the boulder with a pocket knife. Over the next five days, Aron rations his food and remaining 300ml of water, struggles to keep warm at night, and is forced to [[Urophagia|drink his urine]] when his water runs out. He also sets up a [[pulley]] using his climbing rope in a futile attempt to lift the boulder.\n\nThroughout the days, Aron becomes desperate and depressed and begins hallucinating about escape, relationships, and past experiences, including his family and his former girlfriend, Rana. During one hallucination, Aron realizes his mistake was that he did not tell anyone where he was going or for how long. Aron has a vision of his future son on the sixth day, spurring his will to survive. He fashions a [[tourniquet]] from [[CamelBak]] tube insulation and uses a [[carabiner]] to tighten it. Then, using his knowledge of [[torque]], he breaks the bones in his arm and, using the multi-tool, slowly [[Amputation|amputates]] it. Aron then wraps the stump to prevent [[exsanguination]] and takes a picture of the boulder before rappelling down a {{cvt|65|ft}} rockface. He then finds some rainwater collected while descending down, drinks the stagnant water due to dehydration, and continues. He spots a family on a hike in the desert and calls for help. They give him water and alert the authorities; a [[Utah Highway Patrol]] helicopter brings him to a hospital.\n\nA textual epilogue reveals that years later, Aron got married and had a son. He also continues climbing and always leaves a note telling his family where he has gone.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[James Franco]] as [[Aron Ralston]]\n* [[Kate Mara]] as Kristi Moore\n* [[Amber Tamblyn]] as Megan McBride\n* [[Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy]] as Rana, Aron's lover\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Sonja Ralston, Aron's younger sister\n* [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]] as Donna Ralston, Aron's mother\n* [[Treat Williams]] as Larry Ralston, Aron's father\n\nRalston himself, his wife, and his son make [[cameo appearance]]s at the end of the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2010/10/james_franco_and_aaron_ralston.html |title=James Franco and Aron Ralston Explain How to Watch 127 Hours Without Fainting |last=Yuan |first=Jada |date=25 October 2010 |access-date=19 August 2018 |work=[[Vulture.com]] |publisher=New York Media LLC. |archive-date=7 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201107105427/https://www.vulture.com/2010/10/james_franco_and_aaron_ralston.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Authenticity==\nThe scenes early in the film of Ralston's encounter with the two hikers were altered to portray Ralston showing them a hidden pool, when in reality he just showed them some basic climbing moves. Despite these changes, with which he was initially uncomfortable, Ralston says the rest of the film is \"so factually accurate it is as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Barkham |first=Patrick |title=The Extraordinary Story Behind Danny Boyle's 127 Hours |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=15 December 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/15/story-danny-boyles-127-hours |access-date=14 April 2011 |location=London |archive-date=20 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920210235/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/15/story-danny-boyles-127-hours |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOther changes from the book include omissions of descriptions of Ralston's efforts after freeing himself: his bike was chained to itself, not to the tree as depicted at the beginning of the movie; he had to decide where to seek the fastest medical attention; he took a photo of himself at the small brown pool from which he really did drink; he had his first bowel movement of the week; he abandoned many of the items he had kept throughout his confinement; he got lost in a side canyon; and he met a family from the [[Netherlands]] (not an American family), Eric, Monique, and Andy Meijer, who already knew that he was probably lost in the area, thanks to the searches of his parents and the authorities. (The actor who plays Eric Meijer, [[Pieter Jan Brugge]], is Dutch.)\n\nFranco is never shown uttering even an \"Ow\"; Ralston wrote that this is accurate.<ref>''Between a Rock and a Hard Place'', p. 283. \"I still haven't uttered even an 'Ow!' \"I don't think to verbalize the pain; it's a part of the experience, no more important to the procedure than the color of my tourniquet.\"</ref> Ralston did send Monique and Andy to run ahead to get help, and Ralston did walk seven miles before the helicopter came,<ref>Ralston, ''Between a Rock and a Hard Place'', p. 317. \"It is mile seven, and a few minutes after three P.M. ... It will kill me if I try to hike out of this canyon. I've lost too much blood; I'm on the verge of deadly shock. I contemplate sending Eric up to get help as well, but before I can spit out the idea, the rapid stutter of a booming echo interrupts my thoughts... Two hundred yards in front of us, the metallic body of a wingless black bird rises over the canyon wall.\"</ref> although this trek is shown in the film's alternative ending.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Danny Boyle]] had been wanting to make a film about Ralston's ordeal for four years;<ref name=\"indieWire\">{{cite news |title=Nine Things I Learned at BAFTA's Brittania Awards |first=Anne |last=Thompson |author-link=Anne Thompson (film critic) |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2009/11/06/bafta_brittania_awards_stiller_mcgregor_douglas_schwarzenegger_blunt |work=[[indieWire]] |date=6 November 2009 |access-date=19 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227112524/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2009/11/06/bafta_brittania_awards_stiller_mcgregor_douglas_schwarzenegger_blunt |archive-date=27 December 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> he wrote a [[film treatment]] and Simon Beaufoy wrote the screenplay.<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite news |title=Boyle, Searchlight Firm Mountaineer Tale |first=Mike |last=Fleming |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/bfdealmemo/2009/11/boyle-searchlight-firm-mountaineer-tale.html |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=4 November 2009 |access-date=19 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109102900/http://weblogs.variety.com/bfdealmemo/2009/11/boyle-searchlight-firm-mountaineer-tale.html |archive-date=9 November 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Boyle describes ''127 Hours'' as \"an action movie with a guy who can't move.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's latest movie boosts London Film Festival |first=Louise |last=Jury |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/film/article-23866813-danny-boyles-latest-movie-boosts-london-film-festival.do#readerComments |newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=13 August 2010 |access-date=15 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817164110/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/film/article-23866813-danny-boyles-latest-movie-boosts-london-film-festival.do#readerComments |archive-date=17 August 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> He also expressed an interest for a more intimate film than his previous film, ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (2008): \"I remember thinking, I must do a film where I follow an actor the way [[Darren Aronofsky]] did with ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]].''

Boyle stressed that the realism of the arm as well as the process itself were key to the audience's investing in the character's experience, and that the makeup effects' success would impact the film's success. The false arm rigs were created in layers, from fiberglass and steel bone, through silicone and fibrous muscle and tendon, to functional veins and arteries, and finally skinned with a translucent silicone layer of skin with a thin layer of subcutaneous silicone fat. Gardner states that the effects work was extremely stressful, as he wanted to do justice to the story; he credits James Franco equally with the success of the effects work.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Three prosthetics were used in all, with two designed to show the innards of the arm and another to emulate the outside of it.<ref name=\"Vulturefaint\">{{cite web|last1=Yuan|first1=Jada|title=James Franco and Aron Ralston Explain How to Watch 127 Hours Without Fainting|url=https://www.vulture.com/2010/10/james_franco_and_aaron_ralston.html|website=Vulture|access-date=11 April 2016|archive-date=7 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201107105427/https://www.vulture.com/2010/10/james_franco_and_aaron_ralston.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Franco would later note that seeing blood on the arm was difficult for him and his reactions in those scenes were genuine.<ref name=\"Vulturefaint\"/>\n\nFranco admitted that shooting the film was physically hard on him: \"There was a lot of physical pain, and Danny knew that it was going to cause a lot of pain.
