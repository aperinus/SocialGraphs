The television film was released on American cable channel [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] on December 7, 2008. It is a sequel to 2004's ''[[The Librarian: Quest for the Spear]]'' and 2006's ''[[The Librarian: Return to King Solomon's Mines]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=August 2016}}\n[[The Librarian (franchise)|Librarian]] Flynn Carsen ([[Noah Wyle]]) is in [[England]] bidding on a priceless [[Ming vase]] for the Library. He is simultaneously on the phone with Charlene (Jane Curtin) and with his girlfriend, Katie (Beth Burvant), who is at the end of her rope. Frantic and distracted, he bids \u00a31 million and loses Katie. He signs for the vase and promptly breaks it, revealing the [[philosopher's stone]], which changes anything it touches into [[gold]]. Flynn deftly defends the stone and races to meet Katie: She has flown home.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathia]], a group of former [[KGB]] agents led by Sergei Kubichek ([[Dikran Tulaine]]) plot to bring back the defunct [[Soviet Union]] by resurrecting the famous [[vampire]], [[Prince]] [[Vlad Dracula]], using the \"Judas Chalice.\u201d In  [[Bucharest]], they kidnap Professor Lazlo ([[Bruce Davison]]), a genius historian with a penchant for vampire lore who has searched for the chalice for years. The elderly, disabled professor joins them unwillingly and directs them to [[New Orleans]].\n\nIn the Library, Charlene chastises Flynn for going over budget. Combined with the loss of Katie, this is the last straw: He has a full-blown meltdown. Judson ([[Bob Newhart]]), Charlene ([[Jane Curtin]]), and the sword [[Excalibur]] (his best friend) suggest that Flynn take a vacation. Charlene wonders if he'll come back, and Judson replies that the Library has plans for him.\n\nCharlene drops by Flynn's apartment after her combination-speed-dating-and-wine-tasting to give him some travel brochures and advice: \u201cFollow your dreams.\u201d. That night, Flynn's strange dreams point him to New Orleans. There, he meets Andrew ( pronounced Andr\u00e9)<ref>Cast lists show him as Andrew, but it is pronounced Andr\u00e9, and his taxi reads \u201cANDRE'S\u201d</ref> (Werner Richmond), a guide. In a [[Cathedral|church]]-turned-[[nightclub]], he encounters singer Simone Renoir ([[Stana Katic]]), the woman in his dreams. She guards the first marker for locating the Judas Chalice. After narrowly escaping Kubichek's men, Flynn and Simone do the town and spend the night together.\n\nIn the morning, Flynn has a magical encounter with Judson, who explains that the Judas Chalice is the vampire version of the [[Holy Grail]], formed from the [[Thirty pieces of silver|30 pieces of silver]] given to [[Judas Iscariot]] after he betrayed [[Jesus Christ]]. Judson tells Flynn to intercept the chalice and gives him crucial information about staking vampires: The stake must be of [[aspen]] wood because Judas, the first vampire,  hanged himself on an aspen.\n\nFlynn deciphers the clues on the first marker. Andrew takes him to the tomb of [[Marie Laveau]], the \"[[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] queen\" of New Orleans, where he discovers the second marker, only to be grabbed by Kubichek's men. Kubichek introduces Professor Lazlo. They poison Flynn with a [[hallucinogenic|hallucinogen]] so that they can stage an accident. Before it kicks in, Flynn escapes his bonds. He and  Professor Lazlo, working in nearly perfect synchrony, decipher its clues.  It is a lens with a map inscribed on it. The professor tells Flynn to run. He flees through a [[Carnival]]-style street party until Kubichek's men corner him. Simone attacks the henchmen, turning into mist and exerting inhuman strength until one blasts her in the chest with a shotgun. Flynn causes a gas fire, giving him time to carry Simone's dead body outside. Flynn grieves\u2014until she rises.\n\nHe passes out and wakes in Simone's home. She is a vampire, born in [[Paris]], [[France]] in 1603, and turned at age 25. She had been a promising opera singer, deeply in love with a university teacher (played by [[Noah Wyle]]), until a chance encounter with a vampire changed her. She wants to destroy her maker so she can die in peace. When she learned of the Judas Chalice, she vowed to protect it and aid the monks who hid it in New Orleans. She has done so for two hundred years. Simone shows Flynn a 1,000-year-old painting that represents the fight of the Library against Evil. It shows the Scholar, the first Librarian, builder of the Library. The Knight/Scholar's shield is blazoned with the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]]. His name is Yahuda, \u201cHebrew for Judson,\u201d Flynn murmurs.\n\nAndrew takes them into the bayou to the wrecked pirate ship and last resting place of [[Jean Lafitte]]\u2014and the chalice. They are again overtaken by Kubichek and his men, with Lazlo in tow. They leave Flynn and Simone trapped on board. Simone is too weak to break free because she has not fed. Flynn uses a ship's [[cannon]] to blast down one of the doors. Once free, Simone steals Andre's boat, abandoning Flynn for his own good. Hurt but determined, he makes his way back to the mainland and finds Kubichek's hideout.\n\nSimone arrives at the same time, and they are captured. Kubichek performs the ceremony on Vlad Dracula's body amidst gusting wind and thunder\u2014with no result. Laughing, Professor Lazlo drinks from the chalice and is transformed. He is Vlad Dracula, the vampire who turned Simone. His handicap was not a lie. He was infected during a cholera outbreak. He has been feeding on  Kubichek's henchmen, turning them into a new army of vampires.\n\nKubichek and his remaining henchmen, Flynn, and Simone battle the vampires. Flynn follows Vlad outside to retrieve the chalice. Kubichek sends Simone after them and blows up the hideout with a grenade. Flynn literally runs into an aspen tree and tricks the overconfident Lazlo into coming close enough to be staked. He dies in a pillar of fire. At peace, Simone asks Flynn to help her watch one last sunrise. They kiss goodbye, and she gently dissolves in a drift of sparkles.\n\nFlynn remembers Simone's words about living with purpose and passion and returns to the Library to resume his duties. He gives Charlene the first marker on a cord. He starts to read the inscription but instead tells her that it says \"follow your dreams\"\u2014her advice to him. Where did your dream take you? she asks. Home, he replies.\n\nJudson will not admit to Flynn that he is the scholar/knight in Simone's painting, Yahuda. (In season 4 of ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|The Librarians]]'', it is clearly stated that Judson is indeed the founder of the Library.) Flynn accepts his destiny as part of the fight between good and evil without regrets. The camera pulls up to show the shape of the Tree of Knowledge seen in Simone's painting, built into the Library.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Noah Wyle]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Flynn Carsen (Noah Wyle)|Flynn Carsen]]\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Professor Lazlo (Bruce Davison)|Professor Lazlo / Vlad]]\n* [[Stana Katic]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Simone Renoir (Stana Katic)|Simone Renoir]]\n* [[Bob Newhart]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Judson (Bob Newhart)|Judson]]\n* [[Jane Curtin]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Charlene (Jane Curtin)|Charlene]]\n* [[Dikran Tulaine]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Sergei Kubichek (Dikran Tulaine)|Sergei Kubichek]]\n* [[Jason Douglas]] as Ivan\n* Beth Burvant as Katie\n* Werner Richmond as Andrew\n* Stephen David Calhoun as Nicolai\n\n==Reception==\n===Ratings===\nThe film averaged 5.44 million viewers over its two-hour run.<ref>{{cite web |date= 8 December 2008 |author= MATT MITOVICH |title= Ratings for Race Finale, Leverage Debut and More {{!}} TV Guide |url= https://www.tvguide.com/news/ratings-amazing-race-1000658/ |website= TVGuide.com }}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nAndrew L.
