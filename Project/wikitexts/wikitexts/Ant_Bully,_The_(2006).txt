Davis]] and based on the 1999 [[The Ant Bully|children's book of the same name]] by John Nickle. Starring the voices of [[Julia Roberts]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Regina King]], [[Bruce Campbell]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], it was produced by [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Gary Goetzman]]'s [[Playtone]], Davis and Keith Alcorn's [[DNA Productions]], and [[Legendary Entertainment|Legendary Pictures]] in their first animated film, and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].\n\nSet in suburban [[Las Vegas]], ''The Ant Bully'' follows Lucas Nickle, a 10-year-old destructive boy who is neglected by his family and bullied by Steve and his friends. He attacks the nearby ant colony out of frustration, but Zoc, a wizard ant, creates a potion to shrink Lucas. After being shrunk by Zoc, Lucas Nickle must join forces with his new friends to defeat Stan Beals, an exterminator who threatens their colony upon signing the contract. It was released on July 28, 2006.\n\nShortly before its release, most of the DNA employees were laid off and the studio was closed (as the result of their second and final film to be made after ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]''). It was also the last film role by [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], before his death on January 14, 2009. ''The Ant Bully'' received mixed reviews from critics, with praise aimed at the vocal performances, animation, and humor, but criticism for its dialogue and script, its lack of faithfulness to the source material and the execution of its premise. It was also a [[Box-office bomb|box-office disappointment]], grossing $55.2 million against its $50 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nLonely 10-year-old Lucas Nickle is left with his older sister, Tiffany, and his grandmother, when his parents go to [[Puerto Vallarta]]. Neglected by his family and tormented by a local bully named Steve and his friends, Lucas takes out his frustration on an [[anthill]] and attacks it with a squirt gun, terrifying the colony. One ant, Zoc, an eccentric [[Sorcerer (fantasy)|sorcerer]], tries to fight back. His girlfriend Hova, a nurse ant who is fascinated by humans, attempts to communicate with Lucas. He drops his gun on the grass, and kicks the anthill with one of his sneakers, sending the colony flying into the grass. Hova tries to communicate to him, but she is almost crushed before being saved by Zoc. The leaders of the colony decide to use a [[potion]] Zoc has recently created to shrink Lucas down to ant size.\n \nThe local [[pest control|exterminator]], Stan Beals, convinces Lucas to sign a contract to kill the vermin. Later that night, Zoc and a small troop of ants pour the potion into his ear; Lucas wakes up and discovers that he is shrunk, and naked and is carried to the anthill for the court. Zoc insists that he should be studied then eaten, but he is overruled by the Queen, who sentences him to [[penal labour|hard labor]]. Hova volunteers to train Lucas alongside her friends Kreela and Fugax, much to Zoc's mortification, and they both learn about the differences between ants and humans. The ants are later attacked by [[tarantula hawk]]s. Lucas finds a firecracker discarded by Steve and uses it to scare the wasps away. This earns him the admiration of all the ants except Zoc.\n\nLucas is shown a painting that depicts the Great Ant Mother and the exterminator, and is told that the Great Ant Mother will return and shower the ants with honeydew, while the Cloud-Breather will spell destruction for all of them. Lucas, Hova, Fugax, and Kreela return to his house, where Lucas tries to cancel Beals' contract, but accidentally calls a pizzeria instead. Tiffany then enters the kitchen, and attacks Lucas and company where it flees.\n\nWhen Zoc finds out that Lucas put Hova in possible danger, he accuses him of further treachery, and tells him that he refuses to give him the antidote, causing him to run away in fright. Hearing what happened, Hova gets angry with Zoc scolding him for banishing Lucas from the ant colony and even that he did not put them in danger. He helps them for getting the food and angrily lashed him out for been selfish and jealous of him, and goes out to look for Lucas included Kreela and Fugax leaving Zoc alone in the cave. Once she finds him, he is swallowed by a [[frog]]. Zoc witnesses the event and realizes what he done and how much Hova cares about Lucas, so he frees him to make up for his selfishness. Afterwards, they discuss their differences. Zoc explains that ants work for the benefit of the colony, whilst Lucas states that most humans work for personal gain. Zoc is unsure as to how anything gets accomplished in Lucas' world, but then sympathizes with him when they both admit that they both used to act without thinking.\n\nThe next day, when Beals arrives to exterminate the colony, Lucas and Zoc enlist the [[wasp]]s' aid; at first, the wasps want to eat them, but upon hearing that their hill is being destroyed by Beals, they agree to help. During the battle with Beals, Lucas saves the lives of Hova and an injured wasp. Both the ants and wasps are no match against [[pesticide]], but as Beals is about to exterminate the anthill, a [[beetle]] and [[glowworm]] that Zoc and Lucas met while trapped inside of the frog's stomach bite him in the groin. As he painfully doubles up, Lucas injects him with the shrinking potion, severely disfiguring Beals, and he retreats on a tricycle while being attacked by the wasps.\n\nThe Queen pronounces Lucas an ant in honor of his heroic actions, names him \"Rokai\", and Zoc gives him the antidote. He returns to normal size, reunites and reconciles with his mother, and finally stands up to Steve, whose friends choose to befriend Lucas after Steve insults them. Lucas then showers the colony with jelly beans as a parting gift. \n\n==Voice cast==\n<!--PER BILLING BLOCK ON HOME MEDIA-->\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Hova, a nurse ant and a mentor to Lucas Nickle\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Zoc, a wizard ant\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as The Queen Ant, leader of the Ant colony\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Stan Beals, a local exterminator\n* [[Zach Tyler Eisen]] as Lucas Nickle, a 10-year-old boy who is always bullied\n* [[Regina King]] as Kreela, a forager ant\n* [[Bruce Campbell]] as Fugax, a scout ant\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Mommo, Lucas' grandmother\n* [[Cheri Oteri]] as Doreen Nickle, Lucas' mother\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Fred Nickle, Lucas' father\n* [[Allison Mack]] as Tiffany Nickle, Lucas' older sister\n* [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]] as The Head of Council\n* Myles Jeffrey as Steve, the local neighborhood bully\n* [[Jake T.

He then sent a copy to [[John A. Davis]] due to Davis' work on the computer-animated film ''Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius''.<ref>Comingsoon.net, [https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15686], Hanks and Davis on the Ant Bully, July 27, 2006</ref> Davis came up with a potential take on the story within a few days. \"To be honest, when I first looked at it, I thought Oh, why does it have to be ants again?\" said Davis. \"But the more I thought about it, I said, So what? It's got as much to do with ''The Incredible Shrinking Man'' as it does the other bug movies. It's a completely different story.\"<ref>Jenny Donelan, Computer Graphics World, September 2002, Volume 29 Number 9, pages 24&ndash;26</ref>\n\nHanks agreed that the story could be expanded considerably (the original book being around only 2,000 words). Keith Alcorn had a similar initial reaction to the project as Davis did. \"My first thought,\" recalled Alcorn, \"was, 'not another ant movie.' But looking at the actual story, this was really about a little boy and how he learns about the world by having to live beneath the surface.\"<ref>John Cawley, Animation World Magazine, [http://mag.awn.com/index.php?article_no=2956], July 28, 2006</ref> Davis states that he felt like something of a hypocrite when, while he was working on the script, carpenter ants infested his house and he called an exterminator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movingpicturesmagazine.com/features/themedarticle/johnadavis_antbully |title=John A.

The others continued to run the 3D version of ''[[Superman Returns]]''. The special IMAX 3D version was remastered in three dimensions with IMAX DMR. Critics within the 3D motion-picture community have given the film high marks, as unlike ''Superman Returns'', the entire film is projected in 3D stereo. The process to turn a pure animation film into 3D is much simpler than converting a film having live actors. Some of the production took place at [[C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures]] in [[Canada]].\n\n==Release==\nThe film was theatrically released on July 28, 2006 by Warner Bros.
