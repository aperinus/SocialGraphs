The film follows Elizabeth as she is haunted by Fred in adulthood.\n\n==Plot==\nUnassertive and repressed Minneapolis [[court reporter]] Elizabeth Cronin visits her husband Charles, from whom she is separated, on her lunch break, hoping to sort out their problems. He reasserts his desire for a divorce and says that he is in love with another woman, named Annabella.\n\nWhile she is at a public phone, first a man breaks into her car to steal her purse, and another steals the car itself. Forced to run back to work at the courthouse, she arrives late and gets fired. As she leaves the courthouse, she runs into childhood friend Mickey Bunce, who brings up memories they shared, including those of Elizabeth's imaginary friend, Drop Dead Fred. Mickey reminds her how everybody else thought she was crazy. A series of flashbacks show that though he caused havoc, he also gave her happiness and a release from her oppressive and emotionally abusive mother, Polly.\n\nAfter a pep talk from her friend Janie, Elizabeth moves back in with her mother, who is unsympathetic and blames her for her divorce. Her mother gives her a makeover in an attempt to win Charles back, styling Elizabeth exactly like her. She finds a taped-shut jack-in-the-box, and removes the tape, releasing Fred. He is confused that Elizabeth is now grown up, but proceeds to wreak havoc just as he did when she was a child. Eventually, Fred reveals that he can't leave until Elizabeth is happy again, so he agrees to help her win back her husband. However, his childish antics do more harm than good. He sinks Janie's houseboat, causes havoc at a restaurant, tricks her into assaulting a violinist in a shopping mall, rips the uniform off a waiter at a wine tasting event, and in general embarrasses Elizabeth and makes her look insane.\n\nWorried by Elizabeth's recent odd behavior, Polly takes her to a (children's) psychologist. In the waiting room, Fred is reunited with his friends: the imaginary friends of other patients, who are all children. The doctor prescribes medication to rid her of Fred, whom he and Polly believe is a figment of her imagination. The medication also has the effect of slowly killing Fred.\n\nFred reminds Elizabeth that one day, while they were making a mess on the dinner table, she heard her mother coming and she imagined him hiding in a [[jack-in-the-box]]. Polly, fed up with Elizabeth playing with Fred, took the jack-in-the-box and taped it shut, essentially taking Fred away from her and causing her father, Nigel, to leave the family in anger. The event left Elizabeth traumatized. Fred shows her a letter she wrote to him not long after, promising they'd run away together if he ever came back. Elizabeth and Fred run away from Polly's and go to Charles' party, where Fred causes more havoc.\n\nCharles asks Elizabeth to come back and she is overjoyed until Fred discovers he is still cheating with Annabella. Heartbroken, she tells Fred that she cannot leave Charles because she is scared of being alone. Fred helps her escape to a dream world in which she is able to reject Charles and stand up to Polly, declaring she is no longer afraid of her. She frees her imprisoned childhood self. Fred tells her that she no longer needs him, so they kiss and he disappears.\n\nUpon awakening, Elizabeth dumps Charles and stands up to Polly. Polly begs Elizabeth not to leave her alone and Elizabeth encourages her to find a friend to escape her own loneliness. She goes on a walk with her friend Janie, who reveals that due to an unexpected set of loopholes in her houseboat insurance, she has received a payout that will make her wealthy. After revealing the news to Elizabeth, she gleefly shouts \"Thank you Drop Dead Fred!\", as this wouldnt have been possible with the boat disaster earlier in the film. Elizabeth later visits Mickey, who has embraced spontaneity after coming into contact with Elizabeth and Fred. Mickey tells Elizabeth that he would like to be \"one of the options\" she has now that she's free of Charles & her mother, to which she says \"Okay\" enthusiastically. His daughter Natalie's nanny quits, claiming she is too wild, and Natalie blames Drop Dead Fred for the mischief. Elizabeth realizes Fred is now with Natalie, although she cannot see him anymore. She tells Natalie she believes Fred is real and to give him her love. The nanny attempts to leave the front yard, but her leg is caught in a rope pulley trap set by Natalie and Fred, with her hanging upside down from the tree shouting for help as Mickey attempts to help her down. Natalie is seen giggling hysterically with her hand held out like she's got her pinky held by Fred in a pinky swear type gesture.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Phoebe Cates]] as Elizabeth Cronin\n** [[Ashley Peldon]] as Young Elizabeth \n* [[Rik Mayall]] as Drop Dead Fred\n* [[Marsha Mason]] as Polly Cronin\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as Michael \"Mickey\" Bunce\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as Janie\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Charles Gretterson\n* [[Daniel Gerroll]] as Nigel Cronin\n* [[Keith Charles (actor)|Keith Charles]] as Murray\n* Cheryl Hawker as Nurse\n* Peter Breitmayer as Go to Hell Herman\n* Clark Niederjohn as Velcro Head\n* Tom Bethke as Graggy\n* Elizabeth Gray as Namby Pamby\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Annabella (uncredited)\n* [[Eleanor Mondale]] as Attractive customer\n* Bob Reid as Judge Dubben\n* Peter Thoemke as Arsonist\n\n==Production==\n[[Tim Burton]] and [[Robin Williams]] were offered the role of director and Fred respectively.
