Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\nIn order to cast the world into eternal night, the Lord of Darkness sends the [[goblin]] Blix to kill the [[unicorn]]s in the forest near his castle and bring him [[Unicorn horn|their horns]]. Told by Darkness that the best bait is Innocence, Blix and his colleagues Pox and Blunder follow Princess Lili as she visits her forest-dwelling paramour, [[Jack in the Green]]. There Jack teaches Lili to speak to animals, then takes her blindfolded to a forest stream where he senses the unicorns will appear. When Lili holds out her hand to touch the [[stallion]], Blix shoots him with a poison dart from his [[Blowgun|blowpipe]] and the unicorns flee. Jack is angry, but Lili laughs off his concern and issues a challenge by throwing her ring into a pond, declaring she will marry whomever finds it. While Jack dives in after the ring, the goblins track down the poisoned stallion and sever his alicorn, causing winter to descend. Lili runs off in terror, and Jack is barely able to break through the surface of the now-frozen pond.\n\nLili takes refuge in the cottage of a peasant family that is now frozen in time. While there, Lili sees the goblins test the alicorn's magic powers and overhears how she was the bait in their slaying of the stallion. She follows the goblins to a rendezvous with Darkness, who tells them the world cannot be cast into eternal night as long as the surviving [[mare]] still lives. Blunder unsuccessfully tries using the alicorn to overthrow Darkness and is sent into the castle's dungeon. Meanwhile, Jack, accompanied by the [[elf|forest elf]] Honeythorn Gump, the [[fairy]] Oona, and the [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]] Brown Tom and Screwball, finds the mare mourning the lifeless stallion. Lamenting over his role in their current predicament, Jack apologizes to the mare, who communicates to him that the alicorn must be recovered and returned to the stallion by a great hero. Deciding Jack is that hero, the group leaves Brown Tom to guard the unicorns while Jack and the others retrieve a hidden cache of ancient weapons and armor. In their absence, Lili warns Brown Tom of the goblins coming back to kill the mare. He is then incapacitated by the goblins, who capture both Lili and the mare.\n\nUpon returning, Jack and his group make their way to Darkness' castle. On the way, they are attacked by a swamp [[hag]] named Meg Mucklebones, but Jack defeats her by flattering her appearance and then decapitating her. At the castle, Jack's group falls into an underground prison cell, where they encounter Blunder, who is revealed to be a fairy gone astray, before he is dragged off by an ogre to be baked into a pie. Oona uses her magic to escape their cell and retrieves the keys to free the others.\n\nMeanwhile, as Lili roams the castle seeking warmth and escape, a dark, dancing entity appears to tempt and turn her into a gothic version of herself. Darkness orchestrated this to claim her as his bride, and seemingly seduced, she agrees to wed him on condition that she will be the one to kill the mare in the upcoming ritual. Overhearing their conversation, Jack and Gump learn Darkness can be destroyed by daylight. After saving Blunder, the group takes the ogres' giant metal platters as makeshift mirrors to reflect sunlight into the chamber where the mare is to be sacrificed.\n\nAs the ritual begins, Lili tries to free the mare, but Darkness casts onto her a spell of sleep. Jack's group redirects the setting sun with the platters as he fights Darkness, finally wounding him with the stallion's alicorn right before the redirected sunlight shines into the room, blasting Darkness to the edge of the eternal void. Darkness warns them that because evil lurks in all beings, he will never truly be vanquished. Wavering in doubt, Jack finally severs the hands of Darkness, thus expelling him into the void. Gump then returns the stallion to life by magically reattaching its alicorn. With the stallion reunited with the mare, winter suddenly ends. Jack retrieves Lili's ring from the pond and places it on her finger, waking her from the spell. \n\n===Alternate endings===\nThere are three different versions of the film's conclusion:\n* In the Director's Cut, Lili wakes with Jack trying to convince her she was merely dreaming, but she is ultimately unconvinced. They confess their true love for each other, but realize they live in two different lifestyles, which causes Lili to request continuing a merely platonic relationship. Jack, happy with this request for the first time, accepts. Lili returns to her home to assume her responsibilities, promising to visit him again. Jack happily runs off into the sunset, hailed by the forest fairies and the revived unicorns.\n* In the American theatrical version, Jack and Lili assure each other of their love and watch the unicorns reunite, and they run off into the sunset together, hailed by the forest fairies and the unicorns. Darkness watches them from the void, laughing.<ref>[http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=5828765 Movie Censorship.com: ''Legend Comparison: Theatrical Version -- Director's Cut''].

Frustrated, he came back to the idea of filming a fairy tale or mythological story.\n\nFor inspiration, Scott read all the classic fairy tales, including ones by the [[Brothers Grimm]].<ref name=\"Jones\"/> From that, he conceived a story about a young hermit who is transformed into a hero when he battles the Darkness in order to rescue a beautiful princess and release the world from a wintery curse.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\">{{cite news|title=''Legend'' Production Notes |publisher=[[Universal Pictures]] |year=1985 }}</ref>\n\n===Screenplay===\nScott wanted ''Legend'' to have an original screenplay because he believed that \"it was far easier to design a story to fit the medium of cinema than bend the medium for an established story\".<ref name=\"Jones\"/> By chance, he discovered several books written by American novelist [[William Hjortsberg]], and found that the writer had already written several scripts for some unmade lower-budgeted films. Scott asked him if he was interested in writing a fairy tale. He was already writing some and agreed.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> Scott remembers, \"The first notion was to actually make a classical fairy story, but if you actually analyze a classical fairy story, most are either very short, or very complex\".<ref name=\"Pirani\">{{cite news|last=Pirani |first=Adam |title=Ridley Scott: SF's Visual Magician |publisher=[[Starlog]] |page=64 |date=December 1985 }}</ref> The two men bonded over [[Jean Cocteau]]'s 1946 film of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. In January 1981, just before beginning principal photography on ''[[Blade Runner]]'', Scott spent five weeks with Hjortsberg working out a rough storyline for what was then called ''Legend of Darkness''.\n\nOriginally, Scott \"only had the vague notion of something in pursuit of the swiftest steed alive which, of course, was the unicorn\".<ref name=\"Jones\"/> Scott felt that they should have a quest and wanted unicorns as well as magic armor and a sword. Hjortsberg suggested plunging the world into wintery darkness.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> Hjortsberg's first draft of ''Legend of Darkness'' also had Princess Lili slowly transform into a clawed and fur-covered beast who is whipped and sexually seduced by the antagonist (called Baron Couer De Noir in this draft).<ref>{{cite web|title=Original LEGEND OF DARKNESS script - First Draft|url=http://www.figmentfly.com/legend/script3a.html|work=LEGEND frequently asked questions|access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://emulsionalproblems.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-legend-of-william-hjortsberg.html|title=Emulsional Problems: The Legend of William Hjortsberg|first=Michael|last=Dare|date=June 6, 2015|website=emulsionalproblems.blogspot.com|access-date=March 12, 2019}}</ref> Scott wanted to show the outside world as little as possible and they settled on the clockmaker's cottage.\n\nInitially, the quest was longer, but it was eventually substantially reduced. Scott wanted to avoid too many subplots that departed from the main story and go for a \"more contemporary movement rather than get bogged down in too classical a format\".<ref name=\"Jones\"/> By the time Scott had finished ''Blade Runner'', he and Hjortsberg had a script that was \"lengthy, hugely expensive, and impractical in its size and scope\".<ref name=\"Pirani\"/> They went through it and took out large sections that were secondary to the story. The two men went through 15 script revisions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Legend Making by William Hjortsberg|url=http://www.figmentfly.com/legend/script2.html|work=LEGEND frequently asked questions|access-date=May 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe look Scott envisioned for ''Legend'' was influenced by the style of [[Disney]] animation. He had even offered the project to Disney, but they were intimidated by the film's dark tone at a time when Disney still focused on family-friendly material.<ref name=\"Jones\"/> Visually, Scott referenced films like ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''. The look of ''Legend'' was also influenced by the art of [[Arthur Rackham]] and [[Heath Robinson]].<ref name=\"Jones2\">Jones 1986, p.

However, Scott eventually replaced Lee with [[Assheton Gorton]], a production designer whom he had wanted for both ''[[Alien (1979 film)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Blade Runner]]''. Scott hired Gorton because he knew \"all the pitfalls of shooting exteriors on a soundstage. We both knew that whatever we did would never look absolutely real, but would very quickly gain its own reality and dispense with any feeling of theatricality\".<ref name=\"Jones2\"/>\n\nScott also consulted with effects expert [[Richard Edlund]] because the director did not want to limit major character roles to the number of smaller people who could act.<ref name=\"Jones2\"/> At one point, the director considered [[Mickey Rooney]] to play one of the major characters but he did not look small enough next to Tom Cruise. Edlund considered shooting on [[70 mm]] film stock, taking the negative, and reducing the actors to any size they wanted\u2014but this was deemed too expensive. Thus, Scott was tasked with finding an ensemble of small actors.<ref name=\"Jones2\"/> ''Legend'' would be financed with a budget of $24.5 million,<ref name=\"Jones\"/> and would be distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] in North America and by [[20th Century Fox]] in all other territories.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Battle of Brazil|last=Mathews|first=Jack|publisher=Applause|year=1998|isbn=1-55783-347-8|location=New York|pages=82|edition=revised}}</ref>\n[[File:In the Land of the Giants (7975508659).jpg|thumb|Scott was inspired by the [[Sequoioideae|Sequoias]] of [[Yosemite National Park]]]]\nIn order to achieve the look of ''Legend'' that he wanted, Scott scouted locations in the [[Sequoioideae|Sequoias]] of [[Yosemite National Park]] to see the grand scale of trees there. \"The whole environment is so stunning ... It was so impressive, but I didn't know how you would control it\".<ref name=\"Pirani\"/> However, it would cost too much to shoot on location and he decided to build a forest set on the [[007 Stage]], named after and used for many [[James Bond]] films, at [[Pinewood Studios]]. The crew spent 14 weeks constructing the forest set, and Scott was worried that it would not look real enough. It was only days before the start of principal photography that it looked good enough to film. The trees were 60 feet high with trunks 30 feet in diameter and were sculpted out of polystyrene built onto tubular scaffolding frames.<ref name=\"Pirani\"/> In addition, other sets were constructed on five huge soundstages.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Johnny Depp]], [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] were considered for the role of Jack. While Scott was considering [[Richard O'Brien]] to play Meg Mucklebones, he watched ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' and saw Tim Curry. He thought the actor would be ideal to play Darkness because the actor had film and theatrical experience. Tim Curry's makeup as Darkness in ''Legend'' is considered to be one of the most iconic images in all of fantasy cinema.<ref>Monfette, Christopher (May 12, 2009). \"[http://movies.ign.com/articles/981/981717p1.html Top 10 Angels and Demons].\" ''IGN.com''.

The process would involve complicated prosthetic makeup that would be worn for up to 60 days with some full body prosthetics.<ref name=\"Biodrowski\"/> According to Bottin, at the time, ''Legend'' had the largest makeup crew ever dedicated to one project. Bottin divided his facility into different shops in order to cover the immense workload. As actors were cast, Bottin and his crew began making life casts and designed characters on drafting paper laid over sketches of the actors' faces.<ref name=\"Biodrowski\"/> He designed the prosthetics in his Los Angeles studio and spent some time in England occasionally helping with the application of makeup.<ref name=\"Pirani2\">Pirani December 1985, p. 65</ref>\n[[File:DarknessLegendmakeup.jpg|thumb|Curry's makeup for the film took five and a half hours to apply.]]\nWith the exception of Cruise and Sara, all the principal actors spent hours every morning having extensive makeup applied.<ref name=\"Jones2\"/> Between 8 and 12 prosthetic pieces were applied individually to each face, then made up, molded and grafted into the actor's face so that the prosthetics moved with their muscles.<ref name=\"Pirani2\"/> Each person needed three makeup artists working on them for an average time of three and a half hours spent applying prosthetics. Actor Tim Curry took five and a half hours because his entire body was encased in makeup,<ref name=\"Jones2\"/> the film's most challenging character design.<ref name=\"Biodrowski2\">Biodrowski 1986, p. 26</ref>\n\nCurry had to wear a large, bull-like structure atop his head with three-foot fiberglass horns supported by a harness underneath the makeup.<ref name=\"Biodrowski3\">Biodrowski 1986, p. 57</ref> The initial design of the horns placed a strain on the back of the actor's neck because they extended forward and not straight up but Bottin and his crew eventually reduced the weight of the horns.<ref name=\"Biodrowski3\"/> At the end of the day, he spent an hour in a bath in order to liquefy the soluble [[spirit gum]]. At one point, Curry became claustrophobic, got too impatient, and pulled the makeup off too quickly, tearing off his own skin in the process. Scott had to shoot around the actor for a week as a result.<ref name=\"Jones2\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 26, 1984 on the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios.<ref name=\"Jones\"/> On June 27, 1984, with ten days filming left on this stage, the entire set burned down during a lunch break. Reportedly, flames from the set fire leapt more than 100 feet into the air and the clouds of smoke could be seen five miles away.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> It occurred during lunchtime, and no one was hurt.<ref name=\"Pirani\"/> Scott quickly made changes to the shooting schedule and only lost three days moving to another soundstage.<ref name=\"Jones2\"/> Meanwhile, the art department rebuilt the section of the forest set that was needed to complete filming.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\"/> Due to the fire, the scenes of Lili meeting the unicorns for the first time and finding the cottages in the snow were filmed in the garden of the main house behind [[Shepperton Studios]].<ref>''Ridley Scott DVD Commentary for'' \"Legend: Ultimate Edition\", Disc 2, Universal Studios Home Video, 2002.</ref> The underwater scenes were filmed in [[Silver Springs, Florida]] for the \"purity\" of the water. Cruise did all his own diving and swimming in waters that, according to Scott, had real [[alligators]] 25 feet from where they were filming.\n\n===Post-production===\nScott's first cut of ''Legend'' ran 125 minutes long.<ref name=\"Jones3\">Jones 1986, p. [https://archive.org/details/cinefantastique_1970-2002/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2015%20No%205%20%28Jan%201986%29/page/n26/mode/2up 27].</ref> He then believed there were minor plot points that could be trimmed and cut the film down to 113 minutes, so he tested this version for an audience in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. However, it was decided that the audience had to work too much to be entertained, and another 20 minutes was cut.<ref name=\"Jones3\"/> The 95-minute version was shown in [[Great Britain]] and then the film was cut down even further to 89 minutes for North America.\n\nAt the time, Scott said, \"European audiences are more sophisticated. They accepted preambles and subtleties whereas the U.S. goes for a much broader stroke.\"<ref name=\"Jones3\"/> He and Universal delayed the North American theatrical release until 1986 so that they could replace [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s score with music by [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]] lead singer [[Jon Anderson]], and [[Bryan Ferry]].<ref name=\"Jones\"/>\n\nScott allowed Goldsmith's score to remain on European prints and the composer said, \"that this dreamy, bucolic setting is suddenly to be scored by a [[techno-pop]] group seems sort of strange to me\".<ref name=\"Harrington\">{{cite news|last=Harrington |first=Richard |title=The Saga of the Sound Tracks |work=[[Washington Post]] |page=K1 |date=January 12, 1986 }}</ref> Normally, Goldsmith would spend 6\u201310 weeks on a film score, but for ''Legend'', he spent six months writing songs and dance sequences ahead of time.<ref name=\"Harrington\"/>\n\nIn 2000, Universal unearthed an [[answer print]] of the 113-minute preview cut with Jerry Goldsmith's score. This print had minor visual anomalies that were eventually digitally replaced, occasionally with finished shots from the 89-minute U.S. version. This edition is Scott's preferred 2002 \"Director's Cut\", with the restored Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack.

Ebert also said that the movie was composed of all of the right ingredients to be successful, but that the film simply \"doesn't work\". He went on to say that \"[a]ll of the special effects in the world, and all of the great makeup, and all of the great [[Muppet]] creatures can't save a movie that has no clear idea of its own mission and no joy in its own accomplishment\".

[[Legend (Jerry Goldsmith score)|The first]], produced, composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], was used for its initial European release and restored in the director's cut edition of the [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVD release. [[Legend (Tangerine Dream soundtrack)|The second soundtrack]] features music by German electronic artists [[Tangerine Dream]] and was used for the initial theatrical and home video releases in the United States. This soundtrack also includes songs by [[Jon Anderson]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Bryan Ferry]] of [[Roxy Music]].\n\nThe following songs are featured in the European and Director's Cuts, with lyrics composed by [[John Bettis]] (composer of many [[The Carpenters|Carpenters]] songs) and music by [[Jerry Goldsmith]]:\n* \"My True Love's Eyes\" (the main theme, sung mostly by Lili. Mia Sara provided some of the singing, while session singers provided vocals wherever Sara was unable to perform).\n* \"Living River\" (the first reprise of \"My True Love's Eyes\", sung as Lili calls to the unicorn).\n* \"Bumps and Hollows\" (sung by Lili after her forbidden act of touching a unicorn).\n* \"Sing The Wee\" (the theme for the fairies. The first sung version was cut from all editions of the film as it accompanied a scene with Jack and the fairies that was itself cut; the final sung version by the National Philharmonic Chorus is heard over the end credits).\n* \"Reunited\" (the final reprise of \"My True Love's Eyes\", sung by Lili as she says goodbye to Jack).\n\nThe following songs appeared in the 89-minute U.S. re-cut when it was re-scored by Tangerine Dream:\n* \"Loved by the Sun\" (music by [[Tangerine Dream]], lyrics written and sung by [[Jon Anderson]]).\n* \"Is Your Love Strong Enough\" (written and performed by [[Bryan Ferry]] over the U.S. print's end credits).\n\nA promotional [[music video]] (presumably for the U.S. market, where the Tangerine Dream soundtrack was used) was created for the [[Bryan Ferry]] song \"Is Your Love Strong Enough\". The video, which incorporates Ferry and guitarist [[David Gilmour]] into footage from the film, is included as a bonus on disc 2 of the 2002 \"Ultimate Edition\" DVD release.\n\n==Home media==\n\nIn 2002, Universal released the 113-minute Director's Cut on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]], restoring previously cut scenes and the original Goldsmith score.<ref name=\"Inside DVD\">{{cite journal |last=Hunt |first=Bill |date=December 2000 |title=Inside DVD: Fact Or Rumor |journal=Widescreen Review |volume=9 |issue=44 |pages=106\u2013111 |quote=The Director's Cut was a nightmare to track down.
