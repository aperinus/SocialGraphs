It follows a recently separated man who seeks to rediscover his manhood and is taught how to pick up women at bars.\n\nThe film was released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on July 29, 2011, grossing over $142 million against its $50 million budget and was well-received by critics. Gosling was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for his performance.\n\n== Plot ==\nCal Weaver is a [[Middle age|middle-aged]] man whose wife Emily asks for a [[divorce]] after she reveals an affair she had with co-worker David Lindhagen. After moving into his own apartment, Cal begins frequenting an upscale [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], talking loudly about his divorce, until he attracts the attention of a young man named Jacob Palmer. Jacob, a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]] who beds different women each night, was recently rejected by a woman named Hannah. Jacob takes pity on Cal and offers to teach him how to pick up women. After a few awkward attempts to talk to women, Cal [[seduce]]s Kate at the bar. This experience gives Cal the confidence to approach other women, and Cal begins to emulate Jacob's example successfully.\n\nEventually, Cal and Emily reunite at their 13-year-old son Robbie's [[parent-teacher conference]], where Emily is impressed by Cal's newfound confidence and fitted clothes. Their reunion goes well until Robbie's teacher is revealed as Kate, who shares with Emily that she and Cal have had sex. Cal inadvertently confesses to having sex with nine women since their separation and Emily leaves in disgust. Meanwhile, Hannah, a recent [[law school]] graduate, is offended by her boyfriend as he offered her a position as a permanent [[lawyer]] instead of [[Marriage proposal|proposing to her]]. She returns to the bar where she originally rejected Jacob's advances, finds him, and asks if he still wants to take her home. Jacob takes her back to his luxurious home, but instead of becoming physically intimate, they spend the night talking and laughing until they both fall asleep.\n\nCal and Emily's son Robbie makes numerous grand gestures to try to win the heart of Jessica Riley, his 17-year-old [[babysitter]], who [[Chronophilia#Sexual preferences based on age|has a crush on Cal]]. At the advice of a classmate, Jessica takes nude photos of herself, intending to send them to Cal. Emily calls Cal under the guise of needing help with the house's [[pilot light]], but Cal sees through the ruse. Realizing that she called just because she missed him, Cal decides to win her back. Jacob returns Cal's calls and asks for advice about being in a real relationship and meeting his girlfriend's parents. Jessica's mother discovers the naked photos and Jessica's father, Bernie, rushes to the Weaver residence to confront him about the photos, with Jessica in pursuit. Cal and his kids create a makeshift [[mini golf]] set in their backyard to remind Emily of their first date. During the gathering, Jacob and Hannah show up at the house, and Hannah is revealed to be Cal and Emily's first daughter born to them right out of high school. Cal is appalled that Jacob is dating his daughter, and forbids her from seeing him. Bernie shows up and attacks Cal. Jessica arrives and tells her father that Cal knew nothing of the pictures. David arrives on the scene to return Emily's sweater from a previous date. When Jacob identifies him, he punches David in the face for the pain he caused Cal. Cal, Jacob, David, and Bernie then get into a [[scuffle]] which is soon broken up by the police. Cal starts spending time at the bar again and receives a visit from Jacob, who confesses that he is in love and has begun to re-evaluate his life as a result. Cal replies that he is happy that Jacob is a changed man but does not approve of Jacob and Hannah's relationship, having seen Jacob's former lifestyle. Jacob resigns without harboring any ill feelings; rather, he expresses his respect for Cal and praises him for being a great father.\n\nAt Robbie's eighth grade graduation, Robbie is the [[salutatorian]] and gives a [[pessimistic]] speech about how he no longer believes in [[Romance (love)|true love]] and [[soulmate]]s. Cal stops him, and instead begins to recount his courtship with Emily to the audience, saying that, while he does not know if things will work out, he will never give up on Emily. With renewed faith, Robbie reaffirms his love for Jessica, to the audience's applause. After the ceremony, Cal gives Jacob and Hannah his blessing. Jessica gives Robbie an envelope containing the nude photos of herself that were originally intended for Cal to \"get him through high school.\" Cal and Emily have a laugh talking about the events that have transpired the past year, and watching them from afar, Robbie smiles [[Optimism|optimistically]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Cal Weaver\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Jacob Palmer\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Emily Weaver\n* [[Emma Stone]] as Hannah Weaver\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Kate Tafferty\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as David Lindhagen\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as Bernie Riley\n* [[Josh Groban]] as Richard\n* [[Lio Tipton|Analeigh Tipton]] as Jessica Riley<!--- per [[Template:Infobox_film/doc#Credits]] \u2013 \"credited by the name they were using professionally at the time the film was made\" --->{{Explanatory footnote|name=Lio|Credited as Analeigh Tipton.
