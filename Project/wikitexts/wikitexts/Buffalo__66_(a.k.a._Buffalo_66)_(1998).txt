The plot revolves around Billy Brown (Gallo), a man who kidnaps a young tap dancer named Layla (Ricci) and forces her to pretend to be his wife to impress his parents (Gazzara and Huston) after he gets released from prison.\n\nThe film was generally well-received; ''[[Empire Magazine|Empire]]'' listed it as the 36th-greatest [[independent film]] ever made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/independentfilms.html |title=50 Greatest Independent Films From Empire |publisher=Filmsite.org |access-date=2010-10-19}}</ref> It was filmed in and around Gallo's hometown of [[Buffalo, New York]], in winter. The film uses British [[progressive rock]] music in its soundtrack, notably [[King Crimson]] and [[Yes (band)|Yes]].\n\nThe title refers to the [[Buffalo Bills]] [[American football]] team, who had not won a championship since the [[1965 American Football League Championship Game]] (which was actually played on December 28, 1965). The plot involves indirect references to the Bills' narrow loss to the [[New York Giants]] in [[Super Bowl XXV]], which was decided by a missed [[field goal]].\n\n==Plot==\nHaving just served five years in [[Gowanda Correctional Facility|prison]], Billy Brown ([[Vincent Gallo]]) returns home to [[Buffalo, New York]], and is preparing to meet with his parents, who don't know he's been in prison. He kidnaps Layla ([[Christina Ricci]]), a tap dancer, and forces her to pretend to be his wife to his parents. He gives her the name \"Wendy Balsam\".\n\nWhen they meet with Billy's parents ([[Ben Gazzara]] and [[Anjelica Huston]]), Layla sees that the relationship between them is very dysfunctional, and sees Billy's own mother forgetting he has a chocolate allergy and his father behaves inappropriately towards her. She finds out that Billy's mother has never missed a Buffalo Bills game, except in 1966, on the day Billy was born. In a flashback it is revealed that Billy once placed a reckless $10,000 bet on the Bills to win Super Bowl XXV; when they lost, the bookie ([[Mickey Rourke]]) forced Billy to clear his debt by confessing to a crime he didn't commit, resulting in his time served in prison. Now Billy seeks revenge on Scott Wood, the kicker who lost the game. (This is a reference to [[Buffalo Bills]] kicker [[Scott Norwood]], who missed [[Wide Right (Buffalo Bills)|the potential game-winning field goal]] in [[Super Bowl XXV]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/americansports/osm/story/0,,1982103,00.html |title=It's Super Bowl loser Norwood's unlucky number. Here's why... |author=Gary Imlach |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2007-01-07}}</ref>)\n\nAs they leave his parents' house, Billy scolds Layla for telling an obvious lie to his father, and then decides to go bowling. Here Billy shows off his expertise at the sport, and Layla gives a [[tap dance]] routine to [[King Crimson]]'s 'Moonchild'. The two use a [[photo booth]] to take photos \"spanning time\" which Billy intends to send to his parents once a year, but Billy becomes annoyed when Layla makes silly faces during the photos, in contrast to Billy's straight face.\n\nAfter bowling, Billy and Layla visit a diner, where Billy encounters the real Wendy Balsam ([[Rosanna Arquette]]), a girl he used to have a crush on in middle school, who is now happily in a relationship with another man. Billy leaves Layla alone in the diner after a brief argument, but regretting his outburst, returns and apologizes to her. Billy and Layla check into a motel, where Billy and Layla have a deep conversation, and eventually admit that they have fallen in love with each other, and they both go to sleep.\n\nA few hours after midnight, he is about to leave to exact his revenge on Wood, when Layla awakens. Despite Layla's doubts that he'll return and proclamation of her love for him, he leaves, lying to her that he'll return in a few minutes with hot chocolate for her.\n\nShortly after leaving Layla at the motel, Billy finds Scott Wood, now the owner of a [[strip club|topless bar]]. At Wood's own bar, he walks over to Wood's table and shoots him in the head, before shooting himself. His parents are then shown sitting by his grave with his mother showing more interest in a Buffalo game on the radio than in her own son's death. However, this is all shown to be inside of Billy's mind. Billy leaves the bar without killing Wood, realizing that in Layla he's finally found a person who truly loves him. After making amends with his friend Goon ([[Kevin Corrigan]]) on a payphone, the film ends with Billy elatedly buying Layla her hot chocolate and a heart-shaped cookie, and buying another for a man sitting nearby who tells him he has a girlfriend, before returning to Layla at the motel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Vincent Gallo]] as Billy Brown\n* John Sansone as young Billy Brown\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Layla\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Jan Brown\n* [[Ben Gazzara]] as Jimmy Brown\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Goon/Rocky\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as The Bookie\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Wendy Balsam\n* [[Jan-Michael Vincent]] as Sonny\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] and [[Alex Karras]] as TV sportcasters\n* John Rummel as Don Shanks\n* Bob Wahl as Scott Wood\n* Penny Wolfgang as The Judge\n* Carl Marchi as Cafe Owner\n* Michael Maciejewski as Guy in Bathroom\n}}\n\n==Production==\nGallo had difficulties working with his cast and crew, and reportedly did not get along with Ricci on set.
