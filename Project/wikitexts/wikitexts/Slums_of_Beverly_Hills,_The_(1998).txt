The story follows a teenage girl (Lyonne) struggling to grow up in 1976 in a lower-middle-class nomadic Jewish family that relocates every few months.\n\nThe film received mixed to positive critical reviews, and has gradually become a [[Cult film|cult classic]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Feil |first=Chris |date=October 4, 2018 |title=\"Slums of Beverly Hills\" Revisited |url=http://thefilmexperience.net/blog/2018/10/4/slums-of-beverly-hills-revisited.html |access-date=2022-10-18 |website=The Film Experience |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Winning|first=Josh|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-evolution-of-marisa-tomei/slums-of-beverly-hills-1998|title=The Evolution Of Marisa Tomei|work=[[Total Film]]|date=March 18, 2011|access-date=October 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321201938/http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-evolution-of-marisa-tomei/slums-of-beverly-hills-1998|archive-date=March 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nFourteen-year-old Vivian Abromowitz's family are penniless nomads, moving from one cheap apartment to another in [[Beverly Hills]] in 1976, so that Vivian and her brothers can attend the city's prestigious [[Beverly Hills Unified School District|local schools]]. Their father, Murray, is a divorced 65-year-old who refuses to retire, working as an unsuccessful [[Oldsmobile]] salesman whose cars are selling poorly due in large part to the [[1970s energy crisis|energy crisis]] of the time.\n\nVivian's wealthy uncle Mickey regularly sends the family money to help them survive. When Mickey's 29-year-old daughter Rita escapes from a rehab facility, Murray offers her shelter if Mickey will pay for a plush apartment. Vivian must babysit her adult cousin, ensuring that she attends nursing school and avoids pills and alcohol. However, Vivian has her own problems: she is curious about sex, likes an apparently twenty-something neighbor, Eliot, has inherited her mother's ample breasts, and wants a family that does not embarrass her.\n\nVivian's older brother Ben aspires to a show business career, while her father aspires to female companionship but would not give in to wealthy lady-friend Doris Zimmerman's desire that he send his kids back East to live with his ex-wife. Vivian's younger brother Rickey simply aspires to obtain attention.\n\nVivian and Rita are close and sometimes speak in [[Gibberish (language game)|gibberish]], or [[Pig Latin]]. Vivian learns that Rita has no wish to attend nursing school and also has no idea as to what to do with her life. Murray attempts to cover up Rita's lack of progress at nursing school when Mickey asks for progress reports. Eventually, Mickey, frustrated at having to support his brother's family and also learning of their deception concerning his daughter (who is pregnant), explodes during a meeting between the two families, telling Murray he is tired of sending them money. Vivian snaps and stabs Mickey in the leg with a fork. Rita gets on a plane with her now outraged parents. Depressed and dejected, Murray once again packs the kids into his car and they take off. In an attempt to cheer her father up, Vivian suggests that the family stop for a cheap steak at [[Sizzler]] for breakfast \u2014 a ritual regularly suggested by their father as a means of showing affection to his children, despite their indifference to it or him.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits and order, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Murray Abromowitz, Vivian's father\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Vivian Abromowitz, a fourteen-year-old girl who is the story's main protagonist\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Eliot Arenson, Vivian's neighbor and sometime boyfriend\n* [[Jessica Walter]] as Doris, Murray's new love interest\n* [[Rita Moreno]] as Belle Abromowitz, Mickey's wife and Rita's mother\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Ben Abromowitz, Vivian's 18-year-old brother\n* [[Eli Marienthal]] as Rickey Abromowitz, Vivian's 10-year-old brother\n* [[Carl Reiner]] as Mickey, Murray's older brother\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Rita Abromowitz, Vivian's cousin\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Rachel Hoffman\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is loosely based on writer-director Tamara Jenkins' experiences as a youth moving around different apartments in the Beverly Hills area with her lower-middle-class family. Jenkins wrote the script at the [[Sundance Institute|Sundance Filmmakers' Lab]], where Sundance founder [[Robert Redford]] got ahold of her screenplay and expressed interest in producing it. Redford said he related to Jenkins' experiences of having \"grown up as an 'outsider'...not at all a member of the club but a sideline observer from the wrong side of the tracks.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Rochlin |first=Margy |date=1998-08-09 |title=FILM; Hand to Mouth, 90210: A Beverly Hills Life |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/09/movies/film-hand-to-mouth-90210-a-beverly-hills-life.html |access-date=2022-10-18 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Redford is credited as an executive producer on the film.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Box office ===\n''Slums of Beverly Hills'' earned a total of $5,502,773 at the domestic box office.

She does a good job of looking incredulous, and there's a lot in her life to be incredulous about. She also has a nice pragmatic approach to sexuality, as in a scene where she consults a plastic surgeon about on-the-spot breast reduction.\" He also stated, \"...basically I enjoyed ''Slums of Beverly Hills''\u2014for the wisecracking, for the family squabbles, for the notion of squatters who stake a claim in a Beverly Hills where money, after all, is not the only currency.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Slums of Beverly Hills Movie Review (1998) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/slums-of-beverly-hills-1998 |website=RogerEbert.com |access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reviewer Ruthe Stein stated, \"While touching on serious issues such as loss, this coming-of-age story is first and foremost a comedy, and a hilarious one at that. It never strains to be funny. The humor derives from the deadpan responses of family members to circumstances beyond their control.\" She also wrote, \"Set in the mid-'70s, ''Slums'' gets the period right, from the burnt orange shag carpet on the floor of the family's temporary digs to the dorky clothes and extreme hairstyles. Even the saleslady who sells Vivian her first bra has the overly made-up look of the time. The Abramowitzes' behavior when they go out to eat\u2014complaining about the service and that there's too much salt in the food\u2014may seem to border on a Jewish stereotype.
