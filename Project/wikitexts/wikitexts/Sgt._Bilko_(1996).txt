Bilko''''' is a 1996 American [[Military fiction|military]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Jonathan Lynn]] and written by [[Andy Breckman]].  It is an adaptation of the 1950s television series ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'', often informally called ''Sgt. Bilko'', or simply ''Bilko'', and stars [[Steve Martin]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Phil Hartman]] and [[Glenne Headly]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Master Sergeant]] Ernest G. Bilko is in charge of the motor pool at Fort Baxter, a small [[United States Army]] base that develops new military technology. Exploiting this position, he directs a number of scams, ranging from gambling to renting out military vehicles. His commanding officer, [[Colonel]] John Hall, overlooks Bilko's money-making schemes, as he is more concerned with problems in the \"Hover Tank\" that the base is designing.\n\n[[Major]] Colin Thorn, an officer from the U.S. Army Inspector General's office, arrives at the camp and begins to scrutinize Bilko's record. Officially, Thorn is at Fort Baxter to conduct a general inspection and determine if the base should remain open in light of recent defense cutbacks. He is also determined to get revenge on Bilko to settle an old score the two have from [[Fort Dix]], where Thorn was nearly court-martialed after a fixed boxing match which resulted in Thorn being shipped off to [[Greenland]] in the belief that he tried to fix the fight.\n\nBitter and unprincipled, Thorn is not above breaking the law to ruin Bilko. He attempts to steal Bilko's long-time fianc\u00e9e Rita, whom Bilko has stood up at the altar more than a dozen times. Rita is tired of waiting and gives Bilko 30 days to win her back or lose her for good.\n\nBilko, with the help of newly assigned Private First Class Wally Holbrook, devises a means of avoiding Thorn's attempt to transfer him to Greenland:  He rigs a demonstration of the base's malfunctioning Hover Tank, staged before a four-star general and numerous dignitaries. Since Thorn had deliberately tried to sabotage the tank the previous night, he confronts Bilko, Hall, and the general, loudly insulting Bilko and Hall. While ranting, he confesses to sabotaging the Hover Tank. Thorn is sent off again to Greenland.\n\nThe last day of Rita's ultimatum has come. Just as she sadly begins to write Bilko off forever, Rita hears men outside her house, serenading her with a  [[Only You (And You Alone)|favorite song]] of hers and Bilko's. Looking out, she sees Bilko and his platoon. Bilko asks Rita to marry him, and she accepts. The next day is their wedding day, but Rita shows up late, due to a mix-up over [[Daylight Saving Time]]. After they play another card game (if Bilko wins, they get married), they finally get married. Unknown to Bilko, Rita is holding four aces in her hand.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Steve Martin]] as [[Master Sergeant]] Ernest G. Bilko\n*[[Dan Aykroyd]] as Col. John T. Hall\n*[[Phil Hartman]] as Maj.
