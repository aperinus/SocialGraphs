It was directed by [[Karyn Kusama]], written by [[Phil Hay (screenwriter)|Phil Hay]] and [[Matt Manfredi]], and produced by [[Gale Anne Hurd]], David Gale, [[Gary Lucchesi]] and [[Gregory Goodman|Greg Goodman]]. The film was produced by [[MTV Films]], [[Lakeshore Entertainment]], [[Babelsberg Film Studio]] and [[Gale Anne Hurd|Valhalla Motion Pictures]]. It stars [[Charlize Theron]] as the title character, [[Marton Csokas]], [[Jonny Lee Miller]], [[Sophie Okonedo]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], and [[Frances McDormand]].\n\nThe film was released on December 2, 2005, by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the United States. The film was poorly received by critics and grossed only $52.3 million against a production budget of $55\u201362 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2011, a deadly pathogenic virus killed 99 percent of the Earth's population, forcing the survivors to regroup and scatter across the Earth.\n\nFour centuries later, in 2415, the remaining five million humans inhabit Bregna, a [[dystopia]]n<ref>[https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/aeon-flux-review/ Aeon Flux Review]. empireonline.com (January 27, 2006). Retrieved on August 30, 2020.</ref> walled futuristic [[city-state]], which is ruled by a [[Technocracy|congress of scientists]]. Although Bregna is largely an idyllic place in the destroyed Earth, people routinely disappear and the population is plagued by nightmares.\n\nA skilled warrior, named \u00c6on Flux, is a member of the Monicans, an underground rebel organization who communicate through telepathy-enabling technology and are led by the Handler. After a mission to destroy a surveillance station, \u00c6on comes home to find her sister Una has been mistaken for a Monican and killed. When \u00c6on is sent on a mission to kill the government's leader, [[Trevor Goodchild]], she discovers that both she and the Monicans are being manipulated by a cabal of council members working towards a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], unrelated to the goals of the Monicans.\n\n\u00c6on questions the origins of everyone in Bregna and in particular, her personal connection to Trevor. Everyone in Bregna is revealed to be a [[Clone (plant)#Organism cloning|clone]], grown from recycled [[DNA]]. With the dead constantly being reborn as new individuals and bearing partial memories of their previous lives, their troubling dreams have increased. Cloning was required because the antidote to the virus made humans infertile. Trevor's ongoing experiments were attempts to reverse the infertility. His preceding clones had all worked on this problem. \u00c6on learns that she is a clone of the original Trevor's wife Katherine and that she is the first \"Katherine\" clone in over 400 years.\n\nUna was one of Trevor's most successful experiments; part of a group of clones that proved to be fertile, with Una having been pregnant when she was killed. However, in order to keep the dynasty of Goodchild clones in power, Trevor's brother, Oren, had Una killed along with the other members of the fertile experimental group. He ordered all of Trevor's research to be destroyed. In a confrontation with Trevor and \u00c6on, Oren reveals that nature has corrected the infertility problem and that some women are becoming pregnant without intervention by scientists. Oren has had them all killed to maintain the Goodchild reign. \u00c6on then goes against both Oren and her former allies, who want to kill Trevor and also kill her for not killing Trevor.\n\n\u00c6on convinces the other Monicans tracking her, including her friend Sithandra, to ignore the Handler and to help her kill Oren and his men. \u00c6on goes to destroy the Relical, the [[Airship|dirigible]] that stores the DNA for cloning. There she meets Keeper, the old man who monitors everything. She discovers that he preserved Katherine's DNA for years, although an earlier Oren clone had ordered it to be destroyed so \"Katherine\" could not influence any Trevors. The dirigible crashes into the city wall, breaking it down to reveal the surrounding land for the first time in centuries. It is lush and fertile, rather than the wasteland they had been taught.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[\u00c6on Flux]]\n* [[Marton Csokas]] as [[Trevor Goodchild]]\n* [[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Oren Goodchild\n* [[Sophie Okonedo]] as Sithandra\n* [[Pete Postlethwaite]] as Keeper\n* [[Amelia Warner]] as Una Flux\n* [[Caroline Chikezie]] as Freya\n* [[Paterson Joseph]] as Giroux\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Handler\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Nikolai Kinski]] and [[Yangzom Brauen]] appear in the roles of Claudius and Inari, respectively.\n\n==Production==\nThe screenplay was written by [[Phil Hay (screenwriter)|Phil Hay]] and [[Matt Manfredi]] based on the animated TV series by [[Peter Chung]]. In the early stages of production, actress [[Michelle Rodriguez]] was considered for the part of \u00c6on. She had previously worked with Kusama in ''[[Girlfight]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Kusama had originally suggested filming in [[Bras\u00edlia]], the capital of Brazil, because the 20th-century modern architecture of that city fit with her vision of Bregna. The producers rejected the idea because Bras\u00edlia lacked the infrastructure and technical expertise to support a major film production. After several cities were scouted, [[Berlin]] and [[Potsdam]] in Germany were chosen for filming. Berlin had several locations that fit into the organic yet structured world of ''\u00c6on Flux''. The crew gained permission to film in several locations that had never allowed such access before, including the Treptow Crematorium, the Adlershof Trudelturm and Windkanal [[wind tunnel]] facility, and the [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]] (\"House of the World's Cultures\"). Additional locations included the [[Bauhaus Archive]] and a dissection theatre built in 1790 to train [[veterinarian]]s, part of the Berlin animal shelter. It was used as the Handler space.<ref name=\"fluxdvd\">''\u00c6on Flux'' DVD, ''The Locations of '\u00c6on Flux' featurette''.</ref> Filming was temporarily suspended for a month during September 2004 while Theron recovered from a neck injury she sustained during stunt-work on the tenth day of shooting. She was hospitalized in Berlin for five days and required about six weeks of [[physiotherapy]] to recover.\n\nKusama says that after she finished the film, the studio took it away from her and heavily re-edited it, changing storylines and characters, believing that her version was too much of an [[art film]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/karyn-kusama-the-invitation-girlfight#.awjwLNeRB |title=How Hollywood Turned Its Back On One Of The Most Exciting Filmmakers |last=Vary |first=Adam B. |date=April 7, 2016 |publisher=Buzzfeed News |access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nParamount chose not to screen ''\u00c6on Flux'' for critics prior to its release.

On February 9, 2006, it completed its theatrical run, grossing a domestic take of $25,874,337 and a worldwide box office total of $52,304,001, making it a write-down and a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]] against its $55\u201362 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aeonflux.htm |title=Aeon Flux (2005) |website=Box Office Mojo |access-date=February 5, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"numbers\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film holds a 9% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10.

The storyline serves as a prequel to the film and is a mixture of Chung's original TV series designs and characters, combined with the setting and story elements of the film; the comic book version of \u00c6on loosely resembles Theron, while her colleague Sithandra, played by a black actress in the film, is depicted as white in the comic book. The first issue sets up Flux's mission for the miniseries: sabotage the Bregnan government's plan to destroy the forest outside of Bregna's walls. The last two issues of the limited series were published after the film had been released. By the time the final issue was published, the film had already ended its run in most areas. Dark Horse has not announced whether additional ''\u00c6on Flux''-based comics will be published.\n\n==Video game==\n{{Main|\u00c6on Flux (video game)}}\nOn November 15, 2005, a video game tie-in prequel of the [[\u00c6on Flux (video game)|same name]] was released in North America for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game console|gaming consoles]]. The game takes place in eras before the film's setting of 2030 to 2338. The likenesses and voices of actors from the film were used.
