Produced by [[Sean S. Cunningham]], the movie is the first installment in the [[House (film series)|''House'' film series]], and stars [[William Katt]], [[George Wendt]], [[Richard Moll]], and [[Kay Lenz]]. The plot tells the story of a troubled author who lives in his deceased aunt's house and soon falls victim to the house being haunted. It collected $22.1 million worldwide, and was followed by three [[#Sequel|sequels]].\n\n==Plot==\nAuthor Roger Cobb is a troubled man: he and his wife have separated, their only son Jimmy has disappeared without a trace,\nand his aunt has committed suicide by hanging. On top of everything else, he has been pressured by his publisher to write another book. To the chagrin of his fans and publisher, Roger plans a novel based on his experiences in the [[Vietnam War]], instead of another horror story, as a way to purge himself of the horrors that he had experienced while there.\n\nAfter his aunt's funeral, Roger decides to live inside her house to write instead of selling it, as recommended by the estate attorney. After moving in, Roger begins to have powerful graphic nightmares, including thoughts about his comrade, Big Ben, who died in Vietnam. In addition, strange phenomena spring forth from the house, haunting him in his waking hours. He tries communicating his fears to his next-door neighbor Harold Gorton who only thinks that Roger is crazy.\n\nOne night while investigating a noise coming from his late aunt's bedroom, Roger is attacked by a deformed monster inside the closet. Soon, more attacks occur: levitating garden tools attack him, his wife appears and transforms into a hideous hag-like creature to attack him (whom he believes he kills), and gremlin creatures attempt to kidnap a neighbor's child whom Roger is reluctantly babysitting. Eventually he harpoons the closet monster and is dragged into a flashback where he sees Big Ben's kidnap. Shortly after he escapes, the author discovers an entry into a sinister other-world through the bathroom medicine cabinet and is pulled into the darkness, where he fortuitously locates his lost son Jimmy but is chased by a strange figure.\n\nRoger manages to escape with Jimmy but is soon confronted by an undead Big Ben who wants revenge on him; Ben was taken prisoner and tortured before dying, and he blames Roger for failing to kill him before he could be captured by the enemy. Roger confronts Ben, no longer afraid of his fears, and destroys him with a grenade as he and his son escape the burning house. In the end, he triumphantly glances back at the house while regaining control of his life and reunites with his wife and child.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Katt]] as Roger Cobb\n* [[George Wendt]] as Harold Gorton\n* [[Richard Moll]] as Big Ben\n* [[Kay Lenz]] as Sandy Sinclair\n* [[Mary St\u00e4vin]] as Tanya\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as Chet Parker\n* [[Susan French]] as Aunt Elizabeth Hooper\n* Erik Silver and Mark Silver as Jimmy\n* Peter Pitofsky as Sandywitch\n* [[Felix Silla]] as Little Critter\n* Elizabeth Barrington as Little Critter\n* [[Jerry Maren]] as Little Critter\n* [[Dino Andrade]] as Little Critter (Critter Voices)\n* [[Mindy Sterling]] as Woman in Bookstore\n* [[Alan Autry]] as Police Officer\n* [[Steven Williams]] as Police Officer\n\n==Production==\n''House'' began filming on April 22, 1985. The first two weeks of production comprised shooting exteriors at the estate known today as Mills View, a Victorian style home first built in 1887 and located on Melrose Avenue in [[Monrovia, California]]. At the time, the building was owned by two Los Angeles firemen, brothers Brian and John Wade.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">New World Pictures press kit - Production Notes, 1986</ref>\n\nProduction designer Gregg Fonseca<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0284668/ Sometimes referred as \"Greg Fonseca\"].</ref> and a crew of five spent about four weeks modifying the existing Victorian manor that included repainting the whole of the exterior, bordering the front yard with a wrought iron fence supported by stone pillars, and attaching foam spires to the roof. The back of the house had its clapboard fa\u00e7ade covered with brick, and landscapers were brought in to plant flowers and reseed the dying lawn. The yard had no sidewalk at the time, so a faux walkway - made from plywood painted gray to look like concrete, and positioned to lead straight to the front porch - was added as a finishing touch. This sidewalk was pivotal in the finished film. Some time after production, a true concrete walkway was then installed in the same spot, capturing the evil nature of the one in the film.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe final six weeks of production moved operations to Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, where two floors of the interior of the Monrovia house were recreated on sound stages. This included sets for the living room, staircase, den and three upstairs bedrooms. On a separate adjacent set, the jungle exteriors for the Vietnam flash-back scenes were also built on sound stages, taking three days to put together.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nA total of seven monsters were designed and fabricated for the production. These creatures \u2013 which included the obese witch, the zombified corpse of Big Ben, three demonic kids, the flying skull-faced monster in the void, the plaque mounted marlin that comes to life and the war demon from the closet \u2013 were constructed by seventeen special effects artists, over a period of three-and-a-half months. The war demon, in particular, was an elaborately built puppet, measuring eighteen feet, fully mechanized, operated by fifteen people and featured a fully working lower bowel system.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''House'' opened in 1,440 theaters on February 28, 1986 and grossed $5.9 million in its opening weekend, missing first place to ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1986&wknd=09&p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for February 28-March 2, 1986 - Box Office Mojo |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=August 3, 2012}}</ref> By the end of its run, ''House'' grossed $22.1 million worldwide, of which $19.4 million was from the North American box office.<ref name=numbers/>\n\n==Reception==\nOn review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 57% based on reviews from 13 critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/1010012-house/ |title=House (Ding Dong, You're Dead)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= July 21, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nJanet Maslin of the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote: \"Scares are not its strong suit, but it has a trim, bright look and better performances than might be expected.\"<ref>{{cite web |date= 28 February 1986|last1= Maslin |first1= Janet |author-link1= Janet Maslin |title= Film: Haunting with a Difference in 'House' |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/28/movies/film-haunting-with-a-difference-in-house.html |website= [[The New York Times]] }}</ref>\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"Though much of this nonsense is played tongue-in-cheek, an audience can hardly be expected to swallow the screenplay\u2019s arbitrary approach to Cobb's character.\"<ref>{{cite web |date= December 31, 1985 |author=<!-- Variety Staff --> |title= Review: 'House'|url= https://variety.com/1985/film/reviews/house-1200426903/ |access-date= July 21, 2019 }}</ref>\nRyan Pollard at ''Starburst'' wrote at the time of the Blu-ray release: \"As a film, House is still as much of a warm, at times bonkers, family-friendly horror as it's ever been.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pollard |first1=Ryan |title=HOUSE (1986) |url=https://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/house-1986 |website=STARBURST Magazine}}</ref>  Alex Stewart of ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' wrote that although the film has a good premise, it is \"squandered on yet another tired old haunted house story\" whose supernatural horrors can not compare to the real life trauma of war.<ref name=\"WD79\">{{cite journal  | last =Stewart | first =Alex | title =2020 Vision  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | issue =79  | pages =18  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  | date = July 1986  }}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\nIn 1987, [[Richard Moll]] and [[Kay Lenz]] were both nominated for [[Saturn Awards]].
