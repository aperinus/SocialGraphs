The supporting cast comprises [[Stockard Channing]] as Cynthia, [[Dan Hedaya]], [[Victor Garber]], and [[Stephen Collins]] as the three leads' ex-husbands, and, [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]], and [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as their lovers, respectively.

During a celebratory champagne toast, Cynthia has them promise always to be there for each other and takes a group photo.\n\nIn the present, the four women have lost touch. Cynthia learns through the tabloids that her ex-husband has remarried a much younger, more attractive woman. She sends notes to Annie, Brenda, and Elise and then commits suicide. Devastated by Cynthia's death, the three friends reunite at her funeral and learn of each other's marital troubles at lunch afterward. Annie is separated from her advertising executive husband, Aaron, and is in therapy for self-esteem issues. Elise is an alcoholic [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning actress in the process of divorcing her [[film producer]] husband, Bill, and relies on plastic surgery to keep hold of her fading career. Brenda is struggling financially after divorcing her husband, Morty, who runs a successful chain of electronics stores.\n\nAfter the funeral, Aaron stuns Annie by asking her for a divorce so he can be with her therapist. Elise meets with a film director who tells her he envisions her playing the mother of the main character in his upcoming film. While shopping, Brenda runs into Morty and his beautiful, much younger girlfriend, Shelly, who insults Brenda's weight.\n\nThe women come together again once they receive the notes Cynthia mailed before her death, in which she describes her loneliness for their friendship. They form the First Wives Club to obtain restitution from their husbands.\n\nBrenda and Annie learn from Brenda's Mafia-connected uncle that Morty's first electronics store sold stolen goods and that his [[Bookkeeping|books]] are fraudulent. Annie's daughter, who obtains a job at her father's advertising agency to spy on her father for Annie, reveals that Aaron's partners want to sell their share of the agency. Annie works up a scheme with Elise whereby Elise liquidates all of Bill's valuable assets acquired during their marriage and sells them for one [[United States dollar|dollar]] to Annie, who then auctions them off and uses the proceeds to buy out Aaron's partners. Unable to find any blackmail information on Bill, Elise gets into a vicious fight with Brenda and Annie while drinking. Annie contemplates leaving the Club, but Brenda and Elise convince her to stay, with Elise promising to sober up.\n\nElise meets with Bill's young, attractive girlfriend, Phoebe, who is slated to play the main character in the film for which Elise is up for the part of the mother. She discovers that Phoebe is a minor and threatens to Bill that she will go public if he does not help her, Brenda, and Annie fund a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to helping abused women. Brenda similarly threatens to expose Morty's tax evasion and Annie prevents Aaron from walking away from the advertising agency by bringing in a multi-million dollar account of her own. Bill, Aaron, and Morty all agree to the women's demands.\n\nBrenda, Annie, and Elise use their husbands' money to establish the Cynthia Swann Griffin Crisis Center for Women. At the grand opening celebration, Brenda and Morty seem headed for reconciliation, with Morty frustrated by Shelly's neediness; she later flirts with Bill. Elise is starring in a successful Broadway play and dating one of her fellow actors and a confident Annie rejects Aaron's request to come back to her. The women close up the center and dance down the street singing \"[[You Don't Own Me]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bette Midler]] as Brenda Morelli-Cushman, a wise-cracking Sicilian-[[Jews|Jewish]] single mother who helped set her husband Morty on his feet financially, before he left her for his younger employee Shelly, cheating her out of an equitable settlement. She later blackmails Morty to get ownership of his business. However, when she realizes Morty is contrite about his sins, Brenda accepts attempts at reconciliation of their relationship.\n** Michele Brilliant as young Brenda Morelli\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Elise Eliot-Atchison, a former one-time [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning actress, now an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and heavy smoker relegated to [[B movie]]s due to her \"unprofitable\" age. Her husband, Bill, who left her for another woman, is suing for alimony and insisting that all of their joint assets be sold and the profits divided between them. She liquidates their assets by selling them to Annie for a very low amount, and Annie auctions them so she can buy out her husband's partners. Elise also blackmails Bill about dating a minor.\n** [[Dina Spybey]] as young Elise Eliot\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Annie MacDuggan-Paradis, the vehicle for the film's sporadic [[voice-over]] and its central character; an anxious and slightly [[Neuroticism|neurotic]] housewife, saddled with self-esteem problems, attempting to save her marriage with estranged husband Aaron \u2013 much to her daughter's dismay. After Aaron has sex with her and then leaves her for her therapist, she decides to band together with Brenda and Elise to form the First Wives Club. Annie learns that Aaron is having problems with his advertising firm partners through the help of her daughter, and buys them out at the end of the film; making her the majority owner of Aaron's firm.\n** [[Adria Tennor]] as young Annie MacDuggan\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Gunilla Garson Goldberg, a wealthy New York City socialite who helps the First Wives Club with their schemes because she was once a first wife, as well as a \"second, third and fourth wife\", according to Annie. She fools the social climbing Shelly into thinking Duarto Felice is a reputable decorator.\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Shelly Stewart, Morty's dim-witted but manipulative fianc\u00e9e. It's indicated throughout the film that Shelly believes a position in high society can be obtained through money and the protagonists exploit her social-climbing attitude for their revenge. This is Parker's second film with Midler as her co-star, the first being the 1993 Disney film ''[[Hocus Pocus (1993 film)|Hocus Pocus]]''.\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Morton \"Morty\" Cushman, Brenda's ex-husband, an electronics tycoon, who takes advantage of his former wife's having signed an out-of-court settlement \u2013 just to finance his girlfriend Shelly's extravagant taste. He's later blackmailed into giving Brenda a substantial amount of his money when she and her Uncle Carmine obtain proof of Morty's criminal activity. This later causes him to apologize to Brenda when he realizes Shelly only loved him because of his money, leading to his and Brenda's reconciliation.\n* [[Stephen Collins]] as Aaron Paradis, Annie's conflicted husband and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of an advertising agency, who leaves his wife for their therapist, Leslie Rosen. Eventually he is left alone as Leslie runs off and Annie does not want him back.\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Dr. Leslie Rosen, Aaron's short-time affair, who is the therapist for both Annie and Aaron. Leslie has been \"helping\" Annie with her self-esteem problems.\n* [[Victor Garber]] as Bill Atchison, a successful [[film producer]], who rose to fame through Elise's connections and eventually left her in favor of a young starlet.\n* [[Elizabeth Berkley]] as Phoebe LaVelle, an up-and-coming actress, living with Bill. She presumably tells him that she is 21, but Elise investigates and reveals to Bill that she is 16 years old and a high school dropout.\n* [[Eileen Heckart]] as Catherine MacDuggan, Annie's 'controlling' mother. By the end of the film, she tells Annie that she is proud of her and that she doesn't need anyone to make her happy.\n* [[Bronson Pinchot]] as Duarto Feliz, Brenda's boss and (according to Annie) \"one of the ten worst interior decorators in New York.\" He uses his role as decorator to help the First Wives Club sneak into Morty and Shelly's apartment.\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Cynthia Swann-Griffin, a college friend of the three main protagonists, who dies by suicide after her husband, Gil, leaves her and marries his young mistress three days after their divorce is finalized.\n** Juliehera Destefano as Young Cynthia\n* [[Jennifer Dundas]] as Christine \"Chris\" Paradis, Annie's [[lesbian]] and feminist daughter, who resents her father for what he is putting her mother through. She gets a job working at her father's advertising firm to spy on him for Annie. This is the second film in which Dundas plays Keaton's daughter, having previously done so in ''[[Mrs. Soffel]]''.\n* Ari Greenberg as Jason Cushman, Brenda's son, who is caught in an emotional battle between his parents.\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Uncle Carmine Morelli, Brenda's paternal uncle and part of her family's [[Sicilian Mafia]] connections. He is the one who informs Brenda that Morty had his stores stocked with stolen electronics, which the Mafia had done to help Morty and Brenda financially during the shaky early years of their marriage.\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Brett Artounian, a film director who is interested in casting Elise as the main character's aging mother in his new film.\n* Aida Linares as Teresa, Cynthia's loyal maid.\n* [[Ivana Trump]] as herself (special guest appearance).\n* [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] as herself (special guest appearance).\n* [[Ed Koch]] and [[Gloria Steinem]] as party guests (special guest appearances).\n* [[James Naughton]] as Gil Griffin, Cynthia's ex-husband (special guest appearance).\n* [[Heather Locklear]] as Gil's new wife (special guest appearance).\n* [[Edward Hibbert]] as Maurice, a barman serving Elise as she drowns her sorrows\n* [[J. K. Simmons]] as Federal Marshal\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Dr. Morris Packman, who warns Elise against overdoing it on plastic surgery.\n* [[Gregg Edelman]] as Mark Loest\n* [[Lea DeLaria]] as Elise's fan\n* [[Debra Monk]] as jilted lover\n* [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]] as woman in bed\n* [[Walter Bobbie]] as man in bed\n\n==Development==\n\n===Writing===\nThe film project originally belonged to [[Sherry Lansing]], who bought the unpublished manuscript of the novel in 1991, after many publishers had rejected it, and handed it over to producer [[Scott Rudin]] when she became [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1992.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/24/movies/appeal-of-a-woman-s-revenge.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Appeal of a Woman's Revenge | first=Bernard | last=Weinraub | date=September 24, 1996 | access-date=May 25, 2010 | archive-date=September 5, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905060224/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/24/movies/appeal-of-a-woman-s-revenge.html | url-status=live }}</ref> \"It was one of the single best ideas for a movie I've ever heard,\" she said in a 1996 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]''. \"The situation of a woman getting left for a younger version of herself was far too common.
