It stars [[Tom Berenger]] as a police detective who has to protect a wealthy woman ([[Mimi Rogers]]), who is a key witness in a murder trial. The film's soundtrack includes the [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin|Ira]] Gershwin [[Someone to Watch Over Me (song)|song]] from which the film takes its title, recorded by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], and [[Vangelis]]' \"Memories of Green\", originally from Scott's ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982).\n\n==Plot==\nSocialite Claire Gregory attends a party and art show sponsored by one of her oldest friends, Winn Hockings. Accompanying her is her straitlaced boyfriend, Neil Steinhart. In another part of town, there is another party, this one for newly appointed [[NYPD]] detective Mike Keegan.\n\nWinn is accosted by a former partner, Joey Venza, who is angry because Winn had not come to him to borrow money for his new art studio. After a short argument, he stabs Winn to death. Claire witnesses the killing as she steps out of the elevator; she screams and is spotted by Venza. He pursues her, but she manages to get back into the elevator just in time.\n\nThe police are called in and the new detective Keegan is there. He is a married man, but immediately falls for Claire. Along with fellow cops, he is assigned to protect Claire until she can make a positive ID of Venza (once he is arrested) and testify in court.\n\nKeegan is determined to protect Claire and goes to extremes to do so. Venza makes numerous threats and attempts on her life, nearly succeeding at one point. Keegan and his wife Ellie separate over his involvement in the case. He and Claire acknowledge their love but Keegan cannot bring himself to simply abandon his family.\n\nAt the end, Venza, who draws out Keegan by taking his son hostage, is shot by Ellie and killed. Claire breaks up with Neil and intends to go to Europe to get over Keegan, who returns to his wife and son.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Detective Mike Keegan\n* [[Mimi Rogers]] as Claire Gregory\n* [[Lorraine Bracco]] as Ellie Keegan\n* [[Jerry Orbach]] as Lieutenant Garber\n* [[John Rubinstein]] as Neil Steinhart\n* [[Andreas Katsulas]] as Joey Venza\n* [[Tony Di Benedetto]] as T.J.\n* [[Jim Moriarty]] as Koontz\n* [[Mark Moses]] as Win Hockings\n* [[Daniel Hugh Kelly]] as Scotty\n* [[Harley Cross]] as Tommy Keegan\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was initially pitched to Scott in 1982 during a dinner party by [[Howard Franklin]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/57821-SOMEONE-TOWATCHOVERME?sid=4f73e1e7-ac66-4ca6-a958-fbece160de30&sr=16.021748&cp=1&pos=0|title=Someone To Watch Over Me (1987)|website=American Film Institute|accessdate=May 21, 2020}}</ref> It was primarily written by Franklin by late 1982 with Scott years later bringing in [[Danilo Bach]] and [[David Seltzer]] to refine it.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBGFacfGR0gC&q=someone+to+watch+over+me+ridley+scott+1982+script%2C+filmed+1986&pg=PA123|title=The Ridley Scott Encyclopedia|first=Lawrence|last=Raw|date=28 September 2009|isbn=9780810869523|accessdate=May 21, 2020}}</ref> [[Ridley Scott]] made the film following ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' which had been a notable box office failure.
