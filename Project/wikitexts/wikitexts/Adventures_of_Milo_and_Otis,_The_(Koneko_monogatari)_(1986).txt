The original Japanese version, narrated by Shigeru Tsuyuki and with poetry recitation by [[Ky\u014dko Koizumi]], was released on July 12, 1986. [[Columbia Pictures]] removed 15 minutes from the original film and released a shorter English-language version, written by [[Mark Saltzman]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097050/combined|title=The Adventures of Milo and Otis (1986) - IMDb}}</ref> and narrated by [[Dudley Moore]], on August 25, 1989.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on Nippon Farm, with a mother cat who has given birth to kittens. One of the kittens is named Milo, or Chatran in the Japanese version ({{nihongo|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3|Chatoran}}, literally Brown Tiger), and has a habit of being too curious and getting himself into trouble. He finds a pug puppy named Otis, or Poosky in the Japanese version ({{nihongo|\u30d7\u30fc\u52a9|P\u016bsuke}}), and they soon become friends. When Milo is hiding inside a box floating in the river, it breaks loose and he accidentally drifts downstream. Otis runs after Milo, who himself goes on many adventures, escaping one obstacle after another.\n\nMilo encounters a bear, escapes from a raven and Deadwood Swamp, steals a dead muskrat from a fox, follows a railroad called Nippon Bearway to the home of a deer who shelters him, sleeps in a nest with an owl, stays for a while with a pig and her piglets, catches a fish and is robbed of it by a raccoon, is mobbed by seagulls, and evades another bear, then a snake, before falling into a deep pit.\n\nFor his part, Otis follows Milo throughout, usually only an hour behind and less than a mile out of range. Finally, the two catch up with one another. While Milo is in the hole, Otis pulls him out by means of a rope. Milo and Otis are reunited, and soon find mates of their own: Joyce, a white cat, for Milo; and Sondra, a French pug, for Otis. Afterward, they briefly part ways and raise offspring of their own. Later, Milo, Otis, Joyce, and Sondra (along with their litters) happily find their way back together through the forest to their farm as the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\nAll characters are voiced by the narrator, Shigeru Tsuyuki (Japanese) and [[Dudley Moore]] (English).\n* Milo\n* Otis\n* Milo's mother\n* Gloria\n* Gloria's chick\n* Bear\n* Fox\n* Deer\n* Owl\n* Pig\n* Raccoon\n* Snake\n* Joyce\n* Sondra\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Masanori Hata]] and associate director [[Kon Ichikawa]] edited the film together from 74 hours of footage ({{convert|400,000|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} of film), shot over a period of four years.<ref name=\"AHA\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe original Japanese soundtrack, released as ''The Adventures of Chatran: Original Soundtrack'', was composed by [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and included {{nihongo|\"Koneko Monogatari\"|\u5b50\u732b\u7269\u8a9e|}}, a theme song performed by Keiko Yoshinaga.

Other scenes that were the source of controversy were a scene of a cat falling off a cliff and trying to climb back up, and a scene of a pug fighting a [[bear]], all of which were deleted from the American version.
