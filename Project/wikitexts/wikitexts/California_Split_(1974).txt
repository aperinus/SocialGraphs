''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]{{'}}s [[Vulture.com]]'' praised it as the greatest film about gambling ever made.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/best-gambling-movies-poker.html|title=The 25 Best Movies About Gambling|website=Vulture|date=September 10, 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Los Angeles]], a friendship develops between Bill Denny and Charlie Waters over their mutual love of gambling after they are beaten up and robbed by a card player whose money they have won. Charlie, a wisecracking joker who lives with two prostitutes, is an experienced gambler who is constantly looking for the next score. He bets on poker, horse racing, boxing, and anything else that offers odds. Initially, Bill is not as committed a gambler (during the day he does a little work at a magazine while avoiding his boss), but he is well on his way to a full-blown [[problem gambling|gaming addiction]].\n\nAs the two men hang out at Charlie's house, Bill's office, seedy bars, card rooms, and various sports venues, Bill becomes hooked on the gambling lifestyle. He goes into debt to Sparkie, his [[bookie]], and hocks possessions, including his car, to fund a bus trip to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]. At the track, Charlie spots the man who mugged him and Bill at the beginning of the film, beats him up, and robs him.\n\nOn their way to Reno, Bill and Charlie pool their money to stake Bill in a poker game. (One of the players is former world champion [[Amarillo Slim]], portraying himself.) Bill wins $18,000 and becomes convinced he is on a hot streak. He plays [[blackjack]], then [[roulette]], and finally [[craps]], winning more and more money. When Bill loses after a long streak at the craps table, he is drained and apathetic. Charlie is eager to continue gambling at other casinos, but after they split their winnings ($82,000), Bill tells Charlie he is quitting and going home. Charlie does not understand this but sees that his friend is sincere, so they go their separate ways.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[George Segal]] as Bill Denny\n*[[Elliott Gould]] as Charlie Waters\n*[[Ann Prentiss]] as Barbara Miller\n*[[Gwen Welles]] as Susan Peters\n*Edward Walsh as Lew\n*Joseph Walsh as Sparkie\n*[[Bert Remsen]] as Helen Brown\n*[[Jeff Goldblum]] as Lloyd Harris\n*[[Barbara Ruick]] as Reno Barmaid\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nJoseph Walsh had been an actor for over 20 years. Frustrated with the progress of his career and the sorts of roles he had been playing, he wrote a screenplay about his own gambling addiction in 1971.  \"I knew so much about gambling,\" he said. \"And nobody writes gambling well... I was writing for all the gamblers of the world, people who are going to turn out and watch the movie and say, 'Oh, God, this man is in our heart and soul',\" said Walsh later.<ref name=\"vegas\">Nobody writes gambling as well: Jeff Haney remembers Reno's old Mapes Hotel as he talks with 'California Split' creator Joseph Walsh\nAnonymous. Las Vegas Sun 11 July 2008: 8.</ref>\n\n===Steven Spielberg===\nWalsh was friends with then up-and-coming filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]] and they worked on the script for nine months. The director was fascinated by the characters and would react to Walsh's script, offering suggestions. At the time the screenplay was called ''Slide'' and the two men had a deal to make it at [[MGM]] with Walsh as producer and [[Steve McQueen]] in the starring role.<ref name= \"fear\">{{cite news\n  | last = Fear\n  | first = David\n  | title = Ace in the hole\n  | publisher = Time Out New York\n  | date = Oct 12\u201318, 2006\n  | url = http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/film/4086/ace-in-the-hole\n  | access-date = 2008-03-17 }}</ref> However, the studio began making unrealistic demands, like having the script be an exact number of pages (in a movie script, 1 page = 1 minute), and wanting the whole story to be set at the [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]] casino in [[Las Vegas]] because MGM owned it.<ref name=\"split\">{{cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/california-split-40-years-later-interview-elliott-gould-george-segal-joseph-walsh-three-parts-2/#!|title=California Split 40 Years Later|website=LA Review of Books|date=December 15, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nA month away from filming, the studio experienced a shake-up at the executive level and with it came a new set of changes. MGM wanted the story to be a mafia-related \u201csting\u201d concept with [[Dean Martin]] as one of the two main characters. Walsh would no longer be the producer. He and Spielberg left MGM and took the script to [[Universal Pictures]] where they had an agreement with [[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]]. Zanuck and Brown then hired Spielberg to direct ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', leaving Walsh and his film stranded.\n\n===Robert Altman===\nWalsh's agent, Guy McElwaine, contacted Altman's agent [[George Litto]] to give the script to Altman, who loved it. The new studio chief of [[Columbia Pictures]] was a former agent who knew Walsh's agent and green-lit the screenplay to be produced on the writer's terms.\n\nWalsh was a novice and unaware of Altman's reputation for taking liberties with the screenplays for his movies. Walsh was very protective of his script and argued with Altman numerous times about certain aspects. Walsh remembers, \u201cYou know, he actually stormed out of the room many times on me during the picture, during these conversations, but he would always come back and listen as I got to know him more...\u201d<ref name= \"mcgilligan\">{{cite news\n  | last = McGilligan\n  | first = Patrick\n  | title = Robert Altman: Jumping Off the Cliff\n  | pages = 376\n  | publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]]\n  | year = 1989\n  }}</ref>\n\nAltman eventually financed the film by forming a production company with [[Aaron Spelling]] and [[Leonard Goldberg]], Won World Productions.<ref>Altman's 'Split' to Start Filming\nLos Angeles Times 15 Jan 1974: d10.</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nGeorge Segal was cast early on and Walsh considered long-time friend Elliott Gould, but saw other actors, such as [[Peter Falk]] and [[Robert De Niro]]. He kept coming back to Gould and finally the actor called him up and convinced him that he was right for the role. Walsh recalls, \u201cbecause Elliott ''lived'' his gambling, he came out of the box just like in a horse race when a great horse comes out of the box. The first day of shooting, he was ''there'' as that character...After seven days, George Segal came to me and said, \u2018This guy\u2019s [Gould] unbelievable. He\u2019s an octopus. He is absolutely strangling me to death. I don\u2019t even know what to do.\u2019 The man was pleading for his life.\u201d<ref name= \"mcgilligan\"/> Walsh told Segal not to try to keep up with Gould because he had actually lived the life of his character in the film and to continue acting the way he had been doing so far.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming started in January, 1974, and the filming took place mostly in [[Los Angeles]], with two weeks' location filming in Reno, Nevada.\n\n''California Split'' was the first feature film to use the experimental eight-track sound system, one that allowed eight separate audio channels to be recorded, and helped develop Altman\u2019s trademark of overlapping dialogue. To this end, he gave the supporting actors and extras significant emphasis on the soundtrack. A number of the extras were members of [[Synanon]], an organization for ex-addicts. Altman also used champion poker player Amarillo Slim in the movie \"to add drama to the poker game for the actors and crew. He elevated the game to a very high professional level.\"<ref name= \"reid\">{{cite news\n  | last = Reid\n  | first = Max\n  | title = The Making of ''California Split'': An Interview with Robert Altman\n  | pages = 26\n  | publisher = Filmmakers Newsletter\n  | date = October 1974\n  }}</ref>\n\nHe had originally considered [[Haskell Wexler]] to be the director of photography on the film, but went with newcomer Paul Lohmann instead. Walsh remembers that Altman defended the choice by saying, \"They could create a look together, and he might get into conflict with Haskell or other people about making it a little prettier than it should be.\"<ref name= \"mcgilligan\"/>\n\nAltman ended up making the film in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] at [[Fairplex Park]], in Los Angeles, and in Reno, Nevada, with the latter location being very effective in keeping everyone in the gambling spirit of the movie. Altman said in an interview, \"Everybody was involved in that atmosphere, and there was a sense of reality because one minute you were downstairs in the [[Mapes Hotel|Mapes casino]] losing money and winning money, and then a minute later you were upstairs on the set filming a crap game.\"<ref name= \"reid\"/>\n\nWhile on location in Reno, Nevada, actress [[Barbara Ruick]], who played a friendly Reno poker room bartender, died at the age of 43, of a cerebral hemorrhage sleeping in her hotel room. Her husband, famed film composer [[John Williams]], was left a widower with their three children. ''California Split'' was dedicated to her.\n\nThe ending of the film was different from originally scripted.<ref>{{cite web|website=Stop Smiling|date=15 June 2008|url=http://www.stopsmilingonline.com/story_detail.php?id=1093&page=2|title=Online Exclusive: JOSEPH WALSH, Screenwriter of California Split}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\n[[Roger Ebert]], in his review for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', wrote, \"At the end of ''California Split'' we realize that Altman has made a lot more than a comedy about gambling; he's taken us into an American nightmare, and all the people we met along the way felt genuine and looked real.\" Lauding the film as \"a great movie and [...] a great experience, too,\" he awarded it a full four stars.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Ebert\n  | first = Roger\n  | title = ''California Split''\n  | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]\n  | date = 1974-01-01\n  | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19740101/REVIEWS/401010310/1023\n  | access-date = 2007-03-08 }}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"a fascinating and vivid movie, not quite comparable to any other movie that I can immediately think of.\" He praised the film for being \"dense with fine, idiosyncratic detail, a lot of which is supplied by Mr. Gould and Mr. Segal as well as by members of the excellent supporting cast.\"<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Canby\n  | first = Vincent\n  | title = ''California Split'' Deals Winning Hand\n  | work = The New York Times\n  | date = 1974-08-08\n  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/08/archives/california-split-deals-winning-hand.html\n  | access-date = 2007-03-08\n  }}</ref> He put it on his year-end unranked list of the best films of 1974.<ref>[[Vincent Canby|Canby, Vincent]] (January 5, 1975). \"Critic's Choice: The Eleven Best Films of 1974\".

The consensus summarizes: \"Aimless yet amiable, ''California Split'' is minor but rewarding Altman, elevated by the chemistry between leads Elliott Gould and George Segal.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/california_split | title=California Split | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film reportedly grossed over five million dollars at the box office despite the studio pulling it early from theaters. Altman said of the reaction to his movies, \u201cI just have to hope that the film I do falls in with the mass audience and they will go see it. But one reason I have problems is that they don\u2019t advertise the films I make because they don\u2019t know where to put them...They don\u2019t quite know where it is, so consequently, they try to advertise it as a different film.
