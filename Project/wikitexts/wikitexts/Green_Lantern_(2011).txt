The film stars [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Blake Lively]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Angela Bassett]], and [[Tim Robbins]], with [[Martin Campbell]] directing a script by [[Greg Berlanti]] and comic book writers [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]] and [[Marc Guggenheim]], which was subsequently rewritten by [[Michael Goldenberg]].<ref>{{cite news |date= January 15, 2010 |first= Dave |last= McNary |title= Mark Strong Lights up 'Green Lantern' |url= https://variety.com/2010/film/markets-festivals/mark-strong-lights-up-green-lantern-1118013888/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date= September 30, 2019 }}</ref> This was the first DC film since [[Catwoman (film)|''Catwoman'']] not to be involved with [[Legendary Entertainment|Legendary Pictures]]. The film tells the story of [[Hal Jordan]], a test pilot who is selected to become the first human member of an intergalactic police force called the  [[Green Lantern Corps]]. Hal is given a [[Power ring (DC Comics)|ring]] that grants him superpowers, and must confront [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], who threatens to upset the balance of power in the universe.\n\nThe film first entered [[development (film)|development]] in 1997; progress remained stalled until Greg Berlanti was hired to write and direct in October 2007. [[Martin Campbell]] was brought on board in February 2009 after Berlanti was forced to vacate the director's position. Most of the live-action actors were cast between July 2009 and February 2010, and filming took place from March to August 2010 in [[Louisiana]]. The film was converted to [[3-D film|3D]] during its post-production stage.\n\n''Green Lantern'' was released on June 17, 2011 to negative reviews, with criticism aimed at its poor writing, comedic tone and lack of faithfulness to the source material, while the visuals received mixed reviews. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. It was also originally intended to start a film franchise based on DC characters. However, due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, [[Warner Bros.]] scrapped plans for a sequel, opting instead to use ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' as the official start of the [[DC Extended Universe]], two years after ''Green Lantern''{{'}}s release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/534369/dc-movie-slate-revealed/| title=Warner Bros Massive DC Movie Slate Revealed| last=Fischer| first=Russ| date=October 15, 2014| access-date=February 25, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|date=2016-03-22|title=\u2018Green Lantern\u2019 Revisited: The Last Time Warner Bros.

They divide the universe into 3,600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, [[Abin Sur]] of Sector 2814, defeats the malevolent being [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] and imprisons him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors who had accidentally fallen into the dugout where Parallax was imprisoned on the abandoned planet. Parallax feeds on their fear to gain strength before pursuing and mortally wounding Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] to find a worthy successor.\n\n[[Hal Jordan]], a cocky test pilot working at Ferris Aircraft, is chosen by the ring and transported to the crash site, where the dying Abin Sur appoints him a Green Lantern, telling him to take the lantern and speak [[Green Lantern#Green Lantern Oath|the oath]]. Hal says the oath and is whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of [[Oa]], where he meets and trains with veteran Corps members [[Tomar-Re]], [[Kilowog]], and Corps leader [[Sinestro]], who believes he is unfit and fearful. Hal, disheartened by his extreme training sessions and Sinestro's doubts, quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern.\n\nScientist [[Hector Hammond]] is summoned by his father, Senator Robert Hammond, to a [[Department of Extranormal Operations|secret government facility]] to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body under the watchful eye of [[Amanda Waller]]. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his [[Nepotism|father's influence]] and not for his own abilities, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a massive party with the use of Parallax's power. Hal saves the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart [[Carol Ferris]]. \n\nThe following night, Hal visits Carol Ferris's home in costume, but she immediately recognizes him after getting a closer look. Then they spend a peaceful time together. However, Carol becomes saddened after learning that Hal quit the Corps. Later, at the government facility, Hammond uses [[telekinesis]] to successfully kill his father by burning him alive. Hammond also elevates Waller high above the floor. As she's falling, Hal arrives and saves the injured Waller by creating a pool of water which whisks her away out of further danger. During the encounter, Hal learns of Parallax coming to Earth.\n\nOn Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was one of their fellow guardians who attempted to control the yellow essence of fear, only to become corrupted himself. Arguing that the way to fight fear is with fear itself, Sinestro requests that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing to concede Earth's destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. Hal appears and tries to convince the Guardians that fear will turn the users evil if its power is used, but they reject his pleas, and he returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax on his own.\n\nHal saves Carol from Hammond after a brief showdown. Parallax arrives, consumes Hammond's entire life force, and then wreaks havoc on [[Coast City]]. After a fierce battle, Hal lures Parallax away from Earth to chase him across the [[Solar System]]. Parallax is caught in Alpha Centauri\u2019s [[Gravity|gravitational pull]] and is destroyed, while Hal escapes. Hal loses consciousness after the battle and falls toward the star, but is saved by Sinestro, Kilowog, and Tomar-Re.\n \nThe entire Green Lantern Corps congratulates Hal for his bravery. Sinestro tells Hal he now bears the responsibility of protecting his sector as a Green Lantern. Hal and Carol spend one last time together, and he tells her that he\u2019ll be away for a while. The two share a kiss and Hal flies away.\n \nIn a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Sinestro takes the yellow ring and places it on his finger, causing his green suit and eyes to turn yellow.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Green Lantern Comic-Con Panel.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.13|Cast of ''Green Lantern'' at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].]]\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Hal Jordan| Hal Jordan / Green Lantern]]: <br /> A test pilot for the Ferris Aircraft Company whose will to act qualifies him to become the first earthman ever inducted into [[Green Lantern Corps|an intergalactic peacekeeping force]] fueled by green energy of will.<ref name=\"reynolds\" /> Reynolds said, \"I've known about 'Green Lantern' my whole life, but I've never really followed it before.
