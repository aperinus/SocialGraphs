The ensemble cast of characters form two subplots with Jeff Spicoli ([[Sean Penn]]), a perpetually stoned [[surfer]], facing off against history teacher Mr. Hand ([[Ray Walston]]), and Stacy's older brother, Brad ([[Judge Reinhold]]), a senior who works in entry-level jobs to pay for his car and ponders ending his two-year relationship with his girlfriend, Lisa ([[Amanda Wyss]]).\n\nIn addition to Penn, Reinhold, Cates, and Leigh, the film marks early appearances by several actors who later became stars, including [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Eric Stoltz]], [[Forest Whitaker]], and [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] (the first two in their feature film debuts).\n\nIn 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Adds 25 Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-05-262/librarian-of-congress-adds-25-films-to-national-film-registry-2/2005-12-20/|access-date=2020-10-01|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=November 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126213453/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-05-262/librarian-of-congress-adds-25-films-to-national-film-registry-2/2005-12-20/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-01|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806052210/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBrad Hamilton is a popular senior at Ridgemont High School, a fictional school in the [[San Fernando Valley]], and looks forward to his final year of school. He has a job at All-American Burger, his 1960 [[Buick LeSabre#First generation (1959\u20131960)|Buick LeSabre]] is almost paid for, and plans to break up with his girlfriend Lisa so he can be completely eligible during his senior year. His perfect life is threatened after an exchange with an obnoxious customer results in his firing from All-American Burger. When Brad tries to tell Lisa how much he needs her, she informs him that she wants to break up with him to date other guys. Brad gets a job at Captain Hook Fish & Chips, but quits in humiliation when a beautiful older woman laughs at him wearing a pirate costume while making a food delivery.\n\nBrad's sister Stacy is a 15-year-old freshman and a virgin. She works at a pizza parlor at Ridgemont Mall alongside her outspoken older friend, Linda Barrett. One night at work, Stacy takes an order from Ron Johnson, a 26-year-old stereo salesman, who asks her out after she tells him she's 19. She later sneaks out of her house for a date with him and loses her virginity that night in the dugout of a baseball field. She later tells Linda about the experience, stating how much it hurt. Linda offers advice to Stacy on the matter, which she often does, as the more worldly and experienced of the two. Ron sends her flowers the next day.\n\nMike Damone is a smooth-talker who earns money taking sports bets and scalping concert tickets; he fancies himself a worldly ladies' man. His shy but amiable best friend, Mark Ratner, works as an usher at the movie theater across from the pizza parlor at the mall. When Mark develops a crush on Stacy, Damone lets Mark in on his five secrets for picking up girls. Damone later persuades Mark to ask Stacy out on a date to a German restaurant. Afterwards, at her home, Stacy invites Mark into her bedroom, where they look at her photo album together. They begin to kiss, but a nervous Mark abruptly leaves after Stacy attempts to seduce him. She mistakenly interprets his shyness as disinterest. Linda quickly advises her to move on and find another boy. After he drops by her house unannounced, Stacy becomes interested in Damone. She invites him to her pool, which quickly leads to them having sex in the pool house during which he ejaculates very quickly. Her brother Brad, who has become sullen and withdrawn since his breakup with Lisa and the loss of his job at All-American Burger, is caught masturbating in the bathroom by Linda after he fantasizes about her exposing her breasts to him at the pool.\n\nStacy later informs Damone that he has gotten her pregnant, and he tells her she wanted sex more than he did, which she denies. She asks for him to cover half the cost of an abortion and provide her with a ride to the clinic, and he agrees. However, unable to come up with his half despite attempts to call in debts owed from his business dealings, Damone abandons Stacy on the day of her appointment. She lies and asks her brother Brad to drive her to a bowling alley to meet friends, but he sees her cross the street to the abortion clinic. Brad waits for Stacy and he confronts her about the abortion. Stacy makes Brad promise not to tell their parents, but does not divulge who got her pregnant. When Stacy tells Linda that Damone abandoned her and did not pay his half, Linda becomes furious. The next day, Damone finds his car spray-painted \"Prick\" and his school locker painted \"little prick\", as revenge. Mark confronts Damone about his involvement with Stacy. They almost get into a fight, but their gym teacher breaks it up.\n\nJeff Spicoli is a carefree stoner and surfer who runs afoul of history teacher Mr. Hand. One night, Spicoli wrecks the 1979 [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)#1979|Chevrolet Camaro]] of Ridgemont star football player Charles Jefferson during a joyride with Jefferson's younger brother. Spicoli covers up the damage by making it look like the car was destroyed by fans of Ridgemont's sports rival, Lincoln High School. When Ridgemont plays Lincoln, Jefferson, furious about his car, brutally tackles several of Lincoln's players and almost single-handedly wins the game. On the evening of the graduation dance, Mr. Hand visits Spicoli's house and informs him that he must make up the eight hours of class time he has wasted over the school year. They have a history session that lasts until Mr. Hand is satisfied that Spicoli has understood the lesson, and the two show that they respect each other.\n\nIn the end, Mark and Stacy start dating again, and Mark makes peace with his best friend Damone. Brad takes a job at a convenience store and is promoted to manager after foiling an armed robbery with some help from an oblivious Spicoli. Damone is busted scalping [[Ozzy Osbourne]] tickets and is forced to take a job at [[7-Eleven]]. Linda attends college in Riverside and moves in with her abnormal-psychology professor. Spicoli saves [[Brooke Shields]] from drowning and blows the reward money hiring rock band [[Van Halen]] to play at his birthday party. Mr. Hand maintains his belief that ''everyone'' is on dope.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles per tombstone closing credits scroll pre-\"The End\" --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Sean Penn]] as Jeffrey \"Jeff\" Spicoli\n*[[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Stacy Hamilton\n*[[Judge Reinhold]] as Bradley \"Brad\" Hamilton\n*[[Robert Romanus]] as Michael \u201cMike\u201d Damone\n*[[Brian Backer]] as Mark \"Rat\" Ratner\n*[[Phoebe Cates]] as Linda Barrett\n*[[Ray Walston]] as Mr. Hand\n*[[Scott Thomson (actor)|Scott Thomson]] as Arnold\n*[[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Mr. Vargas\n*[[Lana Clarkson]] as Mrs. Vargas\n*[[Amanda Wyss]] as Lisa\n*[[D.W.
