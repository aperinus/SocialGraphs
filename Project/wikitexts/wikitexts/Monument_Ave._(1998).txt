The film also stars [[Famke Janssen]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Ian Hart]], and [[Lenny Clarke]]. [[Cam Neely]] also makes a brief appearance as a man returning home from work who finds his house has been broken into. The film takes place in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]] and centers on small-time criminal Bobby O'Grady (Leary), who becomes conflicted due to Charlestown's [[code of silence]]. His loyalty and drive for self-preservation are tested, after two of his close family members (also criminals) are gunned down by their boss.\n\n==Plot summary==\nBobby mentors his young cousin, Seamus ([[Jason Barry]]), into a life of drugs and crime soon after Seamus emigrates from [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]. Bright, conscientious, but notably naive, Seamus finds himself unable to get used to the spontaneous dangers and recklessness of his new life in the United States.\n\nSeamus commits a [[hate crime]] on an [[African American]] youth who had crossed the racial boundary around [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] in the 1990s. Following this and another particularly traumatic incident, Seamus is afraid of further involving himself with Bobby and Bobby's circle of criminal friends. Seamus tells Bobby he wants to return to Dublin.\n\nThe two argue after Seamus blames Bobby for dragging him into a dangerous and \"damaging\" lifestyle which he never wanted. Seamus is killed soon afterward by [[crime boss]] Jackie O'Hara ([[Colm Meaney]]). O'Hara mistakenly believes that Seamus told police about O'Hara's criminal operations. O'Hara had ordered an earlier [[Hitman|hit]] against Bobby and Seamus' cousin Teddy ([[Billy Crudup]]), because Teddy had made a deal with police. The deal concerned a reduced prison sentence.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Denis Leary]] ... Bobby O'Grady\n* [[Colm Meaney]] ... Jackie O'Hara\n* [[Famke Janssen]] ... Katy O'Connor \n* [[Martin Sheen]] ...
