It stars [[Terrence Howard]] as a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] hustler and [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] who faces his aspiration to become a [[Rapping|rapper]]. It also stars [[Anthony Anderson]], [[Taryn Manning]], [[Taraji P. Henson]], [[Paula Jai Parker]], [[Elise Neal]], [[DJ Qualls]] and [[Ludacris]].\n\n''Hustle & Flow'' was released in the United States on July 22, 2005, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed at the performances (particularly those of Howard and Henson), Brewer's script and direction, and the soundtrack. It was also a commercial success, grossing $23.5 million against a production budget of $2.8 million.\n\nThe film received numerous accolades and nominations, and was nominated twice at the [[78th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Howard) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for [[Three 6 Mafia]]'s song \"[[It's Hard out Here for a Pimp]]\", winning the latter and becoming the second hip hop song to win an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], after [[Eminem]]'s \"[[Lose Yourself]].\"\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nDJay is a [[pimp]] and [[drug dealer]] living in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], who is dissatisfied with his life. After reacquainting himself with an old friend and sound technician, Key, DJay decides to make [[hip hop music]].\n\nKey and his sound-mixer friend Shelby help DJay put together several songs in which he expresses the frustrations of struggling to survive in the [[American ghettos|ghetto]]. DJay proves his talent, and his first song appears to have a decent chance of getting local radio play.\n\nThe group experiences setbacks throughout the creative process. DJay must hustle those around him in order to procure equipment and recording time, and Key's relationship with his wife becomes strained. DJay throws out one of his prostitutes, Lexus, along with her infant son, for ridiculing him. DJay's pregnant prostitute, Shug, joins in the creative process, singing [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. The group eventually records several tracks, including \"[[Whoop That Trick]]\" and \"[[It's Hard out Here for a Pimp]]\". After their first recording, DJay gains romantic feelings toward Shug.\n\nDJay's friend Arnel informs him that Skinny Black, a successful Memphis rapper, will be returning for a [[Fourth of July]] party. DJay gains admittance under the pretext of providing [[marijuana]], with the true intention of giving Black his [[demo tape]]. Black is dismissive at first, but DJay successfully persuades him into taking the tape.\n\nBefore leaving the party, DJay discovers that a drunken Black has destroyed his tape. DJay confronts Black who insults him. In a fit of rage, DJay nearly beats Black to death but attempts to resuscitate him. A member of Black's entourage enters the bathroom and pulls out his gun. DJay shoots the man in his arm with Black's gun and escapes.\n\nDJay arrives home to find the police and Black's associates waiting for him. DJay turns himself in and tells prostitute Nola to safeguard his writing pad with his lyrics on it, also placing her in charge of sending his songs to radio stations. He then exchanges a glance with a tearful Shug before a brawl breaks out after one of Black's crew sucker punches him. DJay is charged with assault and possession of a firearm and is sentenced to 11 months in [[prison]].\n\nWhile serving his time, DJay is visited by Key and learns that Nola has successfully gotten radio [[Disc jockeys|DJ]]s to play his songs, which have become local hits. The pair then prepare to discuss their future business plans. Two [[correctional officer]]s ask DJay to listen to their demo. Humbled and flattered, DJay accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as DJay\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Key\n* [[Taryn Manning]] as Nola\n* [[Taraji P. Henson]] as Shug\n*[[DJ Qualls]] as Shelby\n* [[Ludacris]] as Skinny Black\n* [[Paula Jai Parker]] as Lexus\n* [[Elise Neal]] as Yevette\n* [[Juicy J]] as Tigga\n* [[Haystak]] as Mickey\n* [[DJ Paul]] as R.L.\n* [[I-20 (rapper)|I-20]] as Yellow Jacket\n* [[Isaac Hayes]] as Arnel\n\n==Production==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}\n[[Terrence Howard]] initially turned down the role of DJay. He reportedly was attempting to avoid being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a \"pimp\" archetype. However, after recognizing the complexity and depth of the character, he reversed his earlier decision and took on the role.\n\nAs concepts of both hustle and flow are unique to African American culture, it turned out to be nearly impossible to find proper translations for international release of the film. For example, the Russian translation of the title means \"The bustle and the motion\". The Italian title is appended with \"Il colore della musica\" which means \"The color of music\".\n\nThe film experienced many years of near-misses and outright rejection from major studios and potential financiers before finally being backed by its longtime supporter [[John Singleton]]. In the DVD extras Singleton says that he decided at last to put up the money himself because he was exasperated at his friends' not getting what their film deserved.\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 160 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"''Hustle & Flow'' is gritty and redemptive, with a profound sense of place and exciting music.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hustle_and_flow |title=Hustle & Flow (2019)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gives the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hustle-flow |title=Hustle & Flow Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=March 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Boston Globe]]'' said, \"Some will find it chicly inspired, recalling blaxploitation's heyday with its grimy urban realism.
