''Teddy Bear'', along with ''[[The Cruise (1970 film)|The Cruise]]'' ''(Rejs)'', was a reflection of contemporary Polish society using surreal humor to somehow get past the [[Censorship in the Polish People's Republic|censorship]] at the time.

After his wife destroys Rysiek's hard to get passport he is stranded in Warsaw while she's off to London. The circumstances force him to plot a [[Derogatory use of 'Byzantine'|Byzantine]] scheme with support of his equally cunning friend. Their plan involves a movie production as well as tracking down a [[look-alike]] (also played by Tym) to \"borrow\" their passport.\n\nHilarity ensues as Bareja gives the audience a guided tour of the corruption, absurd bureaucracy, pervasive bribery and flourishing black market that pervaded socialism in the [[People's Republic of Poland]].\n\nThe titular (teddy) bear is a nickname given to the main character, but also a big straw-bear used in a corruption scheme. Perhaps playing on the well-established [[Russian Bear]] trope, [[Misha]] is the mascot of the [[1980 Moscow]] [[Olympic Games]], the same year as the film.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Stanislaw Tym|Stanis\u0142aw Tym]] as Ryszard Och\u00f3dzki and Stanis\u0142aw Paluch\n* [[Barbara Burska]] as Irena Och\u00f3dzka\n* [[Krystyna Podleska]] (Christine Paul-Podlasky) as Aleksandra Kozel\n* [[Krzysztof Kowalewski]] as Jan Hochwander\n* [[Bronislaw Pawlik|Bronis\u0142aw Pawlik]] as Stuwa\u0142a\n* [[Ewa Bem]] as herself\n* [[Zofia Czerwinska|Zofia Czerwi\u0144ska]] as Irena Siwna\n* [[Stanislaw Mikulski|Stanis\u0142aw Mikulski]] as \"Captain Ry\u015b\" a.k.a. \"Wujek Dobra Rada\" (\"Uncle Good-Advice\")\n* [[Wojciech Pokora]] as W\u0142odarczyk\n* [[Eugeniusz Priwieziencew]] as a militiaman\n* [[Hanna Skarzanka|Hanna Skar\u017canka]]\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cinema of Poland]]\n*[[List of Polish language films]]\n\n== Sources==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0082755|title=Teddy Bear}}\n* {{Rotten tomatoes|teddybear|Teddy Bear}}\n\n{{Stanis\u0142aw Bareja}}\n\n[[Category:1980 films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stanis\u0142aw Bareja]]\n[[Category:Films set in Warsaw]]\n[[Category:Films set in Poland]]\n[[Category:1980s Polish-language films]]\n[[Category:Polish comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Surrealist films]]"}]}}}}
