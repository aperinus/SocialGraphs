This was Martin's first starring role in a feature film. The film also features [[Bernadette Peters]], [[M. Emmet Walsh]], and [[Jackie Mason]].\n\n==Plot==\nNavin R. Johnson is the white adopted son of black [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]], who grows to adulthood na\u00efvely unaware of his obvious adoption. He stands out in his family not just because of his skin color but because of his utter lack of rhythm when his adoptive family plays spirited blues music. One night, he hears a [[Lawrence Welk |champagne-style rendition]] of \"[[Crazy Rhythm]]\" on the radio and spontaneously begins to dance; he excitedly sees this as a calling and decides to leave for [[St. Louis]], from which the song was broadcast. On the way, he stops at a motel, where a dog wakes him up by barking at his door. Navin thinks the dog is trying to warn of a fire. He wakes up the other hotel guests to rescue them, telling the dog they will name him \"Lifesaver.\"  After everyone realizes it was a false alarm, one of the guests suggests naming the dog \"Shithead.\" Navin takes the dog as his own, indeed naming it Shithead.\n\nNavin gets a job and room at a gas station owned by Harry Hartounian. He is thrilled to find that he is listed in the local phone book, as his name is \"in print\" for the first time. Not long after, a gun-wielding lunatic randomly flips through the phone book and picks \"Johnson, Navin R.\" as his next \"random victim bastard.\" As the madman watches through his rifle scope, waiting for a clear shot, Navin fixes the slippery glasses of a customer, Stan Fox, by adding a handle and a nose brake. Fox offers to split the profits 50/50 with Navin if he can market the invention, then departs. Seizing his chance, the crazed sniper shoots but misses. The lunatic chases Navin to a traveling carnival, where Navin hides out, eventually getting a job with SJM Fiesta Shows as a weight guesser. While employed there, Navin meets an intimidating daredevil biker named Patty Bernstein and has a sexual relationship with her, finally realizing what his \"special purpose\" (his mother's euphemism for his penis) is for. He then meets a woman named Marie and arranges a date with her. Patty confronts them, but Marie knocks her out. While courting, Navin and Marie walk along the beach and sing \"[[Tonight You Belong to Me]]\"; Navin plays the [[ukulele]] and Marie the [[cornet]]. Navin and Marie fall in love, but Marie reluctantly leaves him because of his lack of financial security. She writes a note and slips out while Navin is in the bath. He becomes depressed, telling Shithead to leave and find a better master, then changes his mind after the dog immediately tries to run off.\n\nAt an emotional and financial low, Navin is soon contacted by Stan Fox with exciting news: his glasses invention, now called the Opti-Grab, is selling big and he is entitled to half of the profits. Now extremely rich, he finds and marries Marie, and they buy an extravagant mansion. Their life becomes one of splendor and non-stop partying. However, \"motion-picture director\" [[Carl Reiner]] files a class action lawsuit against Navin and claims that the Opti-Grab caused his eyes to be crossed, and that his resulting poor vision caused the death of a stunt driver in the film he was directing. Over nine million other people with the same vision complaint (including the judge and jury foreman) are awarded a total of $10 million in damages; divided among all litigants, each gets $1.09. Bankrupt and yet again depressed, he yells at Marie for looking at him like he was \"some kind of a jerk, or something\" and walks out, abandoning her and his dog. He winds up on the streets, homeless. His story now told, he resigns himself to a life of misery and memories of Marie. But to his amazement and joy, she suddenly appears, along with Shithead and Navin's family, bringing good news: having carefully invested small sums of money Navin has been sending home, his family has become wealthy. They pick him up off the street, and he and Marie move into the Johnsons' new house\u2014a bigger, yet nearly identical version of their old shack.\n\nThe story ends as the entire family dances on the porch and sings \"[[Pick a Bale of Cotton]]\"; Navin dances along, now having gained perfect rhythm.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Navin R.

In addition there are uncredited appearances by Reiner's son [[Rob Reiner]] as the truck driver who picks up Navin, character actor [[Larry Hankin]] briefly appears as a circus hand.\n\n==Production==\nBy 1977, comedian [[Steve Martin]] was experiencing wild success. He wished to cross over to a film career, believing it promised more longevity.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=188}} Basing his film proposal on a line from his act\u2014\"It wasn't always easy for me; I was born a poor black child\"\u2014he fleshed out his ideas into a series of notes he intended to deliver to studios. With confidence in his budding standup career, he imagined it would not be difficult to break into Hollywood. Instead, he found it more difficult than expected.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=188}} Bill McEuen was acquainted with [[Paramount Pictures]] president [[David Picker]], and passed along his notes, which the studio read carefully. It described a series of odd jobs lead character \"Steve\" would hold in his saga, but Paramount passed on the project.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=189}}\n\nPicker moved to [[Universal Studios]] around this time, and moved the film along with him. Martin was able to pick which director he wanted to work with, and chose [[Carl Reiner]], famous for his work on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=190}}\n\nThe duo met constantly, and the film's title grew out of their conversations. Martin recounts in his memoir:<blockquote>It needs to be something short, yet have the feeling of an epic tale. Like [[Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[The Idiot]]'', but not that. Like ''The Jerk''.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=190}}</blockquote>\n\nMartin wrote the part of \"Marie\" with [[Bernadette Peters]] in mind.<ref>Martin, Frank W.[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20075645,00.html \"The Jerk Made Detractors Eat Crow\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020113428/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20075645,00.html |date=October 20, 2008 }} ''People Magazine'', January 21, 1980</ref> He adapted several bits of his standup act to fit within the film, such as a monologue in which he emotionally exits a scene, remarking \"I don't need anything,\" but nevertheless picking up each object he passes on his way out.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=190}} In co-writing the script with [[Carl Gottlieb]] and [[Michael Elias]], their goal was to provide a laugh on each page of the screenplay.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=191}}\n\nIn shooting the film, Reiner \"ran a joyful set\", according to Martin, with the cast and crew eating lunch together each day.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=192}} Martin's favorite moment of the film, as he detailed in his 2007 memoir ''[[Born Standing Up]]'', was the scene in which he and Peters sing \"Tonight You Belong to Me\". Martin felt the moment was touching, and waited in anticipation at the film's premiere screening in [[St. Louis]]. Unfortunately, much of the audience left during the scene to buy more popcorn.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=192}}\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nA scene in which [[Bill Murray]] was to have made a cameo was cut from the final film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Locke|first=Greg W.|title=The Top 25 Roles Bill Murray Didn't Take|date=26 August 2011|url=http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/|access-date=2015-05-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125110247/http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/|archive-date=25 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray|date=17 February 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/|access-date=25 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray|archive-date=20 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn alternate, comic introduction of Marie (Peters)\u2014near the train ride Navin was running at the carnival was shot.

This scene might have been edited due to a reference to [[Godzilla]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nAnother scene that was cut featured [[Gailard Sartain]] as a Texas oil millionaire who tearfully begs Navin for money to replace the cracked, dried-out leather seats on his private jet.
