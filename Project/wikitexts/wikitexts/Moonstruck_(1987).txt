The film follows Loretta Castorini, a widowed [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] woman who falls in love with her fianc\u00e9's hot-tempered, estranged younger brother.\n\n''Moonstruck'' had a limited theatrical release on December 18, 1987, and was released nationally on January 15, 1988 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. The film earned critical and commercial success. It received six nominations at the [[60th Academy Awards]], winning three for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Cher), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Dukakis), and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (Shanley).\n\n== Plot ==\nThirty-seven year old Loretta Castorini, an Italian-American widow, works as a [[Bookkeeping|bookkeeper]] and lives in [[Brooklyn Heights]] with her family: father Cosmo; mother Rose; and paternal grandfather. Her boyfriend, Johnny Cammareri, proposes to her before leaving for [[Sicily]] to be with his dying mother; Loretta is insistent that they carefully follow tradition as she believes her first marriage was cursed by her failure to do so, resulting in her husband's death after two years. Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny to the wedding. Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement. Cosmo dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to pay for the \"real\" wedding that Loretta insists on, while Rose is pleased that Loretta likes Johnny but does not love him; she believes that one can easily be hurt by a partner whom one loves.\n\nWhen Loretta goes to see Ronny at his bakery, he reveals that he has a wooden prosthetic hand and blames Johnny for his loss in a moment of inattention, after which his fianc\u00e9e left him. Loretta insists that they discuss things in his apartment, where she cooks a meal and then tells him that she believes he is a \"wolf\" who cut off his own hand to escape the trap of a bad relationship. Ronny reacts furiously and passionately, kissing Loretta and then carrying her to his bed, where they make love.\n\nThat evening, Rose's brother Raymond and his wife Rita join Rose, Cosmo, and Cosmo\u2019s father for dinner and they wonder where Loretta is. Raymond recalls a particularly bright moon like the one shining now that he thought long ago was brought to the house when Cosmo was courting Rose. The next morning, Loretta tells Ronny they can never see each other again. Ronny promises to never bother Loretta again if she attends an opera at [[Metropolitan Opera|the Met]] with him. She goes to church to confess her infidelity and afterwards calls at Raymond and Rita's store to close out the cash register. Upon leaving, she impulsively goes to a hair salon and buys a glamorous evening gown and shoes at a boutique next door.\n\nLoretta is deeply moved by her first opera, Puccini's ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]''.  As they leave, she sees her father, Cosmo, together with his girlfriend, Mona, and confronts him. As Loretta is with Ronny, he suggests that they agree that they did not see each other at all. Loretta attempts to return home, but Ronny desperately persuades her into another tryst. That same night, Rose decides to dine alone at a restaurant and sees a college professor, Perry, being dramatically dumped by a female student. Rose invites him to dine with her instead, allowing him to walk her home but refusing to invite him in because she is loyal to her marriage. Later, Johnny unexpectedly returns from Sicily after his mother's \"miraculous\" recovery and arrives at the Castorini house; as Loretta is not there, Rose asks him instead why men chase after women, and agrees that it is because they fear death.\n\nReturning home next morning, Loretta is distressed to learn from Rose that Johnny will be there soon. Ronny arrives, and Rose invites him for breakfast over Loretta's objections. Cosmo and his father emerge from upstairs; Grandpa insists that Cosmo agree to pay for Loretta's wedding. Rose then confronts Cosmo and demands that he end his affair; he is upset but gives in and, at Rose's insistence, also agrees to go to confession. Both reaffirm their love for each other. Raymond and Rita arrive, concerned that Loretta had not deposited the previous day's takings at the bank, and are relieved to learn that she merely forgot and still has the money. When Johnny finally arrives, he breaks off the engagement, superstitiously believing that their marriage would cause his mother's death. Loretta berates Johnny for breaking his promise and throws the engagement ring at him. Seizing the moment, Ronny borrows the ring and asks Loretta to marry him, to which she agrees. The family toasts the couple with champagne and Johnny joins in at Grandpa's urging, since he will now be part of the family after all.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Cher]] as Loretta Castorini\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Ronny Cammareri\n* [[Olympia Dukakis]] as Rose Castorini\n* [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Cosmo Castorini\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Johnny Cammareri\n* [[Julie Bovasso]] as Rita Cappomaggi\n* [[Louis Guss]] as Raymond Cappomaggi\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Perry\n* [[Feodor Chaliapin Jr.]] as Grandpa Castorini\n* [[Anita Gillette]] as Mona\n* [[Leonardo Cimino]] as Felix\n* [[Paula Trueman]] as Lucy\n* Nada Despotovich as Chrissy\n* [[Joe Grifasi]] as Shy Waiter\n* Gina DeAngeles as Old Crone\n* [[Robin Bartlett]] as Barbara\n* [[Helen Hanft]] as Lotte\n* David S.
