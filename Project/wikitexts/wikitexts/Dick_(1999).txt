It is a comic reimagining of the [[Watergate scandal]] which ended the [[President of the United States|presidency]] of [[Richard Nixon]] and features several cast members from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Kids in the Hall (TV series)|The Kids in the Hall]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dick-andrew-fleming_n_5698264|title=9 Things You Really Never Knew About 'Dick'|first=Matthew|last=Jacobs|date=August 27, 2014|website=HuffPost}}</ref> [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] star as Betsy and Arlene, two warm-hearted but unworldly 15-year-old friends, who \u2013 through various arbitrary circumstances \u2013 become the legendary \"[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]\" figure who played a key role in bringing down [[presidency of Richard Nixon|the presidency of Nixon]] (played by [[Dan Hedaya]]). At the time of the movie's release, the real identity of Deep Throat was not yet known to the public.\n\n==Plot==\nBetsy Jobs and Arlene Lorenzo are two sweet-natured but ditzy teenagers living in [[Washington D.C.]] in 1972. Betsy comes from a wealthy [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] family, while Arlene lives with her widowed mother in an apartment in the [[Watergate Hotel|Watergate building]].\n\nOn the night of the Watergate break-in, the girls sneak out of Arlene's to mail a letter to enter a contest to win a date with teen idol singer [[Bobby Sherman]]. They sneak through the parking garage by taping the latch of a door, accidentally causing the break-in to be discovered. Seen by [[G. Gordon Liddy]], he believes they are committing a jewel robbery, so they panic and run. The security guard is startled by the taped door, calls the police, who immediately arrest the burglars.\n\nThe next day, at the [[White House]] on a school tour, they happen across Liddy again. They don't recognize him, but he recognizes them and becomes suspicious. He points them out to [[H. R. Haldeman]], who interrogates them; their conversation (revealing the girls don't think about the president much) is interrupted by a phone call from his wife, and then by [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] himself, who takes Haldeman aside to complain about the bugging operation being fouled up.\n\nThe girls are awestruck at being in the same room as Nixon{{snd}}but more so at being able to play with his dog, which gives him an idea. To keep their silence, he appoints them his official dog-walkers{{snd}}which means they must be admitted repeatedly to the White House. On these visits they accidentally influence major events such as the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] peace process and the Nixon&ndash;[[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] accord, by bringing along cookies that they have inadvertently baked [[marijuana]] into. (Later, when Betsy's brother, Larry, reveals the cookies' \"secret ingredient\" and hears the President ate them, he concludes that this explains Nixon's paranoia.) They become familiar with the Nixon administration's key players, including [[Henry Kissinger]], and accidentally learn the major secrets of the [[Watergate scandal]].\n\nArlene, previously infatuated with Bobby Sherman, now falls equally hard for the president. Just after reading an [[18\u00bd minute gap|{{frac|18|1|2}}-minute]] message of love into his tape recorder, she plays back another part of the tape, hears his coarse, brutal rantings, and realizes his true nature. When they confront Nixon, he fires and threatens them.\n\nThey now reevaluate what they have learned and decide to reveal everything to the \"radical muckraking bastards\" (Nixon's words) at ''[[the Washington Post]]'', [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]]. So they become informants: two 15-year-old girls are the true identity of the famous [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] (Betsy's brother had just been caught watching the [[Deep Throat (film)|film of the same name]]). Woodward and Bernstein{{snd}}portrayed as petty, childish, and incompetent{{snd}}are naturally skeptical of the two girls. To make matters worse, their only piece of [[physical evidence]], a list of names of those involved from the [[Committee to Re-Elect the President]], is eaten by Betsy's dog.\n\nNixon's men realize the girls are a real threat and attempt tactics such as [[bugging]] and [[Undercover operation|undercover agents]] to find out what they know, going so far as to break into Betsy's house and plant an agent as Arlene's mother's boyfriend. Eventually pushed to the limit after being chased by the Watergate [[White House Plumbers|\"plumbers\"]], they decide to take action.\n\nSneaking into Haldeman's house, the girls find and take a crucial [[Nixon tapes|tape recording]]. They give a transcription of it to Woodward and Bernstein (keeping the tape as a \"souvenir\") thus ending Nixon's political career. Nixon finds Arlene's message on his tape and erases it, reasoning that he'd be \"crucified\" if it was perceived that he had an affair with a 15-year-old girl. After his resignation, as his helicopter flies over Betsy's house, the girls hold up a sign with the phrase \"You suck, Dick\", further angering the now ex-president.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Betsy Jobs\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Arlene Lorenzo\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as President Richard \"Dick\" [[Nixon]] \n* [[Bruce McCulloch]] as [[Carl Bernstein]]\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as [[Bob Woodward]]\n* [[Saul Rubinek]] as [[Henry Kissinger]]\n* [[Teri Garr]] as Helen Lorenzo\n* [[Dave Foley]] as [[H.

The idea of using the Watergate scandal came from a real-life experience Longin had with Nixon when her family stayed at the same hotel as Nixon.  As a child, she and a friend pelted Nixon with ice cubes, causing a minor disturbance.  Fleming said that he was surprised at the attempts to rehabilitate Nixon's image, and Longin cited the Watergate scandal as a defining political moment for their generation.  She said she channeled the resulting anger and cynicism into the script.  Several people told the duo that various gags went too far.  Fleming, who believed Nixon got off easily, said they fought to keep everything.  They approached [[Ben Bradlee]] and [[John Dean]] to play themselves, but both declined.<ref name=wp>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1999/08/01/generation-xs-tricky-dick/b5b70d4d-b50d-453d-b9ef-ea3af28dacac/|title=Generation X's Tricky 'Dick'|last=Waxman|first=Sharon|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1999-08-01|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nSony's marketing research indicated teenage girls were the film's biggest demographic, so promotional material focused on Dunst and Williams instead of the political aspects.<ref name=wp/>  ''Dick'' was released in the US on August 4, 1999.<ref name=afi/>  It grossed $2.2 million in its opening weekend, opening at No.&nbsp;12 in 1522 theaters.
