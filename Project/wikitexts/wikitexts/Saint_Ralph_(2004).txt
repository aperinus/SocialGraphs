Its central character is a teenage boy who trains for the 1954 [[Boston Marathon]] in the hope a victory will be the miracle his mother needs to awaken from a coma.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2004 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was given a theatrical release in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\nRalph Walker is a teenager attending a [[Catholic schools in Canada|Catholic school]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]]. His father was killed in [[World War II]] and his mother is hospitalized with an unidentified illness. Ralph is naturally prone to mischief and often finds himself an outcast among his classmates. He tries to emulate the conduct of grown ups, and is caught smoking cigarettes and masturbating by headmaster Father Fitzpatrick.  Already labeled a troublemaker, Ralph is forced to join the school's [[Cross country running|cross country]] team to relieve him of his excess energy.\n\nWhen Ralph's mother falls into a coma, he is told it will take a miracle for her to survive. When running coach Father Hibbert, a former world class marathoner who was forced to quit running when he injured his knee, claims it would be a miracle if a member of his team won the [[Boston Marathon]], Ralph decides to train for it in the hope his victory would fulfill the miracle needed to save his mother's life.\n\nAt first, Ralph cannot even keep up with his teammates in practice. He reads books to learn about running, uses the new techniques, and gradually improves. Father Hibbert decides to train him despite disapproval from Father Fitzpatrick. Ralph begins to win the respect of his classmates, and eventually earns the attention of the local media when he wins a prestigious regional race.\n\nWhen Father Fitzpatrick learns Ralph intends to run the Boston Marathon, he threatens to expel him if he participates, as well as remove Father Hibbert from the priesthood should he try to interfere. Both Ralph and his mentor must then decide how deeply they believe in miracles, and what is possible when a person risks everything without promise of success.\n\nBoth he and Father Hibbert defy Father Fitzpatrick and decide to go to [[Boston]]. Ralph ends up winning second place after a close race with the previous year's winner and gives the medal to his mother who wakes up from her coma.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Adam Butcher]] as Ralph Walker\n*[[Campbell Scott]] as George Hibbert\n*[[Gordon Pinsent]] as Father Fitzpatrick\n*[[Jennifer Tilly]] as Nurse Alice\n*[[Shauna MacDonald (Canadian actress)|Shauna MacDonald]] as Emma Walker\n*[[Tamara Hope]] as Claire Collins\n*[[Michael Kanev]] as Chester Jones\n*[[Chris Ploszczansky]] as Hulk\n*[[Jeff Baxter]] as Cattana\n*[[Daniel Karasik]] as Bolan\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and [[Toronto]].\n\nThe song \"Hallelujah\" by [[Leonard Cohen]] is performed by [[Gord Downie]].\n\nAfter premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival, the film was shown at the [[Portland International Film Festival]], the Festival du Film d'Aventures de Valenciennes and the [[Festival du Film de Paris|Paris Film Festival]] before opening in Canada on April 8, 2005.\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Stephen Holden]] said, \"This crude, inspirational tear-jerker is as sweet as a bowl of instant oatmeal smothered in molasses.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/2005/08/05/movies/05sain.html|title=Saint Ralph - Review - Movies - New York Times|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref> Sean Axmaker of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' thought the \"conventionally heartwarming underdog drama doesn't miss a cliche.\" He continued, \"The climactic race footage is well directed... and the understated period detail adds to the charm, but the route is painfully familiar and the obstacles are as contrived as the clunky performances. The exception is Scott, whose sensitive turn as a priest inspired by Ralph's conviction and commitment gives the film a touch of grace at the cost of revealing McGowan's drab direction of every other actor. Yet there is something inherently rousing in the finale, no matter how hackneyed, as if his conviction ultimately holds its own against the cliches.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/235278_ralph05q.html|title='Saint Ralph' runs a predictable but touching race|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', Marrit Ingman rated the film two stars and called it \"very conventional in its characterizations and narrative.\" He added, \"The movie does have two things going for it (besides Tilly in a nurse\u2019s uniform). One is its brisk, sunny aplomb. It zips right along in cheerful montages and abbreviated scenes, divided by intertitles announcing the feasts of saints. The second is Butcher, who seems to be something like the masculine [[Amanda Bynes]] of Canada: goofy and authentically youthful but remarkably assured onscreen... The film isn't going to catapult Butcher to international stardom, but he holds his own in it and helps to sell its curious logic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid:286060|title=Film Review: Saint Ralph|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Award and nominations==\n*[[Genie Award for Best Motion Picture]] (nominee)\n*[[Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role]] (Adam Butcher, nominee)\n*[[Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role]] (Campbell Scott and Gordon Pinsent, nominees)\n*[[Genie Award for Best Achievement in Costume Design]] (Anne Dixon, nominee)\n*[[Canadian Screenwriting Awards|Canadian Screenwriting Award for Best Feature Film]] (Michael McGowan, '''winner''')<ref>[http://www.wgc.ca/v5/cscs_awards/pastwinners/2005winners.html Writers Guild of Canada website]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*Canadian Society of Cinematographers Award for Best Cinematography in a Theatrical Feature (Rene Ohashi, nominee)\n*[[Directors Guild of Canada]] Award for Outstanding Achievement in Direction of a Feature Film (Michael McGowan, '''winner''') \n*Directors Guild of Canada Award for Outstanding Team Achievement in a Family Feature Film ('''winner''')\n*Directors Guild of Canada Award for Outstanding Achievement in Production Design for a Feature Film (Matthew Davies, nominee) \n*London Canadian Film Festival Audience Award ('''winner''')\n*Paris Film Festival Grand Prix Award ('''winner''')\n*[[Young Artist Award]] for Best International Family Feature Film ('''winner''')\n*Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Leading Young Actor (Adam Butcher, nominee) \n*Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Supporting Young Actor (Michael Kanev, nominee)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0384488|Saint Ralph}}\n\n{{Michael McGowan}}\n\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2000s coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s sports comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Canadian sports comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Canadian coming-of-age comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Boston Marathon]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hamilton, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael McGowan]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Andrew Lockington]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1954]]\n[[Category:2004 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2004 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Films set in Boston]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Toronto]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
