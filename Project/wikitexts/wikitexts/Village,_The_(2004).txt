The villagers have constructed a large barrier of oil lanterns and watchtowers that are constantly staffed. After the funeral of a child, the village Elders deny Lucius Hunt's request for permission to pass through the woods to get medical supplies from the towns. Later, his mother Alice scolds him for wanting to visit the towns, which the villagers describe as wicked. The Elders also appear to have secrets, keeping physical mementos hidden in black boxes, supposedly reminders of the evil and tragedy in the towns they left behind.\n\nAfter Lucius makes an unsanctioned venture into the woods, the creatures leave warnings in the form of splashes of red paint on all the villagers' doors.\n\nIvy Elizabeth Walker, the [[Visual Impairment|blind]] daughter of Chief Elder Edward Walker, informs Lucius that she has strong feelings for him and he returns her affections. They arrange to be married, but Noah Percy, a young man with an apparent [[developmental disability]], stabs Lucius with a knife, because he is in love with Ivy himself. Noah is locked in a room while a decision awaits regarding his fate.\n\nEdward goes against the wishes of the other Elders, agreeing to let Ivy pass through the forest and seek medicine for Lucius. Before she leaves, Edward explains that the creatures inhabiting the woods are actually members of their own community wearing costumes and have continued the legend of monsters in an effort to frighten and deter others from attempting to leave. Two young men are sent to accompany Ivy into the forest, but they abandon her almost immediately, fearful of the creatures. While traveling through the forest, one of the creatures attacks Ivy. She tricks it into falling into a deep hole to its death. The creature is actually Noah wearing one of the costumes, which he discovered under the floorboards of the room where he had been confined after stabbing Lucius. As she travels through the woods, Ivy's parents unlock a box and look at photographs of the elders outside a counseling center, revealing that it is the early 21st century instead of the 19th century.\n\nAfter she climbs over the wall at the woods edge, Ivy encounters a [[park ranger]] driving a [[patrol car]] who is shocked to hear that she has come out of the woods. Ivy gives the ranger a list of medicines that she must acquire.\n\nThe ranger talks to his boss, not mentioning his encounter with Ivy. The village was founded in the late 1970s by Edward Walker, then a professor of [[American History|American history]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Recruiting people he met at a [[grief counseling]] clinic, they join in creating a place where they would live and be protected from any aspect of the outside world. Edward's family fortune purchased a [[wildlife preserve]], built Covington in the middle, funding a ranger corps to make sure no one got in, and even paid off the government to make it a [[no-fly zone]].\n\nThe park ranger retrieves the requested medicine from the ranger station and Ivy returns to the village, unaware of the truth of the situation.\n\nDuring her absence, the Elders secretly open their black boxes, each containing mementos from their lives in the outside world, including items related to their past traumas as crime victims. They gather around Lucius's bed when they hear that Ivy has returned and that she killed one of the monsters. Edward points out to Noah's grieving mother that his death will allow them to continue deceiving the rest of the villagers that there are creatures in the woods.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Ivy Elizabeth Walker\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Lucius Hunt\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Noah Percy\n* [[William Hurt]] as Edward Walker\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Alice Hunt\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as August Nicholson\n* [[Cherry Jones]] as Mrs. Clack\n* [[Celia Weston]] as Vivian Percy\n* [[Frank Collison]] as Victor\n* [[Jayne Atkinson]] as Tabitha Walker\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Kitty Walker\n* [[Fran Kranz]] as Christop Crane\n* Liz Stauber as Beatrice\n* [[Michael Pitt]] as Finton Coin\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Jamison\n* [[M.
