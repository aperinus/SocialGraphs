Having recovered the [[cocaine]] Hudd purchased from them, the detectives return that to the evidence room at their headquarters. When Divinci and Rodriguez find out Hudd was actually a \"deep cover\" DEA agent \u2014 because Hudd's partner, Richard Simms, drops by their precinct for help sniffing out the killers \u2014 they resolve to pin the murder on any likely suspect they can find. The detectives finally frame William McCall, a homeless drunk, by tricking him into confessing to the crime. Needing a witness, Divinci and Rodriguez press stripper Cynthia Webb \u2014 with whom Divinci has been cheating on his wife \u2014 into picking McCall out of a police lineup. It turns out McCall is a physician, missing and presumed dead for years, who hails from a wealthy family; their lawyers are brought in to defend him. At McCall's trial, he is promptly shown to be innocent. The case falls apart and McCall is released. Rodriguez records a conversation with Divinci in which the latter admits to Hudd's killing and McCall's setup. In response, Divinci forces Rodriguez out of the car at gunpoint. Returning to his apartment, Rodriguez is met by his bookie Vic...and by Vic's bodyguard, \"Mr. Cutlass Supreme\". They murder Rodriguez over an outstanding gambling debt. Investigating Rodriguez's death, the police find the damaged tape which contains Divinci's confession. McCall attorney Arthur Baylor questions Webb about Hudd's murder, playing back the plan by Divinci to kill her as a loose end. Webb tells Baylor everything she knows about Divinci's crimes. Divinci hides out in Webb's apartment and shoots her for betraying him. Webb is rushed to the hospital; her gurney is wheeled past ''Doctor'' McCall. Divinci arranges for a limousine ride to the airport. The driver is revealed to be recently-acquitted serial killer Clyde David Dunner, who murders Divinci and then dumps the body in an alley.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Belushi]] as Detective Franklin \"Frank\" Divinci\n* [[Tupac Shakur]] as Detective Jacob \"Jake\" Rodriguez\n* [[James Handy]] as Captain Henderson\n* [[Deborah Rennard]] as Caroline Divinci\n* [[Lela Rochon]] as Cynthia Webb\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as William McCall / Joe Doe\n* Tom Ormeny as Nathan McCall\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Arthur Baylor\n* [[David Paymer]] as Elliot Goff\n* [[Gary Cole]] as DEA Agent Richard Simms\n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as District Attorney Helen Eden\n* [[Terrence C.

We identify, I think, with them anyway to a degree, maybe because they trigger our own built-in guilt. The dialogue crackles with life and energy. There are a lot of colorful characters. My only complaint is that the ending is a little too neat after everything that's gone before. This movie is good enough to deserve a better ending.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://siskelebert.org/?p=3133|title=Seven Years in Tibet, RocketMan, Boogie Nights, Gang Related, Washington Square, 1997|website=siskelebert.org|accessdate=May 15, 2021}}</ref>}}\n\nAbout the movie's reception and box office results, Jim Belushi said: \"Right around that time, when that movie came out, there was a gang related shooting at a movie theater in Los Angeles. That just ruined the opening of that movie. Everyone was afraid to go to the movie theatre, especially with the title Gang Related. Nobody went.
