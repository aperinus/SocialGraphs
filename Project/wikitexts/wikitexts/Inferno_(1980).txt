The plot follows a young man's investigation into the disappearance of his sister, who had been living in a [[New York City]] apartment building that also served as a home for a powerful, centuries-old witch. The cinematography was by [[Romano Albani]], and [[Keith Emerson]] composed the film's [[Film score|musical score]].\n\nA thematic [[sequel]] to ''[[Suspiria]]'' (1977), the film is the second installment of Argento's [[The Three Mothers|Three Mothers trilogy]], though it is the first in the trilogy to explore the idea of the Three Mothers. The long-delayed concluding entry, ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'', was released in 2007. All three films are partially derived from [[Thomas de Quincey]]'s 1845 work ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]'', a collection of [[prose poetry]] in which he proposes the concept of three \"Ladies of Sorrow\" (Mater Lachrymarum, Mater Suspiriorum and Mater Tenebrarum), concurrent with the three [[Moirai|Fates]] and [[Charites|Graces]] in [[Greek mythology]].\n\nUnlike ''Suspiria'', ''Inferno'' received a [[Limited release|very limited theatrical release]], thus unable to match the [[box office]] success of its predecessor. While initial critical response was mostly negative, its reputation has improved considerably over the years. [[Kim Newman]] has called it \"perhaps the most underrated horror movie of the 1980s.\"{{sfn|Newman|1986|pp=219\u2013220}} In 2005, the magazine ''[[Total Film]]'' named ''Inferno'' one of the 50 greatest horror films of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/shock-horror-1 |title=Shock Horror! | last=Graham |first=Jamie |date=10 October 2005 |work=[[Total Film]] |access-date=5 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nRose Elliot, a poet living alone in [[New York City]]'s [[Upper West Side]], purchases a book from an antiques dealer, titled ''The Three Mothers''. The book, written by an alchemist named Varelli, tells of three evil sisters who rule the world with sorrow, tears, and darkness, and dwell inside separate homes that had been built for them by the alchemist. Mater Suspiriorum, the Mother of Sighs, lives in [[Freiburg]]. Mater Lachrymarum, the Mother of Tears, lives in [[Rome]], and Mater Tenebrarum, the Mother of Darkness, lives in New York. Rose suspects that she is living in Mater Tenebrarum's building, and writes to her brother Mark, a music student in [[Rome]], urging him to visit her. Using the clues provided in the book, Rose searches the cellar of her building and discovers a hole in the floor which leads to a water-filled ballroom. She accidentally drops her keys and enters the water to find them. After she reclaims the keys, a putrid corpse rises from the depths, frightening her. Rose manages to swim out and flee.\n\nIn Rome, Mark attempts to read Rose's letter during class. He is distracted by the intense gaze of a beautiful student, who leaves suddenly; Mark follows, leaving the letter behind. His friend Sara picks up the letter, and later reads it. Horrified by the letter's contents, she takes a taxi to a library and finds a copy of ''The Three Mothers''. Trying to find her way out, Sara becomes lost in the library basement and finds a room filled with boiling cauldrons. Sara is attacked there by a monstrous figure who recognizes the book. She throws the book to the ground and escapes.\n\nReturning to her home, she phones Mark telling him to come and asks a neighbour, Carlo, to keep her company. The lights go out and both Sara and Carlo are stabbed to death by a gloved killer. Mark discovers the bodies and two torn fragments from Rose's letter. After the police arrive, he walks out of Sara's apartment and sees a taxi slowly driving by. In the back seat of the vehicle is the music student, staring at him intently. Mark telephones Rose and promises to visit, but the phone call is cut short. Rose sees two shadowy figures preparing to enter her apartment. She leaves through a back door, but is followed. Running into a decrepit laboratory, she is grabbed by a clawed assailant and [[guillotine]]d with the glass of a broken window.\n\nArriving in New York, Mark goes straight to Rose's building, where he meets Carol, the concierge, and some of the residents, including a nurse who cares for elderly Professor Arnold, a wheelchair user who cannot speak. Mark encounters the sickly Countess Elise De Longvalle Adler, who tells him that Rose has disappeared. After the two find blood on the carpet outside Rose's room, Mark follows the stains. Inhaling a strange odour, he becomes ill and falls unconscious. Elise sees a black-robed figure dragging Mark away, but the figure stops and gives chase to Elise. The figure eventually finds her swarmed with rabid cats in a room and stabs her to death. Mark staggers to the apartment building's lobby where Carol and the nurse put him to bed.\n\nThe following morning, Mark asks Kazanian, the antique dealer who sold Rose ''The Three Mothers'', about his sister's whereabouts. However, the man provides no information. That night, Kazanian drowns several cats in a [[Central Park]] pond and falls into the water. Hundreds of rats from a nearby drain crawl over him, gnawing his flesh. A hot dog vendor hears Kazanian's cries for help and rushes over, but proceeds to kill him with a knife.\n\nMore strange deaths occur in the building, when Carol and Elise's butler, John, plots to take advantage of the Countess' death by stealing her valuables. A shocked Carol finds John's corpse in Elise's apartment, and drops a lit candle which starts a fire. Attempting to put out the flames, she becomes entangled in burning draperies and falls from a window to her death.\n\nMark uses the final clue from Rose's letter to discover that beneath each floor is a secret crawl space. He follows hidden passages to a suite of rooms where he finds Professor Arnold who reveals, via an electronic voice generator, that he is in fact Varelli. He tries to kill Mark with a hypodermic injection. During the struggle, Varelli's neck is caught in his vocal apparatus, choking him. Mark frees him, only to be told that he is still being watched as Varelli dies. Mark follows a shadowy figure to a lavishly furnished chamber, where he finds Varelli's nurse. Laughing maniacally, she reveals to him that she is Mater Tenebrarum. She vanishes, but re-emerges through a mirror as [[Death (personification)|Death personified]]. However, the fire that has consumed much of the building enables Mark to escape from the witch's den. Debris crashes down on the fiend, destroying her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Leigh McCloskey]] as Mark Elliott\n* [[Irene Miracle]] as Rose Elliott\n* [[Eleonora Giorgi]] as Sara\n* [[Daria Nicolodi]] as Elise De Longvalle Adler\n* [[Sacha Pito\u00ebff]] as Kazanian\n* [[Alida Valli]] as Carol (dubbed by [[Carolyn De Fonseca]])\n* [[Veronica Lazar]] as The Nurse/[[The Three Mothers#Mater Tenebrarum|Mater Tenebrarum]]\n* [[Gabriele Lavia]] as Carlo\n* [[Feodor Chaliapin, Jr.]] as Prof. Arnold/Dr. Varelli\n* [[Leopoldo Mastelloni]] as John\n* [[Ania Pieroni]] as the music student/[[The Three Mothers#Mater Lachrymarum|Mater Lachrymarum]]\n* James Fleetwood as Cook \n* Rosario Rigutini as Man \n* Ryan Hilliard as Shadow \n* [[Paolo Paoloni]] as Music teacher \n* [[Fulvio Mingozzi]] as Taxi driver \n* Luigi Lodoli as Bookbinder\n* Rodolfo Lodi as Old man\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nIn 1977, ''Suspiria'' had been an unexpectedly big [[box office]] hit for [[20th Century Fox]], released in the U.S. under their \"International Classics\" banner. Capitalizing on the commercial success of the film, Argento and Daria Nicolodi, who had co-written the screenplay, announced that ''Suspiria'' was only the first of a proposed trilogy which they referred to as \"The Three Mothers\" trilogy.<ref name=\"Lucas2\">{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=Tim |title=Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark |publisher=Video Watchdog |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-9633756-1-2}}</ref> The basic concept of all three films is derived from Thomas de Quincey's ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]'', a sequel to his ''[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]]''. A [[prose poem]] of the book entitled \"Levana and Our Ladies of Sorrow\", details how, just as there are three Fates and three Graces, there are also three Sorrows: ''Mater Lachrymarum'' (The Lady of Tears), ''Mater Suspiriorum'' (The Lady of Sighs) and ''Mater Tenebrarum'' (The Lady of Darkness).<ref name=\"McDonagh\">{{cite book |last=McDonagh |first=Maitland |title=Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento |publisher=Citadel Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-9517012-4-X}}</ref> As the title suggests, ''Suspiria'' focused on Mater Suspiriorum; the evil sister featured in ''Inferno'' is Mater Tenebrarum. The concluding chapter of Argento's trilogy, ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007), is about Mater Lachrymarum.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vivarelli |first=Nick |date=19 October 2006 |title=Argento toplines 'Mother of Tears' |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=https://variety.com/article/VR1117952237.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |access-date=15 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhen Argento proposed ''Inferno'' as his follow-up to ''Suspiria'', 20th Century Fox agreed to co-finance the production. The film was budgeted at [[United States dollar|USD]] $3,000,000, and producer Claudio Argento secured additional co-production money from Italian and German consortia.<ref name=\"Lucas2\"/>\n\nNicolodi devised the original story concept but received no on-screen credit for her work on the screenplay. Nicolodi explained that she did not seek credit because \"having fought so hard to see my humble but excellent work in ''Suspiria'' recognized (up until a few days before the premi\u00e8re I didn't know if I would see my name in the film credits), I didn't want to live through that again, so I said, 'Do as you please, in any case, the story will talk for me because I wrote it.'\"<ref name=\"Nicolodi\">{{cite book |title=Spaghetti Nightmares |publisher=Fantasma Books |year=1996 |isbn=0-9634982-7-4}}</ref> Working from Nicolodi's original story notes, Argento wrote the screenplay while staying in a New York hotel room with a view of [[Central Park]].<ref name=\"Lucas2\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe filming of ''Inferno'' took place mainly on interior studio sets in Rome,<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080923/locations |title=Inferno (1980) - Filming locations |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date=15 August 2012}}</ref> but a short amount of time was also set aside for location shooting in New York, including Central Park.<ref name=\"McDonagh\"/><ref name=\"imdb.com\"/> Sacha Pito\u00ebff's death scene was filmed on location in Central Park during the summer of 1979. [[William Lustig]], who was credited as the film's Production Coordinator, recalled:\n\n{{blockquote|They filmed the actor carrying a bag that contained some kind of moving mechanism, to make it look like it was full of cats. He walked into the lake, pushed the bag underwater, and fell in. At that point, some phony mechanical rats were attached to him for closeups.

All of the stuff with the live rats was shot back in Europe.<ref name=\"Lucas2\"/>}}\n\nDuring the film's production, Argento became stricken with a severe case of [[hepatitis]]---and had to direct some sequences while lying on his back. At one point, the illness became so painful that he was bedridden for a few days; filming was then restricted to [[second unit]] work, some of which was done by Mario Bava.<ref name=\"Lucas2\"/> Argento has called ''Inferno'' one of his least favorite of all his films, as his memories of the movie are tainted by his recollection of the painful illness he suffered.<ref name=\"Lucas2\"/>\n\n=== Design and effects ===\nArgento invited his [[mentor]], [[Mario Bava]], to provide some of the [[compositing|optical effects]], [[matte painting]]s and trick shots for the film.<ref name=\"Lucas2\"/> Some of the cityscape views seen in ''Inferno'' were actually tabletop skyscrapers built by Bava out of milk cartons covered with photographs.<ref name=\"Lucas2\"/> The apartment building that Rose lived in was in fact only a partial set built in the studio\u2014it was a few floors high and had to be visually augmented with a small sculpture constructed by Bava. This sculpture was set aflame toward the end of production and served as the burning building seen in the climax.<ref name=\"Lucas2\"/>\n\nBava also provided some [[second unit]] direction for the production. [[Maitland McDonagh]] has suggested that Bava had his hand in the celebrated watery ballroom scene,<ref name=\"McDonagh\"/> but that sequence was shot in a water tank by Gianlorenzo Battaglia, without any optical effects work at all.<ref name=\"Lucas2\"/> Bava's son, [[Lamberto Bava]], was the film's [[assistant director]].<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222000104/http://www.allmovie.com/movie/inferno-v24825 |access-date=24 October 2021 |last=Legare |first=Patrick |archive-date=22 December 2012 |work=AllMovie |title=Inferno (1980) |url=http://www.allmovie.com:80/movie/inferno-v24825 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe film's fiery final sequence was shot without a [[stunt performer]] filling in for Leigh McCloskey. After the production's principal photography had been completed, the film's producer, Claudio Argento, asked if McCloskey would be willing to perform the [[stunt]]work himself, as the stuntman hired for the job had broken his leg. The producer assured the actor: \"It'll be absolutely safe\". The actor agreed, and when he walked onto the set the following day he observed \"three rows of plexiglass in front of everything and everyone is wearing [[hard hat]]s.

In an interview with Maitland McDonagh, Argento speculated that Fox's decision was made due to an abrupt change in management at the studio that left ''Inferno'' and several dozen other films in limbo as a result of them having been greenlighted by the previous management.<ref name=\"McDonagh\"/> The movie sat on the shelf for five years and was released straight to [[VHS]] in 1985 via the studio's [[CBS/Fox Video|Key Video]] subsidiary.

Several reviewers expressed disappointment, comparing the film unfavorably to the much more bombastic ''Suspiria''. In a review that was later reprinted in McDonagh's critically acclaimed ''Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento'' (1994), ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said ''Inferno'' was a \"lavish, no-holds-barred witch story whose lack of both logic and technical skill are submerged in the sheer energy of the telling\", then complained that the film \"fails mainly because it lacks restraint in setting up the terrifying moment, using close-ups and fancy camera angles gratuitously and with no relevance to the story.\"<ref name=\"McDonagh\"/> Reviewing the film during its brief theatrical release in 1986, Nina Darnton of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted, \"The movie's distinguishing feature is not the number or variety of horrible murders, but the length of time it takes for the victims to die. This is a technique that may have been borrowed from Italian [[opera]], but without the music, it loses some of its panache. The film{{nbsp}}... is shot in vivid colors, at some striking angles, and the background music is [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] rather than [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. But the script and acting are largely routine.\"<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> However, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' described the film as \"the stuff of all our worst dreams and nightmares and a tour de force from Italian director Dario Argento{{nbsp}}...
