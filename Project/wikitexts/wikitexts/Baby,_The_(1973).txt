She is assigned to a new case: the eccentric and mysterious Wadsworth family. She quickly reveals that she has a special interest in the family's youngest member, a seemingly [[Mental retardation|mentally impaired]] adult man in his 20s who does not have a name and is called only \"Baby.\" Mrs. Wadsworth has been extremely overprotective of him ever since his father left, shortly after his birth; she will not let another caregiver interfere. The family's life revolves around Baby's care and they are dependent upon Baby's disability payments as their main source of income.\n\nAnn wants to work with Baby, who still acts and is treated like an infant by his mother and two sisters, thinking that with the proper treatment he might begin to behave more appropriately for his age group. She soon discovers that Baby's infant-like state is not caused by any physical or mental conditions but because of the Wadsworth clan's profound neglect and abuse. Baby is never permitted to speak, walk or do things for himself and is forced to both wear and use diapers. He is punished by being beaten or restrained, and is even shocked with an [[Cattle prod|electric cattle prod]] whenever he attempts to try to break out of the baby role. Baby has been forced to remain in his state of perpetual dependency and infantilism since his actual infancy.\n\nThe Wadsworths finally grow tired of Ann's meddling and try to dispose of her during a party, but Ann manages to escape, stealing Baby. Ann keeps Baby in her care at her house rather than turning him over to a professional facility. Eventually, goaded by pictures that Ann sent of Baby doing \"adult\" things such as standing, the Wadsworths break in to Ann's home with murderous intent. They fail to steal Baby back, however, as Ann\u2014with the help of her mother-in-law\u2014kills them all. She stabs Baby's two sisters, then buries Mrs. Wadsworth alive (alongside the corpses of her daughters) beneath the floor of a swimming pool that Ann had been building in her yard.\n\nIn the end, Ann's interests in obtaining Baby are revealed to have not been as pure-hearted as they seemed. Now that she has him, she no longer wants to rescue or rehabilitate him; she sought him only so he could be a playmate for her husband, who was left with the mental capacity of an infant after his accident. Thus, under Ann's care, Baby will remain trapped in his state of dependency and infancy, but under the kinder care of Ann and her mother-in-law, with Ann's husband as his \"brother.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Anjanette Comer]] as Ann Gentry\n* [[Ruth Roman]] as Mrs. Wadsworth\n* [[Marianna Hill]] as Germaine Wadsworth\n* [[Susanne Zenor|Suzanne Zenor]] as Alba Wadsworth\n* [[Tod Andrews]] as Doctor\n* [[Michael Pataki]] as Dennis\n* Beatrice Manley Blau as Judith\n* Erin O'Reilly as Babysitter\n* Don Mallon as Roger\n* Joseph Bernard\n* [[Virginia Vincent]]\n* David Mooney (credited as David Manzy) as Baby<ref>{{cite web |title=The Baby |work=AFI Catalog |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=54858 |access-date=May 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nScotia International released the film in March 1973 in a limited theatrical release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmfanatic.org/reviews/?p=1834|title=FilmFanatic.org|access-date=10 January 2015}}</ref> [[Image Entertainment]] released the film in 2000 on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]].<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Baby-VHS-Anjanette-Comer/dp/6305701954 Amazon.com: The Baby VHS]</ref>\n\n''The Baby'' was released on Blu-ray and DVD with a transfer from the original negative by [[Severin Films]] in 2011.<ref>http://www.severin-films.com/2011/01/04/two-classic-slashers-one-of-the-most-depraved-films-of-the-70/ {{Dead link|date=February 2022}}</ref> It was then released again by [[Arrow Films]] in 2018.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{expand section|date=June 2018}}\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93%, based on 15 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 7.26/10.<ref name=\"rottomatoes\">{{cite web |title=The Baby (1973) - Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_baby1973? |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Fandango Media |access-date=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n''TV Guide'' awarded the film three out of five stars, calling it \"Competently directed\", and stated \"despite its occasional lapses into genuine bad taste is fairly effective and contains a truly surprising twist ending.\"<ref name=\"tvguidereview\">{{cite web |title=The Baby - Movie Reviews and Movie Ratings |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-baby/review/101605/ |website=TV Guide.com |publisher=TV Guide Staff |access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref> Dennis Schwartz from ''Ozus' World Movie Reviews'' rated the film a grade B, stating that the film managed to hold attention throughout its duration, and contained a genuinely surprising twist ending, but criticized the film's performances as being \"over-the-top\", as well as its use of footage of mentally disabled children for exploitation.<ref name=\"schwartz14\">{{cite web |last1=Schwartz |first1=Dennis |title=baby |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/baby.html |website=Sover.net |publisher=Dennis Schwartz |access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref> Brett Gallman from ''Oh the Horror'' commended the film's strong performances, twist ending, and genuinely disturbing scenes; while criticizing the film for being \"plodding and listless\".<ref name=\"gallman11\">{{cite web |last1=Gallman |first1=Brett |title=Horror Reviews - Baby, The (1973) |url=http://www.oh-the-horror.com/page.php?id=853 |website=Oh the Horror.com |publisher=Brett Gallman |access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of American films of 1973]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{AFI film|54858|The Baby}}\n* {{Allmovie|3556|The Baby}}\n* {{IMDb title|0069754|The Baby}}\n* {{Rotten tomatoes|the_baby1973|The Baby}}\n\n{{Ted Post}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baby}}\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:1973 horror films]]\n[[Category:1973 independent films]]\n[[Category:1970s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ted Post]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films about child abuse]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Gerald Fried]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
