The film was directed by [[Marcos Siega]], written by Daniel Taplitz and [[Kathy Gori]], and was shot in [[Coquitlam]] and [[Squamish, British Columbia]].\n\n== Plot ==\nFrank Allen is a professional speaker who lectures on time management. He lives by example: perfectly maximizing his efficiency through scheduling and planning his own life down to the minute. He dearly loves his wife, Susan, and their young daughter, Jesse.\n\nOn the day of an important seminar that could be his major break on the corporate lecture circuit, Susan changes their clocks by 10 minutes, to give him time to run a meaningless errand for her on this important day, but she moves them the wrong way. From missing the ferry to the career-damaging fact that he then arrives late to his lecture on time management, Frank experiences an off day. He loves his wife so much that, when the beautiful Paula crashes his hotel room, strips down and jumps on him, Frank excuses himself and heads home in the middle of the night.\n\nWhile driving home through the night he sees a pregnant woman, Nancy, having contractions and gives the stranger a lift. At the hospital, Frank is asked to fill out some paper work. He mistakenly puts his own information down and the nurses at the hospital assume he is the father.\n\nBefore Frank arrives home, a nurse from the hospital calls attempting to reach \"the father\". Susan instantly believes it is Frank's baby and that he is cheating on her and leading a double life. When Frank arrives home, she refuses to let him clear up the misunderstanding and throws him out of the house within moments. Her reaction through the next few days remains over the top, refusing to talk to Frank and only allowing him to see Jesse after school.\n\nLeft with no choice but to provide scientific proof to Susan, Frank sees a doctor for a paternity test, but receives the diagnosis that he was never able to reproduce to begin with, since he has [[Klinefelter's syndrome]]. The undeniable truth about Jesse and, thus, Susan's own infidelity devastates Frank - but also explains why Susan so instantly presupposed that Frank was a cheater, treating him with unforgiving disdain and refusing to let him even try to clarify the situation.\n\nA few days later, Nancy brings her baby to the Allens' house in hopes of thanking Frank for his kindness, finding only Susan at home. Nancy soon clears up the misunderstanding. Susan turns on a dime, ignoring her atrocious behaviour of the past few days and expecting Frank to simply come home, acting as if she is the one who has forgiven him. The damage is done, however, as Frank realizes that he was the only one in the relationship who was faithful, and goes through a withdrawal as he tries to comprehend how his daughter could not be his and how wrong his life turned out when he believed that he has always stayed straight and narrow.\n\nAfter giving a life-changing speech about living on whim at his own time management lecture, he decides to live his life based on chance from that moment on. He starts his reformed outlook on life with the simple idea of possibility and randomness by basing his decisions on shuffling three index cards with written options and choosing one at random.\n\nHe goes on to have a one night stand with the woman he met at the bar but he\u2019s too drunk to perform.\n\nHe realizes that Buddy is the father of his child and plots to kill Buddy. He lures him to the lake and try to kill him but they both fall into the lake and buddy saves Frank.\n\nBuddy backs off and Frank realizes that he loves his family and forgives his wife and goes back to them.\n\nIn present day the groom realizes that he loves the daughter and decides to get married.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Frank Allen\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Susan Allen\n* [[Stuart Townsend]] as Buddy Endrow\n* [[Sarah Chalke]] as Paula Crowe\n* [[Mike Erwin]] as Ed\n* [[Constance Zimmer]] as Peg the Teacher\n* [[Matreya Fedor]] as Jesse Allen (7 years)\n* [[Elisabeth Harnois]] as Jesse Allen\n* [[Chris William Martin]] as Damon\n* [[Jovanna Huguet]] as Maid of Honor\n* [[Christopher Jacot]] as Simon / Best Man\n* [[Alessandro Juliani]] as Ken\n* [[Jocelyne Loewen]] as Pregnant Nancy\n\n== Reception ==\n<!-- === Box office === -->\n<!-- === Critical response === -->\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 31% based on reviews from 59 critics.
