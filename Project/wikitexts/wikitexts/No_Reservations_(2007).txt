The screenplay by [[Carol Fuchs]] is an adaptation of an original script by [[Sandra Nettelbeck]], which served as the basis for the 2001 [[Cinema of Germany|German film]] ''[[Mostly Martha (film)|Mostly Martha]]'', and revolves around a hard-edged chef whose life is turned upside down when she decides to take in her young niece following a tragic accident that killed her sister. [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Bob Balaban]], and [[Jenny Wade (actress)|Jenny Wade]] co-star, with [[Br\u00edan F. O'Byrne]], [[Lily Rabe]], and [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]]\u2014appearing in her first [[feature film]]\u2014playing supporting roles.\n\nThe film received a mixed reception by critics, who found it \"predictable and too melancholy for the genre\", resulting in a 42% overall approval rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Upon its opening release on July 27, 2007, in the United States and Canada, ''No Reservations'' became a moderate commercial success: The film grossed $12 million in its opening weekend, eventually grossing over $43 million at the domestic box-office and over $92 million worldwide. Breslin was nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] for her performance.\n\n==Plot==\nKate Armstrong is the head chef at the trendy 22 Bleecker Street Restaurant in Manhattan\u2019s [[West Village]]. She runs her kitchen at a rapid pace as she coordinates the making and preparation of all the fantastic meals, and personally displays the food to perfection on every dish.\n\nKate intimidates everyone around her, including her boss Paula, who sends her to therapy. She hates to leave the kitchen when a customer wants to compliment her on one of her special dishes; however, she shoots out of the kitchen in an instant when a customer insults her cooking.\n\nWhen Kate's sister Christine is killed in a car accident, her nine-year-old niece, Zoe, must move in with her. Kate is devastated by her sister's death and with all of her problems, Paula decides to hire a new sous chef to join the staff, Nick Palmer, who is a rising star in his own right and could be the head chef of any restaurant he pleased. Nick, however, wants to work under Kate.\n\nThe atmosphere in the kitchen is somewhat chaotic as Kate feels increasingly threatened by Nick as time goes on due to his style of running her kitchen. He loves to listen to opera while he cooks and also make the staff laugh. Kate also finds herself strangely attracted to Nick, whose uplifting personality has not only affected her staff but Zoe as well, who has been coming to work with her and bonded with him.\n\nWith all that is happening in Kate's life, the last thing she would want is to fall in love with this man, as she has pushed away all others prior. Nevertheless, there is chemistry between them that only flourishes with their passion for cooking. Yet life hits her hard when Paula offers Nick the job of head chef, rather than Kate.\n\nIn the end, Kate allows herself to become vulnerable and tear down the walls she has built throughout her life so that she and Nick could start fresh. The movie concludes with Zoe, Nick, and Kate having opened their own bistro.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Kate Armstrong\n*[[Aaron Eckhart]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Palmer\n*[[Abigail Breslin]] as Zoe\n*[[Patricia Clarkson]] as Paula\n*[[Jenny Wade]] as Leah Scott\n*[[Bob Balaban]] as Therapist\n*[[Br\u00edan F.

Make no mistake: ''No Reservations'' is a factory-sealed romantic comedy ... But the emotional details of Kate, Nick and Zoe's journey are surprising, honest and life-size, and the film's determination to present their predicament sympathetically, without appealing to retrograde ideals of femininity and motherhood, makes it notable, and in some ways unique.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=If You Can't Stand the Analysis of Work and Parenthood, Get Out of the Kitchen|author=Seitz, Matt Zoller|date=July 27, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=E8}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' stated, \"The movie is focused on two kinds of chemistry: of the kitchen, and of the heart.

Scott Hicks' work cuts both ways, creating a warm cocoon that fosters engagement with the well-drawn characters while at the same time steering the material in softer-than-necessary directions and refraining from peeking any deeper into the main characters to suggest what makes them tick.
