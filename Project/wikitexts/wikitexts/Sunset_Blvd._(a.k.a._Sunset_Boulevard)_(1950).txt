It was named after a [[Sunset Boulevard|major street]] that runs through [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], the center of the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]].\n\nThe film stars [[William Holden]] as Joe Gillis, a struggling [[screenwriter]], and [[Gloria Swanson]] as Norma Desmond, a former [[silent-film]] star who draws him into her demented fantasy world, where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. [[Erich von Stroheim]] plays Max von Mayerling, her devoted butler, and [[Nancy Olson]], [[Jack Webb]], [[Lloyd Gough]], and [[Fred Clark]] appear in supporting roles. Director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and [[gossip columnist]] [[Hedda Hopper]] play themselves, and the film includes [[cameo appearance]]s by leading silent-film actors [[Buster Keaton]], [[H. B. Warner]], and [[Anna Q. Nilsson]].\n\nPraised by many [[Film critic|critics]] when first released, ''Sunset Boulevard'' was nominated for 11 [[Academy Awards]] (including nominations in [[List of films with all four Academy Award acting nominations|all four acting categories]]) and won three. It is often ranked among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest movies ever made]]. As it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] in 1989, ''Sunset Boulevard'' was included in the first group of films selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> In 1998, it was ranked number 12 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the [[AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Movies|100 best American films]] of the 20th century, and in 2007, it was 16th on their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10th Anniversary list]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAt a mansion on [[Sunset Boulevard]], a group of police officers and photographers discover the body of Joe Gillis, floating face down in the swimming pool. In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Joe relates the events leading to his death.\n\nSix months earlier, Joe was a down-on-his-luck [[Screenwriting|screenwriter]], trying to interest [[Paramount Pictures]] in a story he submitted. [[Script coverage|Script reader]] Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it, unaware that Joe is listening. Later, while fleeing from [[repossession]] men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion inhabited by forgotten [[silent film]] star Norma Desmond. Learning that Joe is a writer, Norma asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about [[Salome]]. She plans to play the role herself in her return to the screen. Joe finds her script abysmal but flatters her into hiring him as a [[script doctor]].\n\nMoved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe sees that Norma refuses to accept that her fame has evaporated, and learns that her butler Max secretly writes the fan letters she receives. At her New Year's Eve party, he realizes she has fallen in love with him. Joe tries to let her down gently, but Norma slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe visits his friend Artie Green and again meets Betty, who thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential. When he phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Joe returns to Norma and they become lovers.\n\nNorma has Max deliver the edited ''Salome'' script to her former director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] at Paramount. She starts getting calls from Paramount executive Gordon Cole but refuses to speak to anyone except DeMille. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to Paramount in her 1929 [[Isotta Fraschini Tipo 8A|Isotta Fraschini]]. DeMille welcomes her affectionately and treats her with great respect, tactfully evading her questions about her script. Max learns that Cole merely wants to rent her unusual car for a film.\n\nPreparing for her imagined comeback, Norma undergoes rigorous beauty treatments. Joe secretly works nights at Betty's office room, collaborating on an original screenplay. His moonlighting is found out by Max, who reveals that he was a respected film director who discovered Norma, made her a star, and was her first husband. After she divorced him, he abandoned his career to become her servant.\n\nNorma discovers a manuscript with Joe's and Betty's names on it and phones Betty, insinuating that Joe is not the man he seems. Joe, overhearing, invites Betty to see for herself. When she arrives, he pretends he is satisfied being a [[gigolo]]. However, after she tearfully leaves, he packs for a return to his old [[Ohio]] newspaper job. He bluntly informs Norma there will be no comeback; her fan mail comes from Max, and she has been forgotten. He disregards Norma's threat to kill herself and the gun she shows him to back it up. As Joe leaves the house, Norma shoots him three times, and he falls into the pool.\n\nThe flashback ends. The house is filled with police and reporters. Norma, having lost touch with reality amid her arrest, believes the [[newsreel]] cameras are there to film ''Salome''. Max and the police play along. Max sets up a scene for her and calls, \"Action!\" As the cameras roll, Norma descends her grand staircase and makes an impromptu speech about how happy she is to be making a film again, ending with the film's iconic line, \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[William Holden]] as Joe Gillis\n* [[Gloria Swanson]] as Norma Desmond\n* [[Erich von Stroheim]] as Max von Mayerling\n* [[Nancy Olson]] as Betty Schaefer\n* [[Fred Clark]] as Sheldrake, film producer\n* [[Lloyd Gough]] as Morino, Joe's agent\n* [[Jack Webb]] as Artie Green\n* [[Franklyn Farnum]] as undertaker\n* [[Larry J.

The film workers lived modestly in the growing neighborhood, but during the 1920s, profits and salaries rose to unprecedented levels. With the advent of the [[star system (film)|star system]], luxurious homes noted for their often incongruous grandeur were built in the area.\n\nAs a young man living in [[Berlin]] in the 1920s, [[Billy Wilder]] was interested in American culture, with much of his interest fueled by the country's films. In the late 1940s, many of the grand Hollywood houses remained, and Wilder, then a Los Angeles resident, found them to be a part of his everyday world. Many former stars from the silent era still lived in them, although most were no longer involved in the film business. Wilder wondered how they spent their time now that \"the parade had passed them by\" and began imagining the story of a star who had lost her celebrity and box-office appeal.<ref name=\"perry\">Perry, p. ??</ref>\n\nThe character of Norma Desmond mirrors aspects of the twilight years of several real-life faded silent-film stars, such as the reclusive existences of [[Greta Garbo]], [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Pola Negri]] and the mental disorders of [[Mae Murray]], [[Valeska Surratt]] and [[Clara Bow]]. [[Dave Kehr]] has asserted that [[Norma Talmadge]] is \"the obvious if unacknowledged source of Norma Desmond, the grotesque, predatory silent movie queen\" of the film.<ref>{{cite news | first=Dave | last=Kehr | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/movies/homevideo/14kehr.html | title=An Independent Woman, Nobly Suffering in Silents | work=[[The New York Times]]| date= March 11, 2010 | access-date= November 19, 2011}}</ref> The most common analysis of the character's name is that it is a combination of the names of silent film actress [[Mabel Normand]] and director [[William Desmond Taylor]], a close friend of Normand's who was murdered in 1922 in a never-solved case sensationalized by the press.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Gloria Swanson & Billy Wilder - ca. 1950.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Billy Wilder]] ]]\nWilder and Brackett began working on a script in 1948, but the result did not completely satisfy them. In August 1948, [[D. M. Marshman Jr.]], formerly a writer for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', was hired to help develop the storyline after Wilder and Brackett were impressed by a critique he provided of their film ''[[The Emperor Waltz]]'' (1948). In an effort to keep the full details of the story from [[Paramount Pictures]] and avoid the restrictive [[censorship]] of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Breen Code]], they submitted the script a few pages at a time. The Breen Office insisted certain lines be rewritten, such as Gillis's \"I'm up that creek and I need a job,\" which became \"I'm over a barrel. I need a job.\" Paramount executives thought Wilder was adapting a story called ''A Can of Beans'' (which did not exist) and allowed him relative freedom to proceed as he saw fit. Only the first third of the script was written when filming began in early May 1949, and Wilder was unsure how the film would end.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n<blockquote>The fusion of writer-director Billy Wilder's biting humor and the classic elements of film noir make for a strange kind of comedy, as well as a strange kind of film noir. There are no belly laughs here, but there are certainly strangled giggles: at the pet chimp's midnight funeral, at Joe's discomfited acquiescence to the role of gigolo; at Norma's [[Mack Sennett]]-style \"entertainments\" for her uneasy lover; and at the ritualized solemnity of Norma's \"waxworks\" card parties, which feature such former luminaries as Buster Keaton as Norma's has-been cronies.<ref>Kirgo (1979), p.276.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWilder preferred to leave analysis of his screenplays and films to others. When asked if ''Sunset Boulevard'' was a [[black comedy]], he replied: \"No, just a picture\".<ref name=\"londonreviewofbooks\">Wood, Michael (March 2, 2000). Review of ''Conversations with Wilder'' by Cameron Crowe. ''London Review of Books'',  Retrieved on July 21, 2005 from http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n05/wood01_.html.</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Gloria Swanson and William Holden.jpg|thumb|Wilder considered many actors for the lead roles, but chose Swanson and Holden.]]\nAccording to Brackett,  Wilder and he never considered anyone except Gloria Swanson for the role of Norma Desmond. Wilder, however, had a different recollection. He recalled first wanting [[Mae West]] and [[Marlon Brando]] for the leads. West rejected the offer out-right. West portrayed herself as a sex symbol through her senior years, and was offended that she should be asked to play a Hollywood has-been.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|p=112}}\n\nThe filmmakers approached [[Greta Garbo]], whom they had worked with previously on ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939), but she was not interested. Wilder contacted [[Pola Negri]] by telephone, but had a difficult time understanding her heavy Polish accent. He then reached out to [[Clara Bow]], the famed \"IT Girl\" of the 1920s, but she declined citing that she had no interest in engaging in the film industry again due to how hard it was for her during the transition of sound films and that she'd prefer to remain in seclusion with her husband and sons while leaving her previous life behind her. They also offered the part of Norma Desmond to [[Norma Shearer]], but she rejected the role due to both her retirement and distaste for the script. They were considering [[Fred MacMurray]] to play opposite her as Joe. Wilder and Brackett then visited [[Mary Pickford]], but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed. They had considered pairing [[Montgomery Clift]] with her.<ref>Sikov, p. 286</ref>\n\nAccording to Wilder, he asked [[George Cukor]] for advice, and he suggested Swanson, one of the most f\u00eated actresses of the silent-screen era, known for her beauty, talent, and extravagant lifestyle. In many ways, she resembled the Norma Desmond character, and like her, had been unable to make a smooth transition into [[talking pictures]]. The similarities ended there; Swanson made a handful of talking pictures. She accepted the end of her film career, and in the early 1930s moved to [[New York City]], where she worked in [[radio]]. In the mid-1940s, she worked in [[television]] and on the New York stage and had last appeared in the 1941 film ''[[Father Takes a Wife]]''. Though Swanson was not seeking a movie comeback, she became  intrigued when Wilder discussed the role with her.<ref name=\"perry\" />\n\nSwanson was glad for the opportunity to earn a greater salary than she had been making in television and on stage.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|p=112}} However, she was chagrined at the notion of submitting to a [[screen test]], saying she had \"made 20 films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?\" Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, \"Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount.\" In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, \"If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you.\" His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate,<ref name=\"swanson\">Swanson, pp.249-260</ref> and she signed a contract for $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50,000|1950|fmt=eq|r=-4}}).<ref>Sikov, p. 285</ref> In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, \"There ''was'' a lot of Norma in her, you know.\"<ref name=\"aboutfilmnoir\">[http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue10/features/wilder/ Billy Wilder \u2013 \"About Film Noir].

''Queen Kelly'' wasn't released in the United States for over 50 years<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/arts/queen-kelly-opens-more-than-50-years-late.html|title='queen Kelly' Opens - More Than 50 Years Late|last=Art|first=Stephen Harvey; Stephen Harvey is assistant curator in the Department of Film of the Museum of Modern|date=1985-09-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> after Swanson walked off the set.<ref name=\"swanson\" />\n\nMontgomery Clift was signed to play Joe Gillis for $5,000 per week for a guaranteed 12 weeks, but just before the start of filming, he withdrew from the project, claiming his role of a young man involved with an older woman was too close to the one he had played in ''[[The Heiress]]'' (1949), in which he felt he had been unconvincing. An infuriated Wilder responded, \"If he's any kind of actor, he could be convincing making love to ''any'' woman.\"<ref>Sikov, p. 288</ref>  Clift himself was having an affair with a much older woman (the singer [[Libby Holman]]) which was suggested as his real reason for withdrawing from the film.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Petersen|first1=Anne Helen|title=Scandals of Classic Hollywood: The Long Suicide of Montgomery Clift|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/09/scandals-of-classic-hollywood-montgomery-clift|access-date=3 December 2016|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=23 September 2014|quote=He was also close with stage actress Libby Holman, 16 years his senior, who had become a notorious feature in the gossip columns following the suspicious death of her wealthy husband, rumors of lesbianism, and her general practice of dating younger men.

Following an appearance in ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]'' (1940), he served in the military in [[World War II]], and his return to the screen afterward had been moderately successful. Holden was enthusiastic about the script and eager to accept the role. He did not know at the time that his salary of $39,000 ({{Inflation|US|39,000|1950|fmt=eq|r=-4}}) was much less than had been offered to Clift.<ref>Sikov, pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\nErich von Stroheim, a leading film director of the 1920s who had directed Swanson, was signed to play Max, Norma's faithful servant, protector, and former husband. For the role of Betty Schaefer, Wilder wanted a newcomer who could project a wholesome and ordinary image to contrast with Swanson's flamboyant and obsessive Desmond. He chose [[Nancy Olson]], who had recently been considered for the role of [[Delilah]] in Cecil B. DeMille's ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]].''<ref name=\"staggs\">Staggs (2002), p. ??</ref>\n\nDeMille, often credited as the person most responsible for making Swanson a star, plays himself, and was filmed on the set of ''Samson and Delilah'' at Paramount Studios. He calls Norma \"young fella\" as he had called Swanson.\n\nNorma's friends who come to play bridge with her, described in the script as \"the waxworks\", were Swanson's contemporaries [[Buster Keaton]], [[Anna Q. Nilsson]], and [[H. B. Warner]], who like DeMille, played themselves. Hedda Hopper also played herself, reporting on Norma Desmond's downfall in the film's final scenes.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n===Cinematography and design===\n\nThe film's dark, shadowy [[black-and-white]], [[film noir]] cinematography was the work of [[John F. Seitz]]. Wilder had worked with him on several projects before, and trusted his judgment, allowing him to make his own decisions. Seitz recalled asking Wilder what he required for the pet chimpanzee's funeral scene. Wilder replied, \"you know, just your standard monkey funeral shot.\" For some interior shots, Seitz sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest \"mustiness,\" a trick he had also used for ''[[Double Indemnity]]'' (1944).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beach|first1=Christopher|title=A Hidden History of Film Style: Cinematographers, Directors, and the Collaborative Process|date=2015|publisher=University of California Press|location=Oakland, California|isbn=9780520284357|pages=86\u2013114}}</ref> The film had the option to be shot in color, but it was instead shot in black and white to be more reflective of the noir genre.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Terry|first1=Ryan|title=Why Sunset Boulevard Still Capture the \"Eyes of the World\" Today.|url=https://the-artifice.com/why-sunset-boulevard-still-captures-the-eyes-of-the-world-today/|website=The Artifice|access-date=12 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nWilder was adamant that the corpse of Joe Gillis be seen from the bottom of the pool, but creating the effect was difficult. The camera was placed inside a specially constructed box and lowered under water, but the result disappointed Wilder, who insisted on further experiments. The shot was finally achieved by placing a mirror on the bottom of the pool and filming Holden's reflection from above with the distorted image of the policemen standing around the pool and forming a backdrop.<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\nFilm historian Tom Stempel writes, \"In both ''Double Indemnity'' and ''Sunset Boulevard'', Seitz does something that has always impressed me. Both are films noir, and he finesses the fact that both are set in the sunniest of locales, Los Angeles... he brings together the light and the dark in the same film without any seams showing... he brings together the realistic lighting of Joe Gillis out in the real world with the gothic look of Norma Desmond's mansion. Again with no seams showing.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\n[[Edith Head]] designed the costumes. Wilder, Head, and Swanson agreed that Norma Desmond would have kept somewhat up-to-date with fashion trends, so Head designed costumes closely resembling the [[Christian Dior|Dior]] look of the mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond's taste.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Truhler|first1=Kimberly|title=Cinema Style--Edith Head Gets Gloria Swanson Ready for her Close-Up in SUNSET BOULEVARD|url=http://www.glamamor.com/2014/09/SunsetBoulevard-GloriaSwanson-EdithHead.html|website=GlamAmor|access-date=10 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSwanson recalled in her biography that the costumes were only \"a trifle outdated, a trifle exotic.\"<ref name=\"swanson\" /> Head later described her assignment as \"the most challenging of my career,\" and explained her approach with the comment, \"Because Norma Desmond was an actress who had become lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her look like she was always impersonating someone.\" Head later said she relied on Swanson's expertise because \"she was creating a past that she knew and I didn't.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" /> Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters, but for authenticity, Wilder instructed Von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.<ref name=\"70th anniversary story\">{{cite news|last=Feinberg|first=Scott|title='Sunset Blvd.' Turns 70: Nancy Olson on Wilder, Holden and Why She Walked Away From Stardom|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/sunset-blvd-star-nancy-olson-wilder-holden-why-she-walked-away-stardom-1290825|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 19, 2020|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe overstated decadence of Norma Desmond's home was created by set designer [[Hans Dreier]], whose career extended back to the silent era. He had also been commissioned to complete the interior design for the homes of movie stars, including the house of Mae West. [[William Haines]], an interior designer and former actor, later rebutted criticism of Dreier's set design with the observation, \"[[Bebe Daniels]], [[Norma Shearer]], and Pola Negri all had homes with ugly interiors like that.\"<ref name=\"staggs\" />\n\nThe bed in the shape of a boat in which Norma Desmond slept had been owned by the dancer [[Gaby Deslys]], who died in 1920. It had originally been bought by the Universal prop department at auction after Deslys's death. The bed appeared in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925) starring [[Lon Chaney]].\n\nWilder also made use of authentic locales. Joe Gillis's apartment is in the Alto Nido, a real apartment block in central Hollywood that was often populated by struggling writers. The scenes of Gillis and Betty Schaefer on Paramount's back lot were filmed on the actual back lot, and the interior of [[Schwab's Drug Store]] was carefully recreated for several scenes. The exterior scenes of the Desmond house were filmed at [[William O. Jenkins House|a house]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] built during the 1920s by the millionaire [[William O. Jenkins]]. Jenkins and his family lived in it for just one year, then left it abandoned for more than a decade, which earned it the nickname, the \"Phantom House\".<ref>'Wilshire Phantom House Soon to be Only Memory\", ''Los Angeles Times'', February 24, 1957</ref> By 1949, it was owned by the former wife of [[J. Paul Getty|J.&nbsp;Paul Getty]]. The house was later featured in [[Nicholas Ray]]'s ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955). It was demolished by the Gettys in 1957 to allow construction of an office building .<ref>[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/s/sunsetblvd.html Sunset Boulevard film locations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806060957/http://movie-locations.com/movies/s/sunsetblvd.html |date=2013-08-06 }}, The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations, 2013</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The top houses from the movies|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertypicturegalleries/9239346/The-top-houses-from-the-movies.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502235333/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertypicturegalleries/9239346/The-top-houses-from-the-movies.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-05-02|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nDuring filming, considerable publicity was given to health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which made her look the same age as Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor [[Wally Westmore]] to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden be made up to appear younger.

His theme for Norma Desmond was based on [[tango music]], inspired by her having danced the tango with [[Rudolph Valentino]]. This style was contrasted with Joe Gillis's [[bebop]] theme. Waxman also used distorted arrangements of popular film-music styles from the 1920s and 1930s to suggest Norma Desmond's state of mind. The film's score was recorded for [[compact disc]] by the [[Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Joel McNeely]] and released in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=15251 |title=Soundtrack details: Sunset Blvd |publisher=SoundtrackCollector |access-date=2010-03-17}}</ref> The surviving parts of the original score were released in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.behance.net/gallery/4029763/Sunset-Blvd|title=Sunset BLVD}}</ref>\n\n==Original release and responses==\n\n===Previews and revision===\nWilder and Brackett, nervous about a major screening in Hollywood, held a preview in [[Evanston, Illinois]], in late 1949. The original edit opened with a scene inside a [[morgue]], with the assembled corpses discussing how they came to be there. The story began with the corpse of Joe Gillis recounting his murder to the others. The audience reacted with laughter and seemed unsure whether to view the rest of the film as drama or comedy. After a similar reaction during its second screening in [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], and a third in [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]], the morgue opening was replaced by a shorter poolside opening,<ref>Staggs (2002), pp. 151-152</ref> using footage filmed on January 5, 1950.<ref name=\"AFIdetail\">Production dates per the online [https://catalog.afi.com/Film/26513-SUNSET-BLVD?sid=cdf5d7b8-9326-4679-a3d7-aa7edfe9d6ef&sr=8.748963&cp=1&pos=0 AFI Catalog of Feature Films detailed listing]</ref>\n\nIn Hollywood, Paramount arranged a private screening for the various studio heads and specially invited guests. After viewing the film, [[Barbara Stanwyck]] knelt to kiss the hem of Gloria Swanson's skirt. Swanson later remembered looking for [[Mary Pickford]], only to be told, \"She can't show herself, Gloria. She's too overcome. We all are.\" [[Louis B. Mayer]] berated Wilder before the crowd of celebrities, saying, \"You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you! You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood!\" Upon hearing of Mayer's slight, Wilder strode up to the mogul and retorted with a vulgarity that one biographer said was allegedly because Mayer, who was Jewish, suggested that Wilder, who was also Jewish, would be better off being sent back to Germany, an extraordinary sentiment so soon after the war and the Holocaust, in which Wilder's family perished.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sikov|first=Ed|title=On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder|year=1999|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=0-7868-8503-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Eyman|first=Scott|title=Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B.

He compares von Stroheim's character Max with the concealed [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]], the central character in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'', and Norma Desmond with [[Count Dracula|Dracula]], noting that, as she seduces Joe Gillis, the camera tactfully withdraws with \"the traditional directorial attitude taken towards Dracula's jugular seductions\". He writes that the narrative contains an excess of \"cheap sarcasm\", but ultimately congratulates the writers for attributing this dialogue to Joe Gillis, who was in any case presented as little more than a [[hack writer]].<ref name=\"richardcorliss\">Corliss, p. 147</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

They parted amicably and did not publicly air any grievances for the rest of their lives. In later years, Brackett confided in screenwriter/director [[Garson Kanin]] that he had not anticipated the split, or had ever understood exactly what happened or why. He described it as \"an unexpected blow\" from which he never recovered fully. When asked to respond to Brackett's comments, Wilder remained silent.<ref>Sikov, pp. 305\u2013306</ref>\n\nThe two men briefly reunited in October 1951 to face charges that they had [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] ''Sunset Boulevard.'' Former Paramount accountant Stephanie Joan Carlson alleged that in 1947 she had submitted to Wilder and Brackett, at their request, manuscripts of stories, both fictional and based on fact, she had written about studio life. She claimed that one in particular, ''Past Performance'', served as the basis for the ''Sunset'' script, and sued the screenwriters and Paramount for $100,000 in [[damages|general damages]], $250,000 in [[punitive damages]], $700,000 based on the box office returns, and an additional $350,000 for good measure, for a total of $1,400,000. Carlson's suit was dismissed after two and a half years. In 1954, a similar suit was filed by playwright Edra Buckler, who claimed material she had written had been the screenplay's source. Her suit was dismissed the following year.<ref>Sikov, pp. 310\u2013311</ref>\n\nBrackett's Hollywood career continued after his split with Wilder. He won an Academy Award for his screenplay for ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953), and wrote ''[[Niagara (1953 film)|Niagara]]'' (1953), the breakthrough film for [[Marilyn Monroe]] as a dramatic actress. It was Wilder, however, who realized Monroe's comedic abilities in ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' and ''[[Some Like It Hot]].'' Brackett's career waned by the end of the decade, though he did produce the Oscar-nominated film ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956). He received an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.\n\nWilliam Holden began receiving more important parts and his career rose. He won the Best Actor Oscar for ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), also directed by Wilder, and by 1956 he was the top box-office attraction in the United States.\n\nBefore the film was released, Nancy Olson had grown disenchanted with film as a career partly because the themes of ''Sunset Boulevard'' resonated with her, and also because she had become engaged to songwriter [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and decided to move to New York with him. Nevertheless, Olson's pairing with William Holden was considered a success, and she appeared opposite him in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success; she returned to Hollywood to make several other films, including ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' (1961) and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'' (1963), in which she was paired with [[Fred MacMurray]].<ref name=\"70th anniversary story\" />\n\nHolden and Wilder also rejoined forces for ''[[Fedora (1978 film)|Fedora]]'' (1978), another film critical of Hollywood.\n\nSimilarly, Gloria Swanson was not able to leverage her own success in ''Sunset Boulevard''. Although offered scripts, she felt that they all were poor imitations of Norma Desmond. Imagining a career that would eventually reduce her to playing \"a parody of a parody,\" she virtually retired from films.<ref name=\"perry\" />\n\n''Sunset Boulevard'' was shown again in [[New York City]] in 1960, and drew such a positive response that Paramount arranged for a limited re-release in theaters throughout the United States.\n\nFilms that discuss ''Sunset Boulevard'' in their screenplays or pay homage in scenes or dialogue include ''[[Soapdish]]'' (1991), ''[[The Player (1992 film)|The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001),<ref name=\"staggs\" /> ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006) and ''[[Be Cool]]'' (2005). The ending of ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (2000) is a parody of ''Sunset Boulevard's'' final scene.\n\n==Restoration and home media==\nBy the late 1990s, most ''Sunset Boulevard'' prints were in poor condition, and as the film was shot using [[nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] [[filmstock]], much of the original negative had perished. Paramount Studios, believing the film merited the effort of a complete restoration, mounted an expensive project to have it [[digital video|digitally]] restored.

(at first ''Starring Norma Desmond''). Stapley and Hughes first approached Swanson about appearing in a musical revue they had written, ''About Time'' (based on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''). Swanson stated that she would return to the stage only in a musical version of her comeback film. Within a week, Stapley and Dickson had written three songs which Swanson approved.<ref name=StapleyHughes>Based on liner notes to ''Boulevard!'' demo recording CD release, by Richard Stapley, Tim J Hutton and Steven M Warner</ref>\n\nIn this version, the romance between Gillis and Schaefer was allowed to blossom, and rather than shoot Gillis at the end, Norma gave the couple her blessing, sending them on their way to live \"happily ever after.\"\n\nAlthough Paramount gave verbal permission to proceed with the musical, there was no formal legal option. In the late 1950s, Paramount withdrew its consent, leading to the demise of the project.\n\nIn 1994, Dickson Hughes incorporated material from ''Boulevard!'' into a musical ''Swanson on Sunset'', based on his and Stapley's experiences in writing ''Boulevard!''.\n\n===Other failed attempts===\n[[Stephen Sondheim]] briefly considered turning ''Sunset Boulevard'' into a musical until meeting Billy Wilder at a cocktail party, who told him that the film would be better adapted as an opera rather than a musical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Look, I made a hat : collected lyrics (1981-2011) with attendant comments, amplifications, dogmas, harangues, wafflings, anecdotes and miscellany|last=Stephen.|first=Sondheim|date=2011|publisher=Virgin|isbn=978-0753522608|location=London|oclc=751797401}}</ref> [[Hal Prince]] later approached Sondheim to adapt the film as a musical with [[Angela Lansbury]] playing Norma Desmond.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sondheim.com/features/stephen_sondheim.html|title=Side by Side With Stephen Sondheim|website=sondheim.com|access-date=2018-02-18}}</ref>\n\n[[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] were also approached by Hal Prince to write a musical of ''Sunset Boulevard''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Close-up on Sunset Boulevard : Billy Wilder, Norma Desmond, and the dark Hollywood dream|last=Staggs|first=Sam|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|date=February 2003|isbn=0312302541|edition= 1st St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York|page=320|oclc=51815402}}</ref>\n\n===Andrew Lloyd Webber and Black & Hampton===\n{{Main|Sunset Boulevard (musical)}}\nA musical adaptation with book and lyrics written by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] and [[Christopher Hampton]], and music by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] was staged in 1993 in London, with [[Patti LuPone]] playing Norma Desmond.

The plot of the episode \"A Star is Reborn\" is also based on the film.\n* The ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' season 7 finale and segue to the film noir ''Archer: Dreamland'' season 8 recreate the pool scene from the opening of the film.\n* The ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' character [[Chief Gordon Cole|Gordon Cole]] is named after the ''Sunset Boulevard'' character. A scene from the film itself appears in Part 15 of ''[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|Twin Peaks: The Return]]''. In the scene, being viewed by Dale Cooper, the name \"Gordon Cole\" is spoken, which stirs Cooper's buried memory of his time in the FBI.\n* The ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'' episode \"Fifteen Minutes of Dick\" (season 2, ep. 23) features a spoof on the film, wherein Sally, suddenly famous, spirals into Norma-esque despair as her celebrity wanes.\n* The early episodes of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' (2004) have numerous allusions to ''Sunset Boulevard'', including the use of a dead person as a narrator, and another character's fondness for Billy Wilder movies.\n\n===Literature===\n\n''Sunset Boulevard'' is heavily referenced in '' [[The Disaster Artist|The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made]]'' by [[Greg Sestero]] and [[Tom Bissell]]. Quotes from the film are used as [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]]s for many chapters; for example, Chapter 11 begins, \"No one leaves a star.
