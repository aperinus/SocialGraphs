It is the fifth installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]] and a [[prequel]] to the [[Final Destination (film)|first film]]. ''Final Destination 5'' stars [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Miles Fisher]], [[Arlen Escarpeta]], [[David Koechner]], and [[Tony Todd]], and follows a young man (played by D'Agosto) who has a premonition and saves a group of people from death when a suspension bridge begins to collapse. However, they soon learn that they cannot escape death.\n\nDespite ''[[The Final Destination]]'' being originally announced as the final film in the franchise, due to its financial success, development of ''Final Destination 5'' began in 2010. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], as with the first three installments.\n\n''Final Destination 5'' was theatrically released on August 12, 2011, and on\u00a0DVD\u00a0on December 27, 2011, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[New Line Cinema]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with some critics considered it both a return-to-form for the franchise and an improvement over the previous installment. Reviews criticized the film for failing to bring anything new to the franchise, weak character development, and average dialogue, but also praised the use of 3D,\u00a0the visual effects, the inventive death scenes, the return of suspense as opposed to a campy feel (particularly both the opening sequence and the twist ending). The film was a financial success, grossing $157 million worldwide against a $40 million budget, becoming the second highest-grossing film in the franchise. A sequel is in development.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[List of Final Destination characters#Sam Lawton|Sam Lawton]] is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that high winds will cause the bridge under construction to collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Molly Harper|Molly Harper]], whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. Panicked, he persuades Molly, his friends [[List of Final Destination characters#Nathan Sears|Nathan Sears]] and [[List of Final Destination characters#Peter Friedkin|Peter Friedkin]], Peter's girlfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Candice Hooper|Candice Hooper]], his boss [[List of Final Destination characters#Dennis Lapman|Dennis Lapman]], and co-workers [[Olivia Castle]] and [[List of Final Destination characters#Isaac Palmer|Isaac Palmer]] to leave just as the bridge collapses. After being interrogated by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[List of Final Destination characters#Agent Jim Block|Jim Block]], the survivors attend a memorial service for their deceased co-workers where they are being watched by [[coroner]] [[William Bludworth]].\n\nLater, Candice dies during her gym practice from a chain reaction that causes her to fall off the [[uneven bars]] and snap her spine. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling [[Buddha]] statue during an [[acupuncture]] session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. At the same time, Sam and Molly fail to save Olivia, who falls out of a window to her death at an eye surgery clinic. Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge and realizes that Nathan is next.\n\nNathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker [[List of Final Destination characters#Roy Carson|Roy Carson]] during an argument. He relays this information to the remaining survivors, who believe that Nathan must have claimed Roy's remaining lifespan. When Dennis arrives to question the incident, a [[wrench]] launched by a [[belt sander]] splits his face, killing him. That evening, Sam and Molly rekindle their relationship at the restaurant where the former is working. Peter, who has become unstable after Candice's death, interrupts the date and decides to kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the kitchen as Block overhears the gunshots from outside and enters the restaurant, only to be shot dead by Peter. The former attempts to kill Molly and Sam to eliminate witnesses, but Sam stabs Peter with a [[Rotisserie|meat spit]] to save Molly.\n\nTwo weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to [[Paris]]. Before taking their seats, they notice a fight between [[List of Final Destination characters#Carter Horton|Carter Horton]] and [[Alex Browning]], who are both removed from the plane with [[List of Final Destination characters#Valerie Lewton|Ms. Lewton]] [[List of Final Destination characters#Terry Chaney|and]] [[List of Final Destination characters#Billy Hitchcock|the]] [[List of Final Destination characters#Tod Waggner|other]] [[Clear Rivers|students]], revealing that the plane they are boarding is [[Final Destination (film)|Vol\u00e9e Airlines Flight 180]]. Upon take-off, Sam overhears Alex's vision from a flight attendant's conversation with a passenger. When he realizes that it is too late for him and Molly to escape, both of them perish along with everyone else on the plane in the explosion that follows. At Roy's memorial, Nathan learns from a co-worker about Roy's autopsy and the discovery of his [[Intracranial aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] that would have resulted in his death in a short time anyway. As Nathan realizes he is still in danger, the landing gear from the plane breaks through the roof and crushes him, setting off the events of [[Final Destination|the first four films]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{for|more details on the characters|List of Final Destination characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nicholas D'Agosto]] as Sam Lawton\n* [[Emma Bell]] as Molly Harper\n* [[Miles Fisher]] as Peter Friedkin\n* Ellen Wroe as Candice Hooper\n* [[Jacqueline MacInnes Wood]] as [[Olivia Castle]]\n* [[P.
