The film stars [[Anne Parillaud]] as the title character, a teen criminal who is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering policemen during an armed pharmacy robbery. Her government handlers fake her death and recruit her as a professional assassin. After intense training, she starts a career as a killer, where she struggles to balance her work with her personal life. She shows talent at this and her career progresses until a mission in an embassy goes awry.\n\n''Nikita'' was commercially successful, but received mixed reviews from critics. It was remade as ''[[Black Cat (1991 film)|Black Cat]]'' (1991) in Hong Kong and ''[[Point of No Return (1993 film)|Point of No Return]]'' (1993) in Hollywood. Two television series were produced based on the film, ''[[La Femme Nikita (TV series)|La Femme Nikita]]'' (1997\u20132001) and ''[[Nikita (TV series)|Nikita]]'' (2010\u20132013).\n\n==Plot==\n\nNikita is a nihilistic teenage [[Substance dependence|junkie]] who commits her life to anarchy, drugs and violence. One night, she participates in the robbery of a [[pharmacy]] owned by a friend's parents. The robbery erupts into a gunfight with local police, and her accomplices are killed. Suffering severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms, she murders a police officer. Nikita is arrested, tried, and convicted of murder, and is sentenced to [[Life sentence|life in prison]].\n\nIn prison, government officials fake her death, making it appear that she has committed suicide, and remove her from prison. She awakens in a nondescript room, where a well-dressed, hard-looking man named Bob tells her that, although officially dead and buried, she is in the custody of a shadowy government agency known as \"the Centre\" (possibly part of the [[DGSE]]). She is given the choice of becoming an [[Assassination|assassin]], or of occupying \"row 8, plot 30\", her fake grave.<ref>as per the original French version/English subtitles</ref> After some resistance, she chooses the former and gradually proves to be a talented killer. She is taught computer skills, martial arts, and firearms. One of her trainers, Armande, transforms her from a degenerate drug addict to a beautiful [[femme fatale]]. Amande implies that she also was rescued and trained by the Centre.\n\nNikita's initial mission, killing a foreign diplomat in a crowded restaurant and escaping from his well-armed bodyguards to the Centre, doubles as the final test in her training. She graduates and begins life as a [[sleeper agent]] in Paris (under the name Marie). After meeting Marco in a supermarket, the two develop an intimate relationship, although he knows nothing of her real work. Marco is curious about her past and why she has no family or other friends. Nikita invites Bob to dinner as \"Uncle Bob\". He tells stories about \"Marie\"'s imaginary childhood, and give the couple tickets for a trip to [[Venice]], purportedly as an engagement gift.\n\nNikita and Marco go on the trip. As they prepare to make love after arrival, the phone rings. She thinks it's the room service they just ordered, but it is instructions for her next job. Her room is perfectly located for her to shoot the target. She goes to the bathroom, supposedly to take a bath, and as she prepares the rifle, Marco tries to talk to her through the door. The instructions about her target take longer than expected and she can't answer him. She finally shoots her target but barely conceals the rifle before Marco walks in, against her wishes. Nikita is distraught that her work has caused them difficulties.\n\nStill, her career as an assassin goes well until a document-theft mission in an embassy goes awry. The Centre sends in Victor \"The [[Cleaner (crime)|Cleaner]]\", a ruthless operative, to salvage the mission and destroy all the evidence of the foul-up. When another operative is killed by Victor, Nikita is assigned to take his place. They nearly complete the mission before it goes bad. Victor takes on a bunch of guards before being fatally wounded, but drives Nikita to safety before succumbing to his wounds.\n\nMarco reveals that he has discovered Nikita's secret life, and, concerned over how her activities are affecting her psychologically, persuades her to disappear. Upon discovering that she abandoned the Centre, Bob goes to their apartment and meets with Marco. When Bob says that Nikita is at risk because she still has the documents taken from the embassy, Marco hands them over. The two men agree that they will both miss Nikita.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Anne Parillaud Cannes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne Parillaud]] stars as Nikita, a young female assassin]]\n* [[Anne Parillaud]] as Nikita\n* [[Marc Duret]] as Rico\n* [[Jean-Hugues Anglade]] as Marco\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Bob\n* [[Jeanne Moreau]] as Amande\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Victor \"The Cleaner\"\n* [[Jacques Boudet]] as The Chemist\n* [[Philippe Leroy (actor)|Philippe Leroy]] as Grossman\n\n==Production==\nBased on the success of ''[[Le Grand Bleu]]'', Gaumont agreed to finance ''Nikita'' without having seen a script.
