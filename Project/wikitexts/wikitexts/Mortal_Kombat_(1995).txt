S. Anderson]] and written by Kevin Droney. Based on the [[Mortal Kombat|video game franchise of the same name]], it is the first installment in the [[Mortal Kombat (film series)|''Mortal Kombat'' film series]]. Starring [[Linden Ashby]], [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]], [[Robin Shou]], [[Bridgette Wilson]], [[Talisa Soto]], and [[Christopher Lambert]], the film follows a group of heroes who participate in the eponymous Mortal Kombat tournament to protect Earth from being conquered by malevolent forces. Its story primarily adapts the [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|original 1992 game]], while also using elements from the game ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993).\n\nThe film premiered in the United States on August 18, 1995. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the martial art sequences, atmosphere, and production values, but criticized the performances, script, and toned-down violence from the games. Despite the mixed critical response, the film was well-received by fans of the series. It was also a commercial success, grossing $122 million on an $20 million budget.\n\n''Mortal Kombat'' was followed by a 1997 sequel, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', along with two television series: the animated sequel ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'' (1996) and the live-action prequel ''[[Mortal Kombat: Conquest]]'' (1998\u20131999). The follow-ups were unable to match the original film's success and the series was [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] with a [[Mortal Kombat (2021 film)|2021 film]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words only. -->\n<!-- Do not identify the character of the Outworld Emperor as Shao Kahn, as he is never addressed by name at any point in the film.-->\n<!-- Do not change \"Rayden\" to \"Raiden\", as the character's name is spelled \"Rayden\" in the film.-->\nMortal Kombat is a martial arts tournament that is held once every generation between representatives of the realms of Earth and Outworld, conceived by the [[Elder Gods (Mortal Kombat)|Elder Gods]] amid looming invasion of the Earth by Outworld. If Outworld achieves ten consecutive victories, the [[Shao Kahn|Outworld Emperor]] will invade and conquer the Earthrealm. They have already won nine times. [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin monk]] [[Liu Kang]], movie star [[Johnny Cage]], and special forces officer [[Sonya Blade]] are chosen by [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Rayden]], the god of thunder and defender of Earthrealm, to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight tournament. Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host [[Shang Tsung]] for killing his brother Chan, a death for which he blames himself; Sonya is lured onto the ship headed for Shang Tsung's island by crime boss [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]], who murdered her partner; and Johnny seeks to debunk media claims that his martial arts skills are faked.\n\nTsung orders the creature [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]] to prevent [[Kitana|Princess Kitana]], the Emperor's adopted daughter, from allying with the Earth warriors. Liu, Johnny, and Sonya advance to the final rounds of the tournament, with Sonya killing Kano, Johnny defeating [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], and Liu killing [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]].\n\nSoon, most of Earthrealm's warriors are defeated by the reigning tournament champion, Prince [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]], including one of Johnny Cage's peers, Art Lean, whose soul is taken by Shang Tsung. This causes the few remaining Earthrealm warriors to lose hope. Rayden warns the Earth warriors that their own fears and egos will make them lose to Goro, but that Goro can still be beaten by mortal men and women. Hoping to protect Liu and Sonya, Johnny challenges Goro. Shang Tsung allows the fight, under the stipulation that he may, in turn, choose anyone to face him in the final fight, in any place of his choosing. Rayden initially rebukes Johnny for challenging Goro, but is impressed when Johnny shows his awareness of the gravity of the tournament.\n\nDuring their fight, Johnny uses guile and the element of surprise to defeat an overconfident Goro. Now desperate, Tsung takes Sonya hostage and takes her to Outworld, intending to fight her in the final fight for an easy win. Knowing that his powers are ineffective there, Rayden sends Liu and Johnny into Outworld to rescue Sonya and challenge Tsung. In Outworld, Liu is attacked by Reptile, but gains the upper hand and kills him. Kitana meets up with Johnny and Liu. She reveals to them that her home was once a beautiful and peaceful place, until the Emperor came from a third realm and brought Outworld to ruin after winning ten consecutive Mortal Kombat tournaments there. He then adopted Kitana and took the throne for himself. Not wanting the Emperor to succeed in taking over Earthrealm, Kitana helps them infiltrate Shang Tsung's fortress, disguised in the robes of his followers.\n\nBefore Shang Tsung can fight Sonya, the trio reveal themselves. Kitana berates Tsung for his treachery to the Emperor and for breaking the rules of Mortal Kombat, distracting him while Liu and Johnny free Sonya. Tsung then challenges Johnny but is counter-challenged by Liu. During the lengthy battle, Liu faces not only Shang Tsung but the souls that he took in past tournaments. To take advantage, Shang Tsung morphs into Chan to confuse Liu. Finally accepting that he is not responsible for Chan's death allows Liu to see through the charade. As Shang Tsung begins to lose his power over the souls he took, Liu Kang fires an energy bolt at him, knocking him off and landing onto a bed of spikes. Tsung's death releases all of the captive souls, including Chan's. Before ascending to the afterlife, Chan tells Liu that he will remain with him in spirit until they are reunited.\n\nThe Earth warriors return to Earthrealm, where a victory celebration is taking place at Liu's Shaolin temple. The jubilation stops when the Outworld Emperor appears and declares he has come for everyone's souls. Raiden and the warriors take up fighting stances.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Lambert]] as [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Lord Rayden]], god of thunder and protector of Earthrealm who guides the warriors on their journey. He desires to aid the heroes in defending Earthrealm, but as he himself is not mortal, he is not permitted to participate in the tournament and may only advise them and act to prevent cheating. [[Sean Connery]] was offered the role, but turned it down.<ref name=\"HolRepoKick\"/>\n* [[Robin Shou]] as [[Liu Kang]], a former Shaolin monk, who enters the tournament to avenge his brother's death. He is among the first who notice Kitana's sympathy towards Earthrealm. As in most of the games in the ''Mortal Kombat'' series, Liu Kang is the main protagonist. This was Shou's second American film, as his first American role was in 1990, the made-for-television film ''[[Forbidden Nights]]''.\n* [[Linden Ashby]] as [[Johnny Cage]], a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] superstar who enters the tournament to prove to the world that his martial arts skills are legitimate.

He saw cinematic possibilities in the concept and expressed interest in making a film based on the game, but Midway head Neil D. Nicastro disagreed that the game could be a successful film, particularly given the failure of past movie adaptations of video games. After months of negotiations, Kasanoff finally acquired a limited option on the ''Mortal Kombat'' film rights.<ref name=HolRepoKick/>\n\n[[File:01-\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e0a\u0e0d\u0e4c.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Wat Phra Si Sanphet]] was used in the film's opening for a fight between Shang Tsung and Liu Kang's brother]]\n\nThough a number of top directors submitted pitches for the film, the producers chose unknown director [[Paul W.

The Outworld exterior scenes were filmed at the abandoned [[Kaiser Steel]] mill (now the [[Auto Club Speedway]]) in [[Fontana, California]], while all of Goro's scenes were filmed in Los Angeles. Shooting locations in Thailand were accessible only by boat, so cast, crew and equipment had to be transported on long canoe-style vessels. [[Location manager]] Gerrit Folsom constructed an outhouse in a secluded area near the set in order to alleviate the problem of repeated trips to and from the mainland. Filming locations in Thailand include the [[Wat Phra Si Sanphet]], [[Wat Chaiwatthanaram]] and [[Wat Ratchaburana, Ayutthaya|Wat Ratchaburana]] temples. The arrival of Earth's contestants via boats, Liu Kang's meditation scene and the fight between Liu Kang and Kitana were filmed at the [[Railay Beach]] and the Phra Nang Beach, respectively. The bows of the boats were fitted with ornamental dragon-head carvings and used in the movie as the fighters' secondary transport to Shang Tsung's island from his personal [[Junk (ship)|junk]].<ref name=MKBook />\n\nAt Anderson's encouragement, the actors ad-libbed much of the film's dialogue,<ref name=HolRepoKick/> including the quips \"Thank God I didn't ask him to park the car.\" and \"Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole.\"<ref name=ShouVAshby/> Most of the cast had several weeks of training for the fight sequences prior to the filming, but due to the last-minute recasting of the Sonya Blade role, Bridgette Wilson had to do all her training on the set.<ref name=LooperWilson/> The Sonya vs. Kano fight was one of the last scenes filmed so that Wilson would have enough time to train.<ref name=LooperWilson/>\n\nDespite the intensity of the fight scenes coupled with the actors performing most of their own stunts, the only notable reported injury at the time was a bruised kidney Ashby suffered while shooting Cage's fight scene with Scorpion.<ref name=MKBook /> Scorpion's [[stunt double]] violently collided with a steel bar in the same scene,<ref name=ShouVAshby/> but as with most [[stunt person]] injuries, it was not widely reported in the media.

He told only [[Keith Cooke]], the actor who plays Reptile, asking him not to hit him on the right side of his rib cage, and finished the scene before going to the hospital.<ref name=HolRepoKick/>\n\nBecause they wanted the film to have a [[PG-13]] rating while staying as close as possible to the video game, the producers talked extensively with the ratings board to learn the precise limitations of the rating and attempted to creatively optimize the amount of violence and foul language in the film within those limitations. For instance, they learned that the PG-13 rating forbids onscreen death, but only of human characters, so they had all the deaths of non-humans take place onscreen.<ref name=\"HolRepoKick\"/>\n\n{{Wide image|Phra Nang beach panorama edit.jpg|1000px|Railay beach was used as the backdrop for Earth's combatants when they arrive on Shang Tsung's island for the first time}}\nShou said that in the original script he \"was supposed to fall in love with Talisa Soto [Kitana].

The otherworldly dimension of Outworld was not formally mentioned until the second game, in which Jax, Kitana, and [[Shao Kahn]], the game's final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], also make their official debuts; Kahn briefly appears in the film's closing scene and is identified only as \"the Emperor\" throughout. Shang Tsung's soul-stealing power was first visualized in ''Mortal Kombat II'' as one of his [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]] finishing moves, while Liu Kang uses his \"Bicycle Kick\" special move from the game. After he kills Scorpion in his fight, Cage then drops an autographed picture of himself near his remains, in a reference to his [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)#Friendship|Friendship]] finishing move. Shang Tsung's robed Shadow Priests, seen before the final battle, were first seen in the second game as background characters.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Mortal Kombat'' opened on August 18, 1995, and was #1 at the box office for the weekend with $23.2 million, nearly eight times the opening amount of the only other new release that weekend, ''[[The Baby-Sitters Club (film)|The Baby-Sitters Club]]''.

Scott Johnson criticized the film as not being a faithful adaptation, citing in particular the absence of R-rated gore (which he felt was the only thing genuinely appealing about the game) and the presence of Reptile (who he erroneously said does not appear in the original game). Co-panelist Jacqueline Coley countered that an R rating would have blocked out the ''Mortal Kombat'' fan base, recounting how even with a PG-13 rating she could only see the film in theaters by sneaking in, and noted that the most beloved video game films are not faithful adaptations but well-crafted cinema which capture the essence of the games. Mark Ellis agreed with Coley that ''Mortal Kombat'' succeeded in this respect, commenting in particular how it mimics the game's minimal plot by focusing on the tournament, creating an experience similar to watching [[March Madness]].<ref name=RTIsWrong/> [[JoBlo.com]] called Mortal Kombat \"colorful, ambitious, and surprisingly funny; Anderson tied everything around a perfect cast lead by the great Robin Shou.\"<ref name=\"arrow\" /> [[Screen Rant]] referred to the choreography as \"top notch\", the locations as \"amazing\", the soundtrack as \"pure perfection\", and the cast as \"dedicated and outstanding\", but the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] as cartoonish and \"laughable\", the violence as not true to the source material, the Goro animatronic as \"not even that impressive by 1995 standards\", and the portrayals of Scorpion and Sub-Zero as insulting and \"completely wasted\".<ref name=rantaged /> [[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] mentioned that Mortal Kombat is \"an above-average martial arts classic that was high on fun and easily one of the most rewatchable video game movies, 25 years later\".<ref name=CBR /> Bloody Disgusting said the film does an excellent job of paying tribute to its source material by including a large number of characters from the game without any of them feeling shoehorned in and by capturing the intense action feel of the game,<ref name=Bloody/> while [[Collider (website)|Collider]] stated that \"The film knows how to walk the line between reverence and goofiness\".<ref name=collide />\n\nCary Hiroyuki Tagawa's take on Shang Tsung is now regarded as the ideal portrayal of the sorcerer. JoBlo.com noted that every actor who has taken the role since have been compared to Tagawa, commenting that his delivery \"has all the cadence and embellished style like he's on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], but he holds himself physically like he's just casually laying down the law. Tagawa ''is'' Shang Tsung.\"<ref name=\"arrow\" /> Screen Rant reported that while they felt all the main cast members were equally outstanding, Tagawa was \"the best casting of the movie to many\".<ref name=rantaged /> Christopher Lambert as Lord Rayden has also received positive coverage with JoBlo.com commenting that he \"lent the production maturity and star power\"<ref name=\"arrow\" /> while CBR mentioned that he \"steals every scene he appears, delivering ridiculous lines like, 'The fate of billions depends upon you,' before laughing and apologizing\".<ref name=CBR />\n\n''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'' paid tribute to the first movie with numerous Easter eggs as well as bringing back Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa to play Shang Tsung in the \"Aftermath\" storyline. Subsequent downloadable content would feature voices and likeness from Christopher Lambert, Linden Ashby and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras as Raiden, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade, respectively.\n\n==Other media==\n\n===Sequel===\n{{main article|Mortal Kombat: Annihilation}}\nA sequel entitled ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'' was released in 1997. It was directed by John R. Leonetti, who was the cinematographer of the first film. Only Robin Shou and Talisa Soto reprised their roles, with the others being recast. Its storyline is largely an adaptation of ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'', following Earthrealm's warriors in their battle against Shao Kahn.\n\nIn contrast to its predecessor, ''Annihilation'' was critically panned and failed at the box office. As a result, development of the planned third installment halted and never progressed beyond pre-production. In July 2009, actors Chris Casamassa (Scorpion) and Linden Ashby (Johnny Cage) separately announced that they would be reprising their respective roles from the original film, with Casamassa additionally claiming that filming would begin in September of that year,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/sidebar/909182374/26950479/third-mortal-kombat-movie-filming-in-september-report.html|title=Third Mortal Kombat movie filming in September - Report|author=Polybren|date=2009-07-08|access-date=2009-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712140445/http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/sidebar/909182374/26950479/third-mortal-kombat-movie-filming-in-september-report.html|archive-date=2009-07-12|url-status=dead|publisher=GameSpot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truveo.com/Linden-Ashby-talks-about-Mortal-Kombat-3/id/282147513|title=Linden Ashby talks about Mortal Kombat}}</ref> but the project did not commence production.\n\n===Animated film===\nOn April 11, 1995,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mortal Kombat on Video|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=69 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1995|page=24}}</ref> [[New Line Cinema|New Line Home Video]], [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Home Entertainment]] and [[Threshold Entertainment]] released a tie-in animated film on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]], titled ''Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins''. Serving as a prequel to the feature film, it follows the protagonists Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade as they travel on a mysterious boat to the Mortal Kombat tournament. On the way they meet Rayden, who provides them with some hints about how to survive the tournament and defeat Shang Tsung and his army of Tarkatan minions. Upon arriving at the island where the battles take place, Rayden retells the origins of Shang Tsung, Goro, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and the [[Great Kung Lao]] in between fight scenes.\n\nThe film featured a combination of [[traditional animation]], [[motion capture]], and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to explain the origins behind some of the movie's main characters, as well as a fifteen-minute behind-the-scenes documentary of the theatrical release. Trailers of the film were seen on the promotional [[screener (promotional)|screener]] VHS copy, and on other VHS releases from [[Turner Home Entertainment]] and [[New Line Home Entertainment|New Line Home Video]]. The film was included on the ''Mortal Kombat'' [[Blu-ray]] released in April 2011.\n\n===Novelization===\nA [[novelization]] of the movie by \"Martin Delrio\" ([[James D.

''Conquest'' served as a prequel centered on the [[Kung Lao#Great Kung Lao|Great Kung Lao]], accompanied by original characters Siro and Taja, and aired in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] from 1998 to 1999.
