The film was written by Spade and Fred Wolf, and produced by [[Robert Simonds]]. The plot revolves around a \"[[white trash]]\" young man, Joe Dirt, who at first seems to be a \"loser\", a failure, an [[antihero]]. As he travels in search of his parents, his finer qualities are increasingly revealed. He ends up with a new \"family\" of close friends, people he has helped and who respect him. While critical reception was mostly negative, the film was a modest financial success. A sequel, ''[[Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser]]'', premiered on [[Crackle (streaming service)|Crackle]] on July 16, 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- WP:FILMPLOT recommends the plot summary to be between 400-700 words. -->\nJoe Dirt, a [[janitor]] at a [[Los Angeles]] radio station, tells his life story via [[shock jock]] Zander Kelly's broadcast.\n\nJoe reveals that as a baby he had a [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]] wig installed [[Acrania|because the top of his skull had never formed]]. At age 8, he was left behind by his parents and sister at the [[Grand Canyon]] and thus does not know his real [[surname]]. After growing up in a series of [[foster care|foster homes]], Joe ran away until he arrived in Silvertown, a small town in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. There, he met Brandy and her dog, Charlie, and became a target for jealousy from Robby, the town bully.\n\nAfter Brandy's alcoholic father shoots Charlie dead, Joe decides to try to find his parents. He details his adventures across the country including his friendship with Kickin' Wing, an unsuccessful [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] fireworks salesman. In [[Indiana]], Joe has an encounter with a [[serial killer]] named [[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Buffalo Bob]], who is parodying the lotion scene from [[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]. This brings him unwanted attention from the media, but helps his search. In [[Louisiana]], he works on Charlene's [[alligator farm]] and as a high school janitor with Clem Doore, a former mobster in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Protection Program]]. Clem rescues students after a [[mustard gas]] explosion and informs the media Joe was the hero. This helps Joe discover the address of his old family home and he travels to [[Baton Rouge]] only to find that they moved away many years prior.\n\nListening to Joe's story, both Zander and the radio audience initially find him an object of scorn, but Joe's kindness and optimistic outlook on life win them over.\n\nEventually, Joe lands the janitorial job at the radio station, where he recounts how he gave up the search and returned to Silvertown to be with Brandy. However, Robby informed him that he and Brandy are getting married and that she found Joe's parents, but instructed him not to tell Joe. Zander calls Brandy to find out why, and she tells Joe his parents were killed the day they were at the Grand Canyon; she pleads with Joe to return to Silvertown. Upset by the news, Joe stays in Los Angeles.\n\nJoe is unaware that he has become a media sensation, but he quickly discovers his newfound fame. An appearance on ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' results in a phone call from a woman claiming to be Joe's mother. Joe meets his parents and he discovers that they intentionally abandoned him, and that they only reconnected with him in order to boost their sales of clown figurines. Joe storms out, cutting ties with his parents. He intends to commit [[suicide]], but Brandy arrives and finally admits that she lied to him about his parents being dead because she had to protect him from them and their greed after she found out what horrible people they were. Brandy expresses her love and convinces Joe to come home with her but he suffers a head injury after a police officer [[lasso]]s and accidentally causes him to fall off a bridge.\n\nJoe wakes up in Brandy's house, surrounded by his friends: Kickin' Wing, who reveals that thanks to Joe he now owns 30 successful firework stands, Clem (who is now under the name of Gert B. Frobe) and Charlene (who sold the alligator farm after one of the gators bit off her thumb and middle finger on her left hand), who are now engaged. Brandy reveals that she got Joe a [[dreadlock]] wig following his head operation, has retrieved his [[Plymouth GTX|Hemi]], and she has a new dog that Charlie fathered.\n\nAs they prepare to take a ride in Joe's Hemi, Robby arrives and tells Joe that no one wants him in Silvertown. Clem threatens Robby and exclaims that they are Joe's family. Robby challenges Joe to a race and Joe leaves him in the dust as Robby's car malfunctions and breaks down. As they drive away, Zander dedicates [[If You Want My Love|a song]] to Joe on the radio.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[David Spade]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Dirt (''n\u00e9'' Nunamaker)\n** [[Erik Per Sullivan]] as Young Joe Dirt\n* [[Brittany Daniel]] as Brandy\n* [[Dennis Miller]] as Zander Kelly\n* [[Adam Beach]] as Kickin' Wing\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Anthony Benedetti/Clem Doore/[[Gert Frobe|Gert B.
