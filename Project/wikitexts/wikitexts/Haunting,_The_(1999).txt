Its plot follows a group of people who gather at a sprawling estate in [[western Massachusetts]] for an apparent volunteer study on [[insomnia]], only to find themselves plagued by paranormal events connected to the home's grim history. Based on the 1959 novel ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'' by [[Shirley Jackson]], it is the second feature film adaptation of the source material after [[Robert Wise]]'s [[The Haunting (1963 film)|1963 film adaptation of the same name]].\n\nDevelopment for ''The Haunting'' originally began as a collaboration between filmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]] and writer [[Stephen King]], who together began writing a new adaptation of Jackson's novel, largely inspired by Wise's 1963 film version. After creative differences, the project was aborted, with King retooling his screenplay to form the 2002 [[miniseries]] ''[[Rose Red (miniseries)|Rose Red]]''. Spielberg meanwhile commissioned a new screenplay for the project, written by [[David Self]], to be produced under Spielberg's studio, [[DreamWorks Pictures]]. Filming of ''The Haunting'' began in the fall of 1998, with some location shoots occurring in England at [[Harlaxton Manor]] and [[Belvoir Castle]], though the majority of the film was shot in specially-crafted sets in [[Los Angeles]] by esteemed Argentine production designer [[Eugenio Zanetti]].\n\n''The Haunting'' premiered theatrically in North America in July 1999. Though met by largely negative reviews from film critics, it was a financial success, grossing $180 million worldwide against a production budget of $80 million.\n\n==Plot==\nEleanor \"Nell\" Vance, an [[insomnia]]c, has cared for her invalid mother for 11 years, sharing a [[Boston]] apartment with her. After her mother dies, Nell's sister Jane and her husband Lou inherit the residence. They eject Nell to prepare for a sale. As she faces [[homelessness]], Nell accepts an invitation to participate in an [[insomnia]] study by Dr. David Marrow at Hill House, a secluded [[manor house]] in the [[Berkshires]] of western [[Massachusetts]]. At the house, she meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, an eccentric pair of caretakers. Two other participants arrive: Luke Sanderson and the glamorous Theodora (\"Theo\"), along with Dr. Marrow and his two research assistants. Unknown to the participants, Dr. Marrow's true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear, intending to expose his subjects to terror.\n\nDuring their first night, Dr. Marrow relates the story of Hill House: Its original owner, [[Hugh Crain]], a 19th-century textile tycoon, constructed the rambling home for his wife Renee, hoping to populate it with a large family. Unfortunately, all of Crain's children were [[stillbirth|stillborn]]s, and Renee, devastated by the multiple losses, [[Suicide|killed herself]]. Crain became a recluse. Marrow's assistant is severely wounded in a freak accident and both research assistants leave for the hospital. Supernatural events begin happening, and Nell sees the ghosts of children. A large portrait of Hugh Crain is vandalized with the words \"Welcome Home Eleanor\" written in blood. Theo and Luke accuse Nell, claiming she is seeking attention.\n\nNell becomes determined to prove that the house is [[Haunted house|haunted]]. She finds Crain's hidden office and learns that he extensively used [[child labor]] in his [[cotton mills]]. He tortured and killed several orphans in his home, then burned their bodies in the fireplace. She surmises that these children's spirits are trapped in the house, providing Crain with an \"eternal family\". Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, from whom Nell is descended. Dr. Marrow is skeptical of Nell's claims and soon reveals his true fear study to the group, but after a statue tries to drown him, he realizes Hill House is haunted. Nell reveals that she is related to Carolyn Crain and must help the children \"move on\" to the [[afterlife]].\n\nDr. Marrow demands that everyone leave Hill House, but Hugh Crain's ghost traps them inside. Luke defaces a portrait of Crain, enraging his spirit to [[Decapitation|decapitate]] Luke. When Crain himself manifests, Dr. Marrow and Theo hide in the house while Nell distracts him. Realizing that he thrived on the fear he created in children, Nell declares she is not afraid of him. Her declaration weakens the ghost and he is cast into a decorative bronze door depicting distressed children in a [[purgatory]]-like scene. He drags Nell with him, but the spirits release her and she dies. Nell\u2019s soul, along with those of the freed children, rise to heaven.\n\nThe following morning, Dr. Marrow and Theo meet the Dudleys at the front gate, where Mr. Dudley asks the doctor if he found out what he wanted to know. Dr. Marrow and Theo leave without saying a word, and leave Hill House behind.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as Eleanor \"Nell\" Vance\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Dr. David Marrow\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Theodora (\"Theo\")\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Luke Sanderson\n* [[Marian Seldes]] as Mrs. Dudley\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Mr. Dudley\n* Alix Koromzay as Mary Lambetta\n* [[Todd Field]] as Todd Hackett\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as Jane Vance\n* [[Tom Irwin (actor)|Tom Irwin]] as Lou\n* Charles Gunning as [[Hugh Crain]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{expand section|date=November 2014}}\nFilmmaker [[Steven Spielberg]] approached horror author [[Stephen King]] in 1996 about making a haunted house film, and the two agreed that [[Robert Wise]]'s 1963 film ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' was a benchmark of cinematic house horror.
