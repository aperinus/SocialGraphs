The film follows a geeky college student ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]) making his way through a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[zombie apocalypse]], meeting three strangers ([[Woody Harrelson]], [[Emma Stone]], and [[Abigail Breslin]]) along the way and together taking an extended [[road trip]] across the Southwestern United States in an attempt to find a sanctuary free from [[zombie]]s.\n\nThe film premiered at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 25, 2009, and was theatrically released on October 2, 2009, in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]]. ''Zombieland'' was a critical and commercial success, grossing more than $60.8 million in 17 days and surpassing the 2004 film ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' as the top-grossing zombie film in the U.S. until ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]'' in 2013. A sequel, ''[[Zombieland: Double Tap]]'', was released in 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nThree months have passed since a [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of [[mad cow disease]] mutated into \"mad person disease\" that became \"mad zombie disease\", which overran the entire United States (with the infection presumably spreading to the rest of the world), turning many [[Americans]] into vicious zombies. Survivors of the zombie epidemic have learned that growing attached to other survivors is not advisable because they could die at any moment, so many have taken to using their city of origin as nicknames.\n\nA lonely college student is making his way from his college dorm in [[Austin, Texas]], to [[Columbus, Ohio]], to see whether his parents are still alive. Columbus encounters another survivor heading to [[Tallahassee]], a hardened [[redneck]]. Tallahassee reluctantly allows Columbus to travel with him. He mentions to Columbus that he misses his puppy, \"Buck\", that was killed by zombies, as well as his addiction to [[Twinkie]]s, which he actively tries to find.\n\nThe pair meets [[Confidence trick|con artist]] sisters [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] and [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], who trick Tallahassee and Columbus into handing over their weapons by pretending that Little Rock is infected by the disease, then stealing their [[Cadillac Escalade|Escalade]]. The two men find a yellow [[Hummer H2]] loaded with weapons and go after the sisters. However, the girls spring another trap for them and take them hostage. Tallahassee steals his gun back and has a stand-off with Wichita, until Columbus intervenes saying that they have bigger problems to worry about, resulting in an uneasy truce between them.\n\nThe sisters reveal that they are going to the Pacific Playland [[amusement park]] in [[Los Angeles]], an area supposedly free of zombies. After learning his hometown has been destroyed, and his parents likely killed, Columbus decides to accompany the others. Along the trip, Columbus becomes attracted to Wichita, but is wary of a relationship due to his first experience with a zombie being a college dormmate he also had a crush on.\n\nWhen the group reaches Hollywood, Tallahassee directs them to the mansion of his celebrity crush, [[Bill Murray]], to stay for the night. Tallahassee and Wichita meet Murray himself, uninfected but disguised as a zombie so he can walk safely around town. They try playing a prank on Columbus and Little Rock by having him pretend to be a real zombie, only for Columbus to accidentally kill Murray. Columbus realizes during a game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] that \"Buck\" was actually Tallahassee's son, who had become infected and died as a result. While at Murray's mansion, Tallahassee bonds with Little Rock, with whom he was previously feuding. Despite Wichita's attraction to Columbus, she fears attachment and leaves with Little Rock for Pacific Playland the next morning. Columbus decides to go after Wichita and convinces Tallahassee to join him.\n\nAt Pacific Playland, the sisters activate all the rides and lights so they can enjoy the park, only to unwittingly draw the attention of a multitude of zombies in the surrounding area. A chase ensues, and just as the sisters are trapped on a drop tower ride, Tallahassee and Columbus arrive. Tallahassee lures the zombies away, creating a distraction for Columbus to get to the tower ride; both using the attractions to their advantage. Tallahassee eventually locks himself in a game booth, shooting zombies as they arrive. Columbus successfully evades and shoots through several zombies to reach the tower and help the girls down, but not before changing one of his rules for survival to conquer his fear of clowns while facing off against a clown zombie. As a show of gratitude, Wichita kisses Columbus and reveals her real name: Krista. As the group leaves Pacific Playland, Columbus realizes that without relating to other people, one might as well be a zombie and that he now has what he has always wanted\u2014a family.\n\n===The rules===\n{{see also|Zombieland: Double Tap#The rules}}\n<!-- BEFORE YOU EDIT THE RULES, please join us on the discussion page; your edit may have already been discussed -->\n\nA running gag (and a central theme throughout the film) is the list of rules Columbus comes up with for surviving in the zombie-infested world. By the end of the film, his list has 33 rules, yet only a few are mentioned. A series of promotional videos starring [[Woody Harrelson]] and [[Jesse Eisenberg]] expanded on the list presented in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zombieland.com/clips/|title=Sony Pictures|work=Zombieland|access-date=January 14, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016181947/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/zombieland/clips/|archive-date=October 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"33rules\" />\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n{{ordered list\n| 1 = \"[[Aerobic exercise|Cardio]]\"<ref name=\"therules-ign\" /><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4smD0xy6w08 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/4smD0xy6w08 |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|title=Zombieland Rule # 1 - Cardio|publisher=Sony Pictures Entertainment|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n| 2 = \"[[Double tap]]\"<ref name=\"The Rules\"/> (\"[[Ziploc]] bags\" in a deleted scene)<ref name=\"ziploc\">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xc1htr|title=Zombieland - Deleted Scene: Ziploc Bags|publisher=Dread Central|via=dailymotion}}</ref>\n| 3 = \"Beware of bathrooms\"<ref name=\"The Rules\"/>\n| 4 = \"Seatbelts\"<ref name=\"The Rules\">{{cite AV media|title=Zombieland clip 'The Rules'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI_JONTVVuE |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/OI_JONTVVuE |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|publisher=Sony Pictures Releasing UK|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n| item5_value = 5 | 5 = \"No Attachments\"<ref name=\"33rules\">{{cite web |date= 8 July 2019 |author= Kara Hedash |title= Zombieland: All 33 Of Columbus' Survival Rules |url= https://screenrant.com/zombieland-movie-columbus-survival-rules-explained-jesse-eisenberg/ |website= [[ScreenRant]] |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190709132641/https://screenrant.com/zombieland-movie-columbus-survival-rules-explained-jesse-eisenberg/ | archive-date= 2019-07-09 }}</ref>\n| item6_value = 6 | 6 = \"Cast iron skillet\"<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POtndU2h8yI |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/POtndU2h8yI |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|title=Zombieland Rule # 6 - Skillet|publisher=Sony Pictures Entertainment|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name=\"therules-ign\">{{cite web |date= 18 Oct 2019 |author= Terri Schwartz |title= Zombieland: Full List of Columbus's (Official) Rules for Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse |url= https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/18/zombieland-rules-full-list-columbus-official-and-deleted-scenes |website= IGN }}</ref><ref name=\"screenrant\" />\n| item7_value = 7 | 7 = \"Travel light\"<ref name=\"The Rules\"/>\n| item8_value = 8 | 8 = \"Get a kickass partner\"<ref name=\"33rules\" />\n| item9_value = 9 | 9 = \"With Your Bare Hands\"<ref name=\"33rules\" />\n| item10_value = 10 | 10 = \"Don\u2019t Swing Low\"<ref name=\"33rules\" />\n| item11_value = 11 | 11 = \"Use Your Feet\"<ref name=\"33rules\" />\n| item12_value = 12 | 12 = \"[[Bounty (brand)|Bounty]] paper towels\"<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohvY7d4RrxY |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/ohvY7d4RrxY |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|title=Zombieland Rule # 12 - Bounty Paper Towels|publisher=Sony Pictures Entertainment|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n| item15_value = 15 | 15 = \"Bowling ball\"<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_DYIUNYs84 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/5_DYIUNYs84 |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|title=Zombieland Rule #15 - Bowling Ball|publisher=Sony Pictures Entertainment|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n| item17_value = 17 | 17 = \"Don't be a hero\";
