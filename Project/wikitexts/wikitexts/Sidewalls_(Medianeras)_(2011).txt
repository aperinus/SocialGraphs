Mart\u00edn is a web designer, and takes up photography as a way to cope with his fear of the city. Mariana, an aspiring architect, is forced to move back into her old apartment after a breakup. Living solitary lives in one-room \"shoebox\" apartments, they both contemplate the changing cityscape, and struggle with [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]] and loneliness, feeling disconnected from other people in the digital age.\n\n'''\"A Short Autumn\"'''\n\nWitnessing a series of accidents on the street \u2013 a prostitute's dog jumps from a balcony, causing a passer-by to be struck by a taxi and another to have a heart attack \u2013 Mart\u00edn and Mariana separately stop to help. Mart\u00edn is diagnosed with a harmless case of [[Intervertebral disc disorder|discarthrosis]], and has adopted his ex-girlfriend's dog after she abandoned them both to move to the United States. Mariana, working as a [[window dresser]], finds herself talking to the store mannequins she assembles at home. She rediscovers one of her favorite ''[[Where's Wally?]]'' books, with a page she has never been able to solve. Ignoring a call from her ex-boyfriend, she thinks back on the end of their four-year relationship.\n\n'''\"A Long Winter\"'''\n\nMart\u00edn and Mariana pass frequently in the street without meeting. Spending most of his time online, Mart\u00edn orders a new desk chair and hires a dogwalker, Ana. They begin dating, but she is already in a relationship and disappears from his life. Mariana agrees to a date with a client, Lucas, at a restaurant at the top of a skyscraper. Explaining her phobia of elevators, she takes the stairs, to Lucas' dismay; as he waits at their table, she is overcome with anxiety and leaves. Finding Mart\u00edn's old chair at the curb, she brings it home, and deletes all her pictures of her ex-boyfriend. She tells the story of the famed [[Kavanagh building]], and is drawn to the music from a neighbor's new piano. Mart\u00edn tries online dating and meets Marcela, a manic [[Multilingualism|polyglot]], but their date ends in disappointment. He begins swimming at Mariana's local pool, where she  connects with fellow avid swimmer Rafa. They share an enjoyable date, and Mariana reacts kindly when Rafa experiences [[erectile dysfunction]], but he deserts her.\n\n'''\"Spring at Last\"'''\n\nMariana reflects on the unremarkable exterior \"sidewalls\" of the city's buildings. Seeking change in her life, she gets a lip piercing, and she and Mart\u00edn each have a new window installed in their apartments. They unknowingly look out at each other while listening to \"[[Retired Boxer|True Love Will Find You in the End]]\" on the radio, and are both moved to tears by the ending of ''[[Manhattan (1979 film)|Manhattan]]'' on TV. By chance, they connect with each other online in an anonymous [[chat room]], but just as Mariana asks for Mart\u00edn's phone number, the city is plunged in a [[Power outage|blackout]]. Buying candles at the same store in the dark, they unwittingly share a [[Static electricity|static shock]] before going their separate ways. Later, from her window, Mariana spots Mart\u00edn walking his dog, wearing a red-and-white-striped sweater similar to that of ''Where's Wally?'' She races down to the street, and they finally meet face-to-face. During the closing credits, Mart\u00edn and Mariana \u2013 now living happily together \u2013 record a home video, [[lip-sync]]ing to \"[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* {{ill|Javier Drolas|es}} as Mart\u00edn\n* [[Pilar L\u00f3pez de Ayala]] as Mariana\n* [[In\u00e9s Efron]] as Ana\n* {{ill|Rafael Ferro|es}} as Rafa\n* [[Jorge Lanata]] as doctor\n* [[Carla Peterson (actress)|Carla Peterson]] as Marcela\n* [[Adri\u00e1n Navarro]] as Lucas\n* [[Alan Pauls]] as Mariana's ex-boyfriend\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1235841}}\n\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:2011 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s Argentine films]]\n[[Category:2010s German films]]\n[[Category:2010s Spanish films]]\n[[Category:2010s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Argentine comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Buenos Aires]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Buenos Aires]]\n[[Category:German comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish comedy-drama films]]"}]}}}}
