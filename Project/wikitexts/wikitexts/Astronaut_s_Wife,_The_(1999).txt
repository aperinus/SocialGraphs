It stars [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Charlize Theron]].\n\nThe film was released on August 27, 1999. It received negative reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\nSpencer Armacost is an astronaut working for [[NASA]], and his wife Jillian is a second-grade teacher. While he and Alex Streck are walking in space on a mission, an explosion knocks out their communication with the command center.\n\nThey land safely, but when their spouses arrive to see them they are in the hospital; both asleep until they recover. Armacost eventually wakes up without problems, but Streck has a medical emergency requiring him to have an electrical [[cardioversion]]. Neither speak about the in-flight emergency. Armacost accepts a position with a New York-based company, McClaren. At a farewell party, Streck's aggressive behavior catches Jillian's attention before he suddenly dies from what NASA attributes to a stroke. Streck's wife, Natalie, electrocutes herself in the bath with a radio.\n\nIn New York at a party, Jillian asks Spencer to tell her about the space walk incident. He answers vaguely, and then has aggressive sex with her. Soon afterward, she finds out she is pregnant with twins. She tells the doctor that earlier in her life, after her parents died, she sought psychiatric care because she started to see her loved ones dead, including herself.\n\nSherman Reese has been terminated from NASA because he continued to insist that something was wrong with Spencer, though all tests came back normal. Reese confronts Jillian to warn her, and she leaves in fear, wanting to believe he is crazy but knowing he is right about Spencer being different. Jillian calls Reese and he tells her that Natalie was pregnant with twins at the time of her suicide. Jillian asks what the autopsy showed about the twins and Reese tells Jillian that he needs to meet her in person to show her. Spencer intercepts him, and he goes missing. As a backup plan, he has sent her a key to a self storage locker that has a [[VHS]] video cassette that explains that there was a signal in space near Spencer and Streck when they lost contact with NASA. He believes the signal was an alien that wanted to get to Earth and traveled as a radio wave through space, taking over Spencer's body. He believes it will use her twins to pilot the McClaren plane that it is designing that disables warfare machinery. Jillian attempts a medical abortion but is thwarted by Spencer who slaps her. She throws herself down a flight of stairs and wakes up in the hospital. Spencer tells her that the twins survived the fall and intimidates her to keep silent about what had happened.\n\nIn a dream, Jillian sees her sister, Nan, killed by Spencer when she questions why he has Reese's briefcase. Jillian leaves the hospital on her own but Spencer follows her because of his connection with the twins inside her. At home, Jillian barricades the door and goes into the room where she dreamed her sister was killed. She sees her body on the floor, but then it is gone, presumably a vision. When Spencer breaks his way into the apartment, she has flooded the kitchen floor with water, with a radio in the sink and an extension cord plugged into the wall. She holds the ends of the cords in each hand and tells Spencer to stay away from her. She notices bloody nail marks on Spencer's hand and she knows that her sister really is dead, as she dreamed. She tells Spencer she does not know who he is, that he killed her sister and her husband. He tells her he did, and that he lives inside of her now. Water begins pouring down from the ceiling, as Jillian turned on all of the water in the bathroom upstairs. Spencer is engulfed in the water, Jillian lifts her feet off the wet floor, connects the cords and electrocutes the alien. The alien leaves Spencer's body and transmits into Jillian.\n\nJillian has remarried and her twin sons are off on their first day of school. Her sons look back before boarding the bus with a look on their face before they smile and are on their way. Jillian assures the stepfather that he is now their father.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Commander Spencer Armacost \n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Jillian Armacost \n* [[Joe Morton]] as Sherman Reese, NASA Representative \n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Nan \n* [[Donna Murphy]] as Natalie Streck \n* [[Nick Cassavetes]] as Capt.
