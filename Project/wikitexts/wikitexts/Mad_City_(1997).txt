Barry]], and [[Larry King]]. This is Costa-Gavras' first English-language film since ''[[Music Box (film)|Music Box]]'' (1989). The title comes from a nickname of [[Madison, Wisconsin#Nicknames|Madison, Wisconsin]], where it originally was going to be set,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dudek|first1=Duane|title=Before the state Capitol protests there was 'Mad City'|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/119847889.html|publisher=Journal Sentinel|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref> and was used for its multiple meanings.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter being sacked from his job at a museum, former security guard Sam Baily returns to the place with a shotgun and dynamite and takes his former boss Mrs. Banks and a number of children (at the museum on a school field trip) as hostages. Local television journalist Max Brackett is in the museum using the restroom after an interview with the curator about financial difficulties. He becomes directly involved in the hostage situation, acting as Baily's intermediary to the outside world and the police.\n\nBaily accidentally shoots a friend of his, Cliff, who's still working there as a security guard, sending him to the hospital. He later fires the weapon again, frightening the children and becoming increasingly unstable as he takes caffeine pills to stay awake. Along with the young intern coworker Laurie among the growing [[media circus]] outside, Brackett reports the inside story exclusively on television, reviving his career. By being free to come and go, he negotiates with a national network and its star news anchorman, Kevin Hollander, with whom Brackett has an unhappy history.\n\nBaily wants the police to let him return home to his wife and kids, refusing to accept that he's going to jail. Brackett, on the other hand, makes a deal rather than let Hollander have the story, prompting Hollander to publicly accuse Brackett of prolonging the crisis and endangering the children. Laurie then betrays Brackett, proving that, like him, she's willing to do whatever it takes to further her own career.\n\nWhen his friend Cliff dies, Baily starts to realize he's lost everything. Baily and Brackett allow the situation to worsen until the police finally have had enough, issuing a five-minute ultimatum to Baily for release of the hostages. Baily lets the children and Mrs. Banks go. He also sends out Brackett to try to convince the police to put down their guns so he could personally usher out Baily. But rather than face prison and his wife Baily locks the museum doors on Brackett, who's outside trying to get the police to listen.\n\nBrackett tries to get him to come out, but Baily ignores him. Brackett is unaware that Baily has decided to set off his explosives, committing suicide. The blast knocks Brackett off his feet and into the parking lot, sending debris everywhere. As reporters surround Brackett to ask about Baily, all he can say is, \"We killed him,\" referring to how the media handled the situation.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Travolta]] as Sam Baily\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Max Brackett\n* [[Mia Kirshner]] as Laurie Callahan\n* [[Alan Alda]] as Kevin Hollander\n* [[Ted Levine]] as Chief Alvin Lemke\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Lou Potts\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as Cliff Williams\n* [[Kyla Pratt]] as Kid\n* [[Lucinda Jenney]] as Jenny\n* [[William Atherton]] as Dohlen\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as Brackett's agent\n* [[Raymond J.
