Marking Vidler's directorial debut, the film was adapted from the [[Blackrock (play)|play of the same name]], also written by Enright, which was inspired by the [[murder of Leigh Leigh]]. The film stars [[Laurence Breuls]], [[Simon Lyndon]] and [[Linda Cropper]], and also features the first credited film performance of [[Heath Ledger]]. The film follows Jared (Breuls), a young surfer who witnesses his friends raping a girl. When she is found murdered the next day, Jared is torn between revealing what he saw and protecting his friends.\n\nLeigh's family opposed the fictionalisation of her murder, though protests against the film were abandoned after it received financial backing from the [[New South Wales Film and Television Office]]. ''Blackrock'' was filmed over a period of two weeks at locations including [[Stockton, New South Wales|Stockton]], where Leigh was murdered, a decision that was opposed by local residents who said that memories of the murder were still fresh. While the film was never marketed as being based on a true story, numerous comparisons between the murder and the film were made, and many viewers believed it to be a factual account of the murder.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], and was also shown at the [[Boston Film Festival]], though it failed to find an American theatrical distributor. It was nominated for five [[AACTA Awards]], including Best Film, and won the Feature Film \u2013 Adaptation award as well as the [[Major AWGIE Award|Major Award]] at the 1997 [[AWGIE Awards]]. It received generally positive reviews in Australia, where it grossed $1.1 million at the box office. Outside Australia, where audiences were less familiar with Leigh's murder, critical reception of the film was mixed.\n\n== Plot ==\nBlackrock is an Australian beachside working-class suburb{{efn|The suburb of Blackrock is fictional and is not to be confused with the similarly-named [[Melbourne]] suburb [[Black Rock, Victoria]].}} in which [[surfing]] is popular among youths like Jared ([[Laurence Breuls]]). His first serious girlfriend is Rachel ([[Jessica Napier]]), who comes from a much wealthier part of the city. One day, Ricko ([[Simon Lyndon]]), a surfer popular among the local youths, returns from an eleven-month trip. Jared's mother, Diane ([[Linda Cropper]]), attempts to tell Jared that she has been diagnosed with [[breast cancer]], but Jared insists on talking to her later as he is busy arranging a \"welcome home\" party for Ricko at the local surf club. Rachel's father, a photographer who takes provocative images of women, forbids her from attending the party but allows her older brother, Toby ([[Heath Ledger]]), to attend.\n\nWhile driving to the party, Toby sees Tracy ([[Bojana Novakovic]]), Cherie ([[Rebecca Smart]]) and two other girls and gives them a ride. Jared flirts with Tracy at the party and then gets into a fight with Toby. Ricko comes to Jared's defence, but Jared breaks up the fight after Ricko hits Toby several times. Tracy comes to comfort Toby, and Jared leaves the party to head to the beach alone. Jared sees Toby having consensual sex with Tracy on the beach. He then witnesses three of his male friends interrupting the couple and raping Tracy. Tracy calls out for help, but Jared, who is visibly disturbed by what he is witnessing, does not intervene. Toby and the other three boys, who never noticed Jared was watching, flee the area. Jared also runs away and leaves Tracy alone and distressed. Later that night Rachel, who has sneaked out of home to attend the party, finds Tracy's beaten corpse on the beach.\n\nJared initially tells the police nothing of what he saw. He is torn between the need to tell the truth and the desire to protect his friends. His anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder. However, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko, who confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident. She hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of [[mateship]]. Diane, who still has not been able to tell Jared that she has cancer because of his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.\n\nJared tells the police that he was with Ricko. When he tries to suggest Tracy's death may have been an accident, the police show him the photos of Tracy's battered body. Jared aggressively confronts Ricko at the beach, and Ricko confesses that Tracy's death was not an accident. He had found her walking on the beach after the rape, and she asked him to take her home. He agreed but wanted to have sex with her first. She tried to fight him off and bit him in the process, which enraged him enough to beat her to death.\n\nAs Ricko finishes his confession, the police arrive, and he realises that Jared has turned him in. He attempts to escape, but the police give chase and corner him on a cliff. Rather than go to jail and ignoring Jared's screams of protest, he jumps to his death. In the weeks that follow, Jared's life collapses. Despite learning of Diane's illness, he moves out of her house and chooses instead to be homeless. Jared returns home one day to collect his belongings; after arguing with Diane, he confesses that he witnessed Tracy's rape and could have saved her life if he had intervened or helped her afterwards. Later that day, Jared joins Diane and Cherie in cleaning graffiti from Tracy's grave.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Laurence Breuls]] as Jared Kirby\n* [[Simon Lyndon]] as Brett \"Ricko\" Ricketson\n* [[Linda Cropper]] as Diane Kirby\n* [[Jessica Napier]] as Rachel Ackland\n* [[Rebecca Smart]] as Cherie Milenko\n* [[Bojana Novakovic]] as Tracy Warner (as Boyana Novakovich)\n* [[Leeanna Walsman]] as Shana\n* Nichole Stewart as Leanne (as Nichole Avramidis)\n* [[Justine Clarke]] as Tiffany\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as Toby Ackland\n* Cameron Nugent as Jason\n* Brendan Donoghue as Dave\n* [[Jade Gatt]] as Scottie\n* George Basha as Kemel\n* Shayne Francis as Glenys Milenko\n* Jeanette Cronin as Lesley Warner\n* [[David Field (actor)|David Field]] as Ken Warner\n* [[Geoff Morrell (actor)|Geoff Morrell]] as Stewart Ackland\n* Julie Haseler as Marian Ackland\n* [[Chris Haywood]] as Det.

The film's portrayal of a rape and murder at a teenage party suggests that serious crime can arise from drinking and fun simply getting out of hand. The violence, they say, erupts from extreme [[larrikin|larikkinism]] rather than the archetypal psychopathy seen in other films featuring violence towards women. The film's critique of criminal masculinity undermines the status of previously celebrated masculine lawbreakers in Australian history and cinema, such as [[Ned Kelly]] and [[Michael \"Crocodile\" Dundee|Mick Dundee]]. The authors believe that the focus on masculinity leaves the female victim largely out of the film; they consider the \"near erasure\" of Tracy to be a troubling aspect; the film instead focuses on portraying the males as victims of their class, masculinity and mateship.{{sfn|Holland|1999|pages=79\u201380}}\n\nDirector Steven Vidler said the film was not about a rape, rather it was \"about the culture that allowed it to happen.\" Vidler defended the choice to give the rape victim a minor role, stating, \"It was important to show that this could have happened to anyone. We didn't want to give away too much about the victim so we could maintain that suspense.\"<ref name=lads/> Producer [[David Elfick]] said that the film was about contemporary Australia; about \"kids who have all their life to enjoy, then a deadly mixture of drugs, alcohol, sexual tension, and desire add up to a tragedy.\"<ref name=jane/>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Theatrical origins===\n{{main|Blackrock (play)}}\n\nBrian Joyce, the director of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]'s Freewheels Theatre in Education, approached playwright [[Nick Enright]], encouraging him to create a play that explored themes around the 1989 rape and [[murder of Leigh Leigh]] in [[Stockton, New South Wales|Stockton]], a beach area of Newcastle.{{sfn|Morrow|1996|page=477}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s821043.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028002103/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s821043.htm |archive-date=28 October 2014 |title=Tribute to Enright |author=Baillie, Rebecca |date=31 March 2003 |work=[[The 7.30 Report]] |access-date=28 January 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Leigh's family objected to the fictionalisation of her murder.{{sfn|Brien|2009}} Titled ''A Property of the Clan'', the 45-minute play premiered at the Freewheels Theatre in 1992 and was performed at the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] in 1993.{{sfn|Coyle|2005|pages=23\u201324}} The play was shown at various high-schools in the Newcastle area and, following its positive reception, was shown nationally at high schools across the country over a period of eighteen months.{{sfn|Enright|1996|page=i}}\n\nIn 1994, the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] commissioned Enright to develop the play into a feature-length production.{{sfn|Brien|2009}} The resulting play was titled ''[[Blackrock (play)|Blackrock]]''. ''Blackrock'' retained the original four characters from ''A Property of the Clan'',{{sfn|Enright|1996|page=i}} and added nine others; it was considered a more fictionalised version of Leigh's murder.{{sfn|Brien|2009}} The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience rather than for a specifically educational environment.<ref>{{cite news |last=McCallum |first=John |date=26 July 2005 |title=Between community and the mainstream stage |page=14 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] }}</ref>\n\n===Film adaptation===\nWhile the revisions to the play ''Blackrock'' were still being finalised, Enright started working with first-time director Steven Vidler to direct a film version,<ref name=robert/> which would also be titled ''Blackrock''.{{sfn|Brien|2009}} By December 1995, Vidler was working with Enright as an unofficial script editor, although they were having trouble finding financing for the film.

While acknowledging that the comments were understandable, Elfick concluded, \"Unfortunately, that event happens all over Australia. We wanted to take the events of that murder and many other murders\". He was also quoted in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' as saying, \"The movie is bigger than the Leigh Leigh thing\".<ref name=noir/> Elfick hoped that people viewing the film would see it as a positive way of looking at the circumstances that led to Leigh's death,<ref name=jane/> and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in the future.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[David Elfick]] |year=1996 |title=Blackrock |medium=David Elfick \u2013 Producer}}</ref> Leigh's family were vehemently opposed to the film, saying that the filmmakers were \"feasting on an unfortunate situation\",{{sfn|Brien|2009}} insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death, and portraying her negatively while doing so.{{sfn|Brien|2000|page=119}} One of Leigh's aunts wrote to ''The Newcastle Herald'' later that month, saying \"David Elfick doesn't seem to mind  free publicity even if it comes from the tragic and brutal assault, rape, and murder of a fourteen-year-old virgin, not as he called it: 'the Leigh Leigh thing which happens all over Australia.'\"{{sfn|Carrington|1998|page=155}} Enright said that while Leigh's murder served as the inspiration, the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another.<ref name=jane/>\n\n===Casting===\nSandy George from [[Australian Screen Online]] said that Vidler's long career as an actor helped him \"draw the terrific performances\" from the film's young actors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/blackrock/notes/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113072737/http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/blackrock/notes/ |archive-date=13 January 2015 |title=Blackrock (1996) |last1=George |first1=Sandy |work= [[Australian Screen Online]] |access-date=28 January 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> 17-year-old [[Laurence Breuls]] was literally the first person to audition for the role of Jared.

Vidler discussed the role with her parents before filming commenced, who despite initial reservations, eventually gave permission for her to film the scene. Novakovic said the experience was traumatic and she began to tremble uncontrollably once the shoot ended, though recovered shortly afterwards, concluding, \"In a way, I feel lucky to have had such a role at the beginning of my career. I don't think I'll ever be scared by an emotional scene again.\" The boys involved in the scene showed up at her door the following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a T-shirt that said \"[[shit happens]]\".<ref name=lads/> Vidler said he found the performance so powerful that when he first watched the [[Dailies|rushes]] of the scene alone, he burst into tears.<ref name=lads/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Blackrock: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = April 28, 1997\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe soundtrack to the film was released on  28 April 1997 on [[Mercury Records]] Australia.

Upon noting that the filmmakers deliberately insisted that their characters be portrayed as different from the actual people involved in the Leigh Leigh murder as possible, Drewe said the film is \"asking a lot of Australian audiences to expunge reality from their memories\", though he concluded that the film should be \"compulsory viewing for all Australian teenagers.\"<ref name=robert>{{cite news |last=Drewe |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Drewe |date=1 May 1997 |title=Flipside of the Anzac coin |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |page=16}}</ref> Rob Lowing from ''[[The Sun-Herald]]'' noted that the film belonged to a slew of [[Australasia]]n films that focused on [[middle class|middle class life]] and ultimately gave the film 3\u00bd stars out of 4, stating, \"if you went to see ''[[Romper Stomper]]'', ''[[Metal Skin]]'', ''[[Idiot Box (film)|Idiot Box]]'' or ''[[Once Were Warriors (film)|Once Were Warriors]]'', this gritty, punchy social drama ably fits into that class.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Lowing |first=Rob |date=4 May 1997 |title=Reviews |newspaper=[[The Sun-Herald]] |page=22}}</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Who Killed Leigh Leigh?'', [[Kerry Carrington]], a [[criminologist]] and prominent researcher of Leigh's murder, had both criticism and praise for the film. She praised it for dispelling \"the myth\" that sexual violence is confined to one [[social class]], for illustrating how boys model their sexual conduct on their fathers' treatment of women, and how the culture of [[sex segregation]] in workplaces can carry over into the public life of a town, exacerbating sexist beliefs and behaviours. She criticised the film, however, for the \"strong impression\" it makes that ineffectual mothers are part of the underlying problem and for several differences between Leigh's murder and the film that she considered to be disrespectful to Leigh's memory, in particular the film's \"Hollywood ending\".{{sfn|Carrington|1998|pages=155\u2013156}}\n\nDonna Lee Brien stated that just as the filmmakers attempted to distance themselves from Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from ''Blackrock''. A 1999 feature in ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from [[Mel Gibson]]'s 1977 debut film ''[[Summer City]]'' to a [[short film]] festival that year, but made no mention of ''Blackrock''.{{sfn|Brien|2000|page=120}} Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.{{sfn|Brien|2000|page=120}}\n\n===Home media===\nA [[DVD region code|region 1]] DVD was released on 29 October 2002 containing the original version of the film.<ref name=cd>{{cite web |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/movie/pid/1201445/a/blackrock.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20141219084844/http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/movie/pid/1201445/a/blackrock.htm |archive-date=19 December 2014 |url-status=live |title=Blackrock DVD |work=[[CD Universe]] |access-date=28 December 2014}}</ref> A region 4 DVD was released on 19 November 2003 containing the edited version.

According to Andrew L. Urban from Urban Cinefile the featurette was \"overburdened\" with clips from the film, but was otherwise of interest.

Tracy wears a short skirt, tight-fitting top, and [[Wedge (footwear)|wedged-heels]] to the party, while Leigh wore ordinary shorts, a [[Sweater|jumper]], and sand-shoes.{{sfn|Brien|2009}}{{sfn|Carrington|1998|page=157}} Tracy's body is found that night by a girl; Leigh's body was found the next day by a boy.{{sfn|Brien|2009}} Tracy's mother packs up her daughter's bedroom the following day, whereas Leigh's mother left her room untouched for months. In the film, police labour until every boy involved in the rape and murder is punished,{{sfn|Carrington|1998|pages=155\u2013156}} whereas no one was convicted for raping Leigh and [[Murder of Leigh Leigh#Criticism of police|police received criticism for alleged incompetence]]. Tracy's murderer was  22 years old, well-toned, and committed suicide, while Leigh's was 18 years old, {{Convert|120|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and was jailed.{{sfn|Brien|2009}}\n\nBoth murderers, however, were high-school dropouts who were interested in mechanics, were considered to have no emotional depth, and were prone to violence. The party in the film was considered to be \"an almost perfect re-creation\" of the party in Stockton; a surf club is hired for the night with teenage attendees being entertained by a high-school band. The party spills out into the surrounding area where there are fights, and teenagers are seen stumbling, vomiting and unconscious. Tracy's funeral was also considered to be \"a direct re-staging\" of Leigh's service; both Leigh and Tracy's friends placed red roses on her coffin and then plant a tree in her memory. Both Leigh and Tracy's mothers worked at a nursing home and both their fathers called for the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for her murderer. Parents are blamed for neglecting their children in both cases.{{sfn|Brien|2009}}\n\nDetails that were considered to be undoubtedly taken from Leigh's murder included the filming location of Stockton, the presence of the song \"[[If I Could Turn Back Time]]\" featured at Leigh's funeral appearing in the original script (though it did not appear in the finished film), and posters reading \"Shame Blackrock Shame\" seen on telegraph poles following Tracy's murder;{{sfn|Carrington|1998|page=157}} posters appeared around Stockton following Leigh's murder stating \"Shame Stockton Shame: [[Informant|Dob]] the gutless bastards in\".{{sfn|Brien|2009}}\n\n==Accolades==\n''Blackrock'' received five nominations at the 1997 [[AACTA Awards]], though did not win any awards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aacta.org/winners-nominees/1990-1999/1997.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218161814/http://www.aacta.org/winners-nominees/1990-1999/1997.aspx |archive-date=18 December 2014 |title=1997 Winners & Nominees |work=[[AACTA Awards]] |access-date=18 December 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.australiantelevision.net/awards/afi1997.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120803062948/http://www.australiantelevision.net/awards/afi1997.html |archive-date=3 August 2012 |url-status=live |title=Australian Film Institute Awards |work=Australian Television Information Archive |access-date=23 December 2014}}</ref> It won both the 'Feature Film&nbsp;\u2013 Adaptation' award and the [[Major AWGIE Award|Major Award]] at the 1997 [[AWGIE Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.australiantelevision.net/awards/awgie1997.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130221044038/http://www.australiantelevision.net/awards/awgie1997.html |archive-date=21 February 2013 |url-status=live |title=Australian Writers' Guild Awards |work=Australian Television Information Archive |access-date=18 December 2014}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
