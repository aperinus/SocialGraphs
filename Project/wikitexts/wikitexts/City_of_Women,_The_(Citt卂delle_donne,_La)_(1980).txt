Sn\u00e0poraz follows her into the woods, through a wilderness and into a Grand Hotel overrun with women in attendance for a [[surrealistic]] feminist convention. He winds up in a conference about [[polyandry]], where his presence is rejected. A frightened Sn\u00e0poraz retreats to the hotel lobby, but the exit is blocked; instead he seeks refuge inside an elevator with a girl, Donatella, who offers her assistance.\n\nDonatella leads Sn\u00e0poraz into a gymnasium and forces him to don [[roller skates]]. He is yet again cornered and berated by a group of angry women who circle around him in roller skates and practice testicle-kicking with a dummy. Dazed, Sn\u00e0poraz makes his exit down a flight of stairs, falling down and hurting himself, and into the domain of a burly woman tending to the hotel's furnace. The woman offers him a ride to the train station on her motorcycle, but she stops by a farm and lures Sn\u00e0poraz into a nursery, where she tries to rape him. The rape is cut short by the woman's mother, who steps in to chastise her daughter. Sn\u00e0poraz escapes and follows a lonely woman through the countryside. He joins her and her girlfriends in a car ride on the promise of being delivered to the station, but the ride goes on well into the night, the women smoking [[marijuana]] and listening to [[Italo disco]]. A frustrated Sn\u00e0poraz ditches the women only to be harassed by others. He finally finds shelter at mansion of Dr. Xavier Katzone, who shoots at his persecutors.\n\nDr. Katzone promises to deliver Sn\u00e0poraz to the train station in the morning and invites him to stay for a party. Sn\u00e0poraz walks around Katzone's extravagant home, which is filled with sexual imagery and [[Obelisk|phallic sculptures]]. He is also fascinated by a collection of photographs on the manor walls commemorating Katzone's sexual conquests; the photos light up and whisper arousing dialogue. Taking pride in his many inventions, Katzone celebrates his 10,000th conquest with an eccentric party that involves the blowing out of 10,000 candles and a performance by his wife, in which she sucks coins and pearls into her vagina by means of [[telekinesis]]. During the party, Sn\u00e0poraz comes across his ex-wife, Elena, who has a drunken argument with him, and meets Donatella again.\n\nThe police (composed solely of women dressed in Nazi attire) arrive, interrupting Katzone mid-song and announcing the imminent demolition of his house. They also inform him that they have shot his most beloved dog, Italo, which a grieving Katzone buries. Meanwhile, Sn\u00e0poraz dances to a song by [[Fred Astaire]] with a scantily clad Donatella and a friend of hers, but he fails to sleep with either of them, instead getting stuck in bed with his ex-wife. Hearing strange noises, he crawls under the bed, entering another dream-like world in which he slides down a toboggan, revisiting his childhood crushes (a sitter, a nurse, a prostitute) along the way. Caged at the end of the slide, he is transported before a strange court and judged for his masculinity. Dismissed and set free, he climbs into a towering boxing ring before a female crowd. At the top of the ring he boards a hot air balloon in the form of Donatella. Donatella herself fires at him from below with a machine-gun, bursting the balloon and sending Sn\u00e0poraz plummeting.\n\nSn\u00e0poraz wakes up on the very same train from the beginning of the film, indicating the entire story has been a mere nightmare. Just as he comes to this conclusion, he realizes his glasses are broken (as in his dream) and that the wagon is filled by the women that crowded his dream. The train races into a tunnel as the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Sn\u00e0poraz\n* [[Anna Prucnal]] as Elena\n* [[Bernice Stegers]] as Woman on train\n* [[Donatella Damiani]] as Donatella (Woman on roller skates)\n* Iole Silvani as Motorcyclist\n* [[Ettore Manni]] as Dr. Xavier Katzone\n* [[Fiammetta Baralla]] as Onlio\n* H\u00e9l\u00e8ne G.

From a stylistic point of view, it's less homogeneous than usual but other parts of the film are delightful. For instance, when fantasy is used to create types of people rather than caricatures. In this sense Fellini, having abandoned his gallery of monsters, becomes more prosaic. Or when the ambiguity of certain characters - an excellent example is the soubrette played by the charming Donatella Damiani - provides a touch of grace and bitchiness; or when the film becomes almost a musical; or when paradox becomes surrealist, such as the party and the hurricane at the villa of Katzone who's in despair because his favourite dog has died\".<ref>Review first published in ''Corriere della Sera'' ([[Rome]]) on 29 March 1980. Fava and Vigano, 179</ref>\n\n\"Fellini appears as the [[Madame Bovary]] of his adolescence\", wrote Claudio G. Fava for ''Corriere Mercantile''. \"He revels in the enjoyment he feels at working with an experienced crew, side by side with faithful technicians who simulate trains on the move or the sea washing the shores of the inevitable Romagnol beaches as though they were working of the set of [[George M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]. But then, again and again, Fellini has shown us that he is the greatest and most ingenious of M\u00e9li\u00e8s' heirs. Only the magic does not always work, especially in the attempt to create a kind of astonished confession of amused impotence when faced with the new woman of today, together with a feeling of nostalgia for the old woman of the past... Despite Fellini's extraordinary virtuosity, the film rarely achieves harmony of inspiration, of order, of strip-cartoon fantasy, or of irony.\"<ref>Review first published in ''Corriere Mercantile'' ([[Genoa]]) on 4 April 1980. Fava and Vigano, 180</ref> Francesco Bolzoni of ''L'Avvenire'' insisted that Fellini was \"only playing games. But then we would hardly expect from Fellini a deep analysis of the nature of women... It is a game with occasional gaps and, more often, inventions that rejuvenate an all too familiar, all too hackneyed subject. A surprising serenity predominates... It is a film with a tragic vein that in the end proves to be light-hearted and occasionally amusing\".<ref>Review first published in ''L'Avvenire'' ([[Milan]]) on 29 March 1980. Fava and Vigano, 179</ref> ''La Notte'' magazine's Giorgio Carbone felt the maestro had \"finally reached a splendid maturity that permits him to lavish his treasures upon us for the simple pleasure of doing so. Behind the festival of images and colours we can feel his delight in making this film, a delight which, from the very first scene, becomes ours too, and it's something we haven't felt in a long time... If the film lacks suspense in its story (we care little what happens to Sn\u00e0poraz or Katzone because we know that sooner or later [[Rimini]] and those bosomy extras will appear on the scene), there's suspense in the images and in the scenic inventions\".<ref>First published in ''La Notte'' (Milan) on 29 March 1980.

It's terrible, but it's true, his film is worthless.\"<ref>Diary entry dated 6 June 1980. Tarkovsky, 256</ref>\n\n;United States\nReleased by [[New Yorker Films]] in the United States on 8 April 1981, the film garnered generally favorable reviews but little box-office success.<ref name=\"Alpert, 277\">Alpert, 277</ref> Daniel Talbot of ''New Yorker Films'' offered an explanation for the public's lack of interest: \"Here, it played in less than fifty theatres, and of those, six provided 75 percent of the earnings. I don't know what [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] or Fellini could have expected with that kind of personal film. He had lost most of his audience here by then. Which isn't to say that I don't think him one of the great filmmakers of the world.\"<ref name=\"Alpert, 277\"/> For [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, the film was a success: \"Though the film is overlong, even for a Fellini aficionado, it is spell-binding, a dazzling visual display that is part burlesque, part satire, part Folies-Berg\u00e8re, and all cinema. As Sn\u00e0poraz is haunted by the phantoms of all the women he has known, or wanted to know, from childhood on, Mr Fellini in ''City of Women'' is obsessed by his own feelings toward women, by his need for them, his treatment (mostly poor) of them, his continued fascination by them and his awareness that (thank heavens) they'll always be different... Though ''City of Women'' is about a libertine, it's anything but licentious. Mr Fellini's licentiousness suggests a profound longing for some kind of protective discipline, if not complete chastity. As such discipline would destroy Sn\u00e0poraz, it would make impossible the conception and production of a film as wonderfully uninhibited as ''City of Women''.\"<ref>First published in ''The New York Times'' on 8 April 1981. Fava and Vigano, 180</ref>\n\nJohn Gould Boyum of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' observed that \"the film's entire thrust has little or nothing to do with the striking of attitudes, the analyzing of ideas. What Fellini seems after here is the recording and communicating of a set of feelings: those complex, contradictory ones experienced by a middle-aged Italian male suddenly faced with a cataclysmic upheaval in social and sexual mores... We do not go to Fellini to immerse ourselves in story and character or to encounter ideas. What we want from the maestro and what he gives us are fabulous adventures in feeling - a decidedly original mixture of nostalgia, poignancy, and joy that is unmistakably Fellini's own.\"<ref>First published in ''The Wall Street Journal'' on 17 April 1981.
