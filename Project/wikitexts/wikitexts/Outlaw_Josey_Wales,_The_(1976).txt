Driven to revenge, Wales joins a Confederate guerrilla band and makes a name for himself as a feared gunfighter. After the war, all the fighters in Wales' group except for him surrender to Union officers, but they end up being massacred. Wales becomes an outlaw and is pursued by bounty hunters and Union soldiers as he tries to make a new life for himself.\n\nThe film was adapted by Sonia Chernus and [[Philip Kaufman]] from author [[Asa Earl Carter|Asa Earl \"Forrest\" Carter]]'s 1972 novel ''[[The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales]]'' (republished, as shown in the movie's opening credits, as ''Gone to Texas'').<ref name=\"little_fraud\">{{cite web|last=Barra|first=Allen|url=http://www.salon.com/2001/12/20/carter_6/|title=The Education of Little Fraud|website=[[Salon.com]]|date=December 20, 2001|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716164927/http://www.salon.com/2001/12/20/carter_6/|archivedate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> The film was a commercial success, earning $31.8 million against a $3.7 million budget. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] for being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nJosey Wales was portrayed by [[Michael Parks]] in the film's 1986 sequel, ''[[The Return of Josey Wales]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Return of Josey Wales|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/41066/The-Return-of-Josey-Wales/overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209173905/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/41066/The-Return-of-Josey-Wales/overview|url-status=dead|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]]|author=Eleanor Mannikka|date=2015|archive-date=2015-12-09}}</ref> His wife Laura Lee was played by Mary Ann Averett in the sequel.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Josey Wales (character)|Josey Wales]], a [[Missouri]] farmer, is driven to revenge by the murder of his wife and young son by a band of [[Jayhawker#Origins|Redlegs]], a unit of pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Jayhawker]] militants from [[James H. Lane (politician)|Senator James H. Lane]]'s Kansas Brigade, led by the brutal Captain Terrill.\n\nAfter grieving and burying his wife and son, Wales practices shooting a gun before joining a group of pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Missouri [[bushwhacker]]s led by [[William T. Anderson]], taking part in attacks on Union sympathizers and army units. At the conclusion of the war, Josey's friend and superior, Captain Fletcher, persuades the guerrillas to surrender, having been promised by Senator Lane that they will be granted amnesty if they hand over their weapons. Wales refuses to surrender, and as a result, he and a young guerrilla named Jamie are the only survivors when Terrill's Redlegs massacre the surrendering men. Wales intervenes and wipes out many of the Redlegs with a [[Gatling gun]] before fleeing with Jamie, who dies from a bullet wound after helping Josey kill two pursuing bounty hunters.\n\nLane forces a reluctant Fletcher to assist Terrill in finding his friend and puts a $5,000 bounty on his head, attracting the attention of Union soldiers and bounty hunters who seek to hunt him down. Along the way, and despite his aversion to traveling with company, Wales accumulates a diverse group of companions. They include an old [[Cherokee]] man named Lone Watie; Little Moonlight, a young [[Navajo people|Navajo]] woman; Sarah Turner, an elderly woman from Kansas; and her granddaughter Laura Lee, whom Wales and Little Moonlight rescue from a group of marauding [[Comanchero]]s. Josey and Laura later sleep together as do Lone Watie and Little Moonlight. At the town of Santo Rio, two men, Travis and Chato, who had worked for Sarah Turner's deceased son Tom, join the group.\n\nWales and his companions find the abandoned ranch once owned by Tom and settle in.  Travis and Chato are soon after captured by the feared [[Comanche]] tribal leader, Ten Bears. Wales rides to Ten Bears' camp,  parleys with him, and makes peace, with Ten Bears taking a blood oath to live in peace with him and his. Wales rescues Travis and Chato and brings them back to the ranch.\n\nMeanwhile, a bounty hunter whose partner was gunned down by Wales at Santo Rio guides Captain Terrill and his men to the town. The following morning, the Redlegs launch a surprise attack on the ranch. Wales's companions open fire from the fortified ranch house, gunning down all of Terrill's men. A wounded Wales, despite being out of ammunition, pursues the fleeing Terrill back to Santa Rio. When he corners him, Wales dry fires his four pistols through all the empty chambers before holstering them. As Terrill draws his [[Model 1860 Light Cavalry Saber|cavalry sabre]], Wales grabs his hand and, after a slow struggle, forces the blade through Terrill's chest, finally avenging his family.\n\nReturning to the Santa Rio saloon, Wales enters to find the locals are telling Fletcher, along with two [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], how an outlaw named Josey Wales had recently been killed in [[Monterrey, Mexico|Monterrey]], by five pistoleros. The Rangers accept the story, along with a signed affidavit, and move on, while Fletcher says nothing about Wales and pretends not to recognize him. After the Rangers ride off, Fletcher says that he will go to Mexico to look for Wales himself and try to tell him that the war is over. Wales says, \"I reckon so. I guess we all died a little in that damned war\", before riding off.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Josey Wales\n* [[Chief Dan George]] as Lone Watie\n* [[Sondra Locke]] as Laura Lee\n* [[Bill McKinney]] as Terrill\n* [[John Vernon]] as Fletcher\n* [[Paula Trueman]] as Grandma Sarah\n* [[Sam Bottoms]] as Jamie\n* [[Geraldine Keams]] as Little Moonlight\n* [[Woodrow Parfrey]] as Carpetbagger\n* [[Joyce Jameson]] as Rose\n* [[Sheb Wooley]] as Travis Cobb\n* [[Royal Dano]] as Ten Spot\n* [[Matt Clark (actor)|Matt Clark]] as Kelly\n* John Verros as Chato\n* [[Will Sampson]] as [[Ten Bears]]\n* [[William O'Connell (actor)|William O'Connell]] as Sim Carstairs\n* [[John Quade]] as Comanchero Leader\n* Frank Schofield as [[James Henry Lane (Union general)|Senator James H.

The script was worked on by Sonia Chernus and producer [[Robert Daley (producer)|Robert Daley]] at Malpaso, and Eastwood himself paid some of the money to obtain the screen rights.<ref name=\"McGilligan257\">McGilligan (1999), p. 257</ref> [[Michael Cimino]] and [[Philip Kaufman]] later oversaw the writing of the script, aiding Chernus. Kaufman wanted the film to stay as close to the novel as possible in style and retained many of the mannerisms in Wales's character which Eastwood would display on screen, such as his distinctive lingo with words like \"reckon\", \"hoss\" (instead of \"horse\"), and \"ye\" (instead of \"you\") and spitting tobacco juice on animals and victims.<ref name=\"McGilligan257\"/> The characters of Wales, the [[Cherokee]] chief, [[Navajo people|Navajo]] woman, and the old settler woman and her daughter all appeared in the novel.<ref name=\"McGilligan258\">McGilligan (1999), p.258</ref> On the other hand, Kaufman was less happy with the novel's political stance; he felt that it had been \"written by a crude fascist\" and that \"the man's hatred of government was insane\".<ref name=\"little_fraud\"/> He also felt that that element of the script needed to be severely toned down, but, he later said, \"Clint didn't, and it was his film\".<ref name=\"little_fraud\"/> Kaufman was later fired by Eastwood, who took over the film's direction himself.\n\nCinematographer [[Bruce Surtees]], [[James Fargo]], and Fritz Manes scouted for locations and eventually found sites in [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Oroville, California]] even before they saw the final script.<ref name=\"McGilligan258\"/> The movie was shot in [[DeLuxe Color]] and [[Panavision]].<ref name=IMDB/> Kaufman cast [[Chief Dan George]], who had been nominated for an Academy Award for Supporting Actor in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'', as the old Cherokee Lone Watie. [[Sondra Locke]], also a previous Academy Award nominee, was cast by Eastwood against Kaufman's wishes<ref name=\"McGilligan261\">McGilligan (1999), p.261</ref> as Laura Lee, the granddaughter of the old settler woman; at 32 she was a decade older than the character. This marked the beginning of a professional and domestic relationship between Eastwood and Locke that would span six films and last into the late 1980s. [[Ferris Webster]] was hired as the film's editor and [[Jerry Fielding]] as composer.\n\nIn June 1975, it was announced that Eastwood would star in the film with a scheduled Bicentennial Celebration release.<ref>{{cite news|title='Gone to Texas' Packs Eastwood-Style Action|author=Gynter Quill|newspaper=Waco Tribune-Herald|date=June 29, 1975}}</ref> Principal photography began on October 6 in [[Lake Powell]] and nearby [[Paria, Utah]].<ref>{{cite news | date=July 7, 1975| title=Clint Eastwood gets top role in outlaw film| url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/27294521| newspaper=[[Greeley Daily Tribune]] | location=[[Greeley, Colorado]] | page=24 }}</ref><ref name=\"McGilligan261\"/> A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming.

On October 24, 1975, Kaufman was fired at Eastwood's command by producer Bob Daley.<ref name=\"McGilligan264\">McGilligan (1999), p. 264</ref> The sacking caused an outrage amongst the [[Directors Guild of America]] and other important Hollywood executives, since the director had already worked hard on the film, including completing all of the pre-production.<ref name=\"McGilligan264\"/> Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down, and their refusal to do so resulted in a fine, reported to be around $60,000, for the violation.<ref name=\"McGilligan264\"/> This resulted in the Director's Guild passing a new rule, known as \"the Eastwood Rule\", which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then personally taking on the director's role.<ref name=\"McGilligan264\"/> From then on, the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley as the second-in-command.

It was also one of the few Western films to receive critical and commercial success in the 1970s at a time when the Western was thought to be dying as a major genre in Hollywood.\n\nClint Eastwood says on the 1999 DVD release that the movie is \"certainly one of the high points of my career... in the Western genre of filmmaking\".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Meaning==\nIn 2011, Eastwood called ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'' an [[anti-war film]].<ref name=\"WSJ\">{{cite web | last = Judge | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Judge | date = 2011-01-29 | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703293204576106080298279672 | title = A Hollywood Icon Lays Down the Law | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nAs for Josey Wales, I saw the parallels to the modern day at that time.
