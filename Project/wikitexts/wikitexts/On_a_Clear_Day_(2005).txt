It stars [[Peter Mullan]] as Frank Redmond, an engineer in the shipyards on the [[River Clyde]], who becomes stagnant and quickly sinks into depression following his redundancy.  A naturally strong swimmer, Frank gets an idea while on a 'booze cruise' with his friends to swim the [[English Channel]]. Featuring an [[ensemble cast]], it co-stars [[Brenda Blethyn]], [[Sean McGinley]] and [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]], among others.\n\nThe filmed won two [[BAFTA|BAFTA Scotland Award]]s for Best Film and Best Screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] near the banks of the River Clyde. After completing the construction of the ship [[RFA Mounts Bay (L3008)|RFA ''Mounts Bay'']], Frank Redmond (played by [[Peter Mullan]]) and a few of his co-workers are laid off from the shipyards after 36 years service. This, along with his grief still suffered over the drowning of one of his sons many years ago, plummets Frank into a deep depression. He gets on well with his wife, Joan ([[Brenda Blethyn]]), but their relationship is distant. His other son, Rob (Jamie Sives), is a devoted house husband who looks after his twin sons, while ''his'' wife, Angela ([[Jodhi May]]) works full-time at the local [[Jobcentre]]. Rob has a troubled relationship with his father, feeling the guilt of being the 'surviving' son.\n\nAfter a violent [[panic attack]], Frank realizes that he needs some focus in his life, and, after a booze cruise along the [[English Channel]], decides to focus his efforts on swimming across it. Frank trains with the help of friend and local chip shop owner Chan ([[Benedict Wong]]) and former co-workers Danny ([[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]]), Eddie ([[Sean McGinley]]) and Norman ([[Ron Cook]]) until he feels he is fit and ready for the attempt. A successful crossing alleviates the family tensions.\n\n==Filming locations==\nThe production visited Kent to shoot at the foot of the [[White Cliffs of Dover]] where Frank starts his swim of the English Channel and the famous cliffs can also be seen in the background throughout his challenge. The [[Port of Dover]] was used for the scenes where Frank\u2019s family and friends race to meet him in France at the end of his swim.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2005/09/on-a-clear-day-2005/|title=Kent Film Office On A Clear Day Film Focus}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Peter Mullan]] as Frank Redmond\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Joan Redmond\n* [[Jamie Sives]] as Rob Redmond\n* [[Jodhi May]] as Angela Redmond\n* [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]] as Danny\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as Chan\n* [[Sean McGinley]] as Eddie\n* [[Ron Cook]] as Norman\n* [[Shaun Dingwall]] as Observer\n* [[Tony Roper (actor)|Tony Roper]] as Merv\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0410400|On a Clear Day}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:Scottish films]]\n[[Category:Focus Features films]]\n[[Category:Icon Productions films]]\n[[Category:Films about grieving]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gaby Dellal]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stephen Warbeck]]\n[[Category:English-language Scottish films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
