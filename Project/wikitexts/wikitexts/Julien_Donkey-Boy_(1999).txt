The story concentrates on Julien, a man with [[schizophrenia]], played by Scottish actor [[Ewen Bremner]], and his [[dysfunctional family]]. The film also stars [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Julien's sister, Pearl, and [[Werner Herzog]] as his father. ''Julien Donkey-Boy'' was the sixth film to be made under the self-imposed rules of the [[Dogme 95]] manifesto, and the first non-[[Europe]]an film to be made under the [[Dogme 95]] \"vow of chastity\".\n\n==Plot==\nJulien, a young man with untreated [[schizophrenia]], meets a young boy playing with several [[turtle]]s in a [[New York City]] park. Fascinated by the turtles, Julien asks if he can have one. When he is denied, he strangles the boy, then buries his body in the mud before praying for mercy from God.\n \nAt home, Julien resides with his [[dysfunctional family]], consisting of his domineering and emotionless [[Germans|German]] father; his childlike [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] sister Pearl (whose child may be Julien's); his younger brother, Chris, an aspiring [[Wrestling|wrestler]] who spends his days exercising and practicing wrestling moves; and their paternal grandmother, who is largely disconnected from the rest of the family.\n\nThe family's father spends the majority of his time recounting national [[History|historical]] narratives, drinking, and inflicting [[Psychological abuse|psychological]] and [[physical abuse]] on Chris. During one of Chris's exercise sessions, his father forces him outside in the cold and hoses him down with water. He also pines for his deceased wife, going so far as begging Chris to wear his mother's [[wedding dress]] and dance with him. Meanwhile, Julien works as a [[Teaching assistant|teacher's aide]] at a school for the [[Visual impairment|blind]]. Julien spends most of his spare time going to [[confession (religion)|confession]], muttering to himself on the streets, and imagining conversations with [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nJulien is also riddled with [[grief]] over his mother's death, and Pearl sometimes soothes him by pretending to be their mother on the [[telephone]]. Pearl spends most of her days searching for [[Infant|baby]] clothes for her soon-to-be-born child, and making lists of her favorite baby names. Searching for other hobbies, she decides to take up learning to play the [[harp]]. Chris compulsively practices wrestling moves on trash cans, and sometimes incites matches with Julien. Their father recounts historical stories, lambasts Julien and Pearl for \"artsy-fartsy\" [[poetry]] and being \"a dilettante and a slut\" respectively, and pines for his dead wife.\n\nJulien and Pearl accompany their father to a local [[Baptist]] church, where the [[sermon]] has a profound impact on Julien. Some time later, Pearl and Julien spend a day together going [[ice skating]] at an indoor skating rink. Julien tries to sell some homemade skates to a [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] boy and Pearl takes to the ice despite being heavily pregnant. She trips, landing on her [[abdomen]] and causing a [[miscarriage]]. At the hospital, Julien convinces a nurse to let him hold the baby, saying it is his. She allows it, but while alone with the baby, Julien escapes home on a bus. Julien goes to his room, hides under the blankets, cradles the baby and mutters [[prayer]]s.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Julien\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Pearl\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as Father\n* Evan Neumann as Chris\n* Joyce Korine as Grandma\n* Chrissy Kobylak as Chrissy\n* [[Victor Varnado]] as Rapper\n* Brian Fisk as Pond boy\n* Virginia Reath as Gynecologist\n* [[Alvin Law]] as Card-playing neighbor\n* Tom Mullica as Magician\n* Ricky Ashley as Hasidic boy\n* Carmela Garc\u00eda as Nurse\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2021}}\n''Julien Donkey-Boy'' was the first [[United States|American]] film made in accordance with the [[Denmark|Danish]] filmmaking manifesto [[Dogme 95]]. It was shot in [[New York (state)|New York]] on [[MiniDV|MiniDV tape]], the film was transferred to [[16mm|16mm film]] before being blown up to [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] for the master print. Korine used this method to give the film a low-definition, grainy aesthetic.\n\nThe film utilizes several cinematographic styles, including [[stop-motion]] photography, parallel cuts, and still photographs in order to tell its story.\n\n===Dogme 95===\nKorine broke a few of the [[Dogme 95]] rules in making the film. All the camerawork is supposed to be [[Hand-held camera|handheld]], but this film uses [[hidden camera]]s, technically not handheld. There is also non-[[diegetic]] music ([[Oval (musical project)|Oval]]'s \"Mediation\" from ''[[Systemisch]]'' in the ice-skating scene, same group's \"Shop In Store\" from ''[[94 Diskont]]''), although it sounds like it alternates between diegetic and non-diegetic use.  And finally, the director must not be credited; Korine is credited (however, the film only gives his name \u2014 it does not say \"directed by Harmony Korine\", just \"Harmony Korine\").\n\nDespite these transgressions, the original Dogme 95 committee endorsed ''Julien Donkey-Boy''. In an interview on the ''[[Epidemic (film)|Epidemic]]'' DVD, [[Lars Von Trier]], Dogme 95 co-creator, lauded Korine's ability to interpret the rules creatively.\n\n==Release==\nThe film [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in September 1999. It received a [[limited release]] in [[Los Angeles]] at a single cinema on October 15, 1999; the film showed for a month's time at the [[Los Angeles Theatre]], and grossed a total of $80,226 by that November.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0192194/|title=Box office/Business for Julien Donkey-Boy|work=Internet Movie Database|access-date=9 October 2009}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=February 2021}} It was given a [[Wide release|wide theatrical release]] in [[Europe]]an countries the following year, particularly in [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]].
