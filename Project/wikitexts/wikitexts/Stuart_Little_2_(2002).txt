Fox]] as Stuart Little and [[Nathan Lane]] as Snowbell the Cat. Although a sequel to the 1999 film ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'', the plot bears more resemblance to the [[Stuart Little|original novel]] by [[E.B. White]], in which Stuart and Snowbell meet a canary named Margalo (voiced by [[Melanie Griffith]]).\nThe film was released in theaters on July 19, 2002, by [[Columbia Pictures]], and grossed $170 million against a $120 million budget, with it also receiving positive critical reviews.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> It was followed by a third film, a [[direct-to-video]] sequel titled ''[[Stuart Little 3: Call of the Wild]]'' in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=October 2022}}\n{{long plot|date=October 2022}}\nThree years after [[Stuart Little (film)|his adoption]], Stuart Little finds himself overprotected by his adoptive mother Eleanor. He questions his abilities following a disastrous soccer match alongside his adoptive brother George, who accidentally kicked him with a soccer ball, despite said kick scoring the winning goal for their team. He becomes even more downhearted after George's toy airplane is broken in an accident because of him. Stuart's adoptive father Frederick consoles him by telling him that \"every cloud has a silver lining\".\n\nOne day, a seemingly injured young female canary named Margalo falls into Stuart's roadster on his way home from school. Stuart takes her home and introduces her to the Little family, inviting Margalo to stay with them for a while, to which she accepts. Unbeknownst to the Littles, Margalo is secretly in cahoots with a greedy [[peregrine falcon]], who treated her like a slave by forcing her\u00a0to steal objects from households ever since he adopted her when she was orphaned. When the Falcon presses Margalo to find and take an object of value or lose a home that he promised her, she can't seem to concentrate on her job because she's starting to befriend Stuart.\u00a0Eventually, the Falcon loses patience and threatens to kill Stuart if she doesn't deliver. Worried for Stuart's safety, Margalo reluctantly complies and steals a diamond wedding ring belonging to Eleanor later that night.\n\nWhen the Littles discover that Eleanor's ring is missing, they mistakenly think it has fallen down their kitchen sink, not knowing that Margalo had taken it. Stuart offers to be lowered down the drain on a string to get the ring, but the string snaps while he is down the drain. Margalo saves him, but Stuart's thanks to her only makes her feel even more guilty, so she decides to leave. When he can't find her the next day, Stuart assumes she has been kidnapped by the Falcon and decides to rescue her with assistance from the Littles' cat Snowbell. Before he leaves, Stuart asks George to cover for him.\n\nFollowing advice from Snowbell's alley cat friend Monty, Stuart and Snowbell discover that the Falcon resides in the Pishkin Building. Using balloons to make his way to the top of the building, Stuart confronts the Falcon, who reveals to him that Margalo is his slave and that she was forced to take Eleanor's ring while Margalo assures him that although she was following her master's orders, she is still his friend. Stuart begs her to come home with him, but the Falcon refuses to let her leave. Despite Stuart's best attempt to attack the Falcon by firing a bow and arrow at him, he decides to drop the mouse to his death, but Stuart narrowly survives the fall by landing in a passing garbage truck. The Falcon stops Margalo from saving Stuart and imprisons her in a paint can to prevent her from getting out. Snowbell, who has become concerned about Stuart, makes his way to the top of the Pishkin Building and finds Margalo while the Falcon is absent and she explains what had happened, making Snowbell tearfully believe Stuart was killed by the Falcon, not knowing that Stuart is still alive.\n\nRegaining consciousness on board a garbage barge departing from the harbor, Stuart sadly considers giving up until he finds his and George's broken yet still-functioning model airplane on the barge. He cobbles it together with various pieces of junk and uses it to rescue Margalo and Snowbell. Meanwhile, the Littles discover that George has lied to them about Stuart's whereabouts after Eleanor, having believed that Stuart had a sleepover at his friend Will's house the night before, attempts to pick Stuart up, only to learn the truth from Will's mother that he never spent the night there. As a result, Eleanor and Frederick confront George, demanding that he truthfully tell them where Stuart is or face punishment. George is reluctant to break his promise, but when Frederick points out that Stuart's safety is more important than any promise and Eleanor asks George how they would feel without Stuart, he finally confesses Stuart's whereabouts by telling them that he is at the Pishkin Building. However, Frederick assures George that he is still in trouble for lying, as they head out and find Stuart.\n\nMeanwhile, the Falcon discovers Snowbell in Margalo's place after he frees her from the paint can and prepares to push him off the building to his death. Before he can do so, he is intercepted by Margalo, who threatens to drop the ring if the Falcon harms Snowbell before disowning him as her master. The Falcon, furious that Margalo has defected from him, pursues her and attempts to take the ring from her, only for Stuart to intervene as he swoops in on his plane to rescue her. The Littles follow Stuart by taxi as he flies through Central Park, with Margalo at his side and the Falcon in hot pursuit. They lose the Falcon, but he catches up to them and makes an attempt to send the two plummeting to their deaths after detaching the plane's upper wing, damaging the main one and making it enter a steep dive, which fails when Stuart recovers from the dive.\n\nUnable to outrun the Falcon, Stuart lets Margalo off to keep her safe from harm. He turns and flies the damaged plane in a kamikaze run while the Falcon goes into an attack dive in an attempt to kill Stuart. In order to let the Falcon's guard down, Stuart uses the light of the sun reflected in Eleanor's ring to temporarily blind him and quickly jumps out, using a bandana as a parachute. The kamikaze attack works and the Falcon is struck by the plane which explodes into pieces, sending him falling out of the sky before landing in a garbage can in front of Monty, who is scavenging for food. When his parachute is sliced apart by the shattered plane's propeller, Stuart falls, but is soon saved by Margalo. They reunite with the Littles, where Margalo safely returns Eleanor's ring before Snowbell also reunites with them.\n\nSometime later, Margalo says goodbye to the Littles and leaves to migrate south for the winter, with Stuart's infant sister Martha finally saying her first words \"Bye, bye, birdie\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Stuart Little characters}}\n\n===Live-action cast===\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Mrs. Eleanor Little, the mother of the Little family and Frederick's wife.\n* [[Hugh Laurie]] as Mr. Frederick Little, the father of the Little family and Eleanor's husband.\n* [[Jonathan Lipnicki]] as George Little, the eldest child of the Little family and Stuart's older brother.\n* Anna and Ashley Hoelck as Martha Little, the infant daughter of the Little family and Stuart and George's younger sister.\n* [[Marc John Jefferies]] as Will Wilson, George's loyal best friend.\n* [[Jim Doughan]] as Stuart and George's soccer coach.
