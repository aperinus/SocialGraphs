It was the last of Hoffman's films to be finished and premiered before his death.\n\n==Plot==\nIssa Karpov, a political refugee from [[Chechnya]] who has been tortured by Russian security forces, illegally enters [[Hamburg]], Germany.\n\nG\u00fcnther Bachmann leads a covert German government team that seeks to recruit local informants with ties to [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist]] organizations. The disheveled G\u00fcnther's polar opposite is his efficient right-hand associate, Irna Frey. The team learns of Karpov's presence and his suspected links to Chechen terrorists.\n\nBachmann's team is also tracking the activities of a local, respected, Muslim philanthropist, Dr. Abdullah, whom the team suspects is funnelling a small portion of his legitimate funds to [[al-Qaeda]], though the team is unable to prove this. High-ranking German security official Mohr and American diplomatic attach\u00e9 Sullivan both learn of these investigations and take an interest.\n\nBachmann is interested in watching suspects and \"turning\" informants higher and higher up the chain, while protecting the na\u00efve who are caught up in the nefarious affairs of others. Mohr and Sullivan appear single-minded and interested in merely capturing suspects, regardless of guilt or future usefulness. Bachmann had been disgraced in the past for an apparently serious failure and shows signs of self-neglect, but is a sophisticated operative who understands Islamic terrorism, and distrusts politicians and American intelligence agents.\n\nKarpov contacts an immigration lawyer, Annabel Richter, who helps put him in contact with Tommy Brue, a wealthy banker whose father had long ago done a favor for Karpov's father.  Karpov shows Brue a letter from Brue's father to Karpov's, along with the key to a safe deposit box, and asks for Brue's help.  The favour Brue's father did for Karpov's, a member of the Russian mafia, is revealed to be [[money laundering]].  Karpov is informed that he is the legal heir to a multi-million-euro account long held by Brue's bank.  Karpov identifies with his maternal Chechen and Muslim heritage, considers the money unclean, and indicates that he does not want it.\n\nBachmann's team is able to [[Asset (intelligence)|turn]] Brue and Richter to their cause. At the behest of Bachmann, Richter convinces Karpov to donate the funds to Abdullah's organization, in the hope that Abdullah will reroute some of the funds to a shipping company acting as a front for al-Qaeda. Bachmann plans to use this proof of guilt to turn Abdullah and ensnare those higher up in the terrorist organization. The plan is approved by the interior minister and supported by Sullivan, who has become an apparent ally of Bachmann. Bachmann secures asylum for the innocent Karpov.\n\nDuring the fund transfer at Brue's bank, Abdullah does indeed route funds to the shipping company. Bachmann, posing as a taxi driver, picks up Abdullah with the goal of turning him into an informant without disrupting his life or family. As Bachmann is about to drive away, he is ambushed by agents reporting to Mohr and Sullivan, who handcuff Abdullah and Karpov and whisk them away. Bachmann yells in anger as Frey, Richter, and Brue look on in shock. Bachmann drives off, defeated.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as G\u00fcnther Bachmann\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Annabel Richter\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Tommy Brue\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Martha Sullivan\n* [[Grigoriy Dobrygin]] as Issa Karpov\n* [[Derya Alabora]] as Leyla\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as Max\n* [[Nina Hoss]] as Irna Frey\n* [[Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer]] as Michael Axelrod\n* [[Martin Wuttke]] as Erhardt\n* [[Kostja Ullmann]] as Rasheed\n* [[Homayoun Ershadi]] as Dr. Faisal Abdullah\n* [[Mehdi Dehbi]] as Jamal Abdullah\n* [[Vicky Krieps]] as Niki\n* [[Rainer Bock]] as Dieter Mohr\n* {{ill|Tamer Yi\u011fit (actor, born 1974)|de|3=Tamer Yi\u011fit (Schauspieler, 1974)|lt=Tamer Yi\u011fit}} as Melik Oktay\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography took place in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] in September 2012.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/a-most-wanted-man-begins-shooting/5046993.article | title=''A Most Wanted Man'' begins shooting | work=[[Screen International]] | publisher=[[Emap International Limited]] | date=25 September 2012 | access-date=30 July 2013 | last=Sandwell | first=Ian}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nIn July 2013, [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] acquired the US distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lionsgate Acquires ''A Most Wanted Man''; John Le Carre Adaptation Stars Philip Seymour Hoffman And Rachel McAdams|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/07/lionsgate-acquires-a-most-wanted-man-john-le-carre-adaptation-stars-philip-seymour-hoffman-and-rachel-mcadams|access-date=31 July 2013|newspaper=Deadline.com|date=30 July 2013}}</ref> On 11 April 2014, the first trailer for the film was released.<ref>{{cite news|last=Enk|first=Bryan|title=''A Most Wanted Man'' Trailer: Philip Seymour Hoffman Reminds Us Of His Greatness|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-news/a-most-wanted-man-exclusive-trailer-premiere-philip-seymour-hoffman-rachel-mcadams-164016171.html|access-date=11 April 2014|newspaper=Yahoo.com|date=11 April 2014}}</ref> A new trailer for the UK was revealed on 30 June.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Anderton|first1=Ethan|title=Philip Seymour Hoffman Smokes in 'A Most Wanted Man' UK Trailer|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2014/philip-seymour-hoffman-smokes-in-a-most-wanted-man-uk-trailer/|access-date=3 July 2014|publisher=firstshowing.net|date=30 June 2014}}</ref> On 25 July 2014, the film received a limited release in the United States, beginning with 361 theatres and later expanding wider.
