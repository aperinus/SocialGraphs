It is the fourth installment in the [[American Pie (series)#Theatrical films|''American Pie'' theatrical series]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $235 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> \nThirteen years after their [[American Pie (film)|high school graduation]], Jim Levenstein lives in the [[Chicago area]] with his wife Michelle and their two-year-old son. Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher works as a [[sportscaster]] in [[Los Angeles|LA]] with his unfaithful supermodel girlfriend Mia and is clearly unhappy, Kevin is married and works from home as an [[architect]], Paul Finch tells his friends that he has been traveling the world, and Steven Stifler works as an office temp for a verbally abusive boss.\n\nFormer classmate John, one half of the \"[[MILF]]\" duo, organizes the Class of 1999 [[high school reunion]] in East Great Falls, [[Michigan]]. Jim and Michelle return to Jim's dad's house, where he encounters his neighbor Kara, whom he used to babysit, and is almost 18. \n\nAt a local bar, Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch meet Selena, Michelle's friend from band, and Stifler appears unexpectedly. The next day, at the beach, Oz meets his high school girlfriend, Heather, who is dating a [[cardiologist]], Ron, and Kevin reconnects with [[high school sweetheart]] Vicky. Stifler destroys Kara's boyfriend's [[jet-ski]], much to the disapproval of the guys. That night, they stumble upon Kara's birthday party. Kara gets drunk; Jim drives her home, and she tries to seduce him. Kevin wakes up next to Vicky and assumes they had drunken sex.\n\nJim and Michelle attend a party hosted by Stifler and bring Jim's [[widower]] dad along, who Stifler gets drunk. Kevin confronts Vicky who maintains they did not have sex. Mia takes [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], and Ron humiliates Oz. Heather comforts Oz, and they reconcile before Mia and she get into a fight. Jim's dad meets Stifler's mom.\n\nMichelle, concerned about the recent lack of sex in their marriage, attempts to have [[BDSM]] sex with Jim but is interrupted by Kara. Her boyfriend arrives and a fight breaks out between his friends and Jim's. Michelle finds out that Kara seduced Jim and tried to lose her virginity to him. Jim tells Michelle he does not care about Kara. Upset, both Kara and Michelle leave. The police arrest Finch for stealing his boss's motorcycle, which Stifler thinks is funny. Exasperated by Stiffler's immaturity, the guys rally to Finch's side, reiterating they dislike Stifler. Distraught, Stifler ends the party.\n\nThe next morning, Jim's dad offers him advice on how to fix his marriage. Finch admits to being an assistant manager at [[Staples Inc.|Staples]]. The boys ultimately learn that despite Stifler's immature behavior, he genuinely cares about them. They then apologize to him, they also sympathize with him when they realize how unhappy he is, and insist that high school would not have been fun without him. \n\nStifler quits his job but not before standing up to his boss and they head to the reunion together: Kevin reconciles with Vicky; Finch makes amends for lying to Selena; Oz reunites with Heather after breaking up with Mia and Stifler punches Ron for threatening Oz. Jim reconciles with Michelle and Nadia (who appears with a man by her side) interrupts them having sex but is pleased to see them still together. Jessica reveals that she is a lesbian, and with Stifler's help, Sherman hooks up with Loni. \n\nStifler is offered work as a wedding planner. He then meets Rachel Finch (Paul Finch's mom) who makes a brazen sexual pass at him and they proceed to have sex on the [[lacrosse]] field. John is reunited with his estranged buddy, Justin, and they watch Stifler having sex with Mrs. Finch while shouting \u201cMILF!\u201d from the bleachers.\n\nThe next morning: Jim and Kara apologize to each other; Oz plans to stay in town with Heather; Finch plans a trip with Selena to [[Europe]]; and Stifler drops subtle hints about sleeping with Finch's mom. Kevin proposes a pact for them to reunite once a year.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Jim's dad gets [[fellatio]] from Stifler's mom in a movie theater.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:American Reunion Cast 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The film's cast, at [[Harry's Cafe de Wheels]] in [[Sydney]] 2012.]]\n<!-- THE CAST LIST IS ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Jim Levinstein\n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as Michelle Flaherty\n* [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] as Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher\n* [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]] as Kevin Myers\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Steven \"Steve\" Stifler\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as Paul Finch\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Noah Levinstein\n* [[Tara Reid]] as Vicky\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Heather\n* [[John Cho]] as MILF Guy #2\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Stifler's Mom\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Jessica\n* [[Dania Ramirez]] as Selena\n* [[Katrina Bowden]] as Mia\n* [[Jay Harrington]] as Dr. Ron\n* [[Ali Cobrin]] as Kara\n* [[Chuck Hittinger]] as AJ\n* [[Shannon Elizabeth]] as Nadia\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Sherman\n* Justin Isfeld as MILF Guy #1\n* [[Charlene Amoia]] as Ellie\n* [[Vik Sahay]] as Prateek Duraiswamy\n* [[Molly Cheek]] as Jim's Mom\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] (''uncredited'') as Rachel Finch\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn October 2008, [[Universal Pictures]] announced it was planning to produce a fourth theatrically released sequel to the first film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/2008/10/28/universal-eyeing-american-pie-4/ |title=Universal Eyeing American Pie 4?

The site's critical consensus reads, \"It'll provide sweetly nostalgic comfort food for fans of the franchise, but ''American Reunion'' fails to do anything truly new or interesting \u2013 or even very funny \u2013 with the characters.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_reunion_2012/ | title = American Reunion (2012)| website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=March 10, 2020}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/american-reunion|title=American Wedding reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=2014-01-22}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= American Reunion \u2013 CinemaScore |work= [[CinemaScore]] |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Roger Ebert]], who gave the film three out of four stars:<ref>{{cite news| title=American Reunion | first= Roger|last= Ebert| author-link= Roger Ebert|date= April 4, 2012 |work= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/american-reunion-2012 | access-date=2012-05-04}}</ref>\n<blockquote>The charm of ''American Pie'' was the relative youth and na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the characters. It was all happening for the first time, and they had the single-minded obsession with sex typical of many teenagers. ''American Reunion'' has a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu, but it still delivers a lot of nice laughs. Most of them for me came thanks to Stifler... If you liked the earlier films, I suppose you gotta see this one. Otherwise, I dunno.</blockquote>\n\n''[[The Village Voice]]'' concludes its review with the following:<ref>{{cite news| title= The Shelf Life of the Clinton-era Tested in ''Titanic 3D'' and ''American Reunion'' | first= Nick |last= Pinkerton |date= April 4, 2012 |work= The Village Voice | url= http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-04-04/film/the-shelf-life-of-the-clinton-era-tested-in-titanic-3d-and-american-reunion/2/ | access-date=2012-05-04}}</ref>\n<blockquote>After some strained \"Remember the time . . .\" callbacks to 13-year-old gags, ''American Reunion'' gets comfortable and funny, as Hurwitz and Schlossberg hit familiar marks from unexpected angles, while the ensemble interplay is \"routine\" in the best sense of the word. Taken altogether, the ''Pie'' movies offer a cohesive worldview, showing each of life's stages as the setting for fresh-yet-familiar catastrophes, relieved by a belief in sex, however ridiculous it might look, as a restorative force. The recipe is so durable and the sustained character work so second-skin by now, one can imagine the Pie films keeping with the dramatis personae through middle age and into the problems of geriatric love, a raunch-comic version of Britain's documentary ''Up'' series. ''American Midlife Crisis''? ''American Retirement''? ''American Funeral''? Let's go!</blockquote>\n\n[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave ''American Reunion'' a positive review of two and half stars out of four saying, \"''American Reunion'' reminds us what we liked about the original: the way the movie sweetened its raunch to build a rooting interest in these characters.\"<ref>{{cite magazine
