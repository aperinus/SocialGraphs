On the way to the airport, he has a chance encounter with Ethan Tremblay with his dog Sonny, who is going to Los Angeles to be an actor and is planning to scatter his recently deceased father's ashes at the [[Grand Canyon]]. When Ethan misuses the words \"[[terrorism|terrorist]]\" and \"bomb\" while talking to Peter, they are both escorted off the plane. Peter, now on the [[No Fly List]] and missing his wallet, agrees to drive with Ethan to Los Angeles.\n\nEthan stops to buy [[marijuana]], and Peter discovers that they are nearly out of money. Since Peter has no I.D., he gets his wife to wire money to Ethan, but discovers Ethan had the money wired to his stage name instead of his legal name. When the Western Union employee refuses to accept Ethan's \"Stage name I.D.\" it leads to a violent altercation.\n\nAfter a night at a [[rest stop]], Peter decides to drive off and abandon Ethan, but realizes that he has forgotten to unload the ashes of Ethan's father when he left. This causes him to wrestle with his conscience, before deciding to return, and covering for his absence by saying he had gone to buy breakfast. Ethan takes over driver duty so Peter can get some rest after a sleepless night, but he falls asleep at the wheel and crashes the car. Peter calls his friend, Darryl, for assistance and decides to part with Ethan, but Darryl persuades Peter otherwise. They arrive at Darryl's house for rest. During their conversation, Ethan discovers hints that Sarah may have been unfaithful, triggering Peter to question Sarah's timely pregnancy. Darryl throws both of them out after mistakenly drinking some of Ethan's father's ashes, which were stored in a coffee tin.\n\nDarryl lets them use his [[Range Rover]] to make the rest of the trip. Ethan and Peter get high and begin to bond, but Ethan then mistakenly drives to the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. Despite assuring Peter that he'll handle the situation, Ethan flees, and Peter is arrested for possession of marijuana. The [[Mexican Federal Police]] lock Peter up, but Ethan steals a truck and breaks him out, causing several car crashes in the process.\n\nPeter decides to stop at the [[Grand Canyon]] for Ethan, who finally scatters his father's ashes. Peter then confesses that he tried to leave Ethan at the rest area. Ethan makes a confession of his own: he has had Peter's wallet and I.D the entire time. Peter seemingly forgives him but then attacks Ethan in a rage, but is interrupted by a call from Sarah, who has just gone into labor. Peter and Ethan leave for California. Ethan finds a gun in the truck and he accidentally shoots Peter. Arriving at the hospital where Sarah is in labor, Peter passes out from loss of blood.\n\nSarah delivers the baby safely, and Peter expresses his discomfort at his new daughter being named Rosie Highman. Ethan leaves to meet with a Hollywood agent while telling Peter to call him. At the end, Ethan guest stars on an episode of his favorite television program, ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' with Peter and Sarah watching it in bed with their daughter. Ethan texts Peter during the episode, indicating that the two have become friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Peter Highman\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Ethan Tremblay / Ethan Chase\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Sarah Highman\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Heidi (Playing the same character from ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'')\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Darryl Johnson\n* [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] as TSA Agent\n* [[RZA]] as Airline Screener\n* [[Danny McBride (actor)|Danny McBride]] as Western Union Employee Lonnie\n* [[Todd Phillips]] as Barry\n* [[Mimi Kennedy]] as Sarah's Mom\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as New Father\n* [[Aaron Lustig]] as Dr. Greene\n* [[Marco Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Marco Rodr\u00edguez]] as Federal Agent\n* [[Brody Stevens]] as Chauffeur\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as [[Charlie Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Charlie Harper]] {{small|(Cameo)}}\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as [[Alan Harper (Two and a Half Men)|Alan Harper]] {{small|(Cameo)}}\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Marketing==\nThe first trailer was released July 14, 2010.
