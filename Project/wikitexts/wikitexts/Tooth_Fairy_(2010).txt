One night, Derek steals a dollar from his [[girlfriend]] Carly's six-year-old daughter Tess that had been left for her lost tooth, and tells her that the [[tooth fairy]] doesn't exist. He receives a [[Summons|magical Summons]] under his pillow, which causes him to grow wings and transports him to the realm of tooth fairies. He meets his caseworker, Tracy, and the head fairy, Lily. He has an adversarial relationship with them. Lily tells Derek that he is a \"dream crusher,\" due to his unsympathetic dealings with children like Tess. He is sentenced to serve two weeks as a tooth fairy. Later, he meets Jerry, who gives him his tooth fairy supplies, which include \"Shrinking Paste,\" \"Invisible Spray,\"  \"[[Peppermint|dog peppermints]] \"[[Amnesia]] Dust.\"\n\nCarly's 14-year-old son, Randy, dislikes Derek. Randy wants to grow up to be a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] star. When Derek defends Randy against a bully, he begins to win Randy over, and Derek begins teaching Randy to play his electric guitar better so he can win a talent show.\n\nDerek visits several children and tries his best to be a good tooth fairy, but ends up causing more harm than good. Lily says that he is the worst tooth fairy ever and denies Derek any more supplies from Jerry for the remainder of his sentence, criticizing his lack of faith in children. Afterward, he is approached by a fairy named Ziggy who provides him [[black market]] supplies. Later that night, the items malfunction and Derek is seen by a child's mother and arrested. While behind bars, Tracy tells Derek that Lily extended his duty to three weeks. However, he offers to give Derek proper supplies if he will start acting like a tooth fairy. Carly bails Derek out.\n\nDerek works on improving his tooth fairy skills and bonding with Tracy and Randy, but when Derek can't score a goal at a hockey game, he takes his frustration out on Randy, telling him that he will never become a rock star. With his dreams crushed, Randy tearfully smashes his guitar and a disappointed Carly breaks up with Derek, telling him his biggest flaws are his inability to be optimistic and that he can't say \"what if\".\n\nLater, Tracy comes to Derek's house, much to Derek's annoyance. He announces that he is a tooth fairy-in-training, but that Derek's dream crushing reputation hurts himself more than others as Derek orders him to get out of his house. At the next hockey game, Derek gets back on the ice and sees Tracy. Tracy wants to teach Derek the importance of dreams, encouraging Derek to score a goal and go get Tess' tooth. With a renewed spirit, Derek scores the goal, gets into his tooth fairy costume, and flies away, while Tracy spreads Amnesia Dust on the audience to cover up the event.\n\nAt Carly's, Tess sees Derek taking her tooth, but she promises to keep it a secret. Derek apologizes to Randy and encourages him to keep pursuing his dreams, using his magic wand to grant Randy a new guitar. Downstairs, Carly sees Derek as a tooth fairy, but assumes that he rented a costume for Tess' sake, causing her to forgive him. Derek flies Randy to the talent show throwing Amnesia Dust on him when they arrive.\n\nDerek heads back to the fairy realm to give Lily the tooth, and is told that because of this job, as well as for reaffirming Tess' belief, he has been relieved of his fairy duties. Lily explains that he will never see the tooth fairies again and will have Amnesia Dust thrown on him. Before departing, Derek says a friendly goodbye to Tracy. Lily throws Amnesia Dust on Derek and transports him back to the talent show. There, Randy outperforms everyone and ends up forming a band. Derek proposes to Carly, and she accepts.\n\nUltimately, Derek is seen playing [[Winger (ice hockey)|left wing]] for the [[Los Angeles Kings]], and when he sees Lily and Jerry in the crowd, he doesn't recognize them. Jerry secretly helps him score a goal.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Derek Thompson, a hockey player forced to become a Tooth Fairy as punishment for being a \"dream crusher\".\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as Carly Harris, Derek's girlfriend.\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as Lily, the head of the Tooth Fairies.\n* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Tracy, a wingless tooth fairy assigned to be Derek's case manager.\n* [[Chase Ellison]] as Randy Harris, Carly's fourteen-year-old son and Tess' older brother who loves [[electric guitar]].\n* Destiny Whitlock as Tess Harris, Carly's six-year-old daughter.\n* [[Ryan Sheckler]] as Mick \"the Stick\" Donnelly, Derek's new teammate, a highly talented, but disrespectful young hockey player.\n* [[Brendan Meyer]] as Ben, Randy's classmate who verbally attacks him.\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Jerry, a fairy working for Lily who provides Derek his tooth fairy supplies.\n* [[Seth MacFarlane]] as Ziggy, a fairy that sells black market tooth fairy items.\n* [[Brandon T.
