BB is a smooth-talking con-artist who scams naive and comely young women with his sales pitches, while Tilley is a hapless loser.\n\nThey first meet when BB, driving his new [[Cadillac]] off the lot, backs into Tilley's own Cadillac. Though Tilley had the right of way, each man blames the other, and an escalating feud erupts between them.\n\nAfter BB smashes Tilley's headlights and Tilley shatters BB's car windows in response, BB sets out to seduce Tilley's long-suffering wife Nora in revenge. Immediately after having sex with Nora, he calls Tilley to taunt him with the news. Tilley tells BB to keep Nora; he wants to be rid of her.\n\nMeanwhile, both men have their own personal troubles. BB's older partner and mentor, Moe Adams, is hospitalized with a serious heart condition. Tilley has a gambling problem and squanders what little money he makes betting on horse races, causing a rift with Nora. He is in debt to various creditors and the [[IRS]], which begins confiscating his possessions for unpaid property taxes. Exhausted by their rivalry, the two men decide to play a game of [[Eight-ball|pool]] to decide who should get Nora in order to end to their personal war. BB loses, but he does not honor the bet. He has fallen in love for the first time, and Nora moves in with him.\n\nThe newly formed [[Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation|Maryland Home Improvement Commission]] is investigating corrupt sales practices in the home-improvement industry. Both men are subpoenaed, and after giving testimony about their sales practices, the commission takes away both of their licenses. While Tilley gives up his license reluctantly, BB does so willingly as part of his new outlook on life. BB, seeing that Tilley has lost everything, including his car, takes pity on him and gives him a ride. Together, the two freshly unemployed men begin sharing ideas for a new business they can create for themselves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Bill \"B.B.\" Babowsky\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Ernest Tilley\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Nora Tilley\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Moe Adams\n* [[Jackie Gayle]] as Sam\n* [[Stanley Brock]] as Gil\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as \"Cheese\"\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as \"Mouse\"\n* [[J.T.
