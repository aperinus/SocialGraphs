The film, which stars [[Michael Douglas]], [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Sterling Jerins]], was released on July 25, 2014. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, and performed modestly at the box office. The film was the second collaboration between Reiner and Douglas, after ''[[The American President]]'' (1995).\n\n== Plot ==\nOren Little (Douglas), a realtor by trade, develops self-absorption, turning his back on his neighbors and shunning the notion of kindness to others. After his wife dies, part of his self-absorption is having no patience for children, not even his own now-adult estranged son. His next-door neighbor, Leah (Keaton), whose own husband has likewise died, never had any children of her own, which leads her to throw her soul and her tears into reviving a singing career that had stagnated.\n\nOne day, Oren's estranged son Luke suddenly leaves his father in charge of his own ten-year-old daughter Sarah (Sterling Jerins), a granddaughter whom Oren never knew existed. When Luke drops Sarah off at his home, needing his father to take care of her, neither Oren nor Leah, each of whom are lonely souls, have any reason to suspect that Sarah's involvement with their lives will enable them to heal their emotional wounds.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Oren Little\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Leah\n* [[Sterling Jerins]] as Sarah Little\n* [[Annie Parisse]] as Kate\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Artie\n* Albert Jones as Reggie\n* [[Yaya DaCosta]] as Kennedy\n* Paloma Guzm\u00e1n as Selena\n* [[Scott Shepherd (actor)|Scott Shepherd]] as Luke Little\n* [[Frances Sternhagen]] as Claire\n* [[Andy Karl]] as Ted Westburg\n* [[Frankie Valli]] as Club Owner\n* [[David Aaron Baker]] as David Shaw\n* [[Theo Stockman]] as Russell\n* Meryl Williams as Rita\n\n== Production ==\nFilming began in June 2013 in [[Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Production Begins on Rob Reiner's AND SO IT GOES\u2026 Starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton|url=http://collider.com/and-so-it-goes-rob-reiner-filming/|accessdate=12 July 2013|newspaper=collider.com|date=11 June 2013}}</ref> Shooting also took place in [[California]] and [[Greater Manchester]].\n\n=== Music ===\nOn December 17, 2013, it was announced that [[Marc Shaiman]] had composed the music for the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marc Shaiman Scoring Rob Reiner's 'And So It Goes'|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2013/12/17/marc-shaiman-scoring-rob-reiners-and-so-it-goes/|accessdate=July 21, 2014|publisher=filmmusicreporter.com|date=December 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nThe first trailer for the film was released on May 9, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=McDaniel|first=Matt|title='And So It Goes' Trailer: Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton Finally Unite|url=http://yahoo.com/entertainment/blogs/movie-news/and-so-it-goes-exclusive-trailer-michael-douglas-diane-keaton-205341042.html|accessdate=22 June 2020|work=Yahoo!|date=9 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nReleased on July 25, 2014, the film earned $4,642,329 in its opening weekend.
