The screenplay was adapted by [[J. J. Connolly]] from his 2000 [[Layer Cake (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The film's plot revolves around a [[London]]-based criminal, played by [[Daniel Craig]], who works in the [[cocaine]] trade and wishes to leave the drug business. The film also features [[Tom Hardy]], [[Colm Meaney]], and [[Sienna Miller]]. Craig's character is unnamed in the film and is listed in the credits as \"XXXX.\"\n\nThe film was produced by Adam Bohling, David Reid and Matthew Vaughn, with [[Stephen Marks]] as executive producer. The title refers to the [[Social class in the United Kingdom|social strata]], especially in the British criminal underworld.\n\n==Plot==\nThe protagonist XXXX (otherwise unnamed) is a London cocaine distributor who abhors violence and operates with the care and professionalism of a legitimate businessman. His chief associates are his enforcer and partner Morty, and Gene, an Irish gangster who serves as his liaison to mob boss Jimmy Price. Just as XXXX is ready to retire from criminal life, he is summoned to a lunch meeting with Jimmy, who gives him two tasks.\n\nThe first is to track down Charlie, the drug-addicted runaway daughter of one of Price's associates. XXXX enlists the con men, Cody and Tiptoes, to find her; they learn that Charlie has apparently been kidnapped, but are unable to discover who abducted her.\n\nThe second task is for XXXX to oversee the purchase of one million ecstasy tablets from the \"Duke\", a low-level criminal who recently returned to London from [[Amsterdam]] with his girlfriend Slasher and crew of thugs led by his right-hand man Gazza. Unbeknownst to XXXX, the Duke and his crew have stolen the pills from a gang of Serbian war criminals. He meets the Duke's feckless nephew, Sidney, and finds himself attracted to his girlfriend Tammy. XXXX tries to broker the sale of the pills to [[Liverpool]] gangsters Trevor and Shanks but they refuse, informing him of their origin and that the vengeful Serbians have sent the assassin Dragan to recover the pills and kill the thieves. As the Duke had mentioned his name to the Serbians, XXXX is also a target.\n\nXXXX arranges a tryst with Tammy but is kidnapped and brought to Eddie Temple, a wealthy crime lord. Eddie explains that Charlie is his daughter, whom he has recovered; Jimmy, having recently lost a fortune due to bad investments he blames on Eddie, wanted her as a hostage until Eddie recouped his losses. Eddie gives XXXX a recording, revealing that Jimmy has been working as an informant for [[Scotland Yard]], planning to betray XXXX to the police once the pills were sold in exchange for immunity for his own crimes and XXXX's money. Eddie demands that XXXX sell him the pills instead.\n\nXXXX assassinates Jimmy at his home, but later finds that his accountant, an associate of Jimmy's, has vanished along with XXXX's money. Confronted by Gene and Morty, he shares the evidence of Jimmy's betrayal, and the pair acknowledge him as the new acting boss. Gene shows them the corpse of the Duke, who was killed by one of his men when Slasher threatened to go to the cops if Jimmy did not help them out of their situation. XXXX hires a hitman to ambush and kill Dragan, but he kills the hitman first and makes XXXX promise to recover the pills.\n\nSidney brings XXXX to Duke's old hideout, and as he tries to bargain with Gazza for the pills, the police arrive. XXXX and the Duke's gang barely escape the raid, while Dragan watches from afar as the pills are confiscated. However, it turns out that XXXX arranged for the raid, with Cody and Tiptoes posing as officers to secure the pills. XXXX delivers the Duke's severed head to Dragan as a peace offering; satisfied, Dragan reports to the Serbians that the police have seized the drugs. The Serbians accept the loss, which is revealed to be a small amount in comparison to their overall manufacturing capacity.\n\nWhen XXXX and his crew arrive at Eddie's warehouse to sell the pills as arranged, Eddie's henchmen relieve them of the drugs at gunpoint, and Eddie welcomes him to the \"layer cake\" of criminal hierarchy. Having anticipated this double-cross, XXXX arranges Trevor and Shanks to gun down Eddie's men in an armed robbery, take the drugs, and sell them so he can settle his accounts. The gang assembles for lunch at the [[Stoke Park, Buckinghamshire|Stoke Park Country Club]], honouring their new boss; however, XXXX declines their offer of leadership and follows through on his initial plan to retire. With Tammy on his arm, he exits the club, but is shot by the jilted yet apologetic Sidney. He collapses, bleeding out on the steps.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as XXXX\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Gene\n* [[Kenneth Cranham]] as Jimmy Price\n* [[George Harris (actor)|George Harris]] as Morty\n* [[Jamie Foreman]] as the Duke\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Eddie Temple\n* [[Marcel Iure\u0219]] as Slavo\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as Clarkie\n* [[Tamer Hassan]] as Terry\n* [[Ben Whishaw]] as Sidney\n* [[Burn Gorman]] as Gazza\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Slasher\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Tammy\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as Cody\n* [[Steve John Shepherd]] as Tiptoes\n* [[Louis Emerick]] as Trevor\n* [[Stephen Walters]] as Shanks\n* [[Francis Magee]] as Paul the boatman\n* [[Dragan Mi\u0107anovi\u0107]] as Dragan\n* [[Nathalie Lunghi]] as Charlie\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Crazy Larry\n* [[Matt Ryan (actor)|Matt Ryan]] as Junkie 2\n* [[Ivan Kaye]] as Freddie Hurst\n}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming began in June 2003.

Of Craig's performance, he said, \"Craig is fascinating here as a criminal who is very smart, and finds that it is not an advantage because while you might be able to figure out what another smart person is about to do, dumbos like the men he works for are likely to do anything\".
