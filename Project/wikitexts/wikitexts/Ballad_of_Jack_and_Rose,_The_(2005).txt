He is struggling to keep landowners from building developments on the [[wetland]]. His teenaged daughter Rose is a beautiful but isolated girl with a passion for gardening. Since Rose's mother had left the family, Jack homeschooled his daughter and did not expose her to life beyond their small island home.\n\nJack believes that they both \"need a woman around\". He travels to the [[mainland]] to ask his girlfriend Kathleen to move in with them. Jack breaks the news to a shocked Rose, from whom he had kept his relationship a secret. Rose remains disdainful when Kathleen and her two teenage sons move in. Kathleen struggles to adapt to the Slavins' rural lifestyle. Her sons, Thaddius and Rodney, are almost polar opposites; Thaddius is a sullen, rude delinquent, while Rodney is insecure and often overlooked.\n\nWhile she still has a strained relationship with Kathleen, Rose develops strange bonds with her new \"step-brothers\". It is clear that Thaddius is attracted to her, but Rose does not like him. One night, Rose spies on Jack and Kathleen in bed together, and develops a strange jealousy toward Kathleen. Rose decides to lose her virginity, and shocks Rodney by confronting him topless and asking him for sex. Rodney refuses and reasons with her, and instead ends up giving her a dramatic haircut.\n\nAfterward, Rose calmly takes her father's shotgun and possibly misfires it into Jack and Kathleen's bedroom as they sleep. An initially shocked Jack confronts Rose in disbelief, but the two seem to forget the event within minutes. Kathleen asks Jack about his relationship with Rose, and how she might have psychological problems that should be dealt with. Jack denies that his daughter has any problems. Meanwhile, Rose and Rodney become good friends.\n\nRodney is often criticized by his mother for being overweight, and the two fight constantly about his diet, but Rose sees only his kindness and intelligence.  However, still on a mission to lose her virginity, Rose's thoughts turn to Thaddius. While trapping a [[eastern copperhead|copperhead]] intended for scaring Kathleen, Rose sees Thaddius and a girl named Red Berry having sex in the woods. Later that night, Thaddius enters Rose's room and though she dislikes him, Rose allows him to have sex with her. The copperhead, which Rose has kept in its cage under her bed, escapes into the house when the lock of the cage is loosened and drops open by the vibrations of the bed that Thaddius and Rose are having sex in.\n\nTo irk her father, Rose hangs her bloodied bedsheet in the front yard. Jack is furious that his daughter has been \"ruined\" and gives Thaddius one day to move out.  Meanwhile, Kathleen is cornered by the copperhead. The resulting chaos puts the whole household on edge. That night, Rose holds a screening of a homemade movie about the hippie commune in her treehouse.\n\nAs the film rolls, Thaddius advances on Rose and is stopped by Jack. After a scuffle, Thaddius falls from the treehouse and is rushed to the hospital. Rose runs away and hides for days. Jack finally finds her in one of the housing developments, but quickly leaves to take care of a \"transaction\". Back on the island, Jack offers Kathleen ten thousand dollars, then fifteen, in order to have her move out. Kathleen agrees at twenty thousand.\n\nJack returns to Rose's hideout, and she is overjoyed with the news that Kathleen is gone. That night, Rose kisses Jack; the shock that his daughter is in love with him\u2014and that he allowed her to kiss him\u2014makes him upset, and he weeps. Waking the next morning, the memory of the kiss haunts Jack. He and Rose go to the house of the housing developer, Marty Rance, and Jack breaks down, finding that he has no fight left in him. He tries to sell his property to Rance, upsetting Rose.\n\nHe and Rose return home, and Jack dies in his sleep overnight. Rose had originally planned to kill herself when her father died, but after setting the house on fire and lying down next to Jack's body, she changes her mind and escapes. Two years later, Rose is shown living in [[Vermont]] and working in a [[greenhouse]] where Gray, her father's friend from the island, works as well.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Jack Slavin\n*[[Camilla Belle]] as Rose Slavin\n*[[Catherine Keener]] as Kathleen\n*[[Ryan McDonald (Canadian actor)|Ryan McDonald]] as Rodney\n*[[Paul Dano]] as Thaddius\n*[[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Gray\n*[[Jena Malone]] as Red Berry\n*[[Beau Bridges]] as Marty Rance\n*[[Susanna Thompson]] as Miriam Rance\n\n==Reception==\n''The Ballad of Jack and Rose'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 23, 2005; it was later given a [[limited release|limited theatrical release]] on March 23, 2005, grossing $59,459 in its opening weekend, in four theaters.
