Directed by [[Alex Gibney]] and produced by [[HBO]], it is based on [[Lawrence Wright]]'s book ''[[Going Clear (book)|Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison of Belief]]'' (2013). The film premiered at the 2015 [[Sundance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]]. It received widespread praise from critics and was nominated for seven [[Emmy Award]]s, winning three, including Best Documentary. It also received a 2015 [[Peabody Award]] and won the award for [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay|Best Documentary Screenplay]] from the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2015|Writers Guild of America]].\n\nThe film deconstructs the church's claims by presenting a condensed history of Scientology and its founder, [[L. Ron Hubbard]], examining how celebrities interact with the church, and highlighting the stories of a number of ex-members and of the abuse and exploitation that they described seeing and experiencing. The [[Church of Scientology]] responded vehemently to the film, complaining to film critics about their reviews and denouncing the filmmakers and their interviewees.\n\n''Going Clear'' was released in a limited number of theaters on March 13, 2015, and aired on HBO on March 29, 2015. It was a major ratings success and by mid-April 2015 had attracted 5.5 million viewers, making it the second most-watched HBO documentary in the past decade. It was subsequently released internationally, showing in theaters and on television despite a sustained campaign by the Church of Scientology to block its release.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n''Going Clear'' is based closely on Lawrence Wright's book, covering much of the same ground with the aid of archive footage, dramatic reconstructions, and interviews with eight former Scientologists:<ref name=\"WSJ-26-Jan-2015\" /><ref name=\"NYT-15-Jan-2015\" /> [[Paul Haggis]], an Oscar-winning film director; [[Mark Rathbun]], the church's former second-in-command; [[Mike Rinder]], the former head of the church's [[Office of Special Affairs]]; actor [[Jason Beghe]]; Sylvia \"Spanky\" Taylor, former liaison to [[John Travolta]]; and former Scientologists Tom DeVocht, Sara Goldberg, and Hana Eltringham Whitfield.<ref name=\"ScreenDaily-28-Jan-2015\">{{cite news|url=http://www.screendaily.com/features/interviews/alex-gibney-going-clear/5082389.article?blocktitle=INTERVIEWS&contentID=41866|title=Alex Gibney, Going Clear: Scientology And The Prison Of Belief|last=Pritchard|first=Tiffany|publisher=Screendaily.com|date=January 28, 2015|access-date=January 31, 2015|archive-date=February 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206190844/http://www.screendaily.com/features/interviews/alex-gibney-going-clear/5082389.article?blocktitle=INTERVIEWS&contentID=41866|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe film breaks into three distinct acts. In the first, the former Scientologists describe how they joined Scientology; the second act recounts the history of Scientology and its founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]]; and in the final act, the film airs allegations of the abuse of church members and misconduct by its leadership, particularly [[David Miscavige]], who is accused of intimidating, beating, imprisoning, and exploiting subordinates. The film depicts the role played by celebrity members, such as Travolta and [[Tom Cruise]], through video clips contrasting their statements with the experiences of former Scientologists.<ref name=\"Guardian-26-Jan-2015\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-going-clear-scientology-documentary-alex-gibney|title=Sundance 2015 review: Going Clear \u2013 Scientology film preaches to converted|last=Moylan|first=Brian|work=The Guardian|date=January 26, 2015|access-date=January 28, 2015|archive-date=April 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093302/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/26/sundance-2015-review-going-clear-scientology-documentary-alex-gibney|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo support its thesis, the film utilises footage of ex-Scientologists harassed and surveilled (per Hubbard's dictum that the church's critics were all criminals whose crimes needed to be exposed),<ref name=\"NYTimes-26-Jan-2015\">{{cite news|url=http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/sundance-2015-scientology-documentary-draws-crush-of-festgoers/|title=Sundance 2015: Scientology Documentary Draws Crush of Festgoers|last=Buckley|first=Cara|work=The New York Times|date=January 26, 2015|access-date=January 28, 2015|archive-date=January 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129083319/http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/sundance-2015-scientology-documentary-draws-crush-of-festgoers/|url-status=live}}</ref> and describes the imprisonment of senior Scientology executives in a facility known as \"[[The Hole (Scientology)|The Hole]]\";<ref name=\"Variety-26-Jan-2015\" /> one Scientologist was said to have been forced to clean a bathroom with his tongue.<ref name=\"AP-26-Jan-2015\">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/01/25/sundance-first-look-oscar-winner-alex-gibney-pulls-back-curtain-on-scientology/|title=Sundance First Look: Oscar winner Alex Gibney pulls back curtain on Scientology|last=Cohen|first=Sandy|agency=Associated Press|date=January 26, 2015|access-date=January 28, 2015|archive-date=September 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924173700/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/01/25/sundance-first-look-oscar-winner-alex-gibney-pulls-back-curtain-on-scientology/|url-status=live}}</ref> According to the film, actress [[Nicole Kidman]] was targeted for wiretapping by Scientology in an effort to break her marriage to Tom Cruise after she was labeled a \"potential trouble source\" by the church;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/25/scientology-doc-going-clear-claims-the-church-split-up-tom-cruise-and-nicole-kidman.html|title=Scientology Doc 'Going Clear' Claims the Church Split Up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman|last=Stern|first=Marlow|work=The Daily Beast|date=January 26, 2015|access-date=January 28, 2015|archive-date=April 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407050147/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/25/scientology-doc-going-clear-claims-the-church-split-up-tom-cruise-and-nicole-kidman.html|url-status=live}}</ref> whereas Travolta has been forced to stay in the church in fear that secrets from his personal life will be exposed.<ref name=\"USA-26-Jan-2015\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/01/26/controversial-scientology-documentary/22337995/|title=Scientology doc 'Going Clear' shocks Sundance filmgoers|last=Puig|first=Claudia|work=USA Today|date=January 26, 2015|access-date=January 28, 2015|archive-date=January 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128000337/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/01/26/controversial-scientology-documentary/22337995/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n\n[[File:Alex Gibney 2011 Shankbone.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Alex Gibney, director of ''Going Clear'']]\nThe film is based on the [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning journalist Lawrence Wright's book ''Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief'', which was published in January 2013 and was a [[National Book Award]] finalist. HBO announced in December 2014 that Alex Gibney, an Oscar-winning director who made ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'' (2005), ''[[Taxi to the Dark Side]],'' (2007) and ''[[The Armstrong Lie]]'' (2013), was directing a film based on the book, to be released at the 2015 Sundance Festival. It was the first time that HBO had tackled Scientology directly, though not the first time it had clashed with the church; in 1998, protesters mounted demonstrations outside HBO's headquarters because of a documentary that presented anti-depressant drugs, which are fiercely opposed by Scientology, in a positive light.<ref name=\"HuffPost-1-Dec-2014\">{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/hbo-scientology-documentary_n_6249180.html|title=HBO's Pending Scientology Documentary Investigates Church's Hold On Hollywood Stars|last=Puente|first=Maria|work=USA Today|date=December 1, 2014|access-date=January 28, 2015|archive-date=January 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127164244/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/hbo-scientology-documentary_n_6249180.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nGibney began working on ''Going Clear'' in 2013 after becoming intrigued by Wright's book.

Jason Bailey of ''[[Flavorwire]]'' wrote that \"pretty much every critic who wrote about ''Going Clear''\" received an email from Scientology spokesperson [[Karin Pouw]]. He commented that the church did not seem to realise that film critics do not usually try to interview people for reviews, and noted how neatly it \"comports with the film's portrayal of the Church as a hive of shady, paranoid control freaks.\"<ref name=\"Indiewire-Feb-3-2015\">{{cite news|title=Church of Scientology Representatives Now Bullying Film Critics|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/church-of-scientology-representatives-now-bullying-film-critics-20150202|last=O'Connell|first=Max|date=February 2, 2015|access-date=February 3, 2015|publisher=Indiewire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208024742/http://blogs.indiewire.com/criticwire/church-of-scientology-representatives-now-bullying-film-critics-20150202|archive-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In an email to Flavorwire, Gibney observed that \"anytime someone writes something \u2013 film criticism or social criticism \u2013 about Scientology, the Church of Scientology counter-attacks by smearing critics.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Church of Scientology targets film critics over Going Clear documentary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/03/church-of-scientology-attacks-film-critics-going-clear-documentary|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|work=The Guardian|date=February 3, 2015|access-date=February 3, 2015|archive-date=February 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203125224/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/03/church-of-scientology-attacks-film-critics-going-clear-documentary|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Indiewire]]'s Max O'Connell criticised the church's approach for being counterproductive. He predicted that \"their campaign against the film is going to be the best publicity that Alex Gibney and company could ever hope for, if also a hassle for critics and filmmakers and (this is no small thing) a nightmare for the ex-CoS members who dared to speak out against the Church's practices. But then, they don't seem terribly aware that attacking everyone who criticizes you doesn't do a lot of good for your image.\"<ref name=\"Indiewire-Feb-3-2015\" /> Paul Haggis, who was labeled \"doughy\" and \"pasty\" by the church, likewise felt that the attacks were backfiring: \"You don't think that makes you look really bad trying to slander me in that way? I'm an imperfect human being. And I've made many, many mistakes in my life. So you can absolutely publicize any of those.

Not only did it effectively provide free advertising for the film, but its hostility had made HBO Documentary Films even more determined to produce the film: \"I thought, 'They really don't want us to do it. All the reason more to do it.'\"<ref name=\"Guerassio\" />\n\n===Campaign to influence Oscar awards===\n\nFollowing the film's success at the Emmys, the church was reported to have mounted an aggressive campaign to deny it recognition at the Oscars. The church's campaign included producing an anti-Gibney film and approaches to members of the Academy's documentary branch, responsible for selecting contenders for the awards. Several members of the documentary branch reported receiving approaches from the Church's magazine ''Freedom'' in connection with a planned profile of Gibney. Although the Church denied that its actions had anything to do with the Oscars, Lawrence Wright suggested that its \"more feverish attention to the documentary\" had to do with it feeling \"threatened by the possibility that [the Hollywood] community would examine the church more closely\" as the Oscars approached.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scientology-ramps-up-going-clear-829957|title=Oscar voters tell THR they have been targeted by the church as screenings prompt fights and police probe the mysterious apparent suicide of Jim Carrey's girlfriend|last1=Ford|first1=Rebecca|last2=Johnson|first2=Scott|date=October 7, 2015|access-date=October 10, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|archive-date=October 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009205836/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scientology-ramps-up-going-clear-829957|url-status=live}}</ref> In January 2016, according to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', the film and Gibney were reported to have been \"snubbed\" by Oscar voters and not included in the Best Documentary category of the [[88th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Siegel |first=Tatiana |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-nominations-scientology-doc-going-855769 |title=Oscar Nominations: Scientology Doc 'Going Clear' Shut Out |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2016-01-14 |access-date=2016-01-14 |archive-date=August 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808043010/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-nominations-scientology-doc-going-855769 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{official website|www.hbo.com/documentaries/going-clear/|name=HBO Documentary Films}}\n* {{official website|www.jigsawprods.com/going-clear/|name=Jigsaw Productions}}\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/entertainment/a-sneak-peek-at-the-hbo-documentary-on-scientology/2015/01/28/850fcc62-a731-11e4-a162-121d06ca77f1_video.html Preview footage from the film] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812142753/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/entertainment/a-sneak-peek-at-the-hbo-documentary-on-scientology/2015/01/28/850fcc62-a731-11e4-a162-121d06ca77f1_video.html |date=August 12, 2017 }}\n* {{IMDb title|4257858}}\n* {{rottentomatoes|going_clear_scientology_and_the_prison_of_belief_2015}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n\n=== Video interviews ===\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NAemGUUvXw Spotlight shines on controversial Scientology documentary] \u2013 CNN interview (January 26, 2015)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWY_zhDXXDU Alex Gibney and Lawrence Wright on the Challenges of Making 'Going Clear'] \u2013 ''Slate'' interview (January 27, 2015)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19YGhuORcJk 'Going Clear' Documentary Exposes The Church of Scientology: Sundance Short Cuts] \u2013 ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (January 27, 2015)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mfjgNlmjHk Lawrence Wright and Alex Gibney on Scientology and 'Going Clear'] \u2013 ''Variety'' interview (January 28, 2015) \n* [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/28/alex-gibney-going-clear-scientology-and-the-prison-of-belief-interview-documentary-film Alex Gibney interview: journey into the seductive world of Scientology] \u2013 ''Guardian'' interview (June 28, 2015)\n\n{{EmmyAward Documentary Special}}\n{{Alex Gibney |state=collapsed}}\n{{Scientology}}\n{{HBO documentaries}}\n\n[[Category:2015 documentary films]]\n[[Category:2015 films]]\n[[Category:2015 in religion]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about religion]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alex Gibney]]\n[[Category:HBO documentary films]]\n[[Category:Scientology in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Scientology-related controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Scientology-related controversies in television]]\n[[Category:Television controversies in the United States]]\n[[Category:Works critical of Scientology]]\n[[Category:Television Academy Honors winners]]\n[[Category:Primetime Emmy Award-winning broadcasts]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
