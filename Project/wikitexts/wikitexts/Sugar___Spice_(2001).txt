The plot follows a group of high school cheerleaders who conspire and commit [[armed robbery]] when one of them becomes pregnant and desperate for money.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.<ref name=\"metacritic\" /> It grossed a worldwide total of $16.9 million against a budget of $11 million.<ref name=\"latimes.com\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is told by Lisa Janusch, the spiteful and jealous head cheerleader of Lincoln High School's B-squad.\n\nDiane Weston, the popular head cheerleader of Lincoln High School's A-squad, becomes pregnant by the well-known football quarterback Jack Bartlett. The two are kicked out of their parents' homes and find an apartment of their own. Jack initially has issues keeping a job, but eventually gets hired at a video rental store. In spite of their issues coming up with the rent money, Jack and Diane try as hard as they can to survive while going to school at the same time. Lisa, Diane's spiteful rival, occasionally runs into Jack at the rental store. She is interested in winning Jack's heart, but fails to get his attention.\n\nAfter struggling with the rent and anticipating the financial hardship of supporting a family, Diane and her four cheerleader squadmates, Kansas Hill, Cleo Miller, Lucy Whitmore, and Hannah Wald, plan the perfect bank robbery. They promise each other not to tell Jack about their plan, due to his inability to lie to others.\n\nThe squad watches [[heist film]]s to learn how to rob banks, and Kansas visits her mother at the women's penitentiary for tips on where to find weaponry. Following the women's advice, Diane and her friends visit a bug exterminator, Hank \"The Terminator\" Rogers, who sells illegal arms and ammo. After failing to negotiate on prices, Hank offers to give them the guns for free on the condition that they befriend his socially awkward daughter, Fern, and put her on their squad.\n\nThe squad reluctantly accepts Fern into their circle, and they all begin rehearsing the robbery, as well as their choreography for the winter ball. During winter break, they order doll masks to hide their identities. Lucy backs out of the heist because she receives a scholarship to [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. At Christmas, Diane receives an engagement ring from Jack. She then learns he sold his GTO in order to buy her the ring. The squad is forced to obtain a new getaway vehicle, prompting Fern to volunteer her father's work van with bad brakes.\n\nAt their first robbery at a supermarket, Lucy returns to the group having decided to help them after all. Lisa happens to be in the store at the time of the robbery, and notices that they perform cheerleader stunts in order to cover up the security cameras. The squad robs the bank and come close to shooting a customer after one of the guns discharges. They make off with armloads of cash and honor their success after burning their costumes. The robbery is widely reported in the media. Neither Diane nor her friends expect Lisa to suspect them until they are confronted by her and the B-squad in the high school cafeteria, followed by the FBI.\n\nDiane and her friends are arrested and need an alibi, so Diane promises to promote Lisa to captain of the A-squad in order to keep Lisa silent, since she is approaching her third trimester and cannot do meticulous activity. The group is outraged, but come to appreciate the decision. In order to cover up her actions, Diane tells Jack she won the lottery and after they have their twins, Jack wins his senatorial campaign, and Diane's squad lead successful lives after high school.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Marla Sokoloff]] as Lisa \"The Informer\" Janusch\n* [[Marley Shelton]] as Diane \"The Mastermind\" Weston\n* [[Melissa George]] as Cleo \"The Stalker\" Miller\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Kansas \"The Rebel\" Hill\n* [[Rachel Blanchard]] as Hannah \"The Virgin\" Wald\n* [[Alexandra Holden]] as Fern \"The Terminator\" Rogers\n* [[Sara Marsh]] as Lucy \"The Brain\" Whitman\n* [[James Marsden]] as John \"Jack\" Bartlett\n* [[Sean Young]] as Mrs. Hill\n* [[W.
