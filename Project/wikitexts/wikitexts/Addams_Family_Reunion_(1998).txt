Directed by Dave Payne, the film was intended to serve as a pilot for a [[The New Addams Family|new proposed television series]] produced by [[Saban Entertainment|Saban]]. The film stars [[Daryl Hannah]] and [[Tim Curry]] as [[Morticia Addams|Morticia]] and [[Gomez Addams]] respectively while [[Carel Struycken]] and [[Christopher Hart (actor)|Christopher Hart]]'s hand are the only ones to reprise their roles from the last two films. The film's plot focused on the eccentric, macabre aristocratic Addams family mistakenly arriving at the wrong family reunion and encountering a man ([[Ed Begley Jr.]]) who seeks to commit murder in order to inherit a fortune.\n\nPayne had intended to give the film a dark, edgy tone, but Saban had interfered with the development, insisting that the story be aimed solely at entertaining children, and lack much of the [[black comedy]] and [[satire]] of the previous films. Saban also wanted Payne to imitate aspects of [[Paramount Pictures]]' popular 1991\u201393 duo of films, and the 1964 TV series, and rejected any original idea developed by Payne and the film's screenwriters. As a result, the film was poorly received by critics, who criticized the film's screenplay, special effects, production design, and much of its acting, while singling out Tim Curry's performance for praise, calling Curry the best part of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nDiscovering that his grandparents have developed \"Waltzheimer's disease\", a disease that is slowly turning them \"normal\", Gomez plans a [[family reunion]], hoping that some branch of his enormous family tree will find a cure. However, Gomez sends a card written in blood, which damages the machines of the company organizing the reunion and results in the Addams receiving the wrong invitation.\n\nGomez, Morticia, Fester, Lurch, and the grandparents drive to a luxury resort for the family reunion. Gomez meets psychiatrist Dr. Philip Adams, who plans to poison his wealthy father Walter Adams and rearrange his will. Gomez hopes that Dr. Adams can cure his grandparents.\n\nPhilip's brother and his wife, who are headed to the reunion, are given the wrong address and end up in the Addams family mansion, where Granny and Cousin Itt are staying. They stay there as guests, but are increasingly abused by their hosts. Granny learns that the wife is vegetarian, so she feeds her with a plant: [[Atropa belladonna|deadly nightshade]]. Cousin Itt plays poker with the husband, and wins over most of the man's fortune.\n\nPugsley falls in love with Gina Adams, a young bespectacled girl. Wednesday antagonizes two of her new snobby \"cousins\", children of Philip. Lurch saves Gina's mother from drowning in the swimming pool. He falls in love with the woman, while she is disgusted with him. Walter Adams expresses his hatred for his son and most of his family. Fester and Thing do their best to capture Butcher, Fester's mutated puppy who feeds on human hair.\n\nPhilip initially refuses to help Gomez in any way, but agrees to a bet. If he beats Gomez in a game, he will earn thousands of dollars. If Gomez wins, Philip will offer his services to him. Philip is overconfident, as he is a champion in many games. But Gomez easily defeats him in successive challenges, in the games of [[darts]], [[table tennis]], and tennis. Philip is publicly humiliated in the process.\n\nInstead of offering his services as previously agreed, an enraged Philip attacks Gomez in public. They have a knife fight, which Gomez eventually wins. While Gomez holds his knife to Philip's throat, the police arrive. Gomez and Morticia are arrested for attempted murder, Pugsley and Wednesday are arrested for digging open the grave of the resort's founders. Fester is considered insane and becomes a mental patient, while Butcher and Thing are captured by a sadistic dog catcher. Lurch has been buried alive by Wednesday and is unable to escape.\n\nPugsley and Wednesday are taken in by [[Child and family services|child services]], and placed in [[foster care]] with Philip's wife. Meanwhile Philip gains custody over Fester, and tortures him with an [[electric chair]]. He has previously used this chair to torture other patients. The dog-catcher plans to feed Thing to one of his dogs. Gomez and Morticia are unable to escape a police cell.\n\nWalter Adams has taken a liking to Gomez, and posts bail for him and Morticia. He helps them rescue Lurch, who then helps rescue the rest of the family. Pugsley and Wednesday were in the process of torturing their foster family, but are happily reunited with their parents. The Addams Family strap Philip in his own electric chair, and have him tortured by his patients.\n\nThe Addams Family eventually return to their mansion, and leave their increasingly \"normal\" grandparents in the care of Philip's wife. Wednesday amuses herself with lighting fireworks, while Pugsley seems melancholic. Gomez asks him if he misses Gina, but Pugsley is instead sad because he forgot his \"Siberian firecracker\" back at the foster family's house.\n\nAt this point, the \"firecracker\" is revealed to have been a nuclear weapon and the Addams Family witness a distant nuclear explosion apparently caused by it. Morticia comments that a nuclear winter is swiftly approaching and that she feels gloomy. Gomez and Morticia kiss, finishing the movie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Tim Curry]] as [[Gomez Addams]]\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as [[Morticia Addams]]\n* [[Nicole Fugere]] as [[Wednesday Addams]]\n* [[Jerry Messing]] as [[Pugsley Addams]]\n* [[Patrick Thomas (actor)|Patrick Thomas]] as [[Uncle Fester|Uncle Fester Addams]]\n* [[Carel Struycken]] as [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]]\n* [[Christopher Hart (actor)|Christopher Hart]]'s hand as [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as [[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama Addams]]\n* [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Great-grandfather Mortimer Addams\n* [[Estelle Harris]] as Great-grandmother Delilah Addams\n* [[Haylie Duff]] as Gina Adams\n* [[Phil Fondacaro]] as [[Cousin Itt]]\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Dr. Philip Adams\n* [[Ray Walston]] as Walter Adams\n* [[Diane Delano]] as Dolores Adams\n* [[Heidi Lenhart|Heidi Noelle Lenhart]] as Melinda Adams\n* [[Hilary Shepard|Hilary Shepard Turner]] as Katherine Adams\n* Rodger Halston as Geoff Adams\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Dogcatcher (uncredited)\n* [[Conrad Janis]] as Hotel Bar Patron (uncredited)\n* [[Leigh Taylor-Young]] as Patrice (uncredited)\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\nFollowing the success of the theatrically released films ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'', released in 1991 and its 1993 sequel, ''[[Addams Family Values]]'', [[Saban Entertainment|Saban]] negotiated to purchase the home video production rights to the [[The Addams Family|Addams Family]] brand in order to take advantage of the [[direct-to-video]] market.<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{Cite news|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/the-crazy-story-behind-the-addams-family-movie-you-145222630.html|title=The crazy story behind the third Addams Family film that went straight-to-VHS|website=uk.movies.yahoo.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> Because of the underwhelming commercial performance of ''Addams Family Values'', as well as the death of [[Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1]], who had played [[Gomez Addams]], [[Paramount Pictures]] ultimately decided not to produce a third film, resulting in Saban deciding to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the series.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/268995|title=Addams Family Reunion: The Sequel That Time Forgot|website=Den of Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-16}}{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n''Addams Family Reunion'' was co-produced by Saban with [[Warner Bros.]] The two studios planned to produce a new series called ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', and intended to produce a two-hour pilot film for the series, which eventually became ''Addams Family Reunion''; Saban planned to premiere the film on a cable network owned by the company before releasing it on video, and to follow the film with a television series if the film did well.<ref name=Yahoo/><ref name=DenOfGeek/>\n\n''Addams Family Reunion'' was scripted by Rob Kerchner, who had experience writing numerous direct-to-video sequels, and Scott Sandin; Saban wanted the script to be aimed only for children, with little attempt made to engage an adult audience.
