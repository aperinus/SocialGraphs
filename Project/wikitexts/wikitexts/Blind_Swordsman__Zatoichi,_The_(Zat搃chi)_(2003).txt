It premiered on 2 September 2003 at the [[Venice International Film Festival]], where it won the prestigious [[Silver Lion|Silver Lion for Best Director]] award, and went on to numerous other awards both at home and abroad. It also stars [[Tadanobu Asano]], [[Michiyo Okusu]], [[Yui Natsukawa]], Guadalcanal Taka, [[Daigoro Tachibana]], Yuko Daike, [[Ittoku Kishibe]], [[Saburo Ishikura]] and [[Akira Emoto]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film's plot follows a traditional theme, with Zatoichi (a blind swordsman) coming to the defense of townspeople caught up in a local [[yakuza]] [[gang|gang war]] and being forced to pay excessive amounts of [[protection money]]. Meanwhile, Zatoichi befriends a local farmer and her gambler nephew and eventually offers his assistance to two [[geisha]] siblings (one of whom is actually a man) who are seeking revenge for the murder of their parents. The siblings are the only survivors of a robbery and massacre that was carried out on their family estate ten years ago. They soon discover the people responsible for the murders are the same yakuza wreaking havoc on the small town.\n\nAfter slicing his way through an army of henchmen with his sword, Zatoichi defeats the yakuza's bodyguard, a powerful [[r\u014dnin]], in a duel. Zatoichi later wanders into town and confronts the yakuza bosses, killing the second-in-command and blinding the elderly yakuza boss (who had been masquerading as a bumbling old waiter up until this point) after surprising him by opening his eyes. The film ends with a dance number led by noted Japanese [[tap dance]] troupe ''The Stripes'', and Zatoichi walking down a trail and tripping over a rock, saying \"Even with my eyes wide open, I can't see anything.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takeshi Kitano]] as [[Zatoichi]]\n* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as the [[r\u014dnin]] Hattori Gennosuke\n* [[Michiyo Okusu]] as Aunt O-ume, the [[farmer]]\n* [[Yui Natsukawa]] as O-shino, Hattori's wife\n* [[Daigoro Tachibana]] as O-sei\n* [[Taichi Saotome]] as young O-sei\n* [[Y\u016bko Daike]] as O-kinu, sister of Osei.\n* Guadalcanal Taka as Shinkichi, gambler nephew of Oume.\n* [[Ittoku Kishibe]] as Ginzo, gang leader\n* [[Saburo Ishikura]] as Ogiya, gang leader\n* [[Akira Emoto]] as \"Pops\", tavern owner\n\n==Production==\nKitano revealed that he was approached by others to create the film and therefore differed from his own techniques and followed the common filmmaking process in order to please them and make a pure-entertainment film.<ref name=\"AV Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/takeshi-kitano-13882 |title=Takeshi Kitano Interview |publisher=[[The A.V.

The director said he made the decision feeling that the film needed percussion-based music and that Hisaishi is not a flexible composer, and also suggested that Hisaishi had become too expensive for him.
